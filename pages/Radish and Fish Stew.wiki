|desc_suspicious = It certainly looks like the complete package, but careful tasting will reveal that there is no flavor of fresh fish in the radishes at all... Wait a minute, what are these fishbones doing in there instead?
|desc_basic      = The de-skinned radishes have gone into the pot first to cook before large hunks of fish and seasonings are added in. The whole combination is then stewed on a low flame. The large servings of food &mdash; best served with rice &mdash; give everyone present a feeling of satisfaction.
|desc_delicious  = Migratory fish have experienced many trials of the bitter cold, towering waves, and tumultuous storms en route to arriving upon the stove, and together with the radish, they have absorbed the essence of the flavorful soup long before they were ladled onto your plate. This sweetness warms the heart and soul, like a fire in the midst of a blistering world of snow.

==Trivia==
*This dish may be based on {{Lang|''buri daikon''|ja=ぶり大根|ja_lit=yellowtail radish}}, a traditional Japanese dish consisting of simmered {{w|Japanese amberjack|yellowtail}} (also known as Japanese amberjack) and {{w|daikon|daikon radish}}.
*The text "many trials of the bitter cold, towering waves, and tumultuous storms" in the delicious version probably refers to ''buri-okoshi'' (lit. "yellowtail roar"), or a thunderous storm in early winter that signals the yellowtail fishing season.<ref>Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan: [https://www.maff.go.jp/e/policies/market/k_ryouri/search_menu/menu/buri_daikon_ishikawa.html Buri Daikon (yellowtail and Japanese radish)]</ref>
