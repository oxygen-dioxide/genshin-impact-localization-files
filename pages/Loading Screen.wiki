The '''Loading Screen''' comes up every time a player teleports, enter or exit a domain, or when a cutscene begins or ends. Icons for the seven [[elements]] are displayed in the middle of the screen, at the bottom of the screen, or displayed one by one in the bottom right-hand corner. The screen has a white or black background depending on the in-game time. The icon in the center represents the area entered when loading finishes: either a [[region]], a special area such as [[Dragonspine]], or a domain. These loading screens also give tips for playing the game or hints about the lore. Players can click anywhere on the loading screen to view another tip.

A variation of the loading screen is used when players load into the game from the title screen. This loading screen always has a white background and only contains icons for the seven elements. If the player is on a mobile device, such as a tablet or a phone, then this screen may also have a tip that says "Wearing headphones may improve your gaming experience" and display a headphones icon.

==About Loading==
During the loading processes the resources are rendered in so the player can interact with them. Loading occurs when any of these events are triggered:
* Starting and exiting the game
* Breaking and regaining connection
* [[Teleport Waypoints|Teleporting]] to a location that has not rendered (either as the result of a quest or by manually clicking the teleport waypoint)
** Using a [[Portable Waypoint]] or [[Sub-Space Waypoint]] will quickly reload the location.
* Entering or exiting a [[Domain]]
* Entering or exiting [[Co-Op Mode]]
* Entering or exiting the [[Serenitea Pot]]
* In the middle of a [[Weekly Bosses|Weekly Boss]] fight, when the cutscene is not playing, but when the next stage has not been rendered in.
* During a [[Reset]], to kick players out of boss fights or domains.
Currently, there is no shortcut to manually reload a scene.
