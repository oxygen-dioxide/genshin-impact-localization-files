==Profile==
Like other characters in the Mirage (besides Idyia), the blue-haired Zosimos that the Traveler meets is a [[Hydro Eidolon]] replica of a human from Teyvat that once visited Mirage and then left it.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Back to Normal: The Story Hidden in the Bottle}}</ref>

The real Zosimos works as a prop designer for stage performances, but has been dreaming of creating his own show for a long time. He has been aspiring to be a director since he was very young. Judging from his attire, it is implied that he came from [[Fontaine]].

Zosimos is an aspiring stage director who wishes to create his own show, which is a story about a thief and a mage. After meeting the Traveler and their friends, he invites [[Kokomi]], [[Klee]], and [[Kaeya]] to star on his show and asks the Traveler to be the backstage crew. He also lets Klee and Kaeya keep their stage costume as a thank you for helping his show.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Treehouse Theater: Candlelit Shadows Dancing}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Like other characters in the Mirage, Zosimos has watery-blue hair and glowing blue eyes. He wears typical Fontaine male attire without a hat and has a moustache.

:'''Zosimos:''' Oh, it's been a while, haha. How are you? Enjoying yourself here?
:'''Zosimos:''' Thanks to you, the Veluriyam Mirage is back in action! The missing pieces are gradually being restored, and this place is becoming just as lively as it was before.
:{{DIcon}} About the show...
::'''Zosimos:''' Oh, thanks in no small part to your efforts, I finally saw my own show! And I got a lot of useful feedback, too.
::'''Zosimos:''' I'll keep working hard on my storytelling skills! I shall definitely become a true "Director."
:{{DIcon}} About the Hydro Eidolons...
::'''Zosimos:''' The Hydro Eidolons, right? They can't speak, but... "We" have our ways of communicating.
::'''Zosimos:''' To me, they are extremely reliable partners.
::'''Zosimos:''' In fact, the outdoor stages simply can't function without them. If you have time, you should see for yourself.
::'''Zosimos:''' As for the stories... Hehe, most were written by yours truly. As always, your honest feedback would be greatly appreciated.
:{{DIcon}} Pardon me, I need to leave now.
::'''Zosimos:''' Haha, no problem! This is a nice place, so take your time looking around. Ah, and don't forget, you are always welcome to give me suggestions for improvements.
