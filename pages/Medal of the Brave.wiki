'''Medal of the Brave''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Brave Heart]].

==Description==
The [[Arundolyn|little hero]] slipped out of doors by night, and with [[Rostam|his friend]] rushed headlong into wolves' forest.<br>With his slingshot he chased boars, and with sturdy branches he would battle imaginary monsters.<br>Following the shining [[Seelie]] deep into the woods, he discovered a treasure that had laid buried for a thousand years.

The treasure was a small yellow flower.

When the tired hero returned to his childhood bedroom, and flipped through the proof of his first adventures,<br>He discovered to his surprise that the long-hidden flower had yet to wilt.<br>Yet in this it was alone, for everything else had changed with the passing of years.
