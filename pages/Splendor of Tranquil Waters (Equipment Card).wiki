==Story==
{{Description|"...On a morning clear as the light reflected on the lake, the Mistress of Many Waters was moved by that pained plea.<br>And so the kindly goddess granted her wish and gave her blessing to the journey ahead.<br>For the Mistress of Many Waters knew that a fair judgment was the greatest leniency one could give a selfless soul.<br>And perhaps that is why that noble verdict dyed fate in its colors."|title=Dawn and Dusk by the Lake: Splendor of Tranquil Waters}}
