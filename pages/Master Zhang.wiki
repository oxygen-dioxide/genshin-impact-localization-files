{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Master Zhang:''' Need to buy a weapon? Or have on custom-built? Repairs are free, just let me know if you come across any prize ore.
:{{DIcon|Forging}} I'd like something made.
:;(If nothing has been forged)
:::'''Master Zhang:''' Have you brought the right materials? Let's see the goods.
:;(If something has been forged but not collected yet)
:::'''Master Zhang:''' Oh, your order from last time is ready. Are you here to collect it, or to place a new order?
:{{DIcon|!}} About Liyue's mining products...
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Master Zhang knows; Version 1)
:::'''Master Zhang:''' Liyue is the dominion of Rex Lapis himself. Our ores could never disappoint.
:::'''Master Zhang:''' Fortunately, I've built up quite the network while helping people repair their equipment free of charge. They furnish me with information concerning ores from time to time.
:::'''Master Zhang:''' They've found quite a fair bit of abnormal Crystal Ore lately. Some call them Magical Crystal Ores &mdash; ordinary Crystal Ores can't hold a candle to them in either form or quality.
:::'''Master Zhang:''' It's a shame that they are so hard to work with. Even I cannot make heads or tails of them...
:::'''Master Zhang:''' If you can find a way to work with these ores, do come and find me.
:::'''Master Zhang:''' I've marked the location of those ore veins on your map. Poke your nose around those parts, and you'll turn up something for sure.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Master Zhang knows; Version 2)
:::'''Master Zhang:''' Liyue is the dominion of Rex Lapis himself. Our ores could never disappoint.
:::'''Master Zhang:''' Fortunately, I've built up quite the network while helping people repair their equipment free of charge. They furnish me with information concerning ores from time to time.
:::'''Master Zhang:''' Recently, they've come across a lot of Crystal Ore. It's just a shame that I've been busy. If you've got the time, go mine some, come back here and have them refined.
:::'''Master Zhang:''' I've marked the location of those ore veins on your map. Poke your nose around those parts, and you'll turn up something for sure.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Master Zhang knows)
:::'''Master Zhang:''' Ores... You've been to the many ore veins nearby, haven't you?
:::'''Master Zhang:''' I don't have anything new for you now. Perhaps you should try your luck later.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} What are you selling?
::'''Master Zhang:''' Quality weapons made from the finest ore using time-honored techniques. Take your pick.
:{{DIcon}} About Hanfeng's Ironmongers...
::'''Master Zhang:''' My dad left me this place when he retired. He lives in Qingce Village now.
::'''Master Zhang:''' When he left me the shop, he also left me with a word of advice &mdash; a solid business is founded on solid relationships.
::'''Master Zhang:''' Whenever I get laborers and miners coming in here for repairs, I never charge them for it. In return, I only ask that they keep me informed when they find any rare ore.
::'''Master Zhang:''' It's every ironmonger's dream to fashion a legendary weapon, the sharpest blade of them all... Liyue is the land of the Lord of Geo, so I figure this is where I'll have the best chance of finding the prize ore I'd need...
::'''Master Zhang:''' If I can get the edge over the competition right from the source, from the raw materials, I can push them out and really strengthen the Hanfeng name... Hehehe, so let me know if you find anything!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Master Zhang:''' Bye. Come back if ever need anything.
