==Trivia==
* This quest series contains multiple references to ''{{w|Alice's Adventures in Wonderland}}'' and ''{{w|Through the Looking-Glass}}'' by {{w|Lewis Carroll}}:
** Ann(e) is clearly intended to be representative of Alice, as evidenced by the title of the achievement received upon completing the series, [[Ann in Wonderland]].
** The player encounters multiple creatures who often argue and talk nonsensically.
** Act II is called ''Kingdom Through the Looking-Glass''.
** During the {{Quest|Ann's Story}}, the player ends up in a location which seems to loop endlessly (though careful observation or the end of the quest shows that it does not). Likewise, Alice encounters situations that are seemingly physically impossible.
** The player obtains [[Jabberwock's Holy Sword]], a reference to the Vorpal Blade from ''{{w|Jabberwocky}}'', a poem included in ''Through the Looking-Glass''.
** The player is tasked with slaying a dragon, while in ''Jabberwocky'', a character kills the eponymous beast, which is described very much like a dragon, and looks like one in the accompanying illustration.
