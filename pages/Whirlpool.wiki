'''Whirlpools''' are vortexes found on top of [[water]] that can [[Vacuum Field|suck]] in players and the [[Waverider]], inflicting harmful effects.

While within a whirlpool:
* Characters not in a Waverider lose '''100''' [[Stamina]] every '''0.2''' seconds.
* Waveriders lose '''15''' Stamina every second.
* Waveriders [[Health/HP Loss|lose HP]] every second. The HP loss is calculated as '''20%''' Waverider Max HP + '''150'''.

There is one Whirlpool variant that acts as a loading zone into an underground cavern (found in the [[Minacious Isle#Underwater Ruins|Minacious Isle]]). This variant is marked by 4 mist bubbles popping in the direction of the whirlpool.
