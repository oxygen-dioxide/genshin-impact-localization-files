'''Whirlpools''' are vortexes found on top of [[water]] that can [[Vacuum Field|suck]] in players and the [[Waverider]], inflicting harmful effects.

While within a whirlpool:
* Characters and Waveriders lose [[Stamina]] continuously.
* Waveriders [[Health/HP Loss|lose HP]] every second. The HP loss is calculated as '''20%''' Waverider Max HP + '''150'''.

There is one Whirlpool variant that acts as a loading zone into an underground cavern (found in the [[Minacious Isle/1.6#Underwater Ruins|Minacious Isle]]). This variant is marked by 4 mist bubbles popping in the direction of the whirlpool.
