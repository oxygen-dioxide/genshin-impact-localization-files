===A Chance meeting===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Lynette)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Is that... Lynette? With a little kitty?)
:'''???:''' Meow~
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Meow.
:'''???:''' Meow~
:{{DIcon}} What are you up to?
:{{DIcon}} (Approach stealthily...)
::'''???:''' Meow!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Wha...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Oh, it's you. One second &mdash; now activating chat mode...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' You made me jump there. I thought they'd finally caught me.
:{{DIcon}} Made you jump? Barely. I didn't notice.
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 05.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Well, my heart rate did. Jumped up a little, I mean.
::{{DIcon}} ...So uh, what kind of trouble are you in, exactly?
:{{DIcon}} Is someone out to kidnap you?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 06.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Objectively speaking, the trouble is entirely of my own making.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 07.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Half an hour ago, I was at Hotel Debord for a drinks reception &mdash; it was to celebrate the successful opening of a show, but it was draining my energy... So, I waited for the right moment, then snuck away so I could switch to standby mode.
:{{DIcon}} I see... So they sent someone to find you and bring you back? But why?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 08.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Um... Probably because I'm playing the lead role in the show.
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} The lead role!?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 09.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Is that so surprising? I'm always getting invitations to do solo performances... I just usually get Lyney to write back and turn them down. But then came the Fontinalia Film Festival...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 10.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' We took all the kids from the House of the Hearth out to see a film, and after it finished, they all started clamoring for me to try out acting for some reason. Even Lyney was chanting along with them.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 11.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Anyway, it just so happened that a director called Merieux had sent me an invitation right around then... I'll spare you the details, but basically, I ended up accepting it.
:{{DIcon}} So this is the dramatic debut of the magician's puppet, huh...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 12.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Yup, you nailed it. I'm playing the role of a puppet.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 13.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' In fact, the show's called The Lost Puppet, and it's a masked mime show. So I don't have to do any facial expressions, or say any lines &mdash; literally just a series of physical movements. The director says it's a very "avant-garde" art form.
:{{DIcon}} That does sound pretty avant-garde... But can people understand the plot?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 14.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Art is not comprehended by the mind, but felt in the heart... At least, that's what the director says. Anyway, if nothing else, the opening performance seemed to go down well.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 15.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' At the drinks reception, everyone was crowding around me saying... "triumphant character portrayal," "faithful adaptation of the original work," "unequivocally, quintessentially avant-garde"... and stuff like that.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 16.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...But being the center of attention is draining. So the moment they left me to go harass the director instead, I was out of there.
:{{DIcon}} (For once, you weren't able to use Lyney as a human shield...)
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 17.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' The other thing is... Some weird things happened while I was on the stage...
:'''???:''' Meow!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 18.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Oh... Sorry, Bonnie, I didn't mean to leave you out of the conversation. My bad.
:{{DIcon}} I take it Bonnie's your pet cat?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 19.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' No, we just met. We bumped into each other right after I slipped away.
:{{DIcon}} ...And you've already named her!?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 20.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Well, it'd be kind of difficult for us to communicate otherwise... Besides, I think she's taken a liking to the name. Haven't you, Bonnie?
:'''Bonnie:''' Meow!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 21.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Yeah, that's right, good kitty. We'll go find your owner soon, I promise.
:{{DIcon}} Owner? Not a stray cat, then?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 22.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Nope &mdash; she's wearing a collar, and for the most part she's pretty well-groomed. If she is a stray, she hasn't been for long.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 23.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Her stomach's been growling a lot... I guess she must've been missing for a few days now. As much as I'd love to hang out with her for a while longer, her owner's probably worried sick about her... assuming she has an owner, that is.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 24.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Ugh, but the reception... I should probably show my face there again at some point, even if it's just to make excuses and leave again... Ugh, decision time...
:'''Bonnie:''' Meow...
:{{DIcon}} Is this a tough decision for you?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 25.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Well... I just find it exhausting, thinking through all the different ramifications of difference choices and so on &mdash; that's more Lyney's area than mine. So, unless it's something really important, I usually just leave the decision-making to him.
:{{DIcon}} But for once, he's not here when you need him... Bet that doesn't happen often.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 26.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' It's fine. He got Freminet to make me a little something for just this situation:
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 27.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Poof &mdash; a [["Fateometer"|"Fateometer."]]
:{{DIcon}} ...What's this?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 28.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' It looks pretty over-the-top, I know, but it's essentially just a box of cards... He kept the design simple so it'd be harder to break.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 29.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' The way it works is: I pick a card at random, then look at the number on the card.
:{{DIcon}} And how does that help you make a decision?
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 30.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Well, for example... If the number on the card is 5 or higher, I help Bonnie find her owner. If it's less than 5, I go back to the reception.
:{{DIcon}} Simple and straightforward!
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918002 lynette 31.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I just have to believe in the bond between me and my cards, and my fate will reveal itself to me in numerical form... at least that's what Lyney said. Anyway, I guess I'll give you a demonstration.
:'''Bonnie:''' Meow!
{{Dialogue End}}

===A Decision===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{Black Screen|As Lynette attempts to draw a card, the device emits a horrendous grinding sound...}}
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Huh, it didn't like that... Was I using it wrong? Hmm. Maybe if I just...
:{{Black Screen|Lynette smacks the card box, all the cards fall onto the ground... Then, she picks one at random.}}
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Clearly, there's some design flaws to iron out. I'll have to let Freminet know.
:{{DIcon}} I feel like maybe this wasn't a design issue...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Let's see, which card did I get...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...4.
:{{DIcon}} Less than 5... So that means, no helping Bonnie...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 05.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Well... The cards fell on the ground though, so I don't think it counts as fate.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 06.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' If you wanna get the right answer, you have to let fate decide... Also something Lyney said.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 07.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' So to put it another way, if picking a card up off the ground is how to NOT leave it to fate... then that means, it must be the wrong answer!
:{{DIcon}} (I think what Lyney really meant is, sometimes you have to accept the answer you didn't want...)
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 08.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Um... Or... Why don't you pick a card? Since I ran into you here, that means, uh... our fates are, like... interfering with each other...
:{{DIcon}} You should leave the razzle-dazzling to Lyney...
:{{DIcon}} Alright, I'll pick another card for you...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 09.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Thank you... This one is final, I promise...
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 10.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Here, take the fateometer. If it's 5 or above, that means "fate successfully changed," anything lower than 5 is a fail.
:{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 11.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Also... If you have your own thoughts about what I should do, feel free to share it. Now that I've got a good problem-solver here to help, I don't need to run every little thing by fate...
:{{Hangout Branch|I think you should head back to the drinks reception...|Mask}}
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 31.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Huh... Back to the drinks reception...
::{{DIcon}} I mean... clearly you don't want to go... You could just&mdash;
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 35.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Nope, I said it was your decision. I'm not gonna waste any more energy dragging my feet.
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 36.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Besides, the drinks reception is technically part of the job as an official publicity event. So if I bail on it...
::{{DIcon}} You'll feel guilty inside?
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 37.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...I might get sued for breach of contract, and that would be a huge pain in the butt.
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 38.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' One other thing... Do you wanna come with me? If you're free, I mean.
::{{DIcon}} Sure. Then you'll have at least one friend there.
::{{DIcon}} Hopefully that will make it more bearable?
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 39.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Mm-hmm. Thanks.
::;(Continues to [[Mask]])
:{{Hangout Branch|I think you should help Bonnie...|Detectives}}
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 26.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...So we're looking for Bonnie's owner?
::'''Bonnie:''' Meow!
::{{DIcon}} So, how do you plan to find Bonnie's owner?
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 30.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Umm... I think I'll go to The Steambird and see about putting an ad in the paper. You wanna come along? ...I think Bonnie wants you to come with.
::'''Bonnie:''' Meow...
::{{DIcon}} Sure, if it means I get to hang out with you for a bit longer.
::'''Bonnie:''' Meow, meow~!
::;(Continues to [[Detectives]])
:{{Hangout Branch|[Fateometer] I'm not sure... Let's leave this one to fate.|customlinks=[[Mask]] or [[Detectives]]|DIcon=TCG}}
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 24.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Alright... Then let's see where fate will lead me.
::{{Hangout Branch|''(If the card drawn is equal or less than 5)''|Mask|DIcon=}}
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 31.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Huh... Back to the drinks reception...
:::{{DIcon}} I have to ask about this deck of cards...
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 33.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' There's twenty cards in total, numbered 1 to 20. So there's only a one-in-five chance of drawing less than a 5.
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 34.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I should also mention &mdash; this time the cutoff was 5, but I just set that to whatever I feel like.
:::{{DIcon}} I mean... clearly you don't want to go... You could just&mdash;
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 35.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Nope, I said it was your decision. I'm not gonna waste any more energy dragging my feet.

:::{{DIcon}} Wow, you REALLY don't want to go back to that reception party...
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 29.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' To put it in perspective, I said I'd only do the show if I drew a 1... Fate can be pretty sneaky sometimes.
:::'''Bonnie:''' Meow!
:::{{DIcon}} So, how do you plan to find Bonnie's owner?
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 30.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Umm... I think I'll go to The Steambird and see about putting an ad in the paper. You wanna come along? ...I think Bonnie wants you to come with.

::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 12.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Huh?
::{{DIcon}} If it was that urgent, someone would have come looking by now.
::{{DIcon}} That applies both to your troupe, and to Bonnie's owner.
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 13.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' What you're saying is... since nobody's come looking... I can just keep hanging out with Bonnie for a bit longer?
::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 14.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Is that really okay...?
::'''Bonnie:''' Meow!
::{{DIcon|TCG}} [Persuasion] Well, Bonnie sure seems to like that idea!

:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 15.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Hmmmmm... Maybe not... As much as I don't want to, I really should be getting back...
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 16.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Besides, if someone does come looking for me or Bonnie, and finds me just chilling out with a cat... I feel like I'd have a lot of explaining to do.
:::'''Bonnie:''' Meow...
:::;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
::{{Hangout Branch|''(If the card drawn is grater than 10)''|#Ending: "Standby Mode"|Ending: "Standby Mode"|DIcon=}}
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 17.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' You make a good point!
:::{{DIcon}} We can just stick around here for a while...
:::{{DIcon}} So if anyone does come looking for you, they'll find you.
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 18.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Okay, well... Assuming Bonnie hasn't strayed too far from where she went missing, there's a chance we might bump into her owner in either The Steambird offices or the restaurant...
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 19.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...So, stick around here in standby mode? Yeah, that suits me.
:::{{DIcon}} If you're going into standby mode...
:::{{DIcon}} Shall we find some cat food?
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 20.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Oh, good idea! Bonnie's definitely hungry.
:::{{DIcon}} If we're getting cat food...
:::{{DIcon}} Shall we get some snacks for us, too?
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 21.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' May as well, we could be here a while.
:::{{DIcon}} Well, since we've got cat food and snacks...
:::{{DIcon}} Let's find a place to chill.
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 22.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...When I was trying to find somewhere I could space out earlier... Uh, I mean, collect my thoughts &mdash; I figured the cafe might be a good shot.
:::'''Bonnie:''' Meow!
:::{{A|vo lntcop001 1918001 lynette 23.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Alright then. Plan of action: Spend the whole day spacing out&mdash; I mean, in standby mode.
