'''"If you put your heart into it..."''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Wonders of the World]]''. To complete this achievement, the player needs to fail the cooking mini-game and produce a Suspicious-quality dish.

==Notes==
* Failing the mini-game but receiving a character's [[Food#List of Special Dishes|special dish]] instead of a Suspicious-quality dish will still count.
* Suspicious dishes produced by cooking talents that produce suspicious dishes, such as Hu Tao's [[The More the Merrier]] or Kamisato Ayato's [[Kamisato Art: Daily Cooking]], do not count.

==Trivia==
*When read together with the Chinese name of [["...Anyone can be a gourmet."]], the Chinese name of this achievement forms a quote from the 1996 Hong Kong film {{w|The God of Cookery}} ({{Lang|mini=1|zh=食神|zh_rm=Shí Shén|zh_lit=Food God}}).
