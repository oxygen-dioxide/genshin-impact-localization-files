{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yves:''' I can't make a living using a rented divesuit forever... *sigh*
:{{DIcon}} Hello there.
::'''Yves:''' Hello, hello. Ah, apologies for making you see me complaining like this.
::'''Yves:''' As you can see, I'm a diver &mdash; and apart from working for my boss, I also do a few jobs on the side.
::'''Yves:''' If you need anything salvaged, you can come to me &mdash; we can discuss the payment afterward.
::'''Yves:''' I'll do my best to help you... so long as my diving equipment remains functional, and I can finish the work assigned to me by my boss.
::{{DIcon}} It sounds like you're the one who needs help, really.
::'''Yves:''' To be honest, I think I've accepted that my work simply cannot be finished.
::'''Yves:''' After all, that [[Goldman]] &mdash; that is, my boss &mdash; is one of those... "calculative" people.
::'''Yves:''' That's how I often find myself here, busy dealing with divesuits that could possibly stop working, or something like that...
::'''Yves:''' Not to mention the stuff deep underwater, and those waterweeds and detritus that seem to think my job is far too easy...
::'''Yves:''' Oh, I've started complaining again, haven't eye? Sorry about that. Anyway, thanks for your concern.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry for bothering you, then.
::'''Yves:''' No worries. Just come to me if you've got things that need salvaging.
