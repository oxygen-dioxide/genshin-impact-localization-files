|description    = A tall, spacious hut. It is said to have been first designed by researchers to help them camp out in the rainforest for a long time while performing research or cultivation, before then spreading to all parts of [[Sumeru]]. The huts are large enough to accommodate more than one person, with plenty of room for furniture, research equipment, and sample storage.<br />The tents are also a welcome respite for [[Forest Rangers]] trying to maintain order. Because the residents often have long-term plans and distinct organizational divisions, there are very few accidents and they do not disturb the rainforest too much. A wooden sign is sometimes hung at the door to welcome visitors.
