A long, bright, transparent rod created by a poet from Mondstadt. To help borrow the power of Anemo to help raise the rod, the poet rather ingeniously designed a fishing reel made from the leaves of [[Windwheel Aster]]s, which also imparts a certain romanticism of "lingering in the wind" to this device. But perhaps there were issues in the handiwork or in the design itself, for the finalized product could not spin as freely as expected. Perhaps this is what they call "the chasm between professions?"

==Trivia==
*Considering Mondstadt is primarily inspired by Germany, the Chinese name of the rod {{Lang|Wind-Tangle|zh=风缠|zh_rm=Fēngchán}} may be a word play on {{Lang|Storm-Charge|zh=狂飙突进|zh_rm=Kuángbiāo Tūjìn}}, a Chinese translation for {{w|Sturm und Drang}} ("Storm and Stress"), a proto-Romantic movement in German literature during the late 18th century.
