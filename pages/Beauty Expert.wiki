:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This shop looks popular today... Wonder what the occasion is?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... "Butterfly Dew cosmetics, now on sale"... Huh, looks like it.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Sigewinne's here too?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey there, Sigewinne!
:{{DIcon}} What are the chances.
:{{DIcon}} It's been a while.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 sigewinne 01.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Hello there, {{Traveler}} and Paimon. I hope you're keeping yourselves fit and healthy?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You bet we are! So anyway, what are you doing here, Sigewinne?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 sigewinne 02.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' The Duke insists I take regular vacations in the Court of Fontaine.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 sigewinne 03.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' This one just so happened to coincide with a promotion for a new skincare product, so I came over to take a look. I like to keep up with the latest industry developments when I can, to help me with my magazine articles.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, you write for a magazine? Which one?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 sigewinne 04.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' It's called "[[Beautes en fleurs]]," and it's run by the [[Fontaine Beauty Association]]. I've done lots of articles about skincare for them, using the pen name "Romaritime Flower."
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, wow! You're "Romaritime Flower"!? If Paimon's not mistaken, you're one of the leading figures in the Fontaine Beauty Association...
:{{DIcon}} Since when did you start reading beauty mags?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Wh&mdash;What's so weird about that? Everyone loves beauty.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 sigewinne 05.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' I really like this role. The staff at cosmetics shops are always so polite, and as long as I wear a big smile on my face, I always get the best customer service.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, they sure don't wanna make an enemy of THE Romaritime Flower...
:{{DIcon}} So what got you interested in beauty products, Sigewinne?
:{{DIcon}} How'd you become a leader in the Beauty Association?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Obviously, it's because of Sigewinne's love for beauty. Still, a leader of the Beauty Association... that's incredible...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 sigewinne 06.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' The truth is, I study this field because I cherish my own appearance. It has nothing to do with being beautiful or not.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh... The words of a master beautician defy comprehension... Oh, wait! You're saying that natural beauty is the highest form of beauty, right?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 sigewinne 07.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Not really... Actually, Melusine aesthetics are very different from human ones. We don't view humans based on their appearance.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 sigewinne 08.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' If I had to describe our approach, I'd say it's based on... "cuteness."
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... Really?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 sigewinne 09.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Yep. Still, I really value my current appearance, and in the process of taking care of it, I've ended up learning quite a lot about skincare and stuff.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 sigewinne 10.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Turns out my knowledge and experience is pretty popular with beauty product lovers. It came as a big surprise to me though.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon gets it now. But speaking of your appearance... How come you look human, anyway? Are you, like, only half-Melusine?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, sorry, sorry! That was probably really offensive, wasn't it...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 sigewinne 11.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' No, I don't mind &mdash; I'm not mixed, though. I made a decision to turn myself into this form, a very long time ago...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 sigewinne 12.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' If you're curious, I could tell you the story.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A shape-shifting story!? Heck yeah, Paimon's interested! You must be too, right, {{Traveler}}?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 sigewinne 13.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Once upon a time...
:{{Color|menu|Sigewinne tells you a tale of a time long past. In the story, a little Melusine doctor wants to cure her ill friend, but the humans who held Melusines in contempt refused to allow it. After drinking a magical potion she got from a witch, and becoming more human-like, she was finally able to help her friend. Nevertheless, after her friend's condition improved, the Melusine chose to leave in silence.}}
;(A cinematic plays)
::'''Sigewinne:''' Long ago, humans rejected Melusines, and Melusines feared humans
::'''Sigewinne:''' There was one Melusine who became fascinated with human medicine
::'''Sigewinne:''' But no human wanted her help
::'''Sigewinne:''' And there was one girl who liked Melusines
::'''Sigewinne:''' So no humans would make friends with her
::'''Sigewinne:''' So, the Melusine became the girl's friend
::'''Sigewinne:''' And the girl became the Melusine's "patient"
::'''"The Melusine":''' Your checkup's all done. You're still in perfect health
::'''Girl:''' Thank you, Doctor Melusine!
::'''Sigewinne:''' In this game of doctor and patient, a friendship was born
::'''Sigewinne:''' Then one day, the girl fell ill
::'''Sigewinne:''' The Melusine was the only doctor to arrive on time
::'''Sigewinne:''' But the adults sent her away
::'''Father:''' Scram! Melusines can't be trusted!
::'''"The Melusine":''' So just because I'm not human... I can't save my best friend?
::'''Sigewinne:''' In desperation, the Melusine approached the frightening witch
::'''Sigewinne:''' She begged, and begged, until she got a reply
::'''Witch:''' If you take this potion, concocted of sin
::'''Witch:''' You will gain a human face and grow human limbs
::'''Witch:''' But then, you will lose everything that attracted this friend of yours to you in the first place
::'''Witch:''' Can you accept that?
::'''Sigewinne:''' The Melusine did not hesitate for very long
::'''Sigewinne:''' On a rainy night, a little doctor knocked on the girl's door
::'''Sigewinne:''' The doctor wore a hood and raincoat
::'''Sigewinne:''' Maybe to protect her from the rain... but maybe also to hide a secret
::'''Sigewinne:''' The little doctor held the girl's hand and treated her illness
::'''Sigewinne:''' Just as she had so many times before
::'''Sigewinne:''' Dawn came, and the little girl's condition improved
::'''Sigewinne:''' But the litte doctor was long gone
::'''Sigewinne:''' For she knew her friend would never recognize her again

:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 sigewinne 14.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' ...And so, since then, I've lived my life in human form. Most people who know me just think I was born this way.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A witch... a potion... Why does this sound like a fairy tale?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 sigewinne 15.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Trust me, it's a true story.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Must be the way you told it then... It just sounds so... huh.
:{{DIcon}} You're an incredibly kind person, Sigewinne.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah... Not every Melusine would take human form to save their human friend... That must've been a huge decision.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 sigewinne 16.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Treating patients is a doctor's duty. We must always find a way, even when the going gets tough.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, it's so crazy that they turned you away just because you were a Melusine. Especially when their daughter was so sick...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 sigewinne 17.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Well... Sometimes, appearance can be a real barrier. But that was a long time ago. I like how I look now, anyway.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon too! You're super cute this way!
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 calcagni 01.ogg}} '''Calcagni:''' Attention customers! Thank you all for waiting. Now, on behalf of our skincare partner, I'm delighted to announce that our exciting new product is now officially on sale!
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 sigewinne 18.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Well, there we go! Let's have a look, shall we? Paimon, if you wanna buy any skincare products, I'll be happy to give you some suggestions.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Personal advice, right from a leader of the Fontaine Beauty Association? What an honor!
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 calcagni 02.ogg}} '''Calcagni:''' Allow me to introduce our newest skin lotion, Butterfly Dew. I'm sure many of you have already read about this product's trials in the newspapers.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 calcagni 03.ogg}} '''Calcagni:''' To say that it improves skin quality is an understatement. This product gets its name from the way it transforms your skin and makes it glow anew, like a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis and spreading its wings for the first time.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 calcagni 04.ogg}} '''Calcagni:''' We are thrilled to have the inventor of this fantastic product with us here today &mdash; please welcome Mr. Rawat, a researcher from the Fontaine Research Institute. Now, without further ado, I'll hand over to Mr. Rawat to tell you all about what Butterfly Dew can do for you!
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 rawat 01.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' Thank you. Hello everyone, I'm Rawat, and I developed Butterfly Dew.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 istress 01.ogg}} '''Istress:''' Wow, what a looker!
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 aurillac 01.ogg}} '''Aurillac:''' He's a researcher? Wow, he's really challenging the stereotype...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 rawat 02.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' Haha, it seems that everyone is surprised by my entrance &mdash; or should I say, my appearance?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 rawat 03.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' I'm well aware that researchers are generally better known for their brains than their dashing good looks... In that regard, I do believe I break the mold somewhat.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 rawat 04.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' Of course, appearance is a skin-deep way of defining a person. And yet, one's appearance can be a very real set of shackles, holding a person back in their life.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 rawat 05.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' It can rob a young person of their self-confidence when applying for a job, dissuade a young lady from approaching the one she loves... Our actions are at the mercy of our appearance, and we slowly become the very person that the outside world sees us as.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 rawat 06.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' But what if I told you that those shackles can be broken?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 rawat 07.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' If our appearance prevents us from changing, then let us first change our appearance itself!
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 rawat 08.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' Wash away moles, birthmarks, and wrinkles, and they can no longer rob us of our confidence. Replace them with luster and radiance, and we shall never again hang our heads in shame.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 rawat 09.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' That is why Butterfly Dew exists. Its mission is to allow us to shed our pupae, undergo a complete metamorphosis, and embrace a new life!
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 24.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, whether it actually works or not &mdash; after that speech, Paimon's already sold!
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 istress 02.ogg}} '''Istress:''' Mr. Rawat, could I ask if you've used this product yourself?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 rawat 10.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' Of course. I tried it many times while I was testing it &mdash; you can consider me a product ambassador.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 25.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, then it's sure to work!
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 rawat 11.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' Still, I don't expect to convince you just by blowing my own trumpet. So could I get a volunteer from the audience to try it out?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 26.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon volunteers!
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 rawat 12.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' Hmm... Oh?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 rawat 13.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' Ah, what an honor. It appears we have a giant of the Fontaine Beauty Association here with us... In that case, Miss Sigewinne, could we seek your most expert opinion on this product?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 sigewinne 19.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Ummm... Sure.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 istress 03.ogg}} '''Istress:''' Is that "Romaritime Flower"? They say she's the pickiest user of skincare products in all of Fontaine...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 rawat 14.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' Here you go.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 sigewinne 20.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Hmm... It's very kind to the skin, and the absorption rate is high... Even for Fontaine, this is a first-rate product.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 27.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, now that's high praise!
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 crowd 01.ogg}} '''Customers:''' I'll take one! Me, too! Do we get discounts?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 rawat 15.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' Alright, well all that remains for me to say is: Butterfly Dew is now on sale!
:{{Black Screen|The enthusiastic shopping spree rapidly decimates the stocks.}}
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 28.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Think we should buy a bottle too?
:{{DIcon}} Nah, you're cute enough already.
::{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 29a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, really? ...Well, it's still good to care for your skin though, right? Paimon definitely feels kinda rough from being exposed to the elements all the time...
:{{DIcon}} Are you paying for it yourself?
::{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 29b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmph, of course you'd bring up Mora... Fine, Paimon'll pay out of her own pocket, and even share it with you. There, does that sound fair?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 1 paimon 30.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And if you're worried about whether it's the right product for you &mdash; well, luckily for us, Sigewinne's here! So we can get an expert consultation.

;(Talk to Rawat and Sigewinne)
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 rawat 01.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' It's an honor to receive such high praise from you. To be honest, I was also hoping you might be able to point out some flaws in the product so I can keep improving it.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 sigewinne 01.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' With most skincare products, the pros and cons only become apparent with long-term use.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 sigewinne 02.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Yet this one has instant benefits, improving skin quality without any obvious side-effects. It's one of a kind.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 sigewinne 03.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Don't worry, though. I plan to keep using it, and I'll publish regular reviews in "Beautes en fleurs" &mdash; you can read my thoughts there. All you need to do is subscribe.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 rawat 02.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' Oh... I was hoping for a more casual conversation, but you are a Beauty Association leader, after all. I understand if you want to keep this professional.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 paimon 01a.ogg}} {{A|vo sgwlq001 2 paimon 01b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sigewinne! Ahem... Excuse us, Miss Beauty Expert, but do you think this product is a good choice for me and {{MC|m=him|f=her}}?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 rawat 03.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' Hmm? Wait. Are you the renowned {{Traveler}}?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 paimon 02a.ogg}} {{A|vo sgwlq001 2 paimon 02b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's right &mdash; and by {{MC|m=his|f=her}} side, the equally famous Paimon!
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 rawat 04.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' Haha... Well, I don't normally handle customer questions personally, but since it's {{Traveler}} asking, allow me to make an exception.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 rawat 05.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' Butterfly Dew is made for all skin types, so no matter who you are, you can rest assured that it will be kind to your skin. If anything, it might be marginally more effective on Fontainian skin, but other than that, it works the same on everyone.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why would it work better on Fontainians?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 rawat 06.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' Um... In the interests of protecting my trade secrets, I'm afraid I can't answer that, Miss Paimon.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh, alright then. How about a friend discount?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 rawat 07a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 rawat 07b.ogg}}--> '''Rawat:''' Save yourself the trouble &mdash; I'd be greatly honored to have both of you use my product. Here, take two bottles, for free.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yay! Paimon's private fund survives!
:{{DIcon}} What's the catch? Is this a publicity stunt?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 rawat 08.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' Haha, I can see why you might think that. But please don't misunderstand &mdash; this gift is simply a token of my esteem. There's no business motivation behind it.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 rawat 09.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' To me, finding new customers for Butterfly Dew is about meeting kindred spirits &mdash; fellow admirers of physical beauty. I consider it a labor of love.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Admirers of physical beauty... Yeesh, that's embarrassing to say out loud. It sounds so shallow...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 rawat 10.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' It's nothing to be ashamed of, Miss Paimon. Most people claim to desire inner virtue, but it is still physical appearance that turns their heads.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 rawat 11.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' This is a fact of life. It's only natural for people to desire to become beautiful, and that's exactly what inspired me to choose this research direction in the first place.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're right! Everyone loves beauty, don't they?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 rawat 12.ogg}} '''Rawat:''' Ah, look at the time... My apologies, but I have other things to attend to. I'll leave you with these two bottles of Butterfly Dew, and I look forward to seeing you again.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 sigewinne 04.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Paimon, I'd say there's no need for you and {{Traveler}} to use this product for now.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Why, is there a problem with it?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 sigewinne 05.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' The quality is fine, I just think there's room for improvement. I think I could add some ingredients to the mix to make it more effective.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Then... Why didn't you tell Rawat about that?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 sigewinne 06.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Researchers are a very special breed of human.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 sigewinne 07.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' You can point out their flaws to their face, and they won't mind very much. But if you tell them that someone else could do a better job... Now that'll make them really upset.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 sigewinne 08.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' If I'd mentioned it, he probably wouldn't have given you those two bottles for free.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, fair enough, that makes sense...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 sigewinne 09.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' If you're interested in the more effective version, I can write up a list of ingredients for you. Just come get me once you've gathered them.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' When you say more effective... You mean, it'll make Paimon even prettier? Ooh, {{Traveler}}, how could we say no!
:{{DIcon}} A prettier Paimon?
:{{DIcon}} Well, if you really want this...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 sigewinne 10.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' As for me, it's probably time I got back to the Fortress of Meropide. I mustn't leave the infirmary unattended for too long.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, see you there, then!

:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 wriothesley 01.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Ah, it's you two. Indeed it has. I would offer you some tea, but I'm afraid the timing is unfortunate &mdash; duty calls.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No worries, actually, we were looking for Sigewinne. Do you, uh... know what all this is about?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 wriothesley 02.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' This inmate came running to guards in a panic, claiming to have seen his exact doppelganger.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A doppelganger? Doesn't that just mean someone else kinda looks like him?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 wriothesley 03.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' That's what I thought when the report first reached my desk. But we've inspected our records. No one even vaguely resembles him.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 wriothesley 04.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Considering how certain he is of what he saw, I can only surmise that he's having some mental issues. So I brought him for a medical evaluation.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 sigewinne 04.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Alright, very good. Take a sip of water and rest for a bit.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 sigewinne 05.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Evaluation complete. I couldn't find any symptoms pointing to a physical condition.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 wriothesley 05.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I see. So, do you still believe there's more likely to be an issue with his mind than his body?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 sigewinne 06.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' I have to assume so for now. Psychological issues are more difficult to detect. At this stage, we can at least confirm that he is in command of his cognitive faculties.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 wriothesley 06.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' The rumor mill will go crazy if word of this gets out... Guards, take him to the ward for a period of observation.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 wriothesley 07.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' The Marechaussee Phantom has requested my cooperation on a case, otherwise I'd deal with this myself. Sorry for the trouble, Head Nurse, but I'll have to leave this to you.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 sigewinne 07.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' No problem, Your Grace. I'll add him to my observation list.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 wriothesley 08a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 wriothesley 08b.ogg}}--> '''Wriothesley:''' By the way, we have a couple of guests here who've made the trip just to see you. I imagine it must be important. You probably won't need to add them to your observation list, though.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 sigewinne 08.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Oh! {{Traveler}}, Paimon. It's you!
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey there, Sigewinne! It's actually not THAT important, but...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 wriothesley 09.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I'll be in my office if you desperately need me. Goodbye for now.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, bye-bye!
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, so, Sigewinne...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 sigewinne 09.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Would you mind waiting for just a moment? I have another patient to see. Just find an empty bed and take a seat, I won't be long.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, sure.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 odilon 01.ogg}} '''Odilon:''' Sigewinne, we've brought him &mdash; and he seems to have taken a turn for the worse again.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 sigewinne 10.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Okay, don't panic. Let's start by sitting him down here.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon had no idea how busy it can get for Sigewinne... Maybe now's not the time to ask for her help with skincare...
:{{DIcon}} Patience, Paimon. She'll help us, we just need to wait.
:{{DIcon}} In the meantime, we could offer to help Sigewinne.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good point... Besides, it might actually be interesting to observe her at work.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 sigewinne 11.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' This could hurt, so I suggest you take a deep breath first.
:{{Color|menu|You see the face revealed by Potton, but are shocked by his appearance...}}
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aah!
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did his... face melt!? What happened to him?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 odilon 02.ogg}} '''Odilon:''' It's anyone's guess... His face melted off shortly after arriving at the Fortress, but since he's a serious offender, he can't be allowed out for medical treatment. Best we can do for now is ask the head nurse to give him something to manage the symptoms.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 odilon 03.ogg}} '''Odilon:''' This is gonna be awkward... We still need to bring him to the Marechaussee Phantom for questioning. What if he scares them half to death? Will that be our fault?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Marechaussee Phantom? Does this have something to do with the case Wriothesley's dealing with?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 odilon 04.ogg}} '''Odilon:''' Yep. It was a huge case. They bagged a few dozen crooks in one fell swoop &mdash; and this guy's the baddest apple of the bunch. He harmed countless people... And now it looks like it's all finally catching up with him.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 potton 01.ogg}} '''Potton:''' You done gawking?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 sigewinne 12.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Not yet. I need to check the severity of your ulcers to decide the right dosage.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 potton 02.ogg}} '''Potton:''' ...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 sigewinne 13.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Don't worry, we Melusines have a very different sense of aesthetics from humans. To me, you just look like a little kitty with slightly scruffy fur, but still just as cute.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 potton 03.ogg}} '''Potton:''' Don't patronize me! Do I look like a kid to you? Just gimme the meds and lemme out of here, I already miss my cell.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 odilon 05.ogg}} '''Odilon:''' Hey, lose the attitude! You dare talk back to our head nurse like that again, your days are numbered!
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 sigewinne 14.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' It's fine. Okay, I'm going to apply the medication now. Tell me if it hurts, alright?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look how nice Sigewinne's being! And still he talks to her like that. What a nasty piece of work.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 potton 04.ogg}} '''Potton:''' Can I leave now?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 sigewinne 15.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Wow, not a peep. What a brave little guy.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 odilon 06.ogg}} '''Odilon:''' Thank you, Sigewinne. And I apologize for the trouble.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 sigewinne 16.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' So, {{Traveler}}, Paimon &mdash; did you bring the ingredients?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... We did, but we don't wanna interfere or anything... You're busy saving lives here...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 sigewinne 17.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Oh, don't be silly. I agreed to it, didn't I? Just hand me the ingredients, and I'll make some time to whip it into the improved version for you.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 sigewinne 18.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Take a rest here if you want. Or, if you're not tired, I hear they're holding a new pankration tournament in the Administrative Area.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... Or alternatively, is there anything we could we help you with, Sigewinne?
:{{DIcon}} Take it as a token of our gratitude.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's right! Let us help you out. It's the least we can do!
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 sigewinne 19.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Hmm, good point... Kind-hearted humans start to develop "guilt" if they accept free help from others...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 sigewinne 20.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Don't worry, I'll take a look at my schedule &mdash; I'm sure I can find something to treat this condition.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 3 sigewinne 21.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' I gotta warn you though, it'll be tiring work. So I suggest that you take a break first, then come back and see me when you're ready.

:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 01.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' I found the perfect job for {{Traveler}}. First, I'd like you to lie down in this bed.
:{{Color|menu|Following instructions, you lie down on the hospital bed beside you.}}
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What for?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 02.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' I need you to pretend to be sick.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...What?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 03.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Is it that difficult? I thought you did a pretty good job [[Into the Deepwater Murk|last time...]]
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohh, so you knew?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 04a.ogg}} {{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 04b.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' I sure did. {{MC|m=He|f=She}} was way more interesting than the usual malingering inmates, and you played along very well, Paimon. I observed you two for quite a while after that.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well this is awkward... But why do you need us to do it again now?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 05.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' No time to explain &mdash; my next patient will be here any second. Please, just do as I say. You can, uh... pretend like you've got a nasty headache. And throw in some dry heaving for good measure.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oookay...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 luc 01.ogg}} '''Luc:''' *cough* ...Hey Doc, it's me. I'm only here 'cause my mom won't stop pestering me about it &mdash; ugh, so annoying...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 06.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Your mother has enough on her plate with a busy job. The last thing she needs is to worry about you being sick as well.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 luc 02.ogg}} '''Luc:''' I know, I know... I shouldn't treat the place like a playground, shouldn't go swimming in the lower levels where we join up with the sea, 'cause it'll give me a cold and distract her from her work...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 luc 03.ogg}} '''Luc:''' I thought I'd be able to have some fun here at the Fortress for a few days, but it's always "don't do this" and "don't do that."
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 07.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Alright, sit yourself down, and I'll take your temperature. Hmm... Your fever still hasn't gone down. Well, here's your medicine. One cup for starters, and we'll see if it helps.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 luc 04.ogg}} '''Luc:''' But Doc, it's so bitter! Do I really have to drink it? I mean, I'll be fine, right? I've got an uncle who caught a cold &mdash; his fever went away on its own after a couple days.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 luc 05.ogg}} '''Luc:''' Can't you just write me a note saying I'm on the mend? I just need something to keep my mom off my case.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 08.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Hmm... I sure can. You're a very brave boy, after all.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 luc 06.ogg}} '''Luc:''' Huh? Brave? What makes you say that?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 09a.ogg}} {{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 09b.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Well, if you want to rely on your own immune system to fix your fever, then you'll have to tough it out like this {{MC|m=guy|f=young lady}}.

:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 10.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' As long as you're tough enough to get through the nausea and dizziness caused by the high fever, you'll be right as rain after just a few days' rest.

:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, hey, wake up! Wake up!
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 11.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' ...Put it this way &mdash; at least you'll never have to see the doctor again, right?

:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 14.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' His mother's a guard here. She's been working back-to-back shifts lately, but unfortunately his father's away on a business trip right now. She had no choice but to bring her son here for the time being.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 15.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' He was quite happy at first. He seemed to think that the Fortress of Meropide would be all fun and games.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you made us put on that act just to scare a kid into taking his medicine? That's a pretty sneaky trick. Seems like there's a whole side to Sigewinne we never knew about...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 16.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' It's a technique I learned from my teacher.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, you had a teacher? Was she a Melusine doctor too?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 17.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' She was human. She passed away a long time ago.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... Sorry...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 18.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' It's fine. I really liked my teacher, so it's always nice when I get to talk about her with other people.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 19.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' She was a traveling doctor. Since she didn't have a clinic, she'd go out and visit her patients wherever they were. Dealing with the badly behaved ones was her specialty.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 20.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' She used to say... Ahem, "If you can scare the little brats into taking their medicine, you won't have to hear them wailing and screeching when their condition gets worse."
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh. She sounds like a pretty strict teacher.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 21.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Strict? That's not how my teacher saw it. She thought of herself as "terrifying to kids."
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Strange way for a doctor to describe themselves... Now Paimon's curious to know what she looked like.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 22.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' As it happens, I actually have a picture of her.

:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 23.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Yep. All the children she treated thought she was a witch.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why does it almost sound like you're... envious of her...?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 24.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Oh, because I am! If she was here, all the children would take their medicine without any need for tricks.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A doctor who looks like a witch... True, they wouldn't dare to try anything funny with her around.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 25.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Me, on the other hand... It's hopeless &mdash; children aren't afraid of me at all.

:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 28.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Oh, there is one last thing. I have to keep it confidential, so I usually leave it till after everyone's clocked out.

:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 29.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' It's fine. You're not living here anymore, so it's okay if you know. All it is, is I have to prepare some ingredients to make healthy meals with.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 paimon 24.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, you mean... THOSE healthy meals?
:{{DIcon}} The ones that magically appear on the third day?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 30.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' My patients refuse to eat any healthy meals I prepare in front of them. So, I have to prep the ingredients in secret, then let the chef at the Coupon Cafeteria handle the rest.

:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 31.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' You wanna find out? I can teach you how to make it. That way, if you ever suffer from exhaustion on your future travels, you can prepare a healthy meal for yourself. It's really good for you, y'know!

:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 32.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' The ingredients are ready. Now, put them on the table, and add them in the order I tell you.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 33.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' First we add this special Slime Condensate. Stir thoroughly, then pour it in. See that? It adds elasticity. Looks just like tasty jelly, doesn't it?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 paimon 27.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, it really does! ...Until you remember it's Slime Condensate.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 34.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Next up, Xenochromatic Crystals. You wanna crush them up into a fine powder &mdash; like powdered sugar.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 paimon 28.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, are those from Fontemer Aberrants? Are you sure they're edible?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 35.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Finally, we'll need some high-protein meat. Frogs are an excellent choice. You just need to clean their innards, and then you're left with some lovely, tender meat!

:{{A|vo sgwlq001 4 sigewinne 36.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Mm-hmm. And we're done. All that's left now is to pack them into lunchboxes and hand them to Wolsey.

:{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 enri 02.ogg}} '''Erick:''' After giving it some thought, I'm sure that I was probably just seeing things. Stress-related, I imagine. I'd been working long hours, so I definitely wasn't in the best state of mind.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 sigewinne 01.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' I totally understand. Still, I have to give you an examination before I can discharge you, okay? So take a deep breath, and don't be nervous. It'll be the exact same procedure as we did this morning. We can start whenever you're ready.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 enri 03.ogg}} '''Erick:''' Uhh... Again, so sorry &mdash; I was in such a state this morning, I barely recall anything... Would you mind taking me through it again?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 sigewinne 02.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Not at all, it's a lot to remember. First up, we have a little cognitive test. Just concentrate, and you'll be fine. To start with &mdash; which finger am I holding up?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 enri 04.ogg}} '''Erick:''' Your pinky.
:{{Black Screen|Under Sigewinne's guidance, Erick quickly completes the full series of tests.}}
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 sigewinne 03.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Alright, all indicators seem normal.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So it was a stress-induced hallucination after all?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 sigewinne 04.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Well, we've certainly had previous cases of mental illness caused by overwork, which is why I carefully observe everyone in the production zone. I wonder how I managed to miss the signs this time...?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 enri 05.ogg}} '''Erick:''' Please, Head Nurse, you shouldn't blame yourself! I'm just still adapting, that's all. Pushed myself too hard and I guess I couldn't take it.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 enri 06.ogg}} '''Erick:''' Thanks for looking after me. I'll be as good as new after a good night's sleep, and if you can give me the okay, I know I'll sleep better back in my good old dorm...
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 sigewinne 05.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' It can be difficult to relax in an unfamiliar environment... Alright then, you can leave the ward.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 sigewinne 06.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' I suggest you take two days off to focus on your recovery. I'll take you off the observation list for now, so you're officially discharged.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 enri 07.ogg}} '''Erick:''' Great. I can't thank you enough, Head Nurse.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 sigewinne 07.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Mr. Odilon, could you escort him back?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 lazare 01.ogg}} '''Odilon:''' Of course. I'm on guard duty in the Administrative Area tonight, so nothing will go wrong. You have my word.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess you're finally done for the day now, huh?
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 sigewinne 08.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Yep... Ah, but I still haven't gotten around to making that improved lotion for you yet.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No rush! Seriously, it's super late now. You should go get some rest too!
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 sigewinne 09.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Tomorrow it is, then. Good night, {{Traveler}}. Good night, Paimon. Hope you sleep well.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 paimon 04a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 paimon 04b.ogg}}--> '''Paimon:''' Oh, don't you worry, we will! After a productive day of work, we're both gonna sleep like a log!
:{{DIcon}} Good night, Sigewinne.
:{{A|vo sgwlq001 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, sleep tight, Sigewinne! See ya tomorrow!
