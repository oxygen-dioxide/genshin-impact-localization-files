==Trivia ==
* In English, Fischl often uses German for her titles and names. Oz, when playing along, uses a few German phrases himself.
** "Prinzessin der Verurteilung" means "Princess of Condemnation."
** "Immernachtreich" means "Kingdom of Eternal Night."{{Verify}}
** "Edelstein der Dunkelheit," which she uses to refer to her Vision, means "Gem of Darkness."
** "Mein Fräulein" means "my lady."
** "Mitternachtsbrot des Sommernachtgartens" means "Midnight Bread of the Summer Night Garden."
* While her Story makes it rather clear that Fischl is not from a world beyond Teyvat, she seems to possess some knowledge that others don't. Unlike many other characters, she acknowledges that the Traveler is from another world, apparently without having been told.
