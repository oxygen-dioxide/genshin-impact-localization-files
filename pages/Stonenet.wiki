|description    = A tall arbor whose leaves glimmer evergreen under the midday sun. The distribution of the leaves is most unique, seeming like two groups of open nets. It is said that many years ago, when the [[Raiden Shogun]] strode across the land destroying all manner of wicked creatures, even the thunder that arced off her from time to time was enough to utterly destroy evil. The samurai held in reserve would often rest under such trees, and these "leafy nets" would block all manner of leftover chunks and giblets for them.
