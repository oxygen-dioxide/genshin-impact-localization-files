==Trivia==
* According to Kama, his name means "a very big rock" in the Ishine Script.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna}}</ref>
** This may be related to the {{w|Ainu language|Ainu}} word {{Lang|"kama"|ain=カマ|ain_rm=kama}}, which means "flat rock."
** "Kama" can also mean "stepping across" or "crossing over" in Ainu, indicating his role as ferryman.
* He is the descendant of Tsurumi Island's Kama family. His [["Kama"|ancestor]] left Tsurumi Island to follow [[Kanna Kapatcir]]'s light to seek new lands.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Particularly Particular Author}}</ref>
