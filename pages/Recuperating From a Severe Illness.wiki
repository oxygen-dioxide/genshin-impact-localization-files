{{Quest Description|As [[Anna]] has been recovering from her illness, she's finally started playing all around the city again. However, [[Anthony]] can't seem to find her anywhere...}}
===Windmill Version===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Anthony:''' How did this happen...
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
:'''Anthony:''' Oh, it's you. Just in time, too. Anna's been getting better ever since eating the medicine prescribed by that [[Baizhu|doctor]].
:'''Anthony:''' When she wasn't well, she needed a lot of rest, and so spent a lot of time convalescing at home.
:'''Anthony:''' Now that she's better, she's started pestering me every day to go out at play, and I couldn't refuse her.
:'''Anthony:''' But now, I absolutely cannot find her. I have no idea where she's gone. Please help me find her!
:{{DIcon}} I... Alright.
::'''Anthony:''' I'll be waiting here. Please hurry.
::'''Anthony:''' She just got better, and now she's scampering about. What will we do if something happens to her...?
:{{DIcon}} You seem quite happy about it.
::'''Anthony:''' Happy? This is no laughing matter. She's only gotten a little better, and now she's flying about like a kite!
::'''Anthony:''' When she gets back, I'll give her what for.
:{{DIcon}} She'll come back once she gets hungry.
::'''Anthony:''' Are you taking my sister for some sort of cat? And she's only just recovered. How can we let her go hungry?
::'''Anthony:''' Alright, alright. Please help me find her, I'll be waiting for you here.
:'''Anthony:''' I've already been searching for quite a while. I haven't looked in the vicinity of the [[Adventurers' Guild]] yet, but I'm just beat at this point...
:'''Anthony:''' You should start your search over there. Who knows, maybe Cyrus has noticed something...
:'''Anthony:''' I hope you find her, or I'll have to go out again...

;(Talk to Anthony again)
:'''Anthony:''' Once I find Anna, I'll have to teach her a lesson.

;(If you talk to Cyrus)
:'''Cyrus:''' Oh? You're here? That's unusual.
:{{DIcon}} Have you seen a certain girl?
:'''Cyrus:''' A girl? Oh, you mean Anna? I did see her. She was heading for that windmill over there.
:'''Cyrus:''' I'm still quite puzzled by it, myself. I thought she was unwell. Where did she suddenly get all that energy from?
:'''Cyrus:''' She greeted me and just ran by.
:'''Cyrus:''' That kid... Do you have any idea when she recovered from her illness?

;(Talk to Cyrus again)
:'''Cyrus:''' It seems like that kid has recovered from her illness.

;(Talk to Anna after finding her)
:'''Anna:''' I'm so high up! My brother will never find me here!
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here...
;(If you spoke with Cyrus)
::'''Anna:''' Whoa! How'd you get up here, and without a sound, too!
::'''Anna:''' Also, how did you even find me?
::'''Anna:''' Ah, I know. Mr. Cyrus must have told you.
::'''Anna:''' He's always taken care of my brother and I, and I greeted him as I was passing by. He looked so surprised, too!
::'''Anna:''' Maybe I should try out for the Adventurers' Guild and become an Adventurer. That might be nice!
::'''Anna:''' What? My brother's looking for me? Huh. It's been some time, hasn't it? I hadn't noticed at all!
::'''Anna:''' I got it. Just let me stay here for a while, I'll go back myself.
;(If you didn't speak with Cyrus)
::'''Anna:''' Wah! How'd you get up here, and without a sound, too!
::'''Anna:''' No, wait. How did you even find me?
::'''Anna:''' Me? I just climbed up here.
::'''Anna:''' My brother's looking for me? Huh. It's been some time, hasn't it? I hadn't noticed.
::'''Anna:''' I got it. I'll go back soon. Just let me stay here for a while...

;(Talk to Anna again)
:'''Anna:''' The wind feels great here. I'd love to see how it feels in some faraway place.

;(Talk to Anthony)
:'''Anthony:''' Have you found Anna yet?
:{{DIcon}} She's on top of a windmill.
;(If you spoke with Cyrus)
::'''Anthony:''' A windmill!? How did that girl get up there? I'm going up there right now...
::'''Anthony:''' What? She wants to try becoming an adventurer?
::'''Anthony:''' She's getting ahead of herself, she hasn't even fully recovered yet!
::'''Anthony:''' Don't get me wrong. Once she's well, I don't have any problems with her going out to see the world.
::'''Anthony:''' Thanks, I'll go look for her. Running off like that when she's only just recovered... I have to teach her a lesson.
;(If you didn't speak with Cyrus)
::'''Anthony:''' A windmill!? How did that girl get up there? I'm calling the Knights of Favonius right now!
::{{DIcon}} She said she'll be back soon.
::'''Anthony:''' O&mdash;Oh. Is that so? Well, she's fine, and that's what matters. You scared me there for a moment! I thought she was stuck on top of a windmill.
::'''Anthony:''' Thank you, I'll go look for her now.
::'''Anthony:''' Running off like that when she's only just recovered... I have to teach her a lesson.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Cathedral Version===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Anthony)
:'''Anthony:''' Oh, where has Anna gone this time...
:{{DIcon}} Can't find Anna again?
:'''Anthony:''' Yes. I've searched all over the city for her, but no luck.
:'''Anthony:''' Please help me look for her. I'm so tired, I can barely move...
:{{DIcon}} Gotcha.
::'''Anthony:''' It's up to you, then. This girl... If she keeps running around like this when she's almost well, I might fall sick myself.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe she's gone off to be an adventurer.
::'''Anthony:''' That can't be. It can't be... Can it?
::'''Anthony:''' H&mdash;Hey, won't you say something?
:'''Anthony:''' Hang on... Anna did once say that she's wanted to go to the Cathedral and thank the sisters there.
:'''Anthony:''' Perhaps you should check the Cathedral first. You can also check in with Albert...
:'''Anthony:''' He often, uh, hangs around the Cathedral. Who knows, maybe he's noticed something.

;(Talk to Anthony again)
:'''Anthony:''' If she keeps this up, I'm going to fall sick myself.

;(If you talk to Albert)
:'''Albert:''' This kid's really nimble...
:{{DIcon}} Excuse me, have you seen a girl...
:'''Albert:''' You mean Anna? I've seen her, she just ran past me and disappeared down that corner.
:'''Albert:''' Still, the Anna I remember has always been ill, and would sometimes come to the Cathedral to be healed.
:'''Albert:''' But she doesn't look sick at all. Why, I'd wager that she's got more energy than I do. What happened, I wonder?

;(Talk to Albert again)
:'''Albert:''' Anna's recovery is a good thing, in the end. Her brother can breathe easier now.

;(Talk to Anna after finding her)
:'''Anna:''' Wow, the sisters really are alert. They almost discovered me.
:{{DIcon}} You're an agile one...
:'''Anna:''' Wah! How did you know I'd be here? Even the sisters didn't spot me.
:;(If you spoke with Albert)
::'''Anna:''' You say Albert told you about me? Huh. Who's Albert...
::'''Anna:''' Ah, I remember now. He's that man who always hangs around the Cathedral.
::'''Anna:''' I don't know what he's there for. But I don't think he's a bad person.
:'''Anna:''' Well, since you've found me, I guess I'll head back now.
:'''Anna:''' I just wanted to enjoy the scenery, so don't worry about me.

;(Talk to Anna again)
:'''Anna:''' If I became a sister, I'd be able to help lots of people, wouldn't I...

;(Talk to Anthony)
;(If you spoke with Albert)
::'''Anthony:''' Have you found Anna?
;(If you didn't speak with Albert)
::'''Anthony:''' Did you find Anna?
:{{DIcon}} She's on the roof of the Cathedral.
:'''Anthony:''' The Cathedral roof? All those sisters, and not one of them spotted her?
:'''Anthony:''' How did she manage that? Maybe she really does have talent for being an Adventurer...
;(If you spoke with Albert)
::'''Anthony:''' What? It was thanks to a tip from Albert? Haha, Albert...
::'''Anthony:''' He's something, he is. No matter how many times the sisters warn him, he can always be found loitering around the Cathedral for no good reason.
::'''Anthony:''' Well, I'll go get Anna to come down. We shouldn't bother the sisters. Right, and I also need to give Albert my thanks.
::'''Anthony:''' Thanks for your help. Please take these as a token of my thanks.
;(If you didn't speak with Albert)
::'''Anthony:''' I'll go get her to come down. We really shouldn't be bothering the sisters.
::'''Anthony:''' Thanks for your help. Please take these as a token of my thanks.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Anemo Archon Statue Version===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Anthony)
:'''Anthony:''' Oh, that girl, where has she run off to this time...
:{{DIcon}} Anna's gone out to play again?
:'''Anthony:''' Really, how can you be so unperturbed?
:'''Anthony:''' Anna's become less and less obedient. I turn around for one second, and she just slips away.
:'''Anthony:''' She hasn't fully recovered yet! Please help me find her.
:{{DIcon}} Alright.
:: '''Anthony:''' Thank you.
:{{DIcon}} Have you looked around?
::'''Anthony:''' Of course. I even searched outside the city!
::'''Anthony:''' But still, no luck. So I could only turn to you.
:{{DIcon}} What does she like to eat?
:: '''Anthony:''' Well, she's fond of... Hey! Haven't I told you to stop treating her like a cat?
:: '''Anthony:''' In any case, she loves all sorts of food, more than I can count.
:: '''Anthony:''' Okay, I'm counting on you to look for her. I'll be waiting for you here. I'm so tired, I feel like I could collapse...
:'''Anthony:''' Ah, right. Anna always told me that she wanted to see the statue of the Anemo Archon.
:'''Anthony:''' I remember that Sister Grace goes there often.
:'''Anthony:''' You could go ask her first. Maybe she's noticed something...

;(Talk to Anthony again)
:'''Anthony:''' Where's Anna gone this time? How did I not see before that she could be this much of a handful?

;(Talk to Grace)
:'''Grace:''' Hasn't this child always been ill? So how...
:{{DIcon}} Have you seen a certain girl...
:'''Grace:''' Ha... You must be referring to Anna. Look up &mdash; she's in the hands of the Anemo Archon statue.
:'''Grace:''' Honestly, I was quite stunned when she ran past me. I mean, she's been ill all this time, so where did she get this much energy from?
:'''Grace:''' By the time I recovered, she'd already gone all the way up to the Anemo Archon statue's hands.
:{{DIcon}} You're... not angry?
:'''Grace:''' Angry? Well, I was a little angry. But that child has always been tormented by her sickness...
:'''Grace:''' Seeing her healthy like this... How do I say this? I just can't get angry.
:'''Grace:''' That said, the wind is very strong up there. I hope she doesn't catch a cold...

;(Talk to Grace again)
:'''Grace:''' The wind is very strong up here. I hope that child doesn't catch a cold...

;(Talk to Anna)
:'''Anna:''' So you really can see all of Mondstadt from up here...
:{{DIcon}} Don't catch a cold, now.
;(If you spoke to Grace)
::'''Anna:''' Wah! You gave me a scare. Where did you pop out from, and how did you find me?
::'''Anna:''' I was so sure no one would find me here...
::'''Anna:''' Ah, right. Sister Grace must have told you where I am. She's always around here.
::'''Anna:''' A lot of the medicine I've taken in the past were sent over by her.
::'''Anna:''' Sister Grace is a wonderful person... But I don't want to stay in Mondstadt forever.
::'''Anna:''' Alright, I know my brother's looking for me. I'll head back soon, so he doesn't worry.
;(If you didn't speak to Grace)
::'''Anna:''' Wah! You gave me a fright, where'd you come from?
::'''Anna:''' I bet my brother's looking for me again. Haha, I knew he wouldn't find me here.
::'''Anna:''' I know, I know. I get it, I'll go back in a while. I won't make him worry.

;(Talk to Anna again)
:'''Anna:''' If I had a wind glider, I'd try flying from up here, just to see how it feels.

;(Talk to Anthony)
;(If you spoke to Grace)
::'''Anthony:''' Have you managed to find Anna?
::{{DIcon}} She's on the Anemo Archon statue's hand.
::'''Anthony:''' The&mdash;The Anemo Archon statue's hand? How did she even get up there?
::'''Anthony:''' Ah, we've made trouble for Sister Grace again. I mean, we always do, but...
;(If you didn't speak to Grace)
::'''Anthony:''' Have you found Anna already?
::{{DIcon}} She's on the Anemo Archon statue's hand.
::'''Anthony:''' The&mdash;The Anemo Archon statue's hand? How did she even get up there?
:'''Anthony:''' I'll head there immediately, get her to come down, and scold her a bit.
:'''Anthony:''' My thanks. Please, take these.
