'''Blizzard Strayer''', also called '''Icebreaker''' in the [[Adventurer Handbook]], is an [[Artifact Set]] available at [[:Category:4-Star Artifacts|4-star]] and [[:Category:5-Star Artifacts|5-star]] rarities which can be obtained from [[Peak of Vindagnyr]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* A 4{{star}} Broken Rime's Echo can be obtained by speaking to [[Stevens]].
* The 4-Piece set bonus cannot be snapshotted. The CRIT Rate increase is directly applied to hits.
* The 4-Piece set bonus does not apply on the hit that applies Frozen.
* Hits that remove the Cryo/Freeze aura by triggering a reaction will still benefit from the CRIT Rate bonus.
* Targets must be immobilized by the [[Frozen]] reaction in order to count as "being Frozen" for the 4-Piece set bonus. Hitting targets affected by other forms of [[Cryo#Frozen|Frozen auras]] (e.g., [[Cryo Abyss Mage]] shields) will grant only 20% CRIT Rate (for the target being "affected by Cryo") rather than the full  40%.
* Although the 4-piece bonus description says "a character," the bonus only applies to the wearer of the artifact set, not to other characters.

==Trivia==
*This artifact set is about [[Imunlaukr]] and the civilization of [[Sal Vindagnyr]].
