==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Sekkura:''' Workload has been lighter with more [[Dusk Bird|dusk birds]], but now that I need to take care of them, I also don't get to go home as often.
:{{DIcon}} Dusk birds...?
::'''Sekkura:''' Dusk birds are usually used to carry messages. They're essential for my job as a Swallow Messenger.
::'''Sekkura:''' While they've cut down on the need for me to run errands, I now spend a lot more time in town.
::'''Sekkura:''' My home is Aaru Village, which is a small settlement on the desert edge.
::'''Sekkura:''' How I long to visit Aaru Village again... It feels like an eternity since I saw [[Candace]]. We've got a lot to catch up on.
::'''Sekkura:''' Such as life in the city, stories about the rainforest, and Parchamdar [[Rukh Shah]]...
::{{DIcon}} About Rukh Shah...
::'''Sekkura:''' Rukh Shah is not only dependable, he's the youngest Parchamdar in Corps history!
::'''Sekkura:''' Supposedly he's from the rainforest, not the desert.
::'''Sekkura:''' You know how rare rainforest people are in the ranks of the Eremites, much less a Parchamdar.
::'''Sekkura:''' He's very impressive, getting along not only with the desert dwellers, but [[Akademiya]] researchers too.
::'''Sekkura:''' Maybe there's truth to the rumor that he was once a researcher himself.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Sekkura:''' See you.
