==Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Triple Tornadoes:''' Summons 3 small tornadoes that move in random directions, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DMG}} to players that come in contact. The tornadoes will persist after the Samachurl is defeated.
*'''Vacuum Trap:''' Creates a [[Vacuum Field]] at the player's location that sucks them towards the center but does not deal DMG.
*'''Smack:''' If the player is within melee range, swings its staff at the player, dealing '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} and knocking the player back. The Samachurl also falls in the process due to the staff's weight.
*'''Enhancement:''' Certain enhanced Anemo Samachurls can be found in certain [[Domains]], [[Spiral Abyss]], overworld events and challenges. There are 2 possible types of enhancements: Attack and Vacuum.
**'''Attack Enhancement:''' While using '''Triple Tornadoes''', the center tornado of the three becomes larger.
**'''Vacuum Enhancement:''' While using '''Vacuum Trap''', a tornado will appear at the center of the vacuum, dealing {{Color|AoE Anemo DMG}}.
