==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You accept the Chief of the Masters of the Night-Wind's commission, and are determined to complete the task that you have been entrusted with...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Toltec)
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 1 toltec 01.ogg}} '''Toltec:''' I take it you're the ones appointed by Elder Tlapo?
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yup! And you are?
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 1 toltec 02.ogg}} '''Toltec:''' Call me Toltec. The chief asked me to be your guide for the day. His messengers already filled me in on the situation. So just follow me!

;(Approach the cave)
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So the dye is somewhere in this cave, huh?
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 toltec 01.ogg}} '''Toltec:''' This is as far as I can take you. Only the appointed ones may proceed from here.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why's that?
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 toltec 02.ogg}} '''Toltec:''' Kind of a long story. Apparently, there's a certain fruit that grows in this cave, the juice of which can be processed to make an excellent dye.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 toltec 03.ogg}} '''Toltec:''' Many years ago, our ancestors set out to make a series of ambitious works of graffiti art. They selected this cave to make them in, presumably due to the availability of the dye.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 toltec 04.ogg}} '''Toltec:''' However, they didn't want anyone to see their work before it was completed. And so, they sealed off the entrance to control access.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 toltec 05.ogg}} '''Toltec:''' To bypass the seal, you have to have mastered the art of color perception, or something like that.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh...<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "Oh, right..."</ref>
;(If the mural was completed beforehand)
::{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Haven't we been in here before, though?
::{{DIcon}} Yeah, but don't forget we're the chosen ones.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 toltec 06.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 toltec 14.ogg}}--> '''Toltec:''' The strange thing is, our ancestors never removed the seal even after they finished the graffiti art.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 toltec 07.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 toltec 15.ogg}}--> '''Toltec:''' Since it was sealed off, the only person who's been inside is the great shaman, [[Huitzilin]]. And that was two hundred years ago.<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "[...] And that was three hundred years ago."</ref>
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 toltec 08.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 toltec 16.ogg}}--> '''Toltec:''' According to her, the artwork tells the story of a hero by the name of [[Kuntur]]...
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 toltec 09.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 toltec 17.ogg}}--> '''Toltec:''' ...But I digress. Sorry, I'm a big fan of graffiti artwork, once I get talking I can go on for hours.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 paimon 05.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 paimon 08.ogg}}--> '''Paimon:''' So you're sure you don't wanna come with us?
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 toltec 10.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 toltec 18.ogg}}--> '''Toltec:''' I'll pass. I tried to get in once, but the seal blocked my way. I tried getting my Iktomisaurus to clear it with its powers, but even that didn't work.<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "[...] getting my Iktomisaur to clear it [...]"</ref>
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 toltec 11.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 toltec 19.ogg}}--> '''Toltec:''' I guess it's supposed to be a test left there by our ancestors. If you don't pass the test, you're not worthy of viewing their works of art.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 paimon 06.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 paimon 09.ogg}}--> '''Paimon:''' Aw...
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 toltec 12.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 toltec 20.ogg}}--> '''Toltec:''' Don't worry about me though. I wouldn't be joining you this time, even if I was able to get in.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 toltec 13.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 toltec 21.ogg}}--> '''Toltec:''' Unlike our chief, I don't have the guts to challenge our traditions. This task is specifically appointed to someone by the [[Tlapo|Iktomisaur Elder]]. Who knows what bad things might happen if I got involved?
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 paimon 07.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo xtlllq002 2 paimon 10.ogg}}--> '''Paimon:''' Fair enough. Alright, we'll try not to take too long!

;(Talk to Toltec again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xtlllq002 toltec 01.ogg}} '''Toltec:''' You two head on in. I'll wait right here.

;(Hint shown if quest navigation is used)
::Try using the Iktomisaur's {{Color|tutorial|special Elemental Sight}} to eliminate obstacles.

;(Approach the barrier, if the barrier wasn't removed beforehand)
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like there's no way past... Maybe try the same thing as before?

;(After dispelling the barrier, if the barrier wasn't removed beforehand)
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, it worked! Let's head in and take a look!

;(Enter the cavern)
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo xtlllq002 4 paimon 05.ogg}}--> '''Paimon:''' This should be the place! That fruit Toltec mentioned should be the one on the wall, right?
;(If the mural was completed beforehand)
::{{A|vo xtlllq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon didn't notice it last time we were here.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 4 paimon 03.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo xtlllq002 4 paimon 06.ogg}}--> '''Paimon:''' Now the only question is, which ones do we pick?
:{{DIcon}} This is probably where my special ability the chief mentioned comes in.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 4 paimon 04.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo xtlllq002 4 paimon 07.ogg}}--> '''Paimon:''' Well, go ahead, try it out!

;(Hint shown if quest navigation is used)
::Try using the Iktomisaur's {{Color|tutorial|special Elemental Sight}} to search for the target object.

;(Look at the fruits on the ground using an Iktomisaur's elemental sight)
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You saw something, right? Whatever it was, grab it!

;(Interact with the three glowing fruits)
:;(Obtain {{Item|Dye Samples|x=3}})

;(After collecting the dye samples)
:;(If [[Kuntur's Pursuit]] was not completed)
:::{{A|vo xtlllq002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' These guys' ancestors made some real works of art here. But based on what we've seen so far, it seems like there should be more to the story.
:::{{A|vo xtlllq002 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you think maybe there's more artwork further inside? Seems kinda strange...
:::{{DIcon}} We can go take look if you want?
::::{{A|vo xtlllq002 5 paimon 03a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, no need &mdash; Paimon was just thinking aloud. Toltec's waiting for us, and we have a job to do, so maybe it's best if we head out now?
:::{{DIcon}} Maybe &mdash; but we have a job to do. We should focus on that.
::::{{A|vo xtlllq002 5 paimon 03b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, you're right. There's always next time.
:::{{A|vo xtlllq002 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's head back and meet up with Toltec!
:;(If [[Kuntur's Pursuit]] was completed)
:::{{A|vo xtlllq002 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Remember the last time we came here? We found all of the artwork throughout the cave. These guys' ancestors created a real masterpiece!
:::{{A|vo xtlllq002 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' They probably used the same stuff for their paint as we're using for the dye, right? Maybe we'll create a masterpiece of our own!
:::{{DIcon}} Then we'd better get started.
:::{{A|vo xtlllq002 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yup, let's head back and meet up with Toltec!

;(Talk to Toltec)
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're back! And we found the ingredients for the dye.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 6 toltec 01.ogg}} '''Toltec:''' Sounds like you made it through the seal then! Our Iktomisaur Elder was right about you.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 6 toltec 02.ogg}} '''Toltec:''' It's getting late. Follow me, I'll take us back.
----
;(Talk to Biram)
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 7 biram 01.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Toltec has updated me on your progress. Well done, I appreciate your efforts.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure thing! Here's the stuff for the dye.
:;(Submit {{Item|Dye Samples|x=3}})
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 7 biram 02.ogg}} '''Biram:''' I see... yes, this is certainly a very different substance from typical dyes... Okay, now let's try our hand at making some samples. The fabric is ready for testing.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Got it!
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 7 biram 03.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Please, follow me.<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "Please come with me."</ref>

;(Enter the [["Chamber of Weaving"]])
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 biram 01.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Take a look at this &mdash; it's a woven scroll made by one of our ancestors. This is the kind of thing we're trying to make.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh...<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "Ooh!"</ref>
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 biram 02.ogg}} '''Biram:''' The person depicted is the legendary shaman, Huitzilin. She lived two hundred years ago, and was once appointed by the Iktomisaur Elder like yourselves.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 biram 03.ogg}} '''Biram:''' She was especially skilled in the art of color manipulation, and of course completed her task with flying colors.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 biram 04.ogg}} '''Biram:''' This scroll is a record of her deeds, and was most likely the work of her own hand. The quality is simply breathtaking, even compared to other scrolls of this variety.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 biram 05.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Sadly, since she passed away, all of our Iktomisaur Elder's subsequent appointees have had to rely on the "gift from the spirits" to complete their work.
:{{DIcon}} But now, you're about to revive an older tradition.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 biram 06.ogg}} '''Biram:''' That's a good way of putting it. My only quibble with your phrasing would be, it's not just me, but "us."
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh! Now Paimon's getting excited.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 biram 07.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Bring out the samples.
:{{Black Screen|An assistant presents the samples for test-dyeing.}}
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 biram 08.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Now, as I mentioned, the dyeing process is a little complicated, but I am confident you will manage. Just make sure to follow my instructions carefully.
:{{DIcon}} Will do. Let's get started.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 biram 09.ogg}} '''Biram:''' The pattern has already been sketched out on the sample, so you just need to dye each block with the correct color. But you'll need to wait for the dye to fully soak in between each step to make sure the colors don't run.
:{{DIcon}} (Dye the fabric as instructed.)
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 biram 10.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Good.<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "Hahaha! Good!"</ref> The dye has taken to the fabric, and the pattern is crisp and clear. Next, apply all the remaining dye and we should see that elusive signature color emerge.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, final step!
:{{DIcon}} (Apply the remaining dye.)
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... Did it work? Paimon doesn't see it...
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 biram 11.ogg}} '''Biram:''' That color isn't showing up... The dyeing has failed.
:{{DIcon}} Did I mess up somehow?
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 biram 12.ogg}} '''Biram:''' No, your technique was flawless. You did everything exactly as instructed. It would have made no difference if I'd done it myself.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then what went wrong?
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 biram 13.ogg}} '''Biram:''' It could be the weaving technique, or maybe the dye has to be applied in a different way... Whatever the case, it looks like I have failed to get to the bottom of this mystery.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sorry... Paimon wishes we could do more to help.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 biram 14.ogg}} '''Biram:''' I am the one who should be apologizing. I made you do so much work, and it was for nothing.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 biram 15.ogg}} '''Biram:''' I will of course honor my commitment to compensate you for your trouble, but I do hope you won't give up on this task. I plan to keep investigating, and will be sure to keep you updated with any progress.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't worry, we're not quitters!
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon does have a question though... Um, this whole process of recording history on woven scrolls seems so complicated. Why don't you just write it down instead?
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You said yourself, you're all about change and reform. Well, this seems like a pretty good place to start, don't you think? Writing things down would be easier for everyone, and your records would be more detailed.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 biram 16.ogg}} '''Biram:''' ...I think you've perhaps misunderstood my philosophy, but that's okay. I can answer your question, but there's somewhere I need to show you first.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 8 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... sure.

;(Approach Biram near the teleport waypoint on top of [["Masters of the Night-Wind"]])
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 9 biram 01.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Look at this view. What do you think?
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's gorgeous!
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 9 biram 02.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Now, try looking a little further.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa... That graffiti...
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 9 biram 03.ogg}} '''Biram:''' In all the years since the founding of our tribe, those colors have been with us every step of the way.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 9 biram 04.ogg}} '''Biram:''' It is true that I seek to bring new life to this ancient tribe through change and reform. But I also understand there are certain foundational things that we cannot afford to throw away.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 9 biram 05.ogg}} '''Biram:''' The foremost of these is the way we record our history.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That makes sense.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 9 biram 06.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Since the very beginnings, our tribe has always sought to bring color to history, and I have a deep sense that this is one part of our heritage that we should not give up.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 9 biram 07.ogg}} '''Biram:''' So whatever it takes, I must find a way for us to continue producing our traditional woven scrolls.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're completely right. Paimon's sorry for what she said earlier. It was out of line...
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 9 biram 08.ogg}} '''Biram:''' It's quite alright. I'm just grateful you're able to understand where I'm coming from.
:{{DIcon}} We're committed to helping you solve this.
:{{A|vo xtlllq002 9 biram 09.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Then let us hope that when we next meet, we succeed in reviving this tradition.
