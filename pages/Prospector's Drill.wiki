==Description==
A handy tool that can drill into the ground and rocks with ease.<br>
It had a wide range of uses in prospecting and other operations.<br>
Even stonemasons and construction workers utilized its characteristics,<br>
To cut rocks and create preliminary shapes and structures.

Like the chainsaw once popular in the workshops and docks,<br>
It relied on traditional and inefficient fuel to run.<br>
At that time, when controllable [[Pneumousia]] annihilation reactions had not been developed,<br>
The primitive [[clockwork meka]] were hindered by suboptimal kinematics and dynamics,<br>
And were seen as nothing more than curiosities and indulgences,<br>
While manual labor remained a necessity.

The tool's long grip was a fuel storage compartment and should be treated with care.<br>
Even so, there were records of the drill being used in battle.

The tool's piercing and cutting power were unmatched.<br>
Since it could pierce through even rocks like a hot knife through butter,<br>
It made quick work out of penetrating through even softer materials.<br>
As society advanced, this type of tool gradually ceased to be used in public.<br>
And like some other tools, unauthorized possession of it also became prohibited by administrative order.
