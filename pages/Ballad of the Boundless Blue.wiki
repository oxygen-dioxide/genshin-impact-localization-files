==Description==
Between two shores, past and present,<br>
A sky stretches vast and boundless, a limitless realm of freedom.<br>
Flowers are rooted in the earth, yet they still yearn for the endless sky,<br>
And though they are without wings, they still seek to rise through the air...

Just as the fate of flowers is bound by the roots deep beneath the ground,<br>
The dandelions are destined to witness the heights and freedom of the sky.<br>
The endless azure empyrean is as if a dome that reflects the world beneath it,<br>
With white clouds above dotting the calm and peaceful sky.

Just as the tenacious dandelions and wild chrysanthemums,<br>
The people of the verdant ground will heed freedom's call.<br>
The tyranny of storms and bitter winter may have oppressed them,<br>
And the virtues they held may have become corrupt and gone astray,

But so long as the traditions of praising the skyward gales remain,<br>
And so long as this precious freedom continues to be celebrated from generation to generation,<br>
Then the people will ever soar to the sky like all the seeds of the dandelions,<br>
Leaning on their spirited souls to pursue a boundless and unshackled freedom.
