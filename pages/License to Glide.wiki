;(Talking to Amber)
:{{A|vo ablq002 2 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber''': Great, you're here! Did you have a good read-through of the gliding manual? Got all the rules down?
:{{DIcon}} I mean, I read it but...
:{{DIcon}} I can't say I really grasped the rules...
:{{A|vo ablq002 2 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber''': Sounds like it was a real drag. I would know, I've been there...
:{{A|vo ablq002 2 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber''': The gliding manual is super dry... I couldn't get into it at all. Don't tell Jean though...
:{{A|vo ablq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon''': Really? Hmm... Paimon thought there were some pretty cool stories in the gliding manual.
:{{A|vo ablq002 2 ambor 04.ogg}} '''Amber''': Cool stories? Oh, you must mean the example cases in the Appendix.
:{{A|vo ablq002 2 ambor 05.ogg}} '''Amber''': Some of them I like. My favorite one is about the illegal Anemo Slime take-off.
:{{A|vo ablq002 2 ambor 06.ogg}} '''Amber''': Apparently, if you pop an Anemo Slime and take off in the burst of wind, it shoots you up really, really high... I really wanna try it!
:{{A|vo ablq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon''': No, not that story. Paimon meant the one with the little bird who wanted to learn to fly.
:{{A|vo ablq002 2 ambor 07.ogg}} '''Amber''': Ah... What...?
:{{A|vo ablq002 2 ambor 08.ogg}} '''Amber''': Lemme take a look... Shoot, this is the storybook I used to read as a kid!
:{{A|vo ablq002 2 ambor 09.ogg}} '''Amber''': Oops, sorry! I put both books in the same pile and must have grabbed the wrong one when I was leaving.
:{{A|vo ablq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon''': How in the heck do you confuse a bedtime story with an instruction manual?
:{{A|vo ablq002 2 ambor 10.ogg}} '''Amber''': Ahh... This is so embarrassing...
:{{A|vo ablq002 2 ambor 11.ogg}} '''Amber''': It's because... Maybe deep down inside, that fairytale is the thing that truly taught me how to glide...
:{{A|vo ablq002 2 ambor 12.ogg}} '''Amber''': "What you lacked was not wind. It's courage that's allowed you to become the first flying birds of this world."
:{{A|vo ablq002 2 ambor 13.ogg}} '''Amber''': Reading that gave me the courage to glide, to become an Outrider, and to become the Gliding Champion of Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo ablq002 2 ambor 14.ogg}} '''Amber''': ...But anyway let's get back to the exam!
:{{A|vo ablq002 2 ambor 15.ogg}} '''Amber''': Don't be nervous, just glide like you're used to.
:{{A|vo ablq002 2 ambor 16.ogg}} '''Amber''': Okay then. You just need to follow the {{Color|buzzword|marked route}} to the finish.
:{{DIcon}} I'm ready.
----
;(Talking to Amber if you fail the course)
:{{A|vo ablq002 4 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' You gotta focus on your technique when you're gliding.
:{{A|vo ablq002 4 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' If you wanna try again, just let me know.
:{{DIcon}} Let's try this again.
::{{A|vo ablq002 4 ambor 03a.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Cool. You'll make it this time, I just know it!
:{{DIcon}} Let me get myself ready.
::{{A|vo ablq002 4 ambor 03b.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Sure. But you gotta be 100% ready to glide.
:;(Dialogue ends, talking to her again repeats this dialogue branch from the beginning.)

;(Talking to Amber after completing the course)
:{{A|vo ablq002 5 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber''': You nailed it! But it's no surprise, given the way you handle your glider in a storm.
:{{A|vo ablq002 5 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber''': The next part of the exam is in Mondstadt. See you there, don't keep me waiting!
:{{A|vo ablq002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon''': Alrighty then – you heard her. Back to the city! Let's not keep her waiting!
