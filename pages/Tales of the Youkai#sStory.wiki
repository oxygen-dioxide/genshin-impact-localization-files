|You write a story about a magical shield that can withstand attacks from all angles...<hr />Known for its ability to "withstand attacks from all angles," the magic shield had a short period of fame before never being used again.<br>The shield, which had worked painstakingly to learn this technique, was very sad and decided to find out what had happened.<br>The truth was that the shield would spin too fast when deflecting a blow, causing its hilichurl wielder to become dizzy and end up losing the fight.
|So defense that is too strong can also lead to defeat? It sounds different from adventure stories I've heard before...<br>{{Color|bp|Yuzu}}

|You write a story about a not-so-effective Great Kitsune...<hr />The good shield could not bear to see its owner hurt. After each fight, it promised that it would get stronger to protect its owner.<br>After honing its craft in battle after battle, the hilichurl was surprised to find that the shield it had in its hands was so strong that nothing else could compare with it.<br>Behind these results are the tireless efforts of the shield in overcoming its own limits...
|Is that why my claymore is getting heavier? I totally understand! It's not that I'm getting weaker, but that my weapon is getting stronger!<br>{{Color|bp|A Hard-Working Adventurer}}

|You write a story about getting up during winter time...<hr />You wake up and realize you're late, but you can't move because you're wrapped in a blanket.<br>It then gently whispers to you, "It's cold outside and work is tiring, but blankets are always warm and comfortable, so why don't you sleep a little more?"<br>The full attendance bonus is at stake! And thus, a battle to get out of bed on a winter morning begins!
|The blanket has a point. The next time I sleep in, that's what I'll tell the shrine maidens...<br>{{Color|bp|Sayu}}
