{{Location Intro|The '''Ruin Golem'''|description=<p>{{If Self|Ruin Golem (Desert of Hadramaveth)|It|[[Desert of Hadramaveth]]'s Ruin Golem}} is one of three known [[Ruin Golem]]s located in the Sumeru region, alongside the Ruin Golems at [[Devantaka Mountain]] and [[Valley of Dahri]].</p><!--

--><p>Unlike the other two Ruin Golems, this Ruin Golem is in far better structural and functional condition. Initially situated at [[Dunes of Steel]], it was still capable of traversal upon reactivation, and during the [[World Quest]] ''[[The Dirge of Bilqis]]'', the player relocates it to an area north of [[The Sands of Three Canals]], then finally Wounded Shin Valley.</p><!--

--><p>Upon sinking into the ground at Wounded Shin Valley, the Ruin Golem permanently loses all mobility and its ability to punch, though its eye cannon can still be operated freely like the Ruin Golem at Valley of Dahri.</p>}}

==Interactables==
The interactables only appear when the Ruin Golem is in its final location, after sinking into Wounded Shin Valley.

===Akademiya Emblem-Marked Contract===
The Akademiya Emblem-Marked Contract is located in front of the door leading into the right arm's auxiliary generator room.

====Text====
(A more recent advance payment contract for labor rendered. It seems to have something to do with a research study. Most of it is well-preserved, but the lower section has been stained a vivid dark brown...)<br>
In the name of the eternal oath of friendship between the [[Nabu Malikata|Queen of the Garden]] and the [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|Queen of the Rainforest]], Matriarch [[Babel|Babel Tanit]] chooses warriors [[Azariq]], Aksir... and others... salary... 0,000 Mora per day, to escort the researcher, Jazira Yassar, across the desert, to provide protection and all other possible conveniences for the inspection of ancient machinery...

Client: Jazira Yassar, [[Kshahrewar]] Dastur<br>
Signatory: Babel Tanit, Matriarch of the Tanit Tribe<br>
Contract Pay: 500,000 Mora, 100,000 advance salary and 50,000 as a confidentiality fee.

===An Abandoned Letter===
An Abandoned Letter is located on the floor of the east side-area of the left arm's auxiliary generator room.

====Text====
(Perhaps the one holding this pen had already lost all strength in their hands, for the words are messy and blurred, but you can still make out the following content...)<br>
...I believe this shall be my last lucid moment. My limbs are like ice, and I can feel the warmth in my veins seeping out from my ravaged form...<br>
...I often think lately about how future generations will tell my story. Will I be a sinner? Or a hero...<br>
...The situation here is dire, but I believe that our Marshal will find a way. I believe...<br>
We once fought bravely here, doing our best to prevent this inglorious war. I believe that when it is all over... we shall recover our past splendor...<br>
Glory evermore... to [[Khaenri'ah]]...

===Restored Blueprints of a Mechanical Behemoth's Power System===
Restored Blueprints of a Mechanical Behemoth's Power System is located in the control cabin directly left of the controls.

====Text====
(Azariq left this document in the control cabin. It seems to be a transcribed copy. The document has been cobbled together from writings done by many hands, so it is likely not the original...)<br>
...According to past documents, this machine can participate in combat even if some parts are damaged. There are also auxiliary control cabins apart from the main control area that allow for more precise operations...<br>
...Additionally, the energy relay system that lines and joins the various junctions and passages is a rather intricate design that builds upon this foundation. If necessary, damaged sections of the energy supply can be disconnected or discarded so that large-scale malfunctions may be avoided. With the main body functionally intact, all pre-existing directives can still be carried out...<br>
...According to previous records of investigations into the giant Ruin Machine on Devantaka Mountain, the layout of the energy circuits can be seen as such...<br>
(Below is a diagram that depicts a restoration of the giant machine's energy pathways. The notes at the side are very complicated, full of notes such as these...)<br>
...The control linkage between the main control cabin and the three or four auxiliary control cabins...<br>
...Foundational energy pathway experiment results...<br>
...There are studies on the arrangement of these lumps, which are used as energy sources at pathway junctions...<br>
...Aha, I've got it. It's quite elementary, really! I believe I've come to a rather perfect guess about the energy pathways and structures of this giant machine, but unfortunately, there isn't enough blank space on this diagram, so it can't go here.

===Zandik's Note===
Zandik's Note is located on a gear in the east side-area of the right arm's auxiliary generator room, requiring three [[Energy Block]]s to open.

(This seems to be a page from a research journal that wound up discarded by a [[Zandik|researcher]] for unknown reasons.)<br>
...As I thought, it seems that the components I found in the large cluster of mechanisms can be used for this "[[Gurabad]] Specimen"...<br>
...This golem's main weapon system has suffered less damage than that of the previous machine...<br>
...The dimensions and structure match previous records perfectly. Despite its size, its workmanship displays a high level of precision...<br>
...It seems like such golems were all designed without the implementation of gyroscopes, causing the interior structure to tilt constantly and simultaneously with the machine's movement. A piloting trial had to be suspended after half a minute due to severe physiological side effects caused by disrupted balance... I speculate that its pilot may have had to undergo modifications to their vestibular system, or wore specialized adhesive boots and gloves...<br>
...It's a shame that documents regarding its energy supply systems have been lost, and I have far too important a mission to accomplish to afford to start from scratch. If not...
