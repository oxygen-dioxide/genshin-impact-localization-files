;(Approach Ochkanatlan)
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, be careful!
:'''Paimon:''' I&mdash;Is it gone? Wh&mdash;What just happened!? Poor Paimon's heart's still palpitating...
:'''Paimon:''' Is the area up ahead its territory, or something? Still, why would it need to lord over such a big place anyway? Would it really kill it just to let us through?

;(Interact with the switch)
:{{Black Screen|As an enormous explosion rings out, you all slide to the bottom amidst sloughing rubble and sand...}}
:'''Paimon:''' *cough* Ugh, how did this happen?
:'''Paimon:''' Are you okay, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} I'm alright. How about you?
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon's fine, she's just choked a little by all the dust. So it took down the whole tower, huh? That's unexpected.
:{{DIcon}} Ow, ow, Paimon, it hurts!
::'''Paimon:''' Oh no! Where? Let Paimon take a look... Wait, you're not hurt at all! Why'd you have to lie like that?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rooo... Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like {{Little One}} isn't hurt either. Phew.
:'''Paimon:''' So has that nasty dragon really flown away this time? Paimon doesn't understand why it kept coming after us. So rude!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon would understand if it were protecting treasure, like in the fairy tales, and we'd stolen some of it. But we haven't done anything yet!
:{{DIcon}} Can it read minds, then?
::'''Paimon:''' Umm... No? Stop making things up. Paimon hasn't had the chance to think about that yet!
:{{DIcon}} Not that there's anything here for us to take anyway.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, and we couldn't have entered this place without it, either!
:{{DIcon}} Could it be the Blazed Meat Stew you had this morning?
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm? You mean it's after the Blazed Meat Stew in Paimon's stomach?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Ehhrrr...?
:'''Paimon:''' {{Little One}}? Did you find something?
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, would you look at that? There's a stack of scrolls underneath! Come take a look, {{Traveler}}.

-->...Anyway, this is where it starts! My adventure...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like notes left behind by an adventurer...
:'''Paimon:''' "An ancient city occupied by a violent and evil dragon"... Could this be the city we're looking at?
:'''Paimon:''' The notes said that many adventurers entered, but never returned. Looks like our dragon's already killed plenty of people!
:'''Paimon:''' The city is called... Ochkanatlan? What a strange name.
:{{DIcon}} I've heard that one before...
::'''Paimon:''' Now that you mention it... When we got the [[Golden Entreaty (Revelations from the Past)|Golden Entreaty]], Paimon remembers something about the other disc being in Ochkanatlan!
::'''Paimon:''' But the [[Saurian Relics Association]] people said it's a forbidden area that even they are afraid to enter. Guess we now know why, huh...
:{{DIcon}} Must be a very important location, then.
::'''Paimon:''' Now that you mention it, there is "Natlan" in the name! Might the people of Natlan have lived in cities way back when? Paimon doesn't remember hearing that.
:'''Paimon:''' "For the sake of the 'Jade of Return' sought by countless adventurers"... Guess this person entered the ancient city in search of something.
:'''Paimon:''' The {{Color|buzzword|Jade of Return}}... Sounds like something pretty sweet. If we can find it, we might make a whole boat-load of money!
:{{DIcon}} This could've taken place a long time ago.
::'''Paimon:''' W&mdash;Well, you're right! But maybe, just maybe, no one's found it all these hundreds of years, and so it's sat here, just waiting for great adventurers like us to show up!
:{{DIcon}} This person could've found it already.
::'''Paimon:''' Th&mdash;That could be true! But y'know, it's just as likely that they didn't! If all those other adventurers couldn't find it, this one probably didn't either.
:'''Paimon:''' And look at the massive ruins! It would be a shame if we didn't go inside and explore a bit.
:{{DIcon}} Yes, we would've been attacked in vain otherwise.
::'''Paimon:''' Uh, that sure was spoken with a vengeance! Well, we'll no doubt bump into that evil dragon again, and we can't just let it keep hurting adventurers!
:{{DIcon}} We have to do something about the evil dragon.
::'''Paimon:''' Exactly. If we bump into it again, we'll make sure it won't hurt more adventurers!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, you sure do get excited whenever we mention dragons, {{Little One}}!
:'''Paimon:''' Alright then &mdash; to Ochkanatlan!

:{{Black Screen|The mists shroud the ruined city forsaken by god...}}

;(After clearing the second enemy camp)
:'''Paimon:'''Ugh, what is it with this place? Even the hilichurls here are tough!
:'''Paimon:''' We can't keep going like this, {{Traveler}}. We've gotta find a spot to rest...

;(Approach an Abyssal Blight before obtaining Cocouik's Ring of Light, optional)
::Insufficient power. Unable to suppress the Abyssal Blight yet.

;(Attempt to enter Vucub Caquix Tower from the lower entrance, optional)

:{{Black Screen|But there are stories to tell you before nightfall...}}

;(Enter Vucub Caquix Tower)
:;(Monster charge at the entrance but the door closes in time)
:'''Paimon:''' Th&mdash;That was close!
:'''Paimon:''' Was Paimon seeing things? We were saved by a flash of golden light.
:{{DIcon}} I did see a pattern in gold...
::'''Paimon:''' Could it be the same kind of gold pattern that we saw when we encountered {{Little One}}? Did the pattern guide us here?
::'''Paimon:''' Feels like we're being helped by some kind of higher power somehow!
:{{DIcon}} Whatever it was, it saved us.
:'''Paimon:''' And this looks like a safer spot either way. Ugh, Paimon never thought we'd have to run from hilichurls!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr... Ehrr?
:'''Paimon:''' What's wrong? Are you okay, {{Little One}}?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrroo...
:'''Paimon:''' Did something in here catch your attention?
:'''Paimon:''' Well, not that we'll be leaving anytime soon with them blocking the door, so let's just explore this place.

;(Attempt to pull the lever before removing the nightspirit body block, optional)
::Seems like it's stuck and can't be activated...

;(Drop down to the lower level)
:'''Paimon:''' What a huge mural. Looks kinda spooky, too... Has it been painted over or something?
:'''Paimon:''' Just what kinda stuff has this place seen...

;(Attempt to open the eastern door before placing the nightspirit body block, optional)
::Seems like it's stuck. Maybe you need to find something to lift it up with...

;(Approach the marker)
:'''???:''' Hey, you over there!
:'''???:''' Yes, I'm talking about the three of you! Turn around.
:'''???:''' Looks like you understand what I'm saying.
:'''???:''' Phew. You scared me back there, you know? I thought you were [[Abyss]] monsters pretending to be humans. If you hadn't responded, I'd have struck first.
:{{DIcon}} We should be the scared ones.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, we sure didn't think there would be other people here!
:{{DIcon}} Thank goodness for my quick reactions, then.
::'''???:''' Is that why you exposed your back to me with such confidence?
::'''Paimon:''' Well, we didn't think there would be other people here!
:'''Bona:''' Heh. Anyway, the way we're meeting here, I'd call it destiny. I'm the ace adventurer of the [[Flower-Feather Clan]]. Call me [[Bona]].
:{{DIcon}} I'm {{Traveler}}.
::'''Paimon:''' And my name's Paimon. We're also adventurers exploring this place. This little one here is our companion, {{Little One}}!
:{{DIcon}} This is Paimon, my employer.
::'''Paimon:''' Huh? Seriously? What are you gonna do next, tell her that you're Paimon's guide? Anyway, {{MC|m=he|f=she}}'s {{Traveler}}. We're also adventurers who just arrived.
::'''Paimon:''' This little one here is our companion, {{Little One}}!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Are you also looking for the Jade of Return, like the other adventurers were?
:'''Bona:''' The Jade of Return... Yeah, I guess. You too, then?
:'''Paimon:''' Uh-huh! Guess we were right. No one's found it yet!
:'''Bona:''' Still... An adventurer openly displaying their weaknesses, a reckless white guiding spirit, and a small [[Tepetlisaurus]] that doesn't know what's happening...
:'''Bona:''' You're practically rookies who happened upon this dangerous and forbidden place without any preparation, aren't you?
:'''Bona:''' The Jade of Return is not something that amateur adventurers can find! You're lucky that you bumped into me, or you might've died before figuring out what's what.
:'''Paimon:''' What was that about a guiding spirit? Also, watch your words, 'cause we're decidedly not rookies!
:{{DIcon}} We're very experienced, as it happens.
::'''Paimon:''' If you don't believe us, you can ask [[Katheryne]] at the [[Adventurers' Guild]] about us. You'll find out just how good we are pretty quick!
:{{DIcon}} This is Paimon, the best adventurer in Teyvat.
::'''Paimon:''' Now that's exaggerating. But between the two of us, Paimon thinks we're top-notch adventurers all the same.
:'''Paimon:''' Why don't you take a look at our Adventurer Handbooks first? It's certified by the Adventurers' Guild and contains all our adventures!
:'''Bona:''' Wait a minute, what's an Adventurer Handbook? And this Adventurers' Guild... I've never heard of it. Was it established recently?
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? And you call yourself an adventurer? How do you not know about those two things?
:'''Bona:''' No, no, what I mean is that you're not making sense. What do you mean, you need to be certified by some random organization to become an adventurer!?
:'''Bona:''' Aren't adventurers supposed to be courageous and unbound? Why must there be a Guild to keep them in check?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, you do have a point... Wait, no! The Adventurers' Guild is very important, and not just "some random organization"!
:'''Paimon:''' Still, Paimon's never considered how people would become adventurers if the Guild didn't exist...
:'''Bona:''' A fair concern! For starters, one needs enough curiosity, a thirst for knowledge, and a sense of responsibility to help others.
:'''Bona:''' But most importantly, you need the courage to take that first step! Once you make the decision and start on a journey, you've become an adventurer.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon has enough curiosity for both of us.
::'''Paimon:''' That's right, that's totally Paimon's thing! Whether it's treasures or gourmet, Paimon's always curious!
::'''Paimon:''' By the way, Paimon had the most amazing [[Blazed Meat Stew]] this morning.
::{{DIcon}} This isn't foreshadowing, is it?
:{{DIcon}} I sure love sticking my nose in other people's businesses.
::'''Paimon:''' You mean you enjoy helping others! Why would you put yourself down like that?
:{{DIcon}} It's the courage that counts most.
::'''Bona:''' Fine, I will give you that. You're a bold lot, stepping into this forbidden city.
:'''Bona:''' Still, how did you get in at all? The only entrance should have been sealed shut. If you're in here, does that mean the monsters outside...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, about that... This is kinda embarrassing, but we were chased in here by hilichurls...
:'''Paimon:''' Also, no need to worry about them, or any other monsters. A golden light stopped them from entering after we came in.
:'''Bona:''' A golden light? Oh, so Coco saved you! Now I feel a lot safer. If Coco approves of you, then you can't be bad sorts.
:'''Paimon:''' Coco? Who's that? You mean there's someone else here?
:'''Bona:''' Coco's my companion, like {{Little One}} is yours. Anyway, come with me and see for yourself.
:{{Black Screen|You follow Bona and return to ground level.}}
:'''Bona:''' [[Cocouik]]? Where did you go?
:'''Bona:''' Aha, here you are.
:'''Cocouik:''' Chree?
:'''Paimon:''' What a cute little guy! Looks like a green [[Specter]].
:{{DIcon}} That doesn't sound cute at all.
:{{DIcon}} Those words are not exactly flattering, Paimon.
:'''Bona:''' Don't call it a Specter, that's mean! Its name is Cocouik. I chose the name, by the way, and given how shiny it is, I'd say it's pretty spot on too!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Cocouik:''' Kuru?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr... Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' You seem to be getting along just fine. So the light that saved us came from this little guy, huh? Incredible!
:'''Bona:''' That's right. Cocouik might be small, but it's the guardian spirit of this area. I've been able to roam all over this ancient city thanks to it.
:'''Bona:''' And when it accumulates enough power, even that evil dragon is no match for it!
:'''Paimon:''' Right, Paimon almost forgot about that mean guy! You encountered it too, didn't you? Well, we wouldn't have come here if it weren't for the dragon.
:'''Bona:''' Well... It's a little embarrassing, but that dragon took my Pyrophosphorite, which is critical to finding the Jade of Return. I have to get it back!
:'''Paimon:''' Pyrophosphorite? So you need something like that to obtain the Jade? Sounds complicated.
:'''Bona:''' It's normal for you not to know. After, [[Taika|my father]]... Anyway, since we're all adventurers trapped in here, how about we work together until we beat that evil dragon?
:'''Bona:''' I don't know how good you are, but we can't go wrong by joining forces, whether it's to explore this place or fight the dragon.
:{{DIcon}} Well, this works for me.
::'''Bona:''' Heh! I like your decisiveness.
:{{DIcon}} That's our line. We can't just leave you here, right?
::'''Bona:''' Hah, you shouldn't underestimate me like that... but still, I like your decisiveness.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph. That's right, we've gotta face off with that nasty dragon again to make sure it doesn't hurt more people!
:'''Paimon:''' Still, if we can defeat that guy and grab the Pyrophosphorite back, and then you find the Jade of Return, remember to give us a share too, alright? We'll... just about accept a forty-sixty split...
:'''Bona:''' Heh, it's a bit early for that discussion now, don't you think? Besides, the Jade of Return isn't the sort of thing you can split up like a pie...
:'''Bona:''' Heh. You really didn't know anything before coming here, did you? Good thing you bumped into me.
:'''Bona:''' We'll talk about the other stuff later, alright? Our top priority right now is beating the dragon and getting the Pyrophosphorite back.
:'''Bona:''' Well then, let's get going! The monsters outside shouldn't be an issue with Coco on our side, but the dragon... Well, that's a different story.

:'''"Cocouik":''' Kururuk!
:'''Bona:''' Hehe, how's that? Coco's pretty amazing, huh?
:'''Bona:''' If we can fully charge its energy, maybe we can just shoot that dragon down.

;(After collecting the second Secret Source Scrap)
:'''Paimon:''' Gah, that vile... evil dragon! Guess it decided to show up before we could even go find it, huh?

;(After collecting the third Secret Source Scrap)
:'''Bona:''' About time, too. If we can shoot it down from here...
:'''Cocouik:''' Chee! Kuchee!
:'''Bona:''' Yes, we just need to use that thing. Try putting your hand on Coco, {{Traveler}}...

:'''Paimon:''' Yeah! But why's it called that, though? You sure have strange tastes...
:'''Bona:''' You don't think it sounds awesome? Speaking from my experience as an adventurer, it's much easier for people to remember and pass on skill names if they're flashy.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's forget about the name for a moment here... Thanks for helping us out again, Coco. We couldn't have beat the dragon back without you.
:'''Cocouik:''' Kru...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Wrrooo...
:'''Paimon:''' Don't be sad! We're not saying that you didn't do anything, {{Little One}}.
:{{DIcon}} Not great with words, are we?
::'''Paimon:''' C'mon, just help Paimon explain, {{Traveler}}! We've all got different strengths! This just wasn't the time for {{Little One}} to shine yet!
:{{DIcon}} Everyone has their strengths.
::'''Paimon:''' That's right. You'll get your chance soon, {{Little One}}, Paimon knows it!
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, the evil dragon flew off in that direction, huh?
:'''Bona:''' Hmph. An injured beast always flees to its nest first. I'll bet that its {{sic|lair over|expected=lair's over}} that way.
:'''Bona:''' We'll have to get the Pyrophosphorite back before it recovers!
:'''Bona:''' If I were alone, I wouldn't have dared to take the dragon on even if it were injured.
:'''Bona:''' But we're a group now, and you're pretty good... I think we'll be fine.
:{{DIcon}} I'm not sure I can shoulder this burden...
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, I've suddenly got some urgent matters to attend to...

:{{DIcon}} The golden pattern...

::'''Paimon:''' Hmm, is that the same pattern we saw when we encountered {{Little One}}? Could this evil dragon be related to him somehow?
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rroo...

::'''Paimon:''' Wait, is looking for the treasure in this ancient city one of his trials, too?
:'''Bona:''' Hmm? What are you talking about?
:'''Bona:''' Gah... That was quite an ordeal. I thought we had it dead to rights there, but it lives to fight another day, huh?
:'''Bona:''' If nothing else, though, we can get my Pyrophosphorite back... Ah, yes. It's right over here!
:[[File:Vaulting the Wall of Morning Mist Pyrophosphorite.png|200px]]
:'''Paimon:''' Speaking of that, what should we do now? We came here looking for the Jade of Return that adventurer spoke of...
:'''Paimon:''' But we don't know what that thing is yet, do we?
:'''Paimon:''' You must know something about it, right, Bona? Is it one of those things that'll require three Pyrophosphorite chunks to unseal or something?
:'''Bona:''' If only it were that simple... But in truth, it's not to be found within this city, but instead, in the sky.
:'''Paimon:''' What? But the notes we found in the tower said... Did those adventurers make a mistake?
:'''Bona:''' Wait, you came to Ochkanatlan, the forbidden city, on account of some notes you just... happened to pick up? Heh. "The more skilled the person, the more bold their deeds," I guess.

;(After completing [[Between Pledge and Forgettance]]){{Verify}}
::'''Bona:''' Since you don't know anything about the Jade of Return, you probably haven't heard about the story of the {{Rubi|Tonatiuh|Skyserpent Ship}}, then?
:'''Bona:''' As the name suggests, it was a sky-faring ship built by Python King Och-Kan, the tyrant who ruled Ochkanatlan. The ship was filled to the brim with treasures, and countless adventurers from Natlan have pursued it.
:'''Bona:''' My old man included, of course. He was the best adventurer from the Flower-Feather Clan.
:'''Bona:''' But the Tonatiuh did hold greater significance to him beyond his ambitions as an adventurer.
:'''Bona:''' The Abyss calamity devastated our tribe decades ago, and the evil dragon that occupies this ancient city also appeared around the same time.
:'''Bona:''' Rumor had it that one of the countless treasures aboard the ship was the {{Rubi|Jade of Return|Ometeotl}}, and that locating it would quell this Abyss-tainted ancient city.
:'''Bona:''' At that time, we'd just witnessed the nightmare of the Abyss. So if we could find the Jade and suppress the contamination here in the city, our tribe would no longer have to live in fear.
:'''Bona:''' My old man set off on a journey for that purpose... but he never returned. All that remains is this Pyrophosphorite chunk, which he found in the ruins.
:{{DIcon}} I'm sorry for your loss...
::'''Bona:''' Don't be. I've actually never met him. I heard all this from a woman who adventured alongside him.
:{{DIcon}} Did the evil dragon...

:'''Paimon:''' Paimon didn't know that the Jade of Return was so important. Guess we aren't pawning it off for Mora now...
:'''Paimon:''' But we can remove the Abyss threat against your tribe if we can find it, and that would be amazing, too!
:'''Paimon:''' We just have to locate this Altar, right? Bona, you must know where it is, don't you?
:'''Bona:''' Well, I don't know either... I only snuck in here recently, and only because I was looking for clues concerning the Altar of Primal Flame.
:'''Bona:''' I encountered lots of unexpected dangers, but things started looking up after I met Coco.
:'''Cocouik:''' Chee!
:'''Bona:''' The evil dragon was the only problem at that point! I was planning on sneaking in while it was out, but it got me good, ha!
:'''Bona:''' But it's gone now, thanks to you, and I got my Pyrophosphorite back. Now, I can go seek the Altar of Primal Flame.
:{{DIcon}} Must you find the Jade of Return?
::'''Bona:''' Yes, I have to. I became an adventurer because I wanted to find it.
:{{DIcon}} You don't want us to go with you?
::'''Bona:''' No way! I was just about to ask, actually!
;(Before completing [[Between Pledge and Forgettance]]){{Verify}}
::'''Bona:''' You're also here for the Jade of Return, aren't you? In that case, would you like to come with me? This'll be easier by far if we join your strength to my knowledge.
:'''Bona:''' As long as we follow Coco's directions, we should be able to find it and access the Tonatiuh up in the air together...
:'''Bona:''' I can't split the Jade of Return with you for sale, but there must surely be other treasures up there to be claimed as an adventurer's reward!
;(After completing [[Between Pledge and Forgettance]]){{Verify}}
::'''Bona:''' Look, even Coco's light points to somewhere higher up!
:'''Paimon:''' Well, this sure doesn't sound like a guaranteed score, but it's not like we can do anything other than trust you, eh?
:'''Paimon:''' And if we do reach the Tonatiuh, we can help everyone AND make a huge profit. Talk about a win-win!
:'''Paimon:''' How about it, {{Traveler}}? Let's go with Bona, shall we?
:'''Bona:''' Hehe, really? That's great to hear! I knew you'd agree to help! With you around, I'm sure I'll be able to fulfill my father's last wish.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' {{Little One}} concurs! It's settled, then. Let's get going before the dragon comes back!
