It is a mechanical being which was created by a [[Sumeru]] researcher by the name of [[Abattouy]].

==Profile==
Karkata was created by the researcher [[Abattouy]] in order to prove that mechanical beings could be made into true lifeforms. However, due to other overzealous researchers going beyond acceptable norms, the Akademiya banned the study of mechanical beings, which caused Abattouy to leave the Akademiya.

Abattouy was intending to gradually improve Karkata over time, first by attempting to make it learn how to make coffee which it appeared to have mastered. Later, he implemented a program that allowed Karkata to look for parts on its own to repair itself. As Abattouy was isolated and in need of Mora to continue his research, he eventually developed three Ley Line extractors to serve as his power source. However, he had harvested the lines too much and subsequently died with Karkata looking on, unable to turn the device off as he had never implemented a program for it.

Karkata, seeing its creator dead, tried to "repair" him to no avail by using mechanical parts that it pilfered from passing convoys. At the same time, the Ley Line devices attracted a large number of [[Ruin Sentinel]]s who began using its energy, causing a special contaminated zone of sorts different to that of [[the Withering]] and prompting the [[Traveler]] to accept a commission by the [[Adventurers' Guild]] to investigate. Being in the rainforest itself, Tighnari was also prompted to investigate the cause and they discovered Karkata.

Karkata led them to Abattouy's lab, they learned why Karkata had been stealing parts and watched as it tried to repair Abattouy before shutting down due to neglecting itself in favor of its creator. After Tighnari took a few papers and burned the lab down to prevent the Akademiya from getting their hands on Abattouy's research, he repaired Karkata and took him to Pardis Dhyai. The [[Matra]] eventually discovered Karkata there, but Tighnari stated that he had taken it on as a research assistant and they left it alone.

===Appearance===
Karkata is a [[Ruin Defender]] with a special gold and white color scheme.
