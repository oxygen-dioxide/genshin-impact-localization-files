|description  = Dori's outfit. This outfit almost begs to be further adorned with gems and precious metals, loudly announcing its wearer's love of wealth to the world. And they say that this is the merchant Dori's casual wear... So does this mean that she has clothes even more expensive than this one!?

Dori sports a large purple hat, a black cropped top with a large blue gem and detached white sleeves, a pair of baggy purple pants with white overall straps, and black sandals. All of her clothing has gold details, trinkets, or other ornaments, such as gems. Her hat has a large golden ornament with a gray stone that resembles a flower on the front along with a white and purple bow. Her {{Electro}} [[Vision]] is attached to a large tassel dangling from her hat. She also wears a number of golden rings on her fingers and pink nail polish.
