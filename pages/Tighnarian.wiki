'''Tighnarians''', also known as '''Valuka Shuna''', are a humanoid, foxlike race in [[Sumeru]].

Originally hailing from '''Tighnar''', they lived in the [[Great Red Sand]] during the era of [[King Deshret]]'s civilization and remained there for over a century after his death, until constant warring between [[Eremite]] tribes led them to move to [[Dharma Forest]].<ref name="Sage of Sages">{{Ref/Quest|Sage of Sages}}</ref>

[[Tighnari]] is their descendant, named after them.<ref name="past">{{Ref/Quest|The Dead Past is the Living Present}}</ref>

==Overview==
The Tighnarians are known for their wisdom, and are credited with the city of [[Tulaytullah]]'s enduring prosperity in the era following King Deshret's death. While people came to associate Tighnarians with Tulaytullah,<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Tulaytullah's Remembrance}}</ref> they actually came from Tighnar and only settled in Tulaytullah following King Deshret's death.<ref name="Sage of Sages" />

After moving to the rainforest, the [[Aranara]] gave the Tighnarians the name '''"Valuka Shuna"''', meaning "large desert dog" in the [[Aranara Language]] &mdash; despite the fact that Tighnarians more closely resembled foxes.<ref name="tighnari">{{Ref/CS|Tighnari|Character Story 5}}</ref>

While [[Hermanubis]], a Tighnarian, held [[Electro]]-based powers while he was alive, it is unclear whether all Tighnarians had elemental abilities, or if this was a unique trait bestowed upon him as King Deshret's familiar.

===Appearance===
Hermanubis, currently the only example of a "true" Tighnarian,<ref group="Note">"'True' Tighnarian" is an unofficial distinction used to delineate Tighnarians from their descendants. In [[Tighnari/Lore#Character Story 5|Tighnari's Character Story 5]], Tighnari is stated to have "ancestors [who] had lived alongside the Valuka Shuna [...] inheriting some of their traits," indicating that he is more human than Tighnarian.</ref> had a jackal-like head but a humanlike body.

Mortal descendants of Tighnarians have inherited some Tighnarian traits, implicitly due to intermarriage. They have large ears reminiscent of {{w|fennec fox}}es', as well as bushy tails, but otherwise have human features.<ref name="tighnari" />

When they resided in the desert, Tighnarians' hair and fur were light in color to help with heat tolerance, but as they adapted to their new lives in the rainforest, they developed darker green fur. This dark fur has caused some Tighnarian descendants to have particularly low heat tolerance.<ref name="tighnari"/><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Competition on the Sands|quote='''Tighnari:''' My ancestors, the Valuka Shuna, were originally from the desert. But I guess this is what happens when a species migrates — they become intolerant of their original environment...}}</ref>

==Story==
===King Deshret's Era===
Given the lack of information about Tighnar, little is known about the Tighnarians' origins. Hermanubis was said to have been a "warrior of Tighnar" who came from the "barren desert sands" to serve King Deshret,<ref name="Sage of Sages" /> and given that Deshret "chose the sage Hermanubis from among the Tighnarians" to be his familiar, many &mdash; if not all &mdash; the Tighnarians became Deshret's followers.<ref name="past">{{Ref/Quest|The Dead Past is the Living Present}}</ref> While Deshret was alive, most of his priests were Tighnarians.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Khensa}}</ref>

===After King Deshret's Death===
Following King Deshret's death, the Tighnarian priests followed Hermanubis to [[Tulaytullah]], where they founded the [[Temple of Silence]] to preserve the knowledge that survived the fall of Deshret's civilization. Little over a hundred years later, the various desert city-states descended into war. While Tulaytullah managed to remain stable for a while, war eventually came to them. A king of [[Gurabad]] besieged Tulaytullah, demanding the Temple of Silence be handed over to him as proof of his victory. To secure their own positions, the ruling elite of the city colluded with him by antagonizing the Temple of Silence as the true source of the chaos. By this point, Hermanubis had exhausted his strength trying to keep [[forbidden knowledge]], introduced to the Great Red Sand by Deshret before his death, at bay. To safeguard the Temple, Hermanubis split himself into many parts called Ba fragments, which granted his power to members of the Temple of Silence.<ref name="Sage of Sages" />

Though this new power was able to drive away the invading Gurabad army, the people of Tulaytullah were wary of this strange phenomenon and shunned the Temple of Silence. Because of that, the Temple and the Tulaytullah Tighnarians abandoned the city and the desert altogether, choosing to carefully make their way to the rainforest to preserve their knowledge<ref name="Sage of Sages" /> by forming an alliance with the [[Sumeru Akademiya]].<ref name="Repose">{{Ref/Quest|After Repose}}</ref> In their historical traditions, Tighnarian descendants claim that their survival was due to [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]]'s grace, which also turned their fur green.<ref name="tighnari" />

===400 Years Ago to Present===
For the next several centuries, the Temple of Silence and the Tulaytullah Tighnarians lived peacefully in the rainforest, successfully forming a partnership with Sumeru Akademiya in order to preserve their knowledge. However, after Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's death during the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago, the Sages who controlled the Akademiya grew corrupt. A hundred years later, the Temple of Silence's members deemed the Sages untrustworthy and quietly ended their partnership. While some members decided to return to the desert,<ref name="Repose" /> most Tighnarians decided to remain in the rainforest.<ref name="past" />

Tighnarian descendants can still be found around Sumeru to this day, such as Tighnari and his ancestry.
