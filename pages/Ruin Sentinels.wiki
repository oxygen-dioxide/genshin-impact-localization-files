'''Ruin Sentinel''' is an [[Enemy Group]] of [[Automatons]] found in the regions of [[Inazuma]], [[Enkanomiya]] and, [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]]. They are usually found in groups, all Ruin Sentinels will take the form of a robotic cube when dormant. When not dormant, they will be patrolling on a fixed route.

Ruin Sentinels are also present when fighting the [[Perpetual Mechanical Array]], with the boss itself being comprised of each of the four types.

All Ruin Sentinels (excluding the boss) contain a 'core', which can temporary disable them (much like the [[Ruin Guard]], and other [[Humanoid Ruin Machines]]). However, these cores are only exposed during specific attacks (see Enemy Pages for more information), and some can only be disabled by the use of [[Catalyst]] or [[Bows|Bow]] characters, however there are some exceptions (i.e. [[Keqing]]'s [[Stellar Restoration]], or [[Xingqiu]]'s Sword Rain generated from [[Guhua Sword: Raincutter]]).

Similar to Humanoid Ruin Machines, Ruin Sentinels cannot be staggered by stacking [[Interruption Resistance|poise damage]], making them very sturdy and prone to attacks which would usually knock back opponents prone to interruption.

Ruin Sentinels can carry a {{Color|Physical RES}} of 30% (Ruin Cruiser and Ruin Destroyer) or 50% (Ruin Defender and Ruin Scout) making it less viable to use {{Color|Physical DMG}} against them.

==Trivia==
*The Ruin Scout resembles the [https://honkai-impact-3rd-archives.fandom.com/wiki/Honkai_Beast#Jellyfish Psy Meduzoa] from ''{{w|Honkai Impact 3rd}}''.
*Their designs are based on biological aspects of nature, with each representing a different type of organism. This is untrue for the [[Ruin Guard]], [[Ruin Hunter]] and the [[Ruin Grader]].
*According to [[Muzhen]] during the [[Thunder Sojourn]] event, similar machines have once been dug up at [[The Chasm]], later revealed to be [[Ruin Serpent]]s.
