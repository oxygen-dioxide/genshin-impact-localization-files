'''Riftwolves''', also known as '''Wolves of the Rift'''<ref name="Hdbk">{{Ref/Enemy|Wolves of the Rift|handbook=1}}</ref> or '''Rifthounds''', are an [[Elite Enemy|elite]] enemy group hailing from the Abyss. They are mainly found in [[Tsurumi Island]], [[Inazuma]] but can also be found in [[The Chasm (Subregion)|The Chasm]], [[Enkanomiya]], [[Sumeru]], [[Fontaine]], [[Natlan]], and [[Wolvendom]] (after completing [[Lupus Minor Chapter]]: [[The Meaning of Lupical|Act I]]).

In combat, Riftwolves use elemental attacks, and any attacks that make contact (including those absorbed by [[shield]]s) will apply a party-wide [[corrosion]] debuff, which continuously drains HP from all party members while active. Riftwolves also utilize a [[fury]] system, which accumulates when they are hit by Elemental DMG of their own type. When this bar fills, the Riftwolf enters an Elemental Devour state, which increases the ferocity of its attacks, but also decreases the Elemental RES of their own type.

==Lore==
Riftwolves are monsters from the [[Abyss]] that are said to be able to erode the boundaries of the world. They were created by the alchemist [[Rhinedottir|Gold]] who classified them as "Alfisol,"<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Ref/Enemy|Thundercraven Rifthound Whelp}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Rockfond Rifthound Whelp}}</ref> however the Golden Wolflord was an unintentional creation.<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Golden Wolflord}}</ref> Riftwolves were once prevalent throughout Teyvat during the [[cataclysm]], where they were the advance guard for the other monsters that were behind them.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Cleansing Light}}</ref> They are said to behave biologically similar to wolves.<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Rockfond Rifthound}}</ref>

After the cataclysm, the riftwolves were driven to low numbers by numerous hunts and resistances, but have started to re-emerge once more, initially on [[Tsurumi Island]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> A group of riftwolves also appeared in [[Wolvendom]] and began to cause havoc to the surrounding area.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Meaning of Lupical}}</ref>

In the {{Quest|Khvarena of Good and Evil}}, Riftwolves are described as "echoes left from the battles fought so many years ago," remnants of the disasters that plagued the Sumeru Desert at the time of the cataclysm. Small pockets of riftwolves can be found across Sumeru.

Small pockets of riftwolves can also be found in [[Fontaine]], appearing through [[Beastly Rift]]s that were present on [[Elynas]] until they were removed by the [[Traveler]]. A large riftwolf nest had also inhabited the [[Roots of Erinnyes]]; coupled with a [[Root-Consuming Tumor]], their presence caused the tree to become sickened, turning from bright blue to a dark yellow color. This nest and the tumor was exterminated by the [[Traveler]] and a [[Primordial Bathysmal Vishap]]. 

Due to the instability of the [[Ley Line]]s in Natlan, several riftwolves prowl the lands. Some riftwolves have also appeared in attacks from the Abyss, summoned by pylons ripped into the land.

==Trivia==
* According to {{w|USDA soil taxonomy}}, Alfisols are a soil order for soils that contain aluminium and iron. They also contain a clay-enriched {{w|subsoil}} and are typically very fertile.
