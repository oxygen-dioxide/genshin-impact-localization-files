'''Riftwolves''', also known as '''Wolves of the Rift'''<ref name="Hdbk">{{Ref/Enemy|Wolves of the Rift|handbook=1}}</ref> or '''Rifthounds''', are an [[Elite Enemy|elite]] enemy group hailing from the Abyss. They are mainly found in [[Tsurumi Island]], [[Inazuma]].

In combat, Riftwolves use elemental attacks and apply the [[Corrosion]] status on hit, which continuously drains [[HP]] from all party members. Rifthounds also utilize a [[fury]] system; the more they are attacked by the element they're associated with, they will enter an Elemental Devourer state, causing them to attack more aggressively at the cost of decreased [[RES]] to that element.

==Lore==
Riftwolves are monsters from the [[Abyss]] and are said to be able to erode the boundaries of the world. They were created by the alchemist [[Rhinedottir|Gold]]. Once prevalent throughout Teyvat during the [[cataclysm]], they were the advance guard for the other monsters that were behind them.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Cleansing Light}}</ref>

After the cataclysm, the riftwolves were driven to low numbers by numerous hunts and resistance, but have started to re-emerge once more, starting in Inazuma. A group of riftwolves also appeared in [[Wolvendom]] and began to cause havoc to the surrounding area.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Meaning of Lupical}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* [[Rhinedottir]], the alchemist that created the Riftwolves, classified them as "Alfisol". According to {{w|USDA soil taxonomy}}, Alfisols are a soil order for soils that contain aluminium and iron. They also contain a clay-enriched {{w|subsoil}} and are typically very fertile.
