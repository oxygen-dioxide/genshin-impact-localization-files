|description  = A gentle, elegant butterflyfish variant. It has a lovely, streamlined dorsal fin, and has the nickname "Queen of the Waters."<br />Earthen-colored patterns run across its body, and its temper is also as steady as stone. They can go a bit overboard, however, and will sometimes lie at the bottom and not move an inch, just like a rock, leading some buyers to think that they've bought some hopelessly moribund old fish.

==Trivia==
* While the English name for the in-game animal uses Shirakodai, the Japanese name for the {{Lang|{{w|Chaetodon nippon|Japanese butterflyfish}}|ja=シラコダイ(白粉鯛)|ja_rm=shirakodai}}, the Japanese name refers to butterflyfish in general.
