|[[File:Discover Traces, Explore Nature Pop Science Journal 1.png|200px|link=]]<br>Protecting the Snowy Mountains & Glaciers
|<!--
-->Snowy mountains and glaciers are not just stunningly beautiful features of the natural landscape &mdash; they're also the source of many high-altitude water systems, as well as the home of rare flora and fauna<br><!--
-->But as the global temperature rises, they are melting at an unprecedented rate.<br><!--
-->Every little thing you do may potentially help protect the snowy mountains and glaciers. For example: If you ever visit one of them, remember to take your trash with you when you leave!
|-
|[[File:Discover Traces, Explore Nature Pop Science Journal 2.png|200px|link=]]<br>Protecting the Oceans
|<!--
-->More than 70% of the earth's surface is covered by oceans. They have an important impact on the global climate, biodiversity, as well as social economy. We are now facing sea-level rises, ocean acidification, damage to biodiversity, and other crises.<br><!--
-->Prevent trash from entering the oceans, and put an end to illegal fishing. Let's all do our best to keep the oceans clean for the sake of all the wonderful creatures that inhabit them!
|-
|[[File:Discover Traces, Explore Nature Pop Science Journal 3.png|200px|link=]]<br>Protecting the Coral Reefs
|<!--
-->Coral reefs play a very important role in many ways, such as protecting the coastlines, absorbing carbon emissions, and being used in the production of pharmaceuticals.<br><!--
-->20% of the world's coral reefs have already been destroyed, and a further 50% are currently under threat, so protecting them is of imminent importance.<br><!--
-->Sewage and other wastewater must be treated and disposed of properly, and we don't touch coral reefs while diving. We must work together to protect the fragile and precious coral reef ecosystem!
|-
|[[File:Discover Traces, Explore Nature Pop Science Journal 4.png|200px|link=]]<br>Protecting the Forests
|<!--
-->Forests are the "lungs of the planet," providing oxygen for us to breathe. They also play a vital part in maintaining climate stability, water circulation, and biodiversity. Excessive deforestation threatens forest ecosystems.<br><!--
-->Reduce paper waste, choose eco-friendly materials, and support renewable energy to help stop the destruction of forests.
|-
|[[File:Discover Traces, Explore Nature Pop Science Journal 5.png|200px|link=]]<br>Combating Desertification
|<!--
-->Human activities such as over-farming, over-mining, and over-grazing lead to desertification, which has a severe impact on biodiversity, economic stability, and sustainable development.<br><!--
-->The responsibility for carrying out afforestation, using water resources more wisely, increasing research into desertification control technology, and working to reverse the effects of desertification lies with us all.<br><!--
-->Every precious drop of water that we save could have a life-saving significance for a little sapling in the desert!
