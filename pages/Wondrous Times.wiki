:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Hmm, what am I supposed to do now... Forget it, I'll just head back.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907701 kaveh 01.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Tighnari? What are you doing here?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Oh, it's you! Good to finally see you again.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I came into the city to buy some experiment reagents, hoping to bring them back with me to Gandharva Ville.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' But as soon as I got here, I noticed someone banging on Cyrus' door. You've all heard of Cyrus, right? He's an ex-sage and Cyno's adoptive father.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 05.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I was thinking about going over to ask what's happening. That granny over there may appear old and frail, but her vocal cords certainly sound loud and healthy as ever.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907701 kaveh 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...Granny?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 06.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Yeah, she's just over there. You can go check out the situation yourselves in a moment.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 07.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' *sniff* Kaveh, were you at the tavern?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907701 kaveh 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I had a quick drink or two. Can you still smell the alcohol?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 08.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Drinking in broad daylight... Really? You want to pass out by the road and get run over by a Sumpter Beast like some mindless Fungus? Huh?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 09.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' And you, {{Traveler}}. You didn't try to stop him?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907701 kaveh 04.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Uh... I...
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 10.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' You look like a wreck, Kaveh. What happened? Are you feeling down again?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 11.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' You know what, I'm hosting a meal at Pardis Dhyai tomorrow evening. Do you want to come?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907701 kaveh 05.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Huh? Oh, I had no idea... Let me think for a moment. Uh, I'll come if I can find some time.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 12.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Alright, then I'll plan on reserving two seats for you.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907701 tighnari 13.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I'll be heading back to Gandharva Ville for now. I have a feeling that argument over there is gonna continue for quite some time. It might be best if we don't get involved.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907701 kaveh 06.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' A granny who lives nearby... Let's go take a look.

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Zaha Hadi, optional)
:{{A|vo kvcop001 19077 zahahadi 01.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' (My tomato! I know Cyrus is the one who picked it!)

;(Approach Zaha Hadi)
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 01.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Hah, so plan on keeping yourself locked in there, huh? Fine by me, if you're not going to come out, then I'm not going to leave!
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 02.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' My tomato was growing so well &mdash; it had all the potential to become the best tomato this year... And you cut it straight from the vine!?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907702 spantamadcyrus 02.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' I already told you, I had nothing to do with it! Why would I take a tomato that's still weeks from ripening?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907702 spantamadcyrus 03.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' You'd have to be awfully "green" as an investigator to think it was me.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 03.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' ...
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907702 spantamadcyrus 04.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' You see, the word "green" here could refer both to the color of the tomato, and the fact that your skills could use some&mdash;
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 04.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Enough nonsense. Just come out and face me, you coward!
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907702 spantamadcyrus 05.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' You're out of your mind. If I've actually done something wrong, then get a matra and pull me out by force, why don't ya!
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 05.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Why you&mdash;
:{{DIcon}} Don't tell me this is...
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907702 kaveh 01.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Professor Zaha Hadi?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 06.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' And who are you&mdash; Oh, Kaveh! Fancy seeing you here!
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 07.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' How long has it been? C'mon, get over here and let the Professor take a good look at you... Not bad, not bad. You've grown taller again!
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907702 kaveh 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Um... Professor, what's going on here?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 08.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Ah, it's no big deal, really. A few of us old scholars got bored in our retirement, and decided to put together a vegetable growing competition. At the end, whoever loses will have to go up on stage and do a performance for the winners.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 09.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Which brings us to our current predicament... Hehe, my tomato was sure to win until a certain someone decided they couldn't bear to lose.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907702 spantamadcyrus 06.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Hey, don't try to defame me in front of the kids! If we're airing each other's dirty laundry now, then why don't we talk about you sneaking into Jannat's garden the other night&mdash;
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 10.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Ahem! Lucky for you, seeing these youngsters come to pay their respects today has put me in a better mood. I'll let you off the hook for now.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907702 zahahadi 11.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' C'mon, let's go. We'll take our conversation elsewhere. He doesn't need to be a part of it.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907702 kaveh 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' A&mdash;Ah yes, of course.

;(Knock on Cyrus' door, optional)
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907702 spantamadcyrus 01.ogg}} '''Cyrus:''' Stop trying to break down my door, Zaha Hadi! You know I'm not going to come out!

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 01.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Is [[Faranak]] still doing well?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 01.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Yes, as far as I know. She left for Fontaine some time ago, and started a new life for herself. She's still doing work related to architecture, though.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 02.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Ah yes, I did hear about that. Did that upset you at all?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' No, not at all. She's already sacrificed a lot raising me as a single mother.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 03.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' That's good to hear. Your mother did struggle quite a bit those few years... It's probably a good thing that she found a new place to call home.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 04.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Sometimes I wonder if things were harder for her because she was so beautiful. People were always drawn to her beauty first, only to realize she had a sensitive and vulnerable heart underneath.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 05.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' She was still quite young when she first joined my class as a student. Beautiful and radiant with her golden hair, yet quiet and single-minded, she seemed like a lass from some aristocratic house who was seeing the outside world for the first time.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 06.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' She had to make a lot of drastic changes in her life to raise you on her own.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 07.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Even during her time in the Akademiya, she was a thorough perfectionist. If she was unsatisfied with something she had made, she'd insist on redoing it even if I was perfectly happy with it.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 08.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' She had many admirers, and they'd always fill up the first few rows of seats, hoping they could get closer to her sitting in the first row. If it were any of my other classes, you'd have found nobody sitting in the front.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 09.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' But every time I saw her, she was always in that same rigid pose. She'd have one hand on her forehead, with the other clutching her pencil. Her eyebrows would be knitted in a frown as she concentrated on the blueprint in front of her.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I'm sure she had many difficult moments in her life, how did she cope with the stress?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 10.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' I'm not too sure, she never talked about such things with me. She rarely opened up to other people, you know.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 11.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' I do remember one time though when she got into a heated argument with a friend. She said something that I found very memorable.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 12.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' She said: "True art cannot be understood, but as an artist, I wish some people could understand its meaning and value."
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 13.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' If you ask me, that's probably the greatest source of pain for geniuses of their craft. It's extremely hard for them to find someone who can truly understand their ideas.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 04.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' So that's how it is, hmm... I wonder if the password could be...
:{{DIcon}} "Understanding"?
:{{DIcon}} "Acknowledgment"?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 05.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Hmm... I tried both just now. Seems those aren't it, either.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 14.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' What are you trying to do?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 06.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' My mother left her notebook to me, but it has a password and I haven't figured out what it is yet. I'm trying to learn more about her so I'd have a better chance at cracking the code... Thank you for all that you told us.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 15.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Haha, it's the least I can do. Talking to youngsters like yourself makes me feel younger, too. Honestly, looking at you now, I can see how much you resemble her... It's almost as if she's standing right in front of me again.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 16.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Your personalities are quite alike, too. You're both stubborn, and both a little awkward. Of course, I'm sure the similarities are mostly superficial... but so long as you continue to harbor those traits, you'll find a lot of difficulties in your work.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 17.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' I've taught a lot of students over my career, and in my experience, very few genius architects of Kshahrewar ever found happiness for themselves.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 18.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' They would know exactly what they want to express, and fight for it tooth and nail, which inevitably led to arguments with their clients.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 19.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Some clients would choose to respect the architects' vision, or just let the argument go because of the architects' reputation, but those are the rare ones.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 20.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' When Faranak first graduated, she was getting into arguments with her clients nearly every single day. I think it only got a little better when she met your father.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 07.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I see... But could he understand the designs my mother made?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 21.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' No, I think they were probably beyond him, too. But despite that, he still stayed next to her, listening to her joys and sharing in her sorrows.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 22.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Faranak had many admirers, but she ended up choosing your father. His support probably played a part in that decision.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 08.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Hmm... So instead of "understanding," perhaps all we need is just "companionship"...
:{{DIcon}} Maybe that's what she was trying to tell you?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 09.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...Huh, it worked!
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 23.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Oh, was that the right password?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 10.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Yes!
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 24.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Then you should be on your way, child. Find a quiet place and see what she wanted to say to you.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 25.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Being the awkward person that she is, I suppose there were many things that Faranak could never say out loud. Instead, she probably left them in her diary hoping that they would make their way to you one day.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 26.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' If you're ever in a mood to chat again, just come and find me here. You're always welcome to discuss architecture topics with me as well.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 11.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Thank you so much, Professor.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 zahahadi 27.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Haha, there's no need to be so formal. I'll let you kids go. It's time for me to take another stroll around the vegetable garden.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 12.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I wonder what my mother could have written about...
:{{Black Screen|Kaveh starts quickly flipping through the notebook, revealing lines upon lines of elegant handwriting.}}
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 01.ogg}} '''Faranak:''' "They all say Zaha Hadi's class is the toughest, but I think it's actually not too bad. On the other hand, though, structural mechanics is definitely a pain no matter how you try to approach it... I doubled down and managed to get through it in the end."
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 02.ogg}} '''Faranak:''' "I met someone special. At first, I didn't think much of him, but now I feel very happy whenever I get to spend time with him."
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 03.ogg}} '''Faranak:''' "We decided to name our son Kaveh. I don't think a younger me would have ever imagined forming such an intimate bond with another person... Back then, I lived only in the shadow of myself, as well as that of the dream in my heart."
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 04.ogg}} '''Faranak:''' "The bad news came, and even though it's been several days now, I still can't bring myself to come to terms with what happened. My eyes are so swollen that it's hard to see. What if they are all lying to me, and this is just a long, cruel dream?"
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 05.ogg}} '''Faranak:''' "But I have to face reality. I still have someone to take care of. No matter what happens, I'll do my best to raise my son on my own."
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 13.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 14.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Huh? Is this... a drawing? Seems like it was done by my mother.
;(A drawing appears)
:[[File:Faranak's Drawing.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 15.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' This blonde man was probably my father... But who are the other people in the picture? Huh? Why do a few of them look somewhat familiar...
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, they do seem familiar...
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 16.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' From the dates in the notebook, she probably drew this more than thirty years ago. I hadn't even been born yet.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 17.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...Maybe we were thinking too much. Oh! There are a few lines written in the diary about this as well.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 06.ogg}} '''Faranak:''' "The one who invited us to the gathering is a talkative woman. Including us, three couples showed up... There was also a person who came alone."
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 07.ogg}} '''Faranak:''' "The talkative woman introduced everyone to each other. She spoke really quickly, so I couldn't quite catch everything she said, but I also didn't feel like asking her to repeat herself."
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 08.ogg}} '''Faranak:''' "My husband seems to be friends with the man with long ears. I couldn't really join their conversation, so I've resigned myself to sitting in a corner and drawing in my notebook."
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 09.ogg}} '''Faranak:''' "I don't think I'd be able to become friends with any of these people... especially that stiff-looking couple."
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 10.ogg}} '''Faranak:''' "That man is certainly very handsome, but he would constantly alternate between disjointed and serious ways of talking... His wife is a bit more bearable."
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 11.ogg}} '''Faranak:''' "We were not acquainted with each other to begin with, and I doubt we'll see each other again after this gathering. The ambiance of this gathering is surprisingly pleasant, however. Talking to people can allow us to find some peace after a long day."
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 12.ogg}} '''Faranak:''' "Maybe my son will also partake in these gatherings in the future. I hope he'll be able to make many friends."
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 18.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Who would have thought my mother used to attend that kind of thing... It seemed she was only good at talking about her own work, and found it difficult to join into other conversations. As a result, she often kept to herself and would be off to the side drawing.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 19.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' There's more written on the back... Oh, it seems like it was written to me.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 13.ogg}} '''Faranak:''' "Kaveh, I was both overjoyed and distressed when I learned of your decision to continue your studies in Kshahrewar."
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 14.ogg}} '''Faranak:''' "You are very talented, and I am confident that you will become an architect of much acclaim. However, the more talented you are as an artist, the more misery and anguish you may encounter."
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 15.ogg}} '''Faranak:''' "No one will be able to help you during your journey as an artist. But outside of your life as a creator, you can learn to form connections with other people, and enjoy many other things in life. It's the only way to alleviate your suffering."
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 faranak 16.ogg}} '''Faranak:''' "Whenever you feel down, seek out a friend to sit and have a chat. You can accumulate joy and fulfillment by spending time with them. The positive feelings you gain will get you through the long and difficult years. Never forget that companionship is the most important thing of all."
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 20.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' So that's the answer she prepared for me... She really thought long and hard about me and my future.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 21.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Well, now that I've read her words... Do you think I should accept Tighnari's invite, and attend that dinner at Pardis Dhyai?
:{{DIcon}} Wait, you were actually considering not going?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 22.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Uh... The thought had definitely crossed my mind.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 23.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Although it'd be nice to get together with friends and chat the night away... I don't want to bring down other people's moods because I'm sad.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 24.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Besides, don't most people hate the feeling of seeing their friends troubled and being unable to help? And what's worse, nearly all of my problems can't be easily resolved with some encouraging words or gesture.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 25.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' And don't forget, I'm also older than all of them... As their senior, I should appear to be a bit more responsible.
:{{DIcon}} But Tighnari saw right through you.
::{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 26.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Ah, you're right... *sigh* I really didn't expect to run into him here. I swear, his nose must be just as sensitive as his ears...
::{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 27.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Well then, I guess... it's best that we go and join him for dinner. *sigh* That means I'll owe him yet another meal now...
::{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 31.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' You know what, I'm not going to overthink it. I'll see you tomorrow at Pardis Dhyai!
:{{DIcon}} It's normal for friends to take care of each other.
::{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 28.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' You're not wrong, but I keep feeling like I haven't really helped them much in return...
::{{DIcon}} It's always fun to have you around, Kaveh.
:;(+1 Heart)
::{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 29.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Wait, do you mean it? You're not... making fun of me, are you?
::{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 30.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I've gotten so used to sarcasm that I can't tell what's genuinely a compliment anymore. Wait! By "fun," did you mean...
::{{A|vo kvcop001 1907704 kaveh 31.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' You know what, I'm not going to overthink it. I'll see you tomorrow at Pardis Dhyai!

;(Observe Zaha Hadi, optional)
:'''Observe Zaha Hadi:''' (Zaha Hadi is still arguing back and forth with Cyrus. It seems that they're not actually angry anymore, but just arguing to pass the time.)

;(Zaha Hadi idle line)
:{{A|vo kvcop001 19077 zahahadi 02.ogg}} '''Zaha Hadi:''' Haha, we'll see how long you can stay cooped up in there!

;(Approach Cyno and Tighnari at Pardis Dhyai)
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Alhaitham also got my invite, right? Will he be coming to join us?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 01.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Hmph, that guy? He's never been a fan of social gatherings. I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were you.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Are you sure?&nbsp;...Alright then, I guess we won't wait for him.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Yeah, let's go!&nbsp;...Uh, I mean, maybe we should give him a little more time. We can keep chatting for a while longer.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Oh, sure.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' You still haven't told me... What's the occasion for getting us together here at Pardis Dhyai?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' We're celebrating the end of the first phase of Collei's studies. I wanted to thank you all for the help you've given her along the way.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Then... Where's Collei?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 05.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' She said she wanted to show everyone a bit of what she's learned, so she's still doing some last-minute prep at home. She'll be here shortly.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 06.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Anyway, let's get started... *sigh* To tell you the truth, I'm actually not so confident that the second phase will go as well as the first.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 07.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' The curriculum will become a lot more involved, and I'm worried that she won't be able to get through all of it. I was hoping we could brainstorm about it together before she gets here.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 04.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I knew this wouldn't be just a simple free dinner... Is that why you also invited Alhaitham?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 08.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Yes, I thought it would be good if we could all put our heads together about this.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 09.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Anyway, let's take a quick trip down memory lane. What did you guys do when you ran into a problem that you didn't know how to solve, or got assigned a project that you knew you weren't going to finish on time?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Never happened to me.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 05.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I'd just pull another all-nighter.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 10.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' You two are hopeless... Does anyone have a more useful answer to the question?
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps you could adjust the pace of the curriculum?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 06.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Ooh! That's a good point! Confidence is the most important thing. Once you lose your sense of confidence, it'll become all but impossible to find the motivation to study.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 11.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Hmm, this could be a potential direction. I have already redesigned the literacy curriculum, and I was originally hoping to ask Alhaitham for his opinion, but...
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' It's very simple. Instead of focusing on the amount of material you would like to teach, focus on the amount the student would be able to remember.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 07.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Wow, you actually showed up! I could probably count the number of times you've actually come to gatherings like this on just one hand.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' It's still more than the number of times you've managed to get a proposal approved on the first try.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 08.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Hmph, as long as you're still aware. So, what made the difference this time? Are you looking to drink your sorrows away with some friends?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' That's your purpose for being here, not mine. Don't project your ways of thinking onto me.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 09.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' So you're saying the only reason you came is to help Tighnari with his brainstorming?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Precisely. Collei will have a long road in front of her.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 10.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Hey, just to get one thing clear, even if Collei manages to make her way to the Akademiya, we cannot let her enroll in Haravatat! Kshahrewar is obviously the best choice for her. She's been a trainee forest ranger for so long, she'll definitely be good with her hands.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' What are you saying? Spantamad is the better choice. It's where I graduated from, after all.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 11.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Then what about Amurta? That's the Darshan her master actually graduated from.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 alhaitham 05.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' There are only two other Darshans left. We might as well select all of them on her enrollment application.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 12.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' You...! I'm trying to have a serious discussion here!
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 13.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' {{Traveler}}, you aren't associated with any of the six Darshans. In your opinion, which Darshan would be the best choice for Collei?
:{{DIcon}} I think she should get through the second phase of her studies first.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Well said.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 12.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Agreed. And my goal in inviting you here was to gather some thoughts on the execution of this second phase.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 alhaitham 06.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Phase two far exceeds phase one in both curriculum complexity and the speed of instruction. I hope Collei has prepared herself for what is coming.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 14.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Hey, what are you thinking now? Please don't tell me you're planning on lending her those abstruse books from your home library.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 alhaitham 07.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Actually, I was thinking about lending her a professions guide.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 15.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I'll make sure to write "DON'T BECOME AN ARCHITECT" on the front page of that.
:{{DIcon}} But don't you love your job, Kaveh?
:;(+1 Heart)
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 16.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Hehe. You're right, I can't deny that.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Is there another phase after phase two? What's the ultimate goal of all of this? Are we trying to prepare her for a job in the Akademiya?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 13.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Ah, we don't need to think that far ahead. Hold that thought, though. I think my vegetables are done...
:{{Black Screen|Everyone enjoys a relaxed and pleasant dinner...}}
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 17.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I'm telling you, that client had no idea what he was talking about! No matter what I did, he had something bad to say about it!
:{{DIcon}} (Kaveh sure gets drunk fast...)
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 14.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Have you considered finding another client?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 18.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Ah, they're all the same. I haven't had a good night's sleep for months now! Hmph, who do they think they are, ordering me to alter my design over and over again just because they have some Mora?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 alhaitham 08.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' It's too late now to change careers. You might as well try to find some joy in the pain.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 alhaitham 09.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Besides, you'll be getting up in the middle of the night to make edits to your own design even when the client doesn't request it.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 19.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' No... *hic*&nbsp;...that's not true!
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Cheer up, Kaveh. I'll tell you a new joke.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 tighnari 15.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' We'll save that for the end, Cyno. You can keep it to yourself until then.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907703 kaveh 20.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I... Whatever! I'm not going to use my brain anymore! Let's drink tonight to our hearts' content!
