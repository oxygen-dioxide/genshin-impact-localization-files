|text      = With each passing year, as winter deepens and all things grow quiet, [[Liyue Harbor]] takes on a livelier spirit than usual.

On the streets, travelers come and go &mdash; some hurrying through the cold toward the warmth of home, some strolling with laughter to savor the festive sights, and others preoccupied with selecting gifts for the season.

Each follows their own path, their directions varied, yet all drawn by the same yearning for reunion.

Slowly steeping the moments, gently simmering the years, food has always been a vessel for emotions and memories, as well as an irreplaceable centerpiece of unity. If time allows, why not return to [[Liyue]]? Like myself, I am certain there are many friends and kin who await the chance to glimpse a familiar face along its bustling streets.

I imagine that you have gathered a wealth of culinary expertise in your many travels. Should you choose to grace us with a taste of your skills, I have no doubt this winter would feel all the more complete.

The water is on the cusp of boiling. I await your company, where stories and warmth await to be shared.
