;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo hseq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Time to meet up with everyone again! We need to go to Pardis Dhyai.
:{{A|vo hseq003 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' C'mon, let's go check how the preparations are going!

;(Approach Pardis Dhyai)
:{{A|vo hseq003 2 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...Maybe she overslept?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 2 tighnari 01.ogg}}  -->'''Tighnari:''' I don't know... That has never happened before.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 2 candace 01.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Did anyone see her on the way here?
:{{A|vo hseq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're here! Huh? What's got you all looking so worried?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 2 candace 02.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Miss Nilou isn't here yet.
:{{A|vo hseq003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, maybe she's just running late?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 2 tighnari 02.ogg}}  -->'''Tighnari:''' That's not like her. She's come early every other time we've met. Besides, Cyno went to the [[Grand Bazaar]] to meet up with her before the meeting...
:{{A|vo hseq003 2 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' But, I was told she had left first thing this morning.
:{{A|vo hseq003 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And now, Cyno's here, but Nilou's still nowhere to be found...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 2 candace 03.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' That's exactly why we're worried.
:{{DIcon}} Any progress with the robbery case?
:{{A|vo hseq003 2 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' We interrogated the people in charge of the caravan on the day of the incident...
:{{A|vo hseq003 2 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' But, they were technically the victims of the case, and all their goods were lost, so there was no evidence to investigate.
:{{A|vo hseq003 2 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Their goods are certainly suspicious, but until we recover them, all we can do is to observe the caravan under the guise of protection.
:{{A|vo hseq003 2 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' We contacted the original seller of the gem. Apparently, he sold the other half to a young man in the desert, but that's all he could tell us.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 2 tighnari 03.ogg}}  -->'''Tighnari:''' So, to summarize &mdash; the location of the "hazardous materials" and the second gem are a complete mystery, and now Nilou is missing as well.
:{{A|vo hseq003 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, you think Nilou's disappearance is connected to all this?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 2 tighnari 04.ogg}}  -->'''Tighnari:''' We're still not sure if the three events are connected, but if they are... It would probably have something to do with Nilou's Dance of Sabzeruz.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 2 tighnari 05.ogg}}  -->'''Tighnari:''' The Dance is a key part of the Festival. If someone was trying to sabotage the celebrations, Nilou would be a natural target.
:{{A|vo hseq003 2 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...
:{{A|vo hseq003 2 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' {{Traveler}}, Candace, there's no time to waste. Let's try to follow her trail.
:{{A|vo hseq003 2 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Tighnari, can you stay back and explain the situation to everyone when they arrive?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 2 tighnari 06.ogg}}  -->'''Tighnari:''' Of course. It's still possible Nilou was simply held up by something urgent. I'll wait here.

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo hseq003 3 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Let's start with the Grand Bazaar. We should ask around for clues.

;(Talk to [[Tighnari]], optional)
:<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 tighnari 01.ogg}}  -->'''Tighnari:''' You should go. I'll wait here.

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Tighnari, optional)
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 2 tighnari 07.ogg}}  -->'''Tighnari:''' (Where could she be...?)

;(Talk to [[Rashnu]] near the [[Crafting Bench]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog hseq003 rashnu 01.ogg}} '''Rashnu:''' *snore*... Nilou's... not coming anymore... *snore*...
:{{A|vo dialog hseq003 rashnu 02.ogg}} '''Rashnu:''' She's... dancing... *snore*...

;(Approach [[Sheikh Zubayr]])
:{{A|vo hseq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mr. Zubayr!
:{{A|vo hseq003 3 sheikhzubayr 01.ogg}} '''Sheikh Zubayr:''' Oh, hello. Did you need something?
:{{A|vo hseq003 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're looking for Nilou. Do you know where she is?
:{{A|vo hseq003 3 sheikhzubayr 02.ogg}} '''Sheikh Zubayr:''' Nilou? She left bright and early this morning. Said she had to help out a friend.
:{{A|vo hseq003 3 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Was she by herself? And did you happen to see which gate she used to leave the city?
:{{A|vo hseq003 3 sheikhzubayr 03.ogg}} '''Sheikh Zubayr:''' She definitely left alone. As for the direction... I think she left through the gate to the north.
:{{A|vo hseq003 3 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...So, the complete opposite direction of Pardis Dhyai.
:{{A|vo hseq003 3 sheikhzubayr 04.ogg}} '''Sheikh Zubayr:''' Did something happen? This is no time for practical jokes, you know.
:{{A|vo hseq003 3 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Mr. Zubayr, could you send word to Pardis Dhyai if Nilou comes back to the Grand Bazaar?
:{{A|vo hseq003 3 sheikhzubayr 05.ogg}} '''Sheikh Zubayr:''' Of course. I'm sure she just got caught up in something. Still, let me know when you find her.
:{{A|vo hseq003 3 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' We will.
:{{A|vo hseq003 3 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Alright, let's leave through the north gate and see what we can find.

;(Talk to Sheikh Zubayr, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog hseq003 sheikhzubayr 01.ogg}} '''Sheikh Zubayr:''' Be on your way, now. Don't waste any more time.

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Sheikh Zubayr, optional)
:{{A|vo hseq003 3 sheikhzubayr 06.ogg}} '''Sheikh Zubayr:''' (*sigh*... I hope nothing bad happened to her...)

;(Approach [[Nevida]])
:{{A|vo hseq003 4 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Miss Nevida, have you seen Nilou this morning?
:{{A|vo hseq003 4 nevida 01.ogg}} '''Nevida:''' Nilou? Oh, yes! I saw her head out of the city. She was wearing [[Breeze of Sabaa|the prettiest outfit]]...
:{{A|vo hseq003 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Which way did she go?
:{{A|vo hseq003 4 nevida 02.ogg}} '''Nevida:''' That way, I believe.
:{{A|vo hseq003 4 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Was there anyone following her? Did everything look okay?
:{{A|vo hseq003 4 nevida 03.ogg}} '''Nevida:''' I mean, it looked like she was in a good mood. She even stopped to say hello. And no... I didn't see anyone else.
:{{A|vo hseq003 4 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Alright, thank you.

;(Approach the guards by the gate)
:{{A|vo hseq003 5 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Excuse me, have any of you seen Miss Nilou from Zubayr Theater come this way?
:{{A|vo hseq003 5 rukn 01.ogg}} '''Rukn:''' Yes, General. I saw Miss Nilou cross the bridge after leaving the city this morning. There was a man waiting for her on the other side.
:{{A|vo hseq003 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, could that be the person who bought the second gem!?
:{{A|vo hseq003 5 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Did you see the man's face?
:{{A|vo hseq003 5 rukn 02.ogg}} '''Rukn:''' Unfortunately, no. He was too far away.
:{{A|vo hseq003 5 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...Understood. If she comes back this way, tell her to find me at Pardis Dhyai.
:{{A|vo hseq003 5 rukn 03.ogg}} '''Rukn:''' Yes, General!
:{{A|vo hseq003 5 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Let's keep going.

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo hseq003 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The trail ends here... and there's no one else we can ask for clues.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 6 candace 01.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' There are intersecting sets of footprints on the ground. We could try tracking some of them...
:{{A|vo hseq003 6 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' With this many traces, it's easy to get mixed up. Let me take a closer look...
:;(An Aranara peeks out from behind a rock)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Wait! That figure, it's...)
:{{DIcon}} Excuse me for a moment, you two.
:{{A|vo hseq003 6 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Sure. We'll continue analyzing the footprints over here.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 6 candace 02.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Tell us right away if you find anything.

;(Talk to Candace or Cyno, optional)
:<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 candace 01.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Judging by the traces, they must have turned left...
:{{A|vo dialog hseq003 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' It's easy to get mixed up with this many footprints. We need to be thorough.

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Candace, optional)
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 6 candace 03.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' (Where could this lead...)

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Cyno, optional)
:{{A|vo hseq003 6 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' (A man in the desert...)

;(Approach [[Arasaka]])
:{{A|vo hseq003 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Arasaka! It's you!
:'''Arasaka:''' ...Eek! It's the nice Golden Nara! Arasaka... must hide!
:{{A|vo hseq003 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Why would you need to hide? We're friends, aren't we?
:'''Arasaka:''' Friends... Arasaka is friends with the Golden Nara, but... [[Arapas]] said Arasaka can't talk to too many people right now.
:{{A|vo hseq003 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, why?
:'''Arasaka:''' He thinks Arasaka will let everything slip by accident...
:'''Arasaka:''' Eek! Arasaka shouldn't say any more!
:{{A|vo hseq003 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let things slip, huh... Okay, we just have one question. Did you see a girl walk by?
:{{DIcon}} A Nara with red hair.
:{{DIcon}} A Nara like a beautiful flower.
:'''Arasaka:''' A red Nara who's pretty like a [[padisarah]]? Yes, Arasaka saw that Nara!
:{{A|vo hseq003 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Which way did she go?
:'''Arasaka:''' She went towards a messy pile of rocks with another Nara, but Arasaka doesn't know them.
:{{A|vo hseq003 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A messy pile of rocks?
:{{DIcon}} Probably the ruins near the [[Fane of Ashvattha]].
:{{A|vo hseq003 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! That makes sense. Thank you, Arasaka!
:'''Arasaka:''' Arasaka is happy to help kind Golden Nara. Kind Golden Nara has helped Arasaka in the past.
:{{A|vo hseq003 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Arasaka, about the other thing you mentioned...
:'''Arasaka:''' Eek! Arasaka doesn't know anything! Arasaka won't say anything else!
:{{A|vo hseq003 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah...! Guess that ends this conversation...
:{{A|vo hseq003 7 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, let's tell Cyno and Candace what we learned.

;(Approach Candace and Cyno)
:{{A|vo hseq003 8 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...The Fane of Ashvattha?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 8 candace 01.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' The footprints lead in that direction as well.
:{{A|vo hseq003 8 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Where did you get this information?
:{{A|vo hseq003 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, uh... we were tipped off by some friends. We can vouch for the information!
:{{A|vo hseq003 8 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Alright, I trust you.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 8 candace 02.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Let's go after them. Hopefully... Ugh! Ah...
:{{A|vo hseq003 8 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Another vision?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 8 candace 03.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Yes... But this time, I only heard faint voices.
:{{DIcon}} What did they say?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 8 candace 04.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' It sounded like two people having a conversation... There was someone asking, "will she find out," and something about "following the tracks"...
:{{A|vo hseq003 8 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Was Nilou one of the voices?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 8 candace 05.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' I couldn't tell. The voices were too muffled.
:{{A|vo hseq003 8 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Hmm... Let's head towards the ruins for now. The vision could mean we're on the right track.

;(Approach the ruins)
:{{A|vo hseq003 9 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' We should be getting close.
:{{A|vo hseq003 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This area is usually full of [[Treasure Hoarders]]. Nilou could be in danger...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 9 candace 01.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Look over there!
:{{A|vo hseq003 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's Nilou! Heyyyyyy!
:{{A|vo hseq003 9 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I don't think she can hear us. We're too far away.
:{{A|vo hseq003 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' C'mon, let's go!

;(Approach the marked area)
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 10 sethos 01.ogg}}  -->'''???:''' Wow, can't believe we've walked this far already...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 10 nilou 01.ogg}}  -->'''Nilou:''' We should be getting close, right?
:{{A|vo hseq003 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nilouuuuuu!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 10 nilou 02.ogg}}  -->'''Nilou:''' Huh!?
:{{A|vo hseq003 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nilou! We knew there was a bad guy with you! Leave her alone, you... Huh?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 10 sethos 02.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' Uh, by "bad guy"... Do you mean me?
:{{Introductory Note|Sethos}}
:{{A|vo hseq003 10 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...What are you doing here?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 10 sethos 03.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' Am I not supposed to be here?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 10 nilou 03.ogg}}  -->'''Nilou:''' What are you guys doing here?
:{{A|vo hseq003 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Can't we stick to one question at a time? Oh, wait... that one doesn't count...
:{{A|vo hseq003 10 sorush 01.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' What dreadful cacophony! Are we not allowed a quiet place to practice?
:{{Introductory Note|Sorush}}
:{{A|vo hseq003 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[Sorush]]!?
:{{DIcon}} Good to see you again!
:{{A|vo hseq003 10 sorush 02.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' Ah, Pale Floater! And my Yasnapati!
:{{A|vo hseq003 10 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' You know this red floating being?
:{{A|vo hseq003 10 sorush 03.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' Excuse you! I, Sorush, am a noble [[Pari]], and the Bloomguard of [[Khvarena]]!
:{{A|vo hseq003 10 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Sorush is a Pari we met in the [[Vourukasha Oasis]]. She's really nice. You just have to get used to the way she talks.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 10 candace 01.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Huh? Mr. Sethos, that item on your person...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 10 sethos 04.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' Oh, you mean this cracked Wedjat Eye?
:[[File:Give Her Memories Gemstone.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo hseq003 10 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, you were the one who bought the other gem!
:{{A|vo hseq003 10 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' A Wedjat Eye, Pari... Sounds like something I've read about before...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 10 sethos 05.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' Then, you can probably guess what really happened.
:{{A|vo hseq003 10 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Now's not the time for riddles. Everyone in the city is still worried about Nilou.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 10 nilou 04.ogg}}  -->'''Nilou:''' Worried about me? But, I left a message for everyone...
:{{A|vo hseq003 10 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Message? What message...?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 10 candace 02.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' We never received anything like that.
:{{A|vo hseq003 10 sorush 04.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' Don't tell me Rashnu fell asleep halfway there... again!
:{{A|vo hseq003 10 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hearing that name, this is all starting to check out...
:{{A|vo hseq003 10 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Who's Rashnu?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 10 nilou 05.ogg}}  -->'''Nilou:''' The Pari that was supposed to pass on my message. She did look really tired earlier...
:{{A|vo hseq003 10 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hold on! Let's take this one thing at a time... First, what are you guys doing here?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 10 sethos 06.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' Well, that explanation starts with the first time I met Sorush.
;(A flashback begins)
:{{A|vo hseq003 11 mihir 01.ogg}} '''Mihir:''' Sorush, they're here.
:{{A|vo hseq003 11 sorush 01.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' Hmph! I've had enough of these insufferable rascals! Wreaking havoc in the desert right and left!
:{{A|vo hseq003 11 rashnu 01.ogg}} '''Rashnu:''' *snore*... *snore*... *snore*...
:{{A|vo hseq003 11 sorush 02.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' Wake up, Rashnu! We need to teach them a lesson, or we'll never get another good night's sleep!
:{{A|vo hseq003 11 rashnu 02.ogg}} '''Rashnu:''' *snore*... *snore*... *snore*...
:{{A|vo hseq003 11 sorush 03.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' ...
:{{A|vo hseq003 11 mihir 02.ogg}} '''Mihir:''' I'll trap them with my thorns when they pass by, and you can take care of the rest.
:{{A|vo hseq003 11 sorush 04.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' Perfect! They don't stand a chance!
:{{A|vo hseq003 11 sorush 05.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' Let's give them a taste of sheer terror!
:{{A|vo hseq003 11 yakup 01.ogg}} '''Yakup:''' ...

;(If Sorush flies too low)

:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 13 sethos 01.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' They've probably had enough, don't you think?
:{{A|vo hseq003 13 sorush 02.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' Who might you be?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 13 sethos 02.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' The name's Sethos. I was out for a walk when I heard the commotion, so I came to check it out.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 13 sethos 03.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' Since you already destroyed their goods, I'd say you can stop here. These kinds of situations can easily get out of hand.
:{{A|vo hseq003 13 sorush 03.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' Brazen youth, have you any idea to whom you speak?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 13 sethos 04.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' The Bloomguard, Sorush &mdash; renowned among the Pari. All children of the desert know your name.
:{{A|vo hseq003 13 sorush 04.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' So, you're not entirely ignorant after all... Fine &mdash; I'm willing to call it a day.
:{{A|vo hseq003 13 sorush 05.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' But if those scoundrels continue to disrupt the peace of this land, I will show no mercy!

:{{A|vo hseq003 14 sorush 01.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' Sethos fulfilled his duty well. I have come here for a monumental task!
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What task?
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 sorush 02.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' I heard Lesser Lord Kusanali is currently celebrating her birthday in the city. As her familiars, the Pari have decided to bestow upon her a special gift!
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 sorush 03.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' As decided by Elder [[Zurvan]], the Bloomguard of the Pari &mdash; that would be me &mdash; will present the Dance of Sabzeruz to Lesser Lord Kusanali, a tradition passed down over the centuries.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 sethos 02.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' I told Sorush the dancer was already decided, but she insisted on meeting Nilou in person.
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 sorush 04.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' Good thing I did! How was I to know the current version is nothing like the original!
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, there are bound to be changes over the centuries...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 nilou 01.ogg}}  -->'''Nilou:''' I was so excited to see the original version, I begged Miss Sorush to teach me.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 nilou 02.ogg}}  -->'''Nilou:''' It's such a rare opportunity! If I present this special version at the Sabzeruz Festival, I'm sure the Dendro Archon will love it! And all the spectators, too!
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 sorush 05.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' I appreciated young Nilou's determination, so I invited her here to practice in peace.
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, that's what happened...
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Feels like we've been chasing bad guys for days, but in the end, there were no bad guys at all! It was all for Nahida's surprise!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 sethos 03.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' Hold on, don't forget about the guys with the "fireworks." You still haven't figured out what they were up to.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 candace 01.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Wreaking havoc in the desert, trying to turn a profit by illegally excavating ruins and tombs... That's my guess.
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' That would explain why they chose a remote path away from [[Aaru Village]]. They're lucky you didn't catch them in the act...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 candace 02.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Heh, a few moments with me, and they'd be begging for their days of baking in the hot sun...
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay... remind Paimon not to get on Candace's bad side...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 sethos 04.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' By the way, Miss Candace, I noticed you're carrying the other half of the Wedjat Eye.
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh yeah! What exactly is this thing?
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' It was a gift from [[King Deshret]] to Lesser Lord Kusanali.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (It probably belonged to [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]], actually. But, given what happened to [[Irminsul]]...)
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 sethos 05.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' That's right. So you've read the legend, too.
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I only know the basics. I never thought these two gems could be connected to the relic from the legend.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 sethos 06.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' I only bought the gem because it seemed like there was something special about it. The legend didn't come into play until I checked certain texts back at the [[Temple of Silence]].
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 sethos 07.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' Legend has it that King Deshret and the Goddess of Flowers, [[Nabu Malikata|Lady Malikata]], both prepared surprise gifts for Lesser Lord Kusanali during the first Sabzeruz Festival.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 sethos 08.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' They scattered candy along a path to lead her toward the site of the banquet.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 sethos 09.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' Eventually, she arrived at a lake, where she heard the sound of music. Lord Al-Ahmar was plucking the strings of an instrument while Lady Malikata performed a beautiful dance.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 sethos 10.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' Together, the two extended their heartfelt wishes to their dear friend, and each bestowed upon her a precious gift...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 sethos 11.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' Lady Malikata gave her the Khvarena to protect the rainforest, and Lord Al-Ahmar gave her the Wedjat Eye to record the moments they shared together.
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' But, the Wedjat Eye was lost after the [[cataclysm]] in [[Khaenri'ah]], buried deep beneath the sands.
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 sorush 06.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' And Lesser Lord Kusanali turned the Khvarena into a [[Simurgh|divine bird]], tasked with guarding the border between new birth and death... until the bird shattered into pieces and gave rise to the Pari.
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, Candace actually saw things recorded by the Wedjat Eye!
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 sethos 12.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' I was definitely surprised it still has the power to record events after all this time.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 sethos 13.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' Its power seems to only resonate with the people of Al-Ahmar, also {{sic|know as}} the descendants of King Deshret.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 sethos 14.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' Despite the damage, it still holds many scenes from the past.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 candace 03.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' (The faint voices I heard earlier... Could it actually have been Lord Al-Ahmar and the Goddess of Flowers?)
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 candace 04.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' What do you plan to do with the two pieces of the Eye?
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 sethos 15.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' If you don't mind, I'd like to place them under the custody of the Temple of Silence.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 candace 05.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' I agree with that decision.
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 sorush 07.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' Technically, the Eye belongs to Lesser Lord Kusanali. Why don't you just give it back?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (...)
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 candace 06.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' I'm not sure that would be wise...
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 candace 07.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Even if she remembers the story, I fear all that remains in this fragmented piece of memory... is grief.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (A record of sad memories... As Nahida's friend, I don't want her to feel sad on her birthday.)
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 sorush 08.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' I don't fully understand your reasoning, but if this is the decision of the group, as well as my Yasnapati, then I shall object no further.
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 sorush 09.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' Well, are you going to let me teach the girl the Dance of Sabzeruz, or do you intend to drag this on incessantly!?
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She's got a point. Now that we know it was all a false alarm, let's go back and tell everyone what happened. They're probably worried.
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I'll tell the other matra to keep an eye out for that caravan. If we find any evidence of any misconduct, we won't let them off lightly.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 sethos 16.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' Guess I'll stay here, then. There's a bunch of monsters nearby, so it's always good to have someone stand guard.
:<!-- {{A|vo hseq003 14 nilou 03.ogg}}  -->'''Nilou:''' Sorry to make you worry, everyone! I'll head back and help once I'm done learning this dance.
:{{A|vo hseq003 14 sorush 10.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' Focus! No more distractions! Now, follow along!

===Layla===
<!--The dialogue changes from the one in ''[[Give Her Sweetness]]''.-->
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to [[Layla]] in outside of [[Puspa Cafe]])
:<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 layla 01.ogg}}  -->'''Layla:''' Everyone looks so happy... The experience is different from gazing at the starry sky, but still... what a sight to behold.
:{{DIcon}} Layla?
;(If the player talked to Layla previously)
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 layla 02.ogg}}  -->'''Layla:''' Ah, it's you. Layla got a burst of energy after talking with you. She managed to finish her paper before the Festival without sleepwalking even once. But, she crashed as soon as it was submitted.
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 layla 03.ogg}}  -->'''Layla:''' I saw her write this in the acknowledgement section...
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 layla 04.ogg}}  -->'''Layla:''' "Interactions between stars can lend immense strength to involved bodies, to the point where they can even alter preexisting orbits..."
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 layla 05.ogg}}  -->'''Layla:''' "Real life mirrors astronomy in this way. You never know what miracles can be achieved when two people seem to resonate at the same frequency. This author speaks from personal experience."
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 layla 06.ogg}}  -->'''Layla:''' As for me... I'll take a picture to capture this moment and put it on her desk.
;(If the player did not talk to Layla previously)
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 layla 07.ogg}}  -->'''Layla:''' It's me. Layla just managed to submit her paper, so she's resting now.
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 layla 08.ogg}}  -->'''Layla:''' It's a pity she missed this year's Parade. But, her work ethic is truly commendable.
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 layla 09.ogg}}  -->'''Layla:''' I'll take a picture to capture this moment and put it on her desk.

===Wanderer and Sethos===
Wanderer disappears after completing step 1 and will only reappear after completing the quest.
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to [[Wanderer]] and Sethos outside of the Akademiya)
:<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 sethos 02.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' You do know you were invited to the Akademiya party, right? You're really not gonna show your face?
:{{A|vo dialog hseq003 wanderer 01.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Heh, I don't remember doing anything worth getting invited. It's just another noisy room of people... Not my scene.
:<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 sethos 03.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' Look, I'm no scholar, but even I've heard about your work in historical criticism and modern political research.
:<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 sethos 04.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' You provided the clues and inspiration for their big paper. That basically makes you their hero. Your contribution is half the reason they even have something to celebrate.
:{{A|vo dialog hseq003 wanderer 02.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' You'd think someone from the "Temple of Silence" would know when to stop talking...
:<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 sethos 05.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' Okay, okay, I can take a hint. I'm just letting you know, they're gonna drag you there one way or another.
:{{A|vo dialog hseq003 wanderer 03.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' ...You told them where I was?
:<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 sethos 06.ogg}}  -->'''Sethos:''' Hah, believe or not, I do know when to keep my mouth shut. But, since I know you pretty well, they did ask me to come find you.
:{{A|vo dialog hseq003 wanderer 04.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' ...
:{{A|vo dialog hseq003 wanderer 05.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' For the love of... Fine. Show me the way.

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Nahida outside of the Sanctuary of Surasthana)
:<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 nahida 01.ogg}}  -->'''Nahida:''' You're back! Here, let's share this [[Candied Ajilenakh Nut]].
:{{DIcon}} Were you waiting for me?
:<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 nahida 02.ogg}}  -->'''Nahida:''' Hehe, now who's the mind reader?
:{{DIcon}} Did you have a happy birthday?
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 nahida 03a 1.ogg}}  -->'''Nahida:''' Of course! It was amazing! It's like I was surrounded by everyone's kindness and warmth, like a little bird tucked away in a nest.
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 nahida 03a 2.ogg}}  -->'''Nahida:''' I really can't thank everyone enough... the Aranara, the Pari, my dear friends.
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 nahida 03a 3.ogg}}  -->'''Nahida:''' That said... You're still hiding something from me, aren't you?
::{{DIcon}} A&mdash;Am I...?
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 nahida 03a 4.ogg}}  -->'''Nahida:''' Don't worry.
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 nahida 03a 5.ogg}}  -->'''Nahida:''' If you think it should be kept a secret, then I trust your judgment.
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 nahida 03a 6.ogg}}  -->'''Nahida:''' After all, you're my Knight of Flowers.
:{{DIcon}} Did you have a good time at the banquet?
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 nahida 03b 1.ogg}}  -->'''Nahida:''' Of course! Every dish was such a pleasant surprise. I never knew what to expect... like trying to guess the flavor of Yalda Candies before opening the box!
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 nahida 03b 2.ogg}}  -->'''Nahida:''' I wasn't really focused on the food, though. One look at everyone's happy faces, and I was already more than satisfied.
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 nahida 03b 3.ogg}}  -->'''Nahida:''' After all, it's not the food that makes a banquet. It's the company!
:{{DIcon}} I should go...
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 nahida 03c 1.ogg}}  -->'''Nahida:''' Okay! Who knows... Maybe the next time you see me, it'll be in one of your dreams, hehe!

===Sorush and Arasaka===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Sorush and Arasaka in Pardis Dhyai near the fountain)
:{{A|vo dialog hseq003 sorush 02.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' You there, Leaf Hat. I have a question.
:'''Arasaka:''' Arasaka... Leaf Hat?
:{{A|vo dialog hseq003 sorush 03.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' The Pari find it challenging enough to protect the Vourukasha Oasis. How have you managed to protect a domain as vast as the rainforest for hundreds of years?
:'''Arasaka:''' You are not a Nara... You are a bird! Red and warm and small! Arasaka can make you something to eat!
:{{A|vo dialog hseq003 sorush 04.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' A... bird? No, I am a Pari. We live in the Vourukasha Oasis.
:'''Arasaka:''' The Vourukasha Oasis? Like Vanarana... but for a bird?
:{{A|vo dialog hseq003 sorush 05.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' Vana... rana? Something tells me this conversation is going nowhere...
:'''Arasaka:''' Little red bird is a good bird! Good birds can come to Vanarana. Arasaka will make you delicious food.
:'''Arasaka:''' We can practice [[Ararakalari]] together, and find lots and lots of "tracer"!
:{{A|vo dialog hseq003 sorush 06.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' Ah... well... okay...
:{{A|vo dialog hseq003 sorush 07.ogg}} '''Sorush:''' (Have I been stuck at the Oasis for too long? It's like I can't understand the language of the outside world anymore... Whatever he said sounded impressive, though.)

:<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 candace 02.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' I hope the sand didn't get into your sleeves, Traveler. Here, have a seat.
:{{DIcon}} Are you busy?
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 candace 03a 1.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' No, I was just practicing an ancient melody. It's beautiful, but I don't know how it ends. That knowledge has been lost to the sands.
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 candace 03a 2.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' I used to play it over and over again, never able to fully complete it.
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 candace 03a 3.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' But tonight, I want to try to give it a suitable ending.
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 candace 03a 4.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Perhaps it's just the festival spirit, but I can't help but feel like certain stories deserve a happy ending...
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 candace 03a 5.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Certain memories remain just as precious, even as they fade with time...
:{{DIcon}} Back so soon?
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 candace 03b 1.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' Sounds like our Knight of Flowers hasn't had enough of the festivities.
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 candace 03b 2.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' But, Aaru Village is where I truly belong.
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 candace 03b 3.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' I had a wonderful time with everyone, but I don't mind returning to my daily life.
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 candace 03b 4.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' This is no time to be sad.
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 candace 03b 5.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' You see? Look at the sky... Another beautiful day is just around the corner.
:{{DIcon}} I've got something else to do right now...
::<!-- {{A|vo dialog hseq003 candace 03c 1.ogg}}  -->'''Candace:''' In any case, even when the festivities end, that joy stays with us.
