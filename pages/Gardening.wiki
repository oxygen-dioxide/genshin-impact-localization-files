'''Gardening''' is a subsystem of the [[Serenitea Pot]]. Through it, players can plant and harvest items such as [[Materials]] and [[Local Specialties]].

The [[Seed Dispensary]] can be used to collect seeds to plant. The Seed Dispensary can be unlocked by completing the [[World Quest]] ''[[The Art of Horticulture]]'', after reaching [[Inazuma]] [[Reputation]] level 3.

==Seed Dispensary==
{{Main|Seed Dispensary}}
[[File:Item Seed Dispensary.png|thumb|right|200px|Seed Dispensary Icon]]
The Seed Dispensary allows the player to obtain [[seeds]] when gathering plants. When gathering plants with the Seed Dispensary, each individual plant will yield one seed.

Seeds can also be purchased from the "Creatures of the Realm" section of the [[Realm Depot]].

Seeds can be planted in [[Landform/Field|field]]s inside the [[Serenitea Pot]] and harvested after 2 days and 22 hours. The harvested plants will not yield seeds.

While different fields with different seeds can be placed in each realm, swapping realm layouts will cause all planted seeds in the previous realm to stop growing. Effectively, only the plants in the player's active realm will grow, preventing simultaneous harvests across all owned realms. Swapping realms will not remove any progress or destroy any plants.

Each seed will grow into one instance of the construct that yields plants in the wild. For example, because [[Valberry|Valberries]] are found in bunches of 4 in the wild, each [[Valberry Seed]] will yield a bush of 4 Valberries.

Seeds that yield more than one plant per seed can be used to obtain most of the achievements in [[A Realm Beyond: Series III]] faster. The following seeds yield more than one plant per seed:
* ×2: [[Silk Flower Seed]], planted on [[A Path of Value: Luxuriant Glebe]]
* ×2: [[Harra Fruit Seed]], planted on [[A Path of Value: Jade Field]]
* ×3: [[Jueyun Chili Seed]], planted on [[A Path of Value: Jade Field]]
* ×4: [[Valberry Seed]], planted on [[A Path of Value: Jade Field]]
* ×4: [[Zaytun Peach Seed]], planted on [[A Path of Value: Jade Field]]

However, there is no way to speed up the achievement ''[[Stop! Gather Time.]]'', which requires [[A Path of Value: Orderly Meadow]].

After planting the seeds, the field will indicate the time remaining before harvest.

Once the plants have grown, they will appear as collectible items in the field. After harvesting, the player will then have the option to plant once again.

==Fields==
Fields can be bought from [[Tubby]] in the "Riches of the Realm" section of the [[Realm Depot]], and one additional [[Luxuriant Glebe]] field is earned from ''[[The Art of Horticulture]]''. Up to 4 seeds can be planted in each plot at a time. Seeds take 2 days and 22 hours to fully grow.

Fields can be cleared before the plants are fully grown, but the seeds will not be returned.

Guests cannot harvest plants from the owner's realm.
