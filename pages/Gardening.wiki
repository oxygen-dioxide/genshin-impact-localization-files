'''Gardening''' is a subsystem of the [[Serenitea Pot]]. Through it, players can plant and harvest items such as [[Materials]] and [[Local Specialties]].

The [[Seed Dispensary]] can be used to collect seeds to plant. The Seed Dispensary can be unlocked by completing the [[World Quest]] "[[The Art of Horticulture]]."

==Seed Dispensary==
{{Main|Seed Dispensary}}
[[File:Item Seed Dispensary.png|thumb|right|200px|Seed Dispensary Icon]]
The Seed Dispensary allows the player to obtain seeds when gathering plants. When gathering plants with the Seed Dispensary, each individual plant will yield one seed. A list of seeds that can be obtained with the dispensary can be found here: [[Serenitea Pot Materials#Gardening Materials|Seeds]].

Seeds can also be purchased from the "Creatures of the Realm" section of the [[Realm Depot]].

Seeds can be planted in fields inside the [[Serenitea Pot]] and harvested after 2 days and 22 hours. The harvested plants will not yield seeds.

While different fields with different seeds can be placed in each realm, it is of note that swapping realm layouts will cause all planted seeds in the current realm to stop growing. Effectively, only the plants the current realm is set to will grow, preventing simultaneous harvests across all owned realms.
Swapping realms won't lose any growth progress.

Each seed will grow into one instance of the construct that yields plants in the wild. For example, because [[Valberry|Valberries]] are found in bunches of 4 in the wild, each [[Valberry Seed]] will yield a bush of 4 Valberries.

Seeds that yield more than one plant per seed can be used to obtain most of the achievements in [[A Realm Beyond: Series III]] faster. The following seeds yield more than one plant per seed:
* [[Silk Flower Seed]], planted on [[A Path of Value: Luxuriant Glebe]]
* [[Jueyun Chili Seed]], planted on [[A Path of Value: Jade Field]]
* [[Valberry Seed]], planted on [[A Path of Value: Jade Field]]

When initially planted the field will indicate the time remaining before harvest.

After the plants have grown, they will appear as collectible items in the field. After harvesting, the player will then have the option to plant once again.

==Fields==
Fields can be bought from [[Tubby]] in the "Riches of the Realm" section of the [[Realm Depot]], and one additional [[Luxuriant Glebe]] field is earned from "[[The Art of Horticulture]]." Up to 4 seeds can be planted in each plot at a time. Seeds take 2 days and 22 hours to fully grow.

Fields can be cleared before the plants are fully grown, but the seeds will not be returned.

Guests cannot harvest plants from the owner's realm.
