;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, task for the day &mdash; meet the tribespeople and take some heat off of Kinich's back!

;(Approach Huni and Toba)
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 toba 01.ogg}} '''Toba:''' Huni! How can you call the [[Kongamato|Mountain King]] a monster?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 huni 01.ogg}} '''Huni:''' Because he hurt a lot of people! And look what happened to [[Nanna]]...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 toba 02.ogg}} '''Toba:''' But it wasn't on purpose! The Mountain King is sick, that's all. He's been hurt by the [[Abyss]].
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 huni 02.ogg}} '''Huni:''' That's true, but the fact remains that he's now a threat to all of us!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 toba 03.ogg}} '''Toba:''' How can you be so harsh to someone who's sick? If you don't take back what you just said, I don't know if we can carry on being friends!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Toba... Huni... What's wrong?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 toba 04.ogg}} '''Toba:''' Huni's saying nasty things about the Mountain King! It's not right, he's our hero!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 huni 03.ogg}} '''Huni:''' Hmph, once upon a time, maybe. But not anymore.
:{{DIcon}} Hey now, let's not fight. Aren't you best friends?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 toba 05.ogg}} '''Toba:''' Hmph, yesterday, maybe. But not anymore!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 huni 04.ogg}} '''Huni:''' Toba! Fine... I guess [[Trinidad|my dad]] is right. Things change, and you just have to accept it and move forward.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 huni 05.ogg}} '''Huni:''' As of today, our friendship is over! There's no going back!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh come on, cut it out you two! We have some great news to tell you!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 paimon 04a.ogg}} {{A|vo jnqlq004 1 paimon 04b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}} is gonna be the flame bearer for the next [[Turnfire Night]]! {{MC|m=He|f=She}}'s gonna do a beautiful ceremony and cure the Mountain King's illness for good.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 toba 06.ogg}} '''Toba:''' What? Really?
:{{DIcon}} Of course. I'm an expert at this stuff.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 huni 06.ogg}} '''Huni:''' So that's what my dad wanted to talk to you about?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 huni 07a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 huni 07b.ogg}}--> '''Huni:''' To be fair, from what we saw the other day, you are pretty good at climbing cliffs. Probably just as good as Kinich.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 toba 07.ogg}} '''Toba:''' Wait, speaking of Kinich... Where even is that guy?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 huni 08.ogg}} '''Huni:''' Oh yeah, good question... Is he not coming to the ceremony anymore?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We can get him to come. But if he catches you two fighting again, he won't be happy! He'll be sure to give you both a piece of his mind!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 toba 08.ogg}} '''Toba:''' No, we can't let that happen! I've never even spoken to him before! I can't afford to make such a bad first impression.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 huni 09.ogg}} '''Huni:''' I didn't mean to argue with Toba... All I said was that the Mountain King has done some pretty bad things. He was the one who turned it into a fight.
:{{DIcon}} You two clearly care about each other. The Mountain King can't change that.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! If you weren't friends, there's no way Toba would've come to look for the baby [[Saurian]]s with you.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 huni 10a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 huni 10b.ogg}}--> '''Huni:''' ...Alright, well... Because it's {{Traveler}} and Paimon, and Kinich... I'm sorry, Toba. I'm sorry for all the mean things I said about the Mountain King.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 huni 11.ogg}} '''Huni:''' Dad just really misses Nanna. And I was really upset that she's gone, too...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 toba 09.ogg}} '''Toba:''' Huh? Oh... Uhh...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 toba 10a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 toba 10b.ogg}}--> '''Toba:''' I shouldn't have spoken to you the way I did either. It wasn't very nice of me. For {{Traveler}} and Paimon, Kinich, and for Nanna... I'm sorry too, Huni.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's more like it... Now you're best friends again!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 huni 12.ogg}} '''Huni:''' Guess so... Toba, if I ever say something mean about the Mountain King in the future, I'll make sure I say it to someone else and not you.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 huni 13.ogg}} '''Huni:''' I'd better go buy some colored cloth for my Dad now. He needs it for Turnfire Night. Let's play again some other time.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 huni 14a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 huni 14b.ogg}}--> '''Huni:''' See you, Toba. See you, {{Traveler}} and Paimon.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 toba 11.ogg}} '''Toba:''' Kay, I'll head home as well then... See you next time...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, take care you two...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aww... Even though they said they're sorry, it looks like their friendship isn't as strong as it was before.
:{{DIcon}} Times really are changing.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* ...Let's just hope we can solve this once and for all.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Come on, let's move on.

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What's going on over there? Let's take a look.

;(Approach Thiago)
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey there, what's happening here?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 01.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' A rehearsal, for the Turnfire Night dance.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oooh! There's a dance involved? Paimon wants to learn, too...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 02.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' You don't know it? Ah, I guess you're not from these parts, huh? It's rare to see a new face around the tribe these days &mdash; I thought everyone would be keeping away.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Why do you say that?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 03.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Because of the Turnfire Night, of course. The Mountain King could wake up at any time &mdash; that's why we're holding an emergency ceremony.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 04.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' This isn't one of those fun-and-games festivals. For outsiders, it might even be a little dangerous.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, did you know that the flame bearer this time is actually gonna be an outsider?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 05.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Oh, I did hear about that! It's a first for sure. I would've loved to meet them in person.
:{{DIcon}} Heh... Now you have.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 06.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' What? Oh...! It's you!? Man, oh man... Well, this is a nice surprise.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 07.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' It's funny, I was just thinking that I'll probably miss out on meeting the new flame bearer, since I'm not taking part this time around... Then suddenly, there you are! Must be my lucky day, haha.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're not taking part in Turnfire Night? How come? You're not an outsider too, are you?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 08.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Haha, you must be joking! Watch this...
:{{Color|menu|Thiago sways and twists, and begins to perform a ritual dance...}}
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 09.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Not bad, right? Yeah, I'm considered one of the better-looking guys who dances beneath the Pillars of the Sacred Flame. Been doing it a few years. Always gets the ladies out to watch, haha.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, very impressive! So why did you quit?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 10.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Well, I feel like the whole Mountain King situation is getting more and more precarious. It's just not safe here anymore. One of our elders' Saurian companions even lost her life not long ago.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 11.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' The question is, what are we going to do about this in the long term? But our leaders don't have any answers for us. They're probably too busy fighting about it amongst themselves.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 12.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' The way things are going, it's only a matter of time before it gets violent. So I figured, y'know what? Now's as good a time as any to get away for little while, go do some exploring.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You look a little disappointed...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 13.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Disappointed? Nah. It's a great opportunity to go see the world. As every male Scion of the Canopy knows: Wherever you are and wherever you go, the only way is forwards. We take pride in that. I won't forget my roots.
:{{DIcon}} Fair enough. So what's your plan for the next step?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 14.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Hehe, I managed to get in touch with the [[Saurian Relics Association]]. They gave me a simple test: Find a decent quality relic, and they'll make me a member.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's the Saurian Relics Association?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 15.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' You've never heard of it? It's a group of amateur history enthusiasts who do research on the ancient Saurian era. They're all about collecting relics and remnants from that age.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 16.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Speaking of which, the guy who was flame bearer before you &mdash; I've heard that his Saurian buddy comes from that time.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[Ajaw]]? Ajaw's a relic from an ancient Saurian civilization!?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 17.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Oh! Yeah, him. So you know those two already, huh?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 18.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Then do you know how they met? It was deep inside some mysterious ruin, and they signed a contract there. The association folks say that kind of contract usually comes with a huge, hidden cost.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? That sounds ominous...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 19.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Who knows? But if it's true, Kinich can probably handle it. He knows what he's doing with weighing up contracts and costs and stuff. I doubt he'd make a contract that doesn't benefit him.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 20.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Strangely enough, I actually happened upon a strange mural a while back, and it looked to me like it was depicting a Saurian and a human involved in some kind of Saurian-era contract ritual.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, does that count as a relic then?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 21.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' You bet it does. I was all ready to go take a picture of it and use that as my entry ticket to the association.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 22.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' But after all the Abyssal activity recently, I heard that area's been overrun by monsters. The best laid plans, huh? I'll just have to wait and see if things improve.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 23.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' ...Or... You look like you know your way around a fight... I don't suppose there's any chance you'd be able to help...?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If all you need is to get a picture, that should be pretty achievable, right...? {{Traveler}} deals with monsters all the time, it's a piece of cake.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 24.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Wait, you're seriously gonna help me out?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' C'mon, it's no big deal! Compared to some of the things we've been roped into before, this is nothing.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 25.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' ...[[Pyro Archon]] above, you two have hearts of gold, you know that? You're the kind of people who could dive into the [[Turnfire]], deep in the bowels of the [[Night Kingdom]], and it wouldn't burn a single hair off your head.
:{{DIcon}} I'll take that as a... compliment?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 3 thiago 26.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Of course it is! Alright, come with me, I'll show you the way!
----
;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 4 thiago 01.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' There it is, it's inside these ruins. As you can see, the place is crawling with monsters!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alrighty then. Stay back and take cover, Thiago &mdash; this could get dangerous. We'll take care of them.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 4 thiago 02.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Great minds think alike, haha! I'm not about to cramp your style.

;(Talk to Thiago, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 thiago 01.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' This is far back enough, right? I'm not in the way or anything?

;(Approach the mural after defeating the rifthounds)
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew, that should be the last of them... It's a good thing Thiago had the sense to stay in his hiding place, or things could've gotten really hairy for him.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, look! That's gotta be it, right? Definitely looks like a mural.
:{{DIcon}} It's a little on the small side...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, true... Now that you mention it, most ancient murals take up a whole huge wall. This looks more like someone with a paintbrush got bored and started doodling...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It does match the story he told us, though. There's a Saurian and a human... So is that supposed to be what an ancient contract ritual looked like...?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh, whatever, we're not here to decipher it, just photograph it.

;(Take a picture of the mural)<!--Please adjust the camera angle to take a picture of the complete mural-->
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's a wrap! Let's take it back to Thiago.

;(Approach Thiago)
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 thiago 01.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' You've been robbed!? Oh, Ponche... And I thought my luck was bad.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 ponce 01.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' I put blood, sweat, and tears into that! And now I've got nothing to show for it. Some gap-toothed goon stole it from me!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thiago! Is this the picture you were looking for?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 thiago 02.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Let me take a look... Yep, that's the one! Pyro Archon above, you two are superhumans!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 thiago 03a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 thiago 03b.ogg}}--> '''Thiago:''' Hey, Ponche, come and say hi to these guys. They're gonna be the new flame bearers, and they're tough as nails.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 ponce 02.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' Wait, are you... the {{Traveler}} and Paimon?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 thiago 04.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Huh? You already know each other?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Don't think so...?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 ponce 03.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' My nephew, Toba's been telling everyone about you. He says you're crazy strong, super friendly, that you helped him out, and that you're going to be our flame bearers this Turnfire Night.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohh, so you're Toba's uncle! Great to meet you, Sir!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds like we've managed to make a bit of a name for ourselves, hehe.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 thiago 05a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 thiago 05b.ogg}}--> '''Thiago:''' Toba's not wrong, my friend. These two are honestly some of the nicest, most genuine people I've ever met. Everyone speaks incredibly highly of them. Seriously, if you're comfortable telling them about what happened, I guarantee you they'll sort it out in no time.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 ponce 04.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' Really? All I want is to get the fruits of my labor back...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 thiago 06.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Allow me to explain. Ponche is a well-known scholar within our tribe, author of the widely acclaimed book, "[[Yupanqui]]'s Turnfire." Unfortunately, the book was stolen by a [[Treasure Hoarder]] a few hours ago.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 ponce 05.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' I spent years of my life researching that book... I visited every last ruin, interviewed every descendant of every hero in our history...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 ponce 06.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' On the word "{{Rubi|Malipo|Turnfire}}" alone, I covered at least five different interpretations of the meaning, based on accounts from different villages.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 thiago 07.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' It was an unparalleled masterpiece!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 ponce 07.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' And now it's all gone. That little goon ambushed me during my morning walk. He snatched all of my belongings, including my entire manuscript!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 thiago 08.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' That book was everything to him... it's like they robbed him of his soul when they took it. Look at him, lost and listless... He's a shell of the man he was.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 ponce 08.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' Dear honored guests of our clan... I am but a helpless old student. If only for Toba and Thiago's sake, please help me, I beg of you!
:{{DIcon}} Where were you ambushed?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 thiago 09.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' See what I mean, Ponche? Now you've run into these two, your luck's about to change, big time.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 7 ponce 09.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' I don't know if he's still there, but... Come on, I'll take you!

:{{DIcon}} I dare you to try.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 8 matthias 02.ogg}} '''Matthias:''' Aw, what's this? Brought a little bodyguard with you, huh? Alright, let's see what you've got... Watch this!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 8 matthias 03.ogg}} '''Matthias:''' Eat dirt, suckers!

::;(Continue to below dialogue)

;(Catch Matthias)
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 9 matthias 02.ogg}} '''Matthias:''' Stop, please! By all the warriors, heroes, gods, and kings... I can't run any longer.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 9 matthias 03.ogg}} '''Matthias:''' Please, I don't have your stuff anymore... Have mercy...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh yeah? Well, where is it then?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 9 matthias 04.ogg}} '''Matthias:''' I... threw it away...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You threw it away!?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 9 matthias 05.ogg}} '''Matthias:''' The old bum's bag didn't have a single [[Mora]] in it. Just a tatty old book, worn-out pens, and some old rags.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 9 matthias 06.ogg}} '''Matthias:''' All that time lying in wait was for nothing. I was so mad, I just threw all of it away...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... Is that really the truth? Okay then, where did you throw it away?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 9 matthias 07.ogg}} '''Matthias:''' Same place you found me... I swear on the Pyro Archon, it's the truth! May all my worldly possessions be turned to ash by Turnfire if I'm lying!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, that's a pretty strong oath...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What do we do now? It sounds like he's telling the truth...
:{{DIcon}} Let's go back to where we were and see if we can find anything.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right... Let's hope nobody gets to the book before we do... We'll never get it back then...
:{{Black Screen|Meanwhile, in a hidden cave...}}
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 11 fuchikami 01.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' "...Although the Turnfire is a heroic symbol in Huitztlan, it also comes with the more ominous implication of eventual tragedy..."
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 11 fuchikami 02.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' "...This holds true for all bearers of this [[Ancient Name|ancient name]] in recorded history. Each one of them died of non-natural causes, as if the specter of the Turnfire was always lurking in the background..."
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 11 fuchikami 03.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' "...This appears to suggest the existence of some higher power that is always watching the name-bearer, examining their actions and eventually demanding payment in return. None can escape this payment &mdash; unless, perhaps, they could honestly swear by Turnfire to never make a single mistake in their entire life..."
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 11 fuchikami 04.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' "Yupanqui's Turnfire"... What an incredible work on ancient name philology. I can't believe it was just lying there for me to take.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 11 fuchikami 05.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' Let me see, the author is... Ponche. Nice. A gentleman and a scholar.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 11 ajaw 01.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Silence, book muncher! The Great K'uhul Ajaw will suffer your droning voice no longer!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 11 fuchikami 06.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' Do you truly find no joy at all in perusing such rich historical records?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 11 ajaw 02.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Joy? What joy is there in this pointless drivel?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 11 fuchikami 07.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' Well, it makes a pretty shocking prediction: Every bearer of the ancient name "{{Rubi|Malipo|Turnfire}}" eventually meets a grisly end. Maybe that's the price you pay for the name that means "price"?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 11 ajaw 03.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' What? You're saying, Kinich will die a violent death? ...Mwuhahaha! So I'll finally get to take over his body?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 11 ajaw 04.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' When? When will that glorious day arrive? The Great K'uhul Ajaw demands to know!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 11 fuchikami 08.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' Wow, you are just irredeemable, aren't you? An agent of chaos down to the core. You make us [[Abyss Order]] folks look like saints in comparison.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 11 ajaw 05.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Silence, maggot! To presume that anyone compares your kind with the Great K'uhul Ajaw is sheer vanity! And if that day ever comes, your doom will soon follow.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 11 fuchikami 09.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' Hehe, you don't need to lecture me about doomsday. Here's what I know, based on countless historical texts:
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 11 fuchikami 10.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' All civilizations will be reduced to rubble by the passage of time. From ancient kingdoms, to heavenly thrones, to worlds beyond... There are no exceptions.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 11 fuchikami 11.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' But from the ruins of every civilization, the dust will rise and never settle, thus transcending the confines of time. That "dust" is what we call a civilization's spirit.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 11 fuchikami 12.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' And you, Great K'uhul Ajaw, are one such speck of dust from a bygone age. I've paid dearly for the chance to observe you up close.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 11 fuchikami 13.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' Now, let me take a good look at you. We'll see whether any memories of that age still remain inside you...
:;(Meanwhile at the "Scions of the Canopy")
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're so sorry, Mr. Ponche... But we couldn't find your manuscript anywhere.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 ponce 01.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' Does that mean... All of my hard work was for nothing...?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 thiago 01.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' You gotta stay positive, Ponche. You might've lost the book, but the brains behind it are still intact. Surely you remember the main points, at least?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 ponce 02.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' The whole reason I worked so hard to get it finished before the Turnfire Night is because I hoped that maybe it might help us find a way through these trying times. But now...
:{{DIcon}} You mean... You solved the Mountain King problem?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 ponce 03.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' Well, not exactly. But I thought my research might at least be a starting point...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, really? So what did you find out in your research?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 ponce 04.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' I think the key to all of this lies in the power of "{{Rubi|Malipo|Turnfire}}"...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 thiago 02.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' ...Ponche, you know as well as anyone that ancient names don't hold any real power. Symbolic power doesn't count.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 ponce 05.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' You're right, but "{{Rubi|Malipo|Turnfire}}" may be a special case. Given that it first arose in the era of the First Pyro Archon, it might contain remnants of [[Xbalanque]]'s power.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 thiago 03.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Yeah, I remember that story &mdash; my grandpa told it to me when I was a little kid...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 thiago 04.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Maybe you're the special case... Most kids stop believing in that stuff by your age...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 ponce 06.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' I'm not talking about childhood superstitions here! There is evidence!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 thiago 05.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Like what?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 ponce 07.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' Like the fact that the Mountain King is still alive. Everyone attributes that to the power of the Abyss, but there's more to it than that.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 ponce 08.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' The key factor is that [[Burkina]] summoned the power of "{{Rubi|Malipo|Turnfire}}," at the cost of his own life.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 ponce 09.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' If you don't believe me, then answer me this: How many other creatures can you think of who lived longer, not shorter, after being contaminated by the Abyss?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... {{Traveler}}... Different situation, but similar idea: Doesn't this remind you of the [[Hilichurls|hili]]&mdash;
:{{DIcon}} Shh!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 ponce 10.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' So, I came to the conclusion that "{{Rubi|Malipo|Turnfire}}" must refer to some mysterious ritual involving a tit-for-tat exchange.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 ponce 11.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' It began with the first Pyro Archon, fell with the Grand Alliance, then was buried in the Night Kingdom... And now, it awaits the call of its new bearer.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 thiago 06.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Hey, hey... Sorry to interrupt, Ponche, but you seem to be getting a little over-excited.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 ponce 12.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' I'm sorry... I was originally planning on presenting my findings to Kinich. I'd hoped he would be attending the upcoming ceremony.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Sounds to me like you dreamed up one fanciful theory to support another.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh? Kinich, what are you doing here?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I more or less finished what I was doing, so I came to have a quick catchup. Now a good time?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 ponce 13.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' Kinich! I'm onto something! I haven't worked out all the details, but, but... You have to attend the Turnfire Night!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... So Mr. Ponche here has done a lot of research on the history of the Turnfire, and thinks he might have found a way for you to solve the problem...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I'll be there, Ponche.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 12 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Let's go.

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 13 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Here will do.
:{{DIcon}} Have you found a way to summon a Beastly Rift?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 13 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Yeah. I'd like your help giving it a trial run tomorrow. If that works, we have our plan come Turnfire Night.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 13 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds like you're not considering Ponche's idea...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 13 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' You heard him &mdash; he hasn't worked out the details yet. We need a more practical solution with concrete steps to follow.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 13 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Yet"... Are you saying, you think he might actually be onto something?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 13 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I think it's possible, based on something I know about the war five hundred years ago.

:{{A|vo jnqlq004 13 kinich 05.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Burkina didn't fall to the Abyss &mdash; he was killed by the Mountain King in an episode of madness. In his final moments, Burkina made the fateful decision to not fight back, and instead pass his blood and power onto the Mountain King.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 13 kinich 06.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Maybe he thought the Mountain King was stronger than him, and more valuable to the tribe. Or maybe it was just out of loyalty to his friend.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 13 kinich 07.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Either way, I can believe the Turnfire was involved. Whether you think his sacrifice triggered it, or his fate was sealed from the moment he took the Malipo name... It makes sense to me.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 13 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...How can you drop these truth-bombs with such a straight face...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 13 kinich 08.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' This is what I've gleaned from my many interactions with the Mountain King. His mind is so disordered, it took some time to piece it all together.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 13 kinich 09.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' The story Elder Trinidad told you was the more palatable version of events. The truth is even darker.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 13 kinich 10.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' The Mountain King's mind isn't just disordered. He is suffering, and feels great shame. I believe he wants to be put out of his misery.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 13 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? Then... Then what should we do? Should we grant him his wish?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 13 kinich 11.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Of course not. We should help him move to a new home.
:{{DIcon}} So your goal hasn't changed.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 13 kinich 12.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' It's the only practical solution.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 13 kinich 13.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' The Mountain King is a hero to my tribe &mdash; an object of worship, even. Ending his life would be like desecrating a statue.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 13 kinich 14.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Still, he's been the cause of multiple disasters, and we can't afford to have any more.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 13 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh... Practical solutions hurt Paimon's brain. Can we follow our hearts next time...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 13 kinich 15.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Haha, then let's break for the day. I've already found a suitable venue for tomorrow.

;(Approach Kinich at the marked location after passing time)
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 14 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' You're here. Very punctual.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 14 ajaw 01.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Ohohoho! So, the gruesome twosome come crawling back... Here to make amends after the gross irreverence you displayed last time?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 14 ajaw 02.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Very well! The Almighty Dragonlord, K'uhul Ajaw shall grant you the audience that you seek. Now pucker up, and kiss our feet.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 14 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kinich, didn't you say you found him a teacher? He's just as out-of-control as ever!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 14 ajaw 03.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' No one gets to discipline the Almighty Dragonlord, K'uhul Ajaw! NO ONE!
:{{DIcon}} How do you put up with this behavior?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 14 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Maybe because I've never had a gentle-natured companion like Paimon to compare against.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 14 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' I&mdash;Is that a compliment?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 14 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Yeah. I see what I'm missing out on now. And it's a lot.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 14 ajaw 04.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Kiniiiiiich! We could drown this measly flying ant in one droplet of spit! How dare you compare her to the Almighty Dragonlord, K'uhul Ajaw?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 14 ajaw 05.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Just wait till I possess your dead body! I will commit heinous atrocities! Tear down your legacy! Destroy your reputation! Wreak havoc on your&mdash;
:;(Kinich ignores Ajaw and walks up to place something)
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 14 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, let's get down to business. Once we've opened the Beastly Rift, you're welcome to toss Ajaw in there for a couple days.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 14 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' With pleasure! You don't need to ask twice!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 14 kinich 05.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I got my hands on this device in a trade. It's meant as bait, but it'll also stabilize the Abyssal energy.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 14 kinich 06.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' The Rifthounds will tear through space to get to this. Once they're here, we take them out and claim the rift for ourselves.
:{{DIcon}} How did you get your hands on this?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 14 kinich 07.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' You'll find out soon enough. First, let's try this out.
:;(The device activates)

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 15 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' They'll tear you to pieces given half the chance, so be careful.

;(After defeating the rifthounds)
:{{Black Screen|After you clear the wave of Rifthounds, a more powerful burst of Abyssal energy ripples through the Rift.}}
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh-oh... Are there even bigger ones on the way?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 fuchikami 01.ogg}} '''???:''' You see, Kinich? I'm a man of my word. In fact, I'd say I under-promised and over-delivered. Nifty little gizmo, isn't it?
:{{Introductory Note|Enjou}}
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I take it this is your true form.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 fuchikami 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Now that our deal is complete, it's time to start the next phase of our relationship. I made a promise to the Great K'uhul Ajaw, and now I'm here to seize your body for his use.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 fuchikami 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Cliché, I know &mdash; the hero's trusted partner sells him out to the Abyss in a shocking act of betrayal. Cue bad-guy speech and drawn-out death sequence...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Enjou!?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 fuchikami 04.ogg}} '''???:''' Huh...? HUH!? What are you two doing here? Oh, Mr. Kinich, this is not what we agreed on.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' {{Traveler}}, this is the gift I got you. I know you're looking for intel on the Abyss Order, so I thought he might be of use to you.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' But it looks like you've already met?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, we've met.
:{{DIcon}} I've beaten him up before.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 fuchikami 05.ogg}} '''???:''' Yikes, frosty reception... Gotta say, I kinda pictured this moment going a little differently. Tears of joy welling up in your eyes as you say the words: "It's good to see you again, old friend."
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't be ridiculous... Sounds like you've been reading too many romance novels.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 fuchikami 06.ogg}} '''The Thing Calling Itself "Sanka":''' There we have it. Change is inevitable, and nothing lasts forever. What a pity... Well then, time for you to meet the new me. This time, please call me Sanka.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sanka! Aha, so YOU'RE glasses guy! You tricked Huni and Toba into telling you a bunch of stories!
:{{DIcon}} What's your real name?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 fuchikami 07.ogg}} '''The Thing Calling Itself "Sanka":''' What does it matter? A name is a superficial label, it's what's deep down inside that counts. And I've shown you the deepest parts of me.
:{{DIcon}} You mean the masochistic parts?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That would explain a lot. Why else would you show up here and start acting like a wise guy? You looking for a fight?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 fuchikami 08.ogg}} '''The Thing Calling Itself "Sanka":''' Eh, I'll pass. I do rather like you, as I've said before, but my one quibble is that you really don't know your own strength.
:{{DIcon}} Then what are you doing here?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait... Of course! You're the one behind all the recent Abyss activity! Let Paimon guess, you've been provoking the Mountain King, too?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 fuchikami 09.ogg}} '''The Thing Calling Itself "Sanka":''' Haven't I told you before? I'm not part of the inner circle who do our Highness's bidding. My interests are far more low-stakes.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 fuchikami 10.ogg}} '''The Thing Calling Itself "Sanka":''' I spend my time digging for truth in ancient doodads and books. You really think a benchwarmer like me is capable of more than that?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I investigated him &mdash; he's not connected to the recent events. Just happens to be in the area.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 kinich 05.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' So I struck a deal with him: He helps me summon a Rift, I allow him to do some "historical research."
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 fuchikami 11.ogg}} '''The Thing Calling Itself "Sanka":''' But that's all over, and now Kinich wants to hand me over to you, while I was hoping this would be an opportune moment to whisk away his body.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 fuchikami 12.ogg}} '''The Thing Calling Itself "Sanka":''' That would've given me some more time to study the Great K'uhul Ajaw.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 fuchikami 13.ogg}} '''The Thing Calling Itself "Sanka":''' But now I've run into you, which is just my luck... Or maybe I've incited the wrath of the Turnfire, and this is the price I have to pay. But I don't understand, what did I do wrong?
:{{DIcon}} You tricked Huni and Toba.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 fuchikami 14.ogg}} '''The Thing Calling Itself "Sanka":''' Wait, does that count? Hmm, let me think...
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ajaw, you are the worst of the worst! Colluding with the Abyss Order against Kinich? How could you betray your partner?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 ajaw 01.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' There is no betrayal! The Almighty Dragonlord, K'uhul Ajaw is a partner to no one.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 kinich 06.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Don't worry, I told him to act as bait.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 ajaw 02.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Yes, and you should have picked a bigger fish! The Abyss Order? What a joke! Not even a match for our lowly servant. I put up with this toad's croaking for days, and it was all for nothing!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 kinich 07.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' It looks like your disciplinary measures have been less than effective, Mr. Enjou.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 fuchikami 15.ogg}} '''The Thing Calling Itself "Sanka":''' Eh, what did you expect? Behavioral rehab isn't really our thing. Otherwise, we might as well change our name from the Abyss Order to the Abyss Boarding School.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 ajaw 03.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' The Abysmal Disorder would suit you better. Kinich! Dispose of him! He is of no further use to us.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 kinich 08.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} Be my guest. The Abyss Order is a threat to us all.
::{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 fuchikami 16a 1.ogg}} '''The Thing Calling Itself "Sanka":''' Hey now, I may be a lowly clerk, but don't underestimate me.
:{{DIcon}} Let him go. He'll never amount to much in the Abyss Order anyway.
::{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 fuchikami 16b 1.ogg}} '''The Thing Calling Itself "Sanka":''' You see, this is why I like you. Still, you shouldn't underestimate me just because I'm a lowly clerk.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 fuchikami 17.ogg}} '''The Thing Calling Itself "Sanka":''' I could never beat you in a straight-up fight, but when it comes to running away, I won't lose to anyone.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 fuchikami 18.ogg}} '''The Thing Calling Itself "Sanka":''' Do me a favor and remember how fast I disappear. Maybe then you'll show me a little respect next time.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Darn, he got away again... Couldn't you have stopped him?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 kinich 09.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' It's alright, he's not worth our time and energy. Besides, it seems like he's in debt to a lot of people &mdash; I'm sure they'll keep him busy.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, if you say so... Still, Paimon's kinda surprised that you actually struck a deal with someone from the Abyss Order.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 kinich 10.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' To borrow that guy's words, names are superficial labels. Whether you call it the Abyss Order or anything else, it's a broad generalization at best.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 kinich 11.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Think of it like apples that have fallen from a tree. If you tasted each one, you'd find that they're all at different stages of ripening.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 kinich 12.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Even the unripe fruit blown off its branch before it's fully grown can still be brewed into a fine wine. Everything has its use.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... Well, in that specific sense, maybe Enjou's not such a bad apple. Not rotten to the core, at least.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 ajaw 04.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Of course! Only the Almighty Dragonlord, K'uhul Ajaw is rotten to the core, and evil beyond redemption!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh... So what exactly are you, anyway? You're definitely the evilest little thing Paimon's ever met.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 kinich 13.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Don't worry, he can't hurt a fly.
:{{DIcon}} Because you signed a contract?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 kinich 14.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' You could say that.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... Paimon heard that those kinds of contracts might come with a terrible cost attached... I&mdash;Is that true?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 kinich 15.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Such as? Ajaw watching me like a ravenous vulture?
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 ajaw 05.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Vulture? Vulture!? We are the dragon supreme! Sovereign ruler of the Nation of Flame!
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 kinich 16.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Let's pick this up another time. It's getting kinda late.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 kinich 17.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' You should go back and get some rest. Big day ahead &mdash; tomorrow's Turnfire Night. Time to light the sacred flame and burn away the filth for a legendary five-hundred-year-old warrior.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, yeah... Hearing you lay it out like that is making Paimon a little nervous. For all the work we've put in, it all comes down to tomorrow night. We have to make sure we solve this problem once and for all.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 kinich 18.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Then it can't hurt to say this one more time: Good luck to us both.
:{{DIcon}} Good luck to us both.
:{{A|vo jnqlq004 16 kinich 19.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' See you tomorrow.

;(Talk to Kinich, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' What happened to getting some rest?
:{{DIcon}} I'm still a little anxious about Enjou.
::{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 02a 1.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' You're cautious, like me. I get it. But don't worry &mdash; like I said, I investigated, and I'm confident he has nothing to do with the Mountain King situation.
::{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 02a 2.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Before he got tangled up with us, he was looking into the [[Mare Jivari]]. That's another major part of [[Natlan]]'s history.
::{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 02a 3.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Our ancestor, Burkina once fought a campaign there alongside the five other heroes. But it's not such an easy place to get to these days.
::{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 02a 4.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' That's about all I know, though. I have yet to take a job that involves the Mare Jivari.
:{{DIcon}} I'm pretty curious about Ajaw.
::{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 02b 1.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Heh, Ajaw's piqued your interest, huh? It's true that he's a relic from an earlier Saurian age, but since we're bound to each other by a contract, you can see him as my companion for now.
::{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 02b 2.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I know he can be awful, but don't worry. As long as I'm still around, he can't do that much damage.
::{{DIcon}} ...As long as you're around?
::{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Mhm, that's a key part of the contract. Ajaw has to obey my orders and lend me his power for as long as I live.
::{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' And after I die, Ajaw gets control of my body. That's the price.
::{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 05.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Crazy, isn't it? That was probably the first time I really appreciated what it meant to pay a "price." Then, once I signed the contract, I received the ancient name "{{Rubi|Malipo|Turnfire}}."
::{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 06.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' But that's a whole other story. We can get into it another time, if you're interested.
