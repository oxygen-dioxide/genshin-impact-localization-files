|description   = The HP restored to Wriothesley through Rebuke: Vaulting Fist will be increased to 50% of his Max HP. You must first unlock the Passive Talent "[[There Shall Be a Plea for Justice]]."<br>Additionally, when Wriothesley is healed, if the amount of healing overflows, the following effects will occur depending on whether he is on the field or not. If he is on the field, his ATK SPD will be increased by 20% for 4s. If he is off-field, all of your own party members' ATK SPD will be increased by 10% for 6s. These two methods of increasing ATK SPD cannot stack.
