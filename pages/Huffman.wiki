''(To be added.)''

===Personality===
{{Quote|Oh, do you know Mr. Huffman? He's a very strict knight, not to mention disciplined. He's never asked for my autograph or tried to make conversation. Every time he comes to the Cathedral on official business, his face is a picture of seriousness.|Barbara, [[A Very Special Beverage]]}}

Those who know Huffman have described him to be hardworking and reliable;<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Commission From "That Guy"}}</ref> [[Paimon]] once compared his dedicated attitude as a Knight to the looseness of his superior Captain [[Kaeya]].<ref>{{Ref/VO|Traveler|"About Effort and Reward"}}</ref> The Traveler learns more of his character in the Hangout Event [[Wellspring of Healing]]: [[Albert]] reveals that Huffman joined the Barbara Fan Club as a member. When [[Barbara]] learned of this, she had her autograph delivered to him, noting that he carries himself professionally around her while other fans tend to get carried away. She also tells the Traveler of his strictness and discipline.

Huffman is actively involved in matters concerning the city and its people. Concerned with any issue that comes up and too occupied with other tasks, he seeks the Traveler's help to resolve it. He even shows concern for the safety of other Knights working amidst a crisis.

===Appearance===
Huffman wears one of the standard uniforms of the Knights of Favonius. The uniform consists of a black long-sleeve shirt, horse riding pants, gloves, and brown leather shoulder pads with brass-accented white plate armor worn on top. His vambraces however are black. Wing motifs decorate various parts of the armor along with the Knights of Favonius crest on the breastplate. A sheathed sword hangs from his belt on his left side and a blowing horn hangs from the back of his hip.

===History===
One of [[Klee]]'s stories implies that Huffman has been a Knight of Favonius for at least three years, having interacted with Klee's mother, [[Alice]], before she left Mondstadt.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Klee|1}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/CS|Klee|5}}</ref> He once scolded the both of them, and no doubt that they were causing trouble.
