'''Li Ding''' {{Lang|zh=李丁|zh_rm=Lǐ Dīng}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in the {{Quest|Moulder of Mountains}}.

==Profile==
When the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] head to [[Jueyun Karst]] to seek the [[adepti]] and reveal the truth about [[Rex Lapis]]' death, they encounter Li Ding en route to meet [[Mountain Shaper]]. [[Li Dang]] had been trapped by the [[karst crawler]]s utilized by Mountain Shaper, leading to Li Ding to implore their help in freeing his brother. Afterwards, the two promise to renounce their treasure-hoarding ways.

During [[Hu Tao]]'s [[Character Demo]] "Hu Tao: Let the Living Beware," the two are seen at [[Wuwang Hill]], having obtained a treasure map from [[Bao'er]]. The two are frightened off by Hu Tao, who spooked them by running around the area and using her ghosts to sneak up on them. It is unknown whether the video is set before or after the events of Archon Quest.

===Appearance===
Li has brown hair and wears a dark shirt with brown boots. He wears the outfit of a [[Treasure Hoarders: Raptor]].
