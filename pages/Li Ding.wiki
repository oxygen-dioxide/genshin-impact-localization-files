'''Li Ding''' {{Lang|zh=李丁|zh_rm=Lǐ Dīng}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in Act I of [[Chapter I]]. The Traveler meets him at [[Mt. Hulao]], [[Liyue]].

During the [[Archon Quests|Archon Quest]] "[[Moulder of Mountains]]," he asks the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] to free his brother, [[Li Dang]], from [[Amber Rock|amber]].

==Profile==
Around the time the Traveler and Paimon head to [[Jueyun Karst]] to seek the [[adepti]] and reveal the truth about [[Rex Lapis]]' death, they encounter Li Ding en route to meet [[Mountain Shaper]]. Li Dang had been trapped by the karst crawlers utilized by Mountain Shaper, leading to Li Ding to implore their help in freeing his brother. Afterwards, the two promise to renounce their treasure-hoarding ways.

During [[Hu Tao]]'s character demo trailer, "Hu Tao: Let the Living Beware," the two are seen at [[Wuwang Hill]], having obtained a treasure map from [[Bao'er]]. The two are frightened off by Hu Tao, who spooked them by running around the area and using her ghosts to sneak up on them. It is unclear whether the trailer is set before or after the Archon Quest encounter with them.
