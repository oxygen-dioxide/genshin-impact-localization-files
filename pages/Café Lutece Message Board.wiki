{{Dialogue Start}}
===Introduction===
:'''Café Lutece Message Board:''' This is the message board of Café Lutece. Whether it be your gossip and chit-chat, your deep epiphanies, or perhaps suggestions and feedback for our café, all are welcome to leave a message here.

===Dad with a kid who longs to see Oceanids===
:'''Question:''' "I have a question for everyone. I'm visiting [[Fontaine]] with [[Diether|my kid]], and I don't know where he heard about the [[Oceanid]]s, but he's throwing a tantrum about seeing them."
:'''Question:''' "But the Oceanids disappeared from Fontaine long ago. As a father, should I tell him the truth, or keep making up excuses?"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Just keep lying. Kids get obsessed easily but get over it quickly, he'll forget about it soon. Just play with him, and by the time he gets bored, it'll all be over."
:'''A Third Person's Message:''' "I think you should tell him the truth sooner rather than later. Lies cannot stay with him for his whole life, and rather than being laughed at by others later, his illusions should be gently popped by his father."
:'''Owner's Message:''' "Maybe it's not important that you tell him. What's important is that you're here with him, and that you love him."

===Child who wishes to spend time with his dad===
:'''Childishly Written Message:''' "Though I told [[Dietmar|Daddy]] I wanted to come to Fontaine to see the Oceanids, my teacher said they all left Fontaine a long time ago..."
:'''Childishly Written Message:''' "I just didn't want Daddy to be working all the time, and to use his vacation to spend some time with me. Though I feel a little bit guilty seeing him take looking for the Oceanids so seriously, hehe..."
:'''Childishly Written Message:''' "People of Fontaine of all ages, please tell me, should I tell him the truth. or keep hiding it from him?"

===The serial disappearances of young women===
:'''Message:''' "I heard there's been another disappearance, and it's the same modus operandi as the 'The serial disappearances of young women' case."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Didn't they already get the guy? The [[Marcel (Fontaine)|murderer]] was the former head of the [[Spina di Rosula]], [[Callas]] the Unfaithful, wasn't it?"
:'''Message:''' "I don't think it's that simple, I think there's a conspiracy at work here. Maybe there's no disappearances at all, and it's all an act."
:'''Maison Gardiennage:''' "With regards to the 'The serial disappearances of young women' case, please defer official announcements, and do not engage in baseless speculation or spread groundless rumors. The [[Maison Gardiennage]] reserves the right to use whatever means necessary to arrest the spread of rumors."

===Acrobatic troupes banned from Palais Mermonia===
:'''Message:''' "Take a look at this new law: 'All acrobatic troupes must stay away from the area of the [[Palais Mermonia]].' What could the reasoning possibly be?"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Lady [[Furina]] prances to and fro playing, but poor little artists can't even put on their performances. What a joke."
:'''A Third Person's Message:''' "I don't think Lady Furina has ever breathed fire in front of the Palais Mermonia, resulting in the fire suppression mechanisms being activated and damaging a large number of files."
:'''Owner's Message:''' "Why not go out and walk around a bit more? Even if just to read [[The Steambird]] or something?"

===Menthe sighing===
:'''Message:''' "I discovered that there's a [[Melusine]] who sits there every day, sighing. Has she run into some kind of trouble?"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Are you talking about [[Menthe]]? She's always saying something like '[[Neuvillette|The Iudex]] is above' or whatever, she must have run into some kind of intractable problem."
:'''Owner's Message:''' Menthe works for the Maison Gardiennage. She can only have become so depressed because of encountering so much unfathomable darkness in the course of her work. I truly feel sorry for her."

===The Steambird and La Gouttiere===
:'''Message:''' "I think articles in The Steambird are getting more boring by the day. It's all just reprinting the same hackneyed tripe that everyone already knows."
:'''Message:''' "Other than [[Charlotte]], their reporters are just fixated on superficial drivel. Sometimes their new content is nothing but hearsay, without even an iota of truth to it!"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Why not give [[La Gouttiere]] a read? They've got a new editor, and the content is getting more and more riveting. It's far more interesting than some of the supposedly more truthful papers."

===Old friend's flattery===
:'''Message:''' "Old friend, you are as masterful at brewing coffee as ever."
:'''Owner's Message:''' "Your ability to praise others is as lousy as ever."
:'''Message:''' "With a mouth like yours, no wonder the Palais Mermonia fired you."
:'''Owner's Message:''' "Then you should be thanking this mouth of mine, else you'd have no coffee to drink now."

===Akademiya research of alcohol and soft drinks===
:'''Message:''' "The [[Sumeru Akademiya]] has just published a new paper with the latest research. Experiments show that over 80% of those who drink iced Dandelion Wine for long periods will show symptoms of loss of liver function."
:'''Message:''' "Over 70% of those who drink iced Fonta over long periods will show symptoms of loss of kidney function. Please, everyone, pay attention to your health!"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Who knew that adding ice was so harmful? In the future, I certainly won't add any ice!"

===Fairness of death===
:'''Message:''' "Can it be said that death is the only thing that is truly fair?"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "I do not think so. Fairness should be interpreted as a set of principles or objective standards. But death is merely a phenomenon, and not a standard, so it cannot be said to be fair."
:'''Owner's Reply''' "Our shop welcomes all philosophical discussions except those about 'death'. Sorry for any inconvenience and thank you for your understanding."
:'''Message:''' "The topic of 'death' is unclear, but it is ultimately an unavoidable topic that we all must face."
:'''Owner's Reply:''' "Our shop does not welcome any unavoidable philosophical discussions. Thank you for your understanding."

===The topic of the lecture at Salon Caritat this week===
:'''Message:''' "The topic of the lecture at [[Salon Caritat]] this week will be 'How does water pollution harm the biota of Fontaine?' Everyone is welcome to participate!"
:'''Message:''' "Marine pollution is already a pressing emergency, and we need everyone to contribute their strength! Save the waters of Fontaine! Save the [[Bathysmal Vishap]]!"
:'''Owner's Message:''' "Since when does Fontaine have Bathysmal Vishaps? You idiot."

===The energy system of Fontaine===
:'''Message:''' "The energy system of Fontaine is threatening to murder our future!"
:'''Message:''' "For future generations, for our descendants, we must refuse to work, refuse the trials, and oppose Indemnitium!"
:'''Owner's Message:''' "Monsieur [[Gontharet]], you still haven't paid for your coffee tab last month. I hope you will settle the bill at your earliest convenience."

===Exchange with the Fontaine Research Institute===
:'''Incredibly Messy Handwriting:''' "I am Samil, a visiting researcher here for an exchange with the [[Fontaine Research Institute]]. I seem to have missed the one responsible for picking me up. Does anyone know which department I should contact in these situations?"
:'''Message:''' "How did you manage to get all the way over here? I've been looking all over for you! Come back to this café tomorrow- I'll meet you here then."
:'''Forged Handwriting:''' "Oh right, I forgot to mention, ask for 'Mr. Horler' when you get here."
:'''Message:''' "Samil, that Horler is a liar and a scammer! Don't fall for his tricks!"
:'''Owner's Message:''' "You're too late, 'Horler' has already taken them to the [[Fleuve Cendre]]. Tried to convince that blasted bookworm not to go, but nothing worked. All we can do now is hope for the best."

===Mr. Sawleg===
:'''Message:''' "Hey, I haven't seen Mr. Sawleg around the café lately."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "You mean old Horler? Heard he got arrested. Apparently someone who was copying his performance impersonated him on the [[Vasari Passage Advertisement Board|Vasari Passage's message board]]."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "He was so mad, he pretended to be the [[Maison Gardiennage]] and warned them off. Though they caught the copycat, he was sentenced as well for impersonating the Maison Gardiennage."
:'''Message:''' "Looks like performance art in Fontaine is no path to success."
:'''Owner's Message:''' "Maybe being 'judged' is part of the artwork itself."

===Callas Line reconstruction proposals===
:'''Message:''' "My immediate superior wants me to approve the contractor's proposals for clearing out the ruins of the [[Fontaine Research Institute]] and reconstructing the [[Callas Line]] to ensure the project isn't delayed."
:'''Message:''' "But the [[Maison Gestion]] leadership wants me to take my time reviewing the proposals carefully. Who should I listen to?"
:'''Owner's Message:''' "Why not just have them ask the omnipotent '[[Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale]]'? After all, it decides all matters of right and wrong here in Fontaine."

===Artistic trends===
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Personally, I think artistic trends in today's Fontaine should progress in a more realistic direction, and let the beauty and homeliness that we see with our own two eyes bloom upon the canvas."
:'''Message:''' "The beauty and homeliness we see with our own two eyes? Are you from the Kamera Club?"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "How dare you!? I am not! I am a painter! A painter!"
:'''Message:''' "A Kamera is but a cold, unfeeling machine! The pictures it takes cannot be called art! True art requires thinking and soul!"

===Loafers===
:'''Message:''' "Half the people here are lazy loafers, idling the day away and talking utter nonsense. Completely worthless."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "We're not loafers! This is libel! If you fail to offer a satisfactory apology immediately, then I shall go to the Maison Gestion and apply to duel you!"
:'''Message:''' "Sorry: I sincerely apologize for what I said before, after all, half the people in the café are not idle layabouts."

=== Threat Letter Case ===
''Available after completing {{Quest|In a New Light}}.''
:'''Maison Cardinalice:''' The suspect who may have sent the [[Kiara|Melusine]] that threatening letter has been arrested and is undergoing strict interrogation and investigation.
:'''Maison Cardinalice:''' The victim is in good health, emotionally stable, and has returned to work. Fellow citizens, we thank you for your help.
:'''Maison Cardinalice:''' On behalf of the Chief Justice, the Maison Cardinalice would like to express our gratitude to all the kind citizens who provided information and protected said Melusine during this incident.
