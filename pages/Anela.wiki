===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing ''The Case of the Crafting Bench''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Anela:''' [[Sour Sauce Ceviche]] again...?
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong with Sour Sauce Ceviche?
::'''Anela:''' Nothing, really, it's fine. But no matter how good it is, you can't just keep eating the same thing day after day, can you? Though on the other hand, [["Ripple"|Ripple]]'s been getting a bit pudgy lately, hasn't he? Odd, neither his training nor his caloric intake have changed...
:{{DIcon}} I shan't disturb you any longer.
::'''Anela:''' Aw, it's fine!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''The Case of the Crafting Bench''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Anela:''' Oh, it's you. Did you make a trip out here just to have some fun with me?
:{{DIcon}} About what happened before...
::'''Anela:''' You've reconsidered my invitation? Or are you thinking of something else?
::'''Anela:''' If you're asking about Hampeq, all I can say is that he brought it on himself. Sure, his opponents were in the wrong, but is he really completely blameless?
::'''Anela:''' Oh my! I hope it doesn't sound like I'm kicking him while he's down. Well, for the sake of my reputation, let's keep that between us for now.
:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to take care of, so I'll be going now.
::'''Anela:''' Oh, really? Such a pity. You be careful out there~
