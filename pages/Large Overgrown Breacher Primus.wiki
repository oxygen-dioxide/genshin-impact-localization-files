{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Melee Combo
|desc_1 = Performs 2 or 3 melee attacks, dealing '''60% ATK''', '''60% ATK''', '''60% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}.
|name_2 = Single Shot
|desc_2 = Fires a projectile at the player, dealing '''60% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}.
|name_3 = Abyssal Barrage
|desc_3 = Summons a black hole from which it fires many pellets, each dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}.
|name_4 = Stressed State
|desc_4 = Periodically enters a stressed state, during which it will gain a {{Dendro}} [[Shield/Enemy|shield]] and fire waves of Lushmissiles at the player, with each Lushmissile dealing '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|Dendro DMG}}.

The shield can be broken using [[Elemental Reaction]]s and is weakest to {{Electro}}. A single [[Arkhe]] attack, {{Pneuma}} or {{Ousia}}, will also instantly destroy the shield. Once the shield is broken, the Breacher Primus will become paralyzed for a long period of time.

Once paralyzed, the exposed core counts as a [[Weak Point]].

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A strange life form that mostly appears in Elynas.<br>The nature of a Breacher Primus defies known categories: they are not animals, plants, [[Shroom-Kin]], nor Elementals. The debate among scholars of [[Sumeru]] never formally reached a consensus on just what it is, until it was finally banned as a research topic. The reason is that based on the current system of knowledge, this problem is like "the definitions prescribed by language and the true nature of things," and it is impossible to have a meaningful, final answer.|[[Archive]]}}
