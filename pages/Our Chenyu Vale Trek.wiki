==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Hezhe Post seems to be organizing an interesting event named "Our Chenyu Vale Trek"...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to [[Zhuchun]], optional)
:'''Zhuchun:''' Heyo, friendo! You've been all over, I imagine you've had the pleasure of admiring quite a few sights in your time?
:'''Zhuchun:''' I wonder if the Chenyu Vale's spots for this contest will be able to top the ones you've experienced?

;(Talk to [[Mali]], optional)
:'''Mali:''' My dear friend, are you here to participate in the photography contest as well?
:'''Mali:''' As a [[Fontaine|Fontainian]] photographer, one who's emerged from the [[Kamera]]'s birthplace, let me offer you some advice: the purest essence of photography lies within the Kamera itself.
:'''Mali:''' Hence, I'd like to introduce you to someone. Back in my hometown, the Kameras he makes are beloved without exception. They come at reasonable prices, too, and I know just how to get my hands on one...
:'''Mali:''' Hey... Don't give me that uninterested look! I'll get you an extra discount!
:'''Mali:''' Hey... Don't leave!

;(Talk to Fangju)
:'''Fangju:''' Are you here to take part in the "Our Chenyu Vale Trek" scenic photography contest?
:'''Paimon:''' Scenic photography contest? What's that?
:'''Fangju:''' It's exactly as its name implies. It's a contest designed to promote the beautiful scenery of Chenyu Vale.
:'''Fangju:''' We previously surveyed the vale's residents to collect opinions regarding its most captivating scenic spots. Now, we're tasking contestants with going to and capturing images of said locations using their Kameras.
:'''Fangju:''' Lastly, we'll pick out a handful of exceptional ones to use as promotional examples, which will be exhibited on the street outside Hezhe Post. Well? How about it, you two?
:{{DIcon}} I'm a practical person. What prizes are up for grabs?
::'''Fangju:''' Of course there is. If your works are chosen, there'll be a special surprise just for you.
:{{DIcon}} Great. There's no one better at photography than I am.
::'''Fangju:''' You look like you just can't wait to begin snapping some shots. Allow me to add that if your works are chosen, there'll be a special surprise just for you.
:'''Paimon:''' Wow! A surprise!? We'd better give it our all, then!
:'''Fangju:''' Heh, we've still prepared a little reward for your time and effort even if your work isn't selected. We hope it'll be to your satisfaction.
:{{DIcon}} Where do I start?
:'''Fangju:''' Have a look at this guide. These are the residents' recommended scenic spots of Chenyu Vale.
::{{Readable|title=Chenyu Vale Scenery Guide
|text=<!--
-->What would you say the best scenic attraction in Chenyu Vale is?<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->It's gotta be my hometown, Qiaoying Village. Not only are the sights amazing, but the animals there are super cute! I recommend going in the afternoon!<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->(Location that has been crossed out.)<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->The Jademouth! A life lived without visiting it is surely one with regrets, especially that gemstone orb. When you look at it in the morning, it's like a moon that has yet to set.<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->(Location that has been crossed out.)<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->The Lotus Pond next to the Ancient Teatree King may not be that famous, but I find it to have a serene beauty at night. You just have to be careful of the monsters nearby.<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->(Location that has been crossed out.)<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->If you ask me, it's gotta be... Mt. Xuanlian, right? You rarely see such strange mountains anywhere else, and sunset there is truly moving.<br><!--

-->(There are other locations written in the guide, but they've also been crossed out.)}}
:;(Obtain {{Item|Chenyu Vale Scenery Guide|x=1}})
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Why are some of the locations crossed out?
:'''Fangju:''' Heh, that's because those locations have been fully signed up for. We're hoping to provide a more comprehensive display of Chenyu Vale's beauty.
:'''Fangju:''' These four remaining locations are still available for registration. You can select one or more of them.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon gets it now... {{Traveler}}, how about we sign up for all of the remaining locations?
:'''Paimon:''' If our chance of winning the prize is one in four, then we'd be guaranteed to win if we take four photos! This way, the surprise will be ours for sure!
:{{DIcon}} That's not how probability works.
::'''Paimon:''' Really? But isn't one quarter multiplied by four equal to one?
::{{DIcon}} It is, but...
:{{DIcon}} Nice math.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe! What are we waiting for, then? Let's get going! That surprise is ours for the taking!

{{Quest Description|update|Next, you need to take pictures according to the instructions in the Chenyu Vale Scenery Guide...}}

;(Talk to Fangju again, optional)
:'''Fangju:''' I wish you all the best of luck.
----
;(Approach the marked area in Jademouth)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, see that? That thing's shape is like a huge circle with a big mouth. Is that why it's called the "Jademouth"? It is pretty spectacular, don't you think?
:'''Paimon:''' This is a good spot for our photo!

;(Take the picture)

;(Read Someone's Idle Musings, optional)
:'''Someone's Idle Musings:''' "To carve beautiful jade is taboo, for the jade will first be consigned to dust."
----
;(Approach the marked area in Qiaoying Village)
:'''Paimon:''' Look over there! There's a really weird bird. Aren't they called pelicans or something?
:'''Paimon:''' If we could take a photo of both it and Qiaoying Village, it would make for a pretty cool picture!

;(Approach [[Mingjing]] and the [[Redbill Pelican]])
:'''Paimon:''' Is this pelican here yours, kid? Could we photograph it alongside Qiaoying Village?
:'''Mingjing:''' Hree hree! Hree hree anng anng hree hree!
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? What are you saying?
:'''Mingjing:''' It's pelican talk, which means "great, great!"
:{{DIcon}} You speak pelican?
:'''Mingjing:''' Only a little... because I noticed when they eat, they don't stop going "hree hree! Hree hree anng anng hree hree!"
:'''Mingjing:''' I'm sure they're happily saying that it's "great, great"!
:'''Mingjing:''' So I learned to call to them in that manner too. They come over as soon as they hear, probably because they think there's food.
:'''Mingjing:''' If you wanna photograph one, then maybe you could try calling out to one yourself! It's too bad I gotta get home now, otherwise, I could teach you some more!
:'''Paimon:''' No worries, kiddo! We'll try it ourselves! Thanks, and get home safely!
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, let's give it a go over there! If we can attract a pelican, it'll increase our work's chances of success!

;(Interact with the marked area)
:{{DIcon}} Call for pelicans
::{{DIcon}} "Anng anng! Hree hree anng anng hree hree!"
:::'''Paimon:''' That's not it! Paimon remembers it started with "Hree hree!" Hurry up and try again!
::;(Returns to selection and removes the dialogue option)
::{{DIcon}} "Hree hree! Hree hree anng anng hree hree!"
:::'''Paimon:''' Wow, there's a pelican coming! Quick! Let's take a picture with it and Qiaoying Village!
::;(Finishes the dialogue)
::{{DIcon}} "Quack quack, Paimon, quack quack."
:::'''Paimon:''' Ooh, is there anything tasty?
:::'''Paimon:''' ...Hey, stop messing around! Paimon remembers it starts with "Hree hree," now hurry up and try again!
::;(Returns to selection and removes the dialogue option)

:'''Someone's Idle Musings:''' "Pelicans perched beside the pier, contemplating the anglers of Qiaoying."
----
;(Approach the marked area in Teatree Slope)
:'''Paimon:''' This should be the Lotus Pond by the Ancient Teatree King? Whaddaya know &mdash; just like the guidebook said, there are monsters!

;(Defeat the enemies)
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon just knew these monsters were no match for you, {{Traveler}}!
:'''Paimon:''' Next, we need to find a good angle to take a photo of the Lotus Pond.

;(Approach the marked area in Mt. Xuanlian)
:'''Terrified Voice:''' Someone help me! Help!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Looks like someone calling for help! Let's go have a look!

;(After defeating the enemies)
:'''[[Akai]]:''' Hang on! Don't come any closer! Are you... are you good people?
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, we're the ones who saved you just now! Did you hit your head on something or...
:'''Akai:''' Ah! You're right... I'm really sorry about that. My "Chenyu Vale Trek" has been nothing but dizzyingly bad luck... Thank... you...
:{{DIcon}} So you're participating in the photography contest, too?
:'''Akai:''' You are as well? What a coincidence! I'm just an ordinary tourist, though... So I couldn't do anything about those hilichurls.
:'''Akai:''' I came across those louts on the road, and they captured and brought me back here without letting me get a word in lengthwise. Hilichurls don't also collect tolls, do they? Preposterous... Luckily, I ran into you guys.
:'''Paimon:''' Ah... Today was a tough day for you indeed.
:'''Akai:''' Not just today! Yesterday was terrible as well. I bought a rather expensive Kamera from a Fontaine merchant, but it broke after only a few uses. When I went back to find him, he was gone...
:'''Akai:''' What a shady guy... Be sure to keep an eye on your wallet while you're out and about!
:'''Akai:''' Ah, sorry. Got a little sidetracked there. Since you're also taking part in the competition, you must be here to photograph Mt. Xuanlian, correct?
:'''Akai:''' What say I share the best photography spot that I found around here with you as thanks? Here, I'll mark it on your map for you.
:'''Akai:''' You can see it from here. In fact, it's right over there!
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? What about you then? Aren't you participating in the contest as well?
:'''Akai:''' This area's rather dangerous, so it'd be best for me to switch things up. I remember the guide spoke of other locations... I think I should check out the Tea-Tasting Adeptus...
:'''Akai:''' Yeah! That sounds good. Goodbye, you two! Hopefully, things start turning out well for me now!

;(Approach the marked photography spot)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow! This is a great angle.
:'''Paimon:''' Time to take out the ol' Kamera!

;(Take the picture)

----
;(After obtaining all pictures)
:'''Paimon:''' Phew! Paimon took a look at the photos we've got: Qiaoying Village, the Lotus Pond, Jademouth, and Mt. Xuanlian! We've got 'em all!
:'''Paimon:''' There won't be any other participants as hardworking as us, will there? If we don't win a prize after all this, it'll be a total travesty!

{{Quest Description|update|Hezhe Post seems to be organizing an interesting event named "Our Chenyu Vale Trek"...}}

;(Talk to Fangju)
:'''Fangju:''' Seeing how relaxed you look, I suppose you must be here to submit your photos. Just leave them with me.
:'''Fangju:''' Hmm, not bad at all. You must've put in a lot of work to capture such beautiful scenes. Well done.
:;(Submit {{Item|Picture: Tranquil Jademouth|x=1}}, {{Item|Picture: Guests of Qiaoying|x=1}}, {{Item|Picture: Lotus Pond Beneath the Moon|x=1}}, {{Item|Picture: Mt. Xuanlian|x=1}})
:'''Fangju:''' Hmm... these photos...
:'''Paimon:''' What's wrong? Are ours not good enough?
:'''Fangju:''' It's quite the opposite... I've seen some excellent submissions these past few days, but your works are refreshing all the same.
:'''Fangju:''' Let's take this shot of Qiaoying Village. The pelican adds a touch of liveliness to the tranquil village, contrasting stillness and movement... A one-of-a-kind approach, indeed.
:'''Fangju:''' If it were just up to me, your works would certainly be selected for use.
:'''Paimon:''' Wow! What a compliment! You're making Paimon blush a little.
:{{DIcon}} Blush? You're not the one who took these photos.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon was just feeling flattered on your behalf! Paimon knows all about your modesty.
:{{DIcon}} I'm starting to feel a little embarrassed now too.
:'''Fangju:''' Well, in any case, our selection process will be completed before tomorrow morning.
:'''Fangju:''' From eight in the morning until six at night, we will exhibit the selected works on the street outside Hezhe Post.
:'''Fangju:''' Thank you for participating in the "Our Chenyu Vale Trek" scenic photography contest. Don't forget to come back around tomorrow!
:'''Paimon:''' You bet! We're not gonna miss out on the final surprise!

;(Talk to Fangju again, optional)
:'''Fangju:''' From eight in the morning until six at night, we will exhibit the selected works on the street outside Hezhe Post. Don't forget to come back around tomorrow!
----
;(Wait until <nowiki>8:00 to 18:00</nowiki> the next day)
;(Approach the marked area)
:'''Fangju:''' Ah, you've made it.
:'''Fangju:''' Have you seen the exhibited works? A total of eight works have been selected for this iteration of "Our Chenyu Vale Trek," and half of those are yours.
:'''Fangju:''' Congratulations!
:'''Paimon:''' Wow! That's awesome!
:'''Paimon:''' See, {{Traveler}}? Paimon was right about getting four out of four! Paimon's math skills really are something!
:{{DIcon}} It's four out of eight, actually.
:{{DIcon}} Wow! Quite the mathematician, aren't we?
:'''Fangju:''' Heh, the judges also showed great appreciation for your other two works, much like I said yesterday.
:'''Fangju:''' And so, please take this limited edition "Our Chenyu Vale Trek" commemorative photo album. It features all of the contest's selected works. You have earned it.
:'''Paimon:''' This was the surprise? Ooh, it looks amazing!
:;(Opens [["Our Chenyu Vale Trek" Album]])
:'''Fangju:''' If it's alright with you, I also have some [[Mora]] for you. Please take it. I'd like to thank you again for participating, this time on a personal level.
:'''Fangju:''' This is my hometown, and you have forever captured the beauty of this place. These works will surely cause more people to fall in love with it.
:'''Fangju:''' Thank you.
:;(Obtain {{Item|"Our Chenyu Vale Trek" Album|x=1}})

;(Talk to Mali, optional)
:'''Mali:''' Uh-oh! That dupe from [[Inazuma]] is here as well. I'd better pretend I didn't notice him... Luckily, there's someone in between us, so he probably doesn't see me.
:'''Mali:''' Darn it, why are these scenery photos so captivating? I don't wanna leave this place yet...

;(Talk to Zhuchun, optional)
:'''Zhuchun:''' These photos were shot quite nicely. It's just a shame that the atmosphere around me seems rather off...
:'''Zhuchun:''' Maybe I should pick a different spot from which to appreciate them...

;(Talk to Akai, optional)
:'''Akai:''' There he is! That shady Fontaine merchant! Has my luck really begun to turn around!?
:'''Akai:''' I should just rush over and grab hold of him right now, but then I wouldn't be able to appreciate these charming photos of Chenyu Vale...
:'''Akai:''' No... I would just suffer further loss that way. I'd be better off doing so after viewing them, especially for my selected work...
