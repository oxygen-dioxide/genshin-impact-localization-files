;(Talk to Xavier)
:'''Xavier:''' Wait! Ah, Sir Soldier, the line you read lacks the right emotional gravitas.
:'''Xavier:''' "Samurai, like the wind sweeping the earth."
:'''Xavier:''' Do you still remember what I said about the play? It is supposed to feel liberating and give the audience a sense of the vicissitudes of life. I said liberating! Liberating, you understand?
:'''Xavier:''' This line is key to the whole play. You must express your emotions completely, fully, and perfectly!
:'''Toranosuke:''' Uh...
:'''Xavier:''' Moreover, don't swing your sword in such haste... Make sure you are in view, otherwise, the Film Kamera will not be able to capture your movements at all.
:'''Xavier:''' Pose, and then pause, okay? Stop for a moment, then slice downwards with great force.
:'''Toranosuke:''' But you can't swing your sword like that when you fight against people...
:'''Xavier:''' True, but you have to tailor your acting to the production's needs.
:'''Xavier:''' Well then. Please ready up, and we shall give this another go...
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
:{{DIcon}} "Samurai, like the wind sweeping the earth."
::'''Xavier:''' You said those words with too much passion. It should be...
:'''Xavier:''' Oh, it's you! Ah, my dear {{MC|boy|girl|mc=1}}, a fair wind must have blown you here.
:'''Xavier:''' As you can see, I'm shooting a swashbuckler film with our good soldier here. I call it "The Seventh Samurai."
:'''Xavier:''' Oh, "swashbuckler film" is what I'm calling films of this genre.
:'''Xavier:''' This sort of film shall have sword-fighting scenes, and it shall take the viewers on an incredible journey across the battlefield... Well, that's the idea, at least!
:{{DIcon}} To think that Mr. [[Toranosuke]] would have time...
::'''Toranosuke:''' This activity has been approved by our superiors. According to them, it will help to increase the [[Shogunate]]'s prestige.
::'''Toranosuke:''' That said, I haven't a clue how Mr. Xavier managed to convince them...
:{{DIcon}} How did you persuade him to help you out?
::'''Xavier:''' Come now, our dear soldier understood me just fine. My main job, really, was to persuade Mr. [[Mikoshi Genjirou]] to allow me to make a film in Inazuma.
:'''Xavier:''' Honestly, Mr. [[Mikoshi Genjirou]] is such a... serious man. Fortunately, he is also most understanding.
:'''Xavier:''' After I had a sincere talk with him, he accepted my request quite happily.
:'''Xavier:''' But... In exchange, I have to do a movie that has to do with the Shogunate, preferably with a samurai as the protagonist.
:'''Xavier:''' But I was always interested in this sort of subject matter anyway, so of course, I agreed to it, and Lord Mikoshi Genjirou was also very pleased.
:'''Xavier:''' In addition to personally appointing our good soldier to go with me, he also assigned some skilled troops to me, and then he said...
:'''Xavier:''' "Use these scenes of steel clashing against steel to display the majesty of the samurai and the Shogunate."
:'''Xavier:''' I have to say, Mr. Genjirou really is a man of vision, to have grasped the potential of using films as a marketing tool so very quickly...
:'''Xavier:''' And as for me, I will never refuse anything that will help me make my films.
:{{DIcon}} Is the production going well?
::'''Xavier:''' To be honest, it's not going that well...
:{{DIcon}} Mind if I play a part?
::'''Xavier:''' Of course! Of course! You are, after all, forever a {{MC|hero|heroine|mc=1}} in my heart!
::'''Xavier:''' I'll always remember that "[[Tatara Tales]]" that we acted in together.
:'''Xavier:''' While these soldiers are highly skilled in martial arts, they are not used to this kind of staged fighting.
:'''Xavier:''' Not only are their sword movements too fast for the Film Kamera to record, they sometimes even run outside of its view.
:'''Xavier:''' Traveler, if you have time, do you mind following my script and acting the story out for the soldiers to see?
:'''Xavier:''' I believe that with your strength and understanding, you will be able to perform brilliantly in front of the Kamera...
:'''Xavier:''' They should be able to better understand the story after watching it from the spectator's point of view.
:'''Xavier:''' Come, come! Just read the script and the lines first. This part is mainly about fighting...
:{{DIcon}} "The battle is lost."
:{{DIcon}} "But even when imperiled, the samurai is still samurai."
:{{DIcon}} "You are all certified scarecrows..."
:'''Xavier:''' Ah, these are lines from another scene... This one is mainly about fighting, so there aren't that many lines.
:{{DIcon}} Alright, let me take a look at the script.
;(Opens up "The Seventh Samurai" Script)
::Act 5, Scene 3
::...Juusaburou leads the other samurai in a fierce battle with the thieves...
::...The offensive led by Juusaburou gradually overpowers the thieves, scattering them in all directions.
::Lines:
::Kyuuzou: "Come, Juusaburou! The thieves are getting away!"
::Juusaburou: "They won't give Taniko up that easily. Keep your eyes peeled!"
::...After defeating the thieves, Juusaburou looks around absently and calls out:
::Lines:
::Juusaburou: "The thieves! Where are the thieves?"
::Kyuuzou: "They've all been beaten."
::Juusaburou stands on the spot, scanning his surroundings, then bursts into tears.
:'''Xavier:''' Oh, by the way, you'll be playing the role of "Juusaburou." Together with several companions, he is employed by the villagers to protect their village...
:'''Xavier:''' In this scene, one of your companions, "Kyuuzou," has lines... I'll play his part, and the two of us will do a reading.
:'''Xavier:''' Now, you must embody the role, understand it! Just think of yourself as Juusaburou. Do you understand?
:{{DIcon}} I understand, Director.
:{{DIcon}} I. Am. Juusaburou.
:'''Xavier:''' Wonderful! Splendid! Bravo!
:'''Xavier:''' Let me know when you are ready. I have to adjust the Film Kamera's position...

;(If you talk to Toranosuke)
:'''Toranosuke:''' A "swashbuckler film," huh. Mr. Xavier sure does have interesting taste in names.
:{{DIcon}} What do you think of these films?
::'''Toranosuke:''' Our superiors believe that these films will help to increase the Shogunate's prestige.
::'''Toranosuke:''' Perhaps I am simply a little slow on the uptake... but I do not see how this is the case.
::'''Toranosuke:''' This script is full of these... pessimistic lines. There is nothing of samurai dignity here.
::'''Toranosuke:''' Who knows what they were thinking, that they agreed to all this...
:{{DIcon}} How's the situation at the [[Mikage Furnace]]?
::'''Toranosuke:''' Ever since Sir [[Hanbei]]'s "promotion," [[Yousuke]] has taken over as the person in charge.
::'''Toranosuke:''' He is a craftsman by birth and trade, and is very down-to-earth and steady. He gets things done, as well.
::'''Toranosuke:''' With the Mikage Furnace under his management, I doubt there will be any further problems.
----
;(Talk to Xavier)
:'''Xavier:''' So, are you ready?
:{{DIcon}} Ready when you are.
::'''Xavier:''' Wonderful, bravo! In that case, let's begin!
::'''Xavier:''' I shall make a few adjustments to the Film Kamera and call the soldiers back...
::'''''Xavier starts adjusting his Film Kamera...'''''
:{{DIcon}} I'm not quite ready yet...
::'''Xavier:''' Well, don't worry. Take your time &mdash; just let me know when you're ready.
:{{DIcon}} What do you mean to capture through film?
::'''Xavier:''' Aha! That's a fine question. A fine question indeed. But to be honest, I have yet to think it all through, either.
::'''Xavier:''' I believe that films can be about anything.
::'''Xavier:''' Romance! Suspense! Combat! Even all manner of baseless legends can be the subject of films.
::'''Xavier:''' Though I must say that I think films have some sort of charm that I have yet to fully bring out.
::'''Xavier:''' Still, I believe that I will find the answer to that question as long as I keep making films.

{{Quest Description|update|You agree to Xavier's request to help him produce a film...}}
;(Start creating a "film")
:'''"Sugimura":''' Hmph. So there are still fools out there who dare to raise their swords against me.
:'''"Sugimura":''' ...No doubt for glory, if not for food.
:'''"Sugimura":''' It matters not. You will soon not have to worry about these two.
;(After defeating the bandits)
:'''"Kyuuzou":''' Come, Juusaburou! The thieves are getting away!
:'''Xavier:''' ... Traveler, your line! Read your line!
:'''"Juusaburou":''' They won't give Taniko up that easily. Keep your eyes peeled!
;(After completing the "film")
:'''"Juusaburou"''' The thief! Where's the thief?
:'''"Kyuuzou":''' They've been beaten.
:'''Xavier:''' Alright! Cut! Perfect angle!

{{Quest Description|update|During the production of the film, something unexpected seems to have happened. Xavier has something to tell you...
}}
;(If the timer runs out)
:'''Xavier:''' Traveler, I can't get a good shot if you swing your sword like that. Could you use a bit more force?

;(If you leave the recording area)
:'''Xavier:''' Ah! Where are you going? Come back, you've gone out of view!

;(Talk to Xavier after failing)
:'''Xavier:''' Oh dear me, this film doesn't seem to have come out right...
:'''Xavier:''' Please get ready again, and we shall give it another go.
:{{DIcon}} I'm ready.
::'''Xavier:''' Wonderful, bravo! In that case, let's begin!
::'''Xavier:''' I shall make a few adjustments to the Film Kamera and call the soldiers back...
::'''''Xavier starts adjusting his Film Kamera...'''''
:{{DIcon}} I'm not ready yet...
::'''Xavier:''' Well don't worry. Take your time &mdash; just let me know when you're ready.
:{{DIcon}} What do you mean to capture through film?
::'''Xavier:''' Aha! That's a fine question. A fine question indeed. But to be honest, I have yet to think it through, either.
::'''Xavier:''' I believe that films can be about anything.
::'''Xavier:''' Romance! Suspense! Combat! Even all manner of baseless legends can be the subject of films.

{{Quest Description|update|Xavier is very happy with your performance. He seems to have something more to tell you...}}
;(Talk to Xavier after succeeding)
:'''Xavier:''' Perfect! As expected of the {{MC|hero|heroine|mc=1}} of my heart! A perfect demonstration! You truly are a star!
:{{DIcon}} A... what now?
::'''Xavier:''' A star! That is to say, the most important actor in a film.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe I'd like to change roles next time.
::'''Xavier:''' No problem at all! Once this film has been completed, we should start planning a whole new one.
:'''Xavier:''' Now then, Mr. Soldier. You saw that demonstration clearly, I trust?
:'''Toranosuke:''' On the whole, yes. When swinging my blade, I should focus not so much on the "action," itself, but the "posture," yes?
:'''Toranosuke:''' If you only require the "posture"... I have some ideas about that.
:'''Xavier:''' Oh? That's wonderful! Please discuss the matter with your fellow soldiers, and we'll do another take in a while.
:'''Xavier:''' You have my utmost gratitude for your help, Traveler. Here. These are for you.
:{{DIcon}} What's the theme of your next film?
:'''Xavier:''' The next film, hmm? Well... Actually, I'm quite torn on what its topic should be myself.
:'''Xavier:''' Should we do one about the various traditions of the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]]? Or the tales of the [[kitsune]] and the [[tanuki]]?
:'''Xavier:''' There are so many islands here in Inazuma, and so many stories to be told!
:'''Xavier:''' But regardless, I have to finish producing "The Seventh Samurai" first.
:'''Xavier:''' If this satisfies those fellows upstairs, I do suspect that future film projects shall progress much more smoothly.
