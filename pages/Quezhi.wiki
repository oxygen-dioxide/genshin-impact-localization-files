:'''Quezhi:''' Please follow me, we have seats over here. Would you like to enjoy some tea while listening to the performance, or would you prefer a work meal?
:{{DIcon}} What kinds of tea are there?
::'''Quezhi:''' Our teahouse proudly offers both the Single-Origin Yauwan Tea and Sunglo Tea that [[Chenyu Vale]] is renowned for, in every available grade!
::'''Quezhi:''' We also have the Tianheng Bohea, Yunlai White Tea, and Bishui Green Tea, which are popular in [[Liyue Harbor]], all at export quality!
:{{DIcon}} Work meal?
::'''Quezhi:''' Oh, forgive me. According to Ms. [[Vert Jr.]]'s suggestion, a more elegant name for it would be... a simple meal.
::'''Quezhi:''' Indeed! It's a simple meal for those coming and going on business!
::'''Quezhi:''' Of course, we serve regular lunch and dinner as well. However, we usually don't serve them in our outdoor dining area.
::'''Quezhi:''' These tables are usually reserved for guests to sip tea while listening to performances and stories.
::'''Quezhi:''' Our teahouse's indoor dining area, private seats, and private rooms are temporarily under renovation. Please do give us a visit once those renovations are completed!
:{{DIcon}} I'm just looking around, you do you.
::'''Quezhi:''' I look forward to serving you again!
