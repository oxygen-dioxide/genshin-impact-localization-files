==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Tang Wuchou was sold a jade pendant and it lead him to believe he's a descendant of the [[Guhua Clan]]. However, this pendant is made of [[Smaragdus Jadeite]], which is known to make non-Vision wielders ill. This explained the headaches "Tang Wuchou" claimed to be experiencing.

===Appearance===
Tang Wuchou takes on the form of a [[Treasure Hoarders: Carmen]] with a Jadeite Pendant on his hip.
