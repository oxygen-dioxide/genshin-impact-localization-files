|[[Sumeru City]]
|[[Sumeru (Soundtrack)|Sumeru]]
|Surrounded by towering trees and rivers<br/ >An ancient kingdom shines with a new light of wisdom
|-
|[[Ruin Golem (Devantaka Mountain)|Ruin Golem]]
|[[Vestige of Dahri]]
|In the lost forest<br />A rusted machine gazes at the remains of the past
|-
|[[Port Ormos]]
|[[Hustle and Bustle of Ormos]]
|With sunshine and breeze<br />The bustling port welcomes ships from afar
|-
|[[Mawtiyima Forest]]
|[[A Luminous Path]]
|Between dream and reality<br />Enormous fluorescent blue mushrooms hide the glimmering glow of the meadows
|-
|[[Caravan Ribat]]
|[[Scorching Outpost]]
|Amidst drizzling rain and flying sand<br />The outpost guards the peace of the frontier
