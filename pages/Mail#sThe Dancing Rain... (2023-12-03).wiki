|text      = A few days ago, as I was passing through Apam Woods, it started raining heavily. I had no choice but to take shelter under a tree and stand there quietly watching the rain.

As the raindrops sent out large ripples across the water, and all the plants and flowers in the forest swayed happily, it suddenly occurred to me that the whole forest seemed to be dancing to the melody of the rain.

Could it be that, just as the wind finds its shape as it blows through the treetops, so too might the rain be using the plants in the forest to perform a dance of its very own? When I thought of this, I tried to imitate the rhythm I saw
before me, and by doing so created a brand-new dance!

But before I stage an official performance... Perhaps I can first express my gratitude for nature's inspiration by performing this dance of joy for my close friend to witness!
