;(Talk to Gorou, optional)
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1901802 gorou 55.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Hmm? I thought you were going to survey the scene at Yae Publishing House?

;(Go to Yae Publishing House and keep watch)
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 01.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' Alright, everyone, settle down!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 02.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' We are gathered here today united by a common purpose! Now, who can tell me what they think that might be?
:{{DIcon}} (Let's see what this is all about...)
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 hiroshi 01.ogg}} '''Hiroshi:''' Well of course, it's... to tell the whole world about how wonderful Ms. Hina is!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 03.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' An excellent answer!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 04.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' How gentle she is... how understanding she is... how delightfully mischievous she can be, on occasion...
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 05.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' We can all testify to the great joy that Ms. Hina has brought to our lives. But my friends, there are so many people out there in this world who still need Ms. Hina's salvation.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 06.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' We can help by spreading the good news about Ms. Hina to every soul in the world!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 yuka 01.ogg}} '''Yuka:''' My friend... do you have a moment to talk about Ms. Hina?
:{{DIcon}} I've never heard of her.
:{{DIcon}} Who?
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 yuka 02.ogg}} '''Yuka:''' Friends, I found one! Someone needs our help!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 07a.ogg}} {{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 07b.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' Shhh! Calm your voice down, we don't want to scare {{MC|him|her}} off!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 08.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' Hello, my friend. On this joyous day, we would like to open our hearts to you and tell you about the existence of a perfect being.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 09.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' She is gentle, kind, understanding... she is the brightest star in our sky. Here, have this pamphlet.

::Teyvat's Big Sister
::Gentle and kind, she answers all your questions
::She'll help you be rid of all your troubles!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 hiroshi 02.ogg}} '''Hiroshi:''' So what do you think?
:{{DIcon}} Looks kind of familiar...
:{{DIcon}} What's this...?
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 10.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' Oh, my apologies. In my excitement, I forgot to give you all the details.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 11.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' Have you ever come across a magazine called "That's Life," published by the Yae Publishing House?
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 12.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' It's a monthly magazine featuring, amongst other things, an advice column. We were among the first readers to send in letters seeking advice, and we've received kind and gentle replies to each one.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 13.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' Although the editor chose to conceal her name, gender, and other details, we all see her as an empathetic older sister figure, and feel convinced that she must be the same sort of person in real life.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 hiroshi 03.ogg}} '''Hiroshi:''' There is no mistaking it. Just from her letters, I can feel that she respects me, trusts me... she has a natural ability to connect with people.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 hiroshi 04.ogg}} '''Hiroshi:''' She's so considerate. She can always sense our true emotions from our letters and never fails to deliver the advice and the encouragement we need.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 hiroshi 05.ogg}} '''Hiroshi:''' Except when it comes to the topic of romantic love &mdash; she's clearly not an expert there. But even then, that just makes her all the more endearing to us!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 yuka 03.ogg}} '''Yuka:''' Recently, the column went through a low period where it just wasn't popular at all. In fact, they almost axed it.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 yuka 04.ogg}} '''Yuka:''' Fortunately, Yae Publishing House made the decision to publicize her image, and then the column finally started to grow in popularity.
:{{DIcon}} So Ms. Hina is...
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 14.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' That's right! Ms. Hina is the person in charge of "That's Life" magazine's advice column. She is the one we all admire and adore so greatly.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 15.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' And so, when we heard that Yae Publishing House would be revealing the official likeness of Ms. Hina today, we immediately came here from wherever we were, all over the nation, to gather together...
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 16.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' ...and to witness this grand moment in history!
:{{DIcon}} (I wonder how Gorou would react to this...)
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 17.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' Please, gaze upon the radiant beauty of Ms. Hina, see how truly lovely she is...
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|You've learned the truth behind Ms. Hina. Do you want to break this news to Gorou?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Hiroshi, optional)
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 hiroshi 06.ogg}} '''Hiroshi:''' Welcome to the Ms. Hina Fan Club!

;(Talk to Nobuhiro, optional)
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 nobuhiro 18.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' I've been following Ms. Hina's column since the very first issue of "That's Life."

;(Talk to Yuka, optional)
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902601 yuka 05.ogg}} '''Yuka:''' I don't know if you know the word "fan"? [[Alice|A friendly adventurer lady]] taught it to us a few years ago. She seemed to know everything.
----
;(Go back and look for Gorou)
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 01.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Oh? Hey, there you are.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 02.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Is you-know-who at Yae Publishing House?
:{{DIcon}} No, she isn't.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 03.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Phew... That's good.
:{{DIcon}} What's up, Gorou?
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 04.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' I just finished writing my replies, so I was about to head to Yae Publishing House and hand them in.
:{{DIcon}} Why are you helping to write for them?
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 05.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Why...? Hmm.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 06.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' I guess it's because I can help people this way. Also, the editor said to me, "This is something that only you are capable of."
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 07.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' They made quite a solemn request when they first approached me, so I felt like I couldn't refuse it. But once I'd settled into it, I found myself really enjoying it.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 08.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Before I knew it, I had written hundreds of replies, and sometimes they'd respond again just to thank me. It made me so happy whenever they'd compliment me.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 09.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Every time I think about that terrifying woman, I feel like I want nothing to do with Yae Publishing House. But then, whenever I think about how my replies can help so many people, I feel a sense of responsibility.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 10.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' By this point, I'm so used to it that I'd probably find it hard to adjust if I ever gave it up.
:{{DIcon}} (I can't let Gorou know the full story...)
:{{DIcon}} (I'll just have to hide it from him for now...)
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 11.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Well... I don't know quite what's going on, but I'd like to get these letters delivered quickly while you-know-who isn't around.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 12.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' I'm really looking forward to the readers' reactions when they receive my letters. In the army, people are always a little reserved when talking to me, because I'm a general.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 13.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' But those obstacles are removed when you're communicating via letters. Everyone who writes seems to treat me like that one friend who they can share anything and everything with.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 14.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' So I'm not about to let them down. Let's head over!
:{{DIcon}} Why don't I deliver them for you...
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 15.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Hmm? But Yae Publishing House isn't far from here, if I remember correctly. Let's just head there together.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902602 gorou 16.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Besides, this way, if you-know-who does show up, we can look out for each other. Let's go!

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Go to Yae Publishing House with Gorou to deliver the replies)
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 01.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Strange, it seems unusually lively here today.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 02.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' I don't come here often. {{Traveler}}, is it like this most of the time?
:{{DIcon}} Not really...
:{{DIcon}} It's a special case today...
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 03.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Hey, there seems to be some commotion over there. Let's check it out.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 nobuhiro 01.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' Allow me to reiterate, my friends! We in the Ms. Hina Fan Club must abide by the club rules!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 nobuhiro 02.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' Firstly, we mustn't try and probe into Ms. Hina's true identity. We of all people cannot cause her any trouble!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 nobuhiro 03.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' Secondly, fans of Ms. Hina are not to make any controversial statements when representing the fan club. We must exercise self-discipline and present a good image in front of other people!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 nobuhiro 04.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' Thirdly, while our mission is to promote Ms. Hina in every way possible, if someone we're talking to says they're not interested, we are to respect that, and not go forcing it down their throats!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 nobuhiro 05.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' And finally! We are here today because Ms. Hina has brought us together. But we are also here to change ourselves for the better, for her sake! Can we do that, people? Can we do that?
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 01.ogg}} '''Hiroshi:''' Yes, we can!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 yuka 01.ogg}} '''Yuka:''' Always make her proud, and never bring her down!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 04.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Oh! So this is what they call a "Fan Club."
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 05.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' I don't know whose fan club it is, but they are raring to go! Reminds me of the rallying speeches we used to give before going into battle.
:{{DIcon}} Hehe...
:{{DIcon}} Heh, yeah...
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 06.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Hmm, something's up, isn't it... I can tell, you're avoiding my gaze.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 07.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Did something happen? It's not "her," is it?
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 02.ogg}} '''Hiroshi:''' Excuse me, friend...
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 03.ogg}} '''Hiroshi:''' Something about you looks awfully similar to Ms. Hina...
:{{DIcon}} You're imagining things!
:{{DIcon}} No resemblance whatsoever!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 04.ogg}} '''Hiroshi:''' I see, well, one way or another, fate has brought you here. Have you ever heard of Ms. Hina?
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 08.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Sorry, I'm not sure...
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 05.ogg}} '''Hiroshi:''' Well, now's as good a time as any for you to find out more!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 06.ogg}} '''Hiroshi:''' Ms. Hina is gentle, kind, and considerate. You can tell her anything that is bothering you, and she will patiently advise you on how to deal with it.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 09.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Oh! Well, she sounds like a very pleasant person to be around!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 10.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' She must be the polar opposite of Yae Miko... right, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} Haha...
:{{DIcon}} I couldn't say...
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 yuka 02.ogg}} '''Yuka:''' But he's the spitting image of Ms. Hina... I wonder if they're blood relatives...
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 07.ogg}} '''Hiroshi:''' Shh! Have you forgotten? We may not pry into Ms. Hina's identity!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 yuka 03.ogg}} '''Yuka:''' At least let's take a photo with him...
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 08.ogg}} '''Hiroshi:''' Ahem. Friend, may we... take a photo with you?
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 09.ogg}} '''Hiroshi:''' We borrowed a Kamera specifically to witness the official unveiling of Ms. Hina's image today...
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 11.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Sure, that's fine.
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 12.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' {{Traveler}}, why do they want to take a picture with me?
:{{DIcon}} It's a Narukami Island custom!
:{{DIcon}} It's a quirky practice of the Yae Publishing House!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 13.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Alright, sure...
:{{Black Screen|''People cluster around Gorou, and he takes a great many photos with them.''}}
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 14.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' That should do it... Right, I should really be heading to the Yae Publishing House to hand in those letters now.
:{{DIcon}} (Phew, managed to keep him in the dark...)
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 kuroda 01.ogg}} '''Kuroda:''' Make way, everyone! Make way!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 kuroda 02.ogg}} '''Kuroda:''' The Ms. Hina billboard is here... Please, make some space, coming through!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 nobuhiro 06.ogg}} '''Nobuhiro:''' Hey, everybody! It's the real Ms. Hina!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 hiroshi 10.ogg}} '''Hiroshi:''' Ms. Hina! Ms. Hina!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 15.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Now I'm curious too... Let's go over and take a look, {{Traveler}}.
:{{DIcon}} No...
:{{DIcon}} You can't...
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 16.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Hmm? Why, what's the problem?
:{{DIcon}} I heard Yae Miko is about to come back!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 17.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Really!? Then we can't stay, let's get out of here!
:{{A|vo wlcop001 1902603 gorou 18.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' As curious as I am to see what all the fuss is about... it'll have to wait until next time. So, {{Traveler}}, please join me again the next time I'm delivering letters.
