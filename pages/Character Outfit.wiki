'''Character Outfits''', colloquially known as '''Costumes''' or '''Skins''', are cosmetics for [[Playable Characters]]. Character Outfits can be previewed and worn in the [[Dressing Room]].

Every character has a Default Outfit, and some have an Alternate Outfit in addition to their Default Outfit. These are automatically unlocked upon obtaining a character.

Certain characters have outfits other than their Default and/or Alternate Outfits; these are unofficially known as "Themed Outfits". Themed Outfits can be purchased from the Character Outfit Shop, accessed from {{nowrap|[[Shop]] ˃ Character Outfits}}. Some themed outfits can be obtained from limited-time [[Events]] for free and become available for purchase from the Character Outfit Shop after the limited-time Event ends. 4-star themed outfits normally cost {{Item|Genesis Crystal|30|x=1,680}}, while 5-star themed outfits normally cost {{Item|Genesis Crystal|30|x=2,480}} and come with special effects, unlike 4-star themed outfits. (Outfit rarity is separate from character rarity.)

The player can purchase or obtain a Themed Outfit for a character even if they do not own them; it will be available to wear after unlocking the character.

Characters wearing Themed Outfits play exclusive [[Voice-Overs]] when they are added to the player's [[party]].
