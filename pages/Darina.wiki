===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]].''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Darina:''' Ah... It's been so long since I took in some fresh and clean air...
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Darina/Sporenado|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Darina:''' We traveling merchants often play cards in private, so you shouldn't be surprised by the difficulty of this challenge...
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Darina:''' Alas... How could this be? No one has ever passed this challenge before...
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
::'''Darina:''' Hello, the environment here is pretty great, right?
::'''Darina:''' Many may say that the air here is too humid, but it's perfect for me.
::'''Darina:''' You must understand that traveling through the desert is torture. If it wasn't for business, would anyone want to land a foot on that Archon-forsaken place?
::{{DIcon}} About the desert...
::'''Darina:''' I'm sure you can imagine it without my help. An endless expanse of sand, the scorching sun, wind mixed with dirt...
::'''Darina:''' Not to mention the dangers that the sandstorms pose, and the ruins filled with strange mechanisms.
::'''Darina:''' According to some legends, there used to be no desert in Sumeru, and it was the battle between [[King Deshret]] and [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|the Greater Lord]] that created the desert...
::'''Darina:''' Oh, but I don't really care how the desert was formed. I'm more interested in when it'll go away.
::'''Darina:''' That's when we Traveling Merchants will be able to do business more safely, after all.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Big dream...
:::'''Darina:''' I haven't been able to dream ever since I grew up, but still, one should dream big.
:::'''Darina:''' Good luck will follow only if you dream big!
:::'''Darina:''' Maybe one day, King Deshret or Greater Lord Rukkhadevata will come back again...
:::'''Darina:''' Either will do. Upon their return, there will be no desert, no pain, no Samiel-Control Engineers, no [[Bimarstan]]'s doctors.
:::'''Darina:''' Hehehe, just saying this cracks me up.
::;(Obtain 3{{Star}} {{Item|Lucky Dog's Clover}})
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Darina:''' Goodbye, I'll be staying here for a while longer...

::{{DIcon}} About the desert...
::'''Darina:''' I'm sure you can imagine it without my help. An endless expanse of sand, the scorching sun, wind mixed with dirt...
::'''Darina:''' Not to mention the dangers posed by sandstorms, alongside ruins filled with strange mechanisms.
::'''Darina:''' Some say that in the past, there weren't any deserts in Sumeru. The desert only appeared due to a battle between King Deshret and the [[Dendro Archon]]...
::'''Darina:''' But every time I bring this up, someone will rebut me, saying that they never fought.
::'''Darina:''' Not that I really care how the desert was formed, really. I'm more interested in when it'll go away.
::'''Darina:''' That's when we traveling merchants will be able to do business more safely, you know?
