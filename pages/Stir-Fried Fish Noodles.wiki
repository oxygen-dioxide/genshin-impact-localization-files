|desc_suspicious = You can barely tell where the rice noodles end and the fish begins. The soft, floppy, mouthfeel is almost unbearable &mdash; how could something that looked this simple actually require so much craft?
|desc_basic      = Created by stir-frying rice noodles, par-cooked fish, and various side dishes in a wok on high flame. The noodles, having absorbed the flavors of various ingredients, are springy and smooth to the taste, making this dish a big hit with diners.
|desc_delicious  = The sumptuous, fresh look is already enough to leave people salivating, and one bite will surely lead to another. The smooth rice noodles and tender fish grant this meal a seat at any gourmet's table, its pedestrian ingredients notwithstanding.
