|description    = After [[Paimon]] and [[Tubby]] had a talk about [[Merusea Village]], the latter combined the former's descriptions with her own imagination to create this stone covered in strange plants.<br>While this stone is quite tall, it is divided into two sections, with the first being a large stone commonly seen in Merusea Village, while the other is an egg-shaped rock responsible for supporting the overall weight.<br>[[Melusine]]s may be small and ill-suited to climbing, but with the aid of simple tools such as stairs, they should be able to get up and down giant stones like these without issue!
