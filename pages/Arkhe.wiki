'''Arkhe''' is a combat and exploration mechanic related to [[Fontaine]].

Arkhe consists of two opposing energies &mdash; {{Pneuma}} and {{Ousia}}. When the two energies meet, an Annihilation reaction will be triggered, causing a variety of effects based on the setting.

==Overview==
Upon hitting an Arkhe-infused entity with the opposite energy, special interactions will be triggered to stun [[Clockwork Meka]], stun [[Breacher Primus]]es in their stressed state, and solve puzzles in the environment.

[[Pneumousia Block|Pneuma and Ousia Blocks]] can be found in the world. Once picked up, the character's next [[Normal Attack|Normal]]/[[Charged Attack|Charged]]/[[Plunging Attack|Plunging]] attack will be infused with its corresponding Arkhe.

[[Fontaine|Fontainian]] characters, as well as the [[Traveler (Hydro)|Hydro Traveler]] can release '''Spiritbreath Thorns''' ({{Pneuma}}) or '''Surging Blades''' ({{Ousia}}) based on their innate Arkhe alignments. These attacks trigger as follow-ups to one of their [[Combat Talent]]s, but have a fixed cooldown once triggered which is separate from the Talent's cooldown. Spiritbreath Thorn and Surging Blade attacks do not apply elemental effects. While [[diving]], characters' attacks will be infused with their Arkhe alignment by default, as they do not have access to their Combat Talents.

The innate Arkhe alignment of Fontainian characters is represented by their [[Vision]] design.

==Trivia==
* Arkhe could be a reference to matter and {{w|antimatter}}. When matter comes into contact with antimatter, they mutually {{w|Annihilation|annihilate}} each other and releases an immense amount of energy as the {{w|Mass–energy equivalence|matter is converted to energy}}.

===Etymology===
* Arkhe or {{Lang|{{w|Arche}}|grc=ἀρχή}} is a Greek word referring to the beginning, origin, or first principle of the world.
** {{Lang|{{w|Pneuma}}|grc=πνεῦμα}} means "breath," often used in a religious context to mean "spirit" or "soul," while {{Lang|{{w|Ousia}}|grc=οὐσία}} is an Ancient Greek philosophical and theological concept translated as "essence" or "substance."
