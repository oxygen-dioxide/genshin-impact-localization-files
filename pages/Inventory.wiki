The '''Inventory''' is where all items obtained on your journey through [[Teyvat]] are stored in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''.

Up to 2,000 unique items can be held at a time, excluding Weapons and Artifacts which are counted separately. The 2,000-item limit is based on item type, and does not count quantities of each item. (For example, if you have 400 Berries, those 400 Berries count as 1 item and not 400.)

==Maximum Item Quantities==
[[File:9999 Items.webp|thumb|The maximum quantity of a single item]]
The maximum quantity that a single item can be held at one time depend on the type of item:
* 9,999 - Most Items<ref group="Note">It is possible to exceed the maximum quantity of a regular item, if the player is given more of that item as a part of a quest. [[:File:Exceeding_Inventory_Limit.jpg|This screenshot]] shows a player with 10,005 [[Rice]] owned, after recieving additional Rice during the quest [[Three to Get Ready, and Here We Go]].</ref>
* 2,000 - Food, Processed Items<ref group="Note">Non-processed food ingredient items such as [[Rice]] are not subject to this lower limit.</ref> and Dust of Azoth

* 20 - [[Straight Shooter]], [[Floaty Splody]], [[Hot Pod]]
* 5 - [[Condensed Resin]]
* 1 - Reusable [[Gadgets]] and most [[Quest Items]]

Some [[Quest Items]], such as [[Childe and Teucer's Mora Pouch]] (35,000) have exceptions to these limits.

[[File:Full Inventory.webp|thumb|The message that pops up when attempting to pick up another item when holding the maximum amount]]
If one attempts to pick up another item while having 9,999 of the item, a [[Errors|message]] pops up on the screen, titled "Hint", and with the text: "No space left in Inventory. Please free up some space and try again." If one attempts to cook a dish while having 2,000 of that dish, a message is displayed stating "No space left in Inventory for another [Dish Name]. Please free up some space and try again."
