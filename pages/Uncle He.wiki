==Profile==
Uncle He is a member of the Chasm Exploration Team that went deeper into the Chasm to look for [[Qi Nan]]'s toy.  Since he has been lost inside the Chasm for years, people thought that he had died and even held a funeral for him, which [[Jinwu]] refused to attend. Living for years in the Chasm, he ate the mushrooms in the area to avoid starvation which gave him itchy ears and an addiction to eating mushrooms.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Missing Miner}}</ref>
