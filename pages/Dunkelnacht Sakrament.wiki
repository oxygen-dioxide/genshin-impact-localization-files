==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Two sections of Fischl's hair are tied into side twin tails with black ribbons, the left of which is decorated with a bat wing pattern. The rest of her hair is left loose. Her eyepatch is black.

Fischl wears a sleeveless black lace dress-like leotard with a black lace collar and purple bow tie, crosses stitched in, and black and violet tailcoats. Her {{Electro}} [[Vision]] is tied to the back of this dress with a bat wing-style purple ribbon. Her upper back has a black tattoo of wings; whether this is permanent or easily removable is unknown.
