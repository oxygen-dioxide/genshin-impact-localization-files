'''Dunkelnacht Sakrament''' is [[Fischl]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
Two sections of Fischl's hair are tied into side twin tails with black ribbons, the left of which is decorated with a bat wing pattern. The rest of Fischl's hair is left loose. Her eyepatch is black.

She wears a sleeveless black lace dress-like leotard with a black lace collar and purple bow tie, crosses stitched in, and black and violet tailcoats. Fischl's Vision is tied to the back of this dress with a bat wing-style purple ribbon. Her upper back has a black tattoo of wings; whether this is permanent or easily removable is unknown.
