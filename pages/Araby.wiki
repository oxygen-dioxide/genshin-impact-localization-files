== Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Araby:''' Hello.
:'''Araby:''' Sorry, I'm observing the sea and can't talk much.
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Araby:''' I'm an {{Rubi|[[Amurta]]|Biology}} researcher from the Akademiya, primarily studying sea creatures.
::'''Araby:''' And responsible for the upkeep of the lighthouse while at it.
::'''Araby:''' To be honest, I know very little about lighthouses. It's the [[Kshahrewar]] researchers who are the experts...
::'''Araby:''' I can't figure out why the sages would make such an arrangement... Probably because I was here already.
::{{DIcon}} About the sages...
:::'''Araby:''' The sages enjoy the highest status in the Akademiya. There is one per school, six in all.
:::'''Araby:''' The sages assign jobs to us researchers.
:::'''Araby:''' Just like I was sent to monitor the ocean and watch the lighthouse.
:::'''Araby:''' It's basically a boring job when there's no sea creatures. The only positive side is its security.
::{{DIcon}} About Kshahrewar...
:::'''Araby:''' [[Kshahrewar]] encompasses many sub-genres. Architecture is just one of them.
:::'''Araby:''' If I studied architecture, I could explain how lighthouses works to you... Unfortunately, I didn't.
:::'''Araby:''' Oh, speaking of architecture, go to northern Sumeru City and see the [[The Palace of Alcazarzaray|Palace of Alcazarzaray]] if you're interested.
:::'''Araby:''' The palace is a masterpiece of Mr. [[Kaveh]], who graduated from [[Kshahrewar]] with honors. It's magnificent and exquisite.
:::'''Araby:''' It's said to be commissioned by a [[Dori|filthy rich merchant]], but I have no clue who that is, so I've got nothing more to tell you.
::{{DIcon}} About marine life...
:::'''Araby:''' They're mainly sea monsters. A group of mysterious creatures that live in the sea and occasionally attack residents of coastal areas.
:::'''Araby:''' With the progress of my research, I've been able to predict roughly when they would appear and issue warnings.
:::'''Araby:''' As soon as the warning is issued, all ships will return to the harbor to avoid disturbing those sea creatures.
:::'''Araby:''' There are exceptions too, of course. A few days ago, I saw a ship leave the harbor after the warning was issued. I don't know if it came back safely.
:::'''Araby:''' Maybe some [[Amandeep|researcher]] planned on observing the sea when the sea monsters are out and about. I feel sorry for the people on the ship.
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it, then.
::'''Araby:''' Yeah, see you.

==Event Dialogue==
===Chromatic Ode of Candies and Roses===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Araby:''' Hello there. Sumeru sure is lively lately, isn't it?
:'''Araby:''' Though I'd love to just calmly observe the sea, the sounds of merriment and celebration sometimes drown out the waves.
:'''Araby:''' But now we must be more vigilant. What if some giant sea monster wants to come celebrate the Dendro Archon's birthday too, but accidentally knocks the lighthouse over?
:'''Araby:''' I've got to be ready to remind it to watch its step, haha!
:'''Araby:''' ...Um, don't take it seriously! I'm just joking!
