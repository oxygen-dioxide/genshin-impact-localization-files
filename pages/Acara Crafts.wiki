===Etymology===
* Between the Chinese, English, and Japanese names, {{zh|阿折罗|rm=}}, Acara, and {{ja|アジャンタ|rm=Ajanta}} are likely all references to the {{w|Ajanta Caves}}, a group of approximately 30 rock-cut Buddhist cave monuments which include wall paintings and rock-cut sculptures. It is one of the largest collections of ancient Indian artwork.
** "Acara" is specifically a reference to {{lang|Ācāra's {{w|Sangharama}} and Grotto|zh=阿折罗伽蓝及石窟}}, a location recorded in ''{{w|Great Tang Records on Western Regions}}'' Volume 11, Chapter 3 (The Country of Mahārāṣṭra)<ref>WikiSource: [https://zh.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=%E5%A4%A7%E5%94%90%E8%A5%BF%E5%9F%9F%E8%A8%98/11&oldid=1504180 大唐西域记: 卷十一 二十三国]</ref> and is now known to be part of the Ajanta Caves. According to the story, the {{w|arhat}} Ācāra built a sangharama inside a grotto to honor his mother.
