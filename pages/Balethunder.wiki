'''Balethunder''' is a [[climate]] that appears in [[Inazuma]].

Although Balethunder is represented with an [[Electro]] icon, the climate by itself never applies {{Electro}} to the player or other targets. Targets will be affected by {{Electro}} only from other sources, such as [[lightning]].

==Overview==
In areas affected by Balethunder, the player will [[#HP Loss|lose HP]] if not protected by an [[Electrogranum]] or [[Thunderwood]]. The player's peripheral vision will also be slightly reduced.

HP loss from Balethunder and the timer counting toward extended exposure will not pause while the player is engaged in dialogue with an NPC or an object.

===Locations===
The following locations are affected by Balethunder:
* [[Mt. Yougou]] (before completing [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual]])
* [[Mikage Furnace]] (before completing [[Tatara Tales]])
* [[Musoujin Gorge]]
* Underground area at the northeast of [[Kamisato Estate]]
* [[Amakumo Peak]] (before completing [[Seirai Stormchasers]])

==HP Loss==
When in an area affected by Balethunder, if an [[Electrogranum]] or [[Thunderwood]] is not nearby, the player will lose '''1% Max HP + 150 HP''' every 2 seconds.

After extended exposure to the Balethunder (about 30 damage ticks, or 60 seconds), the damage per tick will triple to '''3% Max HP + 450 HP''' every 2 seconds. Shielding from the Balethunder with an [[Electrogranum]] or [[Thunderwood]] will reset the counter for extended exposure. Riding a [[Waverider]] will allow the player to avoid taking Balethunder damage, but the timer will still count toward extended exposure.

Some max HP thresholds and how long it takes for all HP to be depleted by Balethunder if extended exposure begins after 60 seconds:
* 60 seconds &mdash; 6,428 HP
* 70 seconds &mdash; 12,000 HP
* 80 seconds &mdash; 22,500 HP
* 90 seconds &mdash; 45,000 HP
* 96 seconds &mdash; 78,000 HP

==Lore==
Balethunder appears in areas with high concentrations of {{Electro}}. These areas may also have [[Electrified Water]] or abnormal [[lightning]].

==Description==
{{Description|'''Excessive Electro...'''
* Some regions in Inazuma are affected by high Electro concentration. While in these regions, you will gradually lose HP. This phenomenon is known as Balethunder.
* Use Electrograna to protect yourself against the harmful effects of Balethunder.}}

==Trivia==
* The crackles that appear at the edge of the screen in Balethunder-affected areas show up in pictures taken with the [[Kamera]] or [[Special Kamera]] but do not show up in pictures taken in [[Photo Mode]].
* Having a character fall to Balethunder will grant the {{Achievement|Shocking... Positively Shocking}}.
* The Balethunder will make a buzzing noise in the background.
* Most areas with Balethunder have no clear visual boundaries. The Balethunder surrounding [[Amakumo Peak]] is an exception: Until the [[Seirai Stormchasers]] quest chain is completed, the areas with Balethunder are marked by a barrier that appears with electric visual effects upon approach.
