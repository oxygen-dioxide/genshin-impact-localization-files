==Steps==
# Start the scored flight!
#* Complete the [[Warrior's Challenge]] with an S (11500 points) or higher
# Talk to [[Manyoya]]
#* You may be teleported after talking to the NPC, so collect the chests from the challenge before doing so

==Gameplay Notes==
* Same as other Warrior's Challenges, three chests &mdash; Common, Exquisite, and Precious &mdash; can be obtained by scoring a B, A, and S, respectively.
* The board near the finish line (atop the peak by the [[Quahuacan Cliff]] [[Statue of The Seven]]) will record the best score.
** Prior to completing this quest, the board reads "Top Flying Scorer &mdash; Matahga."

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the platform)
:'''???:''' "Sing me a song, call the flying [[Saurian]]s and birds who have left their nests..."
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Do you hear that? Someone way up high is singing, and they're pretty good too. Wanna go say hello to them?

;(Reach the platform)
:'''???:''' Nice view, don't you think? Perfect for flying too. Soaring through the skies, following the wind... It's an awesome feeling all around.
:{{DIcon}} Indeed.
:{{DIcon}} Hello there.
:'''???:''' Ho there, warrior! If it's a trial flight you're after, feel free.
:'''???:''' My father built this place for me, but I don't mind sharing it.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks, I was just thinking about giving it a try.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks. I'll think about it when I'm free.
:'''???:''' You're welcome! Anyone who loves flying is a friend of Manyoya's! That's me, by the way.
:'''Manyoya:''' You look a little young for the Saurian flying squad. Are you a reserve rider? Or are you training to become a warrior?
:{{DIcon}} We're just passing adventurers.
:'''Manyoya:''' Oh? I rarely see adventurers so passionate about flight. Until a moment ago, I thought you were training for the flying squad exam.
:'''Manyoya:''' Soaring through the skies... Now that's a feeling you never forget.
:'''Manyoya:''' Doubt you'll find a soul who wouldn't hold onto that freedom no matter what, and I'm no exception.
:'''Paimon:''' You sound like you're in the know. Are you from the flying squad?
:'''Manyoya:''' Haha! I used to be! I'm retired now.
:'''Manyoya:''' I flew for quite some years &mdash; and while that doesn't make me too old by most measures, I was a real veteran in the flying squad.
:'''Manyoya:''' So when my physical condition fell off from where it used to be, it was time to say goodbye.
:'''Manyoya:''' No need to pity me. Haha! I'm not even sad, though it is quite regrettable.
:'''Manyoya:''' Our young Saurian riders have just started taking to the air, but I've already caught a shooting star.
:'''Manyoya:''' Things won't be the same anymore, of course, and I won't get to spend most of my day in the sky, I still have a chance to soar up there.
:'''Manyoya:''' So, that's why I'm here, reminiscing about the life I've given up.
:'''Manyoya:''' Shame that flying solo is quite boring without the company of my squadmates.
:'''Manyoya:''' Oh, yeah, how'd you like to fly with me? Our squad often had little competitions, just for fun.
:'''Manyoya:''' The one with the highest score would get tossed into the air while the lowest would pay for our meal.
:'''Paimon:''' You Saurian riders are a tight-knit bunch, huh?
:'''Manyoya:''' Yeah, everyone's amazing. We're both squadmates and rivals.
:'''Manyoya:''' Ah, not that I'll ever get to enjoy that atmosphere again... Nor can I deny that my skills are on an inexorable downhill slide...
:'''Manyoya:''' ...
:'''Manyoya:''' But even should physical strength decline and judgment dull, experience never stops stacking up.
:'''Manyoya:''' So I might have retired, but that's just from the squad &mdash; not from the skies.
:'''Manyoya:''' So, shall we compete? Think you can catch a veteran Saurian rider in the air?
:{{DIcon}} We're in.
:{{DIcon}} Let me think about it.
:'''Manyoya:''' Huh. I was worried for a moment that you'd think me a freak for abruptly mentioning these things to a youngster like you. Thank goodness you didn't.
:'''Manyoya:''' But let me know when you want to give it a whirl. Let's set this as our objective:
:'''Manyoya:''' Ride your Saurian as far as you can along the designated course within the time limit. I'll help you keep score. The results are divided into 4 grades, and we'll count this as your win if you can beat the second-highest tier.
:'''Manyoya:''' Let me know when you're ready to challenge me.

;(Talk to Manyoya again before starting the challenge, optional)
:'''Manyoya:''' So, are we competing, then?
:'''Manyoya:''' Ride your Saurian at full speed along the course and score as highly as you can within the time limit. {{Color|buzzword|Exceed the second-highest score tier, and we'll call this round in your favor.}}
:{{DIcon}} I'm ready.
::'''Manyoya:''' Nice! Let's head to the starting point.
:{{DIcon}} I need a little more time.
::'''Manyoya:''' Of course. Just let me know when you're ready. Flying has always been about relaxing and having fun.

;(During the challenge, near the start)
:'''Manyoya:''' Chase my shadow, then. If you can keep up, that means your flying skills are first-rate, even among the [[Flower-Feather Clan]].

;(During the challenge, near Tecoloapan Beach)
:'''Manyoya:''' Not bad, but you could still be faster!

;(Talk to Manyoya again if the challenge was failed, exited, or scored below an S, optional)
:'''Manyoya:''' Not that easy, huh?
:'''Manyoya:''' Our captain would be furious if word got out that we flying squad members could be surpassed by just any passing adventurer. Haha!
:'''Manyoya:''' Alright, it's nothing to be upset about. I should be thanking you for keeping my pride intact, if anything.
:'''Manyoya:''' You flew quite well, but it's still too soon for you to surpass me.
:'''Manyoya:''' If you think you can do better, why don't you give it another try? You should never stop trying while you're young. Losing isn't a big deal anyway.
----
;(After scoring an S or higher on the challenge, if this quest was not completed last)
:'''Manyoya:''' Hahaha! You were great! Guess it's true what they say, that the young are bound to surpass the old.
:'''Manyoya:''' Even stars may fall, let alone people.
:'''Manyoya:''' My time is over. Retiring happily was the right choice.
:'''Manyoya:''' ...
:'''Manyoya:''' ... Ah, but it's just so difficult to accept. I'm still young, I don't even have wrinkles. Why do I even have to retire?
:'''Manyoya:''' How could my career be over so soon? I started falling before I could even experience what it was like to reach the top.
:'''Manyoya:''' Had I known I'd have so many regrets...
:'''Manyoya:''' Never mind. If I could do it all again, I would still make the same choices.
:'''Manyoya:''' I would still do my best to join the flying squad, which isn't difficult given my skills. Then I'd wind up retiring at this age again.
:'''Manyoya:''' I've done my best, and all I can do now is accept it.
:'''Manyoya:''' I guess that's life. Many things are beyond our control, and if you dream of being a hero, perhaps you must accept that you can shine for but an instant.
:'''Paimon:''' Manyoya...
:'''Manyoya:''' Not to worry, {{MC|m=he|f=she}}'s a brilliant flier. You had this pitying look the whole time, so why the uneasy face now?
:'''Manyoya:''' Haha! Life's full of surprises, and they'll come whether you accept 'em or not.
:'''Manyoya:''' Consider it a pearl of wisdom from a retired Saurian rider. My issues are my own to solve. Don't let them ruin your mood.
:'''Manyoya:''' I'm impressed. If only my siblings were as calm as you are.
:'''Paimon:''' You have siblings?
:'''Manyoya:''' That's right. Two younger brothers, and unlike you, they're a chore and a half to get through to.
:'''Manyoya:''' They're training their flying skills too&mdash; Well, no. [[Acomitl]]'s just focused on running away from it all, so he might've been hiding instead.
:'''Manyoya:''' Forget about those brats. I can see your talent, clear as day.
:'''Manyoya:''' Try training a little more if you get the time. Who knows? The flying squad may come knocking at your door.
:{{DIcon}} I'll try my best.
:'''Manyoya:''' That's good to hear. I hope I'll catch you flying again. Good luck, young warrior.

;(After scoring an S or higher on the challenge, if this quest was completed last)
:'''Manyoya:''' It's time for my Saurian to return to its nest. Shall I too descend from the stage in the skies?
:{{DIcon}} Don't stop flying.
::'''Manyoya:''' I guess you heard me mumbling to myself, huh?
:{{DIcon}} Manyoya...
::'''Manyoya:''' Oh, there you are.
:'''Manyoya:''' I should make a trip home &mdash; haven't told my family about my retirement yet.
:'''Manyoya:''' I'll have a bunch of free time soon, but I haven't figured out what to do with it.
:'''Manyoya:''' Once I find my bearings, I'll have to face the next stage of my life.
:'''Manyoya:''' So I should hear what my family has to say about it first. My father used to be in the flying squad, and he became a training master after retirement.
:'''Manyoya:''' He's been on this path, so he's got to have some thoughts on the matter.
:'''Manyoya:''' So, I'll be dismantling this place and taking it with me, but I'll leave the course here. Young warriors like you still need a place to train, after all.
:'''Paimon:''' Will we meet again, Manyoya?
:'''Manyoya:''' I don't know. But no matter what choice I make, I don't think I can ever give up on the skies.
:'''Manyoya:''' So as long as you don't stop flying, I think we'll meet again.
:{{DIcon}} Until next time, then.
:'''Manyoya:''' See you, young warrior.
