'''Electrograna''' are [[Grana]] in [[Inazuma]] that can be summoned by [[Thunder Sakura Bough]]s. They follow the player for a set period of time. They can be upgraded using the [[Sacred Sakura's Favor]] system.

Electrogranum can be used to traverse [[Thunder Sphere]]s, travel through [[Thunder Barrier]]s, or protect from the harmful effects of [[Balethunder]].<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/l8YXe7EkmoU?t=1142 Version 2.0 Special Program] (Timestamp: 1142s)</ref> They also negate most {{Color|Electro DMG}} from natural sources.

==Thunder Sphere==
{{Main|Thunder Sphere}}
Thunder Spheres allow for lightning-fast travel through the air. While carrying an Electrograna and in range of a Thunder Sphere a purple laser will point at the player. Upon selecting the traverse button the player will instantly blink past the Thunder Sphere and be propelled high up into the air.

==Thunder Barrier==
{{Main|Thunder Barrier}}
Thunder Barriers impede movement throughout the Overworld. Crossing a Thunder Barrier requires collecting an Electrograna of relevant strength.

==Levels==
Electrograna can be leveled up and gain new abilities via the [[Sacred Sakura's Favor]].
