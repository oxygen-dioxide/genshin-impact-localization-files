{{Quest Description|According to Khedive, anyone carrying his handwritten "letter of recommendation" is guaranteed help from Purbiruni.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the Akademiya entrance)
:'''Paimon:''' Okay, since we're already at the Akademiya... why not try looking for some of the Purbiruni mentioned by Khedive? But where should we start...

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on [[Iris (Sumeru City)|Iris]], optional)
:'''Iris:''' (No, no! I can't go back to the exchange, one more loss in futures trading and I won't even be able to afford food...)

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on [[Hawa]], optional)
:'''Hawa:''' (The ancient characters... They're overlapping...)

;(Talk to Iris)
:'''Iris:''' *sigh* This paltry funding is by no means enough for my research...
:{{DIcon}} Um, excuse me...
:{{DIcon}} About a Purbiruni researcher...
:'''Iris:''' A Purbiruni researcher? Right, you must be looking for Sadife. A guest for him... Quite unusual.
:'''Iris:''' He's been back taking care of things at the Akademiya lately, and should be nearby... What's the matter?
:{{DIcon}} About Khedive's recommendation letter...
:'''Iris:''' Khedive? So his research has wrapped up? Being rich must be nice, having a whole observation team supporting him...
:'''Iris:''' ...whereas I can't even get a subsidy for a field trip...
:{{DIcon}} You know about Khedive?
:'''Iris:''' Of course! We poor researchers, who scrounge for funding and never make any Mora, all know about his fabulous wealth.
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, you mean... this Khedive... and the researchers in his family, they're all loaded!?
:'''Paimon:''' Does this mean we can get a big fat reward?
:'''Iris:''' No way. Khedive is the exception. Don't go getting any unrealistic thoughts about the Purbiruni and Pursina researchers.
:'''Iris:''' Especially those majoring in Astrology and minoring in History and Biology... In their fields, the unlucky ones can't even manage to apply for research funding.
:'''Iris:''' Also, they always repeat something like "Wisdom shall not be sold for gold"...
:'''Iris:''' *ahem* I shouldn't have said that... There's your man. Go ask him about anything else you want to know.

;(Talk to Iris again, optional)
:'''Iris:''' How on earth can I get funding... Ugh...

;(Talk to Hawa, optional)
:'''Hawa:''' I'd better get some rest. All this reading is making me dizzy...
----
;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on [[Sadife]], optional)
:'''Sadife:''' (If the samples are gone...)

;(Talk to Sadife)
:'''Sadife:''' But... Without those samples...
:{{DIcon}} About the Purbirunis...
:{{DIcon}} Excuse me, are you a Purbiruni researcher?
:'''Sadife:''' Yes, and the current Herbad. How may I help you?
:'''Sadife:''' Scholarly inquiries, perhaps? You don't look like an Akademiya researcher, though...
:{{DIcon}} About Khedive's recommendation letter...
:'''Sadife:''' Was this letter really personally written by Khedive? Wait a moment while I read it...
:'''Sadife:''' Hmm, so his research at The Chasm is going well.
:'''Sadife:''' ...Research on Fungi... aquatic environment... fossils... unique geological features... samples...
:'''Sadife:''' Nice, perfect, astounding! He is still an astute scholar and outstanding researcher, of course he didn't disappoint!
:'''Sadife:''' Hmph... I hate admitting this in front of an outsider, but the researchers of Pursina are certainly gifted...
:'''Sadife:''' Moreover, Khedive did emphasize your repeated and exceptional contributions in his letter.
:'''Sadife:''' With your assistance, his research really was "as smooth as a cat soaring in the air," wasn't it?
:{{DIcon}} Please don't say that again...
:{{DIcon}} Hearing it from him was enough...
:'''Sadife:''' Is that so? Ahem, sorry about that.
:'''Sadife:''' Another glorious chapter of Pursina will be written into the record books upon his return to the Akademiya...
:'''Sadife:''' Um... and the thousand-year friendship between Purbiruni and Pursina will be enhanced even further!
:'''Sadife:''' Please accept my gratitude, Traveler, on behalf of the Purbirunis and Pursinas.
:'''Sadife:''' Oh, right! He also mentioned gifts for you... not a problem, just a moment.
:{{DIcon}} Not another letter, please...
:'''Sadife:''' Of course not another letter! For your hard work assisting Khedive's research, it is only fitting that you are compensated with Mora.
:'''Sadife:''' But... Please forgive me. Today was such a busy day, I didn't bring much with me. If you would, please wait here for a second...
:'''Paimon:''' Another proud researcher, huh? But... He seems really different from Khedive.
:'''Paimon:''' He seems... actually poor...
:'''Sadife:''' H-How? We Purbirunis are born researchers, and never worry about something as mundane as money...
:'''Sadife:''' It's just that we invest most of our money in our research. As for everything else... we tighten our belts.
:'''Sadife:''' But this never interferes with our research. Rather, freedom from material things allows us to see the way to wisdom all the more clearly.
:'''Sadife:''' I'll be on my way and get your payment soon. But before that, I must reluctantly make a request...
:'''Sadife:''' Khedive referred to you as a vigorous, experienced, outstanding, elite adventurer the likes of which is rarely seen...
:'''Sadife:''' If you would, I'm saying if! Could you please do me a favor? Not long ago, I was exploring the desert alone for some geological research...
:'''Sadife:''' And... I didn't hire a guard because... I was short on cash. I thought a quick trip would be safe, just get in and get out.
:'''Sadife:''' But I got unlucky, and ran into Treasure Hoarders on the way back.
:'''Sadife:''' Though I managed to escape unharmed back to the city, the case with all of my samples and notes was lost!
:'''Sadife:''' That case is totally worthless to merchants and Treasure Hoarders... But to me! It means the world. Priceless!
:'''Sadife:''' I had no luck finding an adventurer kind enough to help... Traveler, can I ask for your help? Please?
:{{DIcon}} I'll help.
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
:'''Sadife:''' I can't thank you enough! Without you, I don't know what I'd do...
:'''Sadife:''' I marked the spot where I was attacked on the map, here. The case must be somewhere nearby!
:;(Obtain {{Item|Sadife's Marked Map}})

;(Talk to Sadife again, optional)
:'''Sadife:''' I'm counting on you. Your payment will be ready soon.

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Sadife, optional)
:'''Sadife:''' (Khedive... Doesn't that sound like a Pursina? How come this traveler has a hand-written letter of his?)
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|Sadife, the Purbiruni scholar, is in need of help...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach marked area)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, this should be the place. Let's... start... digging...

;(Dig at the northern investigation spot, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' Yikes! Where did these scorpions pop out from? Did we hit their nest or something?
:'''Paimon:''' Now's not the time to zone out. Here they come!

;(Dig at the eastern investigation spot, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' There's nothing here except sand... Paimon can't say she's surprised though...

;(Approach the southwestern investigation point)
:'''???:''' Boss, how did other people find their way here? We...
:'''???:''' Could this person be in the same business as us...? Hmph, I won't let them take what's ours!

;(After defeating the Treasure Hoarders)
:'''Dara:''' Whoa! Stop! Stop that! Just stop!
:'''Dara:''' *panting* Come on, this is absolutely unnecessary. It's just a case of books, take it if you like!
:{{DIcon}} That's all?
:{{DIcon}} You sure there's nothing else?
:'''Dara:''' I swear it! This is all we dug out here!
:'''Dara:''' Other than books, we did find some bottled mud and rocks... Well, there were some nice gems, actually...
:{{DIcon}} Did you take them?
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! You better give those gems back! Those are precious geological samples!
:'''Dara:''' Geological... samples...
:{{DIcon}} Give them back.
:{{DIcon}} On the count of THREE.
:'''Dara:''' Yes! Sure! As you say! All of them! Quick, put everything back now...
:'''Dara:''' See... Everything is back in the case. So, that's our cue to hit the road... Hehe...
:;(Dara leaves)
:'''Paimon:''' Great, that should be everything Sadife wants. Let's bring the case back to him.
:'''Paimon:''' Still, he actually visited the desert alone, collected all those samples and wrote so many notes! Paimon thinks he's a great researcher!
:;(Obtain {{Item|Sadife's Case}})
----
;(Talk to Sadife)
:'''Sadife:''' Traveler, you've returned! About my case...
:{{DIcon}} Here.
:{{DIcon}} I got it.
:'''Sadife:''' Excellent! Thank you so much... To think you had a recommendation letter, and yet I still made you do so much work... Please accept this payment.
:{{DIcon}} As the Purbirunis always say...
:{{DIcon}} Is it that "Wisdom shall not be sold for gold"?
:'''Sadife:''' Huh? So you actually know about that? Yes, Purbiruni does have this commandment...
:'''Sadife:''' But this admonishment is to prevent us from betraying the principles of research for monetary or other external reasons.
:'''Sadife:''' After all, a researcher who pursues research for profit... is unworthy of the title.
:'''Sadife:''' But you went to such great lengths to help me, and thus you deserve a reward commensurate with your efforts.
:'''Sadife:''' Thanks again for your help, and please do not hesitate to reach out in case you need anything.

;(Talk to Sadife again, optional)
:'''Sadife:''' Thanks again for your help, and please do not hesitate to reach out in case you need anything.

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Sadife, optional)
:'''Sadife:''' (Great! Seems relatively undamaged...)
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|Now that Sadife's case has been retrieved, it's time to report to Khedive.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Khedive)
:'''Khedive:''' Look who's here, eh? Did you find a Purbiruni? Not that hard, right?
:{{DIcon}} We did, but...
:{{DIcon}} Something happened...
:'''Khedive:''' Hmm? You seem pretty hesitant. Did someone give you any trouble?
:{{Black Screen|You tell Khedive about everything that happened with Sadife...}}
:'''Khedive:''' Ah, Sadife... He's known for his stubbornness, even his teachers can't always deal with him...
:'''Khedive:''' He even turns down every single source of funding, and insists on working alone, to "keep his research pure"...
:'''Paimon:''' So that's "Wisdom shall not be sold for gold" at work?
:'''Khedive:''' Well, that's the Purbiruni rule... Haha, Pursina is much more flexible.
:'''Khedive:''' Well... To be fair, it's just because that I am rather well off.
:{{DIcon}} How did you make your money?
:{{DIcon}} Why are you so rich?
:'''Khedive:''' What's with that skeptical face? I earned my wealth with hard work, okay? Do you even know how hard futures trading is?
:{{DIcon}} F-Futures trading?
:{{DIcon}} You make money through futures trading?
:'''Khedive:''' I tell you... One has to know transaction volumes, market trends, and then make the right investment decisions...
:'''Khedive:''' At first I thought I'd just invest a little bit for fun, I didn't want it to impact my research...
:'''Khedive:''' Who would have thought that... Ugh! I made more and more Mora, and the money I had sitting in the exchange grew and grew...
:'''Khedive:''' I am a professional researcher! My interest lies in research and academic work! It's scholarly results that I'm after, not Mora! That's what I have been telling myself...
:'''Khedive:''' However, whenever I'm in Sumeru City, I'm drawn to the exchange, and find myself trading futures, transaction after transaction...
:'''Khedive:''' So my bank account balance kept increasing, while my research... No progress AT ALL!
:'''Khedive:''' So! Here I am, having hired an entire team for an expedition to The Chasm. Staying far away from anywhere with an exchange is the only way I can get any research done!
:'''Khedive:''' Without satisfactory results, I... I won't leave The Chasm!
