'''Requests''' are weekly quests that can be obtained by reaching [[Reputation]] Level 2 in a [[region]] of Teyvat.

Requests are completed by submitting the requested item(s) to [[NPC]]s that put out the Requests or, in Inazuma and Sumeru, defeating the requested enemy camp.

A total of 3 requests across all nations can be completed each week. Each request rewards 40 Reputation points and 20,000 [[Mora]].

Unlike [[Bounties]], Requests are treated as [[World Quest]]s and can be navigated to from the Quests menu.
