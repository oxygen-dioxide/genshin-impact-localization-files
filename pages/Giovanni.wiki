===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing ''Canticles of Harmony''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Giovanni:''' *sigh* I wonder when this war will finally be over...
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here?
::'''Giovanni:''' Eh? Ah, it's you, citizen! Well, now that we know where those barbarians have gone, I was going to take a short rest here...
::'''Giovanni:''' After all, even we legionnaires need to rest. We are not those stone folk, who know neither hunger, nor thirst, nor fatigue...
:{{DIcon}} That [[Moce|kid]] over there...
::'''Giovanni:''' Kid? What kid? Wait... You're not talking about Tribunus Mettius, are you?
::'''Giovanni:''' Shh, keep your voice down, or he'll hear you! Of course, Dominus [[Cassiodor]] has said that we should not whip our soldiers, but if the Tribunus hears you, things will get ugly all the same...
:{{DIcon}} End this war?
::'''Giovanni:''' Indeed... Alas! We've been posted here ever since those savages started large-scale border incursions. We've not seen our families for five, almost six years now.
::'''Giovanni:''' I wonder how Martha is doing, or if our children have grown up healthy... Moce was only two at the time. He has never even looked upon his own father...
::'''Giovanni:''' Still, now that Dominus [[Boethius]] is soon to arrive, this war must be soon to end... right?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Giovanni:''' Be wary, citizen. Battle has been a frequent and unwelcome guest here of late.

===Dialogue Set #2=== 
''Available after completing ''Canticles of Harmony''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Giovanni:''' It's been some time since I've gotten a bulk order like this. Looks like I'll be busy...
:'''Giovanni:''' Oh? Hello there. Would you like to order any instruments?
:{{DIcon}} And you are?
::'''Giovanni:''' I am Giovanni, a maker of fine instruments, and the current patrono of the Pasquale family. 
::'''Giovanni:''' My family has been making instruments for many generations. I am part of the 25th generation. 
::'''Giovanni:''' Long before the [[Opera Epiclese]] was built on Erinnyes, my ancestors were the luthiers who tuned the strings for [[Coppelius|Master Coppelius]] and his troupe. 
::'''Giovanni:''' I am proud to say that over the last 500 years, at least a third of Fontaine's instruments have come from my family's workshops. 
::{{DIcon}} A third? That many? 
::'''Giovanni:''' Haha, well, that might be a slight exaggeration... But no matter how you string it, we've certainly made a seventh at least!
::'''Giovanni:''' Though many workshops over in the Court of Fontaine have adopted mechanized production as of late, I can guarantee you that every instrument from our workshops is 100% meticulously handcrafted. You could say this is how we uphold tradition. 
::'''Giovanni:''' In any case, should you wish to order any instruments, simply let me know. 
:{{DIcon}} About the order...
::'''Giovanni:''' Ah... About that. Well, I rarely receive orders from outside Fontaine, so I'm just a bit surprised, that's all. 
::'''Giovanni:''' Perhaps it's because of the [[Iridescence Tour]]'s influence. Regardless, it's nothing of note. 
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it. Bye. 
::'''Giovanni:''' Goodbye. Remember to come and find me should you wish to place an order for any instruments.

===Dialogue Set #3=== 
''Available after completing ''Latecoming Homecoming''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Giustino:''' Giovanni, I've already finished lacquering these instruments.
:'''Giovanni:''' Good. I didn't think you'd still remember the craft of making instruments after all these years.
:'''Giustino:''' Haha... I've utterly forgotten the complex process of crafting the peg, but the painting process? Oh, I still remember that.
:'''Giustino:''' It was the most basic of basics, after all. Father scolded me countless times while I was still an apprentice. Couldn't forget it if I tried.
:'''Giovanni:''' Hmph. So you do remember how instruments are made. Do you remember what makes a man, though?
:'''Giovanni:''' ...Forget it. Take a break first. I'll handle the rest of the work &mdash; but watch closely, and learn well.
