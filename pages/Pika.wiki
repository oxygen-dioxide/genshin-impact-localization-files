'''Pika''' is a [[Shiba]] located beside [[Yamaue]] and [[Tokunaga]] in front of [[Naganohara Fireworks]] in [[Inazuma City]], [[Inazuma]].

Not much is known about Pika, however, it seems to be well-acquainted with the duo comedians Yamaue and Tokunaga. Pika can be seen interacting with them by giving responses such as wiggling its tail upon being asked questions.
