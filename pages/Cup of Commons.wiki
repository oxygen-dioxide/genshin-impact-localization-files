|description = One of the six lost offerings scattered throughout The Chasm. Neither stone nor gem, it somehow still became part of the Treasure Hoarders' loot hoard.<br />It has been filled by turns with fine wine, fair treasure, and blood. Now, its previous shame has been washed away, and it is ready to take on new memories.
