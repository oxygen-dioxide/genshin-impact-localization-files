'''Nightsoul's Blessing''' is a combat and exploration mechanic related to [[Natlan]].

It allows [[character]]s from Natlan to utilize Phlogiston Engraving to communicate with the tribe's [[Wayob]] and [[Ley Line]]s and enhance their strength within the nation.

==Nightsoul's Blessing==
When in the Nightsoul's Blessing state, the character's movement and combat capabilities will be enhanced. When entering the state, a certain number of Nightsoul points will be received.

If a Natlan character is in the player's party but is not the active character, swapping to them while the active character is running or jumping will automatically activate Nightsoul's Blessing while in Natlan. There is a short cooldown period between transitions made in this manner.

==Nightsoul Burst==
Nightsoul Bursts are triggered when dealing Elemental DMG to an opponent while the party contains a Natlan character. Upon triggering a Nightsoul Burst, a white outline will flash around the edges of the screen as a visual indicator. Depending on the number of Natlan characters in the party, the [[CD]] will be 18 seconds for 1 character, 12 seconds for 2 characters, and 9 seconds for 3 or more characters. Other effects from [[Talent]]s, [[Artifact]]s, etc. can be triggered by Nightsoul Bursts to grant additional effects.

==Nightsoul Points==
Nightsoul points are consumed while in the character is in the Nightsoul's Blessing state. Once all Nightsoul points are consumed, if the player is in Natlan, [[Phlogiston]] will be consumed instead.

==Nightsoul Transmission==
When a Natlan character's avatar lights up, switching to them will trigger Nightsoul Transmission, which allows swift movement depending on the character's [[Night Realm's Gift Passive]]. This can occur during certain movement modes such as [[sprinting]], [[climbing]], [[swimming]], or [[jumping]].

==Nightsoul-Aligned DMG==
Certain DMG dealt by Natlan characters are considered Nightsoul-aligned. There is no difference between Nightsoul-aligned DMG and regular DMG in most situations, but Nightsoul-aligned DMG is more effective in certain situations, such as breaking [[Void Ward]]s and the shields summoned by [[Wayob Manifestation|Wayob Manifestations]].
