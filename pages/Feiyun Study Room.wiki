|description    = There are many ways to fashion a study in [[Liyue]], but luxury is optional, for the learned prefer "spirit" and "elegance." A potted plant here balances out the moisture in the room, and the table and shelves exude a light woody fragrance that combines with the plain layout and the sunset glow of the lamps to inspire genius and elevate writing.<br>They say that many years ago, a certain guest at [[Feiyun Slope]] laid just such a study out, and this design was taken up by the previous boss of [[Wanwen Bookhouse]]. Thus, it was ever after known as the Feiyun Study Room and became recognized throughout Liyue.
