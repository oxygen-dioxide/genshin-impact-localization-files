==Profile==
Caishan is a merchant from [[Liyue]]. She was traveling to [[Mondstadt]] when she was robbed and taken hostage by [[Treasure Hoarders]] north of the [[Whispering Woods]]. However, [[Barbara]] noticed the situation and managed to save her with the [[Traveler]]'s help. In gratitude, Caishan offered some of her remaining items as a reward: [[Sweet Flower]]s, Liyue Chilibrew, or [[Mora]].
