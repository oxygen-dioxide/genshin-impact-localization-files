|desc_5 = If the player is at a different elevation or is out of range, the Mitachurl roars before digging a [[Dendro Slime]] out of the ground and throws it at the player, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}}.

==Strategy==
The Mitachurl's wooden shield can be burned using {{Pyro}}. Note that [[Rain]] (and other sources of {{Hydro}}) can extinguish a burning wooden shield.

During rainy [[weather]], {{Cryo}} can be used to [[Frozen|freeze]] the Mitachurl and attack. While shield-wielding Mitachurls appear to be holding their shields up when frozen, any attacks that do not shatter freeze will bypass the shield and deal damage directly to the Mitachurl.
