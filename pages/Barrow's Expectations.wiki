[[File:Barrow's Expectations Map.png|300px]]

Barrow and his wife swore to travel around Fontaine and spent their entire lives on the road.<br>
They had a daughter, [[Penny]], a lovely girl who loved swimming and fish.<br>
They left her with their best friend, [[Rouge]], to spare her the disruption and rootlessness.<br>
Despite the lack of a fixed abode, Barrow's life is full of joy, adventure, and surprises, and he hopes his child shall share that same happiness.

Barrow also wishes the reader of this letter that happiness. Why not go and find the surprise he has hidden for you?<br>
Hint: The "surprise" is between the "claws." {{color|buzzword|Solve the riddle between the "claws"}} to get your surprise.
