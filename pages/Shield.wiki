'''Shields''' are protective barriers that block damage to characters or enemies. Player character shields work differently from enemy shields. Below mostly discusses character shields. Enemy shields and breaking them are discussed in [[Shields/Enemy]] and [[Shields/Shield Gauge Data]].

==Character Shields==
Characters can gain shields through the [[Crystallize]] elemental reaction or by using certain [[talents]] or [[weapons]].
These shields have a set amount of health determined when the shield is created; when the active character takes damage, damage is dealt to shield health first, and any remaining damage afterward is subtracted from the character's health normally.
Shields often have intrinsic damage absorption bonuses that increase the amount of damage absorbed by each shield health point (usually against certain types of elemental damage).

When a character has more than one shield, the damage dealt by an enemy will affect every active shield simultaneously.<ref>HoYoverse News: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/6085 Developers Discussion]</ref>

===Crystallize Shields===
{{main|Crystallize}}
Shields gained from picking up the Elemental Shards dropped by Crystallize reactions have shield health based on the level and [[Elemental Mastery]] of the character that triggered the reaction. These shields additionally have 250% effectiveness against elemental damage of the same element; in other words, they only take 40% as much damage when absorbing damage of their own element.

:<math>\text{HP}_\text{Crystallize Shield} = \text{HP}_\text{Base Crystallize Shield} \times (1 + \% \text{ EM Bonus})</math>

'''Base Crystallize Shield HP''' is only affected by the character level. For level scaling and other details, see [[Crystallize]].

When the shield takes damage, the damage is scaled down based on the shield's elemental damage absorption bonuses and the active character's [[Attributes#Shield Strength|Shield Strength]] attribute.

:<math>\text{DMG}_\text{Crystallize Shield} = \frac{\text{DMG Incoming}}{(\% \text{ Element Bonus}) \times (1 + \% \text{ Shield Strength}_\text{Active Character})}</math>

If the damage exceeds the shield's health, the damage taken by character is the excess damage multiplied by the same shield bonus multipliers:
:<math>\text{DMG}_\text{Taken} = \text{DMG Excess} \times (\% \text{ Element Bonus}) \times (1 + \% \text{ Shield Strength}_\text{Active Character})</math>

===Talent Shields===
Shields created by talents usually have health based on the character's DEF or Max HP.
Shield damage is scaled down by any elemental damage absorption bonuses and the active character's [[Attributes#Shield Strength|Shield Strength]] attribute. Some character [[Talents]] and Constellations may grant additional damage absorption bonuses to shields generated by the character; these apply multiplicatively.<ref>NGA: [https://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=24188107 {{Lang|zh=迪奥娜e技能护盾数值计算}}]</ref>

See [[Shields/Comparison]] for a comparison of character shield strength, bonus, duration and cooldown.

:<math>\begin{align}\text{HP}_\text{Talent Shield} = (& \text{HP}_\text{Base Talent Shield}) \times (1 + \% \text{ DMG Absorption Bonus}) \times (1 + \% \text{ Constellation Bonus})\end{align}</math>

The damage taken on talent shields is therefore:
:<math>\text{DMG}_\text{Talent Shield} = \frac{\text{DMG Incoming}}{( \% \text{ Element Bonus}) \times (1 + \% \text{ Shield Strength}_\text{Active Character})}</math>

If the damage exceeds the shield's health, the damage taken by character is the excess damage multiplied by the same shield bonus multipliers:
:<math>\text{DMG}_\text{Taken} = \text{DMG Excess} \times (\% \text{ Element Bonus}) \times (1 + \% \text{ Shield Strength}_\text{Active Character})</math>

===Other Shields===
The [[Geovishap Hatchling]] drops Geo Elemental Shards that grant a Geo shield when picked up (on contact) by a character.

==Improving Shields==
===Elemental Resonance===
The {{Element|Geo|24}} [[Enduring Rock]] Elemental Resonance increases shield strength by 15%.

==Enemy Shields==
{{Main|Shields/Enemy}}
Certain enemies also have shields that prevent or reduce damage, or grant them the ability to use certain attacks, but their mechanics differ from player shields.
Instead of functioning as an extra health bar (with additional damage absorption bonuses), enemy shields are usually based on elemental gauges.

Enemies with shields include:
