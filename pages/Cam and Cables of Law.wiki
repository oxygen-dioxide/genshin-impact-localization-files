|description  = A new type of component the [[Keqing|Yuheng]] commissioned the [[Blackcliff Forge]] to make. According to the smiths, its dynamic load "wouldn't lose to adeptal mechanisms." By installing it on its counterpart prototype weapon, the latter's power can be considerably increased.<br>The world ruled by humanity is like the taut bowstring of a quality bow: It can only avoid snapping and collapsing with the appropriate quantity of tension.
