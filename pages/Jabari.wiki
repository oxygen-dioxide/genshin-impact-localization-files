{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Jabari:''' Answer this question real quick, would you? Fish, or meat?
:{{DIcon}} I'll take them all.
::'''Jabari:''' ...Well, that was quick.
::'''Jabari:''' But unfortunately, I'm afraid that only one meat dish is permitted at a time at my family's table.
::'''Jabari:''' Otherwise, my wife will talk my ear off about "earnings" and "saving Mora" all night, starting at the dinner table.
:{{DIcon}} Wait. Fish don't count as meat?
::'''Jabari:''' ...Well, that's an unexpected reply!
::'''Jabari:''' Does fish count as meat? Hmm. I suppose each person might have a different answer in mind...
::'''Jabari:''' But that's not the problem here. I'm just wondering what I should have for dinner.
::'''Jabari:''' Speaking of which, are you hungry? Would you like to have a little something?
::'''Jabari:''' I don't mean to brag, but I do make some excellent food. Drop by if you've got the time and try some!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I'm alright, but my companion might be hungry.
:::'''Jabari:''' Ah yes, I can see how that might become a problem.
:::'''Jabari:''' The troubles of a teammate by your side can be even harder to handle than your own.
:::'''Jabari:''' Whatever the case, why don't you try some?
::;(Obtain {{Item|Delicious Aaru Mixed Rice|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} Either?
::'''Jabari:''' Hmm... Well, that's not a useful reply, but fair enough, I'll give it some more thought.

:'''Sania:''' Hmmm. It seems that this is all the Mora I have at the moment...
:'''Sania:''' Ugh. How am I supposed to live like this?
:'''Jabari:''' Hey, hey. Relax. Relax...
:'''Jabari:''' Come on now. I've done some handiwork recently and got plenty of food in return, didn't I?
:'''Sania:''' And so what? You want us to go on living from hand to mouth like this? What are we going to do when those menial jobs stop making us Mora?
:'''Sania:''' I'm not going to just watch that happen, unlike you!
:'''Sania:''' *sigh* Sometimes I wonder if I'm the only one in this family who actually worries about our future here...
