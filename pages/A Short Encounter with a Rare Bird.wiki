==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You bumped into a Forest Ranger, Shefket, who's carrying out ecological research in Sumeru's forests, and he told you about his Dusk Bird research. Can he really capture a Dusk Bird?}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After killing the Shroomboars)
:'''???:''' Hey, you over there! The one who just hunted that wild boar with mushrooms on its back... Can you come over here? I have something to discuss with you!

;(Talk to the Forest Ranger)
:'''???:''' Oh, I'm really sorry if I'm bothering you, but I have something to discuss...
:'''???:''' Can I have a piece of that Shroomboar you just hunted?
:'''Paimon:''' Shroomboar... That wild boar with mushrooms on its back?
:'''???:''' Yup, exactly. They're always rolling in the mud of Sumeru, so spores stick to their fur and grow into mushrooms.
:'''???:''' Haha, some say the mushrooms gradually eat away at the wild boar while they grow... Likewise, the Shroomboar's meat gains a unique mushroom aroma, and becomes expensive...
:{{DIcon}} Sounds creepy.
:{{DIcon}} Sounds scary.
:'''???:''' Haha! It's just a rumor. Shroomboars can eat the mushrooms on each other's backs during the winter or when they have nothing to eat.
:'''???:''' Mushrooms, on the other hand, can spread their spores even further with the wild boars carrying them... It's actually a healthy symbiotic relationship...
:'''Shefket:''' Ooh, forgive me, I don't think I've introduced myself. I'm Shefket, and you?
:'''Paimon:''' This is Paimon!
:{{DIcon}} I'm (Traveler).
:'''Shefket:''' So, (Traveler) and Paimon, got it. I knew you weren't ordinary when I saw how swift-footed you were while hunting that Shroomboar...
:'''Shefket:''' Actually, I'm carrying out research on wild animals, but... *sigh* I can't capture those Shroomboars.
:'''Shefket:''' They either run or ram me to the ground as soon as I get close... If this goes on, my waist is going to give way before I even start my research...
:'''Shefket:''' So, when I saw how easily you took down a Shroomboar, I had to try and ask if I could purchase some of its meat.
:'''Paimon:''' Is there something special about it? It looks just like the meat from any other wild boar...
:'''Shefket:''' Oh my, of course we have to carry out an investigation to find out the differences! Sell it to me. I'll pay you well.
:{{DIcon}} (Give the Shroomboar meat to him...)
:'''Shefket:''' Oh, thank you so much! I can carry on with my research now!
:'''Paimon:''' Just what kind of research is Shefket carrying out?
:'''Shefket:''' It's just some ordinary ecological surveys. Sometimes, I capture animals and research their growth...
:'''Shefket:''' Just a single animal can tell me things about the recent growth of its entire colony. It's really quite miraculous...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon can tell how much you love animals, Shefket!
:'''Shefket:''' Yes, I... I've always loved them. I've spent so much time studying them. The ecology in the forests of Sumeru is absolutely fascinating...
:'''Shefket:''' Alright, I've got the Shroomboar meat. I need a Dusk Bird next.
:'''Shefket:''' (Traveler), have you seen a Dusk Bird before? It's a gorgeous bird found in the {{color|buzzword|south of Apam Woods}}.
:'''Shefket:''' It's a bird unique to Sumeru. Even the Akademiya researchers often use it to send messages... Though it's capable of long distance travel, it hates rain and will hide away on rainy days.
:'''Shefket:''' Well, it's time for me to go. A Dusk Bird... I hope I'll be able to capture one on my own... Haha, I can't keep relying on others.
:'''Shefket:''' But if you're willing... Ahem... I hope you'll keep an eye out for me. I'm willing to buy the Dusk Birds you capture.
{{Dialogue end}}
----
{{Quest Description|update|You bumped into a Forest Ranger, Shefket, who was carrying out ecological research in Sumeru's forests, and he offered to buy Dusk Birds from you if you could capture any. Try your luck in the south of Apam Woods frequented by Dusk Birds might be a good idea. But Dusk Birds will hide on rainy days, and are very vigilant creatures. If you let one get away by accident, you'll have to wait for quite some time before you can capture one again.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(If the Dusk Birds fly away)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! The Dusk Birds flew away all of a sudden... Guess we have to come back later.

;(After capturing or killing a Dusk Bird)
:'''???:''' Guess you're that Shefket. Hmph! Hand over the Dusk Birds you've caught!
:'''Paimon:''' Ah! It's the Eremites, (Traveler)! They're trying to take the Dusk Bird!

;(After defeating the Eremites)
:'''Shefket:''' Good grief, it's (Traveler) and Paimon! I'm so lucky to have met both of you. Can you come over here?

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Shefket, optional)
:'''Shefket:''' (Dusk Birds' feathers are so beautiful...)

;(Talk to Shefket)
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, you're that field researcher!
:'''Shefket:''' What do you mean? Haha, my name is Shefket. We've met before. You even sold some Shroomboar meat to me.
:{{DIcon}} Really?
::'''Paimon:''' Yup! He paid us much higher than the price of ordinary wild boar meat...
:{{DIcon}} That did happen...
::'''Paimon:''' Yes, Paimon remembers now! It's the animal lover, Shefket!
:'''Paimon:''' So, Shefket, what are you doing here?
:'''Shefket:''' Hahaha! It's embarrassing to say, but my research is still ongoing...
:'''Shefket:''' I need a Dusk Bird, but I still haven't caught one... My research progress is worrying... And that's not the worst.
:'''Paimon:''' That's not the worst?
:'''Shefket:''' I even encountered The Eremites. They raised their weapons at me on sight...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, so the Eremites mistook us for you...
:'''Shefket:''' Huh? Did they? Guess that's because... That's definitely because they don't understand that I'm trying to protect the Dusk Birds...
:'''Shefket:''' You see, I'm sure the Eremites here think of the Dusk Birds as their own property. That's why they're against me collecting a specimen for research.
:'''Shefket:''' After all, the feathers of a Dusk Bird are quite expensive...
:'''Shefket:''' Right, do you know that the Dusk Birds grow multicolored feathers as camouflage in the forest?
:'''Shefket:''' But in the end, many hunt them for those same gorgeous, multicolored feathers. It's really sad.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh no...
:'''Shefket:''' I don't have the courage to face the Eremites like you... *sigh*
:'''Shefket:''' Right, can you sell me a feather from the Dusk Bird you hunted?
:'''Shefket:''' Just like before, I'll compensate you generously!
:{{DIcon}} (Give the Dusk Bird feather to him...)
:'''Shefket:''' Haha, I've got a Dusk Bird feather too... Now, I'm more than halfway done with my investigation.
:'''Shefket:''' But this feather...
:'''Paimon:''' What's wrong? Is there something wrong with it?
:'''Shefket:''' No, there isn't. Its quality just isn't very good... Oh, I mean, I can discern that the Dusk Birds in this area don't seem to be growing very well.
:'''Shefket:''' Well, I'll have to go around and gather more feathers. It's the only way I can find out what happened to the entire colony of Dusk Birds...
:'''Shefket:''' I heard there's a different colony of Dusk Birds in the {{color|buzzword|north of Apam Woods}}. It looks like I'll have to look for Dusk Birds there...
:'''Shefket:''' Hmm, time to leave now! May we meet again, (Traveler) and Paimon!

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Paimon:''' Could Shefket catch a Dusk Bird all alone...? We might as well have a look there...
{{Dialogue end}}

{{Quest Description|update|Shefket, the one who is conducting ecological research, says he's willing to buy more Dusk Birds. Try your luck at the north of Apam Woods as he says. Keep in mind, Dusk Birds will hole up on rainy days and are very vigilant creatures. If you let one get away by accident, you'll have to wait for quite some time before you can capture one again.}}

;(If the Dusk Birds fly away)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! The Dusk Birds flew away all of a sudden... Guess we have to come back later.

;(After hunting a Dusk Bird)
:'''Orhan:''' Stop it! Stop it! Why are you hunting Dusk Birds here again!?
:'''Orhan:''' I get it now! You're the poachers who've been hunting here! And you're poaching my Dusk Birds again!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph! These Dusk Birds don't belong to you! You didn't raise them, did you?
:'''Orhan:''' I didn't, but... They are my Dusk Birds because I say so.
:'''Orhan:''' I'm in charge of protecting them!
:'''Paimon:''' You're in charge of protecting them?
:'''Orhan:''' Yes, I'm Orhan. I'm under orders from the Corps of Thirty to protect the Dusk Bird colony from poachers!
:'''Orhan:''' You don't believe me? Take a look at these Orders signed by the Corps of Thirty's Sheriff.

:'''Orhan shows you the Orders. It is signed by the Corps of Thirty.'''

:'''Paimon:''' Huh? But that's not what we heard... Isn't an ecological survey being carried out on Dusk Birds?
:'''Orhan:''' There's no such thing...
:'''Paimon:''' ...Did Shefket deceive us?
:'''Orhan:''' Shefket... Shefket again... Oh, Dendro Archon! You've been utterly duped by that guy.
:'''Orhan:''' He disguises himself as a Forest Ranger to trick people, but he's actually working with the Treasure Hoarders to sell the precious materials he gathers from rare animals...
:'''Paimon:''' How could that be...
:{{DIcon}} I have to admit...
:{{DIcon}} Shefket tricked us...
:'''Orhan:''' You're not the first adventurer to be tricked by him. He's always making adventurers help him and hiding behind them. He's as slippery as an eel...
:'''Paimon:''' What do we do, (Traveler)? We've hunted quite a few Dusk Birds...
:{{DIcon}} Let's hope they serve balanced meals in prison...
::'''Paimon:''' NOOOO! Paimon doesn't want to get locked up by the Corps of Thirty!
::'''Orhan:''' ...It's not that serious. The Dusk Bird colony is quite huge, so Dusk Birds are not that rare. You didn't know what you were doing either, so it's not serious enough to get locked up for that.
:{{DIcon}} Is it too late for us to flee from Sumeru?
::'''Paimon:''' It can't be helped. We'll have to return another time for the parts of Sumeru we haven't explored yet.
::'''Orhan:''' I can't just watch as you flee right in front of me, and the Corps of Thirty has surrounded the area to combat the recent rise in poaching!
::{{DIcon}} Nooo, I don't want to get locked up by the Corps of Thirty!
::'''Orhan:''' ...Calm down. The Dusk Bird colony is quite huge, so Dusk Birds are not that rare. You didn't know what you were doing either, so it's not serious enough to get locked up for that.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon gets it...
:'''Orhan:''' But you can't escape being punished for it... I want to say that, but... Ahem, there's an opportunity for you to redeem yourselves!
:'''Paimon:''' An opportunity to redeem ourselves?
:'''Orhan:''' Yes, I don't know why, but Shefket seems to need a large amount of Dusk Bird feathers... We can use that as bait...
:'''Orhan:''' For example, we can spread the word that there's a large group of Dusk Birds resting on the mountain at the {{color|buzzword|east of Apam Woods}}. He'll definitely take the bait.
:'''Orhan:''' But he's a cunning guy, so even the slightest action we take will scare him off. That's where both of you come in!
:'''Orhan:''' Hmm... I think I heard the {{MC|m=blond|f=blonde}} one's name is (Traveler). What about the flying one?
:'''Paimon:''' This is Paimon.
:'''Orhan:''' Oh, (Traveler) and Paimon. I need you to make contact with Shefket.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon gets it. He'll let his guard down with us...
:'''Orhan:''' Exactly. We'll set up an ambush, so it'll be up to you to keep him busy.
:'''Orhan:''' Once you meet him... Alright, just shout "We know everything you've done!" as the signal, and we'll get him!
:'''Orhan:''' What do you think?
:{{DIcon}} No problem.
:'''Orhan:''' Let's do it! Let's spread the news right now. Leave Sumeru City to me. Ferit, you take Gandharva Ville, and use this opportunity to find out if anyone's colluding with the Treasure Hoarders.
:'''Orhan:''' Pamuk, around Vimara Village...
:'''Pamuk:''' Got it, Boss! Don't worry, I'll spread the fake information!
:'''Orhan:''' Alright, we're gonna get that poacher this time!
:'''Orhan:''' I'll leave the rest to you, (Traveler). We must draw him out of hiding.

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Paimon:''' Let's head to the mountain in the east of Apam Woods soon. We'll bring that liar to justice if we meet him there!

{{Quest Description|update|Shefket turned out to be a fraud. Lay a trap with The Eremites to stop his increasingly rampant poaching. Go to the mountains east of Apam Woods and catch Shefket.}}

;(If the Dusk Birds fly away)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! The Dusk Birds flew away all of a sudden... Guess we have to come back later.

;(After hunting a Dusk Bird)
:'''Shefket:''' Oh? If it isn't (Traveler) and Paimon! I'm sure you're here because you've heard about the Dusk Bird colony resting here.
:'''Shefket:''' This isn't an environment the Dusk Birds usually favor, so why would they come here? Perhaps it's something worth studying.
:'''Paimon:''' Shefket...
:'''Shefket:''' Haha, what is it? Oh, I'm sure you want to know if I'm still buying Dusk Bird feathers, right? Of course I am, their feathers are very precious.
:{{DIcon}} "We know everything you've done!"
:'''Shefket:''' ...?
:'''Shefket:''' Why did you say that? Do you suddenly feel proud of me for conducting such a hard research?
:'''Paimon:''' (Huh? What's going on? Why haven't the Eremites come? We had an agreement with Orhan... (Traveler), maybe Paimon should give it a try.)
:'''Paimon:''' "We know everything you've done!"
:'''Shefket:''' Paimon too? Oh my, it's alright. It's my duty, and you've helped me so much already.
:'''Shefket:''' The process may be difficult, but it's all for a cause. It's for the animals of the forest...
:'''Paimon:''' It isn't for the animals! It's all for yourself!
:{{DIcon}} We know everything you've done!

:'''Orhan rushes out of the forest just as you finish speaking...'''

:'''Orhan:''' Yes, Shefket, the Corps of Thirty is officially placing you under arrest for the crimes of impersonating a Forest Ranger, instigating unknowing adventurers to carry out poaching, and colluding with Treasure Hoarders!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, Orhan, what took you so long? We almost lost our voices shouting the signal just now!
:'''Orhan:''' Uh... We had a little accident...
:'''Shefket:''' What's the Corps of Thirty doing here? What signal?
:'''Shefket:''' "We know everything you've done!", so that's what you meant. I even felt a little touched just now!
:'''Paimon:''' Liar!
:{{DIcon}} Just surrender!
:'''Shefket:''' Ugh, I should have known you were with the Corps of Thirty... Hmph! The news about a Dusk Bird colony here was your doing too, right?
:'''Orhan:''' Exactly. You've fallen into a trap, Shefket. I bet a veteran con man like you never expected to get conned yourself! The Corps of Thirty will treat you really, really well!
:'''Shefket:''' *sigh* I guess there's no point trying to deny it. I'm very fond of the animals in Sumeru, but sometimes, just fondness is useless.
:'''Shefket:''' I couldn't get into the Akademiya. All I could do was some meaningless surveys. In the end, others only thought of me as a weirdo wandering the forest.
:'''Shefket:''' I need Mora... Not just for my research, but so that I can shut the mouths of those people who talk behind my back...
:'''Orhan:''' So you started targeting the animals you knew best? Hmph! You caused greater losses just because you understand them! Isn't that something!
:'''Shefket:''' I had no other choice...
:'''Orhan:''' Stop trying to talk your way out of it! I will never believe your lies!
:'''Paimon:''' The liar has finally been apprehended.
:'''Paimon:''' So, Orhan, what took you so long?
:'''Orhan:''' Oh, that... Ferit and Pamuk never returned, and I couldn't find them. After much consideration, I decided to come here myself. Haha...
:'''Orhan:''' Didn't I make it just in time? My timing was perfect.
:{{DIcon}} That sounds questionable...
:{{DIcon}} Just a little later and it wouldn't have made a difference...
:'''Shefket:''' Hmph! What? I expected many of the Corps of Thirty to be lying in ambush here. But it's just one?
:'''Shefket:''' I planned to feign capture and look for an opportunity to escape, but hah! It doesn't look necessary at all now!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh?
:'''Shefket:''' Don't tell me you think just the two of you and... a lousy guard from the Corps of Thirty can capture me?
:'''Shefket:''' Today's your unlucky day because it just happens to be the day I promised to deliver the goods to the Treasure Hoarders, so they're lying in ambush just over there. You're not the only one who can call for reinforcements!
:'''Shefket:''' Hurry! Get rid of them!

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! That's a lot of Treasure Hoarders!
:'''Orhan:''' W&mdash;We have no other choice, it's the best opportunity to get him! Let's do this!

;(After defeating the enemies)
:'''You make short work of the Treasure Hoarders.<br />Ferit and Pamuk arrive too...'''

:'''Ferit:''' Boss!
:'''Pamuk:''' Sorry we're a little late...
:'''Paimon:''' A little late? Everything's over...
:'''Ferit:''' Oopsy...
:'''Orhan:''' Where on earth did you two go!? I couldn't even find you... Whoa! You reek of alcohol...
:'''Ferit:''' Hehe... But the best way to spread information has always been pretending to be drunk...
:'''Pamuk:''' And then divulging the false information.
:{{DIcon}} You're 100 percent drunk...
:'''Orhan:''' *sigh* If it wasn't for (Traveler), I would have gotten a good beating from the Treasure Hoarders.
:'''Orhan:''' I must admit, I wasn't expecting (Traveler) to take the Treasure Hoarders down so easily...
:'''Paimon:''' Of course! (Traveler) is stronger than {{MC|m=he|f=she}} looks!
:'''Orhan:''' No wonder. I mean, I got taken out with great ease when I tried to stop you earlier, but this... exceeded my expectations a little.
:{{DIcon}} You're too kind.
:{{DIcon}} It's going to get to my head if you don't stop!
:'''Orhan:''' Alright, Shefket. We... I mean (Traveler) has taken down the Treasure Hoarders you were relying on. Now, do you have anything else to say?
:'''Shefket:''' I&mdash;I... Actually, the mental trauma I experienced as a child is the cause of all this...
:'''Shefket:''' Let me explain... It happened when I was just a young boy...
:{{DIcon}} Nobody cares!
:{{DIcon}} Stop making up stories!
:'''Orhan:''' Alright, you've caught this guy and atoned for your crimes. Next time, choose wisely when you decide to believe someone!
:'''Orhan:''' If only you listened to me from the very beginning...
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! You attacked us without saying a word!
:'''Orhan:''' I admit... I do that when I get anxious. I guess I should try to be calmer next time.
:'''Orhan:''' But I hope there isn't a next time. Be careful, and don't just believe anyone...
:{{DIcon}} Got it, got it!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon'll bear that in mind.
