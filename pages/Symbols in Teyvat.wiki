The following '''symbols in Teyvat''' are prominent icons, motifs, and symbols that recur throughout the world of [[Teyvat]].

In some cases, they predate the seven nations and are used to represent the ancient civilizations that predate the rise of [[The Seven]].

==Triquetra==
[[File:Item Mora.png|thumb|The triquetra on the Mora]]
The '''triquetra''' is a symbol that, in real-life, has been used throughout the world since ancient times. While the original intent of the symbol has been lost to time, it has been used to symbolize the {{w|Triple deity|triple goddesses}}, the Holy Trinity, and other threefold concepts. (For additional information, see {{w|Triquetra}} on Wikipedia.)

Similarly, in Teyvat, it appears on several notable items, but its meaning and usage is indeterminate. The traditional triquetra (with one arc on top and the other two on the bottom left and right sides) appears on the [[Mora]], as well as on the doors to [[Domain]] entrances.

An upside-down version appears on [[Paimon]]'s clothing and on a few abilities related to [[Tartaglia]], such as [[Havoc: Obliteration]] and the Riptide status inflicted by it. Notably, Tartaglia's triquetra also doubles up as a variant of the Fatui symbol with one knot removed (see the [[#Solomon's knot|Solomon's knot]] section for details).

On rare occasions, double triquetras can be found. Before unlocking the [[Spiral Abyss]] at [[Adventure Rank]] 20, the gateway is sealed by a large upside-down triquetra inlaid with a smaller upright triquetra. [[Kaeya]]'s Talent [[Glacial Heart]] features a large upright triquetra with a smaller inverted triquetra.

==Solomon's knot==
[[File:Domain Entrance.png|thumb|The Solomon's knot over a Domain entrance, with a triquetra on the door]]
Like the triquetra, '''{{w|Solomon's knot}}''' is an ancient symbol that has been used by various cultures across the world and is known by various names. Its common English name derives from the Biblical King Solomon, who was known for his wisdom. It consists of four knots, typically with oval, rectangular, or triangular endings.

Across Teyvat, Solomon's knots can be seen above most Domain entrance doorways, as well as platforms such as [[Rhodeia of Loch]]'s battleground. Several different mechanisms, such as the cubical devices found in certain domains and ruins as well as the [[Lightning Strike Probe]], also feature Solomon's knots.

In Liyue, the bases of the two [[Teleport Waypoints]] in [[Liyue Harbor]] depict Solomon's knots; these bases are unique to those two Waypoints and cannot be found at any other Waypoint. [[Geo Lamp]]s have Solomon's knots along the bulbous end of the lamp, which light up after the lamp is activated. Promotional art for the Liyue Chapter featured the Mora triquetra and square-ended Solomon's knots quite prominently in the background, in a building resembling the [[Golden House]]. However, the in-game Golden House does not depict Solomon's knots.

In Inazuma, [[Lightning Strike Probe]]s depict Solomon's knots.

The [[Fatui]] symbol, while lacking the "knot" aspect due to their symbol being filled in, takes on the general four-sided arcing shape seen in a triangular Solomon's knot.

==Triskelion==
The '''{{w|triskelion}}''' is yet another ancient symbol that is often linked to the triquetra. It is a motif consisting of a triple spiral exhibiting rotational symmetry. In real life, it typically uses either triple spirals or three legs; in Teyvat, only the triple spiral version has been seen thus far.

In Teyvat, the triskelion has most notably been used as a motif within domains, on the wall behind the [[Irminsul]] trees. It can also be found on the orb representing items dropped by enemies, as well as on [[Ruins Torch]] platforms. Looking closely during [[Osial]]'s awakening cutscene in [[Turning Point]] shows a triskelion along its body. The shards of the [[Skyfrost Nail]] and [[Chasm Nail]] also contain a triskelion inside their orbs.

Some ruins use the same swirl motif found in the triskelion, but have six swirls instead of three. This design is notably seen on the doors to the [[Mural Room]] and [[Dragonspine's Last Trio|Secret Room]] in [[Dragonspine]], as well as the door leading downwards into [[Araumi]]'s ruins.

==Four-Pointed Star==
[[File:Item Primogem.png|thumb|140px|Primogems take the shape of a four-pointed star]]
The '''four-pointed star''' (unofficial name), also referred as the '''[[Primogem]] star''' or simply the '''star''', is a recurring {{w|{{Not a Typo|astroid}}}} star that is most commonly associated with Primogems.

This motif is a recurring symbol on characters' clothing. Notably, pure-blooded [[Khaenri'ah]]ns have pupils that take the shape of a four-pointed star.  The shape can be found on [[Albedo]]'s neck between his collarbones. This symbol is also prominently used in association with the [[Traveler]]. The Traveler's Element alignment symbol is based on the four-pointed star and the symbol for Act [[We Will Be Reunited]] features two four-pointed stars, referring to the twin travelers.

This symbol can also be found in various icons, such as those that appear when claiming completed items from [[crafting]], [[forging]], and [[furnishing]] creation. The [[Treasure Hoarders]]' logo also has a four-pointed star surrounded by a ravenwing motif.

==Celestial Motif==
[[File:Statue of the Seven - Dawn Winery - Windblume.png|thumb|A fully-upgraded Statue of The Seven has celestial motifs at the base of the statue and at the top, surrounding the archon statue]]
The '''celestial motif''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a recurring design that typically appears on objects related to [[Celestia]]. It is a semi-circular accent that typically appears in sets of three or five "petals": one large petal in the center, with one or two smaller ones to either side.

This motif has been featured on certain columns on the title screen, on upgraded [[Statues of The Seven]], on the [[Skyfrost Nail]], and on [[Paimon]]'s clothing.

==Domain Seals==
[[File:Domain Seal - Decarabian's Tower.png|thumb|A domain seal in Decarabian's Tower]]
'''Domain seals''' ''(unofficial name)'' are used to seal away domains that are associated with [[gods]] of old. So far, these seals only appear on the ground. They comprise the floor of Decarabian's Tower in [[Stormterror's Lair]], and are used to seal away [[Hidden Palace of Guizang Formula]] at [[Luhua Pool]] (which includes [[Guizhong]]'s domain, the Realm of Clouds) and [[Of Mysteries and Salt|Havria's domain]] in [[Sal Terrae]].

Venti's '''Wind Domain''' created by his [[Elemental Skill]], [[Skyward Sonnet]], uses a simplified version of the ground seal pattern and includes his Anemo elemental symbol. In his [https://youtu.be/TSsWsCdiiPI Character Demo], he is also depicted with the full version.
