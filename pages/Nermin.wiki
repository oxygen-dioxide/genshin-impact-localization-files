:'''Raef:''' Dear, why did you sneak outside again?
:'''Nermin:''' Oh, uh, don't worry! The night's not quite as hot, so it's perfect for getting some fresh air outside.
:'''Raef:''' The night is much cooler than the day, which makes it all the more reason to take better care of your health. Besides, you should stay where there's more greenery...
:'''Nermin:''' Yes, I know, I know. I just need to get out sometimes, you know? Just sometimes.
:'''Nermin:''' Look at you! You're so young, but already sound like my folks.
:'''Raef:''' Wh&mdash;What? ...I mean, anyone who cares about you would say that! ...Ahem, anyway. How's the pot of flowers I gave you?
:'''Nermin:''' Um, yes, thanks for sending me the flowers. They are very beautiful. But the leaves are starting to turn yellow...
:'''Nermin:''' Sorry for not taking good care of them...
:'''Raef:''' N&mdash;No, don't apologize! It's fine, it's not your fault!

:'''Raef:''' But isn't the difference in temperatures between night and day precisely the reason you need to take care of yourself? You've only just recovered... You should spend a bit more time resting...
:'''Nermin:''' Yes, I know, I know. I just need to get out sometimes, you know? Just sometimes.
:'''Nermin:''' And well, look at you! You're still a young man, but you already sound as old as my folks.
