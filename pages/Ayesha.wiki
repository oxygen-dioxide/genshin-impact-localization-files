==Story==
{{Quote|We know more than we can say.|Ayesha|[[Bimarstan's Proverb Column]]}}
Little is known about Ayesha at the moment. They developed a device now known as Ayesha's Chaos Prospector, which is capable of alerting its user when they have discovered ancient relics or ley line distortions.<ref name="JoT">{{Ref/Quest|Journey to Tsurumi}}</ref>

===Legacy===
Before traveling to [[Inazuma]] during ''Shadow of the Ancients'', Hosseini asked some of his fellow researchers in Sumeru to send him Pursina's Spikes and Ayesha's Chaos Prospector. The decision comes in handy after the [[Traveler]] found an anomalous [[Ruin Grader]] on [[Tsurumi Island]] which could repair itself by drawing on the power of the ley lines. With Pursina's Spikes malfunctioning due to the rocky voyage and the vastly different environment in Inazuma, Ayesha's Chaos Prospector was used to search out replacement parts from ancient relics.<ref name="JoT" />
