{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Keon:''' It's my first time hearing your footsteps.
:'''Keon:''' Sorry, but I'm blind, so I can't be of any help to you.
:'''Keon:''' Still, my hearing is very good.
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
::'''Keon:''' Oh, hello.
::'''Keon:''' Travelers, merchants, and adventurers frequent [[Gandharva Ville]]... But your footsteps are more agile than theirs. You must be a lively and lovable youngster.
::'''Keon:''' That's a good thing, and very rare to come by in Sumeru right now.
::'''Keon:''' Young traveler, may [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|the Greater Lord]] watch over you.
::{{DIcon}} Has something happened in Sumeru?
:::'''Keon:''' Not at all, it's peaceful as always.
:::'''Keon:''' It's just me, a blind old man, worrying about nothing.
:::'''Keon:''' The use of [[Akasha]] has been growing in popularity while fewer [[Dusk Bird]]s are flying out of [[Sumeru City]]...
:::'''Keon:''' I can only hope that this is a sign of progress.
::{{DIcon}} About the Greater Lord...
:::'''Keon:''' The Greater Lord may be gone, but the people of Sumeru will never forget the blessings she bestowed upon us.
:::'''Keon:''' Youngster, I'm sure you know that every blade of grass and leaf in this land is a blessing from the Greater Lord.
:::'''Keon:''' *sigh* Human life is too short. Will I be alive to see the [[Lesser Lord Kusanali|Dendro Archon]] bring Sumeru back to its former glory?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Keon:''' Goodbye, may the Greater Lord watch over you.

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
:'''Keon:''' It's my first time hearing your footsteps.
:'''Keon:''' Sorry, but I'm blind, so I can't be of any help to you.
:'''Keon:''' Still, my hearing is very good.
:{{DIcon}} Hello there.
::'''Keon:''' Why, hello, hello!
::'''Keon:''' Travelers, merchants, and adventurers frequent Gandharva Ville... But your footsteps are more agile than theirs. You're a lively and lovable youngster - and no mistake!
::'''Keon:''' That's a good thing, and very rare to come by in Sumeru right now.
::'''Keon:''' Now then, young traveler, may [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] watch over you.
::{{DIcon}} Has something happened in Sumeru?
:::'''Keon:''' Ah, there's a question. Now, I might be a blind old codger, but I've certainly heard things. Lots of things, in fact!
:::'''Keon:''' After the Akasha was shut down, even the number of birds singing in the forests have increased...
:::'''Keon:''' It's at times like these that we need youngsters like you up and about.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me more about Lesser Lord Kusanali.
:::'''Keon:''' Lesser Lord Kusanali has started guiding Sumeru once more, and I believe that things can only get better from here.
:::'''Keon:''' Youngster, I'm sure you know that every blade of grass and leaf in this land is a blessing from the Dendro Archon.
:::'''Keon:''' *sigh* Life is too short... and yet I hope that I shall live long enough to see her deliver us back to glory.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Keon:''' Farewell, and may the Dendro Archon protect you.
