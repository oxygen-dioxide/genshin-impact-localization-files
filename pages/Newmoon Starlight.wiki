'''Newmoon Starlight''' is [[Albedo]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Albedo's hair is pulled back into a half ponytail with braids and it reaches his shoulders. He has softer turquoise eyes and a golden star-shaped marking on his throat, resulting from being synthetically produced via alchemy.

Albedo wears an indigo collared shirt, with a long white coat with a black hood on top for insulation from the cold. There are chains on said coat, connected over his hip and ending at the lower back. He has a sash-like piece of leather with silver designs on it, and black shorts. He also wears embellished thigh-high boots with silver accents, and black gloves till just past the elbows, and a bit of skin peaks out on his arm before his short-sleeved coat covers the rest. He wears his {{Geo}} [[Vision]] right below the collar of his shirt.
