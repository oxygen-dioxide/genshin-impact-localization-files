==Trivia==
*The Japanese sea god {{w|Watatsumi}} is believed to have several daughters, but the most relevant one to Kokomi is perhaps the princess {{Lang|{{w|Oto-hime}}|ja=乙姫|ja_lit=Younger Sister Princess}}, who is said to live in the {{w|Ryūgū-jō|Ryuuguu-jou}} (Dragon Palace Castle), which is often equated with the divine sea realm {{W|Ryukyuan religion#Nirai Kanai|Nirai Kanai}} in the Ryukyuan mythology.
