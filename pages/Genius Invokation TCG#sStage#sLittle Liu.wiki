;(Talk to Little Liu)
:'''Little Liu:''' You look like an adventurer... Do you play cards, too?
:'''Little Liu:''' In that case, let's have a match!
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Let's play Genius Invokation TCG.
:;(Open Genius Invokation TCG challenge interface)
:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to do right now...
::'''Little Liu:''' Alright. I'll go look for someone else to practice with. I'll have to beat everyone if I want to become the best player in the world, anyway!

;(If the player loses the match)
:'''Little Liu:''' Haha! I'm getting closer to my goal! Don't be too discouraged, though.

;(If the player wins the match)
:'''Little Liu:''' That was nothing! You've just been at this longer than I have!
