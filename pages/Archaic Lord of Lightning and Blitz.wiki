==Profile==
He claims to be an [[Adepti|adeptus]] and a master of a martial art called "The Way." This martial art apparently focuses on speed, and for a monthly fee of 7,000 [[Mora]], he offers to teach (or "impart," as he insists on calling it) the art to the [[Traveler]].

While it is possible that he truly is an adeptus, it seems likely that all this is a scam to cheat deluded students out of their Mora. [[Flash-Fist Ling]] claims to be learning "The Way" from him, but has spent tens of thousands of Mora and the only "skill" he demonstrates to the Traveler is supposedly invisible. During the {{Quest|Where the Light Wanes}}, Ling was confident enough in his training to attempt to fight off a tribe of hilichurls using his "technique," and was dumbfounded and terrified that it didn't work. However, following the event, Ling is still found "practicing" next to his master.

===Appearance===
The Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz is an old man in a brown vest over a light gray shirt with dark gray trousers. He wears dark gray slippers and a {{w|Asian conical hat|Dǒulì}} (Asian-style conical hat). A sheathed knife hangs from his right hip, attached to a dark gray belt. He has gray hair and a short, pointed gray beard.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' Of all the martial faculties in the world, speed reigns supreme...
:'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' What is your purpose here, fellow truth seeker? Do you, too, come in search of divine guidance on the Way?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' Hehehe, the truth is I am an Adeptus of the Way living the life of a hermit in this place.
::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' No mortals succeed in entering Jueyun Karst save for those of superior strength and extraordinary spirit...
::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' I am truly overjoyed to witness it. Henceforth, my door is open to you. You shall be my disciple, and I shall impart to you the secrets of the Way.
:{{DIcon}} Divine guidance on the Way?
::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' Precisely! As the saying goes, "That which the sages sought first in vain, they found from the hermit when they sought it again"!
::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' What makes the guidance divine, you ask? All guidance is divine when it comes from an adeptus such as myself! And what is the Way of which I speak? It is a martial art form without peer in all the world.
::{{DIcon}} Sounds like a load of mumbo-jumbo...
:::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' How dare you display such flagrant irreverence towards an Adeptus of the Way!
:::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' So be it! If you insist on squandering your chance to learn the secrets of the Way from me, go and spend the rest of your life regretting it!
::{{DIcon}} What do d'you teach here then?
:::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' So I teach&mdash; No! The Way of the Adeptus cannot be conversed about with such nonchalance!
:::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' I am not in the business of "teaching," but "imparting," and I am quite insistent about that.
:::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' If you must know &mdash; for a fee of seven thousand Mora per month, I will impart to you the secrets of harnessing your martial faculties. Your feet and your fists shall fly with the force of a comet and the ease of a butterfly!
:{{DIcon}} ...Bye.
::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' Farewell! You are most welcome to visit me again.
::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' There is a saying that goes, "Even a champion is defenseless against a frenzy of fists; even a master may be slain by a stray roof tile..." Remember it well, my child!

==Trivia==
* In {{w|Taoism}}, the "Way" (Tao/Dao) is the unplanned rhythms of the universe. A common belief about the Tao is that it is indescribable and that there is no way to "teach" it.
* His Chinese name ends in {{zh|真君|rm=zhēnjūn}} like the names of other adepti.
