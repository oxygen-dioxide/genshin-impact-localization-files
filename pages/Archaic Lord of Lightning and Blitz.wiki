==Profile==
He claims to be an [[Adepti|adeptus]] and a master of a martial art called "The Way." This martial art apparently focuses on speed, and for a monthly fee of 7,000 [[Mora]], he offers to teach (or "impart," as he insists on calling it) the art to the Traveler.

While it is possible that he truly is an adeptus, it seems likely that all this is a scam to cheat deluded students out of their Mora. [[Flash-Fist Ling]] claims to be learning "The Way" from him. It is possible, though highly unlikely, that he may be in on the scam, since he was confident enough in his training to attempt to fight off a tribe of hilichurls using his 'technique' during a brief appearance in an event, and was dumbfounded and terrified that it didn't work.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' Of all the martial faculties in the world, speed reigns supreme...
:'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' What is your purpose here, fellow truth seeker? Do you, too, come in search of divine guidance on the Way?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' Hehehe, the truth is I am an Adeptus of the Way living the life of a hermit in this place.
::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' No mortals succeed in entering Jueyun Karst save for those of superior strength and extraordinary spirit...
::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' I am truly overjoyed to witness it. Henceforth, my door is open to you. You shall be my disciple, and I shall impart to you the secrets of the Way.
:{{DIcon}} Divine guidance on the Way?
::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' Precisely! As the saying goes, "That which the sages sought first in vain, they found from the hermit when they sought it again"!
::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' What makes the guidance divine, you ask? All guidance is divine when it comes from an adeptus such as myself! And what is the Way of which I speak? It is a martial art form without peer in all the world.
::{{DIcon}} Sounds like a load of mumbo-jumbo...
:::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' How dare you display such flagrant irreverence towards an Adeptus of the Way!
:::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' So be it! If you insist on squandering your chance to learn the secrets of the Way from me, go and spend the rest of your life regretting it!
::{{DIcon}} What do d'you teach here then?
:::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' So I teach&mdash; No! The Way of the Adeptus cannot be conversed about with such nonchalance!
:::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' I am not in the business of "teaching," but "imparting," and I am quite insistent about that.
:::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' If you must know &mdash; for a fee of seven thousand Mora per month, I will impart to you the secrets of harnessing your martial faculties. Your feet and your fists shall fly with the force of a comet and the ease of a butterfly!
:{{DIcon}} ...Bye.
::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' Farewell! You are most welcome to visit me again.
::'''Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz:''' There is a saying that goes, "Even a champion is defenseless against a frenzy of fists; even a master may be slain by a stray roof tile..." Remember it well, my child!

==Trivia==
* In {{w|Taoism}}, the "Way" (Tao/Dao) is the unplanned rhythms of the universe. A common belief about the Tao is that it is indescribable and that there is no way to "teach" it.
* His Chinese name ends in {{zh|真君|rm=zhēnjūn}} like the names of other adepti.
