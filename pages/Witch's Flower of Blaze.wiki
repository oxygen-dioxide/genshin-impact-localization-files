{{Description|A flower touched by the witch who once dreamt of burning away all the demons in the world. The anonymous flames affectionately caress the hands of those who touch it.}}
'''Witch's Flower of Blaze''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Crimson Witch of Flames]].

==Description==
A common species of flower.<br />It is curiously capable of resisting the Crimson Witch's flames.

A [[cataclysm|crisis]] centuries ago dashed all hope of the maiden seeing the future promised to her.<br />Those dear to her, her past days, and her bright future. All gone.

From the ashes, the [[Signora|Crimson Witch of Flame]] was born, and she burned away her pain with fire.<br />Yet this flower stayed resilient, soft, and moist.<br />Perhaps both painful and beautiful memories were two sides of the same coin.
