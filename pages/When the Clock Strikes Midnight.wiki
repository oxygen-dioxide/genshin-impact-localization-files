'''''When the Clock Strikes Midnight''''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Wonders of the World]]''. To complete this achievement, the player must complete step 3 of the {{Quest|An Eye for an Eye}}.

==Trivia==
*The name of the achievement is a reference to the fairytale ''{{w|Cinderella}}'', wherein the main character is warned that the magic which transformed her into a princess would wear off and she would return to her real self upon the clock striking midnight. In this case it alludes to witnessing [[Caterpillar]] casting off his human "disguise".
