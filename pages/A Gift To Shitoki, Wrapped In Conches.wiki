==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Collect one of the conches)
:'''Shitoki:''' It's not enough... Not enough at all...
:'''Shitoki:''' The treasure that Brother left me is in those conches...
:'''Shitoki:''' But they've been scattered, aye, they've been scattered all over...
:'''Shitoki:''' It's Brother's treasure. I can't leave yet, no, no...
:{{DIcon}} Treasure...?
:{{DIcon}} What's this I heard about a brother...
:'''Shitoki:''' He went out into the Sea of Fog, and that made the priest really angry. The priest said that my older brother's spirit would never be able to return...
:'''Shitoki:''' But Brother said that "there are lovely flowers there and seas with pearls. Father rows a boat there, and he and our little sister wave to us..."
:'''Shitoki:''' He left his treasure behind when he went out to sea, and he never returned.

;(Talk to Shitoki before collecting all treasure map fragments)
:'''Shitoki:''' No, no, I cannot leave. Not before I find his treasure...

;(Talk to Shitoki after collecting all treasure map fragments)
:'''Shitoki:''' Ah, I see, I see. So that's where the treasure was! Thank you so much.
:'''Shitoki:''' Though we won't be able to go to the land of dreams together, I'm sure I'll be able to turn into motes of light and return to look for you...
:'''Shitoki:''' Do strange spirits wandering in a strange land also dream, I wonder?

;(Reading the note near the precious chest)
:'''Big Brother's "Letter":''' This note is roughly made from animal hide. Upon it, two smiling people are drawn, hand-in-hand.
:'''Big Brother's "Letter":''' The blue skies are unclouded by fog. There is only a radiant boat. "Father" and "Sister" sit on the boat, waving happily toward the shore.
