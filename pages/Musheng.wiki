==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Musheng:''' Are you an outlander? Would you like to burn an incense stick?
:{{DIcon}} About Rex Lapis' death...
:;(After completing [[Rite of Descension]])
::'''Musheng:''' How could a divinity<!--in-game typo--> like Rex Lapis die? Even though I witnessed it myself, I can't believe it.
::'''Musheng:''' He must've just moved back to [[Celestia]]. I mean, many of his old adepti pals are still there, right?
::'''Musheng:''' As for Liyue, I'm sure he's made thorough arrangements... Why, you ask?
::'''Musheng:''' Well, I've lived in my hometown for several decades now, and I sure did miss home a few times while I was here for the Rite...
::'''Musheng:''' Rex Lapis has been with us for thousands of years... I'm sure he'll miss us, too.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Musheng:''' I live in the countryside. I visit the city once a year at this time to burn incense as an offering to the Geo Lord.
::'''Musheng:''' Everyone in Liyue is into things that bring good luck. I'm no different.
::'''Musheng:''' Were it not for the Geo Lord's power, Liyue would not be as prosperous as it is today. That is why I come here every year to pay my respects at this temple, no matter how long the journey is and no matter what other pressing business there is to attend to.
::'''Musheng:''' As the saying goes, "None shall learn what the immortals have in store for them until he first does that which is within his power as a mortal."
::{{DIcon}} About Rex Lapis' protection...
::'''Musheng:''' Huh. Judging from your tone, you're not a believer, are you?
::'''Musheng:''' Well, just a short while back, I was set upon by bandits on the road to Liyue Harbor. It was only by the intervention of a young hero named "Xingqiu of the Guhua Clan" that I was saved.
::'''Musheng:''' This must have been the protection of Rex Lapis! He must have known that I was coming to offer incense, and thus stepped in to rescue me!
::'''Musheng:''' Were it not for Rex Lapis' divine arrangement, how could a long-lost Clan like Guhua suddenly return out of nowhere?
::'''Musheng:''' However you want to put it, I thank Rex Lapis. I shall also offer incense on behalf of that young hero of the Guhua Clan. I will pay for his fortune and safety, as repayment for his deeds.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Musheng:''' I will stay around in the city for a bit longer. It will be much more effective if I let the scent of incense permeate every inch of me...

==Event Dialogue==
===Lantern Rite===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Musheng:''' I'm Musheng, I come from out in the country. There's definitely more of a festive atmosphere in the city.
:'''Musheng:''' The heroes that we remember during Lantern Rite are actually adepti who lived in Liyue in the distant past.
:'''Musheng:''' That was a time when the adepti lived among the normal people. I don't know why we never see any adepti nowadays...
:'''Musheng:''' I can't help but think it's a bad omen... Ah, what am I saying? I shouldn't jinx the festival, should I? Haha.
{{Dialogue end}}
===Moonlight Merriment===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Musheng:''' Haha! It was the right call to come here during the festival. You just can't beat the festive cheer here in the city!
:'''Musheng:''' I've heard that the Moonchase Festival used to be celebrated for very different reasons in the past. Something about the adepti's rituals, I believe.
:'''Musheng:''' But I don't think that what it's about now &mdash; gathering together and admiring the moon &mdash; is half bad, either!
:'''Musheng:''' I'm sure that the adepti, too, would be gladdened to see everyone enjoying themselves.
