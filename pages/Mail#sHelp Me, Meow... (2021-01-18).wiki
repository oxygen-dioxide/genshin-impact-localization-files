|text    = For the past two days, I've been roaming far westward along the main road in search of new ingredients to make the worst-tasting cocktail ever. I found a small animal known as a [[Golden Loach]] that drops some very pretty pearls.

I ground those into powder, added dollops of it to wine... and then I gave it out to passers-by.

They loved it... and they even wanted me to stay and make them some more.

Ugh, it was a failure! I mean, of course, it was a failure!

Why is it always good wine... and why did I have to spend my birthday like that, meow...

I wanna go home... I want you to pat my head and scratch my ears...

W--wait, no! That's not it at all! I just need you to bring me back, that's all.

You... you don't have to bring any presents or anything.

Just... please come, and soon...
