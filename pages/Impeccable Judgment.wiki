==Trivia==
* The Chinese, Japanese, and Korean names of this achievement allude to {{Lang|mini=1|ja=正法眼蔵|ja_rm=shoubougenzou|ja_lit=Treasury of the True Dharma Eye}}, a term in Buddhism. In Zen Buddhism specifically, it refers to the realization of Buddha's awakening that is not contained in the written words of the sutras, and therefore the ability to see the truth beneath the surface.
