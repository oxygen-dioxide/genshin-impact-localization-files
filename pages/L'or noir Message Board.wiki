:'''Someone's Message:''' "Excuse me, does anyone know if there's a way to restore one's rights as a citizen in Fontaine?"
:'''Vitruvia:''' "As far as I know, no such cases currently exist."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Even if there was a way, it'd never happen to you, Colin. Why don't you take an honest look at what you did? That "boiler" prototype of yours razed the entire [[Fontaine Research Institute|lab]]."
:'''Someone's Message:''' "It's not my fault! They must have mucked up operating it. My calculations couldn't have been wrong, it can't be my fault!"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Tell it to the [[Oratrice]], why don't you."

===About Colin===
:'''L'or noir:''' Missing: Colin
:'''L'or noir:''' A former researcher at the Fontaine Research Institute, an expert in the field of thermal energy. Strong body, weak and timid personality.
:'''L'or noir:''' The individual has been missing for over a month, and has accrued a tab in the tens of thousands of Mora at the L'or noir. If anyone can provide useful information, please contact Tetreaux. We are most grateful for any information.
:'''Message:''' I bet old Colin had the underpants scammed off of him. If you ask me, he's long gone.

===About Jaime the Brute===
:'''Message:''' "The Fleuve Cendre really is scary. I feel like there's shady characters everywhere."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Relax, with the Spina di Rosula here, nobody will cause too much trouble."
:'''Message:''' Really? But I saw a huge dude dressed up like an Eremite today, once glance is enough to know he means business.
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "You mean Jaime the Brute, right? That's normal, his job is collecting on debts, so of course he's gotta look tough."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "He's got quite the temper though, so I'd recommend you keep your distance. He's beaten people for just looking at him twice. That's why he's called the Brute."
:'''A Third Person's Message:''' "Not necessarily. Today I saw old lady [[Bracari]] bump into his shoulder and he apologized to her on the spot with perfect etiquette."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "The Brute knows how to apologize? And to an old granny? Did you drink the wrong potion?"
:'''A Third Person's Message:''' "Not just that, you didn't see his totally obsequious way of doing it. Just like old Colin, shrinking away like a scared finch."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Haha, definitely a pity I didn't see that!"

===About Faustier===
:'''Immature Handwriting:''' "[[Faustier]] is totally ripped! How hard do I have to work to be as strong as he is?"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Don't assume he was always so buff. He used to be skinny as a rail. He only became this muscular after he got sent to the [[Fortress of Meropide]]."
:'''Immature Handwriting:''' "Wow! Then I want to go to the Fortress of Meropide too!"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Now that's easy, all you have to do is..."
:'''Faustier:''' "Don't listen to their baloney! All you have to do is eat well, get lots of exercise, and you'll be as strong as I am!"

===About an Outsider===
:'''Message:''' "I saw a lame local taking an outsider around here yesterday, they were talking about 'science' and 'medicine' while they were walking, what was going on?"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "I've also heard them say something like 'the more important the research, the more you need to do it in hidden, out-of-the-way places like this.' They're not planning on selling Sinthe, are they?"
:'''Message from Tetreaux:'''"It would be best if you two would explain this situation in detail. The Boss wants to talk to them."

===About Salvaging===
:'''Message:''' "I've heard salvaging is really profitable! I wonder if someone like me can strike it rich too."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "You might earn no more from salvaging than fishing. As for getting rich, get real."
:'''Message:''' "I've already asked around! That [[Crossa]] sells stuff that other people have salvaged! And that you can tell the stuff she sells is premium!"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Oh, I get it. That's the kind of 'salvage' you're talking about. No wonder."
:'''Message:''' "Wait, what do you mean that kind of 'salvage'?"
