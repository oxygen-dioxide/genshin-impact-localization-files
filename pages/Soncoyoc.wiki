==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Soncoyoc:''' Price cut, price cut! Once they're gone, I'm gone! It's now or never, so don't miss out!
:{{DIcon}} What could you be selling in a place like this?
:'''Soncoyoc:''' Why so many questions? Oh, you're new around here, aren't you? In that case, I don't think you need what I'm selling right now. When the time comes that you do, you'll know what I mean.
;(After Completing  {{Quest|The Case of the Crafting Bench}})
:{{DIcon|Reward}} I heard I could get my hands on some special potions here...
::'''Soncoyoc:''' Pretty well-informed, aren't you? Go on then, tell me what you need.
::{{DIcon}} I'd like one of those potions that almost killed [[Sumac]].
::'''Soncoyoc:''' ...Sumac? Oh, I remember now. But wait a sec... What do you mean she almost died? And what does it have to do with my potions?
::'''Soncoyoc:''' You're not trying to extort me, are you? I've sold so many potions now I've lost count, yet in all this time, I've never had anyone make complaints or kick up trouble before &mdash; only repeat customers!
::{{DIcon}} You sure it's not because the ones who would've done so all ended up having little "accidents"?
::'''Soncoyoc:''' Huh, are you seriously challenging me? My reputation means everything! I'll even give you the potion formula for free. You find anything fishy about it &mdash; anything at all &mdash; just come find me.
::{{DIcon}} And... how would I do that if something had already happened to me?
::'''Soncoyoc:''' I'm offering you the formula for free, and you want me to cough up Mora too? You sure know how to play the game, huh?
::;(Obtain {{Item|Recipe: Strength Tonic|20|x=1}})
:{{DIcon}} So you do business here?
::'''Soncoyoc:''' It's not like I'm in anyone's way, is it? Besides, selling's never a problem for someone with as solid a reputation as mine.
::'''Soncoyoc:''' Not gonna lie though. Working the graveyard shift day after day is tough stuff. One of these days, I'll get a message to [[Hawka]] asking him to send someone else to replace me.
:{{DIcon}} So the things you sell here are all completely legit, yeah?
::'''Soncoyoc:''' Yes, and why wouldn't they be? I sell invigorating potions for people and delicious [[Saurus Crackers|Saurus crackers]] for [[Saurian]]s &mdash; all one hundred and ten percent above board.
::'''Soncoyoc:''' Aside from these finished products, I also sell alchemical materials. We've got everything from [[Butterfly Wings]] to [[Loach Pearl]]s, so whatever you need, just ask &mdash; there's nothing we can't get our hands on.
::'''Soncoyoc:''' Oh, except, if you're into the same kind of stuff as [[Ixtelo]], I don't wanna hear about it.
::'''Soncoyoc:''' Though we might seem shady ourselves, that guy's "gem" dealings... well, even we won't turn a blind eye there.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye
::'''Soncoyoc:''' Take care.
