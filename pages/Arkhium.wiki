'''Arkhium''' is a "yellow-green" crystal that can be mined in places such as the [[Geode Mine Shaft]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|An Eye for an Eye}}</ref> Some say that Arkhium can bring disaster and misfortune if one gets too close to it.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Scenes from Life in Meropide: Treat the Symptoms}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/NPC|Lechlade}}</ref>

Arkhium can be used as an energy source and can power machines that can lift heavy items.<ref>[[Aquabus]] &mdash; Clementine Line, [[Aeval]]: [[Aquabus#Clementine Line I3: About Arkhium|I3: About Arkhium]]<br>'''''Aeval:''' [...] an engineer riding on the aquabus once mentioned a mysterious kind of Arkhium, which can be used to lift up even bigger and heavier things!''</ref> The [[Experimental Field Generator]] created by [[Edwin Eastinghouse]] is also powered by an Arkhium Kinetic Core.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Raimondo}}</ref>

Arkhium has been described as having "immense energetic potential" and the "power to shatter the shackles of the earth," while being considered "the key to the gate of salvation."<ref>{{Ref/Item|"Tourbillon Device"}}</ref>

Edwin specialized in researching Arkhium and gravimeters.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Secret Keepers and Forbidden Zones}}</ref> A massive explosion caused by Arkhium caused the destruction of much of the [[Fontaine Research Institute]], while also leaving behind suspended remnants of water known as [[Allogravity-Condensed Water Bodies]] floating midair.<ref name="VCR">{{Ref/Quest|Vibro-Crystal Reharmonization}}</ref>
