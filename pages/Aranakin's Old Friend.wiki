{{Quest Description|After that last adventure, Aranakin really forgot a lot of things. No matter what, how could the new and old friends he made be forgotten so easily?}}
{{Dialogue start}}

;(Upon approaching island)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, you hear that? Someone's singing.
:'''Paimon:''' That's definitely Aranakin's song!
:'''Paimon:''' Ha, it really is Aranakin! Let's say hi to him!

;(Upon getting closer to Aranakin)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, he's gone... But Paimon understands, he's forgotten our adventures together, after all.
:{{DIcon}} Don't lose heart now.
:{{DIcon}} We can be friends all over again.
:'''Paimon:''' Yes, you're right... Oh, Paimon has an idea!
:'''Paimon:''' Aranakin taught us a song, right? Let's play it, and maybe he would recognize it!
:{{DIcon}} That's a valid idea.
::'''Paimon:''' Hee-hee, because Paimon is Paimon!
:{{DIcon}} That's finally some helpful advice...
::'''Paimon:''' Hey! Stop being so mean to Paimon!

;(Play Aranakin's song)
:;(If played incorrectly)
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm... We must have played something wrong! Let's try again.
:;(If played incorrectly again){{Verify|need to confirm this line occurs in this instance}}
::'''Paimon:''' Huh... Still not working? Let's try again!
:'''Paimon:''' Haha, here he comes! Hello, little thing!
:'''Aranakin:''' Aranakin is not a little thing! You are! You floaty white little thing!
:'''Aranakin:''' Speaking of which, golden sand... Nara, why do you know this song?
:'''Paimon:''' Well...
:{{DIcon}} You taught us.
::'''Paimon:''' Yes, during our last adventure, you taught the song to us!
:{{DIcon}} I played this song, so that I could meet you.
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, how did (Traveler) do? See? We still remember the melody you taught us!
:'''Aranakin:''' Is that... so? Hmph, Aranakin is not clever, but you don't look like those bad sand grains.
:'''Paimon:''' No, we don't! You told us that sand is Valuka. So the bad sand grains are a group of bad Nara Valuka, right? But we are good Nara!
:'''Aranakin:''' Ohh? Did I tell you that as well?
:'''Paimon:''' Haha, that's right! (Traveler), let's tell the stories to him again!

:'''You recount the adventures to Aranakin, as well as how you neutralized The Withering together.'''

:'''Aranakin:''' ...I see.
:'''Aranakin:''' Aranakin is not clever, but what you said, sounds to be true. Aranakin can't remember, sorry.
:'''Paimon:''' No, no need for that! Y'know, it's pretty normal to forget things... Besides, we can become friends again, right?
:{{DIcon}} Aranakin is a good kid.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon is a good kid.
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, that's for sure!
:'''Aranakin:''' Ah... Since we're good friends, follow me then!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh? But...
:'''Aranakin:''' Golden Nara and White Floaty! Come to my place, follow me!

;(Follow Aranakin)
:'''Aranakin:''' Hee-hee, there it is.
:'''Aranakin:''' That huge tree is the place where I live. But I wasn't the first to live there, nor was it other Aranara.
:'''Aranakin:''' The tree was once a Nara's home. Aranakin probably knew him, might helped, or been helped by him...
:'''Aranakin:''' But Aranakin can't remember, just like Aranakin can't remember you.
:'''Aranakin:''' Right, Nara's instrument... I still keep it. I think I taught my song to him as well, but he didn't come back like you did.
:'''Aranakin:''' He will be back one day, right? Just like you, even if I can't remember his name...

;(Entering Aranakin's home)
:'''Aranakin:''' We're here! Here it is!
:'''Aranakin:''' This is my place, please rest here!

;(Examine instrument)
:'''Aranakin:''' This is Nara instrument, Aranakin is keeping it. But it can't sing now... The strings are not in the right place.
:'''Old Oud:''' (An antiquated oud, marked with multiple breaking scars, but seeming to be carefully-repaired and well-maintained.)

;(Examine leaves)
:'''Aranakin:''' Nara... Hm, what's the name? Aranakin doesn't sleep with that, so forget the word...
:'''Paimon:''' It's a "bed"! It looks pretty new, indeed... Did someone sleep on it before?
:'''Aranakin:''' Hehe, Aranakin keeps tidying it... If you want to sleep here, that's okay!

;(Talk to Aranakin)
:'''Aranakin:''' There are leaves Nara left upstairs, but... Aranakin can't read them, Aranakin doesn't understand...
:'''Aranakin:''' Those are the leaves Nara use to keep memories... Nara write on the leaves, and put them together. But the words of Nara, Aranakin doesn't understand.
:'''Paimon:''' Do you mean... "notebook"?
:'''Aranakin:''' "Notebook"...? That's how Nara keep their memories?
:'''Paimon:''' Yup, that's right... Will Aranakin mind if we go upstairs together, and see what it says?
:'''Aranakin:''' Me? Not at all!

;(Talk to Aranakin again)
:'''Aranakin:''' Let me know if you find anything interesting!

;(Interact with the Battered Notebook)
:'''Battered Notebook:''' "...I've repaired the oud Uncle [[Bakr]] dropped, so stop crying by yourself, alright? You can talk to Khayyam and me if you're unhappy..."
:'''Battered Notebook:''' "...I've been accepted into the Akademiya! Haha, congratulations to me! I don't want to be some warriors wife! I'm going to be [[Siman Farrokhzad|Siman]], the Great Sage!"
:'''Battered Notebook:''' "Hehe... [[Irfan]] the 'Great musician' and [[Khayyam]] 'the Wise!' Don't forget me! Especially you, Khayyam! Don't you dare forget me!"
:'''Battered Notebook:''' "...Farewell, notebook! Farewell, Irfan and Siman, my best friends! I hope that the forest never forgets our story, and I hope we remember each other..."
:'''Battered Notebook:''' (...The rest is a mess and filled with the children's happy and sorrowful memories...)
:'''Battered Notebook:''' "...Aranakin is gone. Vanished into thin air, and without so much as a sign as to when. It's time for me to bid farewell to the oud too. I'll be a craftsman, just like my father had hoped I would..."
:'''Battered Notebook:''' (There seems to be more, but it's been crossed and blacked out with ink.)
:'''Battered Notebook:''' "...To the person reading this notebook, if I by some miracle am allowed to meet Aranakin and the others again, years from now, then please give this flower to him..."
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, something fell out of the notebook!
:'''Paimon:''' It looks like... a flower? It looks... exactly like the ones we got.
;(Obtain [[Little Dried Flower]])

;(Talk to Aranakin)
:'''Aranakin:''' What memories is it keeping? What did you see?
:{{DIcon}} It seems that the owner of the notebook knows you.
:'''Aranakin:''' Is that so...? I can't remember...
:'''Paimon:''' He said... He couldn't see you anymore. Because he grew up, maybe...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Growing up is really troubling.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh right! He also said in the notebook that... This flower is for you!
:{{DIcon}} Here.
:'''Aranakin:''' Huh...? Ahh! This flower is very important! Why do you... how did he get it?
:'''Paimon:''' Actually, you once gave us the same flower as well... It's just that you forgot everything.
:'''Aranakin:''' Really...? I can still make friends with you again. But... As for him, I can't even recall his face...
:'''Paimon:''' I&mdash;It's okay... Don't be sad, we still have this flower. It will bring you more memories, right?
:'''Aranakin:''' Yes, White Floaty is right.
:'''Aranakin:''' I am taking this flower back, Mawtiyima should know how to wake her up.
:'''Aranakin:''' Hmm... Nara (Traveler) and White Floaty, I am going back to where Aranaga is, planting her, and listening to her songs. If you are not busy, you know where to find us!
:'''Paimon:''' Yes, see you soon!
