:{{A|vo shlq004 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ningguang's little secretary! We've found all the materials!
:{{A|vo shlq004 1 baiwen 01.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' Oh? Already?
:{{A|vo shlq004 1 baiwen 02.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' All three of you found them together? Okay, I see.
:{{A|vo shlq004 1 baiwen 03.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' The Wonder Cores and Adepti Sigils look good. It seems that we've found our winners.

:'''Baiwen calls for the participants to gather...'''

:{{A|vo shlq004 1 baiwen 04.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' I hereby announce that the winners of this material procurement contest are (Traveler), [[Yun Jin]], and [[Beidou]]!
:{{A|vo shlq004 1 hongfei 01.ogg}} '''Hongfei:''' What? It's over already? I haven't even found the Plaustrite yet!
:{{A|vo shlq004 1 changgui 01.ogg}} '''Changgui:''' I can't believe it...
:{{A|vo shlq004 1 zhicheng 01.ogg}} '''Zhicheng:''' *sigh* So close, but so far...
:{{A|vo shlq004 1 baiwen 05.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' I'd like to invite our three winners to please proceed to the Jade Chamber, where Lady [[Ningguang]] is waiting for you.
:{{A|vo shlq004 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Where's Beidou? She was right here.
:{{A|vo shlq004 1 baiwen 06.ogg}} '''Baiwen:''' Captain Beidou has some business to attend to. She will join later. Please come with me for now.
:{{A|vo shlq004 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright then, guess we'll head on up to the Jade Chamber first.
:{{A|vo shlq004 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This has been a long time coming! The last time we went up to the Jade Chamber was aaaages ago!

;(Talk to Baiwen if quest is interrupted)

{{Quest Description|update|You head to the Jade Chamber at Ningguang's secretary's instruction. The lady herself seems to have been expecting you.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach Ningguang)
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 01.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Combine the Adepti Sigils with the Wonder Cores and insert them into the Jade Chamber's control compartment.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 02.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' The construction of the new Jade Chamber is now officially complete. Once the tethers are released, it will soar into the sky.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 03.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Thank you all for your work. Now it is time for me to fulfill my promise.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah!
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 04.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Ms. Yun, I've already heard something about the reason for your involvement. You are looking for a venue for your new opera, aren't you?
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 yunjin 01.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' That's right. Lady Ningguang, I would like to hear your opinion.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 05.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' The unveiling of Ms. Yun's grand new opera surely requires a venue of equal grandeur. So what would you say if I proposed that we stage your first performance right here, in the newly built Jade Chamber?
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 06.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' The Jade Chamber offers a splendid panoramic view of the mountains and the bustling city. It is fitting for the finest performance to be hosted in the heavens... I can think of no better stage for you than here, Ms. Yun.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 yunjin 02.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Thank you, Lady Ningguang. Then I will prepare my props and other articles shortly. Please allow me to bring all these aboard the Jade Chamber.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 07.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' You're quite welcome. It's truly what a good opera deserves.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 yunjin 03.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' (Traveler), Shenhe, Paimon, I'll be leaving now. Do come and see my play when the time comes.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 08.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' You're next, (Traveler). What is your question?
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 09a.ogg}} {{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 09b.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I should clarify. I do not know your (sister/brother)'s whereabouts. So please, don't waste your question on this matter.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow... You're a mind-reader, Ningguang! Oh well, guess Paimon will ask a question then!
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 10.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' ...Managing a successful business is not as simple as you might think. Capital, connections, sensitivity to the trends, an instinct for what is a good opportunity... All of these traits are crucial.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 11.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' If you want to know how to make money, I will honor our agreement and give you an answer. But that is not to say that it will work for you.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow! Paimon hadn't even asked the question yet!
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 12.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Your question was written all over your face. Now look, you've helped me rebuild the Jade Chamber, and I intend to repay you handsomely for it.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 13.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' So I promise you that should you one day require financial assistance, you may seek employment here. I will pay you at the highest rate of remuneration.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! So next time we run out of Mora, we just need to come to Ningguang!
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No more questions from us. [[Shenhe]], you got a question?
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 shenhe 01.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Me?
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yes! This was a group effort!
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 shenhe 02.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Thank you... But I don’t have anything to ask.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 14.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Are you sure? This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I'd urge you not to squander it.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, just don't waste it! Hold on a second, Paimon can probably think of another one...
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 shenhe 03.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Lady Ningguang... do you think I can ever fit in in Liyue Harbor?
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 15.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Now that is an interesting question.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 16.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Liyue Harbor is very inclusive. As long as you respect the rules here, you will not be turned away.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 17.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' So the key is whether or not you yourself can develop a sense of belonging in Liyue Harbor.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 shenhe 04.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' A sense of belonging?
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 18.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Yes. To become fond of a place, to feel part of it... it always requires a reason.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 19.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Perhaps someone you've met or something you've experienced here. Or perhaps you enjoy the atmosphere of Liyue and you will become accustomed to it.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 20.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' In short, everyone needs a reason to stay. I hope you can find yours soon.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 shenhe 05.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' ...I see.
;(Beidou arrives)
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 beidou 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Hey, what's going on? I just went to see the fleet, I'm a little later than expected.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Come on, Beidou, it's your turn! Do you have a question for Ningguang?
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 beidou 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Me? Nah, I ain't got any questions. She forced me to help out, so I figured I may as well get involved with the contest.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 beidou 03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Ningguang, don't forget what we talked about.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 beidou 04.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' It's not gonna be easy to deal with. I don't think my fleet can take it on their own.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 21.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Don't worry, I have made preparations. The wound dressings are ready and the [[Millelith]] have set up an ambush.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 beidou 05.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Glad to hear it. Watch your back. Stay alert!
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Beidou, Ningguang, what are you talking about?
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 22.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' You'll see when the Jade Chamber ascends. However... it's not the most pleasant topic of conversation. Maybe it's better that you don't know.
;(Beidou walks off)

:'''Ningguang begins to prepare for lift-off...'''

:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 23.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' When I first set foot in the Jade Chamber, I stood at the edge of the platform and looked down upon Liyue Harbor far below.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 24.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' At that time, I dreamed that one day the Jade Chamber's shadow would be seen in all seven nations of [[Teyvat]].
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 25.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' My wish has not changed to this very day. However, it is not only out of consideration for myself that I have built the Jade Chamber anew at this time.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 26.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I hope the Jade Chamber will always float in the skies above Liyue Harbor, bearing witness to the prosperity and peace of the human world...
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 27.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' ...and I hope that you can all witness it with me.
:{{A|vo shlq004 2 ningguang 28.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Let the ascension ceremony commence!

;(A cinematic plays)
{{Cutscene Description|The Jade Chamber rises slowly into the sky before your eyes. But it is also at that moment that you notice a raging storm forming above the ocean surface in the distance. From beneath it emerges a colossal monster. According to Ningguang, the monster is Osial's wife - Beisht, the one who roams the oceans. Keqing and Beidou, who have been waiting, pounce on the opportunity and lead people to attack it. Wounded and thus angered, the monster summons a tsunami. Alarmed at the ominous turn of events, you draw your sword and charge toward Beisht - but then are knocked out by it. The looming danger reminds Shenhe of what happened to her  in her childhood. To protect you and everyone else there, she charges resolutely towards Beisht.}}
:;(The iron tethers are released and the Jade Chamber floats into the skies)
:;(As the Jade Chamber takes off, storms gather and a monster rises from a vortex in the sea)
::'''Ningguang:''' Right on cue

::'''Ningguang:''' Osial's wife
::'''Ningguang:''' Final follower of the [[Overlord of the Vortex]]
::'''Paimon:''' Sounds like you knew this was coming...
::'''Ningguang:''' Beidou sensed something was stirring in the deep
::'''Ningguang:''' She warned me months ago
::'''Ningguang:''' Knowing she harbors hatred towards the Jade Chamber
::'''Ningguang:''' I chose to rebuild it now
::'''Ningguang:''' As a way of drawing her out
::'''Paimon:''' Got it
::'''Paimon:''' Well, let's go fetch the adepti!
::'''Ningguang:''' No
::'''Ningguang:''' In this human age
::'''Ningguang:''' The people of Liyue
::'''Ningguang:''' Must find a way
::'''Ningguang:''' To overcome this crisis
::'''Ningguang:''' On our strength alone!
:;(The Jade Chamber launches projectiles at Beisht, followed by attacks from Guizhong Ballistas in Guyun Stone Forest commanded by Keqing and on The Alcor commanded by Beidou)
:;(Beisht roars and creates a giant tsunami)
::'''Beidou:''' All hands
::'''Beidou:''' Tsunami incoming!
:;(The Alcor immediately turns around)
::'''Millelith Sergeant:''' What's that!?
::'''Millelith Soldier:''' Wave... A giant wave!
:;(The Traveler jumps off the Jade Chamber and attacks Beisht with a [[Dull Blade]])
:;(Beisht emits a beam which sends the Traveler crashing into a mountain)
:;(Shenhe catches the Traveler as they fall and lays them down onto the ground)
:;(Shenhe looks at the Traveler struggling and gets a flashback)
:::'''Shenhe's Father:''' You are a cursed child...
:::'''Shenhe's Father:''' Your life
:::'''Shenhe's Father:''' Brings nothing but disaster to us all
:::'''Shenhe's Father:''' At least if you die
:::'''Shenhe's Father:''' I can bring her back
:::'''Cloud Retainer:''' The day you learn
:::'''Cloud Retainer:''' How to use your strength for the good of others
:::'''Cloud Retainer:''' Is the day
:::'''Cloud Retainer:''' That you can truly become part of human society

:{{A|vo shlq004 3 shenhe 02.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I hardly see this as a great risk. The people of Liyue Harbor are well-prepared and she is already badly injured. Only sheer willpower is keeping her alive.

:{{A|vo shlq004 4 shenhe 05.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' It's been dealt with. She was injured before entering the water. It didn't take too much effort to finish the job.

:{{A|vo shlq004 4 zhengmao 02.ogg}} '''Zhengmao:''' Thanks to the medical supplies you prepared and Lady [[Keqing]]'s command, our losses were minimal.

:{{A|vo shlq004 4 ningguang 04.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Let the soldiers recuperate. But don't let your guard down &mdash; if she returns with a vengeance, we must be prepared.
:{{A|vo shlq004 4 zhengmao 05.ogg}} '''Zhengmao:''' Yes, Ma'am!
:{{A|vo shlq004 4 ningguang 05.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' You've been monitoring us for some time now. I trust you've reached a conclusion.
:{{A|vo shlq004 4 cloudretainer 01.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Hmph. You wish to hear one's opinion? Well. Things would have hardly gone so smoothly had it not been for Shenhe.
:{{A|vo shlq004 4 ningguang 06.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' That I do not deny. However, final victory was always going to be ours, even had things been a little more arduous.
:{{A|vo shlq004 4 ningguang 07.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' If it came to it, I could always destroy another Jade Chamber.
:{{A|vo shlq004 4 cloudretainer 02.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' ...One has observed your adaptation of the [[Guizhong Ballista]], and finds oneself compelled to admit that you have evidenced some degree of novel thinking.
:{{A|vo shlq004 4 cloudretainer 03.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' You have learned from past failures and prepared for this crisis in advance. This is considerable progress compared to the last time.
:{{A|vo shlq004 4 cloudretainer 04.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Hence, on balance, one finds your performance during this trial satisfactory enough. But there will no doubt be further trials to come in the future. Do not suppose that one will not continue observing you hereafter.

::'''Yun Jin:'''
::([[#Cutscene Lyrics|Translated]]) Alas!
::Two loving souls by death cruelly parted
::In madness and grief, a dark path started
::Calamity was drawn, rituals subverted
::But by her cold steel was death averted
::Mortal ties broken, with the adepti she went
::Their abiding place filling paternal bonds rent
::To her red strings of binding they sent
::And they dwelt long together, content
::The crane returned to a home without luster
::The cobwebs overgrown, the grave-shrouds a-fluster
::But one bond upon her
::This world could not muster
::Thus does the Divine Damsel's tale duly end
::But today a new tale I have to append
::Which I shall now tell &mdash; if you shall attend
::From the world she seems apart
::But there are those who know her heart
::With crimson spear and flashing brand
::To still the raging tides they stand
::The crane once returned
::And once, she was spurned
::She turned, and left alone

:{{A|vo dialog shlq004 shiyu 01.ogg}} '''Shiyu:''' I wonder when I'll be able to build a Jade Chamber of my own? *sigh* It'll take a lot more wealth than I have now.
:{{A|vo dialog shlq004 shiyu 02.ogg}} '''Shiyu:''' But hey, you've gotta dream big. Who knows, if I keep working at it... Maybe one day.
