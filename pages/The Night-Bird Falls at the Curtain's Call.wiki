==Steps==
# Go to the [[Sanctuary of Surasthana]]
# Talk to the scholars by the road
# Follow the figure you just saw
# Talk to [[Nahida]]
# Talk to [[The Balladeer]]
# Follow The Balladeer
# Continue exploring
# Talk to The Balladeer
# Wait for a while

==Gameplay Notes==
* Starting from Step 5, the active character will be restricted to the Traveler.
* If the player leaves the Irminsul Domain, the quest will continue from the "Prepare yourselves. I'm going to transport you into Irminsul." line upon talking to Nahida.
* At the conclusion of the quest, [[Scaramouche]] is removed from [[Irminsul]], effectively erasing him from the history of [[Teyvat]]. Nearly all texts, descriptions, and voice-overs that reference him are changed to reflect this. (A more detailed list can be found in [[Irminsul#Scaramouche|Irminsul § Scaramouche]].)

==Achievements==
* Completing Step 8 will grant the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement ''[[Mystery of Tatarasuna]]''.

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|In order to look for more information about [[Traveler's Sibling|your sibling]], you and [[Paimon]] decide to visit Nahida in the Sanctuary of Surasthana once more. Along the way, you hear people discussing something...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Upon obtaining quest)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You must have a whole bunch of questions after our last conversation with Nahida? Paimon was ready to ask her a million more questions, but... didn't wanna seem too pushy...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Like, about these "[[Descenders]]." So... does that just mean people like you, who come traveling to [[Teyvat]] from someplace else?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 1 paimon 03a.ogg}} {{A|vo llzaq001 1 paimon 03b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And as for your {{MC|m=sister|f=brother}}... whew, so many questions. Let's go find Nahida and see what else we can find out.
----
;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on [[Sawada]], optional)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 sawada 19.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' (I wonder what people will make of the story. Of course, we know it's based on true events, but to the average reader, it might come across as too far-fetched... Hmm...)

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on [[Aqaba]], optional)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 aqaba 19.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' (After I've finished this essay, I'm gonna get out of Sumeru for a while. It's time for a change of scenery.)

;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 1 aqaba 01.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' Come on, serious suggestions, please. I'm not trying to write a thriller here! It's supposed to be an essay, you understand? An essay. That means facts and logic.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 1 sawada 01.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' Well, if it's facts and logic you're after, you shot yourself in the foot with your choice of research topic, didn't you? "The Tatarasuna Mystery"... When so much remains unexplained, there's little to be objective about. Unless, of course, you restrict yourself to textual criticism.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 1 aqaba 02.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' Yeah, well... This is my teacher's area of research. I can't change that. But it's fascinating enough without having to sensationalize it, don't you think? The strange location, the missing details, a mysterious person...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 1 aqaba 03.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' I want to write my essay on something interesting, and I'm interested in getting to the bottom of all this. That's the only reason I came to you!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 1 sawada 02.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' Yes, you came to me, so all the more reason to take my advice! The fact is, it's the dramatization that will make people want to read it. There's no getting around that.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 1 aqaba 04.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' Uh... Okay, but...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did one of them just mention [[Tatarasuna]]? But that's all the way in [[Inazuma]]...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is it just Paimon, or is it kinda unusual for someone in Sumeru to wanna write a paper about that? ...Huh, everyone here's just going about their business &mdash; maybe it really is just Paimon. Guess people here are free to research pretty much anything.
:{{DIcon}} Still, let's go listen in.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! Let's go find out what this "Tatarasuna Mystery" is all about.

;(Approach Aqaba and Sawada)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 aqaba 01.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' Alright, I guess I'll go with my textual criticism and your editorial direction for the first draft. I have a feeling that the missing kabukimono will end up being the main focus of this paper.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 aqaba 02a.ogg}} {{A|vo llzaq001 2 aqaba 02b.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' *sigh* If only we knew where to find that Traveler... From what they say about {{MC|m=him|f=her}}, this seems like the kind of thing {{MC|m=he|f=she}}'d know about.
:{{DIcon}} Looking for me?
:{{DIcon}} If you're looking for the Traveler, that's me.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 sawada 01.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' Oh, you're the Traveler, you say? Hmm...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, what's with that face? Don't believe us?
:{{DIcon}} If you don't believe me, I'll go.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 sawada 02.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' No, no! Of course I believe you. Actually, I first heard about your great exploits when I was still in Inazuma.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 sawada 03.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' This is my first time coming face-to-face with you and your mysterious silver-haired companion... I couldn't believe my luck, and out of force of habit, I started, uh, examining the evidence... Sorry.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 aqaba 03.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' Sawada, for the love of... Haha, sorry, we don't get out much, so our social skills are kinda lacking...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 aqaba 04.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' Traveler, I hear you've helped many people a great deal, and been to many places. Would you be able to tell us about Tatarasuna?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Actually, we don't know much about that place either. In fact, we only came over here 'cause we heard YOU talking about it, and wanted to learn more.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 aqaba 05.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' Ah... I see.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry I can't help this time.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 aqaba 06.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' My teacher chose this area of research as a personal challenge. He said it's difficult to get into, because even Inazumans don't know much about Tatarasuna's past. But who'd have thought that&mdash;
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 sawada 04.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' If you don't mind, I'd love to show you all my outline for the book I'm writing about Tatarasuna.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 aqaba 07.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' Hold on, Sawada. Don't you think that's a bit of a deep dive for a first read?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 sawada 05.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' Fair point. In that case, please ease yourselves in gently by taking a look at Aqaba's latest essay draft.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 aqaba 08.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' Let me give you some background. This all started with the discovery of [[Rather Aged Notes|some records]] in Tatarasuna. The writings mentioned someone by the name of "[[Mikoshi Nagamasa]]," who crafted a fine blade.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 aqaba 09.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' But in the end, he threw it into a fire to destroy it, and killed his servant, [[Katsuragi]]. Why? Well. No one knows.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 aqaba 10.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' Apart from the sword-maker, his servant, and the one who wrote this all down, the records also mention a "kabukimono." This seems to be an Inazuman word for an eccentric stranger &mdash; someone who dresses funny or acts in an unusual way.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 sawada 06.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' That's right. Aqaba's teacher has spent quite some time researching these events on the ground. This kabukimono lived in Tatarasuna for a while before disappearing without a trace, and shortly afterwards... as Aqaba mentioned, things got pretty ugly.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So first the strange person goes missing, then a murder happens? Hmm, seems kinda fishy to Paimon!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 sawada 07.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' Yes, my thoughts exactly! So I helped out too. I asked everyone I could think of if they knew anything about what happened back then... and WOW, did I get LUCKY!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Stop shouting!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 sawada 08.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' This part's important. I just wanted to make it stand out.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 sawada 09.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' It just so happens that a friend of mine works at the government records office. He looked into it for me, and I can now confirm that all the aforementioned individuals did, in fact, live in Inazuma over four hundred years ago.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 sawada 10.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' Even back then, Tatarasuna was already at the center of Inazuma's smelting industry. The man in charge was a government official named [[Niwa Hisahide|Niwa]]. Curiously enough, it seems like he went missing, too.
:'''(Traveler):''' (Could it be...!)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, so there are TWO missing people in this story now?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 sawada 11.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' That's right! What's more, "Niwa" is a name with a lot of history to it. Have you ever heard of the great swordsmith clans of Inazuma?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, the swordsmiths? Yeah, umm... like [[Isshin Art]] and so on?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 sawada 12.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' Wow, yes, you really know your stuff. That makes things easier. So basically, this Niwa was a distant relative of the [[Kaedehara Clan]] &mdash; the last practitioners of Isshin Art.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 sawada 13.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' Something then seems to have happened in the Kaedehara Clan [[Case of the Eccentric|leading to their downfall]]... I don't know the details, but taken in light of everything else going on around that time, it makes you wonder whether it's all connected somehow...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...The Kaedehara Clan...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 aqaba 11.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' ...Sawada, you left out the biggest detail of all!
:{{DIcon}} There's more!?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 sawada 14.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' Oh! Yes, of course, how could I forget! Brace your minds, ladies and gents, for they are about to be blown. Or maybe you won't believe your ears... I wouldn't blame you, of course, because in all my years as a writer, this is by far the most&mdash;
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 aqaba 12.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' Get to the point, for Pete's sake!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 sawada 15.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' ...According to information acquired by Aqaba's teacher, the kabukimono was not a human... But a puppet.
:{{DIcon}} ...!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A puppet?
:'''(Traveler):''' ([[The Shogun]] puppet that the [[Ei|Electro Archon]] made should be ruling Inazuma with her as we speak... It couldn't be her.)
:'''(Traveler):''' (The kabukimono has to be [[The Balladeer]], but... what was he doing 400 years ago in Tatarasuna?)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 aqaba 13.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' Aha! Judging by the looks on your faces, you do know something after all?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... Uhh...
:{{DIcon}} (Glare at Paimon and hope she keeps her mouth shut.)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, no! Paimon just meant... "Uhh, how creepy!" The way you described it makes it sound like a ghost story!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 sawada 16.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' I agree. It does, but considering that non-human races in Inazuma are by no means uncommon, spooky events are to be expected... And that's exactly what my book is about &mdash; please, take a look.

::'''The Isle of Darkling Clouds'''
::Author: Sawada<br /><br /><br />
::Extract I<br /><br />
::...
::...
::A man arrived in Tatarasuna around three in the afternoon. From afar, he spied laborers walking along the mountain roads toward the factories, their shoes scuffing along the jutting stones. They walked like people convinced that so long as they reached the fire raging in the mountain's belly, they might extract from it gems beyond price. The mood that the sight inspired was ineffable, beyond mere description for those not present to witness it.
::The man barked a cheerful greeting and sprinted to join the procession. There, a towering character who stood half a head taller greeted him with a heavy slap on the back, and yet, his words were filled with respect: "Do my eyes deceive me? [[Miyazaki Kaneo|Sir Miyazaki]]! I cannot think that the return trip here from Inazuma City could have been easy on you."
::Miyazaki smiled like a young man taking the first steps on their journey, expression relaxed. "Why Katsuragi, Inazuma is the realm of the Almighty Shogun. I sailed upon the fastest ship, strode upon the swiftest sea routes. What dangers could I have possibly faced?"
::"And what about the good news?"
::"There was some... Naturally." The two burst into uproarious laughter, roughhousing with the other workers until the path's end.<br /><br />
::A young man dressed in a linen shirt and wearing a headscarf gazed into the dancing flames of the furnace before him.
::Now, the flames of a forge are unlike any other, for their intensity affects the resulting integrity of both metal and blade. So too, then, was the flame-watcher an unusual individual. At his fingertips sat a lizard, and on his face he wore a smile.
::The workshop was huge, and the furnace was deeper within. A reasonable person might think that there should have been many working alongside the watcher, yet he stood alone. Only when Katsuragi and Miyazaki strode into the room did the watcher turn.
::This watcher was Niwa, Armory Officer and administrator of Tatarasuna. Born to the Niwa Clan, which served as one of the three pillars of the Isshin Art, Niwa never argued with his siblings and was a worthy successor by all accounts. The post he received as a result of his high standing with those in power served as a statement unto itself.
::Miyazaki handed a well-bundled text to Niwa as he adjusted his expression is said: "It is as you have said, sir. The elders of your clan in the city do not think highly of our plan. Yet I still believe it to be worth a try. As such, I have found the proper vendors and procured the materials that you requested."
::Niwa studied the text and nodded. "We should try some of these new forging techniques, whether Kaedehara says yea or nay."
::Katsuragi frowned, and with a sigh he said: "Forging is a precise and difficult undertaking. You know this better than most, sirs, and still, you seek improvement each day with terrifying drive! Ah, should my lord Nagamasa hear this, the sourness in his face shall be hard to miss."
::Niwa smiled, replying: "And how goes the forging of your lord's great blade, Katsuragi?"
::Katsuragi neither wanted to shame his master nor lie to his two friends, and yet he could not think of any way to deflect, and so groused: "I see your ears are as keen as your hands, Sir Niwa. The jokes of us unlearned men are as nothing before you."
::Miyazaki hid his grin. Upon hearing this, Niwa released the lizard from his hand into Katsuragi's palm. But just as more words were to be exchanged, someone came walking nearby, their footsteps light with the celerity of youth. The head that peeked in was round and, in the light of the fires, looked like an oiled jewel.
::The young man placed some boxed food at the side, and nodding, he prepared to leave. Katsuragi called out after him: "What about your share? Aren't you going to eat it?"
::The young man, upon hearing those words, found himself slightly at a loss. After a while, he answered: "... Very well. I'll try it."
::"You are welcome to the food. We all eat the same fare, after all," Niwa said. The man nodded and left, seemingly deep in thought.<br /><br /><br />
::Extract II<br /><br />
::...
::...
::The Kabukimono was by the coast.
::Sunset fell to the accompaniment of darkness. The bands of twilight showed themselves naught, for in their place did thunderclouds roil, grumbling the omens of a coming rainstorm.
::Darkness filled the flesh of the sea and the dusk bade the clouds to kneel upon the land, its supplication mirroring the Kabukimono, with knees bent and face pointed toward the waters.
::None passed that way, and none knew what he was waiting for in silence.
::Time passed, unmeasured and uncounted, till a black cloud suddenly tore free from the sky and began to circle the Kabukimono, bearing down on him like a nightmare. Though he was not aware at first, after his studying gaze was refined by time, he understood: this cloud had marked him from the very start.
::Outbound, a fishing boat drew near, the lights of its bow flickering in and out of sight beneath falling sheets of rain. A mist unspooled across the area, stealing sight from the fisherman. Repeatedly, he exclaimed: "It is but dusk. How are my eyes darkened? Is there anyone that can deliver my boat upon safe tides?"
::Like a falling spear, the black cloud reached the bottom of the boat, and was joined in its bereftness of direction. Like a charging beast, they plunged into the shoreline. Scant steps away, the Kabukimono stood idle, slanting his head to study the grand wreck.
::Naught but half an arm was left of the one who had cried out for help, and with a "plop," it landed at the Kabukimono's feet. He crouched to better study the object, straining against the urge to take a bite out of it.
::Yet, he did not, for the dark clouds swirling down had already picked the remnants of the ship clean. The Kabukimono stared at it blankly, like an awakening dreamer. When he returned to himself, the clouds had scattered, as if they had never been there at all. As for the ship... Could it have been struck down by a storm? Who was to know? Not the Kabukimono...<br /><br /><br />
::Extract III<br /><br />
::
::...
::...
::Katsuragi rushed to the doorway and shouted: "My lord! Things go ill at the furnace. I have searched for Sir Niwa, but there is no trace of him. And much time has passed since Sir Miyazaki left to seek aid, but he has yet to send us any missive. Look..."
::Mikoshi Nagamasa turned slowly, his face grave as one attending a funeral. He spoke then, his words heavy-laden: "I wish not to say such words, Katsuragi... But Sir Miyazaki may never return."
::Katsuragi peered past Nagamasa's broad, stiff shoulders, beyond the windows. The clouds above boiled in waves of black, as if darkness now was the only weather, and might even morph into an abyssal beast and devour Tatarasuna whole.
::Over ten people had already perished. That was why... Why...
::Katsuragi recoiled as if struck. Yes! It was coming back to him now, in dribs and drabs... That was why they had to set out to seek aid!
::Miyazaki had been the first to set sail. The clouds had only just begun to form then. Traveling from Tatarasuna to Inazuma to ask for support was normally no great feat, and yet, there had been no sign of his return.
::Then a second ship was sent, followed by a third, and a fourth... Till the Kabukimono himself had departed upon the tides, under foul skies and ominous fortunes. It had been Katsuragi who had brought him back and treated him as his own, and it pained him greatly to see the lad go. Yet, the situation in Tatarasuna was severe. Even should they sacrifice more lives, it would have been worth it to gain assistance from Inazuma City.<br /><br />
::Niwa was gone, and none could find him. Afterward, Nagamasa led a search party into the mountains and the area around the furnace, all to no avail. Folk began to wonder if Niwa might have encountered an accident, but worry soon turned to suspicion, and they wondered if he had fled, unwilling to bear the sin of having caused these incidents.
::The people grew ever more suspicious, and Nagamasa himself strained against his discontent and fury. His face had grown to resemble the rumbling clouds above.
::Suddenly, a figure flashed by. Their presence did not go unnoticed by Nagamasa. He drew his blade and cut, though he only nicked the silken veil the intruder wore. For a moment, they swayed, and then, like a marionette pulled by strings, they moved behind Nagamasa, laughing darkly: "Are you seeking someone, my lord? Niwa, perhaps?"
::Nagamasa bellowed in fury: "You dare address Sir Niwa directly?" Yet, the figure parted like mist before his falling blade, only to re-materialize beyond reach but not beyond sight &mdash; a ghastly apparition indeed.
::"Was it you who slew my people?" Nagamasa howled and charged, held back only by Katsuragi's desperate grip. As his senses returned to him, he realized he was but an inch away from falling into the furnace.<br /><br /><br />
::(It seems that the rest of this work remains unfinished... From the existing text, however, it is apparent that this is a novel of fantastical, colorful sensibilities, born from an imagination well-utilized.)

::'''"A Brief Analysis of Possible Events of Historical Importance in the Tatarasuna Area"'''
::Details: This text belongs to a series of works sponsored by the Vahumana's "Veilcutter" project. It has yet to be numbered.<br /><br />
::Author: Aqaba<br /><br />
::Abstract: The Tatarasuna area has always been a major pillar of Inazuma's smithing industry. Two incidents have occurred here, and the details behind the first are vague at best. I believe, however, that there might a hidden history behind the events that transpired. Hence, this paper will attempt to analyze what may have unfolded from the available data.<br /><br /><br />
::Glossary: Tatarasuna area; [[Raiden Gokaden]]; Mikoshi Nagamasa; Kabukimono<br /><br />
::Introduction: This paper continues and expands the work of my mentor, Mr. Rumi, in his report on "The Haply Hidden Tales of Tatarasuna," and is intended to further this avenue of research. According to the data, the blade-forging techniques of Inazuma were originally handed down from the Electro Archon, also known as the Raiden Shogun. Using the arts they inherited from their Archon, the people of Inazuma devoted themselves to the process of forging. However, strange rumors that do not quite fit the steely nature of metalwork yet linger about Tatarasuna, which was a central pillar of the forging industry. There, the Mikoshi and Niwa clans, along with an eccentric puppet, serve as the three windows of insight we need to investigate the truth behind what happened.<br /><br /><br />
::Body<br /><br />
::Strange notes from the Tatarasuna area. Their contents are as follows:<br /><br />
::1
::"...Perhaps I overstep, but I think that Sir Nagamasa's mood grows better when he forges blades..."
::"...The obsession to cleanse the stain of the name '[[Mikoshi Clan|Mikoshi]]' must eat at him..."
::"...Also, Sir Katsuragi discovered a nameless eccentric while patrolling around Nazuchi Beach..."<br /><br />
::2
::"...The Inspector bought a certain number of Jade Steel ingots..."
::"...Sir Katsuragi discussed matters of smithing deep into the night with the Vice Armory Officer."<br /><br /><br />
::3
::"...We at last made a single nagamaki. We call it the '[[Katsuragikiri Nagamasa|Daitatara Nagamasa]]'..."
::"The Inspector was in high spirits, and he and the Vice Armory Officer..."
::"...[[Nozomu]] was so taken by the beauty of the Daitatara Nagamasa that he drew a picture of it..."
::"...and he performed a sword dance with that wandering eccentric..."<br /><br /><br />
::4
::"...and we could not find that eccentric..."
::"...The Inspector flew into a rage and slashed Katsuragi. The great blade cut deep into the flesh...cast his own nagamaki into the furnace's flame..."
::"...Nozomu could not abide by that order, and drew the completely melted weapon out of the furnace... He was horribly burned..."<br /><br /><br />
::5
::"...Nozomu died that night. I daresay that while Sir Katsuragi may have committed malfeasance, it was out of the goodness of his heart..."<br /><br />
::6
::"...[[Kinjirou]] hid the nagamaki and Nozomu's drawing in the Arsenal..."
::"...Nagamasa is harsh, but also knows right from wrong. But even so, he is not amenable to reason. His name indicates one obsessed with purity... Still, I and some households of Tatarasuna have not been blinded by the matter of Nagamasa's mother Chiyo, and we trust him..."
::"...I also remain unwilling to forget the joy of creating the Daitatara Nagamasa with him, and that joy of watching that nameless eccentric perform that sword-dance with Katsuragi..."<br /><br />
::7
::"Before we withdrew, we should have divided the [[Key to Some Place|Arsenal Key]] into three parts: one for the Inspector, one for the Armory Officer, and one to be left in Tatarasuna itself to prevent theft."
::"But we were in too much of a hurry, and neither the Inspector nor the Armory Officer could be found, so I was so bold as to hide the three pieces within treasure chests in Tatarasuna..."<br /><br /><br />
::The [[Rather Aged Notes|seven notes mentioned prior]] have been scattered across the Tatarasuna area. Among the seven notes, six seem to be of good physical integrity, though they all look quite old, while the last one looks more recent. I believe that the first six notes and the last are of different time periods, though the gulf in years between them needs to be verified. The contents of the first six should also be related to each other, as the incidents mentioned are quite consistent with one another.
::Rumi once mentioned in "Haply Hidden Tales of Tatarasuna" (hereafter known as "Hidden Tales") that in the past, researchers from Sumeru had investigated the cultural histories of Tatarasuna and Inazuma. Though the place has fallen into some degree of disrepair since the "Hidden Tales" were written, things have improved since the time when I wrote my original article. Regardless, what used to be an area of major industry remains a place most inhospitable, and residents of Tatarasuna may be found living and dwelling by the waters. The residents, when questioned, told the researchers of Tatarasuna's golden age centuries ago, when it was administered by Armory Officer Niwa, Vice Armory Officer Miyazaki, and Inspector Mikoshi Nagamasa. Yet, the elders among the locals with deeper ties to the region also seemed to stress the fact that there were strange rumors surrounding their homeland's past.
::A great many of these rumors revolved around the "youkai" who are so very characteristic of Inazuma's folk histories. A small portion, however, repeatedly mentions the word "puppet." It should be known that puppets are neither traditional nor common youkai in Inazuma. This fact drew the attention of the researchers to delve further, and eventually, the following pieces of information came to light:
::- A puppet did once appear in Tatarasuna. Its visage was elegant, its apparel impeccable, and the way it dressed hid all the joint lines on its body. If no one were to mention that it was indeed a puppet, it would be hard to tell at all. Additionally, this puppet seemed to possess special joint lines that would fade with time, potentially even disappearing altogether, which would perhaps eventually make the puppet seem entirely human.
::- The name of the puppet was known to almost none. Some folk claimed to have spotted it appearing around Tatarasuna, while others mentioned encountering it in the central regions of the area. Some even claimed that it would frequent the beach. Tales spread of it standing beside the sea and gazing across the waters toward Inazuma City. What it was that the puppet was gazing at remains a mystery.<br /><br />
::As mentioned earlier, the six notes all document a certain "nameless eccentric." The "eccentric," which can also be read as "Kabukimono," is usually used in Inazuma to refer to a figure who dresses or behaves in a peculiar manner. It is understandable, therefore, why this character would have left such an impression. Should the people of Tatarasuna indeed have had a puppet in their midst incurring mass panic &mdash; a good possibility considering the coexistence between youkai and humans in Inazuma at large &mdash; then the puppet would have very likely become a local resident. What is less well-known is if "the Kabukimono" was just another title for this puppet. Perhaps because it was uniquely dressed to distract attention from its more special characteristics. A workable theory, but one that still lacks enough evidence to support it. Still, it can be retained as an analytical lens of sorts.<br /><br />
::A list of individuals related to Tatarasuna has been compiled here based on historical documents from Inazuma. Starting from the administrators, the records are as follows.<br /><br />
::Armory Officer &mdash; Niwa
::Full name [[Niwa Hisahide]]. He was the inheritor of the Isshin Art, and successor to the Niwa Clan. His family, along with the Akame and Kaedehara clans, were together known as the "Isshin Sansaku." Records show that Niwa was a modest and intelligent individual who displayed remarkable talent in the administration of territory and people. His eventual whereabouts are unknown, but he was suspected to have left Tatarasuna with his family following the incident.<br /><br />
::Vice Armory Officer &mdash; Miyazaki
::Full name [[Miyazaki Kaneo]]. He was Niwa's second-in-command. His origins are unknown, and he primarily assisted Niwa in forging and personnel management. He was of affable temperament and had many friends in the region, including one Mikoshi Nagamasa.<br /><br />
::Inspector &mdash; [[Mikoshi Nagamasa]]
::The successor of the Mikoshi Clan, adopted son to oni warrior [[Mikoshi Chiyo]], and the younger adopted brother to Mikoshi Michihiro, also known as "Iwakura the Successor." With his mother missing and abandoned by his brother, Nagamasa alone bore the family name, striving daily to wipe the shame from their history. Though records state that Mikoshi Nagamasa was a stubborn figure, he was also noted to be a person of moral virtue and integrity. It has been noted in various records that he practiced forging swords for self-cultivation, and specially requested special instruction from Miyazaki to further his capabilities. However, after the famous blade, Daitatara Nagamasa, was forged, he used it to slay his subordinate, Katsuragi, for reasons unknown at present.<br /><br />
::Subordinate &mdash; Katsuragi
::Katsuragi's full name and background remain unknown. Despite all the materials I have sorted through, I have yet to find anymore additional personal information regarding him. As one of Mikoshi Nagamasa's subordinates, he was a loyal warrior who had been saved by Nagamasa in his youth. From then on, he swore to stick by his lord through thick and thin and to give his life in service if it was but asked of him.<br /><br />
::Kabukimono
::Full name unknown. Background unknown. From the many sources I have compiled combined with Rumi's personal observations, this character might have been the puppet mentioned in the rumors. The Kabukimono was a figure of fashionable grace and gentleness. According to the "Hidden Tales," he was brought back to Tatarasuna by Katsuragi, and became a member of the community. When the Kabukimono first arrived in Tatarasuna, he knew nothing of cleaning, cooking, or any work of meticulous nature. The locals taught him their skills over time, showing him how to clean his attire, dance, and craft small trinkets. Records state that the Kabukimono was there when the "Daitatara Nagamasa" was forged, though his trail ends before Mikoshi Nagamasa slew Katsuragi. I believe that the Kabukimono was indeed the aforementioned puppet, and that he quite likely had a hand in Katsuragi's death.<br /><br /><br />

:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 aqaba 15.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' Sawada was encouraging me to follow his more creative approach, but I think essays should be grounded in facts. I don't think explaining everything away with mysterious forces will cut it...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 aqaba 16.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' Ooh, how about if I plug the holes in Sawada's narrative with political intrigue? Like, um, I could put a turf war between rival factions at the center of the whole series of events.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, you're allowed to just make stuff up? Pretty sure you've gone from "essay" to "guessay" there.
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, sounds more like a novel...
:{{DIcon}} (Has this guy ever even written an essay before?)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 sawada 17.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' Aqaba, look... Your teacher has researched this extensively. I've reached out to everyone I could think of... Whatever information we have now is all that there is to know. This is as much detail as you're ever going to get.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 sawada 18.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' Besides, if there really was a political power struggle going on at anything like the level you seem to be suggesting, what hope would we ever have of finding out the truth?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 aqaba 17.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' ...Ugh, good point. Okay, back to the drawing board, I guess... Gimme some time. I need to find a new angle on this.
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We have some other stuff to do, so we'll have to say goodbye for now. Good luck with your essay!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 aqaba 18.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' Alright, thank you. If you find out any more info about all this, please do let me know! Thanks so much.

:{{DIcon}} Yes.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay... Then, even if we did know something about it, we probably couldn't share it with them, huh?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' After all, we kicked his butt and got him locked up. Information about people like that is usually super confidential, isn't it?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If you ask Paimon, Aqaba should just pick a different topic. There must be as many essay topics as there are trees in the forest. There's no point in&mdash;

:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, did you see that? He literally just went by. Over there... it looked like, like...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 2 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Balladeer!? No it can't have been, he got locked up... Quick, let's catch up and see!

;(Talk to Aqaba or Sawada again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog llzaq001 sawada 01.ogg}} '''Sawada:''' Hmm, I've not given much thought to my target audience yet... Then again, this topic should appeal to readers of all ages, surely?
:{{A|vo dialog llzaq001 aqaba 01.ogg}} '''Aqaba:''' Yeah, whatever you write, it's sure to be a huge hit! Unlike my paper... Essays are a nightmare to write, and barely anyone reads them. Don't get me wrong &mdash; the topic's great, I just wish I could find more information on it...

{{Quest Description|update|In order to look for more information about your sibling, you and Paimon decide to visit Nahida in the Sanctuary of Surasthana once more. Along the way, you hear two scholars talking about a story called the "Tatarasuna Mystery." Many details in the story line up with what you know about The Balladeer. At the same time, The Balladeer himself, who is supposed to be locked up, appears outside the Sanctuary of Surasthana. You quickly catch up to him...}}

;(Approach Nahida)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (Traveler), Paimon, there you are.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nahida, bad news! We just saw The Balladeer, strolling around in public!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did he escape, or...? ...Aah! It's him!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 scaramouche 01.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Hmph. Sure enough, you're here.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, what are you doing in the Sanctuary of Surasthana!? Aren't you supposed to be locked up!?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I know you must have a lot of questions. Please, allow me to explain.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It was my idea to set The Balladeer free. We made a deal, and he's gonna do some investigation in [[Irminsul]] for me.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A deal!? You sure you trust this guy?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 scaramouche 02.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' What did you expect? Why do you think Sumeru would keep me around otherwise? ...Or maybe killing me is all you can think about?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 scaramouche 03.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' But if that's the case, why haven't you done it already?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't flatter yourself. It was... Nahida said there's still some mysteries in you to figure out!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 scaramouche 04.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Ah, so if it were up to you, you'd finish the job? Guess I had you all wrong. There I was thinking you were just getting cold feet.
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Ugh, well that escalated quickly. Not a good start... Could I ask you all to please calm down?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But Paimon's worried about you, Nahida! Don't let him trick you!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 scaramouche 05.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Haha, it's not every day you see people questioning the God of Wisdom's judgment. Just when you think you've seen it all.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't you dare try to drive a wedge between us!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' As long as the terms are reasonable, I don't think there's a problem in making a deal. Even with The Balladeer.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 scaramouche 06.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Well, I for one have no reason to doubt you, considering you even struck a deal with [[The Doctor]].
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes, one in which I gained valuable information. You'll come to understand more about that in the fullness of time.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The Balladeer's power was all but completely spent after your battle. He's no longer strong enough to be a strategic threat to us. That puts him in quite a precarious position.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Plus, he's a former [[Harbinger]] with knowledge of many of the [[Fatui]]'s sensitive secrets. Being stuck here in Sumeru could make him a sitting duck, depending on how the Fatui plan to respond.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait a second... former? You mean, he's not a Harbinger anymore?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I take no pleasure in saying this, but... it seems as if The Doctor had no intention of welcoming back a loser, so...
:{{DIcon}} ...So he tossed you out like trash.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 scaramouche 07.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Sometimes it's you using them, other times it's them using you. Most human relationships are this way... certainly all the stable ones are. That's how it was between me and the Fatui, and also between each of the Harbingers.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 scaramouche 08.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' So as long as you have some value to offer, nobody will ever abandon you. But after recent events, even I have to admit that I'm not worth quite what I used to be...
:{{DIcon}} Really? What a crying shame.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 scaramouche 09.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' ...Hmph, well, if the Fatui are gonna re-evaluate my utility, I need to have a backup plan for myself.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' As we discussed, I don't like causing harm to living beings, and you said you need protection. So, why not join forces with us?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 scaramouche 10.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' I think these two have made their objection to that idea fairly clear, don't you? And they're your friends, so I guess you'll be siding with them.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, obviously! Nahida, don't listen to him!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Then let's put that discussion to the side for now. We still have time.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Today can be a trial run. Where we go from here will depend on how well we manage to cooperate today.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 scaramouche 11.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Alright. Then I'll do what we agreed.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Good. Go now, and keep in touch.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nahida, are you... are you serious about this?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 15.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I have my reasons for this decision. In fact... I'm largely doing it for your benefit, (Traveler).
:{{DIcon}} ...For me?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 16.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes. As I told you once before, there's information about your twin in Irminsul.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, yeah. Actually, that's the whole reason we came to see you today. So you have an update on that?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 17.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Mm-hmm. You may remember me mentioning that the Fatui had not included your twin's details in the "Descender" category. This is an extremely important point.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 18.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's possible that the Fatui have other information that even I don't know about. And since The Balladeer used to be one of them, he'll be better acquainted with this information than I am.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 19.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' He was granted the power to connect with Irminsul when he almost became the god of a new era. Even though he no longer has the Gnosis, some traces of its power remain in him. He can still connect.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 20.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The amount of information in Irminsul is vast beyond description. Sifting through all of it without knowing what to look for would take too long, even for me.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 21.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' So I asked The Balladeer to search in Irminsul for any information about the Descenders. He's more familiar with this kind of information, and should be able to find it more quickly.
:{{DIcon}} What if he lies to you?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Exactly! Or what if... Paimon just doesn't trust him. He's treated us as enemies every time we've run into him.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 22.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I understand, but sometimes, everything is dictated by which side you're on.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 23.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' How things will go in the future depends on what information he brings back. And (Traveler)... I know what your heart desires most of all.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 24.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Our minds have connected several times before. There is a corner of your heart reserved for an intense longing... A feeling of being all alone in the dark, searching for the one candle whose light still burns.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 25.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' As Sumeru's deity, it is my responsibility to be on guard against The Balladeer. But as someone who counts you as a friend, I want to do something for you.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 26.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' If this deal with The Balladeer can give you the answers you've been longing to find, then it's worth it.
:{{DIcon}} ...Thank you, Nahida.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 27.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's my pleasure, really. You're Sumeru's hero! You've more than earned it.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, Paimon's still worried about this idea... Is there anything we can do to help?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 28.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I was going to contact you about that, but then you suddenly showed up of your own accord. Seems like we have a telepathic connection.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 29.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' In fact, I was going to ask you to supervise The Balladeer on my behalf while he carries out the task I assigned.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 30.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Even though he only has a fraction of his full power left, that's still a fraction of a former Harbinger. If you could accompany him, it would put my mind at ease.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 31.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Of course, I'll be there to help guide you through Irminsul from the outside.
:{{DIcon}} Got it.
:{{DIcon}} I'm glad to be able to help.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 32.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Great. Thank you.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 4 nahida 33.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Prepare yourselves. I'm going to transport you into Irminsul.
:;(The Traveler enters Irminsul)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow... It looks pretty different here compared to last time.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The colors are gentler... Guess that must be because Sumeru's at peace now.
----
;(Talk to The Balladeer)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 scaramouche 01.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Look at that, hot on my heels. You know, you didn't have to cut your catch-up short just to keep me company. Oh, but I guess you panicked when you realized that I might enter Irminsul ahead of you.
:{{DIcon}} Nahida sent me to babysit you.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Shut your beak, jailbird! No way a prisoner gets to be so smug!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 scaramouche 02.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' I understand that prisoners have to put up with harassment from the guards, but right now, I'm on temporary release, so maybe you should think about backing off a little.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Sounds like a successful rendezvous.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I need to be quite clear about something. In a few moments, you'll be entering into the innermost region of Irminsul. It is an environment like no other, and the most important place in all of Sumeru.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Unlike anywhere else, Irminsul's inner region consists exclusively of torrents of information. You must put aside your differences and be extremely careful as you navigate your way through.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I know there are many grievances between you on both sides, but it is essential that you remain calm after entry. This is as much for your own safety as anything else.
:{{DIcon}} ...Understood.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Fine, let's call a truce, but only until this mission's over...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 scaramouche 03.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Let's cut each other a little slack, shall we? We are gonna be traveling together, after all.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 scaramouche 04.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Per my agreement with Lesser Lord Kusanali, I'll be at the front. It's my job to lead the way and get rid of any obstacles in our path. All you have to do is keep your pretty eyes open and try not to fall behind.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ha! You sure are confident, Paimon'll give you that. You make it sound like you're even more experienced at adventuring than us!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 scaramouche 05.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' If there are no further objections, I suggest we get going.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 scaramouche 06.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Or did you need some time to mentally prepare yourselves?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You...! Ugh! The snark on this guy! It's unbearable!
:{{DIcon}} There's no need for all the biting sarcasm.
:{{DIcon}} Focus on doing your job.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 scaramouche 07.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' ...Hmph.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 scaramouche 08.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' We can start now.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Irminsul access granted. Initiating connection procedure...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is this a small sapling?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Argh, darn it! C'mon, let's catch up with him!
:;(The player enters the innermost area of Irminsul)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow... So this is the inside of Irminsul...
:{{DIcon}} It's different than what I imagined...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohh... Paimon's never seen anything like this. And it feels like a sacred place...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 scaramouche 09.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Irminsul is closely intertwined with the entirety of Teyvat. Every bit of information flowing here means something.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 scaramouche 10.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Pick your jaws up off the floor. It's time to go.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why is it that Paimon just wants to do the opposite of everything he says...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 scaramouche 11.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' ...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 scaramouche 12.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Lesser Lord Kusanali, we will now proceed to the heart of Irminsul.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Can you still sense where the heart of Irminsul is?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 scaramouche 13.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Yes. Permission to begin searching for information there?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Permission granted. Go ahead.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 scaramouche 14.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Let's go. Stay close, don't go running off.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, so... say we did go running off in here, what would happen?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 scaramouche 15.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' ...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What are you smirking at?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 scaramouche 16.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' I was just imagining the look on your travel companion's face if you went and got lost.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 5 scaramouche 17.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Anything's possible in here &mdash; you can't rule anything out. So if you wanna stay safe, your best option is to stick close to me.

;(Follow The Balladeer)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' These sapling things have spread out...

:'''The fragments have dissipated, and the space seems to have been affected somehow...'''

;(Approach the sapling)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 10 scaramouche 03.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Those are all packets of information from inside Irminsul. Be careful not to touch them.

;(Approach the sapling)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...No wonder he mentioned about getting lost. Whaddya know, he was actually telling the truth...

:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 scaramouche 03.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Ready when you are.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Then please begin. Preparing to access cognitive currents. Establishing waypoint...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Balladeer's actually doing what Nahida tells him... Guess he must want to stay alive.
:'''(Traveler):''' (He hasn't put up any resistance, and he seems good at working on the frontline... Maybe he had a similar role in the Fatui?)
:'''(Traveler):''' (First Aqaba and Sawada's stories, now this... What a strange individual.)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The rest is up to you. If you discover anything at all, make sure to share it with us.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 scaramouche 04.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Will do.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... For once, we're the ones with nothing to do...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ((Traveler), Paimon, would you like to talk?)
:'''(Traveler):''' (Nahida? ...Is this a telepathic conversation?)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (Yes. I've also invited Paimon to join.)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Huh? ...What the... We can talk to each other inside our heads?)
:'''(Traveler):''' (I'm guessing that you don't want us to disturb The Balladeer.)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (Hehe, that's part of it. Plus, we're all friends. There's nothing wrong with us talking like this once in a while.)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Paimon's never tried this before. This is great!)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (So, Paimon's been wanting to ask you something. Don't you think The Balladeer's a bit of a walking contradiction? He's always talking back, but he seems to listen to what you say...)
:'''(Traveler):''' (Yes, and he seems to excel at doing odd jobs for others...)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (As I've told you before, there are still some mysteries for him to resolve. Things that are clear as day to me, but that he has yet to understand.)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (Perhaps today will be the day that he finds some answers.)
:'''(Traveler):''' (Is it about his past? The "betrayals"? And the other events in Inazuma?)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (Well done. Smart and attentive as always.)
:'''(Traveler):''' (Actually, I caught a glimpse of a few things when I ran into [[Haypasia]] at [[Pardis Dhyai]]...)

:'''You relate what you saw in The Balladeer's mind while in Pardis Dhyai...'''

:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (So you made contact with that part of his mind... Well, it's true. Betrayal turned The Balladeer into the person he is today.)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Huh, Paimon thought nothing could get under that guy's skin. Turns out he can get hurt and angry just like anyone else.)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (Everyone has a history, Paimon. Even if you're a puppet created by the [[Ei|Electro Archon]].)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Speaking of puppets, we ran into two people at the Akademiya today talking about an essay. Turns out their topic was about the Tatarasuna incident... Nahida, do you know anything about that?)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (If you mean the mysterious events, the kabukimono, and so on... Yes, I know about all of that.)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Really? Because from what they were saying, it sounded like lots of Tatarasuna's history is still unexplained, and most of the information we have now is just from people filling the gaps with their imagination. At least, that's what they thought...)

:'''You tell Nahida about the story Aqaba and Sawada are writing...'''

:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (...Oh? How interesting. Those two managed to deduce quite a lot through guesswork alone.)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (So the guessay got it right!?)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (Well, they guessed right about one thing: Tatarasuna was sabotaged.)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 scaramouche 05.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Must be a riveting conversation you three are having. Funny how all the good ones happen when I'm not involved.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! Wh&mdash;What makes you think we're talking to each other?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 scaramouche 06.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Don't insult me. You're having a private conversation without me. Obviously, I must be the topic of said conversation.
:{{DIcon}} We have every right to keep certain things confidential.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 scaramouche 07.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Of course you do. You can't have your prisoner knowing too much.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, uh, have you found anything yet?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 scaramouche 08.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Still looking. Don't get your hopes up, though. You and your twin come from outside this world. It wouldn't surprise me if there was nothing on either of you in Irminsul at all.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Wait, how'd you know about that? Did Nahida tell you?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 scaramouche 09.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' It's not like we've never met before. And anyway, you're world-famous. It'd be more surprising if I didn't know a few things about you.
:{{DIcon}} Every conversation with you is hard work...
:{{DIcon}} ...But your attitude is better than I thought.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 scaramouche 10.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Right now, we have to keep the peace. I'm not interested in creating more misery for myself, and making cordial conversation is something I can manage.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 scaramouche 11.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' ...Huh? Wait...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This light... It looks similar to those saplings. What could it be?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 scaramouche 12.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' ...Anonymous data?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Don't you forget the agreement. You have to share it with us!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 scaramouche 13.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Shush. Just wait.
:;(The scene changes to an Inazuman building)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 escher 01.ogg}} '''???:''' ...Mr. Niwa, are you certain this is worth the risk? We are talking about Tatarasuna's furnace, after all. It may not pay to act rashly...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 niwa 01.ogg}} '''???:''' There's no one else who can enter the furnace. It has to be me.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 escher 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Is that so...? *sigh* Well, since you insist...
:;(The scene changes back to the present)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 scaramouche 14.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' *gasp*... It's...
:'''(Traveler):''' (That name... Niwa was the man in charge at Tatarasuna. Plus, he belongs to the lineage of Isshin Art...)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 11 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa!
:;(The scene returns to the Inazuma flashback)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 escher 01.ogg}} '''???:''' I have been in Tatarasuna for some time now. You have shown me great hospitality, as has Mikoshi Nagamasa... and indeed, everyone else.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 escher 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Under your leadership, Tatarasuna is a warm, welcoming place, like a giant village. People are gainfully employed, their lives have purpose. They are motivated.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 escher 03.ogg}} '''???:''' As I understand, the Raiden Shogun has, in recent years, eliminated much of the evil that plagued Inazuma. As for Tatarasuna, it was originally established as a means of safely disposing [[Crystal Marrow]].
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 escher 04.ogg}} '''???:''' The forging industry with Crystal Marrow as a raw material has since flourished, giving rise to generations of swordsmiths &mdash; some world-renowned, others unknown... all passing on their legacy.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 escher 05.ogg}} '''???:''' Skills, blood, dreams... Every smith brought into this trade looks to find their purpose between steel and blade. That is why you accepted the proposal brought to you by myself and [[Akame Clan|Akame]].
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 01.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' Yes, well... Were it not for you coming to Inazuma and happening to make Akame's acquaintance, the two of you never would have joined forces. And he would be the first to admit that there's no way he could have revolutionized our forging process like this on his own &mdash; at least not on the same timescale.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 02.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' You allowed Akame to take all the credit for a method that you jointly developed, he sold it to me, and now, every piece of ore here is smelted using the new technique.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 03.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' Even now, you remain one of Tatarasuna's key consultants, working right here alongside us. I believe it is you, Sir, who are truly responsible for the changes in our manufacturing and forging methods.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 escher 06.ogg}} '''Escher:''' You flatter me. From the outset, I saw much that was commendable in the forging industry of Inazuma, and it has been my great honor to befriend you all.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 04.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' So you say, Escher... But is this really the truth?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 escher 07.ogg}} '''Escher:''' My good sir, what do you mean?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 05.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' ...I tried to resist thinking it was all connected because I didn't want to speculate, and I didn't want to believe that things could turn out this way.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 06.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' What have we gained from adopting your new technology? Ominous, black smoke, mounting production problems... Worker fatigue and casualties are up, and continuing to rise at an alarming rate.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 07.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' And recently, as you well know, someone died because of that strange filth inside the furnace. We've kept the truth from spreading outside, but still, I suspect you understand it better than I do.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 08.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' None of the people who went out to get help have come back. Now, our mutual friend, the kabukimono, is taking the [[Plume of Luxury|golden feather]] to Narukami Island to seek an audience with the Shogun. This is our last hope.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 09.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' But that doesn't faze you, does it, Escher? Nothing does... Otherwise, why would you still be standing there with that smile on your face?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 escher 08.ogg}} '''Escher:''' I'm just surprised that you finally chose to be so sincere. I'm sure you've been harboring these suspicions for quite some time.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 10.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' ...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 11.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' Mikoshi Nagamasa may have noticed that there was one common denominator among all these events... namely you, Escher. But Mr. Mikoshi is more cautious than I. He does things by the book.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 escher 09.ogg}} '''Escher:''' After all, Nagamasa is the adopted son of [[Mikoshi Chiyo|Mikoshi Torachiyo]], the youkai struck down by the Shogun's own hand. If he truly seeks to redeem his family's honor, an abundance of caution is well-advised.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 12.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' ...You're well-informed on the subtleties of his situation for a mechanic all the way from Fontaine. Are you sure you're not a little overqualified?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 escher 10.ogg}} '''Escher:''' Why, Mr. Niwa, are you suggesting I find a job as a diplomat? Sadly, I am so very attached to my craft...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 13.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' Enough, Escher.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 14.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' I'm here because an evil force is raging inside the furnace, and someone needs to take your new device inside the high-risk zone so we can absorb it and put an end to the problem.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 15.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' ...I'm in charge here, and I'm about to take some responsibility and head inside, probably to my death. But what about you? What are you still doing here?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 escher 11.ogg}} '''Escher:''' Judging from the look in your eyes, you don't seem to trust me.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 16.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' Drop the act. We're past that now. Whoever you are, it looks like your plan to destroy Tatarasuna has worked.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 17.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' I just want to know what you're still doing here. What's left? Don't you have all your answers by now?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 escher 12.ogg}} '''Escher:''' Honestly, I'm just waiting for the right moment.
:;(Escher stabs Niwa)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 escher 13.ogg}} '''Escher:''' A moment like this where you finish talking and I stop you from entering the furnace.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 18.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' Argh! You, you...
:;(Niwa falls to the floor)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 escher 14.ogg}} '''Escher:''' ...Heh, you're a little smarter than I initially gave you credit for.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 escher 15.ogg}} '''Escher:''' I thought I'd disguised myself exceptionally well, at least for the first few days. But to my surprise, you had your people look into my background right from the start.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 escher 16.ogg}} '''Escher:''' It's a long journey from Inazuma to Fontaine, but that didn't stop them. Eventually, they managed to confirm that Escher was an alias, and that I was not from Fontaine at all.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 escher 17.ogg}} '''Escher:''' And yet, despite all of that, you still fail to realize my true identity, and what I seek in Tatarasuna. Did you really think you would be able to see through my plan?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 19.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' ...Ugh... If you kill me, there's no one who can get inside the furnace... So you're really going to destroy this place... is that it?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 dottore 01.ogg}} '''Escher:''' Oh, but you're quite wrong &mdash; there is one other person. Hm, some may not see him as a person, but... you told him yourself: "You're not a puppet. You're a human... you're just missing a heart."
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 20.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' ...!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 21.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' Whoever you're working for won't get away with this. They'll be found out. But... this makes no sense. What are you really trying to accomplish by all this? Why go to all this trouble?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 dottore 02.ogg}} '''Escher:''' It's no trouble at all... Patience is a virtue which I have in abundance. This is all part of a carefully controlled experiment.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 dottore 03.ogg}} '''Escher:''' If you must know, I am happy to divulge my true identity. I am a Fatui Harbinger. Call me "[[The Doctor]]."
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 22.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' ...The... Fatui? Who... What do you want...?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 dottore 04.ogg}} '''Escher:''' Just to create a minor inconvenience for your nation.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 23.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' That's it? THAT's why you... gave us your cursed technology... just to let loose the evil energy from the Crystal Marrow...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 dottore 05.ogg}} '''Escher:''' Hehe, look how even the righteous soul is filled with venom when faced with its demise.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 dottore 06.ogg}} '''Escher:''' My device functions precisely as you say. It is the only chance you have of preventing a catastrophe and keeping the truth from the outside world. However... I did not make it with you in mind.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 dottore 07.ogg}} '''Escher:''' It is easier for a person to be possessed by evil spirits when they are filled with hate. So, give in to your fury... I want to see what happens when a malevolent heart is placed into an unsuspecting puppet.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 dottore 08.ogg}} '''Escher:''' Make no mistake: Even without you, that pure, innocent puppet would only end up being used by someone else instead. What other reason would a human have for befriending one who is not of our kind?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 24.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' ...*gasping for air*... *gasping for air*... *cough*
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 25.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' If you give him... my heart... tell him that both Nagamasa... and I... see him as... one of us.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 niwa 26.ogg}} '''Niwa:''' He has nothing to prove to anyone... because not everyone... just wants to use other people. The only ones who think like that... are people like you...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 dottore 09.ogg}} '''Escher:''' What a beautiful way to see the world. It almost makes me feel a little guilty... Hm, then out of respect for you, I shall redefine myself.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 dottore 10.ogg}} '''Escher:''' Think of me as a monster or a demon, if you wish... At least this way, your death is not a consequence of your own folly turning you into an easy target. You simply lost to something more powerful than you could ever hope to defeat.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 dottore 11.ogg}} '''Escher:''' I say, Mr. Niwa, let's see what happens. Will your puppet friend become a human? No, that will prove quite impossible.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 dottore 12.ogg}} '''Escher:''' ...Mr. Niwa? ...Tsk, already dead. What a pity.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 dottore 13.ogg}} '''Escher:''' Phew...
:;(Escher's disguise is removed)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 dottore 14.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Jester, I have completed the task you gave me. Creating a gap and infiltrating Inazuma's inner workings... Heh, what fun it was.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 dottore 15.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' I'd like to introduce a puppet to you. If he proves useful, let's make him our newest comrade. And if not... let's turn him to dust.
:;(The flashback ends)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 scaramouche 01.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' ...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, are you all right?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 scaramouche 02.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' ...Dottore? Hahaha... Dottore!!!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 scaramouche 03.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' ...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 scaramouche 04.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Good, good...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Was that The Doctor? Did he... turn into a mechanic from Fontaine?
:{{DIcon}} I'm afraid so.
:{{DIcon}} He was the one behind the Tatarasuna incident.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But why did we see things from his perspective...?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' When I touched The Doctor to confirm whether he'd eliminated all his segments, I read this memory in his mind. You have to admit, it must be the truth.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 scaramouche 05.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Maybe so... But it means nothing.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Does it? But this memory shows that Niwa didn't betray you. He never meant for you to be the one to take the device into the furnace.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' You know very well what that means. Even more so than I.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 scaramouche 06.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' ...
:'''(Traveler):''' (This betrayal was a lie that he has believed for hundreds of years. Was this part of The Doctor's experiment?)
:'''(Traveler):''' (If the betrayal never happened... it existed only in his imagination. But where does this leave him?)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's... give him some space. He looks really mad. Paimon doesn't want to be anywhere near him right now.
:{{DIcon}} Okay, let's go over there.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (We need to give him some time to process his emotions.)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Paimon's still confused about the Tatarasuna incident. So The Doctor was behind it, but why has that gotten him so worked up?)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (Nobody has ever deceived you like that, Paimon. It's natural that you find it difficult to understand. Perhaps he needed to learn this someday.)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (So now you have the complete picture. Katsuragi took the kabukimono to live with the people of Tatarasuna. Later, The Doctor showed up, disguised as a mechanic from Fontaine... and that's when the trouble began.)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (It was all a horrific experiment planned by The Doctor... Everything he did was just to plant seeds of disaster in Inazuma that would bear fruit in the future.)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (Of all the unwitting participants in The Doctor's experiment, The Balladeer became the main test subject.)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (After the events you just saw in that memory, The Doctor put Niwa's heart into the device and handed it to The Balladeer. Then, he instructed him to enter the furnace and absorb all the filth caused by the smelting process.)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (The load was far beyond what he expected, but The Balladeer survived... He left the furnace in sheer exhaustion and said to the mechanic: "This device seems to have protected me. What's in it?")
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (The mechanic answered: "Niwa fled this place for fear of punishment, but he left you a gift. He said it's the one thing that you've been looking for... He took it straight from the chest of one of his innocent servants.")
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (The mechanic removed the withered heart from the device as he spoke.)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (The Balladeer was stunned that such unthinkable cruelty had brought him the thing he'd been longing for his entire life. A heart acquired through cold-blooded murder is a cursed thing, but it had protected him from the filth...)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (He thought Niwa had completely betrayed him, and yet this very betrayal had ensured his survival. Overwhelmed with anger and sorrow, The Balladeer threw the heart to the ground and left Tatarasuna without looking back.)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Holy moly... So The Doctor killed an innocent man and pinned everything on the victim? That's terrible...)
:'''(Traveler):''' (Being betrayed and abandoned by a close friend is sure to cause great resentment... Now we know what was behind his decision to take revenge on the Raiden Gokaden a hundred years ago.)
:'''(Traveler):''' (But it doesn't mean that vengeance was the right decision...)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 14 nahida 15.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (Yes. Only if he understands this can he choose a new path forward.)

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 12 scaramouche 02.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' ...Dottore, you brazen-faced...! Niwa didn't run from justice... you killed him!
----
;(After some time)
:'''A while later...'''

:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sh&mdash;Shall we see how he's doing?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, you all right?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 01.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' ...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's a scary expression.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 02.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' ...Are you worried about me? If we didn't have such a history, I'd almost think that qualifies me to be your friend.
:{{DIcon}} We just want to make sure this doesn't affect the plan.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 03.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' It won't. I'll keep my end of the deal.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 04.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' ...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, are you investigating the stuff we wanna know about?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 05.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' That's why we're here.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 06.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' But unfortunately, there's no information about the Descenders in Irminsul.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' If even you can't find anything, that seems to confirm it: Irminsul does not keep records on the Descenders. Anyone who comes from beyond this world is not counted as part of Teyvat.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Does that mean we have to leave empty-handed...?
:{{DIcon}} ...
::{{DIcon}} Not unexpected, but still... thank you.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 07.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Don't thank me just yet.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 08.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' You look really upset... Heh, well, since Irminsul was a dead end, I guess I can share some other info that might interest you.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? About what?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 09a.ogg}} {{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 09b.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' The reason why there are records about your {{MC|m=sister|f=brother}} in Irminsul... It might have something to do with [[Khaenri'ah]]. Apparently, Khaenri'ah was {{MC|m=her|f=his}} first destination when {{MC|m=she|f=he}} arrived in this world.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 10a.ogg}} {{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 10b.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Plus, {{MC|m=she|f=he}} only came to this world because the heavens responded to the summoning.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The heavens... responded?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 11a.ogg}} {{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 11b.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' [[Pierro|The Jester]] told me this himself. You can take his word on this. He was a royal mage in Khaenri'ah, and lived with your {{MC|m=sister|f=brother}} for a time.
:{{DIcon}} The Jester, another Fatui Harbinger...
:{{DIcon}} ...Why?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 12.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' I don't know the details. It's up to you whether you want to believe me. All I can say is, I wouldn't lie to you about this.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 13.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Did you get all that, Lesser Lord Kusanali?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes. Astonishing news.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 14.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Does this info count towards my mission? It wasn't from Irminsul, but was it valuable?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Very valuable.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 15.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Good. In that case... I'll take some time for myself now.
:;(A barrier forms around Scaramouche, Paimon, and the Traveler)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What have you done?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 16.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Lesser Lord Kusanali was right: My power's all but completely spent. Even if I use all of the divine power left in me, I can't sustain this shield for very long.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 17.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' (Traveler), I shared a secret with you, and now you owe me. So, in return, I'd like you to answer a question for me.
:{{DIcon}} What do you want to know?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 18.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Give me your hand.
:'''(Traveler):'''  ...!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 19.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' (...Can you hear my voice inside your head?)
:'''(Traveler):''' (Are you trying to brainwash me?)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 20.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' (No, I can't do anything like that anymore. At most, all I can do is exchange a few words with you.)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 21.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' (So tell me: In this world, is it possible... to change the past?)
:'''(Traveler):''' (!!!)
:'''(Traveler):''' (Wait. Why would you ask that...?)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 22.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Done.
:;(Scaramouche releases the Traveler's hand)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What the... What happened? Paimon only saw you hold hands for a second...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 23a.ogg}} {{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 23b.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Nothing. I was just thanking {{MC|m=him|f=her}} for helping me.
:'''(Traveler):''' (Wait, that look... Did he see me hesitate? But that was because I know about [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]]...)
:'''(Traveler):''' (Uh-oh, I think... by not denying it immediately, I gave him the answer he needed...)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 24.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' So long. I suggest you get yourselves out of here quickly.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Where are you going? Hey, wait up! Didn't you say not to go running off!?
:{{DIcon}} Balladeer! Stop!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, we have to stop him!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 25.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' Fast reaction time. But I don't think we'll be seeing each other again.
:;(Scaramouche disappears)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 26.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' From this day forth, the names "Balladeer" and "kabukimono" will cease to exist.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 27.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' ...Those who died in Tatarasuna because of me deserve another chance at life.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Balladeer! Don't do anything stupid!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 28.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' You know, I never did like insects. Hordes of the puny things swarming together can be a real nuisance... and I enjoy nothing more than to stamp them out like the pests they are.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 scaramouche 29.ogg}} '''Scaramouche:''' But if a colony of harmless ants isn't threatening anyone, I guess they deserve to be left alone... Luckily, everything can be set right. It's time to solve this once and for all.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Balladeer! Balladeeeer!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 15 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh-oh, he disappeared! C'mon, we gotta find him somehow!
:;(The Traveler and Paimon try to look for him)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 16 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no, he's really gone...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 16 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...Hello? Can you hear me?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 16 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nahida!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 16 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (Traveler), Paimon, Balladeer, what happened just now? I was suddenly cut off by some kind of power...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 16 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It was The Balladeer's fault! He... he shut you out.

:'''You tell Nahida everything that happened...'''

:{{A|vo llzaq001 16 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...I didn't think he'd be capable of something like that with so little power left.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 16 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Did he keep some of his power hidden when he was defeated? Or... did he achieve something beyond his abilities, and it took everything he had...?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 16 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Where the heck did he go? It's all our fault, we were supposed to keep an eye on him... Sorry, Nahida...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 16 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Don't be, it's not your fault. Please let me handle this from here, even though I'm not sure I can solve it.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 16 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' We're running out of time. Follow my lead and get out of Irminsul as soon as possible.
:;(The Traveler is teleported out of Irminsul)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're out! And we're at... uh, an inn or something?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' This is an emergency. I'll have to ask you to stay here for now. Everything's arranged, and nobody will disturb you.
:{{DIcon}} No, I want to help you!
:{{DIcon}} Isn't there anything I can do?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I'm sorry, but this isn't something I need your help with. Leave this one to me.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' An emergency? How bad is it? Nahida, will you be okay?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Don't worry. If my assessment is correct, though there may be some minor disturbances, it won't lead to a disaster. Please rest and recover your strength here until I say it's safe.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Her voice has gone.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon can't shake the feeling that something really big has happened. What do you think The Balladeer meant? And why did he suddenly grab onto you before?
:'''(Traveler):'''  (Paimon doesn't remember [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]]... And The Balladeer's question was a strange one. It's hard to explain in full, and the truth might be very distressing for Paimon...)
:'''(Traveler):'''  (I'll skip the part about Greater Lord Rukkhadevata for now, and focus on The Balladeer.)

:'''You tell Paimon what The Balladeer asked you, and what he might have been planning...'''

:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He wants to change the past? But... surely that's impossible.
:{{DIcon}} It's not easy, that's for sure.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right! You can't just rewrite history. All that stuff happened already in real life!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's like... Umm, imagine Paimon drank all the water in this inn. Even if no one was there to see it, Paimon would sure as heck remember drinking it.
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, great example.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, so why does Paimon still have a bad feeling about this...? Paimon can't help but feel scared about what he might do...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *whine* Paimon's so confused...
:{{DIcon}} Maybe he wants to erase himself from history.
:;(Paimon knocks a vase off the table and it shatters on the ground)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? ...Aaah!!!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon! Are you okay!?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sorry, Paimon accidentally, uh... Aw, it's The Balladeer's fault for causing Paimon all this mental stress!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But erasing yourself from history...? It's unthinkable! Is that really possible in Irminsul?
:{{DIcon}} Not necessarily, but... maybe.
:{{DIcon}} I'm just guessing here.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Whew... Uh-oh, Paimon's head is overheating from trying to understand what he's up to... and it's still not working!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Gaaah!!! Paimon's had it with that little brat! He's been nothing but trouble ever since we met him!
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's no way he'll actually succeed, right? Otherwise... won't everyone who's connected to him be affected too?
:'''(Traveler):''' (Indeed. If The Balladeer does erase himself from Irminsul, many people in Inazuma will be affected... I can't imagine what that situation would look like.)
:'''(Traveler):''' (Worst case scenario, it will affect everyone with a connection to the Raiden Gokaden... [[Kazuha]], [[Ayaka]], [[Ayato]]... Will this mean that they'll disappear!?)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's nothing we can do about it at this point... Hey, have you got any ideas on what we should do next?
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seems like now there's nothing left for us to do but to go to sleep. But Paimon's still so worried! Paimon won't be able to sleep a wink tonight...
:{{DIcon}} Me neither.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So how about, uh... w&mdash;we list all our favorite foods to take our mind off things? Heck, if that doesn't work, Paimon's probably gonna collapse of anxiety here.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, Paimon'll start. First dish, hmmm... [[Mondstadt Grilled Fish]]! Oh, and [[Chicken-Mushroom Skewer]]s, [[Tea Break Pancake]]s, [[Cream Stew]], [[Sautéed Matsutake]]...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...And [[Jueyun Chili Chicken]], [[Almond Tofu]], [[Satisfying Salad]]...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, ooh, also [[Adeptus' Temptation]], [[Golden Shrimp Balls]], [[Triple-Layered Consommé]], [[Lotus Seed and Bird Egg Soup]], and, and...
:;(Nighttime changes to daytime)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... Umm...
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Mm? Huh...
:{{DIcon}} Paimon? What's wrong?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 24.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... What are we... Wh&mdash;What was Paimon supposed to be doing just now?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 25.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon was, um... talking...? Huh, Paimon suddenly can't remember what she was talking about. What was it, again?
:{{DIcon}} You were getting so worried about the situation with The Balladeer...
:{{DIcon}} ...that you started listing foods.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 26.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm? The Balladeer...?
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 27.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is that a food, too? Huh... Weird name, though...
:'''(Traveler):''' (...!?)
:'''(Traveler):''' (Paimon doesn't remember The Balladeer!? That must mean... he actually pulled it off?)
:'''(Traveler):''' (But how did he have that ability? This doesn't make sense...)
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 28.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's wrong? Your eyes are like saucers... Was it something Paimon said?
:{{DIcon}} No, it's nothing.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 29.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, The Balladeer... Is that someone's name? 'Cuz it sounds like a nickname or something.
:'''(Traveler):''' (...)
:'''(Traveler):''' (If this is really happening... I need to know what else has changed.)
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, come with me.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 30.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm? Okay, sure! Where are we going?
:{{DIcon}} I want to go back to Inazuma.
:{{A|vo llzaq001 18 paimon 31.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Fine by Paimon, but... is everything okay? You're acting like this is an emergency.
:{{DIcon}} Now's not the time to explain...
:{{DIcon}} Let's get over there first.
