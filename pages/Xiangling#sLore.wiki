==Personality==
{{Quote|A renowned chef from Liyue. She's extremely passionate about cooking and excels at making her signature hot and spicy dishes.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}

Xiangling loves cooking, having learned the art from her father. She does not have a discerning eye towards a specific type of cuisine, seeing that food is a way to expand and experiment. She will use anything for her recipes, even unconventional ingredients that would gross out others. Some of the bizarre ingredients that Xiangling uses are slimes and lizards.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Tea Master Liu Su}}</ref> Even if some of the dishes are not to her liking, Xiangling will not give up and simply press on to modify or start over from scratch.

Her unconventional cooking is what led her to acclaim in both [[Mondstadt]] and [[Liyue]]. Unlike most cooks, Xiangling is not concerned about [[mora]], stating that food is to nourish and that the smiles on her customers' faces is more than enough for her. She dislikes having to limit herself to a specific style of cooking, seeing it as bland and unsurprising. Likewise, she prefers hands-on cooking, believing that automated cooking is inauthentic.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Xianyun|About Xingliang}}</ref>

Outside of cooking, Xiangling is easy to scare and is often pranked by [[Hu Tao]].<ref>{{Ref/VO|Hu Tao|About Xiangling}}</ref> Despite disliking her pranks, Xiangling does not have a grudge towards her because she occasionally brings her gifts in return for giving her a good laugh.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Xiangling|About Hu Tao}}</ref>

==Official Introduction==
{{Official Introduction
|title=A Chef with an Appetite for Adventure - Xiangling
|link=https://www.hoyolab.com/article/10270
|character=Xiangling}}
{{Quote|Never cook [[Silk Flower]] and [[Sweet Flower]] together! Turns out it's so sweet it'll give you toothache for three days straight...|A hard-earned pearl of wisdom from Xiangling's notebook}}

[[Liyue]] is home to two rival culinary traditions, conveniently named the "Li" and "Yue" styles. Foodies in Liyue are staunch supporters of one style or the other, and have long been embroiled in a bitter battle to prove the superiority of their style.

In this war waged by culinary snobs, ostentation is everything, flavor gets forgotten, and nothing is a simple matter of taste. Much to the consternation of Liyue's chefs, the Li vs. Yue debate eats up all of the region's rare cooking ingredients in the pursuit of ever-more-pretentious dishes.

Born into a restaurateur family, Xiangling inherited her fair share of this consternation. But she also chose to inherit the [[Wanmin Restaurant]] and become one of the few to push back against the status quo.

"Good food is good food, period!" Xiangling's mantra is an antidote to snobbery as she sets about creating her imaginative and unconventional dishes.

From a pinch of [[Mist Flower]] and a drop of [[Slime Condensate]] to a handful of unidentified flying insects and even [[hilichurls]]' wooden clubs, Xiangling is known to be somewhat adventurous with her choice of cooking ingredients.

Naturally, her unique approach leads to the occasional disastrous dish. But Xiangling never gives up, because of what her father has always said to her: "There are many secrets to cooking; the most important of which is passion."

I can make whatever you want, even if it's not on the menu!"</p><p>The workers at Wanmin Restaurant can recognize a regular, if not by their face, then by the first sentence out of their mouths.</p><p>A customer that orders without needing a menu has been at least a few times before.

Either the insides would become irreversibly charred from the heat of a [[Pyro Slime]], or cracks would appear due to flash-freezing from a [[Mist Flower]] &mdash; or, at some step in Xiangling's unconventional cooking process, a small-scale explosion would reduce it to scrap metal. After some heavy consideration on the part of [[Chef Mao|Xiangling's father]], he ultimately decided not to banish his daughter from the kitchen, despite the destruction she caused.</p><p>As reckless, imaginative, and uninhibited as she may be, it was exactly these traits that led her to create her most successful dishes. "Maybe this isn't so bad..." He tried to convince himself.</p><p>Suffice to say that payment for a new wok is a regular feature of the restaurant's monthly ledger.</p>

That line was written on the title page.</p><p>If she was any other person, she would likely have regarded it as some cheesy inspirational quote. However, Xiangling regarded it as a priceless treasure.</p><p>To her, her father only secured his footing in the forever-ongoing war between the [[Liuli Pavilion|Li]] and [[Xinyue Kiosk|Yue]] cuisines by upholding that principle.</p><p>However, at that time, the conflict between the two styles was white-hot, with many restaurants feeling the pressure that arose from it. Wanmin Restaurant was no exception.</p><p>"Good food is good food, period!"</p><p>The monopoly on luxurious ingredients such as [[matsutake]] and [[crab]]s infuriated Xiangling, her angry response to which was to take over in the kitchen.</p><p>It was time for her to build upon the foundation her father gave her and make some changes.</p><p>"I'm gonna make super-delicious dishes out of any ingredient!"</p>

She stumbled into a cave, and came across a strange shrine.</p><p>So she sat down by the shrine, and took out two pieces of [[Chili-Mince Cornbread Buns|spicy cornbread]].</p><p>She gobbled down one, but left the other one on the shrine, intending to eat a little later, but then promptly fell asleep.</p><p>When she woke up, the other spicy cornbread was gone and a mysterious creature was sitting in front of her, staring.</p><p>"Was it good?"</p><p>It nodded.</p><p>"More?" She took out some jerky from her backpack.</p><p>The mysterious creature nodded once again.</p><p>This was how Xiangling made a new friend.

She also created what became the signature dish of Wanmin Restaurant: [[Black-Back Perch Stew]], which combines the richness, color and strong flavors of Li cuisine with the fresh aromas and nutritional content of Yue cuisine.</p><p>Some have tried to copy her recipes, but try as they might they can never quite reproduce the way her cooking tastes.</p><p>"Braise fresh Violetgrass overnight. Dry, then grind to a fine powder. Sprinkle into any dish for an aromatic boost."</p><p>This is one of Xiangling's secret recipes, arrived at through a painstaking process of trial and error.</p><p>In Xiangling's case, that means countless bouts of diarrhea, countless bruised knees bashed on rocky cliffs, and countless wasted potfuls of food that didn't quite turn out as expected.</p>

I think lizards should just be stone-grilled in future."</p><p>"Slime fried rice is also rather ordinary. Maybe we'll try putting mushrooms in a slime {{Not a Typo|jus}} next time."</p><p>Though her friends fell around her during the epic battles with the taste of her dishes and advised her to turn back, Xiangling never stopped thinking about how to turn these "special" ingredients into delicious food.</p><p>In Xiangling's innocent and persistent heart, as long as they were not poisonous, there were no good or bad ingredients.</p><p>Her Vision, after all, proves that even the gods approve of such thinking.</p>

==Trivia==
* The "master" that Xiangling refers to in her [[Xiangling/Voice-Overs|voice-overs]] is [[Madame Ping]], whom Xiangling reveals is her master during the {{Quest|One for the Foodies, Two for the Show}}.
* Between Xiangling's fifth character story and [[Zhongli]]'s dialogue in the Stone Harbor Treasure Journal event, the addition of Violetgrass to Black-Back Perch Stew is Xiangling's secret touch that not even her father knows about, judging by his expression in the corresponding illustration during the event.
* Based on Xiangling's appearance in [https://youtu.be/CvCzYbVei04 Zhongli's Character Tale], set shortly before the {{Quest|Of the Land Amidst Monoliths}}, she returned to Liyue sometime after {{Quest|Mondstadt Gastronomy Trip}}, but likely left some time before the [[Traveler]] arrives. Her "as yet-unnamed Springvale Boar dish" is likely the dish she used to beat [[Brook]] during the cooking competition in [[Springvale]].
* Xiangling's side portrait (seen on the Character menu and Inventory) used to differ in design from her official art and in-game model: she had a headband, the bow under her braids was located higher up on her head, and the collar of her outfit was primarily yellow instead of black. It was then fixed in 1.4.
* Xiangling is the first character with a Story Quest that takes place outside of her associated region, taking place in [[Mondstadt]] while she hails from Liyue. As part of the quest, however, the Traveler travels to the border between Mondstadt and Liyue to collect some [[Jueyun Chili]].
* Xiangling is the first [[Character|playable character]] to appear in a [[Commission]] (''[[The Gourmet Supremos: Breakthrough Thinking]]'').
* In Xiangling's wish art, she is seen wielding [[White Tassel]], but in her portrait, she is holding an unknown polearm, and uses [[Dragon's Bane]] in her [https://youtu.be/TvqGRUWm8qE official Character Demo].
* {{Furnishing Mentions|Xiangling}}
* Xiangling shares her Chinese voice actress, Xiao N, with [[Kamisato Ayaka]].
* Xiangling shares her Korean voice actress, Yun A-yeong, with [[Barbara]].

===Etymology===
* Xiangling's Chinese name, {{zh|{{wt|香||Chinese}}{{wt|菱||Chinese}}|Xiānglíng}}, means "Fragrant Water Caltrop."
** She shares her name with a {{w|Xiangling (character)|literary character}} from the {{w|Dream of the Red Chamber}} ({{zh|s=红楼梦|t=紅樓夢}}), one of China's "Four Great Classical Novels" which was written in the 18th century. However, there is currently no known relation between the literary character and the ''Genshin Impact'' character.
* Her constellation, {{wt|trulla|Trulla|Latin}}, is the Latin word for "little ladle."
** Her constellation name was previously "Ladle" (written in English), but was corrected in a later version.
* [[Guoba]] ({{zh|s=锅巴|t=鍋巴|rm=Guōbā}}) means "{{w|:Scorched rice#China|scorched rice}}," which is the crust of rice formed in the cooking pot.
* She is one of the few people from Liyue whose Japanese name is directly transcribed from Chinese instead of being read as the ''on'yomi'' or ''kun'yomi'' reading.
