'''The Abyss''', also known as the '''Void Realm''', is a term which refers to four interconnected concepts:
# As the Void Realm, it is one of the three [[realm]]s in the world of [[Teyvat]], alongside the [[Human Realm]] and the [[Light Realm]]. While the Human Realm and Light Realms are capable of adjusting to accommodate each other's existences, the Void Realm is devastating to both.<ref name="pieceAerosid">{{Ref/Item|Piece of Aerosiderite}}</ref><ref name="chunkAerosid">{{Ref/Item|Chunk of Aerosiderite}}</ref><ref name="3Realms-1">{{Ref/Quest|Three Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve}}</ref>

# An entity, apparently the will of the Abyss itself, which has spurred the [[Abyss Order]]'s goal of overturning [[Celestia]] and ravaging [[Teyvat]],<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Abyss Order|quote=Driven on by the Abyss, they covet the lives of those who live on the surface [...]}}</ref> and is addressed by the [[Kitsune Saiguu]] during her death.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Hakushin Ring|Lore|quote="So then, the dark will that gnaws at me..."}}</ref>
# Creatures that are endemic to the Abyss, such as [[Riftwolves]].

==Overview==
The Abyss' "unworldly" power is diametrically opposed to the Light Realm's and can corrupt entities from the Human Realm, which are under [[Celestia]]'s dominion. The Void Realm's dark currents are analogous to the Human Realm's [[Ley Lines]] and the Light Realm's elemental currents. Its darkness is extremely harmful towards elemental beings such as Vishaps and elemental dragons, although they are capable of repelling the darkness by harnessing the Light Realm's power.<ref name="3Realms-1" />

The Abyss' darkness is described as the only kind of power that could dye [[Morax]]'s stone pillars black.<ref name="pieceAerosid" /> [[Venti]], another [[Archon]], was poisoned by [[Durin]]'s abyss-laced blood when his attempt to connect with [[Dvalin]] was interrupted by the [[Traveler]]; only by visiting the [[Symbol of Mondstadt's Hero]] at [[Windrise]] could Venti expunge the abyssal poison from himself.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Let the Wind Lead (Quest)}}</ref> The rest of Durin's blood was spilt in [[Dragonspine]], where it crystallized into [[Crimson Agate]], a substance capable of reviving the [[Frostbearing Tree]], which died thousands of years ago after the [[Skyfrost Nail]] dropped from Celestia. Previous attempts to revive the tree failed, indicating that Durin's blood had special properties.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Frostbearer|Lore}}</ref>

Prolonged exposure to the Abyss can drastically change a person's personality<ref>{{Ref/CS|Tartaglia|5}}</ref> or corrupt their entire being.<ref name="Mask of the Kijin" /><ref>{{Ref/Arti|Shaft of Remembrance|quote=He will eventually return to me, even if he were to be [...] turned into a fierce beast by that dark defilement...}}</ref> The Abyss appears to be attracted to &mdash; and draws in &mdash; those with great ambition, such as [[Gold]] and Tartaglia. Those who have personal ties to the Abyss have been known to gain an uncanny ability to wreak havoc and conflict.<ref name="tart4" /><ref name="BreezeFor">{{Ref/Book|Breeze Amidst the Forest|1}}</ref> Tsumi believes that the Abyss Order finds the Void Realm's power addictive.<ref name="3Realms-1" />

Denizens of the Abyss appear to use an [[Languages#Enochian-Based Language|Enochian-based language]], based on the text that can be seen above [[Abyss Mages]]' heads when talking to [[hilichurls]] and in their [[Adventurer Handbook]] description. Abyss monsters also have the ability to manipulate elemental energy without the use of [[Vision]]s.

Time in the Abyss passes differently than it does in Teyvat; [[Tartaglia]] spent three months in there, but returned to a Teyvat that had only seen three days pass since his disappearance.<ref name="tart4" /> When [[Takamine the Mistsplitter]] finally emerged from the Abyss, a long time had passed on Teyvat and [[Asase Hibiki]] was "no longer young."<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Thundering Pulse|Lore}}</ref> It is unclear whether this time scale disparity is consistent, or if it can change depending on certain factors.

The following monsters have been affiliated with the Abyss, although they have not necessarily been linked to the Abyss Order:
*The "beast of sin" which corrupted [[Chiyo]].<ref name="Mask of the Kijin" />
*An unknown "sinner" which inspired [[Chlothar]] to form the Abyss Order.

==Abyss Order==
{{main|Abyss Order}}
The Abyss Order is an organization comprised mostly of non-human beings that harness both the elements and abyssal power, seeking to ruin Teyvat as retaliation for the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago. Its members are former citizens of Khaenri'ah who were transformed into monsters through a yet unclear process. After being separated by the [[Unknown God]], the [[Traveler's Sibling]] has also become the leader of the Abyss Order. The Abyss Order usually conscripts [[Hilichurls]] to do their work.

==Story==
===Ancient History===
According to legend, before the [[Primordial One]] descended on the world, the elemental Light Realm and the abyssal Void Realm existed in diametric opposition to each other. The Primordial One created the Human Realm after defeating the [[Seven Sovereigns]] of the Light Realm, subjugating both nature and those of the Light Realm who hadn't escaped into the ocean.<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2|title=Before Sun and Moon}}</ref><ref name="LS:Light Realm">{{Ref/Loading|Light Realm}}</ref>

During the war between the Primordial One and the [[Second Who Came]], the region of [[Enkanomiya]] fell into the ocean depths, where the forces of the Light Realm and the Void Realm already existed. With the addition of a Human Realm aspect, the Vishaps who had fled into the oceans grew hostile towards the stranded people and were only fended off through the creation of the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]] and later, the intervention of the god [[Orobashi]]. The people of Enkanomiya built the Towers of the Three Realms to regulate the powers of the Human Realm, Light Realm, and Void Realm. These towers, known as [[Kunado's Locus]], [[Yachimatahiko's Locus]], and [[Yachimatahime's Locus]], were hidden using techniques only known by shrine maidens and the Vassals of Watatsumi.<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|3|title=Hydrological Studies in Byakuyakoku}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Three Great Martial Trials}}</ref>

===The Cataclysm===
Five hundred years ago, during the [[cataclysm]], the fall of [[Khaenri'ah]]'s [[Eclipse Dynasty]] came at the hands of the gods. The "great sinner" [[Rhinedottir]], also known as Gold, created an enormous amount of monsters containing abyssal power. These monsters proceeded to ravage Teyvat, causing widespread destruction.<ref name="chunkAerosid" /><ref name="BreezeFor" /> It is unclear whether the gods' attack on Khaenri'ah came before or after her actions, but the two events are inextricably linked. Following the gods' attack on Khaenri'ah, some of the people of Khaenri'ah were transformed into monsters through a curse. [[Dainsleif]], despite being a royal guard of Khaenri'ah who was cursed with immortality himself, somehow was not converted into an Abyss monster and instead opposes the Abyss Order.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Soul Set Apart}}</ref>

===Present===
When [[Tartaglia]] was fourteen, he ran away from home, and after falling into a deep hole, he found himself in the Abyss. There, he encountered a swordswoman,<ref name="tart4" /> likely the one named [[Skirk]],<ref name="tartvl">{{Ref/VO|Tartaglia|About Skirk}}</ref> who trained him, taught him to navigate the Abyss, and nurtured his ability to raise endless conflict no matter where he went.<ref name="tart4" />

After the Traveler retrieves the [[Bloodbranch Coral]] so [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]] could perform the [[Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri]], a ritual used to reverse Watatsumi Island's Holy Soil phenomenon. However, unexpectedly, the phenomenon failed to reverse and merely halted. Concerned, the Divine Priestess sent a team to investigate, only to discover that Enkanomiya was shrouded in a mysterious darkness.<ref name="3Realms-1" /> This darkness turned out to be the encroachment of the Void Realm, instigated by [[Enjou]], who convinced the Bathysmal Vishaps to disrupt the Towers of the Three Realms in favor of the Void Realm. The vishaps, eager to overthrow human presence, complied, only to discover that they were even more susceptible to abyssal power. [[Tsumi]] went to the Watatsumi troops in the guise of a shrine maiden to aid in repelling the Void Realm, rescue the vishaps trapped under the Dainichi Mikoshi, and perhaps even destroy the tower. Although she succeeds in her former two goals, she ultimately finds herself unable to carry through with her last objective.<ref name="3Realms-4">{{Ref/Quest|Three Realms Gateway Offering: Aftermath}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*Currently, there are no Abyssal monsters that utilize {{Dendro}}.
**In addition, they are the only faction that solely comprises of either Elite Enemies or bosses.

===Etymology===
*In both English and Chinese, the term {{Lang|"abyss"|zh=深渊|zh_rm=Shēnyuān|zh_lit=deep abyss}}, can refer to a literal bottomless (or unfathomably deep) pit, or used in a figurative sense to refer to a catastrophic or destructive situation.<ref>Wiktionary: {{zh|{{wt|深淵|深渊|Chinese}}}}</ref><ref>Wiktionary: {{wt|abyss||English}}</ref><ref>Cambridge Dictionary: [https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/abyss abyss] (Definition 2)</ref>
*The Chinese name for the Void Realm is {{zh|虚无界}}, which is similar to but distinct from the "Void" used in ''[[The Byakuyakoku Collection#Vol. 4|Bathysmal Vishap Experimental Records]]'', which is {{zh|虚空}}. As adjectives, both can mean "empty" or "void," but as nouns, {{zh|{{wt|虛無|虚无|Chinese}}}} means "nothingness" whereas {{zh|{{wt|虛空||Chinese}}}} means "empty space" or "sky."
