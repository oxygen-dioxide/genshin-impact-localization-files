'''Crystal Marrow''' is a [[Local Specialty]] of [[Inazuma]] found on [[Yashiori Island]] and [[Tatarasuna]].

==How to Obtain==
Crystal Marrow is found on [[Orobashi]]'s bones on Yashiori Island; a few can also be found on Tatarasuna, at sea level west of [[Mikage Furnace]]. Unlike other ores, Crystal Marrow does not need to be broken to be collected and can be harvested directly.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A crystal that contains a sliver of [[Tatarigami]] power. Adding this material during smelting will greatly increase the strength and toughness of metals.<br>In Inazuma, "Tatarigami" refers to the corpse of a [[god|divine being]] and the strange phenomena it creates. They say that before the god that created Crystal Marrow became the Tatarigami, it had many names, one of which was "[[Orobashi no Mikoto]]." Orobashi no Mikoto's body was as long as the winding seashore, and its voice was so resounding that only the [[Dark Sea]] could absorb it. Yet in the end, it too was cut down together with [[Yashiori Island]] itself.}}

==Trivia==
*Crystal Marrow is a product of the [[Tatarigami]] power radiating from Orobashi's remnants on Yashiori Island, and is one of the materials used for the production of [[Jade Steel]] in [[Mikage Furnace]], hence why a certain amount is present west of the Furnace.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Tatara Tales: Purification Device}}</ref>
**The Crystal Marrow can be seen to be energizing the stream of water next to it, turning it into [[Electrified Water]].
* [[Xavier]] explains Crystal Marrow as being an inert form of Tatarigami energy.
*Crystal Marrow was used for the creation of [[Delusions]] in Inazuma, and could be found in the [[Delusion Factory]].
*When the Traveler first arrived in Inazuma, the president of the International Trade Association, [[Kurisu]], revealed that the [[Kanjou Commission]] had passed a tax decree forcing the merchants to pay taxes using Crystal Marrow instead of Mora. After collecting the taxes, the Crystal Marrow would then be sold back to the merchants at a much higher price.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Confessions of an Outlander}}</ref>
*Crystal Marrow is similar in composition to the bony carapace that grows on the bodies of [[Consecrated Beasts]], who have consumed powerful beings such as gods.<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Consecrated Flying Serpent}}</ref>
