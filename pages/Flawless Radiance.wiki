==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Ayaka's hair is tied in a high ponytail by a black armored headdress accented with gold. The chin-length locks of hair framing her face are tied at ear-level with white accessories bordered with gold and fastened with bright pink cords tied in cloverleaf knots.

Ayaka wears a royal blue pleated knee-length skirt embroidered with an assortment of patterns, bearing gold accents and small white flower print with a pair of white shorts with a lace trim at the base underneath, and black geta sandals with ankle-length white socks decorated by pink cloverleaf knots at the back. She has a black breastplate with a golden [[Kamisato Clan]] emblem in the center and matching armor platings on the sides of her skirt. Underneath her breastplate is a loose elbow-length shirt with gradients of blue to white. Her cuffs and collar on her top are navy with a variety of gold stripes. She wears black sleeves underneath the loose shirt, sling over her middle fingers, and covering both of her thumbs. On top of her black sleeves are white armored platings lined by gold metal, tied together by red knots. At the back of her outfit is a large royal blue bow, tied together by her [[Vision]] and another bright pink cloverleaf knot. The lower half of the ribbons darken in color with gold markings of the same type seen throughout Inazuma.

She also carries around a gold-navy fan that matches her skirt. The fan is seen in one of her idle animations.
