==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Tejima is a samurai who is also a [[Vision]] bearer. In his youth, he was in a relationship with an unknown woman and the two promised to meet again at Konda Village, giving each other an omamori. However, the woman never came. Tejima would later have his Vision confiscated under the [[Vision Hunt Decree]]. With his original goal lost, he began to contemplate leaving Konda Village as a wandering samurai.

The [[Traveler]], who was sent by [[Kamisato Ayaka|Ayaka]] to persuade them to help resist the Shogun's cruel law, discovered Tejima arguing with an older couple, [[Mahiru]] and [[Kenjirou]] who were trying to persuade him not to leave. The Traveler offered to help refresh his memory and discovered that he was waiting at the village for his lover. With his memory refreshed, he decided to remain at the village for his former self's sake.

After the Traveler defeated [[Ei]], the Shogun abolished the Vision Hunt Decree and Tejima's Vision was returned to him. Fully remembering what he had forgotten, he thanked the Traveler for restoring him to his former self. He also expressed an intent to leave the village and go look for her if he could not wait any longer.

==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before completing The Meaning of Meaningless Waiting)
:'''Tejima:''' *sigh* I've circled the village over and over again... I still can't remember anything...
:'''Tejima:''' Though the people and everything else here feel familiar... something seems to have gone missing ever since I've lost my Vision.
:{{DIcon}} What happened to your Vision?
::'''Tejima:''' I turned it in a long time ago... The people from the Tenryou Commission marched up to the village to inspect and confiscate when the Vision Hunt Decree was first announced. I heard that the people who refused to cooperate had a really bad time.
::'''Tejima:''' *sigh* I thought that I should just stay out of trouble. It wouldn't have been good to trouble the villagers...
::'''Tejima:''' It's just that... though I only turned the Vision in, I feel like something has gone missing from inside me too...
::{{DIcon}} Something from inside you?
::'''Tejima:''' Like... a kind of enthusiasm or obsession that I had. Maybe that was what has kept me in the village this entire time. But I can't remember any of it anymore...
::'''Tejima:''' Why did I come here? Why did I stay? What should I be doing right now? What should I do next?
::'''Tejima:''' Amnesia? No, I couldn't call it that. I know who I am and who everyone is here. I remember every road and everything I've done in the village. I haven't forgotten anything.
::'''Tejima:''' *sigh* It's just that... All of this feels like they've lost their meaning after I lost the Vision.
::'''Tejima:''' Never mind, go tend to your own business. I'm just rambling. I'll look around some more and give this some more thought...
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here?
::'''Tejima:''' Do you mean... before? Or now?
::'''Tejima:''' I helped out the villagers here and drove away [[Treasure Hoarders]] who were causing disturbances. Just little things that were within my power &mdash; nothing worth mentioning.
::'''Tejima:''' But I can still vaguely remember that I was waiting here in this village for something important...
::'''Tejima:''' It's just that I've almost completely forgotten what that was, so I have no idea why I stayed here...
::'''Tejima:''' *sigh* Oh well... There's no reason to stay if I can't remember the reason for it. I might as well leave and go look around.
::'''Tejima:''' How about you? You look to be an outlander. What brings you to Inazuma with the [[Sakoku Decree]] still in effect.
::{{DIcon}} I'm here to look for someone.
::'''Tejima:''' Inazuma has become quite a dangerous place. The person that you're searching for must be very important to you for you to be here right now...
::'''Tejima:''' You want to speak with the [[Ei|Almighty Shogun]]? Uh... that really isn't something ordinary villagers like us can help you with. I suggest you ask around in the city.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Tejima:''' Yea, I should be leaving as well... Goodbye.

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After completing The Meaning of Meaningless Waiting)
:'''Tejima:''' Oh, it's you. How have your travels been?
:'''Tejima:''' Same old, same old. Though I've been waiting for her for most of my life, I still can't remember her voice or her looks. Something's awfully wrong with my head...
:{{DIcon}} Don't beat yourself over this...
::'''Tejima:''' You know, that's the funny part. I can't even remember how she looks even though I loved her so much. And you'd think I would be sad.
::'''Tejima:''' But for me, forgetting someone is the same as having all thoughts of them severed. I can't feel anything for them{{sic}} I can't even think of them.
::'''Tejima:''' She's probably the one that's really sad, seeing as how I've completely forgotten about her...
::'''Tejima:''' Still, thanks for retrieving those journals. Even though I still have no recollection of her, it's good to know that I was once so determined.
::'''Tejima:''' I will continue to wait here for her. The me from before wouldn't have wanted to let her down...
:{{DIcon}} So, any more thoughts about the Vision Hunt Decree?
::'''Tejima:''' When Lord Kujou came to collect our Visions, he said that this was a necessary step to achieve Eternity.
::'''Tejima:''' I don't really understand these grand ideals... I'm just an ordinary person. But I guess Eternity is something that never changes.
::'''Tejima:''' Something that never changes... I feel like I'm very close to becoming something like that...
::'''Tejima:''' My heart is like stagnant water due to the lack of drive and ambition. I can't feel sadness or happiness. It's like I'm dead inside...
::'''Tejima:''' I'm not sure if this is a good or bad thing. All I can do now is to accept it as my way of life.
::'''Tejima:''' Maybe something will change again if more extraordinary events occur... You know, such as your appearing in our village.
:{{DIcon}} I wish you good luck. See you again.
::'''Tejima:''' And good luck to you as well. We'll meet again!
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #3===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before completing Omnipresence Over Mortals)
:'''Tejima:''' I remember now. Now that I have my Vision back, I remember everything.
:'''Tejima:''' I agreed to meet her in Konda Village, and we gave each other an omamori as a sign of that agreement. That's why I've been here all this time.
:'''Tejima:''' I still remember that when we parted, I promised that I would wait for her forever, and that's how I came to be here. She must have done the same...
:{{DIcon}} Have you received any news of her?
::'''Tejima:''' Uh, not yet...
::'''Tejima:''' But I also wrote my experiences during the time when I had lost my Vision into my diary, just as I had before. When I meet her again, I'll share all of it with her.
::'''Tejima:''' I'll tell her about you too &mdash; about how you managed to reclaim my Vision... or should I say, reclaim "myself."
::'''Tejima:''' Haha... To be honest, I've only just begun to realize as well that the important thing is not the "wish" itself, but the "right to wish."
::'''Tejima:''' I thought that all I lost was everything concerning her, but in truth, I had also lost myself &mdash; the Tejima who waited, the Tejima who pursued.
::'''Tejima:''' If not for your help, I might well have spent the rest of my life wandering aimlessly about...
:{{DIcon}} What do you plan to do from here on out?
::'''Tejima:''' That's a good question, and it's time I made some detailed plans. If I cannot keep waiting for her, then perhaps I shall leave the village in search of her after all.
::'''Tejima:''' Before, I wanted to leave because I felt lost. But this time, I'm making a move because I'm sure of what my goals must be.
::'''Tejima:''' Well, I've spent most of my life waiting to no avail, so I might as well be pro-active from here on out! It's not too late for an old man like me to learn from the determination of the young, is it?
::'''Tejima:''' As long as I hold my wish dearly in my heart, I will not lose my way. That's what you've taught me, you know?
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I hope all goes well with you.
:::'''Tejima:''' I hope so too.
:::'''Tejima:''' As for you? Are you going to continue traveling?
:::'''Tejima:''' If so, please take these. These are some experiences from when I was younger that I've written down. Nothing would make me happier than if they could be of use to you.
::;(Obtain [[Hero's Wit]] ×2)
:{{DIcon}} All the best to you. See you.
::'''Tejima:''' See you, youngster. I hope that we will both find the person we are seeking.
