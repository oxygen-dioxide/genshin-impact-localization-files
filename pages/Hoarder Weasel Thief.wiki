{{Description|Thieves that come and go like the wind, though they only do so out of pure instinct.<br />Weasel Thieves with a luxurious purse on their backs. As elders among their kind, their ability to find treasure and avoid pursuit is even greater. Sometimes, they will even teach tricks of the trade to younger weasel thieves. As more experienced thieves, the amount of Mora they have collected is also greater.<br />That said, you've plundered their purses before, and they're not all that loaded either...|in-game description from the [[Archive]]}}
