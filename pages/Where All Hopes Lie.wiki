==Steps==
This quest begins in the Quest Domain [[On the Path to War]].
# Go to where "[[Gosoythoth]]" is
# Defeat "Gosoythoth"
#* {{Enemy|Lord of Eroded Primal Fire|text=Gosoythoth &mdash; Dragon of Manifest Erosion}}
# Continue "your" journey<!-- Switch to Mavuika POV -->
# Defeat "Gosoythoth"
#* {{Enemy|Lord of Eroded Primal Fire|text=Gosoythoth &mdash; Dragon of Manifest Erosion}}

==Gameplay Notes==
* During step 1, the active party will be limited to the Traveler.
* During step 2, the active party will be limited to a trial Traveler (Pyro).
** The fight will automatically end after some time or if Lord of Eroded Primal Fire's health reaches 85%.
** The Traveler (Pyro) will be given all six [[Constellation]]s, which are tailored for the quest fight.
* During step 3, the active party will be limited to Mavuika.
* During step 4, the active party will be limited to a trial Traveler (Pyro) and Mavuika.
** Lord of Eroded Primal Fire's '''Starscourge''' attack is played differently in the quest; after activating a pair of Nightsoul totems, a short cutscene occurs before players must aim at the boss with a powerful attack.
* If the player leaves the Quest Domain, they can re-enter by selecting "Go to where 'Gosoythoth' is" at the center of the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame|Stadium]].
* Completing this quest grants the {{Achievement|Memory of Fire}}.
