|description  = In days now long forgotten, the ancestors of Chenyu Vale's people called this place the Hanging Gardens, with only their chosen shamans having the right to ascend to this place to listen to the teachings of the heavens and bring a blessing like that of the moon to the bountiful mountain plains. These ancient rituals have long since ceased, but the spirit veins of Chenyu Vale still gather in this place. Whosoever controls Chiwang Terrace may yet have the power to reshape the water and soil in this land in an instant...

'''Chiwang Terrace''' is a [[Quest Domain]] during the {{Quest|An Ancient Sacrifice of Sacred Brocade}}.

==Walkthrough==
Calm [[Lingyuan]] down by defeating her in battle.

==Enemies==
* {{Enemy|Solitary Suanni|text=Lingyuan &mdash; Beastlord of the Sunken Jade Realm|x=1}}

==Ley Line Disorder==
*When Lingyuan changes the direction of the spirit veins, Miasmic Simulacra will be continuously generated. These Simulacra will deal continuous damage to nearby characters. When Lingyuan is gathering Hydro or Anemo adeptal energy, if there are any Miasmic Simulacra still present, Lingyuan will gather them all as well to power up that attack.
*Use adeptal energy to eliminate these Simulacra. If all Miasmic Simulacra are eliminated before Lingyuan gathers up adeptal energy, the spirit veins will be stabilized once more, reviving all party members and granting them the protection of the spirit veins for a short duration.
*While Spirit Vein's Protection is active, all party members' ATK will be increased and they will be continuously healed.
*Freeze Lingyuan while she is gathering Hydro adeptal energy and then use Shatter, Melt, or other Elemental Reactions to break the ice and briefly immobilize her.
*Attack Lingyuan with Elemental Type attacks that undergo Elemental Reactions with Anemo to break the Spiritwind Pearls she summons and gain the same immobilization effect.
