The '''Sanbugyou''' or {{Lang|'''Tri-Commission'''|ja={{Rubi|三|さん|奉|ぶ|行|ぎょう}}|ja_rm=San-bugyou|ja_tl=Three Commissioners}} is a collective term for three organizations which oversee every matter in [[Inazuma]].<ref name="A Path Through the Storm">{{Ref/Quest|A Path Through the Storm}}</ref> It is roughly equivalent to the [[Liyue Qixing]] and the [[Eight Trades]] in [[Liyue]],<ref name="A Path Through the Storm" /><ref group="Note">While the English text of [[Atsuko]] during ''[[A Path Through the Storm]]'' says it is equivalent to "the Eight Trades '''under''' the Liyue Qixing" (emphasis added), both the Chinese and Japanese equivalents of the line simply say "Qixing, Eight-Trades."</ref> as well as the [[Knights of Favonius]] in [[Mondstadt]].

The Tri-Commission meets together at [[Tenshukaku]] to decide on government affairs. In the Archon Quest ''[[A Flower Blooms in a Prison]]'', [[Kamisato Ayaka]] says that whenever the [[Yashiro Commission]] made a proposal to repeal the [[Vision Hunt Decree]], it was promptly vetoed by both the [[Tenryou Commission]] and the [[Kanjou Commission]]. This implies the existence of some sort of council or committee where proposals must pass through, and that the Yashiro Commission cannot present their proposal directly to the [[Raiden Shogun]]. This is similar to the {{Lang|Hyojoshu|ja=評定衆}}, the highest organ of government in the {{w|Tokugawa shogunate}}, which was a council comprised of the highest government officials and the bugyou.

==Trivia==
* The ''{{w|Tokugawa shogunate#San-bugyō|San-bugyou}}'' was a real group in the {{w|Tokugawa shogunate}}; it was comprised of the {{Lang|{{w|Jisha-bugyō|''jisha-bugyou''}}|ja=寺社奉行}}, {{Lang|{{w|Kanjō-bugyō|''kanjou-bugyou''}}|ja=勘定奉行}}, and {{Lang|{{w|Machi-bugyō|''machi-bugyou''}}|ja=町奉行}}, which oversaw temples and shrines, accounting, and cities, respectively. The jisha-bugyou was the highest in status, the kanjou-bugyou was second, and the machi-bugyou was last in status.
** There were also many other ''bugyou'' in the Tokugawa shogunate besides the three in the San-bugyou, but the three bugyou of the San-bugyou were considered the most prominent. For example, there was the {{Lang|''gaikoku-bugyou''|ja=外国奉行|ja_tl=foreign [affairs] commissioner}} which oversaw trade and diplomatic relations, and the {{Lang|''douchuu-bugyou''|ja=道中奉行|ja_tl=roadway commissioner}} which was in charge of all road-related affairs.
** The jisha, kanjou, and machi-bugyou seem to correspond respectively to the Yashiro, Kanjou, and Tenryou commissions in Genshin Impact. However, the commissions in Genshin Impact seem to take on the duties of multiple bugyou of the Tokugawa shogunate. For example, the Kanjou Commission seems to have the duties of both the kanjou-bugyou and the gaikoku-bugyou of the Tokugawa shogunate.
