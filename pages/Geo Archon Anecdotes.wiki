'''Geo Archon Anecdotes''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Stone Harbor's Nostalgia: Series I]]''. To complete this achievement, the player needs to collect all the stories about [[Rex Lapis]] in the daily commission ''[[Geo Travel Diary]]'' by giving [[Musheng]] all four types of items relating to [[Liyue]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* The four types of items which result in unique dialogue are as follows:
**{{Transclude|section=1|Geo Travel Diary|Geo Diary Items}}
* There are four [[Legend of the Geo Archon]] quest items that are given upon listening to each dialogue branch. However, each time the player gains a third "Legend of the Geo Archon" quest item, Musheng will remove two of them from the inventory. This does not affect progress towards earning the achievement, but the player should remember which dialogue branches were already listened to rather than relying on the quest items.
