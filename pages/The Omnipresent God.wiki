==Steps==
# Leave [[Tenshukaku]]
# Clash of [[Watatsumi Army|Rebels]]
# Talk to the [[Raiden Shogun]] within the [[Plane of Euthymia]]
# Defeat the Electro Archon
# Talk to the Raiden Shogun
# Talk to [[Paimon]]

==Notes==
* While walking away from Tenshukaku, players can control the camera, but they cannot control the [[Traveler]] aside from clearing the Traveler's headache.
* During the fight against the Raiden Shogun within the Plane of Euthymia:
** This fight is very similar to the fight during [[Amidst Stormy Judgment]].
** The Raiden Shogun is immune to {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
** At about 75% HP or when 3 party members are fallen, she will enact the [[Vision Hunt Decree]], preventing the use of [[Elemental Skill]] and [[Elemental Burst]] except for the Traveler's. This does not prematurely end existing effects from Skills and Bursts, nor does it prevent [[Passive Talents]] such as [[Jean]]'s [[Wind Companion]] from activating. About 40 seconds after this, a cutscene will begin.
** In the cutscene, the Traveler reveals the ambitions laid upon the [[Statue of the Omnipresent God]]:
*** The ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement "[[Their Wishes]]" is granted.
*** Four glowing orbs appear around the active character. Every time a party member falls, they will use one of the orbs and be automatically revived with full health.
*** All characters passively regenerate energy and have greatly increased damage.

:{{A|vo dqaq107 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The air feels suffocating... it must be the Raiden Shogun's almightiness...

:'''''Signora... is slain.'''''

:{{A|vo dqaq107 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' One strike from the Shogun, and now [[Signora]]'s gone...
:{{A|vo dqaq107 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She got what she deserved, but Paimon still can't help but feel upset.
:{{A|vo dqaq107 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why are they doing it... why are the [[Harbingers]] collecting all the [[Gnosis|Gnoses]]?
:;(The Traveler staves off a headache)
:{{A|vo dqaq107 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm? Traveler, you got a headache?
:{{A|vo dqaq107 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Chin up... let's get out of this place, Paimon feels... unsettled.

:'''''The Musou no Hitotachi...'''''

:{{A|vo dqaq107 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Also... when the Shogun executed Signora with the [[Musou no Hitotachi]]... it was unbelievably powerful...
:{{A|vo dqaq107 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It seems impossible to defend against... and if so, we've got no hope whatsoever of defeating her in combat...

:'''''Yae Miko's plan...'''''

:{{A|vo dqaq107 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So to recap, [[Yae Miko]] wants us to go back inside the Plane of Euthymia by the Statue of the Omnipresent God...
:{{A|vo dqaq107 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But... we'll be like lambs to the slaughter, won't we? M&mdash;Maybe we could put this plan on hold for a while...
:{{A|vo dqaq107 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's the sound of [[Electro]] zapping in the air... Paimon can barely breathe...
:;(The Traveler staves off another headache)
:{{A|vo dqaq107 1 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Traveler, are you okay? You're so silent...

:'''''It's so... noisy outside...'''''

:{{A|vo dqaq107 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It sounds like there's a lot of noise coming from outside Tenshukaku... has a fight broken out or something?
:{{A|vo dqaq107 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The guards seem really nervous... let's go see what the situation is, shall we?
----
{{Cutscene Description|You stumble out of Tenshukaku gloomily. By chance, the resistance forces have broken through the leaderless Shogunate troops, arriving beneath Tenshukaku. Having not met them in some time, you step forward, but just then, the Raiden Shogun appears behind you, unleashing her legendary Musou no Hitotachi. Just as it seems that divine punishment will be meted out, the [[Masterless Vision]] [[Kazuha]] carries crackles to life. Wielding his sword, he meets &mdash; and miraculously blocks &mdash; that strike head-on. Encouraged by his bravery, the resistance troops charge at the Raiden Shogun, and the [[Visions]] inlaid upon the [[Statue of the Omnipresent God]] glow in response to their former masters' courage. Yet you know that their valiant effort will not avail them against the Raiden Shogun and that this may yet be the moment to execute Yae Miko's plan, and so you turn to strike the Shogun. As expected, the Plane of Euthymia opens before you once more.}}
;(Cutscene starts)
:;(The Masterless Vision on Kazuha crackles and gains the Electro color and symbol)
::'''[[Kazuha's Friend]]:'''<ref>Twitter: [https://twitter.com/BWincklerVA/status/1433505053516705794 EN VA Self Announcement]</ref> "There will always be those who dare to brave the lightning's glow"

:;(The Masterless Vision lands on the ground still crackling, and its color fades away)
::'''Sanogonomiya Resistance Member:''' Charge!
::'''Gorou:''' Attack!

:;(The Visions in the Statue of the Omnipresent God light up)
::'''Paimon:''' What do we do!? They're no match for her!

:;(Ei comes down from a meditating position)
::'''Ei:''' So, we meet again
;(Cutscene ends)

;(Talk to the Raiden Shogun within the Plane of Euthymia)
:{{A|vo dqaq108 1 raidenei 01.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Indulge my curiosity. What is the reason that I find you standing here before me once again?
:{{A|vo dqaq108 1 raidenei 02.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Do you hope your foolhardiness will shelter those people? Or... was it simply a means of seeking an audience with me?
:{{DIcon}} The [[Fatui]] have deceived the Raiden Shogun.
:{{DIcon}} The Vision Hunt Decree should never have existed.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 1 raidenei 03.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Oh? Surely you didn't rouse me from my state of eternal meditation only to tell me this?
:{{A|vo dqaq108 1 raidenei 04.ogg}} '''Ei:''' If so, then you underestimate me. I am quite well-informed about the Vision Hunt Decree.
:{{DIcon}} You know everything that's going on outside?
:{{A|vo dqaq108 1 raidenei 05.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Not so. Only everything that pertains to eternity.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 1 raidenei 06.ogg}} '''Ei:''' The Vision Hunt Decree has my tacit approval.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 1 raidenei 07.ogg}} '''Ei:''' The Fatui's actions thus far do not constitute a threat to eternity, otherwise... they would have been purged long ago.
:{{DIcon}} But the Vision Hunt Decree is damaging.
:{{DIcon}} It comes at a great cost to the people of [[Inazuma]].
:{{A|vo dqaq108 1 raidenei 08.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Individual ambition is inherently incompatible with eternity.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 1 raidenei 09.ogg}} '''Ei:''' What you might not realize is that all too often... people have far more to lose by chasing their dreams.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 1 raidenei 10.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Consider this &mdash; no one will lose their life on account of having their Vision taken away...
:{{A|vo dqaq108 1 raidenei 11.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Rather, those who have lost their lives are the ones who insisted on pursuing their own aspirations, are they not?
:{{DIcon}} Teppei...
:{{A|vo dqaq108 1 raidenei 12.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Traveler, your existence is unique in my eyes.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 1 raidenei 13.ogg}} '''Ei:''' There seems to be limitless uncertainty in you. To put it another way, you are the furthest thing from eternity.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 1 raidenei 14.ogg}} '''Ei:''' So I won't insist that you comprehend the meaning of my actions. What matters is that I tread the path of eternity on my people's behalf.
:{{DIcon}} This is your Plane of Euthymia...
::{{DIcon}} It is created by your consciousness, yes?
:{{A|vo dqaq108 1 raidenei 15.ogg}} '''Ei:''' That's right. I'm surprised you understand it so well...
:{{A|vo dqaq108 1 raidenei 16.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Anyway. You're looking for a chance to shake my will... aren't you?
:{{DIcon}} I'm not here to debate your ideas.
::{{DIcon}} I'm here to demolish them.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 1 raidenei 17.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...
:{{A|vo dqaq108 1 raidenei 18.ogg}} '''Ei:''' So be it. Well then, you who would defy eternity... Time for you to enlighten me.
----

;(Upon the start of the battle, one of the following lines is said)
::{{A|vo monster raidenshogun tachi battle 01.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Do you wish to become the enemy of Eternity, Traveler?
::{{A|vo monster raidenshogun tachi battle 02.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Your arrival has brought a deafening static.
::{{A|vo monster raidenshogun tachi battle 03.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Excessive yearning leads to inevitable destruction.

;(At around 75% HP or when 3 party members are fallen)
:The Vision Hunt Decree is in force once more... But a way to {{Color|buzz|turn things around}} may yet appear before those willing to resist...

;(Around 40 seconds later, a cinematic begins)
:;(The Traveler runs in to attack Raiden, but this time the Traveler does not fall)
:;(The Traveler notices the [[Grand Narukami Shrine Omamori (Blind Loyalty, Reckless Courage)|Grand Narukami Shrine Omamori]] they received from Yae Miko is sparkling)
:;(Suddenly, Yae Miko appears)
:'''Yae Miko:''' Dear me
:'''Yae Miko:''' Aren't you cutting it rather close?
:'''Ei:''' Miko
:'''Ei:''' This was your doing...?
:'''Yae Miko:''' Now, now
:'''Yae Miko:''' Don't forget who taught you
:'''Yae Miko:''' How to place your consciousness in objects
:'''Yae Miko:''' Surely you don't think
:'''Yae Miko:''' Your ambition alone
:'''Yae Miko:''' Is enough to shake [[Ei]]'s will? Do you?
:'''Yae Miko:''' Though you alone are here
:'''Yae Miko:''' They too have ambitions
:'''Yae Miko:''' Which they long since entrusted to you
:'''Yae Miko:''' Now then
:'''Yae Miko:''' Close your eyes
;(The Traveler closes their eyes)
:;(The people's ambitions begin to shine through into the Plane of Euthymia and illuminates the realm)
:;([[Teppei]], in a flash, appears briefly in the position of the Traveler)
:;(The Traveler is imbued with a golden aura as the Traveler takes on the ambitions of the people)

:'''''Abolish the Vision Hunt Decree'''''

:;(The Electro Archon smiles and the fight resumes)
----
;(Upon defeating the Raiden Shogun)
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 01.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' You've lost, Ei.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 raidenei 01.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 raidenei 02.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...Yes, I have.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 02.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Why can you not trust your people, and in the power of their ambitions?
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 03.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' These ambitions have transcended space and time. They are something that no one can snuff out.
:{{DIcon}} When people move forward with all their might...
::{{DIcon}} They can surpass the gods' expectations.
::{{DIcon}} And even take over the work of the gods.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 04.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Is this the lesson you learned from your journey in Liyue?
:{{DIcon}} Yes.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 05.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' There are nations where humans cast their god aside and stride forward...?
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 06.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' So, are we to just abandon the notion of progress... for the sake of wishful thinking?
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 raidenei 03.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...You and I have both witnessed the great loss that progress can bring.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 raidenei 04.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Eternity... eternity is the only way...

;(A [[#cutscene|cutscene]] begins)
{{Cutscene Description|Ei explains her past and the origin of her pursuit of Eternity. She was once a kagemusha who followed the [[Makoto|previous Shogun]], in whom she trusted. But each instance of progress came alongside loss, until at last, even the previous Shogun ceased to be. Ei thus turned away from "transience," which the previous Shogun had believed in, seeing "eternity" as the path that Inazuma should take instead.}}
:'''Ei:''' When lightning flashes, it casts a shadow
:'''Ei:''' My name means shadow
:'''Ei:''' With my blade, I purged all obstacles to progress
:'''Ei:''' And yet... something was lost
:'''Ei:''' With each step forward
:'''Ei:''' In the end, I even lost her
:'''Ei:''' The tales are still retold
:'''Ei:''' In the shade of every Thunder Sakura
:'''Ei:''' But the wounds left on our nation by that terrible loss
:'''Ei:''' Still ache
:'''Ei:''' "Never stop searching, even if only for a brief flash of light"
:'''Ei:''' "If nothing else, we have the present moment"
:'''Ei:''' She said that once
:'''Ei:''' But I've seen [[Khaenri'ah|a nation]] stride forward
:'''Ei:''' And lose everything to the [[Heavenly Principles]]
:'''Ei:''' Perhaps only if time stands still
:'''Ei:''' Will the lightning's glow never fade
:'''Ei:''' The present moment is a fragile illusion
:'''Ei:''' Only Eternity can bring us closer to the Heavenly Principles
:'''Ei:''' I am no longer the shadow
:'''Ei:''' "Mine is the most supreme and noble form"
:'''Ei:''' "Let power over the realm be vested in me"
:'''Ei:''' "In this form shall I honor my subjects' dream"
:'''Ei:''' "For a land of Eternity, unchanging forevermore"

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 07.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' The Heavenly Principles... irrelevant nonsense as far as I am concerned.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 08.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' When all's said and done, all you really want is to protect your beloved Inazuma, forever and ever. Isn't that right?
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 raidenei 05.ogg}} '''Ei:''' That would be something of an oversimplification.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 09.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' But is this nation worth existing for eternity?
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 10.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Stripped of ambitions, stripped of the potential for change, it does nothing more than simply... exist. It is a hollow shell of a nation.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 11.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Huh. I wonder what loss would it really be to anyone if such a nation were destroyed?
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 raidenei 06.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Miko, retract your words.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 raidenei 07.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Never-changing eternity is the promise I made to my people.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 12.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' But what your people need from you is not your promises. They want your attention... your divine gaze.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 raidenei 08.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...You mean Visions?
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 raidenei 09.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Humans have a lifespan of barely a hundred years. They cannot afford to bear any extra losses.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 raidenei 10.ogg}} '''Ei:''' But I have experienced it all. That is why I have chosen to guide them along the correct path toward eternity.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 13.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' *sigh*...
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 14.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' But eternity is far too cruel a fate for you, Ei.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 raidenei 11.ogg}} '''Ei:''' For me?
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 15.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Not only have you stopped paying attention to the world, but you have stopped paying attention to yourself.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 16.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' It must have been terribly lonely here, all alone, for centuries on end.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 raidenei 12.ogg}} '''Ei:''' But it is necessary...
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 17.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' You will miss much by refusing progress... You seek to prevent loss, but have you considered all you are losing by remaining here in stasis for all eternity?
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 18.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' You are obviously lonely, and yet for the sake of eternity you choose to stretch your loneliness out to infinity...
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 19.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Tell me this. Why is the sky here that was once so dark glowing again? Why now?
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 20.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' This is your Plane of Euthymia. It's your inner world.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 21.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' So it can only mean... that you are happy to see me again. You have found the loneliness here unbearable for a long time now, haven't you?
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 raidenei 13.ogg}} '''Ei:''' I... have nothing to say to that.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 22.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Hehehe, oh, but I have so much to say to you. Let me tell you all that has happened over the last few centuries.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 raidenei 14.ogg}} '''Ei:''' How long will that take?
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 23.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' As a fox envoy, I have an excellent memory. I recall every detail of the last few centuries with perfect clarity.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 24.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' So it will probably take me another few centuries to relay it to you.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 raidenei 15.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Heh... hehe... Miko, I never thought I would have the chance to meet with you like this again.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 raidenei 16.ogg}} '''Ei:''' *sigh* Seeing you again is a change to eternity... and a very nice surprise.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 25.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Hehe, since you are willing to admit that, I suppose that means we can still be friends?
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 raidenei 17.ogg}} '''Ei:''' What a childish conversation this is.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 raidenei 18.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Anyway. Now that I have been defeated by you and your plan, I will honor your wish to abolish the Vision Hunt Decree.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 raidenei 19.ogg}} '''Ei:''' But with regards to eternity and the question of whether this nation should move forward, I need time to give it some thought.
:{{A|vo dqaq108 2 yaemiko 26.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Hehe, you are the one who's been acting like a child from the very beginning.

;(A cinematic begins)
{{Cutscene Description|Finally, the people's wishes penetrated the Raiden Shogun's locked heart. As promised, she abolished the Vision Hunt Decree. Beyond the Plane of Euthymia, she saw what Eternity means in the eyes of the world. Some ambitions have the power to heal wounds... bring victory... to inspire hope. But some ambitions will outlive their masters, long after their soul ascends. They remain as they were in the beginning, burning bright and true... for all eternity.}}

:{{A|vo dqaq109 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is the Vision Hunt Decree abolished?
:{{DIcon}} It was all thanks to Yae Miko.
:{{DIcon}} We conveyed the wishes of the people.
