You must've heard about [[Genius Invokation TCG]] here and there, right? As a fervent card player, I'm definitely not gonna miss it. See, I've already got myself a deck.

If you think about it, playing cards aren't easy at all &mdash; you gotta do the math before throwing the dice, and be extra careful with your every move. One step wrong, and the whole table is turned. When that happens, don't you think it's most amusing to watch your opponent's frustrated face, hmm?

Well, would you like to play a few rounds with me? I can divulge all my secret skills if you're interested. What do
you say?

I've ordered juice for you, and all that is lacking is my drinking buddy.
