|description    = A lofty stone with a consistent grain. A highly skilled craftsperson can sculpt stones like this into ornamental rock features that imitate rugged mountains. Giant rocks like this one are used at the foundations of [[Yujing Terrace]].<br />An urban legend holds that the lightning-fast [[Starward Sword|blade-work]] of the [[Keqing|Yuheng]] took 10 years of intense training to master and that one stage of this training involved hacking away at an Unmoving Kingstone until its surface was smooth and shiny like a mirror.
