==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Chubo:''' All I know is that selling tea isn't enough. I've still got to live...
:{{DIcon|Reward}} And you are...?
::'''Chubo:''' Oh? Outsiders, are you? Hello there, greetings!
::'''Chubo:''' As you can see, I'm just a plain fisherman, barely scraping by...
::'''Chubo:''' But I feel blessed to be able to fish in a place as pristine as Chenyu Vale.
::'''Chubo:''' If you like fishing too, I can recommend several good spots where you can catch tasty fish!
:;(Obtain {{Item|Fish|20|x=5}})
:{{DIcon}} Seems like you're worried about something?
::'''Chubo:''' Fewer and fewer people are fishing... Or to be precise, far fewer youths are willing to engage in agriculture nowadays.
::'''Chubo:''' Tea does bring in a lot of money, of course, but you can't just bite and eat Mora.
::'''Chubo:''' As far as I know, [[Qiaoying Village]]'s grain production is barely self-sufficient, but many other crops must be purchased from outside.
::'''Chubo:''' We're situated in the mountains, so if anything were to happen to the mountain path and stop the delivery of goods, now that be terrible news for us, wouldn't it?
::'''Chubo:''' What's more, youngsters nowadays are all busy learning how to grow and prepare tea.
::'''Chubo:''' It worries me terribly. Fewer and fewer fishermen like me, youngsters unwilling to take up grain production... Won't our local produce soon come to lack variety?
::{{DIcon}} You really care about everyone, don't you?
::'''Chubo:''' The people in our village are a good lot, and the tea they produce is precious. I can't stand to see good people and precious things suffer.
::'''Chubo:''' A place gains stability from the balance of its produce. I hope more youngsters will realize this...
::'''Chubo:''' And stop focusing on just growing and selling tea, but consider the future of the entire village.
::'''Chubo:''' I'll talk to Uncle Luo about my suggestions some other day...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Chubo:''' *sigh* What to do, what to do...
