{{Quest Description|The owner of the flower garden has encountered a small problem...}}

''Available before completing ''Hereafter...'' ''
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Trample the flowers the first time before speaking to Earnshaw, optional)
:{{Black Screen|You are chased out of the garden by the angry old man...}}
:'''???:''' Naughty children! What are you doing, breaking into my garden for no reason, and trampling my flowers?
:'''Paimon:''' S&mdash;Sorry! We didn't mean to... Wait, Paimon didn't trample any flowers! Paimon should say, {{Traveler}} didn't mean to!

;(Trample the flowers any subsequent time before speaking to Earnshaw, optional)
:{{Black Screen|You are chased out of the garden by the angry old man...}}
:'''???:''' You...
:'''Paimon:''' Aah... {{Traveler}}, you really should be more careful, you know...

;(Talk to ???)
:'''???:''' Villains... You recalcitrant villains! That's right, run, run far, far away! To the other side of the mountain, to the city alleys &mdash; and make sure I don't see you!
:'''Paimon:''' Wha... What's going on?
:'''???:''' Hmph. Nothing serious. Hero ran away again. It happens all the time &mdash; just say the word "inspection," and off Hero takes...
:'''???:''' This time, Prince and Princess fled too... Had I not tripped when taking care of the flower field previously, leaving me with a yet-unhealed leg injury, dealing with those three rascals would've been easy.
:'''???:''' Are you mountaineers? If you'd like a place to rest your feet, you can sit awhile in the house &mdash; I shall treat you in a bit once I have brought those three rapscallions back by their scruffs.
:{{DIcon}} Yes, and we have vowed to conquer every high peak in Teyvat.
::'''Paimon:''' Wait, we vowed that? Paimon definitely wasn't consulted!
:{{DIcon}} We're just passing through.
::'''Paimon:''' Yup, and we definitely wouldn't sidetrack from our original goal because "the mountain was just there" or something like that!
:'''Paimon:''' Well, let's introduce ourselves all the same! Paimon's Paimon, and {{MC|m=he|f=she}}'s {{Traveler}}. We're adventurers &mdash; and if you're looking for people, there's no one more experienced than us!
:'''Paimon:''' If your legs aren't feeling too good, leave the searching to us!
:'''???:''' Adventurers... Then why don't you wear those green uniforms?
:'''Paimon:''' Not everyone has to wear that outfit. Or rather, we're such experienced adventurers that we can just wear whatever we want.
:'''???:''' Hmm. I see. I suppose that the services of seasoned adventurers should also come with the requisite payment.
:'''Earnshaw:''' Alright then, good children, call me Earnshaw. I would be most grateful for your help.
:'''Paimon:''' So you're looking for... Hero, Prince, and Princess? These don't sound like normal names... Are these nicknames for kids?
:'''Earnshaw:''' They're dogs.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh.
:'''Paimon:''' Really? Th&mdash;They, uh, sound like... rather kiddy names?
:'''Earnshaw:''' My [[Agnes|daughter]] named them. If it was not for her raising hue and cry, I would not have raised such delicate creatures.
:'''Earnshaw:''' When they were still pups, they were quite silly and rather cute, but they quickly grew into disobedient little rascals. Try to control them a little, and ah, they resist and they flee.
:'''Earnshaw:''' They don't go very far, of course, but one does need to retrieve them all the same. Ah, for a "Hero" to fear something like a tooth inspection... What a joke.
:{{DIcon}} Won't they come back once they get hungry?
::'''Paimon:''' Or they might awaken the wild spirit in their blood, return to the mountain forests, and become apex predators! That would be a pretty cool story, wouldn't it?
:{{DIcon}} They will probably just play until sundown before returning.
::'''Paimon:''' Yes! there's no place like home, after all.
:'''Earnshaw:''' No, no, rules must remain rules. If we let them off once, they will do this a second and third time. And once they get used to doing ill, they will not change for the better easily.
:'''Paimon:''' But they're just little doggies, aren't they? Do we really have to be so strict with them?
:'''Earnshaw:''' Well, they do have a bad example to follow. That silly daughter of mine left home several years ago and hasn't returned. Well, if they had done exactly as she had, that would have saved me some time!
:'''Earnshaw:''' But if she were to return and find her precious dogs, whom she raised hell just to own, gone, she'd bawl for all she's worth... Even though this is all her fault, anyway.
:{{DIcon}} (Sounds like we've walked into a family issue.)
:{{DIcon}} (Best not to ask further.)
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, then... So we just need to bring them back home, right?
:'''Earnshaw:''' Yes. The forests are dangerous, and get even more so at night. Those dogs do not know how delicate they are. Even if they do not love it, they are safer in here.
:'''Earnshaw:''' Hero's run off to the north. For an old dog to still be so playful... Seriously...
:'''Earnshaw:''' It also likes pausing to forage for food along the path. Don't go easy on it. It'll get in real trouble if it eats something bad.
:'''Earnshaw:''' If it refuses to leave, harden your heart and {{color|buzzword|take the food it got from Archon-knows-where away}}. That should give it the signal that it's time to go home.
:'''Earnshaw:''' The other two haven't gone far. They're just mucking about in the flower garden. Just tell them to get back here, and that should do.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, this sounds simple. Just leave it to us! You just wait here, Earnshaw. We'll be right back.
:'''Earnshaw:''' {{color|buzzword|Careful about the flowers, by the way. Don't tread on them.}}
:'''Paimon:''' Gotcha, we will! {{color|buzzword|Don't tread on the flowers}}, right? Well, never mind Paimon, but {{Traveler}}'s pretty agile too.

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Paimon:''' We can't just grab those playful dogs and drag them back, right? They're pretty delicate, after all...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's just chase them, shall we? That should get 'em running &mdash; so we just need to {{color|buzzword|send them running in the direction of their home}}!

;(Talk to Earnshaw again, optional)
:'''Earnshaw:''' Good children, I'm relying on you to bring those three rapscallions back.

;(Trample the flowers, optional)
:{{Black Screen|Earnshaw brings you out of the garden...}}
:'''Earnshaw:''' You... *sigh* Don't ruin the flowers...
:'''Paimon:''' We didn't do it on purpose! B&mdash;Besides, the dogs did the same thing...
:'''Earnshaw:''' That's because they're naughty. You shouldn't learn from their bad examples.
:'''Paimon:''' Ohh...

;(Trample the flowers any subsequent time, optional)
:{{Black Screen|You are chased out of the garden by the angry old man...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Oh no, that's more flowers trampled... {{Traveler}}, we should slow down and really watch our steps!

;(Approach Hero)
:'''Paimon:''' Earnshaw said that Hero won't be moving when there's food around. Looks like that's true...
:'''Paimon:''' C'mon, let's {{color|buzzword|collect the Fowl here}} first! The dog probably won't leave otherwise.
:;(Pick up {{Item|Suspicious Fowl|x=3}})

;(Approach Prince)
:'''Paimon:''' Good doggie, playtime's over. Time to go home!

;(Approach Princess)
:'''Paimon:''' Here it is! Who would've thought it'd be hiding amidst the flowers? Well, since we don't want to trample over the flowers... we'll have to jump in from above, right?

;(Bring the first dog back to the kennel)
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, back home you go! And on to the next one.

;(Bring the second dog back to the kennel)
:'''Paimon:''' And don't go running off again! That leaves us with just one more.

;(Bring the third dog back to the kennel)
:'''Paimon:''' Nice! Now that they've all gone home, we're done here, right? Let's go look for Earnshaw.

;(Talk to Earnshaw after bringing all the dogs back)
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon thought that this would be easier... Who knew they'd be so capricious...
:'''Earnshaw:''' Well then, children, I hope you now understand that the more capricious they are, the more we need to teach them the rules.
:{{DIcon}} Well, we at least remembered not to tread on the flowers...
::'''Paimon:''' If only you could also fly, eh? That would've made things way easier.
:{{DIcon}} Looks like we need a few rules laid down just for you, Paimon.
::'''Paimon:''' Eh? C'mon, Paimon's not like that... Nor is she some kinda disobedient pet!
:'''Earnshaw:''' Well, if you're tired, rest here a while before going. Come, have some of this [[Tasses Ragout]] I just made while you're at it.
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, goodies! But... Oh, we shouldn't. This doesn't seem right.
:'''Earnshaw:''' Come now, do you not trust my skills? I would not speak for other dishes, but I'm very confident in my Ragout, at least.
:'''Paimon:''' No, no, Paimon's wondering if this would count as not following the rules or something...
:'''Earnshaw:''' Labor deserves a reward, so this is what you are owed for your efforts. You need to eat to keep your strength up, after all. And you are adventurers... so you'll need that energy all the more.
:'''Earnshaw:''' As for your payment for the official commission, I will give it to you later &mdash; I believe the Guild's rules indicate as much.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe! In that case, don't mind if we do!
:{{Black Screen|At the old man's invitation, the two of you enjoy some Ragout. While it is not exactly a masterpiece, it warms the soul nonetheless, wiping your fatigue away...}}
:'''Paimon:''' A meal after some honest work always tastes especially great. And the Ragout was... Well, it had a real "homey" feel, eh?
:{{DIcon}} Well, the ingredients and the method of cooking were nothing quite curious.
:'''Paimon:''' Yup. It was normal but tastes really good!
:'''Earnshaw:''' Of course. Even my silly daughter has naught but praises for this dish. Just a whiff of it would send her running to the table, putting all her complaints aside.
:'''Earnshaw:''' But she's very far away now, and I fear she can't smell my Ragout any longer &mdash; I'd wager that she's even forgotten the way home, in fact.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Y'know, Earnshaw, if you don't mind telling us what she looks like, we could find her for you. We're good at that, remember?
:{{DIcon}} If we meet her in our travels, that is.
:'''Earnshaw:''' Ah, you truly are good-hearted children. Thank you. In truth, it would not be hard for me to find her &mdash; she did get someone to send me some letters previously.
:'''Earnshaw:''' But I reckon she doesn't think she's at fault... Why else would she only send letters but not return home?
:'''Earnshaw:''' As such, I haven't read a single one of her letters. In fact, I haven't opened a single one. We can overlook the folly of animals, but are we to accept that from a human &mdash; a grown woman, no less?
:'''Earnshaw:''' Speaking of which, she hasn't sent any letters recently... Perhaps she's finally grown tired of trying to get a rise out of me.
:'''Earnshaw:''' Regardless, I shall not hire people specifically to bring her back. She can either admit fault and return herself, or not at all.
:'''Paimon:''' O&mdash;Okay, if you say so...
:'''Earnshaw:''' All the same, thank you for helping to bring Hero and the others back. The payment isn't much, even with the Ragout added in... So take both, would you?
:'''Earnshaw:''' You adventurers often sleep out in the wild, don't you? Well, remember to eat well and dress warmly. Don't starve, or catch a chill.
:'''Paimon:''' Yup. You take care of your leg too, Earnshaw!
:'''Earnshaw:''' See you. Take good care of yourselves!

;(Trample the flowers the first time before speaking to Earnshaw, optional)
:{{Black Screen|Earnshaw brings you out of the garden...}}
:'''Earnshaw:''' You... *sigh* Don't ruin the flowers...
:'''Paimon:''' We didn't do it on purpose! B&mdash;Besides, the dogs did the same thing...
:'''Earnshaw:''' That's because they're naughty. You shouldn't learn from their bad examples.
:'''Paimon:''' Ohh...

;(Trample the flowers any subsequent time before speaking to Earnshaw, optional)
:{{Black Screen|You are chased out of the garden by the angry old man...}}
:'''Paimon:''' On no, that's more flowers trampled... {{Traveler}}, we should slow down and really watch our steps!

;(Talk to Lanoire)
:'''Lanoire:''' Oh! It's {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}} and Ms. Paimon!
:'''Paimon:''' Lanoire, Earnshaw! It's great to see you again!
:{{DIcon}} How are you adjusting to life in your new home?
:'''Lanoire:''' Don't be silly, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}! This isn't my new home, it's my old home. Isn't that what [[Caterpillar|Cater]] said?
:'''Lanoire:''' Grandpa's [[Tasses Ragout]] is so tasty! He's teaching me how to make it, but it'll take awhile before I've got it down...
:'''Earnshaw:''' There's plenty of time, no need to rush it.
:'''Earnshaw:''' That reminds me, is this "Cater" not with you? I still haven't thanked him in person...
:'''Paimon:''' He had something else to take care of, so we've parted ways for now.
:'''Earnshaw:''' I see, that's too bad.
:'''Lanoire:''' Do you think he's already forgotten about me, Ms. Paimon...?
:'''Paimon:''' Of course not! He's just tied up with something right now...
:'''Paimon:''' Besides... You two promised each other, right? The next time you meet, he'll finish telling that story from before, and you'll have lots of amazing stories to tell him, right?
:'''Lanoire:''' Yeah... But...
:'''Earnshaw:''' Ahem! That reminds me, Hero has gone and wandered off and gone who-knows-where again. Lanoire, would you be a good girl and help Grandpa find him and bring him home?
:'''Earnshaw:''' I bet he's gotten himself all dirty playing outside. Bring him back and give him a bath.
:'''Lanoire:''' Aww, just let him play outside. It's boring just staying inside all the time.
:'''Earnshaw:''' Well, if he runs off or gets snatched by a monster in the forest and can't come back, don't come crying to me.
:'''Lanoire:''' Eek... I&mdash;I'll bring him back and give him a bath then!
:'''Earnshaw:''' Wonderful. Prince and Princess are playing in the garden right now, why don't you bring them back in, too? They're also probably covered head-to-toe in mud by now. I'll give them a good scrubbing later as well.
:'''Lanoire:''' Alrighty. {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, Ms. Paimon, you guys rest a while. I'll be right back!
:'''Paimon:''' Why don't we go with you? It'll be just like when we went on adventures in the [[Fortress of Meropide|Fortress]].
:'''Lanoire:''' You wanna come with me? That would be great!
:'''Lanoire:''' Let me think... then let's call this adventure "Operation Rescue Hero"!
:{{DIcon}} Heroes should be able to get themselves out of trouble on their own.
::'''Lanoire:''' But he's just a doggy, and an old one at that! So, it's up to us brave young warriors to rescue him from the dust and mud!
:{{DIcon}} And what about Prince and Princess?
::'''Lanoire:''' Well... the name would be too long if we tried put{{sic}} them all in! Let's just say that rescuing Hero includes bringing Prince and Princess back inside too.
:'''Earnshaw:''' You can go together, just remember not to let Hero eat anything too strange. He more than likely ran off to the north hut to play, if you head north you should run into him.
:'''Lanoire:''' Okay! {{color|buzzword|If he acts up and doesn't want to come home with us, I'll just take his food away}}. Then he'll definitely be a good boy and come home!
:'''Earnshaw:''' Excellent. Also, {{color|buzzword|don't trample the flowers behind the fence}}!
:'''Lanoire:''' Well, you definitely don't have to worry about Ms. Paimon stepping on any! But don't worry, Grandpa. {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}} and I will be careful.
:'''Lanoire:''' {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, Ms. Paimon, let's go!

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Lanoire:''' Hero and the others don't like to be touched... We'll just have to herd them back. All we need to do is {{color|buzzword|make them run toward their home}}.

;(Talk to Earnshaw again, optional)
:'''Earnshaw:''' Great. You kids play with Lanoire for a little while.

;(Trample the flowers, optional)
:{{Black Screen|Earnshaw brings you out of the garden...}}
:'''Earnshaw:''' You... *sigh* Don't ruin the flowers...
:'''Lanoire:''' If you step on the giant's favorite little purple flowers, he'll get really mad!
:'''Earnshaw:''' All you do is make trouble!

;(Trample the flowers any subsequent time, optional)
:{{Black Screen|Earnshaw brings you out of the garden...}}
:'''Lanoire:''' *sniffling* You stepped on the flowers again... {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, please be more careful, or... or else Grandpa really won't let me drink [[Fonta]]! And if I can't drink Fonta, what would I do...

;(Approach Hero)
:'''Lanoire:''' If Hero is just lazing about here, it must be because it is craving for some of this Fowl! But it's already getting pretty big, so if it doesn't watch its diet, it might get an upset tummy!
:'''Lanoire:''' {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, let's take this Fowl away!
:;(Pick up {{Item|Suspicious Fowl|x=3}}

;(Approach Prince)
:'''Lanoire:''' Okay, let's go home, and let Grandpa help you clean up!

;(Approach Princess)
:'''Lanoire:''' Wow, so that's where you hid! Must be playing hide-and-seek with another one, hehe.
:'''Lanoire:''' {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, let's jump in from above, or else we'll step on the little purple flowers and make the giant really mad!

;(Bring the first dog back to the kennel)
:'''Lanoire:''' That's one back home! Let's go find the next one.

;(Bring the second dog back to the kennel)
:'''Lanoire:''' Be good and wait here! {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, let's bring the last one home!

;(Bring the third dog back to the kennel)
:'''Lanoire:''' Hehe, that's all of them. Rescue mission accomplished! Let's go back and find Grandpa!

;(Talk to Earnshaw)
:'''Paimon:''' This operation... is trickier than Paimon expected.
:'''Lanoire:''' That's because the giant in the garden really loves those little purple flowers, and he has all kinds of rules.
:'''Earnshaw:''' Unruly children should learn to follow the rules while they're still young. It's even harder to teach an old dog new tricks.
:{{DIcon}} You hear that, Paimon?
::'''Paimon:''' Huh? What's that got to do with Paimon? She's not an unruly child. Hmph!
:{{DIcon}} Unruly children get locked up in the garden.
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, but Paimon's definitely not gonna step on any flowers! Besides, she could fly over a high wall without a witch's help!
:'''Earnshaw:''' Have you all tired yourselves out? I just happened to make some Tasses Ragout today, please, sit down and have some.
:'''Lanoire:''' Yes, yes! {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, Ms. Paimon, let's eat together!
:'''Paimon:''' Alright! We couldn't turn down an invitation like that from Lanoire, could we, {{Traveler}}? Hehe.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for your hospitality.
:'''Earnshaw:''' You're Lanoire's friends, no need to be so polite.
:{{Black Screen|Having been invited inside, you enjoy a simple but delicious meal of Tasses Ragout.<br>Over the meal, you share stories from your journey that astonish the old man and make the little girl burst out laughing.<br>A joyful time passes amid conversation and laughter...}}
:'''Lanoire:''' What do you think? Isn't Grandpa's cooking even better than [[Wolsey]]'s?
:{{DIcon}} It really is.
:{{DIcon}} Meh, about the same...
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks Earnshaw's Tasses Ragout is way more delicious! It tastes like... home, if that makes sense?
:'''Lanoire:''' {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, Ms. Paimon, guess what! I helped, too!
:'''Lanoire:''' Though for now I can only help a little bit, {{sic|Granpda}} says that as long as I practice, I'll also {{sic|being}} able to make Delicious Tasses Ragout someday!
:'''Lanoire:''' Hehe, when that day comes, you'll both have to come back and try it for yourselves!
:'''Paimon:''' Deal! Paimon's looking forward to it.
:'''Paimon:''' Speaking of which, it's probably time we got going. Thank you for having us.
:'''Lanoire:''' What? You're leaving already?
:'''Earnshaw:''' Now, now, Lanoire. They have their own matters to attend to, they can't play with you all the time.
:'''Lanoire:''' Oh... okay then.
:'''Paimon:''' Don't be sad, we'll see each other the next chance we get!
:'''Lanoire:''' Really? Will Cater be there too next time?
:'''Paimon:''' Well... that shouldn't be completely impossible!
:'''Lanoire:''' Alright, then. I'll be sure to have lots of amazing stories to tell you all the next time we see each other.
:'''Paimon:''' Sounds good. Paimon's sure Caterpillar is looking forward to hearing them, too.
:'''Earnshaw:''' You're great kids, thanks for coming to see {{sic|Lanoirre}} and keeping her company. Here's some Tasses Ragout for the road.
:'''Earnshaw:''' You adventurers often sleep out in the wild, don't you? Well, remember to eat well and dress warmly. Don't starve, or catch a chill.
:'''Paimon:''' We will! You be sure to look after yourselves, as well.
