* Updated the monster lineup on Floor 11 of the Spiral Abyss.
* Updated the monster lineup on Floor 12 of the Spiral Abyss.
* Starting from the first time that the Lunar Phase refreshes after updating to Version 3.2, the two Lunar Phases will be as follows:
** Phase I: Hailing Moon
*** When characters deal DMG to an opponent, a shockwave will be unleashed at that opponent's position, dealing True DMG. Each Elemental DMG Type (including Physical DMG) can unleash a shockwave this way every 8s.
** Phase II: Lush Moon
*** When characters trigger Burning, Quicken, Aggravate, Spread, Bloom, Hyperbloom, or Burgeon on an opponent, all party members will gain 10% Dendro DMG Bonus for 10s. This bonus can be triggered once every 5s. Max 4 stacks. Once 4 stacks have been gained, when characters deal Dendro DMG to an opponent, a shockwave will be unleashed at that opponent's position, dealing True DMG. A shockwave can be unleashed in this way once every 5s.
* The above Spiral Abyss update will take effect from November 16 at 04:00 (Server Time).
