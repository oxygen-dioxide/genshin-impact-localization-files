'''Przheva''' is an open-world [[NPC]] located in [[Port Ormos]], [[Sumeru]]. Before completing the World Quest ''[[The Price]]'', he can be found outside [[Shapur Hotel]] during the day (06:00 – 19:00), sitting across the table from [[Alexandra]].

==Profile==
<!-- Detailed story/lore information goes here. -->
Przheva is a member of the Fatui who, along with [[Alexandra]], attempted to defect from the organization. During the events of ''[[The Price]]'', the two planned to stage a monster attack and a confrontation with the [[Traveler]] to fake their deaths and escape. However, Alexandra was attacked by monsters while setting up the trap and sustained serious injuries protecting [[Nika]]. The Traveler took Nika to safety, but by the time they came back Przheva and Alexandra had disappeared.  

Returning to the rendezvous point in [[Port Ormos]], the Traveler can find an [[Unsigned Note]] hinting that only one of the two safely departed Sumeru. The description of the [[Date of Departure]] achievement indicates that the note's author is Alexandra. It is likely that she is the one who escaped. Alternatively, it is possible that she wrote the note after sending Przheva off, before succumbing to her injuries.

:'''Przheva:''' *sigh* We have to hurry. We can't leave the cargo for too long.
:'''Alexandra:''' How will we handle the batch of goods that doesn't have confirmed buyers after the ship arrives?
:'''Przheva:''' Hm, when the time comes, we will dispose of that batch of old goods.
:'''Przheva:''' But it still depends on how much cargo that ship is carrying...
