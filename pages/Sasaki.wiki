==Dialogue==
===Before [[The Firmiana Leaf Falls]]===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Sasaki:''' ...What is it?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Sasaki:''' I am Sasaki, a subordinate of the Kanjou Commissioner.
::'''Sasaki:''' ...A reminder for you, if you have any impudent ideas concerning Miss Hiiragi, you'd best watch out for the blade in my hands.
::{{DIcon}} Miss Hiiragi?
::'''Sasaki:''' As a daughter that he had in his old age, the Commissioner dotes on Miss Hiiragi. He even requested that a Chief Samurai such as myself be her personal bodyguard.
::'''Sasaki:''' Heh... If I must be frank, that's truly a waste of my great talents.
::'''Sasaki:''' That being said, since it's an order from the Commissioner, I shall still do my utmost.
::'''Sasaki:''' Hmph, I've heard that many young punks inside the Commission have also been harboring mischievous thoughts about Miss Hiiragi...
::'''Sasaki:''' ...No matter who it may be, I, Sasaki, shall not show any mercy if he oversteps his bounds.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Sasaki:''' Bye.
{{Dialogue end}}

===After [[The Firmiana Leaf Falls]]===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Sasaki:''' ...What is it?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Sasaki:''' I am Sasaki, a subordinate of the Kanjou Commissioner. I am present in charge of our Lady's security.
::'''Sasaki:''' Presently, she is a key member of the Kanjou Commission, so I cannot afford to be lax. Not in the slightest.
:{{DIcon}} How's Hiiragi Chisato doing?
::'''Sasaki:''' After that whole hullabaloo, she seems to have completely changed, and has taken to settling the clan's affairs with great drive.
::'''Sasaki:''' She has taken up all the things that would be the Commissioner's duties, and she has performed very well indeed.
::'''Sasaki:''' She is very talented, this much I can tell. Though road ahead may be long... But I'm glad that she took this step forward.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Sasaki:''' Bye.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Event Dialogue==
===Hues of the Violet Garden===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Sasaki:''' What's this Iro... Irodory Festival thing again? What's it supposed to be?
:'''Sasaki:''' And there's a ton of people here too. I must admit that it's got me a little muddle-headed.
:'''Sasaki:''' Still, it's good to see our pampered Lady do work out there, so I suppose I can't complain.
