* Updates to character voice-overs:
** Updated text for English:
*** "About Venti":
**** {{Color|Old}}: That's still the name the Anemo Archon takes among mortals these days, is it? Truth be told, from the very first moment I met him, I could somehow sense that we were not going to get along. Also, he sure can drink a lot.
**** {{Color|New}}: Hmm. So, the Anemo Archon still goes by that name among mortals these days? Truth be told, from the very first moment I met him, I could somehow sense that we were not going to get along. Also, he sure can drink a lot.
