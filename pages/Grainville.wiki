: {{DIcon|Idle}} Safety rules...
:: {{A|VO Grainville 01.ogg}} "Learn the safety rules by heart. ...Wait, what was the second part?"
{{Dialogue End}}

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Grainville:''' All relevant labor regulations and procedures must be followed in the production zone, safety first. Any questions?
:{{DIcon}} About those rules...
::'''Grainville:''' First, bringing items not related to production into the production zone is forbidden, including [[Genius Invokation TCG]] cards, books, etc. Beast Traps too, though just who would even think of setting one up here...
::'''Grainville:''' Second, complete production work in a timely manner and ensure all products meet quality standards. Be willing to accept technical assistance when necessary. This bit should be pretty obvious, yeah?
::'''Grainville:''' Finally, take good care of equipment! Stealing any production materials or modifying the clockwork meka is strictly forbidden. Wouldn't want to spend time in Solitary staring at the wall and twiddling your thumbs, no would you?
:{{DIcon}} About the loudspeaker...
::'''Grainville:''' It's necessary to keep everyone's spirits up. Too loud? Ha! How could it possibly be too loud?
::'''Grainville:''' The only problem is that it keeps breaking down... It used to start working again if you smacked it a couple of times. But that doesn't work now. I think we need someone to actually give it some serious maintenance...
:{{DIcon}} Sure thing.
::'''Grainville:''' No more questions? Good.
