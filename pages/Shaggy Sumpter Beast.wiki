|description = Sumpter Beasts are friends of humanity. These gentle-hearted creatures are indispensable elements of production and transportation. In Sumeru, your wealth is symbolized by the number of Sumpter Beasts you own. Large merchant caravans and Eremites usually come with very sizable trains of Sumpter Beasts indeed, and this allows them to carry ample supplies and goods across both desert and forest alike.

'''Shaggy Sumpter Beast''' is a [[Wildlife]].

In the wild, they spend a large portion of the day eating. When mealtime is over, they will lay down on the floor and rest quietly. Should enemies approach, they will launch an attack, using their huge bodies to drive away uninvited guests.

==Drops==
Meat is always guaranteed. Some Sumpter Beasts may be carrying items, indicating "ownership" of the Sumpter Beast. Depending on who owns the beast, the beast will drop various items affiliated with that faction.
