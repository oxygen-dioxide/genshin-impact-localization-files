A ritual goblet used by the shamans of an ancient tribe.<br>It held the blood to be offered to the Thunderbird.

In the seasons when the Thunderbird flew amidst the stormy mountains, a young lad sang without fear.<br>Attracted to his voice, the prideful Thunderbird landed by his side.

"Curious tunes, tiny human. Afraid not of thunder and storms?<br>"They said I can bring peace to thunder and storms."

The young lad paused and answered.<br>The Thunderbird cried but kept its silence.<br>For his was an enchanting song.

It was the first and last meeting between the Thunderbird and the young boy.<br>For the next she saw of the boy was when his blood filled the golden goblet on the sacrificial altar.
