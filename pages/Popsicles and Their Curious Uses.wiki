;(Approach Wanmin Restaurant)
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' ...This is bad. [[Chef Mao]] is not at the restaurant right now, and neither is [[Xiangling]]...
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' We'll have to wait till he returns... What do we do about the evil spirits?
:{{DIcon}} If it's not too difficult, I can try to make some.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Oh, are you a good cook?
:{{DIcon}} Making popsicles seems easy enough.
:{{DIcon}} I often cook for myself when adventuring in the wilderness.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Then I'll leave it to you. Thanks for your help.
:{{DIcon}} Do you know what ingredients we should use?
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 05.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Uhh... I'm afraid all I know is that it requires water. But to imbue the effect that suppresses my yang energy, perhaps something special is required.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 06.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Like different plants, fruits, or herbs, for example.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 07.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Do you have any experience with such things?
:{{DIcon}} Let's try Mist Flower and Qingxin.
:;(Go to [[#A Cooling Mix|A Cooling Mix]])
:{{DIcon}} Let's try Sunsettia and Valberries.
:;(Go to [[#A Sweet Mix|A Sweet Mix]])
:{{DIcon}} Let's try Jueyun Chili and Slime Condensate.

===A Cooling Mix===
{{Dialogue start}}
:{{DIcon}} Let's try Mist Flower and Qingxin.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 10.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Oh, that sounds about right.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 11.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Coming up with the right ingredients off the top of your head like that... You most certainly are an experienced adventurer.

;(Talk to Chongyun again)
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902406 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Have you procured all the ingredients for the popsicles?
:;(Opens the submission menu)
:'''''The Travelers makes popsicles with the ingredients gathered...'''''
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902403 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Are they finished? Oh, they look exactly like the ones Chef Mao makes for me.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902403 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Let me try one.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902403 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' *licks popsicle* Mmmm, yes...
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902403 chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' ...Good, this is the right feeling. I can sense the energy calming down within me.
:{{DIcon}} These should help you keep control.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902403 chongyun 05.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Thank you, Traveler, now I have lots of popsicles. Your skills are amazing!
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902403 chongyun 06.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' If I'd known you possess such skills, we could've made more for that kid and his family.
:{{DIcon}} It'd have to be a lot more &mdash; I'm sure the kid would eat most of them and still be hungry.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902403 chongyun 07.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Haha, right. But he mentioned his family is not well-off. I'd still like to help them if I can.
:{{DIcon}} But what about your search for evil spirits?
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902403 chongyun 08.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Exorcism is my means of helping the people of Liyue live more peaceful and happy lives.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902403 chongyun 09.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' If that kid really needs my help, then helping him would just be different means to the same end.
:{{DIcon}} I'll go with you.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902403 chongyun 10.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Alright. I remember the kid mentioned that he was headed for Chihu Rock. Let's go find him.

===A Sweet Mix===
{{Dialogue start}}
:{{DIcon}} Let's try Sunsettia and Valberries.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 08.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Hmm, those do sound refreshing, but the popsicles aren't sweet.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 09.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' ...But in case you know something I don't, I'll trust your judgment.

:{{A|vo cycop001 1902404 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Let me try one.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902404 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' *licks popsicle* Mmmm, yes...
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902404 chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' It tastes fruity and sweet... It's delicious!
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902404 chongyun 05.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' But I'm afraid it's not as effective at suppressing my yang energy as Chef Mao's popsicles.
:{{DIcon}} I thought just any popsicles would do.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902404 chongyun 06.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Sadly not, but in any case, these should be good enough for now.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902404 chongyun 07.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' These popsicles really are delicious... I bet that kid we met earlier would be thrilled to taste this flavor.
:{{DIcon}} It'd have to be a lot more &mdash; I'm sure the kid would eat most of them and still be hungry.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902404 chongyun 08.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Haha, right. But he mentioned his family is not well-off. I'd still like to help them if I can.

:{{DIcon}} Let's try Jueyun Chili and Slime Condensate.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 12.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Uh, that sounds a little... dangerous.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902401 chongyun 13.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' But as the saying goes, "fight fire with fire." I trust your judgment.
