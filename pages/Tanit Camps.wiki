====Advanced Visual Technologies: [[Fontaine]] Cinema Edition====
Found outside [[Aderfi]]'s tent.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Advanced Visual Technologies: Fontaine Cinema Edition:''' (A very new book. There are numerous colorful pictures in its pages, and they mostly come from film sets and shooting locations in Fontaine.)
:'''Advanced Visual Technologies: Fontaine Cinema Edition:''' ([[Ebert]], a [[Vahumana]] researcher, gave each of the films an elegant review and also provided them with ratings...)
:'''Advanced Visual Technologies: Fontaine Cinema Edition:''' (The vast majority of this content has to do with complex [[Kshahrewar]] theories and treatises, detailing the imaging techniques and potential future market applications of this advanced piece of machinery.)
:'''Advanced Visual Technologies: Fontaine Cinema Edition:''' (Though it has little to do with tribal life, the people of the tribe are quite fond of this book... You notice the edge of the pages has been discolored from repeated friction, doubtlessly inflicted by rubbing fingers.)
:'''Advanced Visual Technologies: Fontaine Cinema Edition:''' (How are the desert folk, who live in resource-scarce conditions, supposed to imagine the innovative and luxurious aesthetics offered by cinema machines?)
:'''Advanced Visual Technologies: Fontaine Cinema Edition:''' (On the title page, a small red cross sits next to the Akademiya Library emblem, and the following words have been written beneath it: "This piece of entertainment has failed to pass Akademiya evaluations, and hence cannot be entered into the Akasha.")
{{Dialogue End}}

====On Language and Rhetoric (IV)====
Found in Aderfi's tent.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''On Language and Rhetoric (IV):''' (A book mangled from how many times it's been read. Seems like it held quite the rapt audience.)
:'''On Language and Rhetoric (IV):''' (You notice that the bottom of the title page has an emblem belonging to the Akademiya Library... Perhaps this book is among those that have been smuggled.)
{{Dialogue End}}

====Pursina's Essays: 26====
Found in Aderfi's tent.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Pursina's Essays: 26:''' (True knowledge is not something that can be drawn casually from the Akasha. Instead, the desert-dwellers get more comprehensive education during their long walks across the sands...)
:'''Pursina's Essays: 26:''' (You notice that the bottom of the title page has an emblem belonging to the Akademiya Library... Perhaps this book is among those that have been smuggled.)
{{Dialogue End}}

====101 Painful Jokes====
Found in [[Masseira]]'s tent.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''101 Painful Jokes:''' "Hilarious? This is barely worth a chuckle. Tell Aderfi to never do anything like this again."
:'''101 Painful Jokes:''' (You notice that the bottom of the title page has an emblem belonging to the Akademiya Library... Perhaps this book is among those that have been smuggled.)
{{Dialogue End}}

====Lunar Philosophy====
Found near the water on the west side of the Tanit Camps.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Lunar Philosophy:''' (It seems to be a piece of literature. The words fly out at you as you flip through the pages.)
:'''Lunar Philosophy:''' (It was a literary analysis. How disappointing... Though not nearly as carefully formatted as the material preferred by Akademiya students, it is astonishing that the desert-dwellers would spend so much time reading such a boring book.)
:'''Lunar Philosophy:''' (You notice that the bottom of the title page has an emblem belonging to the Akademiya Library... Perhaps this book is among those that have been smuggled.)

====Anthology on Desert-Based Archaeology (III)====
Found in a tent with a collectable [[Sumeru Rose]] north of Masseira's tent across a bridge.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Anthology on Desert-Based Archaeology (III):''' (A large book that has seen some years. It's been flipped through by the rough fingers of the desert folk countless times... There are some new notes scrawled across its pages. Messy though the notes might be, they still adhere to a certain logic.)
:'''Anthology on Desert-Based Archaeology (III):''' (You notice that the bottom of the title page has an emblem belonging to the Akademiya Library... Perhaps this book is among those that have been smuggled.)

====Akademiya Emblem-Marked Contract====
Found just east of Matriarch [[Babel]]'s tent.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:In the name of the eternal oath of friendship between the [[Nabu Malikata|Queen of the Garden]] and the [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|Queen of the Rainforest]], Matriarch Babel Tanit chooses warriors [[Azariq]], [[Aksir]]... and others... salary... Mora per day, to escort the researcher, [[Jazira Yassar]], across the desert, to provide protection and all other possible conveniences for the inspection of ancient machinery...<br><br>

====Tribe Merchant's Letter====
Found just east of Matriarch Babel's tent ''(appears after completing ''[[Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises]]'')''.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:...The [[Akasha]] no longer seems to be popular in the city. It seems that some change in upper management has occurred. Rumors are rife that [[Azar]], the Grand Sage, has been deposed, and that those Bazaar merchants who clung to his coattails and those of his lackeys have lost their exclusive franchise privileges... It seems that trade between the desert and the city may improve in the future.<br>
:...Many books have had bans on them rescinded, but a small minority of seminal academic texts still require one to jump through some special hoops to obtain. For us, the Tanit, this is good news. We now no longer need to resort to smuggling to obtain knowledge.<br>
:...As for the "aid plan" that the Matriarch has been quite concerned about, it seems that the General Mahamatra, [[Cyno]], who had a big role to play in recent events, will be in charge of it. But most of the books they will provide for free have to do with basic education, and are of limited use to us.<br>
:Considering that we and the city folk have been at odds for many years, there is reason to suspect their motives for sending researchers to us. These snooping city dwellers are likely no different from those of yesteryear &mdash; just looking to disrupt our lives and make a profit for themselves. And if they should show an interest in the ruins of Gurabad and the Eternal Oasis, this can only bring harm upon our tribe...<br><br>
:As such, Matriarch [[Babel]], I urge you to give thought to the manner in which we might deal with this latest intrusion from the Akademiya &mdash; the independence and unity of our tribe and our sister tribes, and our ability to resist external forces, are at stake here...
{{Dialogue End}}

====Crumpled Namelist====
Found in [[Crumpled Namelist|Jeht's tent]] ''(changes location after completing ''[[For Her Judgment Reaches to the Skies...]]'')''.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:(This is a simple list of names. Apart from "Masseira," all the other names have been struck out.)
:[[Bleda]]
:[[Gwaffah]]
:[[Izder]]
:[[Meddur]]
:[[Teyya]]
:[[Masseira]]
{{Dialogue End}}

====Jeht's Note====
Found at the entrance of Jeht's tent.{{verify|available after starting ''[[Her Foes Rage Like Great Waters...]]''?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
: Out on business!
: Jeht Tanit<br><br>
: (There is a stick-person Jeht scribbled in a corner of the note. She has a cheeky grin on her face.)
