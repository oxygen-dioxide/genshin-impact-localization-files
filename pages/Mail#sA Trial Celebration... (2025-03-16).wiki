|text      = In psychology, there's a saying: "When people realize their existence is unique and feel genuinely valued by others, they experience immense happiness, and some of their frustrations begin to fade away."

The day of each person's birth is proof of their unique existence.

With that in mind, the [[Aisa Bathhouse]] plans to start accepting commissions for birthday celebrations starting from tomorrow. The scale of such celebrations can be customized from small to large, and the atmosphere from cozy to lively, all according to each client's wishes. If the client hasn't made a detailed plan, I can provide them with some pre-selected options. Of course, I'm quite confident this will work out exactly as I envision it...

But, say, if you're willing to join me tonight for a "trial celebration," that would be absolutely perfect.

I'll prepare only the finest selection of food, sweets, fragrances, and music. That way, we can enjoy some truly wonderful leisure time...
