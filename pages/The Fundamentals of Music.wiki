;(Talk to Tailleferre)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, looks like we meet again, Tailleferre!
:'''Tailleferre:''' Ah, it's you two! The adventurer and {{MC|m=his|f=her}} little assistant. Sorry, I've forgotten your names...
:'''Paimon:''' The name's Paimon, and {{MC|m=he|f=she}}'s {{Traveler}}. Thanks for your help last time, by the way &mdash; thanks to you, we managed to use a Conch Harp to play ancient music!
:'''Paimon:''' Still, what brings you here to Petrichor?
:'''Tailleferre:''' That's what I wanted to ask you &mdash; I'm chasing a rumor, but I suppose adventurers like you might already be well ahead of the game.
:'''Paimon:''' Rumors? What are you talking about?
:'''Tailleferre:''' Hmm? Don't you know about the big news out of Petrichor lately...?
:{{DIcon}} About how we accidentally saved the world?
:{{DIcon}} About the Great Hypnosis of Petrichor?
:'''Tailleferre:''' Huh? What are you... No, no, I'm talking about the rediscovery of the legendary [[Faded Castle]]!
:'''Tailleferre:''' The last records of the place are several centuries ago. And here I thought that was what you were here for!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, that... That might've had something to do with us, sure...
:'''Tailleferre:''' In that case, I'm sure you know that the castle once belonged to [[Boethius]], yes? The most important musician in Fontaine's history?
:'''Tailleferre:''' Whether it be the operas he wrote, or the ancient [[Remuria]]n scores he compiled, his works all have a special place in music history.
:'''Tailleferre:''' Surely, a vast wealth of resources can be found at the castle in which he once lived, each an important relic to us in the Musicians' Association.
:'''Tailleferre:''' As such, I rushed here as soon as I heard the news, trying to secure any important relics before all the adventurers get here.
:'''Tailleferre:''' But I suppose you were one step ahead of me, eh?
:'''Paimon:''' (Err, what should we tell her? That Boethius is actually a big baddie, who used all that music to do a whole bunch of evil stuff...?)
:'''Paimon:''' (Would knowing the truth sadden her...?)
:{{DIcon}} The "Symphony" can no longer be used for evil.
:{{DIcon}} It's going to take some time to explain all this...
:'''Tailleferre:''' Hmm? What are you two talking about? You haven't already found some ancient scores, have you?
:'''Paimon:''' Well, uh, what if... And Paimon's saying "if," Boethius was a really, really nasty guy, would you still want the musical scores he left behind?
:'''Tailleferre:''' Hmm... To be honest, while I'm not sure what you mean specifically by him being "really, really nasty," history has few {{sic|kinds}} words for him apart from his music.
:'''Tailleferre:''' From his romantic opera "The Flying Outlander," we can easily tell that he never gave up on reviving Remuria for so long as he lived, and consequently, saw the newborn Fontaine as an enemy.
:'''Tailleferre:''' According to historians, he also had a hand in the wars that occurred before Fontaine's founding...
:'''Tailleferre:''' His musical achievements, however, are a different kettle of fish altogether. There might be false histories in his music, but they retain their value as art.
:'''Tailleferre:''' And as I see it, these things are all a part of history as well. Even the purest of art can be used to do wrong, and all musicians would do well to remember that.
:{{DIcon}} Well, I'm sure you wouldn't use these things for evil.
::'''Tailleferre:''' Haha, I'm just a researcher. I am honored beyond words simply to hear these ancient melodies.
:{{DIcon}} Impressive convictions.
::'''Tailleferre:''' Hehe, well, it's just my personal opinion.
:'''Tailleferre:''' Speaking of which, since chance has seen fit for us to meet here, could I ask you to help me out with something?
:'''Tailleferre:''' You can consider it payment for the favor from last time!
:{{DIcon}} You said you didn't need payment last time...
::'''Tailleferre:''' Hehe, in that case, this is just "help" then, right?
:{{DIcon}} I'm gonna need to be paid...
::'''Tailleferre:''' Don't worry, you'll be compensated. I'll have you know that the Musicians' Association isn't some gathering of paupers!
:{{DIcon}} I guessed this might happen...
:'''Tailleferre:''' Anyway, as I mentioned earlier, I'm here to look for the famous lost opera, "The Flying Outlander."
:'''Tailleferre:''' According to records left by someone named [[Ruggiero]] several hundred years back, it should be somewhere within the Faded Castle. Could you help me search for it?
:'''Tailleferre:''' I imagine you're much better versed in such matters than I, after all.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, since she's asked, {{Traveler}}, and those scores don't have "that power" anymore... We might as well, right?
:'''Tailleferre:''' Alright, I'll take that {{sic|mean}} you've agreed. Hehe, splendid!
:'''Tailleferre:''' I'm counting on you, then. I'll wait for you in town in the meantime.

;(Check the [[Damaged Score]])
::[[File:Item Restored Score Tattered Score.png|150x150px]]
;(If the player did not speak to Tailleferre)
::'''Paimon:''' This seems like... sheet music? Looks like there are several chunks missing, though...
;(If the player spoke to Tailleferre)
::'''Paimon:''' Guess this is the score Tailleferre was looking for. Still, we're missing several chunks of it... Where do we find the missing bits?

;(Combine the Damaged Score)
:;(Submit {{Item|Pages From a Lost Score (I)}}, {{Item|Pages From a Lost Score (II)}})
;(If the player did not speak to Tailleferre before combining the Damaged Score)
::'''Paimon:''' Phew, guess this score's been pieced together. Still, what can it be used for...?
;(If the player spoke to Tailleferre)
::'''Paimon:''' Phew, pieced it together at last! Let's scuttle back over to town and hand it over to Tailleferre!
;(Obtain {{Item|Restored Score}})

;(Talk to Tailleferre)
:'''Tailleferre:''' The scenery here truly is rather excellent. We order many an instrument from this town every year, but this is my first time visiting.
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Tell me about the music score...
:;(Opens submission menu)
:{{DIcon}} I've got no questions.
::'''Tailleferre:''' I'm counting on you, then. I'll wait for you in town in the meantime.
----
;(After submitting {{Item|Restored Score}})
:'''Tailleferre:''' Hmm, this is... Yes, this is indeed "The Flying Outlander." To think that you actually found it...
:'''Tailleferre:''' It can't have been easy, but I was right to put my trust in you, excellent adventurers!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, thanks! Still, what are you gonna do with the score? Are you gonna perform it at the [[Opera Epiclese]], maybe make a pile of Mora?
:'''Tailleferre:''' Hmm... Making money is important, but I have no intention of keeping this for my own.
:'''Tailleferre:''' This ancient art is part of the common wealth of humanity. As such, I will release "The Flying Outlander" into the public domain once my research is complete.
:'''Tailleferre:''' After all, is not recovering this lost play and filling in a page of history heretofore missing the greater deed to do?
:{{DIcon}} I'll be rooting for you!
:{{DIcon}} Don't forget the part I played.
::'''Tailleferre:''' Of course. Your name will be on the title page for sure!
:'''Tailleferre:''' Well then, I suppose I should hurry back. Research and study await!
:'''Tailleferre:''' Ah yes, here's your payment. If chance should allow it, let us meet again!
