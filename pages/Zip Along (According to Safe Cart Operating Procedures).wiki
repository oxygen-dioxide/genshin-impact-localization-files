{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 klee 01.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Here it is, here it is! See? This canyon wasn't here before!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Just before the canyon appeared, I heard a faint sound, like something mechanical turning.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Ker-chunk, ker-chunk, ker-chunk!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Could it have been the Central Hub? Mm, that would mean this canyon appeared after it started spinning...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Hey, you... Oh, new guys, huh?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, hey... Paimon didn't realize anyone else besides Idyia lived here!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 02.ogg}} '''???:''' You actually saw her? Hmph, she's barely shown her face since everything started falling apart here.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Excuse me for asking, but... who are you?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 03.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Oh right, I didn't introduce myself. I'm Ferdinand. Me and my brothers look after this whole zone.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 04.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Well, we used to. Until this whole domain was... like, flipped upside-down, or whatever. The method we were using to make the carts and tracks stopped working after that...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Idyia is working on repairing the domain. We were just with her before coming here.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 05.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Really...? Huh. I assumed that she'd be curled up in a fetal position somewhere, hoping all her problems will magically disappear on their own... Good for her.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 06.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Anyway, I checked all the stations around the whole circuit...they've all conked out.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 kokomi 04.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Conked out how? Would you mind elaborating a little for us?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 07.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Uh... But aren't you just travelers who stumbled upon this place by accident?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Nuh-uh! I'm Mage Klee, Idyia's helper!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 08.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' ...A Mage? You?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 kokomi 05.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Allow me to explain...
:{{Black Screen|You introduce yourselves to Ferdinand and explain what's happened...}}
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 09.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Okay, I gotcha... Well, right now, the more helpers we got, the better, I guess...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 10.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Anyway, our first priority is to get the carts here up and running again.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Oh? And why is that?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 11.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' The roads here twist and turn so much that the best way to get around is by riding the rail tracks instead...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 12.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Lemme show you... This is what we use to make them. Did Idyia bring you up to speed on these things?
:{{DIcon}} It is a Streaming Projector, right?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 13.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Yep. Basically, we need something that we can put inside that'll make a cart for us.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 klee 04.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Umm... like what? Can it be anything as long as it looks like a cart?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 14.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Yeah, you could put it that way. But one other thing is that it has to be compatible with the tracks.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 kokomi 06.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' So something like... a sedan chair, maybe? Hmm, but I'm not sure we have all the materials required to build one of those...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How about you, {{Traveler}}? Any ideas?
:{{DIcon}} ...Maybe just a basic wooden cart?
::{{A|vo yqeq203 1 paimon 03a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, that would solve the issue of materials.
::{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 15a 1.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Wood's no good. A rickety wooden cart would be too dangerous.
:{{DIcon}} How about a castle with legs?
::{{A|vo yqeq203 1 paimon 03b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What kind of a suggestion is that? That would be way too complicated to make!
::{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 15b 1.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Yeah... Sorry, I don't think we'd have the right materials for that.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Really?&nbsp;....Hey, everyone, come and see what Klee made!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Tada! Look, I made a cart!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow! Amazing work, Klee!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 16.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Whoa... It fits the track like a glove, too!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 17.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Plus... it's a heck of a lot cuter than the ones Idyia made!
:{{DIcon}} Well done, Klee!
:{{DIcon}} Who's a clever mage!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 klee 06.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Hee-hee, I just wanted to give it a try. Then suddenly, boom! There it was!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Paimon's gotta ask &mdash; what exactly did you make your cart from, Klee?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 klee 07.ogg}} '''Klee:''' I used [[Jumpy Dumpty]]!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aha! Thought so...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 18.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Hmm? Is there a problem, or something? If not, then let's get ready to leave.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's just... this cart is made from, um...
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry!
:{{DIcon}} We just need to drive safely!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 19.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' It's a bomb or something, isn't it? Yeah, I gathered from your conversation that Jumpy Dumpty is a little more volatile than the cute name suggests.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 20.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' It's okay, though, 'cause the end product only takes on the general look of the source material. Uh, so to be more specific, while different materials have different properties, most of them aren't transferred to&mdash;
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's okay! No need to delve into the theoretical stuff!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon just wanted to make sure we aren't about to end up like the, uh, "flying fish" of Starfell Lake...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 kokomi 07.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' ...Huh...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 klee 08.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Can we ride the cart now?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 21.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' In a moment. We need a Hydro Eidolon to power it up first.
:'''Hydro Eidolon:''' Gurgle!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 22.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Okay, she's ready to roll. Hop in!

;(While riding the Choo-Choo Cart)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, this cart is fast! Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga, woo-woooo!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 klee 09.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yeah! Hehe, I'm gonna call it the Choo-Choo Cart!

;(Approach the Streaming Projector)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 23.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' The track is damaged up ahead. We need to make some repairs before we can go any further...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 24.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Yep, looks like it's all reverted to a preprint state here.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 kokomi 08.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Do you know why that happened?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 25.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Everything in this domain starts as a preprint and only takes shape after being illuminated by the Streaming Projector.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 26.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' But the Hydro Eidolon that forms the tracks here has been trapped in the print...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' So someone needs to go into the preprint and rescue the Hydro Eidolon. Right?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But the projector here's sealed off by a giant bubble.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 27.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' That's the Hydro Eidolon's way of protecting the device from damage... If the Streaming Projector broke, then we'd be seriously stuck.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aha! So for step one, we need Water Droplet to help!
:'''Hydro Eidolon:''' Gurgle...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aww, it seems to really like that name!
:'''Hydro Eidolon:''' Gurgle!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 ferdinand 28.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Um... Any volunteers for step two...?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Leave that to us. We know what to do!

;(Open the chest on the bottom right)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 ferdinand 01.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Ah, so the Hydro Eidolon was locked up in that chest.

;(Open the chest on the top left)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, it's completely empty.

;(Open the chest on the top right)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 klee 01.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yay, we saved two Water Droplets now!

;(Leave the preprint after finding the two Hydro Eidolons)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, Water Droplets just transformed into some new tracks!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 ferdinand 02.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Good, let's keep going then.

;(While riding the Choo-Choo Cart)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey Ferdinand, you mentioned that you manage this place together with your brothers. Did you mean that your brothers are Water Droplets?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 ferdinand 03.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' No no, the Hydro Eidolons are like helpers here. As for my brothers, well...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 ferdinand 04.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' *sigh* Those two... You'll meet them soon enough.

;(While entering the loops in the Choo-Choo Cart track)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Weee! Look, Klee can fly just like Paimon now!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This is way more exciting than how Paimon usually flies!

;(Reach the station)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 ferdinand 05.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Seems we've just about finished repairing the station and the connecting tracks.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 ferdinand 06.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Let's go check the track switcher now, it's over there.
----
;(Approach the rail junction)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Oh, there's another spinny thing here... It's so big!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 klee 04.ogg}} '''Klee:''' But uh, not as big as the one we saw in the middle of this place. That one was HUGE!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' I bet it's something super important... I remember what Kaeya said earlier!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Very good, Klee! You're using what you saw earlier to make observations, like a real adventurer.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Hmm, it appears to be a system that rotates to switch tracks.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 ferdinand 07.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' That's right. Originally, all you had to do was flip this switch, and the junction would rotate.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 ferdinand 08.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Hmph, but it seems Jeroney still hasn't fixed it yet. He sure talks big but when it comes to actually getting things done...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Is this "Jeroney" you mentioned one of your brothers?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 ferdinand 09.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Yeah, when I talked to him about repairing the tracks, I suggested we start with the station, but he said we should start at the junction...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 ferdinand 10.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Really, it made no difference which one we started with, but he just had to turn it into a huge argument... He always treats me like I'm a fool and disagrees with anything I say.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 ferdinand 11.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Hmph, let's see what he has to say now that I've already fixed the tracks.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' If you ask me, you're clearly a sharp person, Ferdinand.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 2 ferdinand 12.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Yes! Finally, someone who can recognize that rather than just shrugging off my ideas! Come on, let's make our way to the junction and see what he's up to. I bet he's still fretting over what to do.

;(While riding the Choo-Choo Cart)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 3 ferdinand 01.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Sometimes I can't help but get angry just thinking of Jeroney. You should have seen him back in the sandstorm. I suggested we go east, and he argued that we should go west...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You were in sandstorm!? What happened after that?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 3 ferdinand 02.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' We separated and each went our own way...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 3 ferdinand 03.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Lucky for us, we stumbled across this domain, otherwise I'm sure we would have been buried in the sand.

;(Approach Jeroney)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 4 jeroney 01.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' *sigh* Everything will get better once we get the switcher working again.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 4 ferdinand 01.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Hmph, still stuck here just as I expected. Well, did you make any progress?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 4 jeroney 02.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' Didn't I already tell you? Just have the Hydro Eidolons fix the junction and then make a new cart. After that, we can use the junction to...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 4 jeroney 03.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' Wait a minute, how did you get here? It took a lot of effort for me to climb all the way up here.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 4 ferdinand 02.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' The answer is standing right in front of you.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 4 jeroney 04.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' Hah, yeah sure. Those travelers must have helped you.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 4 jeroney 05.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' You never get anything done on your own. You always get someone else's help, and then try to take the credit for yourself.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 4 ferdinand 03.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' You're one to talk. {{sic|What have managed}} to accomplish, huh? You were here just moping around all day!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa... They started arguing the moment they saw each other. But aren't they supposed to be brothers?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 4 jeroney 06.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' Hah, me? His brother? Hardly!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 4 ferdinand 04.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' *sigh* Alright, Jeroney... That's enough.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 4 jeroney 07.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' Ugh, fine. I'd rather be focusing my efforts on fixing the track switch rather than arguing anyway.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 4 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' You should calm down too, Ferdinand. Let's all focus on the situation at hand, any personal problems can be settled later.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 4 ferdinand 05.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' ...Fine.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 4 jeroney 08.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' I'm sorry you had to see that... My name's Jeroney. I'm one of the people responsible for taking care of this area.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 4 jeroney 09.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' I assume you're the ones who helped repair the tracks... Thank you very much, it means a lot.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 4 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' No need to thank us. We're just trying to help Idyia restore the domain.
:{{Black Screen|You explain the situation to Jeroney...}}
:{{A|vo yqeq203 4 jeroney 10.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' I see. Now that you and Ferdinand brought the cart up here, we'll need the Hydro Eidolons to fix the area below.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Them again, huh? Seems the Hydro Eidolons are really important around this place.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 4 jeroney 11.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' Yes, of course. Not only do they keep the junction turning, they operate practically everything else in the domain, too.
:;(A Hydro Eidolon disappears into the giant flower, causing water to well up from the center)
:;(The water overflows into the wheel below, causing the flowers on it to bloom)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 jeroney 01.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' Alright, seems most of the tracks and junctions have been repaired now.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 ferdinand 01.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Yep. So maybe it's time you give credit where credit is due, hmm?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 jeroney 02.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' What, you think you deserve the credit!? If anything, we should be thanking these travelers.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 ferdinand 02.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Ugh, you... Well, either way, you're not the one getting any credit!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 ferdinand 03.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' You're always quick to criticize my ideas and push your own, but you never actually get anything done.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 jeroney 03.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' And what about you? Don't forget that it was [[Haddo]] and I who took care of the mess that one time you impulsively tried one of your brilliant ideas!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 jeroney 04.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' Ah, speaking of Haddo... Wasn't he with you?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 ferdinand 04.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' I left early this morning, I assumed he'd be with you.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 jeroney 05.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' Seriously? Couldn't you have at least looked to see where he was before you left!?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 ferdinand 05.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Hey c'mon... You didn't see him either, so what's your excuse!?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 klee 01.ogg}} '''Klee:''' *whimper*...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Klee?
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
:{{DIcon}} You don't like seeing people argue?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' I don't get it...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Nobody did anything bad, why are they arguing?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 ferdinand 06.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' I, uh... I just don't like his smug attitude, that's all.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 jeroney 06.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' Who are you calling smug? If anything, you're the one who's making such a big fuss right now!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Alright, I think we've heard enough from you two.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' If you insist on bickering, then I'd suggest you go somewhere else, otherwise, I'll just cool you two off myself.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 jeroney 07.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 ferdinand 07.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Now, come with me. I'd like to have a word with you.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Don't be upset Klee... There are many complicated situations in this world which don't always have a logical explanation.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' As a passing traveler here, it's not my place to comment on their disputes...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' But in my experience, family issues can be the toughest to resolve.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seems you don't like dealing with this kind of thing either, Kokomi.
:{{DIcon}} Who would?
:{{DIcon}} Understandable.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 klee 04.ogg}} '''Klee:''' But... it's still not right.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' I don't know how to explain my feelings...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 jeroney 08.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' I'm sorry, we've calmed down. We shouldn't argue in front of a child like that.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 ferdinand 08.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' We're sorry, Klee.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 klee 06.ogg}} '''Klee:''' It's okay...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Back to the topic at hand, weren't you about to go look for your brother, Haddo?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 jeroney 09.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' Ah, right. Our best guess is that he's somewhere around Torrential Twister.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 jeroney 10.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' We would have to use the junction to send the cart to another area.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 ferdinand 09.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Sorry to trouble you again, but would you help us find him?
:{{DIcon}} As long as you promise not to argue.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 jeroney 11.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' Oh, all right...

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 ferdinand 10.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 jeroney 12.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, c'mon you two. You're brothers, after all. Can't you try to get along?

;(Switch the track to the {{Color|help|Amber}} Flower)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 5 jeroney 13.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' Okay, this is the end of this track's segment. Haddo should be nearby.

;(Approach Haddo)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 haddo 01.ogg}} '''Haddo:''' Ah, I guessed you had repaired the tracks and stations as soon as I saw a cart come zipping along. *sickly cough*
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 haddo 02.ogg}} '''Haddo:''' Now that the tracks, station, and carts are all repaired, we're about ready to reopen Torrential Twister. It'll be good to see my design back in action again.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 ferdinand 01.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' *sigh* You're in no condition to be out running around like this, Haddo.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 haddo 03.ogg}} '''Haddo:''' Yeah, but these are unusual circumstances... *cough*
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 ferdinand 02.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' That's true, but you should stop to think things through.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 jeroney 01.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' Exactly! If there's anything that needs to be done, you can just let Ferdinand and I take care of it.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 haddo 04.ogg}} '''Haddo:''' Haha, you and Ferdinand? Together? It would be a miracle for you two to do anything together without fighting.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 ferdinand 03.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Hey! That's between Jeroney and me. No need to add fuel to the fire, okay?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 haddo 05.ogg}} '''Haddo:''' I'm not trying to make trouble, I'm just saying... *cough*
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 klee 01.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Hey, Ferdinand...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 ferdinand 04.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Oh, uh... Don't worry, we're not arguing, Klee. We're just, uh... discussing some things.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Are you and Jeroney worried about Haddo?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 jeroney 02.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Why don't you just talk to him about it?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 klee 04.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Kaeya's also worried about me sometimes, but he doesn't ever criticize me.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' You're right, but our relationship is much better than these guys.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 ferdinand 05.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Uh, well... our situation is a little different.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Really? How so?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 ferdinand 06.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' We've been through this kind of thing before... if we didn't warn Haddo, then he wouldn't take it seriously and something would eventually happen.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 ferdinand 07.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' As his brothers, we have to help him...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 klee 06.ogg}} '''Klee:''' But it doesn't look like you're helping...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 ferdinand 08.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 klee 07.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Maybe Klee doesn't understand everything...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 klee 08.ogg}} '''Klee:''' But my Mommy told me that you help someone to make THEM feel happy, not to make yourself happy.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 klee 09.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Haddo sure doesn't look very happy. Why don't you ask him what he needs?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 jeroney 03.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Klee's right, you know. You three need to open up and talk things through, you are brothers, after all.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 ferdinand 09.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 ferdinand 10.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' I, uh... Ahem, I've always cared a lot about you, Haddo.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 ferdinand 11.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Just like when we were back in the desert... You suddenly passed out, and Jeroney and I started arguing. Eventually, all three of us ended up in this domain.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 ferdinand 12.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' I'm just worried that something similar could happen again. If you were to pass out and with nobody around to help you...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 haddo 06.ogg}} '''Haddo:''' I know, but this domain is nowhere near as dangerous as the desert.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 haddo 07.ogg}} '''Haddo:''' I was thinking that if I could handle these problems myself, then you two wouldn't have to argue about anything.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 haddo 08.ogg}} '''Haddo:''' If it weren't for my poor health and lack of energy all the time, then I wouldn't have always been such a burden on you two.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 jeroney 04.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' No need to feel guilty, Haddo. This was our choice. The three of us love adventuring, no one is a burden on anyone.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 jeroney 05.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' Isn't that why we came up with the idea for this area? I would do the thinking, Ferdinand would use his muscle, and you would...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 haddo 09.ogg}} '''Haddo:''' "Draw the blueprints and build tracks. It'll be a safe way to see all kinds of amazing scenery." Yes, that was the plan.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe. See? Doesn't it feel better to just get along?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 ferdinand 13.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Hey what are ya tryin' to say!? You make it sound like I've only been trying to talk myself up.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 klee 10.ogg}} '''Klee:''' The Choo-Choo Cart is great, Ferdinand!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 ferdinand 14.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Really?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 jeroney 06.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' You know, Klee... Having the cart zip along the tracks was my idea.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 klee 11.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yeah, what an amazing idea. You're so smart!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 haddo 10.ogg}} '''Haddo:''' Hey Klee, do you want to ride even more fun carts?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 klee 12.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yay, let's ride more!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like all three of them are trying to win Klee's approval now.
:{{DIcon}} And Klee is loving it.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Klee hasn't realized it yet, but her innocent, childlike nature is very powerful. It can inspire and even help heal others.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 6 haddo 11.ogg}} '''Haddo:''' Hey everyone, please come with me. We need to get the Hydro Eidolon in the cart to help us.

;(Board the cart after repairing the Torrential Twister)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 haddo 01.ogg}} '''Haddo:''' Good, Torrential Twister is ready to run now. Let's go to the station at the start of the track.

;(Approach the station)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 ferdinand 01.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Haddo and I have double-checked everything, it's all operating safely. You can go for a ride now!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 jeroney 01.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' Hold on a sec... Before we say goodbye, I have something I'd like to give you all.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 jeroney 02.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' It's a rock climbing rope. We used it on our adventures to climb mountains and traverse many places.
:[[File:Zip Along (According to Safe Cart Operating Procedures) Rope.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? But doesn't it mean a lot to you? Are you sure you want to give it to us?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 jeroney 03.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' Yes, of course. Please take it.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 jeroney 04.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' Thanks to Klee and everyone else's help, we realized that there is a special bond that keeps us together. Even though it's invisible, it's even more important than rope, and we can always hold on to it in tough situations.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 klee 01.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Huh? I helped?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 haddo 02.ogg}} '''Haddo:''' Yes, Klee. You were a big help.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Even bigger than that huge thing in the middle of this place?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 ferdinand 02.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Yes, much bigger.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Wow, that's huge! I'm so happy!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 haddo 03.ogg}} '''Haddo:''' By the way, have you ever seen anything like the Choo-Choo Cart in the outside world?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 klee 04.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Nope! Today was the first time I rode anything like it.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 haddo 04.ogg}} '''Haddo:''' Is that so? *cough* I guess I'm not surprised. Seems you won't find {{sic|a Streaming Projector}} anywhere else.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 haddo 05.ogg}} '''Haddo:''' Be sure to come back and ride the Choo-Choo Carts again while you still have the chance.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yep! I will!
:;(Obtain {{Item|Mountaineering Rope}})

;(Talk to Jeroney again, optional)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 jeroney 05.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' Thanks again. I have a feeling we'll get along much better now that we've learned to open up to each other.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 jeroney 06.ogg}} '''Jeroney:''' I suppose some things are simpler than they appear... The real problem all along was actually us.

;(Talk to Ferdinand again, optional)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 ferdinand 03.ogg}} '''Ferdinand:''' Be sure to come back and visit Torrential Twister again... I hope you enjoyed it!

;(Talk to Haddo again, optional)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 haddo 06.ogg}} '''Haddo:''' Hey, imagine if we could build our tracks all over the world. Traveling would be so much easier! *cough*
----
;(After the drop in the Choo-Choo Cart track)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Oh, this is even higher than I expected. The drops are pretty steep, too...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you okay, Kokomi? If you're scared, just yell and let it out! We won't tell anyone. What happens in the bottle domain, stays in the bottle domain!

;(While riding the Choo-Choo Cart)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 klee 06.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Woo-hoooo! Weeeee!!!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like Klee's having the most fun.
----
;(Approach the marked location at the end of the track)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 klee 01.ogg}} '''Klee:''' That's so much fun! Klee can fly across the sky like a real mage now!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Guess that... sort of makes sense?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait &mdash; but if being able to fly makes you a mage, what does that make Kaeya? Since he's here too...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Nothing, Kaeya's just the Master Thief. Don't you remember, Paimon?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh right... Guess it slipped Paimon's mind.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Sorry to bother our young Mage, but there's something the Master Thief would like to report. Do you still remember our mission?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Uh-oh!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 klee 04.ogg}} '''Klee:''' I was having so much fun that I almost forgot...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' We're supposed to be helping Idyia look for the missing components. But don't worry, I've already got one.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' You mean you snatched it when we weren't looking?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Haha, I didn't have to go that far.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' In fact, the component we were searching for was actually that orange rope. If anything, you could say it came right into our hands at the right time. Let's head back and give it to Idyia.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 klee 06.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Aww, do we really have to go...?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 klee 07.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Okay... Even though I want to keep playing, I know Idyia is really important!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' That's our wise mage... Don't worry, tonight you'll be able to see stars in the water and watch fish dance in the sky.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, seems Kokomi's out of it after that ride... Her face is completely blank, and her lip was trembling while she was speaking. Maybe we should have a rest for a while.
:{{DIcon}} You shouldn't push yourself.
:{{DIcon}} We're in no rush.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Ah? I thought I was keeping my composure pretty well...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Don't worry, my mind is always spinning, I'm used to this! We should head back to Idyia.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 klee 08.ogg}} '''Klee:''' How about we hold hands, Miss General? Klee will give you energy!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 kokomi 04.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' (Huh, after holding Klee's hand, the stars in the sky and the fish in the water have all disappeared. I must have been seeing things from riding in the cart... Whew.)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm? What are you smiling about, Kokomi?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 kokomi 05.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Huh? Oh, ah... Ahem, nothing... nothing at all.
----
;(Approach Idyia)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 idyia 01.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Welcome back! Well? Any good news? Ah! Don't tell me! You've taken care of all the problems and now I don't have to do anything!?
:{{DIcon}} You won't be disappointed.
:{{DIcon}} Yep, we took care of everything.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 klee 09.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yeah, we even rode the Choo-Choo Cart! Do you wanna come ride too?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 klee 10.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Uh, but maybe you'll have to wait till tomorrow. I'm a little tired now...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Seems she had a little too much fun and now she's about to crash. Haha, I think it's time for a rest.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 kokomi 06.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Good idea, I think we could all use some down time. Thanks for giving me some energy, Klee.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 kaeya 06.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Then we'll see you later.
:{{DIcon}} Bye, Klee.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 klee 11a.ogg}} {{A|vo yqeq203 8 klee 11b.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Bye, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} Honorary Knight! Bye, everyone!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 idyia 02.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Well, it sounds like our young mage enjoyed herself. I'm happy that she had a good time.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 idyia 03.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' So, back to the missing component. Did you bring it?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You bet! Kaeya said that the missing component was this orange climbing rope.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 idyia 04.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Ah, it just occurred to me that you probably ran into the three brothers while you were in the canyon.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 idyia 05.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' If I remember correctly, the two eldest brothers were taking their sickly younger brother on adventures, when they ran into a sandstorm and ended up here.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 idyia 06.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' They were all arguing with one other when they first arrived, but it wasn't long before they broke down and were huddled together in tears.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 idyia 07.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' *sigh* They sure must have a lot of energy to keep up their bickering and adventuring every day. I'm a little worried about them, yet quite envious of all that energy...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 kokomi 07.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' You almost sound as if you're reminiscing about old friends, Idyia.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 idyia 08.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Yes, I've known them for quite some time, after all... But I seldom go to that area.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 idyia 09.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' You can hold on to the rope for now, {{Traveler}}. I have no use for it until we have the other components.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 idyia 10.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' By the way, Eula and Collei have also returned, but I'm afraid they weren't able to make much headway.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 idyia 11.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' They mentioned that they would like to head to the jungle north of here once you have all rested up.
:{{DIcon}} Understood.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 idyia 12.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Now that I've told you everything, I'll go rest... Uh, I mean, I'll go and check on the situation in the remaining two areas.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 kokomi 08.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Do you need me to accompany you?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 8 idyia 13.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Oh! No, it's alright. You've already accomplished a lot today, you should rest up.

===Klee and Kaeya===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Klee and Kaeya in the Silver Bottle Courtyard, optional)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 klee 01.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Hey Kaeya, you promised to tell me the story about the Jinni-in-a-bottle if I didn't run off. Remember?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Ah, yes. Alright, where did I leave off...?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Oh, I remember! The Jinni came out, and was going to eat the shepherd boy who opened the bottle.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Right, as the Jinni opened its wide, menacing mouth, the shepherd boy suddenly had an idea.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Did he throw a Jumpy Dumpty into the Jinni's mouth?
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Haha, I'm sure that's what he would have done if he had a Jumpy Dumpty.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' But the shepherd boy didn't have anything like that.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 kaeya 09.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' He said to the Jinni, "Wait, how could your massive body fit inside such a small bottle? I won't ever believe it unless I see with my own eyes!"
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' The Jinni became angry, and said, "Mwahaha. Foolish boy, you dare question my powers!?"
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 kaeya 06.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' The Jinni then returned inside the bottle and the boy swiftly sealed it shut.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 klee 04.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yay! That mean Jinni won't ever come out again!
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' But, can the Jinni sleep inside such a tiny bottle? It's probably not very comfortable...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 kaeya 07.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' No, but the Jinni was captured and sealed away in the bottle because it did many bad things.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 kaeya 08.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' So the most important thing to remember is, if you do something bad and don't want to get locked up, then don't get caught.

===Collei and Eula===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Collei and Eula in the Silver Bottle Courtyard, optional)
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Klee said that they discovered some mysterious tracks that you can ride on using a "super fun Choo-Choo Cart."
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Ah, I heard something about that, too. Apparently it's a cart that goes zipping along a "terrifying" course at an "uncontrollable" speed...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Yeah, that should be the one. It seems that when the cart rolls down a steep drop, your body would start floating as if it was weightless.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Really? Huh, I heard that Klee's bag almost flew away on the ride. If Kaeya hadn't managed to quickly catch it, countless Jumpy Dumpties would have been thrown into the air.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh no, that sounds pretty dangerous...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' *sigh* But, if you really want to go for a ride, I'll accompany you if I have time.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Huh? But Eula, how did you know...
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I could tell that you wanted to try it... But let me make this clear, I won't be helping you pick up anything that flies out during the ride. So make sure you take everything out of your pockets beforehand.
:{{A|vo yqeq203 10 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Ah, yes, of course!
