'''Keys to Some Place''' are Quest Items that are used to unlock [[The Arsenal]] in Tatarasuna. The player is required to find 3 of these keys around Tatarasuna in order to access The Arsenal and obtain the [[Diagram: Katsuragikiri Nagamasa]] from within the Luxurious Chest inside.

As noted within the various "[[Mikage Furnace#Records|Records]]" scattered around Tatarasuna, the 3 keys can be found inside [[Common Chest]]s in the area.
