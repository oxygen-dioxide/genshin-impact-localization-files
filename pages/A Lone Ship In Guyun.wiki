===Before A Path Through the Storm===
;(Upon setting foot on the ship)
:'''Angry Man's Voice:''' Wh&mdash;Who the heck are you!? You think you could just come barging in here? Come here, you!
:'''''You arrive onboard the ship...'''''

====Introduction====
:'''Juza:''' You're... the Traveler? What are you doing here!?
:{{DIcon}} Just looking around...
:'''Juza:''' Looking around? You think you can waltz in here and look at whatever you please &mdash; you know what this place is?
:'''Juza:''' Hmph! Forget it, it's pointless... Oi, someone get over here! Tie up this busybody and feed 'em to the fishies!
:'''Yinxing:''' Alright, what's all the ruckus? You pretending to be important when Beidou's not around again?
:'''Juza:''' This troublemaker snuck in here &mdash; presumably up to no good &mdash; and I thought I would just deal with this for Beidou...
:'''Yinxing:''' Alright, stop scaring people. If Beidou found out you were just tying up anyone who came in, you'd be the one being dealt with.
:'''Juza:''' B&mdash;But this troublemaker should pay for sneaking onto the ship, right?
:'''Juza:''' Our ship isn't just for people to come and go as they please.
:{{DIcon}} Yes, I must answer for my crimes.
:'''Juza:''' See!? Even the troublemaker agrees.
:{{DIcon}} How should I make it up to you?
:'''Yinxing:''' Hmm, I have an idea... Beidou has anchored the ship here while she goes into the city for business.
:'''Yinxing:''' We can't leave this ship without her orders, and the rest of the fleet is on patrol at sea, so they can't help us now...
:'''Yinxing:''' But some of the crew has errands in the city that they haven't been able to run. If you really want to make it up to us, go around the ship and see who needs help.
:'''Yinxing:''' You seem to be quite interested in our ship anyway, so explore a bit while you're helping out.

====Offering Help====
;(Talk to Suling)
:'''Suling:''' ...Haven't seen you before. You aren't one of the crew, are you...?
:'''Suling:''' It's been a long time since a stranger came on the ship.
:{{DIcon}} Need help with anything?
:'''Suling:''' I won't ask any random stranger for help. You should leave.
----
;(Talk to Sea Drake)
:'''Sea Drake:''' Who're you? You don't seem like one of the crew.
:{{DIcon}} Need help with anything?
:'''Sea Drake:''' ...I don't need your help with anything. If you aren't one of the crew, and you weren't invited, then I suggest you leave.
:'''Sea Drake:''' Otherwise, someone may make you leave.
----
;(Talk to Xu Liushi)
:'''Xu Liushi:''' Agh! Where'd you come from!? I didn't see you...
:{{DIcon}} Need help with anything?
:'''Xu Liushi:''' I don't have anything you can help with. You should go back to wherever you snuck up on me from.
:'''Xu Liushi:''' Stirring up trouble on this ship won't do you any good.
----
;(Talk to Furong)
:'''Furong:''' Huh... Judging by your clothes. I'd say your the Traveler, right? What are you doing on the ship?
:{{DIcon}} Need help with anything?
:'''Furong:''' You just came to help? Well I don't need any.
:'''Furong:''' You should get out of here. You can't just come onto the ship as you please.
----
;(Talk to Mora-Grubber)
:'''Mora-Grubber:''' Who are you? How'd you get on the ship?
:{{DIcon}} Need help with anything?
:'''Mora-Grubber:''' What do you want? Hmph, if you're trying to rob me, think again.
:'''Mora-Grubber:''' Get out of here fast, or you'll be sorry.

====Lending Help====
;(Talk to Yinxing)
:'''Yinxing:''' Did Juza frighten you? Don't take it personally, he's just like that.
:'''Yinxing:''' He also speaks a bit loudly on account of his poor hearing... but he's really a good person at heart.
:'''Yinxing:''' Okay, so if you aren't busy, think you can help me with something?
:'''Yinxing:''' It's been so long since we've returned to shore, but Juza is making everyone stay on the ship until Beidou gets back.
:'''Yinxing:''' Last time I was in the city, I paid Bolai to buy some supplies in advance for when I returned.
:'''Yinxing:''' Take this letter to Bolai, and he'll get someone to bring the supplies to the ship.
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
::'''Yinxing:''' Thank you.
:{{DIcon}} What kind of supplies?
::'''Yinxing:''' Just some food, medicine, cloth, leather...
::'''Yinxing:''' I really appreciate the help. Please get this letter to Bolai as soon as you can.
:;(Obtain [[Yinxing's Letter to Bolai]])

;(Talk to Yinxing again)
:'''Yinxing:''' The money I paid him last time should be enough.
:'''Yinxing:''' But we still need to get new clothes for Little Yue. He's grown out of his old ones.
:'''Yinxing:''' When will we finally be able to go into the city...?

;(Talk to Bolai)
:'''Bolai:''' It's been a long time. Why hasn't anyone come...?
:{{DIcon}} This is from Yinxing.
:'''Bolai:''' So now you're delivering the letter... What about the guy from last time? He's not with you, is he?
:'''Bolai:''' Phew, that's good... Okay, the supplies are all ready, I'll get someone to take them over in a bit.
:'''Bolai:''' Guyun Stone Forest... That's a long way, I will probably need to hire a boat to get there.
:'''Bolai:''' Yinxing's last payment should be enough to cover it though...

;(Return to Yinxing)
:'''Yinxing:''' Did you deliver the letter?
:{{DIcon}} Yep.
:'''Yinxing:''' Thank you for your help, otherwise I would've had to ask Juza to deliver it again.
:'''Yinxing:''' He'd only scare Bolai, then Juza'd have to come back and drag me over anyway to explain the situation to Bolai...

;(Talk to Yinxing again)
:'''Yinxing:''' When Bolai brings the supplies over, I'll pay him for next time as well.
:'''Yinxing:''' Just in case we can't leave the ship the next time we return to port either...
----
;(Talk to Little Yue)
:'''Little Yue:''' When will we finally be able to get off the ship...?
:{{DIcon}} Need help with anything?
:'''Little Yue:''' Eh? You're... the one who snuck onto the ship, right? I could hear Uncle Juza yelling from halfway across the ship.
:'''Little Yue:''' Did Uncle Juza frighten you? Hehe, relax. He's a good person, he was just trying to act tough and scare you a bit.
:'''Little Yue:''' But... when will be finally be able to go into the city? While Beidou is busy doing stuff in Liyue Harbor, Uncle Juza won't let us leave the ship.
:'''Little Yue:''' Aunt Yinxing had promised to take me shopping in the city, and then I could go play with Changchang.
:'''Little Yue:''' Last time, I told Changchang I would play with her when I got back, but now...
:'''Little Yue:''' You should still be able to go into the city, right? Can you help me out?
:'''Little Yue:''' Find some Starconches for me on the shore. I think... three will be enough.
:{{DIcon}} I'll see it done.
::'''Little Yue:''' Thank you! I really appreciate it.
:{{DIcon}} What do you want Starconches for?
::'''Little Yue:''' I want to make a little gift so that Changchang won't get mad at me for not going to play with her...

;(Talk to Little Yue again before collecting 3x [[Starconch]])
:'''Little Yue:''' When will we finally be able to go into the city...?

;(Talk to Little Yue)
:'''Little Yue:''' Did you find the Starconches?
:{{DIcon}} Sure did. ''(Only available if you have enough Starconches)''
:'''Little Yue:''' Thank you! Wait a sec while I fiddle with these...
:'''Little Yue:''' Aunt Yinxing taught me how to make a toy out of Starconches. Hmm, the next step is...
:'''''Little Yue has managed to make a toy from the Starconches...'''''
:'''Little Yue:''' There, all done! Can you please take this to Changchang for me?
:'''Little Yue:''' I really want to give it to her myself, but... Beidou probably won't be coming back soon.
:'''Little Yue:''' And even when she does come back, we might just set straight out to sea again.
:'''Little Yue:''' *sigh* It doesn't seem like I'll be able to make it into the city this time. I hope Changchang won't get mad...
;(Obtain [[Little Yue's Gift]])

;(Talk to Little Yue again)
:'''Little Yue:''' I hope Changchang enjoys that toy...

;(Talk to Changchang)
:'''Changchang:''' Little Yue isn't back yet, is he?
:{{DIcon}} This is a gift from Little Yue.
:'''Changchang:''' Little Yue is back!? Then why didn't he come over himself?
:'''Changchang:''' Last time he said he would come play with me, but it's been forever...
:{{DIcon}} He can't leave the ship now.
:'''Changchang:''' Okay... He said the same thing the time before last, when a big, tall man brought me a gift from him.
:'''Changchang:''' Nothing he can do about it, I guess. I'm sure it's all because of Beidou again.
:'''Changchang:''' But thank you anyway for the gift. Please thank Little Yue for me as well.
:'''Changchang:''' When my daddy comes back, I'll ask him to take me to the ship Little Yue is on.
:'''Changchang:''' If he can't come here, I can at least go to him &mdash; hmph!

;(Talk to Changchang again)
:'''Changchang:'''  Little Yue hasn't come play with me in forever &mdash; he's so annoying!

;(Talk to Little Yue)
:'''Little Yue:''' Did you give my present to Changchang?
:{{DIcon}} She loved it.
::'''Little Yue:''' That's good. Thanks for your help.
:{{DIcon}} She is going to come see you.
::'''Little Yue:''' Yeah, last time she also said she was going to have her daddy bring her onto the ship.
::'''Little Yue:''' But... Beidou and Uncle Juza won't let any strangers even get near the ship...
::'''Little Yue:''' *sigh* Anyway, thanks again for your help.

;(Talk to Little Yue again)
:'''Little Yue:''' When will be finally be able to go into the city...?
----
;(Talk to Juza)
:'''Juza:''' Where could Beidou be off to...?
:{{DIcon}} Need help with anything?
:'''Juza:''' Ah, it's you! So you actually did go around the ship helping people...
:'''Juza:''' Well I gotta job for you. We just pulled into shore, so we haven't had time to restock on food.
:'''Juza:''' Out on the open sea for so long eating dried meat every day, it eats away at one's heart. It's not everyday we're near port, we best get some fresh food.
:'''Juza:''' But I don't know where Beidou is at, and the rest of the crew isn't to leave the ship. It'd be great if you could bring us some Fowl or Raw Meat.
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
::'''Juza:''' So eager... Okay, I'll leave it to you then.
:{{DIcon}} What about Fish?
::'''Juza:''' Fish? Forget it... The only fresh thing we can get when at sea is fish, fish, fish... We've had our fill.
::'''Juza:''' We want to eat something different now that we have the chance. I'll leave it to you then! Remember &mdash; Fowl or Raw Meat.

;(Talk to Juza)
:'''Juza:''' Did you bring any meat back?
;(Give Fowl)
::'''Juza:''' Wow, this is great! We can grill a lot of skewers of meat with this. When Beidou gets back, she'll have some nice food to chow down on with her drink.
;(Give Raw Meat)
::'''Juza:''' Hmm, we can make steak out of this, perfect to pair with a drink. Beidou will surely be pleased.
;(Give Fish)
::'''Juza:''' Huh?! Looks like you forgot what I told you... If I wanted to eat Fish, I could've just caught it myself!
::'''Juza:''' Forget it, it's edible at the very least... However, Beidou will still need some meat to go with her drink when she gets back...

;(Talk to Juza again)
:'''Juza:''' We should have something nice to eat.

====Report Back to Juza====
;(Talk to Juza)
:'''Juza:''' You lent a hand to so many people on the ship, I lost track.
:'''Juza:''' I'm curious, how did you get so good at helping people?
:{{DIcon}} Just by traveling around.
::'''Juza:''' Hmph, "traveling around"? ...I'm sure there's more to it than that, but I won't press you.
:{{DIcon}} I help people solve problems for a living.
::'''Juza:''' "Help people solve problems"? Hehe, I think I know what you mean by "problems"...
::'''Juza:''' But I understand the rules of the trade. I won't press you.
:'''Juza:''' Take these. Consider it thanks for helping us out.
:'''Juza:''' Well, you're forgiven for sneaking onto the ship. No harm came of it anyway.
:'''Juza:''' But remember if you board the ship in the future, do it properly.
:'''Juza:''' Alright you can go now. I have some work on the ship to take care of.
:'''Juza:''' As soon as we returned from [[Inazuma]], Beidou had us anchor the ship here while she went into Liyue Harbor.
:'''Juza:''' But she's been gone for so long now, it's not good to just be stuck here by Guyun Stone Forest.
:'''Juza:''' I should go into the city and look for her...

===During A Path Through the Storm===
;(Upon setting foot on the ship)
:'''Angry Man's Voice:''' Wh&mdash;Who the heck are you!? You think you could just come barging in here? Come here, you!
:'''''You arrive onboard the ship...'''''

====Introduction====
:'''Juza:''' You're... the Traveler? What are you doing here!?
:{{DIcon}} I'm looking for Beidou.
:'''Juza:''' Looking for the Captain? Does she look like she's someone you just come "looking for" as you please?
:'''Juza:''' Oi, someone get over here! Tie this stowaway up and feed 'em to the fishies!
:'''Yinxing:''' Alright, alright, what's all the ruckus?
:'''Juza:''' This troublemaker snuck in here. Said they're looking for... Well, they're up to no good, I'll wager &mdash; and I thought I would just deal with this for Beidou...
:'''Yinxing:''' Alright, stop scaring people any old how, or Captain Beidou'll scold you upside down.
:'''Juza:''' Uhh... I...
:'''Yinxing:''' Alright. Off you go, cool your head. Now then, Traveler, what business might you have with the Captain?
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to go to Inazuma.
:'''Yinxing:''' You want to go to Inazuma? By ship?
:'''Yinxing:''' Hmm... You'd best see the Captain herself about this. She's on board right now.
:'''Yinxing:''' But it seems that she's been deep in thought recently. Keep your eyes open and try not to disturb her.
:{{DIcon}} I've got it.
:'''Yinxing:''' *sigh* We've also be anchored here for quite a while due to her orders, which has led to quite a few delays.
:'''Yinxing:''' If you're willing, why don't you go around the ship and see who needs help?

====Offering Help====
;(Talk to Suling)
:'''Suling:''' ...Haven't seen you before. You aren't one of the crew, are you...?

:'''Sea Drake:''' Otherwise, someone may make you leave.

;(Talk to Xu Liushi)
:'''Xu Liushi:''' Agh! Where'd you come from!? I didn't see you...
:{{DIcon}} Need help with anything?
:'''Xu Liushi:''' I don't have anything you can help with. You should go back to wherever you snuck up on me from.
:'''Xu Liushi:''' Stirring up trouble on this ship won't do you any good.
----
;(Talk to Furong)
:'''Furong:''' Huh... Judging by your clothes. I'd say you're the Traveler, right? What are you doing on the ship?
:{{DIcon}} Need help with anything?
:'''Furong:''' You just came to help? Well I don't need any.
:'''Furong:''' You should get out of here. You can't just come onto the ship as you please.

;(Talk to Mora-Grubber)
:'''Mora-Grubber:''' Who are you? How'd you get on the ship?
:{{DIcon}} Need help with anything?

==Trivia==
*Despite Mora-Grubber's dialogue implying there will be consequences for opening the chests next to her, there aren't any.
*The name of the ship is the [[Alcor]], which is the flagship of the [[Crux Fleet]] commanded by [[Beidou]].
**[[Xiangling]] is a regular guest aboard the ship, which is why [[Black-Back Perch Stew]], a dish she created, is a reward for completing this quest.
