==Description==
Legend says that after slaying the venomous dragon,<br>
The famed hero bathed in its blood, for he desired invulnerability.<br>
Sure enough, he became untouchable.<br>
Be it swords, be it spears, or be it rain of arrows,<br>
He laughed and shrugged them off.<br>
Eventually, his foes learned:<br>
He had borne his prized greatsword on his back as he bathed<br>
And now, his back bore a great weak spot, the very shape and size of that sword.
