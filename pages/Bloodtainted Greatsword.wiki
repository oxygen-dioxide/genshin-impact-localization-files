==Description==
Legend says that after slaying the venomous dragon,<br />
The famed hero bathed in its blood, for he desired invulnerability.<br />
Sure enough, he became untouchable.<br />
Be it swords, be it spears, or be it rain of arrows,<br />
He laughed and shrugged them off.<br />
Eventually, his foes learned:<br />
He had borne his prized greatsword on his back as he bathed<br />
And now, his back bore a great weak spot, the very shape and size of that sword.

*The lore for this weapon is based on the legend of the Norse and Germanic mythological figure {{w|Sigurd}} (Siegfried), whose body became nigh-invulnerable after bathing in the dragon Fafnir's blood, with the exception of one part. His enemies later take advantage of that to murder him.
