'''Plaustrite Platforms''' ''(unofficial name)'' are interactable objects, which can be seen in [[Liyue]]. They are used for transportation.

These platforms can be spotted in multiple locations, most often for the needs of puzzles, quests or timed challenges, such as at [[Qingyun Peak]], [[Qingce Village]], [[Guyun Stone Forest]] or near the [[Clear Pool and Mountain Cavern]] domain.

==Trivia==
*In the [[Hidden Palace of Guizang Formula]], blue Plaustrite Platforms are encountered, which appear and disappear in a cyclic order.
