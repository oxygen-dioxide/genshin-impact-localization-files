{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Maziar)
:'''Maziar:''' This sure is a busy tavern. If there was a games room in here specifically for games of cards, I reckon business could be better still.
:'''Maziar:''' Oh, my! Sorry about that. I was thinking about how I might combine TCG with my work. Would you like to have a match?
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Let's play Genius Invokation TCG.
:;(Open Genius Invokation TCG challenge interface)
:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to do right now...
::'''Maziar:''' Oh, by all means, go settle your own business. We can play again when you've got the time.

;(If the player loses the match)
:'''Maziar:''' Did you hold back, by any chance? No need to do that next time. I'm always glad to get some experience!

;(If the player wins the match)
:'''Maziar:''' I see, I see! I think I've learned much from watching you play... Thanks a lot!
