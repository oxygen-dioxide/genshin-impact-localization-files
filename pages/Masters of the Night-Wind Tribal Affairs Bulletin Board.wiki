{{Dialogue Start}}
===Introduction===
:'''Tribal Announcement:''' "Everything tribal matter of importance will be written here. Every request you make may also be written down here. Everyone should check it regularly to avoid work delays."
:'''Tribal Announcement:''' "However, remember the ancient decrees, and know that words are only words. To win glory is to do deeds that should be written of, and wisdom is to write of wonders to be done."

===Obsidian===
:'''Tribal Announcement:''' "You should know that tribal affairs contain certain taboos. Act in line with their strictures, and never do anything presumptuous."
:'''Tribal Announcement:''' "Remember to never strike with your hands anything made out of obsidian, especially the sacred pillar and the uncarved stone."
:'''Childish Handwriting:''' "Correct. It's obsidian and imbued with mystical powers. If you hit it too hard, it'll lose that spiritual element.
:'''Unrefined Handwriting:''' "I'm wetting myself laughing over here. What do you think obsidian is, some kind of precision gear? I'd say [[Granny Itztli]] just put a curse on the stone to stop other people from messing around with her materials..."
:'''Childish Handwriting:''' "Oh, so you think you're all that just because you know Granny Itztli? What curse are you even talking about? You don't even understand the basic properties of obsidian, so what is there to even debate?"
:'''Unrefined Handwriting:''' "The applications of sympathetic spellcraft... If you'd listened in class, you'd already know the principles behind taboos and curses."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "You two are squabbling like kids..."
:'''Tribal Announcement:''' "Clarification: There's no complicated reasoning behind this rule. Obsidian just has very sharp edges, and it'd be bad if anyone got cut."

===Spirit Immersion Ceremony===
:'''Tribal Announcement:''' "As the ancient sages say, all gifts come with a catch. Poison in a golden chalice is still poison, so all upstanding souls should stay on guard."
:'''Tribal Announcement:''' "That's what the Spirit Immersion ceremony is like. A person who lacks spiritual sensitivity immersing themselves inside a spiritual object akin to someone who can't swim immersing themselves in water. How will they learn how to swim?"
:'''Tribal Announcement:''' "This method proved extremely dangerous {{sic|method}}, and it was banished centuries ago. Be careful not to put your life in danger."
:'''Granny Itztli's Message:''' "Tsk. Listen up. If anyone gets into trouble, I'll turn them into stone and chuck them outside my door. You'll stay alive, at least &mdash; and I'll treat you once I'm in a better mood."

===Fortune For a Fortune III===
:'''Hornshroom Augery Announcement:''' "Notification: The store owner has decided to embark on a long voyage in search of inspiration and enlightenment. Thus Hornshroom Augery will hereby be permanently closed. Its reopening date will be announced at a later date."
:'''Silken Handwriting:''' "I see, Master [[Chicome]]! You said before that we shouldn't take things literally, so what this means is that we should broaden our investment horizons into something like... tourism!"
:'''Hornshroom Augery:''' "Get outta here, you!"
:'''Silken Handwriting:''' "I understand. I'll get going! I'll make investments based on your oracle right away!"

===Mystical Shards===
:'''Message:''' "I picked up some sparkling clear shards while out on the road before. They didn't look like obsidian, but smelled like some kind of strange grain. There were these mysterious letters written onto them, too."
:'''Message:''' "I think those are Cotan Grapes... or something like that. I've looked through the old classics, but never seen anything like that. Is anyone familiar with this sort of gemstone?"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Where did you pick them up?"
:'''Message:''' "Quite a ways off the beaten path. I think it was near the high priestess Citlali's residence...?"
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "I see. This is something that causes people to lose their minds, talk nonsense, and even start dancing strange jigs. Its craftsmanship can be traced back to ancient times. Don't touch it... and don't drink it either."
:'''Message:''' "What do you mean 'don't drink it'? Anyway, if they're the High Priestess's ritual implements, I'd better return them to her."
:'''Granny Itztli's Message:''' "No! Nope! Absolutely not! It's got nothing to do with me! Just find a random place and chuck it out!"

===Stress Relief Recommendation===
:'''Message:''' "May I ask everyone: Are there any other good ways to relieve stress besides meditation? My mental load has been heavy recently, so I hope you can be generous with your advice. Many thanks."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "I've never seen a case like yours before. How about this: You go find Master [[Matla]], who is a well-trained witch doctor. Tell him your symptoms, and he should be able to treat you."
:'''Message:''' "Thanks for the suggestion, but I don't think that's going to work. You see, I *am* Master Matla."

:'''Tribal Announcement:''' "Descendants of the Masters of the Night-Wind: Just as the sun rises and sets, so too the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]] draws ever-closer."
:'''Tribal Announcement:''' "May our tribal warriors be as hard as obsidian, and may their weapon hands be as nimble as the night wind itself. May they be as mighty as their ancestors, and may they be ever-victorious."
