{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Continues from previous quest)
:{{A|vo fdaq307 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "The Soil Renewed: The Spina Di Rosula Talks Post-Disaster Rebuilding." I recently visited Poisson to meet with Miss Navia, spokeperson of the Spina di Rosula, and we spoke about Poisson's present and future.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Old soil can still give birth to new bloom," Miss Navia stated. "Hope is like seeing a small cookie when you're starving late at night &mdash; you just need a little of it."
:{{A|vo fdaq307 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Skyship [[Wingalet]] &mdash; Boon or Bane of the Fontaine Research Institute?"
:{{A|vo fdaq307 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The various disputes that have arisen on account of Mr. [[Edwin Eastinghouse|Edwin]] have suddenly become a shield over the Institute, with [[Jurieu]] turning out to be a once-overlooked hidden gem.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' People always call the first researcher mad, but few know what to call the second. And should that latter person achieve a miracle, they would find it all the harder to find a word with which to classify him and his team...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, Paimon barely recognizes the people in the reports. Are those really Jurieu and Navia? They sound like real big shots...
:{{DIcon}} They might've been real big shots from the start...
:{{DIcon}} We just didn't meet them in that capacity.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 1 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' What do you think? Pretty enthralling, eh? The Steambird's idea was pretty simple. With the disaster just having passed, we would print a free edition packed to the margins with good news to calm people down.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 1 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' The value for these big scoops lies in their inevitable follow-ups. We'll publish further reports and go into the stories behind those people.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 1 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Edwin's assistant, Jurieu, created a true flying ship, while Navia is leading people in the reconstruction of their home... I'm sure that these stories could draw even your well-traveled eye.
:{{DIcon}} The articles do make me curious about how things will play out...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's curious too... Wait a minute. Didn't we watch everything happen from start to finish? What's there to be curious about?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 1 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' And that's exactly why I'd like you to come conduct interviews with me. You're the best incubators of news, if you haven't noticed &mdash; and also, with you around, I'm sure I'll get to see that Duke.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you sure? Hasn't he turned you down several times already?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 1 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Oh, this time will be different. Come on! Let's head to Poisson first, and then make a trip to the Fortress. There are some things you'll only know when you get there.
----
;(Approach Navia in Poisson)
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Navia!
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Oh, it's you! What brings you all here?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! We're just having a look around!
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I'm here to update myself on how things are going here. Hmm? Oh, the Fatui are here, too!
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Ah, let me introduce you. This is Mr. Gerunt Snezhevich. He represented The Knave in sending us a large amount of supplies, and is helping with our work.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Our residents are hard at work as well. Thanks to everyone, work is progressing nicely. We've lost a lot of people, but we're moving forward &mdash; that will have to be enough.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 geruntsnezhevich 01.ogg}} '''Gerunt Snezhevich:''' Hello, Miss Charlotte. I'm a big fan of yours... I especially liked that article you wrote last year about Fontaine's stray cats.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 geruntsnezhevich 02.ogg}} '''Gerunt Snezhevich:''' But if you don't mind, could you not emphasize our role too much in your report? It's not charity we're doing here. We just happened to share the same interests as the Spina.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I get where you're coming from. I'll keep it as simple as possible... Or would you be willing to feature as "friendly neighbors"?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 geruntsnezhevich 03.ogg}} '''Gerunt Snezhevich:''' That would be fine, thanks.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Oh, you're back, too! How are things?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' We've finished laying down the construction materials. It'll be another hour before the workers are able to go over there.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? You're here too, Clorinde?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, her reputation's greatly risen after that whole duel business with Miss Furina, so she's here in Poisson to wait out the heat... Alright, alright, she really came here to help me out.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' There's too much to consider in the reconstruction of Poisson. The Spina has need of more decision-makers... and well, I do already happen to be connected to Mr. [[Callas]].
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Wait just a moment! Do you mind me asking a few questions? You know, about how you felt before the duel, about what it was like facing down a god... There's lots of exciting material there, I'd bet!
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Forget it. I'm sure you can find a better theme than that, Miss Charlotte.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Ugh, I see you're the same as always... Couldn't you do me a favor, for Navia's sake?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, if we're talking about doing things for my sake, you might as well just take a few more photos of me &mdash; or of {{Traveler}}! It's better than wasting time persuading Clorinde, at any rate.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 charlotte 06a.ogg}} {{A|vo fdaq307 2 charlotte 06b.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Of course I will &mdash; I'm not gonna let {{MC|m=him|f=her}} off that easy. Alright! Then everyone who wants to be in the photo gather up... and smile!
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How did it go? Was it a good shot? Did Paimon look cute in it?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 charlotte 07.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Not bad. Your addition really helped the composition of the picture... Alright, hang on a moment, let me snap a few more shots...
:{{Black Screen|Charlotte takes more pictures of Poisson to the clicking of shutters, and also does some rapid-fire resident interviews...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 charlotte 08.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Alright, that should do it. I'll be back here later, anyway, so let's call it a day.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' You're very quick.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 charlotte 09.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Speed is of the essence when it comes to the news, and freshness is the key!
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 charlotte 10.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Also, not to brag, but I'm pretty good at building connections. Who knows, I might eventually get that interview with you after all, Miss Clorinde.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Wow, you really do have that never-say-die spirit. I'm impressed.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I'll hazard a guess that this is how you got that interview at the Fortress of Meropide.
:{{DIcon}} You already knew she was going?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 charlotte 11.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Whoa, you're well-informed. Let me make a guess, too. I asked Sigewinne, who told Monsieur Neuvillette, and he told you, right?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 geruntsnezhevich 04.ogg}} '''Gerunt Snezhevich:''' That's a... very complete information chain.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 clorinde 06.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' In truth, all Monsieur Neuvillette asked me was "When did the Fortress become so friendly towards the media?"
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 clorinde 07.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I told him that it was best not to speak too soon &mdash; there's no guarantee that Wriothesley will make a personal appearance.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 charlotte 12.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' You're right. I've gotta treasure every moment I have with them &mdash; in which case, I'll be making a move first!
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Stay safe, now! And tell me if you hear anything interesting &mdash; I'll treat you to afternoon tea in exchange!

;(Talk to Clorinde, Navia, or Gerunt again, optional)
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 clorinde 08.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' You seem curious about the Fortress.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Of course! Ugh, that Wriothesley... I still remember going down to the Fortress to grill him for information on my father's case. Boy, did he take me for a ride... without telling me anything, of course.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 clorinde 09.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' But he did invite you to tea, didn't he?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Two large pots of it, in fact &mdash; it was good tea, though.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 clorinde 10.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I have to agree. The tea there is very good.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Ah, speaking of that, would you like to have some today? I mean, you've got time, right?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 clorinde 11.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I'd be partial to some shortbread.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...Wow, it's like we've got a menu, or something... Sure, sure.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 clorinde 12.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Good.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' What flavor of biscuits would you like, Mr. Snezhevich?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 geruntsnezhevich 05.ogg}} '''Gerunt Snezhevich:''' Me? I'm fine with anything... but I would prefer chocolate, should you have it.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 navia 14.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Alright. Leave it to me!
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 clorinde 13.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I'll go over the newly-arrived supplies with you later, Mr. Snezhevich. We should be able to finish the preparatory work today.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 geruntsnezhevich 06.ogg}} '''Gerunt Snezhevich:''' That works great for me.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 navia 15.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Huh. Is it just me, or did you get a new lipstick?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 2 clorinde 14.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I did. It was a gift from Sigewinne. Want to give it a try? I think the color would suit you, too.
----
;(Enter the Fortress of Meropide)
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, guess we're here again, huh? There's a real nostalgic feeling to this place.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 wriothesley 01.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Looks like you've been missing us.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Duke! Did you come all the way to the entrance to greet us?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 wriothesley 02.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Of course. I'm here to welcome you and our dear Miss Charlotte, whom our good Head Nurse recommended to me.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' It's an honor to finally meet the much rumored Duke. Thank you for consenting to my visit to the Fortress, sir.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 wriothesley 03.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' No need to thank me &mdash; but that said, I shouldn't be the focus of your interview. I trust you recall our agreement?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Of course, of course!
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 wriothesley 04.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Alright then, this way.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 jurieu 01.ogg}} '''Jurieu:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 lourvine 01.ogg}} '''Lourvine:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Hmm? Hey, no need to be so nervous. I've already taken all the photos we need.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 lourvine 02.ogg}} '''Lourvine:''' Um... Miss Charlotte... Do these pictures really need to be published on the cover of The Steambird?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 wriothesley 05.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' It would seem that Miss Lourvine doesn't want her face to appear beside that of Mr. Jurieu, hmm?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 jurieu 02.ogg}} '''Jurieu:''' Sir, please don't say things like that!
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 wriothesley 06.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Ah, but it looks like dear Mr. Jurieu denies it. Might this interview be very important to you, then?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 jurieu 03.ogg}} '''Jurieu:''' No! I&mdash;I just... This is my first time being interviewed, and I'm very thankful to The Steambird for...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Haha, now, I might not look it, but I did actually meet Mr. Edwin once, and I'll be honest, I enjoyed chatting with you more &mdash; you've definitely got more of that "genius" vibe going on!
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' The boat that brought about a miracle, the ark that saved the people! Why, you recreated a myth back there, like an emissary of legend!
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 charlotte 06.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' ...Still, if I might ask, where's that flying ship now?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahaha, looks like Charlotte's trying to get herself another exclusive scoop...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 wriothesley 07.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I have to apologize, but that ship is presently in the bowels of our factory. I'm afraid it won't be easy for you to get a shot of it.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 charlotte 07.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Really? Then in that case, could I have an interview with you to make up for that loss?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (She really does know how to squeeze opportunities for all they're worth...)
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 wriothesley 08.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' You already know my answer, I'm afraid. Best you interview our Head Nurse instead &mdash; or perhaps you'd like to take another photo of this couple of researchers?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 lourvine 03.ogg}} '''Lourvine:''' Did you really have to use the word "couple"!?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 charlotte 08.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Well, then, two solo photos will do!
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 jurieu 04.ogg}} '''Jurieu:''' Is my hair messed up? Please, someone help me have a look...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Things sure are getting pretty lively here... Uh, we've seen this kind of thing before...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 sigewinne 01.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Ooh, seems like everyone's here! Would any of you like to try this new drink I came up with...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 wriothesley 09.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Ah, Sigewinne...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 lourvine 04.ogg}} '''Lourvine:''' Ah, uh &mdash; Hey, Miss Charlotte! Why don't you, ah, take some pretty photos of our Head Nurse?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 charlotte 09.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Hmm? Uh, sure! C'mon, Miss Sigewinne, over this way. Let's find a brighter spot...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 sigewinne 02.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Huh? Oh, sure... Do I have to smile?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, how've things been at the Fortress?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 wriothesley 10.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Same old same old, as you can see. Fontaine's undergone some changes, but this place's still more or less the same.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 jurieu 05.ogg}} '''Jurieu:''' Other than that flying ship. It got a tad too much attention, I think...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 wriothesley 11.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' That's why I decided to let the interview go through. We should direct more public opinions toward the behind-the-scenes heroes &mdash; am I right, Mr. Jurieu? Miss Lourvine?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 lourvine 05.ogg}} '''Lourvine:''' You're too kind, sir. I believe that you, too, should have your day in the sun &mdash; not that you would want that, and more's the pity.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 wriothesley 12.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Hahaha, I'll just leave the spotlight to you two.
:{{Black Screen|You walk with Wriothesley for a while and share news from above ground with him...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 wriothesley 13.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I see. Lots of things happened that day, huh? Anyway, regarding that Harbinger, I'm not sure you remember, but his three young followers are still waiting for his return.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He sure did win them over, huh...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 wriothesley 14.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I'll tell them that there's good news and bad news &mdash; the good being that their boss seems fine, and the bad being that they must face extended sentences for abetting his escape.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, actually, what about you? Are things gonna change for you, too?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 wriothesley 15.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' What change can there be? The Fortress will keep chugging along, and so will my duties.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 wriothesley 16.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' As to what Miss Furina's departure will mean for the nation, and if our laws and governance will be transformed... We'll leave those to the folks in the overworld.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 charlotte 10.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Hey, everyone. The photoshoot's done!
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 wriothesley 17.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Good. In that case, let's call it a day here.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 charlotte 11.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Thanks for your cooperation. C’mon, {{Traveler}}, let's go. Till next time, everyone!
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 wriothesley 18.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' There'll be a next time?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 charlotte 12.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Maybe! Who knows? I might write a story about the underwater factory next time. Until then!

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Alright. Last stop, the docks!

;(Talk to Wriothesley or Sigewinne, optional)
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 sigewinne 03.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' *sigh* You know, I'd love to see you in one of Charlotte's photoshoots one day.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 wriothesley 19.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Is that really necessary? Our line of work doesn't really require much photographing.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 sigewinne 04.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' It's precisely because we don't need the pictures that they'll have value as keepsakes. You don't really look all that opposed to the idea, you know.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 wriothesley 20.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Maybe I'm just happy that I managed to once again avoid the spotlight. I think this interview went well, either way.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 sigewinne 05.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Yes, you successfully kept prying eyes away by using Mr. Jurieu and Miss Lourvine as shields. Very good.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 wriothesley 21.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' You should be happy for them. They have a bright future ahead of them.
:

;(Talk to Lourvine or Jurieu, optional)
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 jurieu 06.ogg}} '''Jurieu:''' Here are the interview notes. They mention that the flying ship may have many uses in the future, and the journalist asked me what I thought of them...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 jurieu 07.ogg}} '''Jurieu:''' ...Seriously, how would I know anything about that? Flight is just flight. Whether people want to use a flying ship to broadcast good news or organize weddings is none of my beeswax.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 lourvine 06.ogg}} '''Lourvine:''' A wedding... Huh?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 jurieu 08.ogg}} '''Jurieu:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 lourvine 07.ogg}} '''Lourvine:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 jurieu 09.ogg}} '''Jurieu:''' Why are you looking at me like that?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 lourvine 08.ogg}} '''Lourvine:''' So, the flying ship can be used for weddings?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 jurieu 10.ogg}} '''Jurieu:''' I didn't say that. That journalist mentioned it... And what does that have to do with us, anyway?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 3 lourvine 09.ogg}} '''Lourvine:''' ...True. What does that have to do with us?

;(Approach the docks at [[Romaritime Harbor]])
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon sees them! They really are here. How did you know?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Navia mentioned that she stayed in touch with Lyney and the others after working together. Apparently, they've been at the docks distributing these strange pockets the whole time since.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon &mdash; ah, and Miss Charlotte, too.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Would you like a Magic Pocket?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' What sort of gadget is it?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' It's a wondrous bag that can be used to carry many things. The water level has returned to normal, but if you see any of your things floating around, you can use this to carry them &mdash; or you could trick a friend into doing it for you.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Trick a friend? Huh, I wonder which of my friends would fall for that...?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' You could just make a friend like Freminet here. Isn't that right, Freminet?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Is this what you meant by "I'll help you make some more friends"...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' To be honest, that sounds pretty sweet! Could I have your contact, please?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Uhh... Oh, um... sure. Please, write down my address.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You sure are working hard to help Freminet socialize...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' He was the one who proposed doing this &mdash; he even wants to assist in our magic shows.
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like that would suit him.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Yes, I was planning to first introduce [[Pers]] as an assistant, and later Freminet himself. In the future, I think we can leave underwater escape magic to him, too.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lynette 05.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' That said, would anyone want to see a diver escape underwater?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Oh, it'll work out. Every journey begins with a first step &mdash; he'll become a part of our show eventually.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Lynette, could you come over? Miss Charlotte says she wants to take a picture of us...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lynette 06.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Got it.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' My, that Charlotte is rather perceptive. She got rid of everyone the moment she realized I had something to say to you... So. How've things been, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} I'm doing alright.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' "Father" says that you did a great deal during the latest events. She's very grateful for your contributions to Fontaine.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, that's alright. We were more than happy to help... So, what's she doing now?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Oh, I guess you haven't heard. Well...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' After Lady Furina left, "Father" and Monsieur Neuvillette opened negotiations, during which he gave Fontaine's [[Gnosis]] to her as a "diplomatic gift."
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A "diplomatic gift"? A Gnosis?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Yes. I was quite surprised at first, myself. But when I thought it over, there were actually a number of things going for it...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' It could have been done as an apology for the incident with Lord Childe, or as thanks for his help in tying the [[All-Devouring Narwhal]] down...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Furthermore, "Father" did also lend significant aid to Fontaine and Poisson.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, that's true, but this is a Gnosis we're talking about. Doesn't this seem a bit... irresponsible?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I would agree, but I've also heard that... It seems that Monsieur Neuvillette has had a significant change of heart regarding the matter.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? So there's some reason for this that only Neuvillette knows about?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lyney 12.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I suspect you'll have to ask him about that yourself. Ah, yes, speaking of which, I did see him strolling around the entrance to the Fortress of Meropide a while back.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh. Isn't he real busy and stuff? Paimon didn't think he'd have the time for that.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But back to the topic, the Gnosis was given to The Knave, right? What about Childe?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lyney 13.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' They say that he's returned to Snezhnaya to recover from his wounds. I hear that the recent disaster really did a number on his health.
:{{DIcon}} Well, I guess I can now call him one of my "war buddies."
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's true. When you think about it, we've had loads of run-ins with the Fatui. To think that we'd be allied with them this time...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 arlecchino 01.ogg}} '''???:''' So shocked by such a simple switching of sides?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Waah! Who&mdash;!?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lyney 14.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' "Father"!
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 arlecchino 02.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Well, well, what do you know? Come to the docks to see how my children are doing, and meet the Traveler by chance. Please do not pay my accomplishments in Fontaine too much mind. I would have done them regardless.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you going to... take the Gnosis back to Snezhnaya?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 arlecchino 03.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' That is our duty as Harbingers, yes.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 arlecchino 04.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Don't be too preoccupied with "sides." The goal of the Fatui concerns not a single place or person, but the entire world. With such a grand goal in mind, it is inevitable that we must wear many masks.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 arlecchino 05.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Switching my masks is something I've always done.
:{{DIcon}} Will you keep to your position?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 arlecchino 06.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' That depends on many things, no one truly knows what the future holds. What good is honesty if you can't rely on it forever?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 arlecchino 07.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' As for you, I very much look forward to our next collaboration. Good things cannot be achieved alone, and you've proved yourselves to be great partners.
:{{DIcon}} Actually, I just remembered something... Please help us deliver this.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 arlecchino 08.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' A Vision?&nbsp;... Ha, alright. I'll remember to return it. Thank you for keeping it safe for him this entire time.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 charlotte 06.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' And that's a wrap for me!... Huh!? You... You're...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 arlecchino 09.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Greetings, Miss Journalist.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 charlotte 07.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Ah, um... Hello. If I'm not mistaken, there are diplomatic channels I'll need to report to to take a photo of you...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 arlecchino 10.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' That is correct, so forgive me, but I will not be able to serve as a subject in your article. However, feel free to write as much as you'd like about our dear magicians &mdash; and our upcoming rookie talent.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 charlotte 08.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I&mdash;I will!
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 arlecchino 11.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' The sea breeze is quite pleasant. I shall continue my walk while the weather remains so agreeable. Farewell.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lyney 15.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Farewell, "Father".
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 charlotte 09.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' ...She has such an intimidating presence... I didn't even dare to take a picture... Thankfully, I've already wrapped up all of my prescheduled interviews. Thank you all &mdash; this'll be more than enough for me to write about, I'm sure.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lyney 16.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Don't be too nervous. Why don't you take a Magic Pocket before you go? Here, {{Traveler}}, Paimon, you take one too.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' To move things about?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lyney 17.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That's right. Funny &mdash; I was giving out Magic Pockets when we first met, too, and what do you know? I'm doing the exact same thing right now. So many things have happened, but the Pockets are still the Pockets.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lyney 18.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I guess this must be "life." We will all follow our own paths, and serendipity will lead you to your fated friends.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 4 lyney 19.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Alright then. We'll be handing out pockets in some other districts later, so we'll get going now. Have a good day, you two!

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, guess we sent Charlotte off. Shall we go see how Neuvillette's doing? As long as he's not so busy that he doesn't have time for a chat, anyway.
----
;(Approach the entrance to the Fortress of Meropide)
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The entrance to the Fortress... Ooh, he really is there!

;(Approach Neuvillette)
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you really are here, Neuvillette! Paimon didn't think you were going to have free time this hour of the day.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' "Really"? Ah, I suppose you must have met Mr. Lyney. He took the time to greet me earlier when he passed this way.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' In either case, you came at a good time. I was just considering reaching out to you to set up a meeting, so I may explain some things that I haven't had the time to before.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aww, Paimon's glad that you remembered! Thank you for keeping us on your mind, what with you being busy and all.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, let's have it, then. How was Fontaine actually saved? That whole business is still quite the mystery to us.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...Hmm. It is strange, how words can often leave a bitter taste in the mouth when it finally comes time to say them out loud.
:{{Black Screen|Neuvillette sighs softly, before telling you the truth concerning what he saw that day...}}
:{{Black Screen|"Focalors deceived the Heavenly Principles, and used Furina's endless performance to save Fontaine."}}
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow... So that's what happened?
:{{DIcon}} I only saw Furina's part, myself.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Focalors destroyed the divine throne of the Hydro Archon and restored your power to you, transforming you into a fully-fledged elemental dragon sovereign...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But Paimon still doesn't quite get what you did to save the Fontainians from dissolving.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' For me, the "authority of the ancient dragons" refers to absolute control over the Hydro element.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 06.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Fontainians were "incomplete humans" born of Egeria's use of the power of the Primordial Sea, with constitutions similar to that of mimics...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 07.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' But so long as those primordial energies remain within them, I could use the ancient dragons' authority to grant them true "blood," after the fashion in which life was first brought into being on this planet.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' In other words, when I gave my verdict, Fontainians became "true humans," and thus would naturally no longer be dissolved by water from the Primordial Sea.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Focalors must have counted on you to make that decision as well... Your verdict was the key to making the prophecy appear to have come true while saving everyone.
:{{DIcon}} You could say that it was at that moment...
:{{DIcon}} That the Fontainians were finally truly "born."
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, and in a manner of speaking, Focalors finally managed to fulfill the original Hydro Archon's wish to turn Oceanids into real people, too.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 09.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 10.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' It seems, from your expressions, that you still have more things you wish to ask.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 11.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Ask away. I will tell you the truth as I know it.
:{{DIcon}} About the initial verdict that was passed on Childe...
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12a 1.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I have investigated his case along many avenues, and I have learned that he once fell into an unknown chasm when he was young. There, by chance, he awakened the All-Devouring Narwhal.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12a 2.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' But, whether it be by sentiment or reason, that should not have been enough to consider him the root cause of the disaster. At most, he would have had tangential liability.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12a 3.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' As for the judgment passed by the Oratrice during the trial...
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12a 4.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Whether it was due to that liability by association, or Focalors deliberately using him to buy time for us on the assumption that he would be able to hold the creature off... I cannot say.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 11a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess Focalors had Fontainians in mind the whole time. In the end, it was thanks to her that they finally became real humans...
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 11a 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, hang on a second! Paimon's suddenly got another question.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 11a 3.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Back when Fontainians hadn't yet become real humans, were the children they had also transformed Oceanids?
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12a 5.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Life has always flowed like water. Do you recall how Fontainians would often come to the Fountain of Lucine to pray for children?
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 11a 4.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah. Lynette said that the Fountain is where all the waters in Fontaine converge...
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12a 6.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' In truth, even those couples did not know that such prayers were no mere custom, but instead a form of ritual...
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12a 7.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Those Oceanids who were blessed within the spring water would later descend as new humans in the coming months.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 11a 5.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Paimon... sorta gets it now? Either way, seems like this ritual won't be of any further use &mdash; but it'll probably live on as a local custom!
:{{DIcon}} About Fontaine's future...
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 11b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, about that, Wriothesley said Furina has already left. What's that all about?
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12b 1.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Ah, Lady Furina... The people are only aware that her death sentence has not been carried out. She abdicated the post of Hydro Archon and left affairs related to that title to me, before leaving the opera house.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12b 2.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I related Focalors' words to her faithfully and completely. After hearing them, she seemed neither saddened nor comforted...
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12b 3.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' She simply said that... she was tired, and needed to rest.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12b 4.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Having said that, she then packed her things and moved out of the opera house, not unlike how an ordinary person might.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 11b 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Erm... But she's still got a place to stay, right?
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12b 5.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' You need not worry. I will make arrangements to ensure that she will not want for food, clothing, board, or travel.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12b 6.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' In truth, I am... somewhat happy for her. The wear and tear on her spirit will, of course, take time to heal...
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12b 7.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' But now that she no longer has to play the role of "Focalors the Hydro Archon," she can finally lay down her burdens and lead a normal life.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 11b 3.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What about you, then? What are your plans, now that you've regained your full powers as the Hydro Dragon?
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12b 8.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' After Focalors passed on, the Oratrice also ceased to function.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12b 9.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' This matter will directly affect our trials. After much careful consideration, I've decided to take over its role in our courts. From now on, I shall hear cases and pass verdicts by myself.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 11b 4.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like you're still considering stuff from the perspective of the Iudex, huh.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12b 10.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' As an elemental dragon, there are indeed many things that I must do. But this power, and this duty... In a manner of speaking, you could say that both were granted to me.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12b 11.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' As such, before I attend to my other responsibilites, I must first and foremost continue to serve Fontaine as its highest judge. The duty of the Hydro Sovereign and the duty of the Iudex shall coexist within my person.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12b 12.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Additionally, the Hydro Archon's departure has brought about another problem... Which is that the opera house shall no longer produce Indemnitium.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 11b 5.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's true. That power was derived from the peoples' faith in the Hydro Archon, wasn't it?
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 11b 6.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait. But the various meks and machines in the city are all still okay. Where are they getting their energy from?
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12b 13.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' As I am now, I have full command over Pneumousia, and it can serve as a complete substitute &mdash; another reason why I cannot quite leave Fontaine immediately.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 11b 7.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow. This ancient dragon's authority stuff is really quite useful, huh?
:{{DIcon}} About Fontaine's Gnosis...
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 11c 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, that's right. They say you've given it to The Knave as a "diplomatic gift," or something...
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12c 1.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Leaving aside their intentionality, the two Fatui Harbingers have indeed done much for us during this crisis.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12c 2.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Their sole remaining goal in Fontaine, at least at this point, would seem to be the Gnosis.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12c 3.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' The Oratrice has ceased to function. The Hydro Archon's divine throne is now no more. And I do not need the Gnosis's power...
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12c 4.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' As such, it has lost all meaning for Fontaine.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12c 5.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' If the Fatui have impure designs, then we might as well accede to their request now... and avoid unnecessary conflict.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 11c 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Gah, what complicated considerations... Paimon thought you were just giving it to them out of gratitude to The Knave, and as an apology to Childe.
:{{DIcon}} About the next stop on my journey...
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12d 1.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' You will soon be heading to [[Natlan]], I presume?
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12d 2.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I'm afraid that I have little talent as a travel guide, so I can only tell you all I know about that land.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12d 3.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' As far as I'm aware, Natlan can be said to be "a nation of dragons."
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 11d 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A nation of dragons? You mean, like you?
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12d 4.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' No, I suspect that I would not find myself welcome there.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12d 5.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Unlike ancient dragons such as myself, the dragons of Natlan have undergone long years of development and evolution. Large numbers of them have entered a form of coexistence with humanity.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12d 6.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Natlan is also the nation of "war." War ravages those lands like an undying flame.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12d 7.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' There is one other piece of information I got incidentally from my negotiations with The Knave that I believe may be useful to you.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12d 8.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...The Harbinger known as [[Il Capitano|The Captain]] has thrown his hat into the endless ring of war.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 11d 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "The Captain"... Sounds like a real tough customer. Seriously, everywhere you look, there's a Fatui Harbinger doing their thing!
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12d 9.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I suggest that you fully prepare yourself before going to Natlan. In the meantime, Fontaine's doors will always be open to you.
:{{DIcon}} I have no more questions.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, hang on a sec. Paimon's still got a question about the Gnosis...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' When we spoke to Lyney earlier, he mentioned that your attitude towards giving away the Gnosis had clearly changed...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We guessed that there might be some reason for it that only you were aware of...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 13.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Hmm. No wonder the [[House of the Hearth]] is the Fatui's intelligence division. They are certainly sharp.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 14.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' So, regarding this specific issue, I was just getting ready to share something with you.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... What is it?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 15.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' In truth, I exchanged some further words with that lady named [[Skirk]] after sending you two back to the surface. It went something like this...
:;(In the Primordial Sea)<!-- black screen transition -->
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Well, we're going to head topside to see what's going on. You hurry over soon as well, alright, Neuvillette...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa...!
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 16.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' What next...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 skirk 01.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' Hmm. The All-Devouring Narwhal isn't here, so I'm no longer getting any interference.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 skirk 02.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' I can finally catch the scent of your power... what it's made of.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 skirk 03.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' It is the authority of the planet's primordial dragons, but with something very similar to a god's "curse" mixed in... It's quite a novel blend.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 skirk 04.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' I'm sure I've encountered something like this before. What was it again...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 17.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I do not know what you speak of.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 skirk 05.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' Ah, of course... How could I forget:
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 skirk 06.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' You should have the "remains of the Third [[Descender]]" on your person, yes?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 18.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Remains? I've never heard of any such thing.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 skirk 07.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' Huh... According to your parlance, I believe it may be called a "Gnosis"?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 19.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...Well, that much is true. After Focalors' divinity faded, she handed her Gnosis to me.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 20.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' But I fear I have never heard it described in the manner that you just did.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 skirk 08.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' I've been training with my Master, "The Foul," ever since I was young, and I have never returned to the surface since, so most of the information I possess, I got from him.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 skirk 09.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' It is only natural for those who are greater than humanity to possess a different sort of common sense, which is why there are so many problems in our attempts to communicate with humans.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 skirk 10.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' Regardless, you should probably get rid of objects of "misfortune," to prevent any disasters from befalling you.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 skirk 11.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' To live is in itself a blessing. But once a person dies, the bonds he once had with this world shall all turn to curses.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 21.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' What do you mean by that?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 skirk 12.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' No need to fret. These are just my... personal thoughts &mdash; and my reason for no longer wishing to return to the surface.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 22.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' This Third Descender you refer to. Who are they? And when did they die?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 skirk 13.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' Master never mentioned them to me. Perhaps it just wasn't that important for me to know.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 skirk 14.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' If you're interested, though, I could ask him. I'll be sure to pass the answer on to you next time.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 23.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Next time... You believe we will meet again?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 skirk 15.ogg}} '''Skirk:''' I do... Wait, I have a disciple of my own, don't I? He can be the messenger, then.
:;(In the present)<!-- black screen transition -->
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 24.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...That's what she told me. Whether it would prove useful or not, I wanted to pass that information on to you.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The remains... of the Third Descender?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's what the Gnoses actually are? Paimon just thought that they looked like chess pieces. How could they be a person's remains?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 25.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' All the same, assuming that there was no misunderstanding or special metaphor at play, that is what she meant to say.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And she said that it would bring "misfortune" and that you should chuck it, which is why you gave it to the Fatui...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 26.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' If she speaks the truth, then I would simply be putting Fontaine at unnecessary risk by keeping it here.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (A Descender... She mentioned one of them...)
:{{DIcon}} I am the Fourth Descender.
::{{DIcon}} One, that the Gnoses are related to Descenders.
::{{DIcon}} And two, that the one who came before me has already died.
:{{DIcon}} For me, this information means two things.
::{{DIcon}} One, that the Gnoses are related to Descenders.
::{{DIcon}} And two, that the one who came before me has already died.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 27.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I had already guessed that you might already be familiar with this concept, but I did not expect you to be one of them.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 28.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' That means that the Gnoses, which are exceedingly element-compatible and can even enhance elemental abilities, do indeed come from the Third Descender.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 29.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Hmm, I wonder... Does your body also possess similar properties?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Like... Uhh, like being able to use elemental powers without a Vision? That does sorta count as special compatibility, right?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, no, let's not think about this stuff right now. It just feels creepy...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Comparing {{Traveler}} to the dead Third Descender and all...
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry, I won't die so easily.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 24.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's what you say, but this topic still feels like bad luck.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 25.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Once Childe recovers, let's get some more answers out of him &mdash; or go look for his Master and get the answers that way!
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 30.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I, too, believe it unwise to make too many blind guesses when information is lacking. The same is true of being at court.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 26.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright. Whatever the case, it seems like the crisis here in Fontaine's over for now.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 31.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Yes. All of Focalors' efforts were for this moment as well.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 paimon 27.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But... She sacrificed herself in the end as a god, and she suffered through all those years as a human... Was that really what she wanted?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 32.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...I suppose that would be the mystery of a god's will.
:{{DIcon}} Can you understand the will of the gods?
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 33.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I suspect not. But once in a while, I too would guess that if wishes were the clouds in the sky, they will one day return to the earth as raindrops...
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 34.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Life flows like water, and rain is the final answer. The water levels may sometimes tilt one way or another, but the rain falls fairly upon all.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 35.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' And what, ultimately, is the difference between the rains that fall upon all of us?
:;(Quest ends)

;(Talk to Neuvillette again, optional)
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 10.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' It seems, from your expressions, that you still have more things you wish to ask.
:{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 11.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Ask away. I will tell you the truth as I know it.
:{{DIcon}} About the initial verdict that was passed on Childe...
:;(Same as before)
:{{DIcon}} About Fontaine's future...
:;(Same as before)
:{{DIcon}} About Fontaine's Gnosis...
:;(Same as before)
:{{DIcon}} About the next stop on my journey...
:;(Same as before)
:{{DIcon}} I have no more questions.
::{{A|vo fdaq307 5 neuvillette 12d 9.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I suggest that you fully prepare yourself before going to Natlan. In the meantime, Fontaine's doors will always be open to you.
