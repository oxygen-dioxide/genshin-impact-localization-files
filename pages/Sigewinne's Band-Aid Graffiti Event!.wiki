# Publishing content not related to the event (including but not limited to advertisement links and other means of publicity) is prohibited.
# Travelers are allowed multiple submissions for this event but only one prize can be won per Traveler. The prizes cannot be stacked and only the highest prize won will be awarded.
# This event is held on multiple platforms simultaneously. The number of daily prizes are the total prizes for all platforms. There is no amount of prizes set aside for each platform and region.
# If the same entry wins on multiple platforms, the prize will be issued according to the platform it was first posted on after final verification (only one prize will be issued).
# The official organizers will choose the winning works from among all the submitted works that meet the event rules. Therefore, it is possible that not all prizes will be given out.
# Plagiarism, misappropriation, and other actions that violate others' copyright are strictly prohibited. If there is a quote or a need for authorization, please cite the original sources and make sure to obtain authorization.
# After the list of winners is announced, if Travelers have any objection to the prize-winning works, they can give feedback through the customer support email or in-game customer support. If a prize-winning work is suspected of violating the event rules, we will revoke the prize and this user's account will be permanently banned from participating in any future community events.
# Please ensure that the winning works stay up for at least 7 days after the results are announced so that they can be verified. Those who delete their winning posts within this verification period will be deemed to have voluntarily forfeited their prizes.
# After the list of winners is announced, the winners must submit their prize information within the specified time. Failure to fill in the required information in time or filling in the information incorrectly will be deemed to be a forfeiture of the prize, and it will not be reissued.
