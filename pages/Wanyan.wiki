==Profile==
When the [[Traveler]] initially met Wanyan, the latter proclaimed herself to be an archaeologist. Evidently, this was found out to be false as she lacked even the most basic qualifications for the job. She instead is a follower of the deceased God of Salt, [[Havria]], and seeks to prove that the Geo Archon, [[Morax]], ruthlessly murdered the former during the [[Archon War]].

She accompanied [[Zhongli]], [[Kliment]] and the Traveler in exploring the sealed ruins that held the remains of the God of Salt. Unaware of Zhongli's true identity of being the Geo Archon, she listened in on him while he shared his knowledge on ancient history.

When Kliment was deriding and mistreating Wanyan, Zhongli proposed that Kliment and Wanyan engage in a contract over how to split and share the treasures found in the ruins. Wanyan counter-proposed by stating that he would judge Havria's fate regardless if it hurt Morax's image or not. When the materialistic Kliment broke the contract out of excessive greed, as punishment for breaking the contract, Zhongli and the Traveler made an example of him. Later, they came upon a broken sword and Zhongli told her that she could only claim part of it, much to her surprise as she believed the contract nulled when Kliment broke it. Close to what she believed was the truth, she decided to break the contract.

For her punishment, Zhongli instead revealed what had actually happened: that Havria was a weak god who was killed by her own people as an act of mercy, feeling it perhaps would be better than the agony of defeat at the hands of the crueler gods that would have come for her. Wanyan refused to accept the truth, and left the ruins in shock. However, Zhongli believes that she would eventually come to accept the truth.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Farewell, Sweet Salt}}</ref>
