==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
[[Schubert]], a noble from the disgraced [[Lawrence Clan]], wished to take [[Mondstadt]] back from the [[Knights of Favonius]] to bring the city back under "proper" rule. Sergei was given responsibility over the operation and took an immediate disliking to the noble due to his self-centered arrogance.

Schubert's plot was eventually foiled by the [[Traveler]] and his niece [[Eula]]. Sergei confronted the two at the end of the hideout, but was ultimately defeated by them.
