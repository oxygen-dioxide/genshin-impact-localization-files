'''Sergei''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that is a member of the [[Fatui]]. He can be encountered in the domain [[Behind Enemy Lines]].

==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
[[Schubert]], a noble from the disgraced [[Lawrence Clan]], wished to take [[Mondstadt]] back from the [[Knights of Favonius]] to bring the city back under "proper" rule. Sergei was given responsibility over the operation and took an immediate disliking to the noble due to his self-centered arrogance.

Schubert's plot was eventually foiled by the [[Traveler]] and his niece [[Eula]]. Sergei confronted the two at the end of the hideout, but was ultimately defeated by them.

===Personality===
Like many other Fatui, Sergei is loyal to the [[Tsaritsa]]. He is particularly wary of interference from outsiders due to the Fatui intelligence network, and expresses concern when Schubert brought the Traveler in, claiming that they would aid in the plot. He dislikes Schubert's arrogance and incompetence, as he seethingly complies with the noble's requests.

===Appearance===
