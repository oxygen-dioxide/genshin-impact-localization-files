==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Vilca:''' Next time, you could try using a soft-bristled brush instead...
:{{DIcon}} A soft-bristled brush?
::'''Vilca:''' Yes, something a bit softer than your average wooden comb, better suited to taking care of fur.
::'''Vilca:''' But some Saurians enjoy being brushed to have their fur groomed, but because it feels like a good old backscratch to them.
::'''Vilca:''' In such circumstances, you'd be better off using a wide-tooth comb.
::'''Vilca:''' Trust me, if you're looking to win a grumpy Saurian over, try giving it a brush-down! You never know, it could work wonders.
::'''Vilca:''' Assuming you can get to the point where you could brush it down, of course...
:{{DIcon}} Could I give this a go too?
::'''Vilca:''' Huh? ...Hmm, I suppose that might work.
