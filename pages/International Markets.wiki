==Summary==
;International Markets

As the business continues to grow and expand, Paimon spots a foreign merchant at the potion shop. The merchant introduces herself as [[Atefeh]], from [[Sumeru]]. She explains that the news of the potion shop has been spreading to the merchant community. Atefeh enthusiastically proposes her idea to help them sell the potions all across Teyvat if they can become her regular supplier. The Traveler and Paimon agree with the proposal and discuss about the potions that they should sell. After taking inventory of the potions, Atefeh leaves and will return with the sales result. [[Lisa]] is happy for the potion shop's success and advise them to take a rest if they need it.
