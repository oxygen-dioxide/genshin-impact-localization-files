:'''Little Lulu:''' So what do you wanna be?
:'''Little Fei:''' ...I wanna be [[Beidou|Captain Beidou]]...

:'''Little Lulu:''' That's 'cause I'm a girl and I'm the oldest!
:'''Little Fei:''' But, but I'm the tallest! Boy, girl, it's all the same when you close your eyes anyway!

:'''Little Lulu:''' Okay, okay... I'll let you have a turn being Beidou, okay?
