:'''Little Lulu:''' Ten thousand waves, it's time to set sail!
:'''Little Meng:''' Arrr! The waves be gettin' bigger! Whoa! My booty and plunder is goin' to go overboard! Strap 'er down, maties!
:'''Little Lulu:''' Matey! Matey! All hands on deck! Or else... or else I'll... I'll make ye walk the plank!
:'''Little Fei:''' ...
:'''Little Lulu:''' Matey!
:'''Little Fei:''' ...I don't wanna play anymore. I'm always your "matey..."
:'''Little Lulu:''' So what do you wanna be?
:'''Little Fei:''' ...I wanna be [[Beidou|Captain Beidou]]...
:'''Little Fei:''' Captain Beidou's so cool, but it's always Lulu that gets to be her!
:'''Little Lulu:''' That's 'cause I'm a girl and I'm the oldest!
:'''Little Fei:''' But, but I'm the tallest! Boy, girl, it's all the same when you close your eyes anyway!
:'''Little Meng:''' It's not the same! You don't have the same... feeling!
:'''Little Fei:''' *cries*
:'''Little Meng:''' Oh, now you've done it! Fei is crying again...
:'''Little Lulu:''' Okay, okay... I'll let you have a turn being Beidou, okay?

;(After completing Ahoy! A Pirate's Growth for Ye!)
:'''Little Fei:''' Why has Little Meng decided to go to Sumeru?
:'''Little Lulu:''' Maybe he just wants to have a look around.
:'''Little Fei:''' Really? That's so cool... I wanna go out and play as well...
