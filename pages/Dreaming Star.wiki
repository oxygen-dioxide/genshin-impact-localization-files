'''Dreaming Star''' is [[Layla]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Layla's hair is styled into twintails that twirl at the ends till about hip length. Her fringe is shoulder-length and also twirls at the ends. She sports a gold headpiece similar to a diadem adorned with a star-like ornament. Her indigo "hood" is similar to that of a dupatta drape, popularized in South Asia for formal occasions, nobility, and modesty. Sometimes, it is also wrapped around the waist (which Layla also sports a similar design) or shoulders. It seems, however, that it is modified at the back tip to resemble a night cap with a golden cuff.

Layla's outfit consists of a black tunic with a white front, white tights with gold rings around her left thigh, and golden sandal heels. She also has puffy, detached indigo-colored sleeves. Around her wrists she sports thick gold bangles with star-shaped chains dangling from them and black gloves with golden nail guards on her first three fingers. Around her waist is a long piece of indigo fabric tied together to form a belt with a number of gold details. Her {{Cryo}} [[Vision]] is attached to a spot behind her tunic above her belt.
