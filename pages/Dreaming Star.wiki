'''Dreaming Star''' is [[Layla]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Layla's hair is styled into twintails that twirl at the ends. Her fringe is shoulder-length and also twirls at the ends. She sports a gold headpiece resembling a tiara adorned with a snowflake ornament and an indigo pointed hood.

Layla's outfit consists of a black tunic with a white front, white tights with gold rings around her left thigh, and golden sandals. She also has puffy, detached indigo-colored sleeves. Around her wrists she sports thick gold bangles with chains dangling from them and black gloves with nail guards on her first three fingers. Around her waist is a long piece of indigo fabric tied together to form a belt with a number of gold details. Her [[Cryo]] Vision is attached to a spot behind her tunic above her belt.
