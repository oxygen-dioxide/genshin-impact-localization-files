{{Dialogue Start}}
;(When near the quest marker)
:'''Weak Voice:''' You... What are you doing?
:'''Cruel Voice:''' Fiendish as ever, you rotten little hag, why don't you try asking what your brother did instead?

;(Approach the quest marker)
:'''[["Trendy Zaytun Peach"]]:''' Hand your brother over! That heartless rat's betrayed us &mdash; [[Boss (The Red and the Black)|the boss]] is practically frothing at the mouth!
:'''Blanche:''' H&mdash;How's that possible!? I thought you were all friends?
:'''[["Guileless Wolfhook"]]:''' It's precisely because we were friends that he could betray us, Blanche. This is how the world works.
:'''Blanche:''' But... I don't know where he is either...
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' "I don't know either"? You really are [[Ley Line]]s... absolutely Ley Lines!
:'''Blanche:''' Ley Lines...?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Outdated! Ley Lines are outdated! Ley Lines shall be abandoned! The future belongs to the New Tide!
:'''Blanche:''' I... I... I don't know what you're talking about, but if he did something wrong... let me apologize on his behalf... Just please let me go...
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Alright, sure. Let's take a vote.
:'''Blanche:''' Take a vote... on what?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Whether or not we should let you go, of course. Do you think the New Tide revolves around you?
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' That's right. A vote is necessary when opinions differ. Making arbitrary demands won't cut it. This is also how the world works, Blanche.
:'''Blanche:''' W&mdash;Wait!
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Wait for what? You're gonna vote for letting the guy go, right? Fine. Let's make it one to zero in your favor.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' But the New Tide commands me otherwise. Now it's a one-one draw.
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' Staying loyal to your friends is also how the world works. Sorry, Blanche. I'm with the New Tide on this one.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' One to two! What an extraordinary twist of fate!
:'''Blanche:''' You... scoundrels! I haven't agreed to anything!
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Try to understand the situation, would you, girl? You're just one, and guess what? One is completely useless when it's two against one!
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' Yup. The principle of "majority rules" is not only how the world works, but also a fundamental part of "order."
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Now, you better spit it out! Where is the traitor hiding?!
:{{DIcon}} Do I get a vote?
:'''Paimon:''' And Paimon, too!
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' Oh? Hey there, friends. What a coincidence that we should meet here in the wilderness. So, how will you be voting?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Hey, wait! Who are you two? Don't act like we're friends. Has no one taught you the most important thing is keeping a respectful distance from other people?
:'''Paimon:''' You're one to talk about keeping distance, when you're the ones bothering others! You've got some nerve!
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Hey, calm down, little one. Y'know what, it's pretty cool how you're just floating around! Why not work under me? I'll call you the Trendy Flyer!
:'''Paimon:''' No way! Paimon's friend is way cooler than you... Hey! You're messing Paimon's train of thought up! Let the kid go right this second!
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Haha! You're not part of my gang, so why should I listen to you?
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' That said, it's two to two now... somehow.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Hey, Wolfhook, what are you doing, accepting votes from people we don't even know?
:{{DIcon}} Where's the voting button? Someone help me vote for letting the kid go.
:{{DIcon}} Quit pestering me, or it's no more {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} Nice Traveler for you.
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' Now it's two to three. Another extraordinary twist of fate.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Stop, Wolfhook! I thought we were friends! Which side are you on?
:{{DIcon}} On the side of majority rule.
:{{DIcon}} Or should we let our fists do the talking?
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' The minority must obey the majority, right? This is how the world works.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' What the... Seriously? Why did I even come to you for help? Darn it... Hey, Trendy Flyer, I'll let you win this time, but...
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Listen up, girl! Go tell your brother to get in touch with us immediately if he doesn't want to bite it, you hear me?
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' Goodbye, my new voter friends. Bye, Blanche. Oh, and, if it's possible, please ask your brother to contact us. Thanks.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, they're finally gone. Those two are so weird. Oh, are you okay, kid?
:'''Blanche:''' I&mdash;I'm fine... Thank you... and that floating miss over there.
:'''Paimon:''' Call me Paimon! This is {{Traveler}}.
:'''Blanche:''' Th&mdash;Thank you... I am Blanche. You two must be great adventurers, then? I... I'll definitely visit the Adventurers' Guild to thank you!
:'''Blanche:''' But I have more important things to do right now... My brother's gone missing. I need to find him, but once I do, I will go visit you at the Adventurers' Guild!
:'''Blanche:''' So... Sorry, I need to go. Thank you again!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, wait up! Oh... She's gone... Why is she in such a hurry?
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, let's help her. It's too dangerous for a kid to be out there alone. What if she can't find her brother?
:{{DIcon}} She doesn't seem to want to involve us.
:'''Paimon:''' Must be because she doesn't have money... She knows hiring adventurers costs a lot of [[Mora]]. But those guys won't let her off the hook this easily... So we have to help!
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, how about Paimon pays your fee? You can take it from Paimon's food fund!
:{{DIcon}} And have you asked the food fund first?
:'''Paimon:''' P&mdash;Paimon did...! It said... said, "Please use me how you see fit!"
:{{DIcon}} I don't remember ever saying that.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! You're not Paimon's food fund... Well, you're not just that...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon will fund your food supply once she gets rich! But first, let's stop making jokes... The girl needs our help!
:{{DIcon}} Alright. Staying loyal to your friends is how the world works, after all.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe. Paimon knew it. You were already planning to help, weren't you? Let's hurry up and catch up to her before she gets too far away!
----
;(Approach the cabin)
:'''Paimon:''' Quick, look! Seems like that kid is over there!

;(Talk to Blanche)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey there, kiddo! Why are you sitting here?
:'''Blanche:''' You're the ones from before... {{Traveler}} and Paimon...
:'''Paimon:''' Heheh. Good memory. We're here to help you find your brother!
:'''Blanche:''' Th&mdash;Thank you... but I'm worried that...
:'''Paimon:''' Don't worry! We won't charge you. We just can't stand idly by when someone needs our help!
:'''Blanche:''' It's not that... My brother left me some money. I'm just worried that...
:{{DIcon}} Are you worried about your brother being a [[Treasure Hoarder]]?
::'''Blanche:''' Yes...
:{{DIcon}} Are you worried that we might be Treasure Hoarders?
::'''Blanche:''' No, you can't be...
:'''Blanche:''' You're good people. I can see that... But my brother and those two were... friends.
:'''Blanche:''' I know being a Treasure Hoarder isn't an honest job... I don't want to drag you into their business...
:{{DIcon}} I know how you feel. I'm also looking for my [[Traveler's Sibling|family]].
:'''Blanche:''' Huh?
:{{DIcon}} That's why finding your brother should be our first priority.
:'''Paimon:''' Yup! We'll find your brother first, and then we'll ask him what happened! See? There's nothing to worry about! We're the ideal people to help you! Just leave it to us!
:'''Blanche:''' ...Y&mdash;You really are different. I see... Then, thank you for the help... Here's what happened...
:'''Blanche:''' A month or so ago, my brother happened to acquire a potion formula that could be very valuable. It's said to be the work of the [[Fontaine Research Institute]], and is known as [["Pure Water"|Pure Water]].
:'''Blanche:''' After the Institute exploded, many things were scattered in the wilderness, and my brother often roamed around that area. That's how he picked it up.
:{{DIcon}} He came across it by himself?
:'''Blanche:''' No... Maybe... He might've been with a group of people... But my brother must've kept it for himself...
:'''Blanche:''' And that's why his friends called him a traitor... That's the only reason I can come up with, anyway...
:'''Paimon:''' No wonder those two Treasure Hoarders were looking for him... But why are all of you here? Are there any leads here?
:'''Blanche:''' Well, this used to be the backyard of the Fontaine Research Institute, which was home to various plant nurseries. It's said that the potioneer who created the Pure Water once lived here in seclusion to work on it.
:'''Blanche:''' The formula was written without too much detail or context, and contained the names of some raw ingredients... but my brother couldn't understand them, so he came here looking to see if there were any relevant manuscripts left...
:'''Paimon:''' And then he disappeared?
:'''Blanche:''' Yeah... From the look of this place, it's been long abandoned, with no nurseries in sight. Even this house is empty... Where could my brother have gone...?
:'''Paimon:''' Don't worry, we'll find him. Oh, speaking of which, what's your brother's name, Blanche?
:'''Blanche:''' I&mdash;It's "Tricky Bulle Fruit." He's also one of the [[Fruity Order]]'s operatives.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? That name's... a bit of a surprise... but not really... Anyway, let's try calling out to him from around here.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Tricky Bulle Fruit! Where are you?
:'''Paimon:''' Tricky Bulle Fruit! Your sister is looking for you!
:'''Paimon:''' Tricky Bulle Fruit! Squeak if you can hear us!
:'''Blanche:''' S&mdash;Stop that Ms. Paimon... We might draw the attention of his enemies...
:'''Paimon:''' M&mdash;Makes sense... Sorry! Paimon forgot that we're not the only ones looking for him.
:'''???:''' Squeak!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? What was that? Did you hear that? Paimon heard something!
:'''Blanche:''' I heard it!
:{{DIcon}} Me too.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's look around. Paimon's certain someone's hiding nearby!

;(Investigate the mud)
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, hello? Is someone speaking? Are you hiding in the mud? Hmm, apparently not...

;(Investigate the tree)
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, hello? Is someone speaking? Are you hiding in the tree trunk? Hmm, apparently not...

;(Investigate the wine barrel)
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, hello? Is someone speaking? Are you hiding in the wine barrel? Hmm, apparently not...

;(Knock on the door)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Hello? Did someone say something? Are you hiding inside? Uh...
:'''???:''' Doesn't seem like it...
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, Paimon thinks so too. Seriously... Wait! Y&mdash;Y&mdash;You... Who are you!? You said something again!
:'''Blanche:''' Brother!? It's my brother's voice! Brother? Are you inside?
:'''???:''' I'm not anyone's brother. I just borrowed that guy's voice.
:'''Paimon:''' What!? You're Tricky Bulle Fruit, aren't you!? Stop this act, right now! Your sister's worried to death!
:'''???:''' I told you, it's not me. Come inside and you'll understand.
:{{DIcon}} (Try opening the door.)
:{{Black Screen|You push the door, but the door pushes back. You were hoping that it would open its heart to you, but the lock rejected you.}}
:'''???:''' It's not gonna squeak open! It won't open, squeak~!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Stop acting like a kid! Just hand us the key already!
:'''???:''' Doors come in all shapes and sizes, those that can open have a key, and those that can't go without, just like the situation you're facing right now.
:{{DIcon}} Shall I show you how violence opens all doors?
:'''???:''' The poor world gave birth to a poor child, and the poor child has learned poor skills...
:'''???:''' Violence, destruction, conflict... They shall have exceptionally poor effect on me.
:'''Blanche:''' Brother... No... My brother wouldn't say such things. You're not my brother! Who are you?
:'''???:''' Oh, who's this? What a pure little princess! Ah, even the [[Bluecrown Finch]] would dance for you.
:'''???:''' Allow me to introduce myself. I'm an apostle of the World of Intense Purity.
:'''???:''' I've descended into this darn cabin now, so just call me the Cabin of Intense Purity.
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' As for your brother, that vile man known as Tricky Bulle Fruit, his vileness is beyond your ken.
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' And upon entering a pure world, the vile one found no escape.
:'''Paimon:''' Sorry, a what world, again? What are you talking about?
:'''Blanche:''' My brother isn't that kind of person... Wait, he's gone to another world? Do you mean... he's dead?
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' The world has wrapped itself around him, just like resin wraps around a worm. He's merely trapped.
:'''Blanche:''' D&mdash;Does another world really exist?
:'''Paimon:''' What do you think, {{Traveler}}? Do you believe that? You know better than us when it comes to other worlds.
:{{DIcon}} It's possible.
:'''Blanche:''' U&mdash;Um... Mr. Cabin of Intense Purity, please tell me how I can get my brother back from that world.
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' I merely know how to lead people there, but I don't know how to guide someone back.
:{{DIcon}} In that case, what's your objective?
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' Countless are the wise, but you are the rarest amongst them. I spoke in haste when there were more important things to do.
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' The person is trapped by the world, and the world is infected by that person, and thus has the pure white path fallen into darkness.
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' Therefore, I cannot embark on the road back home, and instead, require your assistance.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh... Paimon didn't think the guy we were looking for was such a big troublemaker...
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' But do not forget that to help me is to help yourselves. Once everything is done, I shall "accidentally" leave a "key" behind...
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' And you shall unexpectedly obtain said "key"... due to blind chance, of course.
:'''Blanche:''' Will that allow me to bring my brother back?
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' I dare not guarantee your success, but this is the only way to the other side.
:'''Paimon:''' What? You can't even guarantee that? Can you at least tell us how we're supposed to help you, then? And no bad stuff, we don't do that!
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' I swear in purity's name that I have never committed any evil, not from the moment of my birth.
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' I only require a few Pure Pinecones. They are all I need to repair the contaminated path.
:'''Paimon:''' Pure Pinecones? Paimon has never heard of those...
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' They are precious fruit planted by a potioneer, and can only be found around this cabin.
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' Why are they so effective, you ask? Why, they are miraculous herbs watered with Pure Water.
:'''Blanche:''' P&mdash;Pure Water!? Isn't that the potion formula my brother obtained!?
:'''Paimon:''' Now Paimon remembers. The potioneer of Fontaine Research Institute. Did he...
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' That previous potioneer is, indeed, the last lucky soul to have visited the World of Purity.
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' If we're talking about the fortune he obtained in that paradise, then it is this thing we call Pure Water. This cabin I now live in was once his residence.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh! So others have been to that world too, have they?
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon was a little skeptical about the truth of his words, but what he said matches what Blanche has told us. The cabin is where the potioneer used to live in seclusion...
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' I always speak the truth. No judge would ever accuse me of deceit.
:'''Blanche:''' Now that we know my brother's whereabouts, I'll definitely find him. But Paimon, {{Traveler}}, I don't want to put you at risk...
:'''Paimon:''' Don't say things like that. We've already decided to help you, right, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} Well, in for one Mora, in for the lot...
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe! Paimon knew you'd say that!
:{{DIcon}} An adventure to another world would be quite interesting.
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe! That's our greatest adventurer for ya!
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' I see. In that case, could you please take this simple test of mine?
:'''Paimon:''' What? A test? You didn't say anything about that! Don't you trust us!?
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' After seeing all of you, and especially after witnessing how valiant this blonde knight is, I took the liberty of inwardly labeling you as beyond question.
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' But to be honest, the Paradise of Purity is no children's playground. If you lack strength, your lives may be in danger.
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' If the princess ceases to be happy, then I shall never be happy either. So, please make a display of sufficient strength, dear knights.
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' It is a power that springs from purity, and it can control the purest source of water in the world. Thus, the people of this world call it the power of [[Hydro]].
:'''Paimon:''' Water is just Hydro! That's nothing difficult for {{Traveler}}.
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' I see you're willing to follow my plan. In that case, let us get straight to it!
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' Please observe these simple mechanisms carefully and light them up with the power of Hydro.

;(Talk to the cabin after activating the [[Water Volume Detection Crystal]])
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' Amazing, Golden Knight. The tiny machine didn't last a minute against you.
:'''Blanche:''' You really are amazing, {{Traveler}}.
:'''Paimon:''' See? Paimon said there was nothing to worry about.
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' Then please find me Pure Pinecones. It's a miraculous fruit born of this place.
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' And please, do remember that I need a total of five.
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, alright, we've got it. Seriously, why do we have to do something as trivial as searching for pinecones?
:'''Cabin of Intense Purity:''' *sigh* I apologize, but I lack hands and feet. I'm just a pitiful, lowly little cabin.
:'''Blanche:''' Let's split up, Paimon. It'll speed things up. The sooner we find the pinecones, the sooner we'll get to see my brother. I'm heading off first, alright?
:'''Paimon:''' Don't go too far, Blanche! Don't leave our sight!
:'''Blanche:''' I know! I'll search over here on the east side.

;(Talk to Blanche, optional)
:'''Blanche:''' I've found one! We can do this!

;(Collect a [[Pinecone]], optional)
:'''Paimon:''' Come ooon, this is just an ordinary Pinecone.

;(Collect a [[Pure Pinecone]])
:'''Paimon:''' How is it this big? It must be a pure pinecone, right? Five of them should be enough.

;(Collect 3 Pure Pinecones)
:'''Paimon:''' That's three... but it doesn't seem like there's any more nearby. Did Blanche pick up the rest? Let's go meet up with her.

;(Talk to Blanche)
:'''Paimon:''' Blanche, how many pinecones have you found? We have three over here.
:'''Blanche:''' I've only found one... But I've searched the entire area...
:'''Paimon:''' We have three and Blanche has one, so that makes four. Five minus four equals... equals... one!
:'''Paimon:''' So we only need one last pinecone. But there doesn't seem to be any nearby... What should we do?
:{{DIcon}} Should we speak to Cabin about it?
:{{DIcon}} Could we substitute it with something else?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... That guy doesn't seem that easy to trick...
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' He! Hehe! Hehehe! Hey, you over there! Your savior, the New Tide, is here!
:'''Paimon:''' What are you doing here again!? What happened to maintaining a sense of distance!?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Hmph! You're looking for those crappy pinecones, right? And you're looking for more, right? Well, I have the rest. You want them?
:'''Paimon:''' Wait! How did you know we're looking for the pinecones?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Hey. Trendy Flyer, do you want it or not?
:{{DIcon}} You've been following us?
:{{DIcon}} You've been eavesdropping?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Oh Ley Lines, is that the only reason you can think of?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Who was it shouting "Tricky Bulle Fruit" all over the shop, huh? The entire mountain heard you. Even children came over out of curiosity!
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' And I'm one of the Five Great Operatives of the Fruity Order. Do I look like a child to you?
:'''Paimon:''' Ah! Sorry, Blanche... Guess Paimon really did draw the attention of your brother's enemies...
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' What? Enemies? I don't have time for this nonsense! I'm here to do business with you.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' I may not have heard your conversation with the person in the cabin, but since Blanche is also helping him, I'm certain it's connected to Bulle Fruit somehow.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Tell me what the person in the cabin said and I'll give you the rest of the pinecones. It's really simple, isn't it?
:{{DIcon}} Or maybe I can take the pinecones from you.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Oh, now you're making me angry. I'm one of the Five Great Operatives of the Fruity Order. Do I look like a child to you? Would I carry such items with me?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph! You wouldn't believe us even if we told you! It's not something an ordinary person would understand!
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Don't look down on me! Ordinary people would never understand the teachings of the New Tide!
:'''Paimon:''' Alright then, if you don't mind being scared to death! That cabin isn't human!
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Wh&mdash;What?
:{{DIcon}} This concerns another world.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Another world?
:'''Paimon:''' Hear that? Unbelievable, huh!? "How could there be another world?" Paimon bets that's what you're thinking right now.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Are you kidding me? Why would I think that? The New Tide is exactly that!
:'''Paimon:''' Wait! The New Tide is a world too? H&mdash;Have you... been there?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' I haven't, but so what? I think it exists. Got a problem with that?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' You should discard all your Ley Line thoughts. Let me tell you this. The order of this world is slipping away, and that's why new worlds are being born.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' This is also why Treasure Hoarders are born when there is an imbalance in wealth. Treasure Hoarders exist to bring balance back to wealth!
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' The Ley Lines have contaminated everyone, and so the New Tide shall be born; the darkness has contaminated everyone, and so a world of light shall be born. That's how things are.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' So yeah, I wouldn't be surprised even if you told me there are other worlds.
:'''Paimon:''' For a person so full of nonsense, you're really good at accepting new things... Anyway, we've told you what you wanted, so it's time to hand over the pinecones!
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Hey! We're not done! What about Bulle Fruit? That's what I'm concerned about!
:{{DIcon}} We've already made our show of goodwill.
:{{DIcon}} Don't push it.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Th&mdash;Then let's both take a step back. I'm not interested in the worlds beyond the New Tide, and I don't want to know anything else either. I only have a single request.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' When you find that darn Bulle Fruit, tell him to come to see me as soon as possible. He knows how to find me. Deal?
:'''Blanche:''' No! If you're planning on harming him, then I would rather never find my brother.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Oh Ley Lines... You silly girl. We're not the ones hunting your brother, it's someone else. Don't you realize that your brother's life is hanging by a thread right now?
:'''Paimon:''' Didn't you say your boss was super mad?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Oh yes, very mad indeed! So mad, in fact, that he's dispatched a very formidable woman named Ruthless Calla Lily.
:'''Blanche:''' Ruthless... Calla Lily? I've heard of her before from my brother. He said that she never fails.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Yes, she's as real as an assassin gets, and the scariest one out of us Five Great Operatives.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' No matter where Bulle Fruit goes, she will catch him in the end, and will either cut him in half or skin him alive. She never fails!
:'''Blanche:''' And you... Are you helping my brother? I thought he took what you were looking for?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Yes, he betrayed us. Betrayal is despicable, but it's also very cool, isn't it?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' I've known him longer than you have, and I know he doesn't take reckless risks.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' We can't allow him to die until we know how he came up with such a cool idea.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' I told Wolfhook immediately after I found out. We need to find Bulle Fruit before that scary woman does.
:{{DIcon}} What will your boss think when he finds out?
:{{DIcon}} This is also betrayal, isn't it?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' That's none of your business, we'll deal with it the New Tide way. Anyway, think about my proposal. I have nothing to hide.
:'''Paimon:''' If what you said is true, then everything looks fine. Paimon's just afraid that you're lying...
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Hey. Unlike Bulle Fruit, I'm no liar!
:'''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;Where did your companion go, then? Where is... What's his name, Wolfhook? Did you fire him because he didn't help you last time?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' How old are you again, Trendy Flyer? If I could hear you when you were screaming by Cabin, surely she could, too! She must be nearby.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' I asked Wolfhook to stand guard in the area. We will not give Bulle Fruit into her hands. Do you understand now?
:{{DIcon}} ...Alright, we'll trust you this one time.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' That's right. Now, take the pinecones. Remember, if you see him, tell him to come to see me at once!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, you just said that you wouldn't carry these things with you!
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' That was a bluff, of course. What was I going to do if you attacked me, Trendy Flyer? I mean, you can fly!
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' What if you dived from above and messed up my hair?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon wouldn't do that!&nbsp;...Unless you're hiding Mora in your hair, or something.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Stop yapping. She'll be here any minute. Wolfhook and I might be able to stall her for a while, but you shouldn't waste your time here!
:'''Blanche:''' Thank you, Zaytun Peach. And thank Wolfhook for me! We are off!
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Oh, go on, move it!

;(Talk to the cabin)
:'''Paimon:''' Cabin! Hey, Cabin! We have your Pure Pinecones!
:'''Blanche:''' Mr. Cabin, are you there?
:{{DIcon}} (Knock on the door.)
:'''Paimon:''' That's strange... Why isn't it responding? That guy didn't just leave on his own, right!?
:'''???:''' Huh? Hurry, over here.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? That sounded like it came from behind the cabin...

;(Go to the back of the cabin)
:'''???:''' Come closer, please, so I can have a good look at you.
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... Hello, are you the one who said that? Mr... Big Wine Barrel?
:'''???:''' I'm not a wine barrel. I'm the Crucible of Intense Purity.
:'''Paimon:''' You're obviously a wine barrel! You look nothing like a crucible!
:'''Crucible of Intense Purity:''' Ah! A princess and two knights, I see. Well, now, allow me to offer my humble greetings to such pure individuals as your august selves.
:'''Blanche:''' Hello, M&mdash;Mr. Crucible, we're here to see Mr. Cabin of Intense Purity. Do you know where it's gone?
:'''Crucible of Intense Purity:''' I do, I do. I've always been aware of your troubles, dear princess, and I've been waiting for the pinecones.
:'''Crucible of Intense Purity:''' Cabin has gone ahead, and it will be able to repair the contaminated path with said pinecones.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, so it's another one of you... Your world has quite a few apostles, huh? Anyway, we've found the pinecones, but how do we pass them to you?
:'''Crucible of Intense Purity:''' Just push them through the hole above me. It is the path that leads to the World of Purity.
:'''Paimon:''' And then? Cabin promised to leave us a "key." Paimon's sure it's mentioned that to you, right?
:'''Crucible of Intense Purity:''' Cabin is a fair and kind person with a good temper. Be it man, woman, or anyone else, Cabin would never allow anyone to offer a tribute to it.
:'''Crucible of Intense Purity:''' Yet you've done Cabin a great kindness, so why would it refuse to part with a single key?
:'''Paimon:''' The people of your world are so strange, and you're so good with words... Anyway, let's put the pinecones in, {{Traveler}}.

;(Interact with the Crucible Top)
:'''Paimon:''' They should be placed here.
:;(Submit 5 Pure Pinecones)
:'''Crucible of Intense Purity:''' Ah, I've missed this pure taste. Now, allow me to fulfill our pledge.
:'''Crucible of Intense Purity:''' Please get a container from over there and collect the medicine that shall be squeezed from the outlet beneath me.
:'''Crucible of Intense Purity:''' When dusk arrives and the sun goes to sleep, drink the medicine, and you shall enter the World of Intense Purity.
:'''Paimon:''' So the medicine squeezed from the pinecones is the "key"... That really is something. But where's the entrance?
:'''Crucible of Intense Purity:''' You, flying knight, may be a master of many skills, but unfortunately, neither hearing nor memory is one of them.
:'''Crucible of Intense Purity:''' The entrance is through the hole above me. I won't repeat myself again.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! It was just a tiny lapse of memory. A tiny one! Hmph! Never mind that. Let's go get our "key," {{Traveler}}.

;(Obtain the medicine)
:{{Black Screen|The liquid pours out of the outlet and quickly fills the container. You have obtained the "key."}}
:'''Crucible of Intense Purity:''' Finally, everything has been done perfectly, thanks to you, pure ones.
:[[File:Item Key (Villains).png|200px]]
:'''Crucible of Intense Purity:''' I'm a little reluctant to say goodbye, but even worlds say farewell, sooner or later.
:'''Blanche:''' Thank you! Thank you Mr. Crucible of Intense Purity... And Mr. Cabin of Intense Purity, who left in advance... Once I find my brother, I hope we can thank you in person again.
:'''Crucible of Intense Purity:''' It's my greatest honor to hear such moving words from you, pure princess.
:'''Crucible of Intense Purity:''' As such, I must give you some personal advice. The World of Purity only welcomes knights. It would be rather unwise for you to go forth into that place, Princess.
:'''Crucible of Intense Purity:''' As for the reason... Forgive me, for I cannot say.
:'''Paimon:''' What a strange rule...
:{{DIcon}} We'll need to think about this carefully.
:{{DIcon}} The two of us will suffice.
:'''Blanche:''' But... I'm the one who's trying to save my brother, so I should be the one taking the risks. If you go instead of me, I'd feel awful...
:'''Paimon:''' It's alright. Even that big crucible said that world welcomes knights. We'll be fine, but it may be more dangerous with you there.
:'''Blanche:''' But...
:'''Paimon:''' No buts. Ask the big crucible if you're still worried about us. Crucible! Crucible!
:'''Crucible of Intense Purity:''' (Crucible does not respond. Instead, it stares blankly at the sky. Or perhaps it's staring at the world, or at you? Who knows? Either way, Crucible offers no response.)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, has it left already? Isn't that a little too soon? Fine...
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, Paimon is sure your brother wouldn't want to see you in danger, Blanche. So, just wait here for our return, alright?
:'''Blanche:''' Th&mdash;Then Ms. Paimon, do you remember what Mr. Crucible said earlier? Let me repeat it for you. It seems to be the only thing I can do.
:'''Blanche:''' {{color|buzzword|Dusk}} is the right time. Drink the {{color|buzzword|"key"}} then and enter through {{color|buzzword|the hole above}} Mr. Crucible to arrive at the world my brother is in... As for what to do after that...
:{{DIcon}} You've been amazing, Blanche! Just leave the rest to us.
:'''Blanche:''' In that case, let's all get some rest now! I'll do the cooking and pitch the tent! I'm very good at it, you know &mdash; my brother loves my cooking!
:{{Black Screen|Blanche's skills are even better than she claimed. You have a nice rest nearby.<br>In the blink of an eye, the right time arrives.}}
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! The sun is setting! It's almost time for our grand adventure into another world!
:'''Blanche:''' I'll wait here for you two. I won't leave until you come back.
:'''Blanche:''' I&mdash;If... If you get in trouble like my brother, I'll find someone to rescue you... I know how to post commissions at the Adventurers' Guild...
:{{DIcon}} You're so nice, Blanche.
::'''Paimon:''' But Paimon thinks you should look for a safe place. There are still Treasure Hoarders lurking around, after all...
:{{DIcon}} You should look for a safe place.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks so too! There are still Treasure Hoarders lurking around, after all...
:'''Blanche:''' No, it doesn't matter if they find me. They want my brother, and only I know where he is, so they won't harm me.
:'''Paimon:''' Still, you should be careful...
:'''Blanche:''' I will. I hope that everything goes your way as well!
:{{DIcon}} Thanks.
:'''Paimon:''' What kind of place will we find ourselves in? Paimon's getting excited!
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}! Take the "key" out and drink it!

:{{DIcon}} Thank you, Paimon. I'm fine.
:'''Paimon:''' Have we arrived in the World of Intense Purity? Why is it so dark and cold and damp in here? It isn't the white, bright, and warm world that Paimon imagined at all!
:'''???:''' ♪~♩~♫~♬~
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Is someone singing? Is anyone there!?
:'''???:''' Hey, knights! You're finally awake. How was your nap?
:'''Paimon:''' Not good... Is this the World of Intense Purity?
:'''???:''' The World of Intense Purity? Pfft! Bahahahaha!
:'''???:''' You actually believed that? Are you kids? How could there be another world? This is hilarious!
:'''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What? We were deceived? Wait... How do you know all of this? Who are you!?
:'''???:''' Don't you remember my voice? Seriously, we're at least partially acquainted, aren't we?
:'''???:''' "You, flying knight, may be a master of many skills, but unfortunately, neither hearing nor memory is one of them"...
:{{DIcon}} You're the Crucible of Intense Purity!
:{{DIcon}} You're Cabin of Intense Purity!
:'''???:''' Hehe! I'm the Crucible and the Cabin both. It's always been me! I've been hiding here, hoodwinking folk. Oh, right. The people on the street know me by another name &mdash; Tricky Bulle Fruit.
:'''Paimon:''' Tricky Bulle Fruit? Y&mdash;You're Blanche's brother! You're terrible! Where the heck are we?
:{{DIcon}} So we're actually inside the wine barrel?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Obviously! Did you really think that you would travel to another world like in those novels?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Guess you Hydro-controlling folk really are as naive as children! No wonder you're an ingredient for Pure Water.
:'''Paimon:''' What ingredient? You plan to turn us into an ingredient?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' You already are. You've been soaking in the barrel for half a day. According to the formula, the power of Hydro should have been isolated by now.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' I wouldn't have been able to mix Pure Water without the power of Hydro you possess. Otherwise, who knows when I'd have been able to restore this formula.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Oh, I know you're strong, but you can forget about breaking out of this barrel. After all, you drank the "key" that I prepared for you.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' It's actually a drug. You must be feeling absolutely weak right now, huh?
:'''Paimon:''' How could you? You sneaky little... sneak! And to think that we were actually helping Blanche look for you! And now you're going to treat us like this, just for that formula?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Hmph! Stubborn until the end, huh? You can trick my sister, but you can't trick me. I betrayed the boss, and the boss isn't kind enough to spare me!
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' You're the assassins my boss sent after me, right? You may be skilled, but unfortunately, your brains are lacking. It's time to become ingredients for my potion!
:{{DIcon}} ...You've misunderstood.
:{{DIcon}} The real assassins are still out there.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Don't even think about lying your way out of this! My sister is the only person in the world who would lend a helping hand to a stranger without expecting anything in return! That's the greatest flaw in your plan!
:'''Paimon:''' What we said is true! Blanche will corroborate it! And we even met one of your compatriots! They're the ones who are really hunting you!
:'''Paimon:''' Wait! Where did she go? Was she in cahoots with you? Did she deceive us too?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Don't you insult her! Don't you ever use that word to describe her! She's purer than all of you combined!
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' That silly girl actually jumped in after the two of you... And I even warned her not to come here... Seriously...
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Luckily, I was watching, and I immediately sent her outside. But her body is too weak, so she should still be unconscious right now.
:'''Paimon:''' Then you'll know the answer once she wakes up. We're really not here to hunt you down.
:'''Blanche:''' Brother!? Brother! You're back! When did you get back? I missed you so much!
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' S&mdash;Sis... When did you wake up? You should be resting!
:'''Blanche:''' I'm so happy that you're back. I had a dream where you were singing to me, and then I woke up to you standing before me... I'm so, so very happy!
:'''Blanche:''' {{Traveler}} and Paimon rescued you, didn't they? Where are they?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' What? Who are those people?
:'''Blanche:''' They're nice people who were helping me! D&mdash;Did they get left behind in that world? Did you not see them? How could this...
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' D&mdash;Don't cry... Have you ever considered that they might've been sent to hunt me down?
:'''Blanche:''' Hunt you down? No way! We met a... colleague of yours earlier. They said that someone known as the Ruthless Calla Lily is after you!
:{{Black Screen|Blanche explains how you met.}}
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' How can this be? She's coming for me? D&mdash;Did I really make a mistake?
:'''Blanche:''' Anyway, if {{Traveler}} and Paimon really have been left behind in that world, then we must rescue them!
:{{DIcon}} Ahem...
:'''Paimon:''' Blanche! We're over here!
:'''Blanche:''' Wait, I hear them! Oh, that's great news! Where are you? Are you inside Mr. Crucible?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, we're inside Mr. Crucible.
::'''Blanche:''' Are you stuck? Give me a moment, let me see if I can pull you out from the opening!
:{{DIcon}} No, there's no Mr. Crucible.
::'''Blanche:''' Huh? There's no Mr. Crucible? What does that mean?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Wait... Give me a moment. U&mdash;Um... Forgive me... I was wrong... I'll release you immediately.
:'''Blanche:''' What? What are you saying?
:{{Black Screen|The young man with orange hair quickly pulls you out of the wine barrel and starts explaining everything to his sister.}}
:'''Blanche:''' Wh&mdash;What... How could you do that!?
:{{DIcon}} The evil consider all others to be evil.
:{{DIcon}} Yeah! How could you?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's gonna throw you inside for three days and nights!
:'''Blanche:''' Brother! Apologize now! Or... or I'll never forgive you!
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' I&mdash;I'm sorry... Maybe you can vent by hitting me? I&mdash;I won't fight back...
:'''Blanche:''' Just do it, {{Traveler}}! He really went too far... I truly don't know how to apologize to you...
:{{DIcon}} Really?
:{{DIcon}} Perfect.
:'''Paimon:''' Give him a good beating! Mess up his hair!
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Go on! Don't worry about hitting me too hard... I'll drink some fresh Pure Water, so I'll be able to take quite the beating!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Are you trying to use this as an opportunity to test that potion of yours? You sly fox!
:'''Paimon:''' Your apology doesn't feel very sincere now!
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' No... Not at all. It's just that if this potion's effects are as the legends say, then I can make another for you. Is that enough sincerity for you?
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Really? That does sound pretty nice! How much Mora is it worth?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' I hear the inferior version of it sells really well in the [[Fortress of Meropide]]... so I'm sure the original will definitely sell for even more Mora.
:{{DIcon}} So you betrayed your companions for Mora?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' ...
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' I have my reasons. If any of them bother you, feel free to include those when hitting me.
:{{Black Screen|The orange-haired young man walks over to the wine barrel, extracts some of the potion made from you soaking in the barrel, and then gulps it all down.}}
:'''Paimon:''' Hey... Wouldn't that stuff be considered our, uh, bath water? Is our bath water that amazing?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Do it! I'm ready!

;(After defeating Tricky Bulle Fruit)
:'''Paimon:''' Watching that beating got Paimon's spirits back up, that's for sure. {{Traveler}}'s hands were icy cold in the wine barrel, and it was all your fault!
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Whew... You really didn't hold back. I'm not complaining, though, I'm praising you! You're really strong.
:'''Blanche:''' C'mon, brother, please, just... stay silent!
:{{DIcon}} So that's all there is to Pure Water?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' No, something seems to be off about it. I've tried the inferior version, but this performed even worse than that. Did something go wrong with the production?
:'''Paimon:''' Ah! It feels like Paimon's 100,000 Mora payday just became a mere 10,000...
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' I've compared all the ingredients with the Potioneer's manuscript, so there's definitely no problem there. Besides the ingredient extracted from the two of you, that is...
:'''Paimon:''' Don't push the blame on us! How could it be our problem? W&mdash;We're pure enough!
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' No! No! That's not what I mean. In the manuscript, that ingredient is known as the "power of water," so I thought it meant Hydro...
:'''Paimon:''' So that's why you wanted to test us with those Hydro mechanisms while you were disguised as the Cabin...
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' I'm embarrassed to say that there may be an error in my understanding... But what does the "power of water" represent? I must figure it out.
:{{DIcon}} Have you forgotten that you're still being hunted?
::'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' I know! Calla Lily never fails... But...
:{{DIcon}} It's alright. We've accepted your apology.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' I cannot stop here. I must... I must finish it... I have no other choice...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't quite get you...
:'''Blanche:''' Isn't the "power of water" just the power of water?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' The power of water? Only Hydro holds power, right? What other kind of power could water hold?
:'''Blanche:''' You've told me so many stories, brother, so you must know that in many stories, water itself is power.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Water itself?
:'''Blanche:''' That's right, just like the story about the potioneer which you told me when I was young.
:'''Paimon:''' The story about obtaining Pure Water from the World of Purity? But... wasn't that just a lie?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' That's the only part I made up... The rest has been passed down by word of mouth for generations.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' They say that there was once a handsome but eccentric young man in the Fontaine Research Institute, a prodigy in potions and alchemy.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' But as the Institute's focus was not on potions and alchemy, and due also to his slightly withdrawn and narcissistic tendencies, he was somewhat ostracized.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Later on, he came to these mountains to live in seclusion and continue his research, and he invented many miraculous potions.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Unfortunately, none of them were preserved, because he poured them all into the ground.
:'''Paimon:''' He poured them all away!?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Yes, that's what the stories say, and that's why he's considered weird. Maybe all geniuses are like that?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' But there was a turn of events later on, and some say that it was the work of the [[Hydro Archon]], who couldn't bear to see those legendary potions just vanish.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' As more and more potions were poured there, they gradually formed a small pond. The potioneer was so amazed by the pond's formation that he sat nearby and admired it all day.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' No one knows if he was indulging in his own masterpiece or his own reflection in that masterpiece of his.
:'''Paimon:''' That's so intriguing! What happened next?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' After that, the young man would immerse himself in the pond all day. But one day, he accidentally slipped into the pond and drowned in his own creation.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Some time later, a little blue and white flower emerged from the center of the pond, its beauty rivaling that of the potioneer.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh... That's such a sad story... Wait... {{color|buzzword|A pond with a little flower}}? Hasn't Paimon seen a place like that?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Are you serious? I mean, I didn't make this up, but it's still just a legend.
:'''Paimon:''' But Paimon really has seen it before... Ugh, but she can't remember where! Do you remember, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} In the World of Intense Purity.
::'''Paimon:''' Hmph! Guess you don't believe Paimon, huh? But she really has seen it, you know!
:{{DIcon}} I think I remember.
:'''Blanche:''' I&mdash;I know! We passed by a small pond like that while gathering the pinecones! There was a little flower at the center of the pond...
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' R&mdash;Really? That's just a story! Are you sure? I never noticed.
:'''Paimon:''' You overlooked all of that because you were so focused on targeting us. That's why only Blanche remembers.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' It seems I really... Sigh, forget it. Shall we head over and have a look? Perhaps the key to the "power of water" lies in that pond.
----
;(Approach the pond)
:'''Paimon:''' Monsters! Careful!
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Sis! Get away!

;(After defeating the enemies)
:'''Paimon:''' It's finally over. There were so many monsters! What attracted them?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' They might have spawned here, which means that there might be some kind of wonderful power in this area.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' You see the little flower in the middle of the pond? It's... just like in the legends.
:'''Paimon:''' It doesn't look that different from an ordinary flower...
:'''Blanche:''' But the dew drops on it are so shiny! They're more beautiful than dew you find elsewhere.
:{{DIcon}} Let's collect some.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Dew drops that have formed by absorbing essence... Maybe that's the truth behind the power of water?

;(Collect the dew)
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' I can feel the power within these dew drops just by looking at them. I have a strong feeling, now, that our next mixture will be a success. Let's go back and give it a try.
:'''Paimon:''' Great! 10,000 Mora now feels like 100,000!
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' I'll start mixing now. Just wait a moment.
:{{Black Screen|The orange-haired young man starts working in front of the console, and a smile of joy soon appears on his face.}}
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' We've done it! We've done it! I don't even need to try it out. I just know! This is so much better than the rip-offs in the Fortress of Meropide!
:'''Paimon:''' Whoo! Our work finally paid off!
:'''Blanche:''' Great! You're amazing! So are you, {{Traveler}}, Paimon!
:'''Paimon:''' No, you contributed the most, Blanche.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Yes, if she hadn't remembered the story and the pond...
:'''Blanche:''' That's nothing, brother. I remember everything you've ever said.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Thank you, both of you, for not holding a grudge. I made two copies of the formula as I promised, as my apology.
:'''Paimon:''' Nice, you kept your word. We'll gladly take it! That said, though, we only need one.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' And there's one for you, Blanche.
:'''Blanche:''' Why? You can just take some. It's not like I'm going anywhere, right?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' No, we can't stay together forever. You have a bright future &mdash; that's not something you should waste here.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Take the complete formula to the new Fontaine Research Institute. If they don't think it's important enough, then go somewhere further out.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Go to the [[Akademiya]] in [[Sumeru]], or [[Liyue]], or even [[Mondstadt]]. Someone will appreciate it enough to take you in.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' You can be like other girls. You can get a good education in school. It's much better than listening to my tall tales.
:'''Paimon:''' Is that why you made the potion?
:'''Blanche:''' No, I've heard you say this stuff too many times! I'll go wherever you go!
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Aren't you going to listen to your brother? Not anymore?
:'''Blanche:''' No, I don't! Not when you talk about this!
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' I don't want to get mad at you. Please, listen to me.
:'''Blanche:''' I hate it when you try to act like a big brother!
:'''Paimon:''' Blanche, come back! It's not safe around here.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh boy, there she goes. Looks like you really made her mad this time.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' ...
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' I don't want her to become just like me... I don't want her to become a Treasure Hoarder! She'll... understand one day.
:'''Paimon:''' Either way, we have to find her. It's too dangerous out there.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Can I trouble you again to help me find her? I can only trust the two of you with this...
:{{DIcon}} She's family, isn't she? Why don't you do it yourself?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' I... I still need to wrap this potion stuff up...
:'''Paimon:''' Still thinking about your blasted potions, huh? Bah. Paimon's got nothing to say to you. {{Traveler}}, let's go find Blanche.

;(Talk to Blanche)
:'''Paimon:''' There you are.
:'''Blanche:''' *sob* {{Traveler}}, Paimon... He's trying to kick me out again...!
:{{DIcon}} He's not.
:{{DIcon}} He just wants you to live a better life.
:'''Blanche:''' Why isn't he here, then?
:'''Paimon:''' Well...
:'''Blanche:''' He must be upset that I'm always so clingy. But I just want to be with him. What's wrong with that?
:'''Paimon:''' Well, he's doing this because loves you. Don't you think he must really regret becoming a Treasure Hoarder?
:'''Blanche:''' But I don't mind! He was already a Treasure Hoarder when he found me!
:'''Paimon:''' When he found you?
:'''Blanche:''' He said he saw me crying on the side of the road when he was out scavenging one day, so he took me in. That was before I could speak and remember things.
:'''Blanche:''' In that case, can't I just become a Treasure Hoarder, too? Why won't he let me? He's so full of himself!
:'''Paimon:''' A Treasure Hoarder... Well... Maybe...
:{{DIcon}} Anyway, let's go back first so he can stop fretting.
:'''Blanche:''' But he's not going to change his mind, is he?
:'''Paimon:''' We'll talk to him. You're his family. Paimon's sure you can work something out.
:'''Blanche:''' I guess so. Thank you both... But please, you have to help me convince him.
:'''Paimon:''' Don't worry, we will. Wait, do you hear something?
:'''Distant Male Voice:''' Calla Lily... I must die, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Oh no! It's Ruthless Calla Lily!
:'''Blanche:''' That's my brother!
:'''Paimon:''' We have to save him!
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' I didn't think the boss would send you, Calla Lily.
:'''"Ruthless Calla Lily":''' Well, I didn't think you would betray us either, Bulle Fruit.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' There are things that I must do...
:'''"Ruthless Calla Lily":''' The little brat you found, I presume?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' How... did you know?
:'''"Ruthless Calla Lily":''' I've had countless chances to make my move, but I don't kill anyone before I figure out what's going on. Well, now I know everything.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' So I must die, right?
:'''"Ruthless Calla Lily":''' It's good that you're ready to pay the price. You did betray the organization for her sake, after all.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Actually, I have something to say. Bulle Fruit made a mistake, sure, but shouldn't we take a vote on this?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' We should have had a share in the formula that he took. That means we should have a say in this, right?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' As such, I propose we put the decision to kill Bulle Fruit to a vote. After all, the minority must obey the majority, right? Isn't that how the world works?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Wolfhook! Say something! Don't you live by that rule?
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' ...
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Why are you so afraid of her? We're all Operatives, aren't we?
:'''"Ruthless Calla Lily":''' Having Wolfhook stall me... You may as well have asked a sheep to stop a wolf. Is your New Tide just tomfoolery, Zaytun Peach?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Hey, leave the New Tide out of this.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' The Fruity Order exists to maintain order and balance {{sic|lost}} in this world! We must not skip the vote!
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' There's no need to vote.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Seriously? Did she beat you silly?
:'''"Ruthless Calla Lily":''' I think Wolfhook understands that my presence represents the opinions of the boss and the rest of the group.
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' Even if the three of us are opposed, it's three against several dozen. And yes, in a perfect world, the minority must obey the majority.
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' But there is one more thing, Calla Lily.
:'''"Ruthless Calla Lily":''' Hmm?
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' I've always treated everyone in the Order like family. Even Bulle Fruit. Even you.
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' Families do not watch one another die, whether at the hands of outsiders or one of our own.
:'''"Ruthless Calla Lily":''' Do you mean to say that you're abandoning your own principles?
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' What I'm saying is that when it comes to family, it doesn't matter who's the majority and the minority!
:'''"Ruthless Calla Lily":''' Looks like I went too easy on you back when you pathetically begged for your life.
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' I'll do whatever it takes to stay alive. But now that there are three of us, we might stand a chance.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Too cool, brother! Too cool! Is this your latest principle?
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' No, Bulle Fruit taught me about this. I've just never applied it until today.
:'''"Ruthless Calla Lily":''' So another one wants to die. Well, Zaytun Peach? Are you sure? Do you really want to betray the boss?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Stop trying to put words in my mouth! I'll explain this to the boss myself. By the way, I'm tired of your arrogance!
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Also, why don't you think about your name for a moment? Is it a fruit? Are Calla Lilies fruits?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' I don't even know how you managed to become one of us. In fact, you're the real traitor! You've betrayed us simply by having that name!
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' I'm gonna show you what for today!
:'''"Ruthless Calla Lily":''' I see that you don't want to live, either. Fine. The Order's cleanup starts today!
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Zaytun Peach, Wolfhook, I'm happy that you still consider me family.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' But... I've been a crook my whole life, and this might be my last day in this world, so please, just let me do the right thing for once.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Stay out of it. This is my problem, and I should deal with it by myself. That way, the boss won't give you any trouble, either.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Are you out of your mind? This is not the time to try to be cool!
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Don't worry, I've replicated the Pure Water, so I might stand a chance.
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' If that's really what you want, then I'll... support you...
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Sounds great. If I don't come back, please take care of my sister for me.
:'''"Ruthless Calla Lily":''' Let's see what you've got.

;(Approach the fight)
:'''Blanche:''' Brother! Don't fight!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh no, they've already started... {{Traveler}}, let's go help.

;(Idle quote)
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' Freeze her! Nice!

;(Idle quote)
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Go for her head! Come on! The head!

;(After defeating Ruthless Calla Lily)
:'''"Ruthless Calla Lily":''' It's my loss...
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Wait! Is this for real? How is she so weak? Did my scolding affect her mentally or something? Am I even that amazing?
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' It is strange. She was way stronger back when she attacked me, but even a child could fight her right now...
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Tell me the truth, Calla Lily! Is my potion too strong, or are you just going easy on us?
:'''Paimon:''' Isn't this because of {{Traveler}}'s help?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Even if we consider that, something still doesn't feel right...
:'''"Ruthless Calla Lily":''' A loss is a loss. I accept my defeat.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' You...
:'''"Ruthless Calla Lily":''' The boss won't come for you anymore.
:'''Blanche:''' R&mdash;Really?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' That's how the boss works. I may not like Calla Lily, but if the boss sent her, then the boss won't pursue the matter no matter the outcome.
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' The Calla Lily who never fails has failed. Guess we're pretty good, huh? Brother.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Yeah, yeah, you're the best, if that's what you want! Either way, you'd better figure out how we're gonna explain this to the boss. Calla Lily is definitely going to tell on us.
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' Hurry up and ask your New Tide for solutions, then! I've been counting on it from the beginning, you know?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' What New Tide? I've never even seen the New Tide! Stop being a kid! Forget it! Let's think about it after we get back.
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' No matter how great she is, she only has a single mouth, but we have two! It's two against one! One is completely useless when it's two against one!
:'''"Ruthless Calla Lily":''' Hmph. Naive idiots. I'm leaving.
:'''Blanche:''' Wait, Calla Lily, Zaytun Peach, Wolfhook. I have something for you.
:{{Black Screen|Blanche takes out a hand-written note and hands it over.}}
:'''"Ruthless Calla Lily":''' Huh?
:'''Blanche:''' This is the formula for Pure Water that my brother deciphered. This belongs to all of you too...
:'''Blanche:''' He wronged all of you, so allow me to apologize on his behalf. I hope you can forgive him. He only did it for my sake.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Sis...
:'''"Ruthless Calla Lily":''' ...
:'''"Ruthless Calla Lily":''' ...I see.
:'''"Ruthless Calla Lily":''' Listen to your brother from now on, girl.
:'''"Ruthless Calla Lily":''' If I had a brother too, I might not have turned out this way.
:'''Blanche:''' Huh?
:'''"Trendy Zaytun Peach":''' Time to go. Take care of your sister, Crappy Bulle Fruit.
:'''"Guileless Wolfhook":''' See you, Blanche. Bye, Bulle Fruit. And goodbye to the two of you too.
:'''Paimon:''' It's finally over, right? Phew!
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' No, there's still my sister...
:'''Blanche:''' No! I don't want to talk about that...
:{{DIcon}} You've got to talk, even if you're siblings.
:'''Paimon:''' C'mon, you two! {{Traveler}} is right! It's always super important to talk stuff out!
:'''Paimon:''' We have long conversations every day, too.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon's gotta touch base with her food fund, after all.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Just... let Paimon have this, would you?
:'''Blanche:''' Th&mdash;Then... Alright. I'll consider what my brother has to say... but I just... I just don't want to be separated from him.
:{{DIcon}} You won't truly be apart.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Indeed, we'll never truly be apart. It's just that you will experience many things while growing up, and we've all got to learn to live independently.
:'''Blanche:''' F&mdash;Fine, but then, you've gotta teach me...
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' Of course. I'll stay with you until you can stand on your own two feet.
:'''Blanche:''' It's a deal, then!
:'''Paimon:''' Alright! So what do you plan to do now?
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' I haven't figured that out yet. Anyway, Step One is to send a copy of the formula to the new Fontaine Research Institute. It can be considered their inheritance, after all. Haha!
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' I might try my luck at the Fortress of Meropide after that. Pure Water sells quite well over there. I mean, regardless of what Blanche decides to do, one simply can't do without Mora.
:'''"Tricky Bulle Fruit":''' The clock's ticking. It's time for us to leave.
:'''Blanche:''' Are we in that much of a hurry? I wanted to cook for {{Traveler}} and Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} It's alright, we'll meet again.
:'''Blanche:''' A&mdash;Alright. If you're too busy, I'll write to the Adventurers' Guild, so don't forget to pick it up!
:'''Paimon:''' We will! Safe travels!
:'''Blanche:''' Farewell, {{Traveler}}! See you, Paimon! And safe travels to you too!
:'''Paimon:''' Phew! Gotta say, Paimon does feel a bit sad to see 'em go, but we've done something very meaningful, huh? Paimon's suddenly filled with confidence toward our future journeys, in fact.
:{{DIcon}} What sort of confidence?
:'''Paimon:''' You thought of your family just now, right? It was written all over your face.
:'''Paimon:''' You'll definitely find {{MC|m=her|f=him}}, and that's what Paimon's confident in! You should have confidence in it too!
:'''Paimon:''' When we see {{MC|m=her|f=him}}, Paimon will help you talk {{MC|m=her|f=him}} around. After all, {{MC|m=she|f=he}} only has a single mouth, but we have two! It's two against one!
:'''Paimon:''' Remember, New Tide said that one is completely useless when it's two against one!
:{{DIcon}} Don't pick up that nonsense.
::'''Paimon:''' Nonsense? Paimon's just cheering you on!
:{{DIcon}} You truly are the Trendy Flyer.
::'''Paimon:''' Trendy Flyer? Paimon's cheering you on, c'mon!
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, take this. It's Paimon's food funds! Paimon promised to pay the commission fees, remember? Hehe, Paimon's super trustworthy, huh?
:'''Paimon:''' What's with that expression? Too embarrassed to say "thank you, Paimon"? That's gotta be it! Paimon heard it, though! That's right, you said "thank you, Paimon" in your heart, didn't you?
:'''Paimon:''' And which case, "you're welcome"! Just don't forget to put more Mora in our food fund from now on, alright?
