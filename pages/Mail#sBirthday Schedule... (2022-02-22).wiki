It's best if everything can go smoothly but it seems that trials and setbacks are an inevitable part of life.

If you have any troubles, come talk to me.

I promise I will not give any strategic orders or advice, but listen and share my insights as a friend.

Take myself for example. Even with a lack of energy, I try not to crawl into books every time. On a day like this, I would prefer to go diving in the sea.

Being gently embraced by the sea, facing the endless blue sky and the dancing fish... No matter what your troubles are, they will all disappear in that moment.

I hope to share this joy with you.

Rather... I'm looking forward to seeing you.
