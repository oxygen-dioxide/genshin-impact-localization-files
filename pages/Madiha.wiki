{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Madiha:''' My most important partners, you're back! How did the Barking Fox's controls feel to you? Was the flight envelope broad enough?
:{{DIcon}} Haha, it's pretty impressive!
::'''Paimon:''' The Barking Fox wasn't difficult to control at all! It was actually pretty fun! But about that technical jargon of yours... Paimon doesn't know how to answer that!
::'''Madiha:''' Hmm... Your response would be best classified into the "user could not accurately describe their feedback" category &mdash; but that's pretty common and not a big deal at all!
::'''Madiha:''' No matter how many tries it takes, as long as you complete the test challenges without making personal modifications to the Barking Fox, then its flight performance is at the expected level!
::'''Paimon:''' Personal modifications?
::'''Paimon:''' That sounds complicated! {{Traveler}} doesn't understand anything like that either!
::{{DIcon}} I can learn. For Paimon.
::{{DIcon}} I'll make Paimon a jetpack!
::'''Paimon:''' Pass! Paimon doesn't fight monsters in the sky, so speed is useless to Paimon!
::'''Paimon:''' And if Paimon is too fast, you'll never be able to keep up!
::'''Paimon:''' Even if Paimon races ahead and waits for you, you'll have no one to talk to, eat with, or enjoy the scenery with while catching up... And that sounds really sad!
::'''Paimon:''' What's the point if we can't travel together!?
::{{DIcon}} Exactly!
::{{DIcon}} *sobs* Paimon would never abandon me!
::'''Madiha:''' You were presented with the chance to speed through the air, yet you refuse to move forward without your companion... Ohh, I feel deeply moved by your conversation!
::'''Madiha:''' How about you two invest a bit more in me...? Hmm, yes, I think around 60 million Mora should do it!
::'''Madiha:''' I can develop... an assistive propulsion jetpack for your wind glider, and create a miniature version for you!
::'''Madiha:''' It will only take a little over a decade or so! Once it's done, you can zoom through the sky together!
::'''Paimon:''' Eek! How did this suddenly become about Mora!? And not only are you asking us for so much, you also want us to wait a decade!?
::'''Paimon:''' You just barely finished a small flying toy, and now you're talking about a huge device to help people fly? Can you really do that?
::'''Madiha:''' Of course! Just put your trust in me, the Phantom Toy Master!
::{{DIcon}} Then we'll use our share of the profits as the deposit!
::{{DIcon}} Make a prototype first, then we can talk about investing!
::'''Paimon:''' That's a great idea! Madiha said the Barking Fox will sell really well, so earning a mountain of Mora should be a piece of cake!
::'''Paimon:''' *ahem* Phantom Toy Master, we're your most important partners! You said the Barking Fox will sell really well, and we have such a huge cut...
::'''Paimon:''' Maybe you'll be the one owing us 60 million Mora next year... maybe even more!
::'''Paimon:''' But the proof's in the pudding! Make us prototypes first, and if Paimon and {{Traveler}} are satisfied, we'll consider reducing the amount you owe us!
::'''Madiha:''' Y-You're actually using business lingo to respond in kind! Curses!
::'''Madiha:''' Th-Then we'll wait until the Barking Fox goes on sale and see how it does! There's no need to worry!
::'''Madiha:''' Don't worry about what I just said! In fact, if you just forget about it, that's fine by me!
:{{DIcon}} It wasn't good enough!
::'''Paimon:''' Huh? Really? Paimon thought it was okay...
::'''Paimon:''' Looks like {{Traveler}}'s become a harsh critic after testing so many people's inventions.
::'''Madiha:''' Negative feedback!? I can't believe it... Could you please tell me what's wrong?
::{{DIcon}} It's too slow...
::{{DIcon}} It isn't maneuverable enough...
::{{DIcon}} I dunno, but it just isn't good...
::'''Madiha:''' Ugh, I should have expected this. Demanding users who can't even describe their problem... I don't know where to start...
::'''Madiha:''' I have to make sure our advertisements don't target such customers...
::'''Madiha:''' Uh... *ahem* That's not what I meant! Anyway, let me have a look myself! And thank you for your feedback!
:{{DIcon}} Maybe we should talk about you instead...
::'''Paimon:''' Oh, right! If you call yourself the Phantom Toy Master, you must have really amazing... um... design experience? Is that how you say it?
::'''Paimon:''' And you seem to know all about... investments? You're always talking about huge sums of Mora! You must have made a ton of money before!
::'''Madiha:''' Uh! Um! Ah!
::'''Madiha:''' E&mdash;Emotional damage!
::'''Paimon:''' What's wrong!? You look like you're about to die of pain!
::'''Madiha:''' No! I will never die of anguish! If I am to die... I will die extremely wealthy, due to overindulging in every luxury imaginable!
::'''Madiha:''' Only the regret of missing out on a business opportunity can harm me! I even survived traveling on foot in the desert... for three whole months!
::'''Madiha:''' Those awful debt collectors who forced me to flee into the desert will never understand! But mark my words, my innovations will one day be turned into Mora!
::{{DIcon}} So you owe a lot of money.
::{{DIcon}} You're under a mountain of debt.
::'''Madiha:''' No! Don't say such vulgar things! I just... I just had a lot of... unexpected expenses due to trial and error while exploring the boundlessly fantastical secrets of toys!
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon finally understands Madiha's situation... and what "Phantom Toy Master" actually means...
::'''Madiha:''' You two have good instincts when it comes to people! You were willing to partner with me and provide a long-term source of capital... You'll definitely get a thousand percent return once I rise to the top!
::'''Madiha:''' So why don't we take this opportunity to give our future toy empire an additional boost...
::'''Paimon:''' Stop right there! If you ask us for money, we won't give you any!
::{{DIcon}} Not a single Mora!
::{{DIcon}} We're very poor!
::'''Paimon:''' That's right! We're super broke!
::'''Paimon:''' Okay, we shouldn't say that... it's not that bad! But we have a really long journey ahead of us, and we have no idea how much Mora it'll cost!
::'''Paimon:''' After all, we worked hard and took a long time to earn our Mora, and we would have been starving on the streets long ago if we gave it away to just anyone...
::'''Madiha:''' Wow... Such cautious investors! Does this mean funding is drying up again...? But that's fine!
::'''Madiha:''' Just don't regret it! The earlier you invest, the higher your cut! The minimum investment will be much higher in the future!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye for now!
::'''Madiha:''' Huh!? You still haven't gotten enough? That means flying the Barking Fox is really fun! That's great! It's a design success!
