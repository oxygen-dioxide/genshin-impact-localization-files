<section begin="Description" />The '''Latin-Based Language''' (''unofficial name''), popularly known as the '''Abyss Language''' (''unofficial name''), can be found all over [[Teyvat]], usually in inscriptions such as those relating to [[god]]s, [[alchemy]], astrology, and in association with [[Ley Line]]s; it also appears when magical seals appear, such as on some chests. Notably, it is used by the [[Khaenri'ah|Khaenriahn]] [[Abyss Order]], in [[Natlan]]'s [[Ancient Name]]s, and in ancient murals in [[Dragonspine]] and [[Tsurumi Island]], indicating it may have been the alphabet of the ancient unified civilization which once spanned Teyvat. The alphabet is based on {{w|Latin alphabet|Latin letters}} like the common written language of Teyvat, but the words and grammar are based on {{w|Classical Latin}} instead of English. Although there is no capitalization, there is punctuation.<ref>NGA: [https://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=23604939 Deciphering of the Khaenri'ah Alphabet] (Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/j5muhi/translationthe_deciphering_of_the_khaenriah/ English translation])</ref><section end="Description" />

==Special Forms==
The glyphs of this alphabet are divided into top and bottom halves by a thin but deliberate gap. Typically, the full glyph is used, however in some cases, only half of the glyph is shown or only half of the glyph is relevant.
* The event menu for [[Unreconciled Stars]] uses only the bottom half of the glyphs.

* In the [[Secret Messages in The Chasm|secret messages]] found in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]], only the bottom half of the glyphs should be read:<ref group="Note">The top half of the glyph is changed systematically. Specifically, the alphabet is divided into five-letter sets (with six letters for the last set) and first letter of the set uses an inverted top half of the last letter of the set, the second letter of the set uses an inverted top half of the second-last letter of the set, and so on. This results in, for example, the letters A, B, C, D, and E having an inverted top half of the letters E, D, C, B, and A for their top halves respectively, while the bottom halves remain the same.</ref>
