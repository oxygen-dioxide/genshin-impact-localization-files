|description    = An office with a solemn air that accurately reproduces the office of the Fortress of Meropide's "Duke."
They say that after the Duke took over the Fortress, he only changed a few small office furnishings, and otherwise left the place alone — this, then, was the type of office in which the regulations the many inmates must follow were written up.
