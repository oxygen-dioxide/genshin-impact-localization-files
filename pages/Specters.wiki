{{Description|A monster born from highly-concentrated elements that can float in the air.<br />On the whole, they are little spirits that have a gentle temperament, much like Slimes, but they can sometimes explode into a rage.}}
'''Specters''' are [[Common Enemies]] found in [[Inazuma]]. They float in the air and have what appears to be a single eye.

==Strategy==
Like [[slimes]], specters are immune to their corresponding element; however, specters do not [[Gauge Unit Theory/Auras|apply]] the element onto themselves.

Specters also come with a "[[Fury|Rage]]" mechanic which fills when they take a heavy hit. The minimum amount required to accumulate rage scales on the specter's level. As they accumulate rage, they begin to grow larger; once at max rage, their attacks become enhanced.<ref>HoYoverse News: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/15228 The Inazuma Diaries: Watatsumi Island & Seirai Island]</ref>

Specters are often a hassle when fighting with melee characters due to their tendency to float away from the player; in worst-case scenarios, the specter may end up unintentionally floating above a melee character's reach, so ranged characters are generally better against them.

Specters are immune to [[Vacuum Field]] effects if they're fully enraged. They are also immune to drowning regardless of state.

When killed, the specter will charge up briefly before exploding and dealing elemental AoE damage of their affiliation to a small area around it. If they were at max rage when killed, the attack is enhanced. This explosion occurs regardless if they are defeated in a [[Frozen]] or Petrified state.

==Trivia==
*Specters do not trigger the passive effects of various talents or weapons that require the player to kill an enemy. For example, the ATK% boost from the [[Blackcliff Series]] is not granted upon killing a specter.<ref>KeqingMains Theorycrafting Library: [https://library.keqingmains.com/evidence/combat-mechanics/enemy-mechanics/enemy-interactions#specter-defeat-interaction Specter Defeat Interaction]</ref>
*Specters are considered pests on [[Watatsumi Island]], as [[Kokomi]] has a Specter Eco-Management group.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Three Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve}}</ref>
