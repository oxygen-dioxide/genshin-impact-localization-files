|effect       = If you can stay within the Ideal Tension Zone while fishing, this rod will shorten the time in which fish will struggle by a stable amount and increase your chances of success. This effect only works in [[Liyue]].
|description  = A long rod that stands like elegant bamboo. It is said to have been constructed and kept by a skilled hermit from Liyue, and it was first discovered on a stone tablet with the following words carved upon it: "O you who aspire, take up this rod," like a legendary sword waiting for a hero to pull it out. Of course, you only ever hear this glorious origin story from the mouths of merchants, so it may just be some rhetoric used to increase the item's value... But those who know this and still use this rod can only be those who are ready and willing to accept this pact.

==Trivia==
*The Chinese name of the rod {{Lang|Yuànzhě|zh=愿者|zh_tl=Wisher}} likely comes from the Chinese idiom {{Lang|"Grand Duke Jiang goes fishing, and then one who wishes takes the bait"|zh=姜太公钓鱼，愿者上钩|zh_rm=Jiāng Tài Gōng diào yú, yuàn zhě shàng gōu}}, figuratively referring to a person who willingly falls into a trap.
**"Wishmaker" in this case refers to {{w|King Wen of Zhou}} (1112–1050 BC), who has been traditionally revered as a holy ruler by Confucianism as the father of King Wu, the founder of the Zhou dynasty. Legends say the great strategist {{w|Jiang Ziya}} (11th century BC) once habitually went fishing with a barbless hook to wait the arrival of a virtuous lord who could defeat the tyrant King Zhou of Shang. Jiang Ziya was finally discovered and hired by Count Ji Chang, who would later become King Wen with the assistance of Jiang Ziya.
