|text      = Recently, whenever I've had a spare moment, I've been observing and studying [[Chef Mao]]'s way of cooking. I've learned a lot just by watching and taking notes.

But once I try it myself, I always seem to encounter all kinds of problems. When I tried carving a duck, for instance, I accidentally used too much force, and the meat ended up flying all over the place. And when I tried making tea pastries, I rolled the pastry too thin, so the filling all spilled out... I didn't want to give up, so despite the setbacks, I just kept practicing. [[Xiangling]] and [[Guoba]] have given me a lot of encouragement too.

Which is why I think it's about time you tried out some of my handiwork for yourself.
