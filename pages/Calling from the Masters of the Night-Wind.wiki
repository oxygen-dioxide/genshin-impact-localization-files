{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the Statue of the Seven)
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *gasp* Something's hiding behind that statue!
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, it's a baby Iktomisaurus. So cute... although, why is it staring at us?
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}!
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (What is this place...?)
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 2 claw 01.ogg}} '''???:''' ...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Who are you...)
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 2 claw 02.ogg}} '''???:''' !
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh... How long was Paimon out?
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon locked eyes with that baby Iktomisaurus for like, a second, and then she was suddenly pulled into this strange place with a huuuge Iktomisaur!
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, same here...
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Any idea what happened?
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...{{Traveler}}? Hey, what's wrong?
:{{DIcon}} It's over there...
:{{DIcon}} We're being summoned...
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look! It's that baby Iktomisaur &mdash; seems like it wants us to follow it. Paimon's adventurous side says we have to see where this leads!
:{{DIcon}} I'm in! Let's go!

;(Approach the "Masters of the Night-Wind")
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, check it out, the graffiti on the wall is glowing!
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Masters of the Night-Wind... and by the looks of it, masters of nightlife too.

;(Approach the main hall)
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wonder if we're allowed in here... Oh. The door opened all by itself. Taking that as a yes!
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw! The Iktomisaur from earlier, it's really here!
:{{DIcon}} That's the one who summoned us...
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then let's go introduce ourselves.

;(Approach the Iktomisaurus)
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hello there, um...
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 5 claw 01.ogg}} '''Strange Iktomisaurus:''' ...
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, probably doesn't understand what we're saying... Doesn't look like any cogs are turning in there...
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 5 claw 02.ogg}} '''Strange Iktomisaurus:''' !
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoops, sorry! No offense intended!
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 5 caholom 01.ogg}} '''???:''' You there &mdash; you dare disrespect our elder!?
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 5 claw 03.ogg}} '''Iktomisaurus Elder:''' ...
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 5 caholom 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Oh, you mean... I see, I see. Sorry, my mistake. Apparently, you are here by invitation, in which case it's my job to make you feel welcome.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 5 caholom 03.ogg}} '''Caholom:''' Some introductions are in order. I am Caholom, one of the priests of our tribe.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 5 caholom 04.ogg}} '''Caholom:''' And this is our Iktomisaur Elder, the Great Tlapopoctiztetl. A living totem among the Masters of the Night-Wind.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, that's quite a tongue-twister...
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 5 caholom 05.ogg}} '''Caholom:''' In truth, we usually go with "Elder Tlapo" for short. You're welcome to do the same.
:{{DIcon}} We were invited here in a very... unusual way.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 5 caholom 06.ogg}} '''Caholom:''' Ah, I assume you're referring to our elder's special ability.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 5 caholom 07.ogg}} '''Caholom:''' Elder Tlapo has been alive for many centuries, and harbors secrets that even we priests are at a loss to explain, so your reaction is entirely natural.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 5 caholom 08.ogg}} '''Caholom:''' But one thing I can say for sure is that Elder Tlapo has appointed the two of you to an extremely important task. For this reason, I would like to ask you to undergo a test.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What sort of task? And what kind of test?
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 5 caholom 09.ogg}} '''Caholom:''' If it's alright with you, I'll take you to see our chief. He's in a much better position to answer your questions.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... okay, sure.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 5 caholom 10.ogg}} '''Caholom:''' Very well. Then please follow me.
:{{A|vo dialog xtlllq001 caholom 01.ogg}} '''Caholom:''' You can use this scroll to go directly to the Obsidian Altar, where the chief is.
:{{A|vo dialog xtlllq001 caholom 02.ogg}} '''Caholom:''' Don't worry, it's just one of the many mystical abilities of our tribe.

;(Talk to Caholom, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xtlllq001 caholom 01.ogg}} '''Caholom:''' You can use this scroll to go directly to the Obsidian Altar, where the chief is.
:{{A|vo dialog xtlllq001 caholom 02.ogg}} '''Caholom:''' Don't worry, it's just one of the many mystical abilities of our tribe.

;(Use the scroll)
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, what was that just now?
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 caholom 01.ogg}} '''Caholom:''' One of the routine duties of a priest. We attempt to contact the spirits of our ancestors to seek epiphanies and revelations.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 caholom 02.ogg}} '''Caholom:''' The chief is just over there. Please wait here while I have a word with him &mdash; I'll just be a moment.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, the Masters of the Night-Wind are definitely living up to their reputation as the mysterious ones.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 caholom 03.ogg}} '''Caholom:''' Alright, I've told the chief why we're here, and now you may speak with him. Right this way.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 01.ogg}} '''Biram:''' So, you two are the appointed ones? I am Chief Biram. Welcome, and thank you for your patience.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...So tall...
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 02.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Unusually so. Yes, I am aware. But I assure you, it's no cause for alarm.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh &mdash; no, of course not! Sorry, Paimon just reacted without thinking...
:{{DIcon}} What's this about us being "appointed"?
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 03.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Ah yes, Caholom told me about that. As outsiders to our tribe, this is probably the first you've heard of such appointments. I'm sure the whole thing seems very confusing.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 04.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Throughout our history, only members of the Masters of the Night-Wind have been appointed to undertake these tasks. This is the first time an outsider has ever been chosen.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really?
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 05.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Allow me to explain. Our tribe has an old tradition of recording history in the form of woven scrolls.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 06.ogg}} '''Biram:''' And not just our own history. We record the legends and heroic feats of all other tribes as well.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 07.ogg}} '''Biram:''' It is a tradition we have observed for many centuries. We treat it as a solemn duty.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 08.ogg}} '''Biram:''' However, when a major event occurs that affects all of Natlan, we record it on a different kind of scroll used for this exact purpose.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 09.ogg}} '''Biram:''' And these scrolls can only be woven by someone of the Iktomisaur Elder's choosing.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 10.ogg}} '''Biram:''' When the Iktomisaur Elder senses a major change in the Ley Lines, it will issue a formal declaration to appoint a creator for this scroll.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, so you mean...
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 11.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Elder Tlapo sensed a Ley Line change quite some time ago, but had not yet designated the scroll-weavers... until you arrived.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, but... Just so you're aware, we don't know the first thing about weaving scrolls.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 12.ogg}} '''Biram:''' As a matter of fact, that does not surprise me at all.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How come?
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 13.ogg}} '''Biram:''' In the two hundred years that Elder Tlapo has held this position, none of the appointed ones have ever been experienced scroll-weavers.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Does that mean two hundred years of major historical events have gone unrecorded?
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 14.ogg}} '''Biram:''' No, they all submitted scrolls in time. Yet each of them claimed it was not their own work, but a "gift from the spirits."
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Man... this tribe gets more mysterious by the second.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 15.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Yes, well... that is the part that troubles me.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 16.ogg}} '''Biram:''' The notion that we have to rely on esoteric things like "gifts from the spirits" to record historical events of such great importance... it is unsettling.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... That's pretty surprising to hear, coming from the chief of this tribe.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 17.ogg}} '''Biram:''' I can imagine. You probably see the Masters of the Night-Wind as a people shrouded in mystery, who pride ourselves on our arcane practices.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 18.ogg}} '''Biram:''' But I am something of an exception. I may be the chief, but when it comes to our traditions, I am in fact a proponent of change and reform.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 19.ogg}} '''Biram:''' I have dedicated my energies to deciphering the many mysteries of our tribe. In doing so, I hope to establish clearer rules that will help sustain our traditions in the future.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, that sounds great! So have you figured out the mystery of the "gift from the spirits"?
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 20.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Sadly not... It is something I have been investigating for a long time, but I have yet to uncover what this "gift" truly refers to.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 21.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Only a small handful of events over the years have been recorded on these special scrolls, with decades between each one.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 22.ogg}} '''Biram:''' And by the time the next scroll-weaver is appointed, my time as chief will be long gone. I will not be in a position to investigate as thoroughly.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So...
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 23.ogg}} '''Biram:''' While I haven't yet gotten to the bottom of the matter, I have made some progress. But the only way I can develop my theories further is with the cooperation of the appointed ones.
:{{DIcon}} And that's why you want to put us through this test.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 24.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Precisely. It's nothing to be worried about &mdash; simply a means of validating my current hypothesis. It shouldn't take you long, nor will it put you in any danger.
:{{DIcon}} Alright. So what does it involve, exactly?
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 25.ogg}} '''Biram:''' I can explain everything in detail when we get to the site of the test. But first, please wait a moment while I change out of the Soul-Shielding Cloak.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 26.ogg}} '''Biram:''' This garb is one of our important cultural relics, handed down by generations of chiefs. It is only to be worn when conducting certain ceremonies.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh...
:{{Black Screen|Biram removes his cloak and carefully hands it to a priest for safekeeping.}}
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 27.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Please come with me.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 28.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Do you see this scroll? If you touch it, you will enter a hidden space.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 29.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Today's test is, quite simply, to find a way to escape that space.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's it?
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 30.ogg}} '''Biram:''' I assure you, it's not as easy as it sounds. If you cannot find your own way out, I will of course intervene to bring you back here.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 31.ogg}} '''Biram:''' But then, we will be no closer to solving this mystery...
:{{DIcon}} We'll give it a try.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 6 biram 32.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Good. Simply touch the scroll to begin the test.

;(Talk to Biram again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xtlllq001 biram 01.ogg}} '''Biram:''' You may begin whenever you're ready.
----
;(Enter the testing grounds)
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, we really did get teleported...
:{{DIcon}} But where's the way out?
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... It seems like this place is completely sealed off. Doesn't look like there's an exit anywhere.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's take a look around and see what we can find.

;(Investigate the large scroll)
:'''Giant Woven Scroll:''' (This scroll has purposely been hung in the very middle of the ceiling. Whatever it means, it must be significant.)

;(Investigate the scroll shelf)
:'''Stack of Woven Scrolls:''' (A large pile of woven scrolls. The thick layer of dust indicates that they've been here a long time.)

;(Investigate the loom)
:'''Strange Machine:''' (There's some sort of a machine here. Probably used for weaving.)

;(After investigating the three clues)
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There are so many woven scrolls here. Paimon remembers seeing some of them before in other tribes. They seem to record historical events.
:{{Color|menu|You and Paimon carefully examine the massive woven scroll.}}
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This one really stands out from the rest. For starters, it's the biggest of them all. Wonder what story it tells?
:{{DIcon}} The colors are very distinctive, too...
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, you're right...
:{{Color|menu|A certain image appears on the distant wall, before vanishing again...}}
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Over there, something just flashed! {{Traveler}}, did you catch that?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe that's how we get out...
::{{DIcon}} ...By seeing things we couldn't see before.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 11 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohhh, right! Paimon's with you!

;(Tip)
::Observe your surroundings using the Iktomisaur's Special Elemental Sight...

;(Use elemental sight while indwelling an Iktomisaur)
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 12 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aha, there IS something hiding here! Yup, this looks like our ticket outta this place!

;(Place down the scroll)
::Nightspirit Body created successfully. You can leave now.
----
;(Leave the testing grounds)
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew, we finally got out!<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "Phew, we finally made it out!"</ref>
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 biram 01.ogg}} '''Biram:''' It is just as I thought. You are indeed capable of undertaking this mission.
:{{DIcon}} Did this prove your theory?
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 biram 02.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Yes. You saw many distinctive-looking scrolls there, didn't you?
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure did...
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 biram 03.ogg}} '''Biram:''' This specific kind of scroll was left to us by our ancestors. Upon investigation, I discovered what sets it apart is the use of a color not featured in ordinary scrolls.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 biram 04.ogg}} '''Biram:''' It is a most mysterious color that most people cannot even detect. I myself had to employ special techniques to confirm its existence.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 biram 05.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Yet there are those who are born with a natural ability to perceive it. And that is why I wanted to test you.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You mean...
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 biram 06.ogg}} '''Biram:''' That space you just entered was an exhibition room for storing this variety of woven scrolls.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 biram 07.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Centuries ago, a great shaman by the name of [[Huitzilin]] put in place a security measure, so that anyone who entered the room without permission would become trapped inside.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 biram 08.ogg}} '''Biram:''' It exists to this day, and although I have not managed to decipher how it works, I have at least found out how to turn it on and off.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 biram 09a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 biram 09b.ogg}}--> '''Biram:''' Once someone is trapped inside, it is all but impossible for them to escape without outside help &mdash; unless they share the great shaman's ability to perceive that strange color.
:{{DIcon}} I think I know what you mean.
:{{DIcon}} I did see a certain color in there...
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 biram 10.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Clearly, you must have this ability... Which leads me to believe that our Iktomisaur Elder can sense this ability in people, and that it appoints a scroll-weaver on this basis.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Another secret power? {{Traveler}}, you are full of mysteries...
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Still, having this ability doesn't change the fact that neither of us know where to start with weaving a scroll.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 biram 11.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Don't worry about that. The method for weaving this kind of scroll appears to be largely the same as for an ordinary scroll. The main difference is in the dye that gives it its unique color.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 biram 12.ogg}} '''Biram:''' If my suspicions are correct, this dye is the key to weaving the scroll &mdash; and your special ability is the key to obtaining it.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 biram 13.ogg}} '''Biram:''' The dyeing process is also a little different from the norm, but I don't anticipate any major issues there. As long as you two can source the dye itself, I can assist with the application.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Cool, we'll follow your lead!
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 biram 14.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Great. Then please use your abilities to source the necessary ingredients, and in the meantime I will have someone prepare some fabric for test-dyeing.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 biram 15.ogg}} '''Biram:''' We'll make a few sample pieces to test out my hypothesis, and if that goes well, we can begin the scroll in earnest.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 biram 16.ogg}} '''Biram:''' If you agree to help, you can expect to be handsomely rewarded once this is all over. So, what are your thoughts?
:{{DIcon}} I think with the ability to help comes the responsibility to do so.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Agreed! Especially if there's a reward in it! ...What is the reward, by the way? Is it food? Paimon hopes it's food.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 biram 17.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Given the stakes involved for our tribe, I was thinking a substantial sum of Mora would be appropriate.... Surely that would be preferable to just a free meal?
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mora works too! Anyway, how do we go about finding these ingredients? Or are we supposed to just keep walking around Natlan until we stumble across them...?
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 biram 18.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Thankfully not. I have already identified a location where I suspect they may be found, and I've arranged for someone to guide you there.
:{{A|vo xtlllq001 13 biram 19.ogg}} '''Biram:''' Your guide is waiting just outside. You can set off at your leisure.
