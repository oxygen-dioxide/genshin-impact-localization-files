:'''Roya:''' Fresh fruits and veggies! Great quantity and quality!
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Roya:''' I'm a wholesaler of fruits and vegetables.
::'''Roya:''' As you can see, there's a great number of merchant ships in the harbor, and my goods are sold in large quantities to meet the needs of ship crews going on long voyages.
::'''Roya:''' I'm used to selling crates of apples, peaches, potatoes, and tomatoes, so if you were to only buy a few, I wouldn't really know how to price them.
:{{DIcon|Reward}} I'd like a couple...
::'''Roya:''' Just a couple? Just take some, then.
::'''Roya:''' It's not worth a fortune, just go ahead and take some.
::'''Roya:''' Right, since it's just a handful, eat them while they're still fresh!
