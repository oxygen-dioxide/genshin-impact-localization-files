==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Due to the storm that swept through the city, the posters and signboards of many shops have been blown off to the rooftops and city walls of Mondstadt. [[Aramis]] of the [[Knights of Favonius]] is currently mulling over how he might retrieve them...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Start the quest by talking to Aramis)
:'''Aramis:''' How did it get blown up that high...
:{{DIcon}}: What happened?
:'''Aramis:''' Oh, it's you, Honorary Knight. How do you do? So it's like this: you must have seen that storm that surrounded the entire city, right?
:'''Aramis:''' Although the storm has subsided, the effects of that storm aren't going to be fixed any time soon...
:'''Aramis:''' Not a few merchants have said that the signboards and posters that they put up outside have all gone with the wind.
:'''Aramis:''' Some have ended up on rooftops, others onto the city walls.
:'''Aramis:''' The Knights originally intended to send two agile members to settle these issues with haste.
:'''Aramis:''' I mean, besides helping the citizens, we're also concerned that those things would look rather unbecoming, hanging off the roofs and the walls like that.
:'''Aramis:''' But as it turns out, we're shorthanded at the moment, so only I was sent.
:'''Aramis:''' And with these knees of mine, even climbing stairs has become problematic recently. I can't imagine what would become of me if I had to climb up that high...
:'''Aramis:''' Could you help me out of this bind, Honorary Knight?
:{{DIcon}}: I'll be happy to.
::'''Aramis:''' Thank you. I'm so sorry, this should have been my job, but...
::'''Aramis:''' There should be three posters and one signboard now stuck on rooftops and on the city walls.
::'''Aramis:''' Please bring those posters to me. As for the signboard, you can just leave it here on the ground. I'll have my colleagues pass it on to the appropriate merchant.
::'''Aramis:''' Again, thank you. You've really saved me.
:{{DIcon}}: I've got something else to do.
::'''Aramis:''' It's alright. This was my job in the first place. you do what you have to do, I'll think of a way to get this done.

;(After collecting billboard for Angel's Share)
:'''Merchant Billboard:''' "Newcomers deal now on at the Angel's Share. All new patrons can enjoy 30% off their first bottle of select new beverages."
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, even that signboard was blown off to such a high place...
:'''Paimon:''' We can just leave it here. Aramis said that he'll get someone to come collect it.

;(After collecting poster for Adventurers' Guild)
:'''Merchant Poster:''' "The Adventurers' Guild is now recruiting new members! To sign up, speak to Branch Master Cyrus in Mondstadt today."
:'''Paimon:''' This looks like a poster for the Adventurers' Guild. Let's take it with us.

;(After collecting poster for Cat's Tail)
:'''Merchant Poster:''' "New drinks at the Cat's Tail. Your bartender today is: Diona."
:'''Paimon:''' Cat's Tail... Huh, so they're competing with the Angel's Share? Let's take this poster with us.

;(After collecting poster for Good Hunter)
:'''Merchant Poster:''' "Try the all-new Good Hunter meal deal! Get 10% off when you purchase a Satisfying Salad and a Sticky Honey Roast in a single order."
:'''Paimon:''' Sticky Honey Roast... on discount! Say, do you think Sara will treat us to a meal if we take this poster back to her?

;(After collecting all the signboards and posters around Mondstadt)
:'''Aramis:''' Have you got them all?
:{{DIcon}}: Yes, sir!
:'''Aramis:''' You have my utmost thanks. I'll take these posters and return them to the matching merchants in a moment.
:'''Aramis:''' As for that signboard, it's from the Angel's Share. I've already notified Charles &mdash; he'll send someone over to take it back.
:'''Aramis:''' Here's a little remuneration for your help. Please take it. As for me, I need to move on to other tasks.
:'''Aramis:''' Though the storm has ceased, it's effects will remain with us for a while...
