==Profile==
Unlike [[Roger]] and [[Nelson (Cat)|Nelson]], Paisley likes neither cat toys, nor cat food. He doesn't fancy anything special, and does whatever he's in the mood for. At the tavern, he doesn't interact much with the customers and ignores strangers, preferring to play with the other cats instead. [[Diona]] calls him a self-centered little cat.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|To Catch a Kitten}}</ref>

[[Margaret]], the owner of the Cat's Tail, also owns another cat named [[Prince]].
