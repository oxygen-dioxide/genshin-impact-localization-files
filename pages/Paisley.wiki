==Profile==
Unlike [[Roger]] and [[Nelson (Cat)|Nelson]], Paisley likes neither cat toys, nor cat food. He doesn't fancy anything special, and does whatever he's in the mood for. At the tavern, he doesn't interact much with the customers and ignores strangers, preferring to play with the other cats instead. [[Diona]] calls him a self-centered little cat.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|To Catch a Kitten}}</ref>

==Trivia==

His full name was Prince Rogers Nelson and Paisley Park is the name of his recording studio/residence and one of his {{w|Paisley Park (song)|songs}}. [[Margaret]], the owner of the Cat's Tail, also owns another cat named [[Prince]].
