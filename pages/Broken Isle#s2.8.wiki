==Puzzles==
===Underground Area===
After completing [[Blazin' Trails (Part 3)]], the underground puzzle becomes available to solve. To access the underground area, the player must use the Change Mountain Style function to lower the southwest mountain. After the mountain has been lowered, an entrance will become available.

Once in the underground area, the player needs to solve two [[Ruins Torch]] puzzles and activate two Pyro [[Elemental Monument]]s to drain the water. Once the water is drained, a [[Melodic Harp]] and [[Melodic Bloom]]s puzzle along with a barrier with three [[Precious Chest]]s sealed behind a barrier. However, this barrier cannot be removed due to an obstacle before it. The [[Misplaced Conch 2]] can also be found in this area.

To remove the barrier, the player must go to the deepest end of the cave to find a door that will teleport the player under the center mountain of Broken Isle before a metal gate. Raising the metal gate will unlock the second entrance to the underground area.

Once the second entrance is unlocked, the player must use the Change Mountain Style function again to raise the mountains, then return to the underground area through the second entrance. The obstacle before the barrier will now have disappeared, and the barrier sealing the three chests can be removed using the Melodic Harp and Melodic Blooms. The three chests will each reward 10, 10, and 40 [[Primogem]]s, and the center chest contains the blueprint for the [[Allegro Bloom: Special Tuning]] furnishing.
