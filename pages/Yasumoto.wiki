<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Yasumoto was the only travelling doctor remaining after the Tatarigami outbreak on Yashiori Island. Even after the death of the majority of the villagers, he continued to research a cure. The Pharmacist's Notebook he leaves after his disappearance suggests that he stayed behind because of guilt and a sense of responsibility, as he was unable to make any effective cure for the illness.

Yasumoto's fate is left ambiguous. When the player follows elemental traces after his disappearance, the last clue leads to a basket of Naku Weeds that are left behind on the southernmost point of Yashiori Island.

==Trivia==
*It is revealed in the [[Pharmacist's Notebook]] that Yasumoto was going to take care of [[Chouji]], after recommending his mother go to Sumeru for a cure, before disappearing due to the player's involvement in helping him find a cure.
**Despite his intentions, Chouji thought that Yasumoto was quite "creepy".
*In the [[Incomplete Notes]] dropped by [[Washizu]], Yasumoto is called a "fraud", because all he does is boil [[Lavender Melon]] and [[Sugar]]. In the Pharmacist's Notebook, Yasumoto reveals he did this, because he had no way of curing the Tataragami and thought that "caring is also a form of remedy".
