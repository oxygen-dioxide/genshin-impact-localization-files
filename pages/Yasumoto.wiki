==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Yasumoto was the only traveling doctor remaining after the [[Tatarigami]] outbreak on [[Yashiori Island]]. Even after the death of the majority of the villagers, he continued to research a cure. The [[Pharmacist's Notebook]] he leaves after his disappearance suggests that he stayed behind because of guilt and a sense of responsibility, as he was unable to make any effective cure for the illness.

When the player follows elemental traces after his disappearance, the last clue leads to a basket of [[Naku Weed]]s that are left behind on the southernmost point of Yashiori Island.

===Appearance===
Yasumoto is a man with short brown hair parted down the middle, thin eyebrows, and light brown eyes. He wears a yellow shirt with a white undershirt and dark gray arm warmers. He wears dark gray pants patterned with lighter gray vertical stripes and black sandals.

==Trivia==
* It is revealed in the Pharmacist's Notebook that Yasumoto was going to take care of [[Chouji]], after recommending his mother go to [[Sumeru]] for a cure, before disappearing due to the player's involvement in helping him find a cure.
** Despite his good intentions, Chouji thought that Yasumoto was quite "creepy."
* In the [[Incomplete Notes]] dropped by [[Washizu]], Yasumoto is called a "fraud," because all he does is boil [[Lavender Melon]] and [[Sugar]]. In the Pharmacist's Notebook, Yasumoto reveals he did this, because he had no way of curing the Tataragami and thought that "caring is also a form of remedy."
* Although Yasumoto's fate is left ambiguous, the Chinese description of the [[Achievement]] ''[[A Doctor's Odyssey]]'' is {{Lang|"Witness the ending of Yasumoto."|zh=见证保本的结局。}}, indicating that Yasumoto's final fate is in the southernmost point of Yashiori Island.
