'''Evilsoother''' is [[Xingqiu]]'s [[Level 4 Constellation]].

==Gameplay Notes==
*The damage dealt increase provided by this Constellation is applied ''multiplicatively'' with other [[Damage Bonus|damage bonuses]] (whereas other DMG Bonuses are applied additively). Using Xingqiu's Skill while his Burst is active will always cause the Skill to deal 50% more damage to enemies, regardless of other attribute values.
