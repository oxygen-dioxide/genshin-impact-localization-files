|vo_01_01_file       = VO_{character} Hello.ogg
|vo_01_01_tx         = Sayu, Shuumatsuban, at your disposal! Whew, but if you don't need me right now, I'm gonna grab some sleep. Nope, no need to tuck me in &mdash; I need the extra room to grow into.

|vo_02_01_title      = Chat: Asleep

|vo_03_01_tx         = Eek, let's find shelter, quick! Watering works on plants, but not people...

|vo_03_02_tx         = Phew, this weather is wild! Best thing to do is dive under the covers where it's dark and snug and warm and nyam nyam nyam~ *sleeps*

|vo_03_03_title      = When It Snows
|vo_03_03_file       = VO_{character} When It Snows.ogg
|vo_03_03_tx         = It's really easy to hide in weather like this. There's this ninjutsu technique called Cloak of Snow where you can pretty much make yourself invisible &mdash; all other people see when they look at you is the snowflakes dancing in the air. Wait, it's confidential though! Don't tell any of this to the shrine maiden...

|vo_03_04_title      = When the Sun Is Out
|vo_03_04_file       = VO_{character} When the Sun Is Out.ogg

|vo_04_01_file       = VO_{character} Good Morning.ogg
|vo_04_01_tx         = ...Morning? Already? Okay, I'm just gonna snooze for, like, 10 more minutes... Please, just 10 minutes... No? Okay, 5 minutes then? *snores*

|vo_05_01_file       = VO_{character} About {character} - Shuumatsuban.ogg
|vo_05_01_tx         = Yeah, I'm in the Shuumatsuban, but they only ever get me to do stuff like... *yawn* information gathering and stealing. So, y'know... it's not really a big deal if the work doesn't get done.

|vo_05_02_title      = About {character}: Skiving
|vo_05_02_friendship = 4
|vo_05_02_file       = VO_{character} About {character} - Skiving.ogg
|vo_05_02_tx         = So I don't do any important work at the Shuumatsuban, and anything that gets put off for long enough ends up getting done by someone who's more suited to it anyway. Sleep, on the other hand &mdash; that is of the utmost importance. Because I need to get enough sleep to make sure I get my growth spurt.

|vo_06_01_title      = About Us: Favor
|vo_06_01_file       = VO_{character} About Us - Favor.ogg
|vo_06_01_tx         = Hey, will you do me a favor and let me know if you see the shrine maiden coming? I'm just gonna, um... rest my eyes for a moment.

|vo_06_02_tx         = I'm not a pet, y'know! Hmm, but since it's you... Okay, you can pat my head and I promise not to bite your hand. Just a little, though! If you pat someone's head too much, it stunts their growth.

|vo_07_01_friendship = 4
|vo_07_01_file       = VO_{character} About the Vision.ogg
|vo_07_01_tx         = My sword is crazy heavy, even with my ninjutsu training there's no way I could lift it without the help of my Vision. So yeah, having a Vision is a huge help for me.

|vo_07_02_title      = Something to Share
|vo_07_02_file       = VO_{character} Something to Share.ogg
|vo_07_02_tx         = Sensei says I'll be the last ninja ever in our line. I guess it can't be helped, because this style of ninjutsu wouldn't be much help in a fight anyway &mdash; all I've been taught is how to escape and how to cover your tracks.

|vo_07_03_title      = Interesting Things
|vo_07_03_file       = VO_{character} Interesting Things.ogg
|vo_07_03_tx         = Do you know the mujina? It looks similar to a tanuki, but it's way cuter. I'll take you to see one next time!

|vo_08_01_friendship = 4
|vo_08_01_file       = VO_{character} About Kamisato Ayaka.ogg
|vo_08_01_tx         = As the eldest daughter of the Kamisato Clan, she always looks very graceful and elegant. But she got one of the shrine maidens to keep tabs on me and make sure I don't slack off... Why would she do that?

|vo_08_02_title      = About [[Kamisato Ayato]]
|vo_08_02_friendship = 4
|vo_08_02_file       = VO_{character} About Kamisato Ayato.ogg
|vo_08_02_tx         = Sometimes, when I'm taking a rest up in a tree, I overhear the shrine maidens talking about him. Sounds like he's pretty important and super busy most of the time. I don't get it, though &mdash; it's only work, or whatever, so why doesn't he just... not do it?

|vo_08_03_title      = About [[Thoma]]
|vo_08_03_friendship = 4
|vo_08_03_file       = VO_{character} About Thoma.ogg
|vo_08_03_tx         = He's got a Vision, and yet for some reason he pesters me about learning ninjutsu every time I run into him. I don't know what his deal is. It's not like I'd have the time to teach him anyway, I barely get enough sleep as it is.

|vo_08_04_title      = About [[Yoimiya]]
|vo_08_04_friendship = 4
|vo_08_04_file       = VO_{character} About Yoimiya.ogg
|vo_08_04_tx         = Every time she sees me she says, "Hey, little tanuki! Let's go hang out at the festival." Firstly, I'm not a tanuki. Secondly, I don't wanna go to a festival. Thirdly, she says she wants to hang out &mdash; but really, she just wants me to do a ninjutsu performance during the fireworks show. That's not even related to my work for the Shuumatsuban!

|vo_08_05_title      = About the [[Raiden Shogun]]
|vo_08_05_friendship = 4
|vo_08_05_file       = VO_{character} About the Raiden Shogun.ogg
|vo_08_05_tx         = Her Excellency? Definitely not someone I'd ever get to meet. If you've got questions, maybe Miss Ayaka's the person to ask.

|vo_08_06_title      = About [[Yae Miko]]
|vo_08_06_friendship = 4
|vo_08_06_file       = VO_{character} About Yae Miko.ogg
|vo_08_06_tx         = She's always patting me on the head... I've never bitten her, though, or even said anything, because I'm frightened of how she'd react if I stood up to her. But what am I gonna do? Because if she keeps on patting my head, I'm gonna get stuck at this height forever!

|vo_08_07_title      = About [[Arataki Itto]]
|vo_08_07_friendship = 4
|vo_08_07_file       = VO_{character} About Arataki Itto.ogg

|vo_09_02_friendship = 3
|vo_09_02_file       = VO_{character} More About {character} - 02.ogg
|vo_09_02_tx         = Huh? You wanna know the name of my style of ninjutsu? Uhh... Y'know what, I can't think straight right now, I'm still half asleep here. Lemme snooze a while longer, maybe my mind'll be clearer when I wake up.

|vo_09_03_title      = More About {character}: III
|vo_09_03_friendship = 4
|vo_09_03_file       = VO_{character} More About {character} - 03.ogg
|vo_09_03_tx         = Alright, fine... I'll tell you. But you'd better not laugh, or I'm never talking to you again. Uh so, my style of ninjutsu is called... um... Yoohoo Art.<br />The reason is supposedly that our style focuses on making fun of the enemy, but still... I mean... *sigh*

|vo_09_04_title      = More About {character}: IV
|vo_09_04_friendship = 5
|vo_09_04_file       = VO_{character} More About {character} - 04.ogg
|vo_09_04_tx         = Do you know how to climb trees? I'm an expert, I can teach you. There's this tree down at the shrine &mdash; it's the perfect place, you could just literally sleep there all day if you wanted and no one would ever find you... Uh, I just mean, it's a great place for a power nap. Next time you wanna take a nap, let me know, I'll take you there.

|vo_09_05_title      = More About {character}: V
|vo_09_05_friendship = 6
|vo_09_05_file       = VO_{character} More About {character} - 05.ogg
|vo_09_05_tx         = It was actually sensei who gave me this outfit. They said it was modeled after the mujina, and it could help with escapes, or something... and then sensei said that I was all grown up and ready to go it alone, but that I should still be careful to protect myself... then they left me. Am I really ready to go it alone, at my height?<br />Um... Hmm? Y&mdash;You'll keep my company? Really? Promise you won't leave me?

|vo_10_01_title      = {character}'s Hobbies
|vo_10_01_file       = VO_{character} Hobbies.ogg
|vo_10_01_tx         = When I put my hood on, I can snooze away to my heart's content without having to worry about the shrine maiden finding me. *sigh* I think it must be one of the best feelings in the whole world.

|vo_10_02_file       = VO_{character} Troubles - Misunderstanding.ogg
|vo_10_02_tx         = For some reason, when people meet me for the first time, they always call me tanuki, or teddy-bear, or kitty-cat... But Sayu is just Sayu &mdash; and definitely not a tanuki.

|vo_10_03_title      = {character}'s Troubles: Height
|vo_10_03_file       = VO_{character} Troubles - Height.ogg
|vo_10_03_tx         = When is my growth spurt gonna come? Everyone my age practically twice my height, and I'm still... Ugh, enough, I need sleep, sleep is the answer. Good night!

|vo_10_05_file       = VO_{character} Favorite Food.ogg
|vo_10_05_tx         = High-carb foods that give you instant energy, like rice balls. If you eat one the moment you wake up, it stops you feeling so groggy and bleary-eyed. Then, you can just relax and get straight back to sleep.

|vo_10_06_title      = Least Favorite Food
|vo_10_06_file       = VO_{character} Least Favorite Food.ogg
|vo_10_06_tx         = Can't be picky about food when you've still got growing to do! ...That said, I haven't gained any height recently &mdash; maybe I'm not eating enough vegetables? But salad isn't filling enough and sometimes it can be really bitter... *sigh*

<!-- Receiving a Gift -->
|vo_11_01_title      = Receiving a Gift: I

|vo_13_04_ascension  = 6
|vo_13_04_file       = VO_{character} Feelings About Ascension -  04.ogg
