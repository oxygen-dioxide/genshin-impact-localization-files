|text      = Hey there, comrade! Have you been preparing for your journey to [[Natlan]]? Is there anything I can help with? Natlan is the nation of "war," and everyone there loves to fight, just like me. So, before you set off, how about a good old sparring between the two of us? A bit of warm-up can't hurt, don't you agree?

Don't worry about me. I've been taking things easy and resting for quite a long time to reassure my family. In fact, if I don't get some exercise soon, my body might actually start falling apart.

Oh, and here, take the trophies I got from that [[All-Devouring Narwhal|whale]]. The thrill of the battle itself is sufficient enough for me. So, what do you say? My family would also feel at ease knowing I'm meeting up with you.
