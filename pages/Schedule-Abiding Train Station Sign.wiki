|description    = A station sign in the style of [[Constellation Metropole]], using a sturdy and durable Cypress Wood frame and adorned with a bell used to call the train. Its striking color and design guarantee that passengers can instantly recognize the location of the station sign. In theory, as long as passengers arrive at the station at the scheduled time, they will be able to ride the [[Maritime Express]]. However, this is predicated on an important assumption &mdash; namely, that the [[Cedule|station staff]] lug themselves out of bed in time, or that [[Almond (NPC)|some elder]] is willing to help wake them...
