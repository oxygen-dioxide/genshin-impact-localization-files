{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Mr. Zhu)
:'''Mr. Zhu:''' If only I could eat it again, it was so good...
:{{DIcon}} Eat what again?
:'''Mr. Zhu:''' Oh, a traveler. When I was young I used to travel all over the place. What I loved most about traveling was getting to try all the different foods.
:'''Mr. Zhu:''' After eating my way across the continent, I returned to Liyue and opened my restaurant, Emerald Maple, in the hopes I could recreate the flavors of my travels.
:'''Mr. Zhu:''' But there's this one dish I can never quite remember the name of.
:'''Mr. Zhu:''' Just how am I going to recreate that flavor?
:{{DIcon|Quest}} I get it.
::'''Mr. Zhu:''' All I remember is it was a sweet, fragrant dish. The sheer look of it was enough to get me drooling at the mouth... And to top it all off, it was nutritious too.
::'''Mr. Zhu:''' The ingredients are a lot of Fowl and some Sweet Flowers. It's called... Sweetened Mistress or something like that. If you'd be able to make one for me, I'd be ever so grateful.
::'''Mr. Zhu:''' Traveler – over to you!
:{{DIcon}} What a tragedy!
::'''Mr. Zhu:''' *sigh* I've eaten such a wide variety of delicious foods in my time that I just can't remember what this one was...
:;(Does not accept the quest)
----
;(Return to Mr. Zhu)
:'''Mr. Zhu:''' You're back! Did you find the mystery dish?
:{{DIcon}} Yes.
::'''Mr. Zhu:''' Great! Give it here...
::'''Mr. Zhu:''' Aha! This is the one! Mmm, yes, that's the taste I remember!
:{{DIcon}} Not yet.
::'''Mr. Zhu:''' No problem. Take your time with the search... But please don't forget about it.

;(Talk to Mr. Zhu again)
:'''Mr. Zhu:''' Thank you ever so much! Please take this for your trouble, traveler.
