* '''September 9, 2021''' &mdash; Description updated to add the following: "When Signora sustains a single instance of DMG that exceeds a certain percentage of her Max HP, all DMG beyond that percentage will be nullified. After this, Signora will unleash a wave of cold air or heat that will cause characters to rapidly accumulate the corresponding temperature status.
