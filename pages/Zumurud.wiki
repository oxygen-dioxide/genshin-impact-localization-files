'''Zumurud''', also known as the '''Verdant Lord''' was a historical figure in the [[Great Red Sand]], [[Sumeru]] who lived thousands of years ago and ruled over several city-states that existed in the desert.

==Story==
Zumurud was the son of [[Muzaffar]], one of the Twenty-Nine Deys of Orghana (the city now known as [[Port Ormos]]) and then conqueror of the Great Red Sand cities. Zumurud was raised "in the forest" and didn't speak the desert language.<ref name="duat">Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, [[Primal Obelisk#Duat Hall|Duat Hall]]</ref>

His father instructed him to "leave as many heirs as a pomegranate tree bears fruits", and so Zumurud had 99 children, 50 sons and 49 daughters. Inscriptions in the Great Red Sand seem to contradict each other on Zumurud's descendants; one inscription claims [[Badanah]] (and thus also his brother Muzzudin) was one of Zumurud's fifty sons (assuming the line is meant to be read literally),<ref name="Lamb">Interactible: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, [[Primal Obelisk#Valley of Dahri|Valley of Dahri]]</ref> while another claims that "[Badanah's] father is most beloved of the Verdant Lord," which indicates that Badanah was not Zumurud's direct descendant.  Nevertheless, according to the inscriptions, "children of the Verdant Lord walked the land like gods, and the Verdant Lord's realm was as indestructible as the Mausoleum of King Deshret."<ref name="Lamb"/>

In the second year of his reign, the Verdant Lord had a dream which he made "the greatest scholars" write down in the Desert Language, including on one Primal Obelisk.
{{Quote|Zumurud saw the following in a dream last night. He dreamed that in the darkness, the sun arose from his... swallowing the light of the stars and the moon.
 The sun shone over the land that was filled with yellow sand, and not even the slightest trace of a bird could be found there.
 The Verdant Lord sighed at the sight of this vision, determining that... should become like the forest, a paradise of green. As he breathed, out of the desert... vast, clear springs, and a boundless... trees that touched the very skies.
 He saw a thousand ships, ten thousand roses, a hundred... caravans without number, woven into gold across the desert...
 Just as... about to put on those golden robes, he awoke to see an arrow of sunlight piercing the summit of a mountain.|Primal Obelisk in Duat Hall}}

*{{lang|Zumurud|ar=زُمُرُّد|ar_rm=zumurrud|fa=زمرد|fa_rm=zomorrod}} means "emerald." The Arabic and Persian words are themselves derived from the Ancient Greek word {{lang|mini=1|grc=σμᾰ́ραγδος|grc_rm=smáragdos}}.
