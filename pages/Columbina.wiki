==Trivia==
* In ''{{w|commedia dell'arte}}'', a type of Italian theater, {{lang|"Columbina"|it=''Colombina''|it_tl=Little Dove}}, is a female servant who is often the "only functional intellect on the stage" as she does her best to get the Innamorati together.
* The melody Columbina sings in ''A Winter Night's Lazzo'' was a rendition of the melodies of "[[Chrysalis Suspirii]]" and "[[Saltatio Favillae]]," both of which are played during the battle with [[Signora]] in [[Narukami Island: Tenshukaku]].
* Her headpiece mimics that of an angel's wings, specifically a {{w|seraph}}'s.
* The pattern on her face covering and headband are similar in appearance to the pattern on the bottom of a [[Seelie]] Court.
