{{Location Intro|description=<p></p>}}

The Sign of Apaosha is a "celestial mark" that manifests above the [[Harvisptokhm]] in response to the weakening of its seal on defiled energy ([[Abyssal Corruption]]) in the area. It appears to be a giant dark hole in the sky, but is more akin to a reflection of the [[Abyss]].<ref name="Splendorous">{{Ref/Quest|The Splendorous Sky That Day}}</ref> The [[Khaenri'ah|Dahri]] called it the "Sign of Truth," believing that it revealed the "reality" beyond the sky of Teyvat.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As the Khvarena's Light Shows}}</ref>

The Sign appeared for the first time after the [[Cataclysm]]. The [[Pari]] worked together with the forebearers of the [[Order of Skeptics]] to extinguish it, after which it became the Order's responsibility to maintain the Harvisptokhm's seal.<ref name="Splendorous"/> However, the Order deteriorated over time and the defilement built up, leading to the re-emergence of the Sign of Apaosha in the present day. The Pari [[Sorush]], assisted by [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]], ultimately extinguished the Sign again by performing the '''Rite of Chinvat''' using the power of the [[Great Song of Khvarena|Great Songs of Khvarena]].
