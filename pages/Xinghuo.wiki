'''Xinghuo''' is a member of the [[Millelith]]. He can be found near the Teleport Waypoint at [[Guili Plains]], [[Liyue]], stationed there alongside [[Echo (NPC)|Echo]].

During the event [[Lantern Rite]], he was in charge of overseeing safety during the festival, keeping an eye out for thieves that appear in the area.

==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Xinghuo's partner, Echo, once spoke with a terrible stutter. A wandering adventurer named [[Alice]] stumbled upon them one day and concocted a potion to cure it, but it had the unexpected side effect of compelling Echo to perfectly mimic those around him, much to Xinghuo's annoyance.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Xinghuo:''' *sigh* ...Huh? Oh, hello, traveler. Do you need help with anything?
:{{DIcon}} What's bothering you?
::'''Xinghuo:''' *sigh* ...Isn't it obvious?
::'''Xinghuo:''' That guy keeps imitating everything I say. It's driving me nuts.
::{{DIcon}} Are you two friends?
:::'''Xinghuo:''' Hmm... I guess. We've known each other for a while.
::{{DIcon}} Why does he imitate you?
:::'''Xinghuo:''' He used to speak with a stutter until a few years ago, until a Traveler called Alice came along and gave him a bottle of medicine...
:::'''Xinghuo:''' It cured his stutter completely. But then he couldn't stop imitating the way everyone around him speaks...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Xinghuo:''' Goodbye, traveler.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
* Xinghuo's dialogue during the second Closed Beta Test was significantly different from his dialogue in the final game and gave an option to begin the now-unavailable World Quest Three Flames Light the Way.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/bwBfZoA_5EU?t=787 CBT2 - Let's go to Liyue Harbor]</ref>
