==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing [[Setting Sail]].''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Furong:''' If you have a moment, traveler, could you have a look up there?
:{{DIcon}} Have we met?
::'''Furong:''' I'm a sailor on the Alcor. In charge of fighting, mostly.
::'''Furong:''' ...And don't you judge me on account of my size, now. Even Chief Mate [[Juza]]'s hasn't got my strength. Why, he's never beaten me in a single round of arm wrestling!
::'''Furong:''' I'll just say it now by the by, I won't marry anyone unless they can go a round with me and win. It's as simple as that.
::'''Furong:''' Shame, but the only person who's won against me... is Captain [[Beidou]], of course.
:{{DIcon}} Up where?
::'''Furong:''' I'm talking about the crow's nest. No clue if [[Xu Liushi|Liushi]]'s found anything.
::'''Furong:''' I've hollered for him a few times, but no dice. Maybe the waves are too loud, and he can't hear me.
::'''Furong:''' I'm a little afraid of heights, so I, uh... Ahem. Why don't you have a look if you have the time, eh?
:{{DIcon}} See you, then.
::'''Furong:''' Aye, see you.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing [[Setting Sail]].''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Furong:''' Oh, hello there, Traveler. If you have a moment, could you have a look up there?
:{{DIcon}} I see you're the same as ever...
::'''Furong:''' Well, I am a sailor on the Alcor, after all, and in charge of fighting, too!
::'''Furong:''' ...And don't you judge me on account of my size, now. Even Chief Mate Juza's hasn't got my strength. Why, he's never beaten me in a single round of arm wrestling!
::'''Furong:''' I'll say it now by the by, I won't marry anyone unless they can go a round with me and win. It's as simple as that.
::'''Furong:''' Shame, but the only person who's won against me... is Captain Beidou, of course.
::'''Furong:'''  That said, things might go differently if you decided to give it a go, heh.
:{{DIcon}} Up where?
::;(Same as before)
:{{DIcon}} See you, then.
::;(Same as before)
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* [[Little Yue]]'s remark about Furong indicates she fantasizes about Beidou.
* Her dialogue branch for "Up where?" ties into Liushi's dialogue for "How's the situation?", where he remarks that he heard something from below (which was Furong calling for him), but couldn't hear clearly over the wind.
