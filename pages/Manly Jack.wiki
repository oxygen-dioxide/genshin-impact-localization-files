==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Manly Jack:''' Ah! Shoo, shoo!
:'''Manly Jack:''' ...Oh, you're just a traveler. I was convinced that you were a hilichurl...
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Manly Jack:''' Aha, well! Ever heard of a little something called "manliness"?
::'''Manly Jack:''' That fellow [[Jack]] from the [[Adventurers' Guild]], he knows all about it. Says that if you defeat ten thousand hilichurls, then everyone suddenly sees you as Mr. Manly, and so on.
::'''Manly Jack:''' Sooooo... I am currently getting ready to prove, once and for all, that I am the manliest man of the lot!
::{{DIcon}} Go on then. I'm watching.
::'''Manly Jack:''' Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm taking my time over this. Don't want to rush into it and make a fool of myself now, do I?
::'''Manly Jack:''' Hilichurls are the most terrifying of creatures. You don't go up against a hilichurl without doing some serious preparation in advance!
::'''Manly Jack:''' You know, filing your nails, styling your bangs...
:{{DIcon}} I will be leaving now...
::'''Manly Jack:''' Okay, byeeeee~!
::'''Manly Jack:''' The road to manliness is long and hard...
