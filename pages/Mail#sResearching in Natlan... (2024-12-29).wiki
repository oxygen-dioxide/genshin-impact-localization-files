|text      = It's been quite a while since we last met. Everything is going well here in the rainforest, and I wish you all the best on your journey in [[Natlan]].

Speaking of Natlan, I've come across plenty of illustrations of Natlan's flora and fauna in academic literature. They've always fascinated me, though I haven't had the chance to explore them firsthand.

Once the [[Forest Rangers]] here are fully adept at their duties, I'm planning to carve out some time to visit Natlan for research, gathering material for my next paper. When that time comes, would you consider being my personal "Forest Ranger" there? I'm sure there's much I could learn from you.

Here, I've also enclosed a selection of seasonal mushrooms with this letter. I hope you can enjoy their rich flavor, even from so far away.
