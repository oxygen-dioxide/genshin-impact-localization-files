{{Description|A fictional story of a band of five heroes who go off on a dragon hunt. It is poorly written and structurally incoherent. Its value lies in the many lessons that can be learned from failure.}}

==Gameplay Notes==
* The boost to ATK is based on the base ATK of the character being buffed.
*The buff is only applied when switching from the character equipping this weapon to another character.
**The new character taking the field is buffed for the full duration of the effect.
**Switching out and switching back in doesn't remove the effect from the buffed character.
**The buff does not carry over to all switched characters during the effect window.
*If a new Thrilling Tales buff is applied while a previous one is active, the buff will '''not''' stack and the duration of the buff will '''not''' be refreshed, but both of the books' passives will go on cooldown as usual.
*Unequipping Thrilling Tales will immediately end the buff, re-equipping it or equipping another will reset the buff cooldown.

==Description==
Five Heroes embarked on a journey to slay the evil dragon.<br />
For honor, the master swordsman.<br />
For research, the knowledgeable sorceress.<br />
For bounty, the swashbuckling mercenary.<br />
For vengeance, the deadeye marksman.<br />
For stories, the grand novelist.<br />
A lotus proceeds from my mouth and flowers bloom on the page.<br />
My words are wise and clear and my thoughts are sharp like lightning.<br />
I joined this party because I couldn't find a job, and anybody can be a copywriter.<br />
But I'm no writer, just a regular fellow in his mid twenties without an honest job.
