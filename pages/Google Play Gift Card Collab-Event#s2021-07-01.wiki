Different prices of cards will yield you different in-game content, such as collaborative-event furnishings and other rich rewards.

Q: How do I redeem the contents of the card after purchasing it?<br />
A: After purchasing a gift card and obtaining its redemption code, go to the Google Play Store on your mobile device to redeem your reward (function only available on mobile). Tap on Profile > Redeem, then enter the redemption code. Afterwards, you will obtain your reward via in-game mail the next time you log in.
*After successfully redeeming the gift card in the Google Play Store, the reward will be sent via in-game mail to the first UID used to log in. So Travelers, please make sure to log in using the correct UID~

Q: Can I use my UID to redeem the same reward again?<br />
A: No. Each UID is limited to one reward of each type. The same UID cannot claim the same reward more than once. Redemption codes used to claim a certain type of reward you have already claimed previously will be invalid. Please be sure of the account and server region used to redeem the reward as well as the type of gift card before logging in to receive your reward.

Q: How many UIDs can each gift card be redeemed for?<br />
A: A gift card redemption code can be only used for one UID. Travelers should be sure of the UID they use to redeem their reward.
