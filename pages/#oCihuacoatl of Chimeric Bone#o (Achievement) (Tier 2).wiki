'''''"Cihuacoatl of Chimeric Bone"''''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Duelist: Series I]]''. To complete this achievement, the player needs to defeat the [[Local Legend]] {{Enemy|Yumkasaurus Warrior: Flowing Skyfire|text=Ciuhacoatl of Chimeric Bone â€” Once Walked With the Lord of Xibalba}} and break all the grappling anchor points before the Cihuacoatl of Chimeric Bone goes into the hovering state.

==Gameplay Notes==
There is a possible mistranslation in the achievement description. To complete the achievement, the player must break all three of the grappling points while Cihuacoatl of Chimeric Bone is in the air. This only needs to be done once in the battle, not every cycle.
