==Profile==
Asakura serves as a Doushin in the [[Tenryou Commission]], stationed in [[Tenshukaku]]. At some point prior to the [[Traveler]]'s arrival, he was returning with a group of his fellow Doushin when they came upon a vagrant crew about to raid a merchant convoy. He and the others sprung into action, but another group of vagrants ambushed and put them on the defensive. The combined vagrants taunted and teased the Doushin before their Kairagi leader challenged Asakura and defeated him due to a lack of stamina, taking his weapon. While Asakura was given a new weapon, he was upset and angered his loss, posting a commission on the [[Adventurers' Guild]] to look for a training partner, albeit anonymously due to the shame he felt.

The Traveler took up his commission and learned why he had put the commission. After training with him several times, he managed to locate the vagrants that had stolen his weapon. The vagrants greatly underestimated the Traveler and were promptly defeated by them, allowing Asakura to duel their leader in a fair fight. Asakura prevailed, severely injuring the Kairagi leader and reclaimed his old weapon. He thanked the Traveler for their efforts and asked them to continue training with him in the future.

When [[Kujou Sara]] stormed Tenshukaku to inform the Shogun of the deception she had learned, she easily swatted Asakura aside.

===Personality===
Asakura is loyal to the Shogun's cause. He expresses a desire to train harder so he can protect his nation from all threats.

===Appearance===
Asakura wears a standard uniform modeled from the {{Lang|''ashigaru''|ja=足軽}} of feudal Japan. He wears a purple-gray ''shitagi'', gray ''kobakama'', white socks, and ''waraji'' sandals. His eggplant-colored armor with gray accents consists of ''dou'' (breastplate) with the [[Inazuma Shogunate]]'s crest, ''han-kote'' (half-armored sleeves), ''haidate'' (thigh guards), and ''sune-ate'' (greaves). He is equipped with a ''juumonji yari'' (cross-shaped spear), whose shaft is lavender colored, and contains the Shogunate crest under the spearhead.

:'''Asakura:''' He&mdash;Hello, how can I help you?
:{{DIcon}} Did I scare you?

::'''Asakura:''' This gate leads to the [[Tenshukaku]], the residence of our Almighty Shogun, so please refrain from doing anything reckless here.
