==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Rufina:''' Huh. I've never seen you around before. You're a new face and from outside, too! Normal humans don't come around here often... are you an adventurer, then?
:'''Rufina:''' I've heard that they run around all over the place, just like you. Is that true?
:{{DIcon}} I have been to lots of places, indeed.
::'''Rufina:''' Ooh, that's great! I wanna join the [[Adventurers' Guild]] in the future, too. That way, I can explore all sorts of places!
::'''Rufina:''' Alright. It's decided. I'm gonna be a great Melusine adventurer!
::{{DIcon}} It'll be dangerous, you know.
:::'''Rufina:''' Yes, that's true. The books say that you'll encounter lots of crises.
:::'''Rufina:''' My big sister also tells me that "if you go out willy-nilly, you'll be gobbled up by a great big monster!" I know she's just trying to scare me, though.
:::'''Rufina:''' Hmph. Once I'm ready, and not afraid of any danger whatsoever, I'm going to explore the outside world!
::{{DIcon}} Hurray for the Melusine adventurer!
:::'''Rufina:''' Hehe. That sounds awesome! Let me let you in on a secret &mdash; sometimes, I sneak out of the village to play!
:::'''Rufina:''' But only for a while. I always get back before my big sister can find out. Don't tell her, alright?
;(After Step 3 of ''[[There Will Come Soft Rains]]'' and before completing ''[[Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic Dog]]'')
:{{DIcon}} About the earthquake just a while ago...
::'''Rufina:''' Did you hear that noise too? Something huge must have happened!
::'''Rufina:''' Maybe some secret treasure was dug up or something &mdash; that's what happens in the stories I've read!
::'''Rufina:''' Pity that my big sister won't let me leave the village whenever I want... If not, I'd have been the first one to discover that treasure. That would've been a fine start to my adventure!
:{{DIcon}} Yes, but for now, I must leave.
::'''Rufina:''' Alright then. When you've got the time, tell me about the places you've seen, adventurer!
{{Dialogue End}}
===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''Ancient Colors''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Rufina:''' Ooh, it's you! I heard from my [[Virda|big sister]] about how you saved her. Hehe, you're super awesome!
:{{DIcon}} I'd only call myself the normal kind of awesome...
::'''Rufina:''' She said that you didn't just save her, but the bad guys even had to kneel and beg you for mercy... You're just like The Great Adventurer [[Stanley]]!
::'''Rufina:''' I wanna be like him&mdash; No, I wanna be like you! I'm gonna be an awesome adventurer, too!
::;(Dialogue continues same as above)
:{{DIcon}} Thanks. Seeya!
::'''Rufina:''' See you! Tell me about your adventures when you have the time, alright?
