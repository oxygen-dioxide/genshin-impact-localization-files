==Walkthrough==
If you have difficulty climbing or jumping up, use Zhongli's skill to create a Geo construct and climb up.
# Go west, past some hilichurls, up the stairs using Geo constructs until you find a relic (chalice) which starts a cutscene.
# Go west through the newly opened door and fight some hilichurls.
# Go south and open the door by creating a Geo construct on one pressure plate and standing on the other plate, or by placing Geo Constructs on both plates.
# Go towards the second relic (ruler) and start a cutscene.
# Defeat Kliment, the Fatui Pyro Agent, and start a cutscene.
# Go south through the newly opened door and head west for the first missable chest, then glide across to the next platform.
# Create a Geo construct on the pressure plate and climb up the construct before gliding over to the next platform.
#* The second missable Common Chest will appear on the next platform when the pressure plate is activated.
# Activate the 3 Geo totems using Zhongli's tap Elemental Skill Geo Constructs or held Elemental Skill and use the unlocked device to open the door.
# Defeat the hilichurls and the Pyro Abyss Mage.
#* The third missable Common Chest is to the left inside the doorway on a higher platform near the fight. Grab it after the fight using a Geo construct.
# Go towards the last relic (sword) to start a cutscene.
#* If you haven't gotten it yet, head back to the entrance door of the room to grab the third missable common chest on a higher platform using a Geo construct.
# Go north through the newly opened door to catch up with Wanyan.
# Talk to Wanyan. Open the Precious Chest before the exit.
