Navia's hair is curled in four curls drills behind her back, and two curled strands in front and a black bow in the back   

Navia wears a bodysuit with a open back sleeveless bodice in navy blue, white, and black with gold details. A layered black and yellow long skirt opens at the front, revealing a white miniskirt, while splits open in the back. Her detached puff sleeves are trimmed with black lace, white ruffles, and navy and yellow bows, after which tighter-fitting sleeves with golden decorations and blue stones continue until ending in a slight bell at her wrist. Her {{Ousia}}-aligned {{Geo}} [[Vision]] is pinned to the yellow bow at her left shoulder. A large black and yellow bow, adorned with an ornate golden decoration featuring a blue gem and dangling blue drop, sits at the top of her skirt at the back and the ship's helm at both sides of her hip. She wears a sheer black glove on her right arm

Navia wears black thigh-high boots with blue gems. Her accessories consist of a large hat with elaborate decorations, such as a black bow with ornate gold and blue adornment and a white soft feather sitting at a slight angle.
