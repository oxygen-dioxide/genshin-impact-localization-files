'''Magical Crystal Chunks''' are blue crystals that are currently only used to forge [[Mystic Enhancement Ore]] using [[Original Resin]].

==How to Obtain==
{{See also|Mining Outcrops}}
They can only be obtained by breaking '''Magical Crystal Ore''' that spawn in [[Mining Outcrop]]s after [[Adventure Rank]] 30. See the gallery or the '''[https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=80 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for specific locations.

They can be harvested by attacking their destructible nodes, dropping 1–3 Magical Crystal Chunks. Magical Crystal Ore can be broken more quickly, like all {{Geo}} objects, by using [[Blunt Attack]]s. They respawn daily in different locations, referring to [[Mining Outcrops]] and will spawn additional Crystal Ores alongside the Magical Crystal Ore.

In [[Co-Op Mode]], each nearby player will get their own drops with amounts randomized separately and players will not be able to see others' drops. Unlike most [[Materials]], they cannot be affected by {{Anemo}} abilities that may move them.
