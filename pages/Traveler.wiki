The '''Traveler''' is the playable protagonist of ''[[Genshin Impact]]''. In the opening cutscene, twin siblings from another world travel through the universe, until an [[Unknown God|unknown god]] blocks their path. The player gets to choose either '''Aether''' (male) or '''Lumine''' (female) as the traveler and the [[Traveler's Sibling]] becomes captured.

Their power to travel is sealed, leaving them stranded on [[Teyvat]]. They save [[Paimon]] by fishing her out of the water and she accompanies them as their new travel companion. Together they set out on a journey to find [[The Seven]] and reunite with the Traveler's lost sibling.

Although players can choose the name they want to be referred by, the [[Traveler's Sibling]] refers to the Traveler by their real name, regardless of their custom name. In [[Natlan]], the Traveler also gains the [[Ancient Name]] {{Ancient Name|TMN|'''Tumaini'''|bearer=1}}.

==Gameplay Info==
===Ascensions and Stats===
{{Character Ascensions and Stats}}

===Elemental Alignment===
At the beginning of the game and in {{Quest|The Crux Clash (Quest)|showType=0}}, the Traveler is "unaligned," a special elemental state exclusive to them. When unaligned, the color of the Traveler's "vision" and background when they are selected in the [[Character Menu]] is gray. Although the Traveler's Profile lists their [[Constellation]] properly as Viator/Viatrix, attempting to open the Constellation tab will show a blank screen with "Constellation Unavailable" in the bottom-right corner. When unaligned, the Traveler has only one talent, Normal Attack: [[Past Memories]].

When unaligned, screens that show character cards with their elements show a gray "no" symbol (🚫︎) in the place of the element symbol.

Shortly after the beginning of the game, the Traveler will unlock their {{Anemo}} Talents and Constellation by resonating with the first [[Statue of The Seven]] in [[Mondstadt]]. They can resonate with any other Statue of The Seven they find and change their element to match the statue's element. ''See [[Teyvat]] for each region's element.''

However, the Traveler does not gain the {{Pyro}} element upon resonating with a Statue of The Seven in [[Natlan]], due to corrupted [[Ley Line]]s in the region. They instead unlock their abilities during {{Quest|Where All Hopes Lie|showType=0}}.
