'''Aramuhukunda''' is an [[Aranara]] and quest-exclusive [[NPC]]. He is a historical figure of the Aranara, who repaired the [[Varuna Contraption]] alongside [[Aradasha]] and [[Traveler's Sibling|Nara Varuna]]. It is known later in the [[Aranyaka]] [[World Quests|World Quest]] Series that Aramuhukunda turned into a [[Vasara Tree]] to seal [[Marana's Avatar]]. He was the first Aranara to sprout from one of many pomegranate seeds borne by the [[Fane of Ashvattha|Ashvattha Tree]].<ref name="FFSAT">{{Ref/Quest|For Fruits, Seeds, and Trees}}</ref>

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* Aramuhukunda may be named after {{W|Muchukunda|King Muchukunda}}, an ancestor of {{W|Rama}} in Hindu mythology. According to the {{W|Mahabharata|''Mahabharata''}} epic, Muchukunda fought alongside the {{W|Deva (Hinduism)|gods}} against the demonic {{W|Asura|asuras}}, before retiring to a cave where he fell into a deep slumber.
** Aramuhukunda giving power to [[Arama]] was probably also a reference to this, as Arama may be named after Rama.
