''Available before completing ''An Eye for an Eye''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Carranza:''' Math isn't just beautiful, it's practical. I wish more people understood that.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius_Invokation_TCG/Stage/Carranza/Meticulous_Calculations|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Carranza:''' Thanks for the match, I've learned a lot from our encounter.
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Carranza:''' Looks like my deck needs a rethink...
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here?
::'''Carranza:''' Waiting. I heard a rumor and if it turns out to be true, I will take action.
::{{DIcon}} I don't understand what you're talking about...
::'''Carranza:''' Excellent. I don't want you to understand, because if you did, you would become a rival.
::'''Carranza:''' But if you really are in desperate need of someone to talk to, we could discuss something else entirely. Something that will not harm anyone's interests. Math, for example...
::{{DIcon}} That's my cue to leave.
::'''Carranza:''' I'll see myself out.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry to bother you.
::'''Carranza:''' Until next time.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''An Eye for an Eye''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Carranza:''' It's important to study during your free time. Studying theater brings only the tiniest of results. It's better to study more practical subjects... Math, for example.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Same as above)
:{{DIcon}} Why are you here?
::'''Carranza:''' If you're allowed to be here, surely I am. This place is ideal for usage as a classroom. I can start my undertaking here.
::{{DIcon}} ...Undertaking?
:::'''Carranza:''' Ideally, I would help everyone realize the beauty of mathematics. I know that is not realistic, though.
:::'''Carranza:''' So I will teach those willing to learn some practical mathematics. This will be much more meaningful than what the Tri-Coupon Troupe is doing.
:::{{DIcon}} They both have their benefits.
::::'''Carranza:''' But you have to understand that very few people can manage both at once.
:::{{DIcon}} Good luck.
::::'''Carranza:''' Thanks.
::{{DIcon}} Good luck.
:::'''Carranza:''' Thanks.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry to bother you.
::'''Carranza:''' Until next time.
