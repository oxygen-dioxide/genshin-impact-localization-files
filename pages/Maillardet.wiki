===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available only before beginning the player's first fight against the [[Icewind Suite]].''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Maillardet:''' {{MC|m=Sir, ma'am|f=Good ladies}}, I wish you a good morning, afternoon, and evening!
:'''Maillardet:''' My name is Maillardet, a researcher with the [[Fontaine Research Institute]]. I believe the two of you are here to witness the Icewind Suite?
:'''Maillardet:''' According to Mr. [[Bossuet]]'s original plan, Coppelius and Coppelia are [[Clockwork Meka|clockwork meka]] dedicated to the art of dance.
:'''Maillardet:''' But after I took over the project, I also added in some of my understanding of Pneumosia...
:'''Maillardet:''' So as you can see, not only are they good at dancing, but they are also highly capable fighters!
:'''Maillardet:''' However, I believe that there's still much room for improvement. We require large amounts of experimental data to further increase their combat prowess.
:'''Maillardet:''' I might have gotten too passionate during the development phase &mdash; and from that came two different combat modes for Coppelius and Coppelia based on the differences between Pneuma and Ousia...
:'''Maillardet:''' They are {{color|buzzword|Dirge of Coppelia}} and {{color|buzzword|Nemesis of Coppelius}}. That is to say, we'll need two times the research data!
:'''Maillardet:''' As long as we can iterate on them smoothly, the joy of our success will be doubled.
:'''Maillardet:''' And the coming of that joy now rests upon your shoulders, brave warrior!
::{{Tutorial|Icewind Suite Drops}}

:'''Maillardet:''' What do you say, bold {{MC|m=sir|f=ma'am}}? Would you be willing to join our machines in their dance?
:{{DIcon}} Try "Dirge of Coppelia."
:;(Enter combat)
:{{DIcon}} Try "Nemesis of Coppelius."
:;(Enter combat)
:{{DIcon}} Let's do this later.
::'''Maillardet:''' The dance floor is always open for you.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available during subsequent interactions.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Maillardet:''' {{MC|m=Sir, ma'am|f=Good ladies}}, are you ready to take part in the Icewind Suite?
:{{DIcon}} Try "Dirge of Coppelia."
:;(Enter combat)
:{{DIcon}} Try "Nemesis of Coppelius."
:;(Enter combat)
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Icewind Suite...
::'''Maillardet:''' What would you like to know?
::{{DIcon}} What's the story of the Icewind Suite?
:::'''Maillardet:''' A fine question!
:::'''Maillardet:''' Like how Coppelius was defeated in a war against temptation, and was thus punished. Or how Coppelia so loved him that she nearly died from grief as a result.
:::'''Maillardet:''' Or how, to save the imprisoned Coppelius, Coppelia would set out on a journey.
:::'''Maillardet:''' Or how, no matter how things go, the drama shall end in a lovers' dance.
:::'''Maillardet:''' Haha! Well, actually, that was just me making some story bits up. I mean, I'm no literary scholar, just a researcher who works with clockwork meka.
:::'''Maillardet:''' As far as I'm concerned, their function is more important than their story.
:::'''Maillardet:''' However, if you're that interested in the story... Well, I'll consider.
::{{DIcon}} Why do they need combat skills?
:::'''Maillardet:''' Um... Well, actually, Mr. Bossuet was against that at first, too.
:::'''Maillardet:''' I guess you could consider this... my personal interest?
:::'''Maillardet:''' See? Now that Coppelius and Coppelia have combat abilities, their dance now exudes elegance as well as power!
:::'''Maillardet:''' Regardless of what anyone else thinks, I believe that this was a successful attempt.
:::'''Maillardet:''' Of course, there was a happy accident involved... With Mr. Bossuet's departure from the Institute, there's no one left to reject my research plans!
:{{DIcon}} Let's do this later.
::'''Maillardet:''' The dance floor is always open for you.

===Dialogue Set #3===
''Available once the Icewind Suite is defeated but has not respawned.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Maillardet:''' Bold {{MC|m=sir|f=ma'am}}, the data sample collection and repair of our clockwork machines will take some time, so please wait patiently in the meantime.
