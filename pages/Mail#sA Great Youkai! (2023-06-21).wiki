|text      = The children told me that a huge youkai has appeared in the mountains! Its body is gigantic, its laughter terrible, and it loves eating desserts! Any dango left around in a basket disappears in a flash! It even delights in stealing candy right out from your hands, and even takes the wrapper! Truly, evil beyond description!

But after it eats too many sweet and sticky desserts, the great youkai becomes sluggish. The kids say that if the invincible and great hero Yoimiya chooses that moment to strike, she'll definitely be able to take it down without breaking a sweat! And if we defeat it, a giant cake will appear in its stomach, and it'll even have candles on it! I bet you've never seen a youkai like that before, right? Want to go defeat it with me?

I'll pick you up!
