|text    = Listen, my fondness for sweet foods somehow reached the ears of the soldiers at [[Watatsumi Island]]. As a result, they prepared a cake for me, saying, "Gorou, please take it."

Conditions at Watatsumi Island are not that well, and I should exercise restraint as a general... But if I refuse this cake, I'm afraid I'll disappoint them.

So I try to put myself in their shoes! If I receive a letter asking for help in a similar situation, how should I give advice?

"Share this cake with soldiers and friends, and when there is something good in the future, share it with others."

Yep! That's the way to go!

Let's have the cake together!
