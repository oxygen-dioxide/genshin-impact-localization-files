{{Quest Description|Katheryne of the Liyue Harbor [[Adventurers' Guild]] seems to be looking for you...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Katheryne)
:'''Katheryne:''' Hello there, Traveler. Great timing: we have a commission that I believe would best be taken up by you.
:{{DIcon}} Is it a dangerous commission?
:{{DIcon}} Will it be difficult?
:'''Katheryne:''' Well, it involves a hitherto unknown Domain.
:'''Katheryne:''' Though the Guild has undertaken extensive investigations into that Domain, we have yet to achieve results of any particular value.
:'''Katheryne:''' Honglang, who is in charge of this investigation, says that he needs the assistance of a highly adaptable adventurer.
:'''Katheryne:''' You were the first person I thought of, Traveler.
:{{DIcon}} What sort of Domain is this...
:'''Katheryne:''' Honglang is at the entrance to this Domain. If you're willing to help, you can go ask him what he needs.
:'''Katheryne:''' We're counting on you, Traveler.
----
;(Talk to Honglang)
:'''Honglang:''' What's with this Domain...
:{{DIcon}} Hey there, about the commission...
:'''Honglang:''' Eh? You... Oh, so you're the one Ms. Katheryne called in?
:'''Honglang:''' I've heard that you're flexible, highly experienced, and one of our top adventurers to boot...
:{{DIcon}} That's about right.
:{{DIcon}} I guess you could say that...
:'''Honglang:''' Wonderful! That's very reassuring indeed.
:{{DIcon}} Still, could you tell me about this Domain...?
:'''Honglang:''' Ah, yes, right. Sorry. Let me fill you in...
:'''Honglang:''' Well, here's what happened: some time back, a team of adventurers found this strange, large door out in the wild... You're looking at it right now, naturally.
:'''Honglang:''' Once they had passed through this gate, the team entered an unknown Domain.
:'''Honglang:''' According to the first batch of adventurers, the Domain was just an "empty room" when they first entered it.
:{{DIcon}} One moment. What do you mean?
:{{DIcon}} An empty... room?
:'''Honglang:''' I'm just giving an example. To be precise, it was an area "about 52 paces in length, 52 paces in breadth, and of unknown height."
:'''Honglang:''' For 52 paces either way, the area was an ordinary stone-tiled floor, but all the areas beyond were filled with a deep gray smoke.
:'''Honglang:''' Also, when someone tried to cross over the border into the area beyond the first 52 paces...
:'''Honglang:''' They would either mysteriously change direction and start walking the opposite way, or suddenly disappear and appear behind everyone else.
:'''Honglang:''' Whatever the case, it was impossible to cross this 52-pace area.
:{{DIcon}} Did they try using any other tools to explore the place?
:'''Honglang:''' They did, of course. But thrown objects would return to their original places, and even the light of torches could not penetrate further than 52 paces away.
:'''Paimon:''' So, you'd like our help in investigating this place?
:'''Honglang:''' That is the case. However... you won't just be doing "exploration."
:'''Honglang:''' I don't think it's possible to explain out here. Let's continue inside.
----
;(Talk to Honglang inside the domain)
:'''Paimon:''' This...
:'''Paimon:''' You sure this is the same place as that "empty room" you talked about?
:{{DIcon}} This just looks like a normal Domain...
:{{DIcon}} Well, this place looks familiar...
:'''Paimon:''' Exactly! Isn't this just an ordinary ruin? Y'know, the ones we visit all the time?
:'''Honglang:''' This is indeed the Domain we mean to explore.
:'''Honglang:''' And as for the reason why it looks like this...
:'''Honglang:''' That's because this Domain changed its form not long ago.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh?
:{{DIcon}} It "changed its form"? Into this?
:'''Honglang:''' That's right. This Domain transforms based on people's wishes.
:'''Honglang:''' According to the leader of the adventure team at that time, they'd started to lose patience with this place after exploring it for some time to no avail.
:'''Honglang:''' One of their members began to grumble under their breath.
:'''Honglang:''' "If this was an ordinary Domain, we would've finished exploring it long ago."
:'''Honglang:''' Hungry and tired as they were, the rest of the team expressed approval of that member's view.
:'''Honglang:''' And as more people began to concur, the team suddenly found themselves in "an ordinary Domain."
:'''Honglang:''' This "ordinary Domain" contained mechanisms, paths, treasure... even torches that were still burning.
:'''Honglang:''' The adventure team judged themselves unable to deal with such a situation, and thus reported back to the Guild immediately.
:'''Honglang:''' In response, we quickly sent people to conduct further investigations.
:'''Honglang:''' However, all we know even now is that this Domain can change according to a person's will.
:'''Honglang:''' If many people enter the Domain at once, then it will react to the person with the strongest thoughts.
:'''Paimon:''' Wow! Does this mean that it could create, say, the entire Liyue Harbor in here?
:'''Honglang:''' We've tried this, but to no avail. Perhaps our desire to create Liyue Harbor just wasn't strong enough.
:'''Honglang:''' Whatever the case, we are currently gathering adventurers to enter this Domain and cause all manner of changes according to their desires.
:'''Honglang:''' We hope that we might be able to figure out some of the rules and principles behind the changes this Domain undergoes, and thus get answers from there.
:{{DIcon}} In that case, how should I operate this place?
:{{DIcon}} Is there some special method to all this?
:'''Honglang:''' Well, you see that mechanism over there? That's a "trigger" that we put in place. One of our adventurers dreamed this one up, in fact.
:'''Honglang:''' In simple terms, his desire was "to be able to change this Domain only when we touch this mechanism."
:'''Honglang:''' The Domain answered these wishes, but to ensure that this mechanism remains here, we have to periodically invite him back...
:{{DIcon}} Huh, to think that you could do something like that...
:'''Honglang:''' If not for some of these contingencies, this Domain would keep changing all the time...
:'''Honglang:''' But if you look at it from a different angle, this Domain really is quite suited to training adventurers. I mean, just one thought, and all sorts of mechanisms and terrain can emerge in a blink of an eye!
:'''Honglang:''' Well, talk is cheap, though... So why don't you give it a go yourself?
:'''Honglang:''' See that golden "Adventure Coin" over there? That's a little something we created using our willpower as well.
:'''Honglang:''' Try getting ahold of that coin, would you?

;(Talk to Honglang again)
:'''Honglang:''' Try getting ahold of that coin, would you?

;(Talk to Honglang after getting the Adventure Coin)
:'''Honglang:''' Wow! That was pretty impressive. You got the hang of this place really quickly!
:'''Honglang:''' In that case, we're counting on you. Use all your wits and imagination to transform this Domain.
:'''Honglang:''' I do hope that we'll be able to understand the rules behind the changes of this Domain soon.
