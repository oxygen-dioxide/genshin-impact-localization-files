==Overview==
Higher-ups at Huishan Hall are studying the rare [[Archaic Stone (Says He Who Seeks Stone)|Archaic Stone]]s from The Chasm, which [[Muning]], a specialist from the [[Ministry of Civil Affairs]], was commissioned to find and bring back.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Says He Who Seeks Stone}}</ref> The changes in The Chasm resulted in diminished quality of the few Archaic Stones that are still there.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Archaic Stone (Says He Who Seeks Stone)}}</ref>

Huishan Hall has forbidden those who work in The Chasm from eating the plants and mushrooms that grow in the [[The Chasm: Underground Mines|underground mines]], as they may be harmful to the human body.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Missing Miner}}</ref>

After the events of [[The Chasm Delvers]], the [[Chasm Exploration Team]] became an official part of Huishan Hall.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Wherefore Did the Spiritstone Descend?}}</ref>

However, she anticipated that she would be offered a position, and in her [[Zhiqiong's Letter|letter]], she asks Muning to keep it for her in case she ever comes back.</ref>
