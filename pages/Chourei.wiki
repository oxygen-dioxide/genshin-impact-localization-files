:{{DIcon|TCG}} Duel
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Chourei/No Fighting, No Fighting!|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Chourei:''' Umm... How exactly did I win again?
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Chourei:''' Uhh... How did I lose so suddenly?
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Chourei:''' Hm? I'm here to maintain order at the port.
::'''Chourei:''' To be honest, this port is very safe, and there aren't many issues. The most dangerous thing that has happened so far was a dispute between the captains of two cargo ships about who should enter the port first.
::'''Chourei:''' [[Afsoon|One of the captains]] let their emotions get the better of them, and jumped directly from their own ship's mast to confront the [[Xing Cheng|other captain]].
::'''Chourei:''' Needless to say, everyone was pretty startled, and in the end, Ms. [[Cassigneul]] herself had to step in to mediate.
::'''Chourei:''' You should've seen how far that captain leaped. Are all sailors that strong?
::{{DIcon}} What exactly were they delivering...?
::'''Chourei:''' I remember one of the ships was a tea clipper from [[Liyue]], and the other was carrying spices from [[Sumeru]].
::'''Chourei:''' Speaking of tea, I've heard that there's a [[Jadevein Tea Eggs|delicacy]] in Liyue where they boil a bird's egg and then crack part of the shell.
::'''Chourei:''' Once they've done that, they soak it in tea along with various seasonings. The egg absorbs the aroma of the tea and produces a unique and layered flavor.
::'''Chourei:''' I wonder if there are any clever minds in Fontaine that can replicate this delicacy. I'd really like to taste it.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Chourei:''' Goodbye, and I wish you peaceful days ahead.
