'''Patrol Soldiers''' are [[NPC]]s located in [[Inazuma City]] encountered after completing [[Chapter II]], Act II, ''[[Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow]]''.

There are four patrol soldiers stationed in the upper levels of the city &mdash; one at the police station, one near the [[Teleport Waypoint]] at [[Tenshukaku]], and two at the [[Statue of the Omnipresent God]]. Running into one of the soldiers will trigger a voiced dialogue and the player will be automatically teleported to the bridge leading to Tenshukaku.

In [[Version/2.1|Version 2.1]], there are new patrol soldiers in Tenshukaku and in the alleyways of Hanamizaka, the lower level of the city. Players who run into them will trigger an unvoiced dialogue and be teleported to the same location.

After starting the {{Quest|Blind Loyalty, Reckless Courage}}, the soldiers will disappear from their posts.
