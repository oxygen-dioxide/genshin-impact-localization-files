Some legends say that they were family to the [[Kitsune Saiguu]] in ages past. After she disappeared, their kind slowly dwindled, and the Kitsune lost their mystical might, and now no longer speak.<br>The kitsune seem to have an inexplicable familiarity with the Realm Within, sometimes sitting peacefully in the distance, watching [[Tubby]] as she reposes.
