|description     = This main dish looks rather cute.
|desc_suspicious = However, its appearance betrays a lack of experience in the making, with the final product being every bit the hastily thrown together slapdash job. Who knows if the provisional head priestess Neko will accept this...
|desc_basic      = With [[Kiminami Anna]]'s help, this dish was made with the tastes of the provisional head priestess [[Neko]] in mind. Although it does not quite match the flavor that Hibiki used to produce, Lady Neko seems rather pleased with your work nonetheless, Due to lack of spices, humans might find this dish a tad on the plain side.
|desc_delicious  = The simple methodology used to make it has maximized flavor retention in its ingredients. Even cats who usually pay humdrum humanity little mind will surely come running over when they catch a whiff of this. Uh, wait a moment. Was this supposed to attract dogs, too?
