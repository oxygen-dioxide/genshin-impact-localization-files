It may sound easy, but it's surprisingly difficult! We celebrate our birthdays together every year, so it's incredibly tricky to hide a ploy like a "surprise party" from her. All we can do is misdirect and make alternate preparations.

For example, this year, I'd like to invite a "surprise guest"—That's right, it's you!

She's managed to figure out all the "surprises" ahead of time the last few years... though she did try hard to feign ignorance.

But if I can get you to come this year, that'll be the best "surprise" yet.

What do you think? Do you have time? I've already come up with an amazing magic trick for your big entrance, all we need to do is rehearse it a bit!
