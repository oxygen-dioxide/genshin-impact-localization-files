'''Tafazzoli''' is a Herbad in the [[Sumeru Akademiya]]'s [[Haravatat|Haravatat Darshan]].

==Profile==
Tafazzoli assisted [[Vahumana]] researchers in translating the [[Scroll of Streaming Song]]. However, he also made several footnotes after the fact to criticize Vahumana's translation and try to fill in omitted words. [[Yarshater]], a Vahumana Herbad, notes that Tafazzoli purposefully did not tell them about this while they were working together.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Scroll of Streaming Song}}</ref>
