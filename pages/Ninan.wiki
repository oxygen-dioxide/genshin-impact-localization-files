==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ninan:''' "Gong hei fat choy"... "Please pass on my regards to all the Uncles and Aunties"... So that's how the people of Liyue write to their families...
:{{DIcon}} Are you learning a foreign language?
::'''Ninan:''' Haha, no, I'm not doing a formal course of study or anything. This is just to satisfy my own sense of curiosity.
::'''Ninan:''' And please don't misunderstand me &mdash; I'll never open a client's letter to peek at what they're saying. Everything I know, the clients themselves told me to help me with my learning.
::'''Ninan:''' I can't leave Natlan easily, so of course, I've got to learn as much as I can from the tourists who are here to visit.
::'''Ninan:''' In return, I'll also teach them some phrases in our language.
::'''Ninan:''' Writing down some blessings in our language for the outlanders is always a fascinating experience.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry for interrupting you, then.
::'''Ninan:''' Don't worry, just come to me if you need to send out anything! I can also provide a transcription service.
