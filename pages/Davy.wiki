==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Davy:''' Ah, everything is so fresh and clear out in the wild. I'm so much more inspired here...
:'''Davy:''' My work will be far greater than the nonsense that woman comes out with!
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Davy knows; Version 1)
:::'''Davy:''' Anything of note? Hmm...
:::'''Davy:''' While I was wandering around looking for inspiration, I noticed something shiny out of the corner of my eye. To me, it looked like Crystal Ore...
:::'''Davy:''' But a rare type &mdash; at least, I haven't seen any of that quality before. The rough location was...
:::'''Davy:''' ...There. I've marked it on your map. Perhaps you might have some use for it?
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s nearby marked on the map)
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Davy knows; Version 2)
:::'''Davy:''' Anything of note? Hmm...
:::'''Davy:''' While I was wandering around looking for inspiration, I noticed something shiny out of the corner of my eye. Some sort of Crystal Ore, perhaps?
:::'''Davy:''' The rough location was...
:::'''Davy:''' ...There. I've marked it on your map. Perhaps you might have some use for it?
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s nearby marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Davy knows)
:::'''Davy:''' Hmm, nothing especially noteworthy for a traveler, I'd say. Not recently, anyway. ... Except for my singing, of course.
:{{DIcon}} Which woman?
::'''Davy:''' You'll probably run into her if you go to [[Springvale]]... She's my ex-wife, Myweiss. A bard, just like me.
::'''Davy:''' I'm convinced the only reason I ever looked her way is because I bashed my head when [[Stormterror]] attacked!
::'''Davy:''' Can you believe they used to call us Mr. and Mrs. Lovebard? It's so nauseating now that I think back on it.
::'''Davy:''' But the worst thing of all is her original compositions...
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about her work.
::'''Davy:''' Well. After the divorce, she started using her compositions as a way of stirring up controversy... Pfft. I, for one, do not consider anything she writes to be true poetry.
::'''Davy:''' She will do whatever it takes to smear my name... and that's when she was the irresponsible one who never contributed to the home!
::'''Davy:''' For example, we had a clear agreement that we would take it in turns to do the cooking and the housework. But every time I got back from a performance, she was never there. So I ended up cooking all the meals and doing all the housework myself!
::'''Davy:''' At least I understand now &mdash; love is a big old hoax!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Davy:''' Goodbye! Come and listen to my new ballad when it's ready &mdash; it's called the Manacles of Matrimony.
