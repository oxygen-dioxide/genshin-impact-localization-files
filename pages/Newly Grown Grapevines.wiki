|description    = A rather short grapevine rack.<br>It is said that the height of a grapevine is dependent on sunlight and rain, and that this affects the quality of the fruits. Therefore, a good manager will adopt different approaches to different breeds of grapes and control the height of the grapevines with precision. The [[Dawn Winery]] has always been at the fore of this particular art.
