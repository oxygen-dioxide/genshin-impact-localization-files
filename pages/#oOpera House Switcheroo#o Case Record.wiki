|width=150px|[[File:Case Record Gardes Investigation Report.png|100px]]<br>Gardes Investigation Report
|The investigation from the [[Garde]]s indicates that the fireworks launched at the tail end of the magic performance set the rope dangling the water tank alight, causing the tank to fall and kill [[Cowell]], who was within it. It seems evident that Lyney is the likeliest user of the prop to commit a crime. However, the reason for the victim being Cowell and the reason for the chosen lady's disappearance remain mysteries.

{{A|vo fdaq003 55 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoever the murderer was, they must have made preparations well beforehand.
|-
|[[File:Case Record Special Rope.png|100px]]<br>Special Rope
|This rope was used to suspend the water tank. It suddenly broke when the fireworks were being launched onstage. The investigation has shown that the location where the rope snapped was made of flammable material.

{{A|vo fdaq003 55 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This rope was obviously tampered with!
|-
|[[File:Case Record Random Number Selector.png|100px]]<br>Random Number Selector
|This device was used during Lyney's magic performance to choose a lucky member of the audience. However, the Gardes have found that it will generate the exact same number no matter what. Clearly, someone has tampered with it.

{{A|vo fdaq003 55 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' People needed to register and reserve a seat for the show. That, combined with this number selector, could allow you to pick a young lady instead of some old fogey.

|[[File:Case Record Dropped Hook Rope.png|100px]]<br>Dropped Hook Rope
|A rope that has fallen to the ground. A metal hook has been tied to one end of this rope. Its use is unclear.

{{A|vo fdaq003 55 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This is probably a prop too. Looks like it could hook on to a lot of things, like {{Traveler}}'s fishing rod.
|-
|[[File:Case Record Broken Flower Vase.png|100px]]<br>Broken Flower Vase
|There are many pieces of a broken flower vase on one side of the tunnel. All the water within has been spilled. Judging from the distance, it seems unlikely that it was knocked over by the trolley meant to transport the magic box.

{{A|vo fdaq003 55 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This flower vase is probably a prop for the show, but it also could have been used in the crime...
|-
|[[File:Case Record The Young Lady's Clothes.png|100px]]<br>The Young Lady's Clothes
|The clothes belonging to [[Halsey]] &mdash; the lady who went missing &mdash; were found in the tunnel. The reason for this remains unknown.

{{A|vo fdaq003 55 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't get this at all. You think about it for a bit, {{Traveler}}!

!colspan=2|Opera House
|-
|width=150px|[[File:Case Record The Deceased's Identity.png|100px]]<br>The Deceased's Identity
|The deceased is one of Lyney's assistants, named Cowell. He was well-trusted by all his colleagues. His job was setting up and inspecting the props, as well as assisting with the show and keeping the crowd engaged.

{{A|vo fdaq003 55 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why would it be him? How strange...
|-
|[[File:Case Record Information About the Missing Lady's Identity.png|100px]]<br>Information About the Missing Lady's Identity
|Halsey is the missing person. She's a famous painter, and came to watch the magic show in order to take a break from her own creative work. She isn't known to have been entangled in quarrels with any of the members of Lyney's magic troupe.

{{A|vo fdaq003 55 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Gosh, no wonder the serial disappearances never got solved...
|-
|[[File:Case Record Strange Sound During the Magic Show.png|100px]]<br>Strange Sound During the Magic Show
|During the switching performance, there was an audible thump that many audience members heard.

{{A|vo fdaq003 55 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We all heard that noise... didn't we?
|-
|[[File:Case Record Entrances and Exits to the Opera House.png|100px]]<br>Entrances and Exits to the Opera House
|No one left the opera house during the magic show, and after the incident happened, only those who had their identities cleared by the Gardes could leave.

{{A|vo fdaq003 55 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The performance would not have been visible from where the doors were guarded. Heh, if Paimon were on duty, she would've snuck back into the audience seating.
|-
|[[File:Case Record Audience-Side Magic Box Structure.png|100px]]<br>Audience-Side Magic Box Structure
|The magic box at the center of the audience stands has 2 layers, and beneath it is an entrance to an underground tunnel. This was how the lucky audience member was meant to have been transported without the audience noticing.

{{A|vo fdaq003 55 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, there was no chance Paimon could've seen that the box had two layers...
|-
|[[File:Case Record Onstage Magic Box Structure.png|100px]]<br>Onstage Magic Box Structure
|The magic box onstage has an additional layer to its rear, in which Lynette, in Lyney's clothes, remained hidden. She would appear at the end of the magic trick and lead people to believe that Lyney had been able to instantly move to the box on the other side.

{{A|vo fdaq003 55 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And that's why only the two of them can perform this trick!
|-
|[[File:Case Record Probability of Third Person Being Involved.png|100px]]<br>Probability of Third Person Being Involved
|"Neither Cowell nor Halsey had a motive. But after having talked to [[Navia]], the likelihood of a third person being involved seems very low too.

{{A|vo fdaq003 55 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There was no third person, and Paimon didn't eat more than three macarons either!
|-
|[[File:Case Record File.png|100px]]<br>The Magic Trick
|Lyney gave a detailed account of how the trick was supposed to work: By using a box inside a box, the idea was for the box containing the audience member to be transported across via a tunnel underneath, and Lyney himself would also use this tunnel to get to the other side. Meanwhile, having changed her outfit, Lynette and her assistant would take charge of on-stage interactions.

{{A|vo fdaq003 55 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Digging a tunnel just for a magic trick. That must've been a lot of work!
|-
|[[File:Case Record Water from the Primordial Sea.png|100px]]<br>"Water from the Primordial Sea"
|The [[Primordial Sea|liquid]] discovered in the "Opera House Switcheroo" case. It has the ability to dissolve Fontainians into water... Navia believes that this shocking finding has shed new light on [[Callas|her father]]'s case.

{{A|vo fdaq003 55 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who would've imagined that people could really turn into water...
|-
!colspan=2|Tunnel
|-
|[[File:Case Record Tunnel Vent.png|100px]]<br>Tunnel Vent
|The tunnel vent looks like it could allow one person passage, barely, but leaving along with the missing lady seems an unrealistic prospect.

{{A|vo fdaq003 55 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That size wouldn't have been a problem for Paimon.
|-
|[[File:Case Record Lyney's Statement.png|100px]]<br>Lyney's Statement
|Lyney claims that he headed to the chamber containing the [[Oratrice]] core upon entering the tunnel and did not witness the crime taking place, and thus did not hear the thud. As a member of the magic troupe, Cowell must have known in advance that Lyney would leave, and he may have thusly judged that he had enough time to commit the crime.

{{A|vo fdaq003 55 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* Paimon hopes he's telling the truth...
|-
|[[File:Case Record File.png|100px]]<br>The Voice in the Oratrice Core Chamber
|Lyney claims to have heard a mysterious voice within the chamber that houses the Oratice core within the opera house's underground structures.

{{A|vo fdaq003 55 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Doesn't seem likely that anyone could've been there...
