{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before completing the [[Aranyaka]] quest series)
:'''Araja:''' Oh, it's Nara (Traveler). Do you have any questions for me?
:{{DIcon}} Do you need a hand with anything?
::'''Araja:''' Oh, thank you, Nara (Traveler). As you can see, I'm doing rather well.
::{{DIcon|Quest}} Are any Aranara in need of help?
:::'''Araja:''' Oh, well... Go to the center of Vanarana, and you should see Arapacati there. Something has been troubling her lately.
::;(Starts [[An Unwavering Culinary Dream]] quest series)
::{{DIcon|Quest}} Is there anything else to be done for Festival Utsava?
:::'''Araja:''' About that, Arakavi should be at the center of Vanarana. I think he's also in need of help for Festival Utsava.
::;(Starts [[Encounter in the Woods]] quest series)
:{{DIcon}} About "[[Marana]]"...
::'''Araja:''' That's a story from very long ago...
::'''Araja:''' A long time ago, Aranara walked the earth and made friends with Nara and all living creatures. There was no Marana then. Until a disaster that occurred many, many moons ago...
::'''Araja:''' [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] returned to Sarva, and the Marana's rampage through the earth began. Once the forest recovered its vitality, the Aranara hid the real Vanarana in a dream to protect themselves.
::'''Araja:''' The forest didn't know death, until a day came when the trees realized that withered flowers and dead animals covered the earth.
::'''Araja:''' On the same day, the earth remembered the dark, poisonous blood it had once devoured, or was about to devour. The rivers thought of the descent of the sun, evaporating all water and leaving a red world behind.
::'''Araja:''' They realized that all things would meet their end, and so, Marana was born. It is the name of death, and those who know it shall die.
::'''Araja:''' Marana urges everything towards death. As for the tall, dark, and warped beings, they are the avatars chosen by Marana, the heralds of death.
::'''Araja:''' Of course. In my stories, Marana's Avatar takes many forms. Sometimes beasts, sometimes birds, sometimes Nara, sometimes blight...
::'''Araja:''' But stories are just stories, and they aren't my memories.
:{{DIcon}} About the Vasoma Fruit...
::'''Araja:''' It's a fruit full of energy. It grows on the memories and dreams in the earth, and it needs the help of Aranara and Nara to bear fruit.
::'''Araja:''' A Bija can be formed by feeding a Vasoma Fruit to the Ashvattha Tree. It's a great tree planted by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, and it's the origin of Aranara.
:{{DIcon}} About the [[Aranyaka (Gadget)|Aranyaka]]...
::'''Araja:''' It belonged to Nara Varuna. {{MC|She|He}} was a Golden Nara who was kind, brave, and honest, just like you.
::'''Araja:''' I still remember how the Aranara of that time missed {{MC|her|him}} and loved {{MC|his|her}} stories. But I believe that since Nara (Traveler) is here now...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Araja:''' Yes. I look forward to celebrating Festival Utsava with you.

===Dialogue Set #2===

;(After completing the Aranyaka quest series)
:'''Araja:''' Everything in the forest will never be forgotten. Nara (Traveler), your story will pass on and on among Aranara, Araja knows that.
:{{DIcon}} About Marana...
::'''Araja:''' It's a story from very long ago...
::'''Araja:''' A long time ago, Aranara walked the earth and made friends with Nara and all living creatures. There was no Marana then. Until a disaster that occurred many, many moons ago...
::'''Araja:''' Greater Lord Rukkhadevata returned to Sarva, and the Marana's rampage through the earth began. Once the forest recovered its vitality, the Aranara hid the real Vanarana in a dream to protect themselves.

::'''Araja:''' Marana urges everything towards death. As for the tall, dark, and warped beings, they are the avatars chosen by Marana, the heralds of death.
::'''Araja:''' ...Now that you defeated Marana's Avatar with Arama, and the forest sees another Ashvattha, everything should take a turn for the better.
:{{DIcon}} About the Aranyaka...
::'''Araja:''' Nara Varuna left this, and Arama is giving it to you. Arama thinks he did the right thing.
::'''Araja:''' It filled with stories between you and Aranara, right? Araja knows that Nara will forget about how to dream, and forget about us.
::'''Araja:''' However, as long as the Aranyaka keeps the records or our stories and names, you can always read it without the memories about Aranara.
::'''Araja:''' When that day comes, Araja hopes that you will find these stories interesting and touching.
:{{DIcon}} About [[Arama]]...
::'''Araja:''' Araja missed him very much. With Arama turning into the new Ashvattha, Araja's dreams have become quieter.
::'''Araja:''' The time when Nara and Aranara spend time together, and walk the shades together. Araja can't recall anything like that, but stories remain.
::'''Araja:''' Araja was hoping, Arama could see a similar world as a seed. But everything ends up in Sarva, where Nara and Aranara will be joined.
::'''Araja:''' Also, Araja is delighted, for the friendship between Arama and Nara (Traveler).
:{{DIcon}} About [[Arana]]...
::'''Araja:''' Arana is also an ancient Aranara, with so many blooms and rainfall captured in memories.
::'''Araja:''' Because of the overflowing love for Nara and the forest, Arana refuses to be Vasara Tree. Vasara Tree, can't play with Nara.
::'''Araja:''' Araja heard that, Arana and [[Rana|Narana]] went traveling together. All the stories and beautiful things on the trip, hopefully, will make up for Arana's loss.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Araja:''' Goodbye. If anything ever tires you, come for a rest.
