==Profile==
Citrus is the mixologist at the [[Calligraphy Tavern]]. Prior to the tavern's re-opening, she gets a kink in her neck and asks the [[Traveler]] to help collect the fruits she needs for her drinks. Being an origami creature, her neck extension is connected to the position of her tail.

===Appearance===
Citrus is a yellow origami alpaca with orange and pink accents. Her flank is decorated with pink flowers and ribbons.
