If not destroyed, they will explode after 3 seconds, each dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Dendro DMG}} and transforming into '''Scorched''' [[Floating Dendro Fungi]] to assist in battle.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|The lord of fungal beasts that lives in the heart of the woods and in the company of its kin.<br>Fungi grow wherever it is damp and fertile. They can always adapt to adversity, and their spores can spread anywhere there is room. Given time, this proud-looking bird-like beast might evolve into something yet more magnificent.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}
{{Description|Over many long years, this large fungal beast has morphed into a unique form.<br>Its intelligence has already reached and perhaps has even surpassed real animals, and it will actively hunt prey to obtain sustenance. Its tail has a lovely jade plumage that seems very similar to that of the ancient sacred beast that the Spantamad school reveres. As far as the logic of mimesis is concerned, it seems quite likely that the two beings once walked the earth together.|[[Archive]]}}
