{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the group of Tepetlisaurs)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, where is this mysterious place? So many little Tepetlisaurs...
:'''Paimon:''' Could it be some sort of... Tepetlisaurus gathering spot?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! ...Rrrawr?
:'''Paimon:''' {{Little One}} looks so excited! Not often that you get to meet so many companions all in one go, huh?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr?
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, you mean you wanna go over there and play with them? Come to think of it, {{Little One}} hardly ever gets to hang out with other little Tepetlisaurs...
:{{DIcon}} Be careful, okay?
:{{DIcon}} Don't be gone too long!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Uhh, Paimon's still a bit worried... Anyway, let's find somewhere to relax and have something to eat while we wait for {{Little One}}.
:{{Black Screen|You and Paimon find a nice spot nearby to rest until {{Little One}} is done playing.}}
:{{Black Screen|But you end up waiting longer than you expected...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Strange... How come {{Little One}} isn't back yet?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon sure hopes nothing bad's happened...
:{{DIcon}} Gotten a bit carried away with the fun and games, perhaps?
:'''Paimon:''' If so, we'll have to give him a good talking-to. The sun's nearly set!
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh... Let's go track it down before it gets so dark we can't even see.
----
;(Talk to [[Clever Little Tepetlisaurus]])
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, is there any chance you've seen...
:{{Black Screen|Paimon tells the clever little Teptlisaur what {{Little One}} looks like.}}
:'''Clever Little Tepetlisaurus:''' Rawr!
:'''Clever Little Tepetlisaurus:''' Rawr!!
:'''Paimon:''' Wait a minute, does that mean that you know we're looking for {{Little One}}? You really are a clever little critter, huh?
:'''Paimon:''' C'mon, let's catch up!

;(Talk to Clever Little Tepetlisaurus after following it)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, so many [[Berries]]... Thanks! Wait a sec, we're looking for {{Little One}}, not Berries!
:'''Clever Little Tepetlisaurus:''' Rrrawr?
:{{DIcon}} Anyway, we appreciate it!
:{{DIcon}} We're not the type to say no to Berries!
:'''Clever Little Tepetlisaurus:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Well, being given Berries is never a bad thing, but it seems like {{Little One}} isn't here. Let's keep looking!

;(Talk to Clever Little Tepetlisaurus while [[indwelling]] a Saurian, optional)
:'''Clever Little Tepetlisaurus:''' Let's eat, friend!
:'''Clever Little Tepetlisaurus:''' Berry, [[Cacahuatl]], [[Grainfruit]]!
----
;(Talk to Big Parenty Tepetlisaurus while indwelling a Saurian, optional)
:'''Big Parenty Tepetlisaurus:''' Hehe, so much energy... Very good...
:'''Big Parenty Tepetlisaurus:''' But... how many were there in total again...?
----
;(Talk to [[Dopey Little Tepetlisaurus]])
:'''Paimon:''' Hi! You haven't seen {{Little One}} around here, have you? Y'know, the new kid on the block...?
:'''Paimon:''' It's got a mark on its head and a scarf on its tail...
:'''Dopey Little Tepetlisaurus:''' Rrrawr?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, seems like it can't understand what we're saying.
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like we have no other choice but to go through them one by one...

;(Talk to Dopey Little Tepetlisaurus while indwelling a Saurian, optional)
:'''Dopey Little Tepetlisaurus:''' Grainfruit, yummy...
:'''Dopey Little Tepetlisaurus:''' *burp*
----
;(Talk to [[Lively Little Tepetlisaurus]])
:'''Paimon:''' Hello there, how do you do...
:'''Paimon:''' Uhh, wait a sec... Why has Paimon suddenly started greeting little Tepetlisaurs like this?
:'''Lively Little Tepetlisaurus:''' Rawr! Rawr!
:{{DIcon}} Why, Paimon, you're so polite!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, thanks...
:'''Paimon:''' But back to the matter at hand, this little Tepetlisaur clearly isn't {{Little One}}...
:'''Paimon:''' Well, let's just hope that {{Little One}}'s been having as much fun as this little one.

;(Talk to Lively Little Tepetlisaurus while indwelling a Saurian, optional)
:'''Lively Little Tepetlisaurus:''' Happy happy~ Me so happy~
----
;(Interact with [[Little Tepetlisaurus Learning How to Dig]])
:{{DIcon}} Caught you!
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, looks like we've got ourselves a little Tepetlisaurus digging about underground. This has to be&mdash;
:'''Little Tepetlisaurus Learning How to Dig:''' ?
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, that's not {{Little One}} either...
:'''Paimon:''' *sigh* How are there so many little Tepetlisaurs here? Where in [[Teyvat]] did {{Little One}} go?

;(Talk to Little Tepetlisaurus Learning How to Dig while indwelling a Saurian, optional)
:'''Little Tepetlisaurus Learning How to Dig:''' Oh no, been caught... Must... Dig faster!
----
;(Talk to [[Tree-Climbing Little Tepetlisaurus]])
:'''Paimon:''' Take a look at this little Tepetlisaurus... This one sure knows how to choose a spot for itself!
:'''Paimon:''' No, that can't be {{Little One}} either. There's no tail-scarf.
:'''Tree-Climbing Little Tepetlisaurus:''' Rrrawr?

;(Talk to Tree-Climbing Little Tepetlisaurus while indwelling a Saurian, optional)
:'''Tree-Climbing Little Tepetlisaurus:''' From stand here, all other Saurians small as bug...
----
;(After talking to all of the little Tepetlisaurs)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, where could he be... Eh, what's that? Seems to be some movement over there...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go take a look!

;(Talk to {{Little One}})
:'''Paimon:''' Aha! So you've been here snoozing away! No wonder we couldn't find you all this time...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Wrroh...
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like you had so much fun you completely tired yourself out.
:'''Paimon:''' But the world's a dangerous place, y'know! If you start feeling sleepy or need a rest, you've got to come find us first...
:{{DIcon}} I told you to be careful...
:{{DIcon}} I said not to be gone too long...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rowr...
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, alright... Nothing wrong with a bit of fun every now and again. But be more careful in the future, okay?
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, why don't we go say hi to that big Tepetlisaurus over there? Who knows, we might get another chance to hang out with this lot someplace else in the future!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!

;(Talk to the Big Parenty Tepetlisaurus)
:'''Big Parenty Tepetlisaurus:''' Roarrr?
:'''Paimon:''' Thanks for taking care of {{Little One}} all this time!
:'''Big Parenty Tepetlisaurus:''' Roarrr...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Uhh, well... Whatever they just said, it went right over Paimon's head.
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, it's about time we were off. Say goodbye, {{Little One}}!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr...
:{{DIcon}} Don't be sad, we'll see them again!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rowrr... Rawr!
:'''Big Parenty Tepetlisaurus:''' Roooar...
:'''Big Parenty Tepetlisaurus:''' Raaarrr&mdash;
:'''Little Tepetlisaurs:''' Rawr!
:'''Little Tepetlisaurs:''' Rawr, rrawr...
:'''Big Parenty Tepetlisaurus:''' Rrroar...
:{{Black Screen|The big Tepetlisaurus turns round, as if to signal that it was time that they were off...<br>The little Tepetlisaurs follow its lead, and together, they leave.}}
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr...
:'''Paimon:''' Aww, you're not feeling lonely are you, {{Little One}}?
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, don't forget that we're here by your side!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rowrr, rawr!
