==Summary==
;Where the Roses Bloom

A few days pass since Chevreuse's new lead on the case, resulting in the other members of the cast wondering of her whereabouts as the crew is almost done finishing up the film. Morris also returns, surprised that the film was going well. As Furina starts up the finishing scenes, the Traveler notices that their [[Kamera]] is not working. They manage to get a new one and begin the final scenes, just as [[Bonnot]] rushes in and informs Furina that the film had gone missing. The crew then set out to find the film, with Chiori finding it in the sewers and the group is busy seeing if anything was damaged. Furina is relieved that the film was found. Paimon wonders as to who would sabotage them at the last moment, though Furina states that they need to finish filming first.

With the remaining scenes wrapped up, Furina decides to celebrate by hosting a beach party. During the celebration, Yoimiya ropes Morris into helping her gather some fireworks, but after they enter the building, Morris hears a gunshot, and finds Yoimiya on the floor. This terrifies Morris as he demands to be let out, only for Chevreuse to appear, who intimidates him into admitting to his crimes. Though she points her musket at him, Chevreuse does not shoot him, instead stating that he's under arrest for Elisa's murder. She then senses someone behind her, who fires a shot at Morris, but she blocks it with her musket and states that Veronique, the shooter and prop manager, is also under arrest.

Yoimiya is surprised by the turn of events, while Veronique asks Chevreuse why she was not letting her get revenge on Morris. Morris also wonders as to what was going on, with Chevreuse explaining that it was all meant to make him confess to his crimes. She asks Yoimiya to bring the other Special Patrol members in and inform the rest of the crew that they were fine. With his guilt admitted, Chevreuse demands Morris tell them the truth. Morris does, stating that twenty years ago, he had an illicit affair with Elisa and left her pregnant, who was serving at his parents' estate as a maid. Believing that his parents would throw him and his inheritance out if the affair was revealed, he asked Elisa to leave, giving her plenty of Mora and to also get rid of the baby. Instead, she kept it to term and gave birth to two children and sent a photo of them to him sometime later. Having gotten into another relationship which would ruin him if word got out, he then hired someone to kill her.

Veronique reveals the fear she and her brother had when their mother was killed, and thus wanted revenge against the very person that caused them suffering. Chevreuse reveals that she already knew that he had killed the other man, as she could not feel a sense of regret from Baptiste and he could not reassemble the murder weapon at all. Thus, Baptiste had falsely admitted to the crime in order to distract the investigation and allow Veronique to kill the true suspect, but she had already suspected as much and Morris' own involvement in the film - he had signed up as an investor, but had intended to ditch them under "financial constraints" so the film would not advance. But to his expectations, Xavier had managed to finish the film, thus causing him worry and try to sabotage them.

Veronique is upset that Cheveruse was not upholding justice, having promised as such to her brother. Cheveruse admits that she was going to shoot him, but refrained as she knew that it was not proper justice, as there would be no society without it. However, she promises to inform [[Wriothesley]] to ensure that Morris would not live a comfortable life in prison. Yoimiya returns with Letellier and Turenna, who take the two into custody. Before she is taken out of the room, Veronique tells Cheveruse that she does not understand her reasoning and that justice was not served.

The Traveler then informs the rest of the crew of the truth, leaving Xavier shocked at the turn of events. Furina asks if they should do a reshoot, but Cheveruse declines, believing the current edition to be enough. Yoimiya then asks about Veronique; Cheveruse responds that her, Baptiste and Morris would all face judgement and would give Wriothesley "that" heads-up of their arrival. She then asks the Traveler and Paimon to wait for her by the sea after the party ends. Once there, Cheveruse gives them a short summary about her childhood, explaining her father's harsh training and why she joined the Special Security group. As they continue walking, they unexpectedly arrive at Baptiste's house, where they find the Rainbow Roses in full bloom.
