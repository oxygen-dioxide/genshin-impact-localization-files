The '''scullion''' is a character only seen in the [[manga]] who works in [[Diluc]]'s mansion. "Scullion" is likely his job title rather than his name.

==Profile==
The scullion is first seen serving wine during the party in Diluc's manor, narrowly dodging the guests until he bumps into a maid, who chews him out for still having trouble despite already being three months into his job. They witness [[Diluc]] and [[Seamus Pegg]] meeting with [[Krupp]] and [[Il Dottore]]. The scullion does not recognize Dottore and questions why Seamus is so respectful to him; the maid replies that the scullion is "new" to Mondstadt and has not heard of [[Ursa the Drake]], which was defeated by Dottore. The scullion is left speechless, and after the group leaves to meet in private, he is scolded to get back to work by the maid.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|1}}</ref>

Later, the scullion is seen during [[Ludi Harpastum]] as part of the crowd watching the woman chosen to throw the Harpastum on the [[Anemo Archon Statue]]. He comments that she is safe even if she is afraid of heights, as the process is protected by [[Jean]]'s Anemo power.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|11|1}}</ref>
