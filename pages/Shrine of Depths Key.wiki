The '''Shrine of Depths Key''' is an Adventure Item which can be used to unlock the [[Shrines of Depths]], allowing players to access the [[chest]] inside. Keys correspond to specific [[Teyvat#Major Nations|Nations]] but not specific shrines, meaning any key can be used to unlock any shrine in its corresponding nation.

10 Shrine of Depths Keys per nation are obtainable, allowing the player to unlock every shrine in its corresponding nation.
