==Weak Point Location==
<gallery>
Cryo Regisvine Weak Point.png
</gallery>
* The Weak Point is only exposed after the player has destroyed the shield at its corolla once. When the Weak Point is exposed, the appearance of the corolla will change.

==Abilities==
''Most ability names are unofficial.''
===Roots Phase===
The Cryo Regisvine enters this phase when the boss fight begins, or when it wakes up from its paralyzed state after its corolla core is destroyed. Its core will be located at its roots. Breaking its core using elemental reactions will paralyze the Cryo Regisvine. If the Regisvine has already entered Corolla before returning to Roots Phase, the '''Flail''' and '''Half Flail''' attacks may also be used in Phase 1.
{{Elemental Shield Data|Cryo|12|Roots Core}}

{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Stunned
|desc_1 = Destroying the Cryo Regisvine's shield at its core will stun it. {{Pyro}} is the most effective at damaging the shield.
|file_1 = Cryo Regisvine Stun

|name_2 = Ice Beams
|desc_2 = Flings two ice beams into an overlapping cross pattern, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}. It may follow up with another two beams in an outward cross pattern.
* This attack may be used in the Corolla phase if a player is within the area of the ground frozen by '''Rotary Spray'''.
* Indicated by its two lashes starting to glow brightly.

|name_3 = Homing Icicles
|desc_3 = Fires 2, 4, or 6 barrages of icicles that home toward the player, dealing '''12.5% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} on hit. These icicles will follow the character for a few seconds before losing their homing attribute.
* This attack may be used in the Corolla phase if a player is within the area of the ground frozen by '''Rotary Spray'''.
* Indicated when the Regisvine raises its lashes less high and a glowing effect traveling through its lashes.

|name_4 = Faceplant
|desc_4 = Charges and slams itself into the ground, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} and causing three trails of ice to spike from the ground, with each spike dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}.
* There is a small chance that the Regisvine may chain this attack three times consecutively if the player moves to the side. In the Corolla phase, the chance of triggering the chained version is greatly increased.
|file_4 = Cryo Regisvine Body Slam Single
|caption_4 = Single
|file_4_2 = Cryo Regisvine Body Slam Triple
|caption_4_2 = Triple

|name_5 = Spin
|desc_5 = A circle appears around the Regisvine indicating the radius of the attack. It will then flatten and stretch out its petals and spin, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} within the previously marked radius, knocking any characters back and infusing the ground in the radius with {{Cryo}}. The infused ground will deal '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} to characters who step on it every second.

|name_6 = Blizzard
|desc_6 = This attack is used if the Regisvine's core is not broken after a long period of time, and is always preceded by '''Spin'''. The Regisvine channels its Cryo powers and lets ice rain from the air, aiming at where the player is currently standing and also aiming slightly ahead of where the player is currently moving, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} on appearance and when they explode shortly after. Ice bolts will never spawn near the base and can also appear uncommonly in random positions around the arena. The fallen ice bolts will also leave behind a patch of Cryo that deals '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} to characters who step on it every second after exploding. This attack can be dodged by simply running around the arena, sprinting is not required.

===Corolla Phase===
The Cryo Regisvine enters this phase when it wakes up from its paralyzed state after its roots core is destroyed. Its core is located at its corolla during this phase. Upon entering this phase, it immediately performs '''Flail''' and '''Rotary Spray'''. If the corolla core is not destroyed after a long period of time, the core will return to its roots and the Regisvine will re-enter Roots Phase.
{{Elemental Shield Data|Cryo|6|Corolla Core}}

|desc_1 = Smashes its head on the floor and swings 360 degrees around its roots, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} and knocking players away.

Repeated DMG dealt by the beam is reduced according to the [[Damage Sequence]]. The infused ground will deal '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} to characters who step on it every second.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A monster formed from a vine that was imbued with the essence of biting frost within the [[ley line]]s.<br>Some studies suggest that plants are like the organs of the world, harmonizing the turbulent elemental energies of the ley lines. Concrete examples of this phenomena are [[Mist Flower]]s, [[Whopperflower]]s, and the like, which brim over with elemental energy.<br>In certain circumstances, certain plants will turn into creatures of monstrous size and intent &mdash; such as the Cryo Regisvines &mdash; in the course of many years.|[[Adventurer Handbook]] and [[Archive]]}}
