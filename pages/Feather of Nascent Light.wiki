{{Description|A dimly lustrous pinion steeped in strong memories.}}
'''Feather of Nascent Light''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Vermillion Hereafter]].

==Description==
Legend has it that a hero once plucked an eagle's feather from atop the highest cliff of [[The Chasm]].<br />
It is also said that those who could accomplish such a deed earned the right to die alongside the [[adepti]].<br />
<br />
"Going to one's death willingly in defense of the people... A good cause indeed."<br />
"Yet, if you think about it, this would be akin to a fish sinking into a deep pool or a bird plummeting into a forge."<br />
"I may yet achieve my own desire, but we shall go unknown, and ultimately unremembered."<br />
"Mortals like us are like feathers caught up in a whirlwind, floating into the deep sky."<br />
"Saving, defending... In the end, these are all pointless things, void of meaning."<br />
<br />
These dark murmurings shook the hearts of those who would never make a name for themselves.<br />
<br />
But the battle was over in the end, and many a soldier would rest eternally in the cavernous depths.<br />
The freakish cries of the dark forces were also silenced like fading ripples...<br />
And though mortal spans are short, the land will forever remember.
