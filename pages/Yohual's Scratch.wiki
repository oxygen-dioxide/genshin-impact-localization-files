|info          = Let the rhythms of passion resound throughout the land! Xilonen switches to high-speed combat blading gear and rushes forward a certain distance before dealing Nightsoul-aligned {{Color|Geo DMG}} based on her [[DEF]].<br>After using this, Xilonen will gain 45 [[Nightsoul point]]s and enter the [[Nightsoul's Blessing]] state. In this state, she will shift to the Blade Roller mode.<br><br>'''Source Samples'''<br>Xilonen has 3 Samplers with her that can generate different Soundscapes based on her other party members' Elemental Types, decreasing nearby opponents' corresponding [[Elemental RES]] while active.<br>The initial recorded Source Sample within each Sampler will be {{Color|Geo}}, and for each [[party]] member who is {{Color|Pyro}}/{{Color|Hydro}}/{{Color|Cryo}}/{{Color|Electro}}, 1 {{Color|Geo}} Sampler will change to that corresponding Element.<br>While Xilonen is in the Nightsoul's Blessing state, the {{Color|Geo}} Source Sample she carries will always be active. After unlocking her Passive Talent, "[[Netotiliztli's Echoes]]," Xilonen can trigger said Passive Talent's effects to regenerate Nightsoul points for herself. When her Nightsoul points hit the maximum, she will consume all her Nightsoul points and activate the 3 Source Samples she has on hand for 15s.<br>When the Source Samples are active, nearby opponents' corresponding Elemental RES will decrease. Source Sample effects of the same Elemental Type cannot stack. Xilonen can trigger these effects even when off-field.<br><br>'''Nightsoul's Blessing: Xilonen'''<br>Continuously consume Nightsoul points. When these points are depleted or if used again, this Nightsoul's Blessing state will end. This state has the following traits:<br><ul><li>Switches to the Blade Roller mode, increasing Xilonen's Movement SPD and climbing speed, and she can perform high-speed leaps in Ocelot Form while climbing.</li><li>Xilonen's Nightsoul's Blessing has the following restrictions: When in this state, Xilonen's Nightsoul points have a 9s time limit. After this limit passes, her Nightsoul points will immediately expire.</li></ul><br>After Xilonen's Nightsoul points have expired while she is in the Nightsoul's Blessing state, she will no longer be able to generate Nightsoul points via the Passive Talent "Netotiliztli's Echoes."

'''Yohual's Scratch''' is [[Xilonen]]'s [[Elemental Skill]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* {{Talent Note|particles|4}}
* The '''7s''' cooldown starts once Xilonen's Nightsoul's Blessing state ends and not upon the Elemental Skill cast.
* The RES reduction effect has a horizontal range of '''10m'''.
* During her Nightsoul's Blessing, the [[Fall DMG]] Xilonen takes is reduced by '''50%'''. This also stacks additively with the Fall DMG reduction from performing a [[Plunging Attack]], causing her to take no Fall DMG plunging from any height.
* If Xilonen runs out of Nightsoul Points or Phlogiston while executing a Normal or Plunging Attack animation, the Nightsoul's Blessing state will not end until the animation is finished or interrupted by other means.
