:'''Potier:''' ~♪ The waters gleam, the fish they leap, the seafoam sings of night's deep sleep. ♪~
:'''Potier:''' ~♪ The homesick lightly grasp at sand, the shells bear their tears to their native land. ♪~
:{{DIcon}} Hello there.
::'''Potier:''' Well met, lovely one!
::'''Potier:''' Call me Potier &mdash; a street artist, I am. My talents are many, and my skills, infinite!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Lovely singing!
:::'''Potier:''' Thank you for your support! Parting is inevitable, but may my song accompany you on this beautiful day in Fontaine.
:::;(Obtain {{Item|Lumidouce Bell|x=4}})
::{{DIcon}} What else can you do?
:::'''Potier:''' I act, I do opera, I play the lyre... I can even do some magic.
:::'''Potier:''' I am an artist after all &mdash; I can do a little bit of everything.
:::'''Potier:''' Ah, if only the day would come when I can perform at the opera house &mdash; uh, not in the sense of standing trial, though.
:{{DIcon}} (Enjoy in silence...)
::'''Potier:''' ♪~

;(Nighttime)
:'''Potier:''' Do you need a lock picked, or perhaps switched?
:{{DIcon}} You do this business by night?
::'''Potier:''' Of course! Don't people usually realize that they've forgotten to bring their keys only upon returning home at night?
::'''Potier:''' Ah, wait, I get it &mdash; you're wondering if I'm doing something terrible here, are you?
::'''Potier:''' Don't worry, don't worry. I have principles and sense &mdash; and more importantly, I don't want to perform a "trial-standing show" at the opera house.
:{{DIcon}} You seem a little familiar...
::'''Potier:''' Oh, uh, you must've seen me playing the lyre on the streets during the day.
::'''Potier:''' "The waters gleam, the fish they leap~" Ring a bell?
::'''Potier:''' Now, I know what you're thinking. "How does this person know how to do everything?"
::'''Potier:''' Hehe, it never hurts to learn new skills, you know? Just little tricks for a little profit &mdash; and every little is a gain.
:{{DIcon}} I'm fine, thanks.
::'''Potier:''' No worries. Just call me up when you need me.
