The '''2-Star Series''' ''(unofficial name)'', as the name suggests, is a 2-star [[Weapon]] series. It is the only 2-star weapon series in the game, as no other 2-star weapons exist other than the weapons in this series.

This series does not have a shared [[Weapon#Passive|passive]], because 2-star weapons do not have passives at all. However, all weapons in this series have a shared base [[ATK]] range of '''33-243'''.

Likewise, the weapons in this series cannot be [[Weapon#Refining|refined]], as refinement is a feature exclusive to 3-star weapons and above.
