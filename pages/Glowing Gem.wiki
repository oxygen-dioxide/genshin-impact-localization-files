|description     = Specialized refinement material for Fading Twilight.<br />Cor Lapis delicately refined by ancient arts practiced by the early inhabitants of The Chasm. It glimmers slightly with a light that resembles either the radiance of dawn or the dying twilight. Appearing in caverns where none may see either form of light, it must have brought some small comfort to those who fought against the dark enemy.
