{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Vitruvia:''' Hello there. Is there any legal service I can provide?
:{{DIcon}} You're an... attorney?
::'''Vitruvia:''' Well, I wish I could've become a [[Champion Duelist]], but that's not happening in this life, I reckon.
::'''Vitruvia:''' I can't fight &mdash; like, I really can't. I'm the type who can knock herself on the head with a sheathed sword...
::'''Vitruvia:''' But if there's a talent I do have here, that's searching. As long as the case details are clear, I can quickly find all the relevant legal clauses.
:{{DIcon}} So, you do legal consultancy?
::'''Vitruvia:''' To be precise, I do consultancy on how to "escape the law."
::'''Vitruvia:''' My goal is to let my clients avoid run-ins with Champion Duelists and avoid entering the theater &mdash; except to enjoy performances, that is.
::'''Vitruvia:''' This is not hard to do. All legal systems have their flaws &mdash; and I know them as well as I do the holes in my socks.
::'''Vitruvia:''' Hmm... Speaking of that, I should probably spend some Mora to get a pair of new ones.
:{{DIcon}} I'm afraid not.
::'''Vitruvia:''' Ah, what a shame... I mean, how fortunate!
