{{Description|A wind generating device developed by Refait, senior researcher from [[Fontaine Research Institute|Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering]].<br>In [[Mondstadt]], it is necessary to pass an exam and obtain a license before using a [[Wind Glider|wind glider]] for travel. The relevant laws and regulations in [[Fontaine]] are quite developed, with even clearer rules, and a much stricter process. It would be even better if someone were to enforce them.|[[Archive]]}}
