==Trivia==
* <section begin="QingceTheme" />The following soundtracks share a theme:
** [[Peaceful Hike]]
** [[The Fading Stories]] <section end="QingceTheme" />
* The Chinese name of the track, {{zh|山风拂萝衣|Shānfēng Fú Luóyī|The Mountain Breeze Caresses the Hermit's Clothes,}} may be a reference to the poem {{zh|采樵作|Cǎijiāo-zuò|Composition of Firewood-Gathering}} by Tang Dynasty poet {{w|Meng Haoran}}. The poem reads:
:{|Class="wikitable" style="width: 90%"
! Chinese Text
! English Translation
|-
|{{zh|采樵入深山，山深树重叠。|rm=<br>Cǎijiāo rù shēnshān, shānshēn shù chóngdié.}}
| To gather firewood, one forays into the mountain deep / The trees overlap within the mountain depths.
|-
|{{zh|桥崩卧槎拥，路险垂藤接。|rm=<br>Qiáo bēng wòchá yōng, lù xiǎn chuíténg jiē.}}
| The collapsed bridge embraced by resting branches / The treacherous road connected by overhanging vines.
|-
|{{zh|日落伴将稀，{{Highlight|山风拂萝衣}}。|rm=<br>Rìluò bàn jiāng xī, shānfēng fú luóyī.}}
| The sun sets as my companions dwindle / {{Highlight|A mountain breeze gently caresses my clothes}}.
|-
|{{zh|长歌负轻策，平野望烟归。|rm=<br>Chánggē fù qīngcè, píngyě wàng yān guī.}}
| A loud, carefree song on my light walking stick / I return following the trails of hearth-smoke on the plains.
|}
* The Chinese name of [[Qingce Village]], {{zh|轻策庄|Qīngcè-zhuāng}}, may also derive from the final line of the poem, which uses the same phrase {{Lang|''qingce''|zh=轻策}} to refer to a walking stick.
