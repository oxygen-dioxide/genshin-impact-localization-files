|text      = Hey, so here I was enjoying my time off in the tavern, when I suddenly discovered something incredible.

Dandelion Wine! Nothing groundbreaking, right? But the way this kind smells... it's unique, unparalleled even! I'm guessing it's because certain ingredients used to brew it can only be picked during very particular seasons. All I know is, if I miss this barrel, it's hard to say whether or not I'll ever have the chance to drink it again...

And when it occurred to me that a dear far-away friend hadn't yet had the pleasure of smelling it, well, let's just say I knew I had to get this letter off pronto.

Your seat in [[Angel's Share]] is ready and waiting. I'm looking forward to seeing you.
