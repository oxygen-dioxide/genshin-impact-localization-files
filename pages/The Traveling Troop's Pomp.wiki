|description    = This military-style camp is filled with various goods. Defensive fortifications have been set up, and well-placed campfires lay the groundwork for night operations. In theory, at least, this type of encampment can withstand the assault from many foes, and can even form the fulcrum of a defensive line should there be sufficient manpower to do so.<br />No matter how bothersome the setup and transport of the materials might be, and no matter how the lack of tents that block the wind or rain may lead to rather tough conditions... Battle-hardened mercenaries need only a bed of straw to sleep soundly, and as such do not worry over-much about such small flaws.
