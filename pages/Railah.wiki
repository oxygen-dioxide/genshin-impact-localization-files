:'''Railah:''' Every result has a reason, and every reason has a consequence.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Duel
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Railah/Duel: Railah|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Railah:''' As the cause, so the effect. Would you like to try again?
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Railah:''' What? ...I lost? Hmm, but what is there to complain about anyway...
:{{DIcon}} Uh...
::'''Railah:''' Was it too difficult to understand?
::'''Railah:''' Ah, it's fine. That's what everyone thinks. You're not the first, and definitely not the last.
::'''Railah:''' It's just like my research. It doesn't matter if I think forward or go backward, the possibilities are always infinite.
::{{DIcon}} You're carrying out research here?
:::'''Railah:''' Knowledge does not change with the locale, and locale does not change with knowledge.
:::'''Railah:''' Rainforest and desert, permit and prohibition, wisdom and ignorance, life and death... Everything in the world is just like that.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Sounds reasonable but doesn't quite make sense in the meantime.
:::'''Railah:''' Hahaha, that means you have reached the threshold of wisdom.
:::'''Railah:''' Good, good. You are clever, even better than many scholars.
:::;(Obtain {{Item|Guide to Ingenuity}})
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Railah:''' Goodbye. Farewells and reunions are mutually fulfilling as well.
