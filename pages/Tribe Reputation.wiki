==Reputation EXP Sources==
===Weekly Bounties===
{{Main|Bounties}}
Upon reaching Reputation Level 1 in a tribe, their Bounties are unlocked. They can be completed by accepting a bounty from the Reputation NPC, going to the specified location(s), selecting the difficulty, defeating the enemy, and claiming the bounty reward from the Reputation NPC.

A total of 3 bounties can be completed each week, this limit is shared between nations and tribes. It should be noted that the bounties available reset after completing one so the highest bounty can be completed 3 times. All 3 bounties can be accepted simultaneously.

===Supply Notice===
{{Main|Supply Notice}}
Supply Notices are unlocked upon reaching Reputation Level 1.

===World Exploration===
World Exploration is progressed by solving puzzles, opening [[Chests]], wooden crate, and making offerings to [[Statue of The Seven|Statues of The Seven]].
