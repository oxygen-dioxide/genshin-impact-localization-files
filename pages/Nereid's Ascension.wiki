{{Description|Clear light coalesces into robes around Her Excellency, Sangonomiya Kokomi, reflecting her magnificent form.}}
'''Nereid's Ascension''' is [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]]'s [[Elemental Burst]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* {{Talent Note|energy frame|57}}
* Water essentially acts as if it were normal solid terrain for the duration of the burst. As such, while donning the Ceremonial Garment, Kokomi can take fall damage and even die if she jumps from a high distance onto water.
* Kokomi will still take damage while walking on [[Electrified Water]].

;<big>Passive Effects</big>
* {{Talent Note|ascension|1|Tamakushi Casket|refreshes the duration of Kokomi's [[Kurage's Oath|Bake-Kurage]] upon casting Nereid's Ascension.|character=Kokomi|talent=Nereid's Ascension}}
* {{Talent Note|ascension|2|Song of Pearls|increases the Normal and Charged Attack DMG Bonus from Nereid's Ascension by 15% of Kokomi's Healing Bonus.|character=Kokomi|talent=Nereid's Ascension}}

;<big>Constellation Effects</big>
* {{Talent Note|constellation|1|At Water's Edge}}
* {{Talent Note|constellation|2|The Clouds Like Waves Rippling|Increases the healing that nearby party members under 50% HP receive from Kokomi's Normal and Charged Attacks during Nereid's Ascension.}}
* {{Talent Note|constellation|3|The Moon, A Ship O'er the Seas}}
* {{Talent Note|constellation|4|The Moon Overlooks the Waters}}
* {{Talent Note|constellation|6|Sango Isshin}} Healing a character at maximum HP counts for this constellation.

;<big>Damage Bonus Calculations</big>
* The Normal Attack "DMG Bonus" is applied differently from other [[Damage Bonus]]es. It is not added to other Damage Bonus percentages, but is rather added to the base damage (before other multipliers are applied). That is (without [[Crit]]), the outgoing [[Damage]] is:
:<math>\begin{align}
&(\text{ATK} \times \text{Ability }\% +
\text{HP Ability Bonus }\% \times \text{Max HP}) \\
&\times (1 + \text{DMG Bonus }\%)
\end{align}</math>
* The DMG Bonus at the end includes damage bonuses like {{Color|Hydro DMG Bonus}} and Normal Attack DMG Bonuses.
* The HP Ability Bonus is the DMG Bonus provided by the burst for the corresponding type of attack (Normal, Charged, Bake-Kurage).
:<math>\begin{align}
\text{HP Ability Bonus }\% = \text{Burst Ability Bonus }\%
\end{align}</math>
* With her second Passive Talent, the Ability Bonus becomes
:<math>\begin{align}
\text{HP Ability Bonus }\% = \text{Burst Ability Bonus }\% + 15\% \times \text{Healing Bonus }\%
\end{align}</math>

==Trivia==
* In Greek mythology, the {{w|Nereids}} were the sea nymph daughters of the 'Old Man of the Sea' Nereus and the Oceanid Doris. They were the attendants of the god of the sea, Poseidon, and were seen as goddesses of the sea's rich bounty and protectors of sailors and fishermen.
* In the Japanese name of the {{Lang|Ceremonial Garment|ja=儀来羽衣|ja_rm=Girai Hagoromo}}, {{Lang|''hagoromo''|ja=羽衣|ja_tl=feather mantle}} refers to the kimono worn by celestial beings ({{w|tennin}}) that grants them the ability to fly, and thus ascend to heaven.
* {{Lang|''Girai''|ja=儀来}}, which is translated as "Ceremonial" in English, is a kanji transcription of the {{w|Ryukyuan languages|Ryukyuan}} word Nirai.<ref name="kotobank-nirai">Kotobank: [https://kotobank.jp/word/%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%82%AB%E3%83%8A%E3%82%A4-170963 {{ja|ニライカナイ}}]</ref> It is also known as {{W|Ryukyuan religion#Nirai Kanai|Nirai Kanai}} and refers to the realm of gods in the {{w|Ryukyuan religion|Ryukyuan mythology}}, the indigenous religion of {{w|Okinawa Prefecture}} and the {{w|Amami Islands}}.<ref name="kotobank-nirai" /> The realm is believed to be located somewhere in the Pacific Ocean (presumably under the sea, according to some legends).<ref name="kotobank-nirai" />
** Nirai is often equated with {{w|Ryūgū-jō|Ryuuguu-jou}}, the undersea palace of the dragon god Ryuujin in mainland Japanese legends.<ref name="kotobank-nirai" /> Nirai is also claimed to have the same etymological root as {{w|Ne-no-kuni}}, a netherworld in Japanese mythology.<ref name="kotobank-nirai" />
*** In the game's lore, [[Orobashi]] may be a nod to the dragon god, whereas [[Enkanomiya]], an underwater region where [[Watatsumi Island]]'s people originated from, may be a nod to Ne-no-kuni.
