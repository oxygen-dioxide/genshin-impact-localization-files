{{Description|Clear light coalesces into robes around Her Excellency, Sangonomiya Kokomi, reflecting her magnificent form.}}
'''Nereid's Ascension''' is [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]]'s [[Elemental Burst]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* Water essentially acts as if it were [[frozen]] for the duration of the burst. As such, while donning the Ceremonial Garment, Kokomi can take fall damage and even die if she jumps from a high distance onto water.
* Kokomi will still take damage while walking on [[Electro Water]].
* {{TalentNote|ascension|1|Tamanooya's Casket|refreshes the duration of Kokomi's [[Kurage's Oath|Bake-Kurage]] upon casting Nereid's Ascension.|character=Kokomi|talent=Nereid's Ascension}}
* {{TalentNote|ascension|2|Song of Pearls|increases the Normal and Charged Attack DMG Bonus from Nereid's Ascension by 15% of Kokomi's Healing Bonus.|character=Kokomi|talent=Nereid's Ascension}}

;<big>Constellation Effects</big>
* {{TalentNote|constellation|1|At Water's Edge}}
* {{TalentNote|constellation|2|The Clouds Like Waves Rippling|Increases the healing that nearby party members under 50% HP receive from Kokomi's Normal and Charged Attacks during Nereid's Ascension.}}

* {{TalentNote|constellation|4|The Moon Overlooks the Waters}}
* {{TalentNote|constellation|6|Sango Isshin}} Healing a character at maximum HP counts for this constellation.

;<big>Damage Bonus Calculations</big>
* The Normal Attack "DMG Bonus" is applied differently from other [[Damage Bonus]]es. It is not added to other Damage Bonus percentages, but is rather added to the base damage (before other multipliers are applied). That is (without [[crit]]), the outgoing [[Damage]] is:
:<math>\begin{align}
&(\text{ATK} \times \text{Ability }\% +
\text{HP Ability Bonus }\% \times \text{Max HP}) \\
&\times (1 + \text{DMG Bonus }\%)
\end{align}</math>
* The DMG Bonus at the end includes other damage bonuses like {{Color|Hydro DMG Bonus}}.
* The HP Ability Bonus is the DMG Bonus provided by the burst for the corresponding type of attack (Normal, Charged, Bake-Kurage).
:<math>\begin{align}
\text{HP Ability Bonus }\% = \text{Burst Ability Bonus }\%
\end{align}</math>
* With her second Passive Talent, the Ability Bonus becomes
:<math>\begin{align}
\text{HP Ability Bonus }\% = \text{Burst Ability Bonus }\% + 15\% \times \text{Healing Bonus }\%
\end{align}</math>

;Example Calculation
At talent level 6 for both the Normal Attack and burst, with the 2nd passive, 30000 HP, 1000 attack, 40% [[Healing Bonus]], only 40% {{Color|Hydro DMG Bonus}}, no [[crit]], and no reactions, the damage done to a Mitachurl by the first Normal Attack (scaling 95.73%) without the burst active is roughly:
{{Damage Calculator
|atk = 1000
|talent_scaling = 95.73
|dmg_bonus = 40
|crit_dmg = 0
}}.

When the burst is activated, at level 6 the burst Normal Attack bonus will be 6.78%, and she will gain the following additional outgoing damage
:<math>((.0678+.15*.40) * 30000) * (1 + .4)</math>
After applying the DEF and RES modifiers for a Mitachurl, the additional incoming damage is
{{Damage Calculator
|atk = 3834
|talent_scaling = 100
|dmg_bonus = 40
|crit_dmg = 0
}}.

So the total damage of the first NA hit with the burst activated is the sum
:<math>603.099+2415.42 = 3018.519</math>

==Trivia==
* In Greek mythology, the {{w|Nereids}} were the sea nymph daughters of the 'Old Man of the Sea' Nereus and the Oceanid Doris. They were the attendants of the god of the sea, Poseidon, and were seen as goddesses of the sea's rich bounty and protectors of sailors and fishermen.
* In the Japanese name of the {{Lang|Ceremonial Garment|ja=儀来羽衣|ja_rm=Girai Hagoromo}}, {{Lang|''hagoromo''|ja=羽衣|ja_tl=feather mantle}} refers to the kimono worn by celestial beings ({{w|tennin}}) that grants them the ability to fly, and thus ascend to heaven.
* {{Lang|''Girai''|ja=儀来}}, which is translated as "Ceremonial" in English, is a kanji transcription of the {{w|Ryukyuan languages|Ryukyuan}} word Nirai.<ref name="kotobank-nirai">Kotobank: [https://kotobank.jp/word/%E3%83%8B%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%82%AB%E3%83%8A%E3%82%A4-170963 ニライカナイ]</ref> It is also known as {{W|Ryukyuan religion#Nirai Kanai|Nirai Kanai}} and refers to the realm of gods in the {{w|Ryukyuan religion|Ryukyuan mythology}}, the indigenous religion of {{w|Okinawa Prefecture}} and the {{w|Amami Islands}}.<ref name="kotobank-nirai" /> The realm is believed to be located somewhere in the Pacific Ocean (presumably under the sea, according to some legends).<ref name="kotobank-nirai" />
** Nirai is often equated with {{w|Ryūgū-jō|Ryuuguu-jou}}, the undersea palace of the dragon god Ryuujin in mainland Japanese legends.<ref name="kotobank-nirai" /> Nirai is also claimed to have the same etymological root as {{w|Ne-no-kuni}}, a netherworld in Japanese mythology.<ref name="kotobank-nirai" />
*** In the game's lore, [[Orobashi]] may be a nod to the dragon god, whereas [[Enkanomiya]], an underwater region where [[Watatsumi Island]]'s people originated from, may be a nod to Ne-no-kuni.
