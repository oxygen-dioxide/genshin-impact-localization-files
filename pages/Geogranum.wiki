{{Description|In the wild, you may come across oddly-shaped crystals in which live Geograna. These curious Geo beings will follow you around. Take one near a certain lamp-shaped object and see what happens...|Loading Screen: Geograna}}
'''Geograna''' are [[Grana]] that reside within jagged, brown rocks with glowing cores, found in [[Liyue]]. These rocks are {{Color|Geo constructs}} that can be destroyed, most easily with [[Blunt Attack]]s. Once the rock is destroyed, the Geograna inside can be picked up by a player that approaches it. Once picked up, Geograna will become attached to the player for 15s, even if the player teleports. A maximum of 3 Geograna can be carried by one player.

Approaching [[Geo Lamp]]s, [[Cage-Shaped Geo Formation]]s, and certain [[Unique Rock Pillar]]s while carrying a Geogranum will activate these objects.

After a certain amount of time, Geograna rocks will respawn, even if the nearby related objects have already been activated. A puzzle consisting of multiple objects can be completed by using the same Geogranum repeatedly.
