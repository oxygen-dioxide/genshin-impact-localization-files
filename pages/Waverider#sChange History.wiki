----
[[Version 2.1]]
* Sailing the Waverider in [[Inazuma]]'s waters no longer plays any particular set of soundtracks overriding the area's ambiant ones. The following soundtracks previously could play while sailing the Waverider in Inazuma:
** [[Scarred Island]]
** [[Silent Testimony]]
** [[Soul of Soulless Conditions]]
** [[Ones Who Strive to Live]]
** [[Dirge of the Soundless]]
** [[Nothing but Ivy]]
** [[Shadow of War]]
----
[[Version 2.0]]
* Waverider's stamina is now independent of that of the character's, and Stamina Regeneration is also calculated separately for each.
----
[[Version 1.6]]
* Waveriders were released.
