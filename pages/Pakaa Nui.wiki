:'''Pakaa Nui:''' Welcome, oh lover of music!
:{{DIcon}} What's this establishment?
::'''Pakaa Nui:''' Xochicuicatl Records is the name! My cousin [[Haloa Nui|Haloa]] came up with it. Pretty romantic, if I should say so!
::'''Pakaa Nui:''' As the name suggests, we sell music records at base, and we also provide production and distribution services.
::'''Pakaa Nui:''' If anyone's written some music but can't get it from paper to record, we'll represent them, from production to publishing.
::'''Pakaa Nui:''' See that over there? That's a collection of classics by a famous writer of kids' songs. One of our bestsellers!
::{{DIcon}} I take it that's what they call "business expansion"?
::'''Pakaa Nui:''' Ah, you've got a head for this.
::'''Pakaa Nui:''' I know some real music fanatics, including a records artisan from the [[Children of Echoes]], and graffiti artists from the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]].
::'''Pakaa Nui:''' That way, we not only help release records but aid in packaging and promotion as well.
::'''Pakaa Nui:''' Good, comprehensive service, wouldn't you say?
::{{DIcon|Reward}} You have a sharp mind for business.
::'''Pakaa Nui:''' Haha, well, a store whose objective is to do its utmost to satisfy the customer's needs can't do too badly, right?
::'''Pakaa Nui:''' I haven't been in business for long, of course &mdash; just talking generally about my experience in the art of Mora-making.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Adventurer's Experience|20|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} I'll go have a look myself.
::'''Pakaa Nui:''' Feel free!
