The Grand Narukami Shrine was built before the [[Archon War]] and [[Hakushin]] served as its first attendant.<ref>{{Ref/Book|New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune}}</ref> Around 500 years ago, the shrine was led by [[Kitsune Saiguu]] and the Great [[Tengu]], the Chieftain of the Yougou Tengu.<ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Shimenawa's Reminiscence}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Emblem of Severed Fate}}</ref> The shrine priestess [[Asase Hibiki]] and the tengu [[Teruyo]] also dwelt there for a time. Asase Hibiki took over the shrine after Saiguu's death, but ultimately moved back to the [[Asase Shrine]] during [[Ako Domeki]]'s rebellion.

==Lore==
Most shrine maidens across Inazuma (excluding [[Watatsumi Island]]) are trained at the Grand Narukami Shrine, and are ultimately affiliated with the Grand Shrine above all others. Their tending to personal shrines has to do with keeping the shrines aligned with the Grand Narukami Shrine.

==Trivia==
* The shrine was first revealed in the [[Version 1.5]] Special Program.
===Etymology===
* Narukami (lit. "Roaring God") is a synonym for the thunder deity {{w|Raijin}} in Shinto and may refer to the [[Raiden Shogun]] in this case. See [[Narukami Island#Trivia]] for details.
* The shrine is most probably based on several important Shinto shrines in Japan.
** Jinguu (informally the {{w|Ise Grand Shrine}}): the holiest shrine in Shinto, whose goddess is the chief of heavenly deities. It has been worshipped by the Imperial House of Japan. The goddess and the emperors probably inspired the Raiden Shogun, whose constellation in the English version means the "Shadow Empress" in Latin. In addition, its high priestesses were known as ''saiguu'', who likely inspired the [[Kitsune Saiguu]] in this game.
** {{w|Izumo-taisha|Izumo Grand Shrine}}: the second holiest shrine in Shinto, whose god is the chief of terrestrial deities. It is also the most sacred Shinto shrine whose official name includes the term "Grand Shrine." In addition, the Japanese version of the game uses the wording {{Lang|''Ooyashiro''|ja=大社}} for "Grand ... Shrine," which is specific to this shrine (other grand shrines usually read the kanji {{ja|大社}} as ''taisha'').
** {{w|Fushimi Inari-taisha|Fushimi Inari Grand Shrine}}: a shrine dedicated to the agricultural deity Inari. Inari and their divine foxes often appear as fox goddesses in folklore, who likely inspired kitsune characters in this game, such as the Kitsune Saiguu and [[Yae Miko]]. The shrine is also famous for the row of red ''torii'' gates, which is featured in the in-game shrine.
** {{w|Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha|Sengen Grand Shrine}}: a pair of shrines located nearby and on Mount Fuji, the highest mountain in Japan. Its primary deity is the goddess of sakura trees. The geography and the Sacred Sakura of the in-game shrine may be partially inspired by this shrine.
* See also [[Inazuma/Design#Culture and Geography]] for an official interview about the design.
