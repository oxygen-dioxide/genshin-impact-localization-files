'''Cream of Mushroom Soup''' is a [[food]] item that the player can cook. The recipe is purchased from [[Sanguinetti]] in [[Hotel Debord]] for 2,500 [[Mora]].

Depending on the quality, Cream of Mushroom Soup revives and restores '''250'''/'''400'''/'''550''' HP to the target fallen character with a 120-second cooldown. Like most foods, this cannot target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]].
