{{Enemy Attacks
|enemy = Geo Mitachurl

|name_2 = Shield Counterattack
|desc_2 = Every time the Mitachurl successfully blocks a player's attack within 5m, there is a chance to trigger a counterattack:
* The probability of triggering the counterattack starts at '''0%''', increases by '''8%''' for every attack blocked, decreases by '''5%''' per 2 seconds passed while blocking, and resets to '''0%''' when the counterattack is triggered.
* When the counterattack is triggered, the shield will glow red, followed by the Mitachurl lifting the shield and swinging it at the player, [[stagger]]ing the player without dealing DMG on lift, then deals '''150% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}} on swing.

|name_3 = Shield Charge
|file_3= Geo Mitachurl Shield Charge
|desc_3 = Charges towards the player with its shield, rapidly dealing '''50% ATK''' as  {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}} to players in its path. At the end of the charge, swings its shield at the player, dealing an additional '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}}.

|name_4 = Charge
|file_4= Geo Mitachurl Charge
|desc_4 = When without its shield, charges towards the player character with brute force, rapidly dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}} to players in its path.

|name_5= Smack
|file_5= Geo Mitachurl Smack
|desc_5= If the player strays too close, swings it shield or delivers a punch with its fist, dealing '''100% ATK''' or '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}}.
|caption_5 = Unshielded
|file_5_2 = Geo Mitachurl Smack Shielded
|caption_5_2 = Shielded

|name_6 = Geo Slime Throw

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A muscular hilichurl that uses a rock as a shield.<br>Fighting and eating meat are the two most important things to hilichurls, because those are what make them grow stronger.<br>All young hilichurls dream of growing up to become a big and strong mitachurl, because that way they can eat more meat, fight more battles, and wield those (almost) impregnable giant rock shields.|[[Archive]]}}
