{{Description|A muscular hilichurl that uses a rock as a shield.<br />Fighting and eating meat are the two most important things to hilichurls, because those are what make them grow stronger.<br />All young hilichurls dream of growing up to become a big and strong mitachurl, because that way they can eat more meat, fight more battles, and wield those (almost) impregnable giant rock shields.|[[Archive]]}}

==Strategy==
The Mitachurl's shield is a {{Geo}} object, so attacks that deal high [[Interruption Resistance#Poise Damage|Poise Damage]] can break them most effectively.

==Location==
They usually appear in [[Liyue]]. They are also found in [[Inazuma]].
