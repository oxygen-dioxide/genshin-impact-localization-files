==Summary==
;Across the Sea
Arriving at [[Lingju Pass]], the Traveler and [[Paimon]] hear reports from [[Daipai]] about the sudden emergence of many Ruin Guards wandering in the wild. They learn that a single ruin is responsible for their appearance and decide to assist the Millelith in investigating the matter to keep the people safe. After dealing with one Ruin Guard, they encounter a young boy named [[Teucer]] from [[Snezhnaya]] who is conversing with an inactive Ruin Guard. The boy introduces himself and shares that he needs help finding his brother who works as a toy seller in Liyue. He offers the Traveler and Paimon a large bag of Mora to help them locate his brother, which narrows down his location to the '''[[Northland Bank]]'''.

The trio heads to the bank and unexpectedly run into [[Tartaglia|Childe]], who Teucer recognizes as his brother. The Traveler and Paimon are surprised by this revelation, while Childe privately informs them that he puts up a façade as a toy seller in front of Teucer to protect him from knowing about his true [[Fatui]] affiliations. Childe requests that the Traveler and Paimon babysit Teucer while he attends to business at [[Qingxu Pool]] and gives them additional funds to entertain his younger brother while he is away.

;Teucer's Terrific Tour
After touring around with Teucer for a while, the little boy expresses his desire to see his brother again, so the Traveler and Paimon escort him to Qingxu Pool. They find Childe negotiating with a group of Treasure Hoarders and preparing to fight them when his attempt at negotiation fails. However, upon spotting Teucer, Childe improvises and convinces the Treasure Hoarders that he wants to join them. They agree to let him join if he can help them claim a treasure that they have been having trouble with. Childe quickly obtains the treasure and declines their offer to join, but they agree to repay their debt. 

Just then, [[Felix]] arrives and informs Childe that some Fatui recruits are waiting for an orientation near [[The Chasm (Area)|The Chasm]], as he is the only Harbinger in the area after [[La Signora]] had left. Childe reluctantly heads to the area, with Teucer following him. Upon arrival, Childe speaks with the recruits, including a few [[Fatui Skirmishers|skirmishers]], and improvises once again to cover up his true identity and relationship with Teucer. He spars with the recruits, and after the session, he dismisses them, expecting good results.

Teucer is impressed with his big brother's fighting skills and expresses his desire to learn how to fight to protect his family back home. After some convincing, Teucer agrees to go back to Snezhnaya under the condition that Childe takes him to see Liyue's "[[The Wonderful World Of Mr. Cyclops|Institute for Toy Research]]". 
----
;Defender of Childhood Dreams
Childe takes the group to the toy institute, which turns out to be a Ruin Guard facility abandoned by [[Il Dottore]]. He has the Traveler assist him in clearing out the facility of enemies while trying to safely lead Teucer around. Upon leading Teucer to the deepest part of the facility, he spots a large area where he believes the Ruin Guards are made. The Harbinger tells his brother that he has a surprise and asks him to count down from 60 to buy him some time to clean up the abominable constructs, but the waves of Ruin Guards seem endless. Childe ends up using his [[Foul Legacy Transformation]] technique to destroy the Ruin Guards and the machine producing them. However, as he had not recovered sufficiently during his bout with the Traveler in the [[Enter the Golden House|Golden House]], he ends up hurting himself in the process.

When Teucer opens his eyes, he begins to look for Childe alongside the Traveler. The Traveler finds Childe hiding in a corner, where he hands them a [[Mr. Cyclops Action Figure]]. He had ordered and intended to give it to Teucer when he got back from Liyue, but decides that it would be better to give it to him now. Paimon suggests that he visit a doctor, and Childe discretely leaves the area upon the Traveler's agreement to his request. 

The Traveler returns to Teucer, who is upset that Childe had to abruptly leave. They give him the figurine, which immediately lifts his mood. With his tour over, Teucer agrees to return to Snezhnaya. Upon returning to the bank, [[Andrei]] is waiting for the three as he tells Teucer that the boat has arrived to bring him back home. Teucer reveals that he knew of the Traveler through Childe's letters but had forgotten their name when he arrived. Regardless, he thanks them for the adventure and hopes that they can visit his family in the future. 

Childe then comes out of hiding, having concealed himself since he was still recovering and did not want Teucer to leave with a bad memory. He thanks the Traveler for helping him with his cover story, offering them compensation. He also states that he would like to work with them again in the future.
