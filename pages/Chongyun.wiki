{{Lang|'''Chongyun'''|zh=重云|zh_rm=Chóngyún}} is a playable {{Cryo}} [[character]] in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''.

Born with an excess of yang (positive) energy, Chongyun has become a highly effective exorcist in [[Liyue]] &mdash; so effective to the point where he hasn't seen a spirit himself, as they immediately flee when he approaches. The excessive yang energy also makes him particularly susceptible to heat and strong emotion, which has led to some rather unexpected results.
