==Trivia==
* As of [[Version 1.5]], the male Traveler version of the "About Us: Heroes" voice-over audio is the same as the female Traveler version. Therefore, it will read "once the ''heroine'' in the song has actually rescued the ''prince''" even if you play as the male Traveler, despite the transcript reading "once the ''hero'' in the song has actually rescued the ''princess''." This issue is exclusive to the English voice-overs.
* Venti is, along with [[Traveler]], one of the only two characters to feature more than three '''Fallen''' Voice-Overs.
