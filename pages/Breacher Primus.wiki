'''Breacher Primuses''' are an [[Elite Enemy|elite]] enemy group. They are alien lifeforms created from the cells of [[Elynas (NPC)|Elynas]],<ref name="LDR">{{Ref/Quest|Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic Dog}}</ref> and are similarly aligned with the power of the [[Abyss]].

In combat, Breacher Primuses normally use [[Physical]] attacks, but will periodically enter a stressed state, where they will gain a [[Shield/Enemy|shield]] of their respective element and continuously unleash powerful elemental attacks. If the shield is broken, either using [[Elemental Reaction]]s or an [[Arkhe]] attack, they will become paralyzed for a long period of time.

==Lore==
Breacher Primuses were created from Elynas' body shortly after the [[Cataclysm]], much like the [[Melusine]]s. They essentially act as his {{w|white blood cells}}, attacking anything that might harm him or his children. According to Elynas, they are not very intelligent, and thus sometimes cannot distinguishing friend from foe.<ref name="LDR" /> There are historical records of Breacher Primuses both attacking and protecting humans.<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Overgrown Breacher Primus}}</ref>
