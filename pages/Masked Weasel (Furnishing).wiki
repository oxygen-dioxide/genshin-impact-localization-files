|description    = An agile, mischievous little prankster.<br>Its dark face gives the impression of a mask-wearing bandit, but in truth these creatures are a gentle and friendly sort, and will rarely steal from human dwellings. Even so, the good nature of Masked Weasels will sometimes be taken advantage of by people of less good intent, using these creatures to satisfy their selfish desires for ill-gotten gain.<br>Now that they are guests in the Serenitea Pot, the Masked Weasels maintain good relations with the other animals. Yes, they may make some mischief at times, such as sneaking up to pluck feathers from birds, which they then use to play with the innocent desert foxes or cats... and yes, sometimes they play-act as knights by riding on [[Forest Boar]]s... Nonetheless, they are always the first on the frontline to lend their aid and excellent senses to other animals in need. For example, they can be found coming to the rescue of Crabs who have fallen into holes, before pulling the insensate [[Quicksand Eel]] out of those very same holes.
