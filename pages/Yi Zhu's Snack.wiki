'''Yi Zhu's Snack''' is a weekly [[Reputation Request]] that occurs in [[Liyue]].

==Steps==
# Give the [[Almond Tofu]] to [[Yi Zhu]]

==Notes==
* You cannot submit a suspicious variant of Almond Tofu to Yi Zhu.

==Request Details==
===Almond Tofu===
Help Needed:<br />
[[Yi Xian]] seems to be a bit down lately. She isn't saying anything, but I can see it...<br />
She's always enjoyed eating sweet foods, so if someone doesn't mind helping us out, please get me {{Color|buzzword|a serving of Almond Tofu}}.<br />
I'm thinking that if Yi Xian eats some Almond Tofu, she'll cheer up a little.
