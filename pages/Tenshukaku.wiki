==Trivia==
* The antler-like decorations seen along the center of the building are called ''kuwagata'' ({{Lang|mini=1|ja=鍬形}}), and are typically seen on samurai helmets (''{{w|kabuto}}'', {{Lang|mini=1|ja=兜}}) as part of the crest adorning the front of the helmet (''maedate'', {{Lang|mini=1|ja=前立}}).
* Like the top of [[Favonius Cathedral]], a [[Precious Chest]] can be found above the second level balcony on a rooftop.

===Etymology===
* {{Lang|{{w|Tenshu|''Tenshukaku''}}|ja=天守閣}}, or simply {{Lang|''Tenshu''|ja=天守}}, refers to the tower keep of a Japanese castle.
** {{Lang|''Tenshu''|ja=天守}} literally means "Heavenly Protector."
