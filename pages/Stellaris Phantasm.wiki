{{Description|It was from the time that gods first traced the lights in the heavens with their eyes that the notion of "fate" was born.}}
'''Stellaris Phantasm''' is [[Mona]]'s [[Elemental Burst]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* Illusory Bubble and Omen are both applied upon casting Stellaris Phantasm.
* When Illusory Bubble is active on an enemy, there is a constellation-like marking on that enemy. When Omen is active on an enemy, there is a starry purple aura around that enemy.
* Stellaris Phantasm is able to apply {{Color|Wet}} up to twice: once when cast, and once when the Illusory Bubble bursts. However, standard [[ICD]] applies for the two applications.
* If no outside source bursts the bubble, it automatically bursts after 8 seconds.
* Omen status timer only starts after the bubble bursts. Since Omen is applied from the initial cast of the skill, if the bubble lasts for its whole duration (8s), Omen can have a maximum duration of 13s.
* Illusory Bubble bursts when the affected target is hit by an attack that deals more than 0 [[Poise Damage]]. This means that attacks that deal no damage but do deal Poise Damage (e.g. [[Hu Tao]]'s [[Guide to Afterlife|Elemental Skill]] activation) will burst the bubble, while hits that deal no Poise Damage will not burst it.
** This mechanic can be used as a means to extend the effective duration of Omen, such as when combined with the [[Frozen]] Elemental Reaction: Frozen targets are immune to Poise Damage, so any attacks against them will not burst the Illusory Bubble until they unfreeze. As a result, the start of Omen's duration countdown is delayed while characters attacking the Frozen target still benefit from the DMG Bonus.
* {{Talent Note|character=Mona|talent=Stellaris Phantasm|no snapshot|Illusory Bubble Explosion DMG}}
* The [[Damage Bonus|DMG Bonus]] is additive to other sources of DMG Bonus, such as Mona's [[4th Ascension Passive]] passive, [[Waterborne Destiny]].
* The Illusory Bubble applies a [[Struggle]] state to enemies whose [[weight]] is less than or equal to '''100''', preventing them from performing any actions. However, the Struggle state will not be applied to enemies more than 20 levels higher than Mona.
