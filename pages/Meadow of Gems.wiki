'''Meadow of Gems''' is a quest item that can be obtained temporarily during the quest in [[Return of the Jade Chamber?]], where it is a copy of the actual book made by [[Qingzhou]] and written from memory.

Another undistinguishable but permanent copy of the book can be obtained by picking it up in [[Ningguang]]'s [[Jade Chamber]].

==Text==
...

Commerce and trade, like springs and streams, begin with the mountains and end with the seas. The penchant of people is to pursue profit, and when people turn their means to profitable ends, wealth is created. To possess means is to possess power, and to curb the unjust excesses of power, we restrain it with contracts to guide all things to prosper together. The strong should not bully the weak, nor should weakness be despised and strength glorified. Let it be known to all that trade and commerce allows the river of gold to flow unimpeded along its natural course &mdash; this is the just and upright way.

Some say: "There are those who lose their jobs and have no reliable source of food, nor a roof over their heads, they toil in vain in their barren fields. All the while, the wealthy merchants' residences overflow with gold and jade. What justice and uprightness is this?"

This question is devoid of insight. Like the waves that face off against the golden sands of the shoreline, the pursuit of profit topples much of what stands in its way, and like the rapids that run in the valleys, it is unrelenting. Thus those in poverty will not stay poor forever, just as the wealthy shall not hold onto their riches for eternity &mdash; but the treasury must always be filled for the nation to remain peaceful and prosperous.

Hence, it is the proper way of things to eschew prohibition, expand the economy, and reform the government. It is easy to succumb to complacency in the matter of aid, but this must not become the trend and should be curtailed. The [[Millelith]] should be expanded to pacify unrest, both the bandits at our borders and the citizens who reside within them.

...

Though Rex Lapis enjoys immortality, mortals require provisions and preparation to be free of worry. This grand plan charts the course that will lead us, slowly but surely, to Liyue's longevity and the people's prosperity. The task of reform is one that should be undertaken with patience, we cannot make rash, demands lest we overlook other concerns. Just as one who carves by candlelight patiently waits for the jade to take shape, so will it take time for the myriad affairs of Liyue to be gradually settled.

==Trivia==
*This book was added to the Jade Chamber's interior in [[Version 1.2]], while the access to the Jade Chamber itself as well as the quest involving its destruction were released prior, in [[Version 1.1]]. Because of this, many players had already destroyed the Jade Chamber by the time this book was added to its interior, making the area inaccessible and therefore making the permanent version of this book unobtainable to them.
**Much later, [[Version 2.4]] introduced a new [[Archon Quest]] resulting in the complete restoration of the Jade Chamber, including this book, making it now available again for players that were facing this issue.
*Depending on when the player picks up the book in the Jade Chamber, the fate of the original book faces a paradox:
**If the player picked up the book after its reconstruction during [[The Crane Returns on the Wind]] and has done the [[World Quest]] [[Return of the Jade Chamber?]], it can be assumed that it is the copy that was ordered to [[Qingzhou]] as replacement, while the original was indeed lost during the first Jade Chamber's destruction.
**If the player picked up the book in the Jade Chamber prior to its destruction during [[Turning Point]], it can be assumed that the permanent copy owned by the player is the original. It is then deemed missing by the Jade Chamber staff after the destruction, seemingly unknowing of the Traveler's "borrowing", and a copy is ordered to Qingzhou, even though the player also has the original in their inventory the whole time.
***This second scenario makes it possible for players to have two copies of this book present in their inventory at a time, specifically during ''Return of the Jade Chamber?'', where both the supposed original and the new copy are transported by the player.
**If the player did not pick up the book before the first Jade Chamber was destroyed, but picked it up in the newly rebuilt Jade Chamber before doing the ''Return of the Jade Chamber?'' Quest, then this means that the copy available there is neither the lost original nor the newly ordered copy, but a third copy obtained through unknown means and unaknowledged by the Jade Chamber staff, since they ask you to retreive a copy of that book even though there is currently one present in the Jade Chamber, at least until the Traveler picks it up.
