|text      = Not long ago, I led the fleet west across the sea by way of [[Yilong Wharf]] to [[Fontaine]]'s [[Lumidouce Harbor]] to open up some new shipping routes.

After so many years at sea, we thought we'd seen it all. But this time, the locals convinced me to give diving a try, and I never imagined I'd see an entirely new world.

While I was picking [[Romaritime Flower]]s, a bunch of [[Armored Crab]]s surrounded me and started brandishing their pincers! So I just laid 'em all out flat, one crab one punch. I've gotta say, it'd been a long time since I've fought with my bare hands, and it felt great.

Oh, and I gotta tell you about these [[Lumitoile]]! They're actually kinda pretty, so I'm sending some along with this letter as a memento. If you have time, we should meet soon. I'll make some chow, and we can talk about our recent adventures together!
