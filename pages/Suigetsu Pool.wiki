===Palace in a Pool===
{{Transclude|Palace in a Pool|Unlocking the Domain}}

===Electro Current Puzzle===
Requires Palace in a Pool to be unlocked so that the water has been drained and all mechanisms within the ruins can be activated.

There are a total of three Relay Stones that can be obtained through the ruins:
#'''Relay Stone 1:''' After opening the gate that leads back up to the surface from within the ruins, a Relay Stone will appear.
#'''Relay Stone 2:''' To the side of the chamber is another room with a closed gate; climb over to the switch to the right of the gate and activate it to access a second Relay Stone.
#'''Relay Stone 3:''' ''Is found when the final gate is opened, behind which is a gateway that takes you to a room containing a relay stone, a chest, an Electroculus, and a page for Toki Alley Tales which can be found by climbing the wall straight up.''

==Lore==
Below the surface of Suigetsu Pool is a mansion that once belonged to [[Umigozen]], once a famous figure in Inazuma. At the moment, little else is known about the area.

Of interest is the large "Celtic"-style ruins covering much of the island's surface and running below the surface. On top of the Ruin Sentinels that can be fought around the island, there is an inactive [[Ruin Guard]] and even an inactive miniature [[Ruin Hunter]] located around the area.
