==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Djer:''' Hmm? Were you asking me about my thoughts?
:'''Djer:''' Well, I was saying that the [[Temple of Silence]] has always been an organization that manages knowledge and that seals things related to dangerous knowledge into the form of Revelatory Monuments.
:'''Djer:''' The "six cardinal sins," which you might've heard of, is a related concept. After all, the Temple and the [[Akademiya]] cooperated once upon a time.
:'''Djer:''' Knowledge is a mysterious thing. It can bring one riches and hope, but misfortune as well.
:'''Djer:''' Though now, I feel like the sealing work's just not in a good spot.
:'''Djer:''' The awful weather here in the deserts makes big rituals a tiring, time-consuming process by default, never mind when the weather turns really ugly.
:'''Djer:''' ...Our ancestors must have had some special method &mdash; one I sure hope they've passed down.
