==Trivia==
* Along with fireworks, Naganohara Fireworks also sells knickknacks that are beloved by both children and adults. Some are imported by the Crux Fleet, while some were created by Yoimiya herself. These products include:
** Scatterbloom Marbles: marbles that blossom when they knock against each other
** Leaping Tops: tops that chirp like birds while spinning
** Neon Dragonfly: a dragonfly that changes color as it flies
** [[Onikabuto]] Chariot: a "somewhat-failed" product, possibly used by [[Arataki Itto]]
** Katydid Coil: a ring containing flammables and spices, used to repel mosquitos<ref>{{Ref/CS|Yoimiya|4}}</ref>
* The by-products from Naganohara Fireworks can be mixed with a small amount of plant leaf extract to create scentless candles which are cheap to produce.<ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|Teahouse Candlestand: Scentless Flame}}</ref>

===Etymology===
* The name "Naganohara Fireworks" may be inspired by the large fireworks show on top of Lake Suwa {{Lang|ja=諏訪湖|ja_rm=Suwa-ko}} in {{w|Nagano Prefecture}} in Japan.
