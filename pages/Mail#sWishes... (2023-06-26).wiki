|text      = I have heard that "birthdays" are considered to be symbolic of joy, and that something special must be done for the occasion. Yet every time I thought of this date, sad memories would begin to surface in my mind. With such a heavy heart, I was painfully aware how difficult it would be to ever partake in any sort of festive atmosphere.

But this year, I have come to a decision. I shall go out for a walk. I have prepared a small table at an especially scenic spot on Mt. Yougou, and would like to invite you to enjoy the sea views and sakura together. If sitting together proves too monotonous, we can eat some dango, and go for a stroll in places that we rarely get a chance to visit otherwise.

I want to hear the wishes of the people of Inazuma with my own ears, and engrave the scenery of Inazuma into my memory with my own eyes. That shall be my wish.
