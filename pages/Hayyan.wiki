==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hayyan:''' If I head left from here...
:{{DIcon}} You are...
::'''Hayyan:''' I'm a researcher conducting observations of [[Avidya Forest]]'s ecology, and that is my bodyguard. We're not suspicious people, so please don't be too wary of us.
:;(Before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
:::'''Hayyan:''' [[The Withering]] seems to be spreading lately, but there hasn't been much of a change in Avidya Forest's ecology. I guess the [[Forest Rangers]] have been working really hard.
:;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
:::'''Hayyan:''' The Withering has been in full retreat of late, and though traces of it still remain, the forest is now in a much better state than before.
::{{DIcon}} About the rainforest...
:::'''Hayyan:''' If you know Sumeru, you'd know that this is just the easternmost area of it.
:::'''Hayyan:''' If you pass [[Caravan Ribat]] and go further west, you'll find yourself before an endless desert.
:::'''Hayyan:''' It's said that a very, very long time ago, Sumeru was a paradise covered in green, and the desert is the result of a disaster.
::{{DIcon}} About The Withering...
::;(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
:::'''Hayyan:''' The Withering... is the result of contamination.
:::'''Hayyan:''' If its source cannot be eradicated, then it will never end.
:::'''Hayyan:''' But the contamination of [[Irminsul]] is not so easily resolved, is it?
:::'''Hayyan:''' We can only trouble the Forest Rangers until a fundamental solution is found.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me more about The Withering, if you don't mind.
::;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
:::'''Hayyan:''' As far as I've observed, no new taint has emerged within the rainforest. Even the preexisting Withering Zones are no longer expanding.
:::'''Hayyan:''' This is a good sign. That means that the forest is no longer being assailed by new impurities.
:::'''Hayyan:''' I believe that we researchers will make new strides in our research into Irminsul under [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]]'s guidance.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Hayyan:''' See you, it's best to plan out your route in advance before traveling through the forest.
