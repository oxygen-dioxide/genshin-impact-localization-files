|description    = This flower vase has a fairly unique make that is far beyond your average porcelain vessel, but there is still some gap between this and a masterwork of any kind. It is not hard to guess that it was made by the hardworking artisans.<br />If one were to trace the origins of this vase, one would find that its maker was an orphan who was only able to make it into adulthood thanks to the [[Yashiro Commission]]'s aid. She was taken in by the very same artisan family who had received the Commission's help, and she had already become a fine craftswoman in her own right by the time she was a youth.
