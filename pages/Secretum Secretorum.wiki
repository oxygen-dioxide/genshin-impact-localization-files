==Trivia==
*{{Lang|Secretum Secretorum|la="the secret of secrets"}} is a 10th-century Arabic work purporting to have been written by Aristotle for his student Alexander the Great. The treatise covers a great range of topics, including astrology, ethics, and the medicinal and magical properties of plants, animals, and gems. It is considered one of the most influential books in medieval intellectualism.
* Unlike most Wish Series, this Wish Series has not run alongside [[Epitome Invocation]] Wishes that consistently feature an event-exclusive 5-star weapon tailored to Albedo's gameplay mechanics.
** Secretum Secretorum has run alongside Epitome Invocation Wishes that have featured the [[sword]]s [[Summit Shaper]], [[Freedom-Sworn]], [[Key of Khaj-Nisut]], and [[Primordial Jade Cutter]] once each.
