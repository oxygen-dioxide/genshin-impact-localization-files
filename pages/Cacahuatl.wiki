==Descriptions==
{{Description|A crop rich in flavor. The fleshy part itself features a unique bitterness and its seeds, after being fermented and baked, can be made into other delicacies.<br>In Natlan, there is a proverb that goes: "Those that sow caca shall reap cacahautl." In essence, it means that those who sow bitterness shall reap bitter fruit, and you shouldn't go asking for trouble.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* The Chinese name likely derives from the common folk etymology of "chocolate" which claims that it comes from a Nahuatl word {{Lang|mini=1|nah=''xocoatl''}}, meaning "bitter water."
* Unlike the {{w|Theobroma cacao|Cacao}} tree, Cacahuatl grows from the ground in a similar way to Pineapples where it only produces one fruit rather than as multiple fruits from a tree. Its shape also differs from its real-life counterpart as it appears to be half of a Cacao fruit cut crosswise.
