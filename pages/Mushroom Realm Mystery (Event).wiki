{{Description|A blazing volcano nurtures a people with spirits just as fiery, braving the odds to build themselves a prosperous home.<br>It's easy to get lost in the warmth and peacefulness of countryside life, and nobody noticed that the seeds of calamity had already been planted.<br>However, despite lurking in the shadows for a long time, those schemes never took root. It's all thanks to that girl — who didn't think, and just ate.<br>Deception and derision? She'll scarf them all down.}}
