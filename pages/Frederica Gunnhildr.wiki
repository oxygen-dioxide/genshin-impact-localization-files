'''Frederica Gunnhildr''' is [[Jean]] and [[Barbara]]'s mother, and a member of [[Mondstadt]]'s [[Gunnhildr Clan]].

==Story==
Frederica is a member of the [[Gunnhildr Clan]], [[Mondstadt]]'s oldest family of knights and a proud, venerable lineage.<ref name="Story1">{{Ref/CS|Jean|1}}</ref> She met and fell in love with [[Seamus Pegg]], a famous former adventurer turned the [[Church of Favonius]]' "Cardinal of Daybreak". They married and had two daughters together, [[Jean]] and [[Barbara]]. In time, a rift formed in their marriage and the two parted ways. Jean stayed with Frederica, while Barbara was raised by their father.<ref name="Story5">{{Ref/CS|Jean|5}}</ref>

Frederica raised Jean to be the successor of the Gunnhildr Clan, training her in the ways a knight must conduct themselves and the knowledge and skills they must have, such as swordsmanship, history, and ballads.<ref name="Story1" /> While Jean was a girl, her mother always celebrated her birthday with her. Instead of the usual party and birthday cake, Frederica would take her for a simple trip to [[Windrise]], which made her daughter unused to the idea of a birthday banquet as an adult.<ref name="Birthday">Jean's birthday mail: [[Birthday/Jean|How Does One Celebrate a Birthday?]]</ref>
