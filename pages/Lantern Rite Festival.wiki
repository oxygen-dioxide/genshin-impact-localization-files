'''Lantern Rite''' is a festival in [[Liyue]] celebrated on the first full moon of the year and lasts for five days.<ref name="jiangzhou">{{Ref/NPC|Jiangzhou|c=during "Lantern Rite"}}</ref> It is said to be the biggest of Liyue's festivals.

==History==
Originally, people began releasing lanterns as a way to remind soldiers of the way home, and to never lose sight of themselves.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Zhongli|More About Zhongli: III}}</ref> After the [[Archon War]] ended, it became a way to commemorate those who sacrificed their lives during the war, and eventually evolved into a full-blown festival of remembrance.

The Lantern Rite coincides with one of the largest outbursts of power from gods who fell in the Archon War, which [[Xiao]] has to battle against during the festival's duration.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Xiao|Vision}}</ref>

==Traditions==
Every year, one fallen hero from Liyue's history is selected as the subject of the Lantern Rite's Mingxiao Lantern &mdash; a massive lantern constructed from materials donated by citizens and visitors alike. The Mingxiao Lantern's size depends on the largest chunk of [[Plaustrite]] found in the previous year, and its design is usually based on one of the [[adepti]] who died protecting Liyue,<ref name="jiangzhou" /> In the Version 5.3 iteration, however, the lantern was based on the god [[Tao Dou]], who was not affiliated with the adepti.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Final Stanza: The Sanctification of Tao Dou|quote="The god Tao Dou was not our friend, but neither was he our enemy."}}</ref>

==Lantern Rite Events==
{{Event History Table|header=There are '''%PAGES%''' [[Flagship Event]]s that have corresponded with the Lantern Rite Festival, all of which allow the player to choose any 4{{Star}} [[character]] from [[Liyue]] to obtain as one of their rewards.}}

==Trivia==
* After Lantern Rite ends, certain members of the [[Millelith]] are tasked with traveling throughout Liyue and collecting the lanterns released during the festival to prevent them from becoming litter.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Where the Light Wanes}}</ref>
* The Lantern Rite Festival is likely a reference to the real-life {{w|Chinese New Year}}, which celebrates the beginning of a new year on the traditional Chinese calendar, and the {{w|Lantern Festival}}, which marks the final day of Chinese New Year celebrations.
