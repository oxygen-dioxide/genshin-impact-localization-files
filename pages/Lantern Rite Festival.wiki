'''Lantern Rite'''  is a festival in [[Liyue]] celebrated on the first full moon of the year and lasts for five days.<ref name="jiangzhou" /> It is said to be the biggest of Liyue's festivals.

==Traditions==
Every year, one fallen hero from Liyue's history is selected as the subject of the Lantern Rite's Mingxiao Lantern &mdash; a massive lantern constructed from materials donated by citizens and visitors alike.

==History==
Originally, people began releasing lanterns as a way to remind soldiers of the way home, and to never lose sight of themselves.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Zhongli|More About Zhongli: III}}</ref> After the [[Archon War]] ended, it became a way to commemorate those who sacrificed their lives during the war, and eventually evolved into a festival.

The Lantern Rite coincides with one of the largest outbursts of power from gods felled in the Archon War, which [[Xiao]] has to do battle against during the festival's duration.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Xiao|Vision}}</ref>

==Mingxiao Lantern==
The Mingxiao Lantern is a massive lantern constructed by Liyue's citizens and visitors. Its size depends on the largest chunk of Plaustrite found in the previous year, and its design is based on the form of one of the adepti who died to protect Liyue.<ref name="jiangzhou">{{Ref/NPC|Jiangzhou|c=during "Lantern Rite"}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* After the Lantern Rite ends, certain members of the [[Millelith]] are tasked with traveling throughout Liyue and collecting the lanterns released during the festival to prevent them from becoming litter.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Where the Light Wanes}}</ref>
* This event most resembles [[w:Chinese New Year|Chinese New Year]] celebrations. It even occurs around Chinese New Year in February.
