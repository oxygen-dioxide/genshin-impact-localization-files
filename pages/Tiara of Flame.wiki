==Description==
They say that,<br />Once upon a time, the people of the land could hear revelations from the heavens directly.<br />The envoys of the gods walked among benighted humanity then. The eternal ice had just begun to thaw, and the first fires were still new.

It was a time of great prosperity, when all was left in the hands of such heavenly revelations.<br />The envoys of heaven said that the world would soon enter a new and brighter age.<br />This was predestined, that future immutable.

But would a day come when such wonderful times might come to an end?

To this question the envoys gave no answer. so, the people chose from among them a chief priest,<br />And adorning his head with a crown of white branches, they sent him out into the deep places of the world,<br />To antediluvian ruins and long-buried altars of sacrifice, to seek answers and enlightenment...
