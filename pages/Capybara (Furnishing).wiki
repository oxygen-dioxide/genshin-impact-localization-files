Tourists consider them to be the paragon of animal friends.<br>When first arriving in The Realm Within, these Capybaras often appeared as if frozen in place, leading [[Tubby]] to mistakenly believe they were ill, causing a great deal of confusion. Over time, however, the Capybaras in the Serenitea Pot seem to have grown much livelier, at least taking occasional leisurely strolls...
