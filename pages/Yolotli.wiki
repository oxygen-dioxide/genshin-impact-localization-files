==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yolotli:''' Hello, hello... Did Mr. [[Toltec]] ask you to come find me?
:{{DIcon}} Nope.
::'''Yolotli:''' Huh... I see...
::'''Yolotli:''' Did I seem a bit nervous to you? Yeah, sorry about that.
::'''Yolotli:''' Thing is, a message from Mr. Toltec often means a new commission to investigate the [[Ley Line]]s. But I'm afraid I'm not ready to go out there again quite yet.
::'''Yolotli:''' There are many mystical arts that need learning, and materials that must be prepared in advance...
::'''Yolotli:''' My Ley Line perception is mediocre, so I need [[Saurian]] help for that &mdash; and [[Iktomisaur]]s aren't the type to just go out for walkies with humans.
::{{DIcon}} Do you need to prepare lots of gifts?
::'''Yolotli:''' No no, actually the opposite, really...
::'''Yolotli:''' Above all else, Iktomisaurs despise it when other creatures try to use their abilities for selfish gain. They won't be so easily bribed.
::'''Yolotli:''' Before inviting them, you must follow their etiquette and state the purpose for which you require their help.
::'''Yolotli:''' But they're sharp-eyed as all get-out, so there's no point trying to fool them.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} What if it's a gift given without expecting anything in return?
:::'''Yolotli:''' Well... that depends on how much the Iktomisaurus trusts you.
:::'''Yolotli:''' After all, there's no such thing as a free lunch. The less is asked in {{sic|returned}} for a gift, the more suspicious it is.
:::'''Yolotli:''' Want to give it a try? Well, I've heard the Iktomisaurs love these mushrooms, so good luck.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Glowing Hornshroom|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it then.
::'''Yolotli:''' Ah, splendid...
