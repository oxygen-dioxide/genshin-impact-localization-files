Sometimes, we also have to deal with enemy sentries, so in addition to being able to map out the terrain, I also have to stay combat ready, know first aid, and have strong survival skills...

If the others dislike such duties, and if I can uh, manage them to a satisfactory degree, then the least I can do is to help out... That way, everyone can have a breather and relax a little...

Since many super powerful people would also have a bad temper, I was afraid that if I misspoke, you might get upset. But luckily, you two are really nice, and I have nothing to worry about!

Or "Vera" to mean "the conditions are good, we should engage the enemy"... Hey, why don't we also come up with some code words? It'll come in handy, especially if we'll be working together long term. Go ahead, I'm good with any of your ideas!

|vo_07_01_tx             = To be honest, even I was amazed that I managed to receive a Vision. It's really come in handy, but I shouldn't completely rely on its powers. Instead, I prefer to think of it as a sort of safeguard to use in case something happens. As a member of the Knights of Favonius, I should place more importance on team cooperation, and come up with ways to overcome difficulties together with my teammates.

|vo_07_02_tx             = Here's a simple survey trick that you might find useful... Stretch out your arm, and raise your thumb towards the target area. Align your right eye's line of sight and your thumb to the left side of the target, and your left eye to the right side of the target, and multiply the distance between the two sides by the right multiplier... You can use this trick to estimate the height of a mountain and whether it's climbable, or the width of a river and whether you can swim across.

|vo_08_01_tx             = Before joining the Knights, I had to take a number of exams. Captain Kaeya was the main person in charge of all the testing. He was really supportive, and gave me all kinds of tips, but sometimes, I would struggle to understand what he was saying... I would get worried that I was not keeping up with his pace, and that I was letting him down...

|vo_08_02_tx             = Grand Master Varka is not only a strong leader who commands respect, but also my personal combat instructor. He taught me to think on my feet and avoid engaging enemies at close combat to make up for my small stature and relative lack of stamina. Following his advice, I learned how to fight with a polearm and crossbow, and I must say, this fighting style is far more suitable to me.

|vo_08_03_tx             = The Grand Master said that I need to set higher goals for myself, and strive to achieve them. I've always had that kind of attitude, but it wasn't until I was on the expedition that I realized how serious things can become... One day, I met the [[Fatui]] [[Harbinger]] known as [[The Captain]]. I can't even begin to imagine how I can deal with an opponent like him. I just... Such powerful people are really on a level of their own, I'm not even remotely close...

Whether it's organizing work, rendering first aid, or cooking delicious meals, there's so much I can learn from her...

|vo_08_05_tx             = Oh? Amber the Outrider? She's the most reliable vanguard, and has amazing reconnaissance skills! The roles of Front-Line Surveyors and the Outriders are similar given that we both operate ahead of the main force. Amber has a lot of experience, and I've learned a lot of survival skills from her, as well as how to better maintain my crossbow strings and arrows.

|vo_08_06_tx             = Captain Eula is a strong fighter with a combat style of her own, and she's always looked out for me. When I first joined the company, she assigned me a variety of tasks, way more than what other members had, and that quickly improved my ability to adapt. Once I grew accustomed to the way she expresses herself, I was able to work together with her just fine!

She even found a bunch of useful books for me to study. *sigh* If only I could be as well-learned as she is... After all, it never hurts to have more knowledge, and you never know when you might need it...

|vo_08_09_tx             = Oh? Klee? She's super cheerful, and I've heard that... she's as strong as the Grand Master himself. She's invited me to go on adventures with her before, and we always had a great time together! Although she would experiment with dangerous weapons from time to time, which means I've had to revise my maps on several occasions... But I still feel it's worth it!

|vo_08_10_tx             = I really like that bard... He's a very talented performer, and his melodies always seem to make me feel at home. If I had to pick a tune that best represents Mondstadt, it'd definitely be one of his. It's too bad that I'm not often in the city, otherwise, I could bring him some gifts every day...

|vo_08_11_tx             = The Chief Alchemist has been very kind to me. He helped me make all the survey equipment I use in the field... I even have some pens he made that will work even when I'm hanging upside down from a tree. But it seems that making artistic sketches is quite different from making maps. I've tried to make some sketches of a target area as supplemental intel before, and word has it that Captain Albedo went silent for a long time when he saw them...

Thanks to my father and [[Huffman|brother]]'s support, I was able to make it through the selection process and become a Front-Line Surveyor.

So, whenever I am around others I'm unfamiliar with, I often try to only comment on things I'm absolutely confident in, which makes everyone think I'm timid.

As long as I'm not causing trouble for anyone else, then I don't really mind what anyone might think of me. The Knights of Favonius is like my second family, and I've got to master my work as a Front-Line Surveyor.
