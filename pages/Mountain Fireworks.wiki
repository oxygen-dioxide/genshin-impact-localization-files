|description    = A potted plant with vivid, fresh orange flowers that comes in a pot shaped like a mountain range. It gained its name from being the spitting image of fire and can be found within the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]]. However, unlike its eponym, which indicates a certain transience, these flowers stay in bloom for a long time indeed. They also possess great resilience against bug infestation and drought, making them perfect for newcomers to the art of gardening.
