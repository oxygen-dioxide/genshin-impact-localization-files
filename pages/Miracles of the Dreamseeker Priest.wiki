==Gameplay Notes==
* The locations where the four interactables are located can be recognized by hanging decorations with three blue and yellow feathers that resemble {{w|dreamcatcher}}s.
* After closing the text pop-up, an event related to the Dreamseeker Priest's prayer will occur:
** For ''Ancient Chronicle of the Dreamseeker Priest (I)'', 5 [[White Pigeon]]s will appear around the book.
** For ''Ancient Chronicle of the Dreamseeker Priest (II)'', a manifestation taking the shape of a {{Enemy|Yumkasaurus Warrior: Flowing Skyfire}} will appear nearby and attack the player.
** For ''Ancient Chronicle of the Dreamseeker Priest (III)'', 12 [[Condessence Crystal]] nodes will appear around the book.
** For ''Ancient Chronicle of the Dreamseeker Priest (IV)'', 17 [[Sunsettia]]s will appear stacked on the nearby furniture.
* Reading all four interactables will grant the {{Achievement|Dream Through The Web}}.
** The pigeons ''do not'' need to be killed or scared away to grant the achievement, although due to their close proximity to the player, they will fly away immediately.
** The Condessence Crystals and Sunsettias ''do not'' need to be collected in order to grant the achievement.
** The Abyss manifestation ''must'' be killed in order to grant the achievement.
