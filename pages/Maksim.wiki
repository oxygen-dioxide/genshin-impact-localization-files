:'''Maksim:''' Ah, the Pearl Galley truly is as wonderful as they say. The men are striking, and the women exquisite...
:'''Maksim:''' A mere look has made this trip worth it!
:{{DIcon}} What's this place?
::'''Maksim:''' Oh, this is the greatest place in all of Liyue.
::'''Maksim:''' Ah, a venue like this would be an impossibility in the bitter cold of Snezhnaya.
::'''Maksim:''' Ahem... Although I originally intended to do business here in Liyue, I must say that I have forgotten all such thoughts already...
::'''Maksim:''' Even if Lady [[Ningguang]] herself were to summon me to the [[Jade Chamber]] to talk business, I may not go.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Maksim:''' Come now, don't be shy. Sit and have a drink! I know one of the musicians here, truly top-class...

==Trivia==
* One of the possible names for the [[Fatui Pyro Agent]] fought during "[[Emergency]]" is Maksim. However, it is unlikely that the agent is the same person as the NPC.
