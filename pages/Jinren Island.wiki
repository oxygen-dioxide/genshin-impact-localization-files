*Cages
**There is a cage containing a [[Shiba]] named [[Toratarou]]. The player has the option to open the cage or feed it 1 [[Fowl]]. Opening the cage will grant the {{Achievement|Who Let the Dogs Out}}. Following the dog will lead to a Precious Chest buried halfway under the sand.
**There is a cage further west containing a [[chest]].
**There is a cage hanging from a vine containing a [[Seelie]]. Opening the cage and following the seelie will spawn a chest.

**There is a cage on top of the little mountain containing a person ([[Saimon Jirou]]).
