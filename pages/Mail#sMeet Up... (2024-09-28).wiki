|text      = It seems... I never quite found the right moment to ask you in person... On what kind of days do you find yourself looking through old photos? Is it because of a sudden whim, a glance at them while searching for something else? Or perhaps, like me, you have the habit of placing precious memories carefully by your bedside...

I truly treasure that trip. Even now, when I recall the [[Fontinalia Film Festival]], I can still vividly remember all the emotional moments. Looking at the photos, images of [[Fontaine]]'s colorful streets, the cheerful laughter of friends, and the smile on your face, all these recollections came flooding back... Even the rain in Fontaine from back then seems softer than the drops falling before me now.

Could it be that memories have a way of... beautifying past experiences? I feel a bit shy asking [[Kamisato Ayato|my brother]].

Would you mind telling me what you think?
