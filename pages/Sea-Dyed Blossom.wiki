{{Description|A soft flower that has taken on the many shades of the capricious ocean. It shines with wondrous colors under the moon's silver light.}}
'''Sea-Dyed Blossom''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Ocean-Hued Clam]].

==Description==
A tender flower from the ocean. Its core is adorned with pure pearls.<br />The songs of [[Watatsumi Island]] say that these flowers bloom in the pearl-lit depths.<br />Steeped in the lovesickness of the diving sea-daughters and the gentle moonlight, they would give off a pearly gleam.

When all conflicts have ceased, the sea beasts shall no longer weep for their lonesome companions,<br />And when the moonlight rises over Touzan, the lovely deity shall rise and sing.<br />"Come, sea-daughters, come and see, O people of my heart, for the moon is out tonight."<br />"Though Touzan might fall this night, the lightning and the storm can never hide the moon's pearly glory..."

The lonesome maiden will sing and dance upon the moon-silver waves.<br />The divers shall forget the pain of loss, and even the tender flowers will regain their vibrance.
