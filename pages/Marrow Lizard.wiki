|description = A small lizard with horns on its head that can often be found in shadowy bushes.<br>This lizard has blue scales with beautiful patterns that gradually change color and seems to feed off [[Crystal Marrow]].<br>The lizard's tail has special medicinal properties when dried and ground into powder. Some mad alchemists have even found a way to process them into catalysts for explosives.<br>Once separated from the body, the tail will lose its vitality and curl up.

==Drops==
{{Card|Lizard Tail|1}}

Catching one for the first time will add this creature's entry into the player's in-game [[archive]].

==Locations==
Marrow Lizards can be found on in [[Inazuma]], specifically at [[Tatarasuna]] and [[Araumi]].

See the '''[https://act.hoyolab.com/ys/app/interactive-map/index.html?lang=en-us#/map/2?shown_types=305 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for specific locations.

==Trivia==
*Before [[Version 2.7]], this lizard used to have its name displayed as "Pith Lizard" in the catching prompt in the wild, despite its name being Marrow Lizard when caught with the Omni-Ubiquity Net and on the [https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html Teyvat Interactive Map].
*Despite feeding on crystal marrow, none of these lizards can be found on [[Yashiori Island]].
