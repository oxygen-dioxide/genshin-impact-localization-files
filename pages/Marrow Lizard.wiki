==Trivia==
*Before [[Version 2.7]], this lizard used to have its name displayed as "Pith Lizard" in the catching prompt in the wild, despite its name being Marrow Lizard when caught with the Omni-Ubiquity Net and on the [https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html Teyvat Interactive Map].
