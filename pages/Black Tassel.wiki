==Description==
One night, a Millelith officer drank with a poet, and brought his signature white-tasseled halberd with him.<br />
The poet's ink was spilled.<br />
And the halberd's white tassel was dyed black.<br />
"'Tis but a tale of polearm wielder and poet."<br />
"Unrelated to mine own black&mdash;tasseled polearm."<br />
The old smith smacked his apprentice.<br />
He demanded that he dye the newly made polearm's tassel black.
