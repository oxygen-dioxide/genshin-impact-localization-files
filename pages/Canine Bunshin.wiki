==Strategy==
* As the Canine Bunshin has an extremely high amount of HP, it is inefficient to attempt to defeat them, and the best way to complete the event objectives is to stealthily bypass them. However, it is possible to drown them by creating a frozen surface over water using {{Cryo}} abilities and allowing the Canine Bunshin to teleport onto it while performing '''Canine Art: Plummeting Blade'''.
* The Canine Bunshin's area of detection is clearly marked on the ground. Hiding behind objects like barrels and walls will limit their area of detection.
* The Canine Bunshin is easily distracted by fireworks and is impeded by smoke. Activating those will make the task easier.

==Trivia==
* The Canine Bunshin's name is not shown while using [[Elemental Sight]].
* They are implied to be illusory clones created by the ninken [[Kageroumaru]], also known as the "Black Shadow." When his true name was still unknown, he was nicknamed "Hat Dog" and "Blade Pup" by [[Ryuuji]] and [[Paimon]] respectively.
