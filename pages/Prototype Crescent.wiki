==Description==
An ancient prototype bow weapon from [[Liyue]]'s arsenal. The batch number has faded and no records exist to confirm the date of production.<br>
More than fifty-year-old cudrania wood was ordained in gold silk and paired with the finest steel components to make this fine bow.<br>
Despite being made from [[Irminsul]] branches that had stretched deep down into the earth, the bowstring is exceptionally pliable, guaranteed to never snap.

The [[Yun Family|house of Yun]] in Liyue promoted a set of legendary prototype weapons to break free of their constraints and bring a new age to the power of their forces.<br>
An exceptional longbow that is mainstream among the armed forces.<br>
The master craftsman [[Han Wu]] personally assembled this longbow at the request of his good friend [[Yun Hui]].

He employed every trade caravan he could find to bring to him a plethora of resources. In the end, he chose to use cudrania wood, fine steel and Irminsul branches brought back from the abyss.<br>
The result is a beautifully superior bow, sturdy and easy to grip, and cool to the touch.<br>
The bow's arc is as beautiful as the crescent moon, albeit a darker shade, like a light moon hanging low amidst a foggy night sky.<br>
When an arrow from the bow pierces the sky, the string's light is thin and cold, reminiscent of an unforgettable moonflow.

This resemblance has earned the bow the title of "Crescent."<br>
Should its beauty captivate the people, then Liyue will be sure to see no shortage of similarly inspired bows.
