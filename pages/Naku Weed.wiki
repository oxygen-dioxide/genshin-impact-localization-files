==Descriptions==
{{Description|Even on windless days, this plant will tremble lightly amid the cries of thunder. The part of it that resembles petals are in fact extensions of the leaves meant to protect the fragile flower.<br />The Naku Weed grows strongly in areas saturated with Electro energy. Due to its great affinity for lightning, it is often used by residents to predict storms. Stories tell that these plants are what the bake-danuki [[Ioroi]] stole from the Shogun's very own garden using its powers, before planting them throughout the islands. Even long after its punishment and disappearance, people still speak of Ioroi's many deeds.}}

*{{Lang|''Naku''|ja={{Rubi|鳴|な}}く}} is a Japanese verb meaning "to cry." In Japanese, the term {{Lang|"deer's cry grass"|ja={{Rubi|鹿|しか|鳴|な|草|ぐさ}}|ja_rm=shikanagusa}} is used as an alternative name for {{Lang|{{w|Lespedeza|bush clovers}}|ja={{Rubi|萩|はぎ}}|ja_rm=hagi}}.<ref name="kotobank">Kotobank: [https://kotobank.jp/word/萩-599923 {{ja|{{Rubi|萩|はぎ}}}}]</ref> The name came from a tradition where both bush clovers and deer's cry are regarded as signs of the arrival of autumn (similar to the in-game tradition that the Naku Weed is used as a sign of the arrival of storms).
*Naku Weed is used to reduce wound inflammation, by squeezing the liquid out and applying it to the wound.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Fate of a Fighter}}</ref>
