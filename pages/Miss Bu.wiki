{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Miss Bu:''' I sense that you are searching for someone... Am I correct?
:'''Miss Bu:''' Or perhaps you come here because of the legend?
:{{DIcon}} I am searching for someone...
::'''Miss Bu:''' Then it is as I thought! Though for Miss Bu the Fortune Teller, this was easy to discern.
::'''Miss Bu:''' People like you I can read like a book... Ahem, I mean, it is easy to tell the fortunes of those such as yourself.
::'''Miss Bu:''' For example... I know that you hold many secrets in your mind... that you sometimes feel lonely... and that there is someone who holds a very special place in your heart...
::{{DIcon}} You could say that about anybody!
::'''Miss Bu:''' Not so! These are specific truths I have clearly discerned about your individual fortune...
::'''Miss Bu:''' ...
::'''Miss Bu:''' ...I said too much in one go, didn't I?
::'''Miss Bu:''' Lesson learnt. I'll know for next time.
:{{DIcon}} What legend?
::'''Miss Bu:''' Why, the legend of the conch lodge. It's very popular among the young people of Liyue.
::'''Miss Bu:''' ...You can hear the sound of the sea in a conch shell. The same is true of the conch lodge...
::'''Miss Bu:''' Only, the sounds heard here come not from the ocean blue... but from the Sea of Souls.
::'''Miss Bu:''' If somebody hears sounds from the conch lodge, it could well mean that&mdash;
::'''Miss Bu:''' Sorry! I didn't mean to scare you...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Is that legend real?
:::'''Miss Bu:''' Why, experience would be a better teacher than I, wouldn't you say?
:::'''Miss Bu:''' Take this starconch with you. Place this to your ear when you're alone...
:::'''Miss Bu:''' Perhaps you'll really hear something. Hehe...
::;(Obtain [[Starconch]] ×3)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Miss Bu:''' Don't you want to hear what Miss Bu has for you? You're no fun.
