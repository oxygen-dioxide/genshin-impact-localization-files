<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Xingxiu is the leader of a group of Treasure Hoarders. During the [[Lantern Rite]], he and his men began stealing firework deliveries that were being sent from the city to various settlements scattered across Liyue in the hopes of accumulating a stockpile. They would then use the amassed fireworks and set them off in the city to cause a distraction before taking as much loot as possible.

He and his men soon stole a delivery from [[Qingce Village]], but a group of his men attacked what they believed to be a government convoy, which was actually part of the [[Feiyun Commerce Guild]]. [[Kangsheng]] was captured in the ensuing scuffle. [[Keqing]] and the [[Traveler]], who learned of the theft after dropping off gifts for [[Xiao]] at [[Wangshu Inn]], learned of the theft and made their way to the village. Upon finding [[Xingqiu]] and learning of the captured Treasure Hoarder, she had Xingqiu's servants take the criminal to the city for interrogation.

Xingxiu wondered why the Feiyun Commerce Guild was involved and began to recall everyone as they had taken all the fireworks they could. He began contemplating stealing firecrackers when he and his men were caught by surprise with Keqing and the Traveler's appearance. While surprised that the Yuheng was involved, he was confident in his and his men's skills but were promptly defeated and confessed the entire plot. As Keqing went off to look for the remaining thieves, the Traveler escorted him and his men to the village where they were promptly put into [[Millelith]] custody.

===Appearance===
Xingxiu shares the same appearance as a [[Treasure Hoarders: Seaman|Treasure Hoarder Seaman]].
