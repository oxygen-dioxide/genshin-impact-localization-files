==Trivia==
*Iansan's name may have been a reference to the orisha '''Ọya''' (also known as '''Ọya-Ìyáńsàn-án''', '''Yansã''', or '''Iansan'''), a deity in Yoruba mythology as well as Afro-Latin-American traditional religions such as Candomblé or Santería. She is a warrior goddess who governs fire, storms, lightning, hurricanes, death, and rebirth.
**Ọya is often associated with the color purple, which appears as an accent in Iansan's design.
**In addition to presiding over death and rebirth, Ọya also is said to rule over the realm of the dead and live at the entrances of graveyards.
