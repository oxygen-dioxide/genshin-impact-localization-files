:'''Khensa:''' I'm not sure if you're aware, but the [[Temple of Silence]] was first established by Lord [[Hermanubis]].
:'''Khensa:''' He was a priest of [[King Deshret]], our Lord Al-Ahmar.
:'''Khensa:''' At the time, the priests were mostly [[Tighnarian]]s, which is why the design of the headgear we latter-day clergy wear pays tribute to them.
:'''Khensa:''' Remembrance and commemoration... These are very important to us.
