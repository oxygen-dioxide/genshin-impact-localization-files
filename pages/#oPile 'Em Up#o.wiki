==Trivia==
*To celebrate Diluc's [[birthday]], the [[Teyvat Food Notes]] published a [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/15367 real-life recipe] for "Pile 'Em Up" and [["Once Upon a Time in Mondstadt"|"Once Upon a Time in Mondstadt."]] To distinguish the two versions, "Pile 'Em Up" uses hamburger patties instead of real steaks.
*There is a Ludi Harpastum game by the same name, in which players try to make the tallest "Pile 'Em Up" possible.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|9|note=Part 1}}</ref> Because this dish's description says it has become synonymous with Ludi Harpastum, the dish likely came first while the festival game was named after it.
