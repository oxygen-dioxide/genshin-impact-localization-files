'''Furnishing Subsystems''' ''(unofficial name)'' are furnishings used in the [[Serenitea Pot]]. Rather than being accessible through the standard furnishings placement menu, they are accessible through their own menu by customizing a particular item. Many of the items are only available through limited-time [[event]]s, with the exception of Ornamental Fish.

Subsystem components do not have [[Adeptal Energy]] or [[Load]], but the items used to place them do.

==Ornamental Fish==
{{See also|Fishing#Ornamental Fish}}
The Ornamental Fish subsystem is available after unlocking [[Fishing]]. It can be accessed by placing an Ornamental Fish Furnishing.
{{Furnishings by Category Table|Ornamental Fish Furnishings|header=Ornamental Fish Furnishings}}

It can also be accessed via the pond in the realm [[Sublime Spicewood]], which is not a furnishing.
