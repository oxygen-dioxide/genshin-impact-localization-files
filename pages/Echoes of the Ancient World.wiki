{{Quest Description|Help Verenata give the potions she has made to Carabosse. They appear to be conducting some music-related experiment...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to [[Verenata]])
:'''Verenata:''' {{Traveler}}, and... and Paimon! We meet again!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, Verenata, it's been a while!
:'''Paimon:''' What are you doing here? Don't tell Paimon that you've crafted some new potion and are looking for more guinea pigs!
:'''Verenata:''' No, no, that's not it... Actually, we've found a [[Melusine]] who's willing to help test that potion. Carabosse herself has already headed over to thoroughly document the potion's efficacy. It's just...
:'''Paimon:''' What?
:'''Verenata:''' It's just... that Carabosse was so excited to hear that someone's willing to test it that she left home without bringing the potion...
:'''Paimon:''' Carabosse? Isn't she the great potioneer that you mentioned last time?
:'''Verenata:''' That's right! Thanks to {{Traveler}}'s help in testing our potions last time, we've gathered quite some data and information, with which the Master Potioneer managed to modify the formulae.
:'''Paimon:''' But didn't you tell us that no one's really willing to help the test because those potions aren't used to cure diseases?
:'''Paimon:''' It's kinda strange that someone's willing to do tests for you... Could it be that this Melusine secretly enjoys drinking strange stuff...?
:'''Verenata:''' N&mdash;No! The Melusine in question is named [[Topyas]].
:'''Verenata:''' She claims to be a musician and volunteered when she heard that the Master Potioneer had developed some wondrous potion.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? That makes even less sense to Paimon! Why would a musician be interested in a potion?
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps it's a potion that can boost her musical talent.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't think Melusines usually take shortcuts like that though...
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps it's a potion that can help relieve fatigue.
::'''Paimon:''' That sounds about right! Musicians must feel really exhausted delving into music composition day after day!
::'''Paimon:''' Well, if there really is such a potion, Paimon thinks we need it too!
:'''Verenata:''' T&mdash;To be honest, I don't know the details either.
:'''Verenata:''' But Carabosse once said that potions and music are essentially connected, given that they both serve to manifest "truth."
:'''Verenata:''' Oh, yes! Speaking of that, do you still remember the Truesight Potion I got you to test previously?
:'''Verenata:''' We're bringing Topyas the enhanced version of that potion. The Master Potioneer seems to be really pleased with its modified formula.
:'''Paimon:''' The enhanced version? The Truesight Potion {{Traveler}} tested was already strange enough. The effects of the enhanced version might be even worse, y'know!
:'''Verenata:''' A&mdash;Anyway, can I ask you two for one more favor? I still have to gather lots and lots of herbs before the Master Potioneer returns.
:'''Verenata:''' So I can only ask you two to take this potion to her... She should be with Topyas at the moment.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh! So it sounds like we just need to bring this potion over then? That seems easy enough...
:'''Paimon:''' And this time, we'll finally meet that Master Potioneer!
:{{DIcon}} I'm quite interested in the potion, actually.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah! Maybe there's even a potion that helps you find hidden treasure! Just think of the Mora we'd make!
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps we'll be meeting someone dangerous.
::'''Paimon:''' All the more reason to go take a look! It sure does seem like Melusines can't be poisoned, but if they drink enough weird potions, they still might have some strange reactions.
:'''Verenata:''' Um, thank you so much for taking the potion to the Master Potioneer!
:;(Obtain {{Item|Enhanced "Truesight Potion"}})

;(Talk to Verenata again, optional)
:'''Verenata:''' Um, I'll leave it to you to deliver the potion.
----
;(Approach Carabosse and Topyas)
:'''Paimon:''' That's a really big conch!
:'''Paimon:''' Look, they must be Topyas and the Potioneer! Let's head over.

;(Swim up to Carabosse and Topyas)
:'''Topyas:''' Wololo... So many moons... One, two, three...
:'''Topyas:''' Wololo... The stars are dancing... Wololo...
:'''Carabosse:''' What the... I don't understand what you said at all! It seems that the "truth" shall remain elusive without the use of our latest potion, after all.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? So I guess this is the Master Potioneer we've heard so much about. She looks exceptionally ordinary to Paimon, though.
:'''Carabosse:''' Oh? And who are you? It sounds like you're looking for me, specifically.
:'''Carabosse:''' Humans attracted by my fame... I never realized my reputation as a potioneer had already spread so far among humankind...
:'''Carabosse:''' *cough* Though as you can see, I am in the middle of an important experiment. If you desire a potion of my formulation, I must ask you to wait a bit longer.
:'''Paimon:''' Okay, that's not it at all... But you're right to say that we're looking for you... Verenata asked us to bring you this...
:{{Black Screen|You give the enhanced Truesight Potion to Carabosse.}}
:'''Carabosse:''' Ooh la la, you've done me a great favor, haha! To be honest, I'd forgotten to bring this improved version of the Truesight Potion &mdash; and that left me at quite the loss!
:'''Carabosse:''' Speaking of which, I do not believe I have yet learned your names, dear benefactors.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's Paimon, and {{MC|m=he|f=she}}'s {{Traveler}}.
:'''Carabosse:''' {{Traveler}}... Could you be the one who assisted with testing potions before? I recall seeing your name in Verenata's notes.
:{{DIcon}} In the flesh.
:{{DIcon}} Could be a case of "name's the same," for all you know...
::'''Carabosse:''' Hmm. I strongly doubt anyone else in the world would share such a strange name. It must have been you, or I'm not Carabosse!
:'''Carabosse:''' Haha, well, it is thanks to your previous assistance that I was able to use her precious notes to create an improved version.
:'''Carabosse:''' And thus, it is clear that I owe you both a debt of gratitude. Should you require any potions, please, just tell me! No need to be polite!
:'''Paimon:''' In that case, a potion that can make Mora out of... Wait! That's not what we're here for!
:'''Paimon:''' That's Topyas, right? It seems like she's gone all loopy. Is she really okay?
:'''Carabosse:''' Oh, that! You needn't worry. We Melusines are quite hardy, and won't be in any danger just from drinking something odd.
:'''Paimon:''' Um, you just straight up admitted that your potions are strange, didn't you?
:'''Carabosse:''' In addition, in order to prevent any issues from popping up during the experiment, I specially concocted this "Pick-Me-Up Potion" to neutralize the effects. Using it should allow Topyas to immediately return to normal.
:{{Black Screen|Carabosse administers the "Pick-Me-Up Potion" to Topyas, who quickly becomes more lucid.}}
:'''Topyas:''' Wololo... Now, that felt like a very long time... Whoa, strangers! Haven't seen you around before!
:'''Carabosse:''' Well, now! Let me introduce them. These two are Paimon and {{Traveler}}. They are my benefactors. They were potion-testers previously.
:'''Topyas:''' Oh, I see now... Hello, I'm Topyas, a musician from [[Merusea Village]]!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, hiya there, Topyas!
:'''Carabosse:''' It was also they who helped deliver the new formulation to me this time.
:'''Carabosse:''' With this, we can begin the final experiment... The experiment that will grant us insight into the "truth."
:'''Paimon:''' Um, Paimon's been really curious for a while now, but... Why would Topyas want to try this potion that supposedly lets you see the "truth"?
:'''Paimon:''' Though {{Traveler}} tried it before, all {{MC|m=he|f=she}} saw was this really weird [[Sponsian|"ghost ship"]]...
:'''Topyas:''' Well, how should I put it... The essence of my music is an attempt to reveal the "truth" hidden all around us &mdash; things we usually don't see.
:'''Topyas:''' Like the whisper of the waves, the call of sea stars, and joyous choruses of the sands...
:'''Paimon:''' Err, what? Paimon understands this less the more you go on...
:'''Topyas:''' Anyway, it functions on the same principle as Carabosse's "Truesight Potion"!
:'''Topyas:''' I had hoped to create music that could transmit the "truth" by my own strength, but...
:'''Topyas:''' But I really don't have much time to prepare, and I want to give [[Mamere]] her gift as soon as possible...
:'''Topyas:''' If I can't create a wonderful song quickly enough, then Mamere might leave the village again before it's ready!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh! So it's a gift for Mamere!
:'''Topyas:''' Eh? You know her too?
:{{DIcon}} We're friends of hers.
::'''Paimon:''' That's right! We're totally adventuring companions!
:{{DIcon}} We are adventuring companions.
:'''Topyas:''' Wooow! Since you're Mamere's partners, you must be really reliable!
:'''Topyas:''' With your help, maybe I could get that thing...
:'''Paimon:''' What thing?
:'''Topyas:''' Well, legend says that under the waters here, within a sealed ancient cave, lies the score upon which the "Melody of Vesta" is recorded.
:'''Topyas:''' Though no Melusine has ever successfully entered the cave and retrieved the score, I've heard that when that melody is played, the listeners will be transported into a fantastical dreamland...
:'''Topyas:''' So if we could obtain it, then I could still perform a song for Mamere as a gift, even without the "Truesight Potion"!
:'''Carabosse:''' But there won't be anyone to help me test potions then...
:'''Paimon:''' Wait a minute, hold it! Didn't Topyas say that the music score was hidden in some sealed underwater cave?
:'''Paimon:''' We've opened up a lot of seals in our time, sure, but if all we have to go on is some vague legend, this could be a long shot...
:'''Topyas:''' That's true... But even so, can I ask you to at least accompany me to look at the seal? I'll definitely pay you!
:'''Topyas:''' After all, you're Mamere's adventuring companions! Once you see that seal, I'm sure you'll definitely find a way to open it!
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... Well, if you put it like that, maybe we can at least go with you and take a look.
:{{DIcon}} Well, we are getting paid.
:{{DIcon}} As long as it's just a look.
:'''Carabosse:''' How very interesting! Why, I think I'll come along.
----
;(Approach the sealed cave)
:'''Topyas:''' We've arrived! This is it! If we enter through here, we'll reach the cave where the legendary lost music is hidden!
:'''Topyas:''' I've heard that the humans who lived here hid it inside, long, long ago.
:'''Paimon:''' Um, it's just a legend, isn't it? You said that nobody's ever been inside, right? Maybe someone just saw the seal here and made up a legend about it...
:'''Topyas:''' I guess that might be possible... No, wait! This is a really ancient legend, and I heard it when I was young! There's no way it could be fake!
:'''Paimon:''' Well, this seal looks pretty ordinary! And since it's here, there's gotta be a mechanism that opens it! Let's look around.
:'''Topyas:''' Don't bother! I've looked all over this area here countless times, and there's nothing that looks even vaguely like a mechanism.
:'''Topyas:''' And if there really was, then it would have been discovered ages ago, instead of nobody being able to get inside...
:'''Paimon:''' Well, if there are no mechanisms around, even {{Traveler}} wouldn't be able to break the seal... Could someone have hidden them in some way that no one can find them?
:'''Carabosse:''' Oh, you mean some kind of invisible mechanism? Well, this seems like a job for yours truly.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh?
:'''Carabosse:''' Have you already forgotten the "Truesight Potion" you brought me? It is a potion that allows one to see what cannot be seen.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? You mean anyone who drinks it will be able to see the mechanisms?
:'''Paimon:''' Well, {{Traveler}} did see some really weird stuff after drinking it before, but it doesn't seem all that reliable...
:'''Carabosse:''' Rest assured! Though I can't guarantee that it will work if a Melusine drinks it, things will certainly work out if {{Traveler}} does!
:'''Carabosse:''' After all, this improved version is based upon the data we gained from the last time you tried it.
:'''Carabosse:''' So from a certain perspective, {{Traveler}} is the perfect test subject for this new version.
:'''Paimon:''' Baloney! You just want us to keep being your guinea pigs!
:'''Carabosse:''' Ah, come now, this formula truly is my pride and joy. If there really is some mechanism that cannot be seen, you will definitely be able to see it if you drink this!
:'''Carabosse:''' You've tried it once before, have you not? It can't hurt to have another go!
:{{DIcon}} A capital proposal.
::'''Paimon:''' Um... you should still be careful...
:{{DIcon}} If we're just trying it...
::'''Paimon:''' Um... please be careful...
:'''Carabosse:''' Then please, drink this Truesight Potion. I am looking forward to your feedback.
:{{Black Screen|You take the Truesight Potion from Carabosse, and gulp it down before the pungent aroma has a chance to spread...<br>Just like before, it seems not to taste like anything...}}
:'''Carabosse:''' Good. The potion should be taking effect by now. Try to see if you can find what we're looking for nearby.

;(Talk to Topyas again, optional)
:'''Topyas:''' After drinking this potion, can you really see anything you couldn't before?
:'''Topyas:''' If you can see any mechanisms you couldn't before, then you should be able to open up the seal...

;(Talk to Carabosse again, optional)
:'''Carabosse:''' The potion should have taken effect. Do you notice anything different?
:{{DIcon}} I see crystal devices I couldn't before.
:'''Carabosse:''' Huh, guess the new recipe works! Well, try touching them. Let's see what happens!

;(Activate all three crystal devices)
:'''Topyas:''' The seal really opened... I didn't even see how you did it...
:'''Carabosse:''' {{Traveler}} must have seen something we cannot, and done something to it.
:{{DIcon}} That's right...
:{{DIcon}} It was a pretty normal mechanism.
:'''Carabosse:''' Oho, what an excellent result! Something that only those who see the "truth" can interact with...
:'''Carabosse:''' This "truth" is not bound to the confines of our own thoughts and eyes... It is different from ordinary subjective records. It is a completely reliable and objective record.
:'''Carabosse:''' Though I cannot say if it is because of your innate talents or the potion, I believe the development of this Truesight Potion has certainly taken its first step towards success.
:'''Carabosse:''' Next, we must figure out the underlying principles behind the potion's effects, and continue to improve it...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh!? You don't even understand the basic principles behind how it works and asked us to test it anyway? That's way too irresponsible!
:'''Carabosse:''' Haha, what can I say? Potioneering is an experimental science! Practical results are more important than principles and theory!
:'''Carabosse:''' Without experimentation, even I have no way to possibly confirm its effects!
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, then Paimon has no idea what to say... But ignoring the potions for now, at least we can finally enter the cave!
:'''Topyas:''' True... The lost musical score of the "Melody of Vesta" should be inside. Let's hurry in and look!
:'''Carabosse:''' Ah, though I am also quite interested in this legendary lost music... Now that I have received new feedback concerning the Truesight Potion, I should go back and work on its next iteration.
:'''Carabosse:''' As such, I shall be taking my leave for now. My thanks, benefactors.
:'''Carabosse:''' Remember, if there are any other potions you'd like to try in the future, come and find me.
:;(Carabosse leaves)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Anyway, since the seal is open, let's go in and have a look! Maybe we'll find something unexpected!
----
;(Open the chest guarded by the [[Sternshield Crab]]){{verify|optional?}}
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, there's no treasure here.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go look somewhere else.

;(Investigate the crates)
:'''Topyas:''' Hmm... I haven't seen its contents yet, but this bronze plate should be the lost score for the "Melody of Vesta"!
:'''Paimon:''' Seriously? We found it so easily...?
:'''Paimon:''' Well, whatever the case, let's leave first. We'll open it once we get ashore.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Melody of Vesta}})

;(Approach the shore)
:'''Paimon:''' Here we are! Now let's look at the score we just found!
:'''Paimon:''' Just what kind of music has it recorded? Paimon can't wait to find out!
:{{Black Screen|After a quick cleanup, you present the lost musical score to Topyas.}}
:'''Topyas:''' Mm...
:'''Paimon:''' Mm-hmm...
:'''Topyas:''' Yeah... Nope. I can't understand what this score says at all...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? But aren't you a musician, Topyas? You should have no trouble reading musical scores!
:'''Topyas:''' Um... Though the bronze plate does have a musical score on it, I've never seen any of the symbols before.
:'''Topyas:''' I've read lots of human notation before, but this is really the first time I've seen anything like this...
:'''Topyas:''' Ohh, what am I going to do... If I can't understand this notation, then I won't be able to play a beautiful enough song for Mamere...
:'''Paimon:''' Come on, don't worry! Since it's a music score, there's definitely some way to read it!
:{{DIcon}} We just need to find someone who can understand it.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah! Since it's a lost ancient score, maybe it uses some kind of lost ancient language!
:{{DIcon}} Some music scores just can't be read.
::'''Paimon:''' If it's like that, then it probably doesn't count as a music score!
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway! It should be fine if we go and find Katheryne in the [[Court of Fontaine]]!
:'''Paimon:''' Fontaine is full of artists, and if the [[Adventurers' Guild]] helps us, we can definitely find someone who can read it.
:'''Paimon:''' Why don't you head back and wait for us, Topyas? Once we figure this thing out, we'll come find you!
:'''Topyas:''' *sniff*&nbsp;...Then I'll leave it to you!
{{Dialogue End}}
----
{{Quest Description|update|Though you obtained the lost score, you cannot understand what is written on it... Seems like you have to find a way to decipher it...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Katheryne (in Fontaine) and [[Tailleferre]])
:'''Paimon:''' Long time no see, Katheryne!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... It looks like you're busy! We'll wait over there.
:'''Katheryne:''' It's fine. This young lady has almost finished settling her business.
:'''Katheryne:''' Are you here for new commissions today?
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, no, not this time! We're actually here to post one.
:'''Katheryne:''' I never thought there would be a problem seasoned adventurers like yourselves couldn't solve. What is the commission you would like to post?
:'''Paimon:''' Actually...
:{{Black Screen|You explain the situation with the lost music score to Katheryne.}}
:'''Tailleferre:''' Huh? It sounds like you're talking about music.
:'''Katheryne:''' Oh! The young lady who was just here posting a commission is also a musician. Perhaps she may have some leads for you.
:'''Tailleferre:''' Hello. My name is Tailleferre. Could I have a look at the score you mentioned just now?
:'''Paimon:''' Of course! If you can understand it, that'd be amazing!
:'''Tailleferre:''' Let me see... Yes, this material, and this notation of phonetic notes... It is exactly as I thought! This is a score left behind by the ancient [[Remuria]]ns.
:{{DIcon}} Remurians?
::'''Tailleferre:''' You've never heard of it? Remuria is the name of the ancient civilization that controlled these waters before the foundation of the Court of Fontaine.
::'''Tailleferre:''' Phonetic notes were a writing system used by the Remurians, but rather than recording languages, they were used to record music.
:{{DIcon}} "Phonetic notes"?
::'''Tailleferre:''' You didn't know? Phonetic notes were a writing system used by the Remurians, but rather than recording languages, they were used to record music.
::'''Tailleferre:''' Remuria is the name of the ancient civilization that controlled these waters before the foundation of the Court of Fontaine.
:'''Tailleferre:''' The civilization of the Remurians was based around music. It is said that they once built a [[Domus Aurea|massive musical instrument]], even grander than our [[Opera Epiclese|opera house]], that was capable of playing music even to the dome of the sky.
:'''Tailleferre:''' The legends say they sailed musical ships that could carry thousands, and that each sigh and shudder of every note was carried to the edges of their empire.
:'''Tailleferre:''' But thousands of years ago, a great flood destroyed all of this in a single day. The civilization of Remuria also perished in that cataclysmic tide.
:'''Tailleferre:''' But though the civilization of Remuria vanished, they left behind a rich legacy for Fontaine.
:'''Tailleferre:''' Especially in the arts. Whether in music, drawing, or sculpture, we have all been deeply influenced by the Remurian civilization. It would not be exaggerating to say that they are the font of all the arts in Fontaine.
:'''Tailleferre:''' Not to mention one of the greatest musicians in Fontaine's history &mdash; [[Boethius]]. He himself served as the Harmost for the court of Remuria itself.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, since you obviously knew enough to give that whole speech, then you should have no problem reading the score, right?
:'''Tailleferre:''' Oh, sorry, I didn't realize I had gotten so far off topic...
:'''Tailleferre:''' Any musician who wishes to attain greatness must study the musical theory left behind by Remuria.
:'''Tailleferre:''' The "Melody of Vesta"... Though I've never seen the movements written here before, since it has been written using ordinary phonetic notes, it's not difficult at all to understand. But...
:'''Paimon:''' But? But what!? There isn't going to be some new problem to solve, is there?
:'''Tailleferre:''' However, this music cannot be performed using ordinary instruments. Based on the arrangement of the phonetic symbols, it must have been written for a specific instrument.
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... So if we want to play this music, we'll have to find some kind of special instrument? This is getting more and more complicated...
:'''Tailleferre:''' That's correct. I recall that according to legend, the Remurians would sometimes use a huge conch to perform music of this sort...
:'''Paimon:''' A huge conch... Paimon feels like we've seen one somewhere before...
:{{DIcon}} There was one back where we ran into Topyas...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh! That's right! Maybe that thing really is...
:'''Tailleferre:''' It looks like you two already have a lead! If you don't mind, I'll mark up the movements on the score for you. That way, anyone with even a basic sense of music theory should be able to understand it.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah! That would be great, thank you so much!
:'''Katheryne:''' Since your problem has already been successfully resolved, I believe it will be unnecessary to post your commission. As for the reward, you can simply give it directly to this young lady.
:'''Tailleferre:''' Haha, there's no need for a reward. Being able to see a score from Remuria that I've never seen before is reward enough for me.
:'''Tailleferre:''' In that case, we'll see you later!
----
;(Approach Topyas)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, Topyas, we're baaack!
:'''Topyas:''' Oh! It's you, {{Traveler}}, Paimon.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, we've figured the music out!
:'''Paimon:''' But before we talk about that, there's something we want to ask you!
:{{DIcon}} About the giant conch we saw...
:{{DIcon}} About conch-like instruments...
:'''Topyas:''' Oh! If you're asking about conch harps, then yes, that is indeed an instrument.
:'''Topyas:''' In fact, it's the first instrument I learned to play!
:'''Paimon:''' Then it looks like we were right on the Mora! See...
:{{Black Screen|You give the annotated copy of the "Melody of Vesta" to Topyas, and then you tell her about the lost score and the conch harp, which Tailleferre mentioned.}}
:'''Topyas:''' Oh! Now I understand. So this music was originally written to be played by a conch harp...
:'''Topyas:''' To tell the truth, if it weren't for the conch harp, I wouldn't even have any interest in music... My first memories of this world are all of the conch harp...
:'''Topyas:''' As for why, well, it's because my token is the component used to play conch harps, of course!
:'''Topyas:''' But perhaps it's because the sound of conch harps is a bit too unique, or maintaining them is too complicated... I would always attract a bunch of strange creatures whenever I played it.
:'''Topyas:''' At some point, I just... stopped using it to play music.
:'''Topyas:''' {{Traveler}}, will you help me clean up the conch harp?
:'''Topyas:''' All we need to do is place this token and clean up the conch's mouthpiece!
:'''Topyas:''' Then, we just need to adjust the token, and then we can start playing!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh! So we just need to put it in, then? That's a piece of cake! Let's go over together!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon's really looking forward to this! Paimon wonders just what kind of music we're gonna get...
:{{Black Screen|You and Topyas arrive near the conch harp...}}
:'''Paimon:''' If that's the case, then why don't you study the score here, Topyas? We'll go place your token in the meantime!
:'''Topyas:''' It's been so long... Would anything else have gone wrong with the harp in the meantime?
:'''Topyas:''' Anyway, I'm counting on you!
:;(Obtain {{Item|Topyas's Token}})
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|After cleaning the Conch Harp, finish performing the "Melody of Vesta"!}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Topyas again, optional)
:'''Topyas:''' Hey, it's easy to understand the score now!
:'''Topyas:''' As long as we adjust the components properly, then we can play the conch harp!

;(Place the token on the mouthpiece)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. We mounted it up, but there's no response...
:'''Paimon:''' At times like these, we just need to give it a {{color|buzzword|smack}} or something, right?

;(Use the Xenochromatic Armored Crab's ability on the conch harp)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Here comes a whole bunch of Armored Crabs!
:'''Paimon:''' Are these the strange things that Topyas said would be attracted to the performance?
:'''Paimon:''' No wonder Conch Harp performances became impossible... C'mon, let's help them clean this up!

;(Defeat the first wave)
:'''Paimon:''' There are so many Armored Crabs here. Is this their home?
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, every Armored Crab carries a huge conch while also living within the Conch Harp &mdash; that kinda reminds Paimon of nesting dolls!

;(Defeat the second wave)
:'''Paimon:''' This one must be their leader. It's so big! But how did it even manage to get inside?

;(After defeating the crabs)
:{{Black Screen|After Topyas makes some last-minute adjustments to the components on the conch, she begins the conch harp performance...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, what wonderful music... Even though it took so long, Paimon knew it wasn't all for nothing the instant she heard it!
:'''Paimon:''' It washed away all our fatigue, just like that!
:'''Topyas:''' Yes! Even though it can't carry people off into a dreamscape like the legend says, it is truly beautiful music.
:'''Topyas:''' It's definitely good enough to be a parting gift for Mamere!
:'''Topyas:''' Thank you both so much! You both spent so much time running around and worked so hard for the sake of my music...
:{{DIcon}} After all, we're Mamere's companions.
:{{DIcon}} No worries. We're used to it.
:'''Topyas:''' Anyway, I'm so grateful! Thank you!
:'''Topyas:''' Oh, right! And this is the reward I promised you.
:'''Topyas:''' If you have time, please come back and listen to more beautiful music!
