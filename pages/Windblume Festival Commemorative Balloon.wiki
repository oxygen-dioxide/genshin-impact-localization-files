The '''Windblume Festival Commemorative Balloon''' is a [[Gadget]] that can be obtained through the [[Invitation of Windblume]] event shop after reaching the Balloon Hunter rank in all [[Bullseye Balloons]] Festive Challenges. This Commemorative Balloon costs 280 [[Festive Tour Ticket]]s.

It can also be bought from [[Marjorie]] in [[Mondstadt]] for {{Item|Mora|20|x=150,000}} if players missed the event.

The type of balloon released is chosen at random between [[Bloom Balloon]] and [[Bouquet Balloon]], which are also seen in the Festive Challenge. The balloons can be shot at or otherwise damaged, causing them to pop. The balloons will also automatically pop after 20 seconds.  Multiple balloons can exist in the world at once, but the gadget enters a 5-second cooldown every time it is used.

This gadget cannot be used indoors or in [[domains]].

==Trivia==
*Balloons can be [[displacement|displaced]] by [[Vacuum Field]]s.
