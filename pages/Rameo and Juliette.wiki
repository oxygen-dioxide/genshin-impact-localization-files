{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Juliette by the fountain)
:'''Juliett:''' Ah, that blockhead. Were we not to meet at this hour? Why tarries he so distantly?

;(Talk to Rameo)
:'''Rameo:''' Ah, but will she love this flower? What if she loves it not? Should I resign this campaign, and sally again when fully girded?

;(Push Rameo)
:{{DIcon|Hand}} Push
:'''Rameo:''' O&mdash;One moment! I'm not ready yet!
:'''Rameo:''' Ah yes, this&mdash; um... that which we call a rose...
:'''Rameo:''' When I see this rose, I deem that it suiteth thee, though I know not if thou shall love it...

----

;(Talk to Juliette who is now with a group of ravens)
:'''Juliette:''' Alas! *sobs* O misfortunate stroll! I should ne'er have suggested thee.
:{{DIcon}} What happened?
:'''Juliette:''' A bosom friend and I did'st walk about these parts, but by hilichurls were set upon...
:'''Juliette:''' They have taken him. My friend was taken in my defense!
:{{DIcon}} Where have the hilichurls gone?
:'''Juliette:''' I did not see them clearly, but I am sure they are on this island still. *sobs* Oh, what is to be done?

----

;(Approach the small cave in the elevator shaft)
:'''Rameo:''' Ah me, alas! Would that some generous passers-by might succor a fellow...

;(Talk to Rameo)
:'''Rameo:''' I thank thee, kind stranger. Most horrid these hilichurls are, assaulting my... friend and myself as we were traveling the road. Still, it is good that she is well.
:'''Rameo:''' It is well that she is safe... No, she must be much afear'd for mine safety, or I am a fool! I must go to her, post-haste! Again, you have my thanks.
