After many days of investigations, I finally captured a perpetrator behind a smuggling case and gave him an unforgettable interrogation as a gift.

Working off of the clues he revealed would make things much easier. If you ask me, it's unfortunate that they let this drag on for so long.

Anyway, now that the case is closed, I can finally have a good rest.

I'm done with thinking for today, and I hope people can spare me the pleasantries. Finding a quiet place to have some tea sounds like a better idea... You're welcome to keep me company.

Of course, I won't be telling you the details of that case. But as for anything else, we can talk about them in detail once we meet.
