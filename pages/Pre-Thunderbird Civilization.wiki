The '''Pre-Thunderbird civilization''' was the civilization on [[Tsurumi Island]] before the civilization that worshipped the [[Thunderbird]]. Remnants of its existence are explored in the [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] of [[Tsurumi's Mountain Murals]].

==History==
It appears that, much like [[Sal Vindagnyr]], the people of the Pre-Thunderbird civilization worshipped Celestia. Based on [[Kapatcir]]'s memories of the descent of a "nail" causing fog for the Island, it is possible a nail was responsible for the end of this civilization. It is also possible the people of the Pre-Thunderbird Civilization migrated aboveground to become the [[Thunderbird Civilization]], as many of their drawings are sealed behind statues of Kanna Kapatcir, implying the seals were made by those of her followers.
