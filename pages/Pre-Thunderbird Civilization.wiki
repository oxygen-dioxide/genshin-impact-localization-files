The '''Pre-Thunderbird civilization''' was the civilization on [[Tsurumi Island]] before the civilization that worshipped the [[Thunderbird]]. Remnants of its existence are explored in the [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] of [[Tsurumi's Mountain Murals]].

==History==
It appears that, much like [[Sal Vindagnyr]], the people of the Pre-Thunderbird civilization worshipped Celestia. Based on [[Kapatcir]]'s memories of the descent of a "nail" causing fog for the Island<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna|quote = Once, strange objects fell from the heavens, one of which landed upon this island, after which your sky returned to its clear state. Afterward, the fog started to emerge. Though you had the power to disperse that fog, it meant little to you either way.}}</ref>, it is possible a [[divine nail]] was responsible for the end of this civilization. It is also possible the people of the Pre-Thunderbird Civilization migrated aboveground to become the [[Thunderbird Civilization]], as many of their drawings are sealed behind statues of Kanna Kapatcir, implying the seals were made by those of her followers.
