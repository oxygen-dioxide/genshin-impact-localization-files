|description  = Round and short pelvic fins, a plump body, and a plain face make up most people's first impression of the pufferfish. This is by and large an accurate assessment of its character as well: dull, slow, and lazy. However, few people know that this rather silly exterior hides a killer technique &mdash; this fish is capable of sucking water into its body before expelling it like a cannonball from its mouth with such force and pinpoint accuracy that even fishermen might be stunned by it. Truly, it is a first-rate killer in the water.<br>"Pufferfish ahead? Watch for spittle!" &mdash; Angler's Atlas, Pufferfish Chapter
