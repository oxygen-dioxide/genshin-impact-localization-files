{{Description|Even the flowing flames must obey her rage and at her command become her fangs and claws.}}
'''Leonine Bite''' is [[Dehya]]'s [[Elemental Burst]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* Dehya can perform up to '''10''' or '''6''' Flame-Mane's Fists with and without Roaring Barrage respectively.
* Pressing the Normal Attack button while in the Blazing Lioness state will ''not'' trigger Normal Attack-related effects, such as [[Xingqiu]]'s [[Guhua Sword: Raincutter|Elemental Burst]].
* Jumping during the Blazing Lioness state will end it prematurely.
* Dashing and jumping in quick succession during the Blazing Lioness state will cause Dehya to skip all Flame-Mane's Fists and immediately perform Incineration Drive.
* While the Blazing Lioness state is active, Dehya cannot transition into [[diving]]<!-- she can't pass through the vertical boundaries that exist for some bodies of water --> and will generally not transition into [[swimming]].
** Without additional movement input, Dehya stalls her forward movement at swimming height for water. However, she does not do so for [[Liquid Phlogiston]] and can therefore move herself below its surface.
** Dehya can perform Flame-Mane's Fists and Incineration Drive while standing on [[water]] that was previously frozen, though she will remain stationary.
** Entering liquid at swimming height due to falling without dashing will end the Blazing Lioness state prematurely.
** Entering liquid at swimming height due to falling any distance after dashing will cause Dehya to skip all Flame-Mane's Fists and immediately perform Incineration Drive, which may or may not be successfully completed.
