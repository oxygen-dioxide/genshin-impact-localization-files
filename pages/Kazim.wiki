==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kazim:''' We must check on the White Lift every morning and every night.
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Kazim knows)
:::'''Kazim:''' When I was preparing materials to repair the White Lift with, I did come across some sites that contain ore. I even discovered some Magical Crystal Ore there, if you'll believe it!
:::'''Kazim:''' We don't lack for any of that in the village at the moment, so they're yours if you want them.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Kazim knows)
:::'''Kazim:''' All is well... lately, anyway. The White Lift is functioning well enough, but we shouldn't get careless just the same.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Kazim:''' I watch over the White Lift. I'm also in charge of its maintenance and repair.
::'''Kazim:''' This machine is very important to the village's water supply. Before it was built, we had to get our water one bucket at a time.
::'''Kazim:''' Its critical importance is precisely why I am planning to secure its future while I still can.
::'''Kazim:''' Fortunately, my son [[Kazan]], unlike many other young people, has not left the village to become a mercenary or a traveling merchant. As such, I'm planning to pass everything I know onto him.
::'''Kazim:''' That way, he can take over in case I become unable to work.
::{{DIcon}} So, what's the White Lift, exactly?
::'''Kazim:''' This elevator was built with the help of a Village Keeper a long time ago.
::'''Kazim:''' You know of Village Keepers, yes? Those are the mad researchers exiled here by the Akademiya.
::'''Kazim:''' They're a little batty most of the time, but sometimes, they'll pull themselves together and help us out.
::'''Kazim:''' Anyway, back to the White Lift. The Village Keeper who helped build it is said to have been a Kshahrewar researcher. In fact, some people wanted to name the machine the Kshahrewar Lift at first.
::'''Kazim:''' But I'm sure you know how things have always been a bit testy between Aaru Village and the Akademiya. I doubt that name would have gone down well with everyone.
::'''Kazim:''' So in the end, we just named it after the color that represents Kshahrewar &mdash; and that's how it became known as the White Lift.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I see.
:::'''Kazim:''' The longer I work at this job, the more I come to think that everything should be planned out in advance, with contingencies to match.
:::'''Kazim:''' I'm very grateful to the Village Keepers for their aid, but we can't always rely on them.
:::'''Kazim:''' Preventing problems before they can occur is the safest way to go about things.
:::'''Kazim:''' That applies to you, too, I believe. There are always times when we need to do some repairs outdoors, so take this &mdash; better safe than sorry.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Crystal Chunk|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Kazim:''' Goodbye.  Always be prepared for a rainy day!
