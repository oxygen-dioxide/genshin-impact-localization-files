==Summary==
;For the Same Land

In the aftermath of [[The Rainbow Destined to Burn|Abyssal invasion]], the tribes of Natlan are busy handling the short-term effects. Paimon suggests to the Traveler that they visit the Flower-Feather Clan, since they had been hit the hardest. When they arrive, they find that Iansan and a group of people from the Collective of Plenty were already at work. While her tribe was spared from the brunt of the invasion, she decided to help out at the Flower-Feather Clan since they were hurt a lot more. She asks them to follow her, leading them to the chief, [[Mutota]], who tells them that after the battle, they found several of their people in the wilderness, but they were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder; [[Atoco]], [[Cochitta]] and [[Ocotlan]]. He suspects that [[Gosoythoth]] was too powerful for them, explaining to Paimon that it was the Abyssal rift that appeared during the invasion, which was also known as the "Reaper of the Abyss."

Mutota had learned that there was a treatment hundreds of years ago, but its knowledge was lost in the present day. The Traveler offers to help and tries to purify the energy within them, but nothing happens. Iansan suggests moving them to a more comfortable environment in order to get them to loosen up while being under watchful eyes. The chief agrees with her suggestion and has the three moved away. They first visit Atoco, where he remarks on being cold. Iansan suggests building a bonfire for warmth, and through it they learn the name [[Duarte]]. They ask [[Izcalli]] about Duarte, who reveals that Duarte was Atoco's saurian companion who died four years ago during an abyssal attack. This prompts them to take on the appearance of a [[Qucusaurus]] and they return to Atoco as one. The plan appears to work before Atoco becomes suspicious, prompting the Traveler to slam him, putting him back to his senses. Upon learning the situation from them, Atoco apologizes for their efforts, while Iansan tells him that he needs to move on and accept Duarte's death.

The three then head to Cochitta and are unsure as to how to help her when Mutota arrives, having learned that Atoco's stress was handled. Upon learning of their plan, he tells her about her past &mdash; Cochitta also had a younger brother, and their parents died fighting the Abyss. While she resolved to become a warrior, she was still riddled with fear and doubt until the Abyss attacked one day, and she protected her brother from a monster. After that incident, she became a renowned fighter and the tribe was glad of her prowess, only for it to unravel during the invasion. Suddenly, Cochitta's brother, [[Cuallee]], arrives with a toy weapon, demanding to know the location of the monster that hurt her. The Traveler convinces her to continue fighting, and she resolves to do so. Mutota tells them that a few monsters fled north after the battle, and while he sent a group to eliminate them, there could be a few stragglers lying about.

They discover a group of three riftwolves, and Cochitta kills them with the Traveler and Iansan's help. Doing so gives her the confidence she once had, and upon learning what had happened, apologizes to the two for the efforts they went to help her. While she and Cuallee share a moment, Iansan tells them that they can return to the tribe whenever they felt like it, having ensured that there would be no other monsters on the way back. Returning to the tribe, [[Ohtli]] and [[Itotia]] talk about the Traveler's assistance. They later meet up with Iansan, before they are informed that Ocotlan is going out of control.

Ocotlan, believing the tribe is overrun (mistaking the people as Abyss monsters), attacks the group. He then tries to attack his father [[Munay]], but Iansan and the Traveler subdue him. They are unsure as to how to cure him, as he doesn't even acknowledge them as people, only for Capitano to appear and tell them that he's suffering from Abyssal Corrosion Syndrome, which he deemed had "resurfaced" again. He states that while some people could be cured through verbal or physical interaction (as the case with Atoco and Cochitta), Ocotlan is entrenched deep in his hallucinations that medical intervention is the only cure, with the Draught of Lucidity being needed. He explains that it was only used for the most severe cases, as the patient would suffer from chronic migraines for the rest of their life. Munay allows the treatment, so Iansan gives him it. Ocotlan returns to his normal self, explaining that he had a vision where the tribe was overrun with monsters. Munay tells him to relax and asks Capitano for his name, grateful for his help.

As Iansan takes Ocotlan away, Capitano gives her additional medicine for any other warriors who might need it. He then reveals that after he had fled from Khaenri'ah with his platoon to Natlan, he saw their struggle against the Abyss. Despite seeing the people as inexperienced, he found their resolve commendable and saw that they shared a common enemy. Paimon asks if he was also skilled in medicine, but Capitano states that Guthred was the one who had developed it, who was a respected military doctor and his second-in-command during the cataclysm. During their fight against the Abyss, several of his men tried to kill each other, prompting Guthred to fast-track the medicine's development by using himself as a test subject; he died shortly after it was completed. Capitano remarks that their goals are not aligned, revealing that the souls of the land are not at peace, and thus his work is not done either.

Capitano allows the Traveler to ask him a question, and the Traveler remarks about Mavuika's use of Ronova's power which would mean she was slated for death. The Traveler asks about Ronova, and Capitano tells them that she was responsible for both his and his peoples' suffering. He takes off his mask and reveals his true face to them, shocking both. He states that the Ruler of Death is able to freely interpret the form of death or grant immortality to any she desires, stating that before the final moment truly came, they had to fight harder than ever. Iansan then returns, informing the Traveler that a messenger from the Scions of the Canopy were looking for them, as Xilonen was able to begin progress on creating the Traveler's Ancient Name.

Returning to the Stadium of Sacred Flame, they find that Mualani, Kinich, Ajaw, Kachina, Citlali and Ororon were waiting for them. Ajaw scolds them for taking their time, only for Kinich to fling him away and tell them that they had only arrived. To the group's surprise, Chasca soon arrives, having heard of the Traveler's assistance to her tribe and thanks them for their help. Xilonen impressed with the turnout, as there were more people than she needed. She explains to them that they would need to talk about the Traveler's feats in front of the Pilgrim's Chronicle, while the Traveler would need to leave for the duration. Paimon follows them, but to her surprise, Xilonen comes for her too, as she was still their companion despite not hailing from Natlan. Some time passes before she calls the Traveler over, stating that Paimon had plenty of information to share. She returns the chronicle to them, stating that she would need it when the time came to forge the Ancient Name, and once she had done so, the war could finally end.
