==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Cadmael:''' Somewhere else... Will there be opportunities for me to take?
:{{DIcon}} Is something the matter?
::'''Cadmael:''' Well, I failed my flight test. It went horribly. I couldn't fly well at all &mdash; in fact, I didn't even make it up to the clouds.
::'''Cadmael:''' That makes it the second time now... To be honest, this is all pretty discouraging.
::'''Cadmael:''' I know "second time" isn't a lot for many riders &mdash; but it's not a good sign all the same.
::'''Cadmael:''' When I think about my tribespeople who've wasted the best half of their lives without success, throwing themselves into flying for years on end... I'm kinda scared that I'll become like them.
::'''Cadmael:''' Perhaps... I have to just accept the fact that I'm "Wingless" and get out of here...
::{{DIcon}} But you haven't left yet, have you?
::'''Cadmael:''' Yeah. I mean, I haven't completely lost all faith just yet.
::'''Cadmael:''' I wouldn't be pacing here like this otherwise, would I?
::'''Cadmael:''' Am I really cut out to be a rider? Do I really have the talent? Is one mistake going to ruin everything for me?
::'''Cadmael:''' I know this idea may seem childish and like a waste of time to our elders, but people have to take responsibility for their own lives.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} True.
:::'''Cadmael:''' Haha, thanks for listening to my rambling. Hope I didn't waste your time.
:::'''Cadmael:''' I may be leaving soon, but the Flower-Feather Clan is a great place to be. I hope you enjoy your time here.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Teachings of Contention|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Cadmael:''' I just hope I'll make the right decision... And I hope you do, too.
