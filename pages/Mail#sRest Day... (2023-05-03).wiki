According to her, trying something new for a change would make one happy. She also brought along members of the Blazing Beasts and offered to patrol around the village for me.

I appreciated her kindness but really didn't want to bother her. She then resorted to mentioning that I was bested in our last pillow fight in a bid to persuade me... Well, Dehya's not one to easily give up, is she?

This special day could be a good opportunity to show off my culinary skills. How about I make something delicious for everyone in the village?

I'd be more than happy if you could join us.

But I understand how treacherous the trip into the desert could be, so don't push yourself if you're currently somewhere far away. We can always meet on another day.

I'm always here in the village.
