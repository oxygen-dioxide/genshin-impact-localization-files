|text    = Greetings, [[Traveler]]. It's been a while. I hope this letter finds you well.

Life on [[Watatsumi Island]] is as usual, but there are many little things that I'd like to share with you.

Take, for example, what I have seen of late while walking the shallows. I saw a couple [[Adorned Unagi]] emerging from the sand. They swayed in the sea breeze while facing the setting sun, looking so carefree and relaxed.

Though those creatures are young, I sense they might have a deeper insight into the nature of the waves than even we do.

I took what I witnessed from them as a sign of something auspicious.

That day, I couldn't bear to disturb them, so I took a quiet detour. Yet, that genuine sense of relaxation has remained to the present.

The sea never fails to surprise. Sometimes it brings resources. Sometimes it gifts a moment of peace. If you are also willing to interact with the trove of treasures the waters offer, then perhaps you should take the dive, and seize the present as well.
