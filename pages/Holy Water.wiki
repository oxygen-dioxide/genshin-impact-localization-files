'''Holy Water''' is a [[food]] item that the player can purchase from [[Hopkins the Marvelous]] (located in [[Springvale]], [[Mondstadt]]) for 300 [[Mora]] (max 1 per day). you can buy it from Hopkins around 06:00 – 19:00.

Holy Water has a hidden effect; it regenerates 1 HP every second for 20 seconds. Like most foods, this cannot target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]].

==Trivia==
*The Holy Water is not actually holy; it is just normal pond water. If you visit Springvale between 19:00 and 05:59, you will see Hopkins obtaining the water from the spring in the front of town.
*While the water is not holy, the spring's water is magical because of the [[Spring Fairy]] who presides over the spring.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Diona|5}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Life Flows On (I)}}</ref>
