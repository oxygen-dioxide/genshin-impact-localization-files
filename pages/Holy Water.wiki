'''Holy Water''' is a [[food]] item that the player can purchase from [[Hopkins the Marvelous]] (located in [[Springvale]], [[Mondstadt]]) for 300 [[Mora]] (max 1 per day). It can be bought from Hopkins between 06:00 &mdash; 19:00.

Holy Water has a hidden effect which regenerates 1 HP every second for 20 seconds. Like most foods, this cannot target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]]. Unlike most foods, it does not affect [[Fullness]].

==Description==
{{Description|A bottle of clear, colorless, and contaminant-free liquid. Indistinguishable from ordinary spring water. May or may not be worth putting all of one's hopes into.<br><!--

-->A local legend claims that a supernatural presence exists in the spring at the far side of [[Springvale]] which borders the mountains. If this is the case, maybe there really is something special in this bottle of water?|Archive}}

==Trivia==
* If the player visits Springvale between 19:00 and 05:59, they can see [[Hopkins the Marvelous]] obtaining his Holy Water from the spring in front of the town.
** While the water is not holy, the spring's water is magical because of the [[Spring Fairy]] who resides in the spring.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Diona|5}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Life Flows On (I)}}</ref>
