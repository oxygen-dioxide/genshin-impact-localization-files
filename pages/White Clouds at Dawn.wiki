{{Description|Do not shake Cloud Retainer's hand too tightly; cranes are quite adept at gripping.}}
'''White Clouds at Dawn''' is [[Xianyun]]'s [[Elemental Skill]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* {{Talent Note|particles|Driftcloud Wave|5}}
* Skyladders cover larger horizontal distances when used while on the ground instead of mid-air.
* The Cloud Transmogrification state has a '''3''' seconds duration after performing White Clouds at Dawn. This duration will be reset when Xianyun performs Skyladder.
** Opening the [[Wind Glider]] or interacting with certain exploration objects (e.g. [[Thunder Sphere]]s, [[Four-Leaf Sigil]]s) will not end the Cloud Transmogrification state.
** The Cloud Transmogrification state will be cancelled and renewed if Xianyun performs another White Clouds at Dawn. This will trigger the decreasing CD effect since Driftcloud Wave is not used in the previous Cloud Transmogrification state.
* Driftcloud Wave can be used even if Xianyun has already landed. As a result, it is impossible for Xianyun to perform a Normal or Charged Attack while in the Cloud Transmogrification state.
* While the exact targeting logic is unknown, Driftcloud Wave will attempt to target grouped up enemies rather than scattered ones.
* Lv. 2 and Lv. 3 Driftcloud Wave will knock enemies towards the center of the AoE. Lv. 1 Driftcloud Wave will still scatter enemies.
* When Driftcloud Wave is used, Xianyun will lock onto an target's current location and fly towards it in a straight line. If there are no targets in range, she will plunge down at a diagonal angle.
** The dive lasts '''2''' seconds. If Xianyun is still airborne after 2 seconds, she will exit the dive and fall.

==Trivia==
* {{Talent Note|clap}}
** Driftcloud Wave causes them to flinch if Xianyun is close enough during the entire attack.
* Some devices may experience the following: After using Skyladder, if the Cloud Transmogrification state is still active and Xianyun lands on [[water]] or [[Liquid Phlogiston]], there is an extremely brief period of time in which Xianyun does not yet transition to [[swimming]] and can use Driftcloud Wave or another Skyladder if available. In such cases, water is treated as if it were land, allowing a subsequent Skyladder to cover a greater horizontal distance. Xianyun's contact with water or Liquid Phlogiston will still apply {{Hydro}} or {{Pyro}} to her as well as [[HP loss]] where applicable.
