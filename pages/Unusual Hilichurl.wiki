'''Unusual Hilichurl''' &mdash; ''Menace of the Mansion'' is a unique [[Common Enemy]].

For specific locations, see the [https://act.hoyolab.com/ys/app/interactive-map/index.html#/map/ HoYoLAB Teyvat Interactive Map].

==Spawning Pattern==
Up to two Unusual Hilichurls spawn every 12 hours, in 14 different possible locations, 6 in [[Mondstadt]] and 8 in [[Liyue]], outside of special areas such as [[Dragonspine]], [[The Chasm (Subregion)|The Chasm]], and [[Chenyu Vale]]. Unlike most enemies, the Unusual Hilichurl is passive and will not react to players unless attacked.

There can only be one Unusual Hilichurl in the player's world at any given time. When an Unusual Hilichurl is defeated, it will go into its work briefcase and teleport to one of the 13 possible locations. After defeating it a second time, there is a 12-hour cooldown before the Unusual Hilichurl can be fought again.

If the player finds one but leaves it alone, it will remain there for 12 hours before reappearing in another location. If the first spawn is defeated but not the second one, 12 hours after the first kill the spawn locations and count will reset. If the Unusual Hilichurl is not found, it will respawn in a different location after some time (exact time is currently unknown; probably 12 hours).

If the player battles the Unusual Hilichurl but exits combat (such as teleporting), it will act as if it was defeated, thus making it appear in another area (if the first spawn), or enter the 12 hour cooldown period before appearing again (if second spawn).

==Drops==
===Items===
Unlike most Common Enemies, Unusual Hilichurls are capped at ten drops per day. In order to reach this cap, players must use [[Co-Op]] mode.

}}

==Strategy==
===Locating===
*Bringing a character that can create a [[Geo Construct]] may be useful, in order to activate the [[Pressure Plate]] to create a wind current at the Stone Gate location.
*It is quicker to find whether the Unusual Hilichurl is present at some locations than others. Visiting these locations first can save time; however, it may be dependent on render distance. These locations include: Windrise, Stormterror's Lair, Qingyun Peak, Lingju Pass, and Mingyun Village.

===Combat===
*The Unusual Hilichurl can be [[knockback|knocked back]] and pulled by [[Vacuum Field]]s while not using an attack. While using an attack, it cannot be interrupted.
*The Unusual Hilichurl cannot be rendered immobile by [[Frozen]], [[Mona]]'s [[Stellaris Phantasm]], or Petrification from [[Zhongli]]'s [[Planet Befall]].
*The Unusual Hilichurl is unaffected by [[Aggravation#Taunting Talents|taunts]].
*The Unusual Hilichurl can be defeated by drowning.
*The Unusual Hilichurl can be defeated by fall damage.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|"Homu, homu, mimi domu!"|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* On the Unusual Hilichurl's mask is the character "{{zh|伟}}." It is a reference to [[miHoYo]] co-founder [[w:c:mihoyo:Liu Wei|Wei Liu]] ({{Lang|zh=刘伟|mini=1}}), who has made cameos in miHoYo's previous games ''Houkai Gakuen 2'' and ''Honkai Impact 3rd''.
** His title "Menace of the Mansion" {{Lang|zh=别墅之灾|zh_rm=Biéshù zhī Zāi|lit=Calamity of the Villa}} is a reference to the [[w:c:mihoyo:Liu Wei#Dawei's Villa|Dawei's Villa joke]] {{Lang|zh=大伟哥别墅|zh_rm=Dàwěigē Biéshù|lit=Brother Wei's Villa}} that originated from ''Houkai Gakuen 2'' players.
** The yellow plushie that the Unusual Hilichurl pulls out of the suitcase is called [https://houkai2nd.miraheze.org/wiki/Homu Homu], which is a direct reference to ''Houkai Gakuen 2'' and ''Honkai Impact 3''; it first appeared in the former as Bronya's doll.
** The Cabbages he uses and drops are a reference to the ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' mascot, Ai-chan, whose hairstyle and hair color are similar to a cabbage.
** The number of Mora drops are exactly 233 Mora. "233" is a Chinese internet slang equivalent to "laugh out loud."
* Translation of the Archive description: "Homu, Homu, we dance!"
* Upon defeat, the Unusual Hilichurl says one of two phrases: "muhe domu" which can be translated from [[Hilichurlian]] as "want to dance", or "gusha buka" – "vegetables stomach", which may refer to him leaving cabbages and can be considered cursing (since gusha has negative connotations).
* During the [[Version 1.5]] event ''[[Mimi Tomo]]'', the hilichurls that the player interacts with during the story refer to the Unusual Hilichurl as "Wei."
* During the ''[[Energy Amplifier Initiation]]'' event, the Unusual Hilichurl can be affected by the Irminsul Fruit Fragment's aura.
