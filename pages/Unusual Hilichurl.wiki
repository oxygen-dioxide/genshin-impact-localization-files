{{Description|"Homu, homu, mimi domu!"|[[Archive]]}}
'''Unusual Hilichurl''' &mdash; ''Menace of the Mansion'' is a unique common [[enemy]]. It wears a mask that reads "Wei" (伟), a reference to HoYoverse's general president, Liu Wei: it is mostly a game Easter egg.

For specific locations, see the [https://act.hoyolab.com/ys/app/interactive-map/index.html#/map/ HoYoLAB Teyvat Interactive Map].

==Spawning Pattern==
Two Unusual Hilichurls spawn every 12 hours, in 14 different possible locations, 6 in [[Mondstadt]] and 8 in [[Liyue]]. They do not spawn in [[Inazuma]] nor [[Dragonspine]]. Unlike other enemies, the Unusual Hilichurl is passive and will not react to players unless attacked.

There can only be one Unusual Hilichurl in the player's world at any given time. When an Unusual Hilichurl is defeated, it will go into its work briefcase and teleport to one of the 14 possible locations. After defeating the second one, there is a 12-hour cooldown before the Unusual Hilichurl can be fought again.

If the player finds them but leaves them alone, they will remain there for 12 hours before reappearing in another location. If the first one is defeated but not the second one, 12 hours after the first kill the spawn locations and count will reset. If the two Unusual Hilichurls are not found, they will respawn in a different location after some time (exact time is currently unknown; probably 12 hours).

==Drops==
Drops are limited to 10 successful encounters per day, as they can be farmed in [[Co-Op Mode]].

==Strategy==
===Locating===
*Bringing a character that can create a [[Geo Construct]] may be useful, in order to activate the [[Pressure Plate]] to create a wind current at the Stone Gate location.
*It is quicker to find whether the Unusual Hilichurl is present at some locations than others. Visiting these locations first can save time; however, it may be dependent on render distance. These locations include: Windrise, Stormterror's Lair, Qingyun Peak, Lingju Pass, and Mingyun Village.

===Combat===
*The Unusual Hilichurl can be [[knockback]]ed and pulled by [[Vacuum Field]]s while not using an attack. While using an attack, it cannot be interrupted.
*The Unusual Hilichurl cannot be rendered immobile by [[Frozen]], Petrification from [[Zhongli]]'s [[Planet Befall]], or [[Mona]]'s [[Stellaris Phantasm]].
*The Unusual Hilichurl is unaffected by [[Aggravation#Taunting Talents|taunts]].
*The Unusual Hilichurl can be defeated by drowning.
*The Unusual Hilichurl can be defeated by fall damage.

==Trivia==
* Unusual Hilichurl (also known as Wei) is based on Liu Wei (also known as Da Wei), the director and co-founder of HoYoverse. Da Wei also appeared in other games such as ''Houkai Gakuen 2'' and ''Honkai Impact 3rd''.
* During the [[Version 1.5]] event [[Mimi Tomo]], the hilichurls the players interact with during the story refer to the Unusual Hilichurl as "Wei."
* The yellow plushie that Wei pulls out of his suitcase is called [https://houkai2nd.miraheze.org/wiki/Homu Homu], which is a direct reference to ''Houkai Gakuen 2'' and ''Honkai Impact 3''; it first appeared in the former as the character Bronya's doll.
* The Cabbages he uses and drops are in reference to HI3's mascot, Ai-chan, whose hairstyle and hair color is similar to the look and color of a cabbage.
* The number of Mora drops are exactly 233 Mora. "233" is a Chinese internet slang equivalent to "laugh out loud."
* During the [[Energy Amplifier Initiation]] event, the Unusual Hilichurl can be affected by the Irminsul Fruit Fragment's aura.
* Archive Description Translation: "Homu, Homu, we dance!"
* Upon defeat, the Unusual Hilichurl says one of two phrases: "muhe domu" which can be translated from [[Hilichurlian]] as "want to dance", or "gusha buka" – "vegetables stomach", which may refer to him leaving cabbages and can be considered cursing (since gusha has negative connotations).
