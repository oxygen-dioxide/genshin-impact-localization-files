==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Atzi:''' Daddy doesn't have time to play, so I'll have to go hang out with the baby [[Saurian]]s instead...
:{{DIcon}} Your dad's a busy man, then?
::'''Atzi:''' Not at all! All he does is walk around our encampment with his chest puffed out.
::'''Atzi:''' And he always tells me not to make too much noise around the Saurians. Hmph! I bet he just wants me to stay at home and do homework all day, every day. That sure would be easier for him, huh...
::'''Atzi:''' Hmph, well if he thinks I'll play ball with not playing ball, he's got another thing coming! I'm gonna go play hide-and-seek with the baby Saurians!
::'''Atzi:''' But it's so hard to beat Iktomisaurs at hide-and-seek... If only there were some [[Tepetlisaur]]s nearby instead.
::{{DIcon}} What about your mother?
::'''Atzi:''' She's a doctor, so she's super busy! She's often out working, and she even brings delicious food back home.
::'''Atzi:''' But whenever she's not out, she takes me to see [[Citlali|Granny Itztli]]...
::'''Atzi:''' Mom always brings Granny Itztli cabbages, [[Grainfruit]], and herbs. After that, she gets Granny to teach me some classes and leave me some homework...
::'''Atzi:''' Granny's homework is always so hard... Y'know what? Come to think of it, it's best that adults stay busy!
:{{DIcon}} Stay safe.
::'''Atzi:''' Don't worry, I will.
