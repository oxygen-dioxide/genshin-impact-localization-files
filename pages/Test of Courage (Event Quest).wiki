;(On obtaining quest)
:{{A|Vo sdeq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey {{Traveler}}, you'll never guess what Paimon just heard!
:{{A|Vo sdeq001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The [[Yashiro Commission]] is holding a Test of Courage event! They've even prepared rewards for participants who can pass the event's challenges!
:{{A|Vo sdeq001 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But uh, if it's a "Test of Courage," that means it's probably gonna be scary, right? So, if we join, Paimon's gonna let you go first...

;(Approach the Yashiro Commission)
;(Talk to Kamisato Ayato)
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ayato~!
:{{DIcon}} Long time no see!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Ah, it's you two. Yes, it has been a while.
:{{Introductory Note|character=Kamisato Ayato}}
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, we heard the Yashiro Commission is holding a Test of Courage, so we came right over to sign ourselves up!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We didn't expect to see you here in person, though. Does that mean this event is really important?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' You think I only make an appearance for occasions that are deemed sufficiently important? Hehe.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' It just so happens that this Test of Courage event was actually my suggestion, but naturally, I've left the planning and more trifling details to be arranged by my retainers.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Considering that such events are quite popular across Teyvat, I've had numerous examples to draw from, so everything should be in good order. I'm merely here to do a routine check on the progress of the event, that's all.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon gets it... so what you're saying is you're not very busy right now.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' In that case, maybe you can give us a quick rundown of the event rules!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 05.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Heh, only Paimon could be so natural at ordering others around.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 06.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' However... the possibility remains that we may yet require your assistance.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, sorry? What did you say?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 07.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Ah, nothing. Hehe, seeing as I apparently have some time, I suppose we may chat about the event for a moment.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yippee!
:{{DIcon}} Thanks, Ayato.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 08.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' As its name implies, the event is a game designed to put one's courage to the test.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 09.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' The venue for the event will be set up in the [[Chinju Forest]]. Before the start of each round, participants will be divided into teams of two.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 10.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Once teams have been formed, the event staff will announce the name of an item that has been placed in or around the Chinju Forest area.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 11.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' The first person to locate the specified item will be declared the winner of that round.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "The winner of that round"? Huh, so there's gonna be multiple rounds to the Test of Courage?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 12.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Precisely. There will be a total of three rounds in the Test of Courage because the event was actually orchestrated by three different parties.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 13.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Merchants raised event funding, the [[Kamisato Clan]] provided the grounds, and the [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Faction)|Grand Narukami Shrine]] provided consulting services.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 14.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' As such, each of these three parties have selected one item for participants to find, so naturally, the event will require three rounds to determine the winners.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, Paimon gets it. So basically, it boils down to searching for stuff in Chinju Forest.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We'll need to find one item each round, for a total of three items after three rounds. Simple enough for Paimon!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 15.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Yes, seems you've got the gist of it. We will be issuing different rewards based on the number of rounds won, so if a participant wins multiple rounds, then that will also be reflected in their final reward.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 16.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' If a participant manages to find all three items, then they shall receive the grand prize provided by the Grand Narukami Shrine.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, a grand prize! Sounds like it could be really valuable!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 17.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' As for its true value, I'm afraid you'll have to win the event first and ask [[Yae Miko|Lady Guuji]] yourself.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 18.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Of course, this event is intended to measure your courage. If you withdraw from the event because you become too frightened, then you might as well forget about seeing any rewards.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 19.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' I'm curious myself how many people will be brave enough to make it to the end. It'll be most disappointing if nobody claims the prizes we've prepared.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't worry, those prizes are as good as ours!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Even though just the thought of this event sends shivers down Paimon's little spine, {{Traveler}} will be brave enough, no doubt about that!
:{{DIcon}} That's right!
::{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 20a 1.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' I appreciate your enthusiasm. Hehe, I look forward to seeing how you perform.
:{{DIcon}} I'm not really that amazing...
::{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 20b 1.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' No need to be so modest. Your journey thus far already speaks volumes of your bravery.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 21.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Anyway, I think I've given you sufficient details. I'll add your names to the list of participants momentarily.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 22.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' As for the three items you'll be searching for, please wait for a staff member to inform you at the start of the event.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 ayato 23.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Oh, and a friendly word of advice... Test of Courage events tend to give rise to a variety of strange rumors and stories, so please, be sure to exercise caution.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! What did he mean by that!? Oh, will there be spooky things in Chinju Forest?
:{{DIcon}} It's certainly a possibility...
::{{A|vo sdeq001 2 paimon 15a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh! Now even you're trying to scare Paimon!
:{{DIcon}} He's just pulling your leg.
::{{A|vo sdeq001 2 paimon 15b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Heh, Paimon thought so, too... Well, in that case, there's nothing to be scared of!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 2 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, we've got an event to win... Grand prize, here we come!

;(Leave the Yashiro Commission)
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hold it right there! Haha, well if it isn't my compadres! Didn't expect to see you here.
:{{Introductory Note|character=Arataki Itto}}
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, Paimon knows that voice... It's [[Itto]]! What are you doing here?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, don't tell Paimon that you're here for the Test of Courage.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hah, what else! I'm sorry, but those prizes already belong to yours truly... Arataki "Ain't Scared of Nothin'" Itto!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 03.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' I mean, well, that's what I really wanna say... But uh, I've actually got something else goin' on.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? What's that?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 04.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Ah, it's a long story. As soon as I heard about the Test of Courage, I got the gang together and was ready to bring everyone for the time of their lives.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 05.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' But uh, it turns out the other members weren't as pumped about the event as me...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 06.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' "Chinju Forest? We've already been there a million times. There's nothing scary about that place!"
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 07.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' "That event's just a game for kids! What a waste of time... Let's play some Genius Invokation TCG!"
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 08.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' "Seriously, Test of Courage!? Ugh, whatever. I guess if that's what the boss wants..."
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 09.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Can you believe that!? What a group of deadbeats... I'm not gonna put up with that, nuh-uh, not in my gang!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon gets it now... dragging the gang to an event they don't want to go to won't be the best for your reputation as a leader.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 10.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hey, this isn't about me!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 11.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' As leader of the [[Arataki Gang]], it's my duty to find new and tantalizing experiences for everyone. A happy gang means a happy life!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 12.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Even if they can't get it through their stubborn heads now, one way or another, I'll show them how much fun a Test of Courage can be!
:{{DIcon}} Wow, Itto...
:{{DIcon}} You sure do care about your gang members...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 13.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Anywayyy, I'm no stranger to Chinju Forest. Sure, it was a little terrifying going through there, but hey, I'm used to it now!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 14.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' And seriously, what kind of scary pranks could those guys in the Yashiro Commission ever come up with? If they can't scare anyone, then it's not gonna be a "test of courage" now, is it?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 15.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Not to mention, if the gang starts complaining... I won't ever be able to show my face around here.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And after all that talk, it still boils down to you!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 16.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Ah, well, leading a gang can be complicated. You don't understand... Anywho, I've got a plan.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 17.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Since there's no way I can trust the Yashiro Commission to make a fun event, I've decided to step in and spice things up a little.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, you don't seriously mean that...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 18.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Oh, you bet I do! Yours truly is gonna be out scaring people! Hahaha, I'm taking this event to a whole 'nother level!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 19.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' But it's gonna take more than an [[oni]] to make it happen... So I came here to recruit some help, and then I saw you come walking along.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 20.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' C'mon! Come scare people with me, please!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No way!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 21.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Pretty please!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Forget it!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 22.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Pretty pretty pleaseee!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, fine! But don't forget, we're here to win the Test of Courage and take home the grand prize.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We'll help you out. Just don't get in the way of our prize.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 23.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hahaha, yes! You're a real oni saver! Don't worry, with me around, winning the Test of Courage will be a piece of cake.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 24.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Alright, those participants won't scare themselves! Let's get out there, hahaha!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What a noisy guy... Hmm, but after hearing him laugh and talk, Paimon doesn't feel scared anymore.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, maybe laughter is the key to making fear go away! If things get scary later, we can all start laughing at the top of our lungs!
:{{DIcon}} Okay.
:{{DIcon}} Pretty sure that would just make things even scarier...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 itto 25.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hey! {{Traveler}}, Paimon, enough chitchat! We're gonna miss the event!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 3 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! Coming!

:{{A|vo sdeq001 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, this looks like the place.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, is it just Paimon, or does it look a lot scarier than usual here?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 4 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hey, Paimon!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Waaah!!!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Argh! Don't sneak up on Paimon like that! What do you want?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 4 itto 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Ah nothing, I just had a thought occur to me.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 4 itto 03.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' I want to scare the gang members real good, but now that I think about it, I've never actually scared anyone before.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...You're only now realizing this?
:{{DIcon}} So you mean you want to practice first?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 4 itto 04.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Practice? Oh, now there's an idea.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 4 itto 05.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hey, I've got it! Why don't you join the Test of Courage like everyone else, and I'll go hide and try to scare you from time to time?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 4 itto 06.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Then, you two can judge my scaring skills. Alright, that's the plan. Lemme go get ready!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 4 itto 07.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Just wait, you'll see how scary this oni can be! Hahaha!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And there he goes, running off and still talking to himself...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, we were here to join the event anyway. Guess we'll just have to pass Itto's little "test" along with whatever else the event throws at us.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, seems one of the event staff is over there. Let's go talk to her.

;(Talk to the Shrine Maiden)
:{{A|vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 01.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' Aha, you must be here to participate in the Test of Courage?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, that's right! Uh, judging from your outfit, you must be one of the shrine maidens from the Grand Narukami Shrine!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 02.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' That's right. Huh, I can already see a dark aura surrounding the two of you... Yes, truly ominous.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 03.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' If you carelessly go running into the event, all it'll take is one little misstep and the darkness will swallow you up, hehehe...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! What's with the sinister laugh...? Is she really a shrine maiden?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 04.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' Sure you don't want to back out? This is your last chance. I'll count it down... three... two... one. Welcome to the Test of Courage... Enter at your own risk.
:{{DIcon}} Uh, was that the first test?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 05.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' Sure, you could say that. You know, the most unfortunate tales always happen unexpectedly on just a normal, average day... just like today.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 06.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' But no need to worry. Allay your qualms and suspicions... Everything was already set into motion the moment you two stepped into this place.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 07.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' Just enjoy the calm before the storm... The first round is about to begin. Have you already decided on your partner?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, you finally said something that Paimon can understand! Yep, the two of us will be partners! We always make the best team!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 08.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' ...Hmm?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 09.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' But it appears your names were written together as a single participant... "{{Traveler}} and Paimon."
:{{A|vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 10.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' Which means, you'll have to find yourselves another partner in order to join the event.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, are you serious!?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, if only Itto hadn't gone running off on his own, we could have had a partner! Now what should we do?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 11.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' As far as I know, there have been other participants who have yet to designate a partner. You could go ask around.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 5 hitomi 12.ogg}} '''Shrine Maiden:''' Just be sure to make it quick. If you don't have a partner by the time the event starts, then you'll be immediately disqualified!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh oh, we can't let that happen! Let's go see if we can find anyone to partner up with nearby!

;(Talk to Kamisato Ayaka)
:{{A|vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Oh, {{Traveler}} and Paimon! Greetings!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, it's Ayaka! Are you here for the Test of Courage, too?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Yes, my brother told me that the event would be "most interesting," and suggested that I personally participate.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I have never experienced a Test of Courage event, so I don't really know what to expect.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so this is your first time?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' To be frank, I'm no expert when it comes to the supernatural... I often worry that I haven't shown spirits proper respect and have brought shame upon my clan.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 05.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Oh, speaking of which, may I ask if the two of you are partners for the event?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Actually, the shrine maiden just told us that we only count as a single participant, however that works... so we're looking for a partner now!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 06.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Splendid. In that case, how would you like to be my partner?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 07.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I always feel at ease when you're by my side. Ah, but of course, please don't let me get in the way if you wish to participate with someone else...
:{{DIcon}} I want to partner up with Ayaka.
::{{A|vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 08a 1.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Oh, you'd really like to? Then it's my honor... Or I suppose I should say, please pardon my inexperience.
::{{A|vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 08a 2.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' And if I appear to be frightened, please promise not to laugh at me.
:{{DIcon}} Let me think about it...
::{{A|vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 08b 1.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Sure, I understand. I'll be waiting for you here.
::{{A|vo sdeq001 7 ayaka 08b 2.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' You may let me know if you need anything.

;(Talk to Kamisato Ayaka again)

:{{A|vo sdeq001 8 gorou 02.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Well... I was originally headed to Yae Publishing House to hand in responses for this month's issue of That's Life.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 8 gorou 03.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' But I had no idea that that crafty fox would be there! She brought up the Test of Courage event and suggested I give it a try.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 8 gorou 04.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' I wasn't interested, but she said, "The mighty general of Watatsumi Island isn't afraid of anything, is he?"
:{{A|vo sdeq001 8 gorou 05.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' And before I knew it, I found myself caught in her persuasive mind games. *sigh* I immediately regretted it the moment I arrived here. There could be traps everywhere...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, this event's sounding more and more dangerous...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 8 gorou 06.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' My instinct tells me that the forest is chock-full of ambushes. One misstep and it'll be over.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 8 gorou 07.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Perhaps that crafty fox is hiding somewhere in the dark, waiting for another opportunity to tease me. Who knows, she might even use a Kamera and send embarrassing photos back to Watatsumi Island...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 8 gorou 08.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Her Excellency once said, "When you march into an ambush, escape the enemy vanguard. When escape is impossible, then seek ample reinforcements."
:{{A|vo sdeq001 8 gorou 09.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Hmm, now that you're here, maybe we can turn the tables. Could I ask you two to partner up with me?

:{{DIcon}} Let me think about it...
::{{A|vo sdeq001 8 gorou 10b 1.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Oh, sure... I completely understand. Perhaps you have a friend you'd like to enter the Test of Courage with?

:{{A|vo sdeq001 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, not at all! It's just that Paimon's never seen you get scared, Kazuha.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're always so calm and collected. It's like you've never been scared by anything!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 9 kazuha 04.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' You flatter me. I suppose that's only a reflection of my time wandering the wilderness. I've heard many strange stories in my travels.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 9 kazuha 05.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I can say I've even experienced a few myself. Over time, I must have gotten used to it.

:{{A|vo sdeq001 9 kazuha 06.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' After hearing the Yashiro Commission promote the rewards for this event, I was guessing that you two would show up.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 9 kazuha 07.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Since we hadn't seen each other for some time, I figured I might as well come and see you. After all, meeting someone after being apart for so long always lifts the spirits.

:{{A|vo sdeq001 9 kazuha 08.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' That's right. So, tell me, how has your journey been lately?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Things have gone pretty well! Uh, by the way, the shrine maiden told us that everyone needs a partner to participate in the Test of Courage event. Have you found a partner yet, Kazuha?

:{{A|Vo sdeq001 39 kazuha 04.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' It seems the test wasn't as scary as I had anticipated. However, I have enjoyed the experience together with you.

:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 01.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Oh, hello. Miko told me about the Test of Courage event taking place here. I thought I would come and have a look.
:{{Introductory Note|Raiden Shogun}}
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, so that's why you're here. So, what do you think of the Test of Courage, are you having fun?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 02.ogg}} '''Ei:''' It's more or less the same as I remember before.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 03.ogg}} '''Ei:''' I wasn't scared by anything... But on the contrary, some of the event participants were horrified the moment they saw me.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that Miko! Did she send Ei here to scare people on purpose!?
:{{DIcon}} Certainly seems that way.
:{{DIcon}} Sure sounds like something she'd do...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If that's the case, it feels like Ei isn't really experiencing the event like everyone else...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon has an idea! We'll give you a bottle of the Dango Milk we just found. That would make you a winner in this round, too!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 04.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Ah yes, isn't that the dessert drink we had the last time we met? Sure, I'll take one.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 05.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Actually, I've sensed a familiar feeling ever since I arrived here. It's brought some old memories to mind.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? A familiar feeling?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 06.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Have you been down to the beach by any chance?
:{{DIcon}} Yes, we have.
:{{DIcon}} No, not yet...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 07.ogg}} '''Ei:''' I was just strolling nearby when I noticed a space at the beach with a familiar game set up on it.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 08.ogg}} '''Ei:''' I took a brief look, and it appeared to be a game where you control flippers hovering in the air to strike a ball and hit some positioned elemental cubes.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 09.ogg}} '''Ei:''' I saw the game was called "Akitsu Yuugei." I'm guessing it originated from "Akitsu {{Rubi|Hazura."|Haneasobi}} The thought of that game caused me to recall some things from the past.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Akitsu {{Rubi|Hazura?|Haneasobi}} What's that?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 10.ogg}} '''Ei:''' It's a game where you use hagoita to hit a ball towards a set target. It was once quite popular during festivals.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 11.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Makoto also enjoyed playing Akitsu {{Rubi|Hazura|Haneasobi}} when she was alive. Hyakkiyakou was still around at that time, and nights in Inazuma were much more lively than they are now.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 12.ogg}} '''Ei:''' The youkai would hold festivals from time to time, gathering to drink, laugh, and play music...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, does that mean you could eat the delicious festival food whenever you liked?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 13.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Yes. The youkai called their celebration the "[[Mikawa Flower Festival]]." Makoto and I attended it once... She found it particularly fascinating.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 14.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Sadly, the past has all but vanished. But seeing a game like that again does make me feel happy.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds like it could be fun! Paimon would like to play!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 15.ogg}} '''Ei:''' If you're interested, you can go to the beach and give it a try.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 16.ogg}} '''Ei:''' It was still being set up when I was there earlier, but I assume it should be ready soon.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yay!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 17.ogg}} '''Ei:''' I shall return to [[Tenshukaku]]. Miko told me that the Test of Courage consists of three rounds, so please keep up the effort and give it your best until the end.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 18.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Considering you two, I think you should have no problem making it to the end.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, of course! Hehe...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 raidenei 19.ogg}} '''Ei:''' I know you can do it, good luck.
:;(Ei leaves)
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't remember hearing anything about a game on the beach from Ayato... You think that activity's also planned by the Yashiro Commission?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, the more Paimon thinks about it, the scarier it feels... Ugh, this whole Test of Courage thing is keeping Paimon on edge!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 44 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, the first round of the event should be finished by now, so let's head back!

:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 itto 03.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Easy peasy. We'll wait for them to get real close, and then we'll jump out and shout together. They won't know what hit them!

:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 itto 04.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hey, don't underestimate me. It may sound simple, but I know exactly what will scare them.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 itto 05.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' The gang's probably moping along on their way back, saying things like, "this is boring" and "let's go home."
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 itto 06.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' But it's dark and their guard is down &mdash; now's our chance. Having the three of us suddenly come flying outta the bushes is gonna scare 'em real good.

:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So all the strange rumors about the Test of Courage are true... Oh, what should we do? Do you think the ghosts are coming after us?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 itto 15.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Haha, Paimon, I didn't expect you to be such a baby!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, you're one to talk! You were the first to start running! Don't make fun of Paimon!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 itto 16.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Well, you shouted "ghosts," so my instinct to escort you two to safety kicked in.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 itto 17.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' After all, real "ghosts" are terrifying, my skills are completely useless against 'em!
:{{DIcon}} So, why did we stop running?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 itto 18.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Oh, because I just realized that they were also running from us.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 itto 19.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Which means they were afraid of us, too... And if that's the case, then there shouldn't be anything to worry about.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 itto 20.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Now that I've calmed down, I'm starting to wonder if they were actually ghosts... They might have been people dressed up as ghosts to scare us!
:{{DIcon}} Were they sent by the Yashiro Commission then?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 itto 21.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Definitely not. During the event, I took a little walk around the Chinju Forest and saw all the gimmicks that the Yashiro Commission had set up.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 itto 22.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Those three weren't from the Yashiro Commission, but they did seem a little familiar...

:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' B&mdash;But... th&mdash;there's still a chance that they were real spirits, right?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If we go back now, they might try to eat us...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 itto 24.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' It's alright, Paimon. If you're scared, you can stay here. {{Traveler}} and I will go investigate.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Whew, that'd be great!
:{{DIcon}} But wouldn't it be more dangerous to stay here alone?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, right! The last mystery novel Paimon bought from Yae Publishing House had a plot just like that...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' During the investigation, whoever said "I'm not going" would always be the next victim.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, so on second thought, Paimon's going with you. Don't ever leave Paimon behind! EVER!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 itto 25.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' It looked like they were running that way. But it's hard to say exactly where they went, so let's split up!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But then you'll be all alone, which, according to the mystery novels, is super dangerous.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 itto 26.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hahaha! Don't worry about me. Once my rear's in gear, I'm not afraid of nothin'.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh~ Paimon has a bad feeling about this...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 itto 27.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' They scared you that bad, huh? Looks like they really do have a knack for spooking people.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 itto 28.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' This time, I'll capture them and learn their art for scaring people! Anyway, I'll catch you around!
:;(Itto runs off)
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And there he goes, running off and talking to himself... again.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, do we really have to go?
:{{DIcon}} We'd better go have a look.
:{{DIcon}} Just sitting here won't accomplish anything.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh fine, let's go take a look then.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 46 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But the second we see anything scary, we make a run for it! Got it?

:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! Are you here to rescue Paimon?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, and Heizou's here too! Huh? What happened to that scary person just now? Did you manage to defeat her?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 04.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Scary person?
:{{DIcon}} There was a person wearing a weird outfit...
:{{DIcon}} And who spoke strangely.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 05.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Okay, I see...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 06.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' I only found the two of you passed out here when I arrived. There was no one else around.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 07.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' What happened? Tell me all the details.
:{{Black Screen|You tell Heizou everything that just happened...}}
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 08.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' As I suspected, there appears to be something more behind this Test of Courage event.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 09.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' But let's get back to your original question, I haven't told you the reason I'm here.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 10.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' The truth is, I was commissioned to come here for an investigation.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You were... commissioned?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 11.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' That's right. Some time ago, a peculiar game was discovered on the beach.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A peculiar game on the beach... Ohh, could it be the Akitsu Yuugei game that Ei mentioned?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 12.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Ah, so you've heard of it...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 13.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' The game quietly appeared some time ago and has since attracted some players. Apparently, it's very interesting.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 14.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' There was no one on the beach other than visitors and tourists when the game appeared. Imagine it like this: a stall suddenly appears on the street with no owner...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 15.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' And stranger yet, it could operate normally without anyone supervising it. People at the beach can start the game simply by talking to the Bulletin Board...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Could it be run by... ghosts?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 16.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Some tourists started to say that, and the rumor began to spread, until it became a full-blown ghost story. The further that story spread, the more plausible it seemed, causing people to be unwilling to go anywhere near the beach.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 17.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' The [[Tenryou Commission]] wanted to close the beach in order to investigate the situation and dispel the rumors, but before they could do anything, the Yashiro Commission organized the Test of Courage event here.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 18.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' People that were initially scared by the rumors began to believe that the "beach game" was actually a preview event planned by the Yashiro Commission for the Test of Courage, so visitors have gradually returned again.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 19.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' But I'm quite positive that the game never had anything to do with the Yashiro Commission...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, so the Yashiro Commission were fully aware of all the spooky stuff going on, but they still decided to hold their event here?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But... Ayato must be one of the smartest guys we know. What the heck was he thinking!?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 20.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Who knows? But I'd rather trust tangible evidence than speculate on his thoughts.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 21.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' As for my commission, apparently someone reported that they found themselves trapped for hours on the beach while playing the game.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 22.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' According to his own account, he kept returning to the same location no matter which way he went, and even though his friends were nearby, they couldn't see him.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, that sounds so scary!
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 23.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Even though it was obvious that he wasn't telling me the whole story, the testimonies of his friends did validate that what he said actually occurred.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 24.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' On top of that, it was also this very incident that led to all the ghost rumors. No one dared to go near the beach until the Yashiro Commission announced the Test of Courage...
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 25.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Who set up the game on the beach? And why did the Yashiro Commission help them cover it up?
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 26.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' I need to uncover the truth, so I'm here to investigate.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 27.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Anyway, don't mind me. Working together will only raise suspicion, so I'll undertake my own investigation for the time being.
:{{A|vo sdeq001 47 heizou 28.ogg}} '''Shikanoin Heizou:''' However, please proceed with caution. Based on my observations, most people are still unaware of anything happening here. Telling people that something's amiss might cause quite a stir.
