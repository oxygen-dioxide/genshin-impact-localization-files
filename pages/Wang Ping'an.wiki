==Profile==
As a young child, Wang was enthralled by the adepti after hearing tales of them from his grandfather, a folklorist. After his grandfather passed away, he searched through his belongings and found a [[Sigil of Permission]]. Cosplaying as an adepti known as Starsnatcher, he had initially done it for fun but soon became warped by greed and fame, eventually accumulating a small following that stopped at the outskirts of [[Wangshu Inn]].

In [[Xiao]]'s Story Quest, the Traveler stumbles into Wang and his party facing some tainted [[hilichurl]]s that were empowered as a result of Xiao's karmic debt tainting them. After scaring the hilichurls off, the Traveler talks with Wang, who demands payment in order to have their wish fulfilled. When they choose to bring him tasty food, they find him in [[Wanwen Bookhouse]] before returning to the inn, where they spot him trying to fend off the returning hilichurls to no avail. As he makes excuses for being unable to drive them off, the Traveler and Paimon soon found Xiao and informed him of the adepti they found. Xiao did not recall any adepti with such a name, leading them to realize he is a fake. After performing the Dream Trawler ritual, Wang's soul is brought to the three; seeing Xiao in the flesh causes him to realize the error of his ways and he forsakes his adeptus identity, repaying all of his followers and giving the Traveler belongings he no longer needed, including the Sigil of Permission. His followers however, were too absorbed with his supposed "benevolence", with [[Master of Stars|one]] of them finding his mask, although believing it to be a spare.

During the events of "[[Hereafter: The Trail of Pervases]]" and the subsequent quests, the Traveler found Starnatcher being attacked by a group of [[Hilichurls]]. Starnatcher was supposed to make an offering in the abandoned temple of [[Pervases]] after he was set up by the [[Treasure Hoarders]] in the area. With the help of the Traveler and the Millelith, he is able to renovate the temple.

===Personality===
Wang is a great fan of the adepti due to hearing the stories of their exploits from his grandfather. When he found a Sigil of Permission among his grandfather's possessions, he began using it to cosplay as a Yaksha. While he found it fun at first, he quickly became swayed by the temptation of riches and fame. He created a mask to disguise himself, but the purpose of it became twisted as the Yakshas only wore their masks when in battle to conceal their human weakness, but he wears his all-day.

As Starsnatcher, Wang tries to act like a wise adeptus, nearly matching them word by word with his speech. However, his supposed ability to grant wishes in return for payment causes the Traveler to strike him as suspicious as their encounters with actual adepti were far more humble. When faced with a problem he cannot handle, he quickly drops his adeptus speech and turns into a wreck.

After realizing the error of his ways, Wang considers himself to be a sinner and works to improve his body and spirit, not to redeem himself, but to be counted as a believer of the adepti.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Wang Ping'an''': Hello there. Are you here to offer incense today?
:{{DIcon}} Could you give me a few sticks?
::'''Wang Ping'an''': No problem. Please wait a moment...
::'''Wang Ping'an''': Here, take them. The censer is right there, please go ahead.
:;(Obtain [[Fine Incense]] if not owned yet.)
:{{DIcon}} Do many people come here to offer incense these days?
::'''Wang Ping'an''': A few. Not that many.
::'''Wang Ping'an''': This place is a little off the beaten track, and few people know that there is a temple here at all.
::'''Wang Ping'an''': Hmm. Perhaps I should find some way to let people know this temple is here...
:{{DIcon}} Have you finished your book yet?
::'''Wang Ping'an''': Not quite. Heh... well actually, to tell the truth, I'm still a long way off...
::'''Wang Ping'an''': I did collect quite a fair bit of material, but some of the stories don't have enough evidence to back them up.
::'''Wang Ping'an''': I've spent goodness-knows how much time just trying to confirm which sources are reliable.
::'''Wang Ping'an''': So as for my book... *sigh* Even I don't know how much longer it'll take at this point.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Wang Ping'an''': Alright. Stay safe, now. Be careful when you're out there. The roads are not that safe.
