|description  = '''The Sparrow Studies the Blade:''' The freshest [[Qingxin]] you ever saw. Just bursting with scent when you picked it. It probably needs some further processing before it's ready to brew, though.

'''Guardians of the Countryside:''' A translucent white flower that only grows at the highest peaks. It eschews the warmth and moisture of the plains to gaze out afar from the solitary mountaintops.
