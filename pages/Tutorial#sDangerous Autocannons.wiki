|text2    = In most circumstances, you can follow the energy flow to find the missing crystal {{color|help|"receiver nodes"}} for the autocannons. After {{color|help|inserting}} the nodes into the ship's cannons, and by continually {{color|help|releasing Xenochromatic Ball Octopus energy}} at them, the ship's autocannon {{color|help|control permissions}} can be overridden. It will then cease attacking characters and can be manually controlled.
