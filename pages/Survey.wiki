'''Surveys''' are questionnaires in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' that allow players to provide feedback on various topics. They can be accessed from the [[Paimon Menu]] > Surveys or through [[Mail]].

When a new survey is available, a Mail is sent containing a link to start the survey with an attachment of {{Item|Mora|x=300}}. Most surveys reward {{Item|Mora|x=20,000/30,000}}. Once a survey is completed, they cannot be viewed or resubmitted.
