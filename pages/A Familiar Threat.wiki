{{Quest Description|Paimon is curious about Neuvillette. Go talk to him.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Upon receiving the quest)
:{{A|vo sllq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's been a while since we last saw Neuvillette. Paimon wonders what he's been up to.
:{{A|vo sllq001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon has so many questions about his true identity... Let's go talk to him and find out!
----
;(Approach Neuvillette and Sedene in his office)
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 sedna 01.ogg}} '''Sedene:''' Wait, did I hear that right? Monsieur Neuvillette, are you sure you'd like to take over the case yourself?
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' That's right.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 sedna 02.ogg}} '''Sedene:''' But why? Technically speaking, cases like this are better left to the [[Garde]]s...
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Neuvillette, Sedene, hey there! What are you two talking about?
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 sedna 03.ogg}} '''Sedene:''' {{Traveler}} and Paimon, please help me talk our Chief Justice out of this. He wants to investigate a case on his own!
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 sedna 04.ogg}} '''Sedene:''' This is completely unprecedented. How can we have the Iudex acting like a private detective?
:{{DIcon}} Starting a new job?
::{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 02a 1.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Thank you for your concern, but I currently have no such plans.
::{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 02a 2.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Oh... apologies. I took your question in earnest, but it now occurs to me that it was mostly likely in jest.
:{{DIcon}} I can introduce you to some amazing detectives.
::{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 02b 1.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I trust that you'd be able to work that out with how well-connected you are, but I must apologize. I do not plan on relying on anyone else's help for this matter.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So what is it exactly? It sure sounds serious if it's something you've got to investigate personally!
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' A Melusine named Kiara received a threat letter.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And then...?
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' That is all the information I have acquired at this stage.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 sedna 05.ogg}} '''Sedene:''' *sigh* I have no idea why you're so hung up over this.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 sedna 06.ogg}} '''Sedene:''' I've checked the schedule in advance, and it seems like there aren't any trials today. So if you insist... I have no objections.
;(If the player has not completed [[The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur]])
::{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Thank you for understanding. I will leave a note explaining my absence on my desk &mdash; I would appreciate it if you could take it to Lady Furina.
::{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 06.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' She may have no interest in official affairs, but standard procedure dictates that I'm still responsible for reporting to her.
::{{A|vo sllq001 2 sedna 07.ogg}} '''Sedene:''' Yes yes! Understood. I'll come back later and deliver the note to her.
;(If the player has completed ''The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur'')
::{{A|vo sllq001 3 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Thank you for understanding.
::{{A|vo sllq001 3 sedna 07.ogg}} '''Sedene:''' Then I shall return to my post for now. If anyone were to visit while you are away, I will make sure to record their visit. I sincerely hope that you will return soon.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Judging from Sedene's reaction, it must be pretty rare for you to investigate stuff personally. What's so special about this case?
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 07.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I cannot tell you just yet, but it reminded me of certain past events.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' There could be complicated conflicts of interest behind all this, so I must eliminate all risks in advance.
:{{DIcon}} Conflicts of interest?
:{{DIcon}} Care to explain in detail?
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' C'mon, stop being so secretive! We still have no idea what's going on!
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 09.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' It is not my intention to keep you in the dark, but I need some time to revisit those memories and collect my thoughts.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 10.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Long story short... A little more than four hundred years ago, I became the Iudex of Fontaine and initiated a series of institutional reforms.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 11.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' There were few people I could trust, but I had two subordinates who were exceptionally trustworthy and capable: [[Carole]], a Melusine, and [[Vautrin]], leader of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' They must've been amazing people to receive such high praise from you!
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 12.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Indeed. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to protect them.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 13.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' The reforms damaged the interests of some, and the more conservative faction took advantage of Carole's identity to instigate political unrest. Ultimately, they wanted me to yield more of my power.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 14.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' The incident resulted in Carole taking her own life and Vautrin being exiled. From then on, I've been especially careful when dealing with cases related to Melusines.
:{{DIcon}} You're concerned that you're the perpetrator's real target?
:{{DIcon}} Seems like they're using Melusines against you...
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 15.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' All Melusines used to live a secluded life away from human society.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 16.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I granted their wishes when some of them, including Carole, asked me to bring them to the Court of Fontaine.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 17.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Many common folk believe that I share a special bond with the Melusines, and whatever they do can be traced back to me.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 18.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Some of them &mdash; especially those who hold a grudge against me &mdash; exploit that belief and stir up conflict over Melusines in an attempt to lay the blame on me.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 19.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I have nothing against the opinions of others, but the moment a whirlpool of conspiracy forms, it inevitably affects the innocent.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 20.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' And it's already happened once, and I want to make sure it does not happen again.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, even so, why do you have to be the one investigating?
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's the Gardes, the [[Marechaussee Phantom]], and the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol! Aren't they more than enough to figure out what's going on?
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 21.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Based on prior experience, there's a high chance that those who hold hostility towards me do not belong to the same department.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 22.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' The political system of Fontaine is relatively complex and involves the interests of multiple different factions.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 23.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' However, since I am technically an outsider in Fontaine, a lot of trouble could be avoided if I personally took on the case.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Outsider?
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But aren't you the Chief Justice of Fontaine? Why would you be an outsider?
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 24.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I understand where you're coming from, but there is not necessarily a connection between my responsibilities and how I perceive myself.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 25.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' You know very well about my true identity and have even met others of my kind in other nations...
:{{DIcon}} The Hydro Dragon Sovereign...
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 26.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Even though I was born with a human form, there's a fundamental difference between dragons and humans.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 27.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Taking on the role of Chief Justice does not make me a part of this community. In fact, the status I was granted has prevented me from forming deeper bonds with others.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 28.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I have lived in Fontaine for a long time, but I do not belong here. That is why I call myself an outsider &mdash; a fish out of water.
:{{DIcon}} If you put it that way...
:{{DIcon}} We're also outsiders to Fontaine.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! We have nothing to do with all those organizations anyway, so how about we come with you on your investigation?
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's team up and round up all the bad guys lurking in the dark!
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 29.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...That does not sound like a bad idea. I rarely investigate cases on my own, but with professionals like you around, I'm sure it'll go a lot smoother.
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon's starting to get a little embarrassed. Just leave it to us!
;(If the player has not completed ''The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur'')
::{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 30.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I'll write my note of absence right away. Let us depart together once I am done.
::{{Black Screen|Neuvillette writes a note to Furina and sets it on the desk.}}
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 neuvillette 31.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Let us go. We should visit Kiara first and try to gain a better understanding of the situation.
:;(Neuvillette leaves his office)
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, so Neuvillette feels like he doesn't truly belong here in Fontaine, but is that really true?
:{{A|vo sllq001 2 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon feels like he has a kinda... skewed perspective on a lot of things. Anyway, let's catch up with him first!

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo sllq001 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's been thinking... You called yourself a "fish out of water," right?
:{{A|vo sllq001 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But since you're the Hydro Dragon, wouldn't "dragon out of water" suit you better?
:{{A|vo sllq001 6 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Thank you for your suggestion. I will consider using the more accurate term in private occasions.
:{{A|vo sllq001 6 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Please allow me to rephrase: As a dragon out of water...
:{{A|vo sllq001 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Pfft! That sounds kinda weird! Let's stick with the previous version instead.

;(Talk to Sedene again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog sllq001 sedna 01.ogg}} '''Sedene:''' I hope the Chief Justice returns soon...
;(If the player has not completed ''The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur'')
:;(Read Neuvillette's note, optional)
::'''"Neuvillette's Note":''' "Away for personal reasons. Will be back in a day."

{{Quest Description|update|A Melusine named Kiara received a threatening letter. It has reminded Neuvillette of certain unhappy events in the past. Go ask Kiara about it...}}
;(Approach Graciette and Trudaine, optional)
:{{A|vo sllq001 7 graciette 01.ogg}} '''Graciette:''' I never thought I'd see him here...
:{{A|vo sllq001 7 trudaine 01.ogg}} '''Trudaine:''' Does anyone have a Kamera?

;(Talk to Graciette or Trudaine, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog sllq001 graciette 01.ogg}} '''Graciette:''' We should've gone up to him and said something...
:{{A|vo dialog sllq001 trudaine 01.ogg}} '''Trudaine:''' Yeah, that was the perfect opportunity...

;(Approach Kiara)
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 ciara 01.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' Whew... The weather's amazing today.
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Kiara.
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 ciara 02.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' Huh, Monsieur Neuvillette! And you are...
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 ciara 03.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' Oh, I remember! You're {{Traveler}} and Paimon. I've heard about you.
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aww, she's adorable! Hey there, it's nice to meet you!
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 ciara 04.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' Hehe, thanks for the compliment. Is there anything I can do for you?
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I heard from Sedene that you received a threatening letter.
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 ciara 05.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' A threatening letter... Oh, right, I remember now.
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 ciara 06.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' The letter fell through the crack in my door as I was heading out this morning. It said something about catching me, so I thought someone wanted to play hide-and-seek.
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 ciara 07.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' But Sedene told me it was a threatening letter and that I could be in danger. But that's not gonna happen with everyone looking after me, right?
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Have you run into any suspicious-looking people recently?
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 ciara 08.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' Suspicious-looking people? What counts as suspicious?
:{{DIcon}} Someone who follows you from behind?
:{{DIcon}} Someone who always strikes up a conversation with you?
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 ciara 09.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' Ah!
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did you think of something?
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 ciara 10.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' Nope! I don't remember meeting anyone like that!
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Do you still have the letter with you? I want you to show me what it says.
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 ciara 11.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' Oh, ah... Let's see... Found it!
:{{Color|menu|Kiara takes out a letter...}}
:[[File:A Familiar Threat Letter.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Now then... "Get lost! If you don't leave the Marechaussee Phantom, I will come and catch you in person. Don't say I didn't warn you!"
:;(Someone photographs the group from a distance)
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 neuvillette 06.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Hmm, a simple threat. Neither the handwriting nor the content itself reveals anything about the writer's intentions.
:{{DIcon}} Are they concealing their identity on purpose?
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 neuvillette 07.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' We can't rule out that possibility.
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Since you can't think of anyone suspicious, I'll be heading back to the Palais Mermonia to review some official documents.
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 neuvillette 09.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Kiara, you should come with us. It's safer if you stay close by.
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 ciara 12.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' Sure!
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 ciara 13.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' Wait, no, no, no, I still have a case to work on! I promised [[Eloffe]] that I'd check on her place later.
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 neuvillette 10.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' But you're being watched right now. Going off on your own could be dangerous...
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And that's where we come in to help! We'll stay with Kiara and make sure she's safe.
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' With us around, anyone scheming to hurt Kiara can forget about it!
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 ciara 14a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo sllq001 9 ciara 14b.ogg}}--> '''Kiara:''' Thank you, {{Traveler}}, Big Sis Paimon!
:{{DIcon}} Big Sis Paimon...
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Ahem! Don't worry, your Big Sis Paimon is super strong!
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 neuvillette 11.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Alright, let us go our separate ways for now. Please take care of Kiara.
:{{A|vo sllq001 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We'll take her to Eloffe's place right away. See you around!

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo sllq001 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, Kiara, how old are you?
:{{A|vo sllq001 10 ciara 01.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' Hmm, lemme think... One, two, ten... Uh, I can't remember.
----
{{Quest Description|update|You and Neuvillette decide to split up, and your job is to protect Kiara.}}
;(While walking with Kiara)
:{{A|vo sllq001 10 ciara 02.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' But I remember coming to the Court of Fontaine with Carole and Neuvillette. That must've been a long time ago.
:{{A|vo sllq001 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Carole... Didn't Neuvillette mention her just now? That was more than four hundred years ago! Why would Paimon be a big sister to you?
:{{A|vo sllq001 10 ciara 03.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' My memory isn't that good, but Carole told me I could address others based on how I feel about them... Paimon feels a lot more grown-up than me, so you're Big Sis.
:{{A|vo sllq001 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, Paimon sees...
:{{Color|menu|At this moment, the *click* of a Kamera shutter is heard.}}
:{{A|vo sllq001 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey {{Traveler}}, did you hear that?

;(Follow Kiara to Chioriya Boutique)
:;(Someone quickly ducks into the bushes as the Traveler and Paimon turn around)
:{{A|vo sllq001 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Strange... Paimon felt like someone was following us...
:{{A|vo sllq001 11 ciara 01.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' Eloffe!
:{{A|vo sllq001 11 eloffe 01.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' Kiara, you're here! Huh? Wait, aren't these two...
:{{A|vo sllq001 11 ciara 02a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo sllq001 11 ciara 02b.ogg}}--> '''Kiara:''' They're {{Traveler}} and Big Sis Paimon!
:{{A|vo sllq001 11 eloffe 02.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' I thought so. What brings you here?
:{{DIcon}} We're on a secret mission.
::{{A|vo sllq001 11 eloffe 03a 1.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' Alright, guess I shouldn't have asked.
:{{DIcon}} We're protecting Kiara.
::{{A|vo sllq001 11 eloffe 03b 1.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' Did you run into any trouble?
::{{A|vo sllq001 11 paimon 02b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh, it's not really trouble anymore with us around.
:{{A|vo sllq001 11 ciara 03.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' May I begin inspecting the store as planned?
:{{A|vo sllq001 11 eloffe 04.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' Of course, go ahead!
:{{Color|menu|Kiara investigates the shop.}}
:{{A|vo sllq001 11 ciara 04.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' Hmm... No hazards detected. You've cleared the inspection. Seems like the criminal from that case last month never set foot in here at all.
:{{A|vo sllq001 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That was quick! What were you inspecting?
:{{A|vo sllq001 11 ciara 05.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' I took a look around the shop. Neuvillette says that us Melusines have special eyes that can see things people can't.
:{{A|vo sllq001 11 ciara 06.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' Things like bloodstains. No matter how hard you try to clean them up, we Melusines can see their residual stains for some time. Pretty cool, huh?
:{{A|vo sllq001 11 eloffe 05.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' Alright, alright, now that you're done inspecting, can we have a chat?
:{{A|vo sllq001 11 eloffe 06.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' Hear me out. I'm planning to release an outfit for children next month and wanted to hire you as my model. Is that okay with you?
:{{A|vo sllq001 11 ciara 07.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' Of course! Is there anything I need to do?
:{{A|vo sllq001 11 eloffe 07.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' Please wait a moment while I take your measurements. The sample should be a perfect fit...
:{{A|vo sllq001 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seems like they get along really well!
:{{A|vo sllq001 11 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, {{Traveler}}? What are you looking at?
:{{DIcon}} I think there's someone over there...
:{{A|vo sllq001 11 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is there really someone watching us!? Shh... Let's sneak over and take a look.

;(Talk to Eloffre or Kiara again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog sllq001 eloffe 01.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' I think light and frilly clothes look best on you. You'd definitely look cute wearing them.
:{{A|vo dialog sllq001 ciara 01.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' I love them too! Especially the soft and fluffy kind...

;(Approach Charlotte)
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Strange... Why isn't he back yet...
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Gotcha!
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Whoa!!
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Charlotte!? What are you doing here?
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, don't tell Paimon you're the one who sent Kiara that threatening letter! But you don't seem like the type to&mdash;
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Threat letter? What threat letter?
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here, exactly?
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Uh, this is starting to feel like an interrogation... Okay, I'll be straight with you. I don't know the slightest thing about that threat letter you mentioned &mdash; I only wanted to follow Monsieur Neuvillette and request an interview with him.
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You wanna interview him?
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' That's right! I'm not the only one, y'know. Interviewing him is every journalist's dream.
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 charlotte 06.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' But it's not an easy task to accomplish. The Palais Mermonia rarely accepts appointment requests from us, and we never have the chance to interrupt when the court's in session.
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 charlotte 07.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' So imagine how surprised I was seeing him out on the streets today! It seemed like you were investigating something too... The perfect opportunity to whip up an exclusive, don't you think?
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 charlotte 08.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Of course, I'll make sure to turn in my manuscript to him for review. I have my principles, and I'd never publish an article without the consent of all parties involved.
:{{DIcon}} I don't think he'd agree...
:{{DIcon}} It's better if we kept this secret.
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! We're doing a secret investigation that can't be made public knowledge!
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 charlotte 09.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I see... Well, if you say so, I guess I'll put this matter aside for now. What a shame... Chances like this don't come by very often, you know.
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 charlotte 10.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' In exchange, could you tell me what the threat letter is about? I swear I won't tell!
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright then...
:{{Black Screen|You tell Charlotte about the letter Kiara received...}}
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 charlotte 11.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' WHAT!? Someone's targeting a cute little Melusine?
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Shh, not so loud!
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 charlotte 12.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' It just so happens that I did an interview with Kiara &mdash; last month, in fact. It was well-received by our readers, so I was planning to continue the series... and now someone's coming after her?
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 charlotte 13.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I'll ask my colleagues about it. Who knows? We might find something. And don't worry, I know what I'm doing! This secret's safe with me.
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 charlotte 14.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' But I gotta warn you, even if I keep my lips sealed, others will know eventually.
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why?
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 charlotte 15.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' People care a great deal about Monsieur Neuvillette's each and every move. Some may have already realized that something was up. Besides, the case involves Melusines, so...
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 charlotte 16.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Anyway, I'll get going now. Watch yourselves, alright?
:{{A|vo sllq001 13 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, that was a nice chat... Let's head back and check on Kiara.

;(Approach Eloffe, Kiara, and Clorinde)
:{{A|vo sllq001 14 eloffe 01.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' What do you think? The design looks pretty good, huh?
:{{A|vo sllq001 14 ciara 01.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' I think it's great!
:{{A|vo sllq001 14 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' It's very pretty indeed.
:{{A|vo sllq001 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Clorinde! What are you doing here?
:{{A|vo sllq001 14 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It seems that you just showed up out of nowhere.
:{{A|vo sllq001 14 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' As I passed by the Palais Mermonia, I heard that Neuvillette was investigating a case with you.
:{{A|vo sllq001 14 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Technically speaking, he and I are under an employer-employee relationship. It didn't feel right to have my employer personally take on such trivial cases.
:{{A|vo sllq001 14 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I happen to have some time at the moment and came to take a look. I sometimes have my clothes custom-made at this boutique, in any case, so we always have a lot to talk about.
:{{A|vo sllq001 14 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Neuvillette sure is lucky to have someone like you!
:{{A|vo sllq001 14 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Leave this to me. You should go meet up with Neuvillette.
:{{A|vo sllq001 14 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay then, we'll leave Kiara in your hands. C'mon, Let's go find Neuvillette!

;(Talk to Kiara or Clorinde again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog sllq001 ciara 02.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' How has your work been recently?
:{{A|vo dialog sllq001 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Same as usual. My schedule normally isn't too packed, so I have plenty of time for myself.
:{{A|vo dialog sllq001 ciara 03.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' Ooh, then shall we go out to play? How about a beach vacation, like last time?
:{{A|vo dialog sllq001 ciara 04.ogg}} '''Kiara:''' I've even signed up as a volunteer lifeguard! I'm really good at swimming, so I'm sure I can help.
----
{{Quest Description|update|Clorinde offers to protect Kiara. Now, rendezvous with Neuvillette.}}
;(Approach Neuvillette in his office)
:{{A|vo sllq001 16 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Oh? You're back. Is everything alright?
:{{A|vo sllq001 16 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We ran into Clorinde! She offered to help us protect Kiara.
:{{A|vo sllq001 16 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' That is good to hear &mdash; I trust her abilities. It looks like Kiara's in good hands.
:{{A|vo sllq001 16 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We thought so too! Well, did you find any leads?
:{{A|vo sllq001 16 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I've been looking through the case records. Specifically, inspection reports submitted by Kiara and major cases I've judged over the past decade.
:{{A|vo sllq001 16 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I've come up with two plans. On one hand, I could start with Kiara and track down the group behind all this, step by step.
:{{A|vo sllq001 16 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' On the other... I could also analyze the conflicting interests of these major cases and confirm my suspicions if there is indeed a mysterious group that bears a grudge against me.
:{{A|vo sllq001 16 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, they both sound like pretty solid plans! But can you really finish browsing through all these documents? That's a lot of reading... even for Paimon.
:{{A|vo sllq001 16 neuvillette 06.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Don't worry, I'm a fast reader when it comes to official documents. After all, I have several hundred years of reviewing under my belt.
:{{A|vo sllq001 16 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We'll help you read through them! We have nothing else to do.
:{{A|vo sllq001 16 neuvillette 07.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Thank you. I will continue looking through the ones piled up on the desk, but feel free to browse through anything else in this room.

;(Talk to Neuvillette again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog sllq001 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...You're done reading already? Please wait a moment, I still need some time.

;(After reading all five documents)
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Have you made any progress?
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We skimmed through some of them, but there wasn't anything useful.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's so many documents lying around! Just how many cases have you handled!?
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I would love to answer that question, but the truth is, I've never made a precise calculation myself.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' If memory serves me right, there should be at least one hundred thousand cases. The documents you see are just a small fraction of what is really there.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa... that's a lot! Looks like the work of a Chief Justice isn't easy at all.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' That might be how it seems like from another's perspective, but trials and official duties are, to me, simply routine.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' There are many documents here. Take a break if you're tired.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew, you read Paimon's mind!
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 06.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Alright, let us take a break then.
:;(Everyone takes a seat)
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 07.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Even though resting is a part of taking a break, shouldn't we at least talk about something?
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' All this silence is making Paimon feel really awkward...
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Please pardon my lack of consideration. People rarely come to the Palais Mermonia for matters outside of work. To be quite honest, I'm not sure what we should do.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 09.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Would you like to have some drinks, perhaps? You must be thirsty after all that work.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, drinks! Thank you!
:{{Color|menu|After Neuvillette leaves, Paimon discusses with you quietly.}}
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon wonders what Neuvillette likes to drink... Oh! Maybe he's a fan of really fancy wines!
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He seems like the type of person who'd own an entire winery... Y'know, like Diluc!
:{{Black Screen|Neuvillette momentarily leaves and brings back several exquisite wine glasses...}}
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... What's inside these glasses? It looks just like water...
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 10.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' An astute observation. It is indeed water.
:;(The Traveler and Paimon look at Neuvillette, and then each other)
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So it's just plain old water!?
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 11.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' What did you think it was?
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... Since you're the Chief Justice and all, Paimon thought you'd prefer something more sophisticated.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 12.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' This water is indeed very special. It would not be an overstatement to call it "sophisticated."
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 13.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I believe you've already tried Fonta. In fact, there are many other drink factories in Fontaine, including those that specialize in packaging pure drinking water.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 14.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Said water is sourced from all across Teyvat, including Mondstadt's Cider Lake, Liyue's Qingce Village, and Inazuma's Konda Village...
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 15.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Here's one of their latest products: water from Sumeru's Apam Woods.
:{{DIcon}} Is there any difference?
:{{DIcon}} They're all just water, aren't they?
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 16.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' If I were to comment on their mouthfeel... The waters of Cider Lake warm the heart, the waters of Qingce Village have a poignant touch, while one might call the waters of Konda Village placid.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 17.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Distinct differences exist between the waters of each area. You'll appreciate their intricacies once you taste them carefully.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Let Paimon try...
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 18.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' What do you think?
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nope, Paimon couldn't taste any difference at all! Isn't this just normal water?
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 19.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' How regrettable. It seems like you still have a long way to go in refining your tastes.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, this doesn't have to do with refining our tastes! Paimon's pretty sure most ordinary people can't tell the difference... How'd you do it anyway?
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Could it be because you're the Hydro Dragon?
:{{DIcon}} That could be the case.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, we are allowed to bring that up, right? Since there's no one else around...
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon's been wanting to ask this for ages! If you're the Hydro Dragon, why would you become Chief Justice in human society?
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 20.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' ...
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, sorry, Paimon was just curious. You don't have to answer!
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 21.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' There's nothing to hide. I was simply organizing my thoughts.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 22.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I accepted this position because I wanted to seek out answers to questions that have perplexed me.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Questions? Are there really things you can't figure out?
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 23.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Many, in fact. But the one question that puzzles me the most concerns my own existence.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 24.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' In essence... I neither know why I was born in this form, nor do I understand where my long life should take me.
::;(Before completing [[Masquerade of the Guilty]])
::{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 25.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I lost many memories from the moment I was born. The [[Primordial Sea]], for example. I can only vaguely recall its connection to me, but I am unaware of what that connection is exactly.
::;(After completing [[Masquerade of the Guilty]])
::{{A|vo sllq001 5 neuvillette 25.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' For a long time, my memory was rather incomplete. With regard to the Primordial Sea, for example. I used to only be able to vaguely recall its connection to me, but I was unaware of what that connection was exactly.
:{{DIcon}} Is there anyone who can answer those questions?
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 26.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Perhaps the elemental dragons of other nations may have some form of an answer. However, they are scattered across all of Teyvat. Abruptly visiting could very well pose an unpredictable risk.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' True... Some of them have very... unique personalities too.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 27.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I have been holding on to these unanswered questions for a long time...
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 28.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' But there's one thing I've discovered along the way: My emotions easily resonate with those of others... even I don't have the slightest idea what they mean.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 29.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' My guess would be that there are at least some similarities between humans and myself. By observing their behavior, perhaps I could one day understand the meaning of my existence.
:{{DIcon}} I see.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 24.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Have you made any progress then?
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 30.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Perhaps, but I find such progress difficult to describe. As an outsider, chances to engage in meaningful interactions with others are few and far between.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 31.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' That's why I'm quite thankful for this chat &mdash; such opportunities are rare. Alas, time is limited. We should move on with our investigation.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 25.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are we gonna continue reading these documents? Ugh, Paimon's getting dizzy already.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 32.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I wasn't able to find any leads even after browsing through most of the documents, but while we were on the topic of "water" a moment ago, another idea came to me.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 26.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Water? Do you mean...
:{{DIcon}} The Fountain of Lucine?
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 33.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' That's right.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 34.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' The Fountain of Lucine is where all of Fontaine's waters converge. It is the vessel of countless memories and emotions.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 35.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' If there really were an organization attempting to use Melusines against me, they should also hold an intense resentment towards me.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 36.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Perhaps we'll be able to find some new leads by sensing the Hydro element within the fountain.
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 paimon 27.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh. Why didn't Paimon think of that? C'mon, let's go take a look!
:{{A|vo sllq001 23 neuvillette 37.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Perhaps we should go, there shouldn't be too many people near the Fountain of Lucine during the evening.
