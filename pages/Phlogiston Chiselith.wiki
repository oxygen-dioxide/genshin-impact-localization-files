'''Phlogiston Chiseliths''' are an exploration mechanic in [[Natlan]]. They can be infused with [[Phlogiston]] to activate or spawn other mechanisms, such as [[Solid Phlogiston]] platforms or [[chest]]s.

==Gameplay Notes==
* Phlogiston Chiseliths have 3 levels of infusion, and most are found with 1-2 levels already filled.
* Filling one level costs '''25''' Phlogiston, or '''1/4''' of the player's Phlogiston meter.
* Duration of ignition varies; some stay activated for <30 seconds, while others seem to last indefinitely.
* Most Phlogiston Chiseliths are associated with quests or puzzles; very few can be activated repeatedly.

==Lore==
Phlogiston Chiseliths are similar to [[Phlogiston Engraving]]s and are based on [[Iridescent Inscription]]s.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Seeker No Finding}}</ref>
