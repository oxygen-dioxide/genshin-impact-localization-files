'''Aria''', '''Sonnet''', and '''Canon''',<ref name="HD3">{{Ref/Book|Heart's Desire: Sapphire|3}}</ref> collectively known as the '''three sisters'''<ref name="MBF3">{{Ref/Book|Moonlit Bamboo Forest|3}}</ref><ref name="Moonpiercer">{{Ref/Weapon|Moonpiercer}}</ref> or the '''moon sisters''' ''(unofficial name)'', are three ancient goddesses<ref name="Nilotpala">{{Ref/Item|Nilotpala Lotus|note=Archive description}}</ref> who, according to [[Teyvat]] mythos, served as Teyvat's three moons. They are also called the '''Iridescent Moon''', the '''Eternal Moon''', and the '''Frost Moon''',<ref name=":1">[[Song of the Welkin Moon]]</ref> although the correlation between which title and which sister name is still unknown. 

Following a certain great calamity, two of the sisters died,<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Moonpiercer|quote=Ultimately, two moon-wheels shattered into dust and disappeared.}}</ref> and the corpse of only one of the sisters continues to illuminate the night sky.<ref name="MBF3" />

{{Quote|Just as legends claim that [...] once there were three bright moons in the night sky named Aria, Sonnet and Canon, sisters who were parted by death in a great catastrophe.|[[Heart's Desire: Sapphire]]}}
The three sisters are mythical figures in Teyvat legends who have been mentioned in books and legends from &mdash; and in item descriptions related to &mdash; [[Mondstadt]], [[Liyue]], and [[Sumeru]]. However, very little of their mythos can be confirmed, leaving their significance and role in Teyvat a mystery.

Most tales involving them agree that the three sisters lived in the Lunar Palace<ref name=":0" /> and switched places in riding their silver carriage<ref name="MBF3" /> (or chariot)<ref name="Nilotpala" /> at regular intervals. The three sisters were close with each other and were also in love with the "stars of daybreak,"<ref name="MBF3" /> but met their end as a result of a great calamity.<ref name="HD3" /> Stories differ, or do not address, why the sisters died or how many of them died.

==Story==
{{Quote|The trinity of moon goddesses, who once steered the primordial celestial sphere and wove love and passion into the very heart of the world, have long since faded into the shadows of time.
Yet those who follow the tides still sing and pray, for a new moon is set to rise...|[[Song of the Welkin Moon]]}}

According to legend, the moon sisters are older than [[Rex Lapis]],<ref name="MBF3" /><ref name="VH-SR">{{Ref/Arti|Solar Relic}}</ref> who himself is over 6,000 years old.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Solitary Fragrance}}</ref> They were the sovereigns of the night sky who dwelled in the Lunar Palace and rode through the heavens in a silver carriage. Sovereignty was held by one sister at a time, switching places three times a month.<ref group="Note">Instead of saying that the sisters alternated "thrice a month," the original Chinese text says they alternated after {{Lang|"one ''xún''"|zh=一旬}}, where a ''xún'' can mean ten days, ten years, or an unspecified amount of time. The English localization assumed ten days, as thirty days roughly comprises one {{w|lunar month}}.</ref> The three sisters were all in love with the morning stars, and it is said that their love for the morning stars was "equal" to the affection between the sisters.<ref name="MBF3" />

===The Ancient Calamity===
At some point, the Lunar Palace was home to the union of the [[First Angel]] and a [[voyager]] from beyond Teyvat, with the moon sisters as witnesses. Thirty days later, the calamity that overturned the heavens and earth descended on the world. The lovers went on a self-imposed exile and attempted to flee, but the disaster caught up to them. As punishment, the two were separated for eternity and had their memories wiped. The heartbroken Seelie withered away, shedding parts of their former selves which then transformed into the Seelie's current wispy forms.<ref name=":0">{{Ref/Book|Records of Jueyun|4|title=Mountain Spirit}}</ref>

Meanwhile, the great disaster overturned the sisters' carriage and ransacked the palace of the stars. According to one tale, the moon sisters turned on each other and killed each other, although other similar legends do not include this detail. Two sisters died, and one of their corpses became the moon in Teyvat's night sky.<ref name="MBF3" /> Around the same time as their deaths, the [[Solar Chariot|sun chariot]] piloted by the morning stars fell into the plains west of Liyue, creating [[The Chasm (Subregion)|The Chasm]] and [[Dunyu Ruins]].<ref name="VH-SR" /><ref name="RoJ6">{{Ref/Book|Records of Jueyun|6|title=Hidden Jade}}</ref>

According to another legend, two sisters died: the Eternal Moon "fell," and "threw heaven and earth into chaos"; and the Iridescent Moon "shattered," and the "crimson shadow sank into the abyssal sea." After, the third sister, the Frost Moon, "ceased to turn," and "nations faltered and fell to ruin."<ref name=":1" /> 

It is heavily implied that this disaster is related to [[Nibelung]]'s great war of vengeance against the [[Heavenly Principles]],<ref>{{Ref/Quest|What Shape Does the Self Hold}}</ref> which was the same conflict which caused the Seelie to be cursed and exiled.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Amethyst Crown}}</ref>

===Legacy===
Following her sisters' deaths, the last sister was so overcome with sorrow that she never left her palace again.<ref name="Moonpiercer" /> 

The morning stars survived the calamities, as did the wolves, who are said to be "children of the moons." The wolves remember the tragedy behind the sisters' tale, and those who live among wolves call the morning stars the "grievous stars." Gods and [[adepti]] that heard the story of the moon sisters would "feel sentimental upon hearing such ancient memories."<ref name="MBF3" />

[[Song of the Welkin Moon]] says that from the remains of the three moon sisters, a "New Moon" rises, "spinning the wheel of fate anew."

[[Nilotpala Lotus]]es are said to be related to the three sisters, hence why they bloom during nighttime.<ref name="Moonpiercer" /><ref name="Nilotpala" />

The concept of the moon(s) recurs throughout [[Teyvat]] lore and shows up both in-universe and in gameplay elements. For example, the names "Mondstadt" and "Liyue" both make reference to the word ''moon'' via ''Mond'' and ''Yue'', respectively. According to folk legends, the [[Solar Chariot]] that fell into [[The Chasm (Subregion)|The Chasm]] was repaired by the tribespeople who lived there and eventually returned to the heavens;<ref name="VH-SR" /> in other renditions of the tale, the sun chariot was a star which "leaped away" and returned to the heavens during the time "countless gods and rulers fought over the appointed celestial seats."<ref name="RoJ6" />

During the Abyssal invasion of Natlan, [[Mavuika]] channeled power from the six modern incarnations of the heroes who fought with her during the cataclysm along with [[Ronova]]'s power to destroy the rift that was responsible for the invasion. The sheer strength of her strike was potent enough to break through Teyvat's skies, revealing that Teyvat's [[False Sky|skies were false]] along with a shattered moon. However, most of the people paid little heed to it, though Mavuika later disclosed to the Traveler that it was worth investigating, as they had not been observed in any other nation and guessed that the Heavenly Principles wished to keep the matter secret. She hoped that they would not cause her too much trouble over it, and she would simply tell the masses that it was just an "astronomical anomaly."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Fuel Named "Fate"}}</ref>

The [[Spiral Abyss]], a massive underground city built by a ruined civilization, has several deep connections with the moon(s): Within it is a structure known as the Abyssal Moon Spire, in which the moon is clearly visible. The lunar phase within the city shifts twice a month in a phenomenon known as the Moment of Syzygy, which brings new rewards with it, and this change in lunar phase has been referred to as "gears turn[ing]."<ref>Official Description: [[Spiral Abyss#Descriptions|Moment of Syzygy]]</ref> Notably, the moon above Teyvat and the one within the Spiral Abyss are distinct, perhaps suggesting that while one sister's corpse ended up in Teyvat, the other sister's corpse ended up in the Spiral Abyss.

== Trivia==
*The concept of the {{w|triple goddess}} is common in real-life mythology and may be the inspiration behind the moon sisters.
*The English localization of ''Moonlit Bamboo Forest (III)'' states that disaster would befall the world if the three sisters failed to switch places in time. This is a major misinterpretation of the original Chinese text, which says that they continued switching places up until the great disaster descended. (See [[Moonlit Bamboo Forest#Notes|Moonlit Bamboo Forest § Notes]] for details.)
**Another notable translation liberty occurs later, with ''"But this was all before the world was smashed against the tides of great calamity."'' The original Chinese text says {{zh|那是颠覆天地的大灾降临之前的事情了|tl=''Of course, this was before the disaster that toppled heaven and earth descended.''}}
*The figure depicted in the [[Blessing of the Welkin Moon]] card may relate to the moon sisters. It features an unidentified white-haired, purple-robed feminine figure surrounded by [[Primogem]]s, with an upright [[triquetra]] underneath and a waning crescent moon behind her. The word "welkin" means "sky" or "heaven," making the name of this moon the "Heavenly Moon."

===Etymology===
*The moon sisters' names are related to music and poetry:
**An {{w|aria}} is a musical composition for a single singer, with or without musical accompaniment. It is most often used in operas.
**A {{w|sonnet}} is a type of poetic form closely associated with love poems. It is derived from the Italian word ''sonetto'', meaning "little song."
** A {{w|canon (music)|canon}} is a compositional form in which the melody is repeated by an imitation after a given duration.
**Both the Chinese and Japanese language patches render Sonnet as "Sonata". This may have been an oversight in localization, as a {{w|sonata}} is a form of musical piece much like an aria and a canon, as opposed to a sonnet, which is a form of poetry.
* In astronomy, "{{w|Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy}}" is the configuration of three celestial bodies in a straight line. One commonly-known type of syzygy is an {{w|eclipse}}.
** In the Valentinianism system of Gnosticism, "syzygy" refers to the duo male and female emanations of {{w|Aeon (Gnosticism)|God}}.
