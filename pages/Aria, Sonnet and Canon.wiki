'''Aria''', '''Sonnet''', and '''Canon''',<ref name="HD3">{{Ref/Book|Heart's Desire: Sapphire|3}}</ref> collectively known as the '''moon sisters''', are one of the oldest known beings in [[Teyvat]] mythos alongside the ancient [[Seelie]]. They dwelled in the Lunar Palace and switched sovereignty over the night sky at regular intervals. Following a certain great calamity, the three sisters ended up clashing and killing each other; only one of their corpses continues to illuminate the sky.<ref name="MBF3">{{Ref/Book|Moonlit Bamboo Forest|3}}</ref>

{{Quote|Just as legends claim that [...] once there were three bright moons in the night sky named Aria, Sonnet and Canon, sisters who were parted by death in a great catastrophe.|[[Heart's Desire: Sapphire]]}}

==Story==
According to legend, the moon sisters are older than [[Morax]],<ref name="MBF3" /><ref name="VH-SR">{{Ref/Arti|Solar Relic}}</ref> who himself is over 6,000 years old.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Solitary Fragrance}}</ref> They were the sovereigns of the night sky who dwelled in the Lunar Palace and rode through the heavens in a silver carriage. Sovereignty was held by one sister at a time, switching places three times a month.<ref group="Note">Instead of saying that the sisters alternated "thrice a month," the original Chinese text says they alternated after {{lang|"one ''xún''"|zh=一旬}}, where a ''xún'' can mean ten days, ten years, or an unspecified amount of time. The English localization assumed ten days, as thirty days roughly comprises one {{w|lunar month}}.</ref> The three sisters were all in love with the morning stars, and it is said that their love for the morning stars was "equal" to the affection between the sisters.<ref name="MBF3" />

===The Ancient Calamity===
At some point, the Lunar Palace was host to the union of a [[Seelie]] ancestor and an outlander, with the moon sisters as witnesses. Thirty days later, the calamity that overturned the heavens and earth descended on the world: the lovers went on a self-imposed exile and attempted to flee, but the disaster caught up to them. As punishment, the two were separated for eternity and had their memories wiped. The heartbroken Seelie withered away, shedding parts of their former selves which then transformed into the Seelie's current wispy forms.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Records of Jueyun|4|title=Mountain Spirit}}</ref>

The great disaster overturned the sisters' carriage and ransacked the palace of the stars. The moon sisters turned on each other, ultimately ending with their mutual deaths. The moon in the Teyvat night sky is said to be one of their corpses.<ref name="MBF3" /> Around the same time as their deaths, the sun chariot piloted by the morning stars fell into the plains west of Liyue, creating [[The Chasm]] and [[Dunyu Ruins]].<ref name="VH-SR" /><ref name="RoJ6">{{Ref/Book|Records of Jueyun|6|title=Hidden Jade}}</ref>

===Legacy===
The morning stars survived the calamities, as did the wolves, who are said to be "children of the moons." The wolves remember the tragedy behind the sisters' tale, and those who live among wolves call the morning stars the "grievous stars." Gods and [[adepti]] that heard the story of the moon sisters would "feel sentimental upon hearing such ancient memories."<ref name="MBF3" />

The concept of the moon(s) recurs throughout [[Teyvat]] lore and shows up both in-universe and in gameplay elements. For example, the names "[[Mondstadt]]" and "[[Liyue]]" both make reference to the word ''moon'' via ''Mond'' and ''Yue'', respectively. According to folk legends, the sun chariot that fell into The Chasm was repaired by the tribespeople who lived there and eventually returned to the heavens;<ref name="VH-SR" /> in other renditions of the tale, the sun chariot was a star which "leaped away" and returned to the heavens during the time "countless gods and rulers fought over the appointed celestial seats."<ref name="RoJ6" />

The [[Spiral Abyss]] is a massive underground city built by a ruined civilization. It has several deep connections with the moon: Within it is a structure known as the Abyssal Moon Spire, in which the moon is clearly the visible. The lunar phase within the city shifts twice a month in a phenomenon known as the Moment of Syzygy, which brings new rewards with it. The change in lunar phase has been referred to as "gears turn[ing]."<ref>{Official Description: [[Spiral Abyss#Official Description|Moment of Syzygy]]</ref> It should also be noted the moon above Teyvat at that within the abyss are clearly distinct perhaps indicating they are the corpses of two distinct moon goddesses.

The [[Blessing of the Welkin Moon]] is a gameplay feature that features a card of an unidentified white-haired, purple-robed feminine figure surrounded by [[Primogem]]s, with an upright [[triquetra]] underneath and a waning crescent moon behind her. Notably, the word "welkin" means "sky" or "heaven," making the name of this moon the Heavenly Moon.

==Trivia==
*The English localization of ''Moonlit Bamboo Forest (III)'' states that disaster would befall the world if the three sisters failed to switch places in time. This is a major misinterpretation of the original Chinese text, which says that they continued switching places up until the great disaster descended. (See [[Moonlit Bamboo Forest#Notes|Moonlit Bamboo Forest § Notes]] for details.)
**Another notable translation liberty occurs later, with ''"But this was all before the world was smashed against the tides of great calamity."'' The original Chinese text says {{lang|mini=1|zh=那是颠覆天地的大灾降临之前的事情了|zh_tl=''Of course, this was before the disaster that toppled heaven and earth descended.''}}
*The concept of the {{w|triple goddess}} is common in real-life mythology and may be the inspiration behind the moon sisters.
*Because the [[Seven Sovereigns]], [[Primordial One]], and [[Second Who Came]] are not mentioned in Teyvat legends, there is no confirmation on when the moon sisters' fall &mdash; assuming they were real historical figures and not fictionalized accounts &mdash; occurred relative to the world's overall history based Enkanomiya's records in ''[[Before Sun and Moon]]''. It is worth mentioning, however, that both "The Funerary Year" section in ''Before Sun and Moon'' and ''Moonlit Bamboo Forest (III)'' describe their respective catastrophes as ones that toppled heaven and earth.

===Etymology===
*The moon sisters' names are related to music and poetry:
**An {{w|aria}} is a musical composition for a single singer, with or without musical accompaniment. It is most often used in operas.
**A {{w|sonnet}} is a type of poetic form closely associated with love poems. It is derived from the Italian word ''sonetto'', meaning "little song."
**A {{w|canon (music)|canon}} is a compositional form in which the melody is repeated by an imitation after a given duration.
* In astronomy, "{{w|Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy}}" is the configuration of three celestial bodies in a straight line. One commonly-known type of syzygy is an {{w|eclipse}}.
** In the Valentinianism system of Gnosticism, "syzygy" refers to the duo male and female emanations of {{w|Aeon (Gnosticism)|God}}.
