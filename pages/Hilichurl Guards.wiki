'''Hilichurl Guards''' are [[Hilichurls]] that are armed with a club and shield.

While the clubs look affiliated with their respective element, they only deal {{Color|Physical DMG}}. They can use their shields to protect themselves from frontal attacks, although attacks with sufficient force can still bypass them, unlike [[Mitachurls|shield-using Mitachurls]]. The shield can be destroyed, with some attacks being more effective than others. In the event that the shield is destroyed, they function identically as [[Hilichurl Fighter]]s.
