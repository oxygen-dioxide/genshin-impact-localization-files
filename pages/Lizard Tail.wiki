'''Lizard Tails''' can be obtained by picking up [[Lizards]].

==How to Obtain==
Lizard Tails can be generated by whacking bushes with a melee weapon.

Since lizards run fast and disappear quickly, make sure to run after them after spotting. They may be hard to farm since they do not spawn in bulk (typically one or two at a time).

Lizards have been seen more frequently in some places such as the grassy fields between the abandoned fishing village due west of the [[Wangshu Inn]] and the rocky arch nearby.

Killed lizards do not drop any items.
