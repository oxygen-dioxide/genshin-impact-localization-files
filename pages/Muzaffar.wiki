'''Muzaffar''' was a historical figure in the [[Great Red Sand]], [[Sumeru]] who lived thousands of years ago and after being one of the Deys of Orghana pillaged several city-states that existed in the desert.

==Story==
Muzaffar was one of the Twenty-Nine Deys of Orghana (the city now known as [[Port Ormos]]). 

King [[Saleb Dowleh]], originally known as Goudarz, was somehow involved with [[Tulaytullah]] before his rise as king, although he later left the city to take up residence in [[Gurabad]]. Saleb Dowleh made an alliance with the port city of Orghana,<ref>Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, [[Primal Obelisk#Mausoleum of King Deshret, East|Mausoleum of King Deshret, East]]</ref> although Muzaffar would later turn his back on both sides, killing Saleb Dowleh and his entire bloodline and deciding to permanently reside in the desert instead of returning to Orghana.<ref name="Underground">Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, [[Primal Obelisk#Mausoleum of King Deshret, East (Underground)|Mausoleum of King Deshret, East (Underground)]]</ref> His conquest of the Great Red Sand was full of pillaging and bloodshed. According to a [[Primal Obelisk]] "...He took the famed city [[Beit Raha]] and tore down its walls and towers... presented the head of Nasrul, the master of the city, before his brothers and comrades. They made mockery of it, and their joy was equal in greatness to its stench."<ref name="north">Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, [[Primal Obelisk#Mausoleum of King Deshret, North|Mausoleum of King Deshret, North]]</ref>

His son [[Zumurud]] became known as the Verdant Lord.
