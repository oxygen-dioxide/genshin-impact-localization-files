==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Chloris:''' Wow! I haven't had any faunal contact in ages!
:{{DIcon|Shop}} Can you sell me some plants?
::'''Chloris:''' Of course. Unlike Flora's flower shop, we sell all plants here. We do not discriminate.
:{{DIcon}} ...Faunal contact?
::'''Chloris:''' My name's Chloris! I'm the best botanist in Mondstadt.
::'''Chloris:''' I spend all my days out in the wild, among the flora. Fauna, on the other hand, are somewhat lacking in my life.
::'''Chloris:''' So you can always feel free to talk to me. I'd appreciate the company!
::{{DIcon}} What about your family?
:::'''Chloris:''' You might know my little sister, Flora?
:::'''Chloris:''' All she cares about is flowers. She runs a flower shop in the city.
:::'''Chloris:''' I'm much more open-minded than she is. I care about all plants, especially strange new ones!
:::'''Chloris:''' I guess I am the older one, after all. I do think Flora really could do better if she pushed herself...
::{{DIcon}} Sorry to disturb you.
:::'''Chloris:''' Hey! You're just saying that to make me feel bad. You're awful!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Chloris:''' Wha&mdash; You're leaving already?
