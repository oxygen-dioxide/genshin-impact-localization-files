'''Clymene''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] located in [[Enkanomiya]] who appears in the [[World Quest]] ''[[The Phaethons' Syrtos]]''.

==Profile==
Clymene was a female official in charge of taking care of the [[Sunchildren]]'s daily lives within the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]]. In order to fulfill this duty, she was forbidden from marrying and having children. Because of this, she eventually began to see the Sunchildren as her own, and they confided their fears and worries to her. She was particularly close with [[Piramumon]] and [[Orupeusu]], whom she personally raised. However, she was forbidden from speaking to the Sunchildren and was under heavy surveillance by the corrupt politicians who used the Sunchildren as puppet rulers. Unable to gather the courage to disobey her orders, Clymene could only watch the Sunchildren go to their tragic deaths via immolation in the Dainichi Mikoshi, reviled by the rest of Enkanomiya as puppet rulers who did nothing to help the people.

Clymene's regrets were preserved in the form of a [[Shades of Tokoyo|Shade of Tokoyo]]. During ''[[The Phaethons' Syrtos]]'', she requests that the [[Traveler]] help her pay respects to the Sunchildren by visiting their tombs and leaving them offerings of [[Sango Pearl]]s. After the task is completed, Clymene asks that the Traveler bear witness to the Sunchildren being laid to rest. She opens up the Soul Guide's Locus &mdash; the resting place of the remnants of the Sunchildren's souls &mdash; to use her memories to supplement what remains of their souls and lay them to rest. However, she is unable to call forth the Sunchildren, as her memories alone were insufficient to summon them. Clymene requests that the Traveler find the [[Divine Bridle]], the badge of the Sunchild's office, which she hopes would be a sufficient medium to summon the Sunchildren. After the Traveler gives them the Divine Bridle, Clymene manages to summon the Sunchildren and lay them to rest, finally fulfilling her greatest wish of atoning for her sins of being unable to save the Sunchildren. Soon thereafter, she fades away.

In the following Hidden Exploration Objective ''[[Sunchildren Hide and Seek]]'', Orupeusu alludes to Clymene when he talks about his promise to never sing until he heard her voice.
