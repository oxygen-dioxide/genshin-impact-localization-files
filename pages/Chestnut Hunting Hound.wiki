|description = Humanity's best friend!<br>This canine breed sports three-colored fur, a result of many bloodlines mixing. Specimens of this species are strong and more intelligent than most, and thus are often kept as pets or work dogs.<br>It is said, however, that Chestnut Hunting Hounds will show a lazier, more gluttonous side to themselves when not given orders by their master. Most notably, they never refuse offers of food, resulting in upset stomachs and owners alike.
