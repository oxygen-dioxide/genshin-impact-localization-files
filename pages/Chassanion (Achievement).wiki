'''''Chassanion''''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Wonders of the World]]''. To complete this achievement, the player must defeat the [[Local Legend]] {{Enemy|Hat Jellyfish|text=Chassanion &mdash; Trick Bullet.}}

==Gameplay Notes==
* Chassanion can be found underwater beneath the [[Sealed Ruin Tower]] in [[Morte Region]].
* If the tower has sunken under water due to quest progression, Chassanion will now be found ''inside'' the lower level of the tower, which is accessed via a teleporter on the same outside tower level as four [[Underwater Patrol Mek]]s. After entering, swim down another level to encounter it.
