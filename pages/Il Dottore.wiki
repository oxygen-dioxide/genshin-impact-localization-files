'''Il Dottore''', also known by his codename "'''The Doctor''',"<ref name="lazzo video description 4" /> is one of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]].

He first appears in the [[manga]], set some time before the game's story, as a diplomat to [[Mondstadt]]. In present day, he makes an appearance during ''[https://youtu.be/TmaAOV4SJNQ Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo]'' alongside his fellow Harbingers.

==Profile==
===Personality===
{{Quote|He loves tinkering with old things, it's a... personal passion of his. So, he converted these old ruins into a [[Ruin Guard]] research lab. [...] I can only imagine that he's gotten bored of playing around with them, and has lost interest in this place.|[[Tartaglia]], about Dottore and his research lab in [[Liyue]]}}

Dottore is ruthless and has little regard for human life. His first appearance has him threaten [[Krupp]] with being an experiment subject for his repeated failure to get results, and he later makes good on that promise after Krupp is compromised by [[Diluc]] during a banquet. He also takes no interest in the death of two Fatui diplomats during the Black Fire incident, leaving [[Barnabas]] to resolve the issue for him.

Dottore is disdainful towards Vision-wielders, describing them as "self-inflated tools". He seems to be interested in the Abyss Order and frequently experiments on Ruin Guards, even turning his former subordinate Krupp into a Ruin Guard-like machine in the manga.

===Appearance===
Dottore is an adult man with red eyes, long and wavy blue hair and pale skin. Dottore also wears a glowing blue earring on his right ear, and a beak-shaped black mask that covers his eyes.

In the manga, Dottore shows short and curly hair, and wears a long white coat over a white dress shirt and a pink bow tie. Under this he wears a pinstriped vest and dark pants. He typically wears a black and white mask covering all of his face save his right cheek and half of his mouth. The Fatui symbol can be seen at the top left corner of this mask. Given his ability to create clones of himself, it is unknown whether the appearance shown in the manga is the original Dottore or one of his clones.

==Story==
===History===
Since his youth, Dottore had an obsession with creating "enhanced humans" that could surpass even the gods. It is presumably this ambition which got him chased out of his hometown and accused of being a "monster" and a "madman" after he was admitted into [[Sumeru Akademiya]]. Despite being rejected by his peers and teachers, Dottore made an effort to not get expelled as he needed "an environment conducive to research."<ref name="PF" />

While at the Akademiya, Dottore was approached by [[Pierro]], who invited him to become part of the Fatui with the promise of resources for his research. He agreed, and was given the title of Il Dottore, or The Doctor &mdash; which he found humorously ironic.<ref name="PF" />

At some point after [[Diluc]]'s departure from Mondstadt and before the events of the manga's main story, Dottore single-handedly defeated [[Ursa the Drake]] and made Mondstadt indebted to the Fatui.<ref name="M1">{{Ref/Manga|1}}</ref> Dottore began recruiting vulnerable targets in Mondstadt, luring them to the Fatui only to use them as test subject for his and his subordinates' human experiments. He also began setting up an unknown project in Mondstadt, which he intended to check up on while attending [[Ludi Harpastum]]. It is unclear whether Dottore had a hand in the events surrounding Diluc's 18th birthday, such as giving Crepus a [[Delusion]], luring Ursa the Drake to attack Crepus and Diluc's caravan, or being involved with the [[Knights of Favonius]] traitor [[Eroch]].

After [[Scaramouche]] joined the Fatui, someone modified him to have abilities beyond what [[Ei]] had originally given him.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Wishes (Quest)}}</ref> Dottore may be the "certain researcher" whom Scaramouche imitates when explaining his motivations for masterminding the downfall of the [[Raiden Gokaden]].<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Calabash of Awakening}}</ref>

===Manga===
Dottore first appears in [[Haeresys]], a Fatui underground arena where [[Krupp]] is putting his test subjects into fights against an unknown enemy. After his 139th subject dies, Dottore calls his work "pathetic as usual" and threatens to turn Krupp into one of ''his'' test subjects instead. Krupp, desperate to avoid that fate, turns his attention to Mondstadt's invitation to attend [[Ludi Harpastum]].<ref name="M1" />

The two arrive at Diluc's Manor, where Diluc and other prestigious members of Mondstadt high society have gathered. Dottore leaves most of the talk to Krupp, only speaking to express his disdain for the people of Mondstadt. He stalks off after Diluc delays the negotiations, but returns to silence Krupp when the "Darknight Hero" (a disguised Diluc) is about to interrogate him. Bemused by the boy's abilities, Dottore leaves, telling him to get stronger.<ref name="M1" />

No longer interested in Mondstadt, he drops the negotiations, orders his diplomats to withdraw, and returns to Haeresys first.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|2}}</ref> He does, however, reclaim Krupp's corpse to transform him into a [[Ruin Hunter]]-like monster. After learning of the Black Fire incident instigated by [[Collei]], which left two of his diplomats dead, he expresses complete apathy towards the matter and leaves it to his subordinate [[Barnabas]].<ref>{{Ref/Manga|9}}</ref>

He reappears in Chapter 16, where he expresses annoyance that the guards were incompetent enough to let the captured "Darknight Hero" escape, while Barnabas was severely wounded in the aftermath of his attack on Collei and [[Amber]].

===In-Game===
At some point before ''[[Mighty Cyclops' Adventure!]]'', the Fatui built a [[Ruin Guard]] manufacturing facility as part of their research into the [[Abyss]]. [[Tartaglia]] believes that this facility belonged to Dottore, and the whimsical researcher abandoned the autonomous facility after growing bored with it without shutting it down. This resulted in the manufactured Ruin Guards spreading into the surrounding area, attracting the attention of the [[Millelith]]. Towards the end of the Chapter, Tartaglia took his younger brother [[Teucer]] there, claiming it was the "Liyue Institute for Toy Research." Over the course of exploring the factory, Tartaglia and the [[Traveler]] end up wrecking the facility to keep Teucer safe.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Defender of Childhood Dreams}}</ref>

One of Dottore's Segments appears at [[La Signora]]'s funeral, where [[Il Capitano]] presses him on the whereabouts of Scaramouche and the [[Inazuma]] [[Gnosis]]. Dottore's roundabout answer reveals he is waiting on Scaramouche to make a move first. Meanwhile, the Segment in the prime of Dottore's life is conducting an experiment into "heresy," which takes the form of burning a massive tree at an unknown location.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/TmaAOV4SJNQ Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo]</ref>

==Powers and Abilities==
Little is known about Dottore's powers as a Harbinger, but he is capable of turning people into monsters even after the person has died. He is also shown in the manga to wield twin floating, pointed, metal objects that can shoot projectiles and shine bright blue light at their tips. Dottore appears to have a genius-level intellect as he is an expert in machinery as shown with his facility.

He is also capable of creating clones of himself at different ages, known as "segments," each of whom is assigned different tasks.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Tartaglia|About The Doctor}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* Like the other Harbingers, Dottore's alias is derived from a stock character in ''{{w|commedia dell'arte}}''. "{{w|Il Dottore}}" (The Doctor) is usually extremely rich and bombastic, loving the sound of his own voice. In ''commedia dell'arte'', he typically tries to interfere with the Innamorati (The Lovers). He is also closely linked to [[Pantalone]].
*The [[Fatui Skirmishers]] are likely the weaker products of an "Enhanced Human".
* The Chinese version of the manga misspelled "Do'''tt'''o'''r'''e" as "Do'''t'''o'''rr'''e,"<ref>Chinese Manga, Chapter 1: [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/manga/detail/191 添酒]</ref> a mistake that was carried over into earlier chapters of the English translation. The English version rectified this mistake in later chapters.
