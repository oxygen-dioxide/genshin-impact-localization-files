{{Elemental Reaction Intro|element1=Electro|element2=Pyro}}

The explosion causes significant [[knockback]]. Overloaded DMG is also considered a [[Blunt Attack]], and can therefore trigger [[Shatter]] and is more effective at damaging certain enemy [[shields]].

Overloaded does ''not'' apply Pyro to targets hit, and therefore cannot trigger further elemental reactions.
