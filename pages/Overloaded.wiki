{{Elemental Reaction Intro|element1=Electro|element2=Pyro}}

The explosion causes significant [[knockback]]. Overloaded DMG is also considered a [[Blunt Attack]], and can therefore trigger [[Shatter]] and is more effective at damaging certain enemy [[shields]].

Overloaded does ''not'' apply Pyro to targets hit, and therefore cannot trigger further elemental reactions.

{{Transformative Reaction Damage}}

Note that one target can only take '''1''' instance of Overloaded DMG every '''0.5''' seconds from the same attacker, as limited by the [[Damage Sequence]].<ref >KeqingMains Theorycrafting Library: [https://library.keqingmains.com/evidence/combat-mechanics/elemental-effects/transformative-reactions Transformative Reactions]</ref> Additionally, multiple Overloaded reactions triggered on the same target within '''0.1''' seconds can only produce DMG once, regardless of the source.
