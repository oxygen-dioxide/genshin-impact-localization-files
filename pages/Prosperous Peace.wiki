==Trivia==
* The following birthday mails included Prosperous Peace:
** [[Mail/I've Been Thinking... (2021-12-02)|Ganyu's 2021 Birthday Mail]] (1 Prosperous Peace)
*The dish itself is likely based on {{Lang|eight treasure rice|zh=八宝饭|zh_rm=bābǎofàn}}.
*The Chinese name {{Lang|Prosperous World, Utmost Peace|zh=盛世太平|zh_rm=Shèng Shì Tài Píng}} is a paraphrase of the traditional Chinese idiom {{Lang|"utmost peace, prosperous world"|zh=太平盛世|zh_rm=tài píng shèng shì}}, which dates back to a work by the writer {{w|Shen Defu}} (1578–1642) during the Ming dynasty.<ref>Baidu Encyclopedia: [https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%A4%AA%E5%B9%B3%E7%9B%9B%E4%B8%96/64440 太平盛世 （汉语成语）]</ref> Since the idiom has a Confucian connotation, the name is fitting for Ganyu, whose parent is a qilin, a sacred beast which symbolizes benevolence and peace in Confucianism.
*To celebrate [[Ganyu]]'s birthday, the Teyvat Food Notes released a [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/18990 real-life recipe] for both Prosperous Peace and the base dish, [[Universal Peace]].
