==Profile==
Almond is an elder of the [[Forest of Blessings]]. After [[Mini Durin|Durin]] devastated the lands of Simulanka, he went to [[Constellation Metropole]], where the [[Goddess of Prophecy]] told him that a destined Hero would descend upon the [[Cliff of Prophecy]]. Heeding her word, Almond waited and waited, even as he developed the Fading Disorder and forgot the reason.

When the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] arrive in Simulanka, Almond welcomes them and helps them get their bearings. He believes the Traveler to be the prophesized Hero and connects them with [[Nilou]], who is apparently also part of the prophecy.

After the Traveler, Paimon, and Nilou help restore the [[Calligraphy Tavern]] and cure the Fading Disorder, Almond expresses his deep gratitude and tells them that he considers them heroes, prophesized or not. He arranges for a ride to their next destination and sends them off with well wishes.

After [[Padisarah (NPC)|Padisarah]] is "born," Almond takes her in and becomes her Grandpa.

===Appearance===
Almond is an origami hamster with a light purple body, a white face and belly, and orange ears with blue insides. His belly bears a pawprint-shaped mark, and he wears a blue neck scarf decorated with a swirl pattern and a yellow flower.
