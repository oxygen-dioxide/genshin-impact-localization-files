The '''4-Star Bane Series''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a 4-star [[Weapon Series]]. The [[weapons]] deal more damage to enemies affected by specific elements or of certain properties. This series has a [[3-Star Bane Series|3-star]] equivalent, where some weapons hold identical ability bonuses.

The weapons in this series do not share the same Base ATK nor are their main attributes the same.

Additionally, the combination of elements that apply the ability bonus vary.
