{{Quest Description|Patchi is near the Thousand Winds Temple, trying to find a way to enter...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Patchi)
:'''Patchi the Curious''': There's no such THING as a perfect plan when you're on an adventure! How are you going to make any progress at all if you keep deliberating like this?
:'''Doolan''': If the plan isn't perfect, then we need to be prepared for anything!
:{{DIcon}} What are you arguing about?
:'''Patchi the Curious''': I am a researcher of ancient ruins, and I wish to embark on a field trip to the Thousand Winds Temple. But I don't deal well with situations involving combat.
:'''Patchi the Curious''': Mr. Doolan here is an adventurer, and has taken it upon himself to make all the necessary arrangements for the temple investigation.
:'''Patchi the Curious''': Now, I do not mean to be critical of Doolan in any way, and I know that those Ruin Guards can be a real nuisance... but he insists on devising a fully comprehensive adventure plan down to the last detail, to which end he calls meeting after meeting...
:'''Patchi the Curious''': We've had research, investigation, and amendments, followed by supplementary research, further investigation, and round-two amendments... Ahh, I just can't take it anymore!
:'''Patchi the Curious''': Now he says he's found new evidence of monsters camping out next to the temple.
:'''Patchi the Curious''': I'm begging you, clear them out for me would you? Just to shut him up, even if it doesn't get us inside the temple...
:{{DIcon}} I think I understand what needs to happen...
:; (Dialogue ends)
:{{DIcon}} I'll happily take your place at Doolan's meetings.
::'''Patchi the Curious''': I appreciate the gesture, but take it from me...
::'''Patchi the Curious''': ...You'll find those monsters far less stressful to deal with than one of his meetings!

;(Talk to Patchi again)
:'''Patchi the Curious''': So, have you wiped out the monsters' camps?
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Not just yet...
:'''Patchi the Curious''': Please do it as soon as you can. Before Doolan finds yet another piece of evidence to pursue and ponder...
----
;(Talk to Patchi again)
:'''Patchi the Curious''': Have you wiped out the monsters' camps yet?
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Yes, they're all gone.
:'''Patchi the Curious''': Wonderful. I will speak with him at once about a proposed means of entry into the temple.
:'''Patchi the Curious''': He'll have no excuse to pull me into a meeting this time!
