'''The Wild Hunt''' is a term used to refer to the [[Abyss]] in [[Snezhnaya]].<ref>[[Song of the Welkin Moon]]</ref>

Since [[Nod-Krai]] was the first area to be effected by the [[cataclysm]] after [[Khaenri'ah]], the Abyssal forces that exist there are extraordinarily powerful; these forces gather to form an Abyssal calamity known as the "Wild Hunt".<ref>YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbDXwuUWxhY&ab_channel=GenshinImpact Behind the Scenes of Genshin Impact "Let's Start With Nod-Krai" | Genshin Impact #NodKrai]</ref>
