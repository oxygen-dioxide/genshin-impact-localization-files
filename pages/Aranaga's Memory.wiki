{{Quest Description|You meet an old man named Khayyam in the forest. He seems to share a past with Aranara. It should do no harm to respond to his request for help...}}
{{Dialogue start}}

:'''???:''' Haha, interesting... That's really curious. It's reviving, the forest is... reviving...
:'''Paimon:''' Hello, grandpa! Are you lost?
:'''???:''' Hmm...hmm? Rost...? Ah, are you talking to me? Haha, lost, is that what you said? No, no, I'm not lost...
:'''Khayyam:''' Good day, kids. I am Giyath Khayyam, an {{Rubi|Amurta|Biology}} Dastur, haha... Just call me Khayyam.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Hello, Mr. Khayyam!
:'''Khayyam:''' No... Follow me, lower the tip of your tongue, and arch the middle of it... Khaaa. After that, round your mouth... Yyaaa. Finally, close your lips naturally... Mmm.
:'''Paimon:''' Um... Khaaa... Yyaaa... Mmm...
:'''Khayyam:''' That's right! Well done! Now, golden one, repeat that.
:{{DIcon}} Khaaa... Yyaaa... Mmm...
::'''Khayyam:''' Haha, nice! You did much better than the white little thing! See? I said I could teach phonetics!
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here, Khayyam?
::'''Khayyam:''' Hmm... Your pronunciation was too fast, too rapid. But it's fine... Slowing it down would be all you need.
:'''Paimon:''' So, Mr. Khayyam... If you're not lost, what are you doing here?
:'''Khayyam:''' What am I doing? Hehe... I am a forest researcher. For us, the forest is our hometown. How could I be lost in my hometown, where I finally returned?
:'''Paimon:''' Oh...
:'''Khayyam:''' The forest was once deeply troubled by The Withering. In the past three decades, the plants were quickly decreasing in species and numbers, while the malicious Shroom-Kin kept growing...
:'''Khayyam:''' However, The Withering nearby disappeared lately. The plants that were once gone started growing again, and the reproduction of Shroom-Kin was somehow restrained.
:'''Khayyam:''' I haven't seen anything like this since 60 years ago... So I came here for the purpose of validating my amateur guess.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon sees...
:{{DIcon}} About validating your guess...
::'''Khayyam:''' Haha, that happened 60 years ago... Lower your expectations, an old man like me might not remember it well. But I am convinced that the disappearance of The Withering is related to that specific matter...
::'''Khayyam:''' Therefore, I am entering this cave to collect some samples to prove my guess.
:{{DIcon}} Do you need our help?
::'''Khayyam:''' Haha... Many thanks to you, my helpful children. I am physically old, but still mentally capable. Don't underestimate me.
::'''Khayyam:''' After all, I know how to please the forest, so that it won't hurt me.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon gets it... But it's still dangerous there, even without any Marana in the cave.
:'''Khayyam:''' Haha, that is nothing for me...
:'''Khayyam:''' Hmm, wait... What did you just say? What was that in the cave?
:{{DIcon}} Marana?
:{{DIcon}} The Withering?
:'''Khayyam:''' Hmm... On second thought, maybe I do need your help.
:'''Paimon:''' Mmhmm, Paimon told you so!
:'''Khayyam:''' Hehe, please pardon me... But I haven't asked for your names.
:{{DIcon}} Just call me (Traveler).
:'''Paimon:''' And Paimon's Paimon! Paiii...monnn...!
:'''Khayyam:''' Paimon? Paimon... Haha, that's an interesting name... You are the first human... Or fairy I know with the name.
:'''Khayyam:''' Oh, apologies, apologies. I did not mean to offend you... I meant this little thing.
:'''Paimon:''' Little thing! That's pretty offensive already!
:'''Khayyam:''' Well, guess that's all for the chit-chat. Please follow me, Javans, it's time to get moving.
:'''Paimon:''' "Javans"...? What does that mean?
:'''Khayyam:''' An ancient word in the dialect of my hometown, which means "brave young ones."
:'''Khayyam:''' More precisely, it means... "Young ones who never neglect gigantic evil, or ever back off from endless disparity."
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, that's pretty much us!
:'''Khayyam:''' Oh? You see yourselves like that? Haha, follow me then.
:'''Paimon:''' Ehh? Grandpa Khayyam, can you really keep up with us?
:'''Khayyam:''' Haha... I've been studying the forest for almost 30 years, so don't underestimate this old man's stamina! Just go on ahead, I'll catch up real soon.

;(Talk to Khayyam)
:'''Khayyam:''' I am focusing my investigation mainly on three sites. Haha, I hope my memories of 30 years ago haven't totally faded... I should be able to identify the locations.
:'''Khayyam:''' All in all, thanks for your companionship.
:'''Paimon:''' Don't mention it, Mr. Khayyam! That's what we Javans should do!

;(Investigate the north location)
:'''Khayyam:''' Ha! Here! Look at this!
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? New plant? Why are you so excited?
:'''Khayyam:''' No, not that, but even better! Look at it, our secret castle! Ha! What a mess it is now!
:'''Paimon:''' Eh...? "Secret castle"?
:'''Khayyam:''' Haha! Here returns Scholar Omar! He came with the celestial secrets! Irfan, [[Siman Farrokhzad|Siman]], where are you! Aren't you bidding a welcome to me?
:'''Paimon:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} ...
:'''Khayyam:''' Ah... Ahem, my apologies, children. I... I was carried away.
:'''Khayyam:''' Old age always does this to me, blurring the present, and endearing the past, more and more... Hehe...
:'''Khayyam:''' Irfan and Siman, they are friends of mine. We built the castle together, the three of us together.
:'''Khayyam:''' Back then, Irfan was the great musician, Siman was the supreme commander, and I was the astrology scholar. We switched our roles sometimes, you know... Children would play something different after getting bored.
:'''Khayyam:''' Irfan was talented in music; Siman was tall and strong, beyond comparison; and me? Haha, I was just an avid reader born in a family with a little extra Mora.
:{{DIcon}} Is this where you played house in childhood?
::'''Khayyam:''' No, this is our secret world &mdash; I'm serious about it. We made a promise together, saying that we will never forget each other, and will lead the Reconquest Army to take back the castle...
:{{DIcon}} Did you and your friends make all this...?
::'''Khayyam:''' No, not all of these. We promised that we will lead the Reconquest Army to take back the castle... Hehe.
::'''Khayyam:''' I grew up to be a botanical researcher in the Akademiya, and I happened to return here for some reconstruction. I visited multiple times, bringing and taking away plenty of rubbish here.
:'''Khayyam:''' Hehe, 20 years have passed, and they might have forgotten our promise... It became my own research campsite in the forest, which was kept in operation till 30 years ago.
:'''Khayyam:''' After that, even Marana had come, but the Reconquest Army never showed up. Hehe, that's understandable... How could those childish promises stand up against death itself?
:'''Paimon:''' But... Since you still remember them, they must be doing the same! Please don't lose your heart, Mr. Khayyam!
:'''Khayyam:''' Lose heart? No way. The childhood memories, shared "imaginary friends," and the world closed to adults. It may be a pity, but... Time won't reverse itself.
:'''Paimon:''' "Imaginary friends"... Do you mean Aranara?
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, shush!
:{{DIcon}} You talk too much, Paimon!
:'''Khayyam:''' ...
:'''Khayyam:''' Haha... I almost forgot, I asked you to help me sample these newly-grown plants, not for chit-chat.
:'''Khayyam:''' Please forgive this old man for talking too much nonsense. Let's continue.
;(Obtain [[Rose Sprout]] ×1)

;(Investigate the south location)
:'''Khayyam:''' Interesting... The plants here seem to be... reviving. So Mawtiyima is back in effect... Magical.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh... So Mr. Khayyam knows about Mawtiyima, too? Paimon thought only Aranara know that...
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, shush!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon...!
:'''Khayyam:''' Aranara, right? So you have also seen them...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh...? Um... Y&mdash;Yes.
:{{DIcon}} What's the matter, Mr. Khayyam?
:{{DIcon}} Have you seen Aranara, too?
:'''Khayyam:''' "Iram indeed is gone with all its Rose, and Jamshyd's Sev'n-ring'd Cup where no one Knows."
:'''Khayyam:''' We should proceed to the next site.
;(Obtain [[Rose Sprout]] ×1)

:'''Khayyam:''' Here, here it is! Let's collect the samples right here! Pick some, but be careful!

;(Talk to Khayyam)
:'''Khayyam:''' The plants here are growing pretty nicely...
:{{DIcon}} About the plants...
::'''Khayyam:''' I never thought soil that had been tainted by Marana could ever provide nourishment for plants again.
:{{DIcon}} About those "imaginary friends"...
::'''Khayyam:''' Dismissing the unique lifeforms that kids call Aranara as "imaginary friends" is undoubtedly incorrect.
::'''Khayyam:''' Since the Akademiya sensors couldn't detect them either, only young kids could prove that they exist.
::'''Khayyam:''' Hence, {{Rubi|Amurta|Biology}} has classified them as "unidentified lifeforms."

;(Investigate third location)
:'''Khayyam:''' Look, look here... The plants are thriving! It seems that the soil devastated by Marana could still nourish lively plants!
:'''Khayyam:''' Haha, Mawtiyima you old pal! Still active, aren't you?
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, Mr. Khayyam seems to get younger all of a sudden!
:{{DIcon}} And Paimon seems to know what to say all of a sudden!
::'''Paimon:''' Hey! What's that supposed to mean?
:{{DIcon}} Yay!
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon's not sure what you mean, but yay!
:'''Khayyam:''' Hmm... These should be enough. Thanks for coming all the way here with me. Since we have done everything planned, we should go now.
:'''Khayyam:''' Haha, this is excellent... These samples might really help my research on the secrets and weaknesses of The Withering...
:'''Khayyam:''' Thanks for your hard work, let us take the same route back... I have something for you.
:'''Paimon:''' Yay! Rewards!
:'''Khayyam:''' Hehe, it could be.

;(Talk to Khayyam)
:'''Khayyam:''' Thank you both, Javans. It must've been hard, traveling with this old man.
:'''Khayyam:''' Right, if you don't mind... This is hardly anything precious, but take it as a souvenir.
:'''Paimon:''' Wow... What is it? What is it?
:'''Khayyam:''' You should have seen it before, this little dried flower.
:'''Paimon:''' Ehhh!
:{{DIcon}} This is...
:{{DIcon}} Aranara...
:'''Khayyam:''' Yes. If I'm right... They must have gifted you the same thing, right?
:'''Khayyam:''' Hehe... I knew it, our encounter is by no means coincidental... I never believe in chances.
:'''Khayyam:''' I'm trusting this flower with you. Please, take it to our friends in common.
:'''Paimon:''' Sure, we can do that, but...
:{{DIcon}} They might have forgotten me.
::'''Khayyam:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} They might have forgotten you.
:'''Khayyam:''' I can't see them, either... I can't even believe in their existence. Maybe... they are just my childhood fantasies...
:'''Khayyam:''' But I am not giving up. Take this to them, children... Before the day you can never meet, before the possibility of a miracle fades.
;(Obtain [[Little Dried Flower]])

:'''Aranaga:''' Why come here, you two?
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa!! Y&mdash;You scared Paimon!
:'''Aranaga:''' Know my name, you two. But has never seen you here before, Aranaga.
:'''Aranaga:''' So... why come here?
:{{DIcon}} This is hard to explain...
::'''Paimon:''' Even if you have forgotten many things, you should know that we don't mean any harm! We're always on your side, and we'll always help Mawtiyima!
::'''Aranaga:''' Mawtiyima... You know?
:{{DIcon}} We're friends.
::'''Aranaga:''' Friends...?
:'''Aranaga:''' Hmph, don't look like bad guys, you.
:'''Aranaga:''' But please don't stay, here. Leave soon. Still recovering, the forest... So, no staying here, new guests.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, wait!
:{{DIcon}} We have something for you!
:'''Aranaga:''' Something, for me?
:'''Aranaga:''' Give me.
:{{DIcon}} Here.
:'''Aranaga:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' See? Remember? You gave us the same flower before!
:'''Aranaga:''' Really... are friends with me? Very important flower, why here, with you?
:{{DIcon}} Uh...
:{{DIcon}} It's a long story...

:'''You explain all the adventures in detail to Aranaga, as well as how you saved Mawtiyima from The Withering.'''

:'''Aranaga:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' What about that? Rings a bell?
:'''Aranaga:''' Don't understand, don't remember...
:'''Paimon:''' Whaaat!?
:{{DIcon}} *sigh*
:{{DIcon}} That's not unexpected...
:'''Aranaga:''' But, thank you. My garden, if remember. Please come.
:'''Aranaga:''' Very important flower, will plant, Aranaga.

:'''Aranaga leaves with the flower.'''

:'''Paimon:''' Aranaga just... left.
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, he left.
::'''Paimon:''' Well, Aranaga invited us to his garden, though... That means he didn't refuse to be friends with us, right? Let's pay him a visit sometime!
:{{DIcon}} But he invited us.
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm... That's right. Let's visit Aranaga sometime, shall we?

==Trivia==
* The poem Khayyam quotes is [https://rubaiyatdomarkhayyam.wordpress.com/2017/05/01/iram-is-gone-as-its-rose/ Quatrain 5] of the The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. The poem talks about how the wealthy and beautiful city of Iram is now gone, and the treasured seven ring cup of King Jamshyd, the mythical ruler of a Persian Golden Age, is now missing, but vines continue to bear fruit and flowers continue to blossom.
