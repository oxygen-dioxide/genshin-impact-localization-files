The {{Lang|'''adepti'''|zh=仙|zh_rm=Xiān}}, singular '''''adeptus''','' are a group in [[Liyue]] that consists of both [[illuminated beast]]s and [[gods]]. Most of them are bound by a contract to protect Liyue from demons and evil gods<ref name="YTGA">{{Ref/Book|Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti}}</ref> and are led by the Prime of Adepti, [[Morax|Rex Lapis]] himself.

==Terminology==
What exactly is defined by the term "adepti" is ambiguous, and is further obfuscated by the English localization's translation of several related but distinct terms interchangeably: {{zh|仙|rm=xiān}}, {{zh|仙人|rm=xiānrén}}, {{zh|仙兽|rm=xiānshòu}}, {{zh|仙众|rm=xiānzhòng}}, and {{zh|仙家|rm=xiānjiā}} are all translated as "adepti" or "illuminated beast." While the original Chinese text also does not clearly delineate the terms, there is more specificity in how they are used.

{{zh|'''仙'''|rm=xiān|tl=illuminated immortal,}} refers to the concept of {{w|Taoism|Daoist}} ''{{w|Xian (Taoism)|xian}}'', who are people or entities with either extreme longevity or immortality, typically as a result of spiritual enlightenment. The word can take on a variety of meanings depending on the context, but in the context of the adepti, it typically refers to beings who have reached enlightenment and spiritual immortality. In-game, within the context of Liyue, this term is used to broadly refer to all types of adepti.

{{zh|'''仙人'''|rm=xiānrén|tl=illuminated immortal person,}} comprises the characters {{zh|仙|tl=illuminated immortal}} + {{zh|人|tl=person, people, mortal(s)}}. In-game, this term is typically used for all ''xian'' who follow Morax, whether they take beastlike or humanlike forms. It is an abbreviation of {{Lang|"the Mighty and Illuminated Adepti"|zh=三眼五显仙人|zh_tl=Three Eyes, Five Manifestations Illuminated Immortal [Person]}}.<ref name="Xiao Vision">{{Ref/CS|Xiao|Vision}}</ref> The term does not specify singular or plural and can be used to refer to an individual adeptus or multiple adepti, although plural forms of the term exist as well (see ''xiānzhòng'').

{{zh|'''仙兽'''|rm=xiānshòu|tl=illuminated immortal beast,}} refers to animals and beasts who have or are capable of reaching enlightenment, such as the qilin. Those who are illuminated beasts and follow Morax can be referred to as both ''xianren'' and ''xianshou''.<br />In the original Chinese text, humans with illuminated beast blood in their veins typically refer to their ''xianshou'' lineage, and not a ''xianren'' lineage. There are a few exceptions; for example, when Ganyu talks about adeptus blood in ''[[Solitary Fragrance]]'', she uses ''xianren'' instead of ''xianshou''. Her [[Ganyu/Lore#Character Stories|character stories]] always use ''xianshou'', though the English version inconsistently translates it as both "adeptus" and "illuminated beast."

{{zh|'''仙众'''|rm=xiānzhòng|tl=illuminated immortal group,}} generally refers to a subset of adepti, or to the adepti as a collective.

{{zh|'''仙家'''|rm=xiānjiā|tl=illuminated immortal clan,}} is used in terms that pertain to the adepti collectively, such as adeptal techniques or possessions. For example, "adeptal energy" is {{zh|仙家气运|rm=xiānjiā qìyùn|tl=aura of the illuminated immortal clan,}} and the Chinese description for [[Eye of Perception]] says that the weapon belonged to the ''xianjia'', rather than to a specific ''xianren''. It can also be used as an honorific form of ''xianren''.<ref name="SGLW">{{Ref/Quest|Sky-Gazers, Land-Walkers}}</ref>

==Overview==
Most adepti are illuminated beasts &mdash; beings beyond the ken of normal mortals and are often worshipped like deities by the people of Liyue &mdash; or have illuminated beast blood in their veins. Some gods have also been referred to as adepti: [[Morax]] is known as the {{lang|Prime of Adepti|zh=众仙之祖|zh_tl=ancestor of the adepti,}}<ref>{{Ref/Quest|An Organization Known as Wangsheng}}</ref> while [[Marchosius]] was also considered one.

Very little is known about the origins of adepti and illuminated beasts. Morax is presumably the progenitor of the adepti in some shape or form, having personally given his "blessings" to grant several adepti their illumination, including [[Madame Ping]].<ref name="Teapot1">{{Ref/Quest|A Teapot to Call Home: Part I}}</ref> Some believe that they descended from [[Celestia]] and return there once they die.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Musheng}}</ref><ref name="Rainslasher">{{Ref/Weapon|Rainslasher}}</ref> According to legend, humans could ascend to Celestia and join the ranks of the adepti,<ref name="Qingzhou" /> and those who sought the path of the adepti had to pass the "trials of heaven and earth." The trial of "earth" was taken inside of the [[Taishan Mansion]],<ref>{{Ref/Domain|Taishan Mansion}}</ref> while the location for the trial of "heavens" is unknown.

Because humans have a "higher purpose" than adepti in the world of [[Teyvat]], only those of non-human status can be referred to as adepti.<ref name="xiaobg">HoYoverse News: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/8642 Developer Insight #4: Character Stories (I) - "Vigilant Yaksha" Xiao]</ref> While legends exist of humans joining the ranks of the adepti,<ref name="Qingzhou">{{Ref/NPC|Qingzhou}}</ref> and humans are capable of learning adepti arts,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Away With Obsessions and Falsehood}}</ref> they are not considered adepti.<ref name="AQI-1-2">{{Ref/Quest|Seagaze Sunset}}</ref> However, half-blooded humans can qualify as adepti.<ref name="Teapot1" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Solitary Fragrance}}</ref>

===Appearance===
The adepti have a large range in terms of appearance, but most of them take on their true, illuminated beast forms when appearing before mortals.<ref>Web Event, [[Stone Harbor Treasure Journal/Story#Reading|Stone Harbor Treasure Journal, Reading (Zhongli)]], Chinese version: {{zh|[三眼五显仙人]们大多都以兽形示人|tl=A majority of the Mighty and Illuminated Adepti take the forms of beasts when appearing before mortals.}}</ref> Full-blooded adepti are capable of shapeshifting into a human form,<ref name="SGLW" /> and some &mdash; such as Madame Ping and Xiao &mdash; prefer such a form.<ref group="Note">Xiao's Developer Insight states that the tattoo on his arm depicts an illuminated beast and is related to his "true form," indicating he did not always have a human form.</ref> It is also apparent that the adepti can change the appearance of their human form; Madame Ping's appearance as an old lady is not caused by aging, but is instead said to be from her own choice. She has been depicted to be in a youthful form in the past.<ref name="SHIS">{{Ref/Quest|A Single Harmony for an Irreplaceable Soul}}</ref> However, other adepti, like [[Moon Carver]], take pride in their beast forms and refuse to use human disguises.<ref name="SGLW" />

So far, known half-blooded humans take on a humanoid appearance with a few distinguishing traits from their illuminated beast blood. It has not been suggested that they have the ability to shapeshift or otherwise take on a more beastlike form.

===Culture===
Many cultural aspects revolving around the adepti are derived from real-world {{w|Taoism|Daoism}} and {{w|Buddhism}}, though within the world of Teyvat, such concepts are seen as the path of the adepti.

One aspect of adeptal culture is the use of sacred names,<ref>{{Ref/VO|Chongyun|About Qiqi}}</ref><ref name="QiqiPreserver1">{{Ref/Talent|Adeptus Art: Preserver of Fortune}}</ref><ref name="QiqiPreserver2">{{Ref/VO|Qiqi|Elemental Burst}}</ref> also known as adeptus names.<ref name="AQI-1-2" /> In the Chinese version, most sacred names contain four characters that serve as a name, followed by the honorific title {{zh|真君|tl=perfected lord}}. The English translation typically renders the first two characters and leaves out the honorific title. For example, {{zh|削月築阳真君|tl=The Perfected Lord who Carves the Moon and Builds the Sun}} is rendered as [[Moon Carver]], translating only the {{zh|削月}} part of the title.<ref group="Note">During one of the Closed Beta Tests, some sacred names were translated in full; Moon Carver, for example, was "Perfected Lord of Descending Sun and Ascending Moon." It appears the translation team later decided that direct translations were too clunky and wordy, and truncated them for readability.</ref>

There are sacred names that use different naming schemes, typically used by those with a special place among the adepti. The Chinese version of "Rex Lapis" is {{zh|岩王帝君|rm=Yánwáng Dìjūn|tl=The Sovereign Lord Rock King}}, which uses the higher-ranking honorific {{zh|帝君|tl=sovereign lord}} compared to most adepti's {{zh|真君|tl=perfected lord}}. In a similar vein, the Chinese version of Xiao's title, Conqueror of Demons, is {{zh|降魔大圣|tl=Great Sage who Subdues Demons}}, which forgoes the "lord" honorific system entirely. In both cases, their sacred names (excluding the honorific) are also only two characters long instead of the conventional four.

While sacred names are associated with the adepti, they have been applied to non-adepti as well. The adepti-created teapot spirits like [[Tubby]] and [[Chubby]] have sacred names despite not being considered adepti. [[Qiqi]] is heavily suggested to bear the sacred name {{Lang|Fortune Preserver|zh=救苦度厄真君}} following her resurrection at the hands of the adepti,<ref name="QiqiPreserver1" /><ref name="QiqiPreserver2" /> even though [[Shenhe]], who was personally trained by multiple adepti, explicitly lacks a sacred name since she is human. There is also nothing stopping from ordinary humans from giving themselves sacred names to pose as adepti, as seen with {{Lang|[[Archaic Lord of Lightning and Blitz]]|zh=霹雳闪雷真君}} and {{Lang|[[Starsnatcher]]|zh=掇星攫辰天君}}.

On top of that, not all adepti use sacred names, as seen with Madame Ping and Ganyu. The former's sacred name is {{Lang|Streetward Rambler|zh=歌尘浪市真君}}, but she took on the alias of Madame Ping upon integrating herself into human society. It is unclear if Ganyu has a sacred name but uses an ordinary name to blend in with humans, or if she never had one to begin with. While Xiao has a sacred name, it is typically used by other adepti or by humans knowledgeable about the adepti; when Xiao gives his name to the [[Traveler]], he tells them to call him "Adeptus Xiao."<ref>{{Ref/VO|Xiao|Hello}}</ref>

==Powers and Abilities==
All adepti possess the ability to manipulate elemental energy,<ref name="Xiao Vision" /> which mortals equate to having a [[Vision]]; this led to the "three-eyed" part of the adepti's full Chinese title.<ref name="xiaobg" /> It is unclear whether the adepti's ability to manipulate elemental energy follows the same rules as humans'. For example, beastlike adepti do not have Visions located externally on their bodies, leading humans to conclude that they possess "inner eyes" located within their bodies and are not visible on their bodies. Xiao wears a Vision because he appears in a humanlike form and thus follows human convention.<ref name="xiaobg" /> and whether his Vision is the same as a human's has been left ambiguous.<ref name="Xiao Vision" />

Adepti possess {{Lang|adeptal energy|zh=仙家气运|zh_rm=xiānjiā qìyùn}} that has a unique effect based on the individual. When the [[Traveler]] was infused with three adepti's energies, Madame Ping's created intermittent shockwaves upon attacking, Ganyu's granted passive healing, and Xiao's increased movement speed.<ref name="TP">{{Ref/Quest|Turning Point}}</ref> It is unclear whether adeptal energy is linked to their "third eye," or if it is an independent power.

For normal humans, prolonged interaction with adepti will become dangerous, as their souls are not as robust and adeptal energy will overwhelm them with enough time.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Wangshu}}</ref> When a dying [[Qiqi]] was infused with several adepti's energies, it was powerful enough to prevent her from fully dying &mdash; but because it was too much for a mortal to bear, sent her on a rampage that was only stopped by trapping her in amber for hundreds of years.<ref name="Qiqi 4">{{Ref/CS|Qiqi|4}}</ref> Even after hundreds of years, she is still capable of manipulating that adeptal energy as a zombie.

According to Liyue beliefs, adepti formed the landscape; for example, rivers are adepti saliva, while grass is adepti hair. [[Mountain Shaper]] denies those claims as "nonsense," and explains that the [[Amber Rock|amber]] found on [[Mt. Hulao]] is in fact created by a plant called the karst crawler. However, he is capable of controlling the plant to a certain degree and has to make sure the plant will not trap innocent beings before he leaves the area.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Moulder of Mountains}}</ref>

Adepti are capable of creating [[domains]] &mdash; known as abodes<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Abode}}</ref> &mdash; through [[Sub-Space Creation]] for their personal use, even granting them different forms such as teapots.<ref name="RealmWithin">{{Ref/Quest|The Realm Within}}</ref> This ability was granted by Rex Lapis and is part of the "illumination" in "Mighty and Illuminated Adepti".<ref name="Teapot1" />

There are several esoteric techniques used by the adepti. One of them is the "gifting of dreams and visions," used by [[Zhongli]] to inform the other adepti and the [[Liyue Qixing]] that [[Morax]] had not actually died, but had chosen to retire from his role.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref> Another is Dream Trawler, which is primarily used to separate the soul from the body for self-cultivation but can also be used to summon another's spirit; Xiao and the Traveler use it to summon [[Starsnatcher]]'s spirit.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Purging of Evil}}</ref> [[Pervases]] uses Mortal Lingering to temporarily regain a physical vessel.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Insights of Drifting Dreams}}</ref>

==Story==
===Before and During the Archon War===
It is unclear how long the adepti have existed as a formally recognized group, but they were said to have fought for [[Guizhong]] and Morax during the [[Archon War]] to defend the [[Guili Assembly]],<ref name="STC">{{Ref/Book|Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Treasure Lost, Treasure Found (Part 1)}}</ref> and [[Cloud Retainer]] was friends with them before the fall of the Guili Assembly.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Custodian of Clouds}}</ref>

After the destruction of the Guili Assembly, Morax led his adepti and his people south of Mt. Tianheng, where he established [[Liyue Harbor]]. There, the adepti signed a contract with him to protect Liyue.<ref name="TP" /><ref name="STC" /> At some point during the war, Morax gathered the [[yaksha]]s, particularly belligerent illuminated beasts, to assist him in the task of subduing the remnants of other gods defeated during the war.

During a battle between adepti and demons, Qiqi trespassed the realm of adepti by mistake while picking herbs and was mortally wounded in the crossfire. The adepti came together to resurrect her as a zombie by imbuing her with their powers.<ref name="Qiqi 4" />

===Present===
Since the end of the Archon War two thousand years ago, with their immense strength no longer needed to fight the gods that opposed Morax,<ref name="TP" /> most adepti have gone into seclusion in [[Jueyun Karst]], cut off from the rest of the world and watching over Liyue from afar.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Verses of Equilibrium}}</ref><ref name="TYW">{{Ref/Quest|The Yaksha's Wish}}</ref> This land is considered sacred and mortals are not to set foot in it &mdash; those that do enter are considered either brave or desperate. Allegedly, only mortals with a [[Sigil of Permission]] in their possession are granted access to enter without offending the adepti. However, several [[NPC]]s can be found in the adepti's lands without having come to any harm, though they have not been granted audience with the adepti in return.

According to legend, some adepti decided that they did not want to wait around for their lives to come to a natural end and asked Morax to transform them into stone statues. It is said that these stone statues are capable of moving around even in this state.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Records of Jueyun: Stone Beasts}}</ref>

Some adepti stayed in Liyue Harbor to assist the [[Liyue Qixing]] in managing the nation's affairs. However, by the events of [[Chapter I]], they have long been excluded from Liyue's politics with the exception of [[Ganyu]], who serves as a general secretary.<ref name="RealmWithin" />

Although it has become simplified over time and is beginning to fade into obscurity, it is a Liyue tradition to mark the passing of every adeptus with a memorial service called the Rite of Parting. This service is handled by the [[Wangsheng Funeral Parlor]], though they have only had to host this service a handful of times throughout the past three thousand years.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Zhongli|Character Details}}</ref>

===Guardian Yakshas===
{{Main|Yaksha}}
The Guardian Yakshas were elite adepti summoned by the Geo Archon, [[Rex Lapis]], to fight the demons that spawned from the remains of defeated gods after the Archon War. There were many Yakshas; however, five of them were recognized as the strongest: Bosacius, Indarias, Bonanus, Menogias, and Alatus.<ref name="YTGA" />

Yakshas, though strong, were not all able to handle the darkness they faced. It's said that "some were given unto their rage, others unto a madness which fear mongered. Many turned to the slaughter of their own, others were bewitched by shadows of the soul." In the end, all but Alatus either perished or disappeared by the time of the game's start.<ref name="YTGA" /><ref name="yaksha trailer">{{Ref/Quest|Glimmers of the Vigilant Yaksha|note=Cutscene}}</ref>

==Trivia== 
* The concept for the adepti came from the Chinese novel ''{{w|Journey to the West}}'', in which it is stated that "All beings in the upper worlds that have nine apertures can become Immortals." This statement is used to justify treating the main character, the monkey Sun Wukong, equal to a human in his ability to cultivate the way of immortality, and is tied to the reason why most of the adepti have animal-like forms.<ref name="xiaobg" />
* The weapon [[Eye of Perception]] is said to be of adepti origin, which was passed onto the [[Yun Family]] who proceeded to create the [[Prototype Series|Prototype weapons]].
* The Chinese name for [[seelie]], {{zh|仙灵|rm=xiānlíng|tl=fairy spirit}}, uses the same {{zh|仙|rm=xiān}} in their name for adepti. However, it likely uses the "fairy" definition for the term rather than the "illuminated immortal" definition, and there has currently been no direct connection made between seelie and adepti.
* When [[Yae Miko]] calls herself a "fox envoy" in ''[[The Omnipresent God]]'', she calls herself a {{zh|狐仙|tl=fox ''xian''}} in the original Chinese text, which is interesting considering other instances of "fox envoy" in the English text correspond with the Chinese term {{zh|狐狸神使|tl=fox god envoy}} instead.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Whispers of the Crane and the White Rabbit}}</ref> {{zh|狐仙}} is more directly translated as "fox spirits" in [[Kaede]]'s dialogue.
* The achievement ''[[Mighty and Illuminated Wave Rider]]'' cheekily names the Waverider "Wave Rider," or {{zh|乘風破浪真君|tl=The Perfected Lord Who Rides the Wind and Splits the Waves}}.

===Etymology=== 
* The adepti are synonymous with the {{w|Xian (Taoism)|Xian}} (Taoist Immortals), and are referred to as such (仙人) in the Chinese and Japanese versions of the game.
** In English, those who dedicate their lives to practicing Taoism are often called "Taoist adepts,"<ref>Google Books: [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Cultivating_Perfection/rnp-GwZAGVsC?q=&gbpv=1&bsq=adept#f=false Cultivating Perfection], mentions of "adept"</ref><ref>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/daoism-religion/ Religious Daoism]</ref> which is where the term "adeptus/adepti" in the English localization derives from.
* In Chinese, and in some translations other than English, their titles include the honorific title {{zh|真君|rm=zhēnjūn|tl=perfected lord}}, typically given to Taoist immortals.<ref>Google Books: [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Cultivating_Perfection/rnp-GwZAGVsC?q=&gbpv=1&bsq=zhenjun#f=false Cultivating Perfection] (mentions of 真君)</ref>
** Zhēnjūn is a lower-ranking title than the 帝君 (''dìjūn; sovereign'') honorific used by [[Rex Lapis#Trivia|Rex Lapis]].
