'''Pir Kavikavus''' is a historical figure in [[Sumeru]]. He was hailed as a true genius and the pride of [[Kshahrewar]]; however, following an accident during his research into the [[Ruin Golem (Devantaka Mountain)|Ruin Golem]] at [[Devantaka Mountain]], his research was lost and Kshahrewar lost its prestige ever since.

==Story==
An unknown amount of time after the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago, Pir Kavikavus joined [[Sumeru Akademiya]]'s Kshahrewar. He proved to be a prodigy and gained the status of Herbad before he was 30 years old, which was a monumental accomplishment.<ref name="VAJC">{{Ref/Quest|Vimana Agama: Jazari's Chapter}}</ref> Kavikavus was also friends with an [[Aranara]] named [[Aralohita]], who accompanied him and helped him with his discoveries.<ref name="UVH">{{Ref/Quest|Until Vana is Healed}}</ref> At some point, he discovered that the [[Akasha System]] has no signal on [[Devantaka Mountain]].<ref>{{Ref/BB|Bimarstan's Proverb Column}}</ref>

In the Akademiya's records, he was the last person to get inside the Ruin Golem for systematic research and since then, nobody has been able to make their way inside. However, while he was investigating the ancient [[Khaenri'ah]]n construct, he got into an accident. His research was lost and Pir Kavikavus himself likely died.<ref name="VAJC" /><ref name="UVH" /> Ever since then, Kshahrewar has been greatly depreciated in the Akademiya's eyes, and they have not even received an increase in funding in the years since his passing.<ref>{{Ref/BB|Akademiya Public Message Board|Funding for Kshahrewar}}</ref>

After Kavikavus' death, Aralohita saved some of his research and locked it behind riddles and puzzles, which the Aranara had been fond of. While Aralohita survived whatever accident Kavikavus was involved in, Aralohita's own fate is unknown.<ref name="UVH" />

===Legacy===
At some point, the Pir Kavikavus Prize, awarded to a scholar under 40 who has made outstanding research in a particular field, was named after him.<ref name="SSCRA1">{{Ref/Quest|Spike Self-Circulation Report: Abstract (Part 1)}}</ref> Many members of Kshahrewar continue to admire Kavikavus to this day, including [[Jazari]], who seeks to follow in his predecessor's path and study the Ruin Golem.<ref name="VAJC" />

During the {{Quest|Until Vana is Healed}}, [[Ararycan]], [[Paimon]], and the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] discover [[a Research Paper by Pir Kavikavus]] hidden behind one of Aralohita's puzzles. Unable to read it themselves, they bring this long-lost piece of research to Jazari. Ecstatic over the discovery, Jazari immediately takes them to test Kavikavus' research by sealing the Ruin Golem's Chaos Core, which was the subject of the paper. The seal successfully weakens the [[Abyss Mage]]s trying to interrupt the sealing process, and the complete seal greatly diminishes the [[Abyss Order]]'s threat to the forest.<ref name="UVH" />

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* "Kavikavus" may be derived from {{w|Kay Kavus}}, a historical Persian king written about in the {{w|Shahnameh}}. Kay Kavus is known equally for his inventions and for his knack for getting into trouble, which required him to be saved by the hero Rostam.
