|This tale began a thousand years ago, when Mondstadt's rulers fell from grace. The southern lion their crowns to the earth did throw, and the west wind arose and took their place.<br />The guardian of the north returned, and near to the wolven wood he drew. The four winds blew each in their turn, and united they built Mondstadt anew.
