;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Man, what happened last night? We couldn't find anyone to discuss it with because it was so late... Well, Miko and the others should be at the grounds by now, right? Let's go talk to them!

;(Approach [[Senga]], [[Wakana]], and [[Takitoh]] at the venue)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... Doesn't look like Miko is around here anywhere. Paimon doesn't see [[Ayato]] or [[Ayaka]], either...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are we too early? Hmm... Didn't Ayato say he prepared lodging for everyone at the shrine?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 senga 01.ogg}} '''Senga:''' ...Did you hear? Someone encountered a doppelganger here last night!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 wakana 01.ogg}} '''Wakana:''' A doppelganger!? You mean... like a doppelganger of themselves, or someone they know?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 takitoh 01.ogg}} '''Takitoh:''' You know what they say... Anyone who sees their doppelganger will be replaced by them within three days..
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 wakana 02.ogg}} '''Wakana:''' Th&mdash;That's just a folk tale! It's not real!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Doppelgangers? That's a common folk tale in Inazuma, isn't it... Ever heard of it, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} I know the gist.
::{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 05a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, it's a pretty famous one, huh... A friend being replaced by a complete stranger!
:{{DIcon}} No, never.
::{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 05b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? It always comes up in light novels... You've really never seen it? It's like when your friend is replaced by a complete stranger!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Also, the timing is a bit too coincidental, don't you think? Could it be related to what we saw last night?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The whole doppelganger thing sounds kind of like what Sayu was talking about with [[Enchanted Tales of the Mikawa Festival/Bunshin Phantasm|Bunshin Phantasm]]... Maybe something went wrong with [[Kichiboushi]]'s powers?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well... Thinking about it isn't going to get us anywhere. Why don't we go check on Sayu's team?
:;(The Traveler and Paimon approach Sayu's stall)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... They're not here yet.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe they're still asleep?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, if it's Sayu we're talking about, that's definitely possible... Oh, someone's coming!
:;(A man kneels to examine the sign for Bunshin Phantasm)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 tenryoucommissionofficer 01.ogg}} '''???:''' ...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Weird... Is he here to work on the equipment? But, he doesn't look like any of the workers we saw yesterday... And, it doesn't seem like he's here for the games...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 tenryoucommissionofficer 02.ogg}} '''???:''' ...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah... He snuck away again! Do you think he might be...?
:{{DIcon}} Let's follow him and see what he does.
:;(The Traveler and Paimon follow him through Chinju Forest)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He's constantly looking back... Paimon's calling it now! Something fishy is going on!
:{{DIcon}} Don't jump to conclusions. Let's keep watching.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good point! He could be on his way to meet someone! Let the hunter become the hunted!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 tenryoucommissionofficer 03.ogg}} '''???:''' ...Reporting back, Ma'am. Nothing suspicious to note at the Bunshin Phantasm booth. It's possible there's no connection to the incident from last night.
:'''???:''' I see... Did you find any other clues?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[Kujou Sara|Sara]]!?
:'''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Ah, good morning, you two.
:{{Introductory Note|Shikanoin Heizou}}
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[Heizou]]!? What's going on here?
:'''Shikanoin Heizou:''' I was wondering who was daring enough to sneak up on one of our detectives. Maybe I should have expected it to be you.
:{{DIcon}} I guess that makes us "the hunted."
:{{DIcon}} So, the [[Tenryou Commission]]'s on the case.
:'''Kujou Sara:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 tenryoucommissionofficer 04.ogg}} '''Tenryou Commission Member:''' F&mdash;Forgive me, ma'am! I have failed as a detective... I... I did not realize someone was on my tail...
:'''Kujou Sara:''' ...Considering {{Traveler}}'s skill, the fault is not with you.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... So, what's going on? What are you investigating? It must be serious if Heizou's involved...
:'''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Well, about that... hehe...
:'''Kujou Sara:''' ...Unfortunately... My orders prevent me from sharing that information with you.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What orders? You really can't tell us anything?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (If Sara and Heizou are so hesitant to divulge information... There's only one person who could be responsible.)
:{{DIcon}} Those orders come from the Shogun, don't they...
:'''Kujou Sara:''' ...!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 raidenei 01a.ogg}} {{A|vo schjeq002 1 raidenei 01b.ogg}} '''???:''' An astute observation, {{Traveler}}... Tell {{MC|m=him|f=her}} the truth.
:'''Kujou Sara:''' Sh&mdash;Shogun...!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!? The Shogun is here?
:{{DIcon}} No... I believe this is Ei.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 raidenei 02.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...You recognized me with a single glance?
:'''Kujou Sara:''' Shogun, we still haven't completed the investigation...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 raidenei 03.ogg}} '''Ei:''' It matters not. I am certain the person standing before us is our friend, {{Traveler}}.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 raidenei 04a.ogg}} {{A|vo schjeq002 1 raidenei 04b.ogg}} '''Ei:''' {{MC|m=His|f=Her}} gaze, {{MC|m=his|f=her}} presence, {{MC|m=his|f=her}} mastery of several types of [[Elemental Energy]]... There is no mistake. And, we need {{MC|m=his|f=her}} help.
;(A flashback begins)
:'''Kujou Sara:''' ...Understood. An investigation team was sent to survey a piece of land. Yesterday, the Tenryou Commission received a report that the team was found unconscious in the field.
:'''Kujou Sara:''' ...Not only that, but the group appeared to have become trapped in an endless nightmare, unable to wake up.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 takada 01.ogg}} '''Investigator Trapped in a Nightmare:''' N&mdash;No, please!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 kiritani 01.ogg}} '''Investigator Trapped in a Nightmare:''' Stay away!
;(Flashback ends)
:'''Kujou Sara:''' We detected intermittent traces of [[youkai]] power where they were found. We followed the traces and ended up here, just outside the festival grounds.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What!?
:{{DIcon}} Should we call off the festival?
:'''Kujou Sara:''' Unfortunately, it's not that simple. You've heard the rumors about the doppelgangers, yes?
:'''Kujou Sara:''' We suspect the culprit has the ability to change form, allowing them to spread misinformation at will. They may have already infiltrated the festival grounds.
:'''Shikanoin Heizou:''' If we call off the festival, we may give them a chance to escape amid the chaos...
:'''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Even the slightest movement could alert them. Locking down the festival grounds could provoke them to attack, which would endanger the public.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're right... That's a big risk...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 raidenei 05.ogg}} '''Ei:''' The purpose of festival is to bring humans and youkai together. We cannot allow the culprit to endanger anyone.
:{{DIcon}} But, what if they attack again?
:'''Shikanoin Heizou:''' A very valid concern. Last night, we dispatched a group of soldiers to the festival grounds. They'll remain undercover to keep an eye on things.
:'''Shikanoin Heizou:''' We also blocked off several nearby roads under the pretext of construction, so we can keep civilians away as much as possible.
:'''Kujou Sara:''' ...Even the Almighty Shogun has taken it upon herself to patrol the area all night.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 raidenei 06.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Fortunately, no one else has been harmed.
:{{DIcon}} ...Thank you.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! So the thunder we heard was you!
:'''Kujou Sara:''' ...I apologize for our failings, Shogun. You should not have had to intervene.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 raidenei 07.ogg}} '''Ei:''' On the contrary, it was my decision. I was unable to capture the culprit last night, so I left to discuss a plan with Miko. I did not show myself once I saw you were safe, and for that, I apologize.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, speaking of Miko... Where is she?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 raidenei 08.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...She is investigating the trace of youkai power found at the scene. Though it fades in and out, it never strays from Mt. Yougou.
:'''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Which means... if the culprit infiltrated the festival grounds, they must still be nearby.
:'''Shikanoin Heizou:''' The only people close to the grounds last night were the staff and the contestants staying at the shrine.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 raidenei 09.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Miko is working with the Kamisato siblings to verify the identities of the staff members. They should be done soon.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 raidenei 10.ogg}} '''Ei:''' As for the contestants... That inquiry must be performed by someone else.
:{{DIcon}} ...Is that why you need my help?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 raidenei 11.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...The Tenryou Commission is too conspicuous. But as the judge of the competition, you can ask questions without arousing suspicion.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 24.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, so you need us to talk to the teams and see if there's an imposter among us...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 raidenei 12.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Precisely. {{Traveler}}, I understand these people are your friends, and it puts you in a difficult position...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 raidenei 13.ogg}} '''Ei:''' But, if one of them has indeed been displaced by a youkai, they could be in grave danger...
:{{DIcon}} ...I understand. I'll do my best.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 raidenei 14.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Thank you. I truly hope the situation is not as grave as it seems.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 25.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What are you guys gonna do next? Continue to investigate from a distance?
:'''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Well, there's only so much we can learn that way, so I think we need to find a way to slip onto the grounds. It's better for us to be at the scene if something goes wrong.
:'''Kujou Sara:''' I fear the Shogun is far too revered a figure for that. If she arrives at the grounds, it will certainly cause a stir.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 raidenei 15.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Worry not. Miko and I discussed that issue. She claims to have a plan. The preparations are underway as we speak.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 paimon 26.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' One of her genius plans, huh...
:{{DIcon}} Somehow, "scheme" seems more accurate...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 1 raidenei 16.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...Indeed. If you learn any details of said plan, I would like to know what I'm getting myself into.
:;(The player is teleported to the festival entrance)
----
;(Enter the festival area)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, so where do we start... We need to ask questions to figure out if there's an imposter, but we can't arouse suspicion...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, looks like Sayu's team is already here. Well, guess we'll just... play it by ear.

;(Talk to Sayu or Yoimiya)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 2 sayu 01.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' *yawn*... So tired... I don't feel rested at all. How come you two have so much energy? Didn't you stay up even later than me...?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 2 kichiboushi 01.ogg}} '''"Kichiboushi":''' Haha, weak!
:'''Yoimiya:''' Kichiboushi! That's not a nice thing to say to a friend. Sayu's probably just tired because she came up with all the ideas yesterday!
:'''Yoimiya:''' Need a break, Sayu? I can start thinking about the ending stages in the meantime!
:'''Yoimiya:''' It's been forever since we've done something fun together! You need to have enough energy to enjoy it!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 2 sayu 02.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Oh, uh... I&mdash;It's okay... I can push through...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sayu and [[Yoimiya]] seem the same as ever! Kichiboushi, too. How should we test them...?
:{{DIcon}} Let's ask about the past...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, good idea! Doppelgangers only mimic appearances &mdash; they wouldn't know about someone's past! Let's give it a try!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 2 kichiboushi 02.ogg}} '''"Kichiboushi":''' Mm! White Fur! Yellow Fur!
:'''Yoimiya:''' Whoa, you guys are here bright and early!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Y&mdash;Yeah, well... {{Traveler}}'s judging this thing, so we can't slack off... right?
:'''Yoimiya:''' Still... You don't need to make anything, so what's the rush?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 2 sayu 03.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Yeah... If the people in charge are here early, that usually means there's been some kind of emergency...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 2 paimon 06a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo schjeq002 2 paimon 06b.ogg}}--> '''Paimon:''' Oh, no... It's just... {{Traveler}} really wanted to see you!
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Seriously, Paimon...?)
:'''Yoimiya:''' Oh, um... Why?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 2 paimon 07a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo schjeq002 2 paimon 07b.ogg}}--> '''Paimon:''' Um... Well... It's... your game! Playing your game yesterday brought up a whole bunch of old memories!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, we wanted to come early to reminisce about old times, hehe. Y'know, because you might be busy... later... and stuff...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (What kind of an excuse is that? They're busy now!)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 2 kichiboushi 03.ogg}} '''"Kichiboushi":''' White Fur... Acting super strange!
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Time to change the topic!)
:{{DIcon}} Oh, I was [[Star-Pickers' Passage|just thinking about]] the [[Aranara]]...
::'''Yoimiya:''' Oh, you know what? Me too! I thought about adding them to our game, considering the "dream" theme and everything.
::'''Yoimiya:''' But, in the end, the ideas just wouldn't come together...
::{{A|vo schjeq002 2 kichiboushi 04a 1.ogg}} '''"Kichiboushi":''' Marinara... Yum!
::'''Yoimiya:''' No, it's not a food! The Aranara are like, um... small youkai from [[Sumeru]]. They're super friendly and cute, and can give you good dreams...
::'''Yoimiya:''' Actually, that describes you, too, Kichiboushi. If you ever go to Sumeru, I'm sure you'll be considered a "good Nara"!
::{{A|vo schjeq002 2 kichiboushi 04a 2.ogg}} '''"Kichiboushi":''' ...Good banana?
::{{A|vo schjeq002 2 sayu 04a 1.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Sumeru, huh... The dreams there are supposed to be special. Did you witness a dream or something? Maybe it could give us some inspiration, and we wouldn't have to think so much...
::'''Yoimiya:''' Haha... Sorry, that dream is a little... hard to describe, don't you think, {{Traveler}}?
::{{DIcon}} Sometimes, when there are too many feelings in a dream...
::{{DIcon}} It's really hard to use as reference material.
::{{A|vo schjeq002 2 sayu 04a 2.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Alright... *sigh* I was just wondering what kind of dream it was, that's all...
::'''Yoimiya:''' I guess it was the kind where... a lot of things happened! Anyway, it's a [[Star-Pickers' Passage|long story]]. How about we wait until after the competition?
::'''Yoimiya:''' ...{{Traveler}} and I can tell it together.
::{{DIcon}} Sounds good.
:{{DIcon}} Oh, I was just reminded of [[Yoohoo Art: Seichou no Jutsu|a certain ambush order]]...
::{{A|vo schjeq002 2 sayu 04b 1.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Huh? Wh&mdash;Why are you bringing that up all of a sudden?
::{{DIcon}} Well, all the bake-danuki transformations...
::{{DIcon}} Reminded of the time you failed that ninjutsu technique...
::{{A|vo schjeq002 2 sayu 04b 2.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Uh... Well, that was my bad... I tried to turn into a barrel, but my tail was sticking out... So, you found me immediately.
::{{A|vo schjeq002 2 sayu 04b 3.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' B&mdash;But this time, I'm not in charge of turning into things anymore, so it should be fine! I think...
::{{A|vo schjeq002 2 kichiboushi 04b 1.ogg}} '''"Kichiboushi":''' Haha, weak!
::'''Yoimiya:''' Kichiboushi, what did I say about talking that way...? Anyway, you seemed to have a good grasp on transformations yesterday, Sayu... What's the story here...
::{{DIcon}} It all started with a certain mysterious order...
::{{A|vo schjeq002 2 sayu 04b 4.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Th&mdash;That one shouldn't be on me! I didn't realize I was tricked until later... Did all that work, and didn't even get to nap... Really shouldn't have taken that order...
::{{DIcon}} Still... we had some fun times together, right?
::{{A|vo schjeq002 2 sayu 04b 5.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Umm...
::{{A|vo schjeq002 2 sayu 04b 6.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Based on what happened, I guess... You could say that...
::'''Yoimiya:''' Whoa, I've never seen this look on Sayu's face... What the heck happened back then!?
::{{A|vo schjeq002 2 kichiboushi 04b 2.ogg}} '''"Kichiboushi":''' Mujina, is all red!
::{{A|vo schjeq002 2 sayu 04b 7.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' No, I'm not! And, I'm not a Mujina!
:{{DIcon}} Oh, I was just reminded of some [[Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas|pilgrimage training]]...
::{{A|vo schjeq002 2 kichiboushi 04c 1.ogg}} '''"Kichiboushi":''' Mm! Had fun with Yellow Fur!
::{{A|vo schjeq002 2 paimon 09c 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We went to soooooo many places together!
::{{A|vo schjeq002 2 kichiboushi 04c 2.ogg}} '''"Kichiboushi":''' [[Dragonspine|Snowy mountain]]! Cold! [[Alcor]]! Big!
::'''Yoimiya:''' Wow, you traveled to all those places together?
::{{A|vo schjeq002 2 kichiboushi 04c 3.ogg}} '''"Kichiboushi":''' Orange Fur come with next time?
::'''Yoimiya:''' You betcha! You should come, too, Sayu! If you can find the time, of course!
::{{A|vo schjeq002 2 sayu 04c 1.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Um... Would we have to walk there?
::'''Yoimiya:''' Nope! You can just sit on the boat and listen to stories. We'd be there before you knew it!
::{{DIcon}} You can nap on the boat, too.
::{{DIcon}} Let the waves rock you to sleep.
::{{A|vo schjeq002 2 sayu 04c 2.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' R&mdash;Really?
::{{A|vo schjeq002 2 kichiboushi 04c 4.ogg}} '''"Kichiboushi":''' As long as Storm-Storm not mad...
::{{A|vo schjeq002 2 paimon 09c 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! It's not like [[Dvalin]]'s the one behind every single gust of wind!
:{{Black Screen|After that, you share many more memories together...}}
:'''Yoimiya:''' Oh, shoot, where did the time go... We have so many levels to design today!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, we should get out of your fur&mdash; hair, then! Good luck, everyone!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 2 kichiboushi 05.ogg}} '''"Kichiboushi":''' Bye, White Fur! Bye, Yellow Fur! Come back and play!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, we've had so many adventures, huh... You don't even realize it until someone brings up the past.
:{{DIcon}} Do you still remember the original meaning of our journey?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, yeah, totally! It was, um... What was it again?
:{{DIcon}} I figured...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, Paimon didn't pick up on anything suspicious from that team... If anything, we were the weird ones, forcing conversations and stuff...
:{{DIcon}} And whose fault is that?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 2 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' O&mdash;Okay, so maybe it wasn't the best strategy. Leaning into the "judge" angle is probably a safer bet...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 2 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's ask about the creative process behind the game and confirm their identities that way... Paimon saw Thoma's team show up just now. So, we can investigate them next!

;(Talk to Sayu or Yoimiya again, optional)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Looks like everyone's busy trying to finish their game... I should come back later.)

;(Talk to Hitotsume Kozou, Kappa, Thoma, or Youko)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Thoma! We were hoping to learn a bit more about the philosophy behind your game. Is now a good time?
:'''Thoma:''' Ah, looks like our judges are hard at work this morning.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 3 shousei 01.ogg}} '''"Shousei":''' ...Feel a soft bee?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 3 hitotsumekozou 01.ogg}} '''Hitotsume Kozou:''' Oh, um... Boss can explain that one.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 3 youko 01.ogg}} '''Youko:''' Boss and [[Shousei]] were up super late last night coming up with ideas!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 3 kappa 01.ogg}} '''Kappa:''' And, he's back at it this morning, as energetic as ever! Boss is the best!
:'''Thoma:''' Oh, I don't deserve that much praise... But, when it comes to the "talking" part, I guess I'm the best person to answer your questions.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe... Time for an interview!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 3 shousei 02.ogg}} '''"Shousei":''' Into you...?
:'''Thoma:''' Ask away, judges!
:{{DIcon}} What do you think is the most interesting aspect of your game?
::'''Thoma:''' Oh, I'd have to say... working with others to overcome challenges...
::{{A|vo schjeq002 3 paimon 03a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hold on! You can't ask such a simple question, {{Traveler}}! Watch and learn...
::{{A|vo schjeq002 3 paimon 03a 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *ahem*... We'd love to learn more about your design approach and strategic vision. What will be the project's main draw, and how will it deliver emotional value to your players?
::'''{{Traveler}}:''' (That's basically the same question...)
::'''Thoma:''' Sounds like you took that question straight from one of those business experts in [[Ritou]]... In that case, let me say this...
:;(Thoma rapidly gesticulates during the next two lines)
::'''Thoma:''' This product will be a fast-paced, easy-to-digest release that capitalizes on the enduring popularity of a traditional genre while addressing its common pain points...
::'''Thoma:''' By reviewing our strengths and the needs of our players, we were able to synchronize them across production levels and provide a refined experience that is more receptive to our users and more enjoyable overall...
::{{A|vo schjeq002 3 paimon 03a 3.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Impressive! And... completely over Paimon's head!
::'''{{Traveler}}:''' (You set yourself up for that one, Paimon!)
::{{A|vo schjeq002 3 kappa 02a 1.ogg}} '''Kappa:''' Nice one, Boss!
::'''Thoma:''' Haha... I kind of confused myself, honestly. I'm used to hearing that kind of talk in Ritou, so I guess I picked up a few things.
::{{A|vo schjeq002 3 paimon 03a 4.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A fixer is a tough nut to crack, huh... Shoot, Paimon can't pick apart an answer she doesn't understand! Over to you, {{Traveler}}!
:{{DIcon}} Did you design this game with anyone in mind?
::'''Thoma:''' Well... From a design standpoint, we want it to be a game for everyone...
::{{A|vo schjeq002 3 paimon 03b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Not so fast! "Everyone" isn't an answer! You need to be more specific about your target audience!
::'''Thoma:''' Ah... You're absolutely right. Then, allow me to revise my answer. Our target audience includes growing children, ages zero to eighteen.
::{{A|vo schjeq002 3 paimon 03b 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Makes sense! Kids need a little exercise here and there!
::'''Thoma:''' Second would be active adults, ages eighteen to forty.
::{{A|vo schjeq002 3 paimon 03b 3.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right! Adults have more stamina, so they can get more out of the game.
::'''Thoma:''' Next would be older adults, ages forty to sixty, especially those in need of exercise.
::{{A|vo schjeq002 3 paimon 03b 4.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Older adults... Hm, exercise is important for healthy aging, but something feels off about this...
::'''Thoma:''' Finally, we have elderly people who are still full of life. That would be the sixty to a thousand age range.
::{{A|vo schjeq002 3 paimon 03b 5.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, okay... Wait! That includes everyone!
::'''Thoma:''' Haha, well, we can't forget about the youkai, right? This game is for humans and youkai alike, after all.
::{{A|vo schjeq002 3 shousei 03b 1.ogg}} '''"Shousei":''' But, not for Ioroi!
::'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Because he's trapped in a statue, I'm guessing...?)
::'''Thoma:''' Besides, you seemed to agree with each group, Paimon... Unless you intend to change your tune?
::{{A|vo schjeq002 3 paimon 03b 6.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *ahem*... N&mdash;Next question!
:{{Black Screen|You continue asking questions, and Thoma answers faultlessly...}}
:'''Thoma:''' ...So, there you have it. I hope that answered your question, judges.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa... Not a single stumper...
:{{DIcon}} Impressive!
:{{DIcon}} Never underestimate a housekeeper!
:'''Thoma:''' Haha, well, I'm sure the interview is only one part of the evaluation process. We'll see what you think when you play the game yourself.
:'''Thoma:''' Which reminds me, I should probably get back to work on this stage. Wanna give it a try when we're done?
:{{DIcon}} It would be my pleasure.
:'''Thoma:''' In that case, let's get to it!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 3 hitotsumekozou 02.ogg}} '''Hitotsume Kozou:''' Y&mdash;Yes, Boss Thoma!
:;(Paimon and the Traveler step aside)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well... Thoma's answers were all very genuine. Paimon didn't notice anything un-Thomalike about them.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Plus, he was with Shousei until late last night... If you think about when we saw the nightmare creature, the timing doesn't match up...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[Kozou]] and his two friends were together the whole time, too. They would have noticed if someone was acting weird.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...So, we're back at square one! *sigh*... That just leaves Kokomi's team, right? Guess we should check them out...

;(Talk to Hitotsume Kozou, Kappa, Thoma or Youko again, optional)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Looks like everyone's busy trying to finish their game... I should come back later.)

;(Talk to [["Gyoubu Koban"]])
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 gyoubukoban 01.ogg}} '''"Gyoubu Koban":''' Huh? White Fur and Yellow Fur are here early!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're here alone? Huh... Where are [[Kokomi]] and the others?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 gyoubukoban 02.ogg}} '''"Gyoubu Koban":''' Don't know about great youkai, but sole lady is behind you!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sole lady? Oh, as in "Sole of the Deep"? Okay... Wait, did you say behind us!?
:'''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' You have questions for me, I presume?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' K&mdash;Kokomi! A little warning next time...
:{{DIcon}} ...Sounds like you already know why we're here.
:'''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Yes, I heard about the Doppelganger incident. When I saw you around the venue just now, it wasn't hard to connect the dots.
:'''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' As for what you want to know...
:'''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' [[Her Secret|...Energy]].
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Energy...? Oh! The numbers you write in your diary&mdash;
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 gyoubukoban 03.ogg}} '''"Gyoubu Koban":''' ...In a tree? Dry berry?
:'''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' ...Ahem.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, uh... S&mdash;Sorry...
:'''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' So... we can leave it there, right? You don't need to ask any more questions, I would imagine...
:{{DIcon}} Y&mdash;Yep, all good.
:'''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' As for Gyoubu Koban... He was in the shrine all night. I can't imagine he's the criminal you're searching for.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 gyoubukoban 04.ogg}} '''"Gyoubu Koban":''' EH!? Gyoubu Koban is a criminal!?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' N&mdash;No, of course not! You're in the clear!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 gyoubukoban 05.ogg}} '''"Gyoubu Koban":''' Phew... "In the clear"... is good?
:{{DIcon}} Very good.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 gyoubukoban 06.ogg}} '''"Gyoubu Koban":''' Good!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What about Mizuki? Where did she go?
:'''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' She left after receiving a message in the middle of night... Looking back on it, perhaps it's related to your own investigation.
:'''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Oh, as she left, I heard her whisper under her breath, "Ordering me around in the middle of the night. Who does she think she is...?"
:{{DIcon}} (...Miko.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (She probably needed an expert on nightmares to help formulate a strategy... Well, I guess that also confirms Mizuki's identity.)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 yaemiko 01.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Hm, something tells me a certain someone is missing me...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Miko! And Mizuki!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 mizuki 01.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' *yawn*... Hello, {{Traveler}} and Paimon.
:;(Mizuki appears very tired, her eyes half-lidded.)
:{{DIcon}} Did you finish up your work?
:;(As Miko replies, Mizuki nods off then shakes her head awake.)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 yaemiko 02.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Yes, I left the rest to the young fellow from the [[Kamisato Clan]]. At least for now, there's nothing suspicious to note.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That means... the culprit didn't manage to sneak in? That's a relief...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 yaemiko 03.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Just like that, you let down your guard? And all it took was for me to wear her face...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...EH!? Th&mdash;The culprit! I&mdash;It's you!
:{{DIcon}} If you keep joking like this...
:{{DIcon}} I want thirty percent of the profit.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 yaemiko 04.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Oh? Greedy little thing... I thought we agreed on twenty?
:{{DIcon}} Making a joke like that...
:{{DIcon}} You're the only one in Inazuma who would do that.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 yaemiko 05.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' *sigh* It's getting harder and harder to tease you, {{Traveler}}.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 mizuki 02.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Can you stop with the teasing, then? Even I'm reaching my limit...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 yaemiko 06.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Five hundred years, and you're still not used to it? Sounds like you need more practice.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 mizuki 03.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' At least spare me for the day. I can't take the mental torment right now. I'm running on fumes...
:{{DIcon}} So, what did you do last night...?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 mizuki 04.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Investigated the [[Shogunate]] officials' nightmares, analyzed the traces of youkai power around Mt. Yougou... Oh, and worked on some new game stages, of course.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' All in one night!?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 mizuki 05.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Well, I didn't want someone to ruin the Mikawa Flower Festival... But I also wanted to do my best for my part of the Festival.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 yaemiko 07.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' ...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 mizuki 06.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Besides, I've talked to many patients who worked multiple jobs just to make ends meet. Compared to that, complaining about one night of hard work is a little... unreasonable, don't you think?
:'''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Even so, I think you should take a break, Miss Mizuki. Gyoubu Koban and I can handle the game development in the meantime.
:'''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I learned a lot yesterday. I'm sure I can handle a few design elements while you get some rest.
:'''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' We can't have our lead developer out of commission. I'm not confident I can bring our vision to fruition on my own.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 mizuki 07.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' You're very persuasive, Kokomi. It would seem you also have a talent for clinical psychology... I'll leave it to you two, then.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 gyoubukoban 07.ogg}} '''"Gyoubu Koban":''' Sweet dreams!
:{{Black Screen|Mizuki goes to rest. A little unsteady on her {{sic|feat}}, she looks exhausted...}}
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mizuki really cares about the festival, huh... She's putting so much pressure on herself...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 yaemiko 08.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' ...Perhaps she's reminded of the festivals of the past, when I was just a kit, and Mizuki a young [[baku]].
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 yaemiko 09.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' ...We would rush past the other youkai, desperate to get the first piece of Fried Tofu from the ramen stand.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 yaemiko 10.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Hmph, it would seem she hasn't forgotten, even after five hundred years.
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like you haven't forgotten, either...
::{{A|vo schjeq002 4 yaemiko 11a 1.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' ...You know, there's something to be said for knowing when to keep your mouth shut, little one.
:{{DIcon}} (Remain silent...)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 yaemiko 12.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Hmph... Enough about the past. We must focus on the matter at hand.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But... you didn't notice anything suspicious, right? That should mean the culprit didn't sneak in...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 yaemiko 13.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' That's one possibility. The other... is that the culprit's "transformation" is even more convincing than we imagined.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 yaemiko 14.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' In that case, we need a "detective" with a more professional skillset... Or, we need to find a way to provoke them and get their facade to crack.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, that sounds dangerous!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 yaemiko 15.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' If the culprit is deep in disguise, a slight provocation won't completely expose them.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 yaemiko 16.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' What we need is to create reasonable doubt, make the culprit question whether their cover is blown... As they hesitate over whether to make some kind of last stand, that is our chance.
:{{DIcon}} So, how do you plan to provoke them?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 yaemiko 17.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Oh, Ei didn't tell you? Hehe... Allow me to show you.
:;(The scene changes to show all participants gathered in front of the stage, where Yae Miko is standing)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 yaemiko 18.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' ...Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the Mikawa Flower Festival, it is my honor to announce...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 yaemiko 19.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' An esteemed guest from [[Tenshukaku]] has agreed to take part in this year's festival!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 yaemiko 20.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Please welcome, Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder!
:;(From the side of the stage, Ei joins Miko as firecrackers and poppers go off from the stage banner overhead.)
:'''Yoimiya:''' It... It's the Shogun!
:'''Thoma:''' The Almighty Shogun... is here in person?
:;(Ei leans over to Miko.)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 raidenei 01.ogg}} '''Ei:''' So, this was your plan, Miko.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 yaemiko 21.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Well? Not bad, right?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, that was quite the entrance... Paimon can't believe she agreed to that...
:'''Kujou Sara:''' ...The Almighty Shogun's presence is bound to cause a stir. Instead of struggling to maintain a low profile, it's better for her to step into the open.
:'''Shikanoin Heizou:''' And, it means a detective can slip into the venue alongside the retinue, without turning any heads at all.
:'''Kujou Sara:''' In the presence of the Shogun, not even the most cunning of criminals can let down their guard. Their every move needs to be faultless.
:'''Shikanoin Heizou:''' The more you focus on getting one thing right, the easier it is for the rest to become cracks in the glass...
:{{DIcon}} That's what Miko wants us to take advantage of...
:'''Kujou Sara:''' And, she's using the Almighty Shogun as bait... Hmph, the Lady Guuji is as daring as ever.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why didn't you clue us in earlier? We wasted all that time asking pointless questions...
:'''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Your intel was very useful, actually. We don't know how things will unfold, but I have a feeling the truth will be revealed soon.
:'''Shikanoin Heizou:''' In the meantime, stick with the Shogun, {{Traveler}}. We need everyone focused on her.
:{{DIcon}} I'll do my best...
:'''Kujou Sara:''' ...Alright. Under my command, the Tenryou Commission will remain on high alert. If anything goes wrong, report back to me at once.
:;(Various scenes of Ei, Paimon, and the Traveler participating in the festival are shown during the next three lines)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (After that... We surveyed each stall, just like yesterday...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Ei's presence definitely caused a stir, but it didn't take long for the festive atmosphere to return...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Maybe a day will come when Ei can leave Tenshukaku, and it won't be so out of the ordinary.)

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew... Another day of hard work. Where did the time go...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 4 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? When did Ei get ahead of us? Let's catch up!

;(Talk to any of the three game teams again, optional)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Looks like everyone's busy trying to finish their game... I should come back later.)

;(Talk to Kujou Sara again, optional)
:'''Kujou Sara:''' It's rare to see the Almighty Shogun in such a good mood... Hmph, I will not let some wretched miscreant undermine the festival.

;(Talk to Shikanoin Heizou again, optional)
:'''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Interesting... The culprit's motive and method all seem rather self-contradictory. But, when did we first notice the dissonance...

;(Approach Ei)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 inoue 01.ogg}} '''{{tt|Inoue|Street Food Vendor (Stand-In)}}:''' ...A&mdash;Almighty Shogun! Glory to your everlasting reign... I&mdash;I mean... Welcome, welcome!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 raidenei 01.ogg}} '''Ei:''' This stall looks familiar. Yet, it would seem the ownership has changed hands...?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 inoue 02.ogg}} '''Inoue:''' Ah... You must be thinking of [[Tomoki]]. H&mdash;He... wasn't feeling well today, so I'm filling in... haha...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 raidenei 02.ogg}} '''Ei:''' I see... Yet, you remind me of someone &mdash; a Doushin from the Tenryou Commission...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 inoue 03.ogg}} '''Inoue:''' Oh, uh...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What are you looking at, Ei?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 raidenei 03.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Hm, the food offerings. Although, this vendor seems...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (The "vendor" is giving me a pleading look... Judging by his cooking skill, it almost seems like his first day on the job...)
:{{DIcon}} Ei... He's "working."
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 raidenei 04.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Working...? Ah.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 raidenei 05.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...I see. I appreciate your dedication, sir.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 inoue 04.ogg}} '''Inoue:''' O&mdash;Of course! It's an honor to serve such esteemed guests!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 raidenei 06.ogg}} '''Ei:''' No need for formalities... I'll take three orders of [[Dango Milk]].
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 inoue 05.ogg}} '''Inoue:''' ...Right away!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Three orders? So, Paimon gets one, too?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 raidenei 07.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Yes, I wanted to thank you for accompanying me. Without you by my side, I imagine the people here would be on edge even now.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 raidenei 08.ogg}} '''Ei:''' I have my reasons for being here, of course, but I would hate to tarnish the festive atmosphere.
:{{DIcon}} This festival is for everyone.
:{{DIcon}} Including you.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 raidenei 09.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Heh, indeed. The Mikawa Flower Festival... Hundreds of years have passed since I last partook in the festivities. Much is different this time &mdash; the people, the place, the games...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 raidenei 10.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Yet, the name endures, and the joy of celebration along with it... I suppose that, in itself, is a form of Eternity.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 mizuki 01.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon... and the Almighty Shogun?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Mizuki! Looks like you got some much-needed rest!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 raidenei 11.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Yumemizuki Mizuki... Thank you for your aid earlier.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 mizuki 02.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Of course, I'm always willing to help. It's my duty... I wish I could have dispelled the nightmares, but this situation is uncharted territory for me.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 raidenei 12.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Even so, relieving the pain of the nightmares is no small feat. You honor the legacy of the Yumekui-Baku.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, not even Mizuki could fix it... What's going on with this nightmare creature...?
:;(Ei looks off to the side, her brow slightly furled.)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 raidenei 13.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 mizuki 03.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' ...Let's save the difficult questions for later. Actually, I came here to ask you something.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 mizuki 04.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Wanna come to Aisa Bathhouse with me? Most of the contestants will be there... Oh, and don't worry about payment &mdash; it's my treat!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Yes! Yes! Let's go!
:{{DIcon}} You want us to go to the hot springs... now?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 mizuki 05.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Well, game development isn't easy. Most of the contestants are exhausted and could use a break.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 mizuki 06.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' You've been under a lot of pressure yourselves, with the investigation and all. So, I thought you might like to join.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Of course we would! Right, {{Traveler}}?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 raidenei 14.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...I will remain here. I rarely have time away from Tenshukaku, and I would like to continue perusing the stalls.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw... That's too bad...
:{{DIcon}} Then, I'm not going, either...
:{{DIcon}} Okay, I'll go...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 mizuki 07.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Ah, I almost forgot! Miko wanted to talk to you, {{Traveler}}. I'll take you to her first.

:{{DIcon}} Miko doesn't need to see me, does she...
:{{DIcon}} You needed to talk to me in private. Why?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 mizuki 10.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' I think something's off with the Shogun. You've been with her the whole day. Have you noticed anything?
:{{DIcon}} S&mdash;Something off? No...
::{{A|vo schjeq002 5 mizuki 11a 1.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Up close, sometimes it's hard to see the whole picture... I think something is troubling her.

::{{A|vo schjeq002 5 mizuki 11b 1.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Exactly! You noticed, too...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Something did seem off with Ei today... Maybe she's not used to leaving Tenshukaku? Or was it the reaction of the crowd...?)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (No, we've been through so much. Something so trivial wouldn't shake her... She must be keeping something to herself...)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 mizuki 12.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' I've witnessed a lot of cases where patients, for a variety of reasons, are unwilling or unable to seek help. Unfortunately, that only exacerbates the problem...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 mizuki 13.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Until their emotions become so heavy, even the strongest of people collapse under the weight... I see those warning signs in the Shogun.
:{{DIcon}} So, even the [[archon]]s aren't immune to emotional strain?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 mizuki 14.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Humans, youkai, and archons bear the same capacity for emotion and are, naturally, susceptible to the same mental turmoil.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 mizuki 15.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' It's very possible that someone who appears strong on the outside has learned to compartmentalize their negative emotions... And that is far from healthy.

:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 raidenei 16.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...There is no need to stay behind on my behalf. If you leave now, I'm sure you can catch up.
:{{DIcon}} Something tells me YOU chose to stay behind on OUR behalf...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 raidenei 17.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...What makes you say that?
:{{DIcon}} You want everyone to relax.
:{{DIcon}} You don't want people to be on edge because of you.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 raidenei 18.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...If my presence makes them nervous or impedes their ability to relax, does that not defeat the purpose of going to the hot springs?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 raidenei 19.ogg}} '''Ei:''' I already disturbed their progress by coming to the festival. The last thing everyone needs is more distractions.
:{{DIcon}} ...But, aren't you under pressure, too?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 raidenei 20.ogg}} '''Ei:''' As you know, [[The Shogun|this body]] is hardly that fragile. It can operate for another hundred years with no issue.
:{{DIcon}} ...You didn't deny it.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 raidenei 21.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...Hah. Mortals are weak in body and mind. If there is a choice of who to bear such a burden, naturally that person should be me.
:{{DIcon}} What if you didn't have to worry about bothering anyone...
:{{DIcon}} Would you agree to go to the hot springs then?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 5 raidenei 22.ogg}} '''Ei:''' What does it matter? The world is not so easily bent to one's will...
:{{DIcon}} I'll take that as a yes.
::{{DIcon}} I have a pair of special coupons here...

:'''Thoma:''' Besides, we're a bit behind with our game. We need to catch up.

:'''Thoma:''' Haha, I guess it's my fault for going overboard with the ideas. Kozou and the others can barely keep up.
:'''Thoma:''' Sometimes delegating work is harder than doing it yourself... I wonder if this is how [[Kamisato Ayato|he]] feels, being the head of the clan.

:{{A|vo schjeq002 7 raidenei 02.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Yes, there are Royal Hot Springs near Tenshukaku. But, the plans were set in motion only after [[Hiiragi Hiroshi]] introduced the [[Snezhnaya]]n Blast Furnace to Inazuma, and that was five hundred years ago.

:{{A|vo schjeq002 7 raidenei 09.ogg}} '''Ei:''' On a battlefield consumed in darkness, our soldiers fought against dark forces, creatures capable of possessing people and trapping them in nightmares. Even the Yumekui-Baku could do nothing to wake them.

:{{DIcon}} It doesn't seem bad enough to make you this upset.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 7 raidenei 10.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...Perhaps not. The battle was intense. Those who stood up in defense of this land knew the chance of survival was slim. In the face of certain death, surely a nightmare is nothing to fear...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 7 raidenei 11.ogg}} '''Ei:''' But, what if I told you this... If the person trapped in the nightmare was strong enough to overcome incapacitation, it would become a waking nightmare instead.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 7 raidenei 12.ogg}} '''Ei:''' The person would lose all capacity to distinguish dream from reality, perceiving everything in the real world as a continuation of the war.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 7 raidenei 13.ogg}} '''Ei:''' And every precious thing in life as an enemy to be annihilated... That is a far more painful nightmare, both for the person in question and those around them.

:'''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Up to this point, we've only detected traces of the nightmare creature around Mt. Yougou... And, now, a doppelganger appears in Inazuma City.
:'''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Our original thought was that the culprit infiltrated the venue to evade capture... If so, there would be no reason for them to risk exposure by continuing to change form.

:Doppelgangers and nightmares are actually...

;(Interpret &mdash; It's the same person)

:The aim of creating doppelgangers is to...

:'''Shikanoin Heizou:''' But, after the Tenryou commission secured the venue, the culprit appeared in Inazuma City so that the panic would spread.
:'''Kujou Sara:''' But, what is the end goal? Panic doesn't seem like enough of a motive...
:'''Shikanoin Heizou:''' You're right, panic is a means to an end. But, I think the shift to Inazuma City proves something... Whatever their goal, terrorizing one location wasn't enough...
:'''Shikanoin Heizou:''' And, since Inazuma City is their new target, the person they're impersonating at the festival... should be absent...

:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 kinkaku 05.ogg}} '''Kinkaku:''' ...We tricked him and ran!

:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 ginkaku 04.ogg}} '''Ginkaku:''' We've been using the horn to hide ever since... But, there are too many humans... It's getting harder to hide...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 mizuki 02.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' A horn full of youkai power... Could that be the source of the nightmares? The reason the bake-danuki are so afraid of humans?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 mizuki 03.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' If the horn contained the fragment of a nightmare, using its power to hide would spread the nightmare to them. That means, the bake-danuki have been trapped in this state of anxiety... for five hundred years...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 ioroi 09.ogg}} '''Ioroi:''' Hah, I could have told you nothing good would come from that horn... Using external power is against the Tanuki path!

:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 ginkaku 05.ogg}} '''Ginkaku:''' But... the horn helped us hide from the humans! The humans tried to take our land...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 raidenei 03.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...On the contrary, the purpose of the investigation was to determine in advance if youkai were present on the land in question.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 raidenei 04.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Whether we avoid encroaching on youkai territory altogether or attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, a peaceful resolution was always the goal.

:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 mizuki 04.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' That nature is what isolated them from the worst effects of the nightmare and prevented them from causing any real harm.

:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (A nightmare doesn't incapacitate someone with sufficient strength... It turns into something even worse...)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 raidenei 08.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...The nightmare twisted every joy in her life &mdash; her subordinates, family, and friends &mdash; into enemies in need of destruction.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 raidenei 09.ogg}} '''Ei:''' It was in that state, trapped in the battlefield of her mind, that she raised her sword against me on Mt. Yougou.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 raidenei 10.ogg}} '''Ei:''' With the Musou no Hitotachi, I cut off her arm, one of her horns, and a portion of the mountain itself... I suspect that is when the horn in question was buried there.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 06.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' And, subsequently, uncovered by three bake-danuki... That means the fragment on the horn... comes from Chiyo's nightmare.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 mizuki 06.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Nightmares feed on fear and anxiety. If what {{Traveler}} saw is true...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 mizuki 07.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' It's possible Kinkaku and the others' fear over the past five hundred years allowed the fragment to gain physical form and become something akin to a jibakurei.
:{{DIcon}} Jibakurei?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 mizuki 08.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' An earthbound spirit. They move through the [[Ley Line]]s, but are also bound by them. That's why the traces of this entity appeared intermittently, and never outside of Mt. Yougou.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 07.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' It would seem the fragment of this Nightmare is no different from the one back then... It hates all joy and every good thing in this world.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 08.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' The Investigation Team working for a better future? Attacked... Hitotsume Kozou and his friends, kind enough to lend a helping hand? Attacked...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, and we were attacked, too! Right when we were having fun with the play-testing...
:{{DIcon}} So, why hasn't it appeared since?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 raidenei 11.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Perhaps it needs to regain strength after your defeat... Or, perhaps it is biding its time because it knows, with whatever rationality remains, that it cannot defeat you...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 raidenei 12.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...But, sooner or later, its twisted hatred will force it out of hiding, and it will move to strike its "enemies."
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 raidenei 13.ogg}} '''Ei:''' When Chiyo set her sights on a target... She never was one to waver.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 09.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' ...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 raidenei 14.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...But, both possibilities prove something... Nightmare Fragments can be defeated.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 raidenei 15.ogg}} '''Ei:''' And an enemy that can be killed... is one that can be split in two by the power of Musou Isshin.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 mizuki 09.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' ...There's really no other way?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 raidenei 16.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Mikoshi Chiyo is gone. A fragment of a Nightmare tied to a severed horn... That is all that remains. The living must take precedent over the memory of the dead.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Even so, having to unleash Musou Isshin against her again? Would Ei really be okay?)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Mizuki said Archons suffer from the same turmoil as the rest of us... The dead may be gone, but that doesn't mean our emotions die with them...)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 10.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' ...Who cares about the dead, anyway?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 11.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' I'm just trying to look out for the living.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 raidenei 17.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...! What is that supposed to mean, Miko?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 12.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Oh, I'm just concerned about our poor bake-danuki friends...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 tetsunosuke 08.ogg}} '''Tetsunosuke:''' Huh? What does this have to do with us?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 13.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' The Nightmare Fragment has been tied to the bake-danuki for nearly five hundred years. Strike it down, and who's to say whether you take the lives of our poor friends along with it.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 ginkaku 08.ogg}} '''Ginkaku:''' EEEK!?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 ioroi 15.ogg}} '''Ioroi:''' I... I beseech you, Almighty Shogun! S&mdash;Spare the young ones! It was just a momentary... Or, uh, no... a five-hundred-year long lapse in judgement...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 raidenei 18.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Miko... You speak the truth?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 14a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 14b.ogg}}--> '''Yae Miko:''' If you don't believe me, ask Mizuki and {{Traveler}}. I'm sure they've encountered similar cases during their extensive travels...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 mizuki 10.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Well, I... Oh!
;(Miko, Mizuki, and the Traveler look at each other)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 mizuki 11.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' ...Yes! During my studies, both in [[Liyue]] and [[Natlan]]!
:{{DIcon}} Yeah! I've definitely seen that happen before!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 raidenei 19.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Then... What would you propose? This Nightmare Fragment is a constant threat to Inazuma. Should all other options fail... I will take action.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 mizuki 12.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' ...If the Fragment's hatred toward the world comes from a Nightmare, then the most logical option... is to get rid of the Nightmare itself...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right! Can't you just eat the Nightmare, Mizuki?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 raidenei 20.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...The Yumekui-Baku already tried that five hundred years ago. Even yesterday, when faced with the corruption of the Nightmare, Mizuki could only mitigate the effects.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 15.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' What was impossible back then... is not necessarily impossible now. I think Mizuki has the right idea. If we cannot eradicate the nightmares directly...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 16.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Why not use this entity's tricks against it? Combat illusions with illusions. Combat nightmares... with dreams.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is that even possible?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 17.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Don't forget &mdash; there are youkai that specialize in shapeshifting and illusions, and they happen to be right in front of us.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 kinkaku 09.ogg}} '''Kinkaku:''' Wh&mdash;Where? Kinkaku doesn't see them anywhere!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 tetsunosuke 09.ogg}} '''Tetsunosuke:''' Maybe they're hiding as trees? Or the wind?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 ioroi 16.ogg}} '''Ioroi:''' Fools! The kitsune is clearly referring to the bake-danuki! Tetsunosuke, Kinkaku, must you be so dense!?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 18.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Given their centuries-long connection to the Nightmare Fragment, they are perfectly positioned to create a dreamscape that the entity will be unable to distinguish from the real world.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 raidenei 21.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...Back then, the Nightmare had little to no weaknesses... If we want to give the bake-danuki an opportunity to strike, I assume you have a plan, Miko?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 19.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' You said it yourself &mdash; Mikoshi Chiyo is gone. All that remains is a fragment of her nightmare, already broken and vulnerable.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 20.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Besides... Mizuki is an old friend, one that is not to be underestimated. She has traveled the land studying dreams and is far more capable than those old fossils back then.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 mizuki 13.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Oh... Um...
:{{DIcon}} ...Not gonna say anything?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 mizuki 14.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' She just... usually doesn't compliment me to my face... But, Miko's right. If we work together, I'm confident we can put together a ritual to subdue the Nightmare Fragment.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 21.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Once we perform the ritual, it will take some time for the barrier to take effect. Luckily for us, we have two formidable warriors on our side...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 22.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' ...Our festival representative, who also happens to have extensive experience against dark forces, and the Almighty Shogun, unmatched in combat... I'm sure the two of you can buy us some time?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 mizuki 15.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' There's just one problem... Since this entity can pass through the Ley Lines, its movements are unpredictable. If we're going to create a barrier, how can we be sure it appears where we want?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 23.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Ah, the solution to that... is obvious. If the Nightmare Fragment despises all sources of joy and happiness...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 24.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Then, naturally, a joyous occasion would be an evil beyond measure &mdash; an enemy that must be annihilated at all costs...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 mizuki 16.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' So, if we want to lure it out...
:{{DIcon}} We need a source of joy.
:{{DIcon}} Then, the obvious target would be...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...The Mikawa Flower Festival!
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 25.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Hehe, what joy could possibly compare to finishing one's work right before the deadline?
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 raidenei 22.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...I would imagine we can all think of a few. But, I agree &mdash; the Mikawa Flower Festival is the most plausible target.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 raidenei 23.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Once the enemy appears, I will pull them into the Plane of Euthymia immediately... I will not put the people in danger.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 raidenei 24.ogg}} '''Ei:''' {{Traveler}}, I ask that you join me there so we can subdue the enemy together.
:{{DIcon}} Of course.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 26.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Alright, I will update everyone back at the festival and start the preparations for the ritual... I'll need your help, Mizuki. It's going to be a busy night.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 mizuki 17.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Looks like another all-nighter for me.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 yaemiko 27.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' ...Well, this was your idea. Oh, and don't forget &mdash; you need to finish "[[Enchanted Tales of the Mikawa Festival/A Little Fox's Daydream|A Little Fox's Daydream]]" as well.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 11 mizuki 18.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' ...And, in a surprising twist, you were my nightmare all along!

;(Talk to Ioroi or Yae Miko, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq002 yaemiko 01.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Well, Ioroi, as I see it, you've been punished long enough. It's about time you were released...
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq002 ioroi 01.ogg}} '''Ioroi:''' R&mdash;R&mdash;Released!? I can do that myself any time I want! This statue keeps me warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Don't interfere!
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq002 together 01.ogg}} '''Kinkaku, Ginkaku, and Tetsunosuke:''' Ioroi is the best!
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq002 ioroi 02.ogg}} '''Ioroi:''' ...Besides, the seal's power is almost gone... What I really want is for you to help me give [[Kitsune Saiguu|that sneaky kitsune]] a piece of my mind!
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq002 yaemiko 02.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' ...Ioroi, she's already&mdash;
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq002 ioroi 03.ogg}} '''Ioroi:''' Not so fast! I won't be fooled by your tricks again! Whatever you were about to say, she can tell me herself, instead of sending some young kitsune to hoodwink me!

;(Talk to Yumemizuki Mizuki, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq002 tetsunosuke 01.ogg}} '''Tetsunosuke:''' Great youkai really wasn't forced to work all night?
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq002 mizuki 01.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' That's right. It was my choice.
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq002 kinkaku 01.ogg}} '''Kinkaku:''' Why does great youkai have to work?
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq002 mizuki 02.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' ...I suppose it's just the price of becoming a great youkai.
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq002 ginkaku 01.ogg}} '''Ginkaku:''' Great youkai, Ginkaku is sad for you...

;(Talk to Ei)
:{{A|vo schjeq002 12 raidenei 01.ogg}} '''Ei:''' {{Traveler}}... During the battle tomorrow, it is imperative you know your limits. If the enemy proves too much to handle... leave them to me.
:{{DIcon}} But&mdash;
:{{A|vo schjeq002 12 raidenei 02.ogg}} '''Ei:''' I know... I understand your concerns, just as you know mine. We need not say any more than that. Just get some rest and prepare yourself for the battle to come.
:{{DIcon}} Okay.
:{{DIcon}} Get some rest, Ei.
:{{A|vo schjeq002 12 raidenei 03.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...
:{{A|vo schjeq002 12 raidenei 04.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Ah, one more thing... Thank you.
