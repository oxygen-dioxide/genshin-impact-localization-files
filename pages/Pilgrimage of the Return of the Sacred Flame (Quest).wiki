:{{A|vo ntaq001 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's still a little worried about Kachina, though. Maybe we can help her out with her training?
:{{A|vo ntaq001 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She did say she wanted to learn from us... Not that Paimon's gonna be doing much of the teaching...

:{{A|vo dialog ntaq001 lamanai 02.ogg}} '''Lamanai:''' Sometimes, the favorites are forced to face each other early on. Factoring in the environment and different participant strategies... It's impossible to predict who will come out on top.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq001 tonina 03.ogg}} '''Tonina:''' True, true. *sigh* You think I'd have a chance in the Pilgrimage one day? I've been training every day after work.

:{{A|vo dialog ntaq001 tlaco 01.ogg}} '''Tlaco:''' What, now?
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq001 sayil 03.ogg}} '''Sayil:''' Now's the perfect time! Knock back a few drinks, and you'll loosen right up. Otherwise, your nerves will keep you up all night. Trust me &mdash; I'm an experienced competitor.

:{{DIcon}} I want to help you do the best you can.
:{{A|vo ntaq001 10 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Wow, you guys are exactly like Kachina described. No wonder she's already your biggest fan.
:{{A|vo ntaq001 10 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Guess I should make myself scarce, though. Kachina was the one who helped you out all day, so I don't want to intrude on your secret teachings.
:{{DIcon}} It's just a simple piece of advice, actually.
:{{DIcon}} A battle is more than just a contest of strength.
:{{A|vo ntaq001 10 kachina 02.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Huh? What do you mean?
:{{DIcon}} Observation is also key.
:{{A|vo ntaq001 10 kachina 03.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Observation...
:{{DIcon}} Study your opponent. Master their habits.
:{{DIcon}} Let wisdom become another weapon in your arsenal.
:{{A|vo ntaq001 10 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! The person who hits the hardest isn't always the one who wins!

:{{A|vo ntaq001 10 kachina 05.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' You're saying... fight smarter not harder. Having the strength to win is just as important as knowing the right strategy.
:{{A|vo ntaq001 10 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Attagirl, Kachina. Exploit your opponent's weaknesses while maximizing your own strengths, and you're sure to find opportunities to turn the tides in your favor!
:{{A|vo ntaq001 10 kachina 06.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' You're right. I just need to focus. When I get nervous, I forget to assess the situation, and end up rushing in without a plan...
:{{A|vo ntaq001 10 kachina 07.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Mind sticking around a little longer, Mualani? I want to try out some new moves!

:{{A|vo ntaq002 2 balam 01.ogg}} '''[[Balam]]:''' The Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame is a competition with a long, storied history. Countless hopefuls have gathered here today, each vying for the same prize &mdash; the right to serve their homeland in the Night Warden Wars.
:{{A|vo ntaq002 2 balam 02.ogg}} '''Balam:''' Before we begin, allow me to remind everyone of the rules. Today's tournament begins with the team stage, before advancing into individual competition.
<!--animated graphic-->
:{{A|vo ntaq002 2 balam 03.ogg}} '''Balam:''' Each team will board a hot-air balloon, which will land at a random location.
:{{A|vo ntaq002 2 balam 04.ogg}} '''Balam:''' Contestants must search for Fire Towers within the contest grounds, accumulate Contending Fire through combat, and bring a sufficient amount back to the Stadium.
:{{A|vo ntaq002 2 balam 05.ogg}} '''Balam:''' Defeat in combat, departure from the contest grounds, and running out of time all lead to elimination! Only the strongest teams will be able to withstand the onslaught of battle and return to the arena, blazing Fire in hand.
<!--changes to another animated graphic-->
:{{A|vo ntaq002 2 balam 06.ogg}} '''Balam:''' Only those who emerge triumphant in the team stage earn the right to take part in the individual battles. The outcome of these one-on-one matches not only affects the contestants' individual scores but also determines their next opponent.
:{{A|vo ntaq002 2 balam 07.ogg}} '''Balam:''' After many rounds of battle, the contestants with the top five rankings will get the chance to take part in the Night Warden Wars!
:{{A|vo ntaq002 2 balam 08.ogg}} '''Balam:''' Now, let us welcome our Archon as she delivers the opening address!

:{{A|vo ntaq002 2 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Today marks the beginning of yet another legendary saga &mdash; one written in the triumphs of the victors! So, without further ado... Let the games begin!
:{{A|vo ntaq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, that's the [[Pyro Archon]]!? Is it just Paimon, or does she seem kinda intimidating...?
:{{A|vo ntaq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kachina said she was "friendly and welcoming, " but, uh... how did she come to that conclusion?
:{{DIcon}} She does seem pretty imposing.
::{{A|vo ntaq002 2 paimon 03a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Didn't Kachina say she was just an ordinary person before becoming the Archon? Sure doesn't seem like it...
::{{A|vo ntaq002 2 paimon 03a 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She doesn't seem ordinary at all... Ooh, look, it's Kachina and the others!
:{{DIcon}} I want to talk to her.
::{{A|vo ntaq002 2 paimon 03b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, but it would be kinda rude to bother her during the Pilgrimage, don't you think?
::{{A|vo ntaq002 2 paimon 03b 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We should wait for a better time... Ooh, look! It's Kachina and the others!
:{{A|vo ntaq002 2 balam 09.ogg}} '''Balam:''' Well, folks, it's clear the contestants are already raring to go! The teams will now board their hot-air balloons and make their way to the competition grounds.

:{{A|vo ntaq002 2 balam 11.ogg}} '''Balam:''' Remember the rules! The balloons will take you to random locations, and your battle starts the moment you land. Best your competition, collect Sacred Fire, and bring it back to the Stadium.

:{{A|vo ntaq002 3 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Let's head that way. We don't need to worry about avoiding other teams. Anyone that crosses our path can kiss their chances goodbye!

:{{A|vo ntaq002 3 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Just remember &mdash; don't hesitate. The team matches are all about keeping the energy up, so let's do it!

:{{A|vo ntaq002 4 amuru 01.ogg}} '''Amuru:''' Oh? Well, aren't you two an interesting duo.
:{{A|vo ntaq002 4 kachina 02.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' How did these monsters make it onto the grounds...
:{{A|vo ntaq002 4 amuru 02.ogg}} '''Amuru:''' It's part of the tournament. If you can't handle a few monsters, how are you supposed to repel the Abyss.
:{{A|vo ntaq002 4 amuru 03.ogg}} '''Amuru:''' Look, why don't we handle these monsters first. Then, we can battle it out between ourselves.

;(Defeat the hilichurls)
:{{A|vo ntaq002 4 amuru 04.ogg}} '''Amuru:''' Huh, your skills aren't half-bad... But, I think I've got a good grasp of what you can do.

;(Approach the mountain)
:{{A|vo ntaq002 4 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' This mountain is huge. Is the next Tower really all the way up there?
:{{A|vo ntaq002 4 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' It's going to take forever to make it to the top...
:{{A|vo ntaq002 4 kachina 04.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Just leave it to me! I'll get us up there!

;(Defeat Kwila's team, optional)
:{{A|vo ntaq002 4 labna 03.ogg}} '''Labna:''' Every minute that passes, fewer and fewer contestants remain in play! The remaining competitors need to hurry if they want to make it out of this stage!

:{{A|vo ntaq002 4 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Isn't it obvious? To send them all packing, of course!

:{{A|vo ntaq002 5 tonina 07.ogg}} '''Tonina:''' That's enough, you two. "Being caught off-guard" is not an excuse. You think you can cry foul play when you face the [[Abyss]]?

:{{A|vo ntaq002 5 tonina 09.ogg}} '''Tonina:''' Yes. It was nothing out of the ordinary &mdash; a couple of sore losers coming to stir up trouble with the contestants.
:{{A|vo ntaq002 5 lamanai 04.ogg}} '''Lamanai:''' *sigh* Some people are so obsessed with glory, they can't even bear the idea of failure.
:{{A|vo ntaq002 5 lamanai 05.ogg}} '''Lamanai:''' I hope you don't let them get to you, Kachina, because you'll need to get ready. Your match is up soon.

:{{A|vo ntaq002 7 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I did, too, but it is what it is. People with similar scores tend to get matched against each other.
:{{A|vo ntaq002 7 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' But, we just have to get past it! War is cruel, and the Abyss certainly isn't going to go easy on us. Only Natlan's strongest deserve to stand against them.
