==Profile==
Clitopho originally studied alchemy at [[Mondstadt]] before he became a Treasure Hoarder to pursue the freedom that he sought. He later moved to [[The Chasm]] where he sold the local miners fake medicine labeled as "Real Man's Meds" under the alias "Toclipho".

He would eventually be imprisoned by his fellow Treasure Hoarders due ditching the group that was sent up to steal food and then releasing all of the [[Weasel Thieves]]. The Traveler and [[Zhiqiong]] would later find him about to be punished by [[Erge]] and freed him. Clitopho agreed to help the group as he had nowhere to go and sought to redeem himself, being genuinely regretful for joining the Treasure Hoarders.

;(At the first and second underground camp)
:'''Clitopho:''' Thanks for saving me! I was beginning to think that I might become dog food at this rate...
:{{DIcon}} You lot keep dogs?
:{{DIcon}} Ah, what a shame that we don't keep dogs either.
:'''Clitopho:''' Hey now, that's not a good joke.
:{{DIcon}} And how did you end up in this sorry state?
:'''Clitopho:''' Me? I was helping Erge out... But I screwed up and got chucked into this cage.
:{{DIcon}} And who's this Erge?
::'''Clitopho:''' Him? He's from Mingyun Village. Used to work over there. After they ran the ore veins dry, he came to The Chasm. Did pretty well too. Made foreman, I believe.
::'''Clitopho:''' Then... you know the story. The Chasm went "woosh," and the miners went "whoa," and the Ministry of Civil Affairs did a "Hmm? Hmm? Hmm?"
::'''Clitopho:''' And the Qixing bigwigs did a "ahem-ahem!" and the Millelith came and went "hmph-hmph-hmph!"
::'''Paimon:''' What the heck is this guy saying?
::{{DIcon}} Try speaking the common tongue, please.
::'''Clitopho:''' Well, in the end, the mine was closed and the miners went out of work. And when miners get put out of a job, what do you think they'll do they do to make ends meet, hmm?
::'''Clitopho:''' Well, what I'm saying is Erge was an experienced miner who barely ever saw the light of day in his life, and who had just made foreman at 40... and then suddenly, it was all gone!
::'''Clitopho:''' So, what would he do, and where?
::'''Paimon:''' Uh, join... the Treasure Hoarders?
::'''Clitopho:''' Exactly! See, now you're thinking like a Hoarder!
::'''Clitopho:''' But lemme give you some sage advice: it might be best not to do anything illegal. The Treasure Hoarders aren't good people, no, not at all. And there's no going back once you've gone too far into a life of crime...
::'''Paimon:''' Uh-huh, that's right... Paimon won't ever become a Treasure Hoarder...
::'''Paimon:''' —Which is pretty rich, coming from you!
::'''Clitopho:''' Hahahaha! I mean... Well, let's not joke about this anymore. In any case, what I meant to say was that people don't necessarily join the Treasure Hoarders because of some inherent evil in their hearts.
::'''Clitopho:''' But for Erge, the compensation from the Ministry of Civil Affairs should have been enough to let him start over in an honest profession, and yet he chose this path.
::'''Clitopho:''' I guess to each his own, huh? Maybe some people just can't take the pain in the short term, and choose a perilous road of bringing others pain instead. Perhaps this is what we'd call "the other side of freedom" back in Mondstadt.
:{{DIcon}} So, tell me about, well, you.
::'''Clitopho:''' Me? Just me? I'm no one important.
::'''Clitopho:''' I'm from Mondstadt, and I haven't been a Hoarder long, nor have I been in Liyue long. I just came with a few senior members to get some ore.
::'''Clitopho:''' I was following Erge around, doing some errands, helping them sneak around a bit, contacting our comrades down in the mines... and then, you know, I got caught by you while doing those things.
::'''Paimon:''' That's not correct. You were in this cage well before we caught you doing anything.
::'''Clitopho:''' *sigh* Well, I mucked up on one of my tasks, which caused our lads to get ambushed by someone...
::{{DIcon}} Now that was us.
::'''Paimon:''' Ehe...
::'''Clitopho:''' So that was really... I knew it was you!
::'''Paimon:''' Oh, it was nothing...
::'''Paimon:''' And anyway, we didn't know how you'd get involved in the whole thing, either.
::'''Clitopho:''' Ugh... Anyway, I was sent by Erge to keep watch on our Weasel Thieves after that... And I made another mistake in allowing them to run amok. They stole all our stuff...
::'''Paimon:''' Pfft... Hahaha!
::'''Clitopho:''' Yes, yes, keep laughing. Just make sure your stomach stays in one piece while you're at it... Ugh, that was embarrassing.
::'''Clitopho:''' Still after that, Erge sent me down to find some secret passage. I did find it.. and then the earthquake happened! Nearly buried us all alive, too!
::{{DIcon}} You know what? I think... that might have been us, too.
::'''Paimon:''' Ooh, that's right! That must've happened when we destroyed... uh, unsealed the Bedrock Keys. It was a pretty big earthquake, too!
::'''Clitopho:''' And if Erge was mad at me before, now he was absolutely hopping mad!
::'''Clitopho:''' "You worthless piece of trash! I'll bet the Millelith sent you here to sabotage us, didn't they?"
::'''Clitopho:''' "And you did wreck us, didn't you? Let our Weasel Thieves run off, did you? Boys, put him in the Weasel Thief cage! We'll settle scores with him once we're done with this transaction!"
::'''Clitopho:''' ...That's what he said.
::'''Clitopho:''' And then he locked me in this cage. Might have forgotten to mention that.
::'''Paimon:''' Ahahahaha! Paimon almost feels bad for Erge!
::'''Clitopho:''' Well, yes, he did get slapped around by the two of you. Twice.
::'''Clitopho:''' Not... not that I'm feeling sorry for him, of course! I'm just glad that you came to my rescue. I'd be dead meat otherwise.

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(At the surface camp)
:'''Clitopho:''' Why hello there, (Traveler)!
:'''Clitopho:''' Let's have a drink to slake our thirsts. My treat!
:{{DIcon}} Thanks.
::'''Clitopho:''' No need, just tell me whenever you need some refreshment!
:{{DIcon}} Why are you here?
::'''Clitopho:''' I was sent up here by Jinwu. The Millelith might be sending a batch of blasting equipment over here soon, but she's busy at the campsite and can't leave at the moment.
:{{DIcon}} How have you been recently?
:'''Clitopho:''' Oh, neither good nor bad, really. But at least I no longer have any regrets.
:'''Clitopho:''' Back when I was studying alchemy in Mondstadt, I believed that even overly-ordinary children like myself could reach our dreams.
:'''Clitopho:''' But as I studied, I realized that there are some gulfs that cannot be bridged, and some people who cannot be caught up to.
:'''Clitopho:''' That's when I realized that alchemy is really for those who either have immense talent or resources.
:'''Clitopho:''' The color of my dreams... they just weren't the same as theirs.
:{{DIcon}} And that's why you joined the Treasure Hoarders?
:'''Clitopho:''' *sigh* Well, I wasn't going to accept a lifetime of mediocrity, that's for sure. And I mean, there are those fated to do good, and those fated to do evil in this world, right?
:{{DIcon}} Do you still believe that?
:'''Clitopho:''' Heh. Alright... Stop scolding me, you're starting to sound like Jinwu. And yes, I know I was wrong...
:'''Clitopho:''' Jinwu talked to me about this as well, and she had the right of it for sure...
:'''Clitopho:''' "Whether it's those who received the gods' favor, or those who are just lucky... They're like proud birds with their wings spread wide, living for themselves, looking far out into the distance."
:'''Clitopho:''' "As for the places that they don't see, and the places they won't go, well, those are for people like us to build up, to watch over, to defend..."
:{{DIcon}} It sure beats being a bandit and hurting others.
:'''Clitopho:''' Yeah... Becoming a Treasure Hoarder and all that... all I did in chasing such selfish freedom was bringing misfortune on myself.
:'''Clitopho:''' And while the things we're doing right now are ordinary, they have impact beyond us or even people around us.
:'''Clitopho:''' I mean... Someone's got to do this job, and we ordinary people just happen to be here, right?
:'''Clitopho:''' Regardless, thank you both very much for helping me understand that ordinary work is not meaningless.
:'''Clitopho:''' Phew, alright. Let's cut the chatter about pointless stuff. What say you to a drink? I've still got loads of "Real Man's Meds" on me, you know?
:'''Paimon:''' Come on! Are you seriously still trying to sell us fake medicine?
;(Obtain [[Wolfhook Juice]])

;(Talk again)
:'''Clitopho:''' Why hello there, (Traveler)!
:'''Clitopho:''' I'm very sorry, but Muning's glaring at me again. I don't think I'll be able to chat long. There's still a lot of odd errands to do.
:{{DIcon}} About Zhiqiong...{{Verify|Unlock condition}}
<!-- This doesn't show up immediately after Valor's Afterglow: The Faint Light Remembered. Probably need to wait for a while (daily reset). -->
::'''Clitopho:''' She's not a bad person, but she's far too obstinate. I don't know why she's in such a hurry, too. If it were me, I would be ducking for cover at the first sign of danger.
::'''Clitopho:''' *sigh* Never mind. I just pray for her safety.
:{{DIcon}} See you. Good luck out there.
::'''Clitopho:''' See you! *sigh* Ah, this stuff is becoming quite the headache...
