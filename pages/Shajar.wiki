==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Shajar:''' I'm still conducting inspections, so if you have something to say, quick and simple's best.
:{{DIcon}} And you are...?
::'''Shajar:''' I'm an officer of general affairs here at Bayda Harbor. Call me Shajar, or Boss. Either's fine.
::'''Shajar:''' I'm not the sort to insist on honorifics. People should win respect through their actions.
:{{DIcon}} About Bayda Harbor...
::'''Shajar:''' Bayda Harbor's a place where many influential forces criss-cross, but the peace has been kept so far &mdash; it's my job to make sure everyone stays in their corner, after all.
::'''Shajar:''' So don't worry. Ordinary smugglers know better than to try anything cute here.
::{{DIcon}} That's amazing.
:::'''Shajar:''' It's just my job. Some people don't trust my origins, and if there's one thing I hate above all, it's doubters.
:::'''Shajar:''' Oh yeah, I almost forgot. I used to be an [[Eremite]] Mercenary... and then I accepted the [[Akademiya]]'s employment offer. So now I run things here.
:::'''Shajar:''' No difference between those jobs, if you ask me. "Get paid," "do stuff," and tack on a little "don't mess with me." Easy game.
:::'''Shajar:''' Judging by your looks, you're that sort of person yourself, I'll wager?
:::{{DIcon}} Uh...
::::'''Shajar:''' Alright, that's enough chit-chat. I've got duties to get back to.
::{{DIcon}} How about big-time smugglers?
:::'''Shajar:''' If you mean the local Eremites, I was one of 'em once. I know how they do things.
:::'''Shajar:''' As for those smugglers from [[Liyue]] and [[Fontaine]]...
:::'''Shajar:''' Hmph. I'd be tipped off well before they could move a muscle, and I'd know their movements like the back of my hand.
:::{{DIcon}} Secret letter?
::::'''Shajar:''' Well, we've got too many outlanders here in Bayda Harbor, so some... diplomatic measures are necessary.
::::'''Shajar:''' I've got "friends" in [[Lumidouce Harbor]] and [[Yilong Wharf]], so we exchange tips and such. Good deal as far as I'm concerned.
::::'''Shajar:''' *sigh* I'd originally come here to relax a bit. Didn't think this place would be as busy as [[Port Ormos]]...
:{{DIcon}} Actually, it's nothing.
::'''Shajar:''' Well, no news is good news. See you.
