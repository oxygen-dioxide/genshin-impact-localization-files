{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nasrin:''' Do... Need... Something? ...Tell.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Nasrin/A Day in the Forest Ranger's Life|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Nasrin:''' Feels like you need to read the Genius Invokation TCG rulebook again...
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Nasrin:''' Wasn't that complicated enough...
:{{DIcon}} Uh... Hello?
::'''Nasrin:''' Ah, sorry... Was my voice too soft for you to hear clearly?
::'''Nasrin:''' *cough*
::'''Nasrin:''' I said, do you need something? Please, do tell.
::{{DIcon}} Did I disturb you?
::'''Nasrin:''' It's not your fault. It's just an old habit of mine that's acting up.
::'''Nasrin:''' I'm used to speaking softly because I hunt frequently and sometimes meet researchers training in the forest. It's taking me some time to speak normally again.
::'''Nasrin:''' Many mistake me for an introvert because of that, and they are really careful when they talk to me.
::'''Nasrin:''' It isn't necessary at all. Please talk to me normally.
::{{DIcon}} About the researchers...
::'''Nasrin:''' Oh, while there aren't many of them, and they are usually in hidden spots, you'll still meet them if you stay in Avidya Forest all the time.
::'''Nasrin:''' Honestly, I'm not really sure of the specifics of the principle.
::'''Nasrin:''' I only know that this situation is called something like... Savada Life? It's a special stage in the training of researchers, during which they can't be disturbed.
::'''Nasrin:''' So, I sometimes worry that that inexperienced Trainee Forest Ranger will disturb those Akademiya researchers.
::'''Nasrin:''' Hmm... Still, since she's with the Forest Watchers, I doubt she'll be as reckless as someone who's never read the Rainforest Survival Guide in their lives.
:{{DIcon}} Good... bye?
::'''Nasrin:''' ...Bye.
