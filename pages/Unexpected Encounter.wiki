:{{A|vo mdaq038 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The dragon and the crystal weren't the only things we saw.
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to investigate it on my own first.
:{{DIcon}} I don't think he's a bad guy.
:{{A|vo mdaq038 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you do remember him, that green guy.
:{{A|vo mdaq038 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He looked just like that guy down there!
:{{DIcon}} The exact same shade of green, what a coincidence.
::{{A|vo mdaq038 1 paimon 05a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' See? See?
::{{A|vo mdaq038 1 paimon 05a 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait... Hold on a minute... That...
::{{A|vo mdaq038 1 paimon 05a 3.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's the same guy!
