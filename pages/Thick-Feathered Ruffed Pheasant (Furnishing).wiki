|description    = A medium-sized bird that can be found in [[Natlan]]. It wears a luxurious coat of brilliant green feathers, seemingly with a delicate, silky ruff, while its tail feathers are as gorgeous as budding flowers.<br>This bird's robust physique, coupled with the bountiful food supply in The Realm Within, exacerbated its already poor flying abilities, making even walking a challenge. Despite [[Tubby]]'s best efforts to encourage the most active birds to exercise with them, the results were negligible. Thus, Tubby is resigned to the fact that these birds probably have to be nurtured as "winged potted plants"...
