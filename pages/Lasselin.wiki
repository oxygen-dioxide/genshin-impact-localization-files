==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Lasselin:''' Now, listen here...
:'''Lasselin:''' Huh? You're... I'm sorry, I shouldn't have spoken to you like that. Now, what would you like?
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Duel
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Lasselin/Another Sort of "Good Wine"|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Lasselin:''' What a pity, I seem to have won... But don't lose heart. Perhaps you'd like to take a look at some of our tavern's "good wine"?
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Lasselin:''' Oh no, I lost! But it was just a game of cards &mdash; it doesn't mean I can sell you our special "good wine."
:{{DIcon}} What have you heard?
::'''Lasselin:''' You caught that, eh? Fine. It's nothing important anyway, just stuff you'd hear every day in this tavern.
::'''Lasselin:''' Like, some people are willing to pay a lot of money to hire some help, while others want to sell certain goods quickly...
::'''Lasselin:''' Of course, a big shot like you is often mentioned by the guests... But don't you worry! I'm not one to go around telling others your business.
::'''Lasselin:''' After all, if you want the details from me, then you have to... Well, you know.
::{{DIcon}} Wait, have you heard anything about me?
::'''Lasselin:''' Oh, there have been plenty of stories about you &mdash; your adventures, the enemies you've defeated, the treasures you've obtained, and the titles you've earned.
::'''Lasselin:''' Heck if I know how true they are. Perhaps they're nothing more than drunken ramblings.
::'''Lasselin:''' However, if you're interested in these rumors, or if you want to hear some... other stories from me...
::'''Lasselin:''' Well... you know.
::{{DIcon}} How much Mora?
::'''Lasselin:''' Mora? Th&mdash;That's okay too.
::'''Lasselin:''' But if you're using Mora, you'll need to buy more good wine. After all... the information I possess is very valuable. I could sell it for a small fortune.
::'''Lasselin:''' However, if you really want to buy "good wine," then please speak with [[Pitot|the helmsman]]. I'll be in trouble if I handle Mora.
::{{DIcon}} If your information is so valuable, why not work for yourself?
::'''Lasselin:''' I... I'm afraid of trouble, and working in this tavern is great! Really great. It's safe, comfortable, and there are even free drinks!
::'''Lasselin:''' But most importantly, as long as I'm here then no one will dare come bother me, and I won't be forced to go bother anyone else...
::'''Lasselin:''' Anyway, if you really want to buy "good wine," then please speak with the helmsman.
:{{DIcon}} Do you work here?
::'''Lasselin:''' That's right! I'm a waitre... Ahem, I mean the Chief Mate. Though it's kinda the same job as a waitress...
::'''Lasselin:''' The reason for using titles like this is because Mr. Pitot said it would help with navigating the waves of the business world.
::'''Lasselin:''' He said himself that a client from [[Liyue]] taught him how to pray for luck by giving auspicious names like this.
::'''Lasselin:''' But I reckon... that he didn't quite grasp what they were trying to teach him.
:{{DIcon}} Bye.
::'''Lasselin:''' Bye! Hope... hope you have a nice day...
