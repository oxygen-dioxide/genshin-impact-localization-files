{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Everallin:''' Hello there. The wind and the waves are both placid today. That makes for less stories, but at least people will sail in safety.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Everallin/Defensive Strategizing|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Everallin:''' Though holding the cards isn't easy, this is really fun!
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Everallin:''' It's so tough to hold the cards, and matches are so complicated. Ugh...
:{{DIcon}} Stories?
::'''Everallin:''' The harbor is not a place where waters and ships cross paths, but also one where stories gather.
::'''Everallin:''' Many tourists, merchants, and even lovers of books from the [[Sumeru|land of deserts and rainforests]] come here.
::'''Everallin:''' Many people love chatting with me, because that would be the first time they've ever met a Melusine.
::'''Everallin:''' Thanks to everyone, I've also heard lots of stories from beyond these waters. It's great working here.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the sea.
::'''Everallin:''' Observing the sea is my job, and I love it. While I'm around, you've nothing to fear from storms or showers &mdash; I'll warn everyone ahead of time.
::'''Everallin:''' Oh, right, I didn't say so earlier, but I'm a Melusine &mdash; according to Monsieur [[Neuvillette]], we have a deep connection to the ocean.
::'''Everallin:''' And even amongst us, I'm one of the best at sensing the ocean's movements. That's why I've been assigned to work here.
::'''Everallin:''' I just need to report on said movements and I don't have to wander out into the deep seas, so it's a pretty comfy job.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Deep sea...
:::'''Everallin:''' To be honest, I am not sure if my understanding of the sea's depth is the same as that which human beings sense.
:::'''Everallin:''' All I know is, diving is difficult for most human beings, and requires a heavy set of clothing and a lot of training.
:::'''Everallin:''' Do you know how to dive? It's okay if you don't. I brought these from the sea, and I want to share them with you.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Beryl Conch|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} It does seem like a nice gig.
::'''Everallin:''' Yup, I think so too.
