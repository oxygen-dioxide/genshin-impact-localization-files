There once was a traveler, stranded in the desert and dying of thirst, who in desperation prayed for a Hydro Slime to come their way. But the traveler didn't realize that at that very moment, a starving Hydro Slime was praying to meet a lone, stranded traveler... What, not funny? Tsk, I think it's hysterical.

|vo_06_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Us - The Present.ogg

|vo_07_01_friendship = 4
|vo_07_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About the Vision.ogg
|vo_07_01_tx         = You may say that I have received much divine favor, with the spirit that dwells within me, and the god that took heed of my ambition. But I have no intention of letting this affect my code of justice. I will simply continue to do whatever is required to fulfill my duty.

|vo_07_02_title      = Something to Share: Lust for Knowledge
|vo_07_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share - Lust for Knowledge.ogg
|vo_07_02_tx         = I think most people understand that an excess of desire will lead to disaster, but people seldom admit that when it comes to the pursuit of knowledge, they're only willing to put it in a positive light. In my opinion, chasing after knowledge is still a form of desire, and must also be reined in.

|vo_07_03_title      = Something to Share: Solemn Respect
|vo_07_03_friendship = 4
|vo_07_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share - Solemn Respect.ogg
|vo_07_03_tx         = Any decision I make during a mission can have a profound effect on the fates of others. This is why I must always maintain a solemn respect for my position as a matra, the same way I respect knowledge and power.

|vo_07_04_title      = Interesting Things
|vo_07_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} Interesting Things.ogg
|vo_07_04_tx         = I'm fond of the shrubs that grow in the desert. The desert is a symbol of repose and solitude, and all civilizations will eventually be buried by a sandstorm. But despite these desolate conditions, there are still signs of growth. Sometimes, I really find myself impressed by their tenacity.

<!-- About Teammates -->

|vo_08_01_friendship = 4
|vo_08_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Tighnari - Knowledge.ogg
|vo_08_01_tx         = Tighnari is different from other scholars I've met. He has the same wholehearted dedication to knowledge, but he will never cross the most important boundaries. Some scholars see themselves as gods within their own laboratories, but not Tighnari &mdash; he has always shown the same respect for every form of life. I've heard that he even declined a position in the Akademiya, and I support his decision.
|vo_08_01_mention    = Tighnari

|vo_08_02_friendship = 4
|vo_08_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Tighnari - Jokes.ogg
|vo_08_02_tx         = Tighnari once told me not to tell jokes at the dinner table, insisting that my jokes weren't funny at all. I did not share his opinion, so I told three of my best jokes in a row, and explained the premise of each in great detail. By the time I was done talking, my food was cold.
|vo_08_02_mention    = Tighnari

|vo_08_03_friendship = 4
|vo_08_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Collei.ogg
|vo_08_03_tx         = I once helped Collei seal away the god's remains in her body, but the process was an unthinkably painful one. To many, enduring that kind of pain would be a prospect more terrifying than death, so it was very admirable that she was able to persevere through it all.
|vo_08_03_mention    = Collei

|vo_08_04_title      = About [[Alhaitham]]
|vo_08_04_friendship = 4
|vo_08_04_quest      = King Deshret and the Three Magi
|vo_08_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Alhaitham.ogg
|vo_08_04_tx         = I don't really like people who are too smart. They think they can control everything, and constantly venture to the fringes of danger. But Alhaitham is one of the more reliable ones. In most cases, he is actually in control of things and has the ability to avert potential disaster.
|vo_08_04_mention    = Alhaitham

|vo_08_05_tx         = Tighnari and Collei never said it to my face, but they found Kaveh's personal anecdotes far more entertaining than the jokes I had prepared... I could see it on their faces. Hmm? What did I think about that? Well, I thought it was funny that they could laugh at such a situation.
|vo_08_05_mention    = Tighnari,Collei,Kaveh

|vo_08_06_title      = About [[Nahida]]

|vo_08_06_quest      = Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises
|vo_08_06_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Nahida.ogg
|vo_08_06_tx         = Commenting on a god might be overstepping my position a little... But when I was working with her, I personally witnessed her wisdom, courage, and determination. Compared with those sages who constantly undermined and criticized her without a shred of evidence, I think I can provide a more reliable assessment: She is an exceptional deity who is worthy of everyone's respect.
|vo_08_06_mention    = Nahida

|vo_08_07_title      = About [[Nilou]]

|vo_08_08_friendship = 4
|vo_08_08_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Faruzan.ogg
|vo_08_08_tx         = I've carefully browsed through the case files regarding Faruzan's disappearance. At the time, I thought maybe she had been conducting some kind of dangerous research, but once I met her in person, I completely abandoned that idea. Though it might be a little hard for me to get along with her, she mostly reminds me of a kindly and chatty parent. She is considerate of others, and would never do anything imprudent.
|vo_08_08_mention    = Faruzan

|vo_08_09_title      = About [[Lisa]]
|vo_08_09_friendship = 4
|vo_08_09_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Lisa.ogg
|vo_08_09_tx         = Of course I know about Lisa, we once both studied under the same sage. As General Mahamatra, I've seen many tragedies befall those seeking knowledge too assiduously, so it's easy for me to understand her decision.
|vo_08_09_mention    = Lisa

|vo_09_01_tx         = Huh? You want to know more about me? Hm, I suppose many people see me as a thorn in their side... But don't worry, as long as you don't do anything dangerous, you won't have any trouble with me.

|vo_09_02_tx         = With my body as a vessel, I can harness the power of the spirit that dwells within me. This is possible in part due to my natural constitution, but also due to a deal I willingly made in the past. There's no reason to shy away from the topic. If I am to weigh the souls of others in this world as a Matra, then I must also place my own soul on the scales to be judged in the same manner.

|vo_09_03_tx         = Rather than thinking about the "why" of things, I prefer to focus on "what" has been done. There are countless reasons why people do things in this world, and upon hearing some of those reasons, you can't help but start to feel that the wrongdoer had a point, or that the public is being too harsh on them. The disadvantaged side will always garner people's sympathy, but the judge must abandon all such feelings. We may empathize with the pain and motivations of the accused, but a crime, once committed, cannot be left unpunished.

|vo_09_04_tx         = In the gloomy sea of ignorance, a faint glimmer of light will occasionally appear, luring those who do not understand the truth toward it. People will often see that glimmer as a beacon to guide their way, but in doing so overlook the great dangers still lurking in the pitch-black waters. Steering those who have long resided in darkness away from the light is a cruel thing in itself, but I must continue to do so until we can finally defeat the enemies that lay hidden beneath the water's surface.

Alright, let's hear your questions. For someone who is used to interrogating others, the feeling of being questioned is... interesting.

|vo_10_01_tx         = In my free time, I like to play Genius Invokation TCG with other people. Being able to express so much creativity and variation within a working rule set makes it more than just a game &mdash; it's an art form.

|vo_10_02_friendship = 6
|vo_10_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Troubles.ogg
|vo_10_02_tx         = Just recently, I saw a light novel from [[Inazuma]] based on Genius Invokation TCG. When the main character found themselves in a rough spot, they somehow drew a card that wasn't even supposed to exist. This shook me to the core, and presented me with a great conundrum: Through directly manipulating the deck, they were able to pull off a miracle that nobody could have expected. The question is... should it be seen as breaking the rules, or is this, too, ultimately within the rules of the game?

Though I don't have much experience with celebrations, once I realized your birthday was coming, I decided to make some preparations. First, I have this deck for you that I worked on for a few days, I think it'll really suit your style. Also, I adjusted my schedule to open up some time, so is there anywhere you'd like to go?
