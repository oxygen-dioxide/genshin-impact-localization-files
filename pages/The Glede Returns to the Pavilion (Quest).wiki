{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's time to carry out the plan!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go find Gaming. Hope everything goes well.

;(Talk to Gaming)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hi Gaming! Paimon sees you've certainly gotten an early start this morning! Playing games already, are we?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who won this time? You the one buying dim sum again?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 2 gaming 01.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Hey, when you put it like that, it makes it sound like I'm always the one losing...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 2 longzhou 01.ogg}} '''Longzhou:''' Ah! Perfect, you're all here! There's an important commission I need your help with.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 2 gaming 02.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Alright, I've got the time. Where are the goods?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 2 longzhou 02.ogg}} '''Longzhou:''' It's not just goods this time. I need you to escort a tea merchant and their wares from Qiaoying Village to Liyue Harbor. A very important client has requested to meet with him.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 2 gaming 03.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Sure. What's this merchant's address?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 2 longzhou 03.ogg}} '''Longzhou:''' Here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 2 gaming 04.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Uh...!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If the client's that important, then this must be a very crucial, very pressing commission, right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 2 longzhou 04.ogg}} '''Longzhou:''' Um... Of course, the sooner you complete it the better. I would advise you to depart as soon as possible.
:{{DIcon}} That's fine by me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 2 gaming 05.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' ...Haah.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 2 gaming 06.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Alright. Don't work too hard now, Longzhou. We'll set off then.

;(Approach Qiaoying Village)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're a bit quiet today, Gaming. Do you want Paimon to tell a story?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 3 gaming 01.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' We're almost there... I'll take a raincheck on that.

;(Approach Yip Tak)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hello! You must be the tea merchant heading to Liyue Harbor. We're here to escort you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 4 yede 01.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 4 gaming 01.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' ...Dad.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 4 yede 02.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! So you're Gaming's father. It's nice to meet you!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just leave this delivery to him. Trust Paimon, he's got this in the bag. Gaming is super good at what he does!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Everyone at the Secure Transport Agency says as much. Even the Ministry of Civil Affairs has nothing but good things to say about him.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 4 yede 03.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' ...Seems like you've made some sort of name for yourself, at least.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 4 gaming 02.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 4 gaming 03.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' The... The goods are all in order?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 4 yede 04.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Yes. They're all here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 4 gaming 04.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Then let's get going.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 4 yede 05.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A very important client has asked for you by name. You kinda have to come with us.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't know how we would explain ourselves if you just didn't show up. Plus, you'd be missing out on a huge money-making opportunity.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 4 yede 06.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' ...I see.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 4 yede 07.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' I suppose I will have to trouble you all to escort me then. Let's go.
----
;(Approach Wangshu Inn)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've been walking for so long. Is anyone tired? How about we stop and rest for a bit?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 5 yede 01.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' I'm fine.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Gaming, don't you usually have some delicious snacks on you? C'mon, bring 'em out so we can share 'em!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 5 yede 02.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' I'm fine, thank you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh? But the Winter Melon Cake he gave us last time was so delicious! Have you ever tried it before, Mr. Yip?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 5 gaming 01.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Paimon...

;(Approach the resting point)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 gaming 01.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Here, this place looks nice and open. Why don't you all rest here for a second?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What about you? You're not going to join us?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 gaming 02.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' I'm not tired. I'll keep watch.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? But...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 yede 01.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Just let him go.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay. We'll just share amongst ourselves then. Did you know, Uncle Yip, that the flavor of these cakes changes depending on...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 gaming 03.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Halt! Who goes there?
:;(Gaming gets into a defensive stance, holding his [[Blackcliff Slasher]])
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 xueyue 01.ogg}} '''{{tt|Houzhang|Masked Bandit 1}}:''' ...It appears that one's movements were overly conspicuous.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 moutainshaper 01.ogg}} '''{{tt|Jiehu|Masked Bandit 2}}:''' Enough of your musings. Focus... Focus on the matter at hand.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 moutainshaper 02.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' Present your exquisite ornaments at once!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 xueyue 02.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' Indeed! Bring them forth readily and without protest.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 yede 02.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Ah!? Wh&mdash;What do we do...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 gaming 04.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' (Hmm. It seems as if these two are acting alone.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 gaming 05.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' (It won't be difficult to subdue them, but they might have something else waiting in store for Dad. The best way to keep him safe is...)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 gaming 06.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Leave this to me. I'll handle them.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 gaming 07.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, take my dad and the goods away from here!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 yede 03.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' No, Gaming! It's too dangerous!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 gaming 08.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' This is what I do!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 moutainshaper 03.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' ...A thorny foe indeed! Let us depart and seek a target softer in blows and disposition!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 gaming 09.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Uh-uh, don't think I'm gonna let you off so easily!
:;(Cloud Retainer watches from the background as Gaming chases after Houzhang and Jiehu)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 xueyue 03.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' Away! Let us away!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 yede 04.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Gaming!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't worry! He's a great fighter!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's even seen him take down a dozen or so Treasure Hoarders all by himself!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 yede 05.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' But, Gaming...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 yede 06.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' ...*sigh*
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 yede 07.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' If he had just stayed by my side and learned the family trade, he wouldn't have to put himself in such dangerous situations.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We just have to trust him. Let's go on ahead. We'd best get away from here, in case there are other bandits in the area waiting in ambush.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 xianyun 01.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' (All is going to plan...)
:;(The group runs to a nearby open field)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, we should be good to stop here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Zhongli!? Oh no, what is he doing here？
:;(The camera pans up to reveal that Zhongli is flying a kite with the design of Hu Tao's ghost)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 yede 08.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Good sir, please listen to me. Reel in your line and leave this place as quickly as you can! There are bandits in the area.
:;(Zhongli brings his kite down)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Bandits? Acting in broad daylight...?
:{{Introductory Note|Zhongli}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahem! *cough* *cough*
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Oh?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *cough*
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Ah, I see.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It appears many people are catching a chill as of late. If your throat is bothering you, Paimon, perhaps some tea and rest are in order.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Nope! No need. No need. Paimon's fine. She just... had some cake stuck in her throat...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (He must have figured it all out by now. Is he just playing dumb on purpose...)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' If there are indeed bandits in the area, then we should inform the Millelith at once.
:{{DIcon}} The guard that was escorting us is already on their tail.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Oh? Well, if that's the case...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Such matters are best left to those with the necessary expertise, wouldn't you agree?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 yede 09.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' *sigh* I suppose you're right... If ordinary people like us got involved, we would only cause more trouble.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Since we find ourselves otherwise unoccupied in this beautiful area, why don't we find a quiet place to relax while we wait for good news?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 6 yede 10.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Hmm... That would be lovely.

;(Approach the tea stall)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, uh, Uncle Yip does have reason to be worried. After all, Gaming, the guard we mentioned, is his son.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Gaming... The name sounds somewhat familiar. Ah yes, that is the name of the Wushou dancer who has been performing around Liyue Harbor recently, is it not?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? Have you seen him perform?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Indeed. I cannot help but admire his skill. He truly encapsulates the spirit of the suanni.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Wushou dancing has become more well-known in Liyue Harbor recently. However... Although performers are seeing budding success, they have, no doubt, had to face many hurdles along the way &mdash; ones not so easily understood by spectators such as ourselves.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' If you ask me, what truly deserves admiration is perseverance in the face of adversity. That is a rare attribute indeed.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I have heard many of my acquaintances praise Gaming for his kind, selfless, and courageous disposition... To have a child so accomplished and upright... You must be a very proud parent indeed, Uncle Yip.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Uncle Yip...)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Seems like Zhongli has decided to skip the formalities...)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 01.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Ah, well...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 02.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' He... He's a hard worker, yes.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You should be sure to tell him you think that when he gets back!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 03.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' I...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Your son is young yet. It's normal for someone his age to be a bit... hotheaded.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It's understandable to find talking about such things in person difficult. If there's a particular sentiment you wish to convey, perhaps we could pass it along for you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 04.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' No, no! It wouldn't be right to ask that of you...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 05.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' *sigh* This thing between us has festered for many years now. In truth... there are some things that simply aren't easy for us to talk through.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 06.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' I've been in the tea business for most of my life, and I always hoped my child would do the same. Otherwise, how would he support himself?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 07.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Over the past few years, I heard how well he was doing for himself as a guard, how his work was taking him to farther and farther off places... I also heard that he never gave up on Wushou dancing. It made me happy... but I was also worried.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 08.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' When you're young, you can handle all that physically taxing work and manual labor. What young person isn't capable of making a living that way? My concern is what happens when you get old.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 09.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Every time I get to thinking like that, I cannot help but be reinforced in the belief that I was right... that I was right not to give in.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 10.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' I often regret introducing him to Wushou dancing as a kid. If I had known how things would turn out, I would have never taken him to see those performances in the first place.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It is only natural for a parent to strive to send their child down the right path. No one would begrudge you that sentiment, Uncle Yip. You need not worry.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 11.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' You seem quite young, Mr. Zhongli, yet you speak with such wisdom... Perhaps I have misjudged your age?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Hahaha, your words are too kind. Truth be told, one of my old friends has several grown daughters.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Rather than fretting about their future, however, she prefers to let them find their own way.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 12.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Then she is more easygoing than I could ever be. I fear... I lack such an open mind.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 13.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Oh, I meant to say earlier, there is no need to be so polite. Feel free to call me by my name, Yip Tak.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Sure.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 14.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' So, do you also think I fret too much, Mr. Zhongli?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' *sigh* That's not exactly what I was hoping to convey. Only a fool would ask a parent not to worry about their child. But think of it this way &mdash; raising a child is not unlike flying a kite. Hold the string too tight, and it can no longer soar.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 zhongli 13.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' As my friend once said, if your children are aiming for the stars... clipping their wings will only cause them to come crashing down. You need to let out the line for a kite to soar.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 15.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' ...*sigh* It seems I was too stuck in my ways.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 zhongli 14.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' You need not reproach your heart for caring. You simply need to loosen your hold a little.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 zhongli 15.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Indeed with such a big heart, why not allocate the time you usually spend worrying about Gaming to the pursuit of other things, like going for a stroll, drinking tea, or taking in the scenery? You never know what surprises could be in store &mdash; things can change in the blink of an eye.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 16.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Haha, the blink of an eye, you say? Do things change so quickly?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 zhongli 16.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Children grow up in quite the same way, do they not? Day after day, year after year, sometimes in the blink of an eye, but always when you least expect it. As a father, I'm sure you know that best.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 17.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Haha... Yes, you can say that again... One second, Gaming was a kid, the next thing I knew he was ready to fly the nest.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Zhongli certainly has a way with words...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Gaming is back!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Gaming, we're over here!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 01.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Dad, {{Traveler}}, Paimon. Good, you're all here. Oh! And Mr. Zhongli from the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor? You're here too?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 zhongli 17.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Haha, a fated meeting indeed! We were just enjoying some pleasant conversation.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 18.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 19.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Is everything resolved?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 02.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Well, you could say that...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 20.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' What does that mean?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 03.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, come with me. I need to talk to you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 21.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Oh... Okay...
:;(The Traveler and Paimon step aside with Gaming)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 04.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' I'll come right out and say it. Those two bandits... You sent them, didn't you?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? So, that's how we're starting off?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 05.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Can't look me in the eye, huh? Guess I'm right, then.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay... But how did you know?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 06.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' At first, their mannerisms seemed a bit stilted. But once I got close, it was obvious that they possessed great skills.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 07.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' I was right on their tail, and it should have taken only a few steps to catch up to them, yet somehow, I was never able to close that distance...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 08.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' People with that level of skill would have gone about things differently from the start, like sneaking up on us while we were distracted.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 09.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Unless, or course, their real motive was to lure me away from the group all along.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, you're pretty quick on the uptake!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 10.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' I just have a lot of experience. I've dealt with many a ruthless bandit in my time, but I've never seen ones like them.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 11.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' In the end, I told them they would make good guards if they ever wanted to get back on the straight and narrow, and that they could come hang out with me in Liyue Harbor any time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh... You ever consider that you might be a little too good at making friends?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 12.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' I'm guessing you guys were trying to help resolve things between my dad and me?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 13.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' *sigh*
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 14.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' I appreciate it. I really do.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 15.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' But this conflict between us has been going on for a long time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 16.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Even if those two were real bandits, and I was able to subdue them and show him what I was capable of, it wouldn't change anything...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 17.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' You've seen the way he talks to me...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's not like that at all! Your dad really cares about you. You should see the way he talks about you when you're not around!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Zhongli was talking things through with him, and he nearly agreed to let it go...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 18.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' *sigh*
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You don't believe us?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 19.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' He won't let it go. He can say as much as he wants to other people, but he won't talk to me. I'm certain of it.
:{{DIcon}} And you? Will you talk to him?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 20.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You told us you wanted to prove yourself to your dad. Why don't you tell him about all the hard work you've done these past few years?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 21.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Will that even do anything? I'm not sure "talking" is enough...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You won't know unless you try! Just like how you won't know if something is delicious unless you taste it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Listen to us. It's time to put these people skills to good use! You can make friends with anyone! So why not your dad?
:{{DIcon}} Good luck! We'll be rooting for you.
:{{DIcon}} It won't hurt to try.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 22.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Ha...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 23.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' I'll do my best.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 22.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' ...You are very knowledgeable, Mr. Zhongli. I'm impressed!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 23.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Despite my being in the tea industry for several decades, it seems I still have much to learn about the art of tea tasting.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 zhongli 18.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' You flatter me. It was nothing but a few humble musings.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How much tea have you drank since we've been gone?
:{{DIcon}} It's not like it was alcohol...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 zhongli 19.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Haha, Yip Tak and I have found many a common interest. Our friendship, much like a cup of tea, seems to grow stronger the longer it has to steep.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 24.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Well said, Mr. Zhongli.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 25.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Gaming, Mr. Zhongli is very knowledgeable. You should take the opportunity to learn from people like him when you're in the city.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 gaming 24.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Huh? Oh... Of course.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahem... Zhongli...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 zhongli 20.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I have very much enjoyed our conversation, Yip Tak, but I, unfortunately, have some unfinished Funeral Parlor business to attend to.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 26.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Oh! I hope I didn't keep you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 yede 27.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' My apologies for taking up so much of your time, Mr. Zhongli. No need to stay on my account. When you're less busy, let's find a time to meet. I'll treat you to dim sum.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 zhongli 21.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It would be an honor.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We'll see you off, Zhongli!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 7 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You two have a nice chat, alright?

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thanks for helping us talk things through with Uncle Yip. Good thing you were able to pick up on what we were putting down.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I have been around the both of you for some time now. You could say I have a certain level of expertise in that regard.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' As for my role in the conversation, think nothing of it. I hardly did anything noteworthy.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, you never change, do you?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, why did you have us walk all this way? Paimon thought we just had to go far enough to be out of earshot.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' A friend approaches.
:;(Xiao appears)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Hello.
:{{Introductory Note|Xiao}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Xiao! You're here too!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I've been here the whole time.
:;(A flashback begins)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' (A ghostly kite? Could that elusive Director Hu be coming to Wangshu Inn once again?)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' (What is she doing here? I suppose it matters not. Given her relationship with Rex... well, Zhongli, I might as well go pay my respects.)
:;(Xiao appears behind the kite-flier)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' (!)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' It's you? I thought you were Director Hu.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Ah. Your arrival is most fortuitous. Do you want to try out this new gadget?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The addition of the power source makes the takeoff more stable. It's just that...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 07.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' (He seems quite immersed in the study of this device...)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I fear it's almost too stable. It completely negates the pleasure of seeing one's kite sway with the wind. It's a bit of a shame.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' In truth, I'm here because Director Hu dispatched me to purchase some items in preparation for Lantern Rite.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 08.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I see. Much like she does every year. Much like she'll do next year, I would imagine.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 09.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 10.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Am I wrong? Or has she once again sent you out to buy... what is it, sesame oil or something?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' While we're on the subject, I do wonder why she is so obsessed with using sesame oil in the preparation of mixed vegetable dishes for Lantern Rite... A recommendation from Xiangling, perhaps? What do you think, Xiao?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 11.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I've only met Director Hu a few times. I'm hardly the best person to ask...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Ah, and is that not a sign that you should visit Wangsheng Funeral Parlor more often? It wouldn't hurt to grace the Parlor with your presence now and again when you are otherwise unoccupied.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' This one here is a traditional kite, one without any equipped mechanical device. Director Hu tasked me with studying the differences between the two to determine which one is of greater merit.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Many hands make light work. Perhaps you could test out the other kite for me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 12.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Alright.
:;(Flashback ends)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 13.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I have made my comparisons.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 14.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' If speed is what you're after, the mechanical kite is the better choice.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 zhongli 13.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Wonderful. I shall pass that information along to Director Hu.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 zhongli 14.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I'll leave these two kites with you. Perhaps you can find a few friends with which to partake in the activity. You might find it to be an enjoyable use of your time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 15.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Oh, uh... Wait, who enjoys kite-flying?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 zhongli 15.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Well, I would imagine someone of your talent and wisdom is more than capable of finding out.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you were testing out the kites for Hu Tao, and even roped Xiao into doing it for you... Paimon didn't ask earlier because the situation was awkward.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 zhongli 16.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I would hardly say I "roped" Xiao into anything. I simply sought the help of a friend. Besides, we did the testing together.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* Seems like our pool of competitors is growing...
:{{DIcon}} The competition's not the important thing right now.
:{{DIcon}} Doesn't matter. We're going to win either way.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you like kite-flying, Xiao?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 16.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I suppose I neither like nor dislike it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 17.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Although, watching a kite gradually ascend into the sky does bring me a certain peace of mind.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 18.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Perhaps they're a bit like [[Xiao Lantern]]s in that way.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 zhongli 17.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Kite-flying is also a pleasant form of relaxation.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Have you ever thought about making a kite, Xiao?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cloud Retainer taught us how. We can teach you if you want.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 19.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' There's no need.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 20.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' [[Menogias]] was the only yaksha among us who had an interest in matters of ornamentation and design.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 21.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' {{Traveler}}, when Lantern Rite is over, come find me near Pervases' temple if you have the time.
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
:{{DIcon}} Absolutely.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xiao 22.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Mmm.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 zhongli 18.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It's getting late. I should go inform Director Hu of our findings.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How has she been by the way? Be sure to say hi to her for us!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 zhongli 19.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The last time I spoke to her, she mentioned that she would be visiting Qiaoying Village in a few days.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 zhongli 20.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' If you have the time, perhaps you could also make the trip. If you happen to run into her, you can pass along your regards in person.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We'll keep that in mind!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Take care, Zhongli. See you later!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 zhongli 21.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' See you next time.

:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 yede 04.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' ...I don't have anything to say.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 gaming 04.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Then I'll go.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 gaming 05.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' ...I still don't want to leave Liyue Harbor.

:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xianyun 01.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Sit, Shenhe. Sit. You must be tired from your journey. Shall I pour you a cup of tea, or would you prefer something else to drink?
:;(Xianyun and Shenhe approach the tea stall and sit down at the next table)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 shenhe 01.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' No need. I'm not tired.

:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xianyun 02.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Perfect. The time is nigh for us to make an appearance.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xianyun 03.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Do you remember the plan one recounted to you?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 shenhe 03.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Yes, Master. We aim to give them a demonstration of familial love.
:;(Flashback ends)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 shenhe 04.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' So I'll have whatever you are having.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xianyun 04.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Alright.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 gaming 08.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' (What are Aunty Xianyun and Shenhe doing here? Just how many people are involved in this scheme? ... I suppose all I can do is just take a seat and see what happens.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xianyun 05.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Perfect. I just so happen to have bought some Sunglo Tea recently. It's quite the delectable variety.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xianyun 06.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' (Or it would be if one has not been forced to drink it every day in the hopes of whittling down one's considerable stash. One has more than had one's fill already.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xianyun 07.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' (Forget it. Such thoughts detract from the present need to keep up the conversation.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xianyun 08.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Has work been busy during the holiday season? Do you need my help with anything?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 shenhe 05.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Drunk guests can sometimes cause trouble. But I deal with them as you taught me, by pinning their heads against the table.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 yede 08.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Eh!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 gaming 09.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' (Are Aunty Xianyun and Shenhe serious right now?)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xianyun 09.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' *cough*
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xianyun 10.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' (Oh dear. While one was busy orchestrating this act, one seems to have forgotten about Shenhe's various... eccentricities.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xianyun 11.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Wh&mdash;What I meant to ask was... Have you made any new friends? We live so far from each other &mdash; it would be a great comfort to me to know you were surrounded by good companions...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 shenhe 06.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' You already know of my past circumstances.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 shenhe 07.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Recently, I've been conversing with Guoba in the kitchen at night. Guoba can't talk, but his companionship is a comfort.

:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 yede 10.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' (I guess... Maybe Gaming's not doing so bad after all... Perhaps I've been too hard on him...)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xianyun 12.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' *cough* Let's move on, shall we? Do you have any plans for today, Shenhe? How about we do something fun?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 yede 11.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' (That sounds about right... Take her to do something fun, and perhaps she'll loosen up a bit...)

:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 shenhe 08.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Like we used to do when we would carry stones up and down the mountain from dawn until dusk, picking herbs to eat for dinner along the way? If that is what you ask of me, then that is what I shall do.

:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 yede 15.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' I don't support your decision to stay in Liyue Harbor because living here is too hard on you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 yede 16.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' If you come home, there will be people to help you... I'm not saying we have to live under the same roof &mdash; I know our personalities are too similar to avoid butting heads... But you'll have your entire family around you!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 yede 17.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Your aunts, uncles... they'll all do whatever they can to help. You could get a less taxing job, and we could... we could grab dim sum together from time to time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 shenhe 09.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Huh. I didn't know dim sum was such a important affair, Master.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 xianyun 13.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Shhh!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 yede 18.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' ...Just think about it, okay? You don't have to decide now.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 gaming 11.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' (Dad... really has changed a lot. He would have never said these things to me before...)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 gaming 12.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' (But... I...)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 gaming 13.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Thank you, Dad.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 yede 19.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' *sigh*
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's been long enough, don't you think? Oh, Paimon sure hopes they've made up by now.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Oh, they're drinking tea in silence. That's not a good sign... Did Xianyun's plan not work after all?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 9 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, you two! Paimon's sorry we were gone for so long. We got to chatting with some friends and didn't realize how much time had passed.

:{{A|vo eqhdj303 13 gaming 04.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Don't tell me... you're the ones footing the bill for all that tea? I can't let you do that...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 13 xianyun 03.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' Fret not. Reimbursements will be made.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 13 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Exactly! Think of it more as an "investment," as Ningguang would say.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 13 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We pooled together the Mora so that Charlotte could place the order. She's gonna bring it back to The Steambird as a gift, as well as a sample of the regional specialty.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 13 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Fontainians will probably fall in love with your dad's tea as soon as they lay their eyes on Charlotte's article. And once all the money from the new orders begin to roll in, getting our Mora back will be a piece of cake!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 13 gaming 05.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Oh, okay...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 13 gaming 06.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Business-related matters always seem to go over my head, but I refuse to let you all lose Mora on my behalf. I'll pay you back right now...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 13 xianyun 04.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' We can talk about such matters at a later date. There are more important matters for you to consider at the moment, are there not?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 13 gaming 07.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' ...Yes.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 13 gaming 08.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' I've been thinking about it the whole way here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 13 gaming 09.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' I have an idea.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 13 gaming 10.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' But I'd hate to cause even more trouble for all of you...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 13 xianyun 05.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' That is for us to decide.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 13 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! We're all friends here. Plus, we wouldn't be here if we didn't want to help, right? Just tell us about this idea of yours!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 13 gaming 11.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Okay! *exhale*... So it's like this...
:;(Gaming tells the others his plan)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 13 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Got it! Just leave it to us!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 13 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's split up and make it happen!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 13 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We need to do those things we talked about, but we also still have the kite-flying competition.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 13 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Since Xiao already tested out those kites for us... Why don't we also go buy one of those mechanical thingamabobs or whatever they're called? We can attach it to our kite!

;(Approach Zhenyuan)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hello again!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 14 zhenyuan 01.ogg}} '''Zhenyuan:''' Welcome back! I see you've returned from your trip. I really do have to thank you for all your help from before.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 14 zhenyuan 02.ogg}} '''Zhenyuan:''' Thanks to you, my daughter was able to build a kite with her grandmother that very same day. She even wrote a long letter telling me how much she loved it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 14 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you should really be thanking Gaming, not us.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 14 zhenyuan 03.ogg}} '''Zhenyuan:''' I'll be sure to.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 14 zhenyuan 04.ogg}} '''Zhenyuan:''' Are you here to buy a kite? Please take your pick!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 14 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, we already have a kite. We wanted to buy one of those, um... device thingies from Fontaine. Do you sell them separately?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 14 zhenyuan 05.ogg}} '''Zhenyuan:''' Ah, yes. Here you go. Please take it, free of charge. The directions are in the box. It's not hard to install at all.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 14 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, it doesn't feel right for us to just take it...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 14 zhenyuan 06.ogg}} '''Zhenyuan:''' Well, nor would it feel right for me to take your Mora. Hehe, Good luck in the kite-flying competition. I'll be rooting for you!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 14 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright then. Thank you!
:;(The Traveler and Paimon install the Mechanical Vertical Lifting Device)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 14 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew, it's done!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 14 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's get down to business!
:;(Time advances to night)

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 15 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like we finished everything we needed to do. Let's find a good place and put this thing into the sky!

;(Approach the marker)
;(A [[#Gallery|cinematic]] plays)
:;(Yaoyao leads Qiqi through the busy streets of Liyue Harbor to the main venue)
::'''Yaoyao:''' Qiqi, we're almost there!
::'''Qiqi:''' ...Okay
:;(The Traveler and Paimon walk through the market, followed by Ganyu and Shenhe in their new outfits)
:;(Ganyu notices Shenhe's hair ornament out of place)
::'''Ganyu:''' ...Come here, allow me
::'''Paimon:''' The Lantern Rite is as festive as ever!
:;(The lanterns in Liyue Harbor begin to dim)
::'''Spectator:''' Huh? What's going on?
::'''Spectator:''' Did something happen?
::'''Spectator:''' -What the... -What should we do?
::'''Spectator:''' Should we get the Millelith?
:;(The Mingxiao Lantern dims and drums begin to play)
::'''Spectator:''' What's that?
:;(The pedestrians crowd by the harbor to see a bright light through the fog on the sea)
:;([[Xiaqing]] and other drummers continue as the fog clears to reveal Gaming, prepared to perform a Wushou Dance on the water, with Anemo-colored ripples from his steps)
:;(As he begins, more people flock to the harbor to see the performance, including Yip Tak and Shuyu)
:;(Gaming hops between the Xiao Lanterns while arranging them into a ladder)
:;(He hops up the nearby tower and jumps onto the final Xiao Lantern, finishing his performance to fireworks and applause)
:;(Gaming looks down to see his father among the crowd)
:;(In a nearby building, Charlotte takes a picture of Keqing but is out of film)
::'''Charlotte:''' Have I taken that many pictures already?
::'''Charlotte:''' ...I need to load more film!
:;(Shenhe and Ganyu fly their scissor-tailed swallow kite next to a golden finch kite as the Traveler and Paimon join)
::'''Paimon:''' Woohoo! Yay!
:;(On a nearby bridge, Gaming takes off his Wushou head and admires the fireworks)
:;(The wind slows and kites begin to fall)
::'''Gaming:''' Wait, the wind...
:;(Xianyun summons her "kite" with her adeptal arts which flies by and brings the kites back into the air)
::'''Spectator:''' -Do you see that? -Wow... -Oh my gosh...
::'''Spectator:''' Mommy... I want a big kite like that, too!
::'''Spectator:''' Do you see that kite way out in front? It's so beautiful!
::'''Keqing:''' ...Happy Lantern Rite!
::'''Charlotte:''' Happy Lantern Rite!
:;(Charlotte takes a picture of Keqing)
:;(Gaming, while watching the fireworks and kites, suddenly seems dejected, hangs his head, and turns to walk back)
:;(As he turns, he sees Shuyu and his father holding Shuyu's suanni kite, waiting for him at the end of the bridge)
:;(He runs towards them)
:;(Cinematic ends)

;(After the cinematic)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 16 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Gaming's performance was so cool, Paimon almost wanted to join in! You saw that, right, {{Traveler}}?

:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 gaming 03.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Okay.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 yede 06.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Your performance... I've seen many Wushou dances in my time, but I've got to admit... What you pulled off there was breathtaking.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 gaming 04.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' ...Wow.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 gaming 05.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' I never thought I'd live to hear you say that.

:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 gaming 06.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Absolutely! I know it'll be difficult, but...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 yede 08.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Then it doesn't matter.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 yede 09.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' What I mean to say is, of course it'll be difficult... But if that's your decision, if that's your dream, then it doesn't matter how difficult it is. As long as you put in the work, then any obstacle can be overcome in time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 yede 10.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Really, when I was young, I also... Hehe. Actually, how about we save that story of my past for another time?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 yede 11.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' All I really want to say is, I've changed my mind...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 yede 12.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Much like this kite, you also deserve to soar to new heights.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 gaming 07.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Dad...

:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 yede 14.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' I bet you're wondering what's gotten into me, saying all this...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 gaming 09.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' ...Well, uh... Hehehe, a little bit, yeah.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 yede 15.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Anyway, I know I've never found the chance to say this before, but... Ahem!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 yede 16.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' To me, Gaming, you've always been a great kid.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 gaming 10.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 yede 17.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Alright. That's everything I've got. Did you have something you wanted to say, or...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 gaming 11.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' ...
:;(Gaming runs up to hug Yip Tak)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 yede 18.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' ...!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seeing the two of them talk things through like this really gives Paimon a sense of accomplishment.
:{{DIcon}} Yep, it was all because of you...
:{{DIcon}} Give yourself a pat on the back, Paimon.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 yede 19.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' ...Now go.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 yede 20.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Over there... Your friends are still waiting for you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 gaming 12.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Huh? But, you came all this way...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 yede 21.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' I'll be staying in Liyue Harbor for a bit longer. When you have time, we can grab dim sum together. Your treat, right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 gaming 13.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Dad...! Honestly...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 yede 22.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Hahaha. Go.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 gaming 14.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' ...Okay, then I'm off. See you soon.
:;(Gaming brings Shuyu's suanni kite down the bridge)
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's quite the smile you've got there, Gaming!
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 gaming 15.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' R&mdash;Really...?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's nothing to be embarrassed about!
:{{DIcon}} Is there anything else you'd like to do?
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 gaming 16.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 gaming 17.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' I'd like to find and thank Aunty Xianyun, as well as everyone else who's helped me out.
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 gaming 18.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' If everyone has time, maybe we could all get together and...
:{{A|vo eqhdj303 17 gaming 19.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Go fly a kite.

===Charlotte===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Charlotte next to the Kite Stall)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Lantern Rite was simply amazing! I'm not sure I'll be able to sleep tonight!
:{{DIcon}} About the "Mechanical Vertical Lifting Device"...
::{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 charlotte 06a 1.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Oh, that? Yeah, interesting story.
::{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 charlotte 06a 2.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' It was invented by a guy from Fontaine. His name is Ildesson.
::{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 charlotte 06a 3.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' He's always tinkering away at some mechanism or another. He's even asked The Steambird to write about his inventions on more than one occasion.
::{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 charlotte 06a 4.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I believe I have a direct quote from him about this particular one. Ah yes, here it is.
::{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 charlotte 06a 5.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' The device is powered entirely by mechanical components without the need for any additional energy source...
::{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 charlotte 06a 6.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Basically, it's a manually operated cranking device. How high it can fly entirely depends on how much force you can exert...
::{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 charlotte 06a 7.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Combining this invention with a kite... What a great idea, right!
::;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About the interview and working together with Gaming's father...
::{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 charlotte 06b 1.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' My conversation with Mr. Yip went really well. I've already sent the first draft of my article back to The Steambird.
::{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 charlotte 06b 2.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' It's a piece that contains all the pertinent information while also telling a story. I'm quite proud of it.
::{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 charlotte 06b 3.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Oh, that reminds me, I should thank everyone who made this possible for me！Especially that spirited lady with those peculiar turns of phrase... Miss Xianyun was her name, right?
::{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 charlotte 06b 4.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' It was all thanks to your connections and creativity. I would have never thought I'd be able to bring such a special gift back to Fontaine with me.
::;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About Lantern Rite...
::{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 charlotte 06c 1.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' This was my first time experiencing a foreign holiday in person. It was... so exciting!
::{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 charlotte 06c 2.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' The festive atmosphere, the contagious holiday spirit, the profound, storied cultural traditions steeped in symbolism...
::{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 charlotte 06c 3.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Ah, I almost forgot! Keqing even gave me a kite with a poem on it that she wrote herself!
::{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 charlotte 06c 4.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' It goes, "Dreams are like paper kites, with them do our hopes take flight, sailing high above the clouds, they yearn for something more profound, yet try we may and try we might, a deeper truth waits in plain sight, though we hang our hopes in skies abound, many joys lie on the ground."
::{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 charlotte 06c 5.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I want to include this poem in my special feature on Lantern Rite. I'm sure a lot of people will love it!
::;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} Until next time, Charlotte.
::{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 charlotte 06d 1.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Yep! And Happy Lantern Rite to you!

:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 gaming 02.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Eh? Oh, I guess you heard everything Paimon was saying, huh?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 yede 06.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Hehe... Of course. She was talking about you. As your father, how could I not listen?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 yede 07.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' Remember back when you were a kid and you would sit on my shoulders to watch the Wushou dance? On our way back home, you would beg me to buy you some Winter Melon Cake.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 yede 08.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' We would only buy two at a time, but before long, we'd tried the Winter Melon Cake from every vendor that street had to offer.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 yede 09.ogg}} '''Yip Tak:''' There was also that one time you used your pocket money to treat me! Do you still remember?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 gaming 03.ogg}} '''Gaming:''' Yeah... I remember.

:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 shenhe 04.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I don't get it...
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 ganyu 01.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Is something wrong, Shenhe? Tell me. Perhaps I can help.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 shenhe 05.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' The color black doesn't get dirty easily, so I thought this outfit would be acceptable to wear to work. But Xiangling told me it was inappropriate.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 shenhe 06.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' But inappropriate... how?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 ganyu 02.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' ...She probably just meant the outfit isn't suitable for that particular environment and occasion.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 ganyu 03.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' But for a festival gathering with friends, a nighttime stroll, or an important banquet... your outfit is more than appropriate, Shenhe.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 shenhe 07.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' So you're saying it's only something I should wear in front of important people.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 ganyu 04.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Hm... I suppose that's another way to think of it.

===Keqing and Xianyun===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Keqing or Xianyun at Xianyun's Home in Liyue Harbor)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xianyun 04.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One may have won the kite-flying competition, Yuheng, but this prize should truly be reserved for another.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' You need not be so humble, Honored Adeptus. Among all the kites, yours was quite literally a cut above the rest. Please accept this prize. You deserve it.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Besides, I'm quite certain we owe a fair share of the success of this year's Lantern Rite to you...
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xianyun 05.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' ...Hm, if you insist, then one can hardly continue to refuse. However, there is another matter with which one would ask your assistance.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Of course.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xianyun 06.ogg}} '''Xianyun:''' One would be much obliged if you could distribute this case of Sunglo Tea among the Millelith on duty. The security of the festivities rests entirely on their shoulders, after all. One presumes they could always benefit from something to invigorate their spirits.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' (Cloud Retainer is so thoughtful and attentive to others' needs! I would expect nothing less of an esteemed adeptus such as herself.)

;(Talk to Moon Carver or Mountain Shaper in front of the main stage)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 moutainshaper 01.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' Given your present countenance, one presumes you are missing some old friends again?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xueyue 01.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' One cannot help but be reminded of them...
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 moutainshaper 02.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' Pray, speak. Unburden yourself of these sentiments.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xueyue 02.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' One simply wishes Menogias were alive to witness such peace alongside us.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xueyue 03.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' He was so skilled in matters of craftsmanship. Kite-making would scarcely prove to be a test of his capabilities. Were he yet amongst the living, he could have opened a kite stall. One is certain it would have been an establishment rich not only in profit but also esteem.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xueyue 04.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' And if, as in the past, he were unable to involve himself in matters of the mortal realm, we could sell the kites in his stead. When we finished, we could bring him back wine and partake in drink and good company...
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 moutainshaper 03.ogg}} '''Jiehu:''' Moon Carver. Those are now but fond moments in our memories.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xueyue 05.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' ...Indeed. The dead are gone, so, as the representatives of the living...
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xueyue 06.ogg}} '''Houzhang:''' Let us take in the sights for a bit longer, if just for his sake.

:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 yaoyao 03.ogg}} '''Yaoyao:''' How about we do it during the day next time? That way, we can see the design better! When it flies super high up, it will look exactly like a real finch.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 qiqi 04.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Okay.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 qiqi 05.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Can I... take this kite to bed with me?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 yaoyao 04.ogg}} '''Yaoyao:''' Hehe, but of course!

===Xiao===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Xiao next to [[Pervases' Temple]] for the first time)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' {{Traveler}}.
:{{DIcon}} It's just as I thought... You stopped short of stepping into the city again.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Being in the city isn't the only way for me to appreciate the lights and beauty of Lantern Rite. Look... Liyue Harbor lies just beyond this mountain.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' As long as I stand at this vantage point, I may freely behold the sight of all the kites slowly ascending into the sky.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...For me, that is enough.
:{{DIcon}} Alright.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I invited you here because there is something I would like to do.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...I want to release a Xiao Lantern, and... I'd like you to be there for it.
:{{DIcon}} Did you make it yourself?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xiao 07.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Yes.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xiao 08.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I apologize for its crude appearance... I have little skill in that regard.
:{{DIcon}} No, no! It's amazing.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xiao 09.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...You are very kind, as usual.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xiao 10.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Alright. It's time.

;(Talk to Xiao next to [[Pervases' Temple]] again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xiao 11.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (As the Xiao Lantern slowly disappears into the tranquil night sky, Xiao's expression softens.)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xiao 12.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' {{Traveler}}.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj303 xiao 13.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Thank you.
