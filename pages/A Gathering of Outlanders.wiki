{{Quest Description|As the Windblume Festival approaches, you and Paimon return to Mondstadt, grasped in the throes of festivity, and take on a rather different commission than you are used to...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Upon obtaining quest)
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, doesn't Mondstadt celebrate the Windblume Festival around this time of year?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon has lots of good memories from the last one... the sweet scent of flowers on the breeze, the sweet smell of tasty snacks on the breeze, the feeling of the breeze on... your face? The only downside was the lack of commissions.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But Paimon's sure that was just a one-time thing. There's gotta be someone who needs our help, right? Let's go see how things are this year!

;(Approach Katheryne in Mondstadt)
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey there, Katheryne!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 katheryne 01.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Good day, you two. It's nice to see you here at this festive time.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sooo... Got any jobs for us?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 katheryne 02.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Hmm, I'm afraid I'd struggle to find you any commissions in the near future.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 katheryne 03.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' With the arrival of the Windblume Festival, the only task most Mondstadters are busy with is preparing gifts for their loved ones &mdash; but it's customary to do this oneself, without assistance.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 katheryne 04.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Think of this period as the off-season for the Mondstadt branch of the Adventurers' Guild.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 katheryne 05.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Spring is here, love is in the air, and everyone wants to relax and enjoy themselves. Even the cats at the tavern next door have been getting lovey-dovey with one other recently.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ew... gross.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You know that feeling you get when you burst out the doors after a nice nap, hoping to make it to the store before the limited-edition drinks sell out, only to get there just in time to see the last two glasses snatched away right from under your nose by a couple of pesky lovebirds? That's what this feels like.
:{{DIcon}} That's... very specific of you, Paimon.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 katheryne 06.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Hehe. Perhaps you two could simply take this chance to&mdash;
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' {{Traveler}}! Paimon! Thank goodness I found you. Um, there's something I need your help with.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, Sucrose?
:{{DIcon}} Whoa, Sucrose?
:{{DIcon}} Whoa, someone needs help after all?
::{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 09b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What is wrong with you? That's no way to greet a friend we haven't seen in so long!
::{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 02b 1.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Uh &mdash; no, not help like in the Windblume sense... It's just... Ugh, how do I explain...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Go ahead, Sucrose! We don't have anything else to do right now, anyway.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Phew... Okay.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 04.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Here's the situation. I've been appointed as the Windblume Festival Special Ambassador by the Knights of Favonius this year.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 05.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' My task is to do good deeds for people during this festival of gratitude and love.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nice one! So how did they decide who to appoint, anyway?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 06.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' They spun an empty bottle donated by Angel's Share inside a circle with all our names on it. Whoever's name the bottle stopped at got chosen.
:{{DIcon}} This method seems a bit arbitrary.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 07.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I think so too. But everyone said that it was to make it fair, so everyone had an equal chance to become the special ambassador.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 08.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' The thing is... I'm not great at dealing with people, so I was really daunted by it at first. But I'm still glad that I got this role!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 09.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Luckily, I came up with a way to spur myself on, which has helped. Have a look.
::[[File:Windblume's Breath Test Tube.png|100px]]
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is that a test tube?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 10.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Yep. Every time I do a good deed for someone, I get them to breathe into a test tube. That way, I can collect everyone's "Breaths of Joy."
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds... fascinating! Are you gonna use them in your research?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 11.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Yes. I believe these Breaths of Joy will serve as valuable raw materials for alchemical transmutation. With any luck, I'll be able to produce something truly miraculous.
:{{DIcon}} Like an Extra-Sweet Sweet Flower?
:{{DIcon}} Like an Extra-Sweet Sunsettia?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mmm... Darn, now Paimon's hungry. ...Wait, you're doing this on purpose, aren't you?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 12.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Haha. Actually, I meant something even more exciting than that.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 13.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I can't say for sure until I have more test results to confirm my hypothesis, though. Alchemists mustn't make claims they can't live up to.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 14.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Anyway... I'm still missing one final Breath of Joy.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, is that all you need help with? That's easy!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just treat Paimon to a Sweet Madame, then you'll get your last Breath of Joy.
:{{DIcon}} More like Sweet Madame Breath.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, be serious.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, come on! Paimon's doing her best to help, okay!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... So does it need to be more, like, official or ceremonious or something?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 15.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' No, joy isn't measured in those terms at all.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 16.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Let me put it this way: Have you ever planted a fruit seed and cared for it while it grows?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 17.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' In the same way that those tender, sweet fruits are the product of your time and effort, the amount of joy derived from an experience is positively correlated to the degree of hardship overcome during it.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 18.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' For example, in my case, I would say that to experience a statistically significant amount of joy, I'd have to do something like spend six months developing a medicine formula to a point where it was finally consistently effective.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 19.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Similarly, in order to collect a significant amount of joy from other people, I have to find ways to do something sufficiently challenging on their behalf.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohh, Paimon gets it now.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Long story short, you want us to help you find people for you to help...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...That's pretty tough, given that it's the Windblume Festival and all!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 20.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Oh... I figured since you're such experienced travelers, you might have some ideas, but if even you don't know how to approach this...
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry. Leave this to me.
::{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 21a 1.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Really? You have a plan?
::{{DIcon}} Experience is on my side.
:{{DIcon}} We can't give up yet.
::{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 21b 1.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' ...Yes, you're right.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 22a.ogg}} {{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 22b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, if {{MC|m=he|f=she}}'s in, then Paimon'll help too... with the talking, anyway.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But um, if things don't work out, can Paimon still get that Sweet Madame?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 24.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' C'mon, {{Traveler}}, this is a festival of gratitude and love after all. How could you refuse?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 marjorie 01.ogg}} '''Marjorie:''' 'Scuse me, Sucrose, could I borrow you for a second? Package for you...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 22.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Oh, sure.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 sucrose 23.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Be right back.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 25.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, is that who Paimon thinks it is? That's Collei, right? When did she arrive in Mondstadt?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 1 paimon 26.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go say hi!

;(Talk to Marjorie or Sucrose, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 marjorie 01.ogg}} '''Marjorie:''' ...And that's everything. Are they all in satisfactory condition?
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' ...Yep. Thank you, Marjorie.
----
;(Approach Collei)
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Collei! Hey!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...Oh, hey you guys. What are the chances...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You were staring into space just now. Something the matter?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Um... No, don't worry. I'm fine.
:{{Introductory Note|Collei}}
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I was just looking at a Mondstadt children's book in the souvenir shop over there.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' While I was flipping through it, a piece of paper fell out. The writing on it was really mysterious... almost like a prophecy.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' "If you can do these things, you may light the lantern of utmost joy and receive a supreme blessing."
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And what does "these things" refer to?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 06.ogg}} '''Collei:''' "Find a flower that is not of this world. Find a guide who will never get lost. Find one who would never lie. Find a legend that never ends."
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 07.ogg}} '''Collei:''' So four things in total. Here, have a look.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 08.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I asked the lady who owns the store about it, but she said that she didn't know anything about any paper slips.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Perhaps we can ask a friend about this later...)
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Hi there. Sorry to butt in, but... what's the name of that storybook you just mentioned?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 09.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh, it was called "[[The Boar Princess]]."
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Hmm, that is strange... I've read that book, and it sounds like that note you found has no relation to the story at all.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 10.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Umm...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 11.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Do you know her?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let Paimon do the honors! Collei, this is Sucrose, an alchemist with the [[Knights of Favonius]]. And Sucrose, meet Collei. She's a Trainee [[Forest Ranger]] from [[Sumeru]]'s [[Avidya Forest]].
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 12.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Hello...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' H&mdash;Hi...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 13.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, this is getting awkward fast... They're both so shy!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 14.ogg}} '''Collei:''' So, Sucrose, what are your thoughts on this prophecy? Could it be real?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 04.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I, um... W&mdash;Without having done any research, I couldn't comment definitively...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 15.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 05.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Um, but if you want my subjective opinion, I don't think that it's a nasty prank or anything.
:{{DIcon}} Why not?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 06.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' The only people who read children's books are those with a childlike wonder and imagination... or children, of course. I'm sure that whoever put this prophecy there would understand that...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 07.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Would they really do this just to spread lies and ruin someone's innocence? I can't imagine anyone being so cruel.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 16.ogg}} '''Collei:''' That's a great take. I love it!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Exactly! Who would wanna hurt a child's feelings?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 17.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Okay, so... What do you think the "blessing" is, Sucrose?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 08.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Hmm... Umm...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 09.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' If I had to guess... Maybe a fairy that can make people's wishes come true, or something?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 10.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I haven't read many fairy tales, so this is pure speculation... With no other information on hand or prior research to compare against, I'm afraid it might not even be worth considering.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 18.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Wow...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 19.ogg}} '''Collei:''' (Her guesswork is really good, though! I wanna pick her brains some more...)
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 20.ogg}} '''Collei:''' (But will she find it annoying if I keep asking her questions...?)
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 21.ogg}} '''Collei:''' (We've only just met, after all... Aah, what's the best thing to say to someone you're meeting for the first time?)
:{{DIcon}} Would you like to get the "lantern of utmost joy"?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 22.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 23.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Well... Yes, I mean... if possible...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 11.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Then, what would you wish for, Collei?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 24.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Um. I'd wish for a... a better personality.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 12.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You can't waste it on that! You've got a great personality already!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 25.ogg}} '''Collei:''' That's very kind of you, but if you know me like I do...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Collei!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 26.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I know that voice! It's...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Collei! Whew...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' You made good time, huh? You're way earlier than I expected!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 ambor 04.ogg}} '''Amber:''' I spotted your green hair way off in the distance &mdash; good thing my eyes are sharp, or I'd have missed you!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 27.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Amber! Have you been doing well? Did you... finish all the [[Pita Pocket]]s I brought you last time?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 ambor 05.ogg}} '''Amber:''' You bet! They're getting yummier each time you make them.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Wait, remind Paimon... have you been to Mondstadt before?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 28.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Mm-hmm.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 29.ogg}} '''Collei:''' A long time ago, I had a lot of help from a lot of people here in Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 30.ogg}} '''Collei:''' So ever since my [[Eleazar]] got better, I've been looking out for an opportunity to come back to Mondstadt and tell them all the news that I've been cured...
:{{DIcon}} Great.
:{{DIcon}} Good for you!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 31.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Thanks...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 ambor 06.ogg}} '''Amber:''' If it's okay with everyone, why don't I take Collei for a walk around town? I'd like to show her some of the places she didn't get to see last time.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 13.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Of course, fine by me.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure! Go right ahead!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 32.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I, uh...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 33.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Umm... sorry Amber...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 34.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I agreed to meet my traveling companions by the city gate in a few minutes, so I can't go with you just yet...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 ambor 07.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Oh, that's alright!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 ambor 08.ogg}} '''Amber:''' In that case, you guys go rest up, and I'll go see Master [[Jean]] to ask for some time off.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 35.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh, okay...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 ambor 09.ogg}} '''Amber:''' {{Traveler}}, Sucrose, could you look after Collei for now?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 ambor 10.ogg}} '''Amber:''' I'll come get her later and take her out. There's still a whole bunch of people I need to introduce her to!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 14.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Sure, no problem.
:{{DIcon}} You can count on us.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 ambor 11.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Awesome. See ya later, then!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 36.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Umm...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You alright there, Collei? You look kinda disappointed...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 37.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I'm sorry...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 38.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I'm just feeling a little shy today... Don't worry about me.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 sucrose 15.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 39.ogg}} '''Collei:''' (Amber wants to introduce me to more of her friends... Am I gonna be able to cope?)
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 40.ogg}} '''Collei:''' (I've only met Sucrose so far, and I'm already struggling to make conversation...)
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 41.ogg}} '''Collei:''' (I wish I had a little more self-confidence. Then I'd find it much easier to make friends with people...)
:{{A|vo eqfh101 2 collei 42.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Ah! It's nearly time. Let's go to the gate and see if they've arrived.
----
;(Approach the marked location in front of the Mondstadt front gate)
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...Why is this humble windmill such a great view?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I mean, it's understandable. It must have been a long time since you last came to Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Because it is the true "Great Vay-iew-vyastra."
:{{Introductory Note|Cyno}}
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' ...
:{{Introductory Note|Tighnari}}
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Oh, come on. Don't tell me you don't get it?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' View, vayu... and also mahamatra, vayuvyastra... no?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Tighnari, Cyno, over here!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Phew... Am I glad to see you.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' And who's this young lady?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Master, this is Sucrose, an alchemist with the Knights of Favonius. We just met.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Sucrose, this is my teacher, Tighnari. He's a highly respected [[Forest Watcher]] in Sumeru, and he's also a very famous botanist.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 05.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Collei's exaggerating... I'm Tighnari. Pleased to meet you.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Ah, so you have a teacher as well! The pleasure is all mine, Tighnari, Sir.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Yup! He's extremely knowledgeable, too!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' And this is General Mahamatra Cyno of the [[Sumeru Akademiya]]. He's really famous in Sumeru as well!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Greetings. Though if I might say so, we're purely here for personal reasons. You needn't be unduly concerned with our official positions.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' And Collei, there's no need to use my full title. "Cyno" is fine, or "Sir" if you absolutely must.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 06.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Indeed. We're not here in an official capacity &mdash; just to keep Collei company on her vacation.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Keep me company? But it was you two that insisted on coming...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Collei is very important to us. We felt obliged to ensure her safety on the long treacherous journey to Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 collei 06.ogg}} '''Collei:''' But I've been here on my own loads of times before...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What about your work though? What if something bad happens while the General Mahamatra's away?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' There should be no issues. I have left my duties in the hands of my subordinates and two especially reliable helpers.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 collei 07.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh! Sucrose, what were you saying about you having a teacher as well...?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I was just going to mention that &mdash; I think we're in a somewhat similar situation. I'm an assistant to Mr. [[Albedo]], Mondstadt's genius alchemist.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Oh, please, Sucrose, "genius" is an unnecessary epithet. It will serve only to leave an exaggerated impression of me in the minds of our guests.
:{{Introductory Note|Albedo}}
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' M&mdash;Mr. Albedo... but it is an objective truth...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Albedo's here too! Great, the more, the merrier!
:{{Black Screen|Everyone introduces themselves, and exchanges pleasantries.}}
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 07.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Hmm. So tell me Sucrose &mdash; since your specialty is Bio-Alchemy, what do you know about the antitoxic properties of the [[Calla Lily]]?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, wait!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Can we hold off on the nerdy topic for now? Paimon doesn't wanna be left out...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 04.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Oh... As it happens, I've studied the Calla Lily in quite some detail before, with it being a species native to Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 05.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I wrote a whole report on my findings... If you're interested, Mr. Tighnari Sir, I can go get it for you!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 cyno 10.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' We're supposed to be here on vacation, and you're already thinking about how to improve your herbal medicines? Also, I thought we'd agreed to take on new identities for this trip?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What new identities?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 cyno 11.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Mine was "Adventurer Cyno, skilled desert explorer," Tighnari's was "technological consultant to the Treasure Hoarders," and Collei's was "traveling musician."
:{{DIcon}} ...And you find that sort of role-play fun?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 cyno 12.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Very much so.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 08.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I do wish some of the less cautious adventurers in the Avidya Forest would consider coming to Mondstadt instead.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 09.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' What [[Philanemo Mushroom]]s lack in texture, they make up for in not causing vomiting or diarrhea.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 collei 08.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Pfff...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 06.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Are you contemplating using some compounds from the Calla Lily as active ingredients in a targeted antidote?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 10.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Yes. I gathered a few on the way here, and my initial research suggests to me that it could be worth a try.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 07.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Okay... I got it.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 08.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' But... as much as I don't wish to be a wet blanket...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 09.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' It takes a huge amount of experimental data to conclusively prove how different drugs interact. Estimating the total development time would be very difficult...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 10.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Add in the time for procurement and delivery of essential materials and I'm not sure if we could complete development before you need to return.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Then please, allow me to help.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 11.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Mr. Albedo!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Apologies for my tardy entrance in the present discussion.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I understand you're looking to make an antidote for poisonous fungi, correct?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 albedo 05.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' If you happen to have some samples with you, or relevant documentation on hand, perhaps you might give me the chance to review them later?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 albedo 06.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' But before that, I invite the three of you to look at this.
;(Opens Food and Lodging Arrangements)
::{{Black Screen|Food and Lodging Arrangements}}
::Accommodations: One of Mr. Goth's other properties (Priority)/The Adventurers' Guild reception area (Backup Plan, to be confirmed).
::Food: Group meals on the first day, following which all are free to make their own arrangements amidst the city's various restaurants and taverns. Self-catering facilities will be prepared at lodgings.
::Outdoor Activities: Considering our guests' sightseeing interests, Sucrose, [[Timaeus]], myself, and some of the Knights of Favonius can accompany our guests, splitting in groups where necessary.
::Obtaining Souvenirs: Multiple collection methods. [[With Wind Comes Glory]], the outdoors themselves, creation through alchemy, and hand-crafting are all possibilities.
::Scientific Observations: Emphasis on Botany.
::Official Business: No such needs at the moment.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Food and lodging arrangements!?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Were you quietly writing this up the whole time? Paimon didn't even notice!
:{{DIcon}} Impressive multi-tasking.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 albedo 07.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Hardly.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 albedo 08.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Rather, I should apologize for interrupting a serious discussion between trained professionals, especially after they have traveled so far to be here, when I myself am neither an adventurer, nor a technological consultant, nor a musician.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 albedo 09.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Nevertheless, I would encourage you to have a knowledgeable local arrange your detailed itinerary while you're in Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 albedo 10.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Take a look, and should you find anything here to be objectionable, it can easily be adjusted.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 11.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' This is too kind of you. These arrangements are quite excellent.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It looks great! Even Paimon feels like tagging along for the food and board...
:{{DIcon}} You're not included in this itinerary...
::{{A|vo eqfh101 3 paimon 10a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's why it's called "tagging along"!
:{{DIcon}} What do you three think?
::{{A|vo eqfh101 3 paimon 10b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, doesn't Paimon's opinion matter anymore? Paimon's technically a guest in Mondstadt too, y'know!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 cyno 13.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Very comprehensive. The adventurer, technological consultant, and musician all approve. Thank you.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 tighnari 12.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Just one thing... We'd like the chance to cook as well. Why don't we change the group dinner to a camping and cooking trip?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 collei 09.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I'll help pitch the tents!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 sucrose 12.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I can help too.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 paimon 11a.ogg}} {{A|vo eqfh101 3 paimon 11b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... and Paimon will take {{MC|m=him|f=her}} to Good Hunter to order some starters. Mondstadt's [[Cold Cut Platter]] is not to be missed!
:{{DIcon}} Nice idea.
:{{DIcon}} Ah, I'm looking forward to it already.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 albedo 11.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Great. Then it's decided.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 3 albedo 12.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Sucrose and I will bring the three of you to your inn for a quick rest. You two, let's meet by the lake this evening.
----
;(Talk to Sara)
:{{A|vo eqfh101 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey Sara, can we have a Cold Cut Platter to go?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 4 sara 01.ogg}} '''Sara:''' Sure, coming right up!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 4 sara 02.ogg}} '''Sara:''' Would you like anything else?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, do we, uh, want anything else...?
:{{DIcon}} That'll be all.
::{{A|vo eqfh101 4 paimon 03a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... Okay, uh... yeah, that'll be all.
::{{DIcon}} You know what? Let's have a Sweet Madame as well.
::{{A|vo eqfh101 4 paimon 03a 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yay! You're the best person in the whole wide world!
:{{DIcon}} Ugh... if we must &mdash; one Sweet Madame, I guess.
::{{A|vo eqfh101 4 paimon 03b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yay, so you do remember after all! You're just the best!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon'll give you the Sweet Flower from that Sweet Madame as a Windblume!
:{{DIcon}} Just don't ruin your appetite for later.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehehe! No need to worry about that! Paimon can make room for good food!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 4 sara 03.ogg}} '''Sara:''' Haha, alright, just a moment...
:{{Black Screen|In the time it takes Sara to pack up the Cold Cut Platter, Paimon polishes off the entire Sweet Madame...}}
:{{A|vo eqfh101 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Mmm... That was great.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If that was a Windblume treat, then Paimon wishes it could be the Windblume Festival every day!
----
;(Approach the group at the campsite)
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Alright, looks like we're all here.
:{{DIcon}} We're not late, are we?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Not at all. We just came early to set everything up, since we happened to be free today.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Collei put up the tents so quickly, but still managed to tie very sturdy knots. You can really tell that she's a professional.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I didn't do much apart from passing materials around...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Heh, thanks...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' It's all thanks to Master and Cyno. They taught me everything I know...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' What can I say. For a skilled adventurer, this is just another day on the job.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Ugh... Are you quite finished, or were you going to sing each others praises till the moon rises? Come on, let's all sit down.
:{{Black Screen|Everyone brings out their food and starts cooking...}}
:{{Black Screen|After a delicious feast, everyone sits around the campfire...}}
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' That [[Sunshine Sprat]] was really very good. I didn't watch you cook it, but I believe that the prominent umami flavor of the dish owes itself to more than the fish alone.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' That's correct. Any further deductions?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Let me think... The aroma was quite uniform, unlike that of a spice blend. It was also unfamiliar to me, so I would venture that it was a Mondstadt specialty.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' As far as edible Mondstadt plant species are concerned, Calla Lilies are usually used in soups. So if I had to guess...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 05.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' [[Small Lamp Grass]]?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' That's right.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I've long heard that Sumeru's [[Fish With Cream Sauce|Fish with Cream Sauce]] is noted for its gentle texture, which brings out the tenderness of the fish.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 albedo 05.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Here in Mondstadt, we're not quite as varied in the use of spices as in Sumeru, but the principle of bringing certain distinct flavors to the forefront through combinations of natural ingredients is very much the same.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 06.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I liked it a lot.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 07.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I'm curious as to the exact ratio of ingredients...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 albedo 06.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I'll write a copy of the recipe for you.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 sucrose 04.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Would anyone like to try the nutrient-dense meal I made?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I'll have some.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 sucrose 05.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' What about you, Collei? It doesn't look like you've eaten very much. Is your appetite low at the moment?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Uh, no... I just don't eat a lot normally.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...
:;(Sucrose stands up and walks over to the cooking pot nearby)
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Um, sorry, I didn't mean to make things awkward...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Tighnari. While we were on the road, we spotted something white, walking on two legs. Was that Paimon?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 08.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Which day was this?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Just after passing through Stone Gate.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 09.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, Cyno, are you sure your eyes were working that day? Or maybe your hood was blocking your vision?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon always flies. There's no way she'd ever walk.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Is that right...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I thought that you'd maybe snacked on too many local... ground nuts.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 collei 06.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' No? Not funny?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Ground, you know, as in "ground up," but also "the ground"... ground nuts make you fall to the ground...
:{{DIcon}} Is no one gonna interject?
:{{DIcon}} Is no one gonna stop him from explaining?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 10.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Think of this as part of the process of getting to know Cyno. On the bright side, these jokes show that he thinks of you as his friends.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 albedo 07.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Still, we could test the hypothesis?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What hypothesis?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 albedo 08.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' That plant species indigenous to Mondstadt may have an effect on the motor functions of flying lifeforms.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Paimon's not your test subject!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, by your logic, wouldn't that mean that eating... say... [[Zaytun Peach]]es &mdash; that would make a sick Paimon peachy in no time, or something?
:{{DIcon}} Or that eating enough [[Lavender Melon]]s would... uh... have no effect.
:{{DIcon}} I say we put these theories to the test!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, not you too!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 collei 07.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Hahaha...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 collei 08.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I think {{Traveler}} and Paimon's conversations are more entertaining than Cyno's jokes.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...I see. You must have been keeping quiet about this grievance for quite some time now.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You seem much cheerier now that you're here in Mondstadt, Cyno. Actually, it feels like you're a completely different person!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 10.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' That's because I'm Cyno the Adventurer.
:{{DIcon}} That's not funny.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 11.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Hmm? It's not?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 11.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' In fairness, you only saw him in his work mode while you were in Sumeru. He's actually like this most of the time when he's in a good mood.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 collei 09.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Yep, it's true. Sometimes when he's eating, he'll grumble about how the bowl is too shallow for the amount of food it contains, and other random stuff like that.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 12.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I understand. Then allow me to reintroduce myself. Before, you knew me as General Mahamatra Cyno. Now, please see me as Cyno the Adventurer.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 12.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Yeah, so that's another thing he does! He'll keep repeating something he thinks is funny until you stop trying to resist.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 sucrose 06.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Hmm, so you have two different mental states? Almost like... different phases of matter? Interesting... I want to learn to do that, too!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 albedo 09.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I think in your case, the two states we would end up with would be highly conscientious Sucrose and stupefied Sucrose.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 albedo 10.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Oh, by the way &mdash; was there any reason in particular that you chose Mondstadt as your destination on this occasion?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 collei 10.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh, well, [[Lisa]] once told me that the Windblume Festival is one of Mondstadt's biggest events of the year.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 collei 11.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I wanted to take this opportunity to give everyone a Windblume, as a token of my heartfelt gratitude for everything they've done to look after me...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 13.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Plus, it was a good chance for Collei to get out and meet some new people.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 13.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' "Collei Lily."
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...What?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 14.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Collei's Windblume. Maybe she should call it a "Collei Lily." It sounds very Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 15.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' There's also "Collei Flower," which would technically make more sense, but somehow it doesn't sound as nice.
:;(The group quietly looks at Cyno for a while)
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 14.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' ...Moving swiftly on...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, he just completely ignored the joke and carried on the conversation. Guess sometimes, that's the only way forward.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 15.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' ...Sumeru's been through some major changes recently, and things at work have only just started to calm down.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 16.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I don't get many opportunities to take a vacation, and this was a chance to join Collei on her trip while also learning a few things about Mondstadt's flora and fauna that I'll be able to pass on to my peers and students on my return. Two birds with one stone.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How about you, Cyno?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 16.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I came to ensure Collei's safety.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 collei 12.ogg}} '''Collei:''' That's just an excuse, plain and simple.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 17.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 18.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Also... there's the matter of a [[Genius Invokation TCG]] custom-made card back.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aha! So you DID have an ulterior motive!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 19.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Have you all played Genius Invokation TCG before?
:{{DIcon}} I have.
::{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 20a 1.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' And that is why I am proud to call you my friend.
:{{DIcon}} I haven't.
::{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 20b 1.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Well, you should. For the sake of our continued friendship.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 21.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' When I first began contemplating getting a new card back, I asked around before eventually deciding to ask the legendary Mr. [[Calx]] for guidance.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 22.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' A friend of mine, [[Sawada]], whom I play cards with on occasion, had been to [[Inazuma]] for the [[Irodori Festival]]. He told me that Calx was a Mondstadter, so I should try my luck there.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Calx? Uh, isn't that...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 23.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' You mean, he's a friend of yours?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 albedo 11.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I see, so you came to Mondstadt in search of Calx.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 24.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' No, that is inaccurate. I came here principally to protect Collei.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 17.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' You most certainly did not. Collei's been here on the quiet numerous times, and this is the first time you felt the need to join.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 25.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Not only me. Same applies to you too, doesn't it?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 albedo 12.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' If [[Xingqiu|my writer friend]] were here now, I'm sure he would describe this curious coincidence as having the makings of a good story. It's always a pleasure to meet a fan.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohh, here it comes!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 26.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...Wait, you mean, you're Mr. Calx!?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 albedo 13.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Having my new friends address me by my pen name feels somewhat unusual. Please, just call me Albedo.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 18.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Huh. So you're Calx... Cyno's been talking about you non-stop recently. He's intent on getting you to design a bespoke card back for him.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 27.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Ugh, you didn't have to say all that...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 albedo 14.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I don't usually take private commissions, but I believe that we are friends now. All of us.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 albedo 15.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Our conversations have been deep and interesting. And Cyno, your passion for this game is indeed one of a kind. I can see it in your eyes.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 28.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Obviously.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 albedo 16.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' And given that you've come all this way from Sumeru to see me, I'd be quite honored to take this commission.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 collei 13.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Wow, your teacher's... so nice.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 sucrose 07.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I feel the same about yours. Hmm, well, they definitely have quite different personalities, but they're similar when it comes to their character.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 29.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' So. How much should I budget for the timeless masterpiece you will produce for me...?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 albedo 17.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Surely "timeless masterpiece" is something of an overstatement.

:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 tighnari 19.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Don't mind him &mdash; these TCG nut jobs are all like this...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 albedo 18.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I see. So this has an almost religious significance... Well, for starters, I'd like to hear a few more of your jokes.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 31.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' My jokes? You like them?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 albedo 19.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I do.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 cyno 32.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Really? I didn't see you laughing.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 5 albedo 20.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Well, a joke's ability to induce laughter is a separate matter. But I certainly find them fun.

;(Talk to Albedo, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I'd be grateful if you could check on Sucrose. As for our new friends here... leave them to me.

;(Talk to Collei, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' The cooking pot... Is everything okay?

;(Talk to Cyno, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Hmm. So, a good joke is not necessarily required to make people laugh at them...

;(Talk to Tighnari, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Well, Albedo and Sucrose were delightful... but this was still an exhausting meal.

;(Talk to Sucrose)
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Phew. Only the base is burned. We can still use the cooking pot, it just needs a bit of a wash.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good thing Tighnari's nose is so sharp... Has he been in this kind of situation a lot before?
:{{DIcon}} Don't let it get you down, Sucrose.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' *sigh* I know, it's just... I'm sorry to disappoint Cyno. I guess we'll have to do this again another day.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Ah, yes. I'm not sure if you've noticed...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 04.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Collei seems a little... depressed. I noticed she was in a low mood when everyone was talking.
:{{DIcon}} Is she?
:{{DIcon}} I get that feeling as well.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 05.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Remember that note she received?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 06.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I was just thinking. I wanna try solving this riddle and giving Collei the chance to accept the blessing.

:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 07.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Exactly.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 08.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Maybe she'll be willing to breathe into my test tube... But anyway, that can wait.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 09.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' As much as I'd like to make progress in my research, I'd prefer to see her smile.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright! We'll help out too.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 10.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' You will? Then tell me, honestly... Do you... think that this prophecy is for real, too?
:{{DIcon}} I know how I can find out.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Huh... right.
:{{DIcon}} I'll be back shortly.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 11.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Alright. Let's meet at the alchemy crafting bench in the city. I've got some thinking to do in the meantime.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 12.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' We're back.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Ah, what a shame. You just missed a joke about windmills.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Stop. Please. I don't need to hear it a fifth time.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That bad, huh? Hmm, now Paimon really wants to hear it for some reason...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Didn't you say you want to see the [[Dvalin|Dragon of the East]] at some point? When are you going?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Tomorrow morning.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' And you? What are your plans?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I'll go into the mountains to have a stroll and collect a few plants as samples.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Perhaps I could join you? I'll be looking for inspiration for these card back illustrations.
:;(Amber and [[Eula]] run in)
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Found you!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' I knew I was onto something as soon as I saw the fire.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 13.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Wow, you have really sharp eyes!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' That's an Outrider for you.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh-oh... did we break the fire safety rules or something?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Actually, you didn't. Strictly speaking, you should have reported your plans first, but since two of our very own alchemists are here... I'm happy to look the other way, hehe...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 ambor 04.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Ah, yes, introductions! I'm Amber, and this is the Reconnaissance Company Captain, Eula, a good friend of mine.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Good evening. You're friends of Collei, yes? A pleasure to meet you.
:{{Introductory Note|Eula}}
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Oh, Amber and Eula! The pleasure is ours. I've heard a lot about both of you from Collei.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 ambor 05.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Oh really? All positive, I hope...?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' You asked that last time too! ...&nbsp;Of course it was positive...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I'd say... we hear the latest news about you every time you write to Collei.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 ambor 06.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Haha, glad to know we've made a good impression so far! Anyway, we're just here to collect Collei, so don't let us interrupt your chat.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 ambor 07.ogg}} '''Amber:''' C'mon, Collei! We're gonna take you to check out a few scenic spots.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Okay, great!
:;(Collei leaves)
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Heh... Still as high-energy as always.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm? You know Amber?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Yes, we've met. She's Collei's most important friend, and for that we're also very grateful to her.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's Amber for you. Her outgoing personality means she can make friends with just about anybody.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 sucrose 14.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' It's getting late, and we still have a lot lined up tomorrow. I suggest we all head back and get some rest.
:{{DIcon}} Yes. We should preserve our energy.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 6 tighnari 05.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Alright. I'll start packing up.
:{{Black Screen|Everyone packs up and says their goodbyes in the dark of night...}}
:{{A|vo eqfh101 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're gonna get the Tone-Deaf Bard to check out that note, aren't you?
:{{DIcon}} That's right.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, guess Paimon knows you pretty well, huh?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Knowing him, he should be hitting the taverns around this time!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We can go corner him and make him answer our questions. Let's move!

;(Approach Venti)
:{{A|vo eqfh101 8 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Oho, it's been a while!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon called it! Tone-Deaf Bard, drinking as usual!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Put your drink down and get your game face on. We've got some important questions for you, mister.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 8 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Uh... Okay...
:{{Black Screen|You tell Venti about the mysterious prophecy...}}
:{{A|vo eqfh101 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, what do you make of it?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, any thoughts?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 8 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hehe, aren't you forgetting something? It's the Windblume Festival right now. You can't just go around asking people for help so blatantly.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, if you won't tell us the answer, could you at least tell us if this thing's worth a shot?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 8 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Sounds to me like you want a hint or two?
:{{DIcon}} And a blessing or two to boot.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 8 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hehe, a fine answer.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 8 venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' The person who wrote this prophecy is very powerful. If you manage to solve the riddle, good things are sure to happen.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 8 venti 07.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Also... I happen to know where this lantern is.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 8 venti 08.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Once you've found the four things, I'll even write the location down for you. Isn't that generous of me?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmph, whatever. We weren't expecting much from you anyway.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You can get back to guzzling wine and blowing wind now, hmph!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 8 venti 09.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Oh, woe is me... Paimon sees me as nothing more than a drunken wastrel...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 8 venti 10.ogg}} '''Venti:''' There are actually a great many things that we bards are required to do... It just happens that enjoying life is the most important one.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 8 venti 11.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Once this is over, would you like to join me for a drink?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 8 venti 12.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Y'know... A favor for a favor?

;(Talk to Venti again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Or given the way that you're staring at me, perhaps... you'd like to get me that drink now?
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I, of course, would be most amenable to that... but I believe you have friends waiting for you?
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Don't worry! There'll be plenty of time during the festival.

;(Approach Sucrose)
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' "A flower that is not of this world." Hmm, not of this world...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sucrose! We've got some good news and some bad news. Which would you like to hear first?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Um... Let's have the bad news first, I guess.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, really? Don't most people usually want to hear the good stuff first?
:{{DIcon}} Just get to the point, Paimon.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, alright then... Basically, we went to [[Windrise]] to divine the breeze.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The wind said that the prophecy is real, and that your idea is a really good one.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' That doesn't sound like bad news... So what's the real bad news, then?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Paimon ate the bad news, hehe~!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Blame Cyno! If it's not funny, then it's his fault!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 04.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Hehe... It's fine. Well, that puts my mind at rest.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 05.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Now, back to the other issue I've been mulling over.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 06.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I was thinking about the flower that is "not of this world." It could mean a human-cultivated variety that doesn't occur in nature... But that's basically claiming that it doesn't come from this world in the first place, when actually it's just a variant of an existing breed.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 07.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' So the initial question is: Can the flower's origins be traced back to a natural organism? If so, it cannot be correctly described as "not of this world."
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 08.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' But then... supposing we identified something outside of that category, whose job would it be to decide whether it belongs in this world or not? Then the question becomes: Do "of this world" and "from this world" mean the same thing... or is it deeper than that?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, whoa, slow down... Paimon's head is already starting to spin.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 09.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Okay. Um... I did have one other line of thought as well. What about a flower created using alchemy? Would that be "not of this world"?
:{{DIcon}} If by that, you mean a flower from beyond this world...
:{{DIcon}} Albedo did make something like that once.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 10.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Albedo may know the answer, but asking him right away would be like asking the teacher for the answers to your exam paper.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 11.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' It would render our search for the truth meaningless. I'd rather try and figure this out for myself...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Could it be the "Windblume"?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 12.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Oh... now that you mention it, that's definitely a possibility.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 13.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' The Windblume doesn't refer to a specific flower. Everyone defines what it means for themselves.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 14.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' In which case, the "Windblume" doesn't exist in reality... Hmm. This does seem like a promising direction!
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 15.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I've made a note! Okay, I'd better go read up on this...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yay! Paimon was actually useful this time! Guess we have that Sweet Madame to thank, huh?
:{{DIcon}} Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
:{{DIcon}} We're counting on you for the rest, Paimon.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 16.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I'll need some time to prepare. Could we meet up here in, say, two days' time?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure thing. In the meantime, we'll also think about the other three riddles in the prophecy.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But uh, since we're really going for this now... Shouldn't we say something to Collei about it?
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 17.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I originally wanted to leave it as a surprise for her, and I also didn't want to get her hopes up over nothing...
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 18.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' But you're right, Paimon. I'll need to be careful how I word it... but I'll try to find some time over the next couple days to mention it to her.
:{{DIcon}} Understood.
:{{A|vo eqfh101 9 sucrose 19.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Alright. Thanks so much!

:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I've heard that Cecilias only grow in remote spots at high-altitude, and that you're unlikely to ever see one unless you go looking for it.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Though they can be preserved for a long time as specimens, I can't take back the beauty they possess in the wild. It's a shame.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Shall I ask Sucrose to develop a Cecilia variant with improved soil adaptability for you?
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I should warn you, though, it may very well end up with a name like "Tetratanic Ananemo Cecilia," or perhaps "Epsilon-Series Cecilia, Variation 601, Sumeru Growth-Type."
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' ...Is this you attempting to tell a joke?

:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 dehya 07.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' You've probably got a lot going on yourself, I'll bet? Good luck with everything!

Candace and Setaria only appear if {{Quest|Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises}} has been completed.
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Candace or Setaria at [[Aaru Village]])
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 candace 01.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Setaria, you should take a break and have a bite to eat.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 candace 02.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Setaria?
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 setare 01.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Ah, thank you! Sorry, I was completely absorbed in what I was doing, I didn't even hear your voice...
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 candace 03.ogg}} '''Candace:''' It's alright. I'm glad that you enjoy the work you're doing.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 setare 02.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' Sorry you've ended up having to babysit me... I'm sure you have far more important things to do.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 candace 04.ogg}} '''Candace:''' Well, Rahman's busy with the Eremites these days. But having me stand in as your bodyguard must be a welcome breath of fresh air for you?
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 candace 05.ogg}} '''Candace:''' It's a change for me, too &mdash; my first time working as a bodyguard. I'm just treating it as a chance to get a taste of Dehya's line of work.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 setare 03.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' I tried telling Mahamatra Cyno that I can work unsupervised. Really, this ought to be the last of his worries...
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 setare 04.ogg}} '''Setaria:''' He said that educators willing to work in the desert are an extremely rare breed, so I need a bodyguard for protection at all times... I think he's being a little overprotective.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 candace 06.ogg}} '''Candace:''' But at the end of the day, that's why we know we can count on the General Mahamatra. He and I are of the same mind in this case, so I am very happy to protect you.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh101 candace 07.ogg}} '''Candace:''' While you're in Aaru Village, we're partners. We don't want to cause you any unnecessary pressure. So please, try to enjoy your time here.
