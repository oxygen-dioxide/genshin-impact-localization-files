{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Upon approaching Collei's house)
:'''Paimon:''' This should be Collei's house, right? But no one's home...
:'''Paimon:''' Is she out on patrol? She must've left in a hurry, look at that notebook on the table...
:'''Paimon:''' But that flower seems wilted...

;(Read Collei's note)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? What are you looking at?
:{{DIcon}} There are notes about taking care of flowers in this notebook.
:'''Paimon:''' Really? Paimon wants to see...
:'''Paimon:''' "... Should be placed in open space, and receive plenty of sunshine..."
:'''Paimon:''' Guess Collei didn't have the time to move it outside.
:'''Paimon:''' Hee-hee, let's take care of it for Collei then.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Anyway, we should move the flower first. Let's put it beside the house.
:'''Paimon:''' Don't put it too far away, or Collei will be worried if she can't find it when she's back.

;(Place flower outside)
:'''Paimon:''' Okay, Paimon will leave this flower here to grow.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Let's leave Collei a letter and tell her that we moved the flower out.
:'''Paimon:''' Otherwise, she might think someone broke into her house.
:{{Black Screen|You and Paimon leave a letter behind for Collei...}}
----
;(After daily reset)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, the flower is getting better.
:'''Paimon:''' But... Collei is still out...

;(Read Collei's letter)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, this letter seems to be written by Collei. Let's check it out.
:{{DIcon}} But why isn't she here...
:'''Paimon:''' Might be out working with Tighnari again. They have always been really busy.
:'''Paimon:''' Come on, read the letter. Just looking at this writing, Paimon bets Collei pressed down her pen really hard on this letter...
:'''Paimon:''' "{{Traveler}} and Paimon, thanks for caring for my flower."
:'''Paimon:''' "We have so many things to deal with in the forest, and it's easy to forget about things when we get busy..."
:'''Paimon:''' "Thanks again for your help. Let's eat some [[Potato Boat]]s at Mr. [[Jahangir]]'s place when I have some free time!"
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Collei is gonna give us a treat! Paimon will write this down and remember it by heart.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Paimon still has no idea what Collei is working on. She seems to have her hands full.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon hopes she's still getting enough sleep...
