'''Weinlesefest''' is a festival in [[Mondstadt]] that celebrates the return of the [[Anemo Archon]] when the west wind blows every fall during the harvest season. Citizens celebrate by brewing fresh wine, keeping it sealed until Windcoming Day, during which the wine is uncasked as a symbolic way of inviting the Anemo Archon to share a drink. If the Anemo Archon is satisfied with the wine, a gentle breeze is summoned to bless the people.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Sounds From Afar (Quest)}}</ref>
