==Profile==
Arasaka and his "family" met the [[Traveler's Sibling]] sometime before the [[cataclysm]], where he and his brothers became interested in cooking after watching them cook. However, they quickly ended up arguing and were kicked out of Vanarana by [[Arapacati]], where they went their separate ways.

Arasaka later befriended [[Iaanesh]] in his youth, where they enjoyed sugar, which he considered the "taste of happiness." Wanting to replicate the taste to his family, he sought to find it again while taking care of a [[Zaytun Peach]] crop. After the [[Traveler]] discovered the Aranara, they were tasked by Arapacati to find her brothers to begin [[Festival Utsava]].

The Traveler found Arasaka near [[Gandharva Ville]], where he was taking care of a Zaytun Peach crop. However, he was too obsessed with the crop, so the Traveler attempted to pick the peaches to get his attention. After realizing they were a good Nara, he agreed to return to Vanarana if they could bring him the "taste of happiness," which he described as white and crumbly. The Traveler managed to find Arasaka's friend and acquired the item, [[sugar]].

Returning to Arasaka, he thanked them for bringing the sugar and made his dish of overly sweetened peaches. He gave the recipe to them, which Paimon managed to salvage as a more appealing [[Selva Salad]].

Once the brothers returned to Vanarana, they were all scolded by Arapacati. When the festival began, the Traveler gave Arasaka and the others some [[Radish Veggie Soup]], although Arasaka did not enjoy it, claiming that the "taste of happiness" was fleeing from him.

During the first [[Sabzeruz Festival]] after Kusanali was freed, she had several Aranara, including Arasaka, partake in the festivities and had them hide around various locations in the rainforest. While looking for clues around [[Pardis Dhyai]], the Traveler and Paimon ran into Arasaka, who was terrified of their presence. After being reminded they were friends, Arasaka revealed that he was told by Arapas to not say anything. Paimon asked if they had seen a [[Nilou|red Nara]], which he confirmed and pointed them to where she had gone. Once the festivity officially started, Nahida had them reveal themselves, surprising the people &mdash; it was also why Arasaka was flustered, as he wanted to keep her surprise a secret.

After the celebration, Arasaka would return to Pardis Dhyai, where he met [[Sorush]]. Sorush asked him how the Aranara were able to protect the entire rainforest for hundreds of years whereas the Pari struggled to protect smaller domain of [[Vourukasha Oasis]]. Arasaka did not understand her question and instead told her that he would make delicious food for her, practice Ararakalari and find lots of "tracers."

===Appearance===
Arasaka has a medium-large Aranara build with his body and arms being bright yellow. He also wears a green hat that is filled with various plants.
