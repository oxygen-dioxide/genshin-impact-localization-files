'''Hiromi''' {{Lang|ja=広海}} is an [[NPC]] located in [[Inazuma]].

If the collectible [[Someone's Drifting Bottle|Drifting Bottle]] in [[Dragonspine]] has not been obtained, he will instead be at the beach at [[Ritou]]. Otherwise, he will be in [[Inazuma City]], located on the beach to the west of a Teleport Waypoint. After completing the World Quest ''[[Hiromi's Watch]]'', he will return to Ritou.

He has been sending the Drifting Bottles to [[Yan'er]], a [[Treasure Hoarders|Treasure Hoarder]], who the player has previously had dealings with.

==Profile==
Hiromi is a Kanjou Commission Officer who wishes to see his childhood friend "Big Sis" (Yan'er) in [[Liyue]] again. He is unable to visit her due to the [[Sakoku Decree]], so instead has written her many letters in drifting bottles, which can be found washed up on Dragonspine. He and Yan'er have also been good friends with [[Shun]] since they were young.

He appears to have a crush on Yan'er, and upon completing Hiromi's Watch, plans to go on a date with her to [[Uyuu Restaurant]], like mentioned in this letters.

Shun and Yan'er are not too fond of the fact that Hiromi ended up as an Officer, often poking fun at him for it, because they themselves ended up becoming Treasure Hoarders. Hiromi therefore has to keep his friendship with them secret, due to potential punishments he could receive from his superiors in the Shogunate. Shun jokes that Hiromi will come to arrest him, while Yan'er pretends to not know who Hiromi is.

===Personality===
''(To be added.)''

Hiromi wears a purple-gray ''shitagi'', grey ''kobakama'', white socks, and ''waraji'' sandals.

He is equipped with a ''juumonji yari'' (cross-shaped spear), whose shaft is lavender colored, and contains the Shogunate crest under the spearhead.
