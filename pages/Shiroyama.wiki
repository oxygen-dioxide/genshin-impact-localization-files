'''Shiroyama''' was a former member of the [[Police Station]] and an important figure in [[Ryuuji]]'s case several years ago, which ended in the murder of [[Takatsukasa Isamu]]. While Ryuuji was originally scapegoated for the murder, [[Sango]] and [[Shikanoin Heizou]] correctly identified Shiroyama as the true murderer. Shiroyama was pressured into committing suicide to hide the circumstances behind Takatsukasa's death.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Long-Sealed Mystery}}</ref>
