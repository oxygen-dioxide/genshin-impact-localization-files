Originally part of an exorcist clan, Shenhe originally had a happy life as a child until her father attempted to sacrifice her to a malevolent god in order to bring back his wife. While Shenhe managed to defeat the remnants of the god herself, the incident scarred her for life, believing herself to be a "cursed" child and began growing a homicidal tendency. Despite the adepti's attempts to contain it, they have only done so by binding her soul with [[Red Ropes]], which has also caused her to become mostly indifferent.

Even with the red ropes suppressing her homicidial tendencies, Shenhe often contemplates the most violent means to eliminate others and is almost always easy to anger, obliterating her surroundings whenever her emotions get the best of her.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Ganyu|About Shenhe}}</ref> She throws hostile looks at [[Xingqiu]], believing him to be threatening others.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Shenhe|About Xingqiu}}</ref> Despite this, Shenhe ultimately wishes to fit in human society and places great trust in the [[Traveler]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Crane Returns on the Wind}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/VO|Xiao|About Shenhe}}</ref> She prefers speaking with a small numbers of people at a time.

As a result of living with the adepti, many of her fellow people worship her as one of them, something which deeply troubles her despite stating that she is just an adepti's disciple. She enjoys sampling small quantities of foods in a manner similar to [[Albedo]]. Due to having a limited diet in the mountains, Shenhe is used to eating plenty of herbs despite clearly despising their taste.

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3 paragraphs with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Shenhe is a relatively tall woman with a fair complexion. She has long silvery-white gradient hair which then fades to black at the tips. Her hair is parted off-center with evenly cut locks that flow just past chin-length framing her face, one side covering her right eye, the rest styled in a low, loose, thick braid fastened at the top with a red cord tied in a bow with her Cryo Vision mounted on it.

Her outfit consists of a black backless bodysuit that fades into turquoise at the legs. It extends to her hands, covering her middle fingers with a gold stud on each of the knuckles. At the back of her bodysuit is an article bearing resemblance to coattails, consisting of white fabric patterned with gray. She wears a cropped white-and-gray sleeveless qipao on top.

Her accessories consist of a detailed white-and-black curved headpiece and a red cloverleaf knot with a tassel as an earring on her right ear.

{{Quote|One has traversed many realms and taken a great many pupils. Among them, Shenhe breaks the closest resemblance to oneself. Were she not a mortal, one would like to have her stay by my side.|[[Cloud Retainer]]}}
Shenhe comes from a branch family of a clan of exorcists. Due to certain reasons, Cloud Retainer took her in as a disciple.

To Shenhe, Cloud Retainer is a knowledgeable and chatty master.

To Cloud Retainer, Shenhe stands out as special from amongst the mortals she has instructed.

Living with adepti as a human is by no means an easy task, but Shenhe has a unique constitution, an immensely strong will, and a great talent for adepti arts, all of which have won her the acknowledgment of the adepti. However, the long years of cultivation, coupled with the habit of eating divine herbs and drinking the dew of the mountains, have made her more and more distant from earthly life, and she has even been regarded as a mysterious white-haired adeptus.

The occasional sharpness in her personality and the red ropes adorning her body add to her "mystery". If her past were to be written as a story, there would be multiple versions for sure.

Be it an immortal or a white-haired witch, how will people view this mysterious lady? Her secrets and feelings are as difficult to capture as the drifting clouds in the mountains.

I simply get rid of them to prevent them from disturbing my master's meditations."</p><p>"If some people did wind up getting caught in the crossfire and injured...

But to Shenhe, any solution that is not the simplest and most direct one may as well not exist.</p><p>For example, she almost never considers "negotiation" as a solution to being at cross-purposes with others, mostly resorting to "threats" instead. After all, it is simple and efficacious. A good solution, no?</p><p>She has also spent much time ruminating on problems that are truly esoteric.</p><p>For example: Why do we need to pay for food?</p><p>Is there any difference between intimidating civilians and intimidating bandits?</p><p>She even truly believes that her master, Cloud Retainer, is a most brilliant and eloquent conversationalist.</p><p>In a certain sense, she can be considered very pure.</p><p>Much like a child, she relies on her chaotic yet straightforward intuition and logic to get her through life.</p><p>Mountain Shaper once had this to say about her:</p><p>"Little Shenhe is not only stronger than most — she also possesses a unique character."</p><p>"She knows not the world, understands not common sense, distinguishes few cuisines, and acknowledges no hierarchies."</p><p>"It may not be such an easy thing for Cloud Retainer to tutor her."</p>

If anything, it was an experience characterized by anguish.</p><p>When she was five, her mother passed away, and her father, having loved his wife dearly, found that agony hard to bear.</p><p>Over time, this agony turned into resentment, and this resentment birthed obsession, by which he was driven wandering throughout the land like a man gone mad.</p><p>He left for close to a year, never stopping, never able to sleep soundly, ever searching for some technique that might bring his wife back.</p><p>At last, when the year was almost out, he returned in joyous frenzy.</p><p>Her father had brought with him a secret art known as "Fate Transference"—</p><p>By making a ritual sacrifice to the seelie summoned by this art, a living person's body could be exchanged for a dead one's life.</p><p>At that time, Shenhe was yet utterly unaware of the disaster that would befall. She was only an ordinary child, overjoyed at her long-absent father's return.</p><p>He claimed that he had a surprise awaiting her in a cave in the mountains behind and that he would take her there immediately. She was ecstatic...</p><p>But the scene that followed would be burned into her mind forever.</p><p>Her father summoned that hideous, horrifying black "seelie" into that cave, its blood-red eyes craving her delectable life-force.</p><p>Stupefied, Shenhe knew not from whence it had come, nor what it wanted from this place.</p><p>Crises often paralyze people. One thought only, however, crept into the young Shenhe's mind.</p><p>This creature wanted to eat her, but she did not want to die. She wanted to live!</p><p>Gripping her mother's keepsake, an exorcism dagger, she faced that dark "seelie," trembling yet resolute...</p><p>Several days later, [[Cloud Retainer|an adeptus]] following the trail of great evil would investigate the cave, only to find the little girl collapsed inside — spent, famished, parched, her life hanging by a thread.</p><p>Taking pity on the lass' ruinous fate, and seeing that she possessed great talent, having repelled some terrifying force on her own, the adeptus would bring her back, heal her, and instruct her in the adeptal path.</p><p>If not for that, Shenhe would not be as she is today.

She was merely driven by some nebulous desire:</p><p>To live in the house that was once hers, and to see what became of her father, lost in his obsession.</p><p>She learned from neighbors that he had passed away several years prior only when she got there.</p><p>Her childhood home had also been demolished by pawnbrokers — and thus had all the traces of her memory dissipated.</p><p>She did not care about the attention she was attracting, and did not answer a single one of the questions asked by those in the vicinity.</p><p>She simply stood there, listening to the howls that swept through the depths of her heart.</p><p>Was it hatred? Mania? Relief?</p><p>They were all there, and yet none tarried for even an instant.

And something strange happened then — for as the jade comb brushed through Shenhe's hair once, a layer of her black locks turned a frosty silver from root to tip.</p><p>On the second brush, but half her hair remained dark.</p><p>When the process was complete, only a flowing curtain of snow remained.</p><p>...</p><p>Today, Shenhe still keeps this comb on her person as a symbol of her connection to the adepti.</p><p>Through her years of training, she has long since come to understand the meaning behind those three brush strokes:</p><p>The first to uproot useless anxiety, the second to forsake joy and sorrow, and the third to walk this path into old age without regret.</p>

==Trivia==
*The English version refers to Shenhe's murderous tendencies as homicidal, however in the Chinese translation, it refers more broadly to a murderous intent towards one's self as well as others. This is clarified in her Story 5.
*Shenhe's hair changing from black to white taken to mean "combing away worries" is ironic, in the sense that usually the early onset of white hair means that one is full of worries. This irony is also highlighted in her namecard's description.
*[[Chongyun]] refers to Shenhe as his "aunt". Based on their voice-overs, they are blood-related and hail from the same clan, although the English translation does not indicate which side of the family they are related by.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Chongyun|About Shenhe}}</ref>
**In the Chinese translation, Chongyun calls Shenhe xiǎoyí (小姨) which specifically refers to "aunt" as the youngest sister/female cousin of the speaker's mother. This would mean that Shenhe is Chongyun's maternal aunt. Shenhe was not mentioned to have any siblings, meaning that she is likely one of the cousins of Chongyun's mother.
*According to [[Records of a Changing Village]], a branch family of exorcists used to live in the east of the village. However, the mother would die of illness, the young daughter would go missing, and shortly after, the father would hang himself on a tree in the yard of his own house. The young daughter of this family is implied to be Shenhe.
*Although Shenhe's stories clearly state that she did not learn any exorcist arts from her family, she is able to use techniques similar to exorcist arts. Chongyun refers to Shenhe as "an adept exorcist" upon witnessing her abilities. Although there is no clear explanation, it is possible that the adeptal arts which were taught to Shenhe by Cloud Retainer are related to exorcist techniques (the latter might have descended from the former).
* Shenhe is seen wielding [[Calamity Queller]] in her official art.
* Shenhe is known by these aliases or titles:
** Divine Damsel of Devastation

===Etymology===
* Shēnhè (申鹤) means "immortal crane", using an old meaning of the word 申. In the past, the word shēn (申) meant "immortal" in the sense of Taoist {{w|Xian (Taoism)|''xian''}}, also known as Chinese immortals, whom the adepti are modeled after. However, the word shén (神) has now replaced it to describe "divinity" (lit: "god"), while 申 no longer has a standalone meaning. The use of 申 rather than 神 in her name could be a play on her being close to (or mistaken as one of) the adepti, but not being an adeptus herself.
** It may be also intended to be a synonym for {{Lang|''xiānhè''|zh=仙鹤|zh_lit=crane of ''xian'' (immortals, adepti)}}, a poetic name for the {{w|red-crowned crane}} in Mandarin. The red-crowned crane is regarded as one of the most beautiful and sacred birds in the Chinese culture and considered to be a riding animal of ''xian''. The red accent color of Shenhe's attire may be inspired by the color pattern of this crane.
* Shenhe's constellation in Chinese "Scattering of Worries" (愁疏座 ) contains the play of the words "comb" and "scatter" found in her namecard's description.
