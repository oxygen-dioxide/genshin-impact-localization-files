'''Menogias''', also known as '''General Kapisas''', was an [[adeptus]] and one of the five foremost [[Yaksha]]s.

==Profile==
Menogias was among those who answered [[Morax]]'s summons to aid his fight against the demons that spawned from the remains of defeated gods during and after the [[Archon War]]. Of the many yakshas, Menogias was one of the five strongest alongside [[Bosacius]], [[Bonanus]], [[Indarias]], and [[Xiao|Alatus]].<ref name=":0">{{Ref/Book|Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti}}</ref>

Xiao mentioned that Menogias had a hobby of designing intricately beautiful clothes.<ref name=":1">{{Ref/Quest|Between Facades and Familiar Faces}}</ref> [[Rex Lapis]] was notably quite fond of Kapisas' designs and collected many for his own wardrobe, including [[Hermit of Mortal Life|the suit he wears]] in his [[Zhongli|mortal form]] today. One of Bosacius' memories during ''Only Old Memories Remain'' shows Menogias attempting to convince Bosacius to wear a purple robe. It can be assumed that he was unsuccessful, as Bosacius is never shown actually wearing it.

This hobby is expanded upon by a recollection from [[Xianyun]]. She says that he once made Bonanus a dress that she secretly complained was too long for her to use in battle. When Xianyun asked him about this, he said that the train of the skirt would serve to enhance her adeptal countenance by exemplifying a certain elegance. She also said that he was pretty stubborn about the topic of clothing that not even Rex Lapis himself could change the yaksha's mind.<ref>Event [[Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze]] Quest: Part 3: ''[[A Cloud-Sea Appeal, a Brilliance Revealed (Quest)|A Cloud-Sea Appeal, a Brilliance Revealed]]''</ref>

Menogias eventually succumbed to karmic debt and perished. It is implied that he and Bonanus killed each other in a battle.

===Etymology===
* Menogias' English title, General Kapisas, is derived from {{Lang|mini=1|sa={{wt|कपीश}}|sa_rm=Kapīśa|sa_lit=Monkey God}}, one of the names of the Hindu god {{W|Hanuman}}.
* Menogias' Chinese title, {{zh|心猿大将|tl=General Xīnyuán|lit=General Mind-Monkey,}} is derived from the Buddhist term {{w|monkey mind}}, used to describe someone who is capricious, restless, and cannot be contained. It is often associated with, and embodied by, the mythological figure {{w|Sun Wukong}}, who was a monkey born from a rock.
