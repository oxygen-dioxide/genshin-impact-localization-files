{{Lang|'''Menogias'''|zh=弥怒|zh_rm=Mínù}}, also known as {{lang|'''General Kapisas'''|zh=心猿大将}}, was an [[adeptus]] and one of the five foremost [[Yaksha]]s.

==Profile==
Menogias was among those who answered [[Morax]]'s summons to aid his fight against the demons that spawned from the remains of defeated gods during and after the [[Archon War]]. Of the many yakshas, Menogias was one of the five strongest alongside [[Bosacius]], [[Bonanus]], [[Indarias]], and [[Xiao|Alatus]].<ref>{{Ref/Book|Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti}}</ref>

In one of Bosacius' memories during ''Only Old Memories Remain'', Menogias attempts to convince Bosacius to wear a purple robe. However, the robe only had two arms, much to the bafflement of the four-armed yaksha.

Menogias eventually succumbed to the karmic debt accrued from endless slaughter and perished. Bonanus and him are implied to have killed each other in a battle.

==Trivia==
*The official Chinese description for ''Only Old Memories Remain'' accidentally misspelled Menogias' Japanese voice actor, {{lang|Kuze Shuichi|ja=久瀬秋一}}, as {{lang|mini=1|zh=久濑秋一}},<ref name="VA" /> which uses the Simplified Chinese character {{lang|mini=1|zh=濑}} instead of the Japanese {{w|Shinjitai}} form {{lang|mini=1|ja=瀬}}.
* The Japanese VA of this character confirmed in a [https://twitter.com/shu1_qz/status/1532479290809659392 tweet] that his credited character is the {{Lang|ja=岩夜叉|mini=1}} or Rock Yaksha.

===Etymology===
* Menogias' English title, General Kapisas, is derived from {{Lang|mini=1|sa={{wt|कपीश}}|sa_rm=Kapīśa|sa_lit=Monkey God}}, one of the names of the Hindu god {{W|Hanuman}}.
*Menogias' Chinese title, {{lang|mini=1|zh=心猿大将|zh_tl=General Xīnyuán|zh_lit=General Mind-Monkey}}, is derived from the Buddhist term {{w|monkey mind}}, used to describe someone who is capricious, restless, and cannot be contained. It is often associated with, and embodied by, the mythological figure {{w|Sun Wukong}}, who was a monkey born from a rock.
