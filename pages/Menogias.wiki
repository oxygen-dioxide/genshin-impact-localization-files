'''Menogias''', also known as '''General Kapisas''', was an [[adeptus]] and one of the five foremost [[Yaksha]]s.

==Profile==
Menogias was among those who answered [[Morax]]'s summons to aid his fight against the demons that spawned from the remains of defeated gods during and after the [[Archon War]]. Of the many yakshas, Menogias was one of the five strongest alongside [[Bosacius]], [[Bonanus]], [[Indarias]], and [[Xiao|Alatus]].<ref name=":0">{{Ref/Book|Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti}}</ref>

Xiao mentioned that he had a hobby of designing intricately beautiful clothes.<ref name=":1">{{Ref/Quest|Between Facades and Familiar Faces}}</ref> Rex Lapis' was quite fond of Kapisas' designs and collected many for his own wardrobe, including [[Hermit of Mortal Life|the suit he wears]] in his [[Zhongli|mortal form]] today. Bosacius however, was quite the opposite. In one of Bosacius' memories during ''Only Old Memories Remain'', Menogias attempts to convince Bosacius to wear a purple robe. However, the robe only had two arms, much to the bafflement of the four-armed yaksha.

Menogias eventually succumbed to the karmic debt accrued from endless slaughter and perished. Bonanus and him are implied to have killed each other in a battle.

==Trivia==
* The Japanese VA of this character confirmed in a [https://twitter.com/shu1_qz/status/1532479290809659392 tweet] that his credited character is the {{ja|岩夜叉}} or Rock Yaksha.

===Etymology===
* Menogias' English title, General Kapisas, is derived from {{Lang|mini=1|sa={{wt|कपीश}}|sa_rm=Kapīśa|sa_lit=Monkey God}}, one of the names of the Hindu god {{W|Hanuman}}.
* Menogias' Chinese title, {{zh|心猿大将|tl=General Xīnyuán|lit=General Mind-Monkey,}} is derived from the Buddhist term {{w|monkey mind}}, used to describe someone who is capricious, restless, and cannot be contained. It is often associated with, and embodied by, the mythological figure {{w|Sun Wukong}}, who was a monkey born from a rock.
