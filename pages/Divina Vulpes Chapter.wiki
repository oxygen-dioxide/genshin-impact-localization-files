{{Description|"If you speak a special incantion in the dead of night, your wish will come true, whatever it is!"<br />Such rumors have been spreading throughout [[Inazuma]]'s streets and alleys and have gained quite the ardent following amongst people.<br />A swordmaster whose behavior has been out of sorts, a storied light novel, and it's mysterious author... Does the plot stop here, or is there more to it? The truth shall come to light on a moonless night.<br />All feasts will end, and all banquets will cease. See them off with a big smile, and thus bring the past, at last, to an end.}}
