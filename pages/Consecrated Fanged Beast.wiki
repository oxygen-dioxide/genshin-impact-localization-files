* During this attack, the Consecrated Fanged Beast will temporarily exit '''Phagocytic Form''' and spawn a Phagocytic Energy Block that lasts for '''6''' seconds.
** The Phagocytic Energy Block can be destroyed using a single {{Dendro}} attack or 6 non-Dendro elemental attacks.
** If destroyed, the active character will obtain a status that lasts for 10 seconds:
*** While the status is active, all party members will lose '''2%''' of their Max [[HP]] every second.
*** The next time a [[Normal Attack|Normal]]/[[Charged Attack|Charged]]/[[Plunging Attack|Plunging]] Attack, [[Elemental Skill]] or [[Elemental Burst]] hits the Consecrated Fanged Beast, the status is consumed and it will lose '''15%''' of its Max HP and become paralyzed.
*** If the status expires after 10 seconds, the Consecrated Fanged Beast will re-enter '''Phagocytic Form'''.
** If not destroyed in time, the Consecrated Fanged Beast will reabsorb the Phagocytic Energy Block and re-enter '''Phagocytic Form'''.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A predator that has mutated after feeding from greater lifeforms.<br>Survival of the fittest is written in the law of nature. But pets and Consecrated Beasts are exceptions. Human beings' baits and the remains of immortal beings are essentially deliberate or unintentional traps. The price of coveting the gift of the strongest is much more painful than being locked in a cage.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
*The Consecrated Fanged Beast is currently the rarest respawnable [[Elite Enemy]] in the overworld, with only one spawn location.
**Likewise, this spawn requires the completion of the [[World Quest]] [[The Hymn of Tir Yazad (Part 2)]] in order for it to appear.
