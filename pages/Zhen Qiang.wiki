:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::''' Zhen Qiang:''' Not much. I'm just watching this crane on orders from my boss.
::''' Zhen Qiang:''' Truth be told, there isn't all that much to do. I mean, what's this crane supposed to do, grow legs and run off?
::{{DIcon}} What does this crane do, anyway?
:::''' Zhen Qiang:''' Hey, don't touch it however you like. This contraption isn't something an outsider can use. We boatmen rely on this to help us transport cargo.
