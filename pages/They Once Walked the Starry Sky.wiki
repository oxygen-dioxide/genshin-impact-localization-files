{{Quest Description|"They will descend upon the 'Cliff of Prophecy'..."

Thus would the epics of later generations speak of this time:<br>The heroes leaped light of foot o'er floral cliffs, trials and tribulations besting forthwith. By their arm they brought forth rain and dew, the dark clouds fled, and flowers grew.

Comment in the margins: You forgot to mention how popular the forest tavern was.<br>Comment below the comment: Wait, did all of you think the wine was good? I thought it tasted kinda weird.<br>Comment below the comment below the comment: That might be because someone put... into your cup... (the following words are scratched out)}}

:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 almond 01.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Get up, Cedule! Time to get to work, you lazybones!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 cedule 01.ogg}} '''Cedule:''' Uh... Can't... can't remember how to call the train. Just lemme sleep a little longer, then I'm sure I'll remember...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 almond 02.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Don't try to pull one over on me, young man! Your Fading Disorder has been cured! I saw you chugging cup after cup of Magic Tonic in the Tavern last night.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 cedule 02.ogg}} '''Cedule:''' Uh... You must be mistaken, Grandpa Almond. That guy definitely wasn't me...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 almond 03a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo yqeq302 2 almond 03b.ogg}}--> '''Almond:''' Oh, you remember my name now, do you? Then it seems like you're all better &mdash; you had no idea who I was when you were fading. Now, enough of your nonsense, get up! The Fairy and her friends are going to be here any second!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 cedule 03.ogg}} '''Cedule:''' Alright, I'm up, I'm up... The Maritime Express should be here soon.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 almond 04.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Hmph, that's more like it. Lie there any longer and you'll start gathering dust!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is everything okay?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 almond 05a.ogg}} {{A|vo yqeq302 2 almond 05b.ogg}} '''Almond:''' The Hero, {{MC|m=his|f=her}} pixie companion, and the Forest Fairy! I didn't know you were already here. Oh, merciful macadamias... I'm sorry you had to see that.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's alright! Paimon knows the feeling! Who doesn't want to sleep in first thing in the morning?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Does the Maritime Express run out of Constellation Metropole?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 almond 06.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Yes. Each train needs a conductor to operate, and the conductors are always from the capital. The more difficult maneuvers are a little too complicated when you're made of paper.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... so you mean, the people of Constellation Metropole aren't origami animals like you?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 almond 07.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Well, the city welcomes visitors from all over the world, so you're bound to run into some Forest-dwellers there. But yes, generally speaking, the residents of Constellation Metropole look quite different from us.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 almond 08.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Ah, you'll see for yourself soon enough... Here comes the train.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 wheel 01.ogg}} '''Wheel:''' Pleasure to meet you, everyone. My name is Wheel, and I'll be the conductor for your journey today. I'm assuming you're the ones who called the train?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa... it's a little toy man!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 almond 09.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Yes, we called the train. The Hero and the Forest Fairy need a ride to Constellation Metropole.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 wheel 02.ogg}} '''Wheel:''' The... The Hero and the Forest Fairy!? The ones from the prophecy?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 wheel 03.ogg}} '''Wheel:''' Wh&mdash;Why didn't you say so earlier? We could've prepared a far more luxurious train... I&mdash;I'll just go back and get a better one!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' That's okay, Mr. Wheel. We're trying to get to the city as fast as possible. We just need you to get us across the sea. In your capable hands, I'm sure we'll get there in no time!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 wheel 04.ogg}} '''Wheel:''' O&mdash;Of course, my lady. It would be an honor!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 wheel 05.ogg}} '''Wheel:''' Well then, all aboard! Sit anywhere you like. We'll get a stunning view of Simulanka no matter where you're seated!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 kirara 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Hehehe... Breakfast...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm? Did one of you just say something?
:{{DIcon}} Not me...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Wasn't me, either.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 kirara 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Breakfast... No, come back...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Hmm... Sounds like the voice is coming from inside the train.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Hehe... Fish... Chicken drumsticks... Got ya...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What the... What's Kirara doing here!?
:<gallery widths="350">

</gallery>
:{{DIcon}} Eating her own tail, apparently...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 kirara 04.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Nom nom meow...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 nilou 05.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Is {{sic|she friend}} of yours?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, let Paimon introduce you... This is Kirara, she's&mdash; Wait, actually, maybe we should wake her up first.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 kirara 05.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Meow... So noisy... Mrrow!? Is it morning already...?
:{{DIcon}} Good meowning.
:{{Introductory Note|Kirara}}
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 kirara 06.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Hm, morning... Huh? Huuuuuuh!? {{Traveler}}! Paimon! It's... It's you!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 kirara 07.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Which means... Oh, thank goodness! It was all a dream after all! Ehehehe, gotta hand it to my imagination, it all felt super real! There were these toy people, but they were alive, and they could talk...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 wheel 06.ogg}} '''Wheel:''' Ahem... Madame, sleeping overnight in the train car is prohibited...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 kirara 08.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Mrrow!? It... It wasn't just a dream?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's alright, Kirara... Apparently, we're in a world called "Simulanka." We got here yesterday, too.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 kirara 09.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Simulanka? So, that's what it's called. I spent all day yesterday wandering around this one city... The toy people called it Constellation Metropole. I was trying to find a way to get back home.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 kirara 10.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' I was seriously starting to think I'd gotten on the bad side of some great [[youkai]], and gotten swallowed whole...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 nilou 06.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Ah... I take it you're [[Inazuma]]n, then, Miss Kirara?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She sure is! But, uh... Kirara, here, is kinda special. Let Paimon introduce you for real this time. Kirara is a nekomata from Inazuma. She works as a courier for [[Komaniya Express]].
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 nilou 07.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Ah, nice to meet you! I'm Nilou, a member of [[Zubayr Theater]]. You can usually find us performing in [[Sumeru City]]'s [[Grand Bazaar]]. Right now, though... I suppose I should introduce myself as the Fairy of the Forest of Blessings!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 kirara 11.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Oh, you're Nilou! I've heard a lot about you from my deliveries in [[Sumeru]]. I even saw one of your performances back in the day! You're an amazing dancer. But, uh, did you say you were a... Forest Fairy?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, that's her new identity here in Simulanka. Speaking of new identities, looks like you've got a new outfit yourself, Kirara...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 kirara 12.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Yeah, I know! It confused the heck out of me yesterday... I just woke up in a set of brand-new clothes I'd never seen before.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That must mean you have a big part to play here, too!
:{{DIcon}} As a cat burglar?
::{{A|vo yqeq302 2 kirara 13a 1.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' I think Miss [[Lynette]] would be better suited to that role, being a magician and all...
:{{DIcon}} As a Nekomata-in-Boots?
::{{A|vo yqeq302 2 kirara 13b 1.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Is... Is that a thing? I guess I am wearing a pair of boots, but still...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 nilou 08.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Did you by any chance hear a voice speaking to you before you got here, Miss Kirara?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 kirara 14.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' A voice... Oh, yeah, I did hear something, but I was so freaked out, my tails got all tangled. So I... didn't catch much of what was said, hehe...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 mousea 01.ogg}} '''Chestnut:''' S&mdash;S&mdash;Sorry for the interruption...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 mousea 02.ogg}} '''Chestnut:''' B&mdash;But this nekomata friend of yours... She doesn't eat hamsters, does she?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 frogb 01.ogg}} '''Firecracker:''' O&mdash;Or frogs...?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 kirara 15.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Oh, no need to worry, little guys! I would never do something like that! Well, unless I'd been out in the wild too long without anything to eat. Huh, speaking of eating, I am getting a little hungry...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 together 01.ogg}} '''Crowd:''' ...!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 almond 10.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Ahem! Where are your manners, everyone!? This young lady is a trusted friend of our esteemed Hero!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 almond 11.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Now, I know a fear of felines is etched into us with ink, but I'm certain Miss Nekomata-in-Boots here means us no harm!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 cedule 04.ogg}} '''Cedule:''' Sure looks like you're keeping your distance, though, Grandpa Almond...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 kirara 16.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' You all have nothing to fear, I promise! I met some origami animals in Constellation Metropole yesterday, and I even made sure to retract my claws so I didn't hurt them by accident.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 kirara 17.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Plus, you all look just about as tasty as the cardboard boxes I deliver, haha... Uhh, not that I'd try to eat you even if you did look tasty! Promise!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 almond 12.ogg}} '''Almond:''' ...Please excuse us, Ma'am. It's just an unconscious reaction.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 wheel 07.ogg}} '''Wheel:''' Ahem, dear passengers... It's almost time for us to depart...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh yeah, that. Whoops, this turned into a pretty long conversation, didn't it... Alright, let's get on the train! You coming with us, Kirara?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 kirara 18.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Mhm, I'll ride with you to the next stop. There's a place near the Metropole that caught my eye yesterday, so I want to go explore it today.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 almond 13.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Then all that remains for me to say is: On behalf of the Forest of Blessings, thank you, once again, for all you've done for us.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 almond 14.ogg}} '''Almond:''' May the [[Goddess of Fate]] be with you and bless your journey, Madame Fairy, Miss Nekomata-in-Boots, and our brave Heroes.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 almond 15.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Please do visit us in the Forest of Blessings again, once peace has returned to this land!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We will! We'll definitely meet again!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 2 nilou 09.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Take care, Grandpa Almond!

;(After the cutscene)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Firecracker:''' Take care, everyone!
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Almond:''' Have a safe trip!
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Cedule:''' Have a safe trip!
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Padisarah:''' Remember to come back often!

;(Connect the cars)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Wheel:''' ''Ready to set off?''

;(Interact with the train)
:{{DIcon|Gear}} Let's go!
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Wheel:''' Maritime Express, full steam ahead!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 3 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Bye!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 3 almond 01.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Have a safe trip!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, a train ride over the sea! What an incredible view!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 4 wheel 01.ogg}} '''Wheel:''' Please keep your head and arms inside the train at all times. We don't want anyone falling into the sea.

:{{DIcon|Gear}} Poke It!

;(During the train ride)
:{{A|vo yqeq302 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's a train coming the other way, too! Heeeeeey!
:'''Train Conductor:''' Hey&mdash;!
:'''Train Conductor:''' Hello there!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 5 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Now that the Fading Disorder is cured, I'm sure the Forest will be a lively place again in no time.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 5 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' I gotta go explore that Forest at some point. It looked so pretty from the train! I just hope they, uh, won't be too scared of me...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 6 wheel 01.ogg}} '''Wheel:''' We will be arriving at our destination shortly. Please prepare to disembark.

;(After reaching the destination)
:{{A|vo yqeq302 7 wheel 01.ogg}} '''Wheel:''' Here we are! Constellation Metropole is right over there. It's a short walk from here to the Gear Sky Ladder, which will take you right to Metropole Square. Thank you again for choosing the Maritime Express!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 7 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Great. And thanks to you for a smooth and pleasant journey, Mr. Wheel.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 7 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' The train cars were comfortable and spacious, and I had a great night's sleep. I'll definitely be back!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 7 wheel 02.ogg}} '''Wheel:''' Um... As you wish, Ma'am.
:;(The group begins to walk away from the station)
:{{A|vo yqeq302 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Where should we go next? Is that place you wanted to check out nearby?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 7 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Mhm, I took a walk around yesterday and it felt like there was something weird about it. So I think I'll indulge my curiosity and [[Narration Footnotes|go investigate]].
:{{A|vo yqeq302 7 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Want us to come with you?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 7 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' It's okay &mdash; you guys go ahead and visit the Metropole for now. Hopefully that's where you'll be able to find out some more about this world.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 7 kirara 04.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' I pretty much explored the whole place from the rooftops yesterday, but for some reason, this is the place that caught my attention.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 7 kirara 05.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Hehe, you know what I mean, right? Like, when you get a stone stuck in your claw, or something. It keeps nagging you to dig it out, and you can't focus on anything else until you do.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 7 kirara 06.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' But don't worry &mdash; if you run into any trouble, I'll be there faster than you can say "Gold-Level Courier of the Komaniya Express"!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, fair enough. We'll head to the Metropole then. Guess this is where we say bye for now.
:{{DIcon}} Stay safe, Kirara.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 7 kirara 07.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Mhm! Don't worry about me &mdash; let's not forget I'm a youkai!

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo yqeq302 8 toymanpanic 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Help me! Somebody, please!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 8 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Over there! Somebody needs our help!

;(Reach the marked location)
:{{A|vo yqeq302 9 toymanpanic 01.ogg}} '''Bleufond:''' Help me! Help... Oh [[Goddess of Prophecy]] above, could you kind souls please help us?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What happened here? Why are you all suspended in midair...?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 9 toymanpanic 02.ogg}} '''Bleufond:''' I mean, being stuck in midair still beats falling to the ground and being smashed into a pile of blocks... Ugh, I told him to be careful, but&mdash; No, never mind, now's not the time for that.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 9 toymanpanic 03.ogg}} '''Bleufond:''' My good friends, could I trouble you to turn the {{Color|buzzword|clockwork key}} over there? I'll explain everything in a bit.

;(Rewind the clockwork device all the way)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Bleufond:''' The composition's not quite right...
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Bleufond:''' A little further back!
:;(Bleucher jumps back)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Bleufond:''' A little further back again!
:;(Bleucher jumps back)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Bleufond:''' Alright, we're done backing up!

:::{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Bleucher:''' Agh!
:::{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Bleufond:''' Watch out!
:;(If the Oracle Pillar is connected)
:::;(Bleucher jumps back and is stopped by the barrier)
:::{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Bleufond:''' Wonderful shots! Excellent!
:::{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Bleucher:''' Thank you!

;(After completing the puzzle)
:{{A|vo yqeq302 10 toymanbold 01.ogg}} '''Bleucher:''' Ahh... Th&mdash;Thank you, thank you...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What happened there? It almost seemed like we turned back time...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 10 toymanpanic 01.ogg}} '''Bleufond:''' I take it this is your first time witnessing the power of the Goddess of Prophecy, then? If so, I can see why you might think that.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 10 toymanpanic 02.ogg}} '''Bleufond:''' Basically, this is a gift bestowed upon Constellation Metropole by the Goddess of Prophecy, who rules over the natural course of all things. It helps those who have deviated from their proper path to get back on track.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 10 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Proper path? ...Do you mean, everything that happens in the Metropole has been planned out since the very beginning?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 10 toymanpanic 03.ogg}} '''Bleufond:''' ...Why are you saying that as if it's a bad thing?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 10 toymanbold 02.ogg}} '''Bleucher:''' You're not explaining it clearly &mdash; here, allow me... Of course, all residents of the Metropole have the freedom to live their own lives. For instance, whether I use olive oil or sesame oil in my morning skincare routine is entirely my choice.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 10 toymanbold 03.ogg}} '''Bleucher:''' But whenever something disastrous is about to happen &mdash; like, when I almost got turned into a pile of rubble just now &mdash; the Goddess's magic will activate in the world around us.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So in other words, it's a kind of... protection magic? To keep people alive?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 10 toymanpanic 04.ogg}} '''Bleufond:''' You could say that... There are other situations in which it activates, too, but that's basically correct.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 10 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Well, in any case, we're glad no one's hurt.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 10 toymanbold 04.ogg}} '''Bleucher:''' Are you heading to Constellation Metropole?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yup! Do you know where we can find the Gear Sky Ladder?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 10 toymanbold 05.ogg}} '''Bleucher:''' Oh, it's just that platform up ahead &mdash; the one with the key sticking out.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? That thing? Umm... Are you sure?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 10 toymanpanic 05.ogg}} '''Bleufond:''' Yep, that's the one! Pretty much everything in the Metropole runs on tracks and gears. The Goddess of Prophecy watches over it all.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 10 toymanpanic 06.ogg}} '''Bleufond:''' Which is to say, all the tracks are fixed. If a machine is set up to move forwards, it will never move in reverse.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 10 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This reminds Paimon a lot of [[Fontaine]]'s clockwork toys.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 10 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' You mean, like those music boxes with dancing figures? I think I've seen one or two from the merchants in Sumeru.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 10 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, exactly like that. Anyway, sounds like it's not gonna suddenly fall out of the sky, so Paimon's okay now. Should we get going?

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, what a bustling city! This place is fit for a king!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Our next step is to get to the top of the Metropole, and ask the Goddess of Prophecy for guidance. If there is a king in that castle, I sure hope he won't get mad at us for trespassing...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 toyguard 01.ogg}} '''Toy Guard:''' Make way for the King!

:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 toyguard 04.ogg}} '''Toy Guard:''' Hold your foul tongue! How dare you utter Her Majesty's name?
:{{DIcon}} ...Mercy, Your Majesty!
:{{DIcon}} Please forgive our transgression!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 03.ogg}} '''{{tt|Navia|King of Constellation Metropole}}:''' Hahaha, nice one, partner! Spectacular improvisation skills &mdash; I'd expect no less from you!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 04a.ogg}} {{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 04b.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Alright, alright, you can relax now. Allow me to make some introductions. This is {{Traveler}}, and {{MC|m=his|f=her}} trusty companion, Paimon.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 toyguard 05.ogg}} '''Toy Guard:''' You are personal friends with Her Majesty the King? Please, forgive our grievous mistake! We had no idea.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Ahem...! Alright, the welcome ceremony is over. Everyone, back to your stations. I will personally treat our guests to some royal hospitality.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 toyguard 06.ogg}} '''Toy Guard:''' Yes, Your Majesty!
:{{DIcon}} Your Majesty, we are most grateful for your&mdash;
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Come on, I've already sent them off. So anyway, how did you guys get here?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We were gonna ask you the same thing... Also, how are you already king of this nation? And where did you get a crown? ...Oh, wait, don't say it &mdash; you just woke up like this, right?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Sounds like you've answered your own question. But before I woke up, I heard a voice say to me: "You are the king of Constellation Metropole. Now go forth and save your city."
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' A similar thing happened to me.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Oh yeah, sorry &mdash; you must be the Fairy of the Forest of Blessings, right?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mhm! This is Nilou, a friend we made during our time in Sumeru.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Nice to meet you, Miss Nilou! I'm Navia, the President of [[Spina di Rosula]]. If you ever get the chance to go to Fontaine, make sure you come and visit me! I'm based in [[Poisson]].
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seems like you're taking this all in stride... Aren't you nervous about getting stuck here and never being able to get back home?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Why would I be worried about that? We've faced much bigger problems than this before, and we always pull through. This should be a piece of cake!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Besides, life's always full of surprises. You gotta learn to just enjoy it!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' That sounds like a great outlook on life. You have a very optimistic spirit.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Thanks! I'll take that. Honestly though, it also puts me at ease to find out that you guys are the "Fairy" and "Heroes" that I've been hearing about in this prophecy. Heh, we're kinda veterans at dealing with prophecies by now, aren't we?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' About that, has anything bad happened in the Metropole? We heard about an evil dragon, did it make a mess here too?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' It sure did. Apparently, for whatever reason, he went for the stars above the city recently. Literally just flew up and starting snatching them out of the sky!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 14.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Luckily, the guards responded quickly, and stopped the dragon from taking them back to his lair. Unfortunately, though, he dropped them before he flew off. Now they're scattered all around the Metropole.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 15.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I've been out trying to retrieve them, but I only managed to get one of them before you showed up... Oh, I didn't ask yet &mdash; what brings you to the Metropole, anyway?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon can explain...
:;(Paimon explains to Navia)
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 16.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Huh, I see... So you want to consult the oracle of the Goddess of Prophecy.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Do you know how we can do that, Miss Navia?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 17.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, the Goddess's statue is indeed at the top of the castle. I can take you up there.
:;(The group begins to walk towards the castle)
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 18.ogg}} '''Navia:''' However, I've heard from the citizens here that the Goddess hasn't given out any new revelations in a very long time.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? But Grandpa Almond told us that he received his prophecy from the Goddess...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 19.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Oh, that's probably because the prophecy about the "Hero of Simulanka" has been around for a very long time.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 20.ogg}} '''Navia:''' But recently, people realized that the Goddess didn't reveal anything about what's supposed to happen after peace has been restored.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 nilou 05.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Huh, okay...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 21.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Still, can't hurt to try your luck. And maybe you can help me get rid of the invaders while we're at it.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Invaders? So the dragon's not your only problem?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 22.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Right. The Forest isn't the only place where strange things have been happening to the residents. Have you come across the "gift from the Goddess of Prophecy" yet?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 nilou 06.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' You mean, the protection magic that stops them from coming to harm? We saw it in action.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 23.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Yep, that's the one. Over the past little while, this magic has been triggering far more frequently. We don't know if it's simply because the Metropole has grown a lot more dangerous, or if there's a deeper reason behind it.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 24.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Some residents find themselves getting stuck in place and unable to move, others start repeating the same thing over and over again, like they're trapped in some kind of loop.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 nilou 07.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' If we were to use clockwork toys as an analogy, could it be that the tracks have eroded, or the gears have slid out of place?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 25.ogg}} '''Navia:''' That's exactly right, Nilou. That's basically what's happening.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 26.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Anyway, some of the monsters outside the city saw this as an opportunity to launch an invasion.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? But we didn't see a single monster on our way here.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 27.ogg}} '''Navia:''' That's because I already took care of most of them over the past couple of days. Of the remaining few, we trapped some of them inside the castle and chased the rest back out of the city.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, so to summarize... Not only has the magic here gotten all messed up, but the dragon's also knocked some of the stars out of the sky, plus there's a bunch of monsters in the city...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Sounds like there's a lot more to fix here than in the Forest of Blessings.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 nilou 08.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Well, defeating the dragon and the monsters should be straightforward enough... But how do we fix the magic?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 28.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Supposedly, the Goddess has had it all planned out for ages. One of her oldest prophecies says this:
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 29.ogg}} '''Navia:''' "...Go, and push the gear that connects up to the starry sky. When that time comes, I shall dance, and return the tracks beneath my people's feet back to the stars in the sky."
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? But weren't the "tracks" the gift that she gave to her people in the first place? Does that mean she plans to take the gift back?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 30.ogg}} '''Navia:''' That's what the prophecy seems to be saying, yes. So as a result, some people are against turning the gear, despite what the prophecy says, since they fear a future where they no longer enjoy the Goddess's protection.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 nilou 09.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' But letting this drag on isn't the answer either, is it...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 31.ogg}} '''Navia:''' No. And I think they know that, but they're just too afraid to take that final, terrifying step... They're still hoping there might be an alternative solution.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 32.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Now, we could ignore their objections and go turn the gear ourselves, but...
:{{DIcon}} You want to be considerate of their feelings...
:{{DIcon}} You want to let them make that choice for themselves.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 33.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Exactly! You know me well, and that's why you're my partner!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 34.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I want to get as many people on my side as possible. At the end of the day, this is their city, and they should have the right to decide its future.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh! Spoken like a true, wise king, Navia!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 35.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I am the Boss of Spina di Rosula, after all. This may be my first time as a king, but there are a few similarities between the two roles.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 36.ogg}} '''Navia:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, Miss Nilou... Would you be willing to lend me your support?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 37.ogg}} '''Navia:''' With your help, I'm confident we'll be able to find the most frictionless way to resolve the problems plaguing this city.
:{{DIcon}} Sure thing, Boss.
::{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 38a 1.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Thanks, partner!
:{{DIcon}} It would be my honor, Your Majesty.
::{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 38b 1.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hahaha! Not gonna lie, "Your Majesty" is definitely growing on me...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seriously, like we'd ever say no! We're your friends. No need to ask us so formally in the future.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 nilou 10.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' I'm happy to help, too. This is a beautiful city, and just like the Forest of Blessings, I would love to see it return to normal as soon as possible.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 39.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Ah, great! As the King of Constellation Metropole, I extend to you my gratitude.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 11 navia 40.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Alright, everyone follow me &mdash; I'll show you the way to the Goddess Statue {{Color|buzzword|at the top of the Metropole}}. And stay close! You don't wanna get lost in my castle, it's huge!

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo yqeq302 12 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What's this?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 12 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Wait, this looks like the {{Color|buzzword|star}} I found earlier. I told the guards to place it near the Goddess Statue... Maybe they ran into some trouble up there.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 12 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Guess we'd better hurry.

:::{{A|vo yqeq302 16 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Well, at least we know what we're looking for now. We just need to keep going. That said... the Metropole is huge, where do we even start?
:::{{A|vo yqeq302 16 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Oh, that's the easy part. I already compiled a list of the lost stars' locations based on eyewitness reports from across the city. Here you go, they should all be marked.
:::{{A|vo yqeq302 16 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Would you mind going around and fetching them for me? I have a few other things to take care of.

;(Continuing from section above)
:{{A|vo yqeq302 16 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' In the sky...? How do we get up there?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 16 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hehe, I got us covered! We will, of course, be taking... the [[Aerial Express]]!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 16 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is that a flying train!?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 16 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hey, you already took a train that runs on water. Is a flying train really that much weirder?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 16 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Well, at least the Maritime Express still runs on a track!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 16 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Oh, c'mon, don't worry about it! This train has been blessed by the Goddess of Prophecy. Its whole purpose is to protect the Metropole's skies.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 16 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' It took me a lot of effort to find it, you know... I don't think anyone's used it in, like... a hundred years?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 16 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A hundred years!? Are you sure it's safe? Let's not forget that the Goddess of Prophecy's magic has been going haywire recently...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 16 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well... It's not like we have any other options. Unless you wanna do the honors, Paimon? Fancy flying up there on your own?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 16 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nooo thank you! It's way too high up... Wait, Nilou, you've got a feel for how magic works here. Can you do your thing and sense if this train is the real deal?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 16 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' I can try... Hmm... Yes, I can sense traces of magic, but it's different from the kind I felt in the Forest. So... I don't know.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 16 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, fine... Guess there's only one way to find out.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 16 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' That's the spirit! I'll come with you. Miss Nilou, will you be joining us?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 16 nilou 05.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' I think I'll stay behind. That way, if something does go wrong, you'll have someone on the ground to get you some help.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 16 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That makes sense! If the train does break down, you can make us a giant origami crane to come bail us out! ...Or if a crane's too difficult, a Finch could work!

;(Talk to Nilou, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq302 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Best of luck! Hmm... a finch, huh? I think I know how to fold one of those...

;(Ride the Aerial Express)
:{{A|vo yqeq302 18 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Choo-choo! Aerial Express, moving out!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 18 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! It really is flying!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 18 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' What an amazing feeling! I've never been on a flying train before!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 18 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Neither have we!

;(After placing the first star)<!--{{DIcon|Hand}} Place--><!--Use Scattered Star &times;1 and hang it up?-->

:{{A|vo yqeq302 20 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're so high up... Don't look down, don't look down...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 20 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Haha, hang in there Paimon! The hard part's nearly over. After that, it's downhill all the way!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 20 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't say "downhill all the way"! That is the LAST thing Paimon wants to hear!

;(After placing all the stars)
:{{A|vo yqeq302 21 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew, we're finally done! Okay, let's get back down while this train is still working...

:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Yeah! And it was an absolute blast, too. You gotta ride with us next time, Miss Nilou!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Huh? Ah, I'm okay, thanks...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toyguardcaptain 01.ogg}} '''Montagne:''' Halt! What do you think you're doing!?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanredical 01.ogg}} '''Olivier:''' Get out of my way!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' What's going on?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toyguardcaptain 02.ogg}} '''Montagne:''' Your Majesty, they're...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanredical 02.ogg}} '''Olivier:''' Let us through!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toyguardcaptain 03.ogg}} '''Montagne:''' Stay back!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' It's okay. Let them through.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanredical 03.ogg}} '''Olivier:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanredical 04.ogg}} '''Olivier:''' Y&mdash;Your Majesty... Could we please ask you.... not to turn the gear that connects up to the sky?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And why is that?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanredical 05.ogg}} '''Olivier:''' ...As you have seen, the Goddess's gift is very important to us. It keeps us from harm, and protects our very lives.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanconservative 01.ogg}} '''{{tt|Bizerte|Sensible Conservative Citizen}}:''' Some of us... we just aren't ready to lose that protection.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...I see. I understand.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanconservative 02.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' Huh? Y&mdash;Your Majesty... Do you mean...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I won't turn that gear... Not until you're ready.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanredical 06.ogg}} '''Olivier:''' ...What?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I've said before that the Metropole belongs to the people, and they should have the right to decide its future.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanconservative 03.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' But let me ask you this: How do you plan to solve the issues we are currently facing?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanredical 07.ogg}} '''Olivier:''' Well, we'll start by rescuing the people that have gotten stuck! And then... we'll find a way to figure out the true cause of this crisis!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And have you made any headway on that? The true cause, I mean?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanconservative 04.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' ...Unfortunately not.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanredical 08.ogg}} '''Olivier:''' Hey! You little...!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanconservative 05.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' I'm sorry, my friend, but it's the truth...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' You have friends and family that have been affected, don't you? That have gotten stuck?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanredical 09.ogg}} '''Olivier:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...I understand your concerns. But if we let this drag on for much longer, the situation may well get worse. More and more people will be frozen by the Goddess's magic.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanredical 10.ogg}} '''Olivier:''' Yes, but... if we turn that gear now, all the tracks in this city will disappear!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I know this is a hard decision to make. But have you ever thought about why the Goddess might have made things this way in the first place?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanconservative 06.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' Uh...?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Why do you think she might decide to take back her gift, and stop revealing further prophecies about the future?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanredical 11.ogg}} '''Olivier:''' Are you saying... She has abandoned us?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 14.ogg}} '''Navia:''' No. Quite the opposite, in fact.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanredical 12.ogg}} '''Olivier:''' ...What do you mean?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 15.ogg}} '''Navia:''' The Goddess dearly loves this world and all the people of Simulanka. And because she loves you so much... she wants you to be able to choose your own path.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanconservative 07.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 16.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Every parent hopes their child will have a happy and carefree life. But if they're overprotective, then all they'll manage to do is keep their child trapped.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 17.ogg}} '''Navia:''' If a mother bird lets her baby ride on her wings for too long, her child will never learn how to fly. Perhaps the Goddess of Prophecy has always known that one day... she'll have to let go.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 18.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Children can only become independent if they're allowed to form their own opinions, make their own decisions, and deal with the consequences on their own. Only then will they be able to continue their journey alone, even after their parents are gone.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanconservative 08.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' ...But, we've relied on the Goddess's protection for so long... We don't know what it's like to go it alone. We don't know if we have what it takes.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 19.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Are you kidding me? I think you've proven yourselves more than capable of that.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanconservative 09.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' What do you mean...?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 20.ogg}} '''Navia:''' You made a call in a time of crisis, and you've come all this way to talk to me. Even the guards couldn't stop you. That must have taken a lot of courage!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanconservative 10.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' But... We only did it because we were scared...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 21.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Why you set out on the journey doesn't matter. What matters is that you've proven you can choose your own path.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanconservative 11.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanconservative 12.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' ...My friend, I fear our King is right. It is time for us to face our fears.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanredical 13.ogg}} '''Olivier:''' What!? But... But we...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanconservative 13.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' We can't go on living like this, living in fear! Look at what it's driven you to do... You threw away a star personally created by the Goddess of Prophecy herself!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanredical 14.ogg}} '''Olivier:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanconservative 14.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' You once revered her more than any of us. And I think the King is right &mdash; she hasn't abandoned us. So... why don't we put our trust in her one more time?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanredical 15.ogg}} '''Olivier:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanredical 16.ogg}} '''Olivier:''' ...I don't care anymore! Do what you want!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah... He left...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanconservative 15.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' I'm sorry about my friend... That's just how he is. Always had a terrible temper. Please accept my apology for his impudent behavior.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Is it just me, or... has he accepted the Goddess's prophecy?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanconservative 16.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' I think so. Not that you'll ever hear him admit it out loud.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanconservative 17.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' Your Majesty... Please, turn the gear that connects up to the sky.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 22.ogg}} '''Navia:''' So you've made up your mind? About giving up the Goddess's gift?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 toymanconservative 18.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' Yes, I've made up my mind. But maybe losing the gift isn't what this is about anymore. Because we've gained something, too... you have given us courage.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 23.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hehe, well said. I am proud of your decision!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 22 navia 24.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Now, gather around, everyone, and join me as we make the night sky of this wonderful city turn once more!

:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' So the stars hanging in the sky... they're music notes!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This entire Metropole is a huge music box... That's incredible!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 toymanconservative 01.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' How do you feel?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 toymanconservative 02.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' ...A little scared and uncertain, but for some reason, I feel a lot more at ease. It's as if... some kind of huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Figured out any next steps?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 toymanconservative 03.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' To be honest, not really... But maybe I can start by having a heart to heart with that stubborn friend of mine.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I have an idea! If you don't know what to do, why don't you start by helping the people around you?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 toymanconservative 04.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' ...You mean, the people who got stuck because of the Goddess's magic?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I mean anyone and everyone who needs your help! By helping others, you'll eventually find your own path. Trust me, I have experience in this!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 toymanconservative 05.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' ...What kind of experience, Your Majesty?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hmm... Ah yes, we'll need a formal organization with a catchy name before we go out and start helping people... Why don't we call it the Spina di Rosula?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 toymanconservative 06.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' Spina... di Rosula?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Ooh, or even: the Spina di Rosula di Simulanka! Yeah, that's catchy!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, big expansion for the Spina... moving into other worlds now!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 toymanconservative 07.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' Spina di Rosula... Haha, I like it! It's a great name. Let's do as Your Majesty suggests!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well then, how about I appoint you as the head of the Spina in Simulanka? While I'm off fighting the dragon with the other heroes, it'll be your responsibility to work with the guards and take good care of the people in the Metropole.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 toyguardcaptain 01.ogg}} '''Montagne:''' What? You're planning on fighting the dragon!? But... No, Your Majesty, you must reconsider!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 toymanconservative 08.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' He's right! Your Majesty, you can't!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How are you two on the same side all of a sudden...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 toymanconservative 09.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' Perhaps Your Majesty is unaware of this... The great dragon suddenly broke out from the toytanium mines one day, and tore {{Color|buzzword|the end of the world}} to pieces.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 toymanconservative 10.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' After that, it spat out a strange fog that surrounded a whole island. No one knows what lies beyond the fog, and no one knows what has become of that poor island...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 toyguardcaptain 02.ogg}} '''Montagne:''' Before Your Majesty arrived, we dispatched many soldiers to fight the dragon, but... none came back alive.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yikes, sounds worse than we thought...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Isn't that all the more reason for us to go? There could still be guards trapped there, waiting for someone to rescue them!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' King Navia is right. We cannot simply stand by and watch as the people of this world suffer.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 toyguardcaptain 03.ogg}} '''Montagne:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 toyguardcaptain 04.ogg}} '''Montagne:''' Very well. Though I have not served by your side for very long, Your Majesty, two days is enough for me to have learned that once your mind is set, any attempts to change it are futile.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Haha! You're a pretty good judge of character.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... He probably didn't mean that as a compliment...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 toyguardcaptain 05.ogg}} '''Montagne:''' Since you're serious about this, I won't try and stop you... There's only one way to reach the end of the world, and that's by taking the Maritime Express.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Oh, right! So there's a line going there too?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 toyguardcaptain 06.ogg}} '''Montagne:''' Yes. It was originally built to serve the workers commuting to the toytanium mines, but it has been abandoned since the dragon attack.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 toyguardcaptain 07.ogg}} '''Montagne:''' I'll tell the conductor to wait for you at the platform {{Color|buzzword|by the side gate of the Metropole}}, first thing tomorrow morning. You are embarking on an extremely dangerous adventure... Please be careful, Your Majesty and friends.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Thank you for your concern. While I'm gone, I leave the Metropole in your capable hands.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 together 01.ogg}} '''Both:''' Yes, Your Majesty!
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hehe, just call me "Boss" from now on. That's what everyone in the Spina calls me, and it's what I'm used to.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So the plan for tomorrow is... journey across the ocean, make it to the end of the world, and defeat a dragon.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew... That's an adventure and a half. Do all storybook heroes have to work this hard?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' At least we'll get to see some amazing scenery along the way, right? Besides, we'll have each other. It'll be a shared experience that we'll never forget.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Plus, we're pretty well-equipped for a classic heroes-versus-dragon story. We got Miss Nilou as our magic caster, and I... I guess I'm the melee warrior who leads the charge?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon can definitely see that...
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, those are tomorrow's problems! Right now, all Paimon wants is to eat a proper meal. Because worst case scenario, if Paimon ends up getting eaten by a dragon, she wants to do it on a full stomach. And something about "the end of the world" doesn't sound like a great place for food options.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 nilou 05.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Hmm... Well, the origami animals in the Forest only drink Magic Tonic... What do the toy people here in Constellation Metropole eat?
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Vegetable oil and sawdust, I think.
:{{A|vo yqeq302 23 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Noooooo!!

:{{A|vo dialog yqeq302 toymanconservative 01.ogg}} '''{{tt|Bizerte|President of the Spina di Rosula's Simulanka Branch}}:''' Captain, do you need help with anything?
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq302 toyguardcaptain 01.ogg}} '''Montagne:''' Why do you ask?
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq302 toymanconservative 02.ogg}} '''Bizerte:''' Because Her Majesty the King, the revered "Boss" herself, has personally advised me to help the people around me.
