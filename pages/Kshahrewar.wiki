'''Kshahrewar''' is one of the [[Sumeru Akademiya#The Six Darshans|Six Darshans]], the six main schools of [[Sumeru Akademiya]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Muddy Bizarre Adventure (Part 2)}}</ref> Its specialty is currently unspecified.

==Trivia==
*During ''[[A Muddy Bizarre Adventure]]'', Hosseini's remarks suggest that the Kshahrewar normally holds ownership of [[Pursina's Spike]]s.
*It is unclear whether Firnas, whom Hosseini mentions in the same sentence where he mentions the Kshahrewar, is part of this school.

===Etymology===
*Like the other Six Darshans, the name "Kshahrewar" is derived from a {{w|Zoroastianism|Zoroastrian}} deity. {{w|Kshatra Vairya}} (''Šahrewar'' in Middle Persian) is the god of metals and minerals.
*Among the localizations of the Six Darshans, Kshahrewar's is unique:
**The Korean and Portuguese localizations used the definition of {{lang|mini=1|zh={{wt|妙||Chinese}}}} as "mysterious" and translated the school's specialty along the line of "mysticism." It is also the only school in the Portuguese localization to have its specialty translated, instead of using the Zoroastrian-based name. 
**The Spanish localization extrapolated from the definition of {{lang|mini=1|zh=妙}} as "clever, ingenious" and translated the school's name as the {{lang|School of Technology|es=Escuela de Tecnología}}.
