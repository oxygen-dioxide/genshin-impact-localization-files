==Dialogue==
===Dogma of the Brass Mask: Part I===
"At first, a life of slavery is pure suffering. You will feel humiliation and exhaustion. Your dignity will flow from your limbs, from your heart like fresh blood. You will grow cold and you will ache..."<br />
"You will wish to complain, to resist, but your bloodied hands and feet and the barbed whips that strike exhaust you and silence you — yet you crave life and fear death..."<br />
"And so you become cowardly and subservient. You still desire freedom, of course, but that freedom leads you to the slave market exhibition, to the gleaming bidding boards and an endless clamor that you've never seen before..."<br />
"And your wicked master shall order you to expose your body, display your talents. And you will do your best, even amidst an ocean of shame, for you no longer wish to live like an animal in a cage, swarming and snatching for every last scrap of food..."

===Dogma of the Brass Mask: Part II ===
"You see the glamorous dancing girls and their gyrations, the valiant strongmen lifting large rocks, the poets and scholars with their songs and rhetoric..."<br />
"And so you give it your all, until the crowds' ratings become your standard — until that which is displayed on the bidding boards becomes your values. Until jealous slaves and merchants whisper behind your back."<br />
"Till the nobles' eyes follow the movement of your hips, till the emirs praise your surpassing martial skills, till the poets fall before your agile voice and your brilliant words... And even in the ignominy of being displayed, you shall glean the comfort of pride..."<br />
"'Ah, they need me...' So you think, 'I bring them brevery and strength, joy and beauty, How very empty their lives shall be without me!' You will have a taste of nobility amidsty your slavery..."<br />
"And so you view their gaze as your honor. You measure your value by the glimmering bidding board. Amidst the faceless flatterers, you allow the slave market to decide the best master for you..."

===Dogma of the Brass Mask: Part III===
"And finally, your wishes come true. You will leave that filth that corralled you, and you will lead a comfortable life. You shall not want for food or clothing, and the master who bought you shall also be your attendant slave..."<br />
"Thus will 'happiness' become to you an ingenious deception..."<br />
"But you cannot fool yourself! Your heart screams within you, yes, even now it screams: 'Even if you die, your master remains master still. But if your master dies, then you shall become a masterless slave!'"<br />
"And one day, you will realize that the death you have always feared is, in truth, 'your master's death.' You will find that you have fallen from degradation to true abjection..."<br />
"Perhaps now, you still love the gold chains, laced as they are with silver coin, wrapped about your ankles. Perhaps you even miss their jingle. But on that day, you will understand how you will tear yourself, you who were once born free, from your master's grasp..."<br />
"When they come with threats of death, and runi your beautiful body, leaving you with blinded eyes, rasping throats, indelible brands, and lasting scars..."<br />
"When you crush his head, strangle his wife, smother his children — when you conquer your fear of death and taste again the sweetness of vengeance..."<br />
"Only then shall you understand the value of dying for yourself."
