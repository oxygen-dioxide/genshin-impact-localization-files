{{Dialogue start}}
;(After completing [[Festive Elegance]])
:'''Fushizome:''' Good day, you two.
:'''Fushizome:''' Are you interested in the art of ikebana?
:{{DIcon}} "Ikebana"?
::'''Paimon:''' Huh, Paimon feels like we've heard about this one before...
::'''Fushizome:''' That's wonderful.
::'''Fushizome:''' I am currently organizing an event to show off the wonders of ikebana.
::'''Fushizome:''' In a few days, you, too, will be able to experience its charm.
::{{DIcon}} Oh, now I'm curious...
::'''Paimon:''' Alrighty, we'll come back in a couple of days, then!
:{{DIcon}} I might be... at some point.
::'''Fushizome:''' Well then, you can come down here in a few days to try ikebana out for yourself. Perhaps you, too, will be charmed by this art.

;(After completing [[The Floral Courtyard: Part I]])
:'''Fushizome:''' In the following days, I will continue to stay here and guide those who come for the Irodori Festival, and help them to enjoy the beauty of the "floral courtyards."
:'''Fushizome:''' Don't forget to drop by every day to get another "theme." There will be a total of four such themes for you to figure out.
:'''Fushizome:''' Of course, if you have any other questions, I will do my best to answer them for you.
:{{DIcon}} About the flowers here...
::'''Fushizome:''' The flowers I use are all provided by [[Sakuya]]'s Flowers. The flowers they grow are of impeccable quality and affordable prices.
::'''Fushizome:''' Perhaps you've met Sakuya as well. We once studied ikebana under the same master.
::'''Fushizome:''' Sakuya is also very well-studied in the floral arts, but when she heard that there would be tons of people at the Irodori Festival, she seemed to have gotten a bit of stage fright. She said that it would be difficult to quiet down and focus on her work in such an environment.
::'''Fushizome:''' In any case, I will advertise Sakuya's Flowers on her behalf.
::'''Paimon:''' We can help too if you need us!
::'''Fushizome:''' Well then, do the two of you have any other questions?
::{{DIcon}} Thank you, Ms. Fushizome.
::'''Fushizome:''' Think nothing of it. If you have time, you can come and look for me any time.
:{{DIcon}} About the [[Yashiro Commission]]'s involvement...
::'''Fushizome:''' The Yashiro Commission has always been very supportive of Inazuma's floral arts. Indeed, the person who sponsored this event is the [[Shirasagi Himegimi]].
::'''Fushizome:''' She has always been incredibly talented in these arts, even from a young age. I saw her perform ikebana once, and even had the honor of exchanging pointers with her.
::'''Fushizome:''' Although I'm older than her, I'm nowhere near her ability in terms of skill in ikebana or understanding of the floral arts.
::'''Fushizome:''' Where circumstances have permitted, she has provided funding to help publicize ikebana every year. I've even heard that she has used her own savings to do so...
::'''Fushizome:''' She once expressed her frank desire for more people to understand ikebana and to drum up more interest in it such that more might want to practice this art.
::'''Paimon:''' Huh. So Ayaka did so much for Inazuma's floral arts...
::{{DIcon}} I hope her wish comes true.
::'''Fushizome:''' Thank you both. You are indeed good-hearted people.
::'''Fushizome:''' Well then, do the two of you have any other questions?
::{{DIcon}} Thank you, Ms. Fushizome.
::'''Fushizome:''' Think nothing of it. If you have time, you can come and look for me any time.
:{{DIcon}} I have no further questions at the moment.
::'''Fushizome:''' Alright, then. You can come and look for me any time.
