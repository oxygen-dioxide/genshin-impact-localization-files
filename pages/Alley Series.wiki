==Lore==
Weapons themed around the Phantom Thief from the time of the corrupt Aristocracy.

Reading the tales of his righteous ancestors, a [[Parsifal|young noble]] decides to steal a sword from his house's treasury and abandon his home to live in the streets among the commoners. He put his skills to use by robbing the rich and giving the money to the poor under the cover of night, as the people feared to light fires at night.<ref name="Alley Flash">{{Ref/Weapon|The Alley Flash}}</ref> He also acquired a bow, but he didn't use any of his weapons to shed blood, instead relying on his mastery of the weapons to outwit those that would pursue him without harming anyone.<ref name="Alley Hunter">{{Ref/Weapon|Alley Hunter}}</ref> He would often be found drinking or singing among the slums rather than pursuing women, but one night when he was robbing a mansion he saw the [[Blue-Eyed Spear Witch]] and was struck by her beauty, giving her a jewel from a goblet he had stolen.<ref name="Wine Song">{{Ref/Weapon|Wine and Song}}</ref>
While the songs about them finish with a happy ending, the reality is not so bright, as she receives a criminal brand and he escapes across the ocean, and neither are heard from again.<ref name="Alley Hunter" />
