{{Description|An Isolated Archipelago Far East of Teyvat<br />Overcome endless thunderstorms and set foot on the islands of red maple and cherry blossoms. On winding shores and towering cliffs, and in forests and mountains full of secrets, witness the Eternity pursued by Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho.}}
'''Inazuma''' (/ˌinəˈz<sup>(j)</sup>uːmə/, /iˈnɑːzumə/) {{Lang|ja=稲妻|ja_rm=Inazuma}} is one of the seven regions in [[Teyvat]]. It is an archipelagic region that worships the [[Ei|Raiden Shogun]], the Electro [[Archon]], who is also the leader of its governing body, the [[Inazuma Shogunate]]. Inazuma is located approximately 4&nbsp;km southeast from [[Liyue Harbor]] and is a close neighbor with the [[Dark Sea]].<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/oBrEFOdSfy8 Collected Miscellany - "Raiden Shogun: Tranquil Thunder"]</ref>

In the past year relative to the current events of the game, the situation in Inazuma has made a drastic turn towards isolationism, locked down under the [[Sakoku Decree]]. "Baal" also enacted the related [[Vision Hunt Decree]], declaring that [[Vision]]s, as gifts from the [[gods]], should be in the sole hands of divinity &mdash; and is now rounding up all Visions in Inazuma to inlay them in the hands of a statue of the [[Statue of the Omnipresent God|Thousand-Armed, Hundred-Eyed God]].<ref name="AQ-1-2-6">{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref>

[[Atsuko]], an Inazuman who defected to [[Liyue]], describes the country as having a "tense" and "dangerous" environment and discourages traveling there; she also remarks that the [[Kanjou Commission]], one of the [[Tri-Commission]], conduct many assessments that citizens must pass in order to be given permission to leave Inazuma. She bypassed those assessments by making her own raft and fleeing to Liyue. However, the [[Fatui]] seem to be able to freely enter and exit due to their diplomatic immunity.<ref group="Note">[[Tartaglia/Lore#Tartaglia's Letters to Home|Tartaglia's Letters to Home]] mention sending souvenirs from Inazuma, while the letter was written during his stay in Liyue. Because Tartaglia arrived in Liyue shortly before the Traveler did, it can be assumed he traveled there from Inazuma.</ref>

Access into Inazuma is unlocked after reaching [[Adventure Rank]] 30 and completing the first part of the [[Archon Quest]] [[Chapter II]]: Act I - [[The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia]].

Archon Quest [[Chapter II]]: Omnipresence Over Mortals takes place in this region.

|[[Inazuma City]], [[Narukami Island]]
|Inazuma's most lively and prosperous area, where most of Inazuma's population lives. From [[Hanamizaka]] to the streets of the city, you can follow the trail to visit local traditional shops and sample Inazuma specialties.<br /><br />The [[Tenryou Commission]] is also located in the city, governing matters concerning public order and security, as well as the [[Shogunate]]'s military affairs.<br /><br />At the top of Inazuma City is [[Tenshukaku]], where the Raiden Shogun resides and rules over Inazuma.
|[[File:Inazuma City.png|180px]]
|-
|[[Ritou]], [[Narukami Island]]
|To properly explore the realm of the Shogun during this time of the Sakoku Decree, you must first pass the checkpoint in [[Ritou]].<br /><br />Ritou is under the jurisdiction of the [[Kanjou Commission]] and people need various documents to be granted passage. However, to get the necessary Travel Permit, you have to go through a very complicated procedure and have the right connections.<br /><br />Without the Travel Permit, you can only stop briefly in Ritou. You will see other outlanders who are also stuck there, together looking out upon the desolate landscape of the fishing village with red maples and green roof tiles.
|[[File:Ritou.png|180px]]
|-
|[[Konda Village]], [[Narukami Island]]
|A small village located outside of Inazuma City.
|[[File:Konda Village.png|180px]]
|-
|[[Chinju Forest]], [[Narukami Island]]
|A tranquil and mysterious forest located at the foot of [[Mt. Yougou]].<br /><br />Here one can find Tanuki statues everywhere, torii gates scattered throughout the forest, and abandoned shrines hidden in the depths... Like a flowing river, they tell of legends meandering into a forgotten past.<br /><br />Rumor has it that when walking in Chinju Forest, you may encounter mysterious beings who like to play pranks...
|[[File:Chinju Forest.png|180px]]
|-
|[[Mt. Yougou]], [[Narukami Island]]
|A mountain on Narukami Island, home to the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]] and [[Sacred Sakura]].
|[[File:Mt Yougou.png|180px]]
|-
|[[Grand Narukami Shrine]], [[Mt. Yougou]], [[Narukami Island]]
|The largest shrine in Inazuma, located at the peak of Mt. Yougou. It is dedicated to Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho.<br /><br />For those who have wishes, they can climb to the top of the mountain one step at a time. For those who have gained the favor of Electro, they can use the Thunder Spheres to fly up and reach the shrine surrounded by the huge Sacred Sakura Tree. The Sacred Sakura is in constant bloom, symbolizing the eternity of Narukami.<br /><br />After passing through the many torii gates, find the shrine maiden to draw a fortune slip and ask for Narukami's blessing.
|[[File:Grand Narukami Shrine.png|180px]]
|-
|[[Tatarasuna]], [[Kannazuka]]
| Legend has it that Kannazuka means "the hill where no gods reside." Until now, Kannazuka is disputed territory between the Shogunate and Sangonomiya.<br /><br />Kannazuka has a mountainous terrain with high steep cliffs. In the midst of the rocky outcrops lies Mikage Furnace, the largest smelting facility in Inazuma. This is where Jade Steel is made, a rare material that is used in Inazuma to forge swords.
|[[File:Tatarasuna.png|180px]]
|-
|[[Kujou Encampment]], [[Kannazuka]]
|The Shogunate's military camp in Kannazuka.<br /><br />There will always be an irreconcilable conflict between the people of Narukami who believe in the Raiden Shogun and the people of Sangonomiya who believe in Watatsumi Omikami. The strife between both parties has only worsened since the Vision Hunt Decree was enforced.<br /><br />To put down the Sangonomiya rebellion, the Tenryou Commission has stationed the Shogun's Army here. Compared to the Sangonomiya forces, the Shogun's Army has more troops, is better trained, and is well-equipped. Victory seems assured for the latter.
|[[File:Viewpoint Front Line, Kannazuka.png|180px]]
|-
|[[Nazuchi Beach]], [[Kannazuka]]
|Located between Yashiori Island and Kannazuka, Nazuchi Beach is a place ravaged by war. On the shallow coast, apart from Violet Ibis looking for a place to rest, there are torn flags and broken arrows of prior battles, as well as broken masts and shattered deck of shipwrecks.<br /><br />As a result of the war, pirates and ronin infest the place searching for loot. Even the rare Dendrobium blooms in this place...
|[[File:Nazuchi Beach.png|180px]]
|-
|[[Musoujin Gorge]], [[Yashiori Island]]
|This narrow and majestic rift valley runs through the eastern part of Yashiori Island.<br /><br />This extraordinary sight is no natural formation, but rather is the result of the fight in which the Electro Archon slayed the giant serpent. The rift valley is named after the Musou no Hitotachi, a testament to the Electro Archon's skilled swordsmanship.<br /><br />To this day, the remains of the giant serpent are still scattered throughout Yashiori Island. The Tatarigami that emerged from this god's remains seem to be awakening...
|[[File:Musoujin Gorge.png|180px]]
|-
|[[Serpent's Head]], [[Yashiori Island]]
|Of the giant serpent that was defeated by the Electro Archon with the Musou no Hitotachi, only its weather-bleached remains are left today.<br /><br />Although its skull still looks up at the sky defiantly, the god is already dead, and so the name of "Watatsumi Omikami" is gradually being forgotten.<br /><br />Even if the giant serpent is long dead, you can still clearly feel the traces of its power left behind. Under the influence of the Tatarigami, Yashiori Island has been deserted by its inhabitants. What can be seen on the island are just endless rain and thunderstorms trying to wash away the remnants of the past.

==Trivia==
* A competition called "This Novel Is Amazing!" is held periodically in Inazuma, by the [[Yae Publishing House]], a giant of the Inazuma publishing industry.<ref name="novel">{{Ref/Quest|This Novel Is Amazing!}}</ref>
* According to [[Xu]], a novel called "[[A Legend of Sword]]" is "all the rage in Inazuma right now" It was written by an author in [[Liyue]], although the exact person is unknown to the residents of Inazuma. The author is revealed to be [[Xingqiu]].
* Much like real-life Japan, Inazuma is currently only reachable by the sea around the islands.
* According to [[Barbara]], there are blue trees that exist by the sea shore near Inazuma City.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Barbara|Anything to share...}}</ref>
* In the trailer ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]'', under the title of the quest [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]], there is a line written in Teyvat's [[Latin-Based Language|Latin script]]. It reads "''Perpetua perennis impervia''," which translates to "Perpetual, perennial, impervious."
* [[Kazuha|Kaedehara Kazuha]] is the first playable character from Inazuma in the global release.
** [[Kamisato Ayaka]] was available in a closed beta test version of the game, but wasn't released as part of the global release of the game until Version 2.0.
* The storm barrier that was created as part of the [[Sakoku Decree]] is encountered as the climate [[A Nation Closed by Thunder]] when attempting to enter or leave Inazuma via ice bridging or [[Waverider]]. When players are too far in the storm barrier, they are teleported to [[Liyue Harbor]] if they tried to enter Inazuma or [[Ritou]] if they tried to exit Inazuma. This means that the only way to get to Inazuma for the first time is through the quest [[Setting Sail]] ([[Archon Quest]] [[Chapter II]], Act I: [[The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia]]), during which the [[Teleport Waypoint]] at the docks of Ritou will be automatically unlocked, and the only way to enter and leave Inazuma afterwards is through activated Teleport Waypoints (including [[Portable Waypoint]]s), [[Statues of The Seven]], and [[Domains]].
* [[Celestia]] cannot be seen from Inazuma, unlike how it can be seen from [[Mondstadt]] and Liyue.
* Inazuma currently has the most [[Normal Bosses]] with seven bosses; six on the main islands and one in [[Enkanomiya]].
* Inazuma's 5 star characters currently outnumber their 4 star counterparts, a stark contrast compared to Liyue and Mondstadt.
** This also makes Inazuma contain the least amount of 4 star characters in the cast.
* All of Inazuma's 5 star characters are [[:Category:Event-Exclusive Characters|Event-Exclusive Characters]].
* After completing [[Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter|Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter Act II]]: [[Transient Dreams]], it is possible to go enter Inazuma without being teleported back due to the abolishment of the Sakoku Decree.

===Etymology===
* Inazuma is inspired by Japan. The name of the region {{Lang|"Inazuma"|ja=稲妻|ja_rm=Inadzuma}} means "lightning" in Japanese.
** The modern Japanese word {{Lang|''inazuma''|ja=稲妻|ja_rm=inadzuma}} originates from an Old Japanese word spelled with the same kanji {{Lang||ojp={{wt|稲妻}}|ojp_rm=inaNduma}}, literally meaning "rice's spouse" (nowadays ''tsuma'' (> ''zuma'') means "wife," but it was gender-neutral in ancient times). In ancient Japan, there was a lot of thunder during the rice fruition period, so there was a belief that lightning would produce rice, and thus Japanese found "rice's spouse" as a nickname of thunder.
** The Japanese word has two coexisting spellings in Modern Japanese: {{Lang|mini=1|ja=いなづま|ja_rm=inadzuma}} (using {{lang|mini=1|ja=つ|ja_rm=tsu}} with {{w|Dakuten and handakuten|''dakuten''}}) and {{Lang|mini=1|ja=いなずま|ja_rm=inazuma}} (using {{lang|mini=1|ja=す|ja_rm=su}} with ''dakuten''). Since {{Lang|mini=1|ja=づ|ja_rm=dzu}} and {{Lang|mini=1|ja=ず|ja_rm=zu}} are pronounced identically in Modern Japanese,<ref group="Note">Some dialects preserve the difference between the {{w|Yotsugana|two sounds}}.</ref> many speakers today spell it with {{Lang|mini=1|ja=ず|ja_rm=zu}} despite the proper spelling being with {{Lang|mini=1|ja=づ|ja_rm=dzu}}.<ref group="Note">As per proper {{w|Rendaku|{{Rubi|連濁|れんだく}} (rendaku)}} rules in {{w|ja:現代仮名遣い|{{Lang|mini=1|ja={{Rubi|現代|げんだい|仮名|かな|遣|づか}}い|ja_rm=Gendai Kanadzukai|ja_tl=Modern kana orthography}}}}; the first syllable of {{Lang|mini=1|ja=妻|ja_rm=tsuma}} is {{Lang|mini=1|ja=つ|ja_rm=tsu}}, therefore it should exhibit sequential voicing and become {{Lang|mini=1|ja=づ|ja_rm=dzu}}.</ref> The game officially uses the {{Lang|mini=1|ja=ず|ja_rm=zu}} spelling ({{Lang|mini=1|ja=いなずま}}), meaning it should be romanized as "Inazuma" and not "Inadzuma."

===Cultural References ===
* The Sakoku Decree of Inazuma and collection of Visions parallels the real-life ''{{w|sakoku}}'' policy under the Japanese Tokugawa shogunate.
* The Inazuma Shogunate, the ruling body of the country, is a direct reference to the same government used under the Japanese shogunate.
* The Inazuman Emblem consists of traditional Japanese elements.
** At the center of the emblem lies a ''{{w|torii}}'', the sacred gate of a Shinto shrine.
** Inside the ''torii'' gate, there is an [[Electro]] symbol, based on a ''{{w|tomoe|mitsudomoe}}''. {{w|Raijin}}, God of Thunder, often carries drums with ''mitsudomoe'' symbols.
** The rounded rectangles seen at the both sides of the torii are called {{w|ja:すやり霞|''suyari-gasumi''}} and represent clouds, fog, or haze in traditional Japanese paintings and woodblock prints.
** Under the ''torii'' gate, three comma-shaped jewels are illustrated. Among these ''{{w|magatama}}'' beads, the most important one is ''Yasakani no Magatama'', one of the three {{w|Imperial Regalia of Japan}} and the symbol of benevolence.
** A ''sakura'' (cherry) blossom crowns the torii gate. In Japanese culture, it usually represents the aesthetics of {{Lang|''{{w|mono no aware}}''|ja=もののあはれ|ja_tl=the pathos of things}}, or the awareness of impermanence, ephemeral beauty, and the gentle sadness of things. But considering the in-game Inazuman ideal "eternity",<ref name="AQ-1-2-6" /> in this case the ''sakura'' blossom may symbolize the "endless cycle of death and rebirth".<ref>The Japan Times: [https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2020/02/22/lifestyle/ephemeral-bliss-castles-bloom/ Ephemeral bliss: Castles in bloom]</ref>
* The design and theme of the [[Watatsumi Island]] is the amalgamation of the {{w|Ryukyuan religion}} (indigenous belief system of southwestern islands in Japan) endorsed by the {{w|Ryukyu Kingdom}} (1429–1879; its capital was in {{w|Okinawa Island|Okinawa}}) and the sea-god {{w|Watatsumi}} mythology in mainland Japan, as the divine sea realm {{w|Ryukyuan religion#Nirai Kanai|Nirai Kanai}} in Ryukyu and the sea dragon palace {{w|Ryūgū-jō|Ryuuguu-jou}} in the mainland are often identified with each other.
* Names used in the [[Tsurumi Island]] are based on the {{w|Ainu language}}, spoken by the {{w|Ainu people}}, an indigenous people in now the northern part of Japan (such as {{w|Hokkaido}} Island) and now the southeasternmost part of Russia (such as {{w|Sakhalin}} Island).
