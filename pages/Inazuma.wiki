{{Description|An Isolated Archipelago Far East of Teyvat<br />Overcome endless thunderstorms and set foot on the islands of red maple and cherry blossoms. On winding shores and towering cliffs, and in forests and mountains full of secrets, witness the Eternity pursued by Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho.|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Genshin Impact Official Website]}}
'''Inazuma''' {{Lang|ja=稲妻|ja_rm=Inazuma}} is one of the seven regions in [[Teyvat]]. It is an archipelagic region that worships [[Ei|Raiden Shogun]], the [[Electro]] [[Archon]], who is also the leader of its governing body, the [[Inazuma Shogunate]]. Inazuma is located approximately 4&nbsp;km southeast from [[Liyue Harbor]] and is a close neighbor with the [[Dark Sea]].<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/oBrEFOdSfy8 Collected Miscellany - "Raiden Shogun: Tranquil Thunder"]</ref>

In the past year relative to the current events of the game, the situation in Inazuma has made a drastic turn towards isolationism, locked down under the [[Sakoku Decree]]. "Baal" also enacted the related [[Vision Hunt Decree]], declaring that [[Vision]]s, as gifts from the [[gods]], should be in the sole hands of divinity &mdash; and is now rounding up all Visions in Inazuma to inlay them in the hands of a statue of the [[Statue of the Omnipresent God|Thousand-Armed, Hundred-Eyed God]].<ref name="AQ-1-2-6">{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref>

[[Atsuko]], an Inazuman who defected to [[Liyue]], describes the country as having a "tense" and "dangerous" environment and discourages traveling there; she also remarks that the [[Kanjou Commission]], one of the [[Tri-Commission]], conduct many assessments that citizens must pass in order to be given permission to leave Inazuma. She bypassed those assessments by making her own raft and fleeing to Liyue. However, the [[Fatui]] seem to be able to freely enter and exit due to their diplomatic immunity.<ref group="Note">[[Tartaglia/Lore#Tartaglia's Letters to Home|Tartaglia's Letters to Home]] mention sending souvenirs from Inazuma, while the letter was written during his stay in Liyue. Because Tartaglia arrived in Liyue shortly before the Traveler did, it can be assumed he traveled there from Inazuma.</ref>

Access into Inazuma is unlocked after reaching [[Adventure Rank]] 30 and completing the first part of the [[Archon Quest]] [[Chapter II]]: Act I - [[The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia]].

Archon Quest [[Chapter II]]: Omnipresence Over Mortals takes place in this region.

==Trivia==
* A competition called "This Novel Is Amazing!" is held periodically in Inazuma, by the [[Yae Publishing House]], a giant of the Inazuma publishing industry.<ref name="novel">{{Ref/Quest|This Novel Is Amazing!}}</ref>
* According to [[Xu]], a novel called "[[A Legend of Sword]]" is "all the rage in Inazuma right now" It was written by an author in [[Liyue]], although the exact person is unknown to the residents of Inazuma. The author is revealed to be [[Xingqiu]].
* Much like real-life Japan, Inazuma is currently only reachable by the sea around the islands.
* According to [[Barbara]], there are blue trees that exist by the sea shore near Inazuma City.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Barbara|Anything to share...}}</ref>
* In the trailer ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]'', under the title of the quest [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]], there is a line written in Teyvat's [[Latin-Based Language|Latin script]]. It reads "''Perpetua perennis impervia''," which translates to "Perpetual, perennial, impervious."
* [[Kazuha|Kaedehara Kazuha]] is the first playable character from Inazuma in the global release.
** [[Kamisato Ayaka]] was available in a closed beta test version of the game, but wasn't released as part of the global release of the game until Version 2.0.
* The storm barrier that was created as part of the [[Sakoku Decree]] is encountered as the climate [[A Nation Closed by Thunder]] when attempting to enter or leave Inazuma via ice bridging or [[Waverider]]. When players are too far in the storm barrier, they are teleported to [[Liyue Harbor]] if they tried to enter Inazuma or [[Ritou]] if they tried to exit Inazuma. This means that the only way to get to Inazuma for the first time is through the quest [[Setting Sail]] ([[Archon Quest]] [[Chapter II]], Act I: [[The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia]]), during which the [[Teleport Waypoint]] at the docks of Ritou will be automatically unlocked, and the only way to enter and leave Inazuma afterwards is through activated Teleport Waypoints (including [[Portable Waypoint]]s), [[Statues of The Seven]], and [[Domains]].
* Inazuma currently has the most [[Normal Bosses]] with seven bosses; six on the main islands and one in [[Enkanomiya]].
* All of Inazuma's 5 star characters are [[:Category:Event-Exclusive Characters|Event-Exclusive Characters]].
* After completing the {{Quest|Transient Dreams}}, it is possible to enter Inazuma without being teleported back due to the abolishment of the Sakoku Decree.

===Etymology===
* Inazuma is inspired by Japan. The name of the region {{Lang|"Inazuma"|ja=稲妻|ja_rm=Inadzuma}} means "lightning" in Japanese.
** The modern Japanese word {{Lang|''inazuma''|ja=稲妻|ja_rm=inadzuma}} originates from an Old Japanese word spelled with the same kanji {{Lang||ojp={{wt|稲妻}}|ojp_rm=inaNduma}}, literally meaning "rice's spouse" (nowadays ''tsuma'' (> ''zuma'') means "wife," but it was gender-neutral in ancient times). In ancient Japan, there was a lot of thunder during the rice fruition period, so there was a belief that lightning would produce rice, and thus Japanese found "rice's spouse" as a nickname of thunder.
** The Japanese word has two coexisting spellings in Modern Japanese: {{ja|いなづま|rm=inadzuma}} (using {{ja|つ|rm=tsu}} with {{w|Dakuten and handakuten|''dakuten''}}) and {{ja|いなずま|rm=inazuma}} (using {{ja|す|rm=su}} with ''dakuten''). Since {{ja|づ|rm=dzu}} and {{ja|ず|rm=zu}} are pronounced identically in Modern Japanese,<ref group="Note">Some dialects preserve the difference between the {{w|Yotsugana|two sounds}}.</ref> many speakers today spell it with {{ja|ず|rm=zu}} despite the proper spelling being with {{ja|づ|rm=dzu}}.<ref group="Note">As per proper {{w|Rendaku|{{Rubi|連濁|れんだく}} (rendaku)}} rules in {{w|ja:現代仮名遣い|{{ja|{{Rubi|現代|げんだい|仮名|かな|遣|づか}}い|rm=Gendai Kanadzukai|tl=Modern kana orthography}}}}; the first syllable of {{ja|妻|rm=tsuma}} is {{ja|つ|rm=tsu}}, therefore it should exhibit sequential voicing and become {{ja|づ|rm=dzu}}.</ref> The game officially uses the {{ja|ず|rm=zu}} spelling ({{ja|いなずま}}), meaning it should be romanized as "Inazuma" and not "Inadzuma."

===Cultural References ===
* The Sakoku Decree of Inazuma and collection of Visions parallels the real-life ''{{w|sakoku}}'' policy under the Japanese Tokugawa shogunate.
* The Inazuma Shogunate, the ruling body of the country, is a direct reference to the same government used under the Japanese shogunate.
* The Inazuman Emblem consists of traditional Japanese elements.
** At the center of the emblem lies a ''{{w|torii}}'', the sacred gate of a Shinto shrine.
** Inside the ''torii'' gate, there is an [[Electro]] symbol, based on a ''{{w|tomoe|mitsudomoe}}''. {{w|Raijin}}, God of Thunder, often carries drums with ''mitsudomoe'' symbols.
** The rounded rectangles seen at the both sides of the torii are called {{w|ja:すやり霞|''suyari-gasumi''}} and represent clouds, fog, or haze in traditional Japanese paintings and woodblock prints.
** Under the ''torii'' gate, three comma-shaped jewels are illustrated. Among these ''{{w|magatama}}'' beads, the most important one is ''Yasakani no Magatama'', one of the three {{w|Imperial Regalia of Japan}} and the symbol of benevolence.
** A ''sakura'' (cherry) blossom crowns the torii gate. In Japanese culture, it usually represents the aesthetics of {{Lang|''{{w|mono no aware}}''|ja=もののあはれ|ja_tl=the pathos of things}}, or the awareness of impermanence, ephemeral beauty, and the gentle sadness of things. But considering the in-game Inazuman ideal "eternity",<ref name="AQ-1-2-6" /> in this case the ''sakura'' blossom may symbolize the "endless cycle of death and rebirth".<ref>The Japan Times: [https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2020/02/22/lifestyle/ephemeral-bliss-castles-bloom/ Ephemeral bliss: Castles in bloom]</ref>
* The design and theme of the [[Watatsumi Island]] is the amalgamation of the {{w|Ryukyuan religion}} (indigenous belief system of southwestern islands in Japan) endorsed by the {{w|Ryukyu Kingdom}} (1429–1879; its capital was in {{w|Okinawa Island|Okinawa}}) and the sea-god {{w|Watatsumi}} mythology in mainland Japan, as the divine sea realm {{w|Ryukyuan religion#Nirai Kanai|Nirai Kanai}} in Ryukyu and the sea dragon palace {{w|Ryūgū-jō|Ryuuguu-jou}} in the mainland are often identified with each other.
* Names used in the [[Tsurumi Island]] are based on the {{w|Ainu language}}, spoken by the {{w|Ainu people}}, an indigenous people in now the northern part of Japan (such as {{w|Hokkaido}} Island) and now the southeasternmost part of Russia (such as {{w|Sakhalin}} Island).
