==Notable Features==

* [[Balethunder]], a [[Climate]] condition that drains [[Health|HP]] and is found in certain parts of Inazuma.
* [[Electrified Water]], an environmental hazard that massively drains [[Health|HP]] and is found in certain parts of Inazuma.

* [[Thunder Sakura]], a tree that periodically sends down lightning in any weather until a certain quest is completed.
* [[Thunderstone]]s, a stone that deals damage to anyone inside a [[Thunder Barrier]].
* [[Thunder Spheres]], an exploration object that allows for fast air travel along predefined paths.
* Puzzles such as [[Lightning Strike Probe]]s, [[Electro Current Puzzle]]s, [[Cube Devices]], and [[Sacred Stone Puzzle]]s.

==Trivia==
[[File:Inazuma Latin "Motto".png|150px|thumb|Screenshot from [[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]]]
* In the trailer ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]'', under the title of the quest ''[[Omnipresence Over Mortals]]'', there is a line written in Teyvat's [[Latin-Based Language|Latin script]]. It reads "''Perpetua perennis impervia''" which translates to "Perpetual, perennial, impervious."
* A competition called "This Novel Is Amazing!" is held periodically in Inazuma, by the [[Yae Publishing House]], a giant of the Inazuma publishing industry.<ref name="novel">{{Ref/Quest|This Novel Is Amazing!}}</ref>
* According to [[Xu]], a novel called "[[A Legend of Sword]]" is "all the rage in Inazuma right now" It was written by an author in [[Liyue]], although the exact person is unknown to the residents of Inazuma. The author is revealed to be [[Xingqiu]].
* According to [[Barbara]], there are blue trees that exist by the sea shore near Inazuma City.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Barbara|Anything to share...}}</ref>
* [[Kaedehara Kazuha]] is the first playable character from Inazuma in the global release.
** [[Kamisato Ayaka]] was available in a closed beta test version of the game, but wasn't released as part of the global release of the game until Version 2.0.
* The storm barrier that was created as part of the [[Sakoku Decree]] is encountered as the climate [[A Nation Closed by Thunder]] when attempting to enter or leave Inazuma via ice bridging or [[Waverider]]. When players are too far in the storm barrier, they are teleported to [[Liyue Harbor]] if they tried to enter Inazuma or [[Ritou]] if they tried to exit Inazuma. This means that the only way to get to Inazuma for the first time is through the {{Quest|Setting Sail}}, during which the [[Teleport Waypoint]] at the docks of Ritou will be automatically unlocked, and the only way to enter and leave Inazuma afterwards is through activated Teleport Waypoints (including [[Portable Waypoint]]s), [[Statues of The Seven]], and [[Domains]].
** After completing the {{Quest|Transient Dreams}}, it is possible to enter Inazuma via the aforementioned methods without being teleported back due to the abolishment of the Sakoku Decree.

===Etymology===
* The name of the region {{Lang|"Inazuma"|ja=稲妻|ja_rm=Inadzuma}} means "lightning" in Japanese.
** The modern Japanese word {{Lang|''inazuma''|ja=稲妻|ja_rm=inadzuma}} originates from an Old Japanese word spelled with the same kanji {{Lang||ojp={{wt|稲妻}}|ojp_rm=inaNduma}}, literally meaning "rice's spouse" (nowadays ''tsuma'' (> ''zuma'') means "wife," but it was gender-neutral in ancient times). In ancient Japan, there was a lot of thunder during the rice fruition period, so there was a belief that lightning would produce rice, and thus Japanese found "rice's spouse" as a nickname of thunder.
** The Japanese word has two coexisting spellings in Modern Japanese: {{ja|いなづま|rm=inadzuma}} (using {{ja|つ|rm=tsu}} with {{w|Dakuten and handakuten|''dakuten''}}) and {{ja|いなずま|rm=inazuma}} (using {{ja|す|rm=su}} with ''dakuten''). Since {{ja|づ|rm=dzu}} and {{ja|ず|rm=zu}} are pronounced identically in Modern Japanese,<ref group="Note">Some dialects preserve the difference between the {{w|Yotsugana|two sounds}}.</ref> many speakers today spell it with {{ja|ず|rm=zu}} despite the proper spelling being with {{ja|づ|rm=dzu}}.<ref group="Note">As per proper {{w|Rendaku|連濁 (rendaku)}} rules in {{w|ja:現代仮名遣い|{{ja|現代仮名遣い|rm=Gendai Kanadzukai|tl=Modern kana orthography}}}}; the first syllable of {{ja|妻|rm=tsuma}} is {{ja|つ|rm=tsu}}, therefore it should exhibit sequential voicing and become {{ja|づ|rm=dzu}}.</ref> The game officially uses the {{ja|ず|rm=zu}} spelling ({{ja|いなずま}}), meaning it should be romanized as "Inazuma" and not "Inadzuma."

===Cultural References===
* Inazuma is inspired by Japan.
* Much like real-life Japan, Inazuma is currently only reachable by the sea around the islands.
* The Sakoku Decree of Inazuma and collection of Visions parallels the real-life ''{{w|sakoku}}'' policy under the Japanese Tokugawa shogunate.
* The Inazuma Shogunate, the ruling body of the country, is a direct reference to the same government used under the Japanese shogunate.
* The Inazuman Emblem consists of traditional Japanese elements.
** At the center of the emblem lies a ''{{w|torii}}'', the sacred gate of a Shinto shrine.
** Inside the ''torii'' gate, there is an [[Electro]] symbol, based on a ''{{w|tomoe|mitsudomoe}}''. {{w|Raijin}}, God of Thunder, often carries drums with ''mitsudomoe'' symbols.
** The rounded rectangles seen at the both sides of the torii are called {{w|ja:すやり霞|''suyari-gasumi''}} and represent clouds, fog, or haze in traditional Japanese paintings and woodblock prints.
** Under the ''torii'' gate, three comma-shaped jewels are illustrated. Among these ''{{w|magatama}}'' beads, the most important one is ''Yasakani no Magatama'', one of the three {{w|Imperial Regalia of Japan}} and the symbol of benevolence.
** A ''sakura'' (cherry) blossom crowns the torii gate. In Japanese culture, it usually represents the aesthetics of {{Lang|''{{w|mono no aware}}''|ja=もののあはれ|ja_tl=the pathos of things}}, or the awareness of impermanence, ephemeral beauty, and the gentle sadness of things. But considering the in-game Inazuman ideal "eternity",<ref name="AQ-1-2-6">{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref> in this case the ''sakura'' blossom may symbolize the "endless cycle of death and rebirth".<ref>The Japan Times: [https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2020/02/22/lifestyle/ephemeral-bliss-castles-bloom/ Ephemeral bliss: Castles in bloom]</ref>
* The design and theme of the [[Watatsumi Island]] is the amalgamation of the {{w|Ryukyuan religion}} (indigenous belief system of southwestern islands in Japan) endorsed by the {{w|Ryukyu Kingdom}} (1429–1879; its capital was in {{w|Okinawa Island|Okinawa}}) and the sea-god {{w|Watatsumi}} mythology in mainland Japan, as the divine sea realm {{w|Ryukyuan religion#Nirai Kanai|Nirai Kanai}} in Ryukyu and the sea dragon palace {{w|Ryūgū-jō|Ryuuguu-jou}} in the mainland are often identified with each other.
* Names used in the [[Tsurumi Island]] are based on the {{w|Ainu language}}, spoken by the {{w|Ainu people}}, an indigenous people in now the northern part of Japan (such as {{w|Hokkaido}} Island) and now the southeasternmost part of Russia (such as {{w|Sakhalin}} Island).
