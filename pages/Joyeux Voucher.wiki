Joyeux Vouchers can be obtained by finding [[Voucher Box]]es and opening [[Fascinating Chest]]s. They can be further located with the [[Flowing Joyspar]] or [[Felicitous Joyspar]] gadgets, which are unlocked upon earning 90 and 270 Joyeux Vouchers respectively. There are a total of 315 Joyeux Vouchers.
