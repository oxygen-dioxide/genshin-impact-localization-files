===Tutorial===
;Rhythm Ball{{Colon}} Rules
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Rhythm Ball Meztli 1.png
|text1  = While playing Rhythm Ball, the player must {{Color|BP|actively serve their ball}}, and propel the Pinball forward.<br>The Pinball will rebound upon colliding with the bar. If the collision occurs {{Color|BP|while the bar is moving}}, the {{Color|BP|rebound vector}} of the ball will also change.<br>The more efficiently you destroy bricks during a stage, the more points you will gain when the stage ends.
|image2 = Tutorial Rhythm Ball Meztli 2.png
|text2  = Based on the {{Color|BP|Elemental Type}} possessed by the character controlling the bar, the bar will be infused with the corresponding element and {{Color|BP|apply the same element}} to the Pinball.<br>During Rhythm Ball, when there are {{Color|BP|Pyro, Hydro, Cryo, Electro, or Anemo}} Characters on the field, they will apply their corresponding element to the bar.<br>Detailed Elemental reaction rules can be found in the event menu.
|image3 = Tutorial Rhythm Ball Meztli 3.png
|text3  = {{Color|BP|Reserve balls have a limit}} during challenges. Once the {{Color|BP|last}} Pinball shoots past the {{Color|BP|lower boundary}}, it will be considered lost, and will permanently reduce the number of balls in your reserve.<br>When reserve balls are at zero, you will fail the challenge.
|image4 = Tutorial Rhythm Ball Meztli 4.png
|text4  = {{Color|BP|Bass Bricks}} will appear in the stage at intervals. Destroy them to gain the buff effects for this stage.<br>After gaining the buff that increases the number of Pinballs, up to 3 Pinballs can exist on the field at a time.
|image5 = Tutorial Rhythm Ball Meztli 5.png
|text5  = When there are less than a requisite amount of bricks on the field, the bar will {{Color|BP|fire a flurry of fireworks forward}}. Should any of these fireworks hit a brick, they will inflict DMG. You can use this method to destroy bricks that are hard to hit.
}}

;Rhythm Ball{{Colon}} Detonatorball
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Rhythm Ball Meztli Rhythm Ball Detonatorball 1.png
|text1  = After a Pinball triggers an Overloaded reaction with the bar, it will gain the {{Color|BP|Detonate}} effect: Upon hitting a brick, a blast that {{Color|BP|deals AoE DMG}} to surrounding bricks will occur.
}}

;Rhythm Ball{{Colon}} Freezeball
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Rhythm Ball Meztli Rhythm Ball Freezeball 1.png
|text1  = After a Pinball triggers a Frozen reaction with the bar, it will {{Color|BP|temporarily halt in place on the bar}}, though the bar will still be able to move. After the Frozen duration elapses, the Pinball will automatically shoot forward. Alternatively, it can also be preemptively propelled by active choice.
}}

;Rhythm Ball{{Colon}} Surgeball
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Rhythm Ball Meztli Rhythm Ball Surgeball 1.png
|text1  = After a Pinball hits the bar and causes an Electro-Charged reaction, the {{Color|BP|Surge}} effect will be applied, unleashing lightning from the struck brick that randomly {{Color|BP|deals DMG within a fixed AoE}} to surrounding bricks.
}}

;Rhythm Ball{{Colon}} Dissipate
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Rhythm Ball Meztli Rhythm Ball Dissipate 1.png
|text1  = When a Pinball hits a brick and causes a Swirl reaction, the {{Color|BP|Dissipate}} effect will be triggered, {{Color|BP|applying the Element}} within a {{Color|BP|fixed AoE}} to surrounding bricks. When these bricks come into contact with other Elements, they will perform the relevant reactions.
}}

;Rhythm Ball{{Colon}} Detonate
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Rhythm Ball Meztli Rhythm Ball Detonate 1.png
|text1  = When a Pinball hits a brick and causes an Overloaded reaction, the {{Color|BP|Detonate}} effect will be triggered, unleashing a blast that {{Color|BP|deals AoE DMG}} to surrounding bricks.
}}

;Rhythm Ball{{Colon}} Coagulating
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Rhythm Ball Meztli Rhythm Ball Coagulating 1.png
|text1  = When a Pinball hits a brick and triggers the Frozen reaction, it will unleash the {{Color|BP|Coagulating}} effect: Causes {{Color|BP|all bricks of the same type}} that are connected to the struck brick to be frozen. Should the Pinball strike a frozen brick again, it will {{Color|BP|immediately shatter}} that brick along with all other frozen bricks connected to it.
}}

;Rhythm Ball{{Colon}} Surge
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Rhythm Ball Meztli Rhythm Ball Surge 1.png
|text1  = After a Pinball hits a brick and causes an Electro-Charged reaction, the {{Color|BP|Surge}} effect will be triggered, unleashing lightning from the struck brick's position that randomly {{Color|BP|deals DMG within a fixed AoE}} to surrounding bricks.
}}

;Rhythm Ball{{Colon}} Pierce
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Rhythm Ball Meztli Rhythm Ball Pierce 1.png
|text1  =  When a Pinball hits a brick and causes the Superconduct reaction, the {{Color|BP|Pierce}} effect will be inflicted: Hit bricks no longer cause reflections. Instead, the ball will continue moving forward, {{Color|BP|punching through all bricks in its path}}. The effect ends when the Pinball strikes the boundary.
}}

;Rhythm Ball{{Colon}} Steaming
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Rhythm Ball Meztli Rhythm Ball Steaming 1.png

}}

;Rhythm Boss II
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Rhythm Ball Meztli Rhythm Boss II 1.png

}}

;Rhythm Boss III
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Rhythm Ball Meztli Rhythm Boss III 1.png
|text1  = The Rhythm Boss "Blazing Beat Lavabird" has multiple Lava Deflectors behind it. When your Pinballs hit these, they will split into multiple balls and bounce back.
