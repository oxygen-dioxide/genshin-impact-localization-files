==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
Avice is the lover of [[Faissolle]]. After Faissolle lost his hat and came under the scrutiny of the [[Beret Society]], Avice rushed to talk with Wriothesley and the Traveler at a safe time, giving info to reveal the secrets of the Beret Society. She removed her hat and gave her hairpin to the Traveler and Wriothesley. They discover the hairpin contained a thorn that could inject Aqua Doloris (liquid "fear") to make people experience unpleasant memories, similar to the effects of touching the dark stone.

In the end, Faissolle and Avice get married and ask Wriothesley to help them host the wedding in Meropide.
