'''Narukami's Law''' is [[Raiden Shogun]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
The Raiden Shogun's long hair is braided. On the right side of her head is a hairpin with pale violet flowers resembling morning glories and a fan-shaped piece; the latter belonged to [[Ei]]'s twin sister, [[Makoto]].

The outfit consists of a dark purple bodysuit under a short lavender kimono. The sleeves of her bodysuit completely cover her arms and are looped over her middle fingers with golden rings to partly cover her palms and the top of her hands. Her kimono has an assortment of patterns in different shades of purple and crimson. On the back of her outfit, she wears a crimson bow with tassels. She wears dark purple thigh-high stockings with small diamond openings at the top and high-heeled sandals; the one on the right is adorned with two of the same violet flowers on her hairpin. Her nails are painted purple. She also wears a small crimson ribbon on her neck as a choker. There are also three objects on her outfit with the {{Electro}} symbol: her left pauldron, the ornament on her waist at the front, and the fan-like ornament on her waist at the back.
