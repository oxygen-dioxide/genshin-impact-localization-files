'''Narukami's Law''' is [[Raiden Shogun]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
The Raiden Shogun's long violet hair is braided. At the right side of her head is an ōgi-bira {{w|kanzashi}} (fan-shaped hairpiece) which appears to have belonged to [[Ei]]'s twin sister, [[Makoto]]; it is adorned with two pale violet flowers that resemble {{w|Platycodon|balloon flowers}}.

Her outfit consists of a shear dark purple bodysuit under an extremely short lavender kimono. The sleeves of her bodysuit completely cover her arms and terminate at golden rings on her middle fingers, partly cover her palms and the tops of her hands. The back and sleeves of her kimono are decorated with {{w|tomoe}}, flower, and wave patterns in shades of purple and gold. Her kimono is fastened with a crimson {{w|Obi (sash)|obi}} tied into a bow at her back. She wears dark purple thigh-high stockings with small diamond openings at the top and high-heeled sandals; her right ankle is adorned with two of the same flowers in her hair and on her kimono. Her nails are painted purple. A small red ribbon sits at her neck over her bodysuit, which covers her neck and shoulders but leaves open a window for her chest and upper back. There are also three objects on her outfit with the {{Electro}} symbol: a black pauldron on her left shoulder, a tasseled ornament at the front of her obi, and a fan-like ornament on her obi's bow.
