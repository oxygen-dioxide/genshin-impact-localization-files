'''Stainless Bloom''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Pale Flame]].

==Description==
"You astound me. You have but a human body, and yet you carry such a power within you."<br />"You claim that you have no tears left to cry, no blood left to shed, but surely this is because you have filled yourself with fire..."<br />"Though your body has long been covered in scars, fierce flames are all that now may flow, like molten iron, from your eyes and your wounds."<br />"But we appear to have gotten off-topic. The reason I followed the trail of smoke and tracked you down is that I wish to strike a deal with you..."<br />"Let the flames that now devour you be extinguished by the grace of Her Majesty.<br />What say you?"

[[Pierro|The first Fatuus]] gave power to a [[Signora|young woman]] in whom the flame of life had all but died,<br />And in her wild imagination, she saw the line that lay between the corrupt past and a stainless future...

"I understand. Then, let glacial ice take the place of my erased past and extinguish these undying flames."<br />"Let the darkness of corruption, the pain of the world, and the humans, beasts, and the sin they carry all be purified by silent ice."

But despite this, a pure white flame continued to burn within her heart...

"We share the same goal, you, your [[Tsaritsa]], and I."<br />"Cleanse the sources of distortion in this world: short-sighted, ignorant gods and the darkness and corruption of [[the Abyss]]."<br />"Good. I will do whatever it takes to become an effective instrument in the advancement of our common cause."<br />"For even if I dress in pure white from head to toe, the ashes of the dead that have long left their stain on every inch of my being can never be cleansed."
