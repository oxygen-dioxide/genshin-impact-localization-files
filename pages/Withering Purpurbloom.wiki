{{Description|A flower, the leaves and petals of which look scorched and withered, that can often be seen in places where ash abounds.<br>From the name Purpurbloom, you would assume that their colors would be deeper and more vibrant. Yet even these flowers, once so cherished by the people of [[Ochkanatlan (Civilization)|Cinder City]], could not escape being tainted by the cankering shadow that enveloped their entire city. In the end, they too were consumed by [[Scarlet-Eyed Youth|the god]]'s raging inferno. Even today, simply by observing their charred, desiccated leaves, one gets a vague sense of the all-engulfing power of that raging fire that once melted a city entire.|[[Archive]]}}
