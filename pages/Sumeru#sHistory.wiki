A timeline of historical events in the [[Sumeru]] region. Due to a lack of relative dates, most of Sumeru's pre-[[cataclysm]] lore cannot be verifiably categorized and have been placed in the earliest reasonable timeframe.
{{Transclude|section=1|Timeline|TimelineNote}}

==The Old World==
{{main|Timeline#The Old World}}
''No particular events unique to Sumeru are known at this time.''

==The New World==
{{main|Timeline#The New World}}
* As the avatar of [[Irminsul]], [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] presumably came into existence at some point in time long in the past.<ref name="Boat">{{Ref/Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies}}</ref><ref group="Assumption">Given that [[Sal Vindagnyr]], a Divine Envoy era civilization, fell after its ancient white tree (presumably similar to, or a branch of, Irminsul) was destroyed by the Skyfrost Nail, it can be assumed that Irminsul also existed during that era. However, this does not indicate when exactly Rukkhadevata came into existence.</ref>
* A member of the original [[Seelie]] race, heavily implied to be the [[Goddess of Flowers]], survives the downfall of the Seelie race.<ref name="For the Children of the Past">{{Ref/Quest|For the Children of the Past|quote='''Arama:''' There was once a survivor of that race deep within the golden desert who was friends with [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|Queen Aranyani]] and [[King Deshret|ruler of Valuka]].}}</ref><ref name="Scroll of Streaming Song">{{Ref/Book|Scroll of Streaming Song}}</ref>
* The [[Jinn]], a race of elemental spirits who come from the moon, also survive the destruction and can recount stories about [[Aria, Sonnet and Canon]] and the morning stars.<ref name="Shepherd">{{Ref/Item|The Shepherd and the Magic Bottle}}</ref>

==Divine Envoy Era==
''Note: It is unclear when the civilization of the three God-Kings, its destruction, and the span of various human city-states existed beyond "thousands of years ago," so they have been tentatively placed under the Divine Envoy Era.''
* A certain incident occurs involving the "first divine pillar" which "descended from the sky," causing the once-lush land to turn into desert.<ref name="Shadow of the Sand King">{{Ref/Arti|Shadow of the Sand King}}</ref><ref group="Assumption">Assuming that this divine pillar is similar in nature to Dragonspine's [[Skyfrost Nail]] and the [[Chasm Nail]], this may suggest that the event occurred at a similar time. The city states created under the rule of the God-King(s) is set "later," and nearly all of King Deshret's lore &mdash; even ones apparently written long in the past &mdash; has given him epithets related to the desert, indicating that the desert had to have already existed.</ref>

==Pre-Archon War==
* According to legend, [[King Deshret]] was a "son of the sky,"<ref name="TLAA">{{Ref/Item|The Lay of Al-Ahmar}}</ref> but he was born after the fall of the Seelie and the [[Moon Sisters]] and only learned of their stories from an unspecified woman (likely either the Goddess of Flowers or Greater Lord Rukkhadevata).<ref name="SotSS">{{Ref/Weapon|Staff of the Scarlet Sands}}</ref><ref group="Lore Discrepancy">The narrative in ''The Lay of Al-Ahmar'' suggests that he once lived in Celestia. However, this is not corroborated by the narrative of ''The Shepherd and the Magic Bottle'' (which states that he learned the story of the Moon Sisters from the Jinn) or the description of Staff of the Scarlet Sands (which is narrated from Deshret's point of view and says that "she" &mdash; either the Goddess of Flowers or Greater Lord Rukkhadevata &mdash; told him the story instead).</ref>
* The [[Goddess of Flowers]], [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]], and King Deshret befriend each other and become known as the God-Kings of Sumeru.<ref name="For the Children of the Past" /><ref name="Scroll of Streaming Song" /><ref name="Gilded Dreams">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Gilded Dreams}}</ref>

===Ay-Khanoum===
* The Goddess of Flowers, King Deshret, and Greater Lord Rukkhadevata &mdash; collectively known as the three God-Kings of Sumeru &mdash; build [[Ay-Khanoum]], the "City of Amphitheaters." Its name means "City of the Moon Maiden" in the ancient language of the [[Jinn]].<ref name="OAM">{{Ref/Item|Oasis Garden's Mourning}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Item|The Shepherd and the Magic Bottle}}</ref>
** The Goddess of Flowers is said to have an "amicable relationship" with the Jinn.<ref name="OAM" />
** According to some legends, King Deshret captured the Jinn in magic bottles marked by his seal, although the Jinn were also his willing servants in his cause of conquering the world. He created Ay-Khanoum as a city for the Jinn, while they created the entrance to the [[Mausoleum of King Deshret]].<ref name="Shepherd" /><ref group="Lore Discrepancy">Because ''The Shepherd and the Magic Bottle'' is a story of unknown and unverifiable origin and excludes any mention of the Goddess of Flowers, it is highly likely that some of its contents are inaccurate. The wiki currently assumes that [[Oasis Garden's Mourning]]'s description is more accurate in its depiction of Ay-Khanoum's history.</ref>
* The Goddess of Flowers dies "due to the malice of the burning sun and yellow sand"<ref name="OAM"/> and the city of Ay-Khanoum is destroyed.<ref name="Dream of Scorching Might">{{Ref/Item|Dream of Scorching Might}}</ref><ref name="ToSaS1">{{Ref/Book|The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin|1}}</ref>
** The Goddess of Flowers desired a "spectacular death" so that the bitterness of her death would preserve her legacy forever. King Deshret, who was enamored with her, never realized this,<ref>{{Ref/Item|Oasis Garden's Truth}}</ref> sending him into an obsessive spiral over the shared vision the three God-Kings once had.<ref name="Dream of Scorching Might" />
** The "promised land of 'Valivija'" is buried by the desert sands, which may correspond with Ay-Khanoum.<ref name="ToSaS1" />
** Following the fall of Ay-Khanoum and the death of the Goddess of Flowers, King Deshret and Greater Lord Rukkhadevata parted ways to create their own civilizations.<ref name="ToSaS1" /><ref name="ODSM">{{Ref/Item|Olden Days of Scorching Might}}</ref>

===Dharma Forest===
''Note: Events in this section are currently assumed to be concurrent with King Deshret's Civilization and Gurabad.''
* After separating from King Deshret, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata comes to the East of the [[Great Red Sand]] and creates the [[Varuna Contraption]] that terraforms part of desert into a rainforest.<ref name="ODSM"/><ref>{{Ref/Domain|The Coordinates of Sun and Rain}}</ref><ref group="Note">The Chinese description for The Coordinates of Sun and Rain details: {{zh|依照传说，司草木的女神在沙漠的一角唤出能召来甘霖的精灵，名之曰「法留纳」亦即「水天」。|tl=According to legend, the goddess who controlled plants summoned, in a part of the desert, a spirit of sweet rains, whose name was Varuna, or "Water-Sky."}}</ref>
** At the border between the forest and the desert, the [[Wall of Samiel]] was erected to prevent the forest from undergoing desertification.
** After the forest labyrinth was created, the lord of the forest Viaghara was born from the moon's reflection on the water, resembling a tiger in shape.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Laurel Coronet}}</ref>
* With the help of her followers, who would go on to establish the [[Amurta]] Darshan of [[Sumeru Akademiya]], Rukkhadevata developed a flourishing rainforest. [[Sumeru City]] was built on the [[Divine Tree]], a particularly massive tree located in Sumeru's forest region, and the sages of Sumeru Akademiya assisted Rukkhadevata in managing the nation's affairs.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/Sjv8d9X9h6s?t=474 Version 3.0 Special Program] (Timestamp: 7m 54s)</ref>
* Rukkhadevata also created the [[Aranara]], small plantlike creatures with the ability to control dreams.<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Aranara}}</ref>
* '''Thousands of years ago:''' Rukkhadevata briefly returns to the desert to help rescue King Deshret's people from the effects of forbidden knowledge, and creates the [[Akasha System]] to help combat it by uniting the people's wisdom.<ref name="Boat" /> However, the endeavor exhausts much of her strength and shrinks her into the stature of a child.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Secret of the Scorching Desert}}</ref>

===King Deshret's Civilization===
* While Rukkhadevata creates a rainforest in a corner of the desert, Deshret continues ruling over the [[Great Red Sand]].
* '''Thousands of years ago:''' King Deshret eventually succumbs to the "poison" of forbidden knowledge.<ref name="SotSS"/><ref name="SoSD">{{Ref/Quest|Secret of the Scorching Desert}}</ref><ref group="Lore Discrepancy">[[The Lay of Al-Ahmar]] suggests that King Deshret heeds the three retainers, builds a great maze for hundreds years, and the kingdom collapses after one night. Since the description of the book states that the information is questionable, the information from the Archon Quest takes advantage.</ref>
** The forbidden knowledge brings calamities upon Sumeru. "People's minds were filled with crazed whispers, [[Eleazar|dark gray scales spread across their bodies]], [[The Withering|even the land was stripped of its vigor]]."<ref name="SoSD"/>
** King Deshret asks Greater Lord Rukkhadevata for help, for the sake of their mutual friend.<ref name="SotSS"/> The Lord of Verdure gathered the priests, instructing them to build temples and creating [[Aaru Village]] as the last bastion of Deshret's civilization. She also expended a great deal of her power to suppress forbidden knowledge and regressed into a childlike form. Even this, however, was not enough; in the end, Deshret sacrificed himself to finally put an end to it.<ref name="SoSD"/>
* King Deshret's civilization fell and splintered into many smaller, human-led city-states.<ref name="Key">{{Ref/Weapon|Key of Khaj-Nisut}}</ref><ref name="Xiphos Moon">{{Ref/Weapon|Xiphos' Moonlight}}</ref>

===Gurabad===
* The vassal city-state of [[Gurabad]] rises after the death of the Goddess of Flowers, during what is known as the vassal states era.<ref name="ToSaS1"/><ref>{{Ref/Item|Transparent Ruins Record (I)}}</ref><ref group="Lore Discrepancy">According to ''The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin'', Gurabad was part of a vassal states era which drew to an end after King Deshret and the Sage-King of the Greenwood (presumably Greater Lord Rukkhadevata) regathered their subjects and recreated their oasis paradise. There is currently insufficient information to confirm or deny its account of the timeline, although there has been no indication of a second Deshret-Rukkhadevata civilization.</ref>
** The story of Gurabad is first known with the vassal king [[Ormazd Shah]]. Ormazd has 300 kins, one of them is [[Shirin of Gurabad|Shirin]], the half-fairy daughter of him and the fairy foremother [[Liloufar]]. Liloufar's three prophecies and three admonitions later become the ultimate destruction of Gurabad.
*** Ormazd adopts [[Parvezravan|Kisra]], and give him the surname "Parvez" for his enormous campaign.<ref name="ToSaS1"/>
*** Kisra Parvez and Shirin are married, though their marriage is not a happy one.<ref name="ToSaS2">{{Ref/Book|The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin|2}}</ref>
*** Shirin and Kisra murder Ormazd and his 300 heirs, and Kisra takes the title of the vassal king. He adds the name "ravan" to his bestowed surname, and now his name is Kisra Parvezravan.<ref name="ToSaS1"/><ref name="ToSaS2"/>
*** The son of Parvezravan and Shirin is born, and is named [[Shiruyeh]]. Fear Liloufar's admonitions, Parvezravan banishes his son, forces him to cover his face, and forbids him to set foot into Gurabad.<ref name="ToSaS2"/>
*** Shirin disguiges herself as a divine princess of the temple to the moon goddess, and gives Shiruyeh false divination to confront Parvezravan. After that, Shiruyeh assassinates his father, claims the throne, and is forgiven by his mother.<ref name="ToSaS2"/>
*** The reign of Shiruyeh does not last long, as he is forever tormented by inescapable nightmares, until one day he fell into a great black chasm during one such frenzy. After that, a great plague emerged from that chasm, and Gurabad, without its king, collapses due to the calamity and the sand.<ref name="ToSaS2"/>
*** The fate of Shirin is questionable: some people say that she was subdued by King Deshret, while others say that she is still searching for her son until today.<ref name="ToSaS2"/>

===City-States Era===
* '''Thousands of years ago, after the extermination of forbidden knowledge:'''<ref name="Key" /> Somehow, a man known as Shah Ramshahr comes to be credited with building the seven towers that were built during the eradication of forbidden knowledge. The towers, which are only known to have been built at the time of King Deshret's death, come to be known as the "Towers of Betrayal."<ref>Viewpoint: [[Viewpoint/Towers of Betrayal|Towers of Betrayal]]</ref>
** According to inscriptions in the desert, seven cities were built around the seven towers, among which included [[Ay-Khanoum]] (which was apparently rebuilt after its initial destruction), [[Gurabad]] (a rebuilt version), [[Saleh]], and  [[Tulaytullah]].<ref>Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, [[Primal Obelisk#Mausoleum of King Deshret, East (Underground)|Mausoleum of King Deshret, East (Underground)]]</ref>

==Recent Past (<100 years ago)==
''Note: The bullets below are arranged in order of relative reverse chronological order, estimated based on characters' apparent ages.''

* '''? years ago:'''<ref group="Assumption">Il Dottore attended Sumeru Akademiya at some point in the past, but the exact timeframe cannot be determined and the existence of his Segments leaves his actual age a mystery. Until more information is given, the wiki assumes he attended Sumeru Akademiya within the past 100 years.</ref> A certain youth attends Sumeru Akademiya, hoping to further his research on creating "enhanced humans" despite rejection from his peers and teachers. [[Pierro]] tracks him down while following rumors about heresy and recruits him into the Fatui as the Harbinger [[Il Dottore]].<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Wise Doctor's Pinion}}</ref>
* '''? years ago:''' [[Collei]] is born in Sumeru<ref>Collei's Official Introduction: [[Collei/Lore#Official Introduction|To grow is to conquer the past]]</ref> with the disease of [[Eleazar]] and is given to a seer named [[Barnabas]]<ref name="CHAP11">{{Ref/Manga|11|1}}</ref> for treatment.

* '''Last Ludi Harpastum (~1 year to 6 months ago):'''<ref group="Note">Crepus' death occurs 3 years before the manga's events while Diluc's character stories place it 4 years before the game's story, making the manga set roughly a year before the game. However, according to Diluc's stories, he returned to Mondstadt after Varka left on his expedition, making his return occur sometime within 6 months before the game's story. The message on the [[Cat's Tail Message Board#About Collei...|Cat's Tail Message Board]] about Collei says she was seen at the "last Ludi Harpastum" before the game's story, with no indication of how long ago it occurred.</ref> The events of the manga's main story, set in Mondstadt, occur.
