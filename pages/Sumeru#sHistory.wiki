Unbeknownst to her parents, however, Barnabas is an agent of the [[Fatui]] and turns Collei into a test subject for their Archon Residue experiments.<ref name="CHAP3">{{Ref/Manga|3|2}}</ref><ref name="CHAP12">{{Ref/Manga|12|2}}</ref>
* '''<4 years ago''' ― ''The following events presumably occur sometime between 4 years ago and the present. The events are listed in a tentative chronological order, but there is no confirmation on when exactly they occurred relative to the present.''

* '''Last Ludi Harpastum (~1 year to 6 months ago)'''<ref group="Note">Crepus' death occurs 3 years before the manga's events while Diluc's character stories place it 4 years before the game's story, making the manga set roughly a year before the game. However, according to Diluc's stories, he returned to Mondstadt after Varka left on his expedition, making his return occur sometime within 6 months before the game's story. The message on the [[Cat's Tail Message Board#About Collei...|Cat's Tail Message Board]] about Collei says she was seen at the "last Ludi Harpastum" before the game's story, with no indication of how long ago it occurred.</ref> ― The events of the manga's main story, set in Mondstadt, occur. At the end of the story, Collei leaves Mondstadt with Cyno to go to Sumeru.<ref name="CHAP16">{{Ref/Manga|16|zh=1}}</ref>
