{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sedile:''' Huh. You're an unfamiliar face. Where did you come from? How did you come to our village?
:'''Sedile:''' Ah, don't be nervous. You must be an adventurer from afar. Sorry. Force of habit from work. I just wanted to say hello.
:{{DIcon}} A habit you picked up at work?
::'''Sedile:''' Yeah. I'm Sedile, an agent of the [[Marechaussee Phantom]]. My usual work involves site inspection and information collection &mdash; all to ensure the safety of Fontaine's citizens.
::'''Sedile:''' So, well... Heh. When I see people I haven't seen before, I get a little nervous. Sorry about that.
:{{DIcon}} So there are people from the Marechaussee Phantom in Merusea Village too, huh.
::'''Sedile:''' Well, that's a matter of course, though, well, I'm just here on vacation...
::'''Sedile:''' If I was one of my colleagues on the job, I wouldn't just be hanging around willy-nilly.
;(After Step 3 of ''[[There Will Come Soft Rains]]'' and before completing ''[[Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic Dog]]'')
:{{DIcon}} About the earthquake just a while ago...
::'''Sedile:''' Yeah, everything shook super hard back there. Ugh. How's a person supposed to rest like this?
::'''Sedile:''' Fortunately, the village seems fine. Hopefully, the other areas aren't affected, either...
:{{DIcon}} See you later...
::'''Sedile:''' ...Alright. I hope you have a good time in the village &mdash; but don't do anything bad! I'm on vacation, and I... really don't wanna do any overtime...
