'''Viridescent Venerer''' is an [[Artifact Set]] available at [[:Category:4-Star Artifacts|4-star]] and [[:Category:5-Star Artifacts|5-star]] rarities which can be obtained from [[Valley of Remembrance]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* The 4-piece set bonus provides a relatively easy way to reduce enemy [[resistance]] to Cryo, Electro, Hydro, or Pyro.
** The resistance reduction applies to the enemy on which [[Swirl]] was triggered as well as any other enemies that get hit by the Swirl's AoE damage.
** Unlike most other effects that deal damage while applying a debuff, the Swirl reduces enemy resistance '''before''' the dealing damage, so the Swirl that triggers the resistance reduction will also deal increased damage.
** Triggering Swirl reactions with multiple aura elements can reduce an enemy's resistances to multiple elements simultaneously.<ref>KeqingMains Theorycrafting Library: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FaLYqA7MBow0DNBPUc2b9t_dEBhvRT-vs-l03PW0Wu8/edit#heading=h.szm4ojrxnznm 4pc Viridescent Venerer can Simultaneously Stack Different Element Resist Debuffs]</ref>
**For long lasting abilities, it's important for the caster to be on field when triggering the Swirl reaction for the four piece bonus to take effect (as the effect cannot be triggered while the caster is off-field). However, even a non-Anemo character can trigger the bonus if their attacks cause the Swirl if they are wearing the set (this requires an Anemo aura such as on the [[Anemo Hypostasis]]).<ref>KeqingMains Theorycrafting Library: [https://library.keqingmains.com/evidence/mechanics/equipment/artifacts#4pc-vv-triggering-mechanics  4pc VV triggering mechanics]</ref>
**The 60% Swirl DMG increase is additive with the Swirl DMG increase from [[Elemental Mastery]].<ref>KeqingMains Theorycrafting Library: [https://library.keqingmains.com/evidence/mechanics/equipment/artifacts#4pc-viridescent-venerer-explained  4pc Viridescent Venerer Explained]</ref>
