: {{DIcon|Idle}} Coastal defenses...
:: {{A|VO Xuanzhu 01.ogg}} "We need to increase our coastal defense capabilities!"
{{Dialogue End}}

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Xuanzhu:''' Building more watchtowers does more than eliminate security blind spots. It also improves the efficiency of coastal defenses...
:{{DIcon}} Watchtowers? Coastal defenses?
::'''Xuanzhu:''' You're interested in military engineering too?
::'''Xuanzhu:''' Hmm... I can see the righteous spark in your eyes. Perhaps you'll join our foreign aid unit or become a reliable ally of ours one day.
::'''Xuanzhu:''' In that case, allow me to give you a brief explanation.
::'''Xuanzhu:''' In short, we have a long coastline with complex terrain around Yilong Wharf, and there are many blind spots all across it...
::'''Xuanzhu:''' If more simple and low-cost watchtowers can be built, we will be able to control the border efficiently.
::'''Xuanzhu:''' Forget bandits. Even a ferocious hawk wouldn't be able to get through then.
::'''Xuanzhu:''' Of course, this assumes that we can figure our duty schedule first out.
::'''Xuanzhu:''' If we perfect a sound tube transmission system while building the watchtowers and coastal defenses, we will be able to coordinate better...
::'''Xuanzhu:''' At that point, our first line of defense will be considerably resilient, and it can act as a severe deterrent to even the most formidable foes.
::{{DIcon}} What are you hoping to achieve?
::'''Xuanzhu:''' We are exploring the idea of cooperative engagement capability, separating units that receive intelligence from the units that launch the attack, which will give us an advantage...
::'''Xuanzhu:''' Stationary ballistae and blast-launching mechanisms can be placed behind the ridge, out of the enemy's sight.
::'''Xuanzhu:''' While attacking, some units won't aim at our targets directly, instead observing from a forward position and constantly reporting on target positions, firing based on information received.
::'''Xuanzhu:''' As long as they keep correcting the trajectory, their projectiles will hit the target eventually.
::'''Xuanzhu:''' This way, we can use distance as our defense, especially when our numbers are very limited.
::'''Xuanzhu:''' This would be extremely effective against enemies whose attacks require direct line of sight, such as ruin mechanisms.
::'''Xuanzhu:''' If our technology keeps advancing, we might be able to design mechanisms that can automatically correct the trajectory of arrows and shells to some extent.
::'''Xuanzhu:''' Add on observers who will provide correction data, and our efficiency will increase a hundred, even a thousand times.
::'''Xuanzhu:''' At that point, no number of ruin mechanisms will make any difference.
:{{DIcon}} Is war going to break out?
::'''Xuanzhu:''' Not at all. It is our duty to prepare for rainy days and take precautions.
::'''Xuanzhu:''' We enjoy a good relationship with Fontaine, and we do not expect our relations to turn sour in the coming centuries...
::'''Xuanzhu:''' But according to historical data, our primary enemy has never been foreign nations, but something even more powerful.
::'''Xuanzhu:''' Our predecessors succeeded in stopping the huge threat from centuries ago, but no one can be certain that we will not face even greater foes one day.
::'''Xuanzhu:''' It would be too late to start preparing when danger is already at the door.
::'''Xuanzhu:''' That is why we must build our defenses based on the worst-case scenario and the most mighty enemy possible.
:{{DIcon}} You can do it, I won't keep you any longer!
::'''Xuanzhu:''' I thank you for your support. It is our wont to seek improvement while maintaining stability.
