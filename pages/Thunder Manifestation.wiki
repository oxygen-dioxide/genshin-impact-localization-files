{{Description|An abnormal Electro elemental life form. Although it might appear similar to an [[Oceanid]], it does not possess her intelligence or memories.<br />That which drives the Thunder Manifestation is a much more primal fury.<br />It is said that these life forms will only descend like lightning upon places that play host to great lingering resentment, such as the fragmented Amakumo Peak, where the storm clouds ever roil. As long as the grudges of the land do not fade, so will the roaring thunder persist.|[[Archive]]}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
Note: Ability and attack names are unofficial except for '''Strike Probes''' and '''Homing Thunder Cage'''.

===While not Enraged===
*'''Strike Probes:''' Flies into the air and releases several Electro probes around the arena that pulse intermittently, dealing '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} on landing. Upon entering the range of these sigils while it is pulsing, the Thunder Manifestation continuously gains [[Rage]], but will lose the accumulated Rage if the player exits the range.
*'''Random Strikes:''' Performs several lightning strikes randomly around the arena that each deal '''78% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.
*'''Full Arena Strike:''' After reaching '''75%''' HP, if not enraged, unleashes a huge Electro shockwave that deals '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} across the entire arena and automatically enraging the Manifestation.
**This attack cannot be used in the [[Spiral Abyss]].

===While Enraged===
When enranged, each of the Thunder Manifestation's attacks will target one of the marked players instead of all players. Other players can still take damage if they are within an attack's AoE.

*'''Blink:''' Teleports to any point of the arena instantly.
*'''Slicing Storm:''' Curls up and rotates its wings, spinning forward and rapidly slicing targets in its way, rapidly and randomly dealing '''50% ATK''', '''25% ATK''', '''12.5% ATK''', '''5% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
*'''Smack:''' Quickly raises one of its wings and smacks at its target, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}. Only triggered if in melee range.
*'''Walls of Lightning:''' Summons two walls of lightning to the target's sides which quickly close in on them, rapidly and randomly dealing '''180% ATK''', '''90% ATK''', '''126% ATK''', '''36% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} on contact.
*'''Sundering Plumes:''' Forms five sets of electric feathers, and releases them against the target, each dealing '''52% ATK''', '''26% ATK''', '''13% ATK''', '''5.2% ATK''', '''5.2% ATK''' respectively as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
*'''Dive Bomb:''' Flies and repositions itself near the border of the arena, then it dives forward in a straight line, dealing '''150% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
*'''Torrential Descent:''' Flies up and calls forth several lightning bolts to descend upon the target. The bolts will strike in a circular area, and for every wave it will strike three times, each dealing '''78% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.
*'''Homing Thunder Cage:''' Charges up and marks the target with a thunder circle for a short duration. The circle will then stop and activate, unleashing an electrical prison that homes in on the target, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DoT}} if touched or inside of.

==Strategy==
Similarly to the [[Electro Hypostasis]], the Thunder Manifestation is an entity of pure {{Electro}} energy and thus is immune to all Electro attacks. While the Thunder Manifestation is a flying target, it typically sticks low to the ground, allowing for melee units to hit it. However, it tends to teleport frequently and as such, {{Pyro}} or {{Cryo}} characters are recommended when fighting this boss, especially bow or catalyst users due to their ability to attack and/or home in from afar and the fight mostly requiring players to dodge its attacks when it becomes berserk.

Like [[Specters]], the Thunder Manifestation has a "Fury" buff which is initially empty. In its passive state, the Thunder Manifestation only unleashes strike probes and occasional shockwaves that increase its fury if the player is caught in them. In the event of the strike probes, simply walking out of their radius will cause its fury to deplete. The bar automatically fills if the player gets caught in one of the sporadic shockwaves or upon reaching 75% of its health if not enraged. In this state, the Thunder Manifestation uses more powerful attacks that deal massive damage if not dodged or shielded against. {{Geo}} characters can provide [[Crystallize]] to generate Electro shards, which can mitigate a reasonable amount of damage from its attacks.
