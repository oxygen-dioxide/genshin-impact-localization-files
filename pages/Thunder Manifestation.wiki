===While not Enraged===
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = Lightning Probes
|file_1      = Thunder Manifestation Strike Probes
|desc_1      = Flies into the air and releases 5 Lightning Strike Probes around the arena, dealing '''16.6% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} on landing. They begin pulsing after the Thunder Manifestation uses '''Close-Range Detection'''. When a player enters the range of a pulsing Lightning Strike Probe, the Thunder Manifestation continuously gains [[Rage]], but will lose the accumulated Rage if the player exits the range.

|name_2      = Close-Range Detection
|desc_2      = Releases a pulse around itself, dealing '''83.3% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}. If a player is hit by this attack, the Thunder Manifestation immediately locks onto them and enters its enraged state.

|name_3      = Random Strikes
|desc_3      = If the player is far from the Thunder Manifestation, flies up and calls forth 2 waves of 8 lightning bolts that strike in a circle around the arena, each dealing '''43.3% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
|file_3      = Thunder Manifestation Random Strikes

|name_4      = Slicing Storm
|desc_4      = If the player is close to the Thunder Manifestation, curls up and rotates its wings, spinning in place and slicing targets in its way, rapidly dealing '''27.7% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}. This attack is affected by the [[Damage Sequence]].
|file_4      = Thunder Manifestation Slicing Storm No Enrage

|name_5      = Shockwave
|desc_5      = After sustaining 10 hits, releases a shockwave around itself that deals '''27.7% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} around it. When it reaches 74% HP, it will instead release an even larger shockwave that deals '''27.7% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} across the entire arena. If a character is hit by these shockwaves, the Thunder Manifestation immediately locks onto them and enters its enraged state.
|file_5      = Thunder Manifestation Full Arena Strike
}}

===While Enraged===
When enraged, each of the Thunder Manifestation's attacks will target one of the marked players instead of all players. Other players can still take damage if they are within an attack's AoE.

{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = Blink
|desc_1      = Teleports to any point of the arena instantly.

|name_2      = Slicing Storm
|desc_2      = Curls up and rotates its wings, spinning forward and slicing targets in its way, rapidly dealing '''27.7% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}. This attack is affected by the [[Damage Sequence]].

|name_3      = Thunderous Wingslash
|file_3      = Thunder Manifestation Smack
|desc_3      = Quickly raises one of its wings and smacks at its target, dealing '''55.5% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}. Only triggered if in melee range.

|name_4      = Strifeful Lightning
|desc_4      = Summons two walls of lightning to the target's sides which quickly close in on them, rapidly dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} on contact. This attack is affected by the [[Damage Sequence]].
|file_4      = Thunder Manifestation Walls of Lightning

|name_5      = Sundering Plumes
|desc_5      = Forms five sets of electric feathers, and releases them against the target, dealing '''28.8% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}. This attack is affected by the [[Damage Sequence]].

|name_6      = Dive Bomb
|desc_6      = Flies and repositions itself near the border of the arena, then it dives forward in a straight line twice, dealing '''83.3% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.

|name_7      = Torrential Descent
|desc_7      = Flies up and calls forth 3 waves of 3 lightning bolts to descend upon the target, striking in a line and dealing '''43.3% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
|file_7      = Thunder Manifestation Torrential Descent

|name_8      = Homing Thunder Cage
|desc_8      = Charges up and marks the target with a thunder circle for a short duration. The circle will then stop and activate, creating a spinning electric cage that homes in on the target, dealing '''27.7% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DoT}} if touched or inside of.
|file_8      = Thunder Manifestation Oscillating Prison
}}

==Strategy==
Similarly to the [[Electro Hypostasis]], the Thunder Manifestation is an entity of pure {{Electro}} energy and thus is immune to all Electro attacks. While the Thunder Manifestation is a flying target, it typically sticks low to the ground, allowing for melee units to hit it. However, it tends to teleport frequently and as such, {{Pyro}} or {{Cryo}} characters are recommended when fighting this boss, especially bow or catalyst users due to their ability to attack and/or home in from afar and the fight mostly requiring players to dodge its attacks when it becomes berserk.

Like [[Specters]], the Thunder Manifestation has a "Fury" buff which is initially empty. In its passive state, the Thunder Manifestation only unleashes lightning strike probes and occasional shockwaves that increase its fury if the player is caught in them. In the event of the lightning strike probes, simply walking out of their radius will cause its fury to deplete. The bar automatically fills if the player gets caught in one of the sporadic shockwaves or upon reaching 75% of its health if not enraged. In this state, the Thunder Manifestation uses more powerful attacks that deal massive damage if not dodged or shielded against. {{Geo}} characters can provide [[Crystallize]] to generate Electro shards, which can mitigate a reasonable amount of damage from its attacks.

Although it might appear similar to an [[Oceanid]], it does not possess her intelligence or memories.<br>That which drives the Thunder Manifestation is a much more primal fury.<br>It is said that these life forms will only descend like lightning upon places that play host to great lingering resentment, such as the fragmented Amakumo Peak, where the storm clouds ever roil. As long as the grudges of the land do not fade, so will the roaring thunder persist.|[[Archive]]}}
