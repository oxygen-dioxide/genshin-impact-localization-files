'''Mighty and Illuminated Wave Rider''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Wonders of the World]]''. To complete this achievement, the player needs to continuously sail their [[Waverider]] for a certain period of time.

==Notes==
*The achievement will only trigger upon leaving the Waverider and not pop up directly once the required time has been spent.

==Trivia==
* The name of the achievement in Chinese follows the pattern of a [[Adepti#Culture|sacred name]], thus giving the Waverider a sacred name as though it were an [[adeptus]].
** This is also the case for Japanese and Korean.{{Verify}}
* Similarly, the name of the achievement in English refers to the English localization of the longer honorific title that is used to refer to the adepti: the "mighty and illuminated adepti."<ref>{{Ref/CS|Xiao|Vision}}</ref><ref>HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/180703 Developer Insight #4: Character Stories (I) - "Vigilant Yaksha" Xiao (Part I)]</ref> "Waverider" was also split into "Wave Rider" to follow the same pattern as the sacred names of the adepti in the English localization.
* The name of this achievement in Spanish and Portuguese can also be said to follow the same pattern as the sacred names of the adepti in those localizations. (In the case of the Spanish name, it follows the variant seen in [[Skybracer]]'s name instead of the names of [[Cloud Retainer]], [[Mountain Shaper]], [[Moon Carver]], and [[Sea Gazer]].)
