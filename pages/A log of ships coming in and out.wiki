'''A log of ships coming in and out''' is a series of quest items that are obtained from [[Little Lulu]], [[Little Fei]], and [[Little Meng]] for the [[Commissions|commission]] ''[[One Ship, Two Ships, Three Ships]]''. These items are used to remind the player the number of boats each kid saw enter or leave the harbor so that the number of ships docked can be calculated.

The three children have different styles of handwriting, and their notes can read:
*'''A log of ships coming in and out by Little Lulu''' (elegantly-written)
**No ships came in or out of [[Liyue Harbor]] yesterday morning.
**1 ship came into Liyue Harbor yesterday morning.
**2 ships came into Liyue Harbor yesterday morning.
*'''A log of ships coming in and out by Little Fei''' (scribbled)
**1 ship sailed out of Liyue Harbor yesterday at noon.
**2 ships sailed into Liyue Harbor yesterday at noon.
**3 ships sailed into Liyue Harbor yesterday at noon.
*'''A log of ships coming in and out by Little Meng''' (neatly-written)
**No ships sailed in or out of Liyue Harbor last night.
**1 ship sailed out of Liyue Harbor last night.
**3 ships sailed into Liyue Harbor last night.
