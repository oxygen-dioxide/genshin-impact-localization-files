:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905306_beidou_01.ogg}} '''[[Beidou]]:''' It should be around here, right?
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905306_beidou_02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Hmm? Who are they...
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905306_beidou_03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Oh, it's a bunch of Treasure Hoarders... I guess the treasure's for real, then.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905306_beidou_04.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' (Traveler), there are quite a few of them. If things go south and fists start flying, stay behind me.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905306_beidou_05.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' I'm more than a match for these amateurs.

;(Stop the Treasure Hoarders who are currently digging)
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_01.ogg}} '''[[Golden Alligator]]:''' Keep digging, boys! Once we have our hands on the treasure, everyone gets a share!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' You can all hold it right there!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_02.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' Huh!? Who's that barking orders?
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_03.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' Do you know who you're up against here? Keep going if you've got a death wish...
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_04.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' What the...!? It's, it's...
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_05.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' C&mdash;C&mdash;Captain... B&mdash;B&mdash;B&mdash;Beidou!!!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_06.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' Run, boys! Run!!!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Nobody move!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_07.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' ...
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_08.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' Captain Beidou! Lord of the Ocean! This is all my fault, I didn't know who I was up against, I&mdash;I don't have a death wish, I swear...
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_09.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' I got a big mouth is all... It's always saying things it shouldn't. I swear I'll wash it out with soap the moment I get back...
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_10.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' Please, have mercy. Will you spare us?
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Hmph!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_11.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' ...
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_12.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' W&mdash;Well, spare them, at least... These guys are just trying to put food in their mouths. They'd never hurt a soul!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_13.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' If you need to take anyone, take me. Please, let them go!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_14.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' It was me that disrespected you... they never did, and never would!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_04.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Is that right?
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_05.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Fine. Seems like you've got a heart in there somewhere, seeing how you treat your crew... I'll let you off the hook this time.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_06.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Get outta here!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_15.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' Thank you, Captain Beidou! Thank you!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_07.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Wait!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_16.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' Yes? What else might the merciful and mighty Beidou require?
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_08.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' This treasure is still up for grabs. The Crux Fleet honors the rule of first-come, first-served.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_09.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' You found it first. So, name your price.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_10.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' I can't have any rumors going around about Captain Beidou stealing other people's treasure, can I?
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_17.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' Captain Beidou, we wouldn't dare take Mora from you!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_18.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' T&mdash;Take the treasure as an apology for my foolish words!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_19.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' Please, take it. Please.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_11.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Oh? Well, if you insist...
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_12.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' I accept your kind offer, and I'll make you one in return. You don't seem like terrible folks, so let me help you get onto the right track.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_13.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' If you want to mend your ways and put all this behind you, The Crux can probably arrange some odd jobs in the port for you.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_beidou_14.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' It'd be humble work, but at least it'd get you on your feet and making an honest living &mdash; a much better deal than what you've got going now, if you ask me.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905301_goldenalligator_20.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' Wow, uh... thank you, Captain Beidou! On behalf of me and all my boys.

===Were You Expecting Someone Else?===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Investigate suspicious locations nearby)
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Right, let's see what we've got in here...
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Tsk... This isn't what we're looking for.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Let's look around. Maybe we'll find it.
;(Approaching some rocks)
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Those rocks look... kinda weird.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Let's see if there's anything there...
;(Destroy the rocks)
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Nothing... Hmm, let's keep looking.
;(Approaching a group of hilichurls)
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' What are those hilichurls digging for?
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Wait, actually, I've heard they sometimes dig for buried treasure. Let's go take a closer look, (Traveler).

:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_04.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Nope, not here either.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_05.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Now that we've searched all the places of interest in this area, and come up with nothing... (Traveler), you got any ideas?
:{{DIcon}} What is the treasure you're looking for?
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_06.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' It's a...
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_01.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' Captain Beidou! Captain Beidou!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_07.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Huh? What brings you back here?
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_02.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' Captain Beidou! Actually, we've just been wandering around nearby... we didn't go far...
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_03.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' Because we were thinking about what you said, and...
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_04.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' Well... Me and the boys decided that... we're ready to move away from all of this and get on the straight and narrow!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_08.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Oh? Are you sure?
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_05.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' Yes! Absolutely sure!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_09.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Okay then. But I'll warn you right now that you won't have it easy. It might just be menial work in the port, but in the eyes of the general public, you'll be associates of The Crux.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_10.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' So there'll be a grueling test you have to go through before you can start.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_06.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' I understand! I understand!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_07.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' Truth be told, Captain, it's only because it's you, the mighty and honorable Captain Beidou. If it'd been anyone else, I don't think I'd have listened.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_08.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' And since you've made us this kind offer, I'd like to ask, if I might be so bold... is there any hope at all for us to become full members of The Crux in the future? Even the tiniest shred of hope?
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_11.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Hmph, well there's no place in The Crux for delusions of grandeur, that's for sure!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_12.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' But then again... everybody has to start somewhere.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_13.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' So it comes down to you. If you manage to impress me, and earn the respect of my crew...
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_14.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' ...then yeah. Nothing's impossible.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_09.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' Thank you, Captain Beidou! Thank you a thousand times over!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_10.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' I couldn't help but notice you were searching for something else. It still hasn't turned up?
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_15.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Why, do you have any clues?
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_11.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' We heard about two treasures, both in Guili Plains. We were still looking for the first one when you found us.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_12.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' So maybe the other one might be what you're looking for?
:{{DIcon}} Where is it?
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_13.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' Not too far from here, but I'm just not sure of the exact location...
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_14.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' All the info we got about this treasure came from the black market. The answer's hidden inside a poem, which goes like this:
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_15.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' {{Color|buzzword|"Drunkenly I gazed at the ruins long forsaken, and lay beneath red leaves whose branches cast a crooked shade. The dusk sun shone upon the sea as I awakened, but Guyun stood twixt weary eyes and the sight of home they crave."}}
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_16.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' As for the "ruins long forsaken" part, I do know of some ruins near here.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_17.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' But beyond that line... I just... I don't...
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_18.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' <nowiki>*sigh*</nowiki> I'm just not smart enough!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_16.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Haha, so a treasure clue hidden in a poem, huh? Don't worry, we got this.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_17a.ogg}} {{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_17b.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' See my friend here? If they taught treasure hunting as an art form, you'd probably be calling {{MC|him|her|mc=1}} "Grandmaster." This kind of thing's a piece of cake for {{MC|him|her|mc=1}}.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_18.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Am I right, (Traveler)?
:{{DIcon}} Ahem... let's maybe head to the site first?
:{{DIcon}} Ahem... I have no interest in being a grandmaster of anything.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_beidou_19.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Haha, okay then, let's start by heading to the site and surveying the scene. Maybe we'll find some other clues over there.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905302_goldenalligator_19.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' O&mdash;Okay! Come on, boys! You heard the captain &mdash; lead the way!
{{Dialogue end}}

===Poetic Treasure===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Go to the "ruins long forsaken")
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905305_goldenalligator_01.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' These are the "long forsaken ruins" from the poem. Apparently, they were once full of treasure.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905305_goldenalligator_02.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' But judging by the state of them now, it's probably long gone.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905305_beidou_01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Hmm, it seems that we need to dig deeper into this poem.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905305_beidou_02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' "Drunkenly I gazed at the ruins long forsaken, and lay beneath red leaves whose branches cast a crooked shade. The dusk sun shone upon the sea as I awakened, but Guyun stood twixt weary eyes and the sight of home they crave."
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905305_beidou_03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' (Traveler), do you have any ideas?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe "gazed at the ruins" means the writer wasn't right here, but...
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905305_beidou_04.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' ...Ah, somewhere you can see the ruins from? So, somewhere not too far from here?
:{{DIcon}} The second line means there's probably a red-leaved tree around...
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905305_beidou_05.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Yeah... and maybe the shadow cast by the tree is supposed to hint at something?
:{{DIcon}} The third line... perhaps the "dusk sun" has something to do with the timing?
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905305_goldenalligator_03.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' Oh! I got it! This guy fell asleep and woke up just before sunset!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905305_beidou_06.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Dusk and the shadow of a red-leaved tree... hmm, I think we can work with that.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905305_beidou_07.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Let's take a look around, (Traveler). I think we're getting close.
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|You analyzed the clues given in the poem... "Drunkenly I gazed at the ruins long forsaken" may mean to gaze upon a ruin from afar, while the key sections of "and lay beneath red leaves whose branches cast a crooked shade" are "a tree with red leaves" and "shadows." "The dusk sun shone upon the sea as I awakened" on the other hand could refer to time...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Follow the clues in the poem to look for the treasure)
<!-- Go to the north-eastern part of the highlighted circle. On the hill, next to a yellow-leaved tree jutting out of it, there is a buried chest. -->
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_04.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Found it! At long last, the treasure is finally in our hands... A check from the [[Northland Bank]].
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_05.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' You really came through, (Traveler). We found the spot in no time.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_06.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Without your help, I don't think I ever would have gotten my hands on it.
:{{DIcon}} I was expecting it to be something a little more unique.
::{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_07.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' To us, this is just a check that you can exchange at Northland Bank for some Mora.
::{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_08.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' But to some people, it's of huge importance.
:{{DIcon}} Is it worth a lot of Mora?
::{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_09.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Not much, but enough for an average person to survive on for a while. But there's more to this particular check than that.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_10.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' When I found the treasure map, it was tightly sealed inside a small bottle along with a letter.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_11.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' I'll let you read it for yourself.
{{Dialogue end}}

:;Neatly-Written Note
::If you find this bottle, I may no longer be in this world.
::I originally thought that these pirates, having their ways and means, might be able to send me back to Liyue, which was why I got onboard their ship. I never expected that...
::Ah, forget it. I suppose this is what they call destiny...
::Before I came to Inazuma, I worried that my old mother's place would be burgled, as she lives alone, so I left a check for all the Mora I've saved over these past few years buried in the location marked out on this map. Please help me retrieve that check and exchange it at the Northland Bank. The Mora will then be yours to do with as you please, save for a small portion that I would like used to pay my mother's living expenses. Her name is Minamoto Kotomi, and she lives in the Guili Plains. Please do this for me, and thank you!

::I'm sorry, Mother. I found loads of those Sakura Blooms that could be found all over your homeland, but it's a shame that I cannot send them to your side.

:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_12.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Finished?
:{{DIcon}} So, it's the dying wish of a man who met a tragic fate.
:{{DIcon}} So, it's the last will of a faithful son.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_13.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Yeah. I can't fault him for what he did, but the way things turned out... All I can say is, life is unpredictable.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905303_beidou_14.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Well, let's fulfill his final wish by taking this check to where it belongs.

;(Go to the wooden house by the sea)
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Well, this is it. Oh, boys! It's time for your first job!
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_04.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Give this check to the old lady who lives in that wooden hut. Tell her it's a welfare payment from the Liyue Ministry of Civil Affairs.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905304_goldenalligator_01.ogg}} '''Golden Alligator:''' Yes, Boss!
:{{DIcon}} Ahem...
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_05.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' What's up?
:{{DIcon}} I have some Sakura Blooms that I picked up in Inazuma. I want her to have them, too.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_06.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Haha, I see...
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_07.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' But you only find Sakura Blooms in certain places, right? It must have been quite a bit of work collecting all these, surely?
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_08.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Let's just pick one, huh? One's enough to show that you care.
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_09.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' You've already helped me out so much today.

:'''You take out a Sakura Bloom.'''

:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_10.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Okay! Off you go, then. Take her the Sakura Bloom along with the check, and if she asks, tell her...
:{{A|vo_bdcop001_1905304_beidou_11.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' ...your child in a faraway land sends his best wishes.
