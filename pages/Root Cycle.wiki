|description  = One of the keys designed by the [[Narzissenkreuz Ordo]] for the tower. When combined, the keys form a peculiar shape of three and a half circles, for which there is a special explanation.<br><br>
'''Part A:'''<br>The innermost circle is the Cycle of [[Hyperborea]], symbolizing the age when the world was frozen and the lost paradise.<br><br>
'''Part B:'''<br>The middle circle is the Cycle of [[Natlantea]], symbolizing the triumph over the evil dragon, a metaphor for humanity's victory over nature as well as the beasts within themselves.<br><br>
'''Part C:'''<br>The third circle and outermost half circle are the Cycles of [[Remuria]] and [[Khaenri'ah|Khraun-Arya]], symbolizing the relationship between humans and gods.
