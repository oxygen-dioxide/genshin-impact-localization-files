==Description==
The [[Mother Flamegranate Tree|great mother tree]] rooted in the cracks and crevices that today grows beneath [[Coatepec Mountain]] once grew elsewhere,<br><!--
-->According to what the storytellers say, it was in foothills that were higher even than the volcano, towering above even the clouds.<br><!--
-->There was once [[Burkina|a young courier]] who was royally peeved at [[Kongamato|a Saurian]] who lived on the mountain's other end, for the latter often mocked his movements as foolish,<br><!--
-->And so he swore that he would go to the highest peak to harvest the Flamegranates growing on the mother tree,<br><!--
-->To show off his great skill to the one most agile, even amongst all [[Yumkasaur]]s.<br><br><!--
-->But there is no great deed in this world that can be done simply by thinking about it,<br><!--
-->And though the hero named Burkina could scale the peaks with his bare hands, gripping the rock with naught but his fingertips,<br><!--
-->He could not stop the [[Qucusaur|winged Saurians]] circling the summit from harassing him, as though ridiculing him with their wings,<br><!--
-->And less still could he do about the many wild beasts standing guard beneath the tree, craning upward as they waited for the fruit to mature.<br><!--
-->As the season for the fruit to ripen approached, Burkina could not even get close to the tips of the fruit-laden branches,<br><!--
-->But the young hero was in no rush, and simply turned and left after murmuring something under his breath.<br><br><!--
-->He came to [[Flower-Feather Clan|the tribe that lived with the winged Saurians]], and took care of the Saurians' daily needs for them,<br><!--
-->Observing them day after day, and in doing so, familiarizing himself with their limbs and movements.<br><!--
-->He followed [[Children of Echoes|the people of the mountain]] below the volcano, using great boulders to hone his body and soul,<br><!--
-->And sought guidance from the [[Masters of the Night-Wind|High Priests of the Night-Wind]] with their ponderous ceremonies, heightening his perception and consciousness.<br><br><!--
-->When [[Tenoch]], who was traveling there, saw his friend and his frazzled hair, he was almost afraid to ask,<br><!--
-->But when Tenoch learned of his purpose, he could not hide his smile and asked to accompany Burkina.<br><!--
-->The hero of the [[Scions of the Canopy]] rejected his friend's warm-hearted offer, for he knew that all this was training,<br><!--
-->The rightful "cost" of such "results," while the kindness of his friend, perhaps,<br><!--
-->Might not be entirely free, as he had a vague feeling that the day would come when such help must be repaid.<br><!--
-->Seeing his friend's determination, Tenoch spoke no more of helping,<br><!--
-->But said only that he could still do a small favor for the sake of this adventure...<br><br><!--
-->On the day of ripening, the young courier took up the weapon he had made alongside his friend,<br><!--
-->And his nimble figure cut across the cliff, quicker even than a sprint over the open plains.<br><!--
-->He had long since seen through the ways the winged Saurians harassed him, and instead, it was they who lost their composure,<br><!--
-->While he waved the hooked sword in his hand to dodge or block the attacks of the beasts meant to intercept him.<br><!--
-->With the newly-matured Flamegranates of the mother tree before him, he needed only swing the hook in his hand to harvest them,<br><!--
-->But just as the hero was on the cusp of success, his pride made him complacent, and a sudden gust staggered him,<br><!--
-->It seemed he was about to fall from such a height, and he feared he would be smashed into a fleshy pulp along with the fruit in his arms...<br><br><!--
-->But with his life hanging by the barest of threads, a green figure emerged from the deep shade of the trees,<br><!--
-->And it shot out the pectin in its cheeks with its long tongue, bringing the hero back from death's precipice.<br><!--
-->It was none other than the Yumkasaurus that had always tussled with Burkina, and which followed him from the shadows,<br><!--
-->Finally showing itself when danger was truly at hand, rescuing him from the summons of the [[Lord of the Night]].<br><br><!--
-->Burkina offered the Flamegranates to the Saurian that saved him, earning its acknowledgment in return.<br><!--
-->This, then, is the story of how the Turnfire hero and The Mountain King Kongamato became companions.<br><!--
-->Later, the heroes of the Scions of the Canopy together transplanted the mother tree to the foot of the mountain,<br><!--
-->In commemoration, from then on, the best Flamegranates were crowned also with the name "Mountain Kings."
