|text    = Since I'm writing to you, perhaps I should dispense with the pleasantries and cut to the chase: I'd like to invite you to my birthday party.

Although [[Ayato]] and [[Ayaka]] both suggested going out to eat, saying I should take it easy today, but I believe having fun is more important than anything.

You can understand that, right? Chatting with friends in a warm home, enjoying the smile on your face when you savor the food...

I know my birthday wishes sound pretty plain, don't laugh at me, alright!

This time, I'm going to make a [[Mondstadt]] dish. Hmm, I haven't made it in a while, I wonder if I'll be able to do it. After you've tried it, I'd like to ask you to give me suggestions on how I could improve it.
