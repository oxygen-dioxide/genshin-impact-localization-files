==Description==
In the era when the desert king ruled the [[Great Red Sand|lands]], authority covered the realm like sunlight over the rolling dunes.<br>
The surviving songs of the nomads are like the chirping of desert insects, forever singing of the glory of that forgotten golden age.<br>
The red lord, they say, once contended against the bright sun, and ultimately fell to the earth like a meteorite.<br>
There are those amongst the priests, they say, who were not slain by the kings and princes who followed, who pass down [[King Deshret]]'s art of archery...

The descendants of the priests call themselves the "Heirs of the Burning Sun," and practice the ceremonies of King Deshret's kingdom from days past without ceasing.<br>
Even the travelling merchants and their information networks know precious little about these mysterious cabals.<br>
Few among the gilded descendants of the desert have the right to inherit the legacy of King Deshret's priests, and few can still read the ancient texts,<br>
Much less the graceful combat arts that the ancient priests had mastered: cudgel, spear, and that of which they were most proud, archery.

[[The Eremites]] name these people "ascetics," and some have now turned their loyalty to the [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|only surviving God King of Sumeru]].<br>
But most disappeared into the boundless desert, hiding among the snakes, scorpions, and specters of the ancient kingdom.<br>
Those loyal to the [[Dharma Forest|rainforest]] retain the customs of being hidden and silent, using their strength to repay the ancient favor,<br>
Yet in their heart of hearts, they deeply mourn their ancestors and His Majesty, King Deshret, who met with [[Forbidden Knowledge|disaster]] millennia before.

In this way, the elegant and ancient art and ceremony of archery has been passed down till today by the descendants of the priests.<br>
Though the meaning of many ancient texts and pictures have long been lost or have succumbed to error,<br>
And though the mighty figure of the red lord nocking an arrow to his bow has become only a shattered dream of the distant past...<br>
The fragile embers of that ancient nation have not yet been extinguished, but have become an even more deeply concealed element,<br>
Passing on their inherited knowledge of the ancient days, protecting civilization today.

And among those "ascetics" who disappeared into the desert, some strayed from the path of the priest.<br>
They became obsessed with fleeting mirages of authority, attempting to meddle with and mold the nomadic tribes.<br>
Using the strict ceremonies of the ancient past, they trained lost children as "Falcons."<br>
The advanced techniques honed from generation to generation to cultivate noble warriors have today taken a decidedly different path.<br>
To assist in the birth of a new "king," they trained completely mindless Falcons and dogs...<br>
But that is another tale for another time, for those with great ambition often disappear into the vast desert,<br>
Without a sound, like bitter tears falling into the infinite and endless ocean.
