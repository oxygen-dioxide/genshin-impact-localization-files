'''Karma-Heavy Cavern''' is a [[Quest Domain]] during {{Quest|The Purging of Evil}}.

Due to the nature of this domain, Xiao's Elemental Burst is permanently active, constantly draining a percentage of his health (down to 1 HP). Attacking enemies will regenerate health.

There are 3 chests that can be found in this domain:
* Exquisite Chest ×2 (unlocked after completing the first and second platforms, respectively)
* Precious Chest ×1 (after completing the domain)
