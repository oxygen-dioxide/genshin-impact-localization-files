|A Trainee Forest Ranger who is under the tutelage of Tighnari. She started her academic career a little later than her peers, so she is currently working hard to catch up.<br />She hides the other side of her personality deep under the surface of optimism and kindness.

==History==
Collei was born sickly, so her worried parents brought her to a [[Barnabas|seer]] and begged him to save her. He explained the illness as being "touched by the deev" &mdash; supernatural creatures with negative properties &mdash; and claimed that had to give their daughter to him in order to save her. However, he was working with the Fatui [[Harbinger]] [[Il Dottore]] and instead of saving her, turned Collei into a test subject for their Archon Residue experiments.

Whether the Fatui had let Collei go or if she had escaped herself is unknown, but she eventually found herself wandering alone. On account of her sickliness, she was treated poorly wherever she went; she was often abused by passing pedestrians, had stones thrown at, and pushed around. This fueled her hatred for people and gods, and a strong desire for vengeance.

The disease Collei is afflicted with is called [[Eleazar]]. Unique to Sumeru, this is a disorder that causes dark and hardened scales to form on the body. First symptoms are mild numbness on the affected areas of the skin, but as the disease progresses symptoms of general fatigue and peripheral paresthesia (abnormal sensation of the skin on the limbs) may occur. The final stage of this disease causes complete paralysis of the afflicted person, rendering them completely immobile. These symptoms hint that Eleazar might be a neurological disease. This condition is what causes Collei to be perceived as "clumsy" by other people, as it affects her ability to hold or carry objects, often dropping them to the ground. According to [[Tighnari]], there is no cure for Eleazar, only preventive care may be provided to stop the disease from advancing to a more serious stage. In the days Collei spent with the Fatui, Dottore was able to keep the disease controlled by unknown methods.

Upon the removal of [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]]'s consciousness from [[Irminsul]], Collei and the other Eleazar patients have recovered.

==Personality==

|A trainee ranger active in Avidya Forest. Behind her enthusiastic words and actions hides a slightly introverted personality.
|3=In-game character attributes and profile page text
}}
When Collei first arrives in [[Mondstadt]], due to her past experiences, she is extremely wary and suspicious of people, preferring to be left alone and making her seem cold. Her pessimistic view of the world comes from the mistreatment and abuse she endured everywhere. She also has a rather low opinion of herself, pushing people away because she is "unclean" and says she is unworthy of their time.

She was initially annoyed by [[Amber]] because of her cheerful and optimistic personality, but Amber shows her kindness by offering to help her find that something she lost, even insisting they are friends and protecting her from [[Kaeya]]'s intimidation multiple times. The two continue to grow closer during the course of the [[manga]] and Collei begins to trust Amber, becoming less wary of people as her view of the world becomes brighter.

When Amber protected Collei from Barnabas, Collei was touched by Amber's resolve and realizes that she too wishes to be able to protect others.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|15}}</ref> After having her powers sealed by [[Cyno]], she decides to leave with him to Sumeru in hopes of learning more about the world.

By the time she meets the [[Traveler]], Collei is shown to have matured whilst training under Tighnari and is now considerably more positive. She expresses great admiration for Amber, whose compassion deeply moved Collei to the degree that it influenced her behavior and hobbies. Inspired by Amber's benevolence, Collei tries to be very helpful and proactive in her [[Forest Rangers|Forest Ranger]] duties and strives to be as friendly as possible to everyone. Although she still has struggles with her literacy and Eleazar, she attempts to discard her past pessimism in favor of pushing forward and doing the best she can regardless.

She also developed a deep sense of empathy, extending even to the gods, whom she used to deem forsaken by, she now wonders if they too can feel just as helpless. She states that looking back, her extended hatred towards the world outside the Fatui was "childish." She also expresses guilt over her time in Mondstadt and is interested in apologizing.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Collei|About Kaeya}}</ref>

Despite her improved outlook, it is clear that Collei has yet to fully put her trauma behind her. Whilst no longer being bitter about it, Collei still finds it very difficult to open up to others about her past and avoids the subject when possible, as it brings back painful memories. Her introverted nature also leads her to occasionally spend time alone in a tree hollow, where she writes about any troubles or frustrations she may feel.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Collei|2}}</ref>

Collei is somewhat of a bad liar, only being able to convince Amber on why she wanted to know about the Fatui's research. She is also prone to panic attacks and breakdowns, and especially hates being pushed or shoved around. Even just trying to touch her might cause extreme fear and discomfort, as shown when Paimon tried to playfully touch her the day they met for the first time in Sumeru. This shock apparently triggered a flare-up of her disease, causing her to be bedridden the next day.

==Appearance==

<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3-4 sentences. Outfits should be described on the outfit pages. -->
Collei uses the [[:Category:Medium Female Characters|medium female]] model. She has short, wavy light green hair that reaches her shoulders and purple, almost magenta eyes.

===Manga===
Collei's hair in the manga was chin-length.

When she first appeared, much of her body and face were covered in bandages. She wore baggy trousers, one that resembles a {{w|sirwal}}, and a tapper hat made from bandages. Tied around her hips is a green-orange cloth. Later, Amber loaned one of her old outfits to Collei to attend Ludi Harpastum in<!-- ; this outfit was... pls describe -->. Collei also wore a beige satchel, in which she store the collected Fatui devices.

In Chapter 16, she appeared with a plain black shirt and a simple pair of shorts under a hooded cloak. She also wore an {{w|ushanka}} hat, a pair of gloves, and boots that reach up to below her knees. Lastly, she uses the same green-orange cloth and beige satchel from earlier.

}}

A trainee ranger active in [[Avidya Forest]]. Positive and optimistic, enthusiastic and kind.

Collei is from Sumeru, but few people know about her experiences before she came to [[Gandharva Ville]], and she herself never mentions anything about her past.

Perhaps because of Collei's pure gaze and earnest attitude, people saw her reserved demeanor as just part of her personality and did not shy away from her because of it.

The children of Gandharva Ville love to watch her sew dolls, and those who find themselves lost in Avidya Forest are willing to follow her back to safety.

Since her return to Sumeru, Collei has earned the trust and respect of the people with her actions.

But at night, when everything is dark, she sometimes thinks about those memories that she has buried away.

Even though everything is going well, she still hopes that she can work even harder and improve faster in the future.

&mdash;Only in this way can she overcome her past weak self as quickly as possible.

|text2         = <p>If words are the vehicles of wisdom, being literate is undoubtedly the starting point of the pursuit of knowledge. Collei, however, seems to have only barely reached the foot of the mountain of knowledge.</p><!--
              --><p>When she first arrived in Gandharva Ville, even the outspoken Tighnari showed obvious hesitation, making repeated inquiries with the [[Cyno|General Mahamatra]] if she had walked through the wrong door, since he had yet to make any plans to teach preschool level courses.</p><!--
              --><p>Still, after several twists and turns, Collei did finally become a trainee. To facilitate her learning of words, Tighnari gathered a wide assortment of books and documents, in the hope that Collei would soon master enough words through extensive reading.</p><!--
              --><p>Apart from the literacy encyclopedias for children and the mandatory-reading academic papers that made her head swell, Collei can most often be found reading fairy tale picture books from Mondstadt.</p><!--
              --><p>The logic is simple: those books tend to have fewer words and more pictures. Even if you do not know the words, chances are that you can still guess their meaning by looking at the illustrations.</p><!--
              --><p>However, reading only children's books hardly sufficed to keep up with her curriculum. Once she had picked up slightly more words, she immediately started to look for new extracurricular reading materials.</p><!--
              --><p>According to some travelers who had passed through Avidya Forest, there was a type of book in Inazuma known as the "light novel," which was easier to read than academic papers, and with fewer illustrations than picture books. To Collei, that sounded like the exact type of book she needed.</p><!--
              --><p>More importantly, the plots of these "light novels" were often so incredibly riveting that as soon as they got a copy, many readers just had to finish reading it in one go, even if they had to stay up all night.</p><!--
              --><p>That definitely sounded tempting to Collei, since she had to force herself, more often than not, to stay awake long enough to finish her readings.</p><!--
              --><p>One day after her forest patrol, Collei excitedly ran back to her dormitory with the newest volume of "[[Onibudou]]." She was so ready to pull an all-nighter reading the light novel &mdash; and as it turned out, she indeed stayed awake that night.</p><!--
              --><p>"My sealed power!" "The lonesome avenger!" "You'd be wise to stay away from me!" "I shall never witness the grace of the gods!"...</p><!--
              --><p>&mdash;Covering her head with the quilt, Collei tossed and turned upon her mattress the entire night. Even as the dawn broke, she had not yet torn her mind away from these words.</p>

              --><p>A few days later, Tighnari checked on Collei's recent forest patrol routes, which she had been taking all too frequently, before looking at her test papers, which featured remarkably higher scores. He could not help but think to himself:</p><!--
              --><p>"Did she find a way to improve her grades in the forest? Well, that's not bad either way. Alright, I'll save that patrol route for her and leave her be for the time being. I'll have other Rangers take the other routes."</p>

              --><p>She did not get far, the beast's howls outpacing her fleeing steps like a raging wind. The beast's pure predatory instinct caused it to overlook the shivering Collei, who was barely hanging onto the cliff.</p><!--

===Manga===
Collei is a major character in the [[manga]], which takes place roughly a year or less before the Traveler's arrival in Mondstadt.

In search of both a cure for her illness and means of revenge, Collei travels to Mondstadt. Unable to gain entry normally, she initiates the Black Fire Incident as a distraction to slip in to Mondstadt.

[[Amber]] finds Collei and befriends her despite Collei's warnings. Amber does her best to help Collei with her search while also investigating the Black Fire Incident, during which Amber discovers the metal birds planted by the Fatui and disables them with Collei before they can cause any harm. Amber also takes Collei to [[Ludi Harpastum]] festivities and shows Collei that people lead happy lives in Mondstadt.

Kaeya discovers that Collei is the culprit behind the Black Fire Incident and sets out to kill Collei but is stopped by Collei's acceptance of her death as well as the timely arrival of Amber.

Amber resolves to help Collei even after learning that Collei is the culprit behind the Black Fire Incident. Amber stands guard while Cyno seals away Collei's archon residue.<ref group="Note">Due to localization adjustments made since the manga's release, this term is no longer accurate. The original term in Chinese refers to gods that predate the rise of [[The Seven]].</ref> Afterward, Amber faces [[Barnabas]] alone to protect Collei and eventually brings him down with the help of [[Diluc]], who is also posing as the perpetrator of the Black Fire Incident. Kaeya "arrests" Diluc and hands him over to the Fatui to close the case, absolving Collei of the Black Fire Incident.

Afterward, Collei writes a letter to Amber with Lisa's help, thanking Amber and saying she left for Sumeru with Cyno.

==Trivia==
* Collei ate [[Fried Radish Balls]] offered by Amber during Ludi Harpastum in Chapter 9 of the manga, [[Ludi Harpastum (Manga)|Ludi Harpastum]]. She ended up liking them a lot, as seen in her [[Collei/Voice-Overs#Favorite Food|"Favorite Food" voice-over]].
* Barnabas tells Collei's parents that she's been touched by the deev. A {{w|Daeva|deev}} ({{lang|mini=1|fa=دیو|fa_rm=dêv}}), meaning "satanic giant" in Persian, is a particular sort of supernatural entity with disagreeable characteristics.
* There are hints she is claustrophobic.
* Due to the Archon Residue feeding on Collei's negative emotions, when she encounters such a negative emotion, the Archon Residue lets Collei have a vision of what would happen if she had control over the Archon Residue and was filled with hate.
* On the Cat's Tail Message Board, [[Cat's Tail Message Board#About Collei...|one message]] left by a customer talks about a "strange girl" that was "wrapped in bandages," referring to Collei.
*In the Japanese version of the manga, Collei's name was previously translated as "Kona" ({{ja|コナ}}), though this has since been changed to reflect her current name, "Korei" ({{ja|コレイ}}).
