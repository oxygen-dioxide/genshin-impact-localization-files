==History==
Collei was born sickly. Her worried parents brought her to the seer [[Barnabas]] and begged him to save her. He explains to them that she had been touched by a deev, a supernatural creature. He then tells them they must give their daughter to him in order to save her. However, Barnabas was working with the Fatui &mdash; [[Harbinger]] [[Il Dottore]] in particular &mdash; and instead of saving her, turned Collei into a test subject for their Archon Residue experiments.

Whether the Fatui had let Collei go or if she had escaped herself is unknown, but she eventually found herself wandering alone. On account of her sickliness, she was treated poorly wherever she went; she was often abused by passing pedestrians, had stones thrown at, and pushed around. This fueled her hatred for people and gods, and a strong desire for vengeance.

==Personality==
Due to her past experiences, she is extremely wary and suspicious of people, preferring to be left alone and making her seem cold. Her pessimistic view of the world comes from the mistreatment and abuse she endured everywhere. She also has a rather low opinion of herself, pushing people away because she is "unclean" and says she is unworthy of their time.

She was initially annoyed by [[Amber]] because of her cheerful and optimistic personality, but Amber shows her kindness by offering to help her find that something she lost, even insisting they are friends and protecting her from [[Kaeya]]'s intimidation multiple times. The two continue to grow closer during the course of the [[manga]] and Collei begins to trust Amber, becoming less wary of people as her view of the world becomes brighter.

Collei is somewhat of a bad liar, only being able to convince Amber on why she wants to know about the Fatui's research. She is also prone to panic attacks and breakdowns, and especially hates being pushed or shoved around.

==Appearance==
Collei has short, wavy light green hair that reaches her neck and purple eyes that almost touch magenta. She is a bit shorter than Amber.

When she first appeared in the manga, much of her body and face were covered in bandages. She wore baggy trousers, one that resembles a {{w|sirwal}}, and a tapper hat made from bandages. Tied around her hips is a green-orange cloth. When she joins in investigating Fatui devices, Amber lends her one of her old clothes for Collei to wear. She also has a beige satchel for where they keep the collected devices.

In Chapter 16, she appears with a completely different look; she wears a plain black shirt, simple pair of shorts, and a hooded cloak worn on top. She also wears an {{w|ushanka}} hat, a pair of gloves and boots that reach up to below her knees. Lastly, she uses the same green-orange cloth and beige satchel from earlier.

In present day, Collei’s hair has grown out and now reaches until her shoulders and is styled with a large hairpin resembling a flower with a black ribbon. Collei also wears a singular earring with a large gem on her left ear. Her outfit now consists of a green shawl with gold tassels worn over a brown dress exposing her upper back with detached sleeves. Collei’s dress has a number of gold trinkets attached to it most notably around her wrists and on her chest, and wears a pair of dark gloves that cover only her palms and leave her fingers exposed. Around her waist is a belt where her Dendro Vision is pinned just above her skirt which has a dark undercoat. The back of her dress also has a small black ribbon. She also sports long golden brown stockings and black heeled boots with a fur trim, and a long yellow scarf with gold details.

{{Quote|Oh, you're going to [[Sumeru]]? Can you give my regards to Collei? Well... it's been so long, I wonder if her hair has grown out and if she's taller?|Amber}}

A trainee ranger active in [[Avidya Forest]]. Positive and optimistic, enthusiastic and kind.

Collei is from Sumeru, but few people know about her experiences before she came to [[Gandharva Ville]], and she herself never mentions anything about her past.

Perhaps because of Collei's pure gaze and earnest attitude, people saw her reserved demeanor as just part of her personality and did not shy away from her because of it.

The children of Gandharva Ville love to watch her sew dolls, and those who find themselves lost in Avidya Forest are willing to follow her back to safety.

Since her return to Sumeru, Collei has earned the trust and respect of the people with her actions.

But at night, when everything is dark, she sometimes thinks about those memories that she has buried away.

Even though everything is going well, she still hopes that she can work even harder and improve faster in the future.

&mdash;Only in this way can she overcome her past weak self as quickly as possible.

===Manga===
Collei is a major character in the [[manga]], which takes place roughly a year or less before the Traveler's arrival in Mondstadt.

In search of both a cure for her illness and means of revenge, Collei travels to Mondstadt. Unable to gain entry normally, she initiates the Black Fire Incident as a distraction to slip in to Mondstadt.

[[Amber]] finds Collei and befriends her despite Collei's warnings. Amber does her best to help Collei with her search while also investigating the Black Fire Incident, during which Amber discovers the metal birds planted by the Fatui and disables them with Collei before they can cause any harm. Amber also takes Collei to [[Ludi Harpastum]] festivities and shows Collei that people lead happy lives in Mondstadt.

Kaeya discovers that Collei is the culprit behind the Black Fire Incident and sets out to kill Collei but is stopped by Collei's acceptance of her death as well as the timely arrival of Amber.

Amber resolves to help Collei even after learning that Collei is the culprit behind the Black Fire Incident. Amber stands guard while Cyno seals away Collei's archon residue.<ref group="Note">Due to localization adjustments made since the manga's release, this term is no longer accurate. The original term in Chinese refers to gods that predate the rise of [[The Seven]].</ref> Afterward, Amber faces [[Barnabas]] alone to protect Collei and eventually brings him down with the help of [[Diluc]], who is also posing as the perpetrator of the Black Fire Incident. Kaeya "arrests" Diluc and hands him over to the Fatui to close the case, absolving Collei of the Black Fire Incident.

Afterward, Collei writes a letter to Amber with Lisa's help, thanking Amber and saying she left for Sumeru with Cyno.

==Trivia==
* Barnabas tells Collei's parents that she's been touched by the deev. A {{w|Daeva|deev}} (دیو), meaning satanic giant in Persian, is a particular sort of supernatural entity with disagreeable characteristics.
* There are hints she is claustrophobic.
* Due to the Archon Residue feeding on Collei's negative emotions, when she encounters such a negative emotion, the Archon Residue let Collei have a vision of what would happen if she had control over the Archon Residue and was filled with hate.
* On the Cat's Tail Message Board, [[Cat's Tail Message Board#About Collei...|one message]] left by a customer talks about a "strange girl" that was "wrapped in bandages," referring to Collei.
*In the Japanese version of the manga, Collei's name was previously translated as "Kona" (コナ), though this has since been changed to reflect her current name, "Korei" (コレイ).
