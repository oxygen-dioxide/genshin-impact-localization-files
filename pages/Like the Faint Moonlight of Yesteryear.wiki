{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Enter Hotel Debord)
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I came here several times with my father when I was little, but stopped eating here as often after growing up. I hope the food here will be to your tastes.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, don't worry, we haven't eaten at a hotel like this in a while. Hehe, Paimon's getting excited already!
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' In that case, I'll go order for us first. Please wait here a moment.
:;(The three sit before a table filled with food)
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oho, everything looks so good! People in Fontaine sure know how to enjoy life.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Why, of course. Go ahead, try whatever you like. If the food's good, I'll make a group reservation for the rest of [[Spina di Rosula]] next time.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And if it's not?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, ah... Then I'll still bring everyone, albeit with only one dish per table.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You uh, sure have your own way of doing things...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, we called this a farewell meal, but we could also treat it like a victory feast, right? We did just win that case, after all.
:{{DIcon}} It's certainly worth celebrating.
:{{DIcon}} It was a pleasure working with you.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Ooh, true, very true. In that case... Boss, we'll have another two dishes!
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh! Paimon didn't mean that you had to order even more food!
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hehe...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Speaking of cases, do you think that the mastermind behind the serial disappearances will get caught soon now that this all has happened?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' We've certainly taken a big step forward, but I feel that's about it. We know that there is an organization that means to dissolve these young women, but we still don't know what they are really after.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If it hadn't happened right in front of us, Paimon wouldn't have ever believed that a person could be dissolved like that...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Right? Yet it was because this was such a preposterous notion that the investigation could never really move forward before.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, if only that guy could've finished speaking... *sigh* We were so close to hearing who was behind it.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' In such investigations, even the smallest step can seem like a yawning chasm if the trail of clues is cut off.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' To be honest, I don't have high hopes for any follow-up that the authorities might conduct...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' It's not that I don't have faith in their ability, it's just that a different perspective is required in some matters.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' It's easy to guard against and deceive a single, narrow perspective. A shift in thinking is required at such times in order to produce a breakthrough.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Which is exactly why the Spina di Rosula exist.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 14.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Those highfalutin folk are not all-knowing. That's why we exist, to seep into the cracks where filth falls through, where their watch fails them. That's the kinds of problems we solve.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh. Seems Paimon thought things were simpler than they actually are...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 15.ogg}} '''Navia:''' *sigh* It's alright. Well, this was supposed to be a farewell meal, so I doubt you have further interest in this business, right?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 16.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Let's talk about something else. Like... what are your future plans?
:{{DIcon}} We wanted to ask the Hydro Archon for some information...
:{{DIcon}} But we haven't had much opportunity to do so.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's true. We didn't have a chance to speak to her after the trial ended. It didn't really seem like the right time or place to do it anyway...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 17.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I see. So your primary objective &mdash; which has been foiled so far &mdash; was to have a chat with the Hydro Archon.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 18.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I've heard that there's a long line of people waiting to meet Lady Furina. I suspect you'll be waiting for quite a while, considering that you missed your chance today.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, we've heard that she's super popular here in Fontaine, and that it'll be tough getting any of her time.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 19.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hmm, well... Would you consider some more... unique ways? Perhaps even methods of, let's say, questionable legality?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess that's Spina di Rosula's Boss for you... Chock-full of sketchy ideas. Well, what did you have in mind?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 20.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, one way would be to infiltrate a performance troupe at the opera house, only to abandon your act at the play's climax and ask to speak to her after the performance...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 21.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I'm sure Lady Furina would be eager to see the ending, and would agree in order to finish watching the play, don't you think?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, could you suggest something a little more... practical? This plan seems pretty hard to pull off. We'd have to go learn how to act, and acting's really hard!
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 22.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Alright, here's another...find a way to conceal yourselves under her bed. Then, wake her up in the dead of night and demand answers. Don't let her go back to sleep until she answers all your questions!
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 23.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I can personally testify that this one works. When I'm sleepy, I'll do anything as long as I can finally get some sleep!
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, that might work, but that's not really the problem. The problem is we don't want to get ourselves arrested.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 24.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Ah, valid point. I overlooked that part. I was just thinking about leveraging a person's desire for sleep.
:{{DIcon}} How can you overlook something like that!?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 25.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Alright, alright, no more joking around. Perhaps you could... oh I don't know, cut the line when she's on a break.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 26.ogg}} '''Navia:''' You did defeat her in court, clearing citizens of hers from false accusations &mdash; false accusations she had nearly upheld personally. I'd imagine that she feels quite ashamed about the whole thing...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You mean that if we catch her while she's on a break, she might be too embarrassed to refuse? That does make some sense.
:{{DIcon}} It's worth a try.
:{{DIcon}} Would someone with her personality really feel shame?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why don't we give it a try after this meal? Y'know, strike while the iron is hot and all...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 27.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Huh? Paimon, did you drink my [[Fonta]]?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Was this your drink?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ehehe, sorry about that. Paimon wasn't really paying attention, and the cup was right next to Paimon... Would you like to order another?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 28.ogg}} '''Navia:''' No, it's fine. We're just about done here.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright. Honestly, Paimon wouldn't recommend Fonta anyway. It tastes kinda salty and icky.
:{{DIcon}} I'd have to agree.
:{{DIcon}} My drink also tasted that way, too.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 29.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Is that so? Well, in that case, we'll have to blacklist the Fonta here, then.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 navia 30.ogg}} '''Navia:''' If we're all finished eating, then I'll go pay...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 1 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, we're stuffed. Thanks for the treat, Navia!
:;(Outside Hotel Debord, night has already fallen.)
:{{A|vo fdaq004 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, so... full... Paimon can barely float anymore...
:{{DIcon}} You could try walking, you know.
::{{A|vo fdaq004 2 paimon 02a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nah, that would be so... normal. Y'know, like you.
:{{DIcon}} You could try floating a little lower.
::{{A|vo fdaq004 2 paimon 02b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Can't you see Paimon's barely an inch off the ground?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 2 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hmm... Okay, as for expenses this month, we're left with...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey Navia, what are you doing over there?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 2 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Oh, nothing, nothing! It was just a meal, y'know. Nothin' the Spina di Rosula can't cover, haha... *sigh*
:{{DIcon}} (Seems that was pretty tough for her.)
:{{DIcon}} (That was a pretty pricey meal, all thanks to Paimon...)
:{{A|vo fdaq004 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's get ready to try to meet the Hydro Archon again. Bye, Navia!
:{{A|vo fdaq004 2 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' *sigh* So this is goodbye, huh. Well, if you do encounter any other trouble in Fontaine, you're always welcome to contact the Spina di Rosula &mdash; I'll give your request the highest priority.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 2 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' In any case, I wish you smooth sailing. I'll see you again, partner!
:{{A|vo fdaq004 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' See ya!
----
;(Approach the [[Fountain of Lucine]])
:;(It is still evening as the Traveler stops by the fountain to look around.)
:{{A|vo fdaq004 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There aren't many people around anymore. Looks like that boat we took to [[Erinnyes]] might have been the last one...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 3 vigneire 01.ogg}} '''???:''' "Vacher..."
:{{A|vo fdaq004 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, looks like we're back here again...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, {{Traveler}}? Are you hearing voices again?
:{{DIcon}} Yes...
:{{DIcon}} And it's clearer than it was during the day.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhhh... That's kinda spooky. Are you sure we don't wanna come back in the morning?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 3 vigneire 02.ogg}} '''???:''' "Vacher... Vacher..."
:{{A|vo fdaq004 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Why're you still walking towards it? There might be something nasty in the water...
:{{DIcon}} (I can feel... strong emotions...)
:{{DIcon}} (Things are... getting a little blurry...)
:{{A|vo fdaq004 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Hang on, Paimon can kinda hear a voice... It's calling for "Vacher," right?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, {{Traveler}}! Stop walking! C'mon, wake up!
:;(The Traveler finds themselves in a completely blue domain with what looks like an [[Oceanid]])
:{{A|vo fdaq004 4 vigneire 01.ogg}} '''Oceanid?:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} Where's this?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 4 vigneire 02.ogg}} '''Oceanid?:''' [[Vacher]]? Are you... my dear Vacher?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 4 vigneire 03.ogg}} '''Oceanid?:''' No, wait, you seem to be someone else... Do you know Vacher? Do you know where my love is?
:{{DIcon}} I'm afraid not...
:{{DIcon}} I'm sorry, who are you?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 4 vigneire 04.ogg}} '''Oceanid?:''' I'm... Wait, who am I...? I'm very sorry, I fear I do not know.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 4 vigneire 05.ogg}} '''Oceanid?:''' My memories feel like they have been washed away like a flood. So many fragments dissolved amidst the tide, never to be recovered.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 4 vigneire 06.ogg}} '''Oceanid?:''' How much have I lost? How many things that I once held dear while on land have I since forgotten?
:{{DIcon}} You were once...
:{{DIcon}} ...Human?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 4 vigneire 07.ogg}} '''Oceanid?:''' Yes, that is what I was once. But now, I am but the consciousness of one who has lost their form.
:{{DIcon}} You lost your form...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 4 vigneire 08.ogg}} '''Oceanid?:''' I do not know how I came to be like this either. I only vaguely remember being covered in light blue water, and then all grew dim...
:{{DIcon}} "Light blue water"... Could that have been...
:{{DIcon}} Could she be one of the girls who were dissolved?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 4 vigneire 09.ogg}} '''Oceanid?:''' Ah, I also remember going to many places. I loved adventure, loved exploring places of peril.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 4 vigneire 10.ogg}} '''Oceanid?:''' No matter where I went, Vacher would go with me. I knew how dearly he loved me, and I also loved him equally as much.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 4 vigneire 11.ogg}} '''Oceanid?:''' But now... We can no longer go back. The pain of such parting... I never knew how heavy it could be.
:{{DIcon}} So you need me to find him?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 4 vigneire 12.ogg}} '''Oceanid?:''' No! Our reunion no longer has any meaning &mdash; there is no way for us to create any new memories.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 4 vigneire 13.ogg}} '''Oceanid?:''' The thought of me gives him no succor, so let it lie forgotten beneath the waters.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 4 vigneire 14.ogg}} '''Oceanid?:''' If you meet Vacher, tell him not to look for me. Tell him to move on &mdash; that is the only thing I still remember.
:{{DIcon}} I believe it will be hard for him to forget you.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 4 vigneire 15.ogg}} '''Oceanid?:''' Perhaps that is so... As I was submerged in the waters, losing consciousness, I saw Vacher above the surface. His eyes were filled with such sorrow, such longing.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 4 vigneire 16.ogg}} '''Oceanid?:''' If only I could have comforted him, told him that I did not suffer. Indeed, I had felt a great warmth...
:{{DIcon}} That means...
:{{DIcon}} Vacher was a witness to the fact that you dissolved?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 4 vigneire 17.ogg}} '''Oceanid?:''' Is that what you call it? "Dissolving"? If anything, I consider it a form of "release."
:{{A|vo fdaq004 4 vigneire 18.ogg}} '''Oceanid?:''' It was a state of neither fear nor frenzy, with only an endless peace, like the water's still surface.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 4 vigneire 19.ogg}} '''Oceanid?:''' I could also liken it to being a thirsty person who drinks water for the first time, and only then sees how they have lived for so long in a world of endless want and anxiety.
:{{DIcon}} It seems that after the body is dissolved...
:{{DIcon}} Some measure of the consciousness still remains...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 4 vigneire 20.ogg}} '''Oceanid?:''' I think I hear your companion. It's time for you to go, I think.
:{{DIcon}} Is that Paimon...?
:{{DIcon}} Ah right, I wonder how much time has passed in reality...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 4 vigneire 21.ogg}} '''Oceanid?:''' Farewell, then. I am glad that you were able to sense my presence. Remember, if you see Vacher, tell him not to seek me out any longer.
;(A [[#Gallery|cinematic]] plays)
::'''Paimon:''' Wake up...
::'''Paimon:''' C'mon, hurry! Navia's outnumbered!
:;(The Traveler awakes to gunfire and explosions)
:;(Navia and her attendants are fighting an army of [[Gardemek]]s)
::'''Silver:''' Demoiselle, look out!
::'''Navia:''' Dear god... It's a whole army of Gardemeks...
:;(Navia notices a familiar figure behind the Gardemeks)
::'''Navia:''' [[Clorinde]]?
:;(Clorinde destroys one of the Gardemeks with a headslash, drawing the attention of the others)
::'''Navia:''' Quick, now's our chance!
:;(The two of them defeat all of the Gardemeks)
:;(Cinematic ends)
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I should thank you for lending us your sword there, Clorinde. But before I do so, could you explain how you managed to show up here?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I... followed you. It seemed to me that danger has followed you more closely as of late.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I believe that following someone without their knowledge is actually called "stalking," is it not?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Mr. [[Callas]]' last wish was for me to ensure your safety, and I will not betray his trust. He would do the same, were he alive today.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Do not... speak of my father.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 silver 01.ogg}} '''Silver:''' Sorry Demoiselle, I was not strong enough...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 marcillac 01.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Thank you for your aid, Ms. Clorinde, but do keep an eye out for your manner of speech. I believe we all wish to avoid unnecessary emotional harm.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Sorry. I... did not consider your feelings.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Whatever. What else do you know? How did you come to the conclusion that I'd be in grave danger?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I doubt I know much more than you, but I believe that the mastermind behind the serial disappearances is very powerful.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Your performance tonight will almost certainly attract their attention.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hehe, I'm sure they've known about me. To be honest, I'm shocked it's taken them this long to act against me.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And what about these Gardemeks? I thought only those associated with the [[Maison Gardiennage]] could control them.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 clorinde 06.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' None of these meka have serial numbers, I was sure to check a moment ago. They are not the ones used by the authorities to enforce the law.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 clorinde 07.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I can only conclude that some powerful or wealthy party must have obtained them via illegal means, deploying them as a private force of sorts.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' What, your point being that they're out of the Spina di Rosula's league then?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 clorinde 08.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Yes. Be careful, and do not act rashly.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I will continue investigating no matter what. We will bring the truth to light. That's... my father's true last wish.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Regardless, thank you for your help today, Clorinde. But if you get any ideas, tell me first. I don't much appreciate being followed.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 clorinde 09.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I do not think that they'll strike again any time soon, so I shall stop following you. Good day, all.
:;(Clorinde walks off towards the Opera Epiclese.)
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Right. I suppose that's the best news we've gotten today.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 marcillac 02.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Demoiselle, I believe that Ms. Clorinde was being sincere with you. If we tried, we could attempt to thaw relations a little...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' *sigh* I know. I just... She's...
:{{DIcon}} What just happened?
:{{DIcon}} Who was that?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thank goodness! Paimon thought we were done for!
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Those Gardemeks came outta nowhere while you were unconscious, and Navia and her gang saved us.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, and there was that [[Champion Duelist]] named Clorinde who came out to save us too. We got lucky there. Paimon probably couldn't have fought them off otherwise.
:{{DIcon}} Oh, so you're a fighter now, Paimon?
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for the rescue, Navia.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Oh, come now, forget all that polite talk. That wasn't really a farewell meal we had back there &mdash; not for me anyway. In truth, I hope that every meal we have together shall be a victory feast.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' As such, we're still partners. There's no need to thank me.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 silver 02.ogg}} '''Silver:''' It will take... fifty years for me to match Demoiselle's magnanimity.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 marcillac 03.ogg}} '''Melus:''' If it were me, I would have joined the Spina di Rosula on account of her goodwill long ago.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 14.ogg}} '''Navia:''' *sigh* Alright, you two, that's enough...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Actually, Navia, how did you know that we were in danger? You sure did show up in the nick of time!
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 15.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, to be honest, you're the one who tipped us off, Paimon.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, really? Paimon contributed somehow? Paimon's even more amazing than she thought!
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 16.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Yes, all thanks to you grabbing my drink by mistake.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... How did that help...?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 17.ogg}} '''Navia:''' After we parted ways, I was on the way back to one of our bases when I suddenly thought of what you said...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 18.ogg}} '''Navia:''' That the Fonta tasted "kinda salty and icky."
:{{DIcon}} Wait, do you mean that...
:{{DIcon}} I thought it tasted strange as well, but I couldn't be sure.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 19.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Fonta only comes in sweet flavors, so how could it have tasted salty? The color of the drink, if I recall, had also been a bit off...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So the Fonta had been spiked with Water from the [[Primordial Sea]]?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 20.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Yes. So, if you hadn't drunk that cup for me...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 marcillac 04.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Spina di Rosula is preparing the grandest of awards for you as we speak for saving the Boss.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, really!?
:{{DIcon}} Fortunately, Paimon, neither of us are from Fontaine...
:{{DIcon}} Otherwise, we would've been...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 21.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I sent people to Hotel Debord to investigate, but whoever did this left no trace at all.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 22.ogg}} '''Navia:''' That's when I figured out that you might be in danger, and hurried here as quickly as I could.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But why would they go after us too? All we did was defend Lyney in court and help clear his name. Ugh, now we're caught up in this mess too, aren't we?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 23.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, you did foil a plan that they were probably pretty proud of, and almost got their name in the process.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 24.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Speaking of which, did anything strange happen when you drank the Primordial Seawater?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 paimon 10a.ogg}} {{A|vo fdaq004 5 paimon 10b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, it can't be a coincidence that {{Traveler}} fainted just now. {{MC|m=He|f=She}} said that {{MC|m=he|f=she}} heard that voice calling for "Vacher" again...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, and this time Paimon heard it too, but it was real faint. Does this situation have to do with the Primordial Seawater, then?
:{{DIcon}} According to [[Lynette]]...
:{{DIcon}} The ability to hear voices like that has to do with one's sensitivity to the Hydro element.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Does that mean the Primordial Seawater raises someone's sensitivity to Hydro when it's used on people who are not from Fontaine?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 25.ogg}} '''Navia:''' That doesn't sound like too much of a bad thing, to be honest.
:{{DIcon}} I also gained some new intel.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' New intel? While you were out cold?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 26.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, let's hear it, shall we?
:{{DIcon}} The voice in the fountain belonged to one of the missing women.
:{{DIcon}} A person named "Vacher" was a witness when she dissolved.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 27.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Oh? That is important.
:{{Black Screen|You tell everyone about what happened while you were connected to the Oceanid's consciousness.}}
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 28.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Vacher... That name doesn't ring a bell. I suppose he hasn't stepped forward as a witness in court lately.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 29.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Since he saw that young woman dissolve, he was at least at the crime scene.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 30.ogg}} '''Navia:''' But he never gave testimony or any information regarding people dissolving in the Primordial Seawater. Could he have been threatened...?
:{{DIcon}} If he's still alive...
:{{DIcon}} We should try searching for him.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 31.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Yes, thank you. This is very important information indeed. We will continue to investigate.
:{{DIcon}} Alright, partner.
:{{DIcon}} By "we," you mean us too, right?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 32.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Oh!? You mean... You'll help us investigate?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, you did say that our farewell meal didn't really count. That means we're still partners, right?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And besides, we're in this now whether we like it or not. You're not gonna let these people who targeted us get off the hook so easily, are you, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} Messing with us will cost them.
:{{DIcon}} This will prove to be their biggest mistake.
:;(Camera pans over from Melus to Navia's beaming smile.)
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 marcillac 05.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Demoiselle, do try not to look quite so pleased. You are the face of Spina di Rosula, after all.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 33.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Ahem! You talk too much. Well, in that case, let's head back to one of our bases, shall we? I'll arrange accommodations for you.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 navia 34.ogg}} '''Navia:''' We also have some plans to go over, and hopefully we can deepen our bonds as partners... But we'll take that one step at a time, I guess.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 5 silver 03.ogg}} '''Silver:''' Don't worry, you two. With us around, our base is definitely secure.
----
;(Approach the stronghold)
:{{A|vo fdaq004 6 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' It's right up ahead, but... Let's make sure we weren't followed first.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 6 silver 01.ogg}} '''Silver:''' I've been keeping watch, Demoiselle. I haven't spotted anyone suspicious thus far.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 6 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Very good, but let's not let our guard down for now.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 6 marcillac 01.ogg}} '''Melus:''' I shall find rooms for our respected guests.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 6 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Thank you, Melus. Now, let's continue, {{Traveler}}.

;(Approach Melus)
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, uh, this is your base? It's not quite what Paimon imagined...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 marcillac 01.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Your accommodations have been arranged. Under the present circumstances, I can confidently say it's the best we have.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you...
:{{DIcon}} (Well, so much for my expectations.)
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Heh, well, our funds have been a little tight lately...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' After all, we don't allow illegal or unethical profiteering. In fact, our funds often come from the citizenry who support us.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seems like it's tough times for everyone... But if you have the support of the people, that does sound like it's worth it.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' To be honest, our financial situation was a lot better back when my father was in charge a few years ago. I'm afraid I'm not quite his equal...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Your father... He was the previous boss of Spina di Rosula, right? How did he...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 marcillac 02.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Demoiselle, if you'll allow me to explain...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' No, I'll explain it myself. I suppose I couldn't run from this topic forever, and as partners, this is something I hope they can understand.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' My father's name is Callas. Yes, the same one they call "Callas the Unfaithful" in the streets.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Three years ago, he was accused of murdering [[Jacques|his own friend]], but he chose a duel to defend his honor instead of standing trial. He died in the Duelists' Ring.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' But I do not believe my father was a murderer. I'm sure he was set up...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' At the time, I believed that if he only stood trial and was duly investigated, something amiss would crop up and prove his innocence.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' But strangely, he not only requested the duel himself, but rumor has it...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...That even after being seriously injured, to the point where he could be deemed as having lost the duel, he refused to surrender, determined to die in the arena.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Three years later, I still don't understand why he did that...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' How could he protect his honor if he's dead? If anything he gave up his chance to defend himself.
:{{DIcon}} It does seem quite odd.
:{{DIcon}} Do you have any clues as to why?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' The closest piece of info I have is that my father had been investigating the serial disappearances case at the time of his death.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, so that's why you're so determined to get to the bottom of that case!
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 14.ogg}} '''Navia:''' That's right. I've also tried to investigate the murder my father was implicated in, but I haven't found a single new clue in my countless reviews of the investigation records.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 15.ogg}} '''Navia:''' However, I believe that if the murder case is related to those behind the disappearances, they must know something.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 16.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I must know what really happened. Was my father coerced? Framed? Even if he really did kill his friend, I must get to the truth.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 17.ogg}} '''Navia:''' *sigh* If only he'd been more open with me when he was still alive.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 18.ogg}} '''Navia:''' He even hid the fact that [[Clementine|my mother]] died due to complications when giving birth to me...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 19.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And now here I am, investigating his death. You really are a handful, aren't you, Papa?
:{{DIcon}} Seeking the truth...
::{{DIcon}} You know, we're quite alike in this regard.
:{{DIcon}} For the sake of your family...
::{{DIcon}} You know, we're quite alike in this regard.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 silver 01.ogg}} '''Silver:''' Demoiselle, please... If there is anything I can do, anything at all...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 marcillac 03.ogg}} '''Melus:''' I also will never believe that Master Callas murdered anyone. There are none whom I respect more than the two of you, Demoiselle.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 marcillac 04.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Master Callas did so much good in life... yet all it took was one murder case for him to be dubbed Callas the Unfaithful...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 marcillac 05.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Even our supporters decreased greatly due to that incident, hence our strained finances at present.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait. If Callas was such a good man, wouldn't people at least be a little suspicious when he was accused?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 20.ogg}} '''Navia:''' No, perhaps people just revel in that kind of "drama." It's not something exclusive to people from Fontaine, really. Everyone's like that.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 21.ogg}} '''Navia:''' People love watching the evil turn over a new leaf, but they also enjoy watching good people fall into an abyss from one slip-up just as much.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But how could... Never mind. If Callas was really falsely accused, we have to find the truth. He didn't deserve to have that happen to him!
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 marcillac 06.ogg}} '''Melus:''' There is one other thing. Master Callas' opponent in the duel... was Ms. Clorinde.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh. Her? Well then, isn't that as good as saying that she was the one who killed him?
:{{DIcon}} No wonder the mood was a little strange between the two of you...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, that's not the sort of thing you can just let go and move on from...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 marcillac 07.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Ms. Clorinde has always placed great emphasis on the honorable nature of the duel. If her opponent doesn't yield, she will not stop, either.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 marcillac 08.ogg}} '''Melus:''' She knew Master Callas beforehand, and greatly respected him, but seeing how he was resolute in the arena...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 marcillac 09.ogg}} '''Melus:''' There was only ever one choice she could have made...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 22.ogg}} '''Navia:''' It's not that I don't understand her at all, but I... I just can't deal with this yet.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't worry, Navia! Paimon knows how you feel &mdash; you don't have to force yourself to do that.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 marcillac 10.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Afterward, Ms. Clorinde told us that at the start of the duel, Master Callas requested that she ensure Demoiselle Navia's safety.
:{{DIcon}} Then that indicates...
:{{DIcon}} That he intended to die in that duel.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 marcillac 11.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Yes, that is our understanding as well.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 23.ogg}} '''Navia:''' *sigh* Oh Papa, what madness drove you to ask the person who killed you to take care of me...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 24.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Alright, anyway... that's the information I wanted to share with you &mdash; even if it did sound like I was just complaining towards the end.
:{{DIcon}} No, it's alright.
:{{DIcon}} I understand how important this is to you.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 navia 25.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Thanks. You two should go and rest. This was quite a day, after all.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah. Paimon's beat...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 7 silver 02.ogg}} '''Silver:''' Please, relax and get some sleep. We will ensure you rest soundly.

;(Talk to [[Silver]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq004 silver 01.ogg}} '''Silver:''' Whether it be responsibility for Spina di Rosula or Master Callas' death, it all landed on Demoiselle's shoulders so suddenly...
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq004 silver 02.ogg}} '''Silver:''' This won't do. I must become stronger.

;(Rest at the room)
:{{Black Screen|A peaceful night passes under the Spina di Rosula's protection...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq004 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *yawn* Paimon slept so well! This place feels almost too safe...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Navia? Where did the other two go?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 8 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I sent them back to [[Poisson]], it's Spina di Rosula's place of origin and where we have our headquarters. There's not much for them to do here at the moment.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon gets the feeling that you're just trying to get them off your back...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But never mind that, when did you get back? Were you waiting here the whole time?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 8 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' No, I just returned after going out for a while. I did some investigating yesterday regarding the name "Vacher."
:{{A|vo fdaq004 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, so you didn't sleep at all!?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 8 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' How could I after having such critical new evidence appear?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, guess Paimon wasn't speaking for everyone just now, huh...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 8 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Unfortunately, this name seems to have been wiped from existence. It doesn't seem to have a match anywhere.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 8 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I suspect that those behind this have already taken steps to hinder an investigation from this angle &mdash; but that does prove that this Vacher person is a key witness in the incident.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Does that mean we're too late, though?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 8 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' No, there is one ray of hope, one place in Fontaine that they would find almost impossible to threaten, no matter how much they wanted to.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 8 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And that is the archives kept by Chief Justice [[Neuvillette]]. A place where detailed files on all the cases in recent years are kept.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 8 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' If the... Oceanid you met is one of the young women who went missing recently, we should be able to find some related information there.
:{{A|vo fdaq004 8 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So Neuvillette maintains an archive of case files? Guess that's the hardworking Chief Justice for you...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 8 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' In that case, let's go talk to him, shall we?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 8 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq004 8 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm? Aren't you coming along, Navia? Did you get tired?
:{{A|vo fdaq004 8 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' *sigh* No, it's nothing. Let's go see the honorable Chief Justice.
