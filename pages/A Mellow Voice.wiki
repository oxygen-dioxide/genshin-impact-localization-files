|description    = This is a two-stringed instrument that bears many of [[Sumeru]]'s unique characteristics. Built with a long neck and strong strings, this instrument is based on an ancient Sumeru stringed instrument, thus imbuing it with the weight of tradition and history. In [[Teyvat]], where music is ever-evolving in terms of both instruments and composition, design and style must also advance with the times and undergo iterating improvements. In the present day, this instrument can be played with either one's fingers or bowstrings.<br>Some players in Sumeru habitually equip this dark blue-framed instrument with twin strings made of metal, granting it a forceful timbre. This allows it to achieve a deeper and more solid sound as part of an ensemble.
