|description = [[Chiyo]], a warrior of the [[oni]] tribe with the Electro Mitsudomoe emblem emblazoned on her back, was once swallowed whole by a beast from beyond this world that had a tiger's body and a serpent's tail while holding back the forces of darkness. At last, she tore the creature's innards apart from within, breaking free.<br />This is the origin of the phrase "Chiyo the Tiger-Bite," and would be changed over many years to "Torachiyo."<br />But within the belly of the beast, she was stained by a deep sin and saw her comrades ripped to shreds by those blood-red teeth. Steeped in darkness as far as the eye could see, she would eventually draw her sword upon the Almighty [[Narukami Ogosho]]. Her sword-arm and one horn would be cloven, and she would flee from the city into the forest like a wounded beast. There, they say that she was taken for some unknown monster and slain by the [[tengu]], or perhaps by the [[Shuumatsuban]] &mdash; or perhaps by a scion of the [[Iwakura Clan]] training deep in the mountains, for her features had been twisted by hatred and the agony of her wounds. Or perhaps she even met the [[Maguu Kenki|oni-masked, sword-bearing doll]] near the corpse of the giant serpent, and there ended her life's journey.<br />Few among those who fought against the abyss in those days were spared pitch-dark dreams. Those who slew monsters and then became them were hardly the minority. The border between worlds grows fragile, and corruption of this kind is perhaps not merely monodirectional.
