===Elemental Monument Puzzle===
This puzzle is accessible from either layout of Minacious Isle. Activate the Elemental Monuments in the following order: {{Pyro}}, {{Anemo}}, {{Cryo}}, {{Hydro}} to reveal a [[Time Tunnel]]. (The order is hinted from reading the Aged Stone Tablet.) Activate the [[Windmill Mechanism]] or the {{Anemo}} Monument again to create a [[Wind Current]], and use it to glide up and enter the Time Tunnel.

The Time Tunnel will teleport the player to a high place in the sky where a [[Luxurious Chest]] and 3 [[Starlight Coalescence]]s can be found.
