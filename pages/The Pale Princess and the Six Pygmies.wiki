'''The Pale Princess and the Six Pygmies''' is a [[Book Collection]].
==Vol. 1==
{{Description|A fairytale story that has been told throughout Teyvat for ages. This is part one, which tells the story of the Land of Night and the Moonlight Forest.}}

In the distant past, the Night Mother ruled over the faraway Land of Night. Here, no light touched the earth, nor did a single tree grow, and there was no life here but the horrendous denizens of the dark.<br />
The Night Mother was the source of all sins, and the Land of Night was the embodiment of her evilness. The cruel Night Mother, who had neither heart nor mouth, was always watching the Land of Night, and her punishments were always unexpected. The only thing she could not bear was the occasional ray of moonlight that made it through the clouds. The light that penetrated the walls of darkness always irritated her.<br />
The Moonlight Forest was the only place free from the rule of the Night Mother. Only there could the people bask in the bright moonlight and enjoy the grace it brought to the living. Everyone in the Kingdom of the Moonlight Forest was born with fair skin, light-colored hair, and bright blue eyes. Perhaps the constant lack of sunlight and the nourishment of the moonlight was the reason for their beauty, giving them an appearance different from the abhorrent creatures lurking at the edge of the forest.

==Vol. 2==

==Trivia==
*Vol. 1 of this book series is one of the few books in Genshin Impact that the player is guaranteed to have after completion of a quest. Lisa lends Vol. 1 to the Traveler permanently, registering them as the book's custodian. It is possible that the cutscene (and the [[Lost Book|entire questline]]) highlights the importance of this book to the game's overall lore.
*During [[Lost Book]], the [[Abyss Mage]] [[Abyss Mages#Cryochanter Abyss Mage Emery|Emery]] mentions that the book contains "a secret," presumably important to the [[Abyss Order]].
