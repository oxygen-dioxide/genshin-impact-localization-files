{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the Fravashi Tree)
:'''Paimon:''' It's a Fravashi Tree. We can't just leave it be!

;(Talk to the Pari)
:'''Residual Pari of the Forest:''' Ah, finally, at long last... Bring me the stamens of that flower. You know what I'm talking about, right?
:'''Residual Pari of the Forest:''' I don't know how to face them if I return without any Udumbara. You're my only hope now!

;(Talk to the Pari again)
:'''Residual Pari of the Forest:''' Well, did you bring me the Udumbara Pistils?
:;(Open inventory submission screen)
;(After submitting the Udumbara)
:'''Residual Pari of the Forest:''' Hehe, finally! I extend my gratitude.
