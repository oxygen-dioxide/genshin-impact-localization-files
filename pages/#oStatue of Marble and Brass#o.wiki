{{Description|A golem that once bore the weight of the ancients' dreams slumbers within the exhibition hall of the underwater castle...|[[Adventurer Handbook]], before unlocking "Statue of Marble and Brass"}}
{{Description|A centaur-shaped golem forged of marble and brass. Under the hard stone exterior flows Ichor blood. The shield and sword in its hands can perform a blazing melody of flames.|[[Adventurer Handbook]], after unlocking "Statue of Marble and Brass"}}
{{Description|A centaur-shaped golem forged of marble and brass. Under the hard stone exterior flows Ichor blood. Towering as one who commands a legion, it is ready to trample any foe that might transgress against its honor.<br>The now sunken [[Remuria|civilization]] believed that war was as music, an art of rhythms to be followed. Therefore, one who marshals a legion must be like a conductor, whose shield and sword are like the strings and bow of a violin, performing a blazing melody like the raging flames upon the merciless battlefield.<br>"War is a necessary evil on the path to all-encompassing peace." Thus spake a Harmost, one who once led the golem legions to conquest over the entire high sea.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* This boss's title, "Legatus of Legion Athanatoi," uses both the Latin word {{Lang|mini=1|la=legatus|la_tl=which is the conjugated form (in participe perfect) of the verb lego which mean  send an ambassador (in the Roman Empire) or assign someone to the control of some soldier to many legions}} and the Greek word {{Lang|mini=1|grc=ἀθάνατοι|grc_rm=athanatoi|grc_tl=immortals,}} and thus translates to "Lieutenant of the Legion of the Undying."
* This boss's Archive Entry, Tutorial, and icon on the World Map refer to it as "Legatus Golem."
* The event panels for [[#Statue of Marble and Brass|this boss]] and the [[Sea of Bygone Eras#The Undersea Capital, the Lost Homeland|Sea of Bygone Eras]] were the first Event panels to alternate between two different sound effects each time they were switched to.<!-- alternation occurred only if the Event menu wasn't closed -->
