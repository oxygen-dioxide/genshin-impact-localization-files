==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Baharak:''' The previous adventure failed... But it's not the right time to give up!
:'''Baharak:''' Now that we have the sponsorship from [[Vikram|Mr. Vikram]], it's bound to be successful this time!
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Baharak/Traces in the Green|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Baharak:''' That was fun! Don't worry, I'm sure you'll beat me someday soon.
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Baharak:''' I'm impressed! You're really good at this. Would you mind teaching a newbie some tricks?
:{{DIcon}} The previous adventure?
::'''Baharak:''' The last time, the time before, and the time before before... It's always for the traces of the King Deshret's kin!
::'''Baharak:''' You are here at Caravan Ribat. I presume you have heard of the legend of King Deshret among the desert inhabitants?
::'''Baharak:''' The true "God of Wisdom" in the ancient times who was long forgotten... I don't know if this is true or not, but sounds like King Deshret was a god with many followers, right?
::'''Baharak:''' So even if King Deshret doesn't exist anymore, there could still be some kin left... Like a dragon or something?
::{{DIcon}} ...Or perhaps a fox?
::'''Baharak:''' Ugh... Fox? Doesn't seem formidable to me...
::'''Baharak:''' An adventurer should have high expectations. Let's say, dragons, top of all elemental creatures!
::'''Baharak:''' ...Of course, you can set a bigger goal. But better address the actual problem first.
::'''Baharak:''' Anyways, my first little goal is... not to get lost outside [[Aaru Village]] just yet. [[Candace|The young lady in the village]] is quite kind, but it'd be embarrassing to trouble her all the time...
::{{DIcon}} The young lady?
::'''Baharak:''' Well, she's a nice person. She helped me out when I was lost in the desert.
::'''Baharak:''' When we first met, I was in shambles. She didn't recognize me in my green adventurer suit. She took me back to the village and gave me food and water after I explained to her what happened.
::'''Baharak:''' And after that... I bothered her several times, hehe.
::'''Baharak:''' So if you're in danger in the desert, head to Aaru Village for help.
::'''Baharak:''' She has a different color in each eye. You'll know at the sight of her.
:{{DIcon}} Mr. Vikram?
::'''Baharak:''' Yes, a generous {{Rubi|[[Vahumana]]|Aetiology}} researcher. He's very interested in the legends of King Deshret, and has helped many adventurers.
::'''Baharak:''' My adventure this time has been sponsored by him. I'm here helping him look for someone at Caravan Ribat and pass on a message.
::'''Baharak:''' But [[Gohar|the girl]] he's looking for seemed to have received the [[Dusk Bird]] and gone to Sumeru City already. Did I get it wrong...?
:{{DIcon}} Best of luck to you.
::'''Baharak:''' Thanks!
