{{Quest Description|After having fun playing through Dodoco's Bomb-Tastic Adventure, you and Klee hear good news from Lisa, and even receive a surprise gift...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After completing all 6 stages)
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 01.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Hehe, Dodoco defeated lots of bad Spikey Fish Warriors! Even the Spikey Fish King was no match!
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Dodoco, Jumpy Dumpty, and Klee's Sparks 'n' Splash are the best!
:{{DIcon}} Truly unstoppable!
:{{DIcon}} Take that, bad fish!
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This game reminds Paimon of the incident happening in Cider Lake... Did Lisa base its theme on that?
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But come to think of it, why go to the trouble of finding the invading species when they could just ask Klee to blow up every suspicious reef?
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' They could even give us some bombs and let us handle this!
:{{DIcon}} You and Klee are like two peas in a pod.
:{{DIcon}} Nope, no bombs for Paimon.
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Well well, from the looks on your faces, it seems like you're having fun.
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' It's Lisa!
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're here!
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We loved playing Dodoco's Bomb-Tastic Adventure! What a fun game you designed!
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 lisa 02.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Thanks for playing, I'm glad you enjoyed it. Hmm, perhaps I should come up with some new updates?
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 04.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Oooh, yay! Klee wants to see Dodoco going on adventures in all kinds of places!
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' No, wait... You must've spent a looong time working on the game, it must be exhausting! We shouldn't make Lisa work too hard...
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 lisa 03.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Aw, thank you for being so considerate.
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 lisa 04.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' But if it helps keep you happy while you stay inside the city, I'll be more than happy to spend as much time as needed.
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 lisa 05.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Of course, I understand that you prefer going on your own adventures whenever you like. The game is just meant to be a new way to pass the time.
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 lisa 06.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Anyway, I have some great news, and I've also brought a gift for you, cuties.
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 06.ogg}} '''Klee:''' A gift!
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 07a.ogg}} {{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 07b.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Actually, I have a gift for {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} Honorary Knight and Paimon, too!
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 lisa 07.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' We'll get to the gifts in a moment, let me tell you the news first.
:{{DIcon}} Is the incident in Cider Lake resolved?
:{{DIcon}} Can Klee play outside again?
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 lisa 08.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' That's right. Two Knights from the Investigation Team found the invasive species' nest and swiftly disposed of it.
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 lisa 09.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' The Knights have also determined the cause of their invasion.
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 lisa 10.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' The species were accidentally introduced to the lake by a [[Jala|merchant]] without any malicious intent, so the Knights let her go after some lecturing and issuing a fine.
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew... Luckily they didn't cause too much trouble. But even Paimon thinks that merchant was way too careless!
:{{DIcon}} The water in Cider Lake is safe!
:{{DIcon}} Mondstadt's wine industry is safe!
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 08.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Is it time for gifts yet? Can Klee go first?
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 lisa 11.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Of course.
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 lisa 12.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Klee's been returning home on time every day without being reminded by anyone, so I've been wondering what you're up to lately...
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 09.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Hehe~
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 10.ogg}} '''Klee:''' When I was home at night, I looked through Albedo's crafting book and learned to make this!
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 11.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Tada!
:[[File:Item Special Jumpy Dumpty Dodoco.png|100px]]
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, it's Dodoco throwing a Jumpy Dumpty!
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 12.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yep! I made a figure that looks like the Dodoco from Dodoco's Bomb-Tastic Adventure!
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 13.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Even though I can't make it throw real bombs...
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 14a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 14b.ogg}}--> '''Klee:''' I hope it'll remind you of the fun we had together and blast away your troubles and boredom!
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A big Dodoco toy! Paimon loves surprises like this!
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' With this, it'll feel like we're adventuring with Klee and Dodoco wherever we go!
:{{DIcon}} Thank you for the creative and thoughtful gift, Klee!
:{{DIcon}} Dodoco will come with us on all our adventures from now on!
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 15a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 15b.ogg}}--> '''Klee:''' Hehe, I'm so happy you like my gift! I worked super hard on it!
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 16.ogg}} '''Klee:''' What's your gift, Lisa? I wanna see!
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 lisa 13.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Well, I'm afraid my gift is a lot less creative than yours.
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 lisa 14.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' It's a storybook about Dodoco's Bomb-Tastic Adventures&mdash;
:[[File:Item Dodoco's Bomb-Tastic Adventure.png|100px]]
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 17.ogg}} '''Klee:''' An adventure story! Yay!
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, a whole storybook!
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 lisa 15.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' The little cuties returned to Mondstadt and joined Klee on an adventure with Dodoco!
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 lisa 16a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 lisa 16b.ogg}}--> '''Lisa:''' Together they defeated the bad Spikey Fish Warriors and then enjoyed an afternoon tea...
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 lisa 17.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' A most fitting way to end Dodoco's Bomb-Tastic Adventure.
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did you plan out the whole story while designing the game?
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 lisa 18.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' No. As the protagonists of the story, you, little cutie, and Klee all played an important part in bringing the story to life.
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 lisa 19.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I've left a blank spot in the book specially for illustrations...
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 lisa 20.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' But I just thought of an even better idea &mdash; since we're all here on this special occasion, why don't I take a photo of you together?
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure! We got to see our friends and play games together, that's definitely worth celebrating!
:{{DIcon}} Let's take a group photo!
:{{DIcon}} You gotta treasure the small joys in life!
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 18a.ogg}} {{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 18b.ogg}} '''Klee:''' C'mon then, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} Honorary Knight and Paimon! Ready, Lisa?
:{{A|vo zdeq002b 1 klee 19.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Klee had so much fun today! Three, two, one... Dodoco!
