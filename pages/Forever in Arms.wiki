|description    = A massive torch constructed with a square stone pillar as its base and a circular metal brazier, used for illumination and navigation. It is one of the most iconic architectural elements within the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]]. The spiral patterns engraved on the pillar are thought to be simplified versions of [[Saurian]] graffiti. Perhaps the fact that such patterns have been engraved throughout all corners of the Stadium symbolizes the lifestyle shared by the people and Saurians of [[Natlan]] &mdash; living alongside each other, companions forever and always.
