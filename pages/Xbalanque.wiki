'''Xbalanque''', also known by his {{w|Goetic}} name '''Haborym''' and bearing the [[Ancient Name]] {{Ancient Name||'''Kiongozi'''|bearer=1}}, was the first [[God]] of War and [[Pyro Archon]] of [[Natlan]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Mysterious Visitor From Huitztlan}}</ref><ref name="ATBS"/> He was succeeded by the [[Scarlet-Eyed Youth]].

==Profile==
Xbalanque was first mentioned in [[Neuvillette]]'s official introduction, saying, "Someday, when [[Seven Sovereigns|they]] return, their true ordeal shall begin."<ref>HoYoLab: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/20862664 He who looks down on all that are haughty]</ref> He was an outlander to the tribes of Natlan<ref name="Chain Breaker">{{Ref/Weapon|Chain Breaker|quote="If you truly wish to bestow the weak with a place where they are equal, then, O Outlander, whom they acclaim as a hero, I shall journey with you."}}</ref> who killed the Pyro Dragon Sovereign [[Xiuhcoatl]] and returned from the battle to become the first Pyro Archon.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Road Ahead}}</ref><ref name="RFRP"/>

===Appearance===
Based on current depictions in murals and the [[Natlan: Divine Army]] [[Namecard]], Xbalanque is portrayed as a tall man with dark skin and various gold-like accessories, including a large headpiece, earrings, collar, gauntlets, and a large loincloth around his waist. While not confirmed or shown in the aforementioned, it is suggested that Xbalanque also donned glowing shoulder pads and gauntlets at one point, as seen when he duels [[Mavuika]] whilst possessing the body of [[Mausau]].<ref name="HYWHR"/>

==Story==
In the earliest legend about Xbalanque, he was a mortal champion and outlander, who never appeared in any prophecies.<ref name="Chain Breaker" /><ref name="CotS">{{Ref/Arti|Crown of the Saints}}</ref> At the time, the tribespeople had been taught about [[Phlogiston]] by the Sage of the Stolen Flame, [[Waxaklahun Ubah Kan]]. Still, they continued the act of sacrifices and ended up starting a civil war to have more offerings.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Blazing Sacrificial Heart's Resolve}}</ref> Xbalanque conquered one tribe after another, and all the tribes agreed to an armistice.<ref name="CotS"/>

It is presumed that during his conquest, he met the half-human, half-[[dragon]] [[Och-Kan]] and showed compassion to him when the latter was imprisoned by the dragons.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Delirious Desolation of the Sacred Lord}}</ref> Their party would grow to include other historical figures, such as [[Maghan]], [[Lianca]], [[Yupanqui]], [[Uenuku]], and the twins [[Ahpub]] and [[Ixquieh]].

After unifying the tribes, Xbalanque was given a [[Crown of the Saints|crown]] by the [[Lord of the Night]].<ref name="CotS"/> He then fought [[Xiuhcoatl]] for rulership over all Natlan, which would "stain the skies black" and according to legend took place in the [[Great Volcano of Tollan]].<ref name="ATBS">{{Ref/Weapon|A Thousand Blazing Suns}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Rite of the Bold}}</ref> After defeating Xiuhcoatl, Xbalanque was "revived from the flames."<ref name="RFRP">{{Ref/Quest|Revelations from the Past}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Book|Records of Hanan Pacha}}</ref> Right after his victory, [[Ronova]], the Ruler of Death, appeared without notice and showed Xbalanque the grim future of Natlan ahead.<ref name="ATBS"/> Undeterred, the new Pyro Archon bargained with the Ruler of Death to borrow her power to establish the rules that would aid Natlan's fight against the [[Abyss]] &mdash; the [[Ode of Resurrection]] and the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Beneath the Secret Source}}</ref> He also set up the systems and rules that would allow future mortals to ascend to Pyro Archonhood.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Echoes of Life}}</ref> He believed that humanity would prevail in its war against the Abyss; seeing that Ronova was somewhat interested, he also made a small bet: if humanity did win, he be allowed to see the new world for himself for one day, sunrise to sunset, which she also agreed to.<ref name="ATBS"/><ref name="HYWHR">{{Ref/Quest|Hearken, Ye Who Have Returned}}</ref>

He had slashed the great dragon's eyes in the battle, which created two [[Golden Entreaty|Golden Entreaties]]. He and Waxaklahun Ubah Kan each took one, swearing an oath to maintain peace between humans and dragons thereafter.<ref name="RFRP"/>

===Legacy===
The Eternal Empire of [[Ochkanatlan (Civilization)|Ochkanatlan]] was founded by Xbalanque's followers. After Xbalanque "arose from the throne to enter the [[Sacred Flame]],"<ref>{{Ref/Item|Delirious Demeanor of the Sacred Lord}}</ref> Och-Kan took over as its king. However, he went on to betray the commandments that Xbalanque had left him, and Ochkanatlan was abandoned after the [[Scarlet-Eyed Youth]] and his party overthrew Och-Kan. The scarlet-eyed youth succeeded Xbalanque as the second Pyro Archon.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Astral Vulture's Crimson Plumage}}</ref>

===Present Day===
During the [[Traveler]] and Mavuika's battle against the Abyss, [[Gosoythoth]] extracts the memories of Xbalanque and previous Pyro Archons and taunts its foes with twisted voices of the previous Archons in an attempt to sow despair. However, the two defeat Gosoythoth, purging the [[Night Kingdom]] of Abyssal influence for the time being.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Where All Hopes Lie}}</ref> As Mavuika used Ronova's powers to thwart Gosoythoth's abyssal invasion, Ronova appeared in Ochkanatlan shortly after the two returned from Night Kingdom and demanded Mavuika's life as payment to fulfill the pact set by Xbalanque, but was ultimately circumvented by [[Capitano]] and the Lord of the Night Kingdom.

Due to the Natlanese winning the war, Ronova honored her bet with Xbalanque and allowed him to see present-day Natlan. The [[Wayob]] informed [[Citlali]] that Xbalanque would be returning to the nation and she informed the Traveler and Mavuika, who began preparing to welcome his return to Teyvat. Xbalanque possessed the body of Mausau, a young boy, as his original body could not be restored. He heard of the tournament and applied, but because of Mausau's young age, he was not able to perform the feats he could back then and was quickly eliminated. However, Mavuika sensed his presence and later took him away from the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]] for a conversation. She explained how they prevailed against the Abyss and he told them what he did when he arrived on Teyvat. He also told them that he would only stay for a single day before returning to the Night Kingdom.<ref name="HYWHR"/>

As the first Pyro Archon, Xbalanque wished to test his mettle against Mavuika, but given the considerations with Mausau's body, brought them to a spiritual area that would not have any impact in the physical world. Xbalanque dueled Mavuika but narrowly lost. Impressed by the legacy passed down by his Ancient Name, he offered Mavuika the rest of his life force, which could be used to bring someone back for a time so she could have them visit her much like he had. Mavuika declined the offer, stating that it would be best to leave matters as is. Impressed by her resolve, Xbalanque revealed that her family, friends, and comrades in the Night Kingdom had told him that was exactly how she would respond to the offer, and to enjoy the future she had forged with her own hands. Mavuika then offered him a trip around Natlan on her Flamestrider, which Xbalanque agreed to. After the short trip, he thanked her for their time and left Mausau's body to return to the Night Kingdom.<ref name="HYWHR"/>

==Trivia==
* During his visit to Natlan, Xbalanque referred to himself as an "old man," indicating his general age at the time he died.
* When Mavuika expressed surprise that he had a sense of humor, Xbalanque was a bit disappointed to learn that there were no records (or any that survived, at least) stating that he was "totally hilarious."
* Xbalanque is one of the voices that [[Gosoythoth]] mimics while the Traveler is fighting the [[Lord of Eroded Primal Fire]] incarnated by it.

===Etymology===
* Xbalanque is the name of one of the {{w|Maya Hero Twins}}.
