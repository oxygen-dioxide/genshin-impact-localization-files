-->(A lot of information was once contained within these simple notes, but most of it has been scratched out...)<br><!--
-->Grind the cores of a hundred [[Embercore Flower]]s and swallow them in a single gulp.<br><!--
-->&mdash;Didn't work. Just hurt my teeth, it was so sweet. Seriously, how did people in the past get the idea that it could... Never mind. Let's try some other way.<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->Collect the molted shells of the claws that fall from [[Iktomisaur]]s during their growth period as [[Iktomisaurus Chick|whelps]], grind them into a powder and apply it to your body.<br><!--
-->&mdash;If that would work, I'd be an Archon! That's just dead skin, isn't it!?<br><!--
-->&mdash;Tried it anyway. Didn't work, as expected. Powder left a weird smell that took forever to wash off, too. Come on, ancestors, can't you come through for me at least once?<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->Immerse yourself in the [[People of the Springs]]' hot springs once every ten nights. Do this ten times, and all your wounds shall be healed.<br><!--
-->&mdash;Well, I have heard that their hot springs are [[phlogiston]]-rich, so it could work...<br><!--
-->&mdash;Aaaand nope. And if you look closely at this woven scroll, it once belonged to the People of the Springs anyway. Did I just fall for a fake ad of theirs?<br><!--
-->&mdash;Well, at least only my wallet was hurt in the end!<br><!--

-->&mdash;Well, looks like that's the only thing left to try.<br><!--
-->&mdash;Whatever. Desperate times call for desperate measures, and I'm here in People of the Springs land, anyway. Might as well give it a shot.}}

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(If the player started the quest by talking to Chikya)
::'''???:''' That big lunk isn't going to start getting up, is it...
::'''???:''' There'll be trouble if it does, but there's only one way through... Do I have to dig a path from on top to get around it? How long will that take...
::{{DIcon}} Why don't you just go right over...
::{{DIcon}} Not all mechanisms are the awakening sort...
::'''???:''' Well, aren't you bold, {{MC|m=lad|f=lass}}? Listen good, alright? Your youth means you've still got chances to make mistakes aplenty, but... W&mdash;Wait, where'd you come fr&mdash;
::'''???:''' Ah... Ow, ow, ow.
::'''Paimon:''' Whoa, {{Traveler}}, what did you do to her? That wasn't some sorta invisible attack, was it?
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Err?
::{{DIcon}} I didn't do anything...
::{{DIcon}} This power doth the adepti of Liyue name "Gusto"...
:::'''Paimon:''' R&mdash;Really?
:::'''???:''' "Gusto"? What in tarnation is that? You're a braggart and a half, aren't you, {{MC|m=lad|f=lass}}?
::'''???:''' That was my back acting up. I've been stooping for a good long while, inching my way toward that big lunk, and I stood up too fast. Surefire way to bring the pain, is what it is.
::'''???:''' Used to be that it'd only flare up when I'd turn my back at a specific angle, but these days, one careless move leaves me in a world of hurt for a good long while.
::'''???:''' And just so you know, it's pain o'clock now, {{Traveler}}, so... *hiss* Don't make starting conversations from behind people a habit, alright?
::'''???:''' And what about you two? I mean your names...
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon's Paimon, and this lil' Tepetlisaurus here is {{Little One}}.
::'''???:''' I see, I see. In that case, I guess I'll call myself...
::'''Paimon:''' "Call yourself"? What, are you gonna give us a fake name?
::'''???:''' Well, a person's gotta be on their guard while on a walkabout, don't they? Bah. And here I was going to give you my love rival's name. A young'un, she is, and energetic too &mdash; and worst of all, she's got a healthy back!
::'''???:''' But forget it. That would be unfriendly competition &mdash; if you take my meaning. So have my real name instead: Chikya.
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
::'''Chikya:''' Heh, and aren't you a cute little fella? You're calling my name, I know it. Anyway, you can call me Big Sis Chikya &mdash; not Aunt Chikya though. That one I forbid.
::{{DIcon}} Alright, Big Sis Chikya.
:::'''Chikya:''' Good, that's good. You've got a fine future ahead of you, {{MC|m=lad|f=lass}}.
::{{DIcon}} Well, I could just call you "Aunt" only...
:::'''Chikya:''' Pfah! That won't do at all! What, are you in your rebellious phase? No, that won't do. But I'll forgive you &mdash; this time, anyway.
::'''Paimon:''' Anyway, what are you doing here, Big Sis Chikya?
::'''Chikya:''' And isn't that the million Mora question? What would a person be doing here amidst naught but ruins? What would your answer be, {{Traveler}} my {{MC|m=lad|f=lass}}?
::{{DIcon}} To rob others, or be robbed!
:::'''Chikya:''' ...I'm sorry. What sort of environment did you grow up in...?
::{{DIcon}} Waiting for someone to strike up a conversation with them?
:::'''Chikya:''' Well, now! Were you my type, I'd call that a good answer. Too bad for you, Big Sis here prefers the strapping sort.
::'''Chikya:''' Either way, minus 10 points for getting it wrong! What I'm doing... is treasure hunting.
::{{DIcon}} "Wow, treasure!" There you go, Paimon. Spared you the effort.
::'''Paimon:''' Seriously? What are you, some serial line thief? And Paimon's gonna say it anyway &mdash; "Wow, treasure!"
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr... Rawr!
::'''Chikya:''' Haha, you all sure do get along. Who knows, if I hadn't spent so much time tidying woven scrolls that my back gave out, I might've made some good friends myself!
::'''Chikya:''' Either way, I'm on the hunt for an "elixir that can cure all injuries" I discovered in a secret scroll &mdash; you want in?
::'''Chikya:''' As everyone knows, if we Masters of the Night-Wind have anything aplenty, it's woven artifacts recording stories of our past. We can split the elixir, should we find it...
::'''Chikya:''' But the true issue here is my back pain! Walking from the hot springs down at the People thereof was exhausting enough, so I need able help for the next leg of my search!
::'''Chikya:''' Therapeutic springs my foot &mdash; didn't work worth diddly-squat...
::'''Chikya:''' *sigh* I might look like this now, but I, too, was once a pretty lass who'd ride leaping Iktomisaurs on the regular!
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
::'''Chikya:''' Hehe, I see you're interested in that elixir, hmm, {{Little One}}? That curiosity will be the root of future success, you know.
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Mmm? ... Rawr!
::'''Paimon:''' An "elixir that can cure all injuries"! That sounds amazing!
::{{DIcon}} Let's go check it out, then...
::{{DIcon}} I knew you'd be excited...
::'''Chikya:''' Those unmoved by treasure can barely be called human! Why, even the coldest-blooded Saurians get fired up when they hear the word!
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
::'''Paimon:''' Exactly!
::'''Chikya:''' Right, then. In that case, our first objective will be to get past this big lunk... After you, esteemed {{Traveler}}.
;(If the player started the quest by defeating the Secret Source Automaton{{Colon}} Hunter-Seeker)
::'''Chikya:''' J&mdash;Just one moment, {{MC|m=lad|f=lass}}. You seem rather strong...
::'''Chikya:''' Ah... Ow, ow, ow.
::'''Paimon:''' Whoa, {{Traveler}}, what did you do to her? That wasn't some sorta invisible attack, was it?
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Err?
::{{DIcon}} I didn't do anything...
::{{DIcon}} This power doth the adepti of Liyue name "Gusto"...
:::'''Paimon:''' R&mdash;Really?
:::'''Chikya:''' "Gusto"? What in tarnation is that? You're a braggart and a half, aren't you, {{MC|m=lad|f=lass}}?
::'''Chikya:''' That was my back acting up. I've been stooping for a good long while, trying to observe that mechanism, and I stood up too fast. Pretty sure way to bring the pain, is what it is.
::'''Chikya:''' Used to be that it'd only flare up when I'd turn my back at a specific angle, but these days, one careless move leaves me in a world of hurt for a good long while.
::'''Chikya:''' And just so you know, it's pain o'clock right now, so... Gah! Try to understand this suffering adult, would'ja, {{Traveler}}?
::'''Chikya:''' And what about you two? I mean your names...
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon's Paimon, and this lil' Tepetlisaurus here is {{Little One}}.
::'''Chikya:''' I see, I see. In that case, I guess I'll call myself...
::'''Paimon:''' "Call yourself"? What, are you gonna give us a fake name?

::{{DIcon}} Alright, Big Sis Chikya.
:::'''Chikya:''' Good, that's good. You've got a fine future ahead of you, {{MC|m=lad|f=lass}}.
::{{DIcon}} Well, I could just call you "Aunt" only...
:::'''Chikya:''' Pfah! That won't do at all! What, are you in your rebellious phase? No, that won't do. But I'll forgive you &mdash; this time, anyway.
::'''Paimon:''' Then, uh, Big Sis Chikya? Why did you call out to us again?
::'''Chikya:''' And isn't that a million Mora question? What would a person be aiming to do amidst naught but ruins? Why don't you answer, {{Traveler}} my {{MC|m=lad|f=lass}}?
::{{DIcon}} Looking for someone to rob, perhaps?
:::'''Chikya:''' ...I'm sorry. What sort of environment did you grow up in...?
::{{DIcon}} Spoiling for a pleasant encounter?
:::'''Chikya:''' Well, now! Were you my type, I'd call that a good answer. Too bad for you, Big Sis here prefers the strapping sort.
::'''Chikya:''' Either way, minus 10 points for getting it wrong! What I'm doing... is treasure hunting.
::{{DIcon}} "Wow, treasure!" There you go, Paimon. Spared you the effort.
::'''Paimon:''' Seriously? What are you, some serial line thief? And Paimon's gonna say it anyway &mdash; "Wow, treasure!"

::{{DIcon}} Let's go check it out, then...

::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
::'''Paimon:''' Exactly!
::'''Chikya:''' Look at the pictures on these walls. We've come to the right place!
::'''Chikya:''' Now, according to the ancient scrolls... We need to continue onward.
::'''Chikya:''' Let's get moving! Err, not too fast, though... Gotta have some care for the wounded &mdash; and by "wounded," I mean "me"!
:;(Skip to "Continue into the cave")

;(Approach the enemy)
:'''Chikya:''' Ugh, it's moving after all! Gah, my bad feelings always turn out true, don't they...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Don't worry. Leave this to {{Traveler}}!

;(After defeating the enemy)
:'''Chikya:''' Huh. I didn't think you'd be able to fend them off with those thin limbs of yours...
:'''Paimon:''' Don't underestimate {{Traveler}}! {{MC|m=He|f=She}}'s taken way bigger things out than that!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Chikya:''' Hmm, looks like roping you in was the right choice. Hehe... Ah, guess I've got a good eye, eh?
:{{DIcon}} And here I thought you were going to compliment me!
:'''Chikya:''' Haha, I'll bet you've received lots of that, what with your strength and all. Just let poor Chikya get her share too, would'ja?
:'''Chikya:''' Look at the pictures on these walls. We've come to the right place!
:'''Chikya:''' Now, according to the ancient scrolls... We need to continue onward.
:'''Chikya:''' Let's get moving! Err, not too fast, though... Gotta have some care for the wounded &mdash; and by "wounded," I mean "me"!

{{Quest Description|update|Search for the legendary "elixir that can cure all injuries" with Chikya.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Continue into the cave)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, it's getting hotter as we go... Is this elixir really inside?
:'''Chikya:''' ...Well, if you wanna be precise, the elixir isn't within, but a method by which the treasure may be accessed is.
:'''Chikya:''' You'll know when we get there. First, we need to find a door.

;(Approach the [[Liquid Phlogiston]] pool)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, there we go! That's a door! Is that the one you're talking about?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!

;(Approach the door)
:'''Paimon:''' But the door looks closed...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr...
:'''Chikya:''' Well, it had better be. I mean, an open door would mean that our path to the great treasure is long gone!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. You do have a point there, Chikya!
:'''Chikya:''' ...Huh, to think that it was exactly as those woven scrolls and texts concerning them stated. What do you think? See that {{Color|buzzword|Phlogiston Engraving}} right there by the door?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Chikya:''' That's right. You're a quick one, little fella. Sharp-eyed, too. Researchers have said that Saurian visual acuity differs by species...
:'''Chikya:''' Saurians are generally further-sighted than humans are, though from this distance, anyone from the tribe who isn't a visually impaired old lady could spot this Phlogiston Engraving.
:'''Paimon:''' So this shining thing is what you call a Phlogiston Engraving, Chikya?
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, a what Engraving now?
::'''Chikya:''' Wait, you've been adventuring in Natlan, but you've never heard of Phlogiston Engravings?
:{{DIcon}} Ooh, a Phlogiston Engraving. That's right. Totally.
::'''Chikya:''' Your acting could use some work, although I'm not sure what sort of training could help you...
:'''Chikya:''' Anyway, speaking of phlogiston...
:'''Chikya:''' The origin of Phlogiston Engraving, narrowly speaking, comes from the days when Natlan was still ruled by a [[Xiuhcoatl|Pyro Dragon]], who caused humanity to exist only in primitive tribes.
:'''Chikya:''' In those days, only the dragons could use phlogiston. But the Sage of the Stolen Flame, [[Waxaklahun Ubah Kan]], risked life and limb to steal the flaming seed of it from the [[Great Volcano of Tollan|great volcano]].
:'''Chikya:''' As such, humans began imitating the way dragons controlled the substance, creating a language by which humanity could exert that same control. This is the basis of modern Natlan's phlogiston usage.
:'''Chikya:''' The results of that are Phlogiston Engravings, like the one you see before you right now. Magnificent, isn't it? It's still intact even after all these years, still visible to the naked eye!
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawrr!
:'''Chikya:''' Alright, your turn, {{Traveler}}!
:{{DIcon}} ...Yeah, whoo.
::'''Paimon:''' C'mon, that's kinda bland.
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Roo...
::'''Chikya:''' Huh. I didn't know you were the independent sort like that, {{Traveler}}.
:{{DIcon}} Very impressive, Chikya!
::'''Chikya:''' I know, right? And that's why I took up the "Phlogiston Usage Tutor" job, desired by few in the tribe &mdash; the compliments are just sublime!
::'''Chikya:''' Also, teaching children, soon to start using phlogiston, about the substance's history is a very important job!
:'''Paimon:''' So, the Phlogiston Engraving here is...
:'''Chikya:''' As I said before, Phlogiston Engraving is also a language. It looks like a mere pattern, but those well-versed in the art can understand the meaning therein.
:'''Chikya:''' And, as a scholar on the subject, I should only need a day to analyze these patterns...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr...
:'''Paimon:''' W&mdash;Wait, you're gonna take a whole day?
:'''Chikya:''' Yeah, what about it? Now, the pattern looks flat, sure, but every last hook and turn can redefine the meaning behind the phlogiston flow within.
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, that's super complicated...
:'''Chikya:''' Yup. Phlogiston Engraving scholarship is a most masterful field of study.
:{{DIcon}} So, what if you just read the meaning directly using phlogiston?
:'''Chikya:''' D&mdash;Directly...!? Well, you could certainly do that, but the meaning could &mdash; and I do mean "could" &mdash; contain some discrepancy...
:'''Chikya:''' Wait. You can use phlogiston? But you're an outlander, aren't you?
:{{DIcon}} Well, I could do it the moment I arrived in Natlan...
:'''Chikya:''' Really? I never knew that could happen. How could that&mdash; I mean, what a rarity! Quite expected of you... I suppose.
:'''Chikya:''' Anyway, this is a good opportunity to try to sense the phlogiston for yourself.
:{{Black Screen|Your hand stops a short distance from the Phlogiston Engraving.<br>You feel the warmth in your body and slowly follow the patterns along the wall.}}
:{{Black Screen|Then, the meaning lights up in your mind like a dim star...<br>"If you wish to open this door, seek out an Unveiling Script."}}
:'''Chikya:''' So, what's recorded on that Engraving?
:{{DIcon}} It reads as follows...
:'''Chikya:''' Hmm, that is indeed what it says... Answers of this sort are pretty easy to verify... And in any case, this is a pretty classic theme.
;(If the Unveiling Script hasn't been collected)
::'''Chikya:''' There should be an Unveiling Script somewhere around here with which we can unlock this Phlogiston Engraving. Where is it, though?
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
::'''Paimon:''' Yes, a script with which to unveil this Engraving... Wait, you understood me, little guy?
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm? He turned around? Is he trying to say that the Script is behind us?
;(If the Unveiling Script has already been collected)
::'''Chikya:''' There should be an Unveiling Script &mdash; which is another Engraving, by the way &mdash; somewhere around here with which we can unlock this one.
::'''Chikya:''' Huh? So... the thing you just picked up along the way was actually an Engraving's Script? Ha-ha, what luck!
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
::'''Chikya:''' Well then, let's integrate the Unveiling Script into the Engraving.
:;(Skip to "After opening the door")

;(Talk to Chikya again, optional)
:'''Chikya:''' Well, {{Traveler}}? Did you find the key text we need? Don't worry, there's no rush. The walls around us might help you find something.
:'''Chikya:''' Look on the bright side, {{MC|m=lad|f=lass}}. You've already saved us a day's worth of time. So really, there's no need to hurry!

;(Tip)
:Indwell a [[Koholasaurus]] and use Aquadash on the Unveiling Script to retrieve it

;(After some time has passed)
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? What's up, {{Little One}}? You saying you think the Unveiling Script's somewhere nearby?

;(Get closer to the script)
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, this must be the Unveiling Script! C'mon, let's take it back!
----
;(After opening the door)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, the door really opened... Well, it's half-opened, anyway...

;(Move past the door)
:'''Chikya:''' Everything about you exudes vigor, {{MC|m=young lad|f=young lass}}... Hahaha, almost makes me wish I could steal some of it from you!
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, what? How do you even do something like that, anyway!?

;(Move past the [[Teleport Waypoint]])
:'''Chikya:''' Ah, there we go. A Spiritdoor and Spiritway, shimmering on the edge of reality &mdash; just what we're looking for!

;(Approach the spirit door)
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon was just about to say that this place was getting hotter the deeper in we got, but she sure didn't expect this whole place to be filled with lava!
:'''Paimon:''' Careful, {{Little One}}! If you slip, that might just be the end of you...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Roo... Rawr...
:'''Chikya:''' Huh, now that you mention it, floaty little Paimon's the safest here!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, that's just one of the reasons Paimon's awesome, you know!
:{{DIcon}} They say that those whose heads get too big wind up floating away...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's always floating anyway... But that didn't sound like a compliment.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Err?
:'''Chikya:''' You're a real bright spark, Paimon, you know that?
:'''Paimon:''' That... didn't sound like a compliment either, Chikya. Anyway, never mind all that!
:'''Paimon:''' This is the thing we were looking for, right? Hmm, it just looks like a clay ring with phlogiston patterning on it...
:'''Paimon:''' Do you think this one's valuable, by any chance?
:'''Chikya:''' Very much so... In fact, it's probably worth a large sum of Mora. But its real worth lies in its ability to open the path to [[The Upper Sanctum|the {{Rubi|Upper Sanctum|Hanan Pacha|center=1}}]].
:'''Chikya:''' You've seen the islands floating in the sky, haven't you?
:'''Paimon:''' You mean the ones above the lake...
:'''Chikya:''' That's right. We call those the {{Rubi|Upper Sanctum|Hanan Pacha|center=1}}, due to their inaccessibility by either humans or Saurians.
:'''Chikya:''' They say that the "legendary elixir that heals all wounds" can be found there, in fact!
:'''Chikya:''' For people like us, who are constantly in conflict. That is a pure land of peace, a utopia created by the very first human to use phlogiston.
:'''Chikya:''' And now it's time for a question, class. What was the name of that sage who, in the past, stole the flaming seed of phlogiston? {{Little One}}?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rraaaawr! Rawrr! Rawr!
:'''Chikya:''' Very enthusiastic, but I don't think I heard you right!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rooowr!
:'''Chikya:''' Alright, now then. Your turn, {{MC|m=lad|f=lass}}. What's your answer?
:{{DIcon}} Waxaklahen Ubah Kan!
::'''Chikya:''' Close, but not quite! It's Waxaklahun Ubah Kan. Shame about that, but it's minus 10 points from you, {{MC|m=lad|f=lass}}!
:{{DIcon}} Waxaklahun Ubah Kan!
::'''Chikya:''' Very good. You memorized it after hearing it only once, did you? I see great things in your future, I do.
:'''Chikya:''' Anyway, we usually call him the Sage of the Stolen Flame, which is easier by far.
:'''Chikya:''' Some also call him a madman or a lunatic, but I'd call those compliments as well. He did do some very impressive things regardless, after all.
:'''Chikya:''' He stole the flaming phlogiston seed from the giant dragon and created the Upper Sanctum using that power, before teaching it to everyone in the tribes.
:'''Chikya:''' This is also, or so the ancient scrolls say, where humans first began practicing with phlogiston.
:'''Chikya:''' And this special Spiritdoor is a sort of trial. Activating this door will grant you access to the Spiritway that leads to the Upper Sanctum...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Chikya:''' While I don't know what you're saying, yes, that's where the treasure is. Legend has it that it is a gift given by the Sage to those who pass the trial.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' H&mdash;Huh, so that's the story... What's the trial like, then?
:{{DIcon}} Let me have a look.
:'''Chikya:''' Nah, it's fine, I've seen the Phlogiston Engraving on this Spiritdoor enough times to sear it into my memory...
:'''Chikya:''' "If you wish to open this path, seek three Unveiling Scripts."
:'''Chikya:''' That's right, pretty much the same as before. We just need to find three Scripts this time!
:'''Chikya:''' Hehe, I mean, drawing info directly from phlogiston is impressive, but I'd personally put more stock in my graphic language comparisons.
:'''Chikya:''' It seems like this Spiritdoor already has an Unveiling Script embedded into it. See? A third of it has already been lit up...
;(If the player has collected 0&ndash;1 Unveiling Scripts)
::'''Chikya:''' So we just need to find two more!
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Hmm?
::'''Chikya:''' Argh, my back's aching again... I'll wait for you here while you find those Unveiling Scripts, alright?
::'''Chikya:''' This place is very dangerous, so keep your eyes peeled, {{MC|m=lad|f=lass}}!
;(If the player has collected 2 Unveiling Scripts)
::'''Chikya:''' So we just need to find the remaining two Scripts... Wait, didn't you two find them on our way here already?
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Hmm?
::'''Chikya:''' Ah, you truly do have a bright future ahead of you. I didn't think you'd have such foresight. Even I, one hailing from the Masters of the Night-Wind, one who works with Iktomisaurs every day, must confess my shock.
::'''Chikya:''' In that case, let us integrate the Unveiling Scripts into the Phlogiston Engraving, just like before.
:;(Skip to "Activate the spirit door")

;(After the dialogue)
:'''Paimon:''' Unveiling Script, where are you...
:'''Paimon:''' C'mon, {{Little One}}, you help out too! Just let Paimon and {{Traveler}} know if you see any glowy patterns, 'kay?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!

;(Interact with "Spiritdoor", optional)
:'''"Spiritdoor":''' "If you wish to open this path, seek three Unveiling Scripts."

;(Talk to Chikya by the Teleport Waypoint, optional)
:'''Chikya:''' And it's no big deal even if you don't find the Unveiling Script. The important thing is to watch your step.
:'''Chikya:''' Sure, a "one step at a time" approach is slower than most, but better to take each step with care, than with haste!

;(Tip near the western Unveiling Script)
:Approach to shut the [[Iridescent Beam]] off and collect the Unveiling Script

;(Tip near the southeastern Unveiling Script)
:Defeat the emerging monsters and collect the Unveiling Script

;(Activate the first Unveiling Script)
:'''Paimon:''' Well, looks like we've found the first Unveiling Script!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!

;(Activate the second Unveiling Script)
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, now we've found both of the Unveiling Scripts. Let's head back to that clay ring!
----
;(Activate the spirit door)
:'''Chikya:''' So is this how a Spiritway looks when illuminated?
:'''Chikya:''' The ancient woven scrolls said that when the dim path lights up, it will be like a bonfire being roused once more into a blaze... and they weren't exaggerating.
:'''Chikya:''' Ah, right! You're back at last. You alright over there, Paimon?
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, Paimon's fine!
:'''Chikya:''' And you, {{Little One}}?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Chikya:''' Well, still not getting you there, but it seems you're uninjured too.
:'''Chikya:''' And finally, {{Traveler}}... Eh, I knew you'd be fine, {{MC|m=lad|f=lass}}. You've got a bright future ahead of you, after all!
:{{DIcon}} Some concern would have been nice all the same...
:'''Chikya:''' Eh, that would be unnecessary. The only thing you need is the "trust" of others, and you should be proud of that.
:'''Chikya:''' Seriously, though, this place is frighteningly full of liquid phlogiston. I was concerned for a moment there that you'd not come back.
:'''Chikya:''' Couldn't have returned on my own power with this bad back, after all. If you'd failed to return, I'd have turned into jerky over here, without ever having found that cure-all elixir!
:'''Chikya:''' ...Ah!
:'''Paimon:''' What's wrong, Chikya? What's with that sudden look?
:'''Chikya:''' I just remembered that when tidying up ancient scrolls previously, I did spot an account of our ancestors swimming in lava.
:'''Chikya:''' At that time, I thought, "Swimming in liquid phlogiston? Madness!" Reckoned it was some wild storyteller's yarn, I did.
:'''Chikya:''' Well, now that you think about it, those were probably...
:{{DIcon}} Those who failed...
:{{DIcon}} It was a warning to those attempting the trial...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrooo...
:'''Paimon:''' It's hard to imagine why anyone would draw that, but yeah, just thinking about it gives me the heebie-jeebies.
:'''Chikya:''' No wonder my friend gave me a pained look, like one looking at some emotionally-warped humanoid monster, when I told that story as a joke.
:'''Chikya:''' We drifted apart thereafter. Gah, that was one of my only friends, you know?
:'''Chikya:''' Anyway, never mind. Let's head back to the tribe and talk there instead. This whole "friends" business should start looking up once the Sage of the Stolen Flame's gift returns with us in glory!
:{{DIcon}} And what's that gift supposed to be, the power of hypnosis?
::'''Chikya:''' No, but Mora and dreams of success are effective, if dirty, substitutes.
:{{DIcon}} Ugh, come on, that's an awful definition of friendship...
::'''Chikya:''' Well, broaden definitions and lower standards enough, and, you, too, will find your friends as numerous as aphids in a field.
:'''Chikya:''' Anyway, for the sake of friendship&mdash; Actually, screw that! We're doing this for the gift, for ourselves, and for... Well, for selfish reasons, anyway, because we deserve it all and more! Let's rock!
:'''Chikya:''' Still, this is the first time I'm riding a Spiritway... You'll dodge if I end up vomiting, won't you?
:'''Paimon:''' Uh...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rwargh...
:'''Chikya:''' Alright, alright, don't worry, you all. I'm just kidding!

;(While riding the spiritway)
:'''Chikya:''' Haha, so this is the Spiritway... That was quick. I wasn't expecting this experience.
:'''Chikya:''' We took all this time to get to our destination, and "whoop," it took us all the way back in an instant. Fascinating.
:'''Chikya:''' If you ask me, the [[Pyro Archon]] should be placing this stuff everywhere!
:'''Paimon:''' Have you never entered a Spiritway before?
:'''Chikya:''' Well, I've always lived within my tribe's bounds, and we have phlogiston-saturated winds nearby that can blow us high into the sky over there...
:'''Chikya:''' Still, I feel like these Spiritways are slightly more fun.
:{{Black Screen|You ride the Spiritway back to the surface...}}
:'''Chikya:''' As expected, the Spiritdoor below is connected to the one in these ruins, such that the passage may extend into the skies.
:'''Chikya:''' The woven scrolls record rightly &mdash; ah, I'm so proud of myself for believing in them!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Chikya:''' Yes, yes, and you're awesome for cooperating with me, {{Little One}}. Heh, what an adorable little fellow you are.
:'''Chikya:''' How would you like to jump ship over to me, hmm? Three square meals of one [[Grainfruit]] guaranteed.
:{{DIcon}} ...One for each meal is kinda sad, let's be real.
::'''Chikya:''' Now, don't you go looking down on the Grainfruit, it's a real hit amongst Saurians, and it's healthy for them, too.
:{{DIcon}} Wow, we've got a poacher over here!
::'''Chikya:''' Well, you miss every shot you don't take, you know?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Roooah... Ooroo...
:'''Chikya:''' Haha, I'll take that as a no, then. Ah, to be so close &mdash; I'm getting a little envious.
:'''Paimon:''' We were around when {{Little One}} first opened his eyes... You didn't have a chance to start with.
:'''Chikya:''' That so, that close, huh... That might make for a very painful goodbye if that time should come, though.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Err?
:'''Chikya:''' Alright. We're about to reach the Upper Sanctum, but, uh... Let me take five real quick. Goodness, my back hurts.
:{{DIcon}} Has it always been that way?
:'''Chikya:''' Oh, come on, it's not that bad. You know, you leave yourself open to tricks by constantly taking people so seriously.
:'''Chikya:''' If anything, my back pain's decreased mysteriously since meeting you.
:'''Chikya:''' I wonder what that is... Is there something special about your body, and would that work with a piece of it of any size, like, say, a thumb?
:'''Chikya:''' Would you mind giving one to me? I'd give you mine in exchange.
:{{DIcon}} Wanna give it a shot?
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Err?
::'''Paimon:''' Wait, what sort of weird trade is that...
::'''Chikya:''' ...Okay, so, I don't know how you grew up, {{MC|m=lad|f=lass}}, but I'm sure most people would've refused.
::'''Chikya:''' I was just trying to scare you, y'know... Didn't think you'd get me instead.
:{{DIcon}} No thanks. That's scary.
::'''Chikya:''' Hehe, ah, what a shame...
::'''Paimon:''' Excuse you! It would be weirder if anyone agreed to that!
:'''Chikya:''' *sigh* Alright, just a bit longer, and the pain in my back should subside... And then we can head to the Upper Sanctum together.
