==Gameplay Notes==
* The weapon passive works even when the equipping character is not on the field.

==Description==
The splendid jadeite fell from the sky, washed by the ever-flowing cleansing waters.<br>
Freed from dark earth and rotten wood, every trace of residue removed.<br>
A primordial stone, chiseled and molded by the hands of mortal youth.<br>
Ultimately becoming a splendid jade instrument, awaiting a serendipitous moment to fulfill its sacred purpose...

"It is just as I said," mused the [[Soraya|researcher]] from the [[Sumeru|realm of rainforests]] over tea, "the arc of history bends towards decay and collapse."<br>
"The fall of humanity can only be prevented with the wisdom and mercy of the gods. Without these, humans will inevitably annihilate themselves."<br>
"Witness the silent testimony of the [[Guili Plains|deserted ruins]] lying betwixt mountain and swamp. Witness the [[Hilichurls|wild beasts in the hills, bereft of their powers of speech and spirit...]]"<br>
"The people of the past perished without a trace, and even their greatest kings and chiefs failed to make even a ripple."

The people of [[Chenyu Vale]] did not always dwell there, but once called the [[Lisha|crystal-veined mountains]] home.<br>
Life of family and tribe both revolved around the mines, and their settlements stretched from peak to peak.<br>
But the [[Nameless Ruins|ancient sin]] lying buried beneath their feet and shovels was unknown to the mortals, hidden under the deepest shafts.<br>
[[Spiritstone|Divine punishment]] is unforgiving, and cares not for the lives of mortals. After the catastrophe, their forebears were forced to bring their families northward.

The elders of [[Qiaoying Village]] claim that the ancestors of the people of Chenyu Vale came from a [[The Chasm|chasm]] to the south.<br>
They brought with them a [[Chiwang Terrace|great jade altar]], and left behind [[Qingxu Pool|ancient]], [[Lingju Pass|enigmatic]] [[Dunyu Ruins|ruins]]...<br>
When [[Nibelung#Story|war among the gods]] brought tragedy, the ancestors of Chenyu Vale's people were reduced to wandering refugees.<br>
Their descendents once believed in a now-forgotten god, and all are now lost to history and consigned to dust.

"An unsound theory," responded the [[Zhongli|consultant in the dark robes]], "the history of mortals is one filled with rebirth."<br>
"Glory and ruin both spring from mortals themselves. Without agency, there is no rise or fall to speak of."<br>
"Ancient ruins lie forsaken, but their former inhabitants, buffeted by fate, live on to this day..."<br>
"The fading of their ancestors has given rise to the prosperity of today... even if they are now assimilated, one with the people of a [[Morax|new god]]."<br>
"Even if they are often helpless in matters great and small, they have not been destroyed by circumstance, but rather made their own choices."<br>
"As for the wisdom and laws of the gods, they are based on the consensus of mortals, and not personal whim."

After a short while, the trivial debate over tea came to an inconclusive end. Such discussions between mortals and gods are wont to end in squabbling over this and that.<br>
But the [[Bishui River]] flows eternal, just as the luster of the sacred jade within remains as constant as its former master.
