{{Location Intro|description=<p>{{If Self|Stormterror's Lair|It|Stormterror's Lair}} was once the capital of [[Decarabian's Mondstadt|Old Mondstadt]], ruled by the God of Storms, [[Decarabian]]. After he was slain in an uprising, [[Barbatos]] took his place and reshaped the land. The people then moved the capital to an island in the middle of [[Cider Lake]], where the [[City of Mondstadt]] remains to this day.</p><p>Five hundred years ago, victorious but grievously injured by the corrupted dragon [[Durin]], the Dragon of the East [[Dvalin]] fell into a deep slumber in the ruins of the former capital. However, the people of Mondstadt forgot about him and when he reawakened; they feared him and called him "Stormterror" &mdash; giving the region its current name. This, along with the pain from the poisonous blood clots inflicted by Durin, allowed him to be manipulated by the [[Abyss Order]].</p><p>The area is protected by a storm barrier, preventing players from entering until the {{Quest|Hurdle}} is completed.</p>}}

===Mysterious Camp===
[[File:Stormterror's Lair Mysterious Camp.png|thumb|The mysterious camp]]
A mysterious camp is located by the southwestern mountains of Stormterror's Lair, at the top of a tall rock formation.

To reach it, activate the Anemo [[Monument]] guarded by two [[Anemo Samachurl]]s within the nearby {{w|peristyle}}. Activating the Anemo Monument generates two Wind Currents, with which you can glide up to the top of the formation. There, two [[Large Anemo Slime]]s and one [[Eye of the Storm]] will lie in wait.

After defeating all enemies, two Common [[Chest]]s and one Exquisite Chest will be unlocked. There is a sword stuck into the ground in front of a tent, but it cannot be interacted with, leaving the exact origin and purpose of this camp a mystery. The enemies in this area will respawn.
