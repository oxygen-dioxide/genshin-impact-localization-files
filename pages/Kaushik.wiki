:'''Kaushik:''' Ah, so that's how it is. You know what? I think that what this needs is an even more daring hypothesis!
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Kaushik:''' I'm a scholar from [[Sumeru]], and I'm currently researching [[Watatsumi Island]]'s culture and history.
::'''Kaushik:''' I was here before the [[Sakoku Decree]] was declared, and I have remained here till now. In this time, I have discovered huge differences between Watatsumi Island and [[Narukami Island]].
::'''Kaushik:''' For example, have a look at this totem that I dug up from ruins in the wild. Studying these lines and patterns has led me to a marvelous conclusion!
::{{DIcon}} And what are your conclusions?
::'''Kaushik:''' My conclusion is that ancient Inazuma must have played host to two snake gods!
::'''Kaushik:''' [[Orobashi|One of them]] was enjoined with coral and could not move, thus creating [[Sangonomiya Shrine]]. Its true divine form dwelled within [[Enkanomiya]] deep below, forever defending the people of Watatsumi Island.
::'''Kaushik:''' As for the other snake god, it was a most ambitious being that dreamed of invading Narukami Island, but was cut down by the Electro Archon as it was making its way there.
::'''Kaushik:''' See? This totem shows snake patterns with coral on them on one end, and patterns that completely lack them on the other. And that's how you know this is the truth!
::'''Kaushik:''' Very reasonable, is it not? Once I publish my conclusions, I'll be famous! Hahaha!
::{{DIcon}} Are you sure of your conclusions?
::'''Kaushik:''' Of course. A researcher must always persist in their views. For instance, it doesn't matter how much everyone thinks that [[Mondstadt]] only has the [[Four Winds]]. Well, I reckon that there are five!
::'''Kaushik:''' My hypothesis is flawless!
::'''Kaushik:''' [[Mochizuki|That shrine maiden]] at the Sangonomiya Shrine may shake her head at my conclusions, but it is she who has been blinded by her faith.
::'''Kaushik:''' I mean, it's not like she has any evidence to show me herself, does she?
:{{DIcon}} Well, see you around.
::'''Kaushik:''' Goodbye. Ha, my conclusions must be correct!
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* Kaushik's erroneous conclusion about two snake gods is based on Byakuyakoku's worship of two serpent gods: the coral-adorned serpent [[Orobashi]] and the scaleless serpent Ouroboros. However, Ouroboros is just a product of imagination to describe the space phenomenon at [[The Serpent's Heart]],<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|3|Hydrological Studies in Byakuyakoku}}</ref> which invalidates Kaushik's claim.
** Alternatively, the snake with corals represents Orobashi's original appearance, while the snake without corals depicts its appearance after shedding its coral to create Watatsumi Island.
* Kaushik's "five Four Winds" theory is derived from a Chinese and Japanese internet meme that roughly translates to {{lang|"The five members of the Four Heavenly Kings"|zh=四天王有五人}}. It parodies a recurring theme in East Asian cultures where famous legendary and/or historical group names include a certain number of members, but the actual number of members adds one more.<ref>Moegirl Wiki: [https://zh.moegirl.org.cn/%E5%9B%9B%E5%A4%A9%E7%8E%8B#%E5%9B%9B%E5%A4%A9%E7%8E%8B%E6%9C%89%E4%BA%94%E4%BA%BA 四天王 § 四天王有五人]</ref>

===Etymology===
