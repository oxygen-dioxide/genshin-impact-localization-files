'''Haniyyah''' is an event-exclusive [[NPC]] that appeared in [[Fabulous Fungus Frenzy]].

==Profile==
Haniyyah is a famous professional beast tamer in [[Sumeru]]. In her youth, she grew to despise [[fungus|fungi]] due to regularly hearing stories about her ancestors nearly getting killed by a group of berserk fungi. She used to work for the [[Eremites]] training [[Sumpter Beast|Sumpter Beasts]] as beasts of burden. Due to her expertise, she was hired by the organizers of the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament to test the capabilities of the [[Wisdom Orb]], where she acquired a [[Whirling Pyro Fungus]] and initially called it "Pyro-1". She then fought the [[Traveler]] in the finals but ultimately lost to them.

After [[Paimon]] and the Traveler took over as hosts of the tournament, following [[Elchingen]]'s arrest, Haniyyah took the domesticated [[fungus|fungi]] and the competitors' Wisdom Orbs for safekeeping until the next tournament.

===Personality===
Haniyyah used to be a happy and energetic person who wore her heart on her sleeve, and never had the slightest intention of hiding her emotions. She is extremely passionate about beast taming and would only charge for a small fee.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Thabit}}</ref> She dislikes people who disregards the dangers of wild monsters and think that they can be easily domesticated, such as Elchingen. She is very headstrong and committed to her beliefs, especially about Fungi being inherently dangerous, but is willing to accept and change her view when [[Yae Miko]] tells her the truth about her village's history.

===Appearance===
Haniyyah takes the appearance of an [[Eremite Axe Vanguard]] with pink hair.
