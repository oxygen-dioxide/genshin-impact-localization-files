'''Haniyyah''' is an event-exclusive [[NPC]] that first appeared in [[Fabulous Fungus Frenzy]].

==Profile==
Haniyyah is a famous professional beast tamer in [[Sumeru]]. In her youth, she grew to despise [[fungus|fungi]] due to regularly hearing stories about her ancestors nearly getting killed by a group of berserk fungi. She used to work for the [[Eremites]] training [[Sumpter Beast]]s as beasts of burden. Due to her expertise, she was hired by the organizers of the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament to test the capabilities of the [[Wisdom Orb]], where she acquired a [[Whirling Pyro Fungus]] and initially called it "Pyro-1". She then fought the [[Traveler]] in the finals but ultimately lost to them.

After [[Paimon]] and the Traveler took over as hosts of the tournament, following [[Elchingen]]'s arrest, Haniyyah took the domesticated fungi and the competitors' Wisdom Orbs for safekeeping until the next tournament.

Haniyyah would later head to [[Fontaine]] in order to find investors for an official tournament and increase awareness of the positive aspects of fungi. 

===Appearance===
Haniyyah takes the appearance of an [[Eremite Axe Vanguard]] with pink hair.
