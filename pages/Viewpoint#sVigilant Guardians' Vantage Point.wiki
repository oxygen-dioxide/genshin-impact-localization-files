|text    = The inn that stands at the southern end of Dihua Marsh seems to serve as something other than a resting place for guests. They say that Wangshu Inn is a haven for lovers' moonlit rendezvous. Folk stories also have it that even ones as august as the adepti sometimes bask in the moonlight here.
