|description     = A true blue Fontinalia Festival snack.
|desc_suspicious = That said, a true tragedy seems to have befallen this serving, reminding one of nothing so much as a Cryo Whopperflower... Are you sure the Lakelight Lilies in this one weren't, in truth, Whopperflowers? Uh, best you get rid of this on the down low... serving a dish like this during the festival might just be a chargeable offense!
|desc_basic      = This mousse is shaped in the image of the Lakelight Lily's bud. After the Festival's customs were changed to align more with dessert delectation, it quickly came to be a much-favored Fontainian food favorite. Don't forget to share them with all the trial-or-treaters who come your way!
|desc_delicious  = Its crystalline coloration would not be ashamed if compared to the light scattering off the rippling waves. Its featherweight elegance is like that of falling petals, its airy texture like a snowflake melting in your throat. To eat such a delicacy must surely be the loveliest thing that could happen during the Festival!
