==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Dip Yeuk:''' Urgh... Horse stance is pure pain to maintain... C'mon, legs! Hang in there! Three more hours!
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
::'''Dip Yeuk:''' How exhausting... but I'll grit my teeth and keep training!
::'''Dip Yeuk:''' Just like [[Gaming]] says, one second on stage is the result of ten years of off-stage training.
::'''Dip Yeuk:''' If I don't train hard, my punches will hit like wet noodles and I might trip over my own spear or stab myself with my sword in battle. It'll be too late for regrets then!
:{{DIcon}} Are you one of the guards for hire here?
::'''Dip Yeuk:''' Ah, right! Gotta be honest with you, I'm still new here at the [[Secure Transport Agency]], and my kung fu still isn't up to snuff. I gotta practice, slowly improve myself...
::'''Dip Yeuk:''' Oh, other than guarding transports, I'm also the drummer of the [[Mighty Mythical Beasts]]. No worries, though, Gaming's walked me through it, and I've been practicing the basics every day...
::'''Dip Yeuk:''' If you've got some time to spare, you gotta come see it! We've got nothin' but 5-star reviews from everyone in town!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Dip Yeuk:''' Ugh, so tiring... How the heck did he manage to keep going...?
