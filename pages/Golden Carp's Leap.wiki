'''Golden Carp's Leap''' is an exploration mechanic in [[Chenyu Vale]], [[Liyue]]. 

The player gains access to it after receiving [[Fujin]]'s [[Adeptus|adeptal]] power in the {{Quest|Qiaoying of the Sacred Mountain}}.

Completing a certain Golden Carp's Leap puzzle grants the {{Achievement|The Carp Leaps, Heaven's Gates Open}}.

==Overview==
When a Golden Carp's Leap water droplet is within the player's field of vision, they can press the "Interaction in Certain Gameplay Modes" [[keybind]] or button to quickly travel to its location. The player then enters Aiming Mode, where they can press the [[Normal Attack]] button to launch themselves in any direction, or use the Interact button to travel to another nearby droplet.

Players can eject themselves from the droplet by holding [[Jump]], but travel cannot be canceled partway. Golden Carp's Leap cannot be used while [[swimming]].
