{{Description|You think that's cold? Guess you've never been to [[w:c:horizon:The Cut|The Cut]].}}
'''Frozen Wilds''' is [[Aloy]]'s [[Elemental Skill]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* {{Talent Note|particles|5}}
*The freeze bomb generates '''6''' Chillwater Bomblets.
* Most skills with a [[Vacuum Field|vacuum field]] effect will pull the Chillwater Bomblets inward. Notable exceptions include [[Venti]]'s [[Wind's Grand Ode]] and [[The Viridescent Hunt]]'s passive effect.
* Aloy can gain Coil stacks and enter the Rushing Ice state even when she is off-field. The special visual effects when gaining Coil stacks and entering the Rushing Ice state will appear regardless of who the active character is.
* The numbers that indicate how many Coil stacks Aloy has will only appear if Aloy is the active character and "SFX Quality" [[Settings#Graphics|Graphics setting]] is no lower than "Low." This is in contrast to other numbers, such as from [[Husk of Opulent Dreams]] and [[Yanfei's Normal Attack]], which show up even when the "SFX Quality" setting is set to "Lowest."
