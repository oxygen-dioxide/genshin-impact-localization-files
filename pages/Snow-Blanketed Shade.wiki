|description    = A tree that can be commonly found in Qiaoying Village. It is leafy, lush, and crowned with white flowers.<br>They say that the flowers of these trees have special medicinal properties, which is why they're important components of certain potions. At the same time, the scene of this tree in full bloom is like a blanket of snow, hence its name.
