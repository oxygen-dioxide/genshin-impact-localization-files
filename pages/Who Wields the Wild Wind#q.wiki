==Notes==
<!-- Any notes that will help complete the quest -->
* The mountains are covered in enemies, but only the [[Samachurls]] on the top of the mountains need to be defeated for the quest, every other enemy can be ignored.
* More enemies may spawn in an area once the Samachurl is defeated, these can be ignored as well but it's best to be careful of being hit off the mountain.
* Two of the mountaintops also have one [[Common Chest]], while the third is a [[Exquisite Chest]]. All three chests are protected by a red ring and all enemies in the area must defeat to unlock them.
* Finishing the quest unlocks a [[Luxurious Chest]].

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|No one knows why, but this island seems to be forever affected by strange weather conditions...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Upon nearing the location)
:'''Paimon:''' The weather here's so weird. It doesn't seem natural.
----
;(Upon arriving at the location)
:'''Paimon:''' There's a chest here? Looks like it's locked.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, these three mountains are kinda bothering Paimon...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's climb them and see what we can find out.
----
;(Upon climbing to the first mountaintop)
:'''Paimon:''' ...Samachurls? And so many other monsters too. What are they doing on this mountain?
:'''Paimon:''' Does that sealed chest and the weird weather around here have something to do with them?
----
;(Upon defeating all 3 Samachurls)
:'''Paimon:''' The weather looks fine too, now that we've beaten those monsters...
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like that sealed chest and the weather on this island really do have something to do with these monsters...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. Well, let's go back and check that chest out.
----
;(Upon arriving at the location)
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, where did this guy come from? K&mdash;Keep it back!
----
;(Upon defeating the Stonehide Lawachurl)
:'''Paimon:''' That was quite a load of work just to open one chest...
:'''Paimon:''' Phew... finally got the chest open.
