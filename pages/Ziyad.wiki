:'''Ziyad:''' Hah. That's not gonna keep me down. Just you watch, just you wait!
:{{DIcon}} What did you do?
::'''Ziyad:''' You here to punish me as well? Well, I'm your guy, Ziyad, and I'm not afraid of you!
::'''Ziyad:''' I'll just say this first &mdash; I'm not going to apologize no matter what!
:{{DIcon}} You should behave yourself.
::'''Ziyad:''' Pah! Grown-ups are such a pain. All they know is punishing people... And it's not like their reasons are ever any different. I'm always too naughty for them.
::'''Ziyad:''' They did wrong in the first place. I'm just standing up for what's right!
::'''Ziyad:''' I mean, you tell me: would you be sad if your father made your mother cry?
::{{DIcon}} I would.
:::'''Ziyad:''' I know, right? That's why I put a bug in my dad's trousers &mdash; for justice! Seriously, on what basis are they scolding me, huh?
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Ziyad:''' Yeah, see you. I'm gonna be out here for a bit &mdash; I'll go home once my dad stops being mad.
