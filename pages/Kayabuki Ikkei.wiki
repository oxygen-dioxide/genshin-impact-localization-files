==Event Dialogue==
===Hyakunin Ikki/2022-03-18===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' Hey, how's it going?
:{{DIcon}} About the novel you were writing...
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' I grew up reading storybooks and novels, and back then, I dreamed of becoming like [[Iwakura Doukei|Iwakura]] or [[Kitain Bunsou|Kitain]], an unparalleled warrior and slayer of demons.
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' I only realized that I lacked that talent after I'd grown up. That's why I decided to write stories about warriors instead. The art of making lines of words shine is a martial art in and of itself, wouldn't you say?
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' I mean, I could've still have chosen to become an attaché to some military officer, but I must say that I'd prefer penning the tale of a carefree outland warrior like yourself.
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' I've written your performance in the last Hyakunin Ikki down. The [[Hyakunin Ikki/2022-03-18/Story#Kayabuki Ikkei.27s Novel Manuscript|draft]] has been sent to the Yae Publishing House for review... Wonder how it's going...
:{{DIcon}} About what happened before...
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' Your performance in the last Hyakunin Ikki was fabulous!
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' Even [[Shousen]], the master of Shinryuu, could have never imagined such a doughty martial artist like you...
:{{DIcon}} About the Hyakunin Ikki...
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' In the early days, this was a mysterious rite used by the Tengu-Kin as a means of making a ruckus.
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' Even after they were banned, people would still sometimes organize it in secret. The organizers' identities are still shrouded in mystery.
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' It's a rather rowdy brawl, all things considered. Anyone can participate, mortal or monster.
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' That's got to be a dream come true for those who long for battle, eh?

===Hues of the Violet Garden===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' "Outlander Brigade," the latest trailblazer in Inazuman light literature, has just made its debut. Wanna have a look?
:{{DIcon}} "Outlander Brigade"?
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' That's right! Striking name, eh? Don't worry, the text itself reads just as well as it sounds like it might!
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' Trust me, this series is going to be a big hit for sure!
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' At the moment, "When the Wind of Death Blew Towards the Blond Samurai" is just the first volume in the series. As for the second and third volumes, I already have some ideas for their names...
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' The second shall be named "The Fatal Flowery Blade," and the third, "Blond Samurai, Go With the Wind."
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' Heh, I guess you could call me a prodigious talent in naming things.
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' That said, I haven't decided on what to write exactly... although that's not really important at the moment.
:{{DIcon}} How are sales?
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' ...
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' None at the moment.
::{{DIcon}} Not a single one?
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' ...
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' Well... yes.
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' That said, I believe that this state is only temporary. I mean, even the most famous authors were unknown once.
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' Such dilemmas are just like the martial training written about in the books &mdash; a test of one's heart and character. As such, I must persevere...
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' One day, my works will be acknowledged by the world at large!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' See you around!
::'''Kayabuki Ikkei:''' Wait a moment &mdash; you're not going to buy a copy after all that?
