{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Remande:''' Once we're done preparing the film, we can continue taking boat-tos!
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Remande knows)
:::'''Remande:''' Er... Does "the [[Pruniere|aquabus repairman]] might've been put in a bad mood by my many questions" count?
:::'''Remande:''' I'm kidding! The [[Pruniere|repairman]] was great. He told me that there's a place nearby that produces [[Condessence Crystal]]s and [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore]], which I can use to make models.
:::'''Remande:''' That said, I don't think I'd be any good at excavation by hand &mdash; might be better to just buy the ore pre-processed. But if you have need of them, you can check the place out.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Remande knows)
:::'''Remande:''' Not that I remember... Certainly not anything worth taking pictures of.
:{{DIcon}} Boat-tos?
::'''Remande:''' Boat-tos! Photos of boats. Boats, photos &mdash; by which I mean pictures of the aquabuses.
::'''Remande:''' I absolutely adore the aquabus network &mdash; really, I'd take a picture of every last detail if I could.
::'''Remande:''' My dream is to someday recreate a scale clockwork model of an aquabus without needing to refer to the real object, or even pictures of it.
::'''Remande:''' At this moment, I've reached the phase where I'm taking photos daily, and familiarizing myself with them. Wish me well, friend!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Sounds impressive.
::'''Remande:''' Of course it does! If you are interested as well, you are welcome to join us aquabus enthusiasts.
::'''Remande:''' However, I have a few reminders for newcomers.
::'''Remande:''' While admiring the aquabuses, do not behave in any way that might interfere with the normal functioning of aquabus facilities or disturb the tour guides on the aquabuses.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Teachings of Order|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Remande:''' See you &mdash; be sure to take a trip onboard yourself!
