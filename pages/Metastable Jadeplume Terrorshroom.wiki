{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = Dendro Shield
|desc_1      = Upon starting the battle, the Jadeplume Terrorshroom gains a {{Dendro}} [[Shield/Enemy|shield]], which grants it increased RES while active. The shield can be destroyed using [[Elemental Reaction]]s, and is weakest to {{Electro}}. Unless the Jadeplume Terrorshroom is paralyzed, it will refresh its shield after it is destroyed. It will also refresh the shield after recovering from paralysis or using '''Volatile Spore Cloud'''.

The Jadeplume Terrorshroom can only enter the Scorched state once every '''18''' seconds. While Scorched, creates a large spore cloud around itself which deals '''6% ATK''' as {{Color|Dendro DMG}} to players within it every '''0.3''' seconds. The Jadeplume Terrorshroom then produces sparks from its beak to ignite the cloud, causing an explosion and two subsequent shockwaves that expand outward, each dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Dendro DMG}}. Also briefly imbues itself with {{Dendro}} when the cloud explodes. After this attack, refreshes its shield and exits the Scorched state.
