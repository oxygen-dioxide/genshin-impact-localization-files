==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ismenor:''' Good evening. Are you out here on a stroll as well?
:{{DIcon}} The night views are quite nice.
::'''Ismenor:''' Haha, well now, that's not something you see every day &mdash; a young person with the same tastes as a retiree like myself.
::'''Ismenor:''' The young lads and lasses are all like this continuously-moving statue in the middle of the plaza.
::'''Ismenor:''' They're full of energy, yet they often know not what they do anything for.
::'''Ismenor:''' Forgive my pessimism &mdash; it might be on account of my past as a Champion Duelist.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Champion Duelists...
::'''Ismenor:''' It is a profession that exists to maintain dignity, yet lives alongside conflict.
::'''Ismenor:''' Suspects who do not believe that they should have to stand trial will request a duel to defend their reputation.
::'''Ismenor:''' Only concession or expiry can end a duel, and there are few who can defeat official Champion Duelists.
::'''Ismenor:''' So I doubt it would be hard for you to imagine what happens to such suspects.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Ismenor:''' Farewell.
