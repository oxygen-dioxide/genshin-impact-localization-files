|description  = A strange cartilaginous fish that was once thought to be a fantastical creature, only recorded in some ancient scrolls of art on [[Watatsumi Island]]. As the seal over [[Enkanomiya]] was opened, their true forms were laid bare before the eyes of all.<br />It is said that the bodily forms of these curious creatures will change color as time passes. When they are young, they are as gold as sunlight. Rays at this stage of life earned the name "Divda" in those ancient scrolls, which means "the tail end of innocence."

==Trivia==
* While the description states that the name "Divda" means "the tail end of innocence," the name is based on the star {{Lang|{{w|Diphda}}|ar=<wbr>|ar_lit=frog}} from its Arabic name {{Lang|"the second frog"|ar=ضفدع الثاني}}.
** The meaning of "tail" comes from its other Arabic name, {{Lang|"the southern tail of {{w|Cetus}}"|ar=الذنب القيتوس الجنوب}} which gives the alternate English name Deneb Kaitos.
** The "first frog" is {{w|Fomalhaut}}, from which the name of the [[Formalo Ray]] is derived.
