===Dialogue Set #1===
Available prior to completing {{Quest|Both Brains and Brawn}}.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Roussimoff:''' Have you come to the ring to work up a sweat, too? Respect!
:{{DIcon}} About [[Pankration]]...
::'''Roussimoff:''' It's a very healthy sport!
::'''Roussimoff:''' If you ask me, you really lose out by being the host! Sure, you get the best seat in the house, but do you think I want to just be watching?
::'''Roussimoff:''' I want to get in the ring too, and go head-to-head with the best opponents!
::'''Roussimoff:''' Though when I say it like that, it does seem to lack a bit of theatricality, which hand-to-hand combat only has so much of in the first place. I'll have to come up with some other limitations...
:{{DIcon}} About the Fortress of Meropide...
::'''Roussimoff:''' Heh, it's more my speed than the [[Court of Fontaine: Fleuve Cendre|Fleuve Cendre]] is.
::'''Roussimoff:''' It's not that the Fleuve Cendre's bad, I just prefer it here. No matter how you look at it, the Fleuve Cendre just doesn't have any arenas as big as this one.
:{{DIcon}} I'm just looking around. See you.
::'''Roussimoff:''' See ya!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
Available after completing {{Quest|Both Brains and Brawn}}.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Roussimoff:''' Oho, if it isn't the coach! Here to scope out potential fighters to take under your wing?
:{{DIcon}} About Pankration...
::'''Roussimoff:''' It's a very healthy sport!
::'''Roussimoff:''' If you ask me, you really lose out by being the host! Sure, you get the best seat in the house, but do you think I want to be just watching?
::'''Roussimoff:''' I want to get in the ring too, and go head-to-head with the best opponents!
::'''Roussimoff:''' Though when I say it like that, it does seem to lack a bit of theatricality, which hand-to-hand combat only has so much of in the first place. I'll have to come up with some other limitations...
::'''Roussimoff:''' But on the other hand, we've been holding quite a few recreational matches recently. Maybe it's time to get back to the roots? Yeah, it's worth giving some serious thought.
:{{DIcon}} About the Fonta sponsorship...
::'''Roussimoff:''' I'm not a fan of Fonta, it's too sweet. Pure Water, on the other hand, is pretty decent. Too bad the supply's unreliable.
::'''Roussimoff:''' That Heinry's a good kid, though. As you know, the majority of people here have hit rock bottom... literally or figuratively, haha.
::'''Roussimoff:''' If you bring a little sweetness into people's lives at a time like that, they'll never forget it once they turn over a new leaf and get out of this place. Don't you think?
:{{DIcon}} About the Fortress of Meropide...
::'''Roussimoff:''' Heh, it's more my speed than the [[Court of Fontaine: Fleuve Cendre|Fleuve Cendre]] is.
::'''Roussimoff:''' It's not that the Fleuve Cendre's bad, I just prefer it here. No matter how you look at it, the Fleuve Cendre just doesn't have any arenas as big as this one.
