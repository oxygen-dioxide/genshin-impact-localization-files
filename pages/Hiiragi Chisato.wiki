==Profile==
Hiiragi Chisato is the daughter of [[Hiiragi Shinsuke]], the leader of the [[Hiiragi Clan]] which leads the [[Kanjou Commission]] in [[Ritou]]. When the Traveler and Paimon arrived at her residence to look for a way out of Ritou, she secretly offered to help them escape in exchange for delivering her letter to [[Kujou Kamaji]], her lover.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Ritou Escape Plan}}</ref> She asked for the Traveler's help because her father is against her relationship with the son of the [[Kujou Clan]].

The [[Kujou Clan]] and the [[Hiiragi Clan]] are leaders of the [[Tri-Commission]]. So, both families are political enemies that must keep each other in check to keep the balance within Inazuma's government.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Wind Settles}}</ref> Considering the relationship between the two families, their marriage would have a lot of political influence.  In fact, Kujou Kamaji admits that someone might take advantage of their situation. So, to reply to Chisato's message, Kamaji sends a [[Snack Box]] which he claims to be a simple public relations gesture.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Chisato's Letter}}</ref>

Following the unraveling of the Fatui plot, Chisato was left as the figurehead of the Kanjou Commission. Due to her inexperience, some of the clan's retainers sought to remove her to claim the commissioner's spot by penning a false love letter to Kamaji suggesting that they get married.  The marriage would cause her to be absorbed into the Kujou clan and lose all influence in the Hiiragi clan. However, the plot was foiled by the Traveler and the Yashiro Commissioner, [[Kamisato Ayato]]. The plot's catastrophic failure led to Chisato assuming a more serious stance in the commission's affairs.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Firmiana Leaf Falls}}</ref> Furthermore, their plans for marriage has been postponed indefinitely and the marriage announcements has been treated as false information.<ref>{{Ref/BB|Hanamizaka Bulletin Board|Delayed Matrimonial Ceremonies}}</ref>

===Personality===
Hiiragi Chisato is in love with Kamaji and takes willful actions to attempt to send him a letter, even attempting to deceive her father and Kanjou Commission soldiers to smuggle the Traveler and her letter out of Ritou. Despite her father's strictness with her, she still worries about his condition after the Fatui collusion was revealed but still she believes everyone, including her father, must be held accountable for their actions.

After attempting to be pawned off to the Kujou Clan, Chisato became more assertive to ensure loyalty in the commission.

===Appearance===
Hiiragi Chisato wears a simple blue kimono with a pink flower pattern.

::'''Hiiragi Chisato:''' Thankfully, everyone's been quite willing to listen to my suggestions, so I can start from the simplest matters and slowly sort everything out from there.
