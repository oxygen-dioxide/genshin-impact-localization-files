|description    = Amidst the blue-pink grasslands of [[Watatsumi Island]], the lilac splash of paint that is this lovely tree is especially memorable, and indeed it seems even lovelier still against such a backdrop. Despite the impression they give, however, these trees grow into their set shape during early winter. When they first show their vibrant color, a special layer of wax grows over the surface of the leaves, preserving their "lilac" hue for good. The dew that condenses on these leaves is also exceptionally crystal clear. The fairy tale "[[Specters]] and Strong Tea" also mentions that the dew on such leaves is a Specter's favorite drink.
