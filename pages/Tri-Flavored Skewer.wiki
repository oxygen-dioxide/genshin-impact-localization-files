|desc_suspicious = The burnt bamboo stick and the dull-colored ingredients give off a smell that must not be named. If you were to make this out in the wild, you might just attract some hilichurls...
|desc_basic      = Three different cooking processes can be tasted at a go in this dish, which has made it very popular. If you are ever at a loss at to what to pair with some wine, there's no going wrong with one of these.
|desc_delicious  = The highly-refined temperature control has released sizzling blooms of oils. The many seasonings accentuate the flavor of the various ingredients. If there was but a little less of them, it would be too plain; if a little more, too dense. This keen balance reveals the craftsman's heart within the chef.
