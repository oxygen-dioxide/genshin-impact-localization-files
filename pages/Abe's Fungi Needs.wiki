===Day 1===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Pick up the Fluorescent Fungus)
:'''Abe:''' Hey! I'm over here, you know?
:'''Abe:''' Young people these days... Don't you kids have any kind of courtesy at all?
:{{DIcon}} S&mdash;Sorry!
::'''Abe:''' Hmph! That's more like it. As for those mushrooms, let's just call that my gift... But don't you touch the rest however you like!
:{{DIcon}} Are these your mushrooms?
::'''Abe:''' None of your business! Just stop picking them however you like and get out of here!
:'''Paimon:''' Eek! That guy just now... Did you see that!?
:{{DIcon}} Nope.
:{{DIcon}} Must've been an illusion.
:'''Paimon:''' Uhh, that's just too spooky. Let's just grab a few mushrooms and get out of here, shall we?
{{Dialogue end}}

===Day 3===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Pick up the Fluorescent Fungus again)
:'''Abe:''' Hey! Hey! Didn't I warn you lot before!? Are you hard of hearing, or do you just not have eyes, huh?
:{{DIcon}} Oh, look, a ghost!
:'''Abe:''' Eek! Ghost? Where? Where!?
:{{DIcon}} Right here.
:{{DIcon}} That's me!
:'''Abe:''' Aaaagh! Go! Shoo! Evil begone! By my clan's name, Abe, depart from this place!
:'''Abe:''' ...What? N&mdash;No! That can't be! I've... I've never encountered such a wicked spirit in all my years! Wh&mdash;Why aren't you leaving?
:{{DIcon}} Why, I've come from beyond this island.
:'''Abe:''' A evil spirit from beyond the Sea of Fog? I&mdash;I'm not afraid of you! Just you wait! Th&mdash;The Great Thunderbird will exorcise you!
:{{DIcon}} Your Thunderbird is long gone.
:{{DIcon}} The Sea of Fog is a thing of the past.
:'''Abe:''' Wh&mdash;What did you say?
:{{DIcon}} Everyone's left
:{{DIcon}} It's time to leave.
:'''Abe:''' What... What are you saying? D&mdash;Don't you try to scare me like that. Ohhh, I&mdash;I'm getting goosebumps already...
:'''Abe:''' Still, there have been less and less people on the island lately. Kina also told me that everyone was getting onboard the boat... *sigh* Who knows where that kid's run off to now...
:'''Abe:''' Wait a moment. Spirit from beyond this island... Aren't you leaving too? On the silver boat by the seashore?
:{{DIcon}} I saw no boat there.
:{{DIcon}} That ship was not made to bear me hence.
:'''Abe:''' Huh... I knew it. I knew outsiders wouldn't be able to see that boat.
:'''Abe:''' Still, thanks for telling me to get onboard, evil spirit. It's... It's just that I've lived here for so long, and yet there's so much I still haven't seen or done... I can't just leave this place!
:{{DIcon}} What will you need?
:'''Abe:''' Need? Eh? I mean, it's not as if I need anything. I'd just like to see something new, you know?
:'''Abe:''' Once, when I was still very young, I made a bet with Una that there were different kinds of mushrooms outside our island, but she wouldn't believe me.
:'''Abe:''' Later, her husband went out to sea, leaving for lands where the outsiders live. He never returned, and they say his spirit wanders the lands beyond... Poor guy.
:'''Abe:''' Una's been living alone ever since then. Every time I think about it, I... *sigh*
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry about her too much.
:{{DIcon}} So about the mushrooms...
:'''Abe:''' I even begged the priest, you know? At the very least, we had to give someone a place to stay... Ah, right, right! The mushrooms!
:'''Abe:''' *cough* Well, I'll be boarding the boat soon, and I don't really have that many regrets... I just haven't seen anything that lies beyond our island. Still, that which concerns me most has to be those mushrooms I take care of every day...
:'''Abe:''' Please, help me bring back some mushrooms from beyond the Sea of Fog. I'd love to see what they look like!",
:'''Abe:''' Please help me, evil outsider spirit!

;(Talk to Abe again)
:'''Abe:''' How's it going? I'm ready and waiting to have my horizons broadened!
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Will these mushrooms do for you?
::(Open inventory)
:'''Abe:''' Ooh! Haha... Wow, they've got such odd shapes! Do they have souls, too? Do they contain peoples' memories?
:'''Abe:''' And these soft, wing-like things... Can they fly?
:'''Abe:''' Ah, me and my endless curiosity! The boatman's getting annoyed now, I think. I'm sorry, but I reckon I must go. Yes, I must...
