{{Weapons by Category Table|type=Primordial Jade Series}}

==Lore==
Each weapon in this series relates to a story of a weapon or object [[Morax]] crafted from jade, used in battle during the [[Archon War]].

{{Lang|[[Primordial Jade Cutter]]|zh=磐岩结绿|zh_rm=Pányán Jiélǜ|zh_tl={{w|Monolith}} of Solidified Green}} is a sword made from a piece of nephrite called ''Jielü''. It was originally created as a gift for a certain someone, for the sake of peace and prosperity. However, this never came to pass as a result of the Archon War, and Morax instead wielded it in battle.

{{Lang|[[Primordial Jade Winged-Spear]]|zh=和璞鸢|zh_rm=Hépú Yuān|zh_tl=The {{w|Kite (bird)|Kite}} of {{w|Mr. He's jade|''He''}}'s Jade}} recounts the story of a jade hawk created by Morax to battle against the sea monster {{Lang|Baqiu|zh=八虬|zh_rm=Bāqiú}} after the creature was able to withstand even his Geo Whale. The bird plunged into the ocean like a spear, where it successfully subdued Baqiu and caused it to sink to the bottom of the ocean.

==Trivia==
*In the Chinese names and descriptions for the weapons in this series, each weapon is named after the piece of jade used to create it. The names of the jades are derived from a line in the {{Lang|Strategies of the Warring States|zh=战国策}}, which ascribes a fine jade to each of the dynasties during China's Warring States period.<ref>Chinese Texts: [https://ctext.org/zhan-guo-ce/fan-zi-yin-wang-ji-ru-qin/zhs Strategies of the Warring States: The Strategy of the Qin]<br />{{zh|臣闻周有砥厄，宋有结绿，梁有悬黎，楚有和璞。}}</ref> The English translation removes all reference to the names of the jades.
**Primordial Jade Cutter's {{Lang|''Jielü''|zh=结绿|zh_rm=Jiélǜ}} is associated with the {{w|Song (state)|State of Song}}.
**Primordial Jade Winged-Spear's {{Lang|''Hepu''|zh=和璞|zh_rm=Hépú}} is associated with the {{w|Chu (state)|State of Chu}}.
