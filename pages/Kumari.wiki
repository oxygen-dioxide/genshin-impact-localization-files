:'''Kumari:''' I would like to become a dancer as good as [[Nilou]] when I grow up!
:{{DIcon}} About dancing...
::'''Kumari:''' Why won't Dad let me learn to dance...?
::'''Kumari:''' He said dancing was looked down upon in [[Sumeru]]. To live a better life, I should go to school instead of learning how to dance.

::'''Kumari:''' Every time I see Nilou, she would smile and let me touch the jewelry on her head.
::'''Kumari:''' The [[Sabzeruz Festival]] is my favorite holiday. I can get candies from the Knight of Flowers, and I can watch Nilou's dance that day!
::{{DIcon|Reward}}  I can't wait either.
:::'''Kumari:''' Then be sure not to miss it! Hope you'll have a chance to enjoy Nilou's dance and try the best sweets!
::; (Obtain [[Sugar]] ×4)
