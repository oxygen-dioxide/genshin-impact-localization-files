:{{DIcon}} About dancing...
::'''Kumari:''' Why won't Dad let me learn to dance...?
::'''Kumari:''' He said dancing was looked down upon in [[Sumeru]]. To live a better life, I should go to school instead of learning how to dance.

::'''Kumari:''' The [[Sabzeruz Festival]] is my favorite holiday. I can get candies from the Knight of Flowers, and I can watch Nilou's dance that day!
::{{DIcon|Reward}}  I can't wait either.
:::'''Kumari:''' Then be sure not to miss it! Hope you'll have a chance to enjoy Nilou's dance and try the best sweets!
