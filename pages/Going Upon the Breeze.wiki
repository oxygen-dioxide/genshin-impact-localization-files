{{Quest Description|The girl's name is Amber, and her duty as an Outrider is to escort you to Mondstadt. However, she has another task to attend to first, which is to clean out the hilichurls that have been wandering around outside the city.}}

;(Upon spotting a hilichurl)
:{{A|vo mdaq017 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! A {{Color|buzzword|hilichurl}}!
:{{A|vo mdaq017 1 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Quick! Get it!
:;(After defeating the hilichurl)
:{{A|vo mdaq017 2 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' These monsters have been getting too close to the city recently.
:{{A|vo mdaq017 2 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' My task this time is to clear out their {{Color|buzzword|camp}}.

;(After clearing the camp)
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Heh, nothing to it.
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Though I've gotta say, you surprised me a little with your moves there...
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Thanks for the backup. How'd it feel?
:{{DIcon}} Barely broke a sweat.
:{{DIcon}} Those things are tougher than they look.
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Now that you mention it, how is it the hilichurls ended up here?
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' These creatures don't seem like the type to set up camp so close to cities like this.
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 ambor 04.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Exactly. It's more normal for them to be much further out in the wilderness.
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 ambor 05.ogg}} '''Amber:''' But because the dragon &mdash; Stormterror &mdash; has been around a lot more recently, our orchards have been destroyed and the local market has been affected as well.
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 ambor 06.ogg}} '''Amber:''' When the storms hit, we usually end up with at least a few injuries, so the Knights of Favonius have been tied up doing the best they can to defend the area.
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So these annoying creatures have been getting closer and closer to the city?
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 ambor 07.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Exactly. That said, clearing this camp helped make the area a little bit safer.
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 ambor 08.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Come with me! A responsible knight must make sure to see you to the city safely.
