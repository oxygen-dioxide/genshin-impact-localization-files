{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Upon spotting a hilichurl)
:{{A|vo mdaq017 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! A {{Color|buzzword|hilichurl}}!
:{{A|vo mdaq017 1 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Quick! Get it!
:;(After defeating the hilichurl)
:{{A|vo mdaq017 2 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' These monsters have been getting too close to the city recently.
:{{A|vo mdaq017 2 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' My task this time is to clear out their {{Color|buzzword|camp}}.
----
;(After clearing the camp)
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Heh, nothing to it.
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Though I've gotta say, you surprised me a little with your moves there...
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Thanks for the backup. How'd it feel?
:{{DIcon}} Barely broke a sweat.
:{{DIcon}} Those things are tougher than they look.
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Now that you mention it, how is it the hilichurls ended up here?
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' These creatures don't seem like the type to set up camp so close to cities like this.
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 ambor 04.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Exactly. It's more normal for them to be much further out in the wilderness.
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 ambor 05.ogg}} '''Amber:''' But because the dragon &mdash; Stormterror &mdash; has been around a lot more recently, our orchards have been destroyed and the local market has been affected as well.
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 ambor 06.ogg}} '''Amber:''' When the storms hit, we usually end up with at least a few injuries, so the Knights of Favonius have been tied up doing the best they can to defend the area.
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So these annoying creatures have been getting closer and closer to the city?
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 ambor 07.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Exactly. That said, clearing this camp helped make the area a little bit safer.
:{{A|vo mdaq017 3 ambor 08.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Come with me! A responsible knight must make sure to see you to the city safely.
