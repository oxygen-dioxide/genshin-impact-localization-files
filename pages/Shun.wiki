==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Shun is a bandit who has been good friends with [[Hiromi]] and [[Yan'er]] since they were kids. He often goes treasure hunting with Yan'er. Hiromi eventually became a Shogunate soldier, much to both of their disgust, although Shun knew that Hiromi had options to choose from unlike him.

At some point while treasure hunting in Liyue, he and Yan'er were chased by the [[Guhua Clan|Guhua]] disciples [[Sun Yu]] and [[Little Que'er]]. While they were able to escape, he was separated from Yan'er, but was unable to check in on her and returned to Inazuma through unknown means.

{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Shun:''' If you've got something to say, say it fast. Us [[Treasure Hoarders]], our time's not yours for the wastin'.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here?
::'''Shun:''' What else could it be? I'm one of the Treasure Hoarders, so I'm here for the treasure, of course!
:{{DIcon}} And why won't you go inside?
::'''Shun:''' Are you trying to get me killed? It's dangerous inside!
::{{DIcon}} Well, if someone were to get to treasure first...
:::'''Shun:''' Hah! What I don't know about can't affect my bottom line.
:::'''Shun:''' That's a Treasure Hoarder-patented survival technique!
::{{DIcon}} Jeez...
:::'''Shun:''' Hehe~
{{Dialogue end}}

===After finding him during Hiromi's Watch===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Shun:''' If you've got something to say, say it fast. Us Treasure Hoarders, our time's not yours for the wastin'.
:{{DIcon}} So, about Hiromi...
::'''Shun:''' Ah, he's a good lad... But he's a big baby, too. He needs a bit more time to grow.
::'''Shun:''' So I say, but in the end, being immature is better than being evil.
::'''Shun:''' He has his livelihood and his responsibilities...
::'''Shun:''' It's not all his fault either that he's scared to make choices.
::'''Shun:''' At least he's still got some choices to make.
