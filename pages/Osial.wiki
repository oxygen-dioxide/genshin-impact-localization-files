'''Osial''', also called '''That Which Lies in the Deep''', is an ancient [[god]] and sea monster that was defeated by [[Rex Lapis]] during the [[Archon War]] two thousand years ago. He was defeated at [[Guyun Stone Forest]], where Rex Lapis pinned Osial to the ocean floor using his stone spears.<ref name="roald">{{Ref/Book|Diary of Roald the Adventurer|6|Guyun Stone Forest}}</ref>

==Profile==
At the height of his power, Osial was a powerful god during the Archon War who came to blows with Morax, the God of Geo. He was capable of creating tsunamis as tall as [[Liyue]]'s mountains.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Monolith Fragment}}</ref> Even after two thousand years of being sealed, Osial was powerful enough to withstand the attacks of three [[adepti]] and retaliate to destroy the replica [[Guizhong Ballista]]s. At some point in time, Osial "married" [[Beisht]].

===Appearance===
After being reawakened by [[Childe]], he takes the form of a five-headed hydra with a body made of water.

==Story==
===History===
Very little is known about Osial's history. [[Zhongli]] refers to their conflict as an "ancient grudge,"<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Record of All Things}}<br />
'''Zhongli:''' Osial... you and I were foes...<br />
'''Zhongli:''' But our ancient grudge is but a bygone memory now.</ref> suggesting he and Osial had a long-standing enmity for reasons yet known. However, tales of Rex Lapis' victory over the sea monsters have become a much-beloved tale among the people of Liyue.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Beidou|Vision}}</ref> The tale of the battle between Osial and Rex Lapis varies by person, but all Liyue people agree in that Rex Lapis wielded the sacred lance, [[Vortex Vanquisher]], to pierce the rainbow of Osial and pinned him in the center of the deep sea.<ref name="vortext-vanquisher">{{Ref/Weapon|Vortex Vanquisher}}</ref>

===Present===
People who sleep at Guyun Stone Forest have reported reliving Osial's memories of his defeat at Rex Lapis' hands.<ref name="roald" /> It is unclear whether this phenomenon stems from Osial's powers, or if it stems from something else.

During "[[Heart of Glaze]]," [[Childe]] uses the [[Fatui]]-manufactured Sigils of Permission to unleash Osial, hoping to lure out the Geo [[Archon]] in order to steal his [[Gnosis]]. Despite being imprisoned for two thousand years, Osial's strength had not diminished, and he easily shattered the [[Guizhong Ballista]]s when the [[adepti]] tried to use them. However, the ancient god was defeated and resealed once more after [[Ningguang]] dropped the [[Jade Chamber]] on it. After defeating him, the Traveler gains a [[Monolith Fragment]], which was part of the spear Morax used to seal it away.

During "[[A Herald Without Adherents]]," [[Dainsleif]] and the [[Traveler]] discover that the [[Abyss Order]] plans to use the [[Defiled Statue]], insert the limbs of Osial and the core of the [[Weird Statue|first Field Tiller]] to make a mechanized god to use to "topple the divine thrones of [[Celestia]]".

Beisht, Osial's "wife", became incensed at the Jade Chamber and plotted revenge on the people of Liyue. However, the plan failed as [[Ningguang]] had been warned of her presence by [[Beidou]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Where the Heart Finds Rest}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* Two [[triskelion]]s can be seen along his body in the cutscene where Childe reawakens it.
* Osial's original Chinese title uses {{Lang|mini=1|zh=魔神|zh_tl=Demon God}}, a term for gods preceding the rise of The Seven. The English localization typically translates this term as "God," but it was translated as "Overlord" for Osial instead.

===Etymology===
* Following the theme of gods in Genshin Impact being named after demons in the Ars Goetia, {{Lang|Osial|zh=奥赛尔|zh_rm=Àosài'ěr}} may be a portmanteau of {{Lang|{{w|Ose}}|zh=欧赛|zh_rm=Ōusài}}, the 57th demon, and another demon's name:
** A common theory, based on the ''-ial'' ending of its name, is {{w|Belial}}.
** Alternatively, based on the {{Lang|mini=1|zh=尔|zh_rm=ěr}} character in Osial's Chinese name, the second demon may be {{Lang|{{w|Furfur}}|zh=佛尔佛尔|zh_rm=Fú'ěr Fú'ěr}}, a demon who has control over storms, tempests, lightning, and thunder as one of its traits.
* Osial may be inspired by the water god {{Lang|{{w|Gonggong}}|zh=共工|zh_rm=Gònggōng}} and his minister {{Lang|{{w|Xiangliu}}|zh=相柳|zh_rm=Xiāngliǔ}} in the Chinese mythology.
** Gonggong is counted as one of the {{w|Four Perils|Four Evildoers}} and was considered responsible for great floods. His war against a holy emperor to decide who would be the ruler of the universe caused a catastrophic change to the world, including bending the directions of great rivers and the sun. Accounts vary about who defeated Gonggong, but in many cases they are believed to be one of the descendants of the {{w|Yellow Emperor}}, a mythological ruler who represents the virtue of the {{w|Earth (wuxing)|Earth element}}. These stories match the lore in the game that the Overlord of the Vortex was defeated by the God of Geo, which drastically changed Liyue's landscape and resulted in the formation of Guyun Stone Forest.
** Xiangliu is a great snake who has nine human heads and supported Gonggong during the war. He was finally slain by a hero-emperor but his blood tainted a large portion of the land. This legend may have inspired the lore that Osial is allegedly a nine-headed hydra<ref name="vortext-vanquisher" /> and the hatred of fallen gods plagues Liyue as miasmas.
