{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Bringing the Archaic Stone for first time)
:'''Muning:''' Have you found the Archaic Stones?
:{{DIcon}} Here they are.
:;(Submit {{item|Archaic Stone (Says He Who Seeks Stone)|text=Archaic Stone|x=3}})
:'''Muning:''' Three more.
:'''Muning:''' I shall gratefully take the Archaic Stones submitted by our two "civic-minded citizens."
:'''Muning:''' I didn't expect you to find three of them so quickly. And they are much better in quality than the ones I've previously seen.
:'''Muning:''' *sigh*... They remind me of the one that I used to have.
:'''Paimon:''' You have an Archaic Stone?
:{{DIcon}} Then why send us to look for it?
:{{DIcon}} C'mon, hand in yours first.
:'''Muning:''' I mean I USED to have one.
:'''Muning:''' My old man once handled a batch of ores at [[Shenglu Hall]]. That stone was just a leftover remnant and its quality was poor, so he gave it to me as a toy.
:'''Muning:''' We had been arguing all the time back then. I never had a job. And to make it worse, I spent most of my time at [[Yanshang Teahouse]]. As such, I ended up in heavy debt &mdash; and in distress too...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh...
:{{DIcon}} That feels a bit wrong...
:'''Muning:''' Well, who hasn't done a stupid thing or two when they were young? Anyway, when I was helpless...
:'''Muning:''' Someone recognized my Archaic Stone and offered a good price. To me, it was no big deal &mdash; a stone in exchange for some Mora to get me out of my immediate predicament. A fair trade I'd say.
:'''Muning:''' Yet my father brought this up the other day and asked, "Muning, where did you put the stone that I gave you?"
:'''Muning:''' All I could tell him was, "It's just a stone. I've long lost it."
:'''Muning:''' Though I said so, I couldn't help wondering what if I hadn't sold the stone &mdash; then I could show it to Father when he mentioned it...
:'''Muning:''' ...Forget it. It's no use wondering about the what-if now.
:'''Paimon:''' At least the prodigal son has returned.
:'''Muning:''' You are right... It's just that I still have a long way to go before I can clear my debt.
:'''Muning:''' I've digressed. Do bring me the stones if you find more.
:{{DIcon}} Aren't these enough?
:{{DIcon}} Just how many do you need?
:'''Muning:''' Hmm... Bring me three more. Three more would be enough.
:'''Muning:''' Archaic Stone is a rare ore. If [[Huishan Hall]] wants more, I seriously doubt if I can find any here in The Chasm.

;(Bringing the Archaic Stone for the second time)
:'''Muning:''' Have you found the Archaic Stones?
:{{DIcon}} Here they are.
:;(Submit {{item|Archaic Stone (Says He Who Seeks Stone)|text=Archaic Stone|x=3}})
:'''Muning:''' With these three included, it's nine in total. They should be enough.
:'''Muning:''' You managed to gather what Huishan Hall needs so quickly. No wonder they speak so highly of you!
:'''Paimon:''' Eh, it was easy! Easy-peasy, lemon-breezy!
:{{DIcon}} I'm sure it's "lemon-squeezy," Paimon...
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Uh, well, lemons can be breezy too!
:{{DIcon}} Oh, look at you, forcing your logic through. Most impressive.
:'''Muning:''' Haha... We've all witnessed your heroic deeds of fighting the sea monster. I believe it was no challenge for you to accomplish such a feat.
:{{DIcon}} No challenge at all indeed.
:{{DIcon}} It's actually a bit of a challenge...
:'''Muning:''' Well, so much for being a Ministry staff member. They still ask you to do things like "look for Archaic Stone in The Chasm"...
:'''Paimon:''' Speaking of which, you said you often argued with your father back then and didn't have a job.
:'''Paimon:''' Then how did you make it into the Ministry later?
:'''Muning:''' You know how I owed a big sum at the time? I could turn to no one, nor was I willing to go home.
:'''Muning:''' In the end, the debt collectors came looking for my old man at the Shenglu Hall... I thought he'd come find me to break my legs upon hearing the news.
:'''Paimon:''' But your legs look fine.
:'''Muning:''' Yes... It's embarrassing to say, but he cleared my debt and came looking for me. By the time he found me, I was almost like a beaten-up dog on the street. He said, "I have all your IOUs, so now you're indebted to me."
:'''Muning:''' With that, he forced me to work &mdash; to pay my debt.
:'''Paimon:''' So your father is your creditor now.
:'''Muning:''' You can say that...
:'''Muning:''' Back then, with the debt collectors after me, I couldn't even fall asleep at night. So, I swore that I'd mend my ways if I was given a second chance.
:'''Muning:''' But I didn't expect the chance to come from my father, who always disapproved of my behaviors...
:'''Muning:''' He didn't lash out at me as usual. Instead, we had a talk &mdash; an honest and sincere one. How I wish we could've talked this way earlier.
:'''Muning:''' But even if he'd been open for a talk, I wouldn't have been willing to listen.
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like your father treats you well.
:'''Muning:''' Yeah.
:'''Muning:''' So I have to get my job done well under whatever circumstances.
:'''Muning:''' Whether it's the incident in The Chasm or looking for Archaic Stones for Huishan Hall.
:{{DIcon}} I believe I'm the one who did the job for you this time...
:'''Muning:''' Having people get the job done also counts.
:'''Muning:''' But still, it's all thanks to you that we moved swimmingly &mdash; I'd say it was way more quickly than I expected.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, Paimon finally senses a touch of gratitude there.
