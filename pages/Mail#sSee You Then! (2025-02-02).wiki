Oh my, how did so many gifts end up hidden in this hat? If we don't empty them out, Rosseland might get angry. So, I'll need everyone to lend a hand and claim their share of the presents!

This party isn't just for [[Lynette]] — it's for every family member, and for me as well. Family gathered together, laughter all around... That's the greatest gift I could ever ask for!
By the way, your gift takes up quite a bit of space, so come get it soon! Did you forget? I've always considered you family too.

See you then!
