==Description==
"I shall give you a shard of [[Khvarena]], my friend. Keep her close, and keep her safe."<br>
"She comes from the wisdom of the flowers and the veins of the skies, and in her is the pure essence of life."<br>
"Khvarena is a point in the flower's heart, a single drop of light in a sea of sweet dew."<br>
"Please treasure my gift, until the day when the dark abyss rises to drown all life..."

The leaves and flowers passed the distant fable between them, and it was remembered by the fruits and seeds.<br>
When the [[Nabu Malikata|mistress of flowers]] had withered into dust, when the [[King Deshret|master of the desert]] had been led astray by a [[Aaru's Shut|false dream]],<br>
When the tyrants had been buried beneath the ever-shifting dunes and their ambitions were extinguished,<br>
When all that had come from the soil was returned to the golden sands, and that which had come from the flowing wind was given over to the rainforest...<br>
The [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|queen of the grass and trees]] watched the world change quietly, remembering her earnest covenant with those who had fallen.

"Please protect this Khvarena for me, my companion, my friend whom I love."<br>
"When we are gone, the mortals shall wander, lost, like infants newly taken from their swaddling,"<br>
"Fragile, yet sufficiently strong to conquer the wild winds, the searing flames, and their own imperfections."<br>
"But that which I fear is not the disasters I can predict, but rather the [[Abyss|chaotic darkness]]..."<br>
"Only the evil of this darkness and the threat of 'death' can crush the buds."

When the gilded sand had devoured the paradise of the past, the queen of trees and grass arose to fulfill that ancient agreement.<br>
Heeding the will of the Khvarena, she created for her a beauteous form, fashioning for her a life that was lovely beyond compare&mdash;<br>
That was [[Simurgh]], the divine bird, in whose form could be seen the vivid hues of countless birds, and in whose song was the song of numerous flowers...<br>
The final dream of the oasis was gathered into one body, and transformed into the pure, bright, endless [[Vourukasha Oasis|sea of flowers]] hidden within the divine bird's body.
