;(After completing ''[[Vimana Agama]]'') {{verify}}
:'''Jazari:''' Urgh, we're running out of money, but there haven't been any breakthroughs in my research...
:'''Jazari:''' I won't be able to afford meals if this goes on.
:{{DIcon}} Amurta's project...
::'''Jazari:''' I've applied for it, but haven't heard anything since then... Could the academic trends have changed recently?
::'''Jazari:''' As the saying goes, "The road to happiness is fraught with setbacks." Sometimes one has to wait a bit longer for a positive outcome.
::'''Jazari:''' Don't worry, when that day comes, I won't forget your contribution.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here?
::'''Jazari:''' Organizing the research results from before, of course.
::'''Jazari:''' I didn't expect such a giant volume of data. I don't know how much more time this will cost me.
::'''Jazari:''' But it would be irresponsible to publish the results before organizing them.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry to bother you.
::'''Jazari:''' *sigh* Come look for me when the funding has been secured.

;(After completing ''[[Until Vana is Healed]]'') {{verify}}
:'''Jazari:''' Haha, I will definitely become the greatest researcher of my era if I finish organizing the manuscript of Pir Kavikavus.
:'''Jazari:''' Not only will I be promoted to Herbad, I could even be addressed as Pir Jazari.
:{{DIcon}} So "Pir" is a title?
::'''Jazari:''' Isn't it? I'm not too sure either. Only the {{Rubi|[[Haravatat]]|Semiotics}} fellows care about these things.
::'''Jazari:''' We Kshahrewar are only concerned about genuine techniques.
:{{DIcon}} About Sumeru cuisine...
::'''Jazari:''' Huh? I don't remember promising to treat you guys to any Sumeru cuisine.
::'''Jazari:''' But since you've helped me out loads, I don't mind treating you to a meal of Curry Shrimp or something similar.
::'''Jazari:''' But let's wait until my results have been published successfully. I'll make sure to fill your bellies, be it [[Curry Shrimp]], or even [[Tandoori Roast Chicken]]!
:{{DIcon}} I wish you success.
::'''Jazari:''' Haha, that's for sure. Just wait to read my thank-you note.
