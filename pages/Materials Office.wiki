==Interactables==

==="What if We Do It This Way"===
This interactable is located on the northwestern desk in the Materials Office.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''"What if We Do It This Way?":''' (This seems to be a reference book intended to impart practical techniques.)
:'''"What if We Do It This Way?":''' (The book lists a great number of issues that Fontainians are quite unlikely to encounter in their daily lives, and provides rigorously logical solutions to said problems.)
:'''"What if We Do It This Way?":''' (However, both the title page and the ending contain requests from the author for readers to not do such things in practice.)
{{Dialogue End}}

==="Fantasy Institute"===
This interactable is located on bookshelf behind the southwestern desk in the Materials Office.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''"Fantasy Institute":''' (This seems to be a literary work of fiction.)
:'''"Fantasy Institute":''' (In this book, the entire Fontaine Research Institute was transported to a fantasy world, and many researchers go on adventurers{{sic}} together in this other world.)
:'''"Fantasy Institute":''' (There is a note stuck at the end of the text, with the following comments written on it:)
:'''"Fantasy Institute":''' ("Why do I still have to carry mechanisms and fight monsters even in another world? How is this any different from real life?")
:'''"Fantasy Institute":''' ("Is this what counts for popular novels within Institute circles? You might as well write one in which Mr. Edwin travels to another world with his Arkhium.")
:'''"Fantasy Institute":''' ("Please refrain from placing novels inside the Materials Office. Also, Mr. Edwin has stated that he has no interest in traveling to other worlds.")
{{Dialogue End}}

==="What Should I Do?"===
This interactable is located on the southeastern desk in the Materials Office.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''"What Should I Do?":''' (This appears to be a reference book meant to teach common knowledge to people who have yet to come of age.)
:'''"What Should I Do?":''' (But why is it placed inside the Institute's Materials Office...?)

:Executive Office
:Located at the intersection between the Liffey and Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering regions. Primarily responsible for the Institute's various administrative tasks.

:Academic Assembly Hall
:A venue for showcasing the products of the Institute's research to the public. The circular design of the exhibition hall allows it to accommodate a larger audience while providing a better view.

:Central Laboratory
:Located in the heart of Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering, it has the most advanced instruments in Fontaine. Currently, the primary research undertaken there is related to the "Experimental Field Generator."
