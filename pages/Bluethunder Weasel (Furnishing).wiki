|description    = These intelligent weasels live underground within the mining tunnels and cavernous depths of [[The Chasm]]. Their fur has a unique blue sheen.<br>Having long become used to life in the darkness, they now have excellent hearing and olfactory senses.<br>Now that they are in The Realm Within, these weasels nonetheless prefer areas not bathed in as much piercing sunlight. [[Tubby]] sometimes makes use of their keen senses to find some lost objects.
