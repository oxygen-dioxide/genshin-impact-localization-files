'''Viparyas''' are a [[Material]] found in the dream versions of [[Vanarana (Subarea)|Vanarana]] and the [[Grove of Dreams]], [[Sumeru]]. They are used for gifting to [[Material-Collecting Aranara]].

==How to Obtain==
Viparyas can be found in the dream versions of [[Vanarana (Subarea)|Vanarana]] and the [[Grove of Dreams]].

See the '''[https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=387 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for specific locations.

In the real version of Vanarana, the Viparyas are replaced by [[Padisarah]]s; in the Grove of Dreams, they are replaced by [[Sweet Flower]]s. Harvesting the Viparyas in the dream version will not make the corresponding flowers in the real version disappear, and vice versa.

Viparyas will only bloom in [[Vanarana Nursery]] after completing the [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] ''[[The Viparyas of Vanarana]]''.
