==Personality==
{{Quote|A genius known as the Kreideprinz, he is the Chief Alchemist and Captain of the Investigation Team of the Knights of Favonius.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
Having gained fame for his alchemical talents, Albedo is a reclusive person, spending most of his time in [[Dragonspine]]. He isn't fond of most social interactions and thus rarely travels to the city of Mondstadt unless it is to meet up with his fellow alchemists or other acquaintances. Yet he's also shown to at least be fascinated or interested in them in some way, often willingly appearing in events that have some sort of social setting going on and helping out the people around him in any way he can. While he does seem to enjoy company and seeing how people interact in a social setting, he finds relationships stressful and tiresome because of the amount of effort needed to maintain them. This doesn't mean he dislikes the relationships he has with others, he simply struggles with them and can get tired out from trying to keep track of everything to keep the relationship from falling apart. He prefers being around children, especially [[Klee]], seeing her as a younger sister. Klee in turn sees him as an older brother figure.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Klee|About Albedo}}</ref>

Fueled by the feeling of enlightenment, he researches about the things that pique his interest, and once the feeling is gone, either by uncovering its truth or otherwise, he loses all interest, left with a bittersweet sensation in his mind. Along with his alchemical genius, Albedo is also a respectable artist. Having initially learned the talent as a way to help with his experiments, it is now a form of relaxation for him.<ref name="website" /> He is [[Xingqiu]]'s illustrator and regards him as a good author.<ref name="ref/VO|Albedo|About Xingqiu">{{Ref/VO|Albedo|About Xingqiu}}</ref>

As much of a positive demeanor he gives off, the people of [[Mondstadt]] do not know anything about his personal life and he is particularly secretive about it towards them. To the Traveler, he does not mind sharing most of his secrets with them due to feeling a kinship of sorts as they are both not of [[Teyvat]], him being an artificial lifeform and the Traveler a visitor from afar. He considers himself to be dangerous due to his knowledge on the Art of Khemia, something which [[Venti]] and [[Dainsleif]] are well too aware of.

==Appearance==

Albedo uses the [[:Category:Medium Male Characters|medium male]] model. He has bright teal eyes with three dots in each iris, pale skin, and pale blond hair reaching below his shoulders. Due to being a synthetic human, a gold diamond marking can be found on his neck.

Despite his great achievements in the field of alchemy, he does not speak of the nature of things too hastily.

Wandering among ordinary folk oblivious to various truths of this world, he treats them with nothing but sincerity and kindness.

Polite and graceful, he seems withdrawn on the surface, but never hesitates to lend a helping hand. No matter if you go way back, or he has just befriended you, he can always find time to draw an exquisite portrait for a friend.

The Chief Alchemist of the Knights of Favonius, Albedo, is a truly remarkable young man. All admire his scholarly attainments &mdash; citizens of Mondstadt and members of the Knights of Favonius alike.

"Genius," "Kreideprinz," or "Captain of the Investigation Team"... Such titles and honors are of no consequence to him when there is so much more research to conduct.

The pursuit of fortune and connections cannot hold a candle to his heart's desire &mdash; acquiring the limitless, obscure knowledge left behind by previous generations of scholars.

The few commonly known alchemy techniques of today are but enough to put some broken odds and ends together, saving you the money you would have otherwise spent on glue.</p><p>"Nay, alchemy is not so ignoble an art!" Or so most alchemists would protest.</p><p>But as far as the average citizen of [[Mondstadt]] was concerned, that was alchemy.</p><p>At least until the day Albedo suddenly appeared and decided to stay in Mondstadt.</p><p>This young man displayed the true prowess of alchemy to all, bringing with him a massive corpus of wisdom that even the [[Sumeru Akademiya]] did not possess. "The universe is heaven reversed, and the earth is a dream lost to time. This is dust, the most basic form of complex life."</p><p>As if to provide evidence for this claim, Albedo lifted the burnt ash of the flower that once grew atop a Dendro Slime's head.</p><p>Seconds later, a [[Cecilia]] sprouted forth from the ash in his hand.</p><p>"And this... is new birth."</p>

In fact, he is earnest in all his dealings.</p><p>He is, however, of the persuasion that it requires more energy to maintain relationships established on excessive enthusiasm.</p><p>As a result, Albedo's equivalent of friendship involves maintaining an appropriate degree of distance.</p><p>Whether shutting himself away to work or traveling and gathering materials, no one in Mondstadt knows how to find him.</p><p>Albedo's tendency to avoid social interactions does not make him a cold-hearted person.</p><p>He is sincere and contented when instructing his assistants, [[Timaeus]] and [[Sucrose]].</p><p>He finds pleasure in giving his sketches to the citizens of Mondstadt.</p><p>Yet he cannot help but feel sincere disappointment that [[Lisa]], for all her great talents, has chosen to remain a mere Librarian.</p>

Nevertheless, Mondstadt's gates are ever open to all, and a recommendation letter is not strictly necessary.</p><p>Indeed, it could be argued that Albedo's life would have been far more comfortable without the letter.</p><p>This is because the recipient of the letter was the famed travel writer [[Alice]], an old friend of Albedo's master, [[Rhinedottir]].</p><p>After receiving the letter, Alice considered its requests.</p><p>"So Rhine said that you'll need a laboratory... And not one of a size that a civilian could build, either. Hmm... I know!"</p><p>And just like that, she threw him into the Knights of Favonius.</p><p>The work of the Knights is actually quite easy for Albedo &mdash; requiring only five percent of his energy.</p><p>Albedo had imagined that the rest of his energy could be spent on experiments, with the Knights' full range of apparatus at his disposal.</p><p>And yet...</p><p>Alice had a daughter, named [[Klee]].</p><p>Yes, "that" Klee.</p><p>"We'll be a family from now on, treat her like a real younger sister!"</p><p>From that day forth, remedying Klee's disasters would come to take up most of Albedo's remaining energy...</p>

As such, its alchemy focused more heavily on the creation of life.</p><p>This art of creation was known as "[[Art of Khemia|The Art of Khemia]]."</p><p>Albedo had learned of this in his youth from reading his master's notes.</p><p> The next stage after "soil" is "chalk," which was also something his master had mentioned.</p><p>"Chalk is the spotless soil, and was used to make primordial man."</p><p>Now, Albedo understands alchemy in far greater depth than he did in the beginning, and his knowledge on the subject is far more comprehensive.</p><p>"From soil was birthed chalk."</p><p>The profundity of this statement is well understood by Albedo now.</p><p>Such ineffable secrets are bound up with his fond memories of his master.</p><p>She was not his birth mother, but there is no doubt that his life stems from her.</p><p>"I hope this isn't just wishful thinking, but... when parents speak to their children about 'the meaning of this world'... surely they just mean the pursuit of a happy life?"</p><p>From time to time, Albedo finds himself musing on this sentiment.</p>

==Trivia==
*Albedo is a synthetic human created from alchemy by his master, [[Rhinedottir]] (also known as "Gold"). While he debates whether he considers her his "mother" in Character Story 5, by the events of [[Shadows Amidst Snowstorms]], he openly calls her his mother to the [[Traveler]]. On Rhinedottir's part, the description for [[Concealed Talon]] implies that she considers him her greatest creation.
*As of [[Version/3.1|Version 3.1]], Albedo is currently the only character who is unplayable at any point during his [[Story Quests|Story Quest]] series.<!--events do not count-->
*Albedo is the illustrator for Xingqiu's novel, [[A Legend of Sword]].<ref>{{Ref/VO|Xingqiu|About Albedo}}</ref> He enjoys reading the novels himself and rejected the [[Yae Publishing House]]'s offers to have him change series for greater royalties.<ref name="ref/VO|Albedo|About Xingqiu"/>
*The fact that Albedo was an artificial human who came from [[Khaenri'ah]] was heavily suggested before it was directly confirmed in Shadows Amidst Snowstorms:
**In his Character Stories, Albedo deduced the circumstances surrounding his creation through Rhinedottir's notes. Albedo's Constellation takes the shape of a fetus in a bottle, further hinting at the artificial nature of his creation.
**One of Albedo's Talents is named [[Homuncular Nature]]. In some branches of alchemy, the creation of homunculi is seen as an alchemist's end goal.<ref>Wikipedia: {{w|Homunculus#Alchemy|Homunculus § Alchemy}}</ref> During Shadows Amidst Snowstorms, Albedo is revealed to be the successful product of Rhinedottir's Primordial Human Project.<ref name="SAS2">{{Ref/Quest|The Shadows Deepen}}</ref>
**Albedo practices the Art of Khemia, a form of alchemy that was developed and practiced Khaenri'ah, and also played a major role in causing Khaenri'ah's downfall during the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago. The Art of Khemia was unheard of in Teyvat before his arrival, while [[Venti]] &mdash; the Archon [[Barbatos]] who was present for the cataclysm &mdash; states it has "unmistakeable properties."<ref>{{Ref/VO|Venti|About Albedo}}</ref> It could thus be deduced that Rhinedottir was from Khaenri'ah and created Albedo there.
**The Khaenri'ah Chapter's featured character, [[Dainsleif]], has the following line from a "self-proclaimed prophet" in his Official Introduction: ''"Chalk pursues gold, in this time inopportune, the eclipse is swallowed by the crimson moon."''<ref>HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/18296 "Bough Keeper" &mdash; Dainsleif]</ref> "Chalk pursues gold" is a reference to the four stages in creating the Opus Magnum, and may also be an allusion to Albedo's pursuit of Rhinedottir.
***Albedo's name is derived from the second step in creating the Opus Magnum and he is known as the Kreideprinz (Chalk Prince). Rhinedottir is better known by her infamous alias "Gold," the alchemist from Khaenri'ah attributed with creating the monsters that wreaked havoc on Teyvat during the cataclysm.
***Rhinedottir's final assignment for Albedo, to discover the "truth and meaning of this world," is similar to the [[Traveler's Sibling]]'s remark to the [[Traveler]] that they will discover the "true nature of this world" after they finish their journey.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Soul Set Apart}}</ref> Albedo seeks to reunite with Rhinedottir by completing his assignment, much like how the Traveler hopes to reunite with their sibling at the end of their journey.
**Albedo has a [[Symbols in Teyvat#Four-Pointed Star|four-pointed star]] on his neck. Having a four-pointed star as a birthmark is currently a trait only shared by other people from Khaenri'ah: [[Kaeya]] and Dainsleif's pupils take that shape. It was later revealed that Albedo's star is a "birthmark" left where Rhinedottir infused him with his life force.<ref name="SAS2" />
*Albedo is one of the few currently playable characters who acknowledges (or even seems aware) that the Traveler is from another world. He deduced this based on the Traveler's ability to control multiple elements without a Vision.
*In Version 1.2, players noticed that Albedo didn't breathe like all the other characters did in Dragonspine. This turned out to be an error and was fixed in Version 1.3.
*The Version 1.4 event [[Invitation of Windblume]] reveals that Albedo plays the lyre by ear and is apparently very good at it despite a lack of formal education in playing instruments.<ref>Event [[Invitation of Windblume]], Festive Challenge: Frost Parable - [[Invitation of Windblume/Festive Challenges#Frost Parable|Windblume Laureate]]</ref>
*Albedo refers to Alice as "Aunt Alice," and considers her daughter Klee to be his younger sister.
* Albedo is known by these aliases or titles:
**The Chalk Prince
**Captain of the Investigation Team
**Cretaceus
**Subject One
**Calx (pen name in Inazuma)
* In his original character introduction illustration, Albedo is seen armed with a [[Sacrificial Sword]]. In-game, as of Shadows Amidst Snowstorms, he is seen wielding his signature [[Cinnabar Spindle]] in all cutscenes.
* As a [[Trial Character]]:
** Albedo is the only playable character who wields a [[Flagship Event]] weapon in at least one of his Character Trial iterations ([[Festering Desire]] prior to [[Version 2.3]], Cinnabar Spindle from 2.3 onwards).
** Excluding [[Aloy]] (who is a crossover character lacking Character Trials) and the Traveler, he is also one of the only two 5-star characters who has never wielded a 5-star weapon in any of his Character Trial iterations to date. The other 5-star character with this distinction is [[Qiqi]].

===Etymology===
*The word {{wt|albedo|albēdō|Latin}} means "whiteness" in Latin. The term is used in alchemy to refer to the second phase in the creation of a Philosopher's Stone (the Opus Magnum) from prima materia.
*His title, Kreideprinz, means "Chalk Prince" in German.
*His constellation, Princeps Cretaceus, is Latin for "Chalk Prince."
*Albedo at times mentions the {{lang|Hadean|zh=冥古|zh_rm=Mínggǔ|zh_lit=Dark Ancient}} and the {{lang|Phanerozoic|zh=显生|zh_rm=Xiǎnshēng|zh_lit=Visible Life}}. The terms are used in [[Tide of Hadean]] and [[Opening of Phanerozoic]], as well as the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean voice-overs of his Elemental Burst.
**They are a reference to the geologic time scale of the real world. The {{w|Hadean}} refers to the eon from 4.6 billion years ago to 4 billion years ago, while the {{w|Phanerozoic}} spans from 541 million years ago to the present time. The latter eon includes the period of the {{w|Cretaceous}} (from Latin ''creta'', "chalk"), which lasted from around 145 to 66 million years ago.
**They may be used here as their literal senses. Namely, Albedo is perhaps saying "the primordial dark ancient era was followed by the era in which life has emerged, including me, the Chalk Prince, an artificial life created by alchemy."
