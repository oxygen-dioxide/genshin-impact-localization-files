==Description==
This version of the Magic Guide generated much controversy when published.<br />
In addition to the defiance of basic common sense seen in Chapter VII: Principles of the Anemo Element,<br />
errors can also be observed even concerning the basic principles of the Hydro and Electro elements.<br />
Evidently, the book was not peer-reviewed before publishing. Nevertheless, the book is still the most authoritative guide to magic in existence.
