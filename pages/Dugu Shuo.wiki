==Profile==
Dugu Shuo is a young orphan located in Chihu Rock, running along the road in front of [[Hanfeng's Ironmongers]]. He appears to be cared for by the people in the area, as the blacksmith, [[Master Zhang]], fashioned a knife (or as Shuo insists, a short sword) for him.

Shuo appears to have a bit of a complex over his young age and thus, his height: he wishes to obtain a Geo Vision so he can use it to create a tall pillar to stand on so everyone will have to look up at him.

===Appearance===
Shuo is a young boy with fair skin, short white hair and black eyes. He wears a short-sleeved light gray shirt, a brown vest and dark gray short. He wears black and brown boots.

==Trivia==
*Dugu Shuo is one of the few Liyue NPCs whose name is phonetically transcribed in the Japanese localization; most other NPCs use Sino-Japanese readings of the Chinese characters.

===Etymology===
*The exact origins of Dugu Shuo's name is unclear, but it may be derived from {{w|Dugu Qiubai}} and {{w|Dongfang Bubai}}, the two strongest martial artist characters in {{w|Jin Yong}}'s wuxia novels.<ref name="sakana">Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv8715157/ {{zh|【原神】璃月里的名字考据}}]</ref> This falls in line with several other Liyue NPCs whose names are derived from Chinese literary works.
** In Jin Yong's works, {{Lang|Dugu Qiubai|zh=独孤求败}} is a legendary swordsman known as the Sword Devil, who is deceased long before the novels' events.<ref name="dugu-qiubai">Baidu Encyclopedia: [https://baike.baidu.com/item/{{subst:#urldecode:%E7%8B%AC%E5%AD%A4%E6%B1%82%E8%B4%A5/24317}} {{zh|独孤求败 （《神雕侠侣》中的人物）}}]</ref> Dugu Qiubai's name roughly translates to "a solitary person who seeks defeat" ({{zh|独孤|rm=Dugu|tl=Alone}} + {{zh|求败|rm=Qiubai|tl=Seek Defeat}}), since he was so powerful that no one ever could defeat him.<ref name="dugu-qiubai" />
** His given name {{Lang|Shuo|zh=朔|zh_rm=Shuò}} is best remembered by {{Lang|{{w|Dongfang Shuo}}|zh=东方朔|zh_rm=Dongfang Shuò}}, a scholar-official during the 2nd century BC and one of the two points of origin for the surname {{w|Dongfang (surname)|Dongfang}}.<ref name="sakana" /> It may be an allusion to Dongfang Bubai (lit. "Invincible East"),<ref name="sakana" /> by far the strongest martial artist character who actually appeared in Jin Yong's novels.<ref>Baidu Encyclopedia: [https://baike.baidu.com/item/{{subst:#urldecode:%E4%B8%9C%E6%96%B9%E4%B8%8D%E8%B4%A5/10907}} {{zh|东方不败 （金庸武侠小说《笑傲江湖》中的人物）}}]</ref>
** In this theory, Dugu Shuo's obsession with obtaining good swords and a Geo Vision becomes even more satirical, because the above two wuxia characters have such transcendental skills that they no longer need powerful weapons. Dongfang Bubai can easily dominate four martial art masters just with embroidery needles and Dugu Qiubai can perform his swordsmanship without physical swords.
*Reading the characters of his name directly, {{Lang|Dugu Shuo|zh=独孤朔}} may translate to "solitary new moon."
