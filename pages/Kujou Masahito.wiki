==Profile==
Masahito is the eldest son of [[Kujou Takayuki]], older brother of [[Kujou Kamaji]], and older adoptive brother of [[Kujou Sara]]. When the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] was declared, Masahito expressed his doubts on the policy, believing it to harm rather than help the people. Nevertheless, he continues to fight the [[Watatsumi Army]] as part of the [[Shogun's Army]].

During the war, Masahito noticed that the [[Tatarigami]] that was suppressed on [[Yashiori Island]] had somehow intensified and sent a letter to his father to warn him of the dangers, but was scolded instead. Takayuki sent a force to assess the situation, but the team went missing, having succumbed to said energy themselves. Masahito remains in [[Kujou Encampment]]; while aware that the Shogun's Army far outmatches the [[Watatsumi Army]], he believes that either side could win if the war continues to drag on.

After his father's deception was revealed, Masahito was given the right to become clan head as he was the eldest son, but due to his position and duties, he allowed Kamaji to take over, as he saw him more fit for the role and promised to help him as a warrior of the clan.

===Personality===
Like his younger brother Kamaji, Masahito showed concern about the Shogunate's recent policies, believing that it was harming rather than helping the people. He appears to be an experienced and cautious officer, as he showed wariness towards the Tatarigami and the strength of the Watatsumi Army even though the Shogun's Army was better trained and equipped.

He is also shown to care for his younger brother, having let him take the position of acting clan head as he believed himself to serve better as a warrior than squabbling in clan affairs and politics.

===Appearance===
Kujou Masahito wears a  lavender ''shitagi'', indigo ''kobakama'', and he is barefoot in ''waraji'' sandals. His eggplant-colored armor with dark gold accents consists of ''dou'' (breastplate) with the [[Inazuma Shogunate]]'s crest, ''han-kote'' (half-armored sleeves), ''haidate'' (thigh guards), and ''sune-ate'' (greaves). He is also wearing a ''kabuto'' (helmet) with the Shogunate's crest and ''sode'' (shoulder armor) on his left shoulder. Masahito carries a ''katana'' at his hips on the left side with the blade facing down.

;(Before completing Warriors' Dreams Like Spring Grass Renewing)
:'''Kujou Masahito:''' Hmm? Why is a civilian like you wandering around in the military camp?
:'''Kujou Masahito:''' You're on the battlefield. For your own safety, you'd best leave now.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' I am Kujou Masahito, a Shogunate officer. I've been stationed in Kannazuka with orders to command the troops here.
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' Yes, it's the same Kujou that you are thinking of. The head of the Kujou Clan is my father. If you've ever heard of our clan before, then you should know what it means for me to be here.
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' Ever since the war with the Sangonomiya resistance began, this place has been rocked by turmoil. It's not a suitable place for travel or adventuring.
::{{DIcon}} How's the war going?
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' As you can see, the conflict is endless. We're in a stalemate. To be honest, if this keeps going on, it's hard to say which side has the upper hand.
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' While I was thinking about stratagems lately, my mind would often turn to my discussions of government affairs with [[Kujou Kamaji|Kamaji]], my younger brother, about whether the policies in Inazuma are really correct or not...
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' Ah, forget it. There is no use in talking about this. And these matters are none of your concern, anyway. A commoner is better off staying far away from the battlefield.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' Please heed my advice and leave now.

===Dialogue Set #2===

;(After completing Warriors' Dreams Like Spring Grass Renewing)
:'''Kujou Masahito:''' Hmm? Why is a civilian like you wandering around in the military camp?
:'''Kujou Masahito:''' ...Wait, I think I know you, Traveler. Kamaji and Sara have both mentioned you.
:{{DIcon}} About the Tatarigami...
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' If we were able to gain more an upper hand during the war, we could have used this matter as a bargaining chip.
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' But since the peace talks are over, there's no point considering that what-if now.
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' I must say that Sangonomiya Kokomi really is quite impressive...
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' If {{sic|a}} such a great disaster happened under another leader's watch, it would surely have hurt their image and restrained their next steps...
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' But she rooted out the people who performed the inside job and punished them swiftly and severely. If anything, this whole disaster became a way for her to consolidate her position.
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' Considering that we were up against such a frightening foe... All the more do I not regret negotiating a peaceful settlement.
::{{DIcon}} So, how's the situation on Yashiori Island now?
:::'''Kujou Masahito:''' We've begun reconstruction and redevelopment efforts in cooperation with Sangonomiya. This will, of course, damage our imports of [[Jade Steel]], but there's nothing to be done.
:::'''Kujou Masahito:''' After all, we've ignored their humiliation for so long as we exploited an entity that they considered divine...
:::'''Kujou Masahito:''' I'm sorry. I'm afraid {{sic|this as}} far as I can go without speaking out of turn.
:::'''Kujou Masahito:''' Whatever the case, the things that happened during the war did not surprise me at all. Were my father at the head of our troops, I suspect that his methods would have been crueler still...
:::'''Kujou Masahito:''' Indeed, he would probably see it as what ought to be done.
:{{DIcon}} How's things with your little brother?
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' My brother Kamaji is currently serving as the Provisional Clan Head in Inazuma City. Being a military man first and foremost, I will support him as best I can.
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' Now that our clan is in crisis, there will be those who may have a change of heart, never mind how the Almighty Shogun has yet to pass final judgment upon us. There is still much to be concerned about.
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' I've heard that it was you who accompanied the Shogun to rescue my brother from the hands of the [[Takatsukasa Clan]]. I, Masahito, will not forget this favor.
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' His faith in restoring our clan seems to have been renewed after that incident as well. I, too, believe that there is hope.
:{{DIcon}} About Kujou Sara...
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' She mentioned that both you and Sangonomiya Kokomi showed up at the signing of the ceasefire, and that you were one of the witnesses to the peace talks.
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' I will be honest. While I do not disagree with the results of the peace talks themselves, I am under no illusions that the differences between the Shogunate and the Sangonomiya will be wiped away so easily.
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' We of the Shogunate serve the Almighty Shogun, while Sangonomiya worships the already-slain god, [[Orobashi|Orobaxi]]. Such a huge gulf in our beliefs will not be bridged by a little ceasefire agreement.
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' As an officer of the Shogun's army, I will not relax my vigil simply because of this brief peace.
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' As for you... If you were to be on the other side when conflict breaks out again, I will have to face you in battle.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Kujou Masahito:''' Mm, be on your way then. This is not some place you'd want to stay in for long.
