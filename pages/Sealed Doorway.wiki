The '''Sealed Door''' can be found an the southern end of the [[City of Mondstadt]] (a bit beyond [[Schulz's Blacksmith]]). There is a door with a {{Hydro}} seal over it. Speaking to [[Goth]] reveals that it is one of his properties, but because someone placed the seal over it, he cannot lease it until someone breaks the seal. While the seal is up, interacting with the door leads to the following dialogue:
{{Dialogue start}}
'''Examine the door:''' (This door seems to be locked by a curious seal. What is this place, really?)
{{Dialogue end}}

During [[Mona]]'s first [[Story Quest]], "[[Beyond This World's Stars]]," she breaks the seal on the house and rents it. You are able to interact with Mona through the door, but after the quest ends and you leave the area, the house is no longer interactable.
