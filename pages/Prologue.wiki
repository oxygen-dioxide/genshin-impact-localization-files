==Trivia==
* The first Closed Beta Test had some major differences in the Prologue, which were revised for the second Closed Beta Test:
** The [[cataclysm]] occurred 100 years ago rather than 500 years ago. This difference was not adjusted for the citation at the bottom of [[Breeze Amidst the Forest Supplement: The Dragon Tome]], which was written after Dvalin's awakening several months before the Prologue.
** The Fatui's involvement in the Prologue was largely nonexistent and they are only mentioned by other characters.
*** At the start of Act II, the Traveler goes directly to the Knights of Favonius Headquarters to meet up with Jean, Lisa, Kaeya, and Amber, and learns about the Fatui delegation putting pressure about the Stormterror situation. This section was rewritten to have the Traveler encounter Jean in the middle of a terse discussion with a Fatui diplomat, before returning to the Knights' Headquarters to talk to Jean and Lisa.
*** The Fatui do not steal the Holy Lyre der Himmel. After the Traveler is forced to flee after being caught trying to steal the Lyre, Jean helps the party borrow it with official permission, with Barbara as the intermediary for the Church.
*** Act III ends with Venti and the Traveler running out of the Church; Signora's ambush and the events following it do not occur.
** When confronting Dvalin at the end of Act II, while the cutscene pans out the same way as it does in the final version, the conversation itself is different.
