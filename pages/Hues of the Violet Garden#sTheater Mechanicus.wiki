|text4  = Once you are in a stage, you will gain a certain number of Veneficus Points. Use them to create Mechanici at specific locations.

|text5  = When the stage begins, opponents will continuously flow in from various directions, and you must use various Mechanici to stop them.<br />Defeat different opponents to gain the matching amount of points. When the stage ends, you will gain stage score based off the number of points scored from defeated opponents.<br />Note that your characters will not deal any damage to opponents during Theater Mechanicus, nor can they gain any Elemental Energy.
