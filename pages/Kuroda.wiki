==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Kuroda:''' Greetings! Welcome to Yae Publishing House.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'm looking to buy some books.
::'''Kuroda:''' Thank you for your patronage! Feel free to look around!
:;(Opens [[Yae Publishing House]] shop)
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Kuroda/Black Barrier Brandisher|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Kuroda:''' For the work of editing King of Invokations, we must know the rules of Genius Invokation TCG by heart.
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Kuroda:''' Wonderful! Ah, this may be a point of reference for the novel... I'll chronicle this game right now!
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Duel
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Kuroda/Duel: Kuroda|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Kuroda:''' Well, I won because there was actually a duel just like this one in King of Invokations...
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Kuroda:''' How did this happen? Well... Fortunately, reality is not fiction, and losing a game doesn't have any real consequences...
:{{DIcon}} And you might be...?
::'''Kuroda:''' My name is Kuroda... I'm actually the executive editor of Yae Publishing House. But the author I'm handling has yet to come up with any updates yet, so I'm pretty idle right now, so I figured, why not come down to the bookstore to help promote some books?
::'''Kuroda:''' Have you found anything that strikes your fancy? Feel free to let me know.
::{{DIcon}} Who's the author you're in charge of...?
::'''Kuroda:''' Hmm? Oh yeah, that reminds me. The author that I handle is an outlander as well. Have you ever heard of [[Chang the Ninth|Mister Chang]] from [[Liyue]]? He once won an award in the "[[This Novel Is Amazing!]]" contest. [[First Apprentice of Guhua|"The First Apprentice of Guhua"]] is one of his well-known works.
::'''Kuroda:''' ...You say you've met this person in Liyue before? Could it be a coincidence... Anyway, I originally wanted him to come up with a cooler pseudonym, but he refused to do that and insisted on using his real name.
:;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:::'''Kuroda:''' *sigh* If it weren't for the [[Sakoku Decree]], I would have gone to Liyue to push... Uh, I mean, to visit him.
:;(After completing Transient Dreams)
:::'''Kuroda:''' Still, it's thanks to him that I've got the reputation I have as an editor. I only wish that he can find his muse soon and come up with some new works.
:::'''Kuroda:''' Well, now that the Sakoku Decree is no more, I should be able to go to Liyue and personally chas— I mean, pay him a visit!
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to know about Yae Publishing House.
::'''Kuroda:''' Yae Publishing House is founded by [[Yae Miko|Lady Yae Miko]], the Guuji of the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]]. We mainly sell Light Popular Novels, which are more commonly known as Light Novels.
::'''Kuroda:''' As you can see, the first floor is the bookstore, where we sell the books that we have published.
::'''Kuroda:''' You must be an outlander, right? In that case, I highly recommend our local light novels. These are the most popular with young people nowadays.
::'''Kuroda:''' Even some outlander authors have started to follow the grand of writing light novels now. They've even submitted drafts to us.
::'''Kuroda:''' Many light novels fans from other islands have traveled all the way here to buy books. They even call it a pilgrimage... Haha, well, I guess light novels are just that popular, huh?
:{{DIcon}} Thank you! I'll have a look myself.
::'''Kuroda:''' Sure, feel free!

==Event Dialogue==
===Hues of the Violet Garden===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Kuroda:''' Hello there. Welcome to Yae Publishing House, and welcome to the Magnificent Irodori Festival, run jointly by the Yae Publishing House and the Yashiro Commission.
:'''Kuroda:''' It's just a shame that the writer of the prize-winning text "First Apprentice of Guhua" could not release a new volume in time for the festival. I doubt we'll be able to meet them this time...
