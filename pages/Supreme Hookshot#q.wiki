{{Quest Description|Kayvan the angler seems to be working tirelessly toward a certain goal...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Kayvan, optional)
:'''Kayvan:''' (I'll definitely catch a big fish!)

;(Talk to Kayvan)
:'''Kayvan:''' You look like... You're a Traveler, right? Hanging out in such a place, are we? Nice choice.
:'''Kayvan:''' Could it be that you are another fisher with your eyes on this area?
:'''Kayvan:''' You've got a good eye! It's the best fishing site around these parts.
:'''Paimon:''' But no one's fishing here, right? How can you be so certain?
:'''Kayvan:''' Well, because I can see things they can't.
:'''Kayvan:''' I'm the best angler here, and I have my own standards for fishing sites.
:{{DIcon}} R&mdash;Really?
:'''Paimon:''' But where's the fish you caught?
:'''Kayvan:''' Say no more. I'll show you what it means to be the "Supreme Hookshot."
:{{DIcon}} Supreme...
:{{DIcon}} Hookshot?
:'''Kayvan:''' Bring me some special materials, and I will catch "fish" you've never seen before using my handmade bait.
:'''Paimon:''' That feels... kinda suspicious. Will this handmade bait really work?
:{{DIcon}} Wouldn't hurt to try.
:'''Kayvan:''' That's the spirit! I like you!
:'''Kayvan:''' My handmade bait is based on [[Sunsettia]] and [[Wheat]] and is then further elevated by another material.
:{{DIcon}} What kind of materials do you need?
:;(Kayvan randomly chooses one of the following versions of the commission)
{{Dialogue End}}

===Special Mushroom Version===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kayvan:''' I'm feeling... How about a mushroom today?
:'''Kayvan:''' The mushrooms I usually use are found in a special area, I'll show you where they can be found.
:'''Kayvan:''' Please find this sort of mushroom for me.
----
{{Quest Description|update|According to Kayvan, the bait this time requires one portion of Sunsettia and Wheat, respectively. He also asks the Traveler to go somewhere and pick a mushroom said to be very special...}}
;(Approach the marked area)
:'''Paimon:''' This should be the place he mentioned, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't see any mushrooms here, but there is a monster... Did the monster take it?
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, let's defeat it and take the mushroom back!

;(After defeating the Winged Dendroshroom)
;(Obtain [[Special Mushroom]])
:'''Paimon:''' Got it. Time to bring the mushroom back.
----
;(Talk to Kayvan)
:'''Kayvan:''' The bait this time requires Sunsettia, Wheat, and a Special Mushroom. Did you get them all?
;(Submit materials)
:;(Dialogue continues in the [[#Ending|Ending]] section)
{{Dialogue End}}

===Special Bird Eggs Version===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kayvan:''' I'm feeling up to some... [[Bird Egg]]s fresh from the nest today.
:'''Kayvan:''' The eggs I usually use are found on the tree nearby. I'll show you the way.
----
{{Quest Description|update|According to Kayvan, the bait this time requires one portion of Sunsettia and Wheat, respectively. He also asks the Traveler to go somewhere and get three bird eggs said to be very special...}}

;(Approach the [[Wind Current]] that leads from the hill east of Port Ormos up to the tree)
:'''Paimon:''' Found it! This must be the tree mentioned by that fisher.
:'''Paimon:''' Is there anything special about the Bird Eggs here? Paimon doesn't understand...

;(Obtain all 3 [[Special Bird Egg]]s)
:'''Paimon:''' Yay, Paimon's got the Bird Eggs! Let's return now!
----
;(Talk to Kayvan)
:'''Kayvan:''' The bait this time requires Sunsettia, Wheat, and Special Bird Eggs. Did you get them all?
;(Submit materials)
:;(Dialogue continues in the [[#Ending|Ending]] section)
{{Dialogue End}}

===Zaytun Peach Version===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kayvan:''' I'm feeling... Zaytun Peach today.
:'''Kayvan:''' It's common, but few consider it an ingredient with which to make bait.
:'''Kayvan:''' Please find that for me, would you?
:'''Kayvan:''' The bait this time requires Sunsettia, Wheat, and Zaytun Peach. Did you get them all?

===Ending===
{{Quest Description|update|Give the bait materials to Kayvan and see what fish he can catch...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kayvan:''' Great, we have all the materials. Now witness the creation of a unique bait.
:{{Black Screen|Kayvan skillfully prepares the bait.}}
:'''Kayvan:''' Alright, here goes. Hooks away!
:'''Kayvan:''' Hook depth good... Flow speed moderate...
:'''Kayvan:''' You gotta be quiet. The fish are really sensitive.
:'''Kayvan:''' Even the footsteps on the bank could startle them.
:{{DIcon}} I'm standing still.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon never lands.
:'''Kayvan:''' Then be patient and wait...
:{{Black Screen|Kayvan catches a wet package.}}
:'''Paimon:''' What is this? That's no fish!
:{{DIcon}} I sure have never seen a "fish" like that.
:'''Kayvan:''' So that happened again. Just as expected.
:'''Kayvan:''' Don't worry, outlander, stay calm. Don't gripe too much about the details.
:'''Kayvan:''' Everything that comes with a hook could be considered a "fish."
:'''Kayvan:''' Let me tell you, I didn't just invent the title of "the greatest angler" out of thin air.
:'''Kayvan:''' After all, always catching lifeless things that could never bite the bait is something quite special, wouldn't you say?
:'''Kayvan:''' Other anglers have praised my unique talents.
:{{DIcon}} They might be comforting you...
:{{DIcon}} They might just be joking...
:'''Paimon:''' So basically, you catch everything but fish...
:'''Kayvan:''' Ahem! I don't care what they think! A&mdash;At least I never go home empty-handed!
:'''Kayvan:''' I'll come again if I fail today, and I'll definitely catch a fish someday!
:'''Kayvan:''' Anyway, thanks for finding the materials. Please take your payment here. I'm fishing somewhere else.
:'''Kayvan:''' Next time... Next time, I'll definitely get a big fish! I'm sure of it!
