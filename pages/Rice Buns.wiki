==Trivia==
*The Chinese name of the food translates to {{Lang|Rice Wowo|zh=米窝窝|zh_rm=Mǐwōwō}} and it likely refers to {{Lang|''{{w|wotou}}''|zh=窝头|zh_rm=wōtóu|zh_tl=nest-thing}}, a type of steamed bread in the northern part of China.
**Although today ''wotou'' is most commonly made of cornmeal, in the middle Qing period (circa 1800), it was called {{Lang|''wowo''|zh=窝窝|zh_rm=wōwō}} and primarily made of glutinous rice.<ref>Baidu Encyclopedia: [https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%AA%9D%E7%AA%9D%E5%A4%B4 窝窝头]</ref>
