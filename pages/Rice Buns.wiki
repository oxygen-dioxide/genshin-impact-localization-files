|desc_basic      = The rice and horsetail have been ground into flour and kneaded into dough before being placed into a steaming basket. They can be eaten as-is or with a vegetable filling. Portable and satiating, it is a very popular dish in the [[Liyue]] region.
|desc_delicious  = The unique sweetness of the whole grains passes between your teeth and lips as you chew. The relatively nondescript ingredients have been transformed into a true delicacy by your labors. This is one of the simple pleasures of the common folk and tastes best after some good, honest work.

==Trivia==
* {{Related Items|type=variant}}

===Etymology===
* The Chinese name of the food translates to {{Lang|Rice Wowo|zh=米窝窝|zh_rm=Mǐwōwō}} and it likely refers to {{Lang|''{{w|wotou}}''|zh=窝头|zh_rm=wōtóu|zh_tl=nest-thing}}, a type of steamed bread in the northern part of China.
** Although today ''wotou'' is most commonly made of cornmeal, in the middle Qing period (circa 1800), it was called {{Lang|''wowo''|zh=窝窝|zh_rm=wōwō}} and primarily made of glutinous rice.<ref>Baidu Encyclopedia: [https://baike.baidu.com/item/{{subst:#urldecode:%E7%AA%9D%E7%AA%9D%E5%A4%B4}} {{zh|窝窝头}}]</ref>
