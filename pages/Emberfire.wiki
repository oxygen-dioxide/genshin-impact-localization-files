==Lyrics==
May the birds soar from their cage<br>
Sunbeams filter through the foliage<br>
Flames grow with immortal courage<br>
And I hope you won't be tainted by fate<br>
Nothing to fear<br>
So go alone

By the grace of pain<br>
Hundreds of times you fight in the ruins<br>
Your pride will not be slain<br>
From the heart to the veins

Stay awake don't fall asleep<br>
The way is long and the gloom is deep<br>
Embers glowing in the hearth still seen<br>
And I hope you won't be tainted by fate<br>
Nothing to fear<br>
Never look back<br>
Go ahead

Though bones and minds were chained<br>
You cut down the thorns again and again<br>
Your pride will not be slain<br>
From the heart to the veins

(Nec fatum finire te)<br>
(Nec tribulatio potest)<br>
Flames grow with immortal courage<br>
(Haec olim meminisse iuvabit)<br>
And your world will never fall away<br>
Nothing to fear<br>
Beneath the scars<br>
You'll never be tainted by fate
