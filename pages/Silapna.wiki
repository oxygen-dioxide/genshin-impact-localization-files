'''Silapna''' are "gates" used to travel between the real and dream worlds. They are activated by playing "Rhythm of the Great Dream" on the [[Vintage Lyre]]. Some [[Aranara]] are only found in the dream world.

==Locations==
There are three Silapna in [[Dharma Forest]]:

* In [[Vanarana]] near the [[Phantasmal Gate]], encountered during ''[[The World of Aranara]]''
* In the [[Grove of Dreams]], encountered during ''[[Slumbering Roots]]''
* In [[Ashavan Realm]], encountered during ''[[Legends of the Stone Lock]]''

== Trivia ==
=== Etymology ===
* The Aranara term "Silapna" may be derived from the Sanskrit words {{Lang|''śilā''|sa=शिला|sa_tl=stone}} and {{Lang|''svápna''|sa=स्वप्न|sa_tl=dream}}.
