==Personality==
{{Quote|The Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing. Her wealth is unsurpassed in all of Teyvat.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
Ningguang is a professional businesswoman, having accumulated her wealth through hard work and perseverance. As the Tianquan, she is known for being highly meticulous in her work and holds a large amount of influence within Liyue.

She is a calculating and ruthless businesswoman guided by the sole aim of making [[Mora]],"<ref>{{Ref/VO|Keqing|About Ningguang: Conflict}}</ref> which stems from her impoverished background.<ref name="Zhongli VO">{{Ref/VO|Zhongli|About Ningguang}}</ref> She makes use of a large intelligence network and "pawns" to gain the information she needs, and will only make use of people whose weaknesses she knows."<ref>{{Ref/VO|Ningguang|About Zhongli}}</ref> As a result, she is disliked by those with significant influence, but nonetheless, many accept it as she adds to the overall prosperity of both the Qixing and Liyue Harbor itself.

Despite her cold, business-driven exterior, she has Liyue's best interests at heart. Under her decree in response to a case of water contamination, those who intentionally endanger public health and safety should be "shown no mercy whatsoever."<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Hongyi}}</ref> When [[Osial]] was reawakened and threatened Liyue Harbor, she put her conflict with the [[adepti]] aside and ultimately sacrificed the [[Jade Chamber]], her life's work, to seal it away. She is also particularly fond of children, both because they give her vital intelligence and because she enjoys seeing them smile.

{{Quote|The biggest secret in Liyue, is not a secret in of itself, but Ningguang, who herself knows all the secrets of Liyue.|Kaiyang of the Liyue Qixing's comment regarding Ningguang<ref>Facebook: [https://www.facebook.com/Genshinimpact/posts/the-biggest-secret-in-liyue-is-not-a-secret-in-of-itself-but-ningguang-who-herse/630100637840130/ Ningguang's Introduction]</ref><ref group="Note">The English version of Ningguang's official introductions split the contents of the [https://bbs.mihoyo.com/ys/article/807446 original Chinese post] between the official English Facebook and Instagram posts introducing her.</ref>}}
Ningguang is one of the "Liyue Qixing," lethally perceptive and a sharp talker to boot. In the grand marketplace that is Liyue, Ningguang is second to none.

Everyone who meets Ningguang becomes awe-inspired by her exemplary insight and remarkable smarts. On top of that, her style is one of a kind.

She invested an astronomical amount into purchasing up huge volumes of [[Plaustrite]], a type of rock with levitation properties. With this, she was able to build a resplendent residence in the sky above Liyue, known as the Jade Chamber.

Her chamber is much like Ningguang herself — beyond measure, above the masses, and draws attention from all.

Despite being a mogul who shakes the very foundations of business circles, she is adored by the children of Liyue like an older sister. A socialite at Yujing Terrace banquets and a connoisseur in the world of desserts, she remains Liyue's most beautiful, unsolvable enigma.

|text1         = <p>The "[[Liyue Qixing]]" controls all of the commerce that takes place in [[Liyue Harbor]]. Its highly-revered position is also coveted by many. Their primary ruling is to play things safe and keep a low profile.</p><p>The "Tianquan" of the Qixing, Ningguang, is the only exception. </p><p>She is seen as an excellent merchant in the eyes of her rivals, a friendly elder sister to kids, a socialite at the banquets of Yujing Terrace, and a connoisseur of desserts... Ningguang is the talk of the town, and everyone seems to know everything about her. However, they all seem to tell a different story of Ningguang, with great discrepancies between the versions.</p><p>Still, if there's one thing all the rumors about her agree on, it's that Ningguang is someone truly extraordinary.</p>

|text2         = <p>Up above Liyue Harbor, there is a floating palace held up by plaustrite. It is known as the "[[Jade Chamber]]," and it belongs to Ningguang.</p><p>On a clear day, one can see almost all of Liyue Harbor from the decks outside the palace gates.</p><p>Whenever Ningguang has important business matters to handle, she invariably comes to this floating palace. She strictly forbids anyone from accessing the premises except for her three trusted confidants. Her confidants sort through the relevant information, summarize it and hang the summaries on the wall, while Ningguang rests against the railings, enjoying the view of [[Liyue]] and quietly mulling everything over.</p><p>She is certain to arrive at the perfect solution before her confidants have finished adding everything to the wall. Once she has made her decision she shreds everything and throws it out of the window, creating something of a snowstorm of paper.</p><p>The handwriting on the shredded pieces of paper stands out like ink in the snow to all of the merchants in Liyue Harbor.</p><p>For they know that whenever Ningguang's shredded snow falls, a huge change is about to descend on the business community.</p>

The Tianquan knows all the details, good, bad and ugly.</p><p>Once, an alchemist from [[Sumeru]] was traveling in Liyue and unwittingly happened across the records of a certain [[Noctilucous Jade|noctilucous jade]] transaction involving the [[Blackcliff Forge]] ten years prior. That night, someone from Ningguang's inner circle knocked on his window and invited him to join Ningguang in the Jade Chamber for a talk.</p><p>Rumor has it that Ningguang has enchanted the Jade Chamber in such a way that allows her to eavesdrop on everyone in the city's private conversations...</p><p>The truth is that Ningguang's eyes and ears are in fact the children who play on the streets in Liyue Harbor.</p><p>Between them, they are aware of every confidential meeting, every private conversation, and every new visitor to the city. When Ningguang gathers them around, her promise of delicious treats proves to be an irresistible incentive, and so they tell her everything they know.</p><p>Once she has finished carefully cross-referencing everything she has learned from the children against other sources, there is no secret hidden from her in Liyue Harbor.</p><p>She understands the value of reciprocity more than anyone, which is why she is more than willing to invest time in mingling with the common folk.</p><p>On top of that, she does actually like seeing the children smile.</p>

Each round she wins against a wealthy merchant brings a gleeful smile to her face as they sigh and reluctantly hand over the Mora, and nothing makes her happier than seeing the guilds bow to her wishes.</p><p>Every victory in this game adds to the wealth of the Liyue Qixing. Liyue Harbor prospers as a result, and this in turn creates more business opportunities and more profit for Ningguang. Every member of the Liyue Qixing is more than happy with this perfect cycle of interlocking interests.</p><p>People often ask Ningguang why she is still doing business in Liyue Harbor when she has already acquired such vast wealth.</p><p>"Vast wealth is a wonderful thing."</p><p>Ningguang patiently replies, never able to understand why people would ask such foolish questions.</p><p>"Adding another Mora to the pot can hardly make it any less wonderful, now, can it?"</p>

Those who do so will see their interests protected, while those who violate the rules will be punished accordingly.</p><p>The rules are rooted in ancient laws set down by [[Morax]], Liyue Harbor's divine protector, and they are absolute. Over the millennia, each Tianquan has introduced amendments to the rules to ensure they are well aligned with current societal needs.</p><p>The laws are compiled and published along with a 279-page commentary, and a copy is given to each citizen of Liyue.</p><p>Ningguang likes it this way: Law and order is good for business, and she understands the intricacies of the laws that forge the order better than anyone else.</p><p>However, there was a certain ship captain by the name of [[Beidou]] who acted with flagrant disregard for the rules, smuggling contraband goods by leveraging her exotic cargo and exclusive business intelligence. To Ningguang, captain Beidou was the black sheep of Liyue Harbor's business community.</p><p>As Tianquan, it fell to Ningguang to impose heavy fines on Beidou each time she transgressed the rules. But much to her consternation, Beidou seemed to take these fines in her stride, like water off a duck's back.</p><p>Outside of the official channels, too, Ningguang tried to find ways to implore Beidou to change her ways and stop putting the Qixing in such a difficult position. In response, Beidou simply explained away her actions as "enacting justice," "helping the poor" and "keeping the sailors in their jobs." As a firm believer in the principle of live and let live, Beidou had no time for Ningguang's advice.</p><p>In the end, Ningguang agreed to disagree and gave up trying to convince the stubborn Beidou to change.</p>

|text6         = <p>Being the charming and wealthy woman that she is, Ningguang has never had a shortage of suitors.</p><p>It seems that every eligible bachelor, from the young esquires of Yujing Terrace, to accomplished young businessmen, to renowned sea captains, has at some point invested substantial energy into trying to win Ningguang's affection. One rumor even has it that a wealthy businessman from the [[Court of Fontaine]] signed a major trade deal with Liyue Harbor for the sole reason that it would mean he could see Ningguang more often.</p><p>Ningguang treats all her suitors with an equal measure of kindness and grace, but also keeps them at distance &mdash; enough to keep them interested but not push them away. Curiosity got the better of everyone in town, and now everyone wants to know: Who is Ningguang's lover? </p><p>Little do they know, Ningguang has no love for finite things, and will certainly not be bound by something that is finite.</p><p>The Jade Chamber, a floating palace above Liyue Harbor, belongs to Ningguang alone. It started out about the size of a room, but has since grown so large that in the moonlight it casts its shadow over the whole of Liyue.</p><p>A portion of Ningguang's seemingly limitless wealth goes towards hiring skilled craftsmen to continue the expansion and refurbishment of the Jade Chamber, ensuring that it becomes ever more extravagant as time goes by.</p><p>To Ningguang, the Jade Chamber is a symbol of her wealth and power, and a sign that her business is flourishing.</p><p>Save for Mora, it is the thing Ningguang loves most in the world &mdash; because it is infinite.</p><p>One day, she insists, it will cast its shadow over all the seven nations of [[Teyvat]].</p>

Players use the dice to determine how far their chess pieces move, and landing on various locations will trigger different events. Victory in-game is decided by the number of counters in each player's hands.</p><p>The rules can change at any time according to Ningguang's fancies, and when playing with others, she will always follow the newest rule set that she has on hand.</p><p>When she's truly feeling the spirit, she will even design new rules on the spot &mdash; no one has yet beaten her at this game, and she has now reached the 32.6th edition of her rulebook.</p><p>She marketed the 8th edition of the game to the general public, believing it to be the easiest to understand, but it proved to still be far too complicated for ordinary folk.</p><p>Nonetheless, people flock to purchase sets on account of the beauty and intricacy of the model pieces.</p><p>In truth, more people buy it for the models than for the game.</p>

==Trivia==
* Ningguang is mentioned in [[The Steambird#Teyvat Food Notes|The Steambird - Teyvat Food Notes]] column (blog post) about [[Golden Crab]] &mdash; her least favorite dish. The columnist, Long Erjun (an alternate-universe version of the [[Traveler]]), prepares Golden Crab for her, only to be rebuffed with the same dialogue she uses in her "Least favorite food..." voice-over line.<ref>HoYoverse Chinese News: [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/11125 Teyvat Food Notes: Golden Crab]</ref>
* Her constellation is an {{w|armillary sphere}}.
* Ningguang does not use her catalyst when casting her [[Sparkling Scatter|Normal]] or Charged Attacks and only uses it when activating her [[Jade Screen|Elemental Skill]], [[Plunging Attack]] or [[Starshatter|Elemental Burst]]; she summons her gems without her catalyst.
* Ningguang is modest when it comes to food, preferring simple and basic dishes, showing disdain towards more luxurious food such as [[Golden Crab]].
* Ningguang is known by these aliases or titles:
** Tianquan of the Liyue Qixing
** Tailor of Liyue<ref>{{Ref/CS|Zhongli|4}}</ref>

===Etymology===
* Ningguang ({{zh|凝光}}) in Chinese means "Frozen Light" or "Concentrated Light."
* Her name might have been derived from the Chinese Classic {{zh|《滕王阁序》|"Téngwánggéxù"|tl=Preface to the Ode of Prince Teng's Pavilion.}} {{zh|潦水尽而寒潭清 烟光凝而暮山紫|tl=The puddles on the ground have dried up, and the water in the pond is cool and translucent. At dusk the rays of the setting sun, condensed in the evening haze, turn the mountains purple.}}
* Another derivation from her name comes from the Tang Dynasty Poem {{zh|《八月十五夜桃源玩月》|"Bāyuèshíwǔyè Táoyuánwányuè"|tl=The Frolic with the Moon in the Peach Forest on Mid-Autumn.}} {{zh|凝光悠悠寒露坠 此时立在最高山|tl=Concentrated light like slowly descends like frozen dew, I stand upon the peak of the blossoming woods.}}
* Her constellation, {{wt|opus|Opus|Latin}} {{wt|aequilibrium|Aequilibrium|Latin}}, is roughly Latin for "The Balancing Creation." This likely refers to the diagram of her constellation resembling a {{w|gyroscope}}.
** In Chinese, her constellation is instead {{zh|玑衡仪座|Jīhéngyí-zuò|tl={{w|Armillary Sphere}} Apparatus Constellation.}}
*** Notably, the English translation consistently translates {{zh|玑衡|Jīhéng}} as "(a)equilibrium" rather than "armillary sphere" &mdash; the Chinese title for [[Verses of Equilibrium]] can be more directly translated as "Armillary Sphere Scriptures."
*** {{zh|玑衡|Jīhéng}} can also refer to all the [[Liyue Qixing|seven stars]] in the Big Dipper from two of the seven stars Tianji ({{zh|天玑|Tiānjī}}) and [[Keqing|Yuheng]] ({{zh|玉衡|Yùhéng}}).
* Her title, Tianquan ({{zh|s=天权|t=天權|rm=Tiānquán|tl=Celestial Balance}})<!--Apparently 权 does not refer to power in this context.-->, is the Chinese name for the star in the {{w|Big Dipper}} named {{w|Delta Ursae Majoris|Delta Ursae Majoris (Megrez)}}, consistent with the naming convention for members of the [[Liyue Qixing]].
