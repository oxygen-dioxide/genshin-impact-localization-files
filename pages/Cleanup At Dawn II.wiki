{{Quest Description|At the behest of head housemaid [[Adelinde]], maids Moco and Hillie have begun cleaning up. However, they seem to have run into a spot of trouble...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Moco)
:'''Moco:''' What're we gonna do!?
:'''Hillie:''' Adelinde is totally gonna freak out...
:{{DIcon}} What's up?
:'''Moco:''' So, Adelinde asked us to tidy up the area around the Winery.
:'''Hillie:''' Most places were fine, but there are all these haystacks lying around.
:'''Moco:''' [[Connor]] said he's storing them here because he needs them for something.
:'''Hillie:''' They're bound pretty tight, so at least they didn't get blown away in the wind. But still, a load of leaves got blown in among the hay.
:'''Moco:''' We worked really hard at it, but we still didn't manage to get all the leaves out.
:'''Hillie:''' If we keep on at this pace, the head housemaid Adelinde is gonna freak out... What're we gonna do?
:{{DIcon}} Allow me.
::'''Moco:''' Seriously? You're awesome! Thanks.
:{{DIcon}} So, the leaves are hard to get rid of?
::'''Hillie:''' When they're mixed in with the hay they sure are. We have to pick them out one by one, which takes forever...
::'''Hillie:''' If you've got a better idea, I'm all ears!

;(Talk to Moco or Hillie again, optional)
:'''Moco:''' Ugh, my clothes are filthy now.
:'''Hillie:''' And we didn't even clear out all the leaves.
:'''Moco:''' What're we gonna do?
----
;(After using Anemo to blow away the leaves)
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, you can use Anemo to blow all the leaves out from the haystack.
:'''Paimon:''' Not a bad idea!

;(After using Pyro to burn the leaves and the hay)
:'''Paimon:''' Yikes, fire! It's fire!
:'''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What're we gonna do now? The whole thing went up in smoke...
----
;(Report back after clearing the leaves with Anemo)
:'''Moco:''' How did it go?
:'''Hillie:''' Did you get them all?
:{{DIcon}} Every last one.
:'''Moco:''' Oh my gosh, you're awesome!
:'''Hillie:''' Traveler, you're the best person ever!
:'''Moco:''' Thanks! Now Adelinde won't be on our backs.
:'''Hillie:''' Please take these as our thank-you gift.
:'''Moco:''' Right, we've got other places to clean now. Thanks again! See you.

;(Report back after destroying the hay with Pyro)
:'''Moco:''' What did you go and do that for!? You've burned down the haystack!
:'''Hillie:''' Gee thanks... now Adelinde's gonna freak out for sure &mdash; and on top of that, she's definitely gonna fire us too!
:{{DIcon}} It was an accident...
:'''Moco:''' Ugh, we should've just kept on picking them out one by one.
:'''Hillie:''' Darn it... There's no way back from this...
:{{DIcon}} I, ah...
:'''Moco:''' Traveler, you'd better get outta here. This was our responsibility.
:'''Hillie:''' It's our fault for getting someone to help who doesn't know a thing about cleaning.
:'''Moco:''' What is Adelinde gonna do when she finds out...
:'''Hillie:''' She's gonna be so mad...
