:'''Farhad:''' When the first public performance debuts, I'll be the first to buy a ticket.
:{{DIcon}} What public performance?
::'''Farhad:''' It's the new play that Mr. [[Zubayr]]'s working on.
::'''Farhad:''' Unsurprisingly, Miss [[Nilou]] will definitely be featured in it.
::'''Farhad:''' Plays at [[Zubayr Theater]] never disappoint. Every time a new production is out, researchers all rush over and grab tickets, no matter what research they have.
::'''Farhad:''' You should definitely check them out.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Farhad:''' Bye!

===A Parade of Providence===
====Dialogue Set #1====
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 farhad 01.ogg}} '''Farhad:''' Things are really shaping up, and there's a buzz around the festival this year. We're expecting people from all over to come by this year and buy things during the festivities.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 farhad 02.ogg}} '''Farhad:''' Don't be fooled into thinking that Sumeru City has the best of everything. Some festival snacks are only offered here in the Grand Bazaar.
:{{A|vo xmaq005 13 farhad 03.ogg}} '''Farhad:''' And when it comes to musicians, dancers, or singers, the Grand Bazaar's got the best of the best! Sure, those folks at the Akademiya might not like it, but what's a festival without song and dance?
{{Dialogue End}}

====Dialogue Set #2====
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Farhad:''' Though work is as boring as ever and Zubayr Theater has no new showings, there seems to be no shortage of prospects as of late!
:'''Farhad:''' Say, friend, are you going to watch the [[Interdarshan Championship]]? I hear Miss Nilou's going to be commentating!
:'''Farhad:''' I wasn't much of a student growing up. Felt like I had an allergy to learning. However, after listening to how Miss Nilou breaks things down, the knowledge seems a lot easier for me to grasp.
:'''Farhad:''' If you missed Miss Nilou's commentary, it's your loss.
