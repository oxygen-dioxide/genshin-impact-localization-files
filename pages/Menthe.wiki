'''Menthe''' is an open-world [[NPC]] located in [[Fontaine]].  A member of the Gardes, she is dedicated to her job to the point of constantly almost working herself toward exhaustion, and is a recurring NPC in the Daily Commission "Get a Drink at Least!", ordering a cup of Clarity Coffee to keep herself going through her shift. 

Following a certain dialogue branch for the first time gives the player one [[Guide to Order]].

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Menthe:''' Oh, esteemed [[Neuvillette|Iudex]], the life of a small person truly is difficult...
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
::'''Menthe:''' Thank you, kind soul. Would you be willing to hear a Melusine's troubles?
::'''Menthe:''' Perhaps I'm at fault for having been too enthusiastic about integrating into human life, but I've gradually found that there are a lot of difficult things to adapt to.
::'''Menthe:''' Humans use such... large things in their daily lives. Take clothes for example &mdash; sure, we can just buy a shirt and use it as a dress, too, but we still need to get the cuffs tailored...
::'''Menthe:''' And if we want to rent an apartment, we can only buy children's furniture &mdash; and even then, I have to step on a stool to reach the windows...
::'''Menthe:''' If only I had a body like [[Sigewinne]]'s... or maybe I should just go underwater...
::{{DIcon}} Um, don't do anything rash, alright?
:::'''Menthe:''' Huh?&nbsp;...Oh, don't misunderstand! There's no need to worry, in any case &mdash; we Melusines are excellent in the water.
:::'''Menthe:''' When I say "underwater," I'm referring to [[Fortress of Meropide|the place where Sigewinne works]]. She's a companion of ours, but she looks more like a human.
:::'''Menthe:''' She welcomes friends from the [[Marechaussee Phantom]] to drink tea with her in her infirmary, but she's against us working there for a long time, unless we want to switch to work of a more medical bent.
:::'''Menthe:''' That's because many of those underwater have been sent there by the Marechaussee Phantom, so they probably wouldn't want to see uniformed Melusines...
:::'''Menthe:''' Is it too late for me to change jobs?
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} It's never too late to start.
::::'''Menthe:''' Whoa, spoken just like Monsieur Neuvillette. It's just that with my hands and eyes, there's a lot of human work that I can't do...
::::'''Menthe:''' In terms of ability, I'm more suited to the work at the Marechaussee Phantom. Everyone has their own strengths to utilize and duties to perform. I guess that is probably the order in life.
:::;(Obtain {{Item|Guide to Order|x=1}})
:{{DIcon}} Keep your chin up!
::'''Menthe:''' Yeah... Yeah! Just give me a moment to drink a cup of tea first, and I'll...
