I can't quite remember what exactly the blessings are for. Or who told me about them. But blessings are good &mdash; that's what my notes say.

I want to bless you. This is something I won't forget.

I've gathered a lot of wood, and I want to light the fire with you.

If you're here, I won't be afraid of the heat.

But Dr. [[Baizhu]] did say it's better to stick [[Mist Flower]] petals on my forehead. Hmm... it feels cool and comforting. When you arrive, I'll put some on you too.
