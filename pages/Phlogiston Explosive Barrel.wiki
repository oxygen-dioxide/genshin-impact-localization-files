'''Phlogiston Explosive Barrel''' is an exploration mechanic and [[Exploding Barrel]] variant in [[Natlan]]. It will generate 1 [[Phlogiston]] Particle upon exploding, partially refilling the player's Phlogiston meter (as long as they are within range).

An [[Saurian Indwelling|indwelled]] [[Yumkasaurus]] or [[Kinich]] can make use of these barrels to launch at enemies in place of [[Flamegranate]].
