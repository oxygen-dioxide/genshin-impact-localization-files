'''Secret Art''' is a [[Special Dish]] that the player has a chance to obtain by cooking [[Tatacos]] with [[Citlali]].

Secret Art revives a character and restores '''20'''% of Max HP, then restores an additional '''1,500''' HP to the target fallen character with a 120-second cooldown. Like most foods, this cannot target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]].
