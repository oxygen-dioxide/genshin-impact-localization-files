The bloodthirsty berserker ravaged the lands, fighting humans and monsters alike, and even challenged the gods.<br />In a barren and lifeless land, he encountered a giant monster.<br />His iron mask could not conceal his rage, and so an endless fight ensued.<br />Hours, days, and years passed. The monster was finally defeated.<br />The berserker sucked out the marrow of the monster's broken horn. This was how the victor drank to his success.
