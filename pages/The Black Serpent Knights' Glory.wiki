==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Dainsleif figures out the Abyss Order's plan from the {{sic|twins'}} memories left within the Inteyvat flower. Now to see if you can stop them or not...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Upon arriving at the chamber at the center of the ruins' summit)
{{Cutscene Description|The device activates, causing Dainsleif, the hilichurls, and almost everyone on the scene great pain. In this key moment, Halfdan strides forth and uses his body to block the powerful light.}}
::'''Dainsleif:''' Look, the amplification device!
::'''Paimon:''' Dain!
::'''Dainsleif:''' Am I too late...
::'''Dainsleif:''' They're in agony...
::'''Dainsleif:''' This is no way for them to meet their end
::'''Dainsleif:''' Find a way...
::'''Dainsleif:''' To stop that thing!
::'''Dainsleif:''' Halfdan!
::'''Dainsleif:''' Don't do it...

:{{A|vo szaq104 1 dainsleif 01.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' I thought he would've been turned to ashes in an instant... Halfdan's soul is extraordinarily resilient.
:{{A|vo szaq104 1 invokerelectric 01.ogg}} '''Abyss Lector:''' Meddling fool! Encumber us no more...
:{{A|vo szaq104 1 dainsleif 02.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Don't you have a greater encumbrance to worry about? Come on, this is your grand opportunity to get rid of me.
:{{A|vo szaq104 1 invokerelectric 02.ogg}} '''Abyss Lector:''' ...Dainsleif!!!
:{{A|vo szaq104 1 dainsleif 03.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Take him out, and deactivate the device!

----

;(After defeating the Abyss Lector)
:{{A|vo szaq104 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What do we do now? The Abyss Lector's gone, but the device won't stop...
:{{A|vo szaq104 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And Halfdan...
:{{DIcon}} Let me take his place.
:{{DIcon}} The cleansing won't have any effect on me.
:{{A|vo szaq104 2 dainsleif 01.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' No! As long as the device is active, the cursed are rendered powerless. Only you can take on the Abyss.
:{{A|vo szaq104 2 dainsleif 02.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' If you value his sacrifice, then do not waste any more time here.
:{{A|vo szaq104 2 dainsleif 03.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' See all these rays of light and portals? They must have installed several of these energy devices in various locations. Find them! Quickly!
:{{A|vo szaq104 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So we have to... go through these Abyss portals? ...Hey, wait for Paimon!

----

;(After destroying the first charging device)
:{{A|vo szaq104 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The hilichurls are really suffering... Wait! Dain, this must be unbearable for you, too, right?
:{{A|vo szaq104 2 dainsleif 04.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Never mind that. Halfdan and the others are enduring far greater suffering than I. There's no time to lose!

;(After destroying the second charging device)
:{{A|vo szaq104 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Quick, destroy the devices and put an end to the hilichurls' suffering!

;(After destroying the last charging device)
:{{A|vo szaq104 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, it's gone dark all around now. Shall we head back to the room in the center?

----

;(Investigate the device in the central chamber)
:{{A|vo szaq104 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's it, right? The device is fully shut down now?
:{{A|vo szaq104 3 dainsleif 01.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' The burning sensation has indeed stopped...
:{{A|vo szaq104 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So we managed to stop the Abyss Order's plan?
:{{DIcon}} But... Halfdan...
:{{DIcon}} He seems to have breathed his last.
:{{A|vo szaq104 3 dainsleif 02.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' ...
:{{A|vo szaq104 3 dainsleif 03.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Let me check.
:{{A|vo szaq104 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Dain must be really upset...
:{{A|vo szaq104 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Of all the ways to be reunited with one of his former comrades after so long... This is rough...
:{{A|vo szaq104 3 dainsleif 04.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' ...
:{{A|vo szaq104 3 dainsleif 05.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' ...Let's go.
{{Cutscene Description|Just as you thought it was all over, a light once again shines from behind you: the final radiance of Halfdan's soul. He says to Dainsleif:<br />"Apologies, Captain Dainsleif, Twilight Sword. Back then... I failed you, and failed to protect our people."<br />"No, for five hundred years, you have faithfully done your duty."<br />"To this day, I am proud of you all."<br />"Khaenri'ah... didn't fall, did it? Since you're still here..."<br />"Correct."<br />Having received Dain's acknowledgment, the valiant knight can finally rest in peace.<br />"So... no need to revive the homeland," Dainsleif murmurs softly.}}

::{{A|vo szaq104 2 cs dainsleif 04.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Correct
::{{A|vo szaq104 2 cs dainsleif 05.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' So... no need to revive the homeland

:{{A|vo szaq104 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That was Halfdan's soul...
:{{A|vo szaq104 4 dainsleif 01.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' More than one kind of strange power exists here. Souls are no strange sight under the circumstances.
:{{A|vo szaq104 4 dainsleif 02.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Still, if you intend to venture deeper in and continue your investigation, you ought to be careful.
:{{A|vo szaq104 4 dainsleif 03.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' *cough*...
:{{A|vo szaq104 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You bet, we'll be super careful. Oh, but... Dain, does this mean you're not coming with us?
:{{A|vo szaq104 4 dainsleif 04.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' That device took a severe toll on me. It will take me some time to recover.
:{{A|vo szaq104 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, right... Well, actually, Paimon already knew that. You've clearly been pushing through the pain this whole time!
:{{A|vo szaq104 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You've earned a good rest, Dain... Ooh, you should take a vacation!
:{{A|vo szaq104 4 dainsleif 05.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' "Vacation"? Huh, the very notion. This word has no business being in my vocabulary.
:{{A|vo szaq104 4 dainsleif 06.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' There are more important things that demand my attention. The "Loom of Fate" operation is still underway.
:{{A|vo szaq104 4 dainsleif 07.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' And I suspect that these amplification devices are connected to that plan.
:{{DIcon}} I will be on the lookout.
:{{DIcon}} We will talk more next time. After you've recovered.
:{{A|vo szaq104 4 dainsleif 08.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' Thank you for understanding.
:{{A|vo szaq104 4 dainsleif 09.ogg}} '''Dainsleif:''' I only hope that next time we meet, you know whose side you're on.
:{{A|vo szaq104 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sheesh! He sure knows how to hold a grudge, saving that snide remark right till the end...
:{{A|vo szaq104 4 paimon 06a.ogg}} {{A|vo szaq104 4 paimon 06b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, shame that we didn't get to see your {{MC|sister|brother|mc=1}} again, but at least we learned some useful info, huh?
:{{A|vo szaq104 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' As long as you keep pressing on with your journey, you guys will definitely meet again, and everything will be back to normal, right?
:{{A|vo szaq104 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon almost forgot &mdash; the real reason we came here was to investigate what was going on with the hilichurls, wasn't it?
:{{A|vo szaq104 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've probably seen enough to report back to the miner now. But, uh... how are we going to explain it to him? This is all way too complicated for regular people to understand!
:{{A|vo szaq104 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Meh, we'll figure it out &mdash; just don't forget about the commission when we're done here.
;(Quest completes)
----
;(Talk to Yuehui again after the quest ends)
:{{A|vo szaq105 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mr. Miner, we're back and ready to report!
:{{A|vo szaq105 1 yuehui 01.ogg}} '''Yuehui:''' Ah! Am I glad to see you again! I was getting nervous... At first, I figured I'm paying a fair price, and these are professionals. But then I thought... Goodness, I'd hate to send someone off on a strange commission and then for something bad to happen to them...
:{{A|vo szaq105 1 yuehui 02.ogg}} '''Yuehui:''' I'd never be able to forgive myself if you came to any harm!
:{{A|vo szaq105 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't you worry, mister, it was nothing we couldn't handle! Anyway, we're back, aren't we? And the good news is, we got to the bottom of what's been going on!
:{{A|vo szaq105 1 yuehui 03.ogg}} '''Yuehui:''' Excellent, excellent! So then, what's the situation down there?
:{{A|vo szaq105 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Heh, well... Ummm...
:{{DIcon}} It's like a hilichurl hospice.
::{{A|vo szaq105 1 yuehui 04a.ogg}} '''Yuehui:''' Huh? ...Hospice?
:{{DIcon}} Hilichurl utopia. Hili-topia, if you will.
::{{A|vo szaq105 1 yuehui 04b.ogg}} '''Yuehui:''' Sorry, hili-topia...?
:{{A|vo szaq105 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Uh, basically, the hilichurls down there don't wanna fight anymore. Leave them in peace, and they won't cause you any trouble.
:{{DIcon}} What Paimon said.
:{{DIcon}} You have nothing to worry about.
:{{A|vo szaq105 1 yuehui 05.ogg}} '''Yuehui:''' Well, we certainly wouldn't be going out of our way to provoke them, you can count on that. The last thing any of us miners are looking for is to stir up trouble... All we're looking for is, well, all that glitters.
:{{A|vo szaq105 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Now there's a philosophy that Paimon can get behind.
:{{A|vo szaq105 1 yuehui 06.ogg}} '''Yuehui:''' ...I gotta be honest, I didn't really understand the situation you were describing, but having your assurance that everything's okay is the main thing. It means we can get back to work straight away.
:{{A|vo szaq105 1 yuehui 07.ogg}} '''Yuehui:''' I'm very grateful to you both! You came a long way for this. Please take these as compensation.
