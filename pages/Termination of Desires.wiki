|zh_note  = {{zh|妄}} in this context is likely associated with having unrealistic thoughts, and {{zh|执}} (or {{zh|執}}) likely associates with excessive attachment. {{zh|何}} can mean "what" instead of "why", so an alternative translation would be "For What Do We Crave, To What Do We Cling". Since the subject is omitted in the original text, "we" can be substituted with any other pronouns.
