{{Quest Description|You and Paimon bump into a squad of Fatui at the Masters of the Night-Wind, and you meet their employer. Thus does a commission from Fontaine find its way to you...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the Fatui)
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What are the Fatui doing here?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's a little concerning... Let's go over there and see what they're up to.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Also, how did they get this close to a tribal settlement?
:{{DIcon}} Well, considering what The Captain did for Natlan...
:{{DIcon}} Maybe they've been given a bit more leeway.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... All the Fatui left in Natlan are probably The Captain's subordinates. That basically makes them followers of one of Natlan's heroes.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Still, once a Fatuus always a Fatuus. Something seems off, seeing them here... Let's go check it out!

;(Talk to the Fatui)
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahem! What are you guys doing here?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 grudoc 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Heh, following orders. If you have a problem, take it up with our employer.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, what's with the attitude? Can the Fatui even work for a private employer?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Ahem! This is Grudoc &mdash; I hired him to be my bodyguard in Natlan. As you can see, he's not the sociable type. I'm sorry for any offense.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 02.ogg}} '''???:''' My original plan was to hire someone from the local tribes, but a priest recommended Grudoc and his squad.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 03.ogg}} '''???:''' I was told they were capable fighters and had the time to spare, so they fit the bill... It seems like the Fatui's reputation in Natlan is quite positive.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, that's what happened... Then, you must be from Fontaine?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 04a.ogg}} {{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 04b.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' Precisely! Montluson, at your service. I work in the publication business. And you two... Wait, you must be {{Traveler}} and {{MC|m=his|f=her}} fairy companion!
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you know us?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 05.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' A golden-haired Traveler with a floating companion... There's no mistake!
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 06.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' Your exploits in Fontaine have all the makings of a best-selling series! I'd be a failure of a book merchant if I couldn't recognize you.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, we're really famous at this point, {{Traveler}}!
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 07.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' It's truly my lucky day! I know this is sudden, but I was actually looking for you two... You see, I have a favor to ask.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, you... chased us all the way to Natlan? That's a little creepy...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 08.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' You'll be generously rewarded, I promise you!
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Well, at least he got straight to the point. Should we hear what he has to say?
:{{DIcon}} Something tells me we can't escape this one.
:{{DIcon}} And if the pay is good...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *ahem*... Alright, we'll hear your request.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 09.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' You know the great shaman, Citlali, right? I need her help with something!
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Yeah, but the chances of her helping a random stranger just because we asked...
:{{DIcon}} With her personality? Pretty slim...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, Citlali really doesn't like dealing with strangers...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 10.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' I heard about that from other members of her tribe. But, they told me if one person could convince her, it would be the golden-haired Traveler.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 11.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' If you manage it, I'll even double your pay!
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Why do you need her help?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, yeah... We should definitely get to the bottom of that first.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 12.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' It's kind of a long story, and there's tribal history involved, so you should hear it from an expert. Allier, if you could...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 allier 01.ogg}} '''Allier:''' Of course! I don't often have an eager audience for this kind of thing... Nice to meet you. The name's Allier &mdash; I'm a Researcher from the Fontaine Research Institute.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 allier 02.ogg}} '''Allier:''' Unlike most researchers, I have a keen interest in ancient ruins. That's why I was invited to join Monsieur Montluson's team.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 allier 03.ogg}} '''Allier:''' Have you heard the legend of the great shaman, [[Huitzilin]]?
:{{DIcon}} It sounds familiar...
:{{DIcon}} She's the one that worked with colors, right?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 allier 04.ogg}} '''Allier:''' Yes. According to local records, she was a color mystic who lived over two hundred years ago, the most adept in her tribe at using that particular technique.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 allier 05.ogg}} '''Allier:''' Out of all her exploits, her most celebrated is "the Battle of Seven Colors."
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 allier 06.ogg}} '''Allier:''' According to legend, the battle was triggered by an Abyss invasion, one of the most brutal in Natlan's history, even from a greater historical perspective.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 allier 07.ogg}} '''Allier:''' Amazingly, Natlan was able to turn the tide despite being at an extreme disadvantage. The key to victory was none other than a "color" Huitzilin created on the battlefield.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 allier 08.ogg}} '''Allier:''' The "color" was extraordinary &mdash; illusory in appearance while also seeming to possess physical form. Legend has it that Huitzilin used the "color" to construct a magnificent maze on the battlefield...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 allier 09.ogg}} '''Allier:''' ...And trap all the enemies inside. This allowed her allies to launch a counterattack and, ultimately, secure victory.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 13.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' *ahem*... Anyway, that's the gist of it. We don't want to take up too much of your time.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 14.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' That story is the reason I came to Natlan. I often publish books about the history of other nations. They always end up faring well on the market.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 15.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' When I heard this story for the first time, I wanted to include it in my next collection, but...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 16.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' Historical records about Natlan aren't very detailed. We haven't been able to determine where the battle took place, or find any definitive evidence that it occurred at all.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 17.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' Even within the Masters of the Night-Wind, people dispute the legitimacy of the story. Some believe it to be a myth.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 18.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' If that were the case, the story would not be fit for publication...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, but, if you're just including it in a story collection, why does it matter if it never happened?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 19.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' Well, you see, the slogan for the collection is "restoring the truth of history." Naturally, I need it to be factual.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 20.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' That's why I'm here. The Masters of the Night-Wind are said to have a tradition of recording past events, so I wanted to consult their records.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 21.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' But, I was refused access to the Obsidian Altar. Application after application, and all I received were a few ordinary woven scrolls with nothing to offer. Honestly, I'm just trying to promote their history, and they make such a fuss...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 allier 10.ogg}} '''Allier:''' According to my research, their scrolls are considered sacred relics in addition to historical records. Naturally, outsiders are rarely granted access.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 allier 11.ogg}} '''Allier:''' Not to mention, the scrolls we did get to review actually contain a huge amount of information. I just need more time, and I could&mdash;
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 22.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' We've been over this, Allier. There's no need to waste time on those scrolls when we have a better way.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Citlali, you mean?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 23.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' Exactly. You're well aware, I'm sure, that Citlali has been alive for more than two hundred years. That means she lived during the era of the Battle of Seven Colors!
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 24.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' If she agrees to be my consultant, then no other historical records are necessary.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that's what you want...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 25.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' So, what do you say? I'll quadruple the pay if it helps sweeten the deal!
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, it's not that we don't want to help you...
:{{DIcon}} We actually should go ask her, Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} We still have a duty to fulfill, after all.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, right! The duty the chief gave us has a lot to do with Huitzilin...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who knows? The "Battle of Seven Colors" might lead us in the right direction!
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, we'll help you convince Citlali. Just let us do the talking, okay?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 2 montluson 26.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' Of course!
----
;(Approach Citlali's home)
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 3 montluson 01.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' So, this is where the great shaman lives? A bit... far from civilization, isn't it? I hope the person who pointed us in this direction wasn't mistaken...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' For someone like Citlali, it actually makes a lot of sense.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 3 allier 01.ogg}} '''Allier:''' Is this graffiti her work, too? I wonder if it's a cultural practice... If I could just copy it down&mdash;
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 3 montluson 02.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' We're here for a reason, Allier. As agreed, you two can do the talking, and we'll wait for you here.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, we'll go knock on the door! Hopefully she's not hungover...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Citlali? Are you there? We need your help with something!
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...No response. Maybe she's not home?
:{{DIcon}} Let's try her other name.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, uh... Granny Itztli? Are you home?
:{{Black Screen|The door is thrown open, and you're met with the pungent smell of alcohol.}}

:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (So, Citlali's a real hermit, huh...)
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 3 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' ...{{Traveler}}!

:{{Black Screen|The door closes abruptly.}}
:{{Color|menu|You hear the sound of things being packed up from behind the door...}}
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Looks like we came at a bad time.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 3 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' *ahem*! Are you still there? Just come in, we can talk inside.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, at least we didn't get turned away...

;(Talk to Allier, Montluson or Grudoc, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xtlllq003 allier 01.ogg}} '''Allier:''' A great shaman who has lived for hundreds of years... If she agrees to help us, there are so many things we could research!
:{{A|vo dialog xtlllq003 montluson 01.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' Allier, as the provider of your research funding, I suggest you focus on our current mission. It's very important to me.
:{{A|vo dialog xtlllq003 allier 02.ogg}} '''Allier:''' Sorry. Maybe, if we get a chance in the future, then...
:{{A|vo dialog xtlllq003 montluson 02.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

;(Enter [[Citlali's Home|Citlali's home]])
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, so this is where Citlali lives...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I, uh, didn't have time to fully clean up the place... Complain if you want. Menial housework means nothing to a great shaman like myself.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Besides, in light novels, people who keep everything neat and tidy are always too boring to be the protagonists.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Also, I'm not a hermit. I'm just above superficial rules of societal etiquette.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She sure does care a lot about what we think of her...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 citlali 04.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Oh, and that spell I used to transfer my senses to you... You're not still, uh, experiencing the side-effects, are you?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 citlali 05.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' It's my duty as a great shaman to check that kind of thing.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you mean when we could hear your thoughts? Nope! It's been so long. We don't have to worry about that anymore, right?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 citlali 06.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Then, why do I hear {{Traveler}}'s thoughts in my head?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What?
:{{DIcon}} (Oh, she heard me call her a hermit... That bothers her? I thought she was "above superficial rules of societal etiquette"...)
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 citlali 07.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I can still hear you, y'know!
:{{DIcon}} I apologize for offending you...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 citlali 08.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Don't bother, I'll find a way to fix it. First you hear my thoughts, now I'm hearing your thoughts...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 citlali 09.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' It was just a simple spell. I use it on you, and now it's on the fritz...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 citlali 10.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Forget it. Just tell me why you're here.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, someone asked us... to ask you... to be their consultant. They have questions about the history of Natlan.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 citlali 11.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' So, they asked the hero of Natlan to put in a good word? Sounds like they know I don't usually trouble myself with other people's problems.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The pay is really good!
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 citlali 12.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Doesn't matter. I'm busy.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She sure doesn't look busy... Paimon knew this wouldn't get us anywhere...
:{{DIcon}} What if the request comes from me?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 citlali 13.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' From you...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, we were given a sacred duty to help your tribe weave a special scroll!
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 citlali 14.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Huh? So, you're the appointed ones this time?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We were surprised, too! After all, we have no idea how to weave a scroll like that.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, with Chief Biram's help, we were able to make some progress!
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We still haven't succeeded, but we learned that the key to weaving the scroll is a special kind of color.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The historical event those men want to ask about also involves color. If you help them, you might end up helping us, too!
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 citlali 15.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' ...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She's giving us that face again... Did Paimon not explain things clearly?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 citlali 16.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I can't decide whether this twist is completely out of the blue, or if it was foreshadowed all along...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... Does that mean you won't help us?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 citlali 17.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I... I need to think about it.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then, there's still hope!
:{{Color|menu|Hurried knocks on the door can be heard from outside...}}
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 grudoc 01.ogg}} '''Grudoc:''' Hey! What's the hold-up? Just give us an answer already!
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Y&mdash;You agreed to let us do the talking!
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 citlali 18.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Ugh...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 4 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Citlali...
:{{Black Screen|Citlali suddenly walks out, and you rush after her.}}
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 montluson 01.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' Stand down, Grudoc! As your employer, if I tell you to wait, then you wait.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 grudoc 01.ogg}} '''Grudoc:''' Understood.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 montluson 02.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' You're the great shaman who's been alive for centuries? But you're so... Ahem, apologies for the disturbance. Grudoc is a recent hire &mdash; so difficult to restrain sometimes.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew... You're lucky you didn't force Citlali's hand.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 montluson 03.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' Well, since you're here, how about a discussion...?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Do you have any idea who I am? Did you think Granny Itztli would be fooled by your little performance?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 montluson 04.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' Um...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I have no intention of speaking to you. Your "recent hire" interrupted me right as I was about to make an important decision.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Pull a trick like that again, and I'll make your lives a living horror novel, except ten times worse. That's all I came out here to say.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 citlali 04.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' {{Traveler}}, we have a discussion to finish.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 montluson 05.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' You live up to your name, Granny Itztli. I apologize for the offence. I'm just surprised the Battle of Seven Colors didn't pique your interest...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 citlali 05.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' You're investigating the Battle of Seven Colors?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 montluson 06.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' Ah, {{Traveler}} didn't get to that part?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 montluson 07.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' Yes, I thought {{Traveler}} could help me convince you. But, if I'm not mistaken, you have a personal interest in this matter, don't you?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 montluson 08.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' I heard that the great shaman, Huitzilin, was a friend of yours. You two must have been close...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 montluson 09.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' If I can resolve the controversy and prove the Battle took place, I'll include it in my next collection. Then, all of Teyvat will learn the truth.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 montluson 10.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' With your support, your friend's heroic deeds will once again be known throughout the land... Inspiring, don't you think?
:{{DIcon}} You'll be helping me fulfill my duty.
:{{DIcon}} And it would mean a lot to your tribe.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 citlali 06.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' If this is really about that duty, then... Fine, I'll help you.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 montluson 11.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' I'm honored&mdash;
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 citlali 07.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Save it &mdash; I agreed to help {{Traveler}}, not you. You'll just have to leech what you can.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, at least she agreed to help...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Looks like my friendship with Citlali came in handy after all. I never took her to be the heartless type, anyway.)
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 citlali 08.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Who are you calling heartless?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 montluson 12.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' Not a problem! I always planned to work with {{Traveler}}.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 montluson 13.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' So, did you directly experience any events of the Battle? Do you have any idea where it took place? Can you think of any relics we could use to prove it?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 citlali 09.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Talk at me why don't you...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 montluson 14.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' Um...
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to know, too.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 citlali 10.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Fine &mdash; no, no, and no.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 montluson 15.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' Uh...
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 citlali 11.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I did live during the same era as her, but that doesn't mean we experienced the same events. I've lived a long time, but I'm not a walking encyclopedia.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 citlali 12.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' You decide the angle of your investigation, and I'll provide answers if I'm familiar with the subject.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 montluson 16.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' ...Alright. Even if you didn't witness the battle yourself, you still lived through that era. Your insights are very valuable!
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 montluson 17.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' Allier, you had an idea about where to start, yes?
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 allier 01.ogg}} '''Allier:''' Oh, well, my plan was to consult the members of the tribe in charge of recording history.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 montluson 18.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' Then, let's start there.
:{{A|vo xtlllq003 6 montluson 19.ogg}} '''Montluson:''' {{Traveler}}, what do you say to officially working together? After all, it appears I can only get Miss Citlali's help through you.
:{{DIcon}} Sounds good.
