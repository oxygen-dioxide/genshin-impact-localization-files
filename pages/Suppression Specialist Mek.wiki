==Descriptions==
{{Description|A clockwork meka adapted from the Cal. [[Carter Scherbius|Scherbius]] type. Unfortunately, aside from its ability to attack, it has no other capabilities.<br>Clockwork meka based on annihilation energy normally produce their energy by utilizing Repeaters composed of special crystals to refine [[ousia]] and [[pneuma]] from [[Fontaine]]'s environment. But outside of Fontaine, they can use pre-prepared Energy Blocks to move over short distances for short periods of time. The difference can be observed from the shape of the crystal components on the meka.|[[Archive]]}}
