==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Liath:''' Ah, such fine weather &mdash; you think so too, don't you?
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Liath:''' I'm patrolling... and enjoying the weather as I do.
::'''Liath:''' Whether rain or shine, it's a good day for a [[Melusine]].
::;(Becomes available after {{Quest|Ancient Colors}})
:::{{DIcon}} Could you tell me about the Melusines?
:::'''Liath:''' You'd like to know more about us?
:::'''Liath:''' Hmm... Well, we were born from the flesh and blood of the giant beast [[Elynas (NPC)|Elynas]].
:::'''Liath:''' Don't be shocked by that. Elynas is a gentle mother who taught us children how to survive in this world.
:::'''Liath:''' Later, however, Elynas ceased speaking, and so we asked [[Neuvillette|Monsieur Neuvillette]] to take us to the [[Court of Fontaine]] to live.
:::'''Liath:''' And that's how I came to be here, patrolling this place in my uniform. We've had lots of help &mdash; we're a very fortunate race, I think.
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} About this uniform...
:::'''Liath:''' We work with human beings to protect Fontaine &mdash; such is the mission entrusted to us by Monsieur Neuvillette.
:::'''Liath:''' Even though Monsieur Neuvillette has been very kind to us, we were only able to join the [[Marechaussee Phantom]] after going through training and tests, just like humans.
:::'''Liath:''' I guess this is the "fairness" that people from the [[Palais Mermonia]] keep talking about.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Guide to Equity}})
:{{DIcon}} I shan't bother you further, then.
::'''Liath:''' There's no problem. We can enjoy the weather together!
