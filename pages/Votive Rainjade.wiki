{{Description|The ancestors of the people of Chenyu Vale once offered jade by throwing it into the waters, transferring adeptal energy into spirit veins. Thus was their homeland protected and favorable weather secured, guaranteeing abundant harvests. But today the ancient rites have long since been utterly forgotten. If the lost adeptal energy could be gathered into the jade once more, then perhaps the blessings of the soil and water may be granted once more...}}
