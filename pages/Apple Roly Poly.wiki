|desc_suspicious = Apples are apples, and dough is dough. To force them into a commonality they do not share is to create an awkward mess that even the most flavorful butter cannot rescue.

|desc_delicious  = The mere aroma of the apples gives a feeling akin to situating oneself before a warm hearth. Before you can even think to slowly appreciate it, your hands move as if compelled by some other person, knife and fork in tow, reaching out for the next piece.
