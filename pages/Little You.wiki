==Profile==
<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->
Little Luo is the younger sister of [[Little Zuo]]. She often plays alone by chasing after her shadow even though she wants to play with her older brother.  She doesn't invite him to play with her because she's afraid of being a bothersome sister. However, her brother believes that Little Luo hates him so he plays on his own catching frogs by the riverbank.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Little Zuo}}</ref>

She also greatly admires her smart older brother. She wants to be as smart as him so that her grandfather will stop worrying about her and her parents would return from working in the city. She believes that catching her shadow will prove that she is smart.

{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Little You:''' *sigh* It got away, again... Ah! Stranger danger!
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry, I won't hurt you. What are you chasing?
::'''Little You:''' My shadow. Everyone says I won't be able to catch it, including my big brother.
::'''Little You:''' My big brother is the smartest person I know. He can do anything I ask him to! But even he couldn't catch my shadow...
::'''Little You:''' I'm sure there must be a way, though, and once I've caught it, it'll prove that I'm as smart as him!
::{{DIcon}} I can help you.
:::'''Little You:''' Thanks for the offer, but I can do it.
:::'''Little You:''' I'm the one my whole family worries about, and I've had enough of it.
:::'''Little You:''' If I prove I'm as smart as my big brother then granddad will stop worrying about me, and so will mommy and daddy, who work far away from home.
::{{DIcon}} Why don't you play with your big brother?
:::'''Little You:''' I really want to, but... It seems like he doesn't want to, he's really busy and&mdash; and I think he might be trying to avoid me.
:::'''Little You:''' Grandad says I should be a good girl. I don't want to annoy my big brother.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Little You:''' Bye-bye!
