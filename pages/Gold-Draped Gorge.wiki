Xilonen wears two piercings on her ocelot-shaped ears: a black and gold triangular design with cyan accents, and a black ring-shaped piercing. She wears a black choker along with a large gold and silver necklace with diamond-shaped chains and a heart-shaped ornament, where her {{Geo}} [[Vision]] is attached. Her outfit features a white crop top with straps across the back, linked to a larger black underlayer top. She also wears hip-length jean shorts with frayed edges tied by a spiked belt with a metallic buckle.

She dons a loose off-shoulder sleeveless coat with grid patterns and black fur. Golden ornaments with orange gemstones dangle from the fur. The coat itself is a mix of black, white, gold, orange, and with long coattails extending to her calves and ending in triangular golden fringes. Her footwear consists of wedge sandals with straps that extend upward to her mid-calves. Xilonen's right arm is adorned with a black detached sleeve resembling an archer's bracer. Her left arm features various bracelets, with a larger silver and gold zigzag bracelet on her wrist. Both hands are decorated with rings, and her left thigh is embellished with golden diamond patterns and glittering golden sparks. Gold and black nail polish additionally adorns her fingers and toes.
