==Trivia==
* {{Mail Attachments by Category List}}
* To celebrate Klee's birthday, the [[Teyvat Food Notes]] released a [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/16721 real-life recipe] for Fish-Flavored Toast and Fisherman's Toast.
* According to the official recipe, this dish is made from a slice of toast, 20 ml of {{w|Marinara sauce}} (regular tomato sauce will work fine too), 15 g of butter, 10 g of onion, 2 pieces of basil, and 30 g of mozzarella.
** As such, despite having the word "fish" in its name, both the in-game recipe and the real one contain no seafood.

===Etymology===
* The original Chinese version uses a name that translates to Yuxiang Toast, where ''{{w|yuxiang}}'' literally means "fish fragrance" but refers to a specific kind of seasoning mixture in Chinese cuisine, which in fact contains no seafood. Since this dish is not from Liyue (China) but from Mondstadt (Germany and Austria), ''yuxiang'' (translated as "fish-flavored" in the English version) in this context probably refers to Marinara sauce, which literally means "mariner's sauce."
