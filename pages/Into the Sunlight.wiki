;(Approach the ruins)
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What is this place?
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 01.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Somewhere long forgotten by everyone. It used to be a grand building. Now, it's nothing more than a pile of rubble.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 02.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' No one comes here anymore, nor does anyone care about what once happened here. Although, this place does have something to do with the story I'm about to tell you.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 03.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' It was before I became a [[Harbinger]], and before Lyney and the others joined the House of the Hearth. Due to certain events, I first killed Clervie, and then her mother... and this is where it all happened.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You were the one that killed Clervie!?
:{{DIcon}} Why?
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 04.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Patience, now. Allow me to explain Clervie's side of the story first. I'll start from the beginning.

:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 05.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Clervie was six years old when she was brought by her mother, [[Crucabena]], to live in the House of the Hearth. From the outside, it seemed like a fairytale &mdash; a thriving family made up of kind adults and friendly children.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 06.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Crucabena was The Knave at that time, and the House of the Hearth was under her control. She was Clervie's mother by blood, but she was also the "Mother" to all the children in the House.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 07.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Clervie was happy here... for a time. But, she quickly realized that being part of this "family"... wasn't a fairytale at all. It was a kind of purgatory.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Purgatory?
:<gallery widths="350">
Into the Sunlight Quest Still 2.png
</gallery>
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 08.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Exactly. The House of the Hearth takes in war orphans from all over Teyvat, but as for how to raise them... That depends entirely on the person in charge.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 09.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Crucabena came up with a novel idea. She would teach the children to fight, force them to duel each other, and then crown, as the "king" of the House, the child who proved themselves most worthy of inheriting her title.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 10.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' It's difficult to estimate the number of children who died or were maimed in the process. There's little I can say about the ones who died. The ones that emerged with permanent injuries, on the other hand... Well, they still served a purpose.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 11.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' They would be handed over to The Doctor to be experimented on, or sent away on dangerous missions... nothing more than tools to be used and then discarded.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So those were the experiments Clervie was talking about... But what actually happened to her?
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You said that Clervie was Crucabena's daughter, so if Clervie tried to convince her to stop what she was doing, Crucabena probably would've listened... right?
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 12.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Despite being Clervie's mother, Crucabena cared little for her daughter. She forced Clervie to join the House of the Hearth only as a means to demonstrate her own impartiality as a "Mother" &mdash; to prove that she treated all her children equally.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 13.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Clervie did try to convince her mother to change her ways, but it was to no avail. After her efforts failed, the only other option was to rise up and try to fight back. Unfortunately, the other children had already been thoroughly indoctrinated into the illusion of happiness Crucabena had created.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 14.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Of course, there was one exception... someone Clervie's age who knew the truth about the House of the Hearth. Her name was Peruere.
:{{DIcon}} "Perrie"?
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, the friend that Clervie mentioned?
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 15.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' "Friend," huh... I suppose we can call her that for now.

</gallery>
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 16.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Clervie was a cheerful and passionate person with a tenacious spirit. Peruere, on the other hand, was rather cold-blooded.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 17.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Her cold-blooded nature allowed her to see through Crucabena's facade. Yet, it was also this cold-bloodedness that prevented her from acting against it... at least at first. While Clervie longed for freedom, Peruere was convinced that, amid all the fighting and violence, she would make it until the end.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 18.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Despite their differences, the two became fast friends &mdash; united by their knowledge of the truth. Clervie told Peruere that she hoped to create a real family where no one would be killed or sacrificed.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 19.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' There may have been a certain naivete to her ideas, but Clervie proved her determination many times over. She tried countless times to run away, ask for help, or expose the truth, but her efforts only earned her beating after beating. The only thing that kept her going was her strength of will.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 20.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Even with her body wracked with pain, she would still stand on her tip-toes and open the window at night. She and Peruere would look out at the moon together, a fierce longing for freedom shining in her eyes... But, one day, that light... simply vanished.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no... What happened?
:<gallery widths="350">
Into the Sunlight Quest Still 4.png
</gallery>
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 21.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Her hopelessness resulted from a culmination of things. Ten years had passed &mdash; ten years' worth of failure after failure. She and Peruere weren't children anymore, but finding any chance to escape still seemed as hopeless as ever.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 22.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' It was during this time that Peruere suggested a new plan... If escaping was out of the question, why not take down the very person sitting on top of this throne of lies &mdash; "Mother" herself.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 23.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Clervie rejected that proposal. She claimed that, as a famous Harbinger, Crucabena possessed an unimaginable amount of power. Trying to kill her would have an incredibly low chance of success.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 24.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Clervie never gave another reason, but Peruere could see it written all over her face. Clervie still thought of Crucabena as her mother. Killing her own flesh and blood was a line she couldn't bring herself to cross.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 25.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' If she couldn't escape and fight back... Then only one option remained.
:{{DIcon}} Death...
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 26.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Precisely. Death was the only way that she felt she could be free.
:<gallery widths="350">
Into the Sunlight Quest Still 5.png
</gallery>
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 27.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' It happened during a duel. When she arrived at the dueling ring that day, her partner turned out to be none other than Peruere, the very person that had stood by her side all those years. It was a fierce battle, but, ultimately, Clervie decided to let Peruere end her life.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 28.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' From that moment on, Peruere's journey was one written in flames. When the rain finally came and washed it all away, there she stood &mdash; the sole victor in "Mother's" endless game of slaughter, a trail of corpses strewn across her path to success.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 29.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' It was the very result she had predicted ten years prior. Even then, she believed she would make it until the end. She wasn't surprised by the fact that she emerged as "Mother's" undisputed heir. Rather, her success left her with an inexplicable sense of restlessness.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 30.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' She was unsettled, and there was only one thing that could quell that sensation... Perhaps you two would like to take a guess as to what it was?
:{{DIcon}} Killing the person at the very top?
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Crucabena, you mean? But, but...
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 31.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Correct. This is the place where Peruere killed her best friend. A mere year later, this is also the place where she fought tooth and nail to kill the "Mother" they shared.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 32.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' The moment she acted, any conception of what was right or wrong ceased to matter. It's one of the principles of the House &mdash; only those who survive get to write the rules.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 33.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Peruere won the battle and became a Harbinger herself, after which Her Majesty the Tsaritsa bestowed upon her a new name... Arlecchino.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, the "Perrie" Clervie was talking about... It was you all along. You're Peruere! Arlecchino is just a name you got later!
:{{DIcon}} This was your story just as much as Clervie's...
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 34.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' I left that name behind long ago. I must say, hearing it now... does bring back memories.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 35.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' After I defeated Crucabena, the moniker of "Mother" died with her. I chose to forgo the title she called herself and even chose to give up my own name. I rebuilt the House of the Hearth under a new identity... not only as Arlecchino, but as "Father."
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 36.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' And that is where the story ends. Any more questions?
:{{DIcon}} The Clervie we met, though... Who is she exactly?
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, based on what you just told us, Clervie wasn't a little kid when she was killed. So the Clervie we met... Was she really a spirit at all?
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 37.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' I suppose you could call her an illusion born of flame... Her existence is like ashes to a fire &mdash; something leftover in the wake of blaze and ruin.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 38.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' You see, a certain power runs through my veins. It's not unlike a curse. My flames leave behind shadows of anything they consume.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 39.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Of course, the chances of those shadows morphing into a sentient entity are exceedingly slim. Clervie is a very special case.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 40.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Clervie died when she was sixteen years old, but what emerged from the flames was her six-year-old self. Her appearance wasn't the only thing affected. Most of her memories were lost to the blaze as well.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 41.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Memory is a mysterious thing indeed. Losing a portion of your memories will alter your sense of self. Lose ten years' worth, however, and it would be like living in the past, like returning to a version of yourself that never grew up.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No wonder Paimon got such a weird feeling when we were talking to her...
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 42.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Perhaps I should put it this way... Clervie is someone trapped in time. It may seem like she exists with us in the present, but she truly lives in the confines of her own past.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, if all of that is true, then you must've known about Clervie for a long time!
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 43.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Indeed. She's a rather volatile and unstable entity. Sometimes, she would look after the children. She's even saved some of their lives.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 44.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' But, other times, she would hide from me and become obsessed with revealing the "truth" about the House to anyone who will listen.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 45.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Shadows don't have the capacity to learn or grow. Any new information they encounter is quickly forgotten over time.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 46.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Your attempts to expose Clervie to sunlight... They failed, yes? The reason is actually quite simple. In Clervie's mind, the House is impossible to escape, and it is this very perception that traps her there.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 47.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' But, no matter. All I have to do is kill her again and all will be resolved. I don't anticipate so much as a single speck of ash will be left behind this time.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait!
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon can understand why you might want her gone... But isn't there any other way?
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So what if she's trapped in her six-year-old self! She's still your friend! At least talk to her first!
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 48.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' It's too late for that. She broke the rules, and now she must be punished. That goes for [[Filliol]] and [[Nanteuil]] as well. She's had quite the effect on them...
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 49.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' I hope you understand, the difference between Crucabena and myself lies in our formulation of the rules, not our policy for enforcing them. Upholding the rules without question is a trait we both share, because that is how a household should be run.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 hero 01.ogg}} {{A|vo arlq004 1 heroine 01.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' ...
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 hero 02.ogg}} {{A|vo arlq004 1 heroine 02.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' Is this really what you want to do?
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 50.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Whatever could you mean?
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 hero 03.ogg}} {{A|vo arlq004 1 heroine 03.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' Don't you... want to say a proper goodbye at least?
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 51.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Whether as a "killer" or as a "Father," there are two things that must be avoided at all costs &mdash; anger and sorrow.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 52.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Anger makes you impulsive. Sorrow causes you to waver.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 53.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Well, it appears it's about time to proceed. Before we arrived, I told some of my well-behaved children to bring our troublemakers here by nightfall.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 54.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' I do believe I've kept my end of the deal. I gave your friends quite a bit more time. As for what happens now, we'll just have to wait and see.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 chapleau 01.ogg}} '''Chapleau:''' Here they are, "Father."
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 foltz 01.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' You gonna execute 'em? Seeing something like that would actually be a first for me.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lyney!
:{{DIcon}} Clervie...
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I'm sorry. I heard about how you helped buy us more time...
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But, I still failed. I couldn't find a way to fulfill her wish.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 creirve 01.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Huh...
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 creirve 02.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Are you... Perrie?
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 55.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Indeed. It's been a while, Clervie.
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 creirve 03.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Perrie!
:{{A|vo arlq004 1 arlecchino 56.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Shh... Stay right there. I'm sorry to postpone our reunion, but first, I believe certain scores need settling.
{{Quest Description|update|Once The Knave has spoken of the past, the other children of the Hearth are summoned. How will she judge them?}}
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' "Father," let me explain...
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 arlecchino 01.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Out of my way.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' "Father"...
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 arlecchino 02.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' You chose to conceal a threat to the House, and for that, you must be punished.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 arlecchino 03.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Overall, however, I suppose your wrongdoing is hardly the most egregious of the bunch, so I'll deal with your punishments later. As for right now, the more pressing concerns are the traitors among us.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 filliol 01.ogg}} '''Filliol:''' By traitors... do you mean us?
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 nanteuil 01.ogg}} '''Nanteuil:''' "Father," let me explain. We didn't mean to&mdash;
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 arlecchino 04.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Foltz, why don't you share what you heard.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 foltz 01.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' Yes, "Father."
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 foltz 02.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' Secret midnight meeting number 3. Participants: Filliol, Nanteuil, [[Sotto]], [[Tadie]]...
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 foltz 03.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' Nanteuil clearly said, "If only 'Father' wasn't the one who took us in."
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 foltz 04.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' Sotto added, "I'm sick of this life. I just want to live as a normal person."
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 foltz 05.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' Filliol was the worst of them all. She called us crazies and said a bunch of mean things about "Father"...
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 filliol 02.ogg}} '''Filliol:''' I did not!
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 filliol 03.ogg}} '''Filliol:''' You're... You're lying! Foltz is trying to frame us!
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 foltz 06.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' It's not like I'm the only one who heard those things. After that, you and Tadie and a bunch of other people started talking about Clervie. You were using all those things Clervie brought up as an excuse to question "Father."
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 foltz 07.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' "We're birds locked in a cage. The only way out is to destroy it." That's what you said, wasn't it?
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 filliol 04.ogg}} '''Filliol:''' You little... You just want me gone, don't you! What did I ever do to you, huh!?
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 filliol 05.ogg}} '''Filliol:''' And you, Chapleau... Have you forgotten who stood by your sickbed, watched over you, and changed your dressings? C'mon, let's hear it, then &mdash; what's your reason for all this?
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 chapleau 01.ogg}} '''Chapleau:''' ...
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 foltz 08.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' You're wrong, Filliol.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 foltz 09.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' We don't want you to die. You're our family.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 filliol 06.ogg}} '''Filliol:''' Liar. You wouldn't be doing this if that were the case. So, why? Why have you backed us into a corner?
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 foltz 10.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' We all live in the House of the Hearth. You know the type of work we do, Filliol.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 foltz 11.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' A single betrayal can cost dozens of us our lives. It's not like it's never happened before. That kind of thing is hard to forget.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 foltz 12.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' That's why the House of the Hearth cannot tolerate any form of betrayal. Ever since we came to Poisson, you've had seven secret meetings. A lot of the things you talked about really crossed the line.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 filliol 07.ogg}} '''Filliol:''' You've been spying on us for half a month? Wait a second, now that I think about it... The move to Poisson was just a way to make it easier to spy on us, wasn't it? 'Cause we were all in one place! You've had this planned all along...
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 chapleau 02.ogg}} '''Chapleau:''' Filliol, Nanteuil, I'm sorry...
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 chapleau 03.ogg}} '''Chapleau:''' I owe you both my life. I owe Clervie too. If it weren't for all your help after I got poisoned, I wouldn't be standing here today.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 chapleau 04.ogg}} '''Chapleau:''' If this were any other situation, I would do anything to repay that kindness, even if it cost me my life. But, rules are rules. I'm sorry, my hands are tied.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 filliol 08.ogg}} '''Filliol:''' Why... *sobbing*... Why...
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 nanteuil 02.ogg}} '''Nanteuil:''' That's enough, Filliol. We made a mistake, and we should own up to it. We broke the rules &mdash; plain and simple, and now we have to face the consequences.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 nanteuil 03.ogg}} '''Nanteuil:''' I'm sorry, Chapleau, Foltz. I'm sorry, "Father."
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 nanteuil 04.ogg}} '''Nanteuil:''' We... accept our punishment.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 arlecchino 05.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Chapleau, according to the rules of the House of the Hearth, how should these traitors be punished?
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 chapleau 05.ogg}} '''Chapleau:''' All those who betray the House pay with their lives.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 arlecchino 06.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' And so it shall be.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 filliol 09.ogg}} '''Filliol:''' *sobbing*...
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' "Father"! Please wait!
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 arlecchino 07.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Something you want to say, Lyney?
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...Please reconsider, "Father." What Filliol and the others did... Does it really count as betrayal?
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' We all come from broken families. From the very first day we joined the House of the Hearth, we wanted nothing more than to make it a real home.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But the truth is... none of us know what a real home should look like.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I'm not saying I have all the answers. All I know is this &mdash; killing Filliol and the others may uphold the rules, but doing so will only bring us further away from being a real family than we've ever been.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' So, please, "Father"... Please reconsider!
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I agree with Lyney.

:{{A|vo arlq004 2 arlecchino 11.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Precisely. The rules of the House will not be altered. Traitors must be punished.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 arlecchino 12.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' However, resolving disputes with a duel is also one of our rules, one that also applies to me. Demonstrate a sufficient showing of strength, and I shall offer a concession.

:{{A|vo arlq004 2 arlecchino 13.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Anger makes you impulsive. Sorrow causes you to waver.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Back then, she never actually answered my question.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (But that makes the answer pretty obvious, doesn't it?)
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looking at that expression on her face, she seems really serious about this. Guess that means there's no chance she's throwing the duel on purpose, huh...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (There's no way The Knave will lose on purpose. Although...)
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' When guests are around, families are often on their best behavior... and any disputes are less likely to escalate...
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 arlecchino 14.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' When the time comes, make the choice that you deem most appropriate in the situation, and lend your help to the House of the Hearth.

:{{A|vo arlq004 2 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to see for myself what the Fourth of the Fatui Harbingers can do.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're asking to join the duel against The Knave!?
:{{DIcon}} If that's okay.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 arlecchino 15.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' I'll allow it. We do have a ready-made dueling ring at our disposal, after all.
:{{A|vo arlq004 2 arlecchino 16.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' All I would advise is this &mdash; keep a firm grasp on your weapon, and give it your all. Any less, and you may just lose your life.

:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 03.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' However, everyone involved in the duel demonstrated a remarkable level of strength and determination. In light of this, I'm prepared to change the method of execution.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 04.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Heloir, the bottled flames I gave you for safekeeping... Do you still have them?
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 heloir 01.ogg}} '''Heloir:''' Y&mdash;Yes! I wasn't sure what they were for, but I've kept them super safe! I didn't lose a single one!
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 05.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Wonderful. Then, in just a moment, I'll have you administer them.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 nanteuil 02.ogg}} '''Nanteuil:''' Bottled flames...?
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 06.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Indeed. They're the product of a secret experiment. Under certain special circumstances, flames can be extracted from my person and preserved.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 07.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Once ingested, searing pain will spread across every inch of your body. No harm will come to you physically, but your memories will be burned away.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 08.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' If you can withstand the pain... When you awake, you'll have forgotten everything you know about the House of the Hearth, and will be expelled from the organization.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 09.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' In other words, administering this concoction will "kill" the version of you that grew up in the House, and give you a new identity.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (So that means... The young man that I thought looked familiar, the one selling newspapers outside the Palais Mermonia... He must have been the same Horrer we saw on the list of executions. He wasn't killed at all...)
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 10.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Memory is a mysterious thing indeed. Losing a portion of your memories will alter your sense of self...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (No, if my understanding of The Knave is right, she really thinks of that as "killing" him. The Horrer that lived in the House of the Hearth is dead. The one that remains is simply a normal person living out his life with his beloved.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Even so, it's much better than actually ending their lives.)
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 filliol 02.ogg}} '''Filliol:''' So, you're just... letting us go, "Father"?
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 11.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' You misunderstand. Memories are extremely important. Once consumed by flame, the version of you standing before me will die, and our secrets will die with you. So, no, I don't intend to just "let you go," because the person who survives will be nothing but a stranger.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 filliol 03.ogg}} '''Filliol:''' Even so... Even so... *sobbing*... I won't have to live in fear anymore...
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 filliol 04.ogg}} '''Filliol:''' I'm sorry, "Father." I'm sorry I let you down. But I... I really...
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 12.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Don't cry, Filliol.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 13.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' You haven't left the House yet, so there are still rules to be followed, yes? Remember what I taught you &mdash; anger makes you impulsive, sorrow causes you to waver. Don't let yourself be controlled by your emotions.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 filliol 05.ogg}} '''Filliol:''' Of course... I'll remember.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 14.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Dry your tears and go pursue the life you really want.

:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 16.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' I prepared three extra vials of bottled flames. As for whether to take them, the choice is yours.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 17.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Goodbye, children. The next time we meet, I will no longer be your "Father."
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 18.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Thank you for all you've done for the House. I hope you have bright futures ahead of you.

:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 19.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Clervie.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 creirve 01.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Can we talk now? I've been waiting for a super long time.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 creirve 02.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' You really are Perrie, aren't you? I haven't seen you in so long. How come you're all grown up?
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 creirve 03.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Wait, did I somehow travel to the future on accident? Or, am I dreaming? Huh, what a long dream&mdash;
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 20.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Neither... You died, Clervie. That's what happened.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You could've at least sugarcoated it a little! Look! She's stunned speechless!
:{{DIcon}} (If this really is Clervie's younger self...)
:{{DIcon}} (Then I would say she's probably had enough lies.)
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 creirve 04.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Oh... Okay then.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? That's it? You accepted it just like that?
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 creirve 05.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Yep. If that's what Perrie says happened, then I believe her. Perrie wouldn't lie to me.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 creirve 06.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Plus, I don't really need to know why I'm like this. I'm more curious about what happens in the future. If you're a Harbinger now, Perrie, that means Mother is gone, isn't she?
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 creirve 07.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Can you tell me about it? I wanna know what happened to her... and to me.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 21.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' You never stopped trying to defy fate.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 22.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' At first, no one believed you. You could only vent your frustrations to the moon. In fact, you often sought comfort in the night sky. You wanted to see the aurora, so one night, we promised each other we would go to [[Snezhnaya]] to see it together.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 23.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Later on, you tried to run away, but you were brought back each time. "Mother" spared your life, but it wasn't out of kindness. Instead, she decided to make an example of you by slowly torturing you over time. That way, the other children would know what happens to traitors.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 24.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Still, you never gave up. "Mother" hoped that, through ruthless duel after ruthless duel, she would be able to crown an ultimate victor among the children she raised.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 25.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' But you called on everyone to unite, to fight to a draw in order to reduce casualties. Your efforts may have only delayed the inevitable, but still... you gave them hope.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 26.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' You tried everything you could think of, but every attempt ended in failure. Still, you never turned your sword on Crucabena, and you never turned it on me. On that gloomy day, you told me&mdash;
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 27.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' "For the last sixteen years of my life, I've done everything I can to fight for freedom. But now, I realize that the only freedom I truly possess is the freedom to choose to die."
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 creirve 08.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' I never imagined I would say something like that. I must've been feeling really worn down.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 creirve 09.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' But, somehow, I still think I understand. According to Mother's plan, only one of us was going to make it until the end... And I always hoped that person would be you.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 creirve 10.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' If I could do it all over again, I still don't think I would make a different choice. Even when I first met you, I knew you'd be able to do what I couldn't.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 28.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Is that so? Even now, I'm not sure I truly understand what kind of freedom you were trying to pursue.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 29.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' But, as the head of the House of the Hearth and as the children's "Father," I've tried to give them the most basic of freedoms &mdash; the freedom to choose their own fate.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 30.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' It's something I discussed with the [[Neuvillette|Iudex of Fontaine]]. The children who want to leave the House will have their memories wiped clean of all secrets pertaining to the organization. In return, they will be allowed to live a normal life in Fontaine without being prosecuted for their past.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 arlecchino 31.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Of course, I won't simply hand freedom to them on a silver platter. They have to fight for it and prove themselves worthy of it. Only freedom that is earned has true value.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 creirve 11.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' That's more than enough. That's exactly the kind of life I was fighting for.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 creirve 12.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Y'know, Perrie... I think you're a pretty amazing "king" and a really great "Father" too.
:{{A|vo arlq004 3 creirve 13.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' I'm really happy that you're the one who took over the House. I guess I do have one regret, though. I still haven't seen the outside world!

:{{A|vo arlq004 4 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Lynette and Freminet feel the same way. They're recuperating back at the Hotel Bouffes d'ete. But, I decided to come back and tell you where we stood.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 arlecchino 06.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' I'm sure you're well aware of the expectations I have for you. I want you to follow in my footsteps and become the next "king" of the House. Yet, you seem to have different ideas.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 arlecchino 07.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' I must admit, I'm rather surprised by your decision to stay. There's nothing wrong with choosing to live a quiet life. Leading this organization is a heavy responsibility, one not so easily carried by someone forced onto the throne.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I just... never understood what you saw in me... what made you believe I was deserving of that throne.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 arlecchino 08.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' You're brave, talented... And, most importantly, you cherish your family.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 arlecchino 09.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' You would do anything to protect them &mdash; even if it costs you your life.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...
<!-- flashback begins -->
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 chapleau 01.ogg}} '''Chapleau:''' Speaking up back there was so brave of you, Lyney! It's all thanks to you that we were able to convince "Father" to back down.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 foltz 01.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' You're a hero, Lyney!
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' (Hero... "Father" is the real hero.)
<!-- flashback ends -->
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' (Had "Father" gone all out during the duel, there's no way I would've walked away with my life. She must have had it all planned from the beginning, from the very moment she suggested a duel...)
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I'm not deserving of that title. I'm not strong enough or smart enough...
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 arlecchino 10.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' You're wrong.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 arlecchino 11.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' In my opinion, all you need to be deserving of the throne is conviction, and the necessary strength to act on it.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 arlecchino 12.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' We may have different ideas of what it means to be a family, but you can hardly be said to lack conviction. What you truly lack is strength. For someone of your talent, though, that's something that will come with time.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 arlecchino 13.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Even without that strength, you still chose to face me in a duel even though the odds were stacked against you. That capacity to honor your convictions is what I truly see in you.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' "Father"...
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 arlecchino 14.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' No one knows what the future holds, what tragedy or triumph may be in store. Being at the head of this organization requires the strength of will to face whatever comes. Caution will only hold you back.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 arlecchino 15.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' If reaching a certain standard were required to go after what you want, I would never have succeeded in killing my predecessor. Back then, there was still a considerable gap between our abilities.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 arlecchino 16.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Strength may decide the ultimate victor, but those who let a lack of strength dictate their decisions or undermine their convictions will never be worthy of the throne.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I understand, "Father." Thank you.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 arlecchino 17.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Children must grow up to surpass their parents... Only then can a family continue to flourish.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 arlecchino 18.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' The road ahead is not an easy one, so I'll ask you one last time. Are you certain you want to stay?
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 lyney 12.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You've done so much for me, "Father," and that kindness must be repaid. Plus, with Project Stuzha at hand, there are many dangers ahead, and I, for one, don't intend to back down.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 lyney 13.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...Protecting my family at all costs &mdash; that's my conviction.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 arlecchino 19.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Then you're welcome to stay. As for Project Stuzha, you need not be too concerned. If those cowardly businessmen and heartless dignitaries try to take us down, I'm prepared to teach them a lesson.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 arlecchino 20.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Having members who longed for the light was our organization's last weakness. With those members no longer among our ranks, the House of the Hearth is like a spider hiding in the shadows &mdash; we need only wait for our prey to come to us.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 arlecchino 21.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' At present, our imperative is to use their plan to our advantage. In doing so, a crimson moon shall rise amid the frigid blizzards of winter. No demonstration of loyalty shall go unrewarded, and no sacrifice shall be in vain.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 arlecchino 22.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' As for the two of you, whether we meet again as friend or foe, I'll remember the camaraderie we shared in this moment.
:{{A|vo arlq004 4 arlecchino 23.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' No matter how arduous the journey ahead, I hope we both reach our desired destination.

{{Quest Description|update|As the sun rises, Clervie disappears with it. Regrets are buried thus in yesteryear, and you hear Lyney's voice, right on time and target...}}
;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Didn't Lyney say that Lynette and Freminet were recovering at the Hotel Bouffes d'ete? Paimon wonders how they're doing... Maybe we should go check on them!
{{Quest Description|update|Lynette and Freminet are recuperating at the Hotel Bouffes d'ete. Go see them for a bit.}}
;(Approach Freminet and Lynette)
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lynette, Freminet, how are you feeling?
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Much better.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew, what a relief!
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' What about you? Are you feeling alright?
:{{DIcon}} There's no need to worry.
:{{DIcon}} I'm right as rain!
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I knew you'd come out unscathed... Us, on the other hand, well... We've been bedridden for two days. I couldn't even turn over.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Oh, and I wanted to ask... Is Clervie... gone?
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Lyney and the other members have left Poisson and returned to the House of the Hearth. According to him, there haven't been any more sightings of a spirit roaming the House.
:{{DIcon}} We bid her farewell under a blanket of sunlight.
:{{DIcon}} Her wish has been fulfilled.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I see...
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 freminet 04.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I'm glad...
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 freminet 05.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' "Father" came to check up on us two days ago and told us about what happened with Crucabena and Clervie. Actually, I... I've met Crucabena before.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, what? You've met the former Knave?
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 freminet 06.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Crucabena died a year after Clervie. It was during the year between their deaths that I joined the House of the Hearth.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 freminet 07.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Crucabena had an extremely cruel and radical way of doing things. While she was alive, the atmosphere in the House was suffocating.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 freminet 08.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' When I joined, though, the experiments she valued so much had already come to an end, and all the people involved &mdash; dead and injured alike &mdash; were gone. Crucabena never talked about the past with us newcomers.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 freminet 09.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' A couple months after I joined, "Father" killed Crucabena and burned all her files. With that, the names of all the people subjected to her experiments &mdash; Clervie included &mdash; were lost to the flames, along with the painful memories they represented.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' "Father" took in Lyney and me a couple months after that, but she never mentioned anything about Crucabena or Clervie.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, it really seems like something she was planning to keep to herself.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The last time you talked to her, did she mention why she kept it a secret for so long?
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 lynette 05.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' She said she didn't want us to be affected by the darkness of the past. She was worried we'd develop a false sense of gratitude towards her if we knew about it.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 lynette 06.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' "The foundation of a family should be free of any corrupting influence. Whatever happened in the past, it has nothing to do with who we are now."
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 lynette 07.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...That's what "Father" told us in the end.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 freminet 10.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' But, I still thanked her for everything. It was only after hearing about what Crucabena did that I finally realized how insignificant our lives could have been... The members of the House meant nothing to her. To say that she valued them in any way, even just as a tool, would probably be giving her too much credit.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 freminet 11.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' If "Father" hadn't taken over the House of the Hearth, I probably would've already...
:{{DIcon}} Don't think about that.
:{{DIcon}} She saved you in the end.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 lynette 08.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' "Father" rarely brings up the fact that she saved us. She doesn't believe that being indebted to her should be what ties us together.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 lynette 09.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' But, even if we didn't owe her anything, we would still choose to stay. Because this is our home.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 lynette 10.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' We may have arguments or times when we feel wronged. Some people may even choose to leave. But, as long as "Father" is here, we will always have a home.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 freminet 12.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Whether the path before us is bathed in sunlight or shrouded in shadow, we'll follow "Father" wherever she chooses to go.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 freminet 13.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' So, I wanted to say thank you for helping us make it through this crisis. Without your help, we could've lost a lot more along the way.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, we didn't do anything, really.
:{{DIcon}} Just invite us back as guests and we'll call it even!
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 freminet 14.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Of course! You're welcome any time.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are... Filliol and Nanteuil okay?
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 lynette 11.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I actually saw them at a cafe this morning.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 lynette 12.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' They didn't recognize me. From what I could tell, they were drinking coffee and talking about one of the operas that started running recently.
:{{A|vo arlq004 5 lynette 13.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' They seemed happy. If I had to take a guess, I would say they finally found the kind of life they always wished for.
