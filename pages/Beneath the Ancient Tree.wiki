==Attacks and Abilities==
Unlike the Trounce Domain [[Beneath the Dragon-Queller]], during the story domain, Azhdaha stays in '''Phase 1''' and does not infuse himself with any elements.
'''Note: All attack and ability names are unofficial.'''
*'''Linear Strike''': Slamming its head below, Azhdaha unleashes ground explosions that move in a straight line.
*'''Body Slam''': Slams his body sideways.
*'''Three Waves''': Slams his foreleg once, and emits three consecutive shockwaves.
*'''Double Slam''': Slams both of his forelegs, and emits shockwave upon each impact.
*'''Tail Slam''': Slams his tail once if target is behind.
*'''Tail Sweep''': Performs a quick Tail Sweep attack.
*'''Skewer''': Rushes forward, goring enemy units on with his massive tusks, tossing them into the air.
*'''Burrow''': Submerges underground and digs around the arena. This action will trigger a massive earthquake and rocks will rains on the arena for a while. Azhdaha will deal damage every time he resurfaces.
