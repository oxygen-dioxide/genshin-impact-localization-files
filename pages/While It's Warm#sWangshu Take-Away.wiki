:{{DIcon|Quest}} I heard that someone placed a custom order...
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' That they did, alright. There's a guest lodging here named Ling'guan. She ordered a serving of [[Special Almond Tofu|Almond Tofu]] a while earlier and, after paying, wanted me to deliver it to someplace north of [[Dihua Marsh]].
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' But we've been really busy here at the inn, and I haven't the time to go out and deliver the food myself. If you could help me out, that would be great. I'll be sure to compensate you fairly.
:{{DIcon}} Well, I'm heading off.
::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Aye, best be about it.
::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Make sure you {{Color|buzzword|avoid monsters at all costs. If you get any weird elements on your person or take a hard knock, that food's toast}}.
::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Needless to say, if the food's ruined, the customer isn't taking it.
::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Alright, then, run along. Don't keep the customer waiting, now.
