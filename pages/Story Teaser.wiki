'''Story Teasers''' are videos released by official Genshin Impact media. Most teasers are animated cutscenes featured in [[Archon Quests|Archon]] and [[Story Quests|Story]], and [[Event]] [[Quests]]. "Gnostic Chorus" is instead featured in the [[Battle Pass]], and "We Will Be Reunited" was only available outside of the game.
