;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo sgeq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *yawn* That was a refreshing sleep! Let's go to the venue.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's really looking forward to hearing everyone's poems!

;(Approach the stage)
:{{A|vo sgeq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, looks like we're a few people short today...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 2 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Morning, friends. Xingqiu said he wants to take some time and focus on writing poems, so he'll join us later.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 2 mika 01.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Noelle has other duties today, so she asked me to tell everyone not to wait up for her.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, okay. Well, never mind... What about Callirhoe, though? She said she'd be here...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 2 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' I got here really early, but I haven't seen her yet.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 2 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Are you talking about the girl with the blue hair? I saw her on the bridge near Dihua Marsh during my morning training.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 2 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' She looked a little upset, so I didn't want to disturb her...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Upset? Oh no... What should we do? Was it something we said last night? Paimon's worried...
:{{DIcon}} We should go find her.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 2 mika 02.ogg}} '''Mika:''' I agree! If she's run into some kind of trouble, I'd like to help her.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 2 diona 02.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Huh? You're all going? Then I'm coming too!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 2 chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Shall we start with the bridge? We're all here a little early, so there should be time.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good idea. We'll be back in a jiffy!

;(Approach the bridge)
:{{A|vo sgeq003 3 mika 01.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Oh, so this is the place? We ran into her here yesterday, too!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 3 mika 02.ogg}} '''Mika:''' She looked like something was weighing on her mind then as well.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's also not far from where we were dropping those leaves...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 3 mika 03.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Leaves?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, right! We were so busy matching couplets, we forgot to mention...
:{{Black Screen|You tell everyone about your inspiration walk yesterday...}}
:{{A|vo sgeq003 3 mika 04.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Huh, interesting.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 3 mika 05.ogg}} '''Mika:''' I wonder... Could Miss Callirhoe have been the one who wrote that poem on the leaf?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm? What makes you say that?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 3 mika 06.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Oh, sorry, uh... nothing &mdash; well, nothing concrete. Just a hunch, I guess.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 3 mika 07.ogg}} '''Mika:''' It's just... That poem on the leaf kinda gave me the same feeling as when I saw her yesterday. So much sadness...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 3 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Now that you mention it, this is upstream from where we found the poem...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 3 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' ...Huh?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 3 diona 02.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Hey, look! Over there! Another leaf!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Wow, you're right! And this one has writing on too!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' After that leaf!

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo sgeq003 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Argh! Why does it have to float so quickly?

;(Approach the next marked location)
:{{A|vo sgeq003 5 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Can't you just fly over and grab it?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... But Paimon can't swim, what if Paimon accidentally falls into the water...

;(Approach the bridge)
:{{A|vo sgeq003 6 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' It stopped!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Now!

;(Pick up the leaf)<!--{{DIcon|Hand}} Pick up fallen leaf-->
:{{A|vo sgeq003 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew... we finally caught it...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 7 mika 01.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Are the words still legible? Or have they been washed out?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like the ink's intact! Let Paimon take a look at what it says...
::'''Poem on a Fallen Leaf'''
::The desire remains, but the time is past.
::The boy by the spring grows frail too fast.
::But when dreams flow to fruition, where streams join the sea,
::We'll journey on in endless reverie.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? This is related to the poem we wrote in reply yesterday! She must've picked up one of our leaves!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Spring"... "young boy"...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, it's looking a lot like Callirhoe was the one who wrote this.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 7 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' She seems to care a lot about that story, huh.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Actually, when Paimon first saw her, Paimon was wondering...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you think... is it possible that... she's a&mdash;
:{{DIcon}} Let's just focus on finding her first.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 7 mika 02.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Based on the current and accounting for wind strength... everyone, please follow me.
----
;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo sgeq003 8 mika 01.ogg}} '''Mika:''' This should be far enough upstream. Let's split up and search the area.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Calliiiiiiirhoe! Calliiiiiiirhoe!

;(Approach Callirhoe)
:{{A|vo sgeq003 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! She's surrounded by hilichurls! Let's go save her!

;(Approach Callirhoe after defeating the hilichurls)
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew! Callirhoe, are you okay?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What's that!?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' It's a [[Hydro Eidolon|huge water droplet]]!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' ...This is exactly what I saw the other day!
:{{DIcon}} ...Large Water Droplet?
:{{DIcon}} ...Callirhoe?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 01.ogg}} '''???:''' ...Huh? Why are you all looking at me like that?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 02.ogg}} '''???:''' ...Oh no! My body, is it...?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 mika 01.ogg}} '''Mika:''' That voice is definitely Callirhoe's...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Ah! How did this happen... Please wait a moment...
:{{Black Screen|The water droplet turns back into Callirhoe's human form before everyone's eyes...}}
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 04.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Oh no... Did I use up too much energy?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' How did you... What's going on here? Miss Callirhoe, are you some kind of [[adeptus]]?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 05.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' No... I'm so sorry for deceiving you all for so long. Actually, I'm... an [[Oceanid]], who flowed here from [[Fontaine]] long ago...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' What's an Oceanid?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 mika 02.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Ah! The Grand Master has mentioned them before &mdash; the Oceanids were the familiars of the [[Egeria|former Hydro Archon]]. They all fled Fontaine after the archon died, and settled across the world...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 06.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' That's correct... Though, to tell you the truth, I can't even completely recall how I found myself here...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 07.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' I have a vague impression of my ancestral home, but I can't recall clearly anything I saw on my journey...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 08.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' All I know is that by the time I arrived in Mondstadt, I had lost most of my power, and couldn't even sustain a physical form...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 09.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Eventually, I settled in a place called Springvale, where I slowly began to regain my power...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 10.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Springvale is a serene and beautiful place. The water that flows through there is clear and pure, just like the hearts of the people who dwell there.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 diona 02.ogg}} '''Diona:''' So you're the spring fairy of Springvale?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 11.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Yes, Diona, and I remember you too, you know! When you were little, you often came to the spring at night to speak with me.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 diona 03.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Really? You're not messing with me, are ya?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 mika 03.ogg}} '''Mika:''' (I... I always thought that was just a local legend...)
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 12.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Your favorite little pillow, the fish one... Its name is "Bubbles," is it not?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 diona 04.ogg}} '''Diona:''' ...Yep!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 diona 05.ogg}} '''Diona:''' (All those childhood memories... so they weren't just a dream!)
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... if this is true, then all those things written on the leaves...
:{{DIcon}} The moonlight flows like silken honey...
:{{DIcon}} The boy by the spring grows old and frail...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 13.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' I see... So you were the ones who found my leaf...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 14.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Well, you are correct... the spring fairy in "[[Heart of Clear Springs]]" is me.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No wonder you were asking us so many questions about it!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, the boy from the story...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 15.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...Is [[Old Finch|Finch]].
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 16.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' I always loved listening to people's dreams... And still do, to this day.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 17.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Whether they're beautiful, sad, or filled with emotions I couldn't understand at the time...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 18.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' One night, a little boy came to the spring. The tears that fell from his face were more fragile than a moonbeam, and purer than the morning dew...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 19.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' I like humans, and wanted to understand them better. I also wanted to make sense of the feelings contained in his tears that were then a mystery to me...
:{{DIcon}} And so you became friends.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 20.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Yes. We often met under the stars, sharing our stories with one another.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 21.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Sometimes, we'd stay up all night and see who would hear the first bird chirping from the boughs, or the first cicada of summer...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, that sounds lovely.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 22.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' But... One day, just like the book says, I saw an emotion in Finch's eyes that I couldn't reciprocate...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 23.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' I felt out of my depth, in uncharted waters... But I knew all too well that we Lochfolk face a very different fate from that of humans. Whatever was happening, I didn't want it to lead to Finch writing a chapter of his life that he would later come to regret...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 24.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' So, I fled, and never appeared before him again...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 diona 06.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Oh, Callirhoe...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 25.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' My strength returns very slowly, and even after decades... I can only sustain a physical form for a very short time...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 26.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' I once hoped that Finch would be able to move on, and meet me "when the stars in the night sky have all gone out."
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 27.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' But after seeing so many people's stories, and hearing about all their dreams, I have gradually come to understand Finch's heart...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 28.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' This feeling of wanting to respond to his feelings is surging relentlessly in my chest, and I can no longer restrain it.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 29.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' But I'm also scared. Scared that if I go and see him now, I'll bring nothing but disappointment... and even more pain, when it comes time to part...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' (It really is a difficult choice...)
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 mika 04.ogg}} '''Mika:''' ...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 mika 05.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Please, go see him!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 30.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 mika 06.ogg}} '''Mika:''' I know Grandpa Finch, and he's a really kind person! When I was struggling to learn how to draw maps, he was always encouraging me... telling me not to give up, always keep trying, and get out there and have some adventures!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 mika 07.ogg}} '''Mika:''' He often tells me stories about his past, but I've never once seen a look of regret or sadness in his face!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 mika 08.ogg}} '''Mika:''' And even though Grandpa Finch loves adventures, he still stands there by the spring, every day, as if he's waiting for something.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 mika 09.ogg}} '''Mika:''' I believe that he's serious about his feelings for you, Miss Callirhoe! He's never stopped hoping that he'll see you again one day!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 mika 10.ogg}} '''Mika:''' So if you want to see him too... then what are you waiting for!?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 31.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Wow, Mika...
:{{DIcon}} That was great! Didn't know you had it in you.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 mika 11.ogg}} '''Mika:''' ...Huh!? Ah! I&mdash;I... Sorry, I think I got a bit too excited, and... and I just thought... Well, it just sorta came out...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 32.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 33.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' I understand... That settles it. I've decided.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 34.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' I will go back and see Finch.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 mika 12.ogg}} '''Mika:''' ...You will? Amazing! That's great!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 35.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' But... I'd like to ask all of you for some help...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure! Just say the word, we'll help you any way we can.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 36.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Would you come to Springvale with me, and help to bring Finch to my side?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 37.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' I cannot maintain this form for much longer... And I'm worried others will see me how I was just before...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 diona 07.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Leave it to me! I'm really close with Grandpa Finch.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 38.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Also... please keep Finch's and my secret... I wouldn't want Springvale's tranquil waters to become agitated on account of all this...
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 chongyun 05.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Your secret is safe with me.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 mika 13.ogg}} '''Mika:''' I won't tell anyone. That's a promise.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 39.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Great... I can't thank you all enough...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 40.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Aah...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's wrong? Are you gonna turn back into a water droplet?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 41.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' No... I'm sorry, it's just that my mind's racing... As much as I want to talk to him again, I'm still worried that I won't have the words when the time comes...
:{{DIcon}} I have an idea...
:{{DIcon}} Write him a poem.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 42.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' A poem...
:{{DIcon}} All the things you hide deep inside your heart...
:{{DIcon}} Everything you never had the chance to say...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 43.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 44.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Okay, good idea. I'll write him a poem.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 10 kallirhoe 45.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' And it will be called... Heart of Clear Springs.

;(Approach Springvale)
:{{A|vo sgeq003 11 kallirhoe 01.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' *gasp*
:{{A|vo sgeq003 11 mika 01.ogg}} '''Mika:''' ...Are you okay?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 11 kallirhoe 02.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...It's nothing... I'm just scared that I won't be able to maintain this form much longer.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 11 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Okay, don't panic... Wait here, Callirhoe! I'll go fetch Grandpa Finch!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 11 kallirhoe 03.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...Take it slow, Diona.... Finch isn't a young man anymore, he's not as steady on his feet...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 11 kallirhoe 04.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' I can still... hold on... a bit longer...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 11 diona 02.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Okay! Stay strong! You can do it!

;(Talk to Callirhoe, Chongyun, or Mika again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 11 mika 02.ogg}} '''Mika:''' ...How are you holding up? Would you like some support, Miss Callirhoe?
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You can also lean on Paimon if you need!
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 11 kallirhoe 05.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...Thank you, all of you.

;(Approach Old Finch)
:{{A|vo sgeq003 12 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Grandpa Finch!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 12 oldfinch 01.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' Is that Diona? You're back early today.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 12 diona 02.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Today's your special day, Grandpa Finch! Can you come with me?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 12 oldfinch 02.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' Oh? Well, where are we going?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 12 diona 03.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Over there, to the waterfall!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 12 oldfinch 03.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' Haha, did you catch a nice little fishie?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 12 diona 04.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Ugh, just come with me already! This is extremely important!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 12 oldfinch 04.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' But, I promised your father that I'd go to...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 12 diona 05.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Grandpa Finch!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 12 oldfinch 05.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' Alright, alright... No need to get worked up, I'm right behind you...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 12 diona 06.ogg}} '''Diona:''' That's more like it. Now, come on, I'll help you.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 12 oldfinch 06.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' (Ohoho, Draff's daughter is just like him when she's on a mission...)
----<!-- Black screen transition -->
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 01.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Over here, over here! It's okay, Grandpa Finch, take your time.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 01.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' Hmm? What's all this? What are all these people doing here?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 02.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' Even Mika's here? Haha, how's work been going lately?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 03.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' And even some friends from abroad, if I'm not mistaken?&nbsp;...You do know that today's not my birthday, don't you?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Greetings, Mr. Finch. My name is Chongyun. We all met at the poetry gala, and... Well, there's someone we'd like to introduce you to...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 02.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...Finch.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 04.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' ...! That voice... Callirhoe?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 03.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...I didn't think you'd still remember.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 05.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' ...Oh, I remember, hahaha, I remember alright. How could I ever forget?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 06.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' Although, your appearance is different than I recall. Back then, you looked like you'd stepped right out of a fairytale...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 07.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' Oho, but I'm one to talk! Of course a fairy from a fairytale can change forms... In your eyes, I'm probably the one who's changed beyond all recognition...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 04.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Haha... Oh, even after all these years, you still know just what to say to make me laugh.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 08.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' I thought you were only able to appear in the dead of night?&nbsp;...There have been times when I've wondered whether it really was all a dream...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 05.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...I'm sorry I kept you waiting for so long, Finch.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 09.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' ...Oh, it can't have been that long... It's been but the blink of an eye, really.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 06.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...Finch, would you like to hear to a poem I wrote for you?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 10.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' A poem? You write poetry now? Well of course! I'd be delighted to listen... I'll hang on every word that leaves your lips...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 07.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...In that case, let me read you a story about the spring fairy...
;(A [[#Gallery|cinematic]] plays)
::'''Callirhoe:'''
::
::Far from my native land I roamed
::In streams I slept
::Many seasons I met as the suns set and rose
::I searched for a garden to call a home
::And the moonlight ebbed as the water flowed
::A soft breeze beckoned me unto a spring
::"Sleep, weary wanderer, your journey is over"
::"May the dancing petals sweeten your slumber"
::At dawn I hummed the melody of a distant stream
::And the songs in the night serenaded my dreams
::A boy's tender tears trembled through the water
::Stirring me more than any starlight sonata
::He wove me a wreath from past petals and future buds
::I crossed beyond the veil of dreams to the realm of flesh and blood
::"Look at the love that shines from his eager gaze"
::"Answer the call of his heart, lest this moment go to waste"
::The kittens and fireflies invited my heartstrings to sing
::But I was a stranger to the melody of mankind
::And knew not how this tune should begin
::As the river of dreams trickled into the ocean blue
::Every time a crystalfly flapped its wings
::Older it seemed he grew
::But I learned to fathom human ways each stumbling step I took
::And clouds of confusion became crystal clear in the vulnerable verse I wrote
::As seed yearns for soil, and trees for the sun
::A once-foreign melody inside my heart sung
::And it cried out your name on every string it could strum
::Now, I give my dream to you
::May it be in your slumber a sweet spring to quench your thirst
::Now, I hand my heart to you
::Praying my belated promise might meet
::Still with your trust

:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 11.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' ...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 12.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' Yes... This is how I remember you from when we first met...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 13.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' All those years ago... It really has been a long old time, hasn't it?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 08.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...Finch, I...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 14.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' It's okay, I understand. Your poem, it... it explains everything...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 09.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...Thank you, Finch. Please, take this.
:[[File:Heart of the Deep Graphic 1.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 15.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' It's so beautiful...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 10.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' This is a droplet of water condensed from my own power.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 11.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...Finch, I don't have a physical form like humans, and I can't stay by your side. I don't know how long it'll be before I can change back into human form again...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 12.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' But as long as this droplet remains with you, our hearts will always be connected... no matter the distance between us.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 13.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' I will always be one with the spring. From this day onwards, if you call me, I will meet you in your dreams.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (The true Heart of Clear Springs...)
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Waaaah...! It's so romantic!
:{{DIcon}} Shhh...!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 16.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' Hahaha, you've really learned a lot, haven't you? And you don't even mind that the kids are watching...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 14.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...Does it bother you?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 17.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' How could it possibly? This is the happiest moment of my life...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 18.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' I just worry that once I go to sleep, I won't ever want to wake up again...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 15.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Huh!? D&mdash;Don't say that...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 19.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' Hahaha, I'm only joking! Ah, it seems that you still have much to learn.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 16.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Is that right?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 diona 02.ogg}} '''Diona:''' (Hehe, Grandpa Finch and Callirhoe look so happy! What a purrfect moment...)
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 17.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Diona, thank you for fetching Finch for me. I've never forgotten you either.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 diona 03.ogg}} '''Diona:''' I used to chat with you a lot... Wasn't it ever annoying?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 18.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Of course not! You are one of the truest friends I have in the entire world.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 19.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' That's why I gave you your gift. So that a part of me could always be with you.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 diona 04.ogg}} '''Diona:''' ...Huh?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' (Wait... So is Diona's ability to mix delicious drinks from disgusting ingredients a blessing from this water spirit?)
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' (And if so... Is it also possible that my pure-yang spirit is a gift from some being?)
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 20.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 21.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...My physical form is about to disappear.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 22.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Finch...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 20.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' Yes?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 23.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' ...I've never regretted meeting you, or deciding to talk to you that night. Not once, all these long years, not for a single moment.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 21.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' ...It probably goes without saying, but neither have I.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 24.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' Although... it was different from in the stories... that fateful night, I never gave you that kiss...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 kallirhoe 25.ogg}} '''Callirhoe:''' This gift that represents my promise and my love, I give it to you now...
:{{DIcon}} ...Paimon! Close your eyes!
::{{A|vo sgeq003 13 paimon 02a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?
:{{DIcon}} ...Diona! Eyes shut, now!
::{{A|vo sgeq003 13 diona 05b 1.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Hmm?
:{{Black Screen|At moments like this, it's only polite to close your eyes...}}
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 22.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' It's okay, everyone...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 23.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' She's gone now...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? But... Paimon didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 diona 06.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Grandpa Finch...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 24.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' Don't worry now, she hasn't gone far...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 13 oldfinch 25.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' Just like she said, she'll always be one with the spring... by our side, and in our dreams...

;(Talk to Old Finch again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 oldfinch 01.ogg}} '''Old Finch:''' Oh, child, let me stay here a little longer...
----
;(Approach the stage)
:{{A|vo sgeq003 15 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Oh? Hey, you're all back! And it looks like you're in much better spirits than before.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 15 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hu Tao's a step ahead. She's already talking about printing a poetry anthology.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 15 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' She said she "can't wait for everyone's final words, because I'm itching to pull the trigger." By which, I assume she meant she eagerly anticipates receiving everyone's freestyle poetry submissions to help her close the deal.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 15 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Where have you all been? I've been waiting here forever!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 15 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Perhaps they lacked sufficient inspiration, and wished to have an emergency communion with nature? And with any luck, I'll bet they heard some fine poetry along the way...?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 15 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Tone-Deaf Bard! Does this mean that right from the start, you&mdash;
:{{DIcon}} Paimon...!
:{{DIcon}} *cough* We promised...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 15 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Uh... Right from the start, you said you would treat us to a nice meal.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 15 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Huh? Did I?
:{{DIcon}} I think this is worth a meal.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 15 venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Haha, very well! Since {{Traveler}} agrees, then it looks like I can't escape this time.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 15 venti 07.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Diona, dear Diona... Could I trouble you to fix us a couple of your delicious beverages?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 15 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Hmph! You wish!&nbsp;...Alright, well normally I'd never agree, but... Since I happen to be in a good mood today...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 15 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Huh? So just what have you guys been up to all this time? Why does it feel like there are some unspoken words hanging in the air here that everyone is privy to but myself...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 15 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Really? Must be the breeze, you're reading way too much into it.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 15 mika 01.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Y&mdash;Yeah! That's right, we're just, uh... taking a walk. Inspiration walk. Since it worked so well last time.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 15 xingqiu 03.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Oh, so even Mika's in on it...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 15 xingqiu 04.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Chongyun, how about you tell me what happened on the sly? I've just remembered that I heard about a haunted house recently that you'll definitely want to check out!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 15 xingqiu 05.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' I'm willing to bet that even your pure-yang spirit won't be able to scare off these demons!
:{{A|vo sgeq003 15 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I appreciate the gesture, but no thanks. Not this time.
:{{A|vo sgeq003 15 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' And I'm starting to think that... maybe this pure-yang spirit isn't such a bad thing after all...
:{{A|vo sgeq003 15 xingqiu 06.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Huh? What the... What's gotten into you!?
:{{A|vo sgeq003 15 xingqiu 07.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Okay, that confirms it! I call shenanigans, something big definitely went down here!

:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 jifang 02.ogg}} '''Jifang:''' ...So where's the book?
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 hutao 02.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' It's in the works! Just waiting on the poems!

:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 hutao 03.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' They're on the way.
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 jifang 04.ogg}} '''Jifang:''' ...Look, I'm sorry Director Hu, but how do you expect me to talk business with you when you don't even have the poems yet?
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 hutao 04.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' I just figured while we're waiting, we could discuss terms in advance.
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 jifang 05.ogg}} '''Jifang:''' Well, I need to see the content to decide if I even want to sell it, let alone how much to sell it for.
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 hutao 05.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oh, come on, I showed you a sample already, and it was some of my finest work! Besides, you only need a few highlights to sell an anthology!
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 jifang 06.ogg}} '''Jifang:''' ...You think your poem, "Fifteen Tenderloin Steaks" will carry the whole book, do you?
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 hutao 06.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' That and "Square Meals In the Basement"! My consultant, the erudite Mr. Zhongli, described it as a meticulous masterpiece! Ooh &mdash; quote that on the cover! It'll practically sell itself!
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 jifang 07.ogg}} '''Jifang:''' ...Director, we're a small business. If we invest money in printing and nobody buys it, it's my bottom line that's affected.
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 hutao 07.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Don't you worry! I guarantee you, when this anthology comes out, it will take the world by storm! Gods and ghosts alike will weep!
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 hutao 08.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' As a matter of fact, I heard a ghost crying on the way here. If you don't believe me, I can bring it over?
