{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yantasar:''' Welcome to Xocolatl Beverages! Be prepared for a taste of the extraordinary!
:{{DIcon}} Extraordinary?
::'''Yantasar:''' Freshly squeezed with the finest fruits and balanced with the most mysterious spices for the richest flavor you could possibly conceive of!
::'''Yantasar:''' And once you've tasted it, there's no going back! You'll feel like you've had all the world's blessings bestowed upon you by the [[Wayob]], as light as a [[Qucusaurus]] feather floating up into the clouds...
::{{DIcon}} That sound kinda weird...
::'''Yantasar:''' That's because being "weird" is precisely our selling point! I don't know about visitors from other places, but us Natlan natives go in for that kind of thing.
::'''Yantasar:''' Maybe it's the part about blessings from the Wayob and all that. Sounds pretty tempting, huh?
::'''Yantasar:''' To tell you the honest truth... there's actually nothing special about these drinks. But people walk away feeling like they're on cloud nine!
::'''Yantasar:''' But there's nothing to knock about the drinks themselves. Our ingredients are high quality, and very healthy too.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Do we have anything more ordinary around here?
:::'''Yantasar:''' ...
:::'''Yantasar:''' ...
:::'''Yantasar:''' Sorry. I was silent for a long time just now, wasn't I? I just... couldn't really imagine what an ordinary drink would look like.
:::'''Yantasar:''' Does... soup count as a drink? Here's one I made with an ordinary recipe. It should be fine, right?
:::;(Obtain {{Item|Grainfruit Meat Soup|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} Maybe later...
::'''Yantasar:''' Don't forget to come back!
