==Trivia==
*The Chinese name of the soundtrack may be a reference to a poem by {{w|Du Fu}}. The poem{{Lang|zh=贈花卿|zh_tl=To the Honourable Hua}} reads:
**{{zh|錦城絲管日紛紛，半入江風半入雲。<br>此曲只應天上有，人間能得幾回聞？}}<br>The music of {{W|Chengdu}} goes on unceasing; half of the music is lost in the river breeze and half in the clouds.<br>But this song should only belong to heaven; how often can they be heard among us mortals?<ref>Translation from Shih Shun Liu, in ''One Hundred and One Chinese Poems'', Cathay Press, Hong Kong, p. 35; A. R. Davis, in ''The Penguin Book of Chinese Verse: verse translations by Robert Kotewall and Norman L. Smith'', Penguin Books, Baltimore, Maryland, p. 16.</ref><br>
