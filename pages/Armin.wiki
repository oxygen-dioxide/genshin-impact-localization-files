==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Arina:''' I want some time off... When can I get some time off?
:'''Armin:''' Don't you like studying here?
:'''Arina:''' I like studying here! It's just... I'm a little anxious about home...
:'''Armin:''' It will be okay. Mother and father are taking care of the farm. Nothing will go wrong!
:'''Armin:''' When we've learned more, we can make money and help them out!
:'''Armin:''' Then father, mother, you, and Aranara will all live happily ever after.
:'''Arina:''' You're wrong, Armin. The teachers have said many times that Aranara don't exist.
:'''Arina:''' We've been going to classes long enough for us to grow up.
:'''Armin:''' But Vikram told me last time that Aranara do exist...
:'''Arina:''' What he said was that conceptually, Aranara exist.
:'''Armin:''' Aren't conceptual Aranara still Aranara?
:'''Arina:''' Uh... I'm not too sure either. Let's ask the teacher.

==Event Dialogue==
===A Parade of Providence===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Arina:''' I want a break... Why can't the Akademiya give us some time off during the Extravaganza?
:'''Armin:''' Don't you enjoy watching the competition?
:'''Arina:''' No, I do but... If you think about it, we can only watch the competitions if we have a break, right?
:'''Armin:''' Yeah, that makes sense... Though, watching all my senior classmates represent their [[Darshans]] has inadvertently inspired a new drive in me to study!
:'''Armin:''' I've made up my mind. In the future, I'm going to enter the Interdarshan Championship too!
:'''Arina:''' Huh... It's a bit early to be thinking about this, isn't it? Didn't our instructors say that seeking knowledge should be a steady and serious endeavor?
:'''Arina:''' Maybe before considering partaking in a competition that happens once in a blue moon, maybe you should consider which Darshan you want to join first?
{{Dialogue End}}

===Chromatic Ode of Candies and Roses===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Armin:''' Sis, you've got to believe that Aranara are real now!
:'''Arina:''' No. The Aranara we saw, was only what the Dendro Archon willed us to see.
:'''Arina:''' Sweet dreams are wonderful, but don't confuse them with reality. It's like dreaming about getting a perfect score on an exam. You still need to hit the books after you wake.
:'''Armin:''' Sis, you're being scary again...
:'''Arina:''' I only speak the truth, and I'll say it again. The teacher has already said it many times. Aranara do not exist.
:'''Armin:''' But... what if... What if there's things even the teacher doesn't know...
:'''Arina:''' Well... I'm not saying it's wrong to doubt your teacher, but I'm still not changing my mind about the Aranara.
:'''Arina:''' If you want to believe in them, Armin, that's fine! After all, you're still young.
