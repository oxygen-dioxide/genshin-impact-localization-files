'''Mine passageways''' ''(unofficial term)'' link two locations in [[The Chasm (Subregion)|The Chasm]], one in the [[Underground Mines]] and the other in [[Teyvat]]. Upon entering an entrance, the player will spawn in the other area's entrance.

==Locations==
===Location #1===
The main one-way passageway that links [[The Chasm's Maw]] to the highest [[Teleport Waypoint]] in [[Ad-Hoc Main Tunnel]]. It is initially blocked off by a magic seal set up by the [[Liyue Qixing]], and dispelled upon completing the [[Surreptitious Seven-Star Seal Sundering]] [[World Quest]]. The Underground Mines can be entered by either falling directly into the hole itself, or interacting with the crane platform suspended above it.

===Location #2===
Links [[Tiangong Gorge]] to a small pond southwest of [[The Chasm Withered Tree]] in [[The Chasm: Main Mining Area]], occupied by a small group of [[Treasure Hoarders]]. This passageway is two-way and can be entered by either side, but the Tiangong Gorge entrance is blocked off by a gate that can only be opened from the inside. A [[Chests|Luxurious Chest]] is available in the Tiangong Gorge entrance. Finding this secret passageway also awards the achievement, {{LL|"All We Need Is Some Firewood and Some Vinegar..."|.}}

Links a Treasure Hoarder camp west of [[Glaze Peak]] to the [[Den of Thieves]] in The Chasm: Main Mining Area. This passageway is one-way only from the surface with its entrance blocked off by a straw mat that can be burned with [[Pyro]]. It is part of the [[Lumenspar in the Den of Thieves]] [[Hidden Exploration Objective]].
