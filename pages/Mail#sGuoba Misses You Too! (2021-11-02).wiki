|text    = [[Guoba]] was causing a bit of a ruckus early this morning. It took me some time watching his gesticulations to realize that he wants you to come and celebrate my birthday with me!

And you know what? I was just looking for you too! I caught some [[fish]] in the [[Liyue Harbor|harbor]] today. They weren't the prettiest, but they were super fatty. So I gave cooking them a go, and they tasted divine! Why don't you try some? Here, have some whole fish, too &mdash; just in case you wanna have at them yourself! I'm sure you'll figure out what to do.

Actually, hmm... What shall we do after dinner... You know what? How about you decide? We've got all day. We can grab some food, bring Guoba along, and go anywhere you want!
