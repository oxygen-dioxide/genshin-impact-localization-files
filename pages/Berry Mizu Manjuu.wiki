|desc_suspicious = It certainly looks like "mizu," or water &mdash; but unfortunately, it tastes like it too. Where did you go wrong?
|desc_basic      = The transparent skin wraps the yellow filling. It is said that some vendors will put these snacks into a small clay bowl and immerse it in water to ensure that the cool mouthfeel is retained. This dish is as transparent as water, but it will not be washed away by flowing water &mdash; this is probably the origin of the name.
|desc_delicious  = The regular, round balls sit upon the plate like coalesced flowing water, and their fillings glisten like pearls. During warm seasons, the very sight of this dish is a balm to the soul, and when it enters your mouth, the mild sweetness that flows out from within causes all your frustrations to vanish without a trace.
