|text1  = Travelers must adjust different gear components and place these components on columns to allow them to interact with one another and activate the final driven gear component.
|image2 = Tutorial Evermotion Mechanical Painting 2.png
|text2  = Travelers can place each gear component on a column's upper or lower levels, but take note that each column can only fit one such component.
|image3 = Tutorial Evermotion Mechanical Painting 3.png
|text3  = Gear components at different levels cannot connect directly, but they can be connected through duplex gear components. These duplex gear components can also be inverted.
|image4 = Tutorial Evermotion Mechanical Painting 4.png
|text4  = When fitting gear components, you may sometimes find that a certain component may stack with other columns or components, thus making placement impossible.
