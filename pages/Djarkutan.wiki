: {{DIcon|Idle}} The soil composition...
:: {{A|VO Djarkutan 01.ogg}} "I need an effective way of separating the soil into its discrete components."
{{Dialogue End}}

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Djarkutan:''' We can rule out temperature and moisture, so it must be a problem with the soil...
:{{DIcon}} And you are...?
::'''Djarkutan:''' I'm Djarkutan, a researcher from Amurta. I'm here to conduct research on tea trees.
::{{DIcon}} You certainly have a broad range of topics.
::'''Djarkutan:''' *sigh* It's not like I had any other choice! The more unusual a subject is, the easier it is to write a paper on it.
::'''Djarkutan:''' Tea tree transplantation, for example. Practically no one in the Akademiya is paying attention to it, so I have no rivals on the subject.
::'''Djarkutan:''' It's just that...
::{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
::'''Djarkutan:''' For some reason... The tea trees we bring over to Sumeru never survive.
::'''Djarkutan:''' After much thought, I feel that the reason must be the soil. Unfortunately, I never understood my geology and hydrology classes, and starting from scratch now is... difficult...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Djarkutan:''' Goodbye.
