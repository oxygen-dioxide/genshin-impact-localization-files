'''Exploding Barrels'''<ref>World Interactable: [[Time Trial Challenge]]</ref> or '''Explosive Barrels'''<ref>Event: [[Labyrinth Warriors]]</ref> can be encountered during [[Exploration]] and in some domains. There are currently five types of Exploding Barrels: {{Color|Pyro|Exploding Barrels (Pyro)}}, {{Color|Cryo|Frostburst Barrels (Cryo)}}, {{Color|Geo Exploding Barrels}}, {{Color|Electro Exploding Barrels}} and {{Color|Dendro Exploding Barrels}}.

The barrels in the wild have a slime (except Geo barrels) and a symbol of the corresponding element. The eyes of the slime can be seen through the barrel's hole on the side.

Attacking the barrel will detonate it, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Elemental DMG}} to players and enemies. {{Color|Cryo|Frostburst Barrels}} will also leave behind an icy mist after detonating that deals '''1.5% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}} every 0.5 seconds for 8 seconds.
