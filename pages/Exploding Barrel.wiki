'''Exploding Barrels'''<ref>World Interactable: [[Time Trial Challenge]]</ref> or '''Explosive Barrels'''<ref>Event: [[Labyrinth Warriors]]</ref> can be encountered during [[Exploration]] and in some domains. There are currently seven types of Exploding Barrels: {{Pyro}}, {{Cryo}} (also known as Frostburst Barrels), {{Geo}}, {{Electro}}, {{Dendro}}, {{Hydro}}, and [[Phlogiston Explosive Barrel|Phlogiston]].

The barrels in the wild have a slime (except Geo and Phlogiston barrels) and a symbol of the corresponding element. The eyes of the slime can be seen through the barrel's hole on the side.

Attacking the barrel will detonate it, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Elemental DMG}} to players and enemies. Frostburst Barrels will also leave behind an icy mist after detonating that deals '''1.5% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}} every 0.5 seconds for 8 seconds. Phlogiston Barrels will refill the character's [[Phlogiston]] meter.

*Damageless skill effects (e.g., [[Barbara]]'s [[Elemental Skill]]: [[Let the Show Begin♪]]'s Melody Loop and [[Xingqiu]]'s [[Elemental Skill]]: [[Guhua Sword: Fatal Rainscreen]]'s Rain Swords) can also detonate the barrel if they come into contact.
*Exploding Barrels may be spawned specially for some [[Ley Line Outcrops]], [[Time Trial Challenge]]s and some of [[Inazuma]]'s [[Bounties]].
