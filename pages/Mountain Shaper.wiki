==Profile==
===Introduction===
{{Quote|The Mountain Shaper's power stems from both inner enlightenment and external knowledge. As the dragon spits that which turns to amber, and as the swallow regurgitates that which becomes its nest, so the adeptus harnessed the power of nature to build an amber prison.|Stone tablet on Mt. Hulao}}

===Appearance===
Mountain Shaper appears as a red and orange colored crane, with a pattern of both on of his wings. In his human form, he takes the appearance of a bespectacled young man, with a red streak of hair among his dark brown hair.

==Story==
===History===
Mountain Shaper was among the adepti summoned by [[Morax]] to fight during the [[Archon War]]. At some point in time, alongside [[Moon Carver]] and an unknown adeptus, he participated in the subjugation of [[Azhdaha]].<ref>{{Ref/HEO|Hidden in Nameless Treasures}}</ref>

Several hundred years ago, during a battle between adepti and demons, an herb gatherer named [[Qiqi]] ended up getting caught in the crossfire. The adepti and demons stopped their fight after witnessing the ill-fated maiden receiving a [[Vision]] in her last breaths. The adepti couldn't bear to see her die; they gave some of their power to revive her. However, the little girl could not handle such tremendous energy, causing her to go on a rampage. To quell the madness, Mountain Shaper imprisoned her in amber.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Qiqi|4}}</ref>

===Present===
Mountain Shaper is first met when the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] go to the adepti to absolve themselves of the accusation that they assassinated Morax during the Rite of Descension. After hearing the news of the archon's death, Mountain Shaper decides to convene with his fellow adepti, though not before ensuring that the karst crawlers would not encase any innocent beings in his absence.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Moulder of Mountains}}</ref>

The adepti later confronted the [[Liyue Qixing]] directly, throwing [[Liyue Harbor]] into chaos.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Solitary Fragrance}}</ref> During this time, Childe attempted to extract the [[Gnosis]] from the Exuvia, only to discover that the Exuvia had been a fake body all along &mdash; the real Morax was still alive somewhere. To lure him out, Childe unleashed the Fatui-manufactured [[Sigil of Permission|Sigils of Permission]] to unseal the ancient god [[Osial]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Heart of Glaze}}</ref> In the face of this new threat, the adepti and Qixing worked together to reseal Osial.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Turning Point}}</ref>
