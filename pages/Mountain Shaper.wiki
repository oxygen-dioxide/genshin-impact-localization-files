'''Mountain Shaper''' {{Lang|zh=理水叠山真君|zh_rm=Lǐshuǐ Diéshān Zhēnjūn}} is an [[adeptus]] living in [[Mt. Hulao]], [[Liyue]].

Mountain Shaper is a story [[NPC]] first encountered during the [[Archon Quest]] "[[Moulder of Mountains]]."

==Profile==
===Introduction===
{{Quote|The Mountain Shaper's power stems from both inner enlightenment and external knowledge. As the dragon spits that which turns to amber, and as the swallow regurgitates that which becomes its nest, so the adeptus harnessed the power of nature to build an amber prison.|Stone tablet on Mt. Hulao}}

===Personality===
Like its fellow adepti, the Mountain Shaper dislikes human life, but nonetheless is bound by its duty to protect the people of Liyue. It speaks in a formal, yet old-fashioned manner.

It is very protective of Mt. Hulao, having planted numerous karst crawlers on the mountain to maintain its tranquility, considering most who enter to be "thieves". Although the flowers ensure that the mountain is well protected, it also imprisons curious beings, something which it tries to avoid whenever possible when it is not present on the mountain.

===Appearance===
Mountain Shaper appears as a red and orange colored crane, with a pattern of both on its wings.

==Story==
===History===
Mountain Shaper was among the adepti summoned by [[Morax]] to fight during the [[Archon War]]. At some point in time, alongside [[Moon Carver]] and an unknown adeptus, they participated in the subjugation of [[Azhdaha]].<ref>{{Ref/HEO|Hidden in Nameless Treasures}}</ref>

Several hundred years ago, during a battle between adepti and demons, a herb gatherer named [[Qiqi]] ended up getting caught in the crossfire. The adepti and demons stopped their fight after witnessing the ill-fated maiden receiving a [[Vision]] in her last breaths. The adepti couldn't bear to see her die; they gave some of their power to revive her. However, the little girl could not handle such tremendous energy, causing her to go on a rampage. To quell the madness, Mountain Shaper imprisoned her in amber.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Qiqi|4}}</ref>

===Present===
Mountain Shaper is first met when the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] go to the adepti to absolve themselves of the accusation that they assassinated Morax during the Rite of Descension. After hearing the news of the archon's death, Mountain Shaper decides to convene with their fellow adepti, though not before ensuring that the karst crawlers would not encase any innocent beings in his absence.

The adepti later confront the [[Liyue Qixing]] directly, throwing [[Liyue Harbor]] into chaos. During this time, Childe attempted to extract the [[Gnosis]] from the Exuvia, only to discover that the Exuvia had been a fake body all along &mdash; the real Morax was still alive somewhere. To lure him out, Childe unleashed the Fatui-manufactured [[Sigil of Permission|Sigils of Permission]] to unseal the ancient god [[Osial]]. In the face of this new threat, the adepti and Qixing worked together to reseal Osial.

During the Lantern Rite after Osial's defeat, Mountain Shaper presumably went on a journey with Moon Carver without Cloud Retainer's knowledge. The two eventually returned just as the fireworks show was about to start.
