{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the Astral Assemblage)
:{{Black Screen|Chosen of Dragons... This place was once sealed.}}<!-- golden text -->
:{{Black Screen|Break the seal outside the Astral Assemblage to unleash the power contained in this place.}}
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, that thing's locked way up high... Paimon doesn't know if we have enough strength...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Raaawr! Roawr!
:'''Paimon:''' You think we should charge up there? But there isn't even a path!

;(Approach the first stair-like platform)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmmm... How about we try pushing this stone platform to make a path?

;(Pull the blue lever)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Something's not right! The floor's moving backward... We have to hurry up!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrah... Rawr!

;(Pull the blue lever on the other side)
:'''Paimon:''' Phew. It's over at last...
:'''Paimon:''' Honestly, even just watching that was exhausting...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rroo...

;(Break the seal on the Astral Assemblage)
:{{Black Screen|External interference removed. Re-establishing corrupted signal flow.}}
:{{Black Screen|Astral Assemblage resuming normal operations.}}

;(Activate the Astral Assemblage)
:;(The Astral Assemblage shoots a beam of light towards the Celestial Axis, activating one of the pillars)
:{{Black Screen|The scene materializes before you like some nostalgic memory.}}
:{{Black Screen|Operations stream along countless convolutions, flowing spectrum paths that shift across layered platforms.<br>The accumulated Phlogiston coalesces under immense pressure into a floating, controllable ball of heat.<br>"We've done it!" Your brethren cheer all around you.<br>Yet the one who masterminded this feat, in no way inferior to star-forging, stands outside the experimental site, as though wholly unrelated to this momentous deed.}}
:'''Cold Voice:''' Congratulations are in order. Creating something equivalent to a celestial body in miniature... An "Astral Assemblage," is it? Truly, a grand achievement, comparable with lunar reconstruction.
:'''Cold Voice:''' "That one" would surely have tucked their wings in and nodded congratulations to you &mdash; were they still with us.
:{{Black Screen|"...If you had been willing to help, it might have been completed long ago."}}
:'''Cold Voice:''' I have no interest in it.
:{{Black Screen|"...But you should help me, [[Kukulkan]]. We have driven the All-Plunderer's herald into the deepest of mountain valleys, yet once its master awakens..."}}
:{{Black Screen|"It will surely bring another catastrophe upon our people."}}
:'''Cold Voice:''' Ah, how very noble of you, creating this thing to protect your pitiable brethren...
:{{Black Screen|"'Our' pitiable brethren."}}
:{{Black Screen|"This is only the beginning, and my days are numbered. I must forge a new path for the Dragonborn before the pitch-black shadow smothers us all."}}
:'''Cold Voice:''' Or, perhaps, you should let them find their own way... Forgive my forthrightness, but the path you plan to create may be too narrow for our kind.
:{{Black Screen|"The narrow way must be walked. When your time runs short... When waiting becomes a luxury."}}
:{{Black Screen|"Enough waiting, I say. A time will come, Kukulkan, when your days go down like the sun behind the hills, and you will understand. Then, you shall make the same decision as I have..."}}
;({{Cx}})
::'''Cold Voice:''' ...My king, my elder brother, O lord who gave me life on the day you yourself were born... You once said that in my final moments, I would understand your desire.
;({{Cx}})
::'''Cold Voice:''' ...My king, my elder brother, O lord who gave me life on the day you yourself were born... On this alone I cannot concede to you.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. That... Did we just see something that happened when this fireball was made?
:{{DIcon}} You saw that too, Paimon?
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, Paimon saw it super clearly this time as well... The ones surrounding this cake platform had to be the dragons who used to live here...
:'''Paimon:''' But who were the two people who were speaking, then? Weird...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Graawrr...
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, the seal on the Astral Assemblage here should be broken now, right?
