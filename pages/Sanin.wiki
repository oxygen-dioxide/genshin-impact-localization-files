:'''[[Sanin]]:''' ...No, no, that's not how this one goes...
:'''Sanin:''' You usually tell the customer that a service is paid first, right? Telling me that only after you've taken the photos is just unreasonable!
:'''[[Talvat]]:''' But taking photos comes at a cost too. The machines and the photos all cost Mora &mdash; that's just the way things are!
:'''Sanin:''' That's not how that works. If you're rendering a service, you need to tell the customer if there's anything to note about it first!
:'''Sanin:''' Take us at the Northland Bank, for example. When a client comes to us to have a service done, we will tell them &mdash; repeatedly at that! &mdash; that your way of doing business doesn't work.
:'''Talvat:''' Well, this isn't the Northland Bank, and I mean, everyone else paid me!
:'''Sanin:''' That they are willing to put up with something unreasonable is their problem! Don't you have a court? We'll take this up there!
:'''Talvat:''' *sigh* You know what? Forget it. I won't take your Mora. But please, return me those pictures.
:'''Sanin:''' No, no, no, this is not a question of Mora...
