'''The Otogi Kongou Lion King''' (also referred to as the '''Otogi King''') was a wandering eccentric of Inazuma who lived around five hundred years ago.<ref name=":0" />

==Profile==
===Personality ===
The Otogi King was raucous, boisterous, and liked to tell tales about his alleged fights with monsters ([[Kitsune|bake-kitsune]], [[bake-danuki]], evil demons, and [[Reizenbou]] being a few cited examples). He is apparently good with children; he kicked down [[Lavender Melon]] trees when he saw they were unable to reach the fruit, and took some of them to crash an official autumn leaf-watching concert.<ref name=":0" />

==Story==
At some point in time before [[Mikoshi Chiyo]] was swallowed by a beast, the Otogi King challenged her to a wrestling match. She easily defeated him, hurling him into the sky. Afterwards, he promised he would "cut off the horns of those monsters and bring them back for [her]", claiming that it would "show [her] the might of the Otogi Kongou Lion King" and that the "creatures from beyond the ocean" were "easy pickings".<ref name=":0" />

At another unknown point in time, he helped [[Ioroi]] deal with the [[Four Oni of Ogata]]. Together, the Otogi King and Ioroi "threw them into paper and sealed them".<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas: The Wonders of Adeptal Amber}}</ref>
==Trivia==
* Despite his claims of being able to vanquish powerful monsters, he was "never given the right to wear [[Ei|the Shogun]]'s colors".<ref name=":0" />
* He is the wielder of the weapon [[Redhorn Stonethresher]].<ref name=":0" />
