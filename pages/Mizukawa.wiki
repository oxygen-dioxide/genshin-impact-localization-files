'''Mizukawa''' is an event-exclusive NPC that appears in the [[Enchanted Tales of the Mikawa Festival]] event. He, [[Kaga]], and [[Kiritani]] were recently sent by the [[Shogunate]] to survey [[Chinju Forest]] for potential land development. They were interrupted by a Nightmare Fragment, which rendered them unconscious.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As Though Beholding Illusions}}</ref>
