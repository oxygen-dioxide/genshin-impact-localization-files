==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|The third component of the Central Hub fell in the forest to the north. Idyia mentioned that the cousin Eula was searching for has gone to this area as well. Perhaps you'll be able to find something that hints at his whereabouts...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Collei, Eula, and Idyia)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Collei and Eula. Oh, Idyia is here, too!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Hey, it's {{Traveler}} and Paimon.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' How are you? Did you rest well?
:{{DIcon}} I'm feeling refreshed!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 idyia 01.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Yep, this is a comfortable place to rest, I guess that's one thing here that's better than the desert... But other than that, there's not much going for this place.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Saying things like that isn't going to help, Idyia!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 idyia 02.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' But it's the truth. The desert is full of terrible memories for me, being there was like... yeah, like wading through thick mud.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's a weird way to put it... Actually, if you hadn't mentioned it, Paimon would have already forgotten that this domain is in the desert.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I know what you mean, the air here isn't at all like the desert. It's very humid, almost as if we're in the rainforest. It's a very familiar feeling for me.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Everyone looks well-rested. If you're ready, we can start making our way to the jungle north of here.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 idyia 03.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Good luck, everyone! I'll be rooting for you!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Hold on, I said "we," didn't I? No need to say goodbye, because you're coming too.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 idyia 04.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Huh? But wait, I'm just the Mascot!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' You can't back out this time, Idyia! The manager of the fairgrounds is waiting to see you. She said, "Idyia is the only person who could help."
:{{DIcon}} "The Fairgrounds"?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Yes, Collei and I discovered a fairgrounds in the forest.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 collei 06.ogg}} '''Collei:''' The person in charge of it seems to be a [[Spantamad]] scholar.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A scholar? But what's she doing there, researching the forest's [[Ley Line]]s?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 idyia 05.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' *sigh* I wish there were Ley Lines here that I could have her study... Anyway, I know who you're talking about. I'd better come along then.
----
;(Approach the blue-haired Spantamad scholar)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 maymom 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Ah, finally! Someone has arrived...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 collei 07.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Sorry to keep you waiting, Maymunah. We've brought Idyia with us.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 maymom 02.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Thank you, Collei. It's been quite some time since I've seen you, Idyia. To be honest, I didn't think you'd actually show up...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 maymom 03.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' If anything, I thought you'd be curled up somewhere crying alone.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Hey, you shouldn't be saying things like that.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, doesn't seem to be the first time Paimon's heard someone say that about Idyia though...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 idyia 06.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' You want to see me cry? Fine! I'll start crying right here!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 collei 08.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Ah! No, please don't!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 maymom 04.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Alright, alright, I shouldn't have said that. Now, who are these two?
:{{DIcon}} Hi, I'm {{Traveler}}.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And Paimon is Paimon.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 idyia 07a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo yqeq204 1 idyia 07b.ogg}}--> '''Idyia:''' They're reliable helpers, lucky for you that I found them. You'd better be more careful about how you speak to them, okay!?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 1 maymom 05.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Of course. Good to meet you, you may call me Maymunah. For the sake of time, we should forego the usual pleasantries. Please, follow me.
----
;(Approach the tent)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Wow...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look at that huge tent...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 idyia 01.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Amazing, isn't it? I helped make it. What fun would a fairground be without a tent, right?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Paimon knew you couldn't be so pathetic! You just act modest all the time to hide your actual abilities!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...Huh?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' What is it, Collei?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Uh, sorry... I'm not sure if I should tell you...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I'm afraid it might dampen the mood...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' That's not important, please just speak your mind.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Uh, well... There are lots of vendor booths set up here, but there's no one running them. In fact, there's no one at this fair at all. It looks pretty deserted...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 01.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' *sigh* The truth is, this used to be an exciting and bustling place.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 02.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' But just a few days ago, something happened and it seemed like...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Like "the world was suddenly flipped upside down"?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 03.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Yes, exactly! Something fell from the Central Hub into the tent, and knocked down the Crystal Light that was hanging at the top.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 idyia 02.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Ah, the Crystal Light...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 04.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Mm-hmm. I remember a certain someone said that we should have beautiful lights to celebrate at a fair, and made us that Crystal Light.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 05.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' But once the light fell, the tent became a complete mess and the Hydro Eidolons were trapped inside.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 06.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Just when I was at my wits' end, a man from the [[Lawrence Clan]] came and offered his assistance.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Wait, he offered to help you?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 07.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Yes, and he refused to listen to any of my warnings. He just walked straight into the tent, and then...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Yes? And then?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, don't leave us hanging here! What happened?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 08.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' And that's it... He became trapped inside along with the Hydro Eidolons.
:{{DIcon}} Yet another victim...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 collei 06.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh no, we have to do something. We can't just leave him there, Maymunah!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 09.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' I know, but the situation inside might be more difficult than you think. You should mentally prepare yourselves.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 eula 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Just talking about it is a waste of time. Since we're already here, let's go and scout out the situation ourselves.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 10.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' *sigh* Alright. This way, please.

;(Enter the big tent)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 11.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' There used to be a large stage inside, but after everything got shaken up, it seems the very nature of the entire place was altered.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 12.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' The lamps and Crystal Light that were hanging above have all fallen down, which makes repairs near impossible.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 collei 07.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Wait, so you mean it's difficult to move around in there?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 13.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Yes, mainly because of the lights.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 14.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Do any of you have experience being on stage? Once the stage lights turn on, everyone's attention is focused on you.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 collei 08.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Uh...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 collei 09.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I can't stand that feeling. Having everyone's attention focused solely on me would just make me feel terrible.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 idyia 03.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Me too! I'm no good at speaking in front of people, and then to have everyone staring at you... Ugh, just the thought of it makes me shudder.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 eula 07.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Sounds like you have some things you haven't been able to let go of yet.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 collei 10.ogg}} '''Collei:''' *sigh* Please don't laugh. I'm trying my best to change that, but there are still some things I can't overcome. Like when there's a lot of people around, or when people are staring at me...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 eula 08.ogg}} '''Eula:''' No, there's nothing funny about that... and you know what? It's not a bad thing to care when other people are looking.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 eula 09.ogg}} '''Eula:''' That's my opinion, anyway. Think about it, only people who have high standards for themselves would worry about failing to meet others' expectations.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 eula 10.ogg}} '''Eula:''' You have many good qualities, Collei. I bet if you had to learn dance since childhood like myself, then you'd be an even better dancer than me.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 collei 11.ogg}} '''Collei:''' No, no way! That would be impossible!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 idyia 04.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' (I can relate. I know exactly how she feels.)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 eula 11.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Maybe we should find a time for you to learn with me, and one day you will become an outstanding dancer, too. By that time, you'll be so focused on performing your beautiful moves that you'll no longer worry about an audience watching you.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, Eula's so passionate about this that she's practically glowing now.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 collei 12.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Really, you'd do that? You wouldn't think I look stupid and secretly laugh at me, would you?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 eula 12.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Hmph, you really think I'm that kind of person? Fine, vengeance will be mine.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 collei 13.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh, no! Of course not! Alright, please teach me.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 15.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Seems there's no need for me to warn you again. Anyway, you just need to open the curtain and you'll be able to see the stage.
----
;(Enter the room beyond the curtain)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, what's that thing in the middle there?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 idyia 05.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' That's my Crystal Light. It's been locked up.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 17.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Well, let's figure out a way to fix this. Looks like we need to raise the platform underneath the Crystal Light.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 idyia 06.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' If I remember correctly, the stage controls should be somewhere around here...

;(After raising the Crystal Light)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 18.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' It seems we have to use the colorful lens to make the light change colors.

;(If the Brilliant Mirror is subsumed)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The colored pieces of the bolt have melted!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 22.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Yes, the lens is made of materials that are easily melted by light.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 collei 14.ogg}} '''Collei:''' *sniff* Is it me, or do I smell something sweet here?

;(Activate the Lamp Gem)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 19.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' That's one way of shining new light on the problem...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey Maymunah, do you happen to know someone named Cyno?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 20.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' No, never heard that name before. Why do you ask?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, never mind then. Paimon was just thinking you two would have a lot in common.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 21.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Ahem, back to the situation at hand. We should probably head into the passageway that opened now.

;(Approach the passageway)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 lessig 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Hello? Is anyone here? If you can hear me, please help!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Lessig Lawrence?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 lessig 02.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' Wh&mdash;Who are you? Who has the audacity to utter my full name?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, you sure don't look like you're in any condition to be talking like that.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Yep, he's a member of the Lawrence Clan all right. Even though he's hanging on by thread, he still insists on clinging to meaningless etiquette.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 lessig 03.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' You... What are you doing here?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 lessig 04.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' Hah! Have you come here to mock me, Eula?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' If you would just think for a moment, it should be pretty obvious why we are here. Yet now you're intentionally trying to provoke me?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Of course, you don't have to accept my help. After all, "Aristocrats are naturally superior and need no help from others."
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 lessig 05.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' ...Yes, thanks for the reminder, I don't need help from the likes of you!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I don't think he really means it, Eula.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' His tone was harsh, but he keeps glancing at you from the corner of his eyes. It's my opinion as the Healer that he needs help.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Okay.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 eula 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Hmph. He's been trapped for so long that it seems he's forgotten how to hold a decent conversation. How ridiculous. Let's go. We'll leave the stage to this person who'd rather save face than save his own life.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 lessig 06.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' Hey, n&mdash;no... Wait!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 lessig 07.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' Halt! You cannot just leave me here! W&mdash;We're both of the Lawrence bloodline, after all!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 lessig 08.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' Helping me when necessary certainly won't tarnish your prestige! If anything, my embarrassing predicament will be overshadowed by your virtuous deed. W&mdash;We must uphold the prestige and dignity of the family!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 eula 07.ogg}} '''Eula:''' This is the best reason you could come up with? You think tacking on the word "family" will be enough to talk me into helping you?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 eula 08.ogg}} '''Eula:''' You should be ashamed for your careless actions. It's because of you that we all had to come here.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 lessig 09.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' ...I, uh...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seems everyone in the Lawrence Clan is this way. They'll do anything to save face...
:{{DIcon}} Even though Eula sounds harsh...
:{{DIcon}} We did come all the way here to save him...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 idyia 01.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Alright, alright, looks like it's time for the Mascot to step in.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 idyia 02.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Here you go. One for Eula and one for Lessig.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 lessig 10.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' What is this? Candy?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 eula 09.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Uh, thanks.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh! This smell! It's just like the aroma I smelled coming from the lens.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 idyia 03.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Yes, that's right. Enjoying something sweet always lightens the mood.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 lessig 11.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' Thank you, Miss Mascot. I certainly do feel much better now.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 eula 10.ogg}} '''Eula:''' (Hmph, so he's willing to thank someone else, but not me?)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 idyia 04.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Eula has been worrying about you the past few days, and asked me several times regarding how to find you.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 idyia 05.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' But now that you two have been reunited, I won't have to keep answering her questions anymore. Ah, I'm so happy!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 eula 11.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Let me clarify one thing, I don't care what happens to him! If you're going to keep saying nonsense like this, then...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Eula will never admit that she actually cares about him.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, you're probably right.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 eula 12.ogg}} '''Eula:''' If you're going to keep saying nonsense like this, then... then at least give me another piece of candy.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 idyia 06.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Hmm? Oh, sure, sure! I still have more!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 lessig 12.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' ...Sorry, I admit my mistake. I know I've caused heaps of trouble for all of you.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 eula 13.ogg}} '''Eula:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 eula 14.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Hmph, why couldn't you have just said that earlier?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 maymom 01.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' I'm back... Oh? Have you already finished catching up? Why are you all looking at me?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, uh... nothing. Don't mind us.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 maymom 02.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Alright, then let's clean things up here and keep working our way toward getting the Crystal Light fixed! Ah, there's no need to push yourself in your condition, Lessig.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 idyia 07.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' I'll take him and find someplace for him to rest. I happen to be a little tired myself.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 eula 15.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Alright. I'll leave my cousin to you, then.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 3 eula 16.ogg}} '''Eula:''' You'd better rest up and regain your strength before we settle things, Lessig.

;(Approach the Gleaming Lamp on the second level)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 4 maymom 01.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Now let's see if there's any way to keep raising the platform higher.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 4 maymom 02.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' We probably will need to find a mechanism that's like a lamp.

;(Approach the Crystal Light on the second level)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 4 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Strange, is that really the Lessig that I know?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 4 maymom 03.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' You shouldn't always judge people based the way you knew them before. People change, and people can always make different choices.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 4 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' ...

;(Open the curtain on the west)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, look! There's a Water Droplet over there.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 maymom 18.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Ah, a Hydro Eidolon. It must have been trapped in the curtain, but at least it seems to be okay.

;(Approach the staircase to the third level)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, and Paimon thought it looked big from the outside. This place is massive!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 2 maymom 16.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' It is a magical tent, after all. The inside is much larger than it appears from the outside. Haven't you heard stories with this sort of thing before?

;(Approach the Gleaming Lamp on the third level)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, another path has appeared! This should be the last level.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 maymom 01.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Yes, don't worry. We're almost to the top of the tent.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 maymom 02.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' The last thing we need to do is raise the Crystal Light to the very top of the tent.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 maymom 03.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' After the stage collapsed, I realized that having it raised only half-way makes it look a lot like the stage at the [[Grand Bazaar]]. Have any of you visited the Grand Bazaar before?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' No, I haven't.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I have. I've gone there a few times with Master [[Tighnari]].
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' The place is bustling with all kinds of vendors! And if you're lucky, you can see [[Nilou]] perform her dance.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Oh, a dance from Sumeru? I'd like to see that myself. Hmm, if only it were on the way back, then we could stop there.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' It doesn't matter if it's on the way or not. I would be happy to take you whenever you have time, Eula!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Great, I'll take you up on that offer.
:{{DIcon}} We've been to the Grand Bazaar.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, now that Paimon thinks about it, we've already been there more times than Paimon can remember!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 maymom 04.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Really? My father used to help with festivities at the Grand Bazaar and would always give me candy during the events.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 maymom 05.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' I was just a kid and didn't understand anything... I was happy as long as he gave me some candy. To me, fairs and festivals were the best things ever.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 maymom 06.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' I always thought my father was amazing, and wanted to be just like him when I grew up.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' But aren't you a scholar in the Akademiya, Maymunah? As far as I know, scholars seldom can spend time doing anything but research.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I doubt you could have time to assist your father in preparing festivities.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 maymom 07.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Yeah, seems you read me like a book.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 maymom 08.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' When I had the choice between becoming who I wanted to be and who my parents wanted me to be, I ended up choosing the latter... But I was never happy about it.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, that's almost the exact opposite of Eula's situation.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' You must have already realized that. Why else would you set up all the booths here and make this place like a fairgrounds?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 maymom 09.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Yes, but... I'm still not as happy as I imagined I would be.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 maymom 10.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' I realized that attending a fair and running a fair are two completely different things.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 maymom 11.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' The main reason my childhood was so fun and carefree is because my family worked hard.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 maymom 12.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' But my father knew how difficult and tiring running a fair could be, so he wanted to push me towards academics.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 maymom 13.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' *sigh* But in the end, I didn't do well in either.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 maymom 14.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' I gave up on myself and resorted to investigating Ley Lines in the desert. Some things happened and then I accidentally ended up here.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 maymom 15.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' I finally had a chance to make my wish of running a fair come true, but after seeing everything come crashing down, I feel like I've lost the strength to go on.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 collei 06.ogg}} '''Collei:''' It's not as bad as you make it out to be, Maymunah. No need to feel so down.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 collei 07.ogg}} '''Collei:''' You have the courage to change, and you've been actively guiding us on this journey.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 collei 08.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Someone who's given up on themself could never do these things.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Collei...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 maymom 16.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' I understand my situation better than anyone, you don't need to try to comfort me.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 collei 09.ogg}} '''Collei:''' It's not that I'm trying to comfort you, it's just that people sometimes don't realize that their own actions speak louder than words.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 collei 10.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Believe me, this is something that I learned from my time together with Eula.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Oh? What are you trying to say?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 collei 11.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh, uh nothing! Ahem, now let's get that Crystal Light fixed.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 maymom 17.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' ...Alright.

;(Release the Crystal Light without activating the Lamp Gem)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 maymom 19.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' If we're going to raise the Crystal Light, then we need to open the top of the tent.
;(Release the Crystal Light and activating the Lamp Gem at the same time)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 5 maymom 20.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Good, that should do it.

----
;(Activate the Lamp Gem at the top of the tent)
:;(The Crystal Light rises to the top of the tent and the fairgrounds come to life)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey Idyia, we're back!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 idyia 01.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Oh! I was starting to wonder what was taking you so long! But don't worry, Lessig is recovering well.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 idyia 02.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Hehe, I'm pretty good at taking care of people. Seems I've found another good thing about myself...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I don't know if I should be worried for him or happy for her...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 lessig 01.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' The shadow... it's massive!!! Ah, wait! The shadow just now, it's... Ah!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 idyia 03.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Uh, ahem... Seems he still might need a little more time to recover. Tell me, did everything go well for you all?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 maymom 01.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Of course. With a team like {{Traveler}}, Paimon, Collei and Eula, they're at least 40 times more reliable than you ever were.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 idyia 04.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Only 40 times more reliable? That means I'm still pretty good, then.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 maymom 02.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Ugh... I guess it's impossible to feel like you've lost once you've already given up... I'm a little concerned about how comfortable you are with that...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 lessig 02.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' Huh!? What has happened? How did I get outside of the tent!?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 lessig 03.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' Ah, that's right... I remember meeting Eula, and then... and then, ugh... my head...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 idyia 05.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Ah, you're awake now. Don't worry, that's just a side effect of your treatment, Lessig.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 lessig 04.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' I'm afraid I still feel a little disoriented...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (I'm scared to ask what kind of treatment he's receiving...)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Lessig Lawrence.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 lessig 05.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' Oh, it's you, Eula! Alright, alright, I'll do it... I'll come back to Mondstadt with you and abandon my wild efforts to restore the Lawrence Clan.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Interesting, now you want to talk. Seems you've had a change of heart.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' In that case, maybe you'll be able to explain everything in detail for us now?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 lessig 06.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' I, uh... I admit it. Yes, I came here in hopes of finding a way to restore the Lawrence Clan to its former glory.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 lessig 07.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' But it was a long journey, and I didn't always know the way. I passed through Liyue and Sumeru... and there was even a time when I lost my wallet and had to live in the wild.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 lessig 08.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' But the peculiar thing is... I realized that nobody knew me out there, and not a single person even cared about the Lawrence Clan.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 lessig 09.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' You and I are like glass pawns that were raised in shackles. We were taught to act like nobles, but outside the walls of our home, the people of Mondstadt despised us.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 lessig 10.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' Such pompous, hateful, and stubborn teaching... It all culminated to making us cling to the old aristocratic dogma in an attempt to maintain our pride.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 lessig 11.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' It's like a never-ending game of tug-of-war. But it is meaningless... You understand. Or I should say, you have already long understood, but I'm afraid that I have only just realized this.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, Paimon sorta understands what Lessig is saying.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Everything he said is true. Your family is probably unaware that you've already changed how you see things.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 lessig 12.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' Yes, this has all happened recently. After coming to this domain, I realized the Mondstadt that I want is one where not everyone fears me.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 lessig 13.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' All that I and many other members of the Lawrence Clan long for is a place where we can live peacefully with others.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Lessig, both you and I never had anything to do with the glory of the Lawrence Clan. That is all in the past, we are just ordinary people.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 lessig 14.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 lessig 15.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' I originally planned on returning to Mondstadt after taking care of things here. I never thought you would come here. I was completely shocked, which is why I reacted like I did. I'm sorry.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 maymom 03.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' See, people can always make different choices, and it seems that Lessig has also chosen to become someone he truly wants to be.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 lessig 16.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' Ah yes, about that... I'm afraid I haven't quite found my own purpose in life yet...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 maymom 04.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' That's alright. Being able to clearly choose between becoming who you want to be and who your parents wanted you to be is already a step in the right direction.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 maymom 05.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' How to find true happiness is probably one of the most difficult research topics of all.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 eula 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I have a suggestion for you, Lessig.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 eula 07.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Why don't you return to Mondstadt and tell your parents what you just told us?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 lessig 17.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' Hah, they'll probably try to tear me limb from limb. But what about you? Did you ever tell your family about what you think?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 eula 08.ogg}} '''Eula:''' This is something that I've been thinking about, too. Perhaps the two of us can sit down with the rest of the clan and discuss it with them.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 eula 09.ogg}} '''Eula:''' The Lawrence Clan is just like this stage. It was once home to glorious performances, but those days are now long gone, and it is time for the stage to be updated.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' (She's so solid and tough, but also clear and open... like an ice cube. Is that why she's able to dance anytime and anywhere she wishes?)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 idyia 06.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Uh, are you all done talking now?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 maymom 06.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Yes, I think so. By the way, that is for you, please take it. I found it on Lessig earlier.
:[[File:Fairground Gathering, Summer Lights Illuminated Candy Box.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 idyia 07.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Oh! It's one of the missing components! Wait, so you had it all this time? Why didn't you give it to me earlier?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 maymom 07.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Well, you didn't ask! Alright, I admit it... I forgot about it.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 idyia 08.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Hehe... Okay, we'll let {{Traveler}} hold on to it for now.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Hmm? Wait, this looks like...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It looks pretty familiar... Have we seen one of these before?
:{{DIcon}} Many times... Some might say too many...
::{{A|vo yqeq204 6 paimon 04a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Shh! Now's not the time to brag about being a hero!
:{{DIcon}} It's a candy box!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Ah right, I also bought a similar box at the last festival.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 maymom 08.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Yes, people often use this kind of box for candy at festivals. This was one of the "materials" originally used to create the tent.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 maymom 09.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' But now that the tent has been repaired, we no longer need it.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 maymom 10.ogg}} '''Maymunah:''' Eating the candy from the box as an adult will never be as delicious as it was when you were a kid. But if you really think about it, there are way more things you can eat as an adult.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! So when it comes down to it, eating candy is sorta like life, it's just another choice!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 lessig 18.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 idyia 09.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' So as of now, we've already collected three of the missing components. Only one more to go!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 6 idyia 10.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' I'm sorry that repairing the tent took so much of everyone's time. You should all head back and have a rest, I'll lead the way...

;(Approach Kokomi)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Kokomi! You're already here.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Oh, you're back. I trust your adventures to the forest went smoothly?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, you could say that! How about you? Up to anything today?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Well, I suppose it's time I told you that as the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island, I shouldn't actually be here now.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' The truth is that a relic, known as the Shinrou Casket, was lost from Watatsumi Island long ago.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 kokomi 04.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' But recently, an orb matching the relic's description suddenly began emitting light, almost as if it was guiding people to it. This is what led me to find the relic's whereabouts.
:{{DIcon}} So you came here looking for something...
:{{DIcon}} That's what you meant by "broadening your horizons"...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 kokomi 05.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I wasn't lying when I said that. Gorou has often told me that sitting at home reading light novels is not the best of practices, and that I should try to get out more.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 kokomi 06.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' As I made my way from Watatsumi Island to Sumeru, I enjoyed a variety of breathtaking sights. It really is a beautiful nation. I even stayed in the rainforest for several days.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 kokomi 07.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I was surprised to find that the relic had ended up in the desert. I knew it was somewhere here, but I still couldn't pinpoint the exact location.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 kokomi 08.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Though I feel that Idyia was not intentionally trying to hide anything from us, this domain does have plenty of secrets. I'm sure you've sensed that, too.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (This is an unusual place, and Idyia would suddenly become very busy from time to time. Plus, she knows Alice...)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Now that you mention it, a lot did happen today.
:{{Black Screen|You tell Kokomi everything that happened at the fairgrounds...}}
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 kokomi 09.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I see. When you found Lessig, did you also happen to find any clues related to this domain?
:{{DIcon}} No, I don't think so.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 kokomi 10.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I'm afraid that he was caught up in his thoughts and didn't pay attention to his surroundings. Actually, before the "world was flipped upside down," this domain didn't look anything like this.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Hey everyone! Oh, I hope we're not interrupting your conversation...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 kokomi 11.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' It's alright, you two did a lot today. Care to join me for a cup of tea?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Sure, that would be perfect! Eula and I just made some snacks...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Turns out that Idyia has a cooking stove and oven. Seriously, why didn't she mention it earlier...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! So did you make us some [[Moon Pie]]s?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' No, I made something called [[Stormcrest Pie]]. You should try one, {{Traveler}}.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' And I made some [[Pita Pocket]]s! You can try some, Kokomi. It should taste great with tea.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Ah, sorry... I should call you General.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 kokomi 12.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Oh, I would be happy to try some.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' By the way Eula, how's your cousin doing now?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 7 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Oh, him... You would never guess, but he's busy over by the oven now.

==Post-Quest Dialogue==
After the quest, Sangonomiya Kokomi, Collei, Eula, Lessig, Klee, Kaeya, and Idyia are all available until the next quest begins.

===Sangonomiya Kokomi and Collei===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Sangonomiya Kokomi and Collei, optional)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 8 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' This is the first time I've had tea that tastes like this. It seems Inazuman tea is a lot different from what we have in Sumeru.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 8 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Ah yes, it seems people in Sumeru like to put spices in their tea, right?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 8 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Yes, that's right! But I still can't get used to it... If I had to pick, I'd drink coffee, even though it gives me insomnia sometimes.

===Eula and Lessig===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Eula and Lessig, optional)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 8 lessig 01.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' As a descendant of the illustrious Lawrence Clan, I learned many skills during my journey, for example... baking flatbread!
:{{A|vo yqeq204 8 lessig 02.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' Good, this should be just the right amount of heat.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 8 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I had no idea you knew how to bake... I thought you'd be the type who'd never get anywhere near the kitchen.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 8 lessig 03.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' Ah, I've been meaning to ask you... Do you have time later? Could you teach me how to make those delectable snacks of yours?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 8 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Oh? But that might take some time. Besides, we're not here to get to know each other as family.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 8 lessig 04.ogg}} '''Lessig:''' So again you're worried about our ties within the Lawrence family, fine... But you said yourself that we're just ordinary people, so why don't we learn from each other like regular cousins would?

===Klee and Kaeya===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Klee and Kaeya, optional)
:{{A|vo yqeq204 8 klee 01.ogg}} '''Klee:''' I wanna ride the Choo-Choo Cart with Miss General! Up, up, up, and... WEEEE!!! But uh, I guess the ride makes her a little dizzy...
:{{A|vo yqeq204 8 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Ah, so you noticed? Very good. Was it the stars spinning in her dazed eyes that gave it away?
:{{A|vo yqeq204 8 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Mm-hmm, yesterday she said she had lots of little golden stars floating around her. But she seems to be doing a lot better today.
:{{A|vo yqeq204 8 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' If Mom were here, she'd probably say the stars are all fish that fell into the clouds!
