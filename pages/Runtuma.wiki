:'''Runtuma:''' Greetings, travelers from afar! Have you ever heard of the Magma Egg, one of the specialties we have here at the Collective of Plenty?
:'''Runtuma:''' If you wanna try one, just take on the "Magma Egg Challenge"! Get to that [[Tutorial/Geothermal Vent|geothermal vent]] over there, break it open, grab the egg inside, and bam, you've got yourself a fresh, hot delicacy!
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Sure, I'll give it a go!
:{{DIcon}} What are these... eggs?
::'''Runtuma:''' So, about them &mdash; they're a dish that can only be produced in our volcanic region.
::'''Runtuma:''' We toss some [[Bird Egg|bird egg]]s on the vents, let the [[Phlogiston]] roast them, and when the heat and timing are just right, out comes the perfect Magma Egg.
::'''Runtuma:''' But word to the wise &mdash; leave it in too long, and it'll take on a, ah, special taste.
::'''Runtuma:''' If you wanna try one, just take on the "Magma Egg Challenge"! Get to that geothermal vent over there, break it open, grab the egg inside, and bam, you've got yourself a fresh, hot delicacy!

<!-- All 3 dialogue opens available regardless of what the player has done -->
:{{DIcon}} I did! It was a super energizing dish!
::'''Runtuma:''' Right? That's the power of volcanic goodness packed into every bite!
::'''Runtuma:''' They say you'll get stronger and stronger if you eat 'em every day!
:{{DIcon}} I overcooked mine... almost passed out after eating it.
::'''Runtuma:''' Haha, that taste really sticks with you, huh?
::'''Runtuma:''' Honestly, it's not that bad once you get used to it.
:{{DIcon}} Not yet. Maybe next time.
