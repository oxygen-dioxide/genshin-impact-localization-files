==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Sethos wears a white top with golden seams as well as black pants, down to roughly his calves, with details in dark blue, purple, and golden shapes. He has boots which have black towards the front and cream color towards the back. His boots adorn golden soles, tips, and hourglass-shaped additions.

There are several accessories Sethos wears in addition to his base of clothing. Upon his waist is a deep purple cloth where his {{Electro}} [[Vision]] rests, while over his shoulders, he wears a scarf-like cloth wrapped around his shoulders. Over his shoulders, the cloth is a sandy gold sporting purple and lighter gold shapes, with an hourglass design hanging off the tip. Another hourglass shape is in the front, keeping the cloth wrapped around him. His hands and forearms are covered in dark purple fingerless gloves with golden rims. A golden armband is seen on his left bicep while his right ear wears green earrings. Many of the hourglass-like details upon him closely resemble a certain Ba Fragment.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Sethos: Ba Fragment}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Footprints Sunken Beneath the Sands}}</ref>
