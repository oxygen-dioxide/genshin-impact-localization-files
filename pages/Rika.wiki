==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After completing [[The Strange Tale of Suikou's Tipsy Tincture]])
:'''Rika:''' Welcome back, Almighty Shogun!
:{{DIcon}} Al... mighty Shogun?
::'''Rika:''' Ah. Don't worry about it too much. This is just something they say in the novel.
::'''Rika:''' I mean, "[[Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?]]" is the tale of a loser Shogun and the Kitsune Guuji who can do it all.
::'''Rika:''' You know, I did ask Lady Yae if publishing such a novel was alright.
::'''Rika:''' But Lady Yae just said "don't worry about it. As long as it sells, it's all good!"
::'''Rika:''' And in fact, this book actually sold pretty well.
::'''Rika:''' But every time I look at this text, I can only think: our Shogun truly is a forgiving soul...
:{{DIcon}} What's with those ears...
::'''Rika:''' Oh, they're just a prop, as is this shrine maiden costume that I'm wearing.
::'''Rika:''' Actually, I'm just a part-time employee at [[Yae Publishing House]], and my job this time is to act as one of the characters in the light novel to advertise a collaborative drink.
:{{DIcon}} About the event-exclusive drink...
::'''Rika:''' Oh, you mean "[[Rainbow Aster]]"?
::'''Rika:''' In the novel, this is the drink that the Kitsune Guuji made for the main character &mdash; the Shogun &mdash; when the latter was ill.
::'''Rika:''' It has a most refreshing taste, owing to the addition of [[Mint]], as well as [[Calla Lily|Calla Lilies]] from Mondstadt.
::'''Rika:''' After drinking it, the main character realizes that the Kitsune Guuji was not angry, but was instead being supportive all this time, and so becomes able to overcome a crisis.
::'''Rika:''' After the novel came out, Yae Publishing House has received a constant stream of letters from readers, expressing interest in having just such a drink.
::'''Rika:''' As such, we've used the occasion of the [[Irodori Festival]] to develop this drink alongside Sailing Breeze.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Rika:''' Take care, Almighty Shogun!
