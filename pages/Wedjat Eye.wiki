The '''Wedjat Eye''', a green gemstone with the ability to store memories, is an ancient relic that [[King Deshret]] once gifted to [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]]. It was rediscovered in the present day and crafted into two amulets, which are now in the custody of the [[Temple of Silence]].

==Story==
According to legend, during the first [[Sabzeruz Festival]], [[Nabu Malikata]] and King Deshret each prepared a surprise gift for Greater Lord Rukkhadevata. The former gave her the [[Khvarena]] to protect the rainforest, while the latter gave her the Wedjat Eye to record the moments the three spent together. However, the Wedjat Eye was lost to the sands after Rukkhadevata's death in the [[Cataclysm]].<ref name="Memories">{{Ref/Quest|Give Her Memories}}</ref>

Several months before the present, the Eye was unearthed as a cracked piece of ore in an old desert ruin. It made its way to a craftsman who, upon seeing that it was split down the middle, chose to turn it into two amulets, which they then sold in the desert.<ref name="Sweetness">{{Ref/Quest|Give Her Sweetness}}</ref> They were purchased by [[Candace]] and [[Sethos]], respectively, each of whom had sensed an odd energy from the gem. On a hunch, Sethos consulted the records at the Temple of Silence and connected the gem to the legend of the first Sabzeruz Festival, which he later shared with Candace when they met up by coincidence. He then proposed that the Temple of Silence take custody of the amulets, as they were responsible for preserving artifacts from the time of King Deshret, to which Candace readily agreed.<ref name="Memories" />

Though the Wedjat Eye has lost most of its power over the centuries, it is still capable of replaying and recording short fragments of memories. It apparently also contains an "unusual [[element]]al energy,"<ref name="Surprises">{{Ref/Quest|Give Her Surprises}}</ref> and only seems to respond to the people of the desert (i.e., the descendants of King Deshret).<ref name="Memories" />

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* The stylized "eye" of the goddess {{w|Wadjet|Wedjat}} is one of the most iconic symbols of ancient Egypt. The "{{w|Eye of Horus|left wedjat eye}}" was associated with the god {{w|Horus}} and the "{{w|Eye of Ra|right wedjat eye}}" with the god {{w|Ra}}, both of whom were protective deities. The eyes were often depicted as green or blue, perhaps as a nod to Wedjat's name: "Green One."
** Horus and Ra are sometimes associated with the moon and sun, respectively, much like Nabu Malikata and King Deshret.
