==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Nayab:''' I must... I must win. Even just once.
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Nayab:''' If we're talking careers, I'm a [[matra]] of the Akademiya. You don't have to be nervous. It's not my working hours now.
::'''Nayab:''' Under the strict supervision of the [[Cyno|General Mahamatra]], the spreading of banned knowledge and academic corruption in the Akademiya has decreased significantly. Thanks to Lord Cyno, us subordinates' vacations have also become more frequent.
::'''Nayab:''' Many students often have meals together in this café, but most of their conversations are just regular chats.
::'''Nayab:''' Although the matra are in charge of many things, they are not responsible for collecting students' evaluations and opinions about their mentors.
::'''Nayab:''' So right now, I am just an ordinary person of Sumeru who is enjoying coffee while studying card strategies.
:{{DIcon}} Win what?
::'''Nayab:''' Don't you know? It's [[Genius Invokation TCG]], the greatest craze in all of Sumeru, maybe even in all of Teyvat!
::'''Nayab:''' The varied decks, the unpredictable turns... It is all so fascinating.
::'''Nayab:''' That's how all my vacation was just somehow spent playing cards, or studying how to play.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Interesting.
::'''Nayab:''' You think so, too? Then you should come to Puspa Café more often. It has people fighting tooth and nail every day!
::'''Nayab:''' I mean fighting in Genius Invokation TCG, of course. If someone started an actual fight, [[Enteka|the acting manager]] would flip out before I did.
::'''Nayab:''' Say, are you free now? I want to show you the new deck I built, and maybe you can help me figure out how I can win with it?
:;(Obtain [[Hero's Wit]] ×2)
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Nayab:''' Goodbye, I already have an idea...
