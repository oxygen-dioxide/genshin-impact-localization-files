|text      = It truly is rare that I have nothing to do all day. No need to hide from anyone, nobody chasing after me to go pray... I never thought that I'd get such special treatment on a day that really isn't special at all.

Yet even when I sit in a [[Angel's Share|tavern]] in broad daylight, I can't help but feel a bit bored seeing nothing but empty chairs. So after giving it a bit of thought, I finally decided to write letters to invite a few friends over.

After all, there's a discount on drinks for larger groups, so let's make the most of this opportunity and down a few extra glasses.

Its up to you if you want to come or not. It's not like I'm one of those on-duty Sisters always running around forcing people to do things.
