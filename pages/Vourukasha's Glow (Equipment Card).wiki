==Trivia==
*The figure on the card is wearing clothes almost identical to [[Nilou|Nilou's]] outfit, [[Neither Flower Nor Mist]], with the pallette swapped. The figure may thus or may not be [[Nabu Malikata]], who said outfit is modeled after.
*The figure could also be a pilgrim to the Vourukasha Oasis and worshipper of the Goddess of Flowers, as described in [[Stamen of Khvarena's Origin]].
