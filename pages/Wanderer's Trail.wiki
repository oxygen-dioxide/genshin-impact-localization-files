{{Dialogue Start}}
;(The game begins with the opening cinematic; the [[Traveler]] and [[Traveler's Sibling|their sibling]] step onto a structure in the sky.)
:{{A|vo op cs paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... what you're trying to say is that you fell here... from another world?
:{{A|vo op cs paimon 02.ogg}} {{A|vo op cs paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But when you wanted to leave, and go on to the next world, your path was blocked by some unknown god?
:;(The [[Unknown God]] appears, blocking their path.)
:{{A|vo op cs kiana 01.ogg}} '''Unknown God:''' Outlanders, your journey ends here!
:{{A|vo op cs heroine 01.ogg}} '''Lumine:''' Who're you!?
:{{A|vo op cs kiana 02.ogg}} '''Unknown God:''' The sustainer of heavenly principles. The arrogation of mankind ends now.
:;(The twins battle with the Unknown God, but it is futile. The Traveler's sibling is engulfed by a swarm of red-and-black cubes and condensed into a single cube in the god's hand.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' {{MC|Lumine|Aether|mc=1}}!
:;(The Traveler tries to take back their sibling, only to be engulfed themselves.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' Wait! Don't go! Give my {{MC|sister|brother|mc=1}} back!
----
:{{A|vo op cs hero 04.ogg}} {{A|vo op cs heroine 05.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' And just like that, the god took away my {{MC|sister|brother|mc=1}}.
:{{A|vo op cs hero 05.ogg}} {{A|vo op cs heroine 06.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' Some kind of seal was cast upon me, and I lost my power. {{MC|So while we used to travel from world to world|So whilst we used to cross world after world|mc=1}}, we are now trapped here.
:{{A|vo op cs hero 06.ogg}} {{A|vo op cs heroine 07.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' How many years ago was it? I don't know...
:{{A|vo op cs hero 07.ogg}} {{A|vo op cs heroine 08.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' But I intend to find out.
:{{A|vo op cs hero 08.ogg}} {{A|vo op cs heroine 09.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' {{MC|When I woke, I was all alone &mdash; until I met you two months ago...|After I awoke, I was all alone &mdash; right up until I met you two months ago.|mc=1}}
:{{A|vo op cs paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, Paimon really owes you for that. Otherwise Paimon likely would have drowned...

:{{A|vo op cs paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, Paimon will do her best to be a great guide!
:{{A|vo op cs paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We should head off. Let's get going!

;(Upon approaching the cliff)
:{{A|vo mdaq003 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The path ends here &mdash; guess we'll just have to {{Color|buzzword|climb}}.
:{{A|vo_tips_paimon_01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' {{Color|buzzword|Climbing}} depletes {{Color|buzzword|stamina}}, and depleted stamina takes time to recover!
:{{A|vo mdaq003 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, let's take the route we planned!
:{{A|vo mdaq003 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're off to... a Statue of The Seven!
:{{A|vo mdaq003 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Which of The Seven are you looking for exactly?
