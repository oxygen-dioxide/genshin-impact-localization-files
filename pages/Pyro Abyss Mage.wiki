{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Pyro Shield
|desc_1 = Upon initiating combat, the Pyro Abyss Mage immediately gains a {{Pyro}} [[Shield]], protecting it from damage. The shield takes damage from certain [[Elemental Reactions]] and suffers additional damage based on the strength of the attacks it receives.
{{Elemental Shield Data|Pyro|12}}
|strat_1 = {{Hydro}} attacks are the most effective at destroying the Pyro shield by triggering the [[Vaporize]] reaction. {{Electro}} is the second most effective option.

|name_2 = Flamewave
|desc_2 = Shoots a fire projectile at the target, dealing '''66.6% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}. The projectile sticks to terrain and cannot hit airborne targets.
|file_2 = Pyro Abyss Mage Normal Attack

|name_3 = Special Attack: Blazing Visage
|desc_3 = Summons three demon heads in a triangle formation to spew fire at the target's location, each dealing '''66.6% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}. This attack is affected by a [[Damage Sequence]].
|file_3 = Pyro Abyss Mage Special Attack

|name_4 = Teleportation
|desc_4 = If the target is too far from the mage, it clutches its mask and teleports directly in front of the target, dealing '''66.6% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} at its location upon reappearance. The mage can also teleport away from the player to avoid attacks when vulnerable.

|name_5 = Rite of the Molten Eruption
|desc_5 = If the mage is left alone after its shield is destroyed, summons bursts of fire which erupt from the ground around it, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} and launching targets. During this attack, the mage's [[Interruption Resistance]] is increased. If the mage is not staggered or defeated within 10 seconds, it regains a Pyro Shield, dealing '''100% ATK''' and '''133.3% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}.

|name_6 = Burning Damage Immunity
|desc_6 = The Pyro Abyss Mage is immune to damage dealt by the [[Burning]] Elemental Reaction (but not the reaction itself) and damage from burning [[grass]].

|name_7 = Enhancement
|desc_7 = Certain enhanced Pyro Abyss Mages can be found in certain [[Domains]], [[Spiral Abyss]], overworld events and challenges. There are 3 possible types of enhancements: Attack, Shield, and Teleportation.
* '''Attack Enhancement:''' While using '''Blazing Visage''', generates 2 extra sets of demon heads to form a larger triangle with a total of 9 heads.
* '''Shield Enhancement:''' The '''Pyro Shield''' becomes twice as durable. When a character's attack hits the shield, 1 [[gauge unit]] of Pyro will be applied to the character.
* '''Teleportation Enhancement:''' While teleporting, deals '''66.6% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} at its location upon disappearance.
