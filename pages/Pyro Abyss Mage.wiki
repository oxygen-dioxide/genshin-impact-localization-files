{{Description|Abyss creatures who command the power of Pyro in battle. For unknown reasons, Abyss Mages are able to communicate with the hilichurls, thus enabling them to manipulate their minds easily. They say that Abyss Mages utter a long-forgotten language from which they draw magical power.|[[Archive]]}}

{{Enemy Stats|hp_ratio=2|atk_ratio=3|hp_type=1}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Pyro Shield:''' Upon initiating combat, the Pyro Abyss Mage immediately gains a {{Pyro}} [[Shields|Shield]], protecting it from damage. The shield takes damage from certain [[Elemental Reactions]] and suffers additional damage based on the strength of the attacks it receives. If it is [[rain]]ing, the Pyro Abyss Mage starts without a shield, and the Pyro Abyss Mage's shield degrades at a fixed rate.
*'''Normal Attack:''' Shoots a fire projectile at the target, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}. The projectile sticks to terrain and cannot hit airborne targets.
*'''Special Attack: Demon Heads:''' Summons three demon heads in a triangle formation to spew fire at the target's location, each dealing '''100% ATK''', '''50% ATK''', '''25% ATK''' respectively as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}.
*'''Teleportation:''' If the target is too far from the mage, it clutches its mask and teleports directly in front of the target, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Pyro DMG}} at its location upon reappearance. The mage can also teleport away from the player to avoid attacks when vulnerable.
*'''Revival:''' If the mage is left alone after its shield is destroyed, summons bursts of fire which erupt from the ground around it, dealing '''150% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Pyro DMG}} and launching targets. During this attack, the mage's [[Interruption Resistance]] is increased. If the mage is not staggered or defeated within 10 seconds, it regains a Pyro Shield, dealing '''150% ATK''' and '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Pyro DMG}}.
*'''Enhancement:''' Certain enhanced Pyro Abyss Mages can be found in certain [[Domains]], [[Spiral Abyss]], overworld events and challenges. There are 3 possible types of enhancements: Attack, Shield, and Teleportation.
**'''Attack Enhancement:''' While using '''Demon Heads''', generates 2 extra sets of demon heads to form a larger triangle with a total of 9 heads.
**'''Shield Enhancement:''' The '''Pyro Shield''' becomes twice as durable. When a character's attack hits the shield, 1 [[gauge unit]] of Pyro will be applied to the character.
**'''Teleportation Enhancement:''' While teleporting, deals '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Pyro DMG}} at its location upon disappearance.

==Strategy==
*{{Hydro}} attacks are the most effective at destroying the Pyro shield by triggering the [[Vaporize]] reaction.
*{{Cryo}} attacks cause [[Melt]], dealing moderate damage to its shield.
*{{Electro}} attacks cause [[Overloaded]]. The resulting explosion can affect surrounding monsters dealing {{Color|[[AoE]] Pyro DMG}} and can cause [[knockback]], also dealing moderate damage to the Mage's shield.
