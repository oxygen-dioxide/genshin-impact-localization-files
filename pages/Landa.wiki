<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Landa is a traveling merchant from Mondstadt. While he claims to be a worker for the "Morn Winery" owned by a rich merchant in Liyue,<ref name="bigbusiness">{{Ref/Quest|Big Business}}</ref> he is actually a [[Fatui Agent]] working for the [[Harbinger]] [[Pantalone]].<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Landa|idle=1}}</ref>

During one of his travels, he lost boxes of invoices and asked the Traveler to retrieve them. One of the boxes was found by a Treasure Hoarder named [[Bao'er]]. According to her, the invoices seemed to be really big and important and warned the Traveler not to ask questions about the transactions.<ref name="bigbusiness"/>

==Dialogue==
{{dialogue start}}
:'''Landa:''' Can I help you? As you can see I'm a merchant from [[Mondstadt]] &mdash; so in the wine business, of course!
:'''Landa:''' W-Why are you looking at me like that. I'm telling the truth, I swear...
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Landa:''' My name is Landa, and I'm in the wine business. That girl darting about all over the show is my daughter, Tia.
::'''Landa:''' Did you know that all of Mondstadt's wine exports go via Liyue before being distributed to the rest of the continent?
::'''Landa:''' And have you heard of the Morn Winery? That's where it comes from.
::'''Landa:''' ...Sorry yes, [[Dawn Winery]]. Not Morn. Dawn.
::{{DIcon}} ...No true child of Mondstadt would make that mistake.
:::'''Landa:''' Give me a break, I just haven't been back to Mondstadt in forever is all.
:::'''Landa:''' Meanwhile, I've gotten to know this place like the back of my hand. I've traveled this route on business more times than I can remember.
:::'''Landa:''' Both the innkeeper and the boss of this place will vouch for me on that!
:::'''Landa:''' Isn't that right, [[Huai'an]]? [[Verr Goldet|Goldet]]? Hahahaha...
:::'''Landa:''' ...Come on, don't leave me hanging now...
::{{DIcon}} You get cuter each time you open your mouth.
:::'''Landa:''' ...What a strange thing to say.
:::'''Landa:''' Anyway, you want to hear a secret that only someone in the wine business could tell you?
:::'''Landa:''' "Angel's Share" actually used to be wine brewers' slang before it was the name of a tavern.
:::'''Landa:''' The idea was that the air bubbles you see during fermentation carry away the angel's share when they float off into the wind.
:::'''Landa:''' Not bad huh? Vintage Mondstadt knowledge!
:{{DIcon}} Whatever you say, I have to go.
::'''Landa:''' What's that supposed to mean? I'm telling the truth!
::'''Landa:''' Next time you see me re-stocking in Mondstadt, you'll know I'm the real deal!

==Trivia==
* Landa may be the Snezhnayan merchant mentioned in [[Noelle]]'s [[Noelle/Lore#Character Story 2|second Character Story]], who went to Mondstadt with plans to ruin their wine industry. The merchant ultimately fled the country with his family, a daughter, out of fear of Noelle's apparent ability to read his mind &mdash; which was really just an extension of her dutiful nature.
* Landa left a message at the [[Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board]] about the "Morn Winery".

===Etymology===
* His name could possibly be derived from Proto-Germanic *''landą,'' meaning "land".
* His name could also be derived from a Spanish surname.
