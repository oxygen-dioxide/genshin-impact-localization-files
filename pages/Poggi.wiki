'''Poggi''' is a quest-exclusive [[Yumkasaur Whelp]] [[NPC]] that appears in the {{Quest|Yupanqui's Turnfire}}.

==Profile==
Poggi is one of the three children of the [[Yumkasaur]] [[Nanna]]. Together with its mother and two siblings [[Pocchi]] and [[Ponini]], it lives with [[Huni]] and her father [[Trinidad]] in [["Scions of the Canopy"]].

During {{Quest|A Mysterious Visitor From Huitztlan}}, it ran off and hid atop a cliff along with its siblings after they presumed their mother to be dead. Afterward, it and its siblings were rescued by the [[Traveler]]. Later, during {{Quest|I, Flame Bearer}}, if the player is late at catching [[Matthias]], Poggi and its siblings surround Matthias and block his path to help catch him.

===Appearance===
Poggi is a Yumkasaur Whelp who appears distinct from others of its kind, as it wears a green hat with a spiky design reminiscent a saurian's back.
