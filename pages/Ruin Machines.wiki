{{Description|An ancient humanoid war machine. They are said to be remnants from a lost ancient nation.}}
'''Ruin Machines''' are mechanical war machines created by the lost civilization of [[Khaenri'ah]]. These enemies deal mainly {{Color|[[Physical]] DMG}}, except for the Ruin Hunter which has an attack that deals {{Color|Pyro DMG}}.

==Types==
===Elite Enemies===
*[[Humanoid Ruin Machines]] – A sub-group of humanoid Ruin Machines. Their form is limited to what was preengineered.
**{{Enemy|Ruin Guard}} – Large machines that guard ruins. They attack with homing missiles and their powerful arms.
**{{Enemy|Ruin Hunter}} – War machines armed with sharp appendages that have propellers instead of legs. They can also fire barrages of missiles, or unleash a beam dealing {{Color|[[Pyro]] DMG}}.
**{{Enemy|Ruin Grader}} – A giant war machine that looks like a larger, stronger Ruin Guard. They are completely silent compared to the other two variants.
*[[Ruin Sentinels]] – A series of unusual machines that take on many forms to attack enemies with a variety of attacks.
**{{Enemy|Ruin Cruiser}} – A hovering machine composed of multiple interdependent parts, themed after honeybee colonies.
**{{Enemy|Ruin Destroyer}} – A machine that anchors itself in the ground to attack, themed after a plant, possibly [[Regisvines]].
**{{Enemy|Ruin Defender}} – A machine equipped with a shield, themed after an insect, possibly beetles.
**{{Enemy|Ruin Scout}} – A hovering machine that sets dangerous energy orbs on the field, themed after jellyfish.

*{{Enemy|Perpetual Mechanical Array}} – A massive ruin unit consisting of four Ruin Sentinels that takes on the form of the [[Hypostases]] and bears a similar attack style to them by transforming into various objects.
*{{Enemy|Ruin Serpent}} – A snake-like machine that appears to be a digging machine of sorts, utilizing its mass to crush enemies and generate [[Dark Mud]] and [[Oozing Concretions]] to weaken enemies.

==Description==
Ruin Machines are ancient machines from the lost nation of [[Khaenri'ah]]<ref name="Reunited">[[We Will Be Reunited]]</ref> and can be found across [[Teyvat]], particularly in the ruins of ancient civilizations. However, these Ruin Machines do not come from the same source as the ruins they inhabit, with a time difference of up to several thousand years.<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Ruin Guard}}</ref>

Humanoid Ruin Machines take on a Cyclops-like design, though they differ in terms of size and build. Except for Ruin Graders, they speak in an unknown language when attacking. By targeting their weak points &mdash; their glowing eyes or, on Ruin Graders, the weak points on their back and feet &mdash; they can be stunned, causing them to be temporarily disabled and lie defenseless on the ground. These weak points are immune to attack when circular runes or text appear around them. Ruin Graders are significantly sturdier and are not left as defenseless as their other counterparts.

Ruin Sentinels take on forms of various animals from both real life and in-game. By targeting their weak points &mdash; their oculi - they can be stunned, causing them to be temporarily disabled. While not as strong as a Ruin Grader, Ruin Sentinels are more durable than most humanoid Ruin Machines, in that they may need their weak point struck twice, as the first successful hit may simply stagger the machine, whereas a second hit outright disables them like the humanoid ones suffer. Unlike their humanoid counterparts, the Ruin Sentinels willingly expose their weak spot while performing specific attacks.

They are usually given distinct letter-number "serial codes," followed by 5 digits. For Ruin Guards, the prefix is "Hu-"; for Ruin Hunters the prefix is "Fo-"; and for Ruin Graders the prefix is "Ra-."

===Origins===
The people of Khaenri'ah called them Field Tillers, a codename based on the saying "The land is not to be tilled with farming tools, but rather to be fought for with steel and blood".<ref name="Reunited"/> Following the fall of Khaenri'ah, the Ruin Machines wandered aimlessly across Teyvat for hundreds of years, mostly ending up in the ruins of former civilizations, causing the people of the present era to mistake them as the guardians of the ruins, hence terming them "Ruin Machines". Some have completely broken down, while others remain active and roaming, or inactive until they sense people nearby.

The first known automaton was a prototype [[Weird Statue|Field Tiller]], which [[Dainsleif]] states to be stronger than the many created after it, despite sharing the same appearance as them. It is unknown if the Ruin Hunters or Graders were variants improved from the mass-produced series.

Interacting with the inactive Ruin Guards in the [[Record of Serial No.]] puzzle gives the decoded message: ''"For the nation, we can't forgo this [[Celestia|skyborne power]], but we failed."'' It is unclear whether these Ruin Machines belonged to the main civilization that dwelt there, [[Sal Vindagnyr]], but current Dragonspine lore attributes the fall of Sal Vindagnyr to Celestia and the dropping of the [[Skyfrost Nail]].

Ruin Machines (Ruin Guards and Ruin Hunters at least) were already being made during or before the [[Archon War]], as the realm created by the [[adepti]] in [[Liyue]] to store ''"several ancient and evil artifacts"'' acquired by [[Guizhong]] contained Ruin Guards and single Ruin Hunter.<ref>{{Ref/Domain|Voyage to the Sanguine Sky}}</ref>

As part of the [[Fatui]]'s research into [[The Abyss]], the [[Harbinger]] [[Il Dottore]] built a Ruin Guard [[The Wonderful World Of Mr. Cyclops|research facility]] in [[Liyue]], which remained operational after he deserted the facility out of boredom. According to [[Tartaglia|Childe]], these machines are not built by the Fatui, but have some connection to the [[Abyss Order]]. He is not clear if the Abyss Order created them or simply took advantage of them.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Defender of Childhood Dreams}}</ref>

Ruin Sentinels are animal-like machines which are particularly prevalent in [[Inazuma]] alongside humanoid ruin machines. They were also brought into [[Enkanomiya]] by the people of Khaenri'ah.

Ruin Machines also appeared in [[The Chasm]], with both normal and sentinel-type machines being dug up in the area.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Voyage Prep}}</ref><ref>Video: [[:File:Version 2.5 Special Program｜Genshin Impact|Version 2.5 Special Program]]</ref>

==Trivia==
*According to the description of the third phase of [[Invitation of Windblume/Peculiar Wonderland|Peculiar Wonderland]], Ruin Machines stand 15 meters tall, although the description did not clarify whether this referred to Ruin Guards or Ruin Graders, which differ in height. It's possible that it is referring to the Ruin Grader.
*[[Ruin Guard#Trivia|Ruin Guards' names]] are prefixed with Hu-, HU-, or GN/Hu. [[Ruin Hunter#Trivia|Ruin Hunters' names]] are prefixed with Fo-. [[Ruin Grader|Ruin Graders' names]] are prefixed with Ra-. All prefixes are followed by 5 numbers except for one case of 4 numbers following Hu-. See the individual pages for more details.
