|description    = A slender, amphibious fish that has the peculiar habit of warming itself up at shallows or sandbanks.<br>The lovely meat of the unagi has a unique flavor when grilled, and is a much-beloved delicacy in [[Inazuma]].<br>Moreover, after a period of time in a hospitable environment such as the Realm Within, the Unagi's character will become mild to the point of dullness.
