;(Approach Naganohara Fireworks)
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 naganohararyuunosuke 01.ogg}} '''Naganohara Ryuunosuke:''' Have you packed all your things? Make sure you've brought the onigiri and rice cakes your mother prepared.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Don't worry, I have them all! They're going to last me days!
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Take care of yourselves while I'm out, and make sure you remind Mom to take her medicine on time.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' If running the store gets a bit too much, take some time off and wait for me to return.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 naganohararyuunosuke 02.ogg}} '''Naganohara Ryuunosuke:''' Oh, Yoimiya, your mother and I got so worried when we heard that you were going so far abroad.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 naganohararyuunosuke 03.ogg}} '''Naganohara Ryuunosuke:''' We've never left the country, so we don't know how outlanders might view us Inazumans, or if they'd even be willing to speak to us...
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 04.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh, relax! Outlanders are friendly and warm!
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 05.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Look at Thoma from the Yashiro Commission. He's originally from Mondstadt, but everyone thinks he's a top-tier guy!
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 naganohararyuunosuke 04.ogg}} '''Naganohara Ryuunosuke:''' A mop-tier? What mop? Oh, do you mean the broken one at home? I just fixed it today, actually.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 06.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' No, I said "top," not "mop"! You know, Thoma even sent us some wine from his homeland not too long ago.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We haven't heard this kind of friendly banter in a while, huh?
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 07.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh, hey you two! It's been a long time, hasn't it?
:{{DIcon}} You're as peppy as ever.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 08.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Hehe, I'm excited because I'm going on a trip soon!
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 09.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Many things have changed. Lots of outlanders have come to Inazuma, and lots of Inazumans have gone out as well.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 10.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' You two have been adventuring all over Teyvat, so you might not be able to understand, but for us, this is a long-awaited chance to go out and fulfill our dreams!
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's right, the [[Sakoku Decree]] is gone.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 naganohararyuunosuke 05.ogg}} '''Naganohara Ryuunosuke:''' Ah, I remember you two. You're Yoimiya's friends, yes?
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 naganohararyuunosuke 06.ogg}} '''Naganohara Ryuunosuke:''' Word of your incredible accomplishments has spread throughout Inazuma. My daughter's a big fan of yours &mdash; she said she'd love to be like you two.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 11.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Hehe, c'mon, Dad... Who's never dreamed of becoming a hero?
:{{DIcon}} You've done some heroic feats yourself.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 12.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Aw, thanks, but I'm just your average artisan. The quiet life suits me better.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 13.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' But if an opportunity presents itself, why not try to show your stuff, right?
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 naganohararyuunosuke 07.ogg}} '''Naganohara Ryuunosuke:''' Alright, did you two come over today to order some fireworks?
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 14.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh! Sorry, sorry, I got carried away.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 15.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' While I'm gone, Dad's in charge of making fireworks. You've seen how skilled he is, so there's nothing to worry about.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, no, we aren't here to do business or anything. We just happened to be passing by!
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 16.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh, so we're all here with time to spare. What a treat!
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 17.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' In that case, let's chat some more! I'm not in a rush, anyway.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure! So, where are you planning to go?
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 18.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' No clue!
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 19.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Hahaha! I say that, but I do have a travel goal: to see Teyvat's grandest meteor shower.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 20.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' But I don't know when or where it'll happen, so I figured I can search while I travel.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...That's it? No details? Nothing?
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 21.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Not right now, since this meteor shower was originally something like a family legend.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 22.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' A long time ago, the Naganoharas were inspired to create new fireworks after watching such a meteor shower.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 23.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Dad says that inspiration is a combination of what you see and what you know. Different people can see the same thing but have different thoughts.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 24.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Inazuma today is completely different from how it was in the past. If I can see this meteor shower, I'm sure I'll be able to come up with a new kind of firework.
:{{DIcon}} Meteors and fireworks...
:{{DIcon}} They do have some similarities.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 25.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I know, right? Of course, my main reason is that I want to go and look outside Inazuma, hehe.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No need to be shy about it! You gotta play hard when you get the chance!
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 26.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' You know, you're right, Paimon! Is it just me, or have you gotten wiser since we first met?
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon loves being friends with you since you say such nice things!
:{{DIcon}} Since you're going out to play regardless...
:{{DIcon}} Why not make Sumeru your first stop?
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 27.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Sumeru... I've heard of it. It has a ton of trees, a super impressive school, and a massive desert!
:{{DIcon}} There's also a division of the school that specializes in studying the stars.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, and everyone there is really smart, so Paimon's sure you'll get some answers from them about the meteor shower!
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 28.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Really? But, won't research people make fun of me or something if I ask them about a legend?
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We won't know if something's real or not unless we ask! Don't worry, we've got solid connections in there!
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 paimon 11a.ogg}} {{A|vo xglq201 1 paimon 11b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, {{MC|m=he|f=she}} does, anyway...
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 29.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Wouldn't I be taking up your time, though? I doubt this was in your schedule...
:{{DIcon}} It's fine. This way, your parents can be at ease.
:{{DIcon}} I'll be your guide.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Exactly! Relax, Yoimiya. You've helped us plenty of times before.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 30.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Haha, alright! Then I accept your offer! Let's have some fun in Sumeru!
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 31a.ogg}} <!--{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 31b.ogg}}-->'''Yoimiya:''' Dad, you can have more peace of mind now that I'm traveling with them, right?
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 naganohararyuunosuke 08.ogg}} '''Naganohara Ryuunosuke:''' Hm? Ah, yes, your mother and I will be much more at ease.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 32.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Remember, you two also need to take care of yourselves! I'll be back soon.
:{{A|vo xglq201 1 yoimiya 33.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Okay, let's head to Ritou and catch a boat there.

:'''During the Journey at Sea:''' You board a passenger ship bound for Port Ormos, enjoying the lovely ocean views along the way.
:'''During the Journey at Sea:''' Yoimiya listens with rapt attention as you tell her of the events following the Vision Hunt Decree and of your various adventures in Sumeru.
:'''During the Journey at Sea:''' The long voyage ends before you know it...
:;(The group arrives at Port Ormos)
:{{A|vo xglq201 2 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Wow, so this is Sumeru?
:{{A|vo xglq201 2 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' That tree's huge... Is the port built on top of it?
:{{A|vo xglq201 2 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' And this place is amazing! It's way bigger than Ritou's port! There are also a lot more stores here.
:{{A|vo xglq201 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, there's more cool stuff for you to see, don't you worry!
:{{DIcon}} Port Ormos also took my breath away when I first arrived.
:{{DIcon}} Welcome to Sumeru.
:{{A|vo xglq201 2 yoimiya 04.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' This place is awesome! I had heard people describe it, but nothing beats seeing a place for yourself...
:{{A|vo xglq201 2 yoimiya 05.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' If I hadn't seen the port with my own eyes, I could never have imagined such a place.
:{{A|vo xglq201 2 yoimiya 06.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' So, the school you were talking about... the Akademiya? Is it here?
:{{A|vo xglq201 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nope. We have to head north from here and follow the river to reach Sumeru City.
:{{A|vo xglq201 2 yoimiya 07.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Sumeru City, huh... I guess it's even more impressive than here?
:{{DIcon}} They each have their own highlights.
::{{A|vo xglq201 2 yoimiya 08a 1.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Looking forward to it! Heehee, I'm so excited!
:{{DIcon}} The city has an even bigger tree.
::{{A|vo xglq201 2 yoimiya 08b 1.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Even bigger!? Oh, I wonder if it's as grand as Sangonomiya Shrine...
:{{DIcon}} It's a land of neverending theses.
::{{A|vo xglq201 2 yoimiya 08c 1.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' The...ses? Um, I don't know much about them, but they sound like something that's a cause for serious anxiety.
:{{A|vo xglq201 2 yoimiya 09.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Whatever the case, why don't we go to Sumeru City?
:{{A|vo xglq201 2 yoimiya 10.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh, I'm so excited that I don't even know what I should be doing anymore!
:{{A|vo xglq201 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The important thing about going on a trip is to enjoy yourself! You don't have to think so hard.
:{{DIcon}} How about we walk around here with you?
:{{A|vo xglq201 2 yoimiya 11.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I'm just worried that if we don't get down to business soon, I'll take up too much of your time.
:{{A|vo xglq201 2 yoimiya 12.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Hehe, but if you insist... then let's look around!

:{{A|vo xglq201 3 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Wow, what are these? They're so cute!
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 fayez 02.ogg}} '''Fayez:''' This is our current best-seller, the Aranara Carving.
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 fayez 03.ogg}} '''Fayez:''' Their designs are based on the fairy tales that circulate amongst children, so they're very popular with them.
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 fayez 04.ogg}} '''Fayez:''' Miss, are you from Inazuma? This would be a great gift for you to bring back home.
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Ooh, I know about Aranara! You two told me about them on the ship. I didn't think they'd be so cute! No wonder the kids like 'em.
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Ooh, they're all so pretty. Lemme take a better look...
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon knew Yoimiya would like this kind of thing.
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But even she might have a hard time seeing a real Aranara...
:{{DIcon}} They don't like being disturbed.
:{{DIcon}} That's why we told her they're from fairy tales.
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah... Sorry Yoimiya, but we need to keep our promise to the Aranara.
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That said, Paimon doesn't think Yoimiya would mind too much.
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Her world's already chock-full of imaginary creatures.
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 yoimiya 04.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I think I'll get this one... ooh! That one, and the other two that you showed me earlier.
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh? You're buying that many?
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 yoimiya 05.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Yep! I'm going to give them out to [[Saika]] and the others. They're going to love them! Oh, and these carvings can also be used as prizes in matches against the [[Arataki Gang]].
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 yoimiya 06.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' They'd also look great lined up by the window. Think about it &mdash; you wake up, and the first thing you see are these adorable critters.
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 yoimiya 07.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Wouldn't they brighten up your entire day?
:{{DIcon}} Let me cover some of the cost.
:{{DIcon}} They start your day on the right foot.
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 yoimiya 08.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Hehe, okay, thanks! In that case, you take your pick, too.
:{{DIcon}} I'll go with this one.
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...For some reason, Paimon thinks it kinda looks like you, Yoimiya.
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 yoimiya 09.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Now that you mention it, it kinda does!
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 yoimiya 10.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' "Hello, Nara Paimon. My name is Aramiya!" Plip-plod, plip-plod.
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 yoimiya 11.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Is that how they talk? Hope I remembered correctly, hehe.
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That was really good! Wow, great memory. We only talked about Aranara that one time on the boat.
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 yoimiya 12.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' That's because they're so interesting! I'm pretty good at remembering those kinds of things.
:{{DIcon}} Could you please package these up for Aramiya?
:{{A|vo xglq201 3 fayez 05.ogg}} '''Fayez:''' Of course. Thank you for your patronage!

;(Approach the marked area in front of [[Menakeri's Treasure Shop]])
:{{A|vo xglq201 4 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Wow, this market is even busier than the one in Port Ormos.
:{{A|vo xglq201 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This is Treasures Street. Up from here is the Akademiya... Oh! And in that tree trunk is the Grand Bazaar. They're both pretty special places.
:{{A|vo xglq201 4 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I just saw a group of people come down, and they were all wearing the same outfit. Is that the Akademiya's uniform?
:{{A|vo xglq201 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's right. They also wear hats with different designs, depending on which Darshan they're in.
:{{A|vo xglq201 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' For example, we'll be looking for someone from Rtawahist. They know a lot about stars and stuff.
:{{A|vo xglq201 4 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Does this mean that you need uniforms like those to get in and out of the Akademiya?
:{{A|vo xglq201 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, Paimon doesn't think so...
:{{DIcon}} Is something worrying you, Yoimiya?
:;(Yoimiya looks downward at her outfit.)

:{{A|vo xglq201 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So even you get shy, huh?
:{{A|vo xglq201 4 yoimiya 05.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's pretend you're an Akademiya student, hard at work.
:{{A|vo xglq201 4 yoimiya 06.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Then in comes a bunch of outlanders in strange clothes who gawk and run around everywhere...
:{{A|vo xglq201 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon kinda gets what you mean.
:{{DIcon}} We'll be a bit distracting, won't we?
:{{DIcon}} We might even attract the matra's attention.
:{{A|vo xglq201 4 yoimiya 07.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I don't think we have to be too self-conscious, but it's still something to keep in mind.
:{{A|vo xglq201 4 yoimiya 08.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Why don't we look around here first? I've been wanting to see the "Zubayr Theater," anyway.
:{{A|vo xglq201 4 yoimiya 09.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' As for the Akademiya... let's go once I get myself a set of Sumeru-style clothes.
:{{A|vo xglq201 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, but Paimon thinks you're overthinking it.
:{{DIcon}} We'll find you a good tailor later.
:{{A|vo xglq201 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nilou might have some good recommendations!
:{{A|vo xglq201 4 yoimiya 10.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Hehe, sounds good. If we can watch a performance of hers while we're at it, that'd be even better!
:{{A|vo xglq201 4 yoimiya 11.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Alright, I'll be looking around here. I'm leaving the meteor shower inquiry to you two. Thanks a lot.
:{{A|vo xglq201 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No problem! We'll be right back.

;(Talk to Yoimiya again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xglq201 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I won't go too far, and don't worry about me getting bored. I'm an expert at finding ways to pass time!

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Yoimiya, optional)

;(Walk past the doors in the Akademiya towards the [[House of Daena]])
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We said we were gonna find someone from Rtawahist, but now that Paimon thinks about it, no one really fits the bill...
:{{DIcon}} Well, the previous Rtawahist sage was Azar.
:{{DIcon}} Layla's probably having a tough time right now...
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks Alhaitham might know something, but... Paimon doesn't want to talk to him.
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why don't we just ask around? Maybe we'll run into someone from Rtawahist.
:;(Nahida walks up from behind.)
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Looks like you two are in a pickle. Why not consult someone who always tells you everything she knows?
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nahida!? Why are you here?
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for the scare.
:{{DIcon}} Right on cue.

:{{A|vo xglq201 5 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Um... My answer is going to be even more of a disappointment.
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' You may have heard that the stars are related to people's fates.
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, lots of times.
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' If the stars dictate destiny, then do you think that destiny is something that is unchanging and always follows predicted outcomes?
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You have a point...
:{{DIcon}} If that were so...
:{{DIcon}} Rtawahist would have achieved one of their ultimate goals.
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' According to current Rtawahist research, a meteor shower is a celestial phenomenon that occurs due to the interference between many intricate fates.
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Their appearance is highly random. Some have tried coming up with ways to predict their occurrence, but the results are less than reliable.
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' This is a far cry from folktales that claim meteor showers "come at certain times" and "bless all who witness them."
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you mean we won't be able to see one?
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I'm sorry to disappoint you two.
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If we tell this to Yoimiya, she'll be so disappointed...
:{{DIcon}} She's been so excited this entire time...
:{{DIcon}} This was a rare trip abroad for her.
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What now? There has to be something we can do...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Yoimiya's always genuine with everyone, and she does her best to protect the dreams of children.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Just like the time she hung out with the kids on the beach and talked with them about the Great Mujina Youkai.)

:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (And now, when she's the one who wants to see something, her fire has to be extinguished like this...)
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Are you two okay? It seems the news hit harder than I expected.
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon just thinks this isn't fair to Yoimiya.
:{{DIcon}} Good people should be repaid for their good deeds.
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I get it. From how you described her, I can see that she is a kind and caring soul...
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' So why don't we take a page out of her book and protect her dreams with a well-intentioned "lie"?
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? How do we do that?
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 nahida 15.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It'll be a story about a meteor shower. You'll accompany her on a brief journey, do a bit of work here and there, and then receive the meteor shower as a reward.
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 nahida 16.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Well, I can't summon a real meteor shower, but if it's in a dream, I can help out.
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! That would be great, Nahida!
:{{DIcon}} Thank you so much.
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 nahida 17.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Compared to what you've done for me, this is nothing.
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 nahida 18.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Use the meteor shower as a pretext to take Yoimiya all around Sumeru. Then, when you're ready, blow this.
:[[File:Item Emberglow Leaf.png|80px]]
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 nahida 19.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I'll tell the Aranara in advance. Once they hear the whole story, I'm sure they'll be willing to help.
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hm, then the dream will probably be like the one we had in the Avidya Forest, [[Silent Seeker of Knowledge|when we first met Haypasia]].<ref group="Note">This line and the two lines that follow are erroneous, as Paimon in reality was not with the Traveler during their Aranara-induced dream. See [[#Trivia|Trivia]] for further information.
</ref>
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That was a real shocker! It was hard to tell that we were even in a dream.
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, only later did we realize that.
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 nahida 20.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Once the meteor shower ends and you all awaken from the dream, she'll probably realize what had happened.
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 nahida 21.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' If you tell her the truth at that point, she should be a lot less disappointed.
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mm-hmm, Paimon thinks this is the best way to simulate the meteor shower. Thanks, Nahida!
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 nahida 22.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hehe, you're welcome. I'm glad I could help.
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 nahida 23.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Still, you two should get the story straight before you join up with your friend. If not, she's gonna see right through everything.
:{{A|vo xglq201 5 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' True. Let's discuss it on the way!
:;(The Traveler and Paimon walk outside the Akademiya.)
:{{A|vo xglq201 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, what we need to do is to make Yoimiya believe that the meteor shower is really happening, and be super convincing at how we sell it.
:{{DIcon}} Complete some challenges, and then reap the rewards.
:{{A|vo xglq201 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... If Paimon wanted to go see a meteor shower, the things Paimon would focus on the most would be...
:{{DIcon}} The start time...
:{{DIcon}} ...And the perfect vantage point.
:{{A|vo xglq201 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yes, exactly! We'll say we're trying to figure these two things out, but we'll actually be bringing Yoimiya around to see the sights and enjoy local food!
:{{A|vo xglq201 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Well, easier said than done. We can't be too strict with our pretext, but we can't be sloppy with it either, or she'll see through it.
:{{A|vo xglq201 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It'd be best if we could take a unique approach to making it fantastical, just like a real fairy tale. Hmm, this is gonna be hard...
:{{DIcon}} This reminds me of the Plane of Euthymia...
:{{DIcon}} When stars symbolizing wishes appeared in the sky.
:{{A|vo xglq201 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, that's right. Um, don't people also talk about wishing on a shooting star?
:{{A|vo xglq201 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If we used wishes as the center of our story...
:{{DIcon}} A meteor shower is something summoned by people's wishes.
:{{A|vo xglq201 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Woah, that sounds great! Alright then, we need a specific wishing spot, or else the sky would be full of meteor showers.
:{{DIcon}} We need a certain device to find this location.
:{{DIcon}} Just like how Rtawahist requires their observational instruments.
:{{A|vo xglq201 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And then while we're supposedly finding or making this device, we'll go around and have fun and eat good food!
:{{A|vo xglq201 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Heehee, this is shaping up to be the perfect plot!
:{{A|vo xglq201 6 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' After all, the device can be anything and the location can be wherever. As long as we get Yoimiya to enter the dream at night, things will be fine.
:{{DIcon}} You're getting ever smarter.
::{{A|vo xglq201 6 paimon 12a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This isn't about being smart, it's about being a good duo! The idea was yours, anyway. Paimon just knows what you wanna say!
:{{DIcon}} Your brain always works so well when food comes up.
::{{A|vo xglq201 6 paimon 12b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's nothing wrong with that! You should know Paimon pretty well by now.
:{{A|vo xglq201 6 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, alright, let's go. Yoimiya's probably sick of waiting for us.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Emberglow Leaf}})
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|At the Akademiya, you and Paimon learn that meteor showers only exist in myths and legends. After giving the situation some thought, you decide to take a page from Yoimiya's book and fabricate an interesting story.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Thanks so much! If it weren't for your help, I would've gotten lost already.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 avin 01.ogg}} '''Avin:''' It's no problem. I'll be heading home, then.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Just a minute, wait! This is for you.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' This is an Aranara Carving I bought in Port Ormos. I heard it's very popular with kids, so here, have one.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 avin 02.ogg}} '''Avin:''' It's alright, I didn't do much, really...
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 04.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' It's fine, take it! C'mon, just look at its big, happy smile!
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 05.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' You can display it at home or hang it on your wheelchair. It'll cheer you up.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 06.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' That might sound silly to you... Like, why do you have to be happy just because it is?
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 07.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' But that's the magic of a smile. If you don't believe me, try it. Look at it a few times every day, and you'll understand.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 avin 03.ogg}} '''Avin:''' ...Actually, I feel like I already do. You love talking, and you love smiling, too.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 avin 04.ogg}} '''Avin:''' I just don't understand why you're so... positive. I've never met anyone like you before.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 avin 05.ogg}} '''Avin:''' Sorry, I'm not very good with words. But since you say so, I'll accept your gift.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 08.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Want me to take you home?
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 avin 06.ogg}} '''Avin:''' It's okay, I can head back myself.
:{{Black Screen|The child in the wheelchair leaves.}}
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 09.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh, great timing, you two!
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who was that kid?
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 10.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh, her? Her name is Avin. I saw that she was looking quite forlorn, so I wanted to make sure she wasn't feeling left out or alone.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 11.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' She was pretty shy at first, but I explained that I just arrived in Sumeru and had gotten lost, so I needed someone to help guide me...
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 12.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' She agreed and we made our way back here.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 13.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' There were so many paths here, and they're all twisty-turny and up and down... It's hard navigating through them all.
:{{DIcon}} Did she tell you what's on her mind?
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 14.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' No, she didn't want to talk about that, and I didn't ask. I get the feeling that it'll bring up some unhappy memories.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 15.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' But if I had to guess, it's probably because she hasn't been able to explore the city for quite some time...
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 16.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' All she said was that she's sick and doesn't know when she'll get better.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 17.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Whenever we passed by busy crowds, she kept turning her head and taking in all the things around her. At first, I thought she was afraid that someone might bump into us...
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 18.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' But when I caught a glimpse in her eyes, I only saw yearning, and a deep sense of loss.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's hard to not be down when something like that happens to you.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 19.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' At first, she didn't really want to say anything to me at all &mdash; she just gave me yes and no answers.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 20.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' But what I really saw was just another child, and asked all the same things everyone else did, about rugs, spices, cooking, and the differences between here and home.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 21.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Eventually, I think I earned her trust. Hehe, there were many things that she liked in the city after all.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 22.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I say that, but honestly, you two probably caught the majority of what she said.
:{{DIcon}} She had already relaxed her guard around you.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 23.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Gotta start somewhere. Oh, by the way, did you guys learn anything about the meteor shower?
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You bet we did, big time! You're in luck, Yoimiya &mdash; you'll be able to see the meteor shower from Sumeru!
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 24.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Really!? Haha, that's great! If I had gone looking for it myself, I'm sure I would've missed it.
:{{DIcon}} Well, not necessarily.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 25.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Huh? What do you mean?
:{{DIcon}} Meteor showers appear in response to people's wishes.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 26.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' They respond to wishes? Huh. I've never heard that one before...
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 27.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' So it's not that you wish upon shooting stars, but that wishes summon them?
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 28.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Hehe, in that case, I was born ready! Don't you worry!
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you talking about how you want to use the meteor shower as inspiration for fireworks?
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 29.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' That's why I'm here, but I wouldn't call that my wish. I don't think that alone will call the stars down for us, right?
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, yeah, that makes sense.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Wow, she's adding her own spin onto this...)
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 30.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' If that's the case, then we'll have to "practice" wishing a little.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 31.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Can you two come with me? Let me put my thoughts together, and tell me if you understand.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 32.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' As for what my wish is... Hehe, it's a secret for now.
:{{DIcon}} How about a change of scenery?
:{{DIcon}} Let's go someplace that better fits the mood.
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, and we'll take the opportunity to show you some views you've definitely never seen before!
:{{A|vo xglq201 7 yoimiya 33.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' More places to see? Alright, let's go!
