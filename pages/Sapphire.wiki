'''Sapphire''' is a type of cat. It can be found both as a [[Wildlife]] and as a pet for the [[Serenitea Pot]] by capturing it via [[Omni-Ubiquity Net]].

Cats cannot be killed and are passive towards the player. Attacking one will make it fling backwards, and some [[Elemental Skill]]s can make it run away and disappear. Approaching one for the first time will add this creature's entry into your in-game [[Archive]].

In the Serenitea Pot, cats behave like it does in the open world with the only exception of it being able to disappear.

Common animals can be placed in indoor and outdoor spaces within the Serenitea Pot.
