|description = An agile and wise soul, endowed since birth with a well-maintained elegance and pride.<br>These pure white kitty cats are named and famed for their shining sapphire-blue eyes. But no matter how lovely Sapphires may be, they also have terrible tempers. One must take care to have some fish jerky &mdash; and some balm for superficial cuts &mdash; handy when hanging out with them.
