{{Description|A strange beetle that inhabits areas rich with Electro energy. Its docile and sedentary temperament could not be more different from the fierce, demonic visage displayed on its armored shell.<br />Inazuman folktales say that when the gods were apportioning territory to the many animals, the onikabuto, who detested conflict, chose first to live in lands saturated in Electro. As many years passed, it evolved bizarre patterns with which to frighten trespassers and developed horns that could release electricity to deter predators. Yet though it wears armor and bears horns, the onikabuto hates fighting most of all animals.}}
{{Lang|'''Onikabuto'''|ja=オニカブトムシ|ja_rm=Oni-kabutomushi|ja_tl=Ghost Japanese Rhinoceros Beetle}} are a [[Local Specialty]] found in the wild in some areas of [[Inazuma]].

==How to Obtain==
Onikabuto are found lounging on trees and rocks in areas of high {{Electro}} concentration, mainly on [[Narukami Island|Narukami]], [[Kannazuka]], [[Yashiori Island|Yashiori]] and [[Seirai Island]]. Onikabuto on trees must be reached; hitting the tree will not make it fall.

See the gallery or the '''[https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=196 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for specific locations.

Additionally, the following NPCs give Onikabuto after following a certain dialogue branch for the first time:
*[[Shouta]] in [[Inazuma City]], [[Inazuma]] (4 Onikabuto)

==Trivia==
* The following Birthday Mails included Onikabuto:
** [[Birthday/Shikanoin Heizou#A Small Trade...|Shikanoin Heizou's 2022 Birthday Mail]] (10 Onikabuto)
* Despite being living beings, they do not act like normal Wildlife which would flee from the player when they get close to them or die when hit.
* Onikabuto appear to be modeled after ''{{w|Japanese rhinoceros beetle|Allomyrina dichotoma}}'', the Japanese rhinoceros beetle, which is a common aspect of modern Japanese culture, especially among younger people.
* During [[Arataki Itto]]'s [[Story Quest]], larger, red onikabuto can be found and seen, although they cannot be collected.
