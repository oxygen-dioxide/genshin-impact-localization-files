|description = Even when Oz is not present in combat, he can still watch over Fischl through his raven eyes. When Fischl performs a [[Bolts of Downfall|Normal Attack]] against an opponent, Oz fires a joint attack, dealing DMG equal to 22% of Fischl's ATK.

'''Gaze of the Deep''' is [[Fischl]]'s [[Level 1 Constellation]].

==Gameplay Notes==
*The additional attack is fired from the orb near Fischl's shoulder and is only fired on [[Bolts of Downfall|Normal Attacks]] that have locked on to an enemy, regardless if it is blocked by obstacles or missed. The attack has slight homing and may bypass obstacles.
*The joint attack from Oz counts as a Normal Attack. Thus, any damage bonuses that apply to Normal Attacks (such as [[Rust]]'s passive) also apply to this additional attack.
*Oz's attack will do {{Color|Physical}} damage, not {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
