:'''Read:''' "This place above the clouds is built on a foundation of Plaustrite, one of the marvels of the world. Its original purpose was to serve as my private sanctuary, somewhere where I could get away from the world and escape the highs and lows of normal life.
:'''Read:''' Then the adepti took over the place as somewhere they could focus on seeking ultimate truth in seclusion. Now that [[Taishan Mansion]] is sealed off, they finally returned the place to me.
:'''Read:''' It's great to have it back, but I'm over it now. I want to go back to the world for a bit &mdash; I'll probably start with [[Guili Plains]]. Fitting, really &mdash; a round trip to the Plains of Returning and Departing, as they're also known... Hover around for a while, then hover away on a hovering stone... Heh."

==Lore==
The "Dwelling in the Clouds" was built on [[Plaustrite]] and was created by [[Cloud Retainer]] long ago. She left the [["Dwelling in the Clouds" Blueprints|blueprints]] for the manmade island on the Dwelling, hoping that someone with an affinity for it would one day discover it. When that failed to pass, she had the [[Traveler]] retrieve it for her.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|An Adeptal Summons}}</ref>

[[Zhongli]] visited the Dwelling in the Clouds on the fifth day after completing the {{Quest|The Stars Inscribe the Year's Wishes}}.
