When a character protected by this shield uses an Elemental Skill, 2 Night Stars will be created. Night Stars can be created once every 0.3s in this way. A maximum of 4 Night Stars can be accumulated at any one time.<br />Once the Curtain of Slumber has accumulated 4 Night Stars and there are opponents nearby, these Night Stars will transform into homing Shooting Stars that will be fired off in sequence, dealing {{Color|Cryo DMG}} to any opponents hit.<br />If the Curtain of Slumber's duration ends or it is destroyed, the Night Stars will disappear. If they are already being fired off as Shooting Stars, these Shooting Stars will last until this wave of shots ends.<br /><br />New Night Stars cannot be created until the previous wave of Shooting Stars has been fired completely.

{{Description|"She and I are like two master artisans who have never met, yet who sit at the same cushioned seat, embroidering the same dream-flower."}}
'''Nights of Formal Focus''' is [[Layla]]'s [[Elemental Skill]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* {{TalentNote|particles|Shooting Star|1.33}}
** This particle generation has a cooldown of '''3''' seconds.
* If this skill is used again while a Curtain of Slumber is still active, Night Stars will not be reset.
* Night Stars will also be generated by Skills with multiple inputs before Cooldowns, including [[Fischl]]'s Oz re-summon, [[Keqing]]'s [[Stellar Restoration]] second slash, [[Nilou]]'s [[Dance of Haftkarsvar]] Whirling Steps and Water Wheel (not Sword Dance or Luminous Illusion), [[Tartaglia]] or [[Wanderer]]'s input to end the stance, and [[Sayu]] or [[Yelan]]'s input to end the dash.
* The Night Stars will be transformed into Shooting Stars with a blinking of all 4 stars. If already in range of the Shooting Stars' [[Targeting|targeting]], there will be a delay of '''0.25''' seconds since the creation of the last Night Star. Otherwise, the transformation will occur immediately when entering the targeting range.
* '''0.5''' seconds after the blinking, the Shooting Stars will be fired at the rate of '''0.5''' seconds per star. Therefore, the shooting wave will last '''2''' seconds. Since the ICD of the Shooting Stars is 3s / 7 Hits, it will apply {{Cryo}} to the same target at most once per wave.
* The Curtain of Slumber only start generating Night Stars again once the last Shooting Star has been fired.
* Throughout the shield duration, it is possible to fire 4 waves of Shooting Stars by utilizing [[Dream of the Star-Stream Shaker]]'s Night Star generation and/or multiple characters with multi-input Elemental Skills.
