==Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Burrow:''' Sinks into the ground and emerges nearby.
*'''Ambush:''' If the player interacts with a disguised Pyro Whopperflower, bursts from the ground, dealing '''300% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Pyro DMG}}.
*'''Spin:''' If the player is within melee range, flattens while spinning its petals to deal '''50% ATK * 3''' as {{Color|AoE Pyro DMG}} around itself.
*'''Normal Attack: Homing Orbs:''' Shoots out orbs that home toward the player, each dealing '''33% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} on hit.
*'''Charged Attack: Rapid Fire:''' Closes its petals, consuming one of the "fruits" orbiting around it and creating a {{Pyro}} [[Shields|shield]], giving it ~10 seconds to charge up its attack. If allowed to fully charge, it will launch a volley of about 15 fireballs in rapid succession at the player, each of which deals '''60% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Pyro DMG}}; However, the shield can be broken to prevent its attack and stun the Whopperflower for ~15 seconds.
*'''Recharge:''' Once all three "fruits" are consumed, the Whopperflower will plunge into the ground and restore all three, creating a visual AoE. This will not deal any damage.
