|name_5 = Charged Attack: Roasted Nectar Burst
|desc_5 = Closes its petals, consuming one of the "fruits" orbiting around it and creating a {{Pyro}} [[Shields|shield]], giving it ~10 seconds to charge up its attack. If allowed to fully charge, it will launch a volley of about 15 fireballs in rapid succession at the player, each of which deals '''40% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}; However, the shield can be broken to prevent its attack and stun the Whopperflower for ~15 seconds.
