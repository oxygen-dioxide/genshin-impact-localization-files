|description    = An incredibly common cubic building block found throughout [[Constellation Metropole]], it produces a "ding-dong" ringing sound when hit, earning it the nickname "Ding-Dong Unit."<br>It is said to be different from the basic building blocks in Constellation Metropole, having incredibly complex internal mechanisms that can not only store energy, but also output it (after some simple modifications). However, as it is relatively heavy, it is recommended to only place these units in locations relatively close to the ground for safety and stability.
