===Tutorial===
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Rolling Crossfire 1.png
|text1  = In Rolling Crossfire challenges, you must use the remote-controlled cannon to fire at Slimes. The more Slimes you defeat within the time limit, the higher your test score will be.<br>Large Slimes are harder to defeat, but award more points once felled.
|image2 = Tutorial Rolling Crossfire 2.png
|text2  = The cannon will face along the axis linking your character and the cannon. {{Color|help|You can adjust the turret's aim by moving your character}}.
|image3 = Tutorial Rolling Crossfire 3.png
|text3  = {{Color|help|Press the "Fire" button}} to control the cannon remotely, causing it to {{Color|help|fire the shell currently loaded}} in the direction it is aiming. After firing, the cannon will immediately load one of the three random elemental shell types: {{Color|Electro}}, {{Color|Pyro}}, or {{Color|Cryo}}. {{Color|help|Look at the color of the aiming guide line}} to see which type of shell has been loaded.
|image4 = Tutorial Rolling Crossfire Operation Overload 1.png<!--Images are identical: Tutorial Rolling Crossfire 4.png-->
|text4  = After elemental shells hit different Slimes, they will deal the corresponding Elemental DMG and trigger special effects.<br>Operation Overload: Causes an explosion, sending nearby opponents flying.<br>Frigid Frost: Deals Cryo and Physical DMG over a wide area, decreasing All Elemental RES for opponents in the area.<br>Aggressive Ablation: Greatly enhances this attack, increasing its AoE and dealing additional Physical DMG.<br>Hitting Slimes of the same Elemental Type as the shell will have no effect due to immunity.
|image5 = Tutorial Rolling Crossfire 5.png
|text5  = The turret will charge up over time. Once it has accumulated enough energy, you can {{Color|help|approach the turret}} and consume the energy to fire off a powerful Piercing Shell.<br>The turret can store energy for up to 2 such Piercing Shells.
}}

;Standard Testing Details
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Rolling Crossfire Standard Testing Details 1.png
|text1  = Standard Tests are time-limited challenges. In such tests, Slimes will not move. You can also use special equipment that will appear on the field as you operate the turret to defeat more Slimes.
}}

;Stress Testing Details
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Rolling Crossfire Stress Testing Details 1.png
|text1  = Stress Tests are time-limited challenges. During such tests, Slimes will constantly {{Color|help|move toward a withdrawal line}}. Once a Slime reaches the withdrawal line, it will {{Color|help|immediately retreat and not add to your test score}}.<br>Seize the moment and defeat as many of them as possible before they withdraw!
}}

;Limit Testing Details
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Rolling Crossfire Limit Testing Details 1.png
|text1  = Limit Tests are time-limited tests in which {{Color|help|the remaining test progress will continuously tick down, with the challenge ending once the test progress hits zero}}.<br>Use the turret to defeat slimes, receiving test time rewards and increasing your test progress.<br>After the test begins, the test difficulty will increase at intervals, which will increase both the rate at which test progress declines and the score multiplier for defeating slimes.
}}

;Operation Overload
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Rolling Crossfire Operation Overload 1.png
|text1  = Operation Overload: Causes an explosion that sends nearby opponents {{Color|help|flying}}.<br>Knock Slimes out of bounds from the field to defeat them quickly.
}}

;Frigid Frost
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Rolling Crossfire Frigid Frost 1.png
|text1  = Frigid Frost: Deals {{Color|help|Cryo and Physical DMG}} to opponents in an {{Color|help|AoE}} and {{Color|help|decreases these opponents' All Elemental RES}}.
}}

;Aggressive Ablation
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Rolling Crossfire Aggressive Ablation 1.png
|text1  = Aggressive Ablation: greatly enhances this attack, increasing its AoE and dealing additional {{Color|help|Physical DMG}}.
