==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
Shalmar is [[Banu|Banu's]] father, the writer of  50 Things Every Traveling Scholar Should Know and a [[Spantamad]] researcher. He created the game of looking for [[Future Star]]s to form fun memories for his daughter.  He used Parvo Cores and an Ayesha's Chaos Prospector, old items that the Akademiya intended to get rid of, as materials for a treasure hunting game. He personally buried the cores, renamed them as Future Stars and had his daughter enjoy the  game.<ref name=":0">{{Ref/NPC|Banu}}</ref> As a reward, he gave his daughter a [[Starconch]] and called it the Great Future Star that will allow Banu to listen to the stars.

As an academic, he is very knowledgeable with the [[Ley Line]]s and mechanics, and capable of manipulating mechanisms in [[Sumeru]]. For example, he manipulated an old Ayesha's Chaos Prospector into [[Banu's Wisdom]]. However, as a father, he is incompetent leaving all of the housework and cooking to Banu.<ref name=":0" />
