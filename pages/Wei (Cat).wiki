==Profile==
According to Verr, Wei is a stray cat that "invited itself" to the inn. She and her [[Huai'an|husband]] found it to be cute, so they allowed it to stay and named it using the first name that they thought of. It is apparently rather mischievous, and Verr advises the [[Traveler]] not to "stoop to the same level" as it. [[Tia]] enjoys playing with both it and [[Richie]].<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Tia}}</ref>
