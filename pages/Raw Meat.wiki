'''Raw Meat''' is a [[Cooking Ingredient]] item used in recipes to create [[Food]] items.

==How to Obtain==
Raw Meat is dropped upon death by some of the wild [[Wildlife#Beasts|beasts]] found in [[Teyvat]], such as [[boars]], [[foxes]], [[weasels]], [[squirrel]]s, [[Scorpion]]s, [[Spinocrocodile]]s, [[Rishboland Tiger]]s and [[Sumpter Beast]]s. The amount varies according to the animal's size.

See the [[#Video Guides|Video Guides]] section or the '''[https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=121 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for some specific locations where animals dropping Raw Meat can be found.

Raw Meat can also be obtained by breaking destructible crates, barrels, and pots found all over [[Teyvat]]; opening [[Chests]]; and completing [[Expeditions]] in [[Windrise]], [[Mondstadt]], or [[Musoujin Gorge]], [[Inazuma]].

Additionally, the following NPCs give Raw Meat after following a certain dialogue branch for the first time:
* [[Draff]] in [[Springvale]], [[Mondstadt]] (6 Raw Meat)
