==Trivia==
* The title of this achievement is a reference to the 2009 sci-fi movie {{W|District 9}}, in which the aliens, nicknamed "prawns," are addicted to cat food, at one point trading away their weapons for a few tins. It was parodied in the 2010 strategy simulation game {{W|StarCraft II}} with the cheat code "CatFoodForPrawnGuns" that speeds up construction, which explains the context of the description ("Quickly build a safehouse") and the absence of spacing in the title of the achievement in some languages.
