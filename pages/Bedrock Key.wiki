'''Bedrock Keys''' are a puzzle in [[The Chasm]], [[Liyue]]. They were set up by the [[Liyue Qixing]] on the Chasm Surface to prevent entry to the [[The Chasm/Underground Mines|Underground Mines]]. By destroying the Bedrock Keys using the nearby [[Cage-Shaped Geo Formation]]s, the seal to the Underground Mines will be broken.

All intact Bedrock Keys and their associated components can only be interacted with during the World Quest ''[[Surreptitious Seven-Star Seal Sundering]]'', in which the [[Traveler]] destroys five Bedrock Keys to gain access to the Underground Mines and research the anomaly lying below the surface.

There is a sixth Bedrock Key in the southern part of the Chasm Surface that is already destroyed prior to beginning ''[[The Chasm Charters]]'' and ''Surreptitious Seven-Star Seal Sundering''.

==Huishan Hall Warning Sign==
