'''Gladiator Shackles''' are shackles of varying quality used to [[Weapon Ascension Materials|ascend]] [[Weapons]].

Despite the names, these are just regular shackles any gladiator would wear,<ref name="DG Chains">{{Ref/Item|Chains of the Dandelion Gladiator}}</ref> but due to the fame and significance of [[Vennessa]] the people of [[Mondstadt]] viewed shackles as an enemy of freedom, empowering these plain items through storytelling and exaggeration.<ref name="DG Fetters">{{Ref/Item|Fetters of the Dandelion Gladiator}}</ref>

==Lore==
All gladiators from the time of Vennessa wore shackles.<ref name="DG Chains"/> While later generations elevated the shackles that bound Vennessa to the point of being the enemy of freedom,<ref name="DG Fetters"/> in truth she was not bound by them.<ref name="DG Shackles">{{Ref/Item|Shackles of the Dandelion Gladiator}}</ref> If she wanted she could have broken any physical constraint put upon her because Mondstadt lacked any ore of great quality and didn't have the divine flame from her ancestral home, but what she was truly bound by was the responsibility to her tribespeople.<ref name="DG Shackles"/> While she was freed from her slavery, she ended up being bound to Mondstadt and then to the concept of freedom. She hoped that the world would become stronger.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Dream of the Dandelion Gladiator}}</ref>
