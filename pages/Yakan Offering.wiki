==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* {{lang|''Yakan''|ja=野干|ja_lit=wild jackal}} originally referred to the {{w|Indian jackal}} but became a synonym of {{lang|''{{w|Yako (fox)|yako}}''|ja=野狐|ja_tl=wild fox}}, the lowest ranking fox spirits in the Japanese folklore.
* There are two possible readings for the Japanese name 野狐供真編.
** It could be ''Yako Gu Shinpen'', meaning "Yako Offering: True Edition."
** Alternatively, it could be ''Yako Kushin Hen'', meaning "Book on Yako Kushin." It is a possible reference to {{lang|"Touzan Kushin"|ja=洞山供真}}, the name of a story involving the Chinese Zen monk {{w|Dongshan Liangjie}} (Touzan Ryoukai in Japanese), who founded the school of {{w|Caodong school|Caodong}} ({{w|Sōtō|Soutou}} in Japanese).
*** Having a large temple commonly called {{w|Toyokawa Inari}} as one of its major holy sites, the Soutou school played an important role for the development of the kitsune legends, because the temple is regarded as the most sacred Japanese Buddhist temple that worships {{w|Dakini}} as its primary deity, by whom the kitsune matriarch [[Hakushin]] in the game is likely inspired.
