{{Lang|'''Katsuragi'''|ja=桂木|ja_rm=Katsuragi}} was a historical figure in [[Inazuma]] who lived roughly 500 years ago. He was [[Mikoshi Nagamasa]]'s {{w|yoriki}} who was slain by Nagamasa following a certain incident at [[Tatarasuna]].

Katsuragi's death has been memorialized through the name [[Katsuragikiri Nagamasa]] (Katsuragi-Slashing Nagamasa), an epithet applied to both Nagamasa himself as well as the blade he used to slay Katsuragi.

Katsuragi was Mikoshi Nagamasa's yoriki and presumably held a great a deal of the Inspector's trust. This would come to be his undoing, however, after an incident involving [[Scaramouche]] &mdash; then a nameless, wandering eccentric &mdash; led Katsuragi to break the law. After discovering Katsuragi's misconduct, Nagamasa flew into a rage and fatally wounded him.

===Personality===
Katsuragi is described as a kind-hearted person and quickly grew close to Scaramouche despite the mysteries surrounding the latter's background;<ref name="RAN">Interactable: [[Rather Aged Notes#Dialogue|Rather Aged Notes]]</ref> Scaramouche remembers him as the "kind young deputy."<ref name="Husk">{{Ref/Arti|Plume of Luxury}}</ref> Tragically, his decision to choose his personal judgement over abiding by the letter of the law proved fatal.

==Story==
During the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago, Mikoshi Nagamasa's adoptive mother, [[Mikoshi Chiyo]], went mad from the [[Abyss]]al taint she was exposed to and turned her blade on [[Ei]], only to be defeated and flee to parts unknown. This betrayal left a great stain on the [[Mikoshi Clan]] name, and Nagamasa joined the [[Inazuma Shogunate]] to restore their honor, eventually rising to the rank of Inspector and taking Katsuragi as his yoriki.

Nagamasa and Katsuragi were assigned to [[Tatarasuna]], where they were joined by Armory Officer [[Miyazaki]], [[Kinjiro]], and [[Nozomu]]. Nagamasa developed an interest in weaponsmithing, something that the others in his group believed led to an improvement in his temperament. With the help of Katsuragi and Miyazaki, Nagamasa forged his crowning achievement: a {{w|nagamaki}} they named the Daitatara Nagamasa. Shortly before they completed the blade, Katsuragi met a nameless, wandering young man &mdash; [[Ei]]'s prototype puppet, who would later be known as Scaramouche &mdash; in [[Nazuchi Beach]] and took him back to Tatarasuna. On the completion of the Daitatara Nagamasa, Nozomu was so moved that he made a painting of the blade, while Katsuragi and Scaramouche performed a sword dance.<ref name="RAN" /> At some point after finding him, Katsuragi also warned Scaramouche not to reveal the truth of his identity to anyone else.<ref name="Husk" />

For reasons unknown, the group later searched for Scaramouche, to no avail. It was around this time that Nagamasa learned of Katsuragi's "misconduct." He flew into a rage and cleaved Katsuragi with the Daitatara Nagamasa before throwing the blade into the furnace. Katsuragi presumably died shortly thereafter, while Nozomu, who refused to obey Nagamasa's order, reached into the furnace to grab the melted remains of the blade and later died of his burn wounds. Miyazaki and Kinjiro believed Nagamasa was no longer amenable to reason, and Kinjiro hid both the remains of the blade as well as Nozomu's painting of it in [[the Arsenal]].<ref name="RAN" />

It is unknown whether Scaramouche's revenge against "the bladesmith," which led to the destruction of three schools within the [[Raiden Gokaden]], was related to Katsuragi's death.
