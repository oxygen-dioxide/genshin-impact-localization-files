'''Furina de Fontaine'''<ref name="CD" /><ref name="Apocalypse" /> is a playable {{Hydro}} [[character]] in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' who can alternate between {{Pneuma}} and {{Ousia}} alignments.

Introduced as the flamboyant and overconfident [[Hydro Archon]], Furina's theatrics are eventually revealed to be a public persona, which she later discards in favor of living a relatively humbler life as an actress and artistic consultant.
