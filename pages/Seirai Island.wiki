{{Description|An island where some disaster seems to have occurred. Its center is consumed by an eternal storm.|Version 1.6 Special Program}}
{{Location Intro|{{Lang|'''Seirai Island'''|ja=セイライ{{Rubi|島|じま}}|ja_rm=Seirai-jima}}|description=<p>It is said that the island once experienced a calamity and the center of the island was enveloped by a perpetual thunderstorm. This storm has resulted in the unique geography of the island. Until the [[Seirai Stormchasers]] quest series is completed, the center of the island is constantly afflicted with [[Balethunder]] and [[lightning]] that targets the player. Even after completing the quest series, [[Electro Water]] will still persist at the center of the island, although it can be cleared by a nearby puzzle, which will reveal a large hole in the middle.</p>}}

|Long ago, [[Kanna Kapatcir]] was slain here, while the power of its lingering hatred and regret was suppressed by wards maintained by the [[Asase Shrine]].

|The lake at the base of Amakumo Peak is filled with [[Electro Water]] and the surrounding area is roamed by many [[Ruin Sentinel]]s.

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
*In Japanese, {{Lang|''seirai''|ja={{Rubi|清|せい|籟|らい}}}} is a term that describes the "pure, refreshing sound of wind blowing through trees."<ref name="seirai">Kotobank: [https://kotobank.jp/word/%E6%B8%85%E7%B1%9F-546603 清籟]</ref>
**It should be noted, however, that the Japanese name of the island has "Seirai" written exclusively in katakana; similar to how different areas of [[Tsurumi Island]] are named.
**Assuming that Seirai is a name of {{W|Ainu language|Ainu}} origin like various places in Tsurumi, the name can alternatively be broken down into the Ainu words {{Lang|mini=1|ain=セィ|ain_rm=sey}}, meaning "shell", and {{Lang|mini=1|ain=ラィ|ain_rm=ray}}, meaning "death".
