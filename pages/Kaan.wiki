{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kaan:''' Did you see that move just now? Amazing, right?
:{{DIcon}} You want to learn as well?
::'''Kaan:''' Of course! Don't you want to learn it too? It's just so cool!
::'''Kaan:''' You can find dance competitions at [[Stage Tepetl (Point of Interest)|Stage Tepetl]] every day. I really want to join one when I grow up, so everyone can cheer for me when I win too!
::'''Kaan:''' I'll work hard as I grow! One of these days, I'll grow taller than the stage and stronger than the DJ, and that'll be the day I'll beat everyone on the stage!
::{{DIcon}} Remember to stretch properly before practice.
::'''Kaan:''' I know, I know... That's what my Mom always says too. I'll take care of myself!
::'''Kaan:''' After all, I don't just want to become an excellent dancer &mdash; I want to become a brave and mighty warrior, too!
::'''Kaan:''' Just... Just like [[Kachina]]!
::'''Kaan:''' Ah... Speaking of Kachina, I still haven't practiced the moves she taught me last time...
:{{DIcon}} It was quite amazing indeed.
::'''Kaan:''' Right? I wanna learn too!
