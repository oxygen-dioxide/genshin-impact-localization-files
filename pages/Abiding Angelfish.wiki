|description  = A rare and valuable butterflyfish variant from [[Liyue]]. At present, it can only be found near water bodies around the abodes of the [[adepti]]. Its pale white lines are very striking, and it has greater longevity than other members of the species and is thus regarded to be a lucky fish blessed by the adepti.<br />Most people from Liyue will refuse to eat this fish on principle, given the common respect for the adepti, but some fear no such superstition and claim that eating these fish can help one extend one's years.
