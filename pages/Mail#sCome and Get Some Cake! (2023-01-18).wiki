|text      = This year's birthday finally arrived without a hitch, I've been waiting for a long time! [[Margaret]] and my friends in town baked a birthday cake for me, and even [[Draff|my alcoholic fathe]]r hasn't had a single drop to drink today! Hmm, that's rare.

I will set aside my plans to destroy Mondstadt's wine industry... just for today.

Today, I'm going to show everyone how to make the best specialty drink ever!

The fresh fruit is ready and I set aside a big piece of cake for you. Not everyone gets this kind of treatment! You better come, otherwise I won't forgive you!
