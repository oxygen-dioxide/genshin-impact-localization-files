|description    = This upholstered chair with a luxurious gold frame is a common sight in food establishments like the [[Café Lutece]] in the [[Vasari Passage]]. It is said to be one of [[Fontaine]]'s first chair designs to utilize the concept of "ergonomics." It is specifically designed to alleviate strain on the back and neck, providing the users with a comfortable and relaxing sitting experience. However, it is not as comfortable for [[Melusine]]s as it is for everyone else. Achieving optimal sitting posture for Melusines requires further study of "ergonomics" and designing a chair with adjustable backrest, headrest, and seat height. Developing such a specialized chair can be quite costly...
