===Appearance===
Belinda wears one of the standard uniforms of the Knights of Favonius. The uniform consists of a black long-sleeved shirt, tight-fitting pants under a gray skirt and then white plate armor worn on top. Unlike other Knights, she does not have her knees covered and only has greaves on her legs. The Knights of Favonius crest decorates the breastplate and a sheathed sword hangs from her belt on her right side.
