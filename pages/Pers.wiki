==Story==
There is a legend about a penguin named Pers, the first penguin to learn how to swim. Pers would gaze at the starry night sky, longing to fly. Pers first asked a frigatebird how to fly. He then asked the seagulls and a petrel for help. Then one day, Pers looked into the reflection of the stars reflected in the ocean. He then jumped into the water and realized that he could "fly" by swimming underwater. And thus the other penguins followed Pers' example, learning how to swim and living between the sea and land.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Tales of a Snow-Winged Goose}}</ref>
