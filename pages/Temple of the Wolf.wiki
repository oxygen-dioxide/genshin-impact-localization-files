==Walkthrough==
# Head up the stairs towards the area, which contains some [[Hilichurl]]s and [[Large Pyro Slime]]s.
# Pick between the Hydro, Electro, and Pyro Trials. One doorway will open accordingly.
#*The Hydro Trial always opens the left door, the Electro Trial the middle door, and the Pyro Trial the right door.
# Go up the stairs and defeat all enemies. The enemies will match the chosen elemental trial.
#*There is an Exquisite Chest on the top ledge towards the left-hand side of the room, but you will need a [[Wind Catcher]] or a character that can either create a climbable [[Geo Construct]] or lifts you (such as [[Venti]] and [[Kazuha]]'s Elemental Skills). Alternatively, you can jump to the lower ledge from the back of the [[Door of Resurrection]]. Note that climbing to the lower ledge requires either an adult-height character (such as [[Kaeya]]) or climbing up from the area behind the [[Door of Resurrection]] for a teenage-height character (such as [[Amber]]). Then you can jump to the top ledge by repeatedly jumping on its edge from the lower ledge. There is tiny space on the edge that allows you to jump higher. However it requires some skills to do this.
# After completing the trial, choose your next trial. The options will be the same as the previous mechanisms.
# Go up the stairs and defeat all enemies.
