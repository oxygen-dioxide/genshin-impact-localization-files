'''Cage-Shaped Geo Formations''' are found near the [[Bedrock Key]]s set up by the [[Liyue Qixing]] to prevent entry into [[The Chasm]]. They are activated with [[Geograna]] during ''[[Surreptitious Seven-Star Seal Sundering]]''. Once activated, it can be hit to fire a crystal projectile in the direction of the hit.

The first and last Bedrock Keys that the player destroys each have two nearby Cage-Shaped Geo Formations, while the rest have three nearby. Each Cage-Shaped Geo Formation has a {{Geo}}-colored wisp of light leading to it from its associated Bedrock Key.

All Cage-Shaped Geo Formations can only be interacted with during certain parts of ''Surreptitious Seven-Star Seal Sundering''. Those that cannot be activated yet look crumbled.

==Crystal Projectiles==
If the crystal projectile is fired in the direction of the associated Bedrock Key at the right elevation, the crystal projectile will hit the Bedrock Key and bring it down, and the Cage-Shaped Geo Formation will disappear. It is recommended to go from top to bottom for efficiency, as firing a crystal projectile at the wrong elevation does not do anything.

Not all hits will fire off a crystal projectile. Generally, most melee attacks will work, but projectile attacks and attacks by summoned objects will not.<!-- exact condition: "local" ability, which is explicitly defined for those kinds of attacks and only broadly follows some kind of pattern --> In addition, there is a '''1s''' cooldown before another crystal projectile can be fired.

The crystal projectile can hit players and enemies, applying 2 [[Elemental Gauge Theory|gauge units]] of {{Geo}} but no damage of its own. Due to the application of {{Geo}}, the crystal projectile can also [[Crystallize]]. Additionally, this hit is considered a [[Blunt Attack]] and can [[Shatter]].

In [[Co-Op Mode]], all players can bring Geograna to the Cage-Shaped Geo Formations, but only the host's hits can fire off crystal projectiles.
