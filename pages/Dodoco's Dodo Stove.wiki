To make this dish, you'll have to slice the apples into large pieces and slather two servings of jam onto it..."<br>"Wait. Why roasted?"<br>"Well, that's because everyone in Dodoland is very warm-hearted, and so they love warm food!"<br>"And why do they put jam on the fruits?"<br>"That's because... This way, they can eat something that has different sorts of sweetness outside and inside. The sweeter the better!"<br>...<br>After talking to [[Klee]], who dropped by for a short visit, [[Tubby]] also attempted to make some of these roasted apples.<br>She did wind up singeing some of her feathers as a result, but it was way worth it, because the apples were so good!
