|text    = On the day of a sacred star's descent from the depths of the night sky into this realm, I, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, have asked [[Oz]] to cross the ocean and bring, me exotic treasure.

Forsooth! The reddish petals and the lingering fragrance, as if the twilight is nigh, revealing the last rays of doom in its fiery embers.

Such treasure must be rare to come by in the mundane world!

But I, the Prinzessin, have already seen the world and possess countless treasures. I will bestow upon you this rare flower. Please continue to hold my name in high esteem!
