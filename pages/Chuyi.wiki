'''Chuyi''' is an [[NPC]] located in [[Liyue Harbor]], [[Liyue]]. She is the hostess of the [[Yanshang Teahouse]].

Chuyi appears as a silhouette in [[Tartaglia]]'s character tale video, "Childe- Sigil of Permission",<ref name="childe pv" /> which is set before the Liyue [[Archon Quests]]. While it is implied he killed the guards and the unnamed wealthy merchant, he apparently spared her.

===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Chuyi:''' This is the Yanshang Teahouse.
:'''Chuyi:''' Now that you're here, are you mentally prepared? Did you bring enough money?
:{{DIcon}} It sounds like the tea here must be quite expensive.
::'''Chuyi:''' Who said that a teahouse must only sell tea?
::'''Chuyi:''' Someone stupid like you shouldn't be out making a mess of our city. Your time would be better spent listening to an opera or sitting in a restaurant.
::'''Chuyi:''' There're some places you don't belong, and you're most certainly not needed around here.
::'''Chuyi:''' If you don't leave, I will have to ask security to "escort" you out.
:{{DIcon}} No, thank you. Goodbye.
::'''Chuyi:''' Oh, so you do have some manners...
::'''Chuyi:''' I'll return the courtesy by not calling our security. Good day.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After completing [[Farewell, Archaic Lord]])
:'''Chuyi:''' This is the Yanshang Teahouse.
:'''Chuyi:''' The [[Yelan|new owner]] says that all who approach are guests, so you might as well head up for some tea.
:{{DIcon}} You're under new ownership?
::'''Chuyi:''' The previous owner sold this property due to debt problems.
::'''Chuyi:''' The new owner made some adjustments to how we operate after taking over...
::'''Chuyi:''' ...But not that you'd understand, anyway. Just treat this place like any other "teahouse." Heh.
:{{DIcon}} Not going to "escort" me away?
::'''Chuyi:''' No idea what you're talking about. Of course not.
::'''Chuyi:''' Our new owner also hopes that more people will come to drink tea... As long as they behave, drink tea, and chat, they are welcome here.
