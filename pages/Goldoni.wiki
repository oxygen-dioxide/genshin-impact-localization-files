===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing ''Canticles of Harmony''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Goldoni:''' Those auxilia of barbarian stock are spreading over-wrought rumors about those "[[Lochknight]]s" again.
:'''Goldoni:''' I should suggest to Dominus [[Boethius]] that we stamp these ridiculous ravings out completely.
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Goldoni:''' Hmm? Ah, no need for surprise, citizen. As you see, I am a musician elevated by the Sebastos, yet I am a citizen, just as you are.
::'''Goldoni:''' Marcia Gordiana Semproniana am I, here by the eminent will of Dominus Boethius to take over from my colleague, [[Xavier|Xavierius]], and tune the melodies of this land.
::{{DIcon}} Are you an ascended musician, then?
:::'''Goldoni:''' Indeed, that is so. A flawless body, immortal life, and absolute beauty. Behold, citizen. You look upon the honor bestowed on me by the [[Remus|Sebastos]].
:::'''Goldoni:''' He has caused our bodies to transcend lowly mortality, turning the tragic dirge of death into proud triumph.
:::'''Goldoni:''' It is by this grace that I have the honor of performing the eternal symphony.
:::{{DIcon}} But you look like an ordinary person...
:::'''Goldoni:''' Is that so? Thank you for your praise, citizen. Still, you should direct that adoration to the might and mercy of the Sebastos.
:::'''Goldoni:''' To carve immortal bodies from stone that look no different from ordinary mortals &mdash; who else but he could have achieved this great feat?
::{{DIcon}} About Boethius...
:::'''Goldoni:''' Watch your tone, citizen. Even I do not have the right to address that exalted Dominus solely by his name.
:::'''Goldoni:''' Dominus Boethius is a Harmost, exalted to that post by the Sebastos himself, and is the foremost genius in our empire's history. Even Dominus [[Cassiodor]] cannot...
:::'''Goldoni:''' ...No, forget what I said before. I did not mean to be partisan about our Harmosts.
:::'''Goldoni:''' Regardless, even amongst the empire's outstanding subjects, Dominus Boethius stands tall as the most representative of its spirit.
:::'''Goldoni:''' His loyalty and passion are undoubtedly worthy of our imitation and respect.
::{{DIcon}} About the Xavier you mentioned...
:::'''Goldoni:''' Xavierius, citizen, or Lucius Septimius Sebelius. Not "Xavier." Your pronunciation is most strange.
:::'''Goldoni:''' He was a respectable man, but he put his faith in the wrong thing. Inconceivably, he believed...
:::'''Goldoni:''' No, he twisted Dominus Cassiodor's words, to the point that he did not notice the barbarians' schemes in time.
:::'''Goldoni:''' Just as you have heard, his negligence caused the fall of Petrocorii. Countless citizens were massacred by the barbarians, and the streets were awash with ruin and blood in a single night.
:::'''Goldoni:''' Weakness only brings calamity, and kindness, disaster. Our ignorant slaves may be swayed by well-meaning lies, but our vision should extend further.
:{{DIcon}} About the Lochknights...
::'''Goldoni:''' Fret not about the lies those slaves tell. Their so-called Lochknights are but facetious far-fetched fictions.
::'''Goldoni:''' They spread rumors and call those barbarians who worship a false god "knights," believing that they shall one day free them from their fated duties.
::'''Goldoni:''' I do not condemn such folly, for folly is the way of the lowly. Yet their delusions are fanned ever hotter, such that their melodies are tranquil no longer.
::'''Goldoni:''' They must be cured. Once the disturbances here have subsided, I shall act forcefully to correct such strange skeins of supposition.
::'''Goldoni:''' Delusion and weakness both breed turmoil.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Goldoni:''' Fare well, citizen. May your slaves be meek, and your song serene.

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''Canticles of Harmony''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Goldoni:''' Perhaps we should choose more classical romance for the script this time. The confession of love between Tancrede and Chariclea, perhaps, or the farewell of the Lochknight Drest and Adsiltia...
:'''Goldoni:''' *sigh* If only he could understand my intent...
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Goldoni:''' Hmm? Ah! Sorry, I was just thinking about my script, and I started talking to myself...
::'''Goldoni:''' I'm Goldoni. I suppose you could consider me a playwright. And as for what I just said... It wasn't anything important. Don't worry about it! 
:{{DIcon}} About the script...
::'''Goldoni:''' Aye, it's a script for the next [[Fontinalia Festival|film festival]]. 
::'''Goldoni:''' To be honest, [[Xavier]], the Furina Award-winning producer from the first festival is my... friend. 
::'''Goldoni:''' I agreed to his request to write his next script. 
::'''Goldoni:''' *sigh* If we weren't such long-time acquaintances, I wouldn't have turned down a commission from the [[Opera Epiclese]] to write him a script gratis!
::'''Goldoni:''' And he said he'd pay me... Seriously, who does he take me for...
::'''Goldoni:''' Still, I've only written scripts in the past. It wasn't until I started writing that I realized how different writing for films is. 
::'''Goldoni:''' For example, operas don't usually describe the finer details of a character's movements, but films require you to supply a complete description of the Kamera and visual angles...
::'''Goldoni:''' Whatever the case, this commission is a brand-new challenge. That's why I'm still trying to decide what the best theme might be...
::{{DIcon}} You just said you wanted to write a classic romance story...
:::'''Goldoni:''' *cough* I-Isn't that very normal? After all, romance and love have been a theatrical theme since time immemorial! I didn't mean anything else, really!
:::'''Goldoni:''' As my ancestor... [[Coppelius|Master Coppelius]] once said...!
:::'''Goldoni:''' "There is no absolute good or evil, only absolute beauty and ugliness. And that which makes beauty is eternal love..."
:::'''Goldoni:''' Whether it be the chronicle of Chariclea or the legend of the Lochknights, these are all romantic classics...
:::'''Goldoni:''' Wh-Whatever the case, don't misunderstand, you hear?
:::{{DIcon}} Coppelius?
::::'''Goldoni:''' Yes. Master Coppelius is the greatest playwright in Fontaine's history, and I... am a descendant of his, though my skill is far from comparable to his. 
::::'''Goldoni:''' From "Golden Hyperborea" to "Coppelia" to "Masque of the Great," his works &mdash; one and all &mdash; rank amongst the greats. 
::::'''Goldoni:''' If only I could be so incandescently artful, I... No, nothing, please, pay it no mind! 
:::{{DIcon}} I'm sure the producer will like it. 
::::'''Goldoni:''' Thank you. *sigh* If only he would like more than just scripts...
::::'''Goldoni:''' Uh, I-I mean, if only he... if only this would make him like traditional opera more...
::{{DIcon}} Are you Xavier's friend? 
:::'''Goldoni:''' Y...Yes! A-Also, we grew up together. I've known him since I was three! 
:::'''Goldoni:''' *sigh* If only I knew the first thing about mechanisms. That way, I could've gone with him to [[Inazuma]] without anyone batting an eyelid...
:::'''Goldoni:''' Maybe I'd even be able to join his [[Daydream Club]] and speak with him more...
:::'''Goldoni:''' *cough* I mean, I could write more work that suits his requirements. I mean, the more commissions I do for him, the more perfect the scripts I'll write... right? 
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye. 
::'''Goldoni:''' Farewell. Safe journey!

==Trivia==
* At the start of Dialogue Set #2, the two sets of romances Goldoni mentions are inspired by real-life works and mythological figures:
** The "confession of love between Tancrede and Chariclea" combines characters from different real-life works. Tancrede was popularized in ''{{w|Jerusalem Delivered}}'', in which he has a tragic romance with a warrior-maiden named Clorinda (or Clorinde); several other works have been based on Tancrede and Clorinda's tale. Chariclea comes from ''{{w|Aethiopica|Theagenes and Chariclea}}'', where she has a happy ending with her lover Theagenes after much trial and tribulation.
** The "farewell of the Lochknight Drest and Adsiltia" is a reference to ''{{w|Tristan and Iseult}}''; the name "Tristan" is believed to have come from the Pictish name "Drust," while "Adsiltia," a name of Celtic origins, has been cited as a possible etymology for "Iseult."
*Given the word choice and the context of high praise, Goldoni's statement of "If only I could be so incandescently artful" appears to be a reference to Solaire of Astora from ''{{w|Dark Souls (video game)|Dark Souls}}'', who has the noteworthy quote, "If only I could be so grossly incandescent!"
===Etymology===
* Her name, Goldoni, is a reference to the Venetian playwright {{w|Carlo Goldoni}}.
