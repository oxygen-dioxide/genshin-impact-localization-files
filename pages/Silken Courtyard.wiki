==Trivia==
* The [[water]] in Silken Courtyard has a unique color and wave animation. It cannot be [[Frozen]] or [[Electro-Charged]] using skills. However, it will still cause the [[Wet]] status.
* Silken Courtyard also has a unique day-night cycle with a different sun and moon than the one that appears in the open world of Teyvat.
