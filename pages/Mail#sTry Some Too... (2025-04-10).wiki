|text      = When I got to work today, [[Euphrasie]] placed a box of snacks and a thick press book on my desk.

She said it was a record of every "big scoop" I've reported on since joining [[The Steambird]].

"Scoops that, if published, might be so sensational that you'd be forced to leave The Steambird or even the [[Court of Fontaine]] altogether, Miss Charlotte." Hehe... Well, she wasn't wrong. There were a lot of prickly publications-to-be in that book.

But then again, doesn't this just prove how keen my journalistic instincts are? I'm sure you'd agree! So this year, I'm going to work even harder, and publish even better articles than ever before!

But, ah... hopefully without causing too much trouble for Euphrasie and [[Galanopoulo|my father]].

On a happier note, try some of those snacks Euphrasie gave me. They're super tasty!
