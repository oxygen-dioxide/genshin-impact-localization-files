|description    = A mask from the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]].<br />It has become very brittle with the passing of years and can no longer be worn.<br />Its previous owner once cherished a great many thoughts, blessing all the things she treasured.<br />Today, this mask has inherited her thoughts and blessings. May it ward off some of the lies and evils you shall surely face.
