'''Quest Items''' are items in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' obtained during [[Quests]]. It is the seventh tab in the [[Inventory]].

Most Quest Items are obtained during a quest or found in the open world and are submitted to complete an objective, but others remain in the inventory as memorabilia.

Some Quest Items are considered [[Event Items]] and expire when their corresponding [[Event]] is over.

Some can be '''Read''' in the inventory to view an image or text.
