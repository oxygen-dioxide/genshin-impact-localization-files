|description    = Pure elemental life-forms composed of drifting [[Electro]] particles, as free and unbound as the butterflies they resemble.<br>A glittering Electro creature that is the product of rising and condensing elements, and which feeds off the ubiquitous power of Electro.<br>Perhaps the lightning flashing in the dark night is the entrusted faith of a certain someone... Sometimes, the ignorant animals will follow these lights wherever they go, pacing behind them and scouring the four corners of the Realm Within.
