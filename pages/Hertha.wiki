==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Reputation Level 1–2)
:'''Hertha:''' Well met. What do you need from me?
;(Reputation Level 3)
:'''Hertha:''' Oh, it's you. We've been short-handed again lately... There any chance that you could help out?
;(Reputation Level 7)
:'''Hertha:''' It's been a while. Are you here to help us out with some work?
:'''Hertha:''' ...If only you were an official Knight. We could definitely use more able hands like yours.
:{{DIcon|Reputation}} How's my reputation in Mondstadt?
:;(Opens Mondstadt Reputation menu)
:{{DIcon}} Tell me a little about yourself...
::'''Hertha:''' I am the Captain in charge of the 6th Company, in charge of logistics. You can just call me Hertha.
::'''Hertha:''' My work mostly includes the charter and administration of our baggage train, resource management and record-keeping.
::'''Hertha:''' ...But Mondstadt's state is as you have seen. With the Grand Master having brought much of our manpower with him, we have since been in a constant state of short-handedness.
::'''Hertha: '''At the same time, our inventory is running a surplus to match... So I'm more than willing to exchange some of it for a little hand here and there.
::'''Hertha:''' I'm taking all comers who have experience in solving problems. With any luck, we'll take some of the burden off our [[Jean|Acting Grand Master's]] shoulders.
::'''Hertha:''' But first, you need to earn everyone's trust. So how about starting from a few small errands for the citizenry?
:{{DIcon}} Mm. See you around, then.
::'''Hertha:''' Well, best you get working on your reputation in this city. The road will surely open up to you.
