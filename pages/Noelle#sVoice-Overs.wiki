|vo_05_02_tx         = I'm a bit useless in an argument because I can't really explain my reasoning clearly. People find that hard to understand, so instead, I try to just get on with my work in my own way. But then they call me stubborn.

|vo_07_01_tx         = To be honest, I'm feeling a little dejected. Sure, this Vision proves that the Archons think I'm worthy, but why is it a Geo Vision? I mean, Geo's the furthest thing from Anemo, and for a Knight of Favonius...

|vo_07_02_tx         = I actually really like the smell of wine, I'm just not of drinking age yet. There have been a few times when I could have had a little taste if I'd wanted, and no one would ever have known... but I resisted the temptation. I feel like the first time you try it is probably really magical, so I want to save it till I'm older.

|vo_07_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Interesting Things.ogg
|vo_07_03_tx         = A maid is required to keep everyone's secrets. That's why my favorite flower is the rose. Here in [[Mondstadt]], the rose represents the saying "As wine bottles are corked, so too are my lips sealed." It reminds me to&mdash; What? ...Roses represent love in your hometown? I&mdash;I had no idea the rose held such a... passionate meaning.

|vo_08_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Amber.ogg
|vo_08_01_tx         = I really look up to Amber. Not only is she an accomplished knight, but she's a kind person too. She taught me how to make a [[Baron Bunny]]. I keep it on my person for luck, and it looks quite alright, don't you think?
|vo_08_01_mention    = Amber
|vo_08_01_actual     = I really look up to Amber. Not only is she an accomplished knight, but she's a kind person too. She taught me how to make a Baron Bunny.

|vo_08_02_tx         = I've always been curious as to how she managed to become a fully-fledged knight at such a young age. I actually went to ask her for tips once, but I'd barely started talking to her when she grabbed me by the hand and took me outside the Knights headquarters to play with bombs. I thought it was some kind of training exercise at first, but Jean found us, and we both ended up in a solitary confinement...
|vo_08_02_mention    = Klee,Jean

|vo_08_03_friendship = 4
|vo_08_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Jean.ogg
|vo_08_03_tx         = Master Jean has always been my role model, both in terms of ability and dedication. She holds herself and others to the same high standards, so if there ever comes a day when I meet with her approval, it will be the ultimate acknowledgment of all my efforts so far. Until then, there's no room for complacency!

|vo_08_04_tx         = At first I wanted to join his expedition party and do my part as a maid. But the Grand Master said no &mdash; it would give him more peace of mind if I stayed behind to take care of things in Mondstadt. It made me so happy to hear how much he values me! ...Okay, so apparently he said the same thing to a lot of people. But that doesn't change the fact he prizes me too!
|vo_08_04_mention    = Varka
|vo_08_05_title      = About [[Kaeya]]
|vo_08_05_friendship = 4
|vo_08_05_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Kaeya.ogg
|vo_08_05_tx         = He's a mysterious character! He comes and goes like the wind, and is always occupied with important business. I like the fact that he delegates some of the smaller jobs to me sometimes, it's nice to feel like part of the team, you know... What do you mean, "errand runner"? I don't see it like that at all! Okay, well yes, technically I run errands for him. But still, I really appreciate it!
|vo_08_05_mention    = Kaeya
|vo_08_06_title      = About [[Bennett]]
|vo_08_06_friendship = 4
|vo_08_06_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Bennett.ogg
|vo_08_06_tx         = He's asked me to join the Adventurers' Guild more than a few times, saying that life there would suit me better than with the Knights of Favonius. While I could help him take care of his "dads" like the other adventurers. the Knights hold a special meaning for me, and I'm not ready to give up on becoming one yet. No, I simply cannot accept his offer.
|vo_08_06_mention    = Bennett

|vo_08_07_tx         = I think she's from another world, but I don't know the details. One thing I do know, however, is that she loves the Knights of Favonius' library. She can always be found there with her nose in a book. I bring her some refreshments whenever I go in there to clean, and she always thanks me profusely. When I say profusely, I mean she goes a bit over the top, to be honest, and... I actually don't understand half of what she's saying.
|vo_08_07_mention    = Fischl
|vo_08_08_title      = About [[Fischl]]: Background

|vo_08_08_tx         = So once when I was cleaning the library, I noticed a book on the shelf called Flowers for Princess Fischl. At the time I assumed it was just a fantasy novel... I was so surprised to find out the main character is a real person. I could hardly believe it! She must be someone incredible to have a whole book dedicated to her.
|vo_08_08_mention    = Fischl

|vo_08_09_friendship = 4
|vo_08_09_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Barbara.ogg
|vo_08_09_tx         = We take tea breaks together sometimes. Often she'll start humming a tune, saying inspiration has come to her. I'm not the right person to give useful feedback on anything musical... But I still love spending time with [[Barbara]].

|vo_09_02_tx         = Not a problem, I am here to serve in whatever capacity you require. You needn't be concerned about the way I feel. ...Huh? More tool than maid? I disagree! A tool might help you to complete a million tasks to a satisfactory standard, but it feels nothing. I, on the other hand, feel a strong sense of achievement every time I do something for you.

|vo_09_04_friendship = 5
|vo_09_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} More About {character} - 04.ogg
|vo_09_04_tx         = I spend all my days handling the most trivial of matters, but so long as it helps you in your adventure, or makes your life easier in some small way, I couldn't be happier. That's because each time I get a thank-you, it makes me feel like my work at least has some meaning, no matter how insignificant it seems.

I won't be doing that again though. I was on the road for so long that Jean was convinced I'd been gobbled up by Stormterror along the way!
