==Profile==
Schubert, like many other Lawrence Clan nobles, is very haughty, arrogant and self-centered. He believes that the present-day Mondstadt is in utter shambles as a result of not being supervised by nobles. He dislikes people who do not treat him with the proper respect he feels that he deserves, but is willing to give them a second chance. His massive ego makes him extremely naïve, as being appreciated by others gives him a sense of satisfaction and greatly lowers his guard.

Despite his incompetence, Schubert is one of the more brazen clan nobles, having secretly plotted with the [[Fatui]] to return the clan to its former glory regardless of the potential civilian casualties. Eula notes this as disgusting, but surprising since she knew the other clan nobles as complainers who took little to no action.

Similar to the rest of the Lawrence Clan, he does not get along well with his niece Eula and considers her to be a traitor. He expresses an open dislike of the Fatui, stating that they are ruffians who openly flaunt their power, but admits that they are favorable business partners.

===Appearance===
He has brown hair and wears glasses and a blue shirt.

==Trivia==
*In Chinese, Eula uses the term {{zh|叔父|rm=shū fù}} to address her uncle. That means Schubert must be a younger brother of Eula's father.
*Schubert may be named after {{W|Franz Schubert}}, an Austrian Composer of the late {{W|Classical period (music)|Classical}} and early {{W|Romantic music|Romantic}} eras.
