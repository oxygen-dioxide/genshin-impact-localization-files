|[[File:Fragmented Memories Puzzle 1.png|100px]]<br>I. Light and Darkness Under the Spotlight
|The essence of magic is getting people to believe a lie that hides behind light and darkness. The audience have taken their seats, so let us enjoy it all, right until the final curtain call.<hr />When you're on the stage, you're first and foremost actors. Good actors hone their craft to mesmerize the whole crowd.

|"Father" is a strict but loving figure in the eyes of the children, but to Furina, "Father" is a figure who strikes fear in the deepest parts of her soul. "The Knave? Wh—Who's that? Oh... Uh, I'd already forgotten about her... Keeping such a terrible figure like her in your mind will only give you nightmares," Furina stammered.<hr />Anything left unguarded is usually just bait. But no one will blame someone for taking the bait. After all, from the moment it was attached to the hook, the bait is meant to be sacrificed.

|No matter how cruel or terrible the world may be, at least, you can have a good night's sleep by the hearth.<hr />I hear that the children love to play by the fireplace. So let us continue to use the name, "House of the Hearth."
