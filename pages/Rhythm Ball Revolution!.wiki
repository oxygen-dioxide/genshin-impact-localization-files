{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Upon receiving the quest)
:{{A|vo dyfk001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon''': Oh, what a surprise! A letter from Mualani!
:{{A|vo dyfk001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon''': It says... the People of the Springs are hosting a... music festival?
:{{A|vo dyfk001 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon''': Well, that sounds fun! Let's go check it out!

;(Talk to [[Rhythmos]], optional)
:'''{{Traveler}}''': (Looks like the DJ is immersed in the music. Let's go ask Mualani and the others about the situation first...)

;(Approach Mizuki, Mualani, and Xilonen)
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hey!
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Our guests of honor are here! Now we can really get this party started!
:{{Introductory Note|Mualani}}
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Mualani! Oh, and [[Xilonen]]'s here too!
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And... [[Mizuki]]? You're back from [[Inazuma]] already!
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 mizuki 01.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' That's right! My friends in [[Natlan]] are like family to me. I like to think of the People of the Springs as my home away from home.
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 mizuki 02.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' If I want to help people here, I definitely can't neglect the Natlan branch of my practice.
:{{Introductory Note|Yumemizuki Mizuki}}
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Miss Mizuki's work ethic is impeccable.
:{{Introductory Note|Xilonen}}
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' She puts the rest of us service-providers to shame...
:{{DIcon}} Wait, so... Are you one of her clients, too?
:{{DIcon}} Or could it be... that you've worked together before?
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Well, I've had some weird dreams lately... Like, a client expediting a commission from a four-week time-frame to just one.
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Or, like a rush order for some kind of spherical accessory with an element of danger to it...
:{{DIcon}} I know this one. [[Slime]]s and [[Fungus|Fungi]].
:{{DIcon}} Are you talking about [[Specter]]s and [[Ball Octopus]]es?
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, you made that connection pretty fast, Traveler. Almost as if you're the one sending Xilonen weird commissions through her dreams...
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Huh, are those creatures... dangerous?
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 xilonen 06.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Anyway, the expedited time frame isn't even the hardest part. Spherical designs are tricky, and when you rush it, you end up with something that isn't even good.
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 xilonen 07.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Point being, I've been having nothing but those kinds of dreams. So, I wrapped up all my orders and decided to visit Miss Mizuki for help...
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 xilonen 08.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' And, it worked like a charm! When I took a nap that afternoon, all the weird dreams were gone!
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 mizuki 03.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' It was my pleasure to help, Miss Xilonen.
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 mizuki 04.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Although, I'm not sure how much credit I can really take for the disappearance of those dreams...
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' In any case, everyone's feeling good and well-rested now! Which means, it's party time!
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' A party on the water, to be exact! It's a tradition in my tribe, and we're gonna have a blast!
:{{DIcon}} A party on the water, huh...
:{{DIcon}} Sounds fun.
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! Let's party!
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Although, what does that involve, exactly? Obviously, delicious food and drinks are a given...
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, how do people in Natlan like to party?
:{{DIcon}} High-speed surfing with a [[Koholasaur]]?
:{{DIcon}} Skydiving from the back of a [[Qucusaur]]?
:{{DIcon}} Rope-less bungee jumping with a [[Yumkasaur]]... Tried that one, actually.
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait... Are you being serious?
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Oho, do I spy a fellow extreme sports enthusiast!? To tell you the truth, those activities were where my mind first went to as well!
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' But, according to Chief [[Amina]]... *ahem*... "Not everyone likes high-adrenaline activities!"
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' "Even beach volleyball can be dangerous. It's all fun and games until you spike the ball straight into your friend!"
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' "This event is supposed to be fun, not something that scars people and creates even more work for Miss Mizuki in the process!"
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 mizuki 05.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Well, she does have a point. I'm always happy to help, but I'd rather not have a hand in creating my own patients' trauma. It's better if no one gets hurt.
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Mhm-hmm, which is why I came to you for advice!
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, what's the plan?
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 mizuki 06.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Well, not everyone has a background in extreme sports, and we don't want that to deter people from participating in this event.
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 mizuki 07.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' As we were chatting, I happened to mention the [[Mikawa Flower Festival]] and its more laid-back approach to games, and Miss Mualani really latched onto that idea.
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 mizuki 08.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' So, we decided to give [[Akitsu Haneasobi]] a distinctive Natlanese twist! The result is "Rhythm Ball" &mdash; a relaxing game that doesn't sacrifice on fun.
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' An Inazuman game... with a Natlanese twist! What a cool idea!
:{{DIcon}} There's the [[Children of Echoes]]' Dance-Off Stage.
:{{DIcon}} I can really feel the beat of the music.
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 xilonen 09.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Wow, and you haven't even heard the band at full volume! You must have a good sense of rhythm...
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 xilonen 10.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Which, as you can imagine, is perfect for "Rhythm Ball." The goal is to smash all the blocks by hitting the balls to the beat of the music.
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 xilonen 11.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' No complex techniques, no safety issues, just instinct. It's a game everyone can enjoy.
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 xilonen 12.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Oh, of course, with your skill, you could even add extra layers to the music, or bring out a new sense of rhythm.
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 xilonen 13.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' After all, different DJs can give the same song a whole new feel. And, in a game that involves beats, the player can showcase that same creativity!
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 xilonen 14.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Who knows... In your hands, the background track could go from an easy-listening, chill-out piece to something with a trance or artcore twist!
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 xilonen 15.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I can't wait to see what you come up with.
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh-huh, yeah, whatever you say... Well, sounds like something you can do, right, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, music and games! Right up my alley!
:{{DIcon}} Sure! I'll give it my best shot!
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yes! That's the spirit! As long as you and Paimon can play your hearts out, it's mission accomplished!
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 mualani 11.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Oh, and I'll grab some snacks and drinks for the rest of us while we watch!
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 mizuki 09.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Just remember to pace yourself, okay, Traveler?
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 mizuki 10.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' I'm sure you don't want an endless loop of Dance-Off Stage music stuck in your head before bed tonight.
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, thanks, everyone! This sounds like a blast!
:{{A|vo dyfk001 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Plus, if Xilonen's the one DJ-ing, an endless loop of music in our dreams... doesn't sound too bad!

==Post-Quest Dialogue==
After completing this quest, Mualani, Xilonen and Yumemizuki Mizuki can be found in the open world.

===Mualani===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Mualani)
:'''Mualani:''' Yo, {{Traveler}}, don't you look full of energy!
:{{DIcon}} What kind of songs do you like, Mualani?
::'''Mualani:''' Me? I'm fine with pretty much anything!
::'''Mualani:''' Relaxing melodies, heart-pumping beats, jaunty tunes &mdash; I love 'em all!
::'''Mualani:''' Ah, but I'm not great at rocking out to music that's a bit more solemn and formal... I don't listen to such songs often, but I don't dislike them, either!
:{{DIcon}} Do you have any advice for the game?
::'''Mualani:''' Hmm, let me jog the ol' noggin...
::'''Mualani:''' Based on my experience playing beach volleyball, I think it's easy to slip up if you get anxious.
::'''Mualani:''' Sometimes, when I see the ball flying at me, I freeze up thinking of all the ways I can hit it back!
::'''Mualani:''' So don't sweat the small stuff. Just go with the flow, y'know?
::{{DIcon}} Makes sense. I'll give it a try!
::'''Mualani:''' Of course, you can't rely solely on your intuition for contests of strategy, or when things get serious. You gotta look before you leap, too!
::'''Mualani:''' Everything in moderation!
:{{DIcon}} Great game. I wanna go again!
::'''Mualani:''' Look at you go! With your skills and a little more practice, you'll set some unbeatable records in no time &mdash; I know it!

===Xilonen===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Xilonen)
:'''Xilonen:''' Looking good, {{Traveler}}! You're well on your way to becoming an improv master, I'd say.
:{{DIcon}} Do you have any tips, Xilonen?
::'''Xilonen:''' Do I ever. Seems like you're interested in the nitty-gritty of DJ-ing, huh?
::'''Xilonen:''' Well, then. First up, a good DJ knows their equipment.
::'''Xilonen:''' I've collected a number of schematics from making lots of music equipment in the past. Feel free to pick 'em up next time you swing by.
::'''Xilonen:''' Learning theory's always the blandest part of picking up new music techniques. But once you nail the basics, you'll improve by leaps and bounds.
::'''Xilonen:''' I'm expecting great things from you, alright?
:{{DIcon}} Xilonen, what style of music's your favorite?
::'''Xilonen:''' My favorite style...? Hmm, hard to say.
::'''Xilonen:''' Way I see it, the overall production quality of a song's the most important...
::'''Xilonen:''' The melody's flow, the arrangement of the piece, the instruments chosen, the recording quality, and overall processing... They've all got standards to meet.
::'''Xilonen:''' Mainstream styles sometimes produce pieces with exceptional musicality. Conversely, seemingly sophisticated niche styles might churn out less-than-ideal work.
::'''Xilonen:''' And fooling your audience with a sloppy piece of music by simply slapping a "niche" label on seems... I don't know, rather base?
::{{DIcon}} Yeah, you can't just fake it and hope to make it.
::{{DIcon}} Maybe it's best to ignore the labels...
::'''Xilonen:''' In short, there are no shortcuts when it comes to learning music theory, {{Traveler}}.
::'''Xilonen:''' The basics are the most important. I'm sure you'll study hard, though.
:{{DIcon}} I'll keep looking for inspiration, then.
::'''Xilonen:''' If you've got any good ideas, feel free to just hum 'em for me. I'll jot them down.

===Yumemizuki Mizuki===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Yumemizuki Mizuki)
:'''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Mmm... I can feel the warmth of your emotions from how much you enjoyed the game. Heehee. I'm sure you'll have sweet, relaxing dreams tonight.
:{{DIcon}} Do you also listen to fast-paced music, Mizuki?
::'''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' That's a... classic line of questioning.
::'''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Well, I'll listen to whatever my friends recommend, even if it's not to my tastes. I wouldn't want to let them down, after all.
::'''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' I can enjoy lively music, but I prefer soothing, elegant tunes. I can't say I particularly care for instrumental variety or technical sophistication.
::'''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' As long as the melody is pleasing to the ears, even if it's a cappella or a slow solo, they won't feel bland to me. Rather, I find they exude a sense of beautiful serenity.
::{{DIcon}} Same here.
:::'''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Well... next time you find yourself a free moment, how about I show you some of my favorites? I can brew some tea, prepare some snacks... And we can take our time enjoying them.
::{{DIcon}} Maybe give some new styles a chance?
:::'''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Why not? With your tastes, I'm sure you can show me some hidden gems outside of my usual wheelhouse. If you've got a free moment, don't be shy, okay?
:{{DIcon}} I want to see you give the game a try.
::'''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' I sure could... but that might be flouting the rules.
::'''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' As one of the designers, I know the ins and outs of every stage. It might be a little boring for you to watch.
::'''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Games work best with the element of surprise, and designers should think outside the box to create that. Becoming predictable is the mark of bad development.
::'''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Of course, drawing outside the box is your field of expertise.
::'''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' I do hope you can take part in game development and planning in the future. I'd love to play something you designed~
:{{DIcon}} Hope you rest well too, Mizuki.
::'''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Don't worry. Inviting you here makes this event a success in my book. I'm sure my sleep tonight will be thrice as restful as usual~
