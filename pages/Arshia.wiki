==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Arshia:''' My shopping went pretty well this time. I've almost bought everything I need.
:{{DIcon}} What are you buying?
::'''Arshia:''' Nothing special, just some daily necessities.
::'''Arshia:''' I live in [[Aaru Village]] near the desert. It does have a sufficient supply of underground water, but other supplies are not that sufficient, so I regularly travel to Caravan Ribat to purchase daily necessities.
::'''Arshia:''' This place is close to the desert and packed with merchants, so it's convenient to buy just about anything here.
::{{DIcon}} About Aaru Village...
::'''Arshia:''' If you head toward the western desert from Caravan Ribat, you should pass by Aaru Village if you don't stray too far from the path.
::'''Arshia:''' Life there is simple, and bound by some traditional rules and regulations, but I'm really fond of the unique comforts of a small village that it presents.
::'''Arshia:''' Everyone in the village is very friendly. It doesn't matter if you're a lost adventurer or an exiled researcher, we're willing to take you in all the same.
::'''Arshia:''' ...Of course, you must have no malice toward the village. Otherwise, prepare to face the wrath of [[Candace]].
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Arshia:''' See you.
