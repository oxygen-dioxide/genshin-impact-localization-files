==Profile==
Kiara entered Fontaine along with [[Neuvillette]] and [[Carole]] around 400 years ago. She was not aware of Carole's self-sacrifice.<ref name='aft'>{{Ref/Quest|A Familiar Threat}}</ref>

Kiara would join the [[Marechaussee Phantom]], where she helped solve a smuggling case involving [[Domenico]]. Domenico, wanting revenge, decided to send a threat letter to Kiara by proxy via [[Esseim]] after his attempt to incite a riot in the [[Fortress of Meropide]] failed. Neuvillette caught wind of the threat and not wanting a repeat of Carole's tragedy, decided to investigate the matter himself and discovered the truth of the matter, though everyone would soon be aware of the letter and volunteered to protect her.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|In a New Light}}</ref>

In her spare time, Kiara volunteered to model [[Eloffe]]'s clothes for children from [[Chioriya Boutique]].<ref name='aft' />

[[Clorinde]] eventually had Kiara moved to the [[Palais Mermonia]] for her own safety, worried that she would be scared by the amount of people willing to protect her. She fell asleep and encountered Carole in her dream, who was delighted to see their dreams become true, though she had forgotten what it was.
