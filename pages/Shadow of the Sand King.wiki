{{Description|This gold-inlaid headband was once used by desert priests in the days of old. They were made in imitation of one worn by a [[King Deshret|legendary ruler]] of the desert peoples.}}
'''Shadow of the Sand King''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Gilded Dreams]].

==Description==
"The ruler shall come with light that blazes like the sun,"<br>
"And will take from the people the crown woven from rose thorns."<br>
The first [[Celestial Nail|divine pillar]] descended from the skies, burying [[Ay-Khanoum|tree and meadow]] under [[Desert of Hadramaveth|the flowing sands]].<br>
The golden sun fell, then rose again, clothing the sea of sand in an opulent death-shroud.

Later, the venomous [[Istaroth|winds of time]] disturbed the slumber of [[King Deshret|the fallen]], attracting nostalgic delusions.<br>
In that accursed time, many cities thrived atop fertile oases.<br>
Following the ideals of their God King, the priests would rule the utopias justly, spreading abundance everywhere.<br>
Once, the wise mortal king and the clergy received divine oracles personally, and they were the masters of the land.<br>
Today, those who rule as proxies in the oases are the shadows of the gods.

"The [[Key of Khaj-Nisut|royal regalia]] and [[Staff of the Scarlet Sands|divine scepters]] are scattered across the land like jujubes,"<br>
"And under the shade, the subjects could live and seek."

Some time later, absurd decisions would be issued alongside illusory madness,<br>
Using lovely expectations as bait to lead the people towards [[Aaru's Shut|a bitter end]].
