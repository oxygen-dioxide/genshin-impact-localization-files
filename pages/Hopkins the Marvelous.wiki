<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->
Hopkins the Marvelous is a merchant in Springvale who collects the spring water at night and sells them as Holy Water in the day. He claims to be sent by the [[Spring Fairy]] as a mediator to perform miracles.<ref>NPC Dialogue: Hopkins the Marvelous' (Daytime)</ref>

When [[Rifthounds]] attacked Springvale, he fortunately escaped without harm but bore grudge against wolves.<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Thundercraven Rifthound}}</ref> [[Amber]], [[Paimon]] and the [[Traveler]] arrived and investigated the area and found out that the wolves came from [[Wolvendom]]. Ignoring Amber's assurance that the [[Knights of Favonius]] will handle the issue, he and his friends formed a hunting party to take care of the wolves. They arrive at Wolvendom to find the Traveler and his friends helping [[Razor]] and he immediately concludes that the attacks were ordered by Razor. The commotion that they brought to the area awakened [[Andrius]] and attacked the humans.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Meaning of Lupical}}</ref>

===Personality===
Hopkins seems to be an arrogant and vengeful person.  He insults [[Amber]] when she warned him not to act on his own.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Ravaged by Wolves}}</ref> He also accuses [[Razor]] as the leader and perpetrator of the wolf attacks in Drunkard Gorge and Springvale.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Fate's Chosen Lupical}}</ref>

==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Hopkins the Marvelous:''' Traveler, do you ever find yourself frustrated because of your lack of strength? Have you wondered what it would be like to have power beyond your wildest dreams?
:{{DIcon|Shop}} How do I become more powerful?
::'''Hopkins the Marvelous:''' See this holy water I have here? Drink just one bottle, and you'll feel rejuvenated and more powerful than you could've ever imagined, guaranteed! It might take a while for the effects to kick in though...
:{{DIcon}} And you are...?
::'''Hopkins the Marvelous:''' Who am I? I am the one who the God of the Spring has put here specially to make miracles happen for people just like you!
::'''Hopkins the Marvelous:''' You can call me Hopkins the Marvelous.
:{{DIcon}} How do I get this power...?
::'''Hopkins the Marvelous:''' Just drink this bottle of holy water and the God of the Spring will reveal divine mysteries to you!
::'''Hopkins the Marvelous:''' Who knows, with any luck you might even get a [[Vision]]!
::'''Hopkins the Marvelous:''' And how could you not want a Vision? Just three hundred Mora for a bottle...
::{{DIcon}} Sorry for bothering you.
:::'''Hopkins the Marvelous:''' Three hundred Mora's a bargain! Wait, don't go! Waaait!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Three hundred Mora...
:::'''Hopkins the Marvelous:''' Huh; you find that expensive?
:::'''Hopkins the Marvelous:''' H&mdash;How about this, then. If you purchase this holy water I have here, it'll come with an extra mystical chalice!
:::'''Hopkins the Marvelous:''' Drinking the holy water through this chalice increases its effects greatly!
:::'''Hopkins the Marvelous:''' So buy it, buy it now!
::;(Obtain 1{{star}} [[Lucky Dog's Goblet]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Hopkins the Marvelous:''' This is the opportunity of a lifetime &mdash;a thousand lifetimes, even! You're just going to walk away from it? Seriously, listen...

===Nighttime===
:'''Hopkins the Marvelous:''' AAAAAARGH!!! *heavy breathing*... That&mdash; that was terrifying!
:{{DIcon}} What are you up to?
::'''Hopkins the Marvelous:''' Oh, um... I... I was having an epiphany from the God of the Spring!
::'''Hopkins the Marvelous:''' Now is Hopkins the Marvelous' special time where I bask in the presence of the God of the Spring. So move along!
:{{DIcon}} You're just drinking normal spring water...
::'''Hopkins the Marvelous:''' What? Nonsense! Hogwash! Claptrap!
::'''Hopkins the Marvelous:''' You see only the physical form. After passing through the hands of Hopkins the Marvelous, it is normal no more!
::'''Hopkins the Marvelous:''' If you don't believe me, buy this bottle and see for yourself!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Hopkins the Marvelous:''' Okay... But you must never tell anyone about the things you saw here today... Or you'll incite the wrath of the God of the Spring!
::'''Hopkins the Marvelous:''' ...And um... also, how about if you don't tell anyone I'll give you a discount next time you're here?

==Trivia==
*The God of the Spring Hopkins refers to is based on the legend of the [[Spring Fairy]]. While she really does exist, it is very unlikely that she blessed Hopkins, given that [[Diona]] received her blessing because of her genuine faith in her as a child.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Diona|5}}.</ref>
