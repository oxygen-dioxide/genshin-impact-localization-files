==Profile==
<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->
Hopkins the Marvelous is a merchant in Springvale who collects the spring water at night and sells them as Holy Water in the day. He claims to be sent by the [[Spring Fairy]] as a mediator to perform miracles.

When [[Rifthounds]] attacked Springvale, he fortunately escaped without harm but bore grudge against wolves.<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Thundercraven Rifthound}}</ref> [[Amber]], [[Paimon]] and the [[Traveler]] arrived and investigated the area and found out that the wolves came from [[Wolvendom]]. Ignoring Amber's assurance that the [[Knights of Favonius]] will handle the issue, he and his friends formed a hunting party to take care of the wolves. They arrive at Wolvendom to find the Traveler and his friends helping [[Razor]] and he immediately concludes that the attacks were ordered by Razor. The commotion that they brought to the area awakened [[Boreas]] and attacked the humans.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Fate's Chosen Lupical}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*The God of the Spring Hopkins refers to is based on the legend of the [[Spring Fairy]]. While she really does exist, it is very unlikely that she blessed Hopkins, given that [[Diona]] received her blessing because of her genuine faith in her as a child.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Diona|5}}</ref>
