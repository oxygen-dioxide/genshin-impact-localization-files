==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''You Jun:''' Shh! Shh! (She's/He's) here! The blond-haired Traveler! Indeed, it is just as Master [[Taliesin]] sang of.
:{{DIcon}} You talk like a bard.
::'''You Jun:''' "Like" nothing! I shall soon be a bard, for sooth!
::'''You Jun:''' Thanks to you, this place no longer requires the services of so many [[Millelith]].
::'''You Jun:''' I should have been transferred back to [[Liyue Harbor]], but I've found what I want to do.
::'''You Jun:''' And what is that, you ask? Why, it is to follow Master Taliesin and cause songs and ballads to resound on the winds throughout Liyue.
:{{DIcon}} Master Taliesin?
::'''You Jun:''' That's right. His "old school epic poetry" really moved me. As such, I've decided to become his very first disciple here in Liyue. I feel like I should also write an epic for [[Rex Lapis]].
::{{DIcon}} Heh, that was awkward.
::'''You Jun:''' That's what I think too... Still, I'll work hard under Master Taliesin!
:{{DIcon}} See you then, raven-haired You Jun.
::'''You Jun:''' Indeed. Farewell, gold-haired Traveler.
