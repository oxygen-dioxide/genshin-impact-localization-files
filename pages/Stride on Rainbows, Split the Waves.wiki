{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Interact with the Shiny Shell, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, what a pretty shell! Why's it on this platform anyway?
:'''Rongo:''' Why, hey there, {{MC|m=kane|f=wahine}}. Impeccable timing! You got a moment?
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, someone's here! Well, {{Traveler}}, guess we should hear what he has to say...?
----
;(Talk to Rongo)
;(If the player interacted with the Shiny Shell)
::'''Rongo:''' Haha, that's right! You're outlanders from far abroad, yes? I just happened to see you go by, and I've got something I'd like your opinion on.
;(If the player did not interact with the Shiny Shell)
::'''Rongo:''' Hey there, {{MC|m=kane|f=wahine}}. Impeccable timing!
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm? You talking to us?
::'''Rongo:''' That's right! You're outlanders from far abroad, yes? I've got something I'd like your opinion on.
:'''Rongo:''' From the perspective of a guest, have you ever thought that the life the [[People of the Springs]] lead is too laid-back?
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, what do you mean by that?
:'''Rongo:''' Well, something you should know is that our ancestors were warriors famed throughout the lands. [[Uenuku]] the Treader of the Rainbow, [[Tupac]] the Giant... Renowned heroes all!
:'''Rongo:''' But nowadays? Mention "the People of the Springs," and people assume you're talking about "hot springs"!
:{{DIcon}} Is that such a bad thing?
::'''Rongo:''' Hardly, no, but all this easy living will see our fighting spirit vanish in time, mark my words!
:{{DIcon}} Well, people also think about music...
::'''Paimon:''' And about delicious fruit juice...
::'''Rongo:''' That's all the same to me! This easy living will see our fighting spirit vanish in time &mdash; mark my words!
:'''Rongo:''' This can't go on! That's why I told lil' [[Amina]] that we've gotta build a training ground &mdash; to stoke that spirit once more!
:'''Paimon:''' So, what did she say?
:'''Rongo:''' "I don't get what you're saying at all, but if it's interesting, we'll go along with it."
:'''Rongo:''' So, this is it! The Great Training Arena of the People of the Springs!
:{{DIcon}} "Great," you say...?
:{{DIcon}} It's a bunch of wooden racks...
:'''Rongo:''' Haha, and that's where you're underestimating the genius behind this design, {{MC|m=kane|f=wahine}}! Did you think these were just simple wooden racks?
:{{DIcon}} And what are they, if not that?
::'''Rongo:''' Well! These racks are used in surfing training, which makes them far from ordinary!
:{{DIcon}} S&mdash;So you mean...
::'''Paimon:''' Wait, so if you adjust those racks to the correct positions, the water will part to reveal the real training grounds beneath &mdash; a grand hall several hundred meters deep... or something like that?
::'''Rongo:''' Hahaha. What sort of imagination have you got? Do I look like I have the time to dig so deep a hole and block it off with some simplistic mechanisms? Does anyone?
::'''Rongo:''' Anyway! These racks are used in surfing training. That's what makes them extraordinary!
:'''Paimon:''' So they were racks, after all!
:'''Paimon:''' And speaking of which, doesn't that make your "training" surfing practice? How's that got anything to do with "fighting spirit"?
:'''Rongo:''' That's where you're rating surfing too low! "Winning hearts is as hard as conquering the tides" &mdash; bet you're remembering that famous quote from the great hero Uenuku right about now!
:'''Paimon:''' Hold your horses right there, man! Never mind if you made that quote up or not. Forget "fighting spirit" &mdash; is this even all that related to "surfing"?
:'''Rongo:''' Ah, do the details matter? We hone our surfing skills to sharpen our wills &mdash; that's a longstanding tribal tradition, and not to be abandoned!
:'''Rongo:''' And now that we're here, my good outlander guests, wanna try out some surfing training sometime soon?
:'''Paimon:''' Why not now?
:'''Rongo:''' Because this training ground isn't ready for use yet. And if you must know why, {{MC|m=kane|f=wahine}}... You've seen those Flowcurrent Birds, aye?
:'''Rongo:''' They've got thick skin and sturdy flesh, and don't get hurt even if you boop them into the air. On the flip side, if new hands get booped into the water by them too often, they might lose interest in surfing altogether.
:{{DIcon}} Well, sure...
:{{DIcon}} Couldn't you consider this a special feature of this training ground?
::'''Rongo:''' Haha, that's a great idea, really! Let me think. For example, if we could lure one of those big, fierce Flowcurrent Birds to the first rack, it could knock a newbie back to the starting point in one hit...
::'''Rongo:''' While veterans who have mastered surfing would know how to get around it or use their strength to knock said birds into the air. Haha, yes! The cruelty of surfing made manifest!
::'''Rongo:''' Still, lil' Amina would like this site to be open to a larger audience... So I'll save your suggestion for when we design a second one!
::'''Paimon:''' Uh, that sounds kinda dangerous. You sure this is a good idea?
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, we just need to chase those Flowcurrent Birds away, right? That way, this training ground can operate normally.
:'''Rongo:''' Haha, aye, that'd be great, {{MC|m=kane|f=wahine}}! Let's see, what should we do for someone who's helping to set up our Great Training Arena of the Springs... Ah, got it!
:'''Rongo:''' Here. You can have this!
;(If the player interacted with the Shiny Shell)
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, that was the shell we saw earlier!
;(If the player did interact with the Shiny Shell)
::'''Paimon:''' Ooh, it's so pretty!
:'''Paimon:''' Alrighty then, {{Traveler}}. Let's help get these birds outta the way!

;(After clearing the birds)
:'''Rongo:''' Ho there! Have you driven all those Flowcurrent Birds off?
:'''Rongo:''' Haha, awesome! Good job, {{MC|m=kane|f=wahine}}! That squares our basic prep away &mdash; now, we can start testing our Great Training Arena!
:'''Rongo:''' Well, are you ready?
:{{DIcon}} Alright, let's begin.
::'''Rongo:''' Haha, mighty straightforward of ya! Now that's the spirit our people lack right now, y'know? Righty then. I'll make the preparations now!
:{{DIcon}} Wait a bit, I've got something else I need to do.
::'''Rongo:''' No problem! I'll go fix the wooden racks a bit and wait here for your return, {{MC|m=kane|f=wahine}}!

;(Talk to Rongo again)
:'''Rongo:''' Oh, you're back! Ready to test the Great Training Arena site?
:{{DIcon}} Alright, let's begin.
::'''Rongo:''' Alright, let me do some prep work first!
:{{DIcon}} Wait a bit, I've got something else I need to do.
::'''Rongo:''' No problem! I'll go fix the wooden racks a bit and wait here for your return, {{MC|m=kane|f=wahine}}!

;(After completing the trial)
:'''Rongo:''' Haha, such skill! If all our kids were half as nimble as you, {{MC|m=kane|f=wahine}}, they wouldn't need training.
:'''Rongo:''' And here's the shell you were promised. Take it!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, just glad we could help.
:'''Rongo:''' Still, now that you've finished testing, I've realized that there's a serious problem...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? What would that problem be?
:'''Rongo:''' Don't you think... this is just a real regular surfing spot?
:{{DIcon}} And what did you think it would be otherwise?
;(If the player has completed [[Seeker No Finding]])
::{{DIcon}} Illumination at last...
;(If the player has not completed Seeker No Finding)
::{{DIcon}} Illumination at last! Never thought I'd see the day!
:'''Rongo:''' Well, uh... You see the Spiritdoors over there, {{MC|m=kane|f=wahine}}? When Amina and I were discussing this whole affair, these old [[Phlogiston]] Devices still operated normally.
:'''Rongo:''' *sigh* If they could still be used to activate those Spiritways, we could've ridden them straight up to the rainbow, just like Uenuku once did!
:{{DIcon}} I see...
:{{DIcon}} Paimon can just fly straight up there, Spiritway or no.
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, that's right, that's right! ... Actually, what are you getting competitive for?
:'''Rongo:''' It's just a shame that these devices don't work right anymore.
:'''Rongo:''' Normally, there should be {{Color|buzzword|inscriptions}} regarding the repair of these ancient Phlogiston Devices near them. Maybe these are exceptions.
;(If the player has completed [[Seeker No Finding]])
::'''Rongo:''' And I'm a whole bunch of things, but Phlogiston Scholar isn't one of them, so I've gotta call someone else in to fix this later.
::'''Paimon:''' (Speaking of that, [[Chikya]] probably knows how to fix these, right? But we don't know where she is right now...)
::'''Rongo:''' Anyway, you have my thanks, {{MC|m=kane|f=wahine}}!
;(If the player has not completed Seeker No Finding)
::'''Rongo:''' And I'm a whole bunch of things, but Phlogiston Scholar isn't one of them, so I've gotta call someone else in to fix this later. Thank you regardless, {{MC|m=kane|f=wahine}}!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, that's kind of a shame. Why don't we snoop around the area? Maybe we can find some way to fix 'em Spiritdoors!
:;(Obtain {{Item|Shiny Shell (Item)|text=Shiny Shell|x=1}})

;(Talk to Rongo again, optional)
:'''Rongo:''' Oh ho, you're back! What's good? Been full of fighting spirit lately, I hope?
:'''Rongo:''' Now it's a shame, but I haven't yet found a scholar who can repair these Spiritdoors. But it's alright. We'll just wait and see for now!
----
;(Read the Ancient Inscription, optional)
:'''Ancient Inscription:''' "...[[Tinilao]] of the [[Meztli]] leaves this {{Color|buzzword|inscription}}, that the Spiritscripts may not become blocked..."
:'''Ancient Inscription:''' "...Separate the Phlogiston Engravings into differently-colored {{Color|buzzword|shells}} and attach said shells to the..."
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, the rest is too blurred to read, but it seems like we can fix the nearby Spiritscript by sticking shells to it or something...?"
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh... Paimon's not sure why, but her motivation is bleeding out a bit right now...

;(Talk to Rongo after inserting the shells)
:'''Rongo:''' Ohh! Ohhh! I... didn't expect you to actually fix those doors! You... You've got spirit alright! Lots of it!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, how should Paimon put this, though? We've reactivated the devices, but Paimon thinks they need partial readjusting...
:{{DIcon}} Any ideas?
:{{DIcon}} I blame Paimon for not flying me across.
::'''Paimon:''' ?
:'''Rongo:''' Haha, no worries! Leave those details to me!
:'''Rongo:''' You just come back around tomorrow, alright?

;(Talk to Rongo again, optional)
:'''Rongo:''' Just leave the track adjustments to me, {{MC|m=kane|f=wahine}}. You just come back around tomorrow, alright?
----
;(Talk to Rongo after passing time)
:'''Rongo:''' Aha, you're back! Behold, the ultimate, enhanced "Great Training Arena of the Springs"!
:'''Rongo:''' What do you think, {{MC|m=kane|f=wahine}}? Ready to hop aboard a Spiritway?
:{{DIcon}} Alright, let's begin.
::'''Rongo:''' Alright, let's not wait longer than we need to, eh?
:{{DIcon}} ...Hold on, I need a moment. I'll be right back...
::'''Rongo:''' No worries! Tell me when you're ready to start!

;(After completing the challenge)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. Seems like the Spiritway's shut again...
:'''Rongo:''' Haha, no worries, no worries! It was fixed once, it can be fixed again! You just enjoy yourself, {{MC|m=kane|f=wahine}}!
:'''Rongo:''' Our current Training Arena is meant to hone young people and their fighting spirit, in any case... So this is more than enough.
:'''Rongo:''' If you've got the time and the mind to hone your spirit, feel free to come back!
