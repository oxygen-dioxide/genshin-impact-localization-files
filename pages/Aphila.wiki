==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Aphila:''' Hmm, there's no wind at the moment. When will it pick up again?
:{{DIcon}} Hey there.
::'''Aphila:''' Hello, nice to meet you.
:{{DIcon}} Are you waiting for someone?
::'''Aphila:''' No, I'm waiting for my Saurian! They are my trusty partner.
::'''Aphila:''' We've known each other since we were very little, and pretty much grew up together. According to the elders in the tribe, our birthdays were separated by just one day.
::'''Aphila:''' They learned everything a lot faster when we were little, too. At one point, I was worried that they'd leave me behind, since they learned how to fly so much faster than me.
::'''Aphila:''' All was well, though, for I soon caught up! It wasn't long before we went on our first flight together, and I decided to name them "The Twilight of That Day."
::'''Aphila:''' Sorry, I just started rambling...
::'''Aphila:''' I just love them so much, I can never shut up when I start talking about them. It's my bad.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Aphila:''' Yeah.
