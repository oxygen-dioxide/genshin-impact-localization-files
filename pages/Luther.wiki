'''Luther'''<ref>{{Ref/HEO|Ragged Records|s=Ragged Records #2}}</ref> was the writer of the [[Ancient Investigation Journal]]s, and little is known about him aside from him apparently growing up with [[Ingbert]], [[Parsifal]] and [[Eberhart]].<ref name="AIJ3">{{Ref/Book|Ancient Investigation Journal: Part III}}</ref> However, since he calls [[Landrich]], Parsifal, Ingbert and Eberhart 'Master' it seems he's likely from a lesser noble family or was a commoner or slave that was hired by Landrich. Another point that makes this likely is his mention of most likely having to become a gladiator if he fails this assignment.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Ancient Investigation Journal: Part II}}</ref>

He also apparently knows [[Priscilla]], but is unaware that she's in on Eberhart's plan, similarly to how he was unaware of Eberhart's plan until he attacked Ingbert.

Throughout the expedition he's uncertain of some choices being made, but doesn't question any of the nobles' motives, expecting them to be loyal. He's eventually attacked by Eberhart at the same time Ingbert was, but survives long enough to get away and finish the third and final journal before dying to his fatal injury.<ref name="AIJ3"/>
