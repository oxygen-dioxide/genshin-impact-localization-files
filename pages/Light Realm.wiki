The '''Light Realm''', also known as the '''realm of the elements'''<ref name="LS">{{Ref/Loading|Others|Light Realm}}</ref> and the '''Vishap Realm''', is one of three [[realm]]s in the world of [[Teyvat]]. The Light Realm is host to creatures that harness the pure, raw, primordial elements, also commonly known as elemental beings.<ref name="ByakuyaColl4">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|4|Bathysmal Vishap Experimental Records}}</ref><ref name="Tsumi's Dialogue">{{Ref/Quest|Three Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve}}</ref> It is diametrically opposed to the [[Abyss|Void Realm]]<ref name="Trial of Drake and Serpent"/> and also incompatible with the [[Human Realm]] without adjustments being made to increase compatibility.<ref name="ByakuyaColl4" />

==Overview==
The Light Realm is the place of origin for all pure, primordial elemental beings. The most prominent inhabitants of this realm are the [[Vishaps]] and their elemental lords, the [[Seven Sovereigns]], which is why it is also called the "Vishap Realm."<ref name="Tsumi's Dialogue"/> As the original form of elemental energy in Teyvat, it could perhaps be considered synonymous with the phenomenon of [[phlogiston]], which is today only found in [[Natlan]], and is considered a form of {{w|computronium}} which contains information in its purest form.<ref name=":0">{{Ref/Quest|Beneath the Secret Source}}</ref><ref name=Omen>{{Ref/Quest|An Omen of Annihilation and the Final Entreaty}}</ref>

When the [[Heavenly Principles]] arrived in Teyvat, it and its shades defeated the Seven Sovereigns and established the [[Human Realm]].<ref name="Before Sun and Moon">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2|Before Sun and Moon}}</ref> At some point, the Human Realm was interposed between the Light Realm and the Void Realm.<ref name="Trial of Drake and Serpent">{{Ref/Quest|The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent}}</ref> The three realms each have their separate but analogous concepts: the Human Realm's [[Ley Lines]], the Light Realm's elemental currents, and the Void Realm's dark currents.<ref name="Tsumi's Dialogue"/>

After the defeat of the Seven Sovereigns, both nature and the Light Realm fell under the dominion of humanity, as the Heavenly Principles used phlogiston to create more easily-controlled Elemental Energy to combat the Abyss (Void Realm)<ref name=":0" />. While elemental beings and creatures of the Human Realm are normally mutually incompatible, it is possible to make each other more compatible; vishaps were eventually modified to accept [[Orobashi]]'s Bloodbranch Coral; <ref name="ByakuyaColl4" /> the [[Coral Butterfly|Sangacorallia]] (or Sangocorexes) can break down the Light Realm's pure elemental energy into something more compatible for the Human Realm;<ref>{{Ref/Wildlife|Coral Butterfly}}</ref> the Holy Soil of [[Natlan]] was similarly broken down by the use of [[Grainfruit]] and the Essence of Sacrifice.<ref name=StoneTablet>Interactable, [[Ancestral_Temple#Damaged_Stone_Tablet_(IV)|Ancestral Temple: Damaged Stone Tablet (IV)</ref><ref name=Omen /> However, the Void Realm is wholly incompatible with either realm and is highly dangerous to both, while the Light Realm's energy vanquishes the darkness of the Void Realm.<ref name="Tsumi's Dialogue"/> As a result, despite their hatred towards humanity, the vishaps lent humans its aid against the encroaching Void Realm after [[Enjou]] tricked them into disrupting the balance of the three realms in [[Enkanomiya]].<ref name="LS" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Three Realms Gateway Offering: Aftermath}}</ref>

One example of a being from the Light Realm incorporating elements of the Void realm is [[Apep]], who successfully adapted to abyssal [[Forbidden Knowledge|forbidden knowledge]] after consuming the corrupted corpse of [[King Deshret]], but suffered great infirmity as a result in the ensuing millennia.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|What Shape Does the Self Hold}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* Despite being elemental beings and the only confirmed creatures of the Light Realm, Vishaps are not counted as Elemental Lifeforms in the [[Archive]]; rather, they are listed under Mystical Beasts.
