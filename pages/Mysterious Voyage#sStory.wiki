:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's never seen anything like it... But Paimon get a strange welcoming feeling from it. It doesn't seem like it's dangerous. Let's take advantage of the dark and get some rest~
:'''Traveler:''' Yes, let's get some rest.

:'''Traveler:''' This makes me think of the first time we met...
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, stop joking around! Hurry up and catch some fish before they run away&mdash;

:'''Paimon:''' Phew... That was scary! That giant ship looked like a sea monster from here!
:'''Traveler:''' I don't think there are any sea monsters with sails.
