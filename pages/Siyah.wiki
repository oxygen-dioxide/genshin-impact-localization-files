{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Siyah:''' Hello, hello. I should probably give you a heads-up &mdash; the way things are categorized here isn't exactly the clearest...
:{{DIcon|Souvenir}} What do you sell here?
::'''Siyah:''' I must apologize, the things the Association's been sending over lately have been a bit random, and I haven't had time to sort them all out yet...
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Siyah:''' We're an outlet of the Saurian Relics Association, and I'm the manager.
::'''Siyah:''' As I'm sure you know, Natlan is the nation where Saurians and humans live together, so naturally, many treasures are still knocking about from the times of the ancient Saurians.
::'''Siyah:''' The Saurian Relics Association is an organization that was specifically established to collect and sort through all these items.
::'''Siyah:''' ...But actually, that's more like the official way of describing it.
::'''Siyah:''' In truth, due to the sheer variety of different items we've collected, it's essentially turned into a giant flea market... I know, there's almost something comical about it...
::{{DIcon}} Don't worry, that's what has become of my backpack as well.
::'''Siyah:''' Really? You can fit all that stuff in your backpack!?
::'''Siyah:''' ...Oh, haha! You're having me on, aren't you? Nearly got me too, you did...
::'''Siyah:''' *sigh* Jokes aside, if you know any tricks for organizing things, you really must share them with me.
::'''Siyah:''' They all said that the Children of Echoes have a knack for business, which is why they chose me to be the shopkeeper here.
::'''Siyah:''' But in reality, what this place actually needs is a storage specialist...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Siyah:''' Take care.
