==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hunza:''' Phew... I finally got my change of clothes. Been a while since I felt this good!
:{{DIcon}} What was wrong with the old clothes?
::'''Hunza:''' It kinda fell apart.
::'''Hunza:''' Eh, that kind of thing happens all the time! You can't really do extreme sports without accepting that things will get damaged or broken. In the end, it's just a change of clothes. I can afford that much.
::'''Hunza:''' Still, I've gotta admit, it was pretty wild skateboarding on a mountain crest less than half a meter wide without any protective gear.
::'''Hunza:''' Thankfully, I had my most faithful and considerate Saurian sidekick with me! [[Katari]] has always been there for me... Wait, where did he go?
::'''Hunza:''' Weird... I could have sworn he was with me just a moment ago!
::{{DIcon}} Maybe they're resting.
::'''Hunza:''' Oh, well, that's certainly possible. But if I recall correctly, he's never had problems with stamina before...?
::'''Hunza:''' ...Haha, who knows, maybe he's just shy?
::'''Hunza:''' A lot of Yumkasaurs are like that. They're not too used to hanging out with humans all the time, probably because we're too high energy.
::'''Hunza:''' Eh, just give him some time. I'm sure that one day, he'll become just as outgoing as yours truly!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Hunza:''' See ya! Gotta say, you've got style!
