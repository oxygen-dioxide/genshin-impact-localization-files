'''Lan''' {{Lang|zh=岚姐|zh_rm=Lán-jiě}} is an [[NPC]] in [[Liyue Harbor]]. She is the Branch Master of the [[Adventurers' Guild]] in Liyue and can be found standing next to [[Katheryne]]'s reception area.

Lan is briefly spoken to during the [[Archon Quest]] ''[[Three Poignant Perfumes]]''. Her dialogue changes slightly after completing it.

Following a certain dialogue branch for the first time gives the player seven [[Adventurer's Experience]]. This branch is only made available after starting the [[World Quest]] ''[[...What Do Adventurers Do Again?]]''.

==Profile==
<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->
Lan is a former mercenary and the younger sister of a martial artist who wielded a blade known as the Unseen Razor. After he died of unknown circumstances, his sword mysteriously disappeared. In her search of it, Lan joined the Adventurers' Guild and took on any Commission that involved swords, as she was not well-read but could recognize the word "sword." She completed increasingly dangerous missions and, while her search for the Unseen Razor remained fruitless, she eventually was promoted to Branch Master of the Liyue Adventurers' Guild for her efforts. Due to her disinterest in the position, she leaves most of the Guild's affairs to [[Katheryne]].<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Lan}}</ref>

===Personality===
Lan has a relatively apathetic disposition about anything besides her search for the Unseen Razor, although she displays concern when the Adventurers' Guild begins getting more banal and insignificant Commissions following the expansion of the [[Qixing]]'s power.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Adventurers' Guild's Affairs}}</ref> She also grows irritated by [[Hu Tao]]'s antics<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Mysterious Wangsheng Parlor}}</ref> and expresses her disdain towards the [[Treasure Hoarders]]' decision to target a rumored [[Abyss Order]] stronghold.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Involuntary Sacrifice}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Lan has brown hair cut into a bob and wears the standard female Adventurers' Guild uniform. The uniform consists of three layers of clothing (a white short-sleeve dress with a front cut-off, a green cape collar with a ruffled trim and a triangular back flap, and a green panel skirt with slits and a red bow at the back), a short red neckerchief, brown socks and laced high leather boots. The Adventurers' Guild logo, an eight-pointed star, is printed on the right and back flaps of the collar.

==Dialogue==
{{StubDialogue|Need to check condition of change from dialogue set #1 to #2. A user received new dialogue before completion of Omnipresence Over Mortals}}
===Dialogue Set #1===
<!-- The condition used to be after Omnipresence Over Mortals. The dialogue actually changed at an earlier point. It happens to me when I just started Omnipresence Over Mortals. Not sure which one is the trigger. -->
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Lan:''' ...? Excuse me, adventurer. Please see [[Katheryne]] about anything Guild-related &mdash; I am not intimately acquainted with the workings of the Guild.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Lan:''' If you're looking for the Master of the Liyue Adventurers' Guild, I regret to inform you that, that would be me.
::'''Lan:''' By which I mean, don't expect any help from me on Guild-related matters. I avoid involving myself in such bothersome affairs.
::'''Lan:''' That is, unless you bring news about the sword.
::{{DIcon}} What sword?
::'''Lan:''' My older brother's sword. If I find it, I can finally give him a proper burial...
::'''Lan:''' It's the only fitting way to go for a martial artist like him.
::'''Lan:''' It's a flat blade, sharp enough to slide an airborne hair in two. It's named "Unseen Razor."
::{{DIcon}} How did you become Master of the Liyue branch?
:::'''Lan:''' Ugh, why does everyone ask me the same question... I will make an exception for you, though, and give you the full story.
:::'''Lan:''' I used to be a mercenary. I joined the Adventurers' Guild so I could take advantage of their superior intelligence network and track down the sword.
:::'''Lan:''' I may not be very literate but I can read the word "sword". So I just took on every single commission that had something to do with a sword.
:::'''Lan:''' Then, just when I'd finished my eighth&mdash; or was it my ninth commission? Anyway, I'd just finished it, and then word came from the headquarters in [[Snezhnaya]] that I'd apparently completed two S-rank commissions.
:::'''Lan:''' ...And suddenly I found myself promoted to branch Guild Master. It was all very strange indeed.
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} ... You're amazing.
::::'''Lan:''' You think so? Well, I don't do it for any kind of praise or approval.
::::'''Lan:''' But since I am branch master and all that, I guess I have to show I'm making an effort or something.
::::'''Lan:''' I jotted down some thoughts on adventuring back when I was looking for the sword. Here, take them. Maybe you'll find them useful.
:::;(Obtain [[Adventurer's Experience]] ×7)
::{{DIcon}} I'll let you know if I find anything.
:::'''Lan:''' Oh, thanks! I love meeting people like you who are up for everything.
:::'''Lan:''' I am grateful to you, newcomer. It looks like it was worth me joining the Guild after all.
:{{DIcon}} So, have you seen someone who looks like me?
:;(This option disappears after ???)
::'''Lan:''' Like you? ...Oh, I see. You're looking for family.
::'''Lan:''' I haven't, no, but I will keep it in mind.
::'''Lan:''' I've been separated from family before. I know how you feel...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Lan:''' Aight, don't drag this out.

===Dialogue Set #2===
:'''Lan:''' It's been a while since I saw you last. For any Guild-related matters, please talk to Katheryne.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Lan/The Seventh Sword's Past|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Lan:''' It's naive of you to try to beat me with this trick.
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Lan:''' I see that you're really good at cards...
:{{DIcon}} Have we met?
::'''Lan:''' Huh? Don't tell me you've forgotten who I am? Luckily, I still remember you.
::'''Lan:''' I'm the Master of the Liyue Adventurers' Guild, although I tend to avoid involving myself in Guild-related matters and other such bothersome affairs.
::'''Lan:''' All that interests me is news about the sword.
::{{DIcon}} The sword? What sword?
:;(Rest of the dialogue is the same as everything under "What sword?")
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
:;(Same as before)
{{Dialogue end}}
