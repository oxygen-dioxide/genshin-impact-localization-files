==Records of Unknown Attribution (I)==
(A record left by an unknown [[Klingsor|person]]. It appears to have been hidden here intentionally.)<br>
...It's beyond doubt that the elders of the [[Order of Skeptics]] are hiding something...<br>
...Only while accompanying the investigation team from the [[Dharma Forest|rainforest]] was I finally able to resolve the doubts I have held for many years...<br>
...<br>
...the realm does not just belong to those of the blood of [[Khaenri'ah]], but it is the homeland of all human beings...<br>
...Holding fast to this maxim, my ancestor [[Hadura]] couldn't bear to see our people meet such a tragic end, and yet their dedication was rewarded with an unjust punishment, their reputation impugned and legacy stigmatized. I now understand the meaning of all this...<br>
...<br>
...Perhaps it is as the [[Rene's Investigation Notes|notebook]] says, and we can find a power that transcends even that of the [[Abyss]] — the power of "evolution"...

==Records of Unknown Attribution (II)==
(A record left by an unknown [[Klingsor|person]]. it{{sic}} seems as though it was accidentally dropped here.)<br>
...Thanks to the assistance of those researchers, I finally found the source of the "gospel" that has been buzzing in my ears for days...<br>
...That conceited [[Nagarjuna|one-armed sage]] thinks lies are enough to bring salvation...<br>
...but I will bring "truth" to this world!<br>
...We waged war against the forces from beyond the sky, yet we were rejected by the [[Heavenly Principles|laws of this world]] and tormented by an unjust curse...<br>
...This mistake must be rectified...<br>
...As a people not accepted by any existence, our only option is to choose our own path...
