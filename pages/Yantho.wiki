==Trivia==
* ''Yantho'' is a god from the {{w|Maya_mythology|Mayan mythology}}. It's described as a hostile god to humanity, and usually as part of the "Yantho Triad" alongside his brothers ''Usukan'' and ''Uyitzin''. This triad despise the human beings and take joy on their distress. They are also associated with earthquakes and destruction; and are brothers to the benevolent ''Nohochacyum'' (god of merchants and travelers), ''Xamaniqinqu'', and the world-girdling serpent, ''Hapikern''.
** There's another NPC named as one of his brothers: ''[[Usukan]]''.
