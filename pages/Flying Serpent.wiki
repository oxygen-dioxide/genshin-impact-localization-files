==Descriptions==
{{Description|A reptile with a limited ability to hover.<br>Flying serpents do not truly possess the ability to fly: their ability to hover seems to derive from their bird-like hollow bones and  the sparkle of [[Anemo]] that imbues them with a subtle influence over the wind. The desert is a far way from the [[Mondstadt|nation of Anemo]], but its lands are still ever-graced by gales intent on eroding everything. Everything, from cities to history, will eventually be razed to sand grains by the winnowing currents that drift over the [[Great Red Sand]]. Only creatures such as the flying serpents, which have learned to live with the wind, can continue to survive in the desert long after all has been reduced to dust.|[[Archive]]}}
