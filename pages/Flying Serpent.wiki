{{Description|A reptile with a limited ability to hover.<br />Flying serpents do not truly possess the ability to fly: their ability to hover seems to derive from their bird-like hollow bones and  the sparkle of Anemo that imbues them with a subtle influence over the wind.|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/105008 Sumeru Adventure Journal Vol.1: Desert of Hadramaveth]}}
