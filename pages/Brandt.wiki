==Profile==
Brandt was once the butler of the duelist [[Rocky Avildsen]], but stole everything from him, causing Avildsen to exile himself into [[Erinnyes Forest]].<ref>{{Ref/Item|Rocky Avildsen's Disappearance}}</ref> Brandt was also a jeweler, and used underhanded methods to destroy [[Athos (Fontaine)|Athos]]'s business and life, which Athos retaliated against by stabbing him to death and dumping his corpse in the [[Salacia Plain]]. Athos has spent his life in hiding ever since.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Athos's Confession}}</ref>
