==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ylgr:''' Ah! You scared the life out of me! You shouldn't sneak up on people when they're absorbed in something like that!
:{{DIcon}} You're the one doing the sneaking.
::'''Ylgr:''' How dare you accuse me of sneaking!
::'''Ylgr:''' I'm Ylgr, and you'd better remember that name because I'm about to go down in history as one of the greatest adventurers of all time!
::{{DIcon}} "About to"?
:::'''Ylgr:''' Yeah, I mean I'm... not famous enough yet, so... Ugh, did you really have to ask that?
:::'''Ylgr:''' *sigh* If only I had a Vision. When will the gods finally recognize me?
:::'''Ylgr:''' With elemental power at my disposal, I would be able to carve out my own path...
::{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
:::'''Ylgr:''' I am surveying the mountains around Springvale and checking for discrepancies against an old map.
:::'''Ylgr:''' Obviously most geological features don't change even after millennia of transformation in the world... But still, existing documentation is vague and imprecise on the location of certain places...
:::'''Ylgr:''' Once my newly updated map of Mondstadt is finished, I'm sure it will become famous all over Teyvat!
:{{DIcon|Reward}} How are your adventures going?
::'''Ylgr:''' Quite smoothly. I've finished annotating the maps of Drunkard Gorge, Springvale and the surrounding areas...
::'''Ylgr:''' Annotation is actually quite tiring, but it's also very satisfying... Are you interested in my work, by any chance?
::'''Ylgr:''' If you are, please take these &mdash; it's some of the knowledge I've gained on my adventures. Someday, everyone in Mondstadt will use the maps I've made!
:;(Obtain [[Adventurer's Experience]] ×3)
:{{DIcon}} Have you encountered anyone who looks like me?
::'''Ylgr:''' Looking for someone? ...I'm sorry, I don't think your appearance rings a bell.
::'''Ylgr:''' I've been checking maps of Mondstadt for discrepancies lately, so I've only had eyes for the mountains and the rivers.
::'''Ylgr:''' A person needs to give their tasks their full attention, wouldn't you say?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Ylgr:''' Don't distract me anymore!
