'''Thundering Fury''' is an [[Artifact Set]] available at [[:Category:4-Star Artifacts|4-star]] and [[:Category:5-Star Artifacts|5-star]] rarities which can be obtained from [[Midsummer Courtyard]].

==Gameplay Notes==
*4-Piece Bonus:
**The character using the artifact set must trigger the reaction (apply their element second) to trigger the 4-Piece Bonus.
**An [[Electro]] based reaction on self doesn't trigger the four piece cooldown reduction bonus. (However [[Swirl]]s on self from Jean's [[Dandelion Breeze]] that spread an element to trigger an Electro reaction on others will reduce cooldown)
**The cooldown reduction bonus doesn't occur if the character is off field. e.g. if Fischl uses [[Nightrider]] (Oz) and switches to a different party member.
**However the 4-piece bonus elemental reaction damage increase takes effect regardless of whether the user is active or swapped out.
** The 4-piece bonus elemental reaction damage increase stacks additively with the bonus from [[Elemental Mastery]]. Thus it is equivalent to around 50 units of EM at low elemental mastery, and slightly more at higher elemental mastery levels (as of [[Version/1.6]])

==Lore==
* The lore of this artifact set depicts the downfall of the [[Thunderbird Civilization|tribespeople]] of [[Tsurumi Island]] and, most notably, the sacrifice of [[Ruu]] to the [[Thunderbird]].
