==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Shayan:''' Hi, can I help you?
:'''Shayan:''' If you run into smugglers, careful not to fall for any of their scams. Report them at once.
:{{DIcon}} Is there a lot of smuggling going on?
::'''Shayan:''' This is [[Sumeru City]]'s small port. Since it's right under the [[Akademiya]]'s nose and is garrisoned by the [[Corps of Thirty]], it's much easier to deal with smuggling problems here than at [[Port Ormos]].
::'''Shayan:''' But there will always be a handful of people who don't have their heads on straight and try to pull a fast one here.
::'''Shayan:''' Hmph. I'd urge them to really think it through first.
:{{DIcon}} Excuse me.
::'''Shayan:''' See you. Please tell me the moment you come across any smuggling activity.
