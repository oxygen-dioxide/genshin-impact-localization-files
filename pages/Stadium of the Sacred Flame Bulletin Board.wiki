:'''Guest Message:''' "Big Sis Lady Mavuika! What are your glasses made of? Why don't they get burned by fire? I asked Dad, Mom, and Big Sis, but none of them know..."
:'''Pyro Archon's Reply:''' "My sunglasses? I had 'em custom-made from [[Xilonen]]. If you want a pair, too, kiddo, you can ask her. I'm sure she's happy to help."
:'''Another Guest's Message:''' "Lady Archon. I'm an athlete, but I've been in subpar form lately, and a breakthrough has eluded me constantly."
:'''Another Guest's Message:''' "...I sometimes wonder if I simply... lack talent. If I should give up. Dear Archon, could you give me some advice?"
:'''Pyro Archon's Reply:''' "If you wish to gain fame and wealth through 'sport,' then I urge you to work within your limits and be realistic about your chances."

===Light Novels===
:'''Speaker's Chamber Reply:''' "...Using woven scrolls to record fictional novels? You might be barking up the wrong tree. We are the Speaker's Chamber, not the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]], nor are we a publishing company."
:'''Guest Message:''' "Uh, no, what we've actually done is hire a famous external novelist. We'd like to write an interesting light novel for our Pyro Archon."
:'''Guest Message:''' "The novel is largely complete at this point, and we'd like to create a promotion plan that has a distinctly 'Natlan' flavor to it..."
:'''Speaker's Chamber Reply:''' "So, that's why you'd like this novel woven into a scroll, yes?"
:'''Speaker's Chamber Reply:''' "Hmmm. That does sound quite interesting! We'll inform the Pyro Archon about this..."
:'''Pyro Archon's Reply:''' "Well, I think that's a great idea. I'll hit [[Citlali]] up later. She might be interested, too."
:'''Pyro Archon's Reply:''' "That said, do let me have a look at the book first, would you? I'd be interested to know what outlanders think of me..."

===New Fitness Program===
:'''Guest Message:''' "Uh, I applied to meet with the Pyro Archon last week and discuss how to promote a new type of sport and fitness movement..."
:'''Speaker's Chamber Reply:''' "Last week? She went to take part in a fitness invitational contest at the invitation of the Collective of Plenty. It seems she did not have the time to respond to your message. Please, do..."
:'''Guest Message:''' "Oh, I'm from the Collective of Plenty, actually. She said that she'd try the new fitness program herself, before picking the appropriate weight for each training stage."
:'''Guest Message:''' "But it's been a week, and she hasn't sent me a reply. I would just like to know... How's she finding the experience?"
:'''Speaker's Chamber Reply:''' "Considering the number of barbell plates outside her training room, we suspect that our Archon will be in training for some time."
:'''Guest Message:''' "H&mdash;Huh? Wait, then... how is she doing right now?"
:'''Speaker's Chamber Reply:''' "She is presently shooting for a new weight, and she just went outside to get some new weightlifting belts, humming all the way. Would you... like to wait a while longer?"
:'''Guest Message:''' "Alright. I'll head back and bring a merchant who sells those belts with me next time..."

===Pyro Archon's Daily Training===
:'''Guest Message:''' "Apologies. I'm a merchant from the store next door. Could I ask what the [[Speaker's Chamber]] has been doing lately?"
:'''Guest Message:''' "We often hear dull thudding, and the ground will tremble slightly from time to time... Is it some sort of earthquake? Or is the building going to collapse?"
:'''Speaker's Chamber Reply:''' "Very sorry! Please rest assured that earthquakes don't happen around here, and the building is very stable."
:'''Speaker's Chamber Reply:''' "The tremors and dull thuds you heard are from the Pyro Archon's daily routine training."
:'''Speaker's Chamber Reply:''' "The weight of the barbells used by the Pyro Archon are very heavy, which is why they make a loud noise when they fall to the ground. We will speak to her on the topic. Thank you for your understanding!"
:'''Guest Message:''' "Might I... ask how much weight is needed to make such a noise...? Anyway, since it's so heavy, wouldn't it be better if she trained outdoors instead?"
:'''Speaker's Chamber Reply:''' "She said that she sometimes loses control out in the wild, and tends to use weights that are... Let's call them somewhat overboard."
:'''Speaker's Chamber Reply:''' "Since the last incident, where she almost smashed a certain volcano with a giant rock, causing a landslide, she has endeavored to refrain from further outdoor training."
:'''Guest Message:''' "...I see. In that case, I, too, suggest that she remain indoors when training."
:'''Speaker's Chamber Reply:''' "Thank you for your kind understanding. We will send you a set of earplugs."

===Saurian Cookies===
:'''Guest Message:''' "Could I ask what the Pyro Archon thinks of the [[Saurian]] Cookies we sent her?"
:'''Guest Message:''' "Could we ask for her opinion on them?"
:'''Speaker's Chamber Reply:''' "She loves them! In fact, she's had quite a few. If she had to have one teeny-tiny criticism of them, it's that they're just the slightest bit on the dry side."
:'''Guest Message:''' "Uhh... Well, they're for little Saurians, so..."
:'''Speaker's Chamber Reply:''' "Yes, and that's why she's gone off into the wild to look for wild Saurians."
:'''Speaker's Chamber Reply:''' "'Wild Saurians tend to be very sensitive to food, so I'll find the most energetic of the lot and feed it some,' so she said."
:'''Guest Message:''' "Then... You don't happen to know where she is now, do you?"
:'''Speaker's Chamber Reply:''' "According to her previous plan, she should have arrived in the vicinity of [[Teticpac Peak]]. Please exercise some patience."
:'''Guest Message:''' "What sort of Saurian will she be looking for...?"
