'''Shrines of Depths''' are ancient structures found around the world of [[Teyvat]]. These Shrines of Depths sealed themselves off when the civilization that built them was lost. Players can use Shrines of Depths keys to unlock these shrines and open the Luxurious Chest found inside. There are 10 Shrines of Depths in each Teyvat region, thus requiring 10 keys for each region.

==Unlocking and Keys==
Players can obtain the keys required to open shrines by completing certain [[quest]]s (specifically [[Archon Quests]] and [[World Quests]]), completing one-time [[Domains]] and as a reward from ascending specific [[Adventure Rank]]. Each region of Teyvat has its own type of key, and players must use its corresponding key to unlock the shrines.

Opening the chest will reward the player with {{Item|Primogem|30|text=Primogems|x=40}}, {{Item|Adventure EXP|30|x=60}}, [[Sigils]] ×10 corresponding to that region, and a random assortment of [[Weapons]] and [[Artifacts]].
Each shrine can only be unlocked once and the chest inside does not respawn.
