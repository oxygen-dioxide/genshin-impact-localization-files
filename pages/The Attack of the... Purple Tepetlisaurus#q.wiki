{{Dialogue Start}}
;(If the player approaches from the west side)
;(Approach [[Cuchihua]])
:'''Cuchihua:''' What am I gonna do... What am I gonna do? The boss is definitely gonna beat me up when I get back...
:{{DIcon}} What happened?
::'''Cuchihua:''' *sigh* It's a long story... Our caravan was moving along just fine when the volcano erupted out of nowhere. Then, these massive purple [[Tepetlisaur]]s burst out of the ground...
::'''Cuchihua:''' I wasn't paying attention, and my [[saurian]] partner got spooked and carried me far from the group. By the time I got us turned back around, the path was completely blocked, and now I can't get back to the others...
::'''Cuchihua:''' I don't even know how everyone else is doing... and I ditched the group without permission... The boss is gonna kill me. I'm done. This is it. I'm dead.
:{{DIcon}} If it were me, I'd just run...
::'''Cuchihua:''' Run? No, no, no, that's impossible. The boss is like the [[Night Kingdom]] &mdash; everywhere, all the time. She'll hunt me down and drag me back no matter where I go...
::'''Cuchihua:''' I've gotta go back and apologize. But how? The road's blocked... Ugh, I'm so dead this time...
;(Smash through the Pulverite)
:'''Cuchihua:''' The road is open? Praise be! We're saved!

;(If the player approaches from the east side)
;(Approach the scene)
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Rawr!
----
;(Talk to [[Zashari]], optional)
:'''Zashari:''' *panting*
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
:'''Zashari:''' I&mdash;I'm okay, just got a bit flustered from running earlier. Need a moment to catch my breath...
:{{DIcon}} Best get enough rest.
:'''Zashari:''' {{tx}}

;(Talk to [[Tizlo]], optional)
:'''Tizlo:''' Hey! You, yeah, I'm talking to you! It's dangerous out there, get inside, quick!
:'''Tizlo:''' Haven't you seen the mess along the way? There's been a volcanic eruption, and there are monsters blocking the road. You shouldn't go any further.
:'''Tizlo:''' Listen to me. Stay here for a bit and wait. In a while, you can head out with the rest of our caravan. That way, we can watch each others' backs. Otherwise, it's way too dangerous to go alone.
:{{DIcon}} Monsters?
::'''Tizlo:''' Yeah, a whole pack of purple Tepetlisaurs! They've clearly been corrupted by the [[Abyss]]! Insanely destructive. Honestly, I've never seen any of their kind this terrifying before!
::'''Tizlo:''' Let me tell you, those things casually swung their tails and completely wrecked our carts. They're even stronger than [[Tatankasaur]]s &mdash; definitely not the kind of opponents just anyone can handle.
::'''Tizlo:''' I'm serious &mdash; don't get all hot-headed and try to fight them. If you see them, just steer clear, alright?
:{{DIcon}} No worries, I'll be fine.
::'''Tizlo:''' You... *sigh*... alright, just be careful out there...

;(Approach [[Itzayah]] and the "purple Tepetlisaur")
:'''Itzayah:''' Come on! Don't think that just because you've grown a bit and dressed yourselves in purple I'm afraid of you! Come face me &mdash; if you've got the [[Cacahuatl]]s!
:'''Itzayah:''' You picked the wrong woman to mess with! You want my goods? Come and get 'em!

;(After defeating the second wave of enemies)
:'''Itzayah:''' Hey! Watch out! Those good-for-nothings are back again!

;(After defeating all the enemies)
:'''Itzayah:''' Phew... what a mess to deal with. To think that I almost got knocked flat by some Tepetlisaurs... That just boils my blood!
:'''Paimon:''' You've got it all wrong &mdash; those are Abyssal monsters! They're way more dangerous than Tepetlisaurs. So you thought they were just ordinary ones... No wonder you struggled!
:'''Itzayah:''' Hah, is that it? Makes sense now. I really owe you this time. If it weren't for you guys, I'd have been done for.
:'''Itzayah:''' Hold on a sec, I need to go round up those useless idiots first. I'll thank you properly once I make sure they're all safe.
:{{Black Screen|With your help, the people from the caravan gradually gather around.}}
:'''Tizlo:''' So, it's all thanks to these three that you made it out safe, boss?
:'''Itzayah:''' Haha, that's right! You should've seen them in action &mdash; took down those monsters in just a couple of moves!
:'''Tizlo:''' You saved the squad leader. That's a debt I haven't much to offer in repayment for. But please, take this small gift as a token of my gratitude.
:'''Itzayah:''' Seriously, Tizlo? Have you always been this stingy? That's all you're giving to the people who saved your life!?
;(The screen goes dark and a treasure-spawning sound plays)
:'''Itzayah:''' Hey, chubby! Ensuring the caravan's safety is your job, isn't it? So what's this about someone else having to clean up your mess? What do you have to say for youself?
:'''Cuchihua:''' I&mdash;
:'''Itzayah:''' Quit stuttering! If you hadn't panicked and dropped your guard, a few measly monsters wouldn't have been a problem for me! This time, you're giving up part of your pay to thank our savior. Got it?
;(The screen goes dark again, and a treasure-spawning sound plays)
:'''Itzayah:''' Of course, such a small token as a life-saving gift does seem a bit stingy, doesn't it?
:{{DIcon}} Indeed, it feels a bit lacking.
::'''Itzayah:''' Haha, well said! I like people like you — you say it how it is!
:{{DIcon}} No, this is more than enough.
::'''Itzayah:''' Tsk, you're not really very forthright, are you? That's no fun. Just take it already! Otherwise, if word gets out, people will label me a cheapskate.
:'''Itzayah:''' Ahem, anyway, this is a personal gift from me to you. Just accept it! Consider it a little something extra for your little Tepetlisaurus to get some more snacks. No need for any thanks or formalities!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Itzayah:''' Alright, we still need to go pick up all the stuff we lost along the way. We'll be heading off now! May we meet again!
;(The screen goes dark one last time, and a treasure-spawning sound plays)
