:'''Chandraputra:''' So, uh, Ms. Paula... Have you heard any funny noises lately?
:'''Paula:''' I think you make funny noises, Uncle. Does that count?
:'''Chandraputra:''' No, no, I don't mean that kind of funny! I mean something that might be useful to a creative process! If not, my "The Shadow Over Petrichor and the Liliacruces Riddles" is going to...
:'''Chandraputra:''' *cough* Anyway, Ms. Paula, have you ever heard something weird that you wouldn't be believed about even if you told the adults?
:'''Paula:''' Hmm... Now you mention it, I think I've heard some strange noises in my sleep...
:'''Chandraputra:''' Oh! And then what? Then what? What do you think that was, Ms. Paula? Have you heard it before?
:'''Paula:''' Hmm, let me think... How about this, then? Let's play another round of [[Genius Invokation TCG]]! If you win, I'll tell you!
:'''Chandraputra:''' Huh? Wait... Look, we've played for days now. And still...
:'''Paula:''' Eh? Well, it's alright if you don't wanna know. I'll just play with Ms. [[Contarini]] then.
:'''Chandraputra:''' No, wait! Wait! I'll play with you, alright? But please, stick to the deal we made, alright?
