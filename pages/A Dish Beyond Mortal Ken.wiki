{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Smiley Yanxiao)
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' *sigh* What should I do...?
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Ah, it's you. Nothing's wrong... except I might need to start looking for a new job soon.
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' The other day, the innkeeper asked me to prepare a new dish that would attract more guests.
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' It should be presentable and tasty, but also stylish and artisan. Oh, and have personality...
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' I've been trying to come up with something satisfactory over the last week, but the innkeeper didn't like any dish I came up with.
:{{DIcon}} What did you make?
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' I gave it all I had, really. I utilized everything I learned while honing my culinary skills in the mountains.
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Candied Silk Flower, Qingxin and Lotus Seed Duck Stew, Crab Roe Stewed Meatballs...
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' ...But he would shake his head at everything and ask me to give it another thought.
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' But I've already reached my limit, eh...
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Ah, right! I still gotta cook something for that freeloader. It's about time he came around...
:{{DIcon}} Do you mean Jiangxue?
::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Unless you know of any other parasites who'd shamelessly come here every day asking for food...
:{{DIcon}} Haven't you already reached {{sic|you|hide=1}} limit?
::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' At least he isn't as picky as the innkeeper. A few regular dishes should be enough for him.
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Since you're already here, why don't you grab a bite too? You can sit over there. I'll serve the food when it's ready.

;(Talk to Smiley Yanxiao again)
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' You can sit by the table. I'll serve the food when it's ready.
----
;(Talk to Jiangxue, optional)
:'''Jiangxue:''' Huh? I see that we have a special guest today. Usually, it's just that chef and I, eating in silence. Perhaps your presence will liven up today's meal.
:'''Jiangxue:''' But it appears that the chef is terribly worried about something today. Why the long face...

;(Sit by the table)
:'''Jiangxue:''' These meatballs are not half bad, this meat just melts in one's mouth, the broth packs a lot of flavor as well...
:'''Jiangxue:''' Huh? There's crab roe in the meat, no wonder it tastes so unusually fresh.
:'''Jiangxue:''' Come, Traveler, try one more. I'll teach you what to do. First, use chopsticks to open the meatball up, then soak it in the broth, and eat it with some rice...
:{{DIcon}} So nice of you...
:{{DIcon}} Whoa, you talk like an expert...
::'''Jiangxue:''' Hahaha, even a fool would learn a thing or two about food if they got to eat such delicacies every day. Let me teach you the correct way to taste this stewed fish.
:{{DIcon}} You're not eating with us?
::'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Me? I'm afraid I'm already full... since the innkeeper filled me with anxiety.
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' You'd better enjoy the food because that might've been the last meal I got to cook here...
:'''Jiangxue:''' Last meal you got to cook here... Who told you so?
:'''Jiangxue:''' Oh no, is it because of me? Is the innkeeper fed up with you because you've been feeding me all this time?
:'''Jiangxue:''' Seems a bit unfair, given that I supplied the inn with some of my best catches free of charge. That should've covered at least a part of my bill. Besides, the innkeeper isn't known for being a miser...
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Give me a break, it was just a few fish, and most of them ended up in your stomach anyway.
:'''Jiangxue:''' So actually...
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' *sigh* ...Fine. I'll tell you...
:{{Black Screen|''Smiley Yanxiao explains the innkeeper's request to Jiangxue...''}}
:'''Jiangxue:''' Presentable, tasty, stylish, artisan, and with personality...
:'''Jiangxue:''' Hahaha, I'm not sure if there's any dish in this world that'd meet the innkeeper's requirements.
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' You think it's funny? We'll see how you'll laugh when you come over next time and I won't be here to feed you for free!
:'''Jiangxue:''' Alright, alright, it's not so funny after all. So that's why you've been looking so worried today.
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' It's hard to be in high spirits when your boss expects you to perform miracles all of a sudden...
:'''Jiangxue:''' Hm, there might be a way out. Even though I can't cook myself, I happen to know a recipe for a unique dish.
:'''Jiangxue:''' I came across that dish during a trip abroad, when I happened to be a guest at a local big shot's house. They called it Chicken Tofu Pudding.
:'''Jiangxue:''' By the looks of it, you wouldn't say that it's a meat dish. It really is as delicate as tofu pudding, but with a strong flavor of meat and herbs. A rare meat dish that imitates vegetarian cuisine.
:'''Jiangxue:''' That meal left me so curious about the dish that I asked my host for the recipe, however... I'm a bad cook, so the recipe has been collecting dust in my chest ever since...
:{{DIcon}} I'm surprised that you managed to get a hold of such a recipe.
::'''Jiangxue:''' Uh... Long story short, I helped someone, and they invited me to a feast to show their gratitude.
::'''Jiangxue:''' The chef who came up with this recipe didn't mind sharing it with me. He was confident that one can count the people skilled enough to make such a dish on one hand anyway.
:{{DIcon}} Surely, it must be a very difficult dish...
:'''Jiangxue:''' No doubt about it. According to chat chef, those who attempt to make the dish, have to be not only skilled in the art of cooking, but also in the art of the sword.
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Hmph, what kind of dish requires swinging a sword? I can chop meat just fine with my knife.
:'''Jiangxue:''' I'm afraid you'd sooner cut the chopping board in half than mince the meat fine enough with that knife of yours.
:'''Jiangxue:''' I was told that minced meat is the highlight of this dish.
:'''Jiangxue:''' As such, precise sword technique is the key to success. First, one needs to portion the meat and chop it up with the sword's edge. Then, use the sword's backside to mince it. Next...
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Hold on. Wait a minute... That recipe of yours is good for nothing in our hands. I'm not much of a swordsman, and you're not a cook.
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Where can we find a sword-wielding warrior who also happens to have some culinary skills?
:'''Jiangxue:''' This person... might be closer than you think.
:{{DIcon}} M&mdash;Me?
::'''Jiangxue:''' Precisely. Isn't it a fortunate twist of fate that you know how to use both the sword and the stove?
:{{DIcon}} I know my way around the kitchen, that's true...
::'''Jiangxue:''' You're also a skilled swordsman, aren't you? I've witnessed some of your feats myself.
:'''Jiangxue:''' How about we let the Traveler attempt to make that unique dish?
:{{DIcon}} But the innkeeper wanted Yanxiao to...
:'''Jiangxue:''' Well, the innkeeper only told Yanxiao to come up with a new dish. He didn't specify who had to cook it, so it's still an open question.
:'''Jiangxue:''' Am I right, chef?
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Ah... right! Your logic is sound!
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' But what ingredients do we need to make a Chicken Tofu Pudding?
:'''Jiangxue:''' Nothing special, really, just some Fowl, Ham, Bird Egg, and Snapdragon.
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' ...Still have some Fowl and Ham stored in the kitchen, but... we're fresh out of Bird Eggs and Snapdragon...
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Had I known sooner, I wouldn't have made those Matsutake Scrambled Eggs...
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Traveler, can I count on you to bring me one of each?
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Once you find them, we'll work that Chicken Tofu Pudding out together.
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Uh... Naturally, I'll make sure to repay you for your help... Thank you in advance.

;(Talk to Jiangxue, optional)
:'''Jiangxue:''' I've never expected that this recipe might actually come in handy, and yet...
----
;(Talk to Smiley Yanxiao)
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Have you found a Bird Egg and a Snapdragon?
:;(Give the ingredients)
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Alright, we've got all the ingredients needed. Let's get to work.
:{{DIcon}} Where do I start...
:{{DIcon}} So... What do you want me to do first?
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Well... maybe our freeloading friend can provide us with some instructions?
:'''Jiangxue:''' Right. First, portion the meat on the table with your sword and slice it into smaller pieces. Then, mince it, slowly turning it into fine paste...

;(Talk to Smiley Yanxiao, optional)
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' I wonder how it will turn out. Hope it's tasty...

;(Talk to Jiangxue, optional)
:'''Jiangxue:''' First, portion the meat on the table with your sword and slice it into smaller pieces. Then, mince it, slowly turning it into fine paste...

;(After performing a melee attack on the meat)
:'''Jiangxue:''' Okay, that's good, now pour some more water into this pot...
:'''Jiangxue:''' Hey chef, can you take care of this Ham and Snapdragon and make a pot of broth? Just remember to filter it carefully.
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Okay, okay, I'll do exactly that....

;(After performing a Hydro attack on the stove)
:'''Jiangxue:''' Now, light the stove up and slow-cook the meat paste.
:'''Jiangxue:''' You have to keep the flame in check &mdash; too low and the meat won't cook through, too high and the paste will break up and lose its texture.
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Slow-cooking the meat in a special broth... This dish is not a budget option, that's for sure...

;(After performing a Pyro attack on the stove)
:'''Jiangxue:''' Mm, this should do it. Chef, come over and have a taste, will you?
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Let me try...
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Mmmm, this flavor... so rich and fresh, but the mouthfeel resembles that of a tofu pudding...
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Looks quite presentable, too, and requires truly exquisite workmanship. The premise is also catchy &mdash; a meat dish that imitates vegetarian cuisine &mdash; I'm sure many would like to try it for themselves...
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Not bad! Not bad at all! I'm sure it'll be to the innkeeper's taste.
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' What a surprise! Turns out you're more capable than I gave you credit for. Who knew a sponger like you would remember this recipe so well.
:'''Jiangxue:''' Haha. I might as well tell you: back in the day, I thought that this recipe contained some sort of secret sword art, so I studied it day and night without ceasing...
:'''Jiangxue:''' Now that I think about it, I must have been an absolute madman. It was just a recipe, why would there be anything about swordsmanship in it?
:{{DIcon}} And all that practice, for...
:'''Jiangxue:''' To look for someone and to ask for justice, that's all.
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Hah! That was a magnificent deed! And here you are, speaking so softly about it.
:'''Jiangxue:''' Haha. Well, once I'd exacted that justice, I came here. Thankfully, the innkeeper was willing to take me in and let me loaf about the place.
:'''Jiangxue:''' I am now free of desire. I no longer wish to wield my sword, nor do I have any other skills... Hahaha, I suppose staying here for the rest of my life isn't so bad.
:'''Jiangxue:''' Well now, I suppose I should give you a copy of this recipe. You can make it for yourself if you have the time. It's a little troublesome, but it tastes pretty good.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you.
:{{DIcon}} Will you continue staying here?
::'''Jiangxue:''' Of course. I never get tired of our good chef's great food.
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Hmm... Well, let's put this dish aside. We can show it to the innkeeper once he gets here.
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' And after that... hey, hey, Mr. Loafer, don't you go anywhere just yet. Come over here.
:'''Jiangxue:''' Oh, what do you want? I don't have another recipe for you, just so you know.
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Come on. Didn't you say that you didn't have any skills apart from wielding your sword? Well then, draw that sword, I'm teaching you to chop meat.
:'''Jiangxue:''' Chop meat? I... Well, I'm afraid...
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' You'll get it pretty quickly. Chop meat today, make a dish tomorrow. Learn yourself a few of those, and there, you've got a skill.
:'''Jiangxue:''' What are you...
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Hmph. A few dishes under your belt, yes &mdash; that'll spare me the need to watch you scrap for food around here, that's for sure.
:'''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Well, come on then, don't drag your feet. You dilly-dally some more, and you can forget having any meatballs to eat tomorrow!
:'''Jiangxue:''' Wait, what? Come on, you can't threaten me like that... Alright, alright, I'll chop them. I'll chop them!
