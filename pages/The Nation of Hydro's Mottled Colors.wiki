|description    = A countryside scene full of luxurious plants. It contains all sorts of flowers and bushes that can be found everywhere in Fontaine. Flowers and plants are common themes in paintings, and are a starting point for explorations into "color." Some painters in Fontaine believe that the world's palette uses plants to demonstrate the perfect combination of colors. As such, if all the colors in a painting may find their source in flowers, then this painting must surely have harmonious beauty equal to that of natural scenery. Of course, this is predicated on you not mixing all plant-derived colors together in a single conversation...
