==Profile==
During the [[The Rainbow Destined to Burn|abyssal invasion]] of Natlan, Mutota oversaw his tribe's defense against the [[Abyss]], though they had suffered immense casualties. After the invasion, he accepted help from [[Iansan]] for recovery efforts and sent people to the wilderness to clear off any remaining monsters. During the chase, his people found others who had been presumed dead, but had survived, albeit with severe abyssal contamination. The Traveler and Paimon, wanting to help out, met with Mutota and helped those suffering from trauma, which he greatly appreciated.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|For the Same Land}}</ref>

After resolving the cases, Mutota would later learn that tensions were rising in the tribe after a [[qucusaurus|qucusaur]] began attacking people and the introduction of Phlogiston Wings, which forsook the traditions that the tribe valued. Mutota asked the Traveler and Chasca to investigate on his behalf and learned that the technology was based on [[Ochkanatlan]]'s, much to his disdain. Later, he was busy coaching two Wingless, [[Coyllur]] and [[Zhunan]], when the elder [[Allpa]] attempted to stage a coup by having him apprehended. The coup failed to gain ground, as Allpa was defeated by the Traveler and Chasca, while her lackeys failed to capture him (since he had left) and he quickly rallied resistance. Mutota was upset that he didn't catch Allpa's plot sooner, as many qucusaurs had been hurt in her plot. He then had his people disassemble the floating workshop and repurposed a harmless part of it to serve as a jail for Allpa and her lackeys.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Time for the Showdown}}</ref>

:'''Mutota:''' Patience is the key to solving problems... as is ensuring safety.
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
::'''Mutota:''' Hello there. Welcome to the Flower-Feather Clan.
::'''Mutota:''' As the chief, I don't want to seem to strict or lay too many rules down, but living here does take a little care and patience.
::'''Mutota:''' The Qucusaurus is the proudest [[Saurian]] in Natlan, as are many of their riders.
::'''Mutota:''' But once they're in battle, people soon discover that arrogance is no help in attaining victory.
::'''Mutota:''' Scars may be a warrior's badge of honor, but they're also a reminder of mistakes made.
::'''Mutota:''' ...I'm sorry. Have I been blabbing on too long? What I meant to say is: Please be extra careful.
:{{DIcon}} We meet again. ''(Available after completing ''[[For the Same Land]]'')''
::'''Mutota:''' Oh, it's you guys. Welcome. I trust that you're in good health, or are you suffering any aftereffects from the Abyss?
::'''Mutota:''' Thank you so much for helping us when we were short-handed. If it weren't for you, our tribe would never have recovered so soon.
::'''Mutota:''' Despite the threat of the Abyss having abated, there will always be danger lurking somewhere in this world. 
::'''Mutota:''' But you can't just rush in head first at any cost just because you're tough, okay? That's the easiest way for a warrior to make a mistake.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Thanks for the reminder.
:::'''Mutota:''' Don't mention it.
:::'''Mutota:''' Learning to fly takes guts, but you also need keen eyesight.
