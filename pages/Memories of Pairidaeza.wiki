==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After the Flower Î’ud stops for the first time)
:'''Paimon:''' It stopped... Is that because there's something in the way up ahead?

;(After the Flower Bud moves again after stopping for the first time)
:'''Paimon:''' Look! It's moving again!

;(Attempting to move the Flower Bud when it is still blocked)
:'''The bud's route seems to be blocked by something...'''

;(Read the Floral Throne before embedding the memories)
:'''Floral Throne:''' "...Seek the blossom of eternity, and reclaim memories long-lost..."
:'''Floral Throne:''' (You notice a letter missing from each inscription written on the three thrones...)
:'''Floral Throne:''' (Perhaps you can use the clues in the inscriptions to rediscover what was lost?)
