==A Librarian's Long and Carefree Vacation==
{{Transclude|A Librarian's Long and Carefree Vacation|Dialogue|main=1|top=1}}

==Open World Interaction Dialogue==
These dialogue lines were available on each day following the event's release, starting with the conversation at Lambad's Tavern on the second day. Lisa's location will change after each daily [[reset]], whether the player has spoken to her at the previous location or not.

===Lambad's Tavern===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Lisa on second floor of [[Lambad's Tavern]])
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Hey cutie, we meet again.
:{{DIcon}} This place sure wasn't easy to find.
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 02.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Oh, really? I used to live in Sumeru City and now that I'm back, I can't help but want to visit these small, remote shops.
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 03.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' It's a pity that my old favorite clothing shop has already been closed for some time.
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 04.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I wanted to buy some accessories and clothes to give to the other ladies in the Knights of Favonius. Hmm... what a pity.
:{{DIcon}} I see you bought some new clothes.
:{{DIcon}} Your new outfit looks great.
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 05.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I was wondering when you would notice. Well, what do you think?
:{{DIcon}} It's classy.
:{{DIcon}} Very elegant.
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 06.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' It's always nice to hear compliments from other people, especially you. Thank you, cutie.
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 07.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I managed to find the owner of that old clothing shop and had it custom tailored.
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 08.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Wearing it reminds me of my days at the Akademiya. What a busy time that was for me...
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 09.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' However, my researchers were never lazy, unlike the people who borrow books and don't return them. Now that I think of it, punishing them with a zap of Electro may have still been too lenient...

===Menakeri's Treasure Shop===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Lisa inside [[Menakeri's Treasure Shop]])
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 10.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Ah, it's you, cutie. I knew we'd cross paths again.
:{{DIcon}} What are you looking at, Lisa?
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 11.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Oh, just these painted utensils in this shop, aren't they exquisite? I'm thinking about buying some to take back for decoration.
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 12.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' And those plates... if we serve tea on them, Jean wouldn't be able to resist, even in the middle of work.
:{{DIcon}} I don't think those are for sale.
:{{DIcon}} I think those are only for display.
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 13.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Oh, not for sale? Honestly, why put it in the shop if you don't intend to sell it?
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 14.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' How disappointing! Ah, they're so beautiful, too...

===Grand Bazaar===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Lisa in front of [[Sulaykha]]'s Blanket Shop in the [[Grand Bazaar]])
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 15.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Hey cutie, are you here at the Grand Bazaar to catch some performances?
:{{DIcon}} Do you like the performances here?
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 16.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Yes, they are quite amusing. I even wonder if I should start taking notes on the formats of some of the programs. Who knows? Perhaps it'll come in handy for the next [[Ludi Harpastum]].
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 17.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Kaeya could take charge of the jokes, but dancing might prove to be a little tricky.
:{{DIcon}} Have you seen the dancing here before?
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 18.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Yes, there was [[Nilou|a lovely girl with red hair]] dancing yesterday. I had a front row seat, it was really something.
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 19.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I can't help but wonder how great it would be to see similar performances in Mondstadt.
:{{DIcon}} You just have to convince Nilou to perform in Mondstadt.
:{{DIcon}} That might be a challenge.
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 20.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Actually, I think the biggest challenge would be to get [[Eula]], Captain of the Reconnaissance Company, to show some interest in dancing, as well as to find a beautiful outfit she would agree to wear.
:{{DIcon}} So you're trying to get Eula involved?
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 21.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Eula is surprisingly gullible when it comes to certain things. Rather than inviting the performers to Mondstadt, it would be easier to trick... ah, I mean, ask her to dance.

===The Akademiya===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Lisa on the path to the [[The Akademiya]])
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 22.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Hey! What are you doing around the Akademiya?
:{{DIcon}} Are you on your way into the Akademiya?
::{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 23a 1.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Actually, I was just leaving.
:{{DIcon}} Oh, so you were on your way out, then?
::{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 23b 1.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Mh-hmm, and that's when I ran into you. 
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 24.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I had a reunion with Professor Cyrus and some fellow apprentices, as well as other reseachers that I worked with in the past.
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 25.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' How time flies! I could tell just from their appearances that they've been really busy.
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 26.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I, on the other hand, have had it pretty easy. Hahaha... they must be so jealous. 
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 27.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' That being said, since I've already indulged so much, I should probably eat less cake next month.

===Gandharva Ville #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Lisa near [[Gandharva Ville]])
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 28.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Its name is Sag? Oh, what a nice puppy.
:{{DIcon}} Do you like search and rescue dogs?
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 29.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Of course. I love obedient puppies, especially the ones that let you rub their belly and look at you with their little sparkling eyes.
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 30.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Actually, I've always wanted to get a dog. Not only could it help keep me in a good mood, but it could also intimidate others when need be.
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 31.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' But if I got a dog, it'd be too much hassle to groom it and clean up after it all the time.
:{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 32.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' That's the trouble with pets. I suppose I'm not really suited to have one.

;(Talk to Amir)
:'''Amir:''' These guys just love running about when they aren't working.
:'''Amir:''' I hope they pay close attention to that girl's condition and report any changes immediately.
:{{DIcon}} About the lady beside you...
::'''Amir:''' Hey, keep it down! You mean that lady over there named Lisa?
::'''Amir:''' Lisa... Lisa, what a beautiful, elegant name.
::'''Amir:''' Too bad you didn't see it. She spoke to me just now, asking about Sag's name, hehe...
::'''Amir:''' She also seems to have a love for animals. But she doesn't seem to know how to deal with them.
::'''Amir:''' I could tell by the way she had just touched Sag, but it doesn't matter. I can teach her.
::'''Amir:''' We could raise lots of dogs together...
::'''Amir:''' ...
::'''Amir:''' (He gets lost in thought talking to himself.)

===Gandharva Ville #2===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Collei, optional)
:{{A|vo lxeq001 4 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' (Aww ...Why didn't Amber come? *sigh* So... how should I ask Lisa about Amber? Ahh, what should I do...)

;(Talk to Collei or Lisa near Collei's house)
;(If {{cx}} has been completed)
::{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Don't worry, Lisa. I'm fine now.
::{{DIcon}} Greetings.
::{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' It's {{Traveler}}! Whatcha doing here?
::{{DIcon}} Here to see you, Collei.
::{{DIcon}} And we meet again, Lisa.
::{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 33.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Do you come to visit Collei often, cutie?
::{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 collei 03a.ogg}} {{A|vo dialog lxeq002 collei 03b.ogg}} '''Collei:''' {{MC|m=He|f=She}}'s amazing. All of us in Gandharva Ville already have a lot to thank {{MC|m=him|f=her}} for.
::{{DIcon}} Collei and I are very good friends.
::{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 34.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Well then, it seems my little Collei has been making some new friends in Sumeru.
::{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' And I've been doing my best to learn how to read. Now I can even read some simple sentences!
::{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Master and everyone in Sumeru has taken good care of me, but I've never forgotten my friends in Mondstadt. I've actually been thinking about taking some time to go back for a visit.
::{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 collei 06.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Miss Lisa, how's everyone doing? Well, I hope? What about Amber? And Kaeya? Oh, and Jean?
::{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 35.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Haha, slow down, Collei. I'll tell you all about them...
::{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 36.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Sorry, darling, seems I'll need some time here. I want to tell Collei about what's happening in Mondstadt.
;(If {{cx}} has not been completed)
::{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 collei 07.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Don't worry, Lisa. I'm fine now.
::{{DIcon}} Greetings.
::{{DIcon}} And we meet again, Lisa.
::{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 37.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I came here to visit an old friend, but I had no idea that she'd already become a Trainee Forest Ranger.
::{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 collei 08.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Hehe, it's nothing, really. I just wanted to help out Master Tighnari.
::{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 38.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Well then, it seems my little Collei has been making some new friends in Sumeru.
::{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 collei 09.ogg}} '''Collei:''' And I've been doing my best to learn how to read. Now I can even read some simple sentences!
::{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 collei 10.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Master and everyone in Sumeru has taken good care of me, but I've never forgotten my friends in Mondstadt. I've actually been thinking about taking some time to go back for a visit.
::{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 collei 11.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Miss Lisa, how's everyone doing? Well, I hope? What about Amber? And Jean? Oh, and Kaeya...
::{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 39.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Haha, slow down, Collei. I'll tell you all about them...
::{{A|vo dialog lxeq002 lisa 40.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Sorry, darling, seems I'll need some time here. I want to tell Collei about what's happening in Mondstadt.
