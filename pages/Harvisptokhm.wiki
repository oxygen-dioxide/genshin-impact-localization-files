==Descriptions==
{{Description/Viewpoint|Harvisptokhm}}

==Lore==
[[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] grew the Harvisptokhm from the Amrita, which are the remains of [[Egeria]], the previous Hydro Archon, after she was slain during the [[cataclysm]].<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Vibrant Pinion}}</ref> The Harvisptokhm thus anchored Egeria's consciousness to the mortal realm,<ref name="Splendorous">{{Ref/Quest|The Splendorous Sky That Day}}</ref> allowing it to maintain the seal on the [[Abyss]]al rift in [[Tunigi Hollow]] by absorbing the defilement emanating from it. Inside the Harvisptokhm lies the giant lotus Gaokerena, and the God of the Pari's consciousness slumbers within it. During the events of [[Khvarena of Good and Evil]], the [[Traveler]] cleanses the defilement from it through the Rite of Ab-Zohr.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Hymn of Tir Yazad (Part 1)}}</ref>

The [[Oceanid]]s, who served and were created by Egeria, did not accept the ideals of the new Hydro Archon [[Focalors]],<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Life Flows On (II)}}</ref> and so came to Tunigi Hollow in search of their master. However, after seeing that the Harvisptokhm was not what they had hoped to find, they scattered in different ways. People followed their pilgrimage trail,<ref name="Pale">{{Ref/Quest|Pale Fire (Quest)}}</ref> however, eventually establishing the [[Purification Spring]] domain.

==Trivia==
* After the completion of ''[[The Hymn of Tir Yazad (Part 2)]]'', the Sign of Apaosha is sealed and a towering tree of pure Amrita grows on top of Harvisptokhm.

===Etymology===
* In Zoroastrianism, the Harvisptokhm {{lang|fa=}} is the "tree of all seeds" that grows within the cosmic sea, the Vourukasha. Within it grows the {{W|Gaokerena}}, or "White {{w|Haoma}}", and the {{w|Simurgh}} lives atop the tree, spreading the seeds.
