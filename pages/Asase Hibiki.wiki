{{Lang|'''Asase Hibiki'''|ja=浅瀬響|ja_rm=Asase Hibiki}} was a shrine maiden who lived around five hundred years ago.<ref group="Note">A [[Nazuchi Beach#Pirate's Diary #4|Pirate's Diary]] on [[Nazuchi Beach]], written by present-day pirates, states that [[Ako Domeki]] lived five hundred years ago.

[[Shimenawa's Reminiscence]] and the [[Storm Cage]] piece in [[Emblem of Severed Fate]] are told from Hibiki's point of view. She was also the wielder of [[Hamayumi]], and came into possession of [[Thundering Pulse]] as part of her wager with Takamine.

==Profile==
===Personality===
In her younger years, Hibiki was something of a country bumpkin with the "obstinate impulsiveness and curiosity of a child," constantly skeptical of the Kitsune Saiguu's enigmatic words. She was also something of a {{w|tsundere}} towards Takamine, calling him an "idiot" and a "rude and reckless brute" to hide her feelings for him.<ref name="ShiRem" /><ref name="ESF" /> [[Neko|Lady Neko]] would eventually name cats "Konbumaru" (Takamine's nickname) because she knew from Hibiki's facial expression when she mentioned the name that it was something positive. Ako Domeki affectionately called her "naggy and fretful".<ref name=":0">{{Ref/Weapon|"The Catch"}}</ref>

==Story==
In her youth, Hibiki went from the Asase Shrine to the Narukami Shrine. While initially distrustful of the Kitsune Saiguu, she eventually came to hold great respect for the other woman. She also became acquainted with Takamine, whom she called "the idiot Konbumaru" to hide her affection towards him. Nonetheless, the attraction was mutual, and two grew close: he taught her the [[tengu]] archery he had learned, while she made an undisclosed promise<ref group="Note">Given how the elderly Hibiki eventually entrusted Ako Domeki (who resembled young Takamine very much) with a wish to see the world, it is possible that her promise to Takamine involved seeing the world outside Inazuma together.</ref> to him.<ref name="ShiRem" />

Takamine eventually became a {{w|Hatamoto}} for the Raiden Shogun [[Baal]]. Despite his attraction to Hibiki, he married a high-ranking samurai's daughter instead. Much to Hibiki's consternation, he never lost his habit of wandering or gambling despite his rank and marital status.<ref name="ESF" />

===The Cataclysm===
When the cataclysm befell the land and dark forces threatened all of [[Teyvat]], [[Takamine the Mistsplitter|Takamine]] and [[Chiyo]] of the [[Mikoshi Clan]] were among those who embarked on an expedition alongside Baal to the [[abyss]].<ref group="Note">Weapon Ascension Material: [[Mask of the One-Horned]]<br />''He [Torachiyo] was once a beloved lieutenant of the Shogun, and he followed her into the dark abyssal realms to repel the defiled ones [...]''; [[Mask of the Kijin]] reveals that the story of "Torachiyo" is actually Chiyo's story, distorted over time.</ref><ref name="ThunPulse">{{Ref/Weapon|Thundering Pulse}}</ref> He promised his "future" to Hibiki by entrusting his bow to her as a wager for his triumphant return.<ref name="ShiRem" /><ref name="ThunPulse" /><ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Mistsplitter Reforged}}</ref>

However, this would never come to pass. Takamine disappeared in battle; Chiyo was consumed by a "beast of sin" and despite emerging victorious against the creature, went mad and drew her blade on Baal.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Mask of the Kijin}}</ref> This betrayal tarnished the Mikoshi Clan's reputation, leading her biological son [[Iwakura Doukei]] to abandon his family name<ref name="ESF" /> and her adoptive son [[Mikoshi Nagamasa]] to join the Shogunate to restore his family's honor.<ref name="ShiRem" /><ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Katsuragikiri Nagamasa}}</ref> The Kitsune Saiguu, too, disappeared and eventually perished against the dark forces.<ref name="Hakushin Ring" /> The Great Tengu, who had been the Kitsune Saiguu's protector, went on a self-imposed exile for her failure and [[Kamuna Harunosuke]] left Inazuma out of his grief and rage.<ref name="ShiRem" />

===After the Cataclysm===
''Note: The order in which the following events occurred is currently unknown.''

Some time after the events of the cataclysm ended, Takamine finally emerged from the abyss (possibly corrupted) and returned to Inazuma to fulfill his promise to reunite with Hibiki, but Hibiki slew him with her bow.<ref name="ThunPulse" /> Hibiki appears to have viewed this act as "saving" him.<ref name="ThunPulse" />

Later, Hibiki would retire back to her birthplace at Seirai Island. There she managed the smaller Asase Shrine with the help of Lady Neko as well as the pirate captain Ako Domeki. She told them stories of her past and of her wish to go see the world, though she never mentioned the tragic endings of Takamine and her other friends.<ref name=":0" />

During Domeki's and Seirai Island's rebellion against the Shogunate several years after the cataclysm, Hibiki chose to assist him due to their friendship and his resemblance to Takamine. She decided to use the "true magic'" she learned from the Yougou Tengu to unseal the great barrier containing the resentment of the "[[Kanna Kapatcir|violet glede]]" and use it to destroy the Shogunate's ships.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Hamayumi}}</ref> This decision resulted in the catastrophe that caused the massive Electro storm over Seirai Island,<ref name="ESF" /> and may have eventually cost Hibiki her life, as she never returned from that storm.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Seirai Stormchasers: Part I}}</ref>

While Ako Domeki and his fleet also went into the storm, Domeki and some of his crew survived. His chief mate [[Janome]] and the ship carrying the Maguu Kenki he defeated were blown away to the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]] while protecting him. What exactly happened to Domeki is unknown, but he eventually made his way back to Seirai Island, only to find it in its current inhospitable state. He made a vow to Janome and Hibiki to live as the "freest person in the world" and experience the world like Hibiki had always wished to, and set off for parts unknown.<ref name=":0" />

==Trivia==
* Because the kanji used for Hibiki's name ({{Lang|mini=1|ja=響}}) has multiple possible readings, the English localization and some other localizations initially translated her name as "Kanade." In Version 2.1, the English localization switched to using Hibiki.
*Ako Domeki addresses Asase as his "Aunt", but it is left ambiguous whether the two are actually blood-related or if he is using an affectionate term out of courtesy for an older woman.
