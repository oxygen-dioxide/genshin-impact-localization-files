==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Zhi:''' Hello. How may I help you?
:{{DIcon}} What are you up to?
::'''Zhi:''' Ah, I'm memorizing the names of herbs.
::'''Zhi:''' I mean, when you go picking herbs in the mountains, if you don't even know what you're picking, wouldn't that be something of a joke?
:{{DIcon}} Do you live around here?
::'''Zhi:''' Yes. Many people my age have gone to Liyue Harbor to work or settle down. I, however, have decided to stay here.
::'''Zhi:''' I guess I was born with the nose of the mountain people. I just can't get used to the sea-salt tinge and the flavors of a city by the shore.
::'''Zhi:''' What's more, the older folks in the village can't quite walk well anymore, so I have to help them pick herbs.
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it, then.
::'''Zhi:''' See you, and watch your step!
