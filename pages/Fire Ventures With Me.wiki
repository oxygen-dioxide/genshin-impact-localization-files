'''Fire Ventures With Me''' is [[Bennett]]'s [[Level 6 Constellation]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* Bennett's Pyro infusion will override [[Chongyun]]'s [[Spirit Blade: Chonghua's Layered Frost]], [[Keqing]]'s [[Stellar Restoration]] from her [[Thundering Penance|1st Passive Talent]], and [[Kamisato Ayaka]]'s Cryo infusion from [[Kamisato Art: Senho]]. (See [[Elemental Infusion#Overriding Infusions|Overriding Infusions]] for details)
* Although the description specifies that the 15% {{Color|Pyro DMG}} buff only applies to Sword, Claymore, or Polearm-wielding characters, the buff instead applies to any and all character inside Fantastic Voyage's radius, regardless of their wielded weapon. The infusion, however, only applies to Sword-, Claymore- and Polearm-wielding characters as stated.
* Despite what the description states, the {{Color|Pyro Infusion}} and {{Color|Pyro DMG bonus}} are not applied immediately when the character enters the AoE of Inspiration Field created by Fantastic Voyage. Instead they are applied periodically to characters inside the AoE every time Inspiration Field's healing over time or ATK bonus activate. They both have a duration of 2.1s.
