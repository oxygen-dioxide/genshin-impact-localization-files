: {{DIcon|Idle}} Join the [[Marechaussee Phantom]]...
:: {{A|VO Thirona 01.ogg}} "I really hope I can get into the Marechausee Phantom..."

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Thirona:''' Heh! If [[Granna]] wants to join the Marechaussee Phantom someday, I guess I need to do my best too... Well, just a little bit...
:{{DIcon}} Why do you want to join up?
::'''Thirona:''' Well, if I had to mention something, I don't really want to... That's more Granna's line of thought.
::'''Thirona:''' She's a bit impulsive and rough around the edges when doing stuff, and she's very competitive &mdash; but that's what's cute about her, you know?
::'''Thirona:''' I'd be quite worried for her if she really did manage to join, though.
::'''Thirona:''' As such, if she wants in, then I want in along with her.
:{{DIcon}} I wish you success.
::'''Thirona:''' Haha. Well, I think wishing her success might be a better place to start...
