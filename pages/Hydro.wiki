'''Hydro''' is one of the seven [[Elements]].

Its associated [[Archon]] is the [[God of Justice]], whose domain is [[Fontaine]].

==Elemental Resonance==
Having two Hydro characters in the group results in the [[Elemental Resonance]]:
*'''Soothing Water:''' Affected by Pyro for 40% less time. Increases incoming healing by 30%.

==Elemental Reactions==
{{Hydro}} has the following [[Elemental Reactions]]:

*{{Icon/Element|Electro}} '''[[Electro-Charged]]:''' Deals {{Color|Electro DMG}} and high [[Poise Damage]] over time to all nearby targets with the Wet status.
*{{Icon/Element|Cryo}} '''[[Frozen]]:''' Immobilizes the target. Hitting a Frozen target with a [[Blunt Attack]] will cause Shattered, dealing {{Color|Physical DMG}}.
*{{Icon/Element|Pyro}} '''[[Vaporize]]:''' Deals ×2 {{Color|Hydro DMG}} when a Hydro attack triggers the reaction.
*{{Icon/Element|Anemo}} '''[[Swirl]]:''' Deals {{Color|Non-AoE Hydro DMG}} while spreading the Wet status to nearby enemies.
*{{Icon/Element|Geo}} '''[[Crystallize]]:''' Creates a Hydro shard. Picking it up creates a Hydro shield around the character.

The elemental reaction [[Bloom]] is expected to come with the [[Version 3.0]] update, after the release of [[Sumeru]].<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/6DjVUfy_Lng Sumeru Preview Teaser 01: The Fascinating Dendro Element | Genshin Impact]</ref>

==Wet Status==
{{Color|Wet}} itself does not have any special effects; it is simply considered the application of {{Hydro}}. However, being affected by {{Color|Wet}} allows Hydro Elemental Reactions to occur.

Any source of {{Color|Hydro DMG}} will apply {{Color|Wet}}. It will also be applied during [[Weather#Rain|rain]] and upon coming in contact with bodies of water.

===Wet Status to Self===
The following [[Talents]] apply the {{Color|Wet}} status to its user and/or the active character.

*Any bodies of [[water]] (such as ponds, lakes, puddles, etc.)
*Rainy [[weather]]
*[[Hydro Amber]]

==Notes==
*[[Cryo Slime]]s can be wet, and will swirl the Hydro element on them. This status does not show until [[Swirl]]ed with [[Anemo]] and only briefly. Hydro attacks as well as the splashes of nearby [[Hydro Slime]] or being trapped in bubbles can cause this status.
