{{Stub Dialogue|Verify conditions for the two dialogue sets.
* ''[[Nahuatzin's Leap]]'' can be completed without ever starting ''[[The Way Into the Mountain]]''. In that scenario, the moment ''Nahuatzin's Leap'' is completed, ''The Way Into the Mountain'' becomes inaccessible, and Dialogue Set #2 becomes available.
* Set #1 appears to be "talk again" dialogue for ''[[The Way Into the Mountain]]''; presumably, if you're able to see Set #1, then there should be a point when Set #1 is replaced by Set #2, right?}}

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Duniya:''' So, {{Traveler}}... What would you like to know?
:{{DIcon}} About the excavation site...
::'''Duniya:''' Oh, it should really be called the Remnants of the Secret Source excavation site. It's a large area of ruins to the south of the Sacred Mountain.
::'''Duniya:''' It's said that they were abandoned by dragons, long, long ago. Old Man Mposo patrols the area daily to keep marauding [[Treasure Hoarders]] away...
::'''Duniya:''' He used to be interested in ruins and relics. He even joined the [[Saurian Relics Association (Faction)|Saurian Relics Association]] back in the day. He likes to tell us all stories of the past.
::'''Dutse:''' But he's no good at storytelling &mdash; he's just so boooring. It's all dusty old details, like seeing "referential" totems in patterns on the stone...
::'''Duniya:''' I think you mean "reverential" totems... Old Man Mposo's more of an archaeologist than a storyteller...
::'''Duniya:''' Apparently, he once explored the volcano itself. He might just be able to help you out.
:;(Returns to dialogue option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About the Tephric Ruins...
::'''Dutse:''' Aha! So, you want to know about the Tephric Ruins? Now, that's something I do know about!
::'''Dutse:''' Long, long ago... back when Natlan was still a peaceful paradise...
::'''Duniya:''' Ah, actually, it was [[cataclysm|500 years ago]], just as the [[Abyss]]al corrosion in Natlan was at its worst &mdash; an entire section of ruins was spat out by the volcano.
::'''Dutse:''' Oh, come on, Duniya, why do you always have to interrupt my story!?
::'''Duniya:''' Because every time you tell this one, you always start with this "Long, long ago" stuff... No one wants to hear it!
::'''Dutse:''' ...I mean, that's how Uncle Kimosi told me the story, and he was a member of the exploration team assembled by the Speaker's Chamber!
::'''Dutse:''' I've heard there've been traces of the Abyss discovered around the Tephric Ruins again recently. I wonder how Uncle Kimosi's doing...
::'''Dutse:''' If you do go there, can you check on how he's doing for me?
:;(Returns to dialogue option selection)
:{{DIcon}} I have no more questions.
::'''Duniya:''' Then I wish you a successful journey!
::'''Dutse:''' Hehe, drop by again!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''{{cx}}''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Duniya:''' Oh hey, are you here to hang out with us? Shame we can't go out right now, since the volcano's in its eruption cycle and all.
:'''Dutse:''' There's not much fun stuff to do in the tribe either... all the adults are good for is training and wrestling. Maybe we should take our guest and sneak out...
:'''Duniya:''' Dutse! No using guests as an excuse!
:'''Dutse:''' Pff. F&mdash;Fine...
