|desc_suspicious = A strange-looking meal barely held together by the humble Grainfruit. The blackened outer shell reminds you of the importance of heat control. Considering the time and effort you spent gathering the ingredients... Maybe the inside's not as burnt. Perhaps it's still worth a try?
|desc_basic      = A rich and comforting meal held together by the humble Grainfruit. Minced meat is stir-fried and placed in a baking pan with larger chunks of meat and eggs. The whole thing is then covered with a layer of mashed Grainfruit and baked until a tantalizing golden brown. This hearty dish can often be found on the tables of the Collective of Plenty during harvest festivals.
|desc_delicious  = A luxurious, flavor-packed meal held together by the humble Grainfruit. Your anticipation soars even as the oven's heat does, and once you taste it, the sweetness of Grainfruit and the savoriness of the minced meat break out into a joyful dance on your taste buds... Huh, your hands and legs are instinctively swaying along to the beat.
