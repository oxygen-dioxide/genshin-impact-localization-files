{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach Schubert)
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (The tent seems to be pretty tattered, but there's a really fancy chair...)
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Could this be another aristocratic custom?)
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 schubert 01.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Ah, it's you again. I thought I had rid myself of you two.
:{{DIcon}} We have heard that aristocrats are most magnanimous.
::{{A|vo ellq003 1 schubert 02a.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Magnanimous... Yes, indeed that is true.
:{{DIcon}} Please, if I may be so bold as to say a few humble words...
::{{A|vo ellq003 1 schubert 02b.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' "A few humble words," eh? Yes, that sounds appropriate enough.
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 schubert 03.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Very well, I'm certainly not one to be narrow-minded. I'll overlook your previous misconduct for now and listen to what you have to say.
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Wow, this guy thinks so highly of himself!)
:{{DIcon}} Before I go further, I wish to express my will of resistance.
::{{A|vo ellq003 1 schubert 04a.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Ah, a kindred spirit, I see. Yes, we must resist the blundering Knights of Favonius. You are true and principled.
:{{DIcon}} It is an honor to stand before you here, immersed in your supreme brilliance.
::{{A|vo ellq003 1 schubert 04b.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' It appears I have misjudged you. "Supreme brilliance" &mdash; the glory of the nobility that continues to this day. A true loyalist!
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 schubert 05.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Impressive, my intentions were to test your humility. It appears you have become well-versed in our etiquette.
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Oh, so he was testing us... Sheesh, what an ordeal!)
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 schubert 06.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Your conduct is satisfactory. I must say, such a progress in such a short time is practically unfathomable.
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 schubert 07.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' If I may ask, from whence did you learn such a civilized manner of speech?
:{{DIcon}} I was fortunate enough to benefit from the knowledge of a dear friend.
:{{DIcon}} I refined my conduct with some instruction in the classics, courtesy of a dear friend.
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 schubert 08.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Ah good, very good. You are bright, and compared with the common folk of Mondstadt, you certainly have potential. If you were of aristocratic blood, your prospects would be promising indeed!
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' By the way, we brought a gift! Ahem... Paimon means, we would like to present you with a small token of our goodwill.
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 schubert 09.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Huh? Could this be... Gebratenes Fleisch mit Sauerkraut!?
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 schubert 10.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' It's evident that your sentiment is genuine. As a young person nowadays, only with no small effort could you achieve such a dish.
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 schubert 11.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' It's been so long since I dug into a big tasty&mdash; ... I beg your pardon. What I mean to say is, since it's nearly mealtime, I shall partake.

:'''''Schubert relishes the Gebratenes Fleisch mit Sauerkraut.'''''

:{{A|vo ellq003 1 schubert 12.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Ah yes, this aroma, just as I remember it. And this exquisite sour flavor... Mmm. A delicacy that only us noblemen and women could appreciate.
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Now even Paimon's starting to wonder what it tastes like...
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 schubert 13.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' I acknowledge your genuine goodwill. Such sincerity must certainly imply that you come bearing a request.
:{{DIcon}} It seems there's word that the Lawrence family has a grand scheme of sorts.
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 schubert 14.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Wait, so you've come to know of this, too? It was meant to be a family secret...
:{{DIcon}} I wish to lend you a helping hand.
:{{DIcon}} I would like to do what I can for the nobility.
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 schubert 15.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 schubert 16.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Well, considering your meticulous etiquette, you must be a talent of unusual fortitude. I'm willing to place my full trust in you.
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 schubert 17.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Please, come with me. We happen to be in need of competent fellows just like yourself.
:{{DIcon}} Where are we going?
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 schubert 18.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' To see some friends from a distant land. They have offered their assistance in restoring the Lawrence Clan to its former glory.
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So he trusts us solely based on your etiquette...
:{{DIcon}} I think we need to be careful.
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps this is what the old aristocrats see as most important.
:{{A|vo ellq003 1 schubert 19.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Well then, let's get going, shall we? You'll understand everything in due course.

;(After talking to Schubert)
:{{A|vo ellq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you think his "friends" are the Fatui?
:{{A|vo ellq003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Things will get sticky if the Fatui happen to recognize you. What should we do?

;(Observe the chair)
:'''Observe Chair:''' (This fancy chair really stands out in front of such an old tattered tent.)
:'''Observe Chair:''' (Schubert must really treasure this chair. Only a true aristocrat would bother maintaining luxury items in circumstances like this.)

----

;(Enter the [[Behind Enemy Lines|domain]])
:{{A|vo ellq003 3 schubert 01.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Huh? Why have you put on a mask all of a sudden?
:{{DIcon}} I don't wish to be seen by any strangers.
:{{DIcon}} It is only proper for aristocrats to wear a mask.
:{{A|vo ellq003 3 schubert 02.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Hmm, even if they are powerful, our status is much higher than theirs in the land of Mondstadt...
:{{A|vo ellq003 3 schubert 03.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' ...And therefore, we shouldn't allow them to admire our true faces so easily! I see, haha...
:{{A|vo ellq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good thinking, Paimon thought for sure they'd recognize us.
:{{A|vo ellq003 3 schubert 04.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Let's proceed, shall we? I'll introduce you as my guest.

;(Follow Schubert)
:{{A|vo ellq003 4 schubert 01.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' As you'll see in a moment, there are many already helping us.
:{{A|vo ellq003 4 schubert 02.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' I heard that this area has already been purged once by the Knights of Favonius, but it's the only place around Mondstadt that is well concealed and spacious enough.
:{{A|vo ellq003 4 schubert 03.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Although it has fallen into disrepair and does not suit the tastes of the nobility, we simply have to make do for now.
:{{A|vo ellq003 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, s&mdash;sorry, um... can we walk any faster?
:{{A|vo ellq003 4 schubert 04.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Of course not. An aristocrat always moves with grace in his steps, moving hurriedly is unacceptable.

;(Approach the room with the Fatui)
:{{A|vo ellq003 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' As expected, it's the Fatui!
:{{A|vo ellq003 4 schubert 05.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' As expected?
:{{A|vo ellq003 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... b&mdash;because we always see them around the city. Um... they must be... very powerful!
:{{A|vo ellq003 4 schubert 06.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Hmph, nothing more than foreign ruffians with power and the ability to flaunt it... But they are favorable business partners.

;(Talk to Pyotr)
:{{A|vo ellq003 4 pyotr 01.ogg}} '''Pyotr:''' Our preparations have been thorough...
:{{A|vo ellq003 4 pyotr 02.ogg}} '''Pyotr:''' ...But I still can't shake this uneasy feeling.

;(Talk to Boris)
:{{A|vo ellq003 4 boris 01.ogg}} '''Boris:''' Don't wander about if you don't have business being here.

;(Talk to Ivan)
:{{A|vo ellq003 4 ivan 01.ogg}} '''Ivan:''' Who are you?
:{{A|vo ellq003 4 ivan 02.ogg}} '''Ivan:''' Just because someone brought you here, don't think you can wander around.

;(Approach Daler with Schubert)
:{{A|vo ellq003 5 daler 01.ogg}} '''Daler:''' Hold it right there. Who's this?
:{{A|vo ellq003 5 schubert 01.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' If you really must know...
:{{A|vo ellq003 5 schubert 02.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' They're my guests. If you happen to offend them in even the slightest, then you will be held accountable by the Lawrence Clan.
:{{A|vo ellq003 5 daler 02.ogg}} '''Daler:''' But this matter is of utmost secrecy, we must exercise caution.
:{{A|vo ellq003 5 schubert 03.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' You dare question the ways of a nobleman? I don't have time for this. Make way!
:{{A|vo ellq003 5 daler 03.ogg}} '''Daler:''' No need to sound all high and mighty like that...
:{{A|vo ellq003 5 daler 04.ogg}} '''Daler:''' Fine, you may proceed.

;(Keep following Schubert)
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good thing you're with us, they don't dare to question you...
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 01.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Of course, that is the benefit of prestige. In past times, it would be a dire offense to speak to a nobleman in such a manner.
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 02.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' We could determine a person's fate with the blink of an eye.
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 03.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Hmph, and such glory will return to me again before long.

;(Approach Sergei with Schubert)
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 sergey 01.ogg}} '''Sergei:''' (Huh, where have I seen this person before...?)
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 sergey 02.ogg}} '''Sergei:''' And who, may I ask, is this? We mustn't bring just anyone in here.
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 04a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 04b.ogg}}--> '''Schubert:''' This is our new ally that I've recently met. They are completely trustworthy, you have the word of the Lawrence Clan.
:{{DIcon}} It's a pleasure to meet you.
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 sergey 03.ogg}} '''Sergei:''' Our plans are strictly confidential. It's not wise to bring in an outsider at this time.
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 sergey 04.ogg}} '''Sergei:''' Furthermore, there's been word that an outlander who joined the Knights of Favonius has been very active in Mondstadt recently.
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 05a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 05b.ogg}}--> '''Schubert:''' Don't be ridiculous. Besides, my guest is well-versed in the etiquette of the nobility. I must treat them with the proper mutual respect.
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 06.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' The Knights of Favonius pay no regard to such details, they could never understand the intricacies of our etiquette.
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 sergey 05.ogg}} '''Sergei:''' And what about this... thing?
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh...? You mean Paimon?
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 07.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Enough! You dare question my word? Need I remind you who it is that has made your activity in Mondstadt possible?
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 08.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Without the support of the Lawrence Clan, you would have all been driven out by the Knights of Favonius like dogs.
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 09.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' You must immediately offer your sincerest apologies to my friend &mdash; you've offended their honor!
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 sergey 06.ogg}} '''Sergei:''' Tsk!
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 sergey 07.ogg}} '''Sergei:''' Fine. I'll take your word and make no further inquiries.
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 sergey 08.ogg}} '''Sergei:''' Now, to the matter at hand. Did you bring the diagram of Mondstadt's defenses, as promised?
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Oh... so that's what's going on here...!)
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 10.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Yes, of course. Here it is.
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 sergey 09.ogg}} '''Sergei:''' Let me see... Huh. Why is it so poorly drawn? Everything's so squiggly and crooked. And what is this shape supposed to be?
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 11.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Excuse me? I'll have you know that I went to great lengths to carefully draw this map by hand myself!
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 12.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' That "shape" is the symbol of the Knights of Favonius.
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 sergey 10.ogg}} '''Sergei:''' Ah, I see. Crude, but I can make do. Are you able to verify that this is all reliable information?
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 13.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Of course, you needn't worry about that. Don't forget what we agreed upon, the flag of the Lawrence Clan will fly above the Knights of Favonius Headquarters.
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 14.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' The rights to that building as well as the whole of Mondstadt belong to the Lawrence Clan.
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 sergey 11.ogg}} '''Sergei:''' Yes, yes, we will both profit from this agreement. There's no use haggling over the details.
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 sergey 12.ogg}} '''Sergei:''' We will make good use of the intel you provided. Also, be certain not to divulge our identity. There would be diplomatic consequences, you know.
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 15.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Don't worry. This matter is only between you and I... and my new friend here. No one else will know of it.
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 16.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Once this is over, I shall stand atop the Favonius Headquarters and rebuke their pathetic rule over Mondstadt. Then, the city and all its people will once again be under the rightful and unwavering rule of the Lawrence Clan!
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 17.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Haha, perfect! Just as it once was, and just as it should be!
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 sergey 13.ogg}} '''Sergei:''' *sigh*...
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 sergey 14.ogg}} '''Sergei:''' May I remind you once again that we mustn't act rashly. That is all... for now.
:{{DIcon}} Very well.
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Very well.
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 18.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Huh, what are you doing?
:{{DIcon}} No need to keep up appearances!
:{{DIcon}} The jig is up!
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 paimon 05a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo ellq003 6 paimon 05b.ogg}}--> '''Paimon:''' That's right! It's the Honorary Knight and their trusty companion, Paimon! We're here to crush your evil schemes into dust! Dust!!!
:{{DIcon}} ...And breathe...
:{{DIcon}} I think they got the message, Paimon.
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 19.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' So this was all just a ploy to deceive me!
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's your own fault, who would put so much trust in someone based purely on their manners?
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 schubert 20.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' After so much planning, this is how it ends!? We'll see about that!
:;(Schubert runs and the Traveler follows)
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 sergey 15.ogg}} '''Sergei:''' Just as I expected. I knew I should have never trusted these foolish aristocrats.
:{{A|vo ellq003 6 sergey 16.ogg}} '''Sergei:''' No matter... We already have the intel we need. Get them!

;(Fight the Fatui Skirmishers)
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' They're running off in different directions!
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon remembers that this place is a dead end... Let's take care of the Fatui first and then deal with Schubert later.

;(After defeating the Fatui)
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The door is open, let's go!

----

;(Leave the room)
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Is that Eula?

;(Approach Eula and the others)
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 schubert 01.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Don't touch me, get out of my way! I'll leave on my own!
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' It seems that we've finally caught up with you. This place is crawling with Fatui.
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Oh, it's you. It seems your investigation went well.
:{{DIcon}} It was all worth it.
:{{DIcon}} Things progressed much faster than we anticipated.
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 schubert 02.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Aha! I see now. So you're the one that taught them our etiquette? And I thought you despised such pleasantries!
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 schubert 03.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Furthermore, there is a rule in our family. Such traditions are never to be taught to outsiders!
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Ah yes, rings a bell. So what? I had no reason not to teach them.
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 schubert 04.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Y&mdash;You have brought shame to our family and ruined my plans! It's all for naught now!
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I know that you poured great efforts into these plans, uncle. But you were well aware that it was not the right thing to do. As a Knight of Favonius, I could not overlook your actions.
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 schubert 05.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Knight of Favonius!? Let's get one thing straight. I am your uncle and you are a member of the Lawrence Clan! You should strive to restore your family's glory!
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 schubert 06.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' You still have a chance. Defeat every Knight of Favonius here, and leave with me!
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 schubert 07.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Then I shall plea with the family to spare you and give you a new beginning.
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' So just to be clear, you want a Knight of Favonius to attack the Knights of Favonius?
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 schubert 08.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' I shall say this one last time. You are not a Knight of Favonius. You are a descendant of the Lawrence Clan!
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 schubert 09.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' The blood of the Lawrence Clan flows in your veins! You must comply with the will of the family!
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 eula 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Since when have I ever complied with the will of the family?
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 schubert 10.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Wh&mdash;Why you... you unruly maid!
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 eula 07.ogg}} '''Eula:''' If anyone should be angry, it should be me. As a member of the Lawrence Clan, you knowingly plotted against the city of Mondstadt and threatened its safety.
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 eula 08.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Had you ever stopped to consider the trouble it would bring to so many people? Had you considered how many enemies you would make trying to keep the plans under wraps?
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 schubert 11.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Y&mdash;You dare lecture me!
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 eula 09.ogg}} '''Eula:''' That's right, in the name of the family that you so dearly revere, Uncle Schubert.
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 eula 10.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I've never experienced the age of "glory" you always speak of, and I've never understood our family's incessant pursuit of it.
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 eula 11.ogg}} '''Eula:''' But I am capable of discerning right from wrong, and I deeply understand what "freedom" means to the people of Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 eula 12.ogg}} '''Eula:''' The Lawrence Clan should never and will never become what you've dreamed it to be!
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 schubert 12.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Grr...
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 schubert 13.ogg}} '''Schubert:''' Oh, the disgrace of it all! How could such a rebellious monster emerge from our own family!?
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Heh... things are starting to get pretty hysterical here. Politeness and elegance seem to have gone out the window.
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 eula 13.ogg}} '''Eula:''' That's enough fuss for today. You two, take him away. The Honorary Knight and I have other matters to attend to.
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 eula 14.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Given that you've already taken action, I assume you've come across some conclusive evidence?
:{{DIcon}} The Fatui are in possession of a diagram of Mondstadt's defenses.
:{{DIcon}} The Fatui are planning something terrible.
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon took a peek at their diagram. Your uncle had mapped out all of the Knight's patrol routes and marked out key information about Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 eula 15.ogg}} '''Eula:''' *sigh* And there was me thinking that he was just another elder of the family &mdash; and a lazy one at that. I never expected he could stoop so low. So stubborn... Mark my words, vengeance will be mine!
:{{A|vo ellq003 7 eula 16.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Let's discuss this later. Our first priority is recovering that diagram.

----

;(Enter the room past the bridge)
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 fatui 01a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo ellq003 9 fatui 01b.ogg}}--> '''Fatuus:''' They're here! Stop them!

----

;(Enter the room beyond the lift)
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There it is! That's where they've put the diagram!

;(Approach the diagram)
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 sergey 01.ogg}} '''Sergei:''' So you've tracked us here, huh? I guess there's no other option but to fight.

:{{A|vo ellq003 9 sergey 02a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo ellq003 9 sergey 02b.ogg}}--> '''Sergei:''' You dare provoke me! Fatui, come forth and dispose of them!

;(Defeat all of the enemies)
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' This must be it. They may have very well already made a copy of it...
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' But without my uncle as their puppet, there'd be no use in them attacking the city.
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Fatui wouldn't have relied only on your uncle.
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' True, but if their plan had hinged purely on taking Mondstadt by force, as opposed to with the help of a puppet, they could have spared themselves the trouble.
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' The Fatui are dishonest, but they wouldn't go as far as to start an open war. Their opposition wouldn't just be Mondstadt alone...
:{{DIcon}} Right, that's what I was thinking.
:{{DIcon}} That would be putting the cart before the horse.
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Anyway, I'll inform the Acting Grand Master. She'll know how to handle things from here.
:{{DIcon}} By the way, why did you follow us here?
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh yeah, you suddenly appeared at just the right moment.
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 eula 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Yeah, about that...
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 eula 07.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Because you stole my targets by attacking the Fatui I'd been tracking earlier...
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 eula 08.ogg}} '''Eula:''' ...I came to exact my vengeance. You tried to do my job for me, and I'm here to return the favor.
:{{DIcon}} So getting the diagram of Mondstadt's defenses was your way of exacting vengeance?
:{{DIcon}} Guess we're even now, right?
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Finally, after all this time, Paimon understands way you're saying!
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' In reality, you sensed that something might happen to us during our investigation...
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You were worried about us and your uncle, so you brought a team to take a look!
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 eula 09.ogg}} '''Eula:''' My purpose was vengeance, don't twist the story.
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 eula 10.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Hmph, you don't look too bright, but it turns out you have a knack for scheming...
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 eula 11.ogg}} '''Eula:''' And mark my words, I'll remember that...
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, what do you mean Paimon doesn't look too bright!?
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 eula 12.ogg}} '''Eula:''' You have seeded a deep enmity between us... just you wait.
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 eula 13.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Even if you were to be completely destroyed, I would never forget you!
:{{DIcon}} So, does that make us your "arch-enemies"?
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Bring it on!
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 eula 14.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Hahaha, I like your fighting spirit. I'll take this diagram back to the Knights of Favonius and take it from here.
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure... well... see you around!
:{{A|vo ellq003 9 eula 15.ogg}} '''Eula:''' That you will. And make sure not to steal my targets next time!

==Trivia==
* The two Knights of Favonius that accompany Eula during the confrontation with Schubert look the same as the ones from the quest [[Kaeya's Gain]], appearing with Kaeya in the [[Lost Treasure of Arcadia]] domain. Though they share the same appearances with [[Athos]] and [[Huffman]], it is not confirmed to be them.
