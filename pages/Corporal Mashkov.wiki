Corporal {{Lang|'''Mashkov'''|ru=Машков|ru_rm={{#invoke:ru-rm|main|Машко́в}}}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in the {{Quest|A Company Vanishing Into the Deep}}.
==Profile==
Corporal Mashkov is a member of the Ninth Company, originally sent to the Chasm to help deal with a mysterious black sludge in a joint agreement with the [[Liyue Qixing]] to combat the darkness underneath. The mission failed as the device the Fatui used exploded and failed to purify anything. This resulted in the company shattering, with men going missing or dying and Mashkov assuming leadership of small group of Fatui.

As they starved due to lack of supplies, they came across fellow Ninth Company member [[Anton]] negotiating with the Traveler for food. Mashkov condemned Anton for revealing Fatui secrets and demanded the Traveler hand over their food, but he and his cohorts were weak with hunger and were ultimately defeated and forced to retreat. It's unknown if the group survived or perished deep within the Chasm.
===Appearance===
Mashkov takes on the form of a [[Fatui Skirmisher - Electrohammer Vanguard]].
