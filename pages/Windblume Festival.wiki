The '''Windblume Festival''' is a festival in [[Mondstadt]] celebrating the Thousand Winds.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/iPt7z1rRptI?t=165 Version 1.4 Special Program] (Timestamp: 2m 45s)</ref>

==Traditions==
During the Windblume Festival, the people of Mondstadt offer Windblumes to [[Barbatos]] and to those they love and adore. The Windblumes may be accompanied by other gifts, such as love poems. While there is a romantic overtone to the Windblume Festival, Windblumes are not gifted exclusively with romantic intent. The Windblume Festival is also an opportunity to improve any and all relationships that people have.<ref name="windblume quest 1">{{Ref/Quest|Ode to Flower and Cloud}}</ref>

It is important that every person takes matters into their own hands during this period, especially if they are single and looking for love. It is difficult for anyone to find something they can do for someone else, to the point that even the Adventurers' Guild has far fewer commissions during this period.<ref name="windblume quest 1" /><ref name="windblume quest 2">{{Ref/Quest|Missive of Cloud and Fog}}</ref>

Every Windblume Festival, one person who has truly proven themselves during Windblume or who has made great sacrifices for Mondstadt is selected as the Windblume Star to represent the people of Mondstadt and formally offer a Windblume of their choosing to Barbatos during the Windblume Ceremony.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Donna|c=during Invitation of Windblume}}</ref><ref name="windblume quest 3">{{Ref/Quest|Realm of Fog and Wind}}</ref> However, individuals may informally offer Windblumes to Barbatos at his large statue throughout the festival.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Those Hard-to-Reach Places}}</ref>

Presently, the Windblume Festival also includes many fun activities that people can partake in.

One of [[Springvale]]'s customs is that during the Windblume Festival, young hunters who are looking for love go to Wolvendom to catch foxes and then release the foxes with wreaths of flowers atop the foxes' heads.<ref name="allan">{{Ref/NPC|Allan|c=during Invitation of Windblume}}</ref>

==History==
It is unknown when the first Windblume Festival took place, but the festival's origins are of the time of [[Decarabian]], when those who were planning the rebellion used the Windblume as their secret code.<ref name="windblume ode" /><ref name="cyrus">{{Ref/NPC|Cyrus|c=during Invitation of Windblume}}</ref><ref name="dr edith">{{Ref/NPC|Dr. Edith|c=during Invitation of Windblume}}</ref>

==The Windblume Flower==
The Windblume flower is not a tangible, extant plant. It existed in the dreams of [[Decarabian]]'s people as a nameless, "floaty" flower that thrived in environments with harsh [[Anemo]] and [[Cryo]], possibly including the frozen wasteland of Mondstadt outside of Decarabian's city or at the border of his city.<ref name="windblume ode">{{Ref/Weapon|Windblume Ode}}</ref>

The rebels against Decarabian used ''Windblume'' as a code word, likely because the conditions under which the Windblume thrived figuratively paralleled the situation of those who planned the rebellion.<ref name="cyrus" /><ref name="dr edith" /><ref name="windblume quest 4">{{Ref/Quest|Dream of Wind and Flowers}}</ref> In particular, Windblumes are associated with the [[Ragnvindr Clan]] and their possible ancestors, dating back to the [[Red-Haired Warrior|red-haired warrior]] who was with Barbatos during the rebellion against Decarabian.<ref name="windblume ode" /> It is known that the Windblume was the symbol of the rebellion against Decarabian, but the association with the Ragnvindrs may not be as well-known.

In present day, the true form of the Windblume flower is a topic of debate. Everyone has a plant they deem their own personal Windblume, and candidates range from the [[Dandelion Seed|Dandelion]], popular with many people, to the [[Wolfhook]], which may only be a Windblume for [[Razor]] and [[Bennett]]. The Anemo Archon Barbatos supports the freedom for all individuals to choose their own Windblumes and does not name any particular flower as the Windblume, even going as far as to say that Windblumes are simultaneously everywhere and nonexistent.<ref name="windblume quest 4" />

Opinions about the true form of the Windblume flower often align with opinions about what the Windblume Festival should celebrate. The most popular school of thought is that of the Dandelionites, who believe that the Windblume is a Dandelion and the Windblume Festival is a festival for lovers. The second most popular school of thought is that of the Asterists, who believe that the Windblume is a [[Windwheel Aster]] and the Windblume Festival should be a time to remember the liberation of [[Old Mondstadt]] from Decarabian's rule.<ref name="lawrence">{{Ref/NPC|Lawrence|c=during Invitation of Windblume}}</ref>

The full list of Windblume candidates during [[Invitation of Windblume]] is as follows:<ref name="windblume quest 4" />
* [[Dandelion Seed|Dandelion]]
* [[Windwheel Aster]]
* [[Cecilia]]
* [[Sweet Flower]]
* [[Small Lamp Grass]]
* [[Wolfhook]]

Despite the lack of consensus on what flower (or plant) the Windblume actually is, it is the symbol of the Windblume festival and represents concepts such as freedom and love.<ref name="windblume quest 1" /><ref name="windblume ode" />
