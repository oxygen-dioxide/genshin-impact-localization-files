The '''Aranara''' are a race of plantlike<ref>Gadget: [[Aranyaka (Gadget)|Aranyaka]] I: Woodland Encounter, "Vanagni"</ref><ref>Interactable: Zandik's Legacy, [[Zandik's Legacy#Ragged Records|Ragged Records]]</ref> forest spirits who reside in [[Vanarana]] in northern [[Sumeru]]. They are encountered in the [[World Quest]] series ''[[Aranyaka]]''.

They were led by [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] &mdash; whom they called "Queen Aranyani" &mdash; up until her disappearance.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Arakarman}}</ref>

After [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] erased the memory of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata from the [[Irminsul]] during ''[[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]]'', like any Teyvatian creatures, the Aranara also forgot her as Queen Aranyani, believing instead that they are the children of the current dendro archon, whom they refer to as The Lord of Verdure.

==Overview==
The Aranara have lived in Sumeru at [[Old Vanarana]] until the [[Cataclysm]] occurred. Many Aranara fought fiercely against the invaders of the [[Abyss]], but they were forced to abandon their old home and made a new home at [[Vanarana]].

At some point prior to the events of the game, the [[Traveler's Sibling]] met with the Aranara, who referred to them as the "Nara Varuna". They helped them with the [[Varuna Contraption]] prior to their departure, after which they told them to expect another golden-haired human who would give them even better memories.

==Powers and Abilities==
All Aranara are capable of hiding themselves from the human eye, although they are only seen by children, most likely due to the fact that they dream, whereas adults do not. Being attuned with nature, Aranara are also capable of communicating with plants, especially fungi (e.g mushrooms like [[Rukkhashava Mushrooms]], not the actual [[fungus]]).

Aranara love memories, although some of them are prone to forgetting quite easily, so some Aranara give flowers to their friends so they can remember them if they meet again. They can draw on the memories to gain power to use from the plants of the forest, known as [[Mystic Arts in Teyvat#Sumeru|Ararakalari]]. Every Aranara has their own Ararakalari, which can be used to fight enemies, restrain or suppress their strength, teleport across great distances in an instant and even block several areas off.

Every Aranara has their own tune, and every tune is different, so the Aranara know who's home.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The World of Aranara}}</ref> Each tune can be played by the Traveler with the [[Vintage Lyre]].

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* Aranara is possibly derived from the Sanskrit words {{Lang|''áraṇya''|sa=अरण्य}} meaning "forest" or "wilderness", and {{Lang|''nára''|sa=नर}} meaning "man" or "person."
** It may also be related to {{w|Aranyaka}}, meaning "produced, born, relating to a forest" or "belonging to the wilderness". The Aranyakas are a part of the Indian {{w|Vedas}} bearing the meaning of ritual sacrifice.<ref>https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/nara</ref>

=== Appearance ===
* The Aranaras' faces resemble the letter {{Lang|fa=ت|mini=1}} in the Persian alphabet.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_alphabet#Letters</ref>
