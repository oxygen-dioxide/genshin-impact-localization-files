The '''Aranara''' are a race of plantlike forest spirits<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Children of Vimara Village}}</ref> who primarily reside in [[Vanarana (Subarea)|Vanarana]] in [[Sumeru]]. They are the focus of the {{Quest|Aranyaka}}.

They were led by [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] &mdash; whom they called "Queen Aranyani" &mdash; up until her disappearance.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Arakarman}}</ref>

After [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] erased the memory of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata from the [[Irminsul]] during the {{Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies}}, like any Teyvatian creatures, the Aranara also forgot her as Queen Aranyani. With this revised history, they believe that they are the children of the current Dendro Archon, whom they refer to as The Lord of Verdure.

==Overview==
Aranara were created by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata to serve as guardians of the forest and its creatures. By nature, they are friendly, curious, and helpful towards humans. They used to live alongside humans in the past, but became reclusive after the [[Cataclysm]] struck and the people of Sumeru stopped dreaming.

Today, the Aranara do not normally trust most humans, especially adults, though they befriend children and are often referred to as a myth as no adult had ever seen them with their own eyes before. The Aranara relate this to a sense of mistrust in adults and thus deem them as "grown up", who try to say goodbye to their younger selves but rarely succeed. They see children as those who had not "grown up", though they have made a few exceptions to this should they deem them trustworthy, such as [[Rana]] and [[Yoimiya]].

The [[Sumeru Akademiya]] looked into researching if the Aranara exists or not, even if the common adult dismissal is that they're "imaginary friends." As the Akademiya sensors couldn't detect them as children can, the [[Amurta]] darshan classified them as "unidentified lifeforms."<ref name="AM">{{Ref/Quest|Aranaga's Memory}}</ref>

===Physiology===
Aranara share many qualities with actual plants. When faced with great danger, they will turn into a seed and enter "hibernation." When the crisis has passed, the seed will sprout and grow into an Aranara again, a process that requires a lot of energy.<ref name="FU">{{Ref/Quest|Festival Utsava}}</ref> The final stage of an Aranara's life is growing into a [[Vasara Tree]], the size and growth rate of which depends on the amount of memories the Aranara has collected.<ref name="FFTaS">{{Ref/Quest|For Fruits, Seeds, and Trees}}</ref> They also do not need to sleep or eat, are extremely fearful of fire and salt, and can be revitalized using {{Dendro}} energy.

==Powers and Abilities==
{{See Also|Mystic Arts in Teyvat#Ararakalari}}
All Aranara are capable of hiding themselves from the human eye, although they are only seen by children, most likely due to the fact that they dream, whereas adults do not. Specific adults, primarily those who are trusted by the Aranara or have a fiercely pure and warm heart, can also see Aranara, even if they haven't met before; two examples of these are [[Rana]]<ref name="HTYatFG">{{Ref/Quest|"Hello," "Thank You," and the Final "Goodbye"}}</ref> and [[Yoimiya]], though the latter did not have any encounters with Aranara.<ref name="ATFaP">{{Ref/Quest|All Things Flawless and Pure}}</ref>

Being attuned with nature, Aranara are capable of communicating with plants and fungi (e.g. mushrooms like [[Rukkhashava Mushrooms]], not the monsters called [[fungi]]). They also easily befriend wild animals, such as [[Rishboland Tiger]]s.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Rishboland Tiger, Roaaar}}</ref>

===Memories===
Aranara love memories, both because it is their source of power and because they are a long-lived and sentimental race. Some of them are prone to forgetting, so they give flowers to their friends so they can remember them if they meet again. They can use their memories as fuel to channel power from the plants of the forest, known as [[Mystic Arts in Teyvat#Sumeru|Ararakalari]]. Every Aranara has their own Ararakalari, which can be used to fight enemies, restrain or suppress their strength, teleport across great distances in an instant, and even [[Vamadha|block areas off]]. Aranara can also selectively create and remove dreams and memories.<ref name="FaBR">{{Ref/Quest|For A Better Reunion}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Silent Seeker of Knowledge}}</ref>

===Music===
Every Aranara has their own unique tune, which they can use to identify each other.<ref name="TWoA">{{Ref/Quest|The World of Aranara}}</ref> These songs can also contain other information, which it seems only other Aranara can understand.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Rhythm that Reveals the Beastly Trail}}</ref> An Aranara's song is linked to their power &mdash; the closer an Aranara's tune is to the 'Sourcesong', the stronger their Ararakalari is.<ref name="RNS">{{Ref/Quest|The Rhythm that Nurtures the Sprout}}</ref> It is said that Queen Arayani's song was closest to the Sourcesong, and thus her Ararakalari was the strongest.<ref name="FFTaS" />

Aranara songs can be played to invoke certain skills, such as activating [[Silapna]], opening [[Gloomy Path]]s, and summoning [[Healthy Dendrograna]]. These songs can even be used by non-Aranara, such as the Traveler (on the [[Vintage Lyre]]).

Some Aranara, known as 'song gatherers', dedicate their lives to collecting other Aranara's songs, a craft that they learned from humans. They do this out of a love for music, as a way to preserve memories, and as a way to search for the 'Sourcesong'.<ref name="RNS" /> Some song gatherers even collect the songs of humans, though this is considered unusual.<ref name="RLGP">{{Ref/Quest|The Rhythm that Leads to the Gloomy Path}}</ref> Known song gatherers include [[Aramuhukunda]], [[Arakavi]], [[Aradasa]], [[Arasudraka]], and [[Arayasa]].

==History==
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata created the Aranara shortly after she left the [[Great Red Sand|desert]] to create [[Dharma Forest]]. It is said that she sang a song that caused the [[Fane of Ashvattha|Ashvattha Tree]] to "grow from Sarva," and it bore a pomegranate from which each seed became an Aranara. [[Aramuhukunda]] was the first Aranara to be "born."<ref name="FFTaS" />

The Aranara originally lived in "[[Old Vanarana]]." For many years, they protected the forest and made friends with all living creatures, including humans, many of whom used to visit them in Vanarana and [[Ashvattha's Concourse]]s.<ref name="TWoA" /><ref name="FtCotP">{{Ref/Quest|For the Children of the Past}}</ref>

When the [[Cataclysm]] struck, many Aranara fought fiercely against the invaders from the [[Abyss]], but they were forced to abandon their old home and establish a [[Vanarana (Subarea)|new Vanarana]] to the north.<ref name="FtCotP" /> For protection, they hid the "true Vanarana" within a dream; it is anchored to the real world by the [[Tree of Dreams]].

Not long after the Cataclysm, the [[Traveler's Sibling]] befriended the Aranara while traveling through Sumeru. They helped them repair the [[Varuna Contraption]], after which the Aranara dubbed them "Nara Varuna." Prior to their departure, they told the Aranara to expect another golden-haired human who would give them even better memories.<ref name="FU" /> The Aranara treasure their memories of Nara Varuna, and have created murals<ref name="FtCotP" /> and [[Memory of Stone (Monument)|monuments]] in their honor.<ref name="MoS">{{Ref/Quest|Memory of Stone}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* {{Furnishing Mentions|name=The Aranara|are=1}}
* Aranara have adopted many practices from humans, including ones with no practical purpose:
** Cooking &mdash; Aranara do not need to eat, and fear fire
** Houses &mdash; Aranara do not need to rest
** Merchantry &mdash; Aranara do not need to trade
** The concept of siblings &mdash; Aranara do not reproduce

===Etymology===
* Aranara is possibly derived from the Sanskrit words {{Lang|''áraṇya''|sa=अरण्य}} meaning "forest" or "wilderness," and {{Lang|''nára''|sa=नर}} meaning "man" or "person."
** It may also be related to {{w|Aranyaka}}, meaning "produced, born, relating to a forest" or "belonging to the wilderness." The Aranyakas are a part of the Indian {{w|Vedas}} bearing the meaning of ritual sacrifice.<ref>Wisdom Library: [https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/nara Nara]</ref>

===Appearance===
* The Aranaras' faces resemble the letter {{Lang|fa=ت|mini=1}} in Arabic-based script, such as Arabic and Persian.<ref>Wikipedia: {{wt|ت}}</ref>
* The Aranara are a plant-like creature with varying shapes and colors. They can be seen wearing a hat-like mushroom or two leaves with an ornamental pattern. They have a leaf propeller on top of their head which they can use to fly. They can also wear accessories like bowtie, weapon, bag, or scarf.
