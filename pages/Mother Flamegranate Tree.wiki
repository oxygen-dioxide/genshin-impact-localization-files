==Lore==
The Mother Flamegranate Tree is guarded by the [[Scions of the Canopy]], as it is the source of the tribe's [[Flamegranate]]s. Specifically, a guard is posted at the entrance of the cave containing the tree's roots. For many years, this position has been held by Tisoc. Only Scions of the Canopy who hold a [[Green-Edged Paper Slip|special entry pass]] may enter; these are very difficult to obtain and strictly controlled. Each pass is marked with the name of the individual pass-holder, and thus cannot be traded nor conferred.<ref name="Ripe For Trouble">{{Ref/Quest|Ripe For Trouble}}</ref>

The Mother Flamegranate Tree bears two special kinds of Flamegranates — ones larger than regular Flamegranates, which grow on the tree amidst the cliffs in the open-world, and '''Mountain King Flamegranates''', which grow near its roots in the cave underneath the tree. Mountain King Flamegranates are so named because they are to be offered to the Mountain King, [[Kongamato]].<ref name="Ripe For Trouble" />

The special fibers in the roots of the Mother Flamegranate Tree thrive when immersed in lava ([[Liquid Phlogiston]]) instead of burning. In fact, this proximity is necessary for the Flamegranates to mature and acquire their Phlogiston content.<ref name="Ripe For Trouble" />

* The skins of these Flamegranates can be dried to make bags, such as those that Couriers carry.<ref name="Ripe For Trouble" />
