{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Muepu)
:'''Muepu:''' Hey, outlander. Want to try "Eyes on the Feathered Prize"?

;(Talk to Muepu)
:'''Muepu:''' Hey, outlander. You've a good pair of eyes... Wanna test them by setting your "Eyes on the Feathered Prize"?
:'''Muepu:''' Hone your vision, and be rewarded.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, that's a concise explanation. Maybe too concise. Barely feels like you said anything at all...
:'''Muepu:''' Detailed rules for later, if you want to try.
:{{DIcon}} Let's hear the rules, then.
:'''Muepu:''' Three Qucusaurs will fly off. Keep your eye one the middle one...
:'''Muepu:''' When they all fly back, {{color|buzzword|recognize... the one originally in the middle}}. That's it.
:'''Paimon:''' Err, so they'll switch positions mid-flight, and we gotta figure out which one was originally in the center?
:'''Muepu:''' Correct indeed.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh... No wonder you call this eyesight training.
:'''Muepu:''' Start simple to test the waters?
:'''Muepu:''' And if there's no trouble, we play for real.
:'''Muepu:''' Rewards are yours if you succeed.
:{{DIcon}} Alright, I'll give it a try.
::'''Muepu:''' When ready, hit the target and start!
:{{DIcon}} I've got something else on{{sic}}, so I'll be back later.
::'''Muepu:''' Fine. I will be here.

;(Talk to Muepu again, optional)
:'''Muepu:''' Want to try "Eyes on the Feathered Prize"?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' I've forgotten the rules, sorry... <!--Not dialogue choice-->
:'''Muepu:''' Three Qucusaurs will fly off. Keep your eye on the middle one...
:'''Muepu:''' When they all fly back, {{color|buzzword|recognize... the one originally in the middle}}. That will do.
:{{DIcon}} Alright, I'll give it a try.{{Verify}}
::'''Muepu:''' When ready, hit the target and start!
:{{DIcon}} I've got something else on{{sic}}, so I'll be back later.
::'''Muepu:''' Fine. I will be here.

;(Choose the correct Qucusaur in Round 1)
:'''Muepu:''' That's right, it's... this one.
:'''Muepu:''' Looks like you're ready for the real challenge.
:'''Muepu:''' When ready, hit the target and start!

;(Choose the wrong Qucusaur in Round 1)
:'''Muepu:''' No, not this one.
:'''Muepu:''' Looks like your eyes need more practice...

;(While the Qucusaurs fly around in Round 2)
:'''Paimon:''' How come they've all gone behind the buildings and mountains? We can't see anything now!
:'''Muepu:''' Haha, you'll have to put your heart into it, to truly see...

;(Choose the correct Qucusaur in Round 2)
:'''Muepu:''' That's right, it's... this one.
:'''Muepu:''' Here, great warrior, take your reward!

;(Choose the wrong Qucusaur in Round 2)
:'''Muepu:''' No, not this one.
:'''Muepu:''' Looks like your eyes need more practice...

;(After completing "Eyes on the Feathered Prize")
:'''Muepu:''' No more prizes left. No more prizes, no more challenge.
:'''Muepu:''' Any other questions?
:{{DIcon}} Could you tell me more about "Eyes on the Feathered Prize"?
::'''Muepu:''' Passed down in the tribe from long ago...
::'''Muepu:''' Keen eyes are critical to us, the Flower-Feather Clan.
::'''Muepu:''' This generation, I am in charge.
:{{DIcon}} Is there a reason why you speak so slowly...?
::'''Muepu:''' Previous injury. Fell from a very high place...
::'''Muepu:''' Throat and chest... Can't speak like before.
::'''Muepu:''' But I don't think it's... too terrible.
:{{DIcon}} No worries, no questions for you.
::'''Muepu:''' Wish you well. Goodbye.
