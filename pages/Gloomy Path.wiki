'''Gloomy Paths''' are an [[exploration]] mechanic in [[Sumeru]]. They exist in two states: inactive and active. These paths only become active after playing "Rhythm of the Gloomy Path" with the [[Vintage Lyre]]. Activating a Gloomy Path transports the player to a [[domain]] inaccessible through normal means.
