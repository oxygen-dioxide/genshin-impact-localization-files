'''Gloomy Paths''' are an [[Exploration]] mechanic in [[Sumeru]]. They have two states: Inactive and Active. These will only become active after playing "Rhythm of the Gloomy Path" with the [[Vintage Lyre]]. These transport the player to a different location (a [[Domain]]) that cannot be reached otherwise.
