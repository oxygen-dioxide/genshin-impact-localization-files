==Dialogue==
{{StubDialogue|changes after a specific '''Archon Quest''', please help find which one}}
===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing [[Setting Sail]].''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Juza:''' Ahoy, traveler! Welcome aboard the Alcor!
:{{DIcon}} And who'd you be, matey?
::'''Juza:''' I'd be the Alcor's Chief Mate. I'm in charge of the lads when Captain [[Beidou]] isn't around.
::'''Juza:''' I used to be a dockworker, just muddling along without a clue about what I was living for. If it weren't for Captain Beidou's invitation, I'd still be tightening screws in some miserable corner...
::'''Juza:''' Sailing with the Captain, adventuring as we please... Best decision of my life, I tell you!
::'''Juza:''' Oh, that's right. It so happens, traveler, that we're hiring right now. Interested in joining up as a sailor?
::'''Juza:''' If you come on board, I'll have more than enough to tell you stories about the Captain, hahaha!
:{{DIcon}} What's this ship?
::'''Juza:''' This beauty here is the flagship of our very own Crux Fleet, the Alcor!
::'''Juza:''' She's sturdy, she's armed to <!--the-->teeth, and she's the speediest ship to sail Liyue's seas!
::'''Juza:''' Basically, it's our most eye-catching vessel. Pirates look upon it and flee in terror at the sight!
::'''Juza:''' Of course, we aren't just famous for this boat. More importantly, we've got Captain Beidou and all the lads.
::'''Juza:''' They might make like a rowdy, joking lot, but when the going gets tough, they shut up and get cracking!
::'''Juza:''' You'll know what I mean if you ever get the chance to go out to sea with us.
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Juza:''' Aye! Come have a pint with us some time!
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing [[Setting Sail]].''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Juza:''' Ahoy, traveler! Welcome aboard the Alcor!
:{{DIcon}} Mind telling me a bit about yourself?
::'''Juza:''' I'd be the Alcor's Chief Mate. I'm in charge of the lads when Captain Beidou isn't around.
::'''Juza:''' I used to be a dockworker, just muddling along without a clue about what I was living for. If it weren't for Captain Beidou's invitation, I'd still be tightening screws in some miserable corner...
::'''Juza:''' Sailing with the Captain, adventuring as we please... Best decision of my life, I tell you!
::'''Juza:''' I know you've got your own business to attend to, Traveler, but the crew all miss you. We'll always have a seat reserved for you if it ever strikes your fancy, just so you know!
:{{DIcon}} Tell me more about the ship...
::'''Juza:''' This beauty here is the flagship of our very own Crux Fleet, the Alcor!
::'''Juza:''' She's sturdy, she's armed to teeth, and she's the speediest ship to sail Liyue's seas!
::'''Juza:''' Basically, it's our most eye-catching vessel. Pirates look upon it and flee in terror at the sight!
::'''Juza:''' Of course, we aren't just famous for this boat. More importantly, we've got Captain Beidou and all the lads.
::'''Juza:''' They might make like a rowdy, joking lot, but when the going gets tough, they shut up and get cracking!
::'''Juza:''' I mean, you've seen us in action, you should know exactly what I mean, haha!
:{{DIcon}} About the photography class...
:;(After completing ???)
<!-- Judging by the content alone, this might be after Life on the High Seas -->
::'''Juza:''' Well, I'd heard that you and the Captain handled a crisis in Inazuma together, and that you were talented in many fields. Sure didn't expect you to be this good, though!
::'''Juza:''' You know what? We should bring you aboard for all the classes: photography, performance art, chess, the works!
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::;(Same as before)

==Trivia==
* Even though the Crux Fleet is primarily comprised of people from Liyue, it is possible that Juza is from [[Inazuma]] instead; his English name uses the Japanese reading for the characters in his name instead of their Chinese reading.
