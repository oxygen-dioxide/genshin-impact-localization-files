|text    = Yet another year is coming to an end. As per tradition, it is time to write letters to friends and reminisce about old times.

Recently, I was entrusted by [[Hu Tao|Director Hu]] to visit [[Qingce Village]]. The village is peaceful and prosperous these days, full of joy and the bounties of nature. Nothing soothes one's heart more than such tranquil sights and the melodious sounds of the villagers' chatter. I almost felt obliged to look for someone to share in such delights, and as such, I picked a few [[Jueyun Chili]]s for you.

Eating them in the winter is conducive to health, but if spicy food is not to your liking, you may use them to decorate your room instead. The strings of red Chilis will surely add liveliness to your home.
