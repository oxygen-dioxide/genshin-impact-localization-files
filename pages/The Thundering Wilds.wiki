'''''The Thundering Wilds''''' is a [[Daily Commission]] that occurs in [[Inazuma]].

==Steps==
{{Quest Description|A strange fog imbued with Electro has descended over the wilderness, posing a threat to passers-by. You might be able to use Anemo to disperse this fog, but beware of any dangers that may arise once it lifts.}}
#Complete the challenge by dispersing the Electro fog<!--text before approaching the commission location, shown in quest log-->
#Investigate the Electro Element anomaly<!--text after approaching the commission location, shown as quest objective, but not in quest log--><br>''Thunder Fogs dispersed: x/3''<!--displayed as a sub-objective below the instructions--><br>''Opponents Defeated: x/x'' (if corresponding Thunder Fog spawns enemies)<!--sub-objective-->
#*The fog can only be dispersed by using {{Anemo}}.
#*Dispersing the fog at some locations can cause enemies to spawn; those enemies must be defeated to complete the commission.<!--there is an additional sub-objective that displays when enemies spawn; it disappears after they are defeated-->

==Gameplay Notes==
* In [[Co-Op Mode]], anyone can dispel the fog, but the fog does not show up until the host arrives in the area.
* When the player leaves the area, the Thunder Fogs reappear. However, defeated enemies will not respawn.
* If co-op mode is initiated while the player dispels some of the Thunder Fog, the Thunder Fogs dispersed previously will reappear.
