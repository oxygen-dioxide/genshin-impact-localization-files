'''A Nation Closed by Thunder''' is a [[climate]] that appears in the ocean between [[Inazuma]] and the rest of [[Teyvat]].

This environment is cleared after completing {{Quest|Transient Dreams}}.

==Overview==
A Nation Closed by Thunder has persistent [[thunderstorm]]s with a lot of lightning. If the player tries to enter or leave Inazuma by venturing into the storm, they are teleported back to [[Liyue Harbor]], [[Guyun Stone Forest]], or [[Ritou]], depending on where they started. This means that Inazuma cannot be accessed without the use of teleportation.

==Description==
{{Description|'''A Nation Closed by Thunder'''
* Inazuma has been closed off by the [[Ei|Ogosho Shogun]]. No one is allowed in or out without good reason.}}

==Trivia==
* In-game, the ocean between Inazuma and the rest of Teyvat, including the area where the storm appears, does not belong to any one [[region]]. This can be determined by the fact that the [[Map#Tabs|tabs]] on the map do not have any region selected.
** In the game's Chinese language, the ocean is labeled with the placeholder region {{zh|（test）海洋}}, meaning "(test) Ocean." However, viewing this is only possible by using a [[Portable Waypoint]] in the ocean.
