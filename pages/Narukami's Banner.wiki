|description    = This is known as the "Electro Mitsudomoe, the emblem bestowed upon Her Excellency's vanguard, the [[Tenryou Commission]]." Banners with the [[Raiden Shogun]]'s house-crest on them are the heart and soul of her army's morale. That these banners can be found everywhere in the [[Kujou Encampment]] is no big deal. Just consider the [[Shogun's army]] a multi-faceted organization or something.<br>It is said that the Shogun's army have a rule that no matter how crushing the defeat or grievous the losses, the banner of the Shogun must never fall into enemy hands. When this banner is carried on before into the battle, a Yoriki of exceptional skill is usually assigned to protect the banner. Fortunately for everyone involved, the resistance's unusual tactics have never extended to targeting these banners. Perhaps it is simply a matter of tacit courtesy between the two opposing sides.
