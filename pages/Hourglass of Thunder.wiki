{{Description|The hourglass used to foretell the coming of the Thunderbird by the tribe that worshiped it. It has fallen into eternal silence now that the tribe is no more.}}
'''Hourglass of Thunder''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Thundering Fury]].

==Description==
A luxurious hourglass belonging to the [[Thunderbird Civilization|ancient tribe that worshiped the Thunderbird]].<br />As the tribe faded away, so did the hourglass.

A luxurious hourglass, made with amethyst and amber gold, that belonged to a shaman.<br />The hourglass would serve its purpose for the festival held in the Thunderbird's honor.

In the last festival the tribe held, the frenzied Thunderbird blew away the bloodstained altar.<br />The countdown to the arrival of the protector became the countdown to the tribe's destruction.<br />The Thunderbird decimated the tribe to avenge the one who sang to it.

Unbeknownst the Thunderbird, the lad himself considered his sacrifice as an offering.<br />All for the good of the tribe, for the blessing of the Thunderbird.
