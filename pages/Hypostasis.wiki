'''Hypostases''' are a [[Normal Boss]] group. They are lifeforms that have reached the highest level of elemental purity.

Hypostases are invulnerable when their cube-like shells are surrounding them and can only be damaged when their diamond-shaped cores are exposed, typically during or after they perform an attack. Their attacks deal elemental damage of their type and they are immune to said type.

After losing 95% of their health, Hypostases will typically enter a revival phase (with the exception of the Pyro Hypostasis) in which it spawns several elemental objects of its type that must be dealt with within a time limit, which if done successfully, will either immediately defeat the Hypostasis or allow it to be defeated the next time it takes lethal DMG.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|Elemental hypostases are life forms which have completely abandoned their former appearance and biological structure, making them able to reach the highest level of elemental purity. They are ultra-compact structures with a high mass, and are the highest forms of elemental structures, usually formed either at a location bursting with elemental energy or at a clogged ley line.}}
{{Description|Elemental hypostases have developed defensive mechanisms based on their elemental attributes. Concentrated elemental energy forms a solid shell around the core of the hypostasis, leaving only the core reactive to the elemental stimuli. Research into hypostases is mainly led by scholars of Sumeru Akademiya, but due to the level of danger that they pose, little of substance is known about hypostases beyond their scientific name and code name.}}

==Trivia==
* In {{w|Neoplatonism}} and {{w|Gnosticism}}, the term ''{{w|Hypostasis (philosophy)|hypostasis}}'' refers to an underlying substance that supports fundamental reality. Gnostic Christians typically used the word "hypostases" to refer to the {{w|Trinity|Holy Trinity}}.
** The Gnostic exegesis ''{{w|Hypostasis of the Archons}}'' is a depiction of the Gnostic mythology behind the creation of the cosmos and the Earth, and how the archons rule over humanity with the intent of preventing them from reaching ''gnosis'' and ascending to the supercelestial realm of {{w|Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|Ogdoad}}.
* Instead of the Gnostic term "hypostasis", the Chinese version uses the Buddhist term {{zh|无相|rm=Wúxiàng}}, a translation of the Sanskrit word animitta ({{Lang|mini=1|sa=अनिमित्त}}), which means "signless" (traditional English translation) or "aspectless". The Japanese and Korean versions also follow this term. It is considered to be one of the {{w|Shanmen|Three Gates of Liberation}}, along with emptiness and wishlessness.<ref>Oxford Reference: [https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095414134 Ānimitta]</ref>
* The first three Hypostases (Electro, Anemo and Geo) that were released alongside the Global release all have broken pieces on their shells. It is unknown why the Pyro, Cryo and Hydro Hypostases don't have such details. Similarly, the Cryo, Hydro, and Pyro Hypostases all have rounded edges on their shells, also for unknown reasons.
* The Hypostasis's design looks similar to the design of the [[w:c:houkai2nd:World Pillar - Houkai|World Pillar]] from ''[[w:c:houkai2nd:Houkai Gakuen 2|Houkai Gakuen 2]]'', [[MiHoYo]]'s third game.
* Hypostases are the first and only boss series with all seven elemental variants, with the last of them being added [[Version 3.2]]. All Hypostasis Normal Bosses are located in [[Mondstadt]], [[Inazuma]], [[Liyue]], and [[Sumeru]].
** [[Mondstadt]] has the most Hypostases with a total of three &mdash; the Anemo, Electro and Cryo variants.
** [[Inazuma]] has a total of two &mdash; the Pyro and Hydro variants.
** [[Liyue]] and [[Sumeru]] share a total of one each &mdash; the Geo and Dendro variants respectively.

===Codenames===
Each of the Hypostases have a codename, derived from the letters of the Hebrew Alphabet.

Noticeably, the 6th letter ו (vav) is skipped, and Aiin was used instead.
