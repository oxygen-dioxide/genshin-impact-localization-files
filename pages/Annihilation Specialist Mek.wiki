{{Description|Although the [[Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering]] is the main organization involved in clockwork meka research and design, there are also many independent engineers and workshops that are not affiliated with the Research Institute.<br>The first ever machine of this type was designed by an independent engineer to commemorate their lover and sponsor. In the end, it was acquired by the [[Maison Gardiennage]] as a tool to uphold municipal security &mdash; or, as some would have it, state apparatus enforcing the monopoly on violence.|[[Archive]]}}
