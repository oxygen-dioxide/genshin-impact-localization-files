==Descriptions==
{{Description|The most renowned forging workshop in the [[Court of Fontaine]]. No matter the request, so long as there are sufficient materials, the improved, fully-automated forging machines can create stunning works according to the engineer's specifications.|[[Map]] Description}}

==Trivia==
*This is the first and only blacksmith where the worker does not have a hammer or anvil, as the forging is done using a machine.

===Etymology===
* {{Fr|Beaumont}} is a portmanteau of the French words {{Fr|beau|beautiful}} and {{Fr|mont|mountain.}}
