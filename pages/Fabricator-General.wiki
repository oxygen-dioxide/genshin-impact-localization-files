==Trivia==
* In the fictional setting of {{W|Warhammer 40,000|Warhammer ''40,000''}}, Fabricator-General is the title given to the [[w:c:warhammer40k:Tech-Priest|''Tech-Priest'']] (member of the ''Priesthood of Mars'') leader of both the secular [[w:c:warhammer40k:Adeptus Mechanicus|''Adeptus Mechanicus'']] and its religious counterpart, the [[w:c:warhammer40k:Cult Mechanicus|''Cult Mechanicus'']]. As the related terms suggest, this organization is heavily focused in scientific research, in special that of machines and robots, so much so that this sub-faction is all but the sole provide and maintainer of the {{W|Warhammer 40,000#The Imperium of Man|''Imperium of Man''}}'s [[w:c:warhammer40k:Age of Technology|ancient]] &mdash; and/or sometimes [[w:c:warhammer40k:Xenos|alien]] &mdash; technology.
