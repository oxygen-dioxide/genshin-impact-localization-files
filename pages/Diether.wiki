:'''Diether:''' Daddy, they say in [[Springvale]] that Fontaine's the homeland of the water fairies, right?
:'''Dietmar:''' Yes, that's right.
:'''Diether:''' In that case, we'll definitely see them here, won't we?
:'''Dietmar:''' We will, of course we will &mdash; and Daddy will help you find them!
:'''Dietmar:''' But I asked some of the locals, and they say that Oceanids are very shy, and that we need to work hard to see them with our own eyes.
:'''Dietmar:''' You're a good, patient lad, aren't you, Diether? You'll wait for Daddy to find them, right?
:'''Diether:''' Sure, of course!
