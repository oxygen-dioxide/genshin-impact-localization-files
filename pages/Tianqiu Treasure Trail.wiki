==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|[[Lan]] of [[Liyue Harbor]] [[Adventurers' Guild]] seems to be troubled by something...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Lan:''' *sigh* Seems like nobody can get to the bottom of it...
:{{DIcon}} The bottom of what?
:'''Lan:''' The clue! ...Hmm, perhaps "rumor" is a better word... a rumor about treasure.
:'''Lan:''' There's an adventurer who said that he found a clue to treasure in the vicinity of Tianqiu Valley... But he tried everything, and simply could not locate the treasure.
:'''Lan:''' In the end, he gave up looking and reported it to the Guild instead, and now the Guild is offering a reward for anyone able to solve this mysterious so-called "clue."
:'''Lan:''' Any adventurer who wants to give it a go can follow the clue and see where it takes them. If they solve the riddle and find the treasure, the Guild will offer a reward.
:'''Lan:''' But so far, nobody has found even a trace of the treasure...
:{{DIcon}} Can I try it?
::'''Lan:''' Oh, well, if you think you're up to it.
:{{DIcon}} And if I find it...?
::'''Lan:''' Well, like it says in the adventurer's code, finders keepers! All the Guild wants out of it is experience in solving riddles like this. This is the most important thing for adventurers.
:'''Lan:''' If you really are interested, there's no harm in giving it a go.
:'''Lan:''' I'll mark the location on the map for you, then you can go take a look.

;(Talk to Lan again)
:'''Lan:''' I believe that for adventurers, experience is more important than wealth.
:'''Lan:''' Don't forget that for most of the problems you encounter when adventuring, money is useless!
----
;(Upon approaching the designated area near Mt. Tianheng)
:'''Paimon:''' So many monsters! Let's deal with them first, then look for the treasure.
:;(After defeating the enemies, obtain {{Item|Treasure Map}})
:'''Paimon:''' Is this a treasure map? Let's take a look, maybe we'll really find some treasure!
----
;(Upon approaching the designated area near the Dunyu Ruins)
:'''Paimon:''' Based on the map, we should be close... Take a good look around.

;(Investigating the designated area)
:'''Paimon:''' Is this a piece of paper? What's written on it? Let's have a look!
:;(Opens the [[Strange Note]])
:'''Paimon:''' Huh... seems like this is saying that...
:'''Paimon:''' We have to look for treasure beneath an especially large tree, in the middle of a path, and... below a flight of stairs...

;(After opening all three treasure chests, obtain the {{Item|Strange Box}})
:'''Paimon:''' What is this? It looks so strange...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh... no idea what we could use it for, either...
:'''Paimon:''' Well, at least we found something. Let's go back and tell Lan.
----
;(Return to Lan)
:'''Lan:''' So, did you find anything?
:{{DIcon}} I found this.
:'''Lan:''' What's this...? I've never seen anything like it, where did you find it?
:{{DIcon}} Near Dunyu Ruins...
:'''Lan:''' Dunyu Ruins? What would such an item be doing there?
:'''Lan:''' Thank you for getting to the bottom of this for us. As per the adventurers' code, this item is all yours now. Along with your reward, of course.
:'''Lan:''' I'll arrange for someone to head over to Dunyu Ruins to conduct a more thorough search.
:'''Lan:''' So strange... The Dunyu Ruins area has been combed countless times... How did we miss this?
:;(Obtain {{Item|Parametric Transformer}})
