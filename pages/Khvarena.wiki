'''Khvarena''' is a form of energy created by [[Nabu Malikata]] for the sole purpose of opposing the [[Cataclysm]]. Due to its divine nature, it has the ability to purify [[Abyss]]al energy and [[Forbidden Knowledge]].

Note that the term "Khvarena" can be used in multiple ways:

* Referring to the original entity:
** A proper noun, feminine ("[she] forged Khvarena into a divine bird, Charging her with the protection of two worlds")<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Vibrant Pinion}}</ref>
** A singular noun ("Heeding the will of the Khvarena, she created for her a beauteous form")<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Ancient Abscission}}</ref>
** An abstract noun ("do not let your Khvarena dim")<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Stamen of Khvarena's Origin}}</ref>
* Referring to the countless entities created when the original entity divided itself:
** A singular, countable noun ("a wandering Khvarena should be nearby")<ref name="SSTD">{{Ref/Quest|The Splendorous Sky That Day}}</ref>
** A plural, countable noun ("I (...) fused the strongest Khvarena collected there into five Great Songs")<ref name="AKLS">{{Ref/Quest|As the Khvarena's Light Shows}}</ref>

==Overview==
A legend claims that [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] received the Khvarena as a gift from [[Nabu Malikata]] during the first [[Sabzeruz Festival]].<ref name="GHM">{{Ref/Quest|Give Her Memories}}</ref><ref group="Note">[[Sethos]] refers to Lesser Lord Kusanali, but it is because Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's memory has been erased in the [[Irminsul]] and Kusanali was replacing her in the new chronology.</ref> Nabu Malikata called the Khvarena her "innocent" and "pure" daughter, and having predicted the occurrence of the [[cataclysm]], gave the Khvarena to Rukkhadevata in the hopes of mitigating the future disaster.<ref name="VG">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Vourukasha's Glow}}</ref>

After Nabu Malikata and King Deshret died, Greater Lord Rukkhadevata turned the Khvarena into [[Simurgh]], a divine bird, charged with the "guardianship of the border between new birth and death." Simurgh slumbered until the [[cataclysm]] arrived. In order to save the [[Amrita Pool]] from Abyss corruption, Simurgh flew into the pool and shattered its form, creating countless "entities of Khvarena." The sentient Khvarena became the [[Pari]]. At the end of their life cycle, Pari turn into [[Plume of Purifying Light|Plumes of Purifying Light]], who are to be returned to the Amrita Pool.<ref name="VG" />

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* {{Lang|''{{w|Khvarenah}}''|ae=𐬓𐬀𐬭𐬆𐬥𐬀𐬵|ae_rm=xᵛarənah}} is a Zoroastrian concept literally denoting "glory" or "splendor," but understood as a divine mystical force or power projected upon and aiding the appointed. It also connotes "(divine) royal glory," reflecting the perceived divine empowerment of kings and has a secondary meaning of "(good) fortune" as those who possess it are able to complete their mission or function.
