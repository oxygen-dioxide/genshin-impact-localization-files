|desc_suspicious = A skewer covered in burnt cheese. The acrid smell gives notice that the Red Berryshroom has been reduced to a Black Burnedshroom. It looks so awful that you wonder if you might have turned a harmless mushroom into a poisonous one...
|desc_basic      = A skewer covered in mouth-watering cheese. The caps of Red Berryshrooms are removed, filled with a generous sprinkling of cheese, and then grilled to perfection. The rich aroma carries a faint fruity tang best enjoyed while hot.
|desc_delicious  = A skewer covered in golden-brown, mouth-watering cheese. The mushrooms are almost as thick as steak. Although they don't smell like meat, the taste is far more splendid. A single bite blesses your whole mouth with the fragrant flavors packed within, as juicy joy overflows in abundance.
