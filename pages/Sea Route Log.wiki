'''Sea Route Log''' is an event quest item obtained during the [[Event Quest]] ''[[Treasure Clue: Minacious Isle]]''.

==Text==
The things we left behind remain at the center of this island. We said we would come back to retrieve them, but that's probably not gonna happen...<br />
But that's okay, treasure is supposed to be given to whoever discovers it first!<br />
Listen carefully. Set off from this reef on a clear night, and remember to look up.<br />
Continue ahead, following the stars until you see a constellation, then make your way to where the whirlpools converge.<br />
That's where I've left one of four clues to obtain the treasure!
