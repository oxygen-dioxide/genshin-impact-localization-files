{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = Xenomare Pearl
|desc_1      = The Millennial Pearl Seahorse holds a Xenomare Pearl in front of its legs that grants it 60% [[RES]] increase to all DMG and enables it to use stronger attacks. The pearl is {{Electro}}-infused and can be destroyed using [[Elemental Reaction]]s. When the pearl is destroyed, the Millennial Pearl Seahorse will become paralyzed for a period of time.
{{Elemental Shield Data|Electro|19|noec=1|Xenomare Pearl}}

|name_2      = Earthshock Descent
|desc_2      = Leaps twice into the air before slamming down at the player's location, dealing '''95% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}, then raises its front legs to cause another shockwave, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} and leaving the ground electrified. Electrified ground deals '''6% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} every 0.5s to players standing on it. This attack is only used when the Xenomare Pearl is intact.

|name_3      = Lock On
|desc_3      = Marks the player with a circle of swimming fish, then deals '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} within the circle and leaves a small area of the ground electrified. Electrified ground deals '''6% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} every 0.5s to players standing on it. This attack is only used when the Xenomare Pearl is intact.

|name_4      = Unihorn Thrust
|desc_4      = Charges at the player, dealing '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} and electrifying the ground in its path. Electrified ground deals '''6% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} every 0.5s to players standing on it. This attack is only used when the Xenomare Pearl is intact.

|name_5      = Swirling School of Fish
|desc_5      = Conjures a great number of fish-shaped missiles which home in at the player, each dealing '''35% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} on hit. This attack is only used when the Xenomare Pearl is intact.
|file_5      = Millennial Pearl Seahorse Fintide Barrage

|name_6      = Tail Swipe
|desc_6      = Performs a 3-part melee attacks by swiping its tail, dealing '''60% ATK''', '''60% ATK''', '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}. If the second hit hits the player, the third hit's DMG will be halved. The first hit or the second and third hits of the combo can sometimes be omitted. This attack is only used when the Xenomare Pearl is intact.

|name_7      = Fontemer Hoarthunder
|desc_7      = After the Xenomare Pearl's durability is decreased below 7GU (or 4.2GU if the pearl has already been destroyed once), the Millennial Pearl Seahorse ascends high into the air and summons 3 Resonant Coral Orbs. The seahorse absorbs energy from the Resonant Coral Orbs and continuously summons lightning that strike over a large area, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} and electrifying the struck ground. Electrified ground deals '''6% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} every 0.5s to characters standing on it. The Resonant Coral Orbs are {{Electro}}-infused objects and can be destroyed using Elemental Reactions. Destroying an orb will slightly reduce the durability of the Xenomare Pearl, and destroying all three will immediately destroy it. If all orbs are not destroyed in time, the Xenomare Pearl will recover durability based on the amount of orbs left on the field. This ability can only be used once per fight.
{{Elemental Shield Data|Electro|0.4|noec=1|Resonant Coral Orb}}

|name_8      = Single Swipe
|desc_8      = Swipes its tail once, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. This attack is only used when the Xenomare Pearl is destroyed.

|name_9      = Double Swipe
|desc_9      = Swipes its tail twice, dealing '''50% ATK''', '''40% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. If the player is hit by the first hit, the second hit's DMG will be halved. This attack is only used when the Xenomare Pearl is destroyed.

|name_10      = Charge
|desc_10      = Charges at the player, dealing '''65% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. This attack is only used when the Xenomare Pearl is destroyed.

|name_11      = Regeneration
|desc_11      = The Millennial Pearl Seahorse recovers its pearl, and releases a shockwave around itself, dealing '''90% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}. A pearl recovered this way will only have '''60%''' of its original durability.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|An ancient suzerain of the Fontemer Aberrant that dwells in a cavern. Has a body possessed of phantasmal beauty and a temper fiercer than a raging thunderstorm.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}
{{Description|One of the two sovereigns standing at the apex of the Fontemer Aberrants.<br>Poets and authors often proclaim it to be proud and noble due to its solitary tendencies, but the true reason behind such adulatory descriptions is its elegant and slender body. As such, it is a "Pearl Seahorse," while the suzerain of the Armored Crabs is an "Emperor."<br>In the legends and rumors of Fontaine, a brutal war was once waged among the Aberrants of the Fontemer, leaving only the "Millennial Pearl Seahorse" and "Emperor of Fire and Iron" splitting the great lake into two courts, one ruling over the north, the other the south. In the "Song of Dobharcu," the writer describes the outcome of the war: the great Hunter's Ray known as the Stormlord stirred huge waves in its death throes, causing what is now known by the people as the "first diluvian period"...<br>Of course, all of this is nothing more than the romantic imaginations of people who are unwilling to accept the bland realities of the world. For the Fontemer Aberrants are in fact just simple aquatic animals, and they have no grand courts nor fallen kingdoms, nor do they possess words meant to exalt or curse.|[[Archive]]}}
