==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Tlilhua:''' When I bless my weapon with invincibility, it blesses me with invincibility back...
:{{DIcon}} Is this... some sort of perpetual motion blessing machine?
::'''Tlilhua:''' Hmm? ...Uh, not exactly...
::'''Tlilhua:''' A perpetual motion machine sounds like something that doesn't exist, and if that's the case, it wouldn't work.
::{{DIcon}} So, is invincibility possible?
::'''Tlilhua:''' As long as you believe, you'll make it a reality one day.
::'''Tlilhua:''' ...Of course, it all stems from whether the person who bestowed the blessing is reliable.
::'''Tlilhua:''' Generally, when people buy new weapons, they'd ask a well-respected friend from the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]] to help draw something on it.
::'''Tlilhua:''' But as you can see, I'm a wrestler. What kind of weapon could a wrestler even use?
::'''Tlilhua:''' So I mostly just buy protective equipment. And it's always reassuring when you're wearing something with a beautiful pattern on it!
:{{DIcon}} Bless you.
::'''Tlilhua:''' Thank you!
