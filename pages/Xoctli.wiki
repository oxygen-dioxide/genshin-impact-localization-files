==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Xoctli:''' We'd better get this place tidied up before we can move the food in...
:{{DIcon}} Need any help?
::'''Xoctli:''' Huh? Oh, no need, haha! I'll do it myself, but thanks for the offer. I wouldn't want to trouble you with a trifle like this.
::'''Xoctli:''' Me and Masa... Oh, I almost forgot, this Tatankasaurus here is Masa. We were supposed to deliver food, but [[Pisasa|a rampaging saurian]] careened into the warehouse, and, well...
::'''Xoctli:''' What's done is done. It's no big deal, I'll have it tidied up in no time.
:{{DIcon}} Are you the granary manager?
::'''Xoctli:''' Huh, me? No, I'm a farmer. If you have any questions about crop cycles, planting schedules, harvesting techniques, and the like, be sure to hit me up!
::'''Xoctli:''' Here at the Collective of Plenty, we don't really have an official granary manager. Or, to put it another way, everyone's a manager.
::'''Xoctli:''' Whoever wants to take some food, well, they just need to have a word with [[Tonaca]] &mdash; she's in charge of planning and logistics.
:{{DIcon}} If I may, your saurian companion seems a bit... lost.
::'''Xoctli:''' Hmm? Let me have a look...
::'''Xoctli:''' Haha, it's nothing to worry about, the little blighter's just hungry. Once I've sorted out all this food, there'll be plenty of time for a hearty snack.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Xoctli:''' Okay, goodbye.
