While his fate is left ambiguous, he was likely killed by [[Kaedehara Kazuha]] in the ensuing battle.<ref group="Note">Kazuha is seen killing a yoriki during the battle; while it is unknown how many participated, it is likely that he was the only one, seeing that no other yoriki were seen during the cutscenes.</ref>
