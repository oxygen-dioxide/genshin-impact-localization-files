==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Takasaka is a prominent yoriki that serves the [[Tenryou Commission]]. He partook in a duel against the [[Traveler]] as their final opponent and lost before Sara initiated the actual battle. While his fate is left ambiguous, he was likely killed by [[Kaedehara Kazuha]] in the ensuing battle.<ref group="Note">Kazuha is seen killing a yoriki during the battle; while it is unknown how many participated, it is likely that he was the only one, seeing that no other yoriki were seen during the cutscenes.</ref>

===Appearance===
Takasaka Izumi wears a  lavender ''shitagi'', indigo ''kobakama'', and he is barefoot in ''waraji'' sandals. His eggplant-colored armor with dark gold accents consists of ''dou'' (breastplate) with the [[Inazuma Shogunate]]'s crest, ''han-kote'' (half-armored sleeves), ''haidate'' (thigh guards), and ''sune-ate'' (greaves). He is also wearing a ''kabuto'' (helmet) with the Shogunate's crest and ''sode'' (shoulder armor) on his left shoulder. Izumi carries a ''katana'' at his hips on the left side.
