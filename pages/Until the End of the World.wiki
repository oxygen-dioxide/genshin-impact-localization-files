:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 wanderer 04.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' You and your friends fell from the top of that waterfall, and you passed out along the way. Guess someone couldn't keep it together...
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 wanderer 05.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Sorry to break it to you, but crashing into the ground doesn't take you to another world. That kind of thing only happens in those stupid light novels they sell in [[Inazuma]].
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Also, he kind of set you down on Nilou's lap. So, that's where you've been napping all this time.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' P&mdash;Paimon!
:{{DIcon}} ...Sorry...
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 nilou 05.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Oh, no... It's alright... I&mdash;I'm just glad you're okay.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' You didn't hit your head, did you? Is the dizziness gone?
:{{DIcon}} I feel a lot better...
:{{DIcon}} But it seemed like someone was talking in my head just now.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Really? What did they say?
:{{DIcon}} "...Go forth and witness this world..."
:{{DIcon}} "...Be nice to everyone."
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 wanderer 06.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' The fog you see around here can have {{Color|buzzword|a hallucinatory effect}}. Apparently, it's the work of that dragon. Maybe you inhaled some while you were freaking out on your way down...
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Uh, {{Traveler}}, Nilou... Do you know this Hat Guy person?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 nilou 06.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Oh, yeah. He's a student at the [[Akademiya]]. We met during the last [[A Parade of Providence|Interdarshan Championship]]. He was representing the [[Vahumana]] Darshan.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, then... Hello there, friend! I'm Navia, the President of [[Spina di Rosula]]. It's very nice to meet you. So, should I just call you Hat Guy as well? Seems like that's what everyone's calling you.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 wanderer 07.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Sure, whatever.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 nilou 07.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Wait, Hat Guy, what's that sword around your waist?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 wanderer 08.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Tch, an unwelcome encumbrance, that's what... I've had it ever since I woke up here. Tried to toss it, but no matter what I do, it always reappears. Such a pain...
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 wanderer 09a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo yqeq303 8 wanderer 09b.ogg}}--> '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Anyway, if any of you want the "Hero's Sword," you can have it.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait... It's called what?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 wanderer 10.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' The "Hero's Sword," meant to be wielded by the hero... I know, me of all people, right? The irony.
:;(Wanderer gains the title "Hero of Simulanka")
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!? ...YOU'RE the Hero of this world?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 wanderer 11.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Will you calm down? It's just a dumb title.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, uh... It's just that, this entire time, we thought we were the heroes of the prophecy...
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 wanderer 12.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Well, if it means that much to you, you're welcome to claim the title. You'd be doing me a favor.
:{{DIcon}} I'm good, actually...
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's not the point... The real question is: If you're the hero, then where the heck have you been all this time?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 wanderer 13.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Looking for a way out.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 wanderer 14.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' I heard there's a boat in this area that can bring you to another world, so I came to investigate.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 wanderer 15.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' But look at the state of things around here &mdash; the lighthouse collapsed, the boat won't budge... I say we try to find a different way out.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, Paimon's guessing a voice told you what you were supposed to do here... That's what happened with Navia and Nilou, at least.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 wanderer 16.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Hah, you expect me to take orders from some disembodied voice?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, wait! Where are you going?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 wanderer 18.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' To find the so-called "source of this world's misfortune" &mdash; the dragon responsible for this whole mess.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Wait, we came here to fight the dragon as well. Why don't we go together?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 wanderer 19.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' ...Tch. Grab that {{Color|buzzword|dragon scale}} over there before you leave. It'll come in handy later.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A dragon scale? Where? How did you know about it? What's it for? And&mdash;
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 wanderer 20.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Have you ever considered keeping your questions to yourself? Because if you actually expect me to answer them all, we'll be here until the next Interdarshan Championship.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 8 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You little...! Ugh, Paimon thought you might've learned some manners by now, but clearly not!

;(After using the [[Toy Bombs and Toytanium|toy bomb]] to destroy the toytanium)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Toy Miner:''' The flow's been cleared!

;(Pick up the dragon scale)
:{{A|vo yqeq303 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This should do it, right? Wow, this scale is amazing! It turns everything it touches into something hard, almost like a toy block. Doesn't seem to work on us, though.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 9 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' It spews out poison, and transmutes everything it touches... No wonder they call it the "evil dragon."
:{{A|vo yqeq303 9 wheel 01.ogg}} '''Wheel:''' Your Majesty! Madame Fairy! Brave Hero!
:{{A|vo yqeq303 9 wanderer 01.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' What are you looking at me for? He's obviously talking to you.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 9 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Mr. Wheel! You didn't get hurt when we fell, did you?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 9 wheel 02.ogg}} '''Wheel:''' No, not at all. Thankfully, the young man in the hat was kind enough to lend me a hand.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 9 wanderer 02.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Tch...
:{{A|vo yqeq303 9 wheel 03.ogg}} '''Wheel:''' There seems to be a village over here. Some of the residents used to work in the toytanium mines, and some came to fight the dragon, then got stuck here.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 9 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' I see... I'm glad they're all safe and sound. I can try to use my magic to fold a boat to bring everyone back.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 9 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I'll help, too! Still, I think we need to take care of the dragon first. We don't want it to start causing trouble when we're trying to load people onto the ship.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 9 wheel 04.ogg}} '''Wheel:''' Apparently, the villagers often see the dragon fly into {{Color|buzzword|a space behind the waterfall}}. They think that's the location of its lair.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then, we should look around and try to find a way in!
:{{A|vo yqeq303 9 wheel 05.ogg}} '''Wheel:''' I'll wait here for your triumphant return. Your Majesty, brave heroes... Please, be careful.

:{{A|vo yqeq303 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, but... No, Paimon doesn't need to ask you anything! Hmm... The dragon scale can turn anything it touches into toy blocks, so... Aha! You want to use it to block off the water!
:{{A|vo yqeq303 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' See! Paimon can figure things out all on her own!

:{{A|vo yqeq303 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? When did you put your hat on?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 11 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, we're getting ready to fight, aren't we? I feel more comfortable in my regular outfit. Hat Guy also put away that sword around his waist.

:{{A|vo yqeq303 58 littledurin 05.ogg}} '''Durin:''' Hmm... But, what about all the things that I did before?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 58 wanderer 09.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' That's simple &mdash; just go out there and atone. You could fill in the footprints you left on the ground, or help the people around the Broken Sea get home.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 58 littledurin 06.ogg}} '''Durin:''' Okay... And... You'll come along and help me, right, Hat Guy?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 58 wanderer 10.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Huh? Why would I do that?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 58 littledurin 07.ogg}} '''Durin:''' Uhh... Because... You said you wanted to be my friend...
:{{A|vo yqeq303 58 wanderer 11.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' You little...! Gah, well maybe I spoke too soon!
:{{A|vo yqeq303 58 littledurin 08.ogg}} '''Durin:''' Huh? But I thought... *sniff*
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} Come on, Hat Guy...
:{{A|vo yqeq303 58 wanderer 12.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Alright, fine! I'll go with you!
:{{A|vo yqeq303 58 littledurin 09.ogg}} '''Durin:''' ...Really?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 58 wanderer 13.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Yes, really. Lying to you would be no fun anyway.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 58 littledurin 10.ogg}} '''Durin:''' Thank you! You're the first friend to call me by my name.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 58 wanderer 14.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq303 58 wanderer 15.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Let's go back up. I'm about to suffocate down here.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 58 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, it feels so good to finally see Hat Guy meet his match! Hehehe!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon...
:{{DIcon}} Don't be so insensitive...
:{{A|vo yqeq303 58 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, okay... Paimon just never thought we'd see the day, that's all.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 58 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Alright, let's also head back up, then.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 58 littledurin 11.ogg}} '''Durin:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq303 58 nilou 11.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Don't be scared, Durin. We'll be right by your side.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 58 littledurin 12.ogg}} '''Durin:''' Mhm. Thank you for your blessings, everyone... This is the happiest day I've had in a really long time.
:;(Everyone returns to the surface)<!-- black screen transition -->
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Ta-da! Surprise, everyone!
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aah! A talking street lamp!
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Street lamp...? Oh my, you mean you still don't remember me, after all the times we've spoken?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 littledurin 01.ogg}} '''Durin:''' I know that voice... It's Mom's friend!
:{{DIcon}} Alice.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 03.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Hello there, {{Traveler}} and friends. And Durin &mdash; it's good to see you. You've changed quite a lot.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 04.ogg}} '''Alice:''' In fact, you look so different that perhaps... I should call you "Mini Durin"?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 littledurin 02.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' "Mini Durin," huh... Yeah, I like the sound of that! It's nice being smaller.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' You must be one of the three Goddesses of this world... Are you the Goddess of Creation?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 05.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Yep, that's right! But although it's the most impressive-sounding of the three, to be honest, we all made an equal contribution toward the founding of this world.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 06.ogg}} '''Alice:''' If you've ever read any of M's stories, you'll know just how enchanting the worlds are that she writes about. So enchanting that I just had to step inside and explore it for real.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 07.ogg}} '''Alice:''' So I got B involved, and with M's consent, created the world of Simulanka.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa whoa whoa, you're getting a little ahead of yourself! First things first, would you mind explaining what you're doing here? ...In fact, no, what are WE even doing here?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 08.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Haha, don't worry! All will be revealed! After everything you accomplished on your journey, you're free to ask me anything you want.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 09.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Hm, let's start with your first question, then. I'm here because I sensed a great magic power emanating from the book just now, and I couldn't resist the urge to peek inside and check it out.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' That must have been when we all gave Mini Durin our blessings, right?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 10.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Yes, exactly. In the world of fairytales, words and emotions often carry far more power than any spell.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 11.ogg}} '''Alice:''' It's all thanks to your magic that Mini Durin was able to take this form. Come say hi to me, little one. Ah, look at you. You're as cute as a button!
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' So... What about us? Was it always part of the plan that we'd come here?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 12.ogg}} '''Alice:''' "Plan" isn't the word I'd use. If you ask me, I'd say... fate works in mysterious ways.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 13.ogg}} '''Alice:''' When Durin of Simulanka made his wish to the Goddess of Fate, it just so happened that in a world far away, all of you wonderful people were holding a copy of M's fairytale at that exact moment.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 14.ogg}} '''Alice:''' And because of your noble and kind souls, you were selected by the Goddess of Fate to come and save this world.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Now that you mention it... That's what I was doing when I was transported here! I was reading a fairytale to some children in the Fleuve Cendre!
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' I think I just... happened upon an old book, and decided to use it as my pillow during a nap in a box... Hehehe...
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow... What a crazy coincidence...
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, that's not right... How come everyone else got assigned a role except us? 'Cause we were also...
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Yeah, that was it! We'd just received a strange book, and we had no idea who sent it. Then, the moment we opened it up to start reading it, we found ourselves here... You're the one who sent it to us, aren't you?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 15.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Oh, is that what happened? Hahaha, yes, that does sound like me, doesn't it?
:{{DIcon}} Why did you send us here?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 16.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Hmm... Good question. Why, indeed? Maybe I thought this was such a good story, it simply had to be read by someone. As the Traveler and witness of many worlds, how could I let such a beautiful place pass you by?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 17.ogg}} '''Alice:''' I can sense that your blessing for Mini Durin was a very special one. With this blessing from beyond the story, he might even be able to explore worlds outside of this one.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 wanderer 01.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Teyvat, you mean?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 18.ogg}} '''Alice:''' That's right. In fact, back when we were first creating Simulanka, M told us that she hoped the people of this world would one day be able to explore the wider world beyond.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 19.ogg}} '''Alice:''' "Every story has an ending, but if the story becomes reality, it should have the right to choose its own path."
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' So in other words... the predestined lives these people lead were always going to disappear one way or another.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, so if even the people here get to go to other worlds... Surely there's gotta be a way we can leave, too, right?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 20.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Don't you realize you've been able to leave all along?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 21.ogg}} '''Alice:''' You can either take the {{Color|buzzword|boat}} at the Broken Sea, or touch the {{Color|buzzword|giant bookmark}} at the [[Cliff of Prophecy]]. All you need to do if you want to leave is focus on the place you want to go.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...How were we supposed to know that if you never told us!?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 22.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Huh? Didn't I? Hehe, well, given how smart and capable you are, surely that can't have posed a huge problem for you?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 23.ogg}} '''Alice:''' As for your other friends who were summoned here... If I had to guess, I'd say the Goddess of Fate probably didn't tell them about it because she wanted them to get engrossed in the story.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 24.ogg}} '''Alice:''' She's M's reflection, after all. It wouldn't surprise me if she shares M's love for cliffhangers!
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 25.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Anyway, I think that answers your questions, yes? What do you all plan to do next?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 littledurin 03.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' I... I'm gonna go say sorry to the people of this world. After that... I wanna start protecting Simulanka, just like Mom told me to.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... Now we know how easy it is to get back home, Paimon's suddenly not in such a hurry to leave.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Same here! It's not every day that you get to come to such a magical world. I, for one, plan to explore it a little longer.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 26.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Haha, I'm glad to hear it. Maybe I should invite some other friends to join you, too...
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 27.ogg}} '''Alice:''' By the way, Mini Durin, I'm delighted to see you've made some new friends. I'm sure M would be very proud of you.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 alice 28.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Now, before I depart, please let me give you a blessing as well. May your future be as rich and colorful as the stories M used to tell.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' ...She's gone.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess this is where the Hero's journey comes to an end, huh?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Huh, but it's also where a new journey begins: The adventures of Mini Durin and friends!
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 littledurin 04.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' Huh? An adventure for me...?
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' You bet! For starters, I'd love to introduce you to my other friends in the Forest. Even though there have been some misunderstandings in the past, I'm sure they'll welcome the new you with open arms.
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 littledurin 05.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 wanderer 02.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Stop looking at me. I already said I'll come with you!
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 kirara 04.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Whoa! Look over there!
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Wow... The stars are beautiful...
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I'll bet that's a gift to Mini Durin from the three Goddesses of this world!
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 littledurin 06.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq303 59 littledurin 07.ogg}} '''Mini Durin:''' Thank you, Mom...
