|description  = Mualani's outfit. She originally intended to stick the designs of all the fish ever as ornaments for her clothes, but this design was politely rejected by the tailor on account of being too avant-garde. Despite the immense simplification, this outfit has more than enough personality to mark the enthusiastic guide out even in a crowd.

'''Flying Fish, Heat Waves, and Moon Scallop''' is [[Mualani]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
Mualani wears a halter wrap top with light blue and white patterns and has a light copper fish emblem placed on the middle of her chest. She has dark blue shorts which are covered by a short whiteish-light blue skirt, a light blue ribbon on her right side, a large blue ribbon on her back where her {{Hydro}} [[Vision]] rests, a blue bandana with golden patterns that she wears on her head, and dark blue fingerless gloves with a white accessory over that covers them. For her footwear, she has calf-high blue stirrups that are patterned with fish and platform sandals that are adorned with what resemble seal flippers. She also has lighter skin patterns on her right thigh, knees, waist, midriff, and arms, and has blue and yellow nail polish adorning her fingers and toes.
