'''Hydro Mimic Ferrets''' (also known as '''Hydro Mimic Squirrels''') are [[Hydro Mimics]] summoned by the [[Oceanid]], but can also be encountered on their own in the [[Spiral Abyss]] or during [[Quests]]. They resemble normal [[Squirrel]]s. They take more damage from {{Pyro}} (except in certain events; see [[#Event|below]]). They can heal quickly, like the [[Hydro Mimic Boar]]s.

==Strategy==
If the player continuously walks closely around them in a circle, they would turn to face the player and would not attack.

==Trivia==
* Although its official name is "Hydro Mimic Ferret," the monster resembles a squirrel instead of a ferret.
