;(Before completing [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]])
:'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' Uh... Hello?
:'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' If you don't have anything urgent, I must really continue deliberating this matter with Sir Matsukawa...
:{{DIcon}} You are...
::'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' I am of the [[Takatsukasa Clan|Takatsukasa]] family of the [[Kujou Clan]]. I work for the [[Shogunate]].
::'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' The [[Kanjou Commission]] has recently submitted some new financial reports. I'm currently reviewing and organizing them to report to my superior.
::'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' But my superior seems to be a bit worried about this report.
::'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' Sir Matsukawa has been in office for many years, earning him immense prestige and respect. If he is worried about this report, then I must be more prudent in my review...
::{{DIcon}} What's the problem with the report?
::'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' In my humble opinion, there is nothing wrong with the report. The Kanjou Commission has been very careful in submitting their report, and I have already reviewed it according to our usual standards.
::'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' But perhaps with the current unrest, Sir Matsukawa is less than optimistic about the financial situation in Inazuma.
::'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' I can understand his concern... But as an ordinary civil official, what can I do to help...?
::'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' *sigh* If I had more power, perhaps I could resolve these issues and actually do something for the Takatsukasa and Kujou Clans.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry for bothering you.
::'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' Alright. Then I will get back to work...

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After completing Omnipresence Over Mortals)
:'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' Uh... Hello?
:'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' If you don't have anything urgent, I must really continue deliberating this matter with Sir Matsukawa...
:{{DIcon}} So, you are...
::'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' I am of the [[Takatsukasa Clan|Takatsukasa]] family of the [[Kujou Clan]]. I work for the [[Shogunate]].
::'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' The [[Kanjou Commission]] has recently submitted some new financial reports. I'm currently reviewing and organizing them to report to my superior.
::'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' Ever since the abolishing of the Vision Hunt Decree, Sir Matsukawa has been even more cautious about the materials he sends to the Kanjou Commission. I must be vigilant, too.
::{{DIcon}} What's the problem with the reports?
::'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' Well, you see, the abolishing of the Decree caused a huge stir. This also exposed many instances of nepotism and fraud within the Kanjou Commission.
::'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' We've currently got our hands full clearing the old accounts.
::'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' And with the war ending with the Shogunate being unable to decisively defeat the rebels, Sir Matsukawa is even less optimistic about the financial situation in Inazuma than usual.
::'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' The work on my hands has grown significantly, and the paper pushers below me have not been all that useful in this matter, so I have had no choice but to follow Sir Matsukawa through this work every step of the way.
:{{DIcon}} How's the situation in the Kujou Clan...
:;(After completing {{Quest|Reflections of Mortality}})
::'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' Being as busy as we are, I have not paid the clan's internal affairs much mind... So the news that some in our family tried to stab the main Kujou Clan in the back, I was very shocked...
::'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' It is fortunate that Lord Kujou Kamaji was able to gain the Almighty Shogun's trust. If not... *sigh* I dare not even think about the consequences.
::'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' Still, this series of events has me thinking that I should pay our internal affairs more mind... Once I have finished my work here, I will pay the main clan a visit...
:{{DIcon}} Don't let me bother you, then.
::'''Takatsukasa Tomohide:''' Alright. Then I shall return to my work...
