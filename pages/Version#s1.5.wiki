|description = Moonlight falls on the branches as a dragon's roar rises from deep beneath the roots. A drop of sun may trickle in, but a heart of stone is not easily moved.<br>Deals are sealed with scarlet flames and ice-cold vengeance floods forth in waves. But far from the fight is a realm of serenity, where a gentle melody forever plays.

**The controls to skip the [[Battle Pass]] animation, [[Wish]] animation, and animation of claiming rewards in Domains has been changed for controller users: now, hold the circle/B button to skip; the confirmation pop-up window has been removed.
**The button layout display of different controllers has been made consistent.

**On mobile, the Acceleration Slider (Aimed Mode) setting has been added. With this setting enabled, the camera movement speed will change dynamically with the speed of your finger. Sliding faster causes the camera angle to rotate more.

==Known Issues==
#When multiple [[elemental reaction]]s take place simultaneously, some elemental-reaction-related DMG Bonuses may be incorrect (for example, DMG Bonuses triggered by the 4-Piece Set effects of the Crimson Witch of Flames and Thundering Fury artifact sets). This issue will be fixed in a future version. Further information on when the fix will occur will appear in a future notice.
#When switching characters while protected by a [[shield]], there is a small chance that the character who takes the field will be launched if hit by an attack with a rather strong interrupt effect at the moment of switching. This issue will be fixed in a later version update. Please stay tuned for future notices regarding the exact fix time.
#Casting characters' skills while using the [[Windsong Lyre]] gadget may cause errors with the skills' effects. This issue will be fixed in a later version update. Please stay tuned for future notices regarding the exact fix time.
#In [[Noelle]]'s [[Hangout Event]] and [[Barbara]]'s Hangout Event, some subtitles do not match the meaning of the voice-over in some languages (including English). Our developers are currently working to fix the issue. Please stay tuned for future announcements regarding the exact time of the fix.
#In [[Zhongli]]'s Story Quest "Historia Antiqua: Act II - [[No Mere Stone]]," there is an error with the English voice-over for the line "My life is nigh on eternal. I will go on with the infinite flow of time. And you, Morax... You too will live for many a day to come." such that it does not match the subtitle. This issue will be fixed in [[Version 1.6]].
#After entering the [[Serenitea Pot]], if the game reconnects, Commissions will disappear from the Quest Menu (Note: display issue only). Travelers who encounter this issue can simply leave the Serenitea Pot to resolve the issue.
#For players on the PlayStation®4, during the World Quest "[[A Teapot to Call Home: Part II]]," if the game reconnects during the quest objective "Talk to [[Tubby]]," the camera angle will be locked. Travelers who encounter this issue should first try leaving the game from the Paimon Menu, then logging back in. Alternatively, open the Map, select the Serenitea Pot icon in the lower-right corner, and teleport back to Teyvat. If the issue persists, Travelers can report the issue through the Feedback tab in the Paimon Menu.
#In [[Co-Op Mode]] and under certain circumstances, if other Travelers are visiting the Serenitea Pot, the host will receive the erroneous message that another Traveler "has left the Serenitea Pot" upon returning to Teyvat. (There is no issue with related game functions.)
#In Co-Op Mode, Travelers who enter the Serenitea Pot will receive the erroneous message that another Traveler "has left the Serenitea Pot." (There is no issue with related game functions and when the host enters their own Serenitea Pot from [[Teyvat]], this message will not appear.)
#When there is thunder in the open world, the character voice-over line "When Thunder Strikes" is incorrectly triggered repeatedly. The trigger mechanism for this voice-over line will be temporarily removed in the update on May 6, and this issue will be fixed in [[Version 1.6]].
#During [[Diona]]'s Hangout Event, if the Traveler is in the party when the "Search for the kitty on Mondstadt's rooftops" objective fails, the Traveler will display incorrectly and disappear. This issue can be fixed on the spot by teleporting, switching the Traveler out from the party, or by logging out and back in again. Our developers are currently working to fix this issue. Please stay tuned for further updates.
#In the open world, "[[Guoba]]" created by [[Xiangling]]'s Elemental Skill, the bursts of flame created by Pyro Abyss Mages when they are dancing and regenerating their shields, and the wind current within the Eye of the Storm's Hurricane Sphere will sometimes be positioned incorrectly. Our developers are currently working to fix this issue. Please stay tuned for further updates.
#During the "[[Energy Amplifier Initiation]]" event, there is a chance that destroying the Mutation Stone will not remove the buff from opponents within the Place of Interest correctly. Our developers are currently working to fix this issue. Please stay tuned for further updates.
#Certain characters, such as [[Yanfei]], have a small chance of being launched if hit by an attack when they use an [[Elemental Burst]]. This issue will be fixed in the update on June 9.
