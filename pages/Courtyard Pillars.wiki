|description    = It is said that in [[Natlan]], trees are traditionally named not by their appearance, but for their intended purpose.<br>Generally, only timber possessing exceptional strength, durability, and resilience qualifies for use in architectural frameworks. Moreover, among such trees, only those with both significant age and size are deemed suitable for becoming beams and pillars. Even in the fertile lands of [[Atocpan]], such timber is exceedingly rare. Thus, it is rumored that in the [[Collective of Plenty]], some individuals cultivate farmland around these precious trees &mdash; tending to their crops while simultaneously safeguarding the growth of these invaluable wooden pillars.
