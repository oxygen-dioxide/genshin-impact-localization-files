{{Description|The primitive wandering inhabitants of Teyvat's wildernesses.<br />These hilichurls wield flaming clubs and charge with reckless abandon to chase intruding adventurers off. Most wildfires in the grasslands or forests are not actually caused by a [[Klee|certain special Knight]], but due to the actions of these hilichurls.}}
