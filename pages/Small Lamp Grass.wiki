{{Description|A wild grass that emits light at night. Used in cooking to enhance other flavors. Just as the subtle fragrance of wild flowers will not distract a focused person, Small Lamp Grass' delicate glow will not attract their attention either, even at night.}}
'''Small Lamp Grasses''' are a [[Local Specialty]] found in the wild all over [[Mondstadt]].

==How to Obtain==
Small Lamp Grasses grow mostly in wooded areas and some ruins of Mondstadt, and will emit a small light blue glow at night (19:00 – 06:00); many can notably be found in the [[Whispering Woods]].

See the gallery or the '''[https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=33 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for specific locations.

Additionally, the following NPCs give Small Lamp Grasses after following a certain dialogue branch for the first time:
*[[Ziwei]] in [[Dunyu Ruins]], [[Liyue]] (4 Small Lamp Grasses)

==Trivia==
*Walking through a lit small lamp grass will make a faint chime sound.
*In [[Hilichurlian]], it is called ''celi lata gusha'' (lit. hot cold vegetables).<ref>{{Ref/Book|Handy Handbook of Hilichurlian}}</ref>
*The Chinese name may refer to {{Lang|{{w|Juncus bufonius|toad rush}}|zh=小灯心草|zh_rm=xiǎodēngxīn-cǎo|zh_lit=small lamp heart grass}}, although this plant never emits light in real life. This name in turn comes from its related species {{Lang|{{w|Juncus effusus|common rush}}|zh=灯心草|zh_rm=dēngxīn-cǎo|zh_lit=lamp heart grass}}, which was used for the wick of a candle in premodern times.
*The Japanese version uses the name for the {{Lang|common rush|ja=イグサ|ja_rm=igusa}}, likely because it is also sometimes called {{Lang|"lamp wick grass"|ja=燈芯草|ja_rm=toushinsou}}.
*The Korean name {{Lang|mini=1|ko=등불꽃|ko_rm=deungbulkkot}} may be a pun. The name can be interpreted as "Lamp Flame" or "Lamp Sparkle" in common usage, but in its literal sense it means "Lamp Fire Flower."
*The Traveler could choose to offer a Small Lamp Grass as their Windblume of choice during [[Invitation of Windblume]].
