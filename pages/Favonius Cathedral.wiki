The '''Favonius Cathedral''' or '''Mondstadt Cathedral''' is a large Cathedral located in the [[City of Mondstadt]]. It is run by the [[Church of Favonius]].

The Favonius Cathedral is used in worshipping the Anemo Archon [[Barbatos]]. At the back of the Cathedral lies a basement in which the [[Holy Lyre der Himmel]] is kept guarded.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A holy place managed by the devoted adherents of the Anemo Archon. It was once a palatial estate from which the [[Mondstadt Aristocracy|aristocracy]] flaunted their authority.|Viewpoint, [[Viewpoint/Favonius Cathedral|Favonius Cathedral]]}}
{{Description|The spectacular statue of the Anemo Archon and the Favonius Cathedral are wonders to behold, but one is left to wonder whether it is necessary for the city, which has been taught the idea of freedom by the Anemo Archon himself, to exhaust its wealth on a cathedral so grandiose.|[[Map]] description}}

==Trivia==
* The Mondstadt Cathedral is built in a gothic style and closely resembles the {{w|Cologne Cathedral}} or {{w|Regensburg Cathedral}} in Germany.
* When inside the Cathedral, distances to quests are quite far off from just outside the Cathedral. These distances place the Cathedral just south of the ruins south of the [[Guili Plains]], between two [[Teleport Waypoints]] and west of the [[Statue of The Seven]].
