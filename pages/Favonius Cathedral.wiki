{{Description/Viewpoint|Favonius Cathedral}}
{{Description|The spectacular statue of the Anemo Archon and the Favonius Cathedral are wonders to behold, but one is left to wonder whether it is necessary for the city, which has been taught the idea of freedom by the Anemo Archon himself, to exhaust its wealth on a cathedral so grandiose.|[[Map]] description}}

==Trivia==
* The Mondstadt Cathedral is built in a {{w|Gothic architecture}} style, resembling real-world Gothic cathedrals such as {{w|Cologne Cathedral}} and {{w|Regensburg Cathedral}} in Germany.
* When inside the Cathedral, distances to quests are quite far off from just outside the Cathedral. These distances place the Cathedral just south of the ruins south of the [[Guili Plains]], between two [[Teleport Waypoints]] and west of the [[Statue of The Seven]].
* The Cathedral has a theoretical seating capacity of 110 seats, with six pew chairs at the front of Cathedral, and sixteen in the middle and back of the Cathedral. Of these, only 66 spots can be sat in by the player.
