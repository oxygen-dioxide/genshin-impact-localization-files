The '''Favonius Cathedral''' or '''Mondstadt Cathedral''' is a large Cathedral located in the [[City of Mondstadt]]. It is run by the [[Church of Favonius]].

The Favonius Cathedral is used in worshiping the Anemo Archon [[Barbatos]]. The front of the Cathedral lies a basement in which the [[Holy Lyre der Himmel]] is being kept guarded.

==Trivia==
* Mondstadt Cathedral is built in gothic style and closely resembles {{w|Cologne Cathedral}} or {{w|Regensburg Cathedral}} in Germany.
* When inside the Cathedral, distances to quests are quite far off from just outside the Cathedral. These distances place the Cathedral just south of the ruins south of the [[Guili Plains]], between two teleport waypoints and west of the [[Statue of The Seven]].
