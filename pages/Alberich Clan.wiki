{{Quote|Though we could not restore Khaenri'ah to life, we of the Alberich Clan should lead lives as those who blaze like fire, rather than those who wallow in the embers.<ref name="hidden strife brick" />}}

The '''Alberich Clan''' is a [[Khaenri'ah]]n clan, which is established to be of noble (though, not royal) status, and the one which [[Kaeya]] hails from.

==History==
The Alberich Clan was a clan of nobles from the kingdom of Khaenri'ah, with a lineage dating back to, at the very earliest, the late [[Eclipse Dynasty]]. They were of a sufficient enough status by the time of the cataclysm that [[Chlothar|Chlothar Alberich]], as a youth, had access to the Royal Library of Khaenri'ah, employed servants, and was held to very restrictive standards, but the Alberich Clan itself is stated to not be of royal descent. However, when King [[Irmin]] grew weak, the Alberich Clan stepped up as regents.<ref name="hidden strife brick">Event [[Hidden Strife]] Interactable: [[Hidden Strife/Story#The Brick|The Brick]]</ref>

===500 Years Ago===
At the time of the [[cataclysm]], the Alberich Clan was considered nobility. Chlothar had an illegitimate child, [[Caribert (NPC)|Caribert]], with a woman from [[Mondstadt]] whom he fell in love with. Following the cataclysm, Chlothar was cursed with immortality while Caribert transformed into a [[hilichurl]].<ref name="caribert 2 medicine">{{Ref/Quest|Fortune-Mocking Pedigree}}</ref>

Desperate to do something for his son even if the curse could not be broken, Chlothar traveled to [[Sumeru]] to make a medicine that would supposedly restore Caribert's intelligence and consciousness, enlisting the help of the [[Traveler's sibling]] when they stumbled into each other. After failing to obtain power from the God of Wisdom, [[Abyss]]al power from [[Voice Inside the Head|an unknown "Sinner"]] was discovered underground and obtained instead. The medicine imbued with the power of the Abyss worked on Caribert, earning the Abyss a devout follower in Chlothar. However, Caribert remained a hilichurl and was eventually unable to handle the power of the Abyss. Caribert eventually took off his mask, and after becoming enveloped in Abyssal power, he disappeared; his exact fate is unknown.

After Caribert's disappearance, Chlothar called Caribert the "[[Loom of Fate]]," believing the absent Caribert to be free to rewrite his own fate. Chlothar went on to found the Abyss Order, as he still saw the "Sinner" as his and Caribert's salvation as fellow "sinners." It is suggested that this series of events was also what convinced the Traveler's sibling to side with the Abyss.<ref name="caribert 4 final">{{Ref/Quest|Portended Fate}}</ref>

After a hundred years, Chlothar went insane. At an unknown point in time, Chlothar also discovered a way to rid himself of his curse of immortality. He eventually died and was buried together with an unknown female, suggested to be Caribert's mother, in the field where the [[Strange Mushroom]]s grew.<ref name="caribert 4 final" /> It is unknown who buried them, but it is suggested that Chlothar buried his wife there before meeting the Traveler's sibling.<ref group="Note">Chlothar avoids explaining what happened to Caribert's mother. The item description of the [[Strange Mushroom]]s and the Traveler during ''[[Fortune-Mocking Pedigree]]'' both call into question the mushrooms' growing conditions. Watering the field attracted Fungi, which alarmed the Traveler. After waking up, the Traveler dug up the field to find out what was buried underneath. After unearthing the two skeletons, Dainsleif notes that the male skeleton was interred much later than the female one.</ref>

===Present Day===
Kaeya, who is considered a descendant of Chlothar,<ref name="caribert 1 kaeya">{{Ref/Quest|Destined Encounter
}}</ref> was left in Mondstadt as a child by his father, who called Kaeya "our last hope"<ref>{{Ref/CS|Kaeya|4}}</ref> or "our only hope".<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Aroma of the Past (Quest)}}</ref> However, Kaeya distanced himself from his past as he grew up in Mondstadt and currently has no intention of following through with the reason he was placed in Mondstadt, though it remains to be seen if he will maintain that distance in the future.<ref name="caribert 1 kaeya" /><ref>{{Ref/VO|Mona|About Kaeya}}</ref> Kaeya also does not seem to be on good terms with the Abyss Order.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Crash Course}}</ref>

It is unknown exactly what the Alberich Clan's current goal is.

The Alberich Clan does not keep written records of their affairs. Necessary writings are burned after serving their purpose and are considered to have never existed.<ref name="hidden strife brick" />

==Known Members==
* [[Chlothar Alberich]] (deceased)<ref group="Note">It is unknown if Chlothar had children besides Caribert. His status as nobility, the planning of his life, and the illegitimacy of Caribert make it possible.</ref>
