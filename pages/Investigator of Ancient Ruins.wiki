'''''Investigator of Ancient Ruins''''' is a [[World Quest]] in [[Fallingstar Fields]], [[Natlan]].

==Steps==
* Start the quest by approaching the ruins in [[Fallingstar Fields]]
# Defeat the monsters {{Enemy List|Hilichurl*2;Hilichurl Fighter}}
# Talk to the nearby tribespeople
# Clear the [[Abyss]]al monsters from the ruins 
#* Wave 1 (optional): {{Enemy List|Hilichurl*4}}
#* Wave 2: {{Enemy List|Tenebrous Mimesis - Anemo Hilichurl Rogue}}
#* Wave 3: {{Enemy List|Rockfond Rifthound Whelp*2}}
#* Wave 4: {{Enemy List|Tenebrous Mimesis: Tepetlisaurus*2}}
# Talk to the tribespeople

==Gameplay Notes==
* Completing either this quest or the quest ''[[A Brief History of Rocks]]'' can be used to complete the quest ''[[The Way Into the Mountain]]''. It is also possible to complete either quest before starting ''The Way Into the Mountain''.
* During step 3:
** The ruins can alternatively be entered by going around the back of it and dropping down a hole at the top.
** [[Little One]] will fight alongside the player.
** Interacting with the purple mimic [[Exquisite Chest]] will cause each chest to turn into an enemy one by one.
*** This will also initiate an earthquake, causing large stalactites to continuously fall and damage both the player and the enemies, dealing Physical DMG.
** It is sufficient to defeat the enemies spawned from interacting with the mimic Exquisite Chest to complete this step. Defeating any other enemies inside and outside the ruins are optional.
* Completing step 3 will award {{Item|Exquisite Chest|x=1}} and {{Item|Precious Chest|x=2}}, the latter of which has a notably high likelihood of containing {{Item|Sunset-Blue Obsidian Fragment|x=1}}.
* Completing step 4 will grant the {{Achievement|Spirited Eruption}}, unless this achievement was already granted during ''A Brief History of Rocks'', or while climbing the volcano directly.

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the ruins)
:'''???:''' What the... Where did all these monsters come from? Staying here really is a waste of "time"...
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon thinks she can hear someone calling for help! We should go take a look!

;(Approach the nearby tribespeople after defeating the enemies, optional)
:'''???:''' We're so... *panting* We're so grateful for your... assistance... Those monsters came out of... came out of nowhere, and... dealing with them just... *panting* takes so much time...
:'''Kimosi:''' You... You came just in time... I'm [[Kimosi]], from the [[Collective of Plenty]] and this... *panting* this is [[Nzaya]]... Okay, just give me a moment to catch my breath...
:'''Nzaya:''' If you care so much about time, Kimosi, it might be a good idea to work on your muscles a little more.
:'''Kimosi:''' Haha! Never gonna happen. I'm just not cut out for the battlefield... or for getting ripped. I prefer finding shortcuts to deal with my foes.
:'''Kimosi:''' We'll report back to the tribe and get them to send backup. That should improve our efficiency, increase safety, and...
:'''Nzaya:''' ...Save time. I've heard you say it so many times my brain is sore. The only time you don't care how long something takes is when you're telling stories &mdash; then you can keep talking from dusk till dawn.
:'''Kimosi:''' That's the whole point of saving time in the first place! So I can spend it on things I enjoy... Oh, we mustn't forget about our guests...
;(If ''The Way Into the Mountain'' has been started)
::{{DIcon}} Uhh... I take it you're "Uncle Kimosi"?
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon was just thinking that name sounded familiar!
::'''Kimosi:''' Uncle? As I recall, I only have one nephew... My goodness, [[Dutse]], look how you've grown! Why, you've blossomed into a {{MC|handsome young specimen of a man|charming young specimen of a woman}}!
::'''Nzaya:''' Cut the nonsense, Kimosi. If this was your unruly little imp of a nephew, I'd eat a hat.
::'''Kimosi:''' Oh, come on, I was just having a little fun.
:'''Kimosi:''' In any case, I really must thank you again for coming to our rescue. May I ask, what the two&mdash; no, three of you...
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe. Paimon's Paimon, and {{MC|he|she}}'s {{Traveler}}! And this is our little companion, {{Little One}}.
:'''Kimosi:''' Wonderful! Your [[Tepetlisaurus]] friend looks like a remarkable fellow, just like... just like a human. He even has his own clothes...
:'''Kimosi:''' If a scarf counts as an article of clothing, anyway.
:'''Nzaya:''' On you, I'm not sure it would. But on this little guy, that's exactly what it is...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrrawr?
:'''Kimosi:''' That's where we fall short of [[saurian]]s, I'm afraid. Hey, Nzaya, take a look at his horn...
:'''Nzaya:''' ...
:'''Kimosi:''' Are you going to the volcano, then?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? How did you know where we're headed!?
:'''Kimosi:''' Aha, and this is where smart, time-saving people show their worth. Now, let me guess what you're up to...
;(If ''A Brief History of Rocks'' has been completed)
::'''Kimosi:''' You want to enter the volcano, but you don't know how!
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, and that's where you'd be wrong. We already know how to do that!
::'''Kimosi:''' Haha, I see. So you're a smart person too... In which case, I have a matter I'd like to discuss with you, warriors who wish to enter the volcano. Do you have the time?
;(If ''A Brief History of Rocks'' has not been completed)
::'''Kimosi:''' You want to enter the volcano as well, right... It's possible, and I know the way. I could even tell you...
::{{DIcon}} But?
::{{DIcon}} There's always a "but" in sentences like this...
::'''Kimosi:''' Haha! I see you're a smart person too.
:'''Kimosi:''' Not far from here is an area containing [[Remnants of the Secret Source]] known as the [[Tephric Ruins]]... Let me explain...
:'''Kimosi:''' Long, long ago... back when [[Natlan]] was still a peaceful paradise...
:'''Nzaya:''' Ah, actually it was [[Cataclysm|500 years ago]], just as the [[Abyssal Corrosion|Abyssal corrosion]] in Natlan was at its worst &mdash; an entire section of ruins was spat out by the volcano.
:'''Kimosi:''' Hey now, do you not feel even a little guilty interrupting other people's stories?
:'''Nzaya:''' I'm just saving time, Kimosi. This is hardly the moment for storytelling &mdash; we're right in the middle of investigating the recent thefts at the Tephric Ruins.
:'''Kimosi:''' A witness from our tribe claims they saw one of the [[Qucusaur]]s that dwell nearby carrying off a statue from the ruins... We're here to find out what the situation is.
:'''Kimosi:''' But when we arrived, the whole ruin was crawling with Abyssal monsters. So I'm wondering... Could you maybe help us clean them out?
:'''Kimosi:''' If you can deal with the monsters, the Nzaya and I won't have to return to the tribe, and we can... save time.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrrawr?
:'''Paimon:''' So, you want us to go to these Tephric Ruins with you?
;(If ''A Brief History of Rocks'' has been completed)
::'''Kimosi:''' Nzaya and I will follow you there, but we won't take part in any fighting.
::'''Nzaya:''' Huh? But Kimosi, I'm not sure I understand. Surely, if we all work together, we can save even more time?
::'''Kimosi:''' Only the strongest warriors would dare to enter the volcano &mdash; amateurs like us would only hold them back. Safety comes first. I'm sure you can understand, my {{MC|handsome young specimen of a man|charming young specimen of a woman}}.
::'''Kimosi:''' Of course, if there's a need for the two of us to get involved...
::{{DIcon}} It's just a few monsters. No big deal.
::{{DIcon}} Perfectly! I accept the challenge.
;(If ''A Brief History of Rocks'' has not been completed)
::'''Kimosi:''' Nzaya and I will follow you there, but we won't take part in any fighting &mdash; not unless you end up in real trouble...
::'''Kimosi:''' Of course, you don't have to help, but in that case, my knowledge of how to enter the volcano will have to stay with me.
::'''Kimosi:''' If you run into danger, I'll guarantee your safety... But as for the road into the volcano, I won't tell you, and it's not up for debate.
::'''Kimosi:''' I have to be certain that you have the ability to deal with those monsters first.
::'''Nzaya:''' Wait a moment, Kimosi, I'm not sure I understand. Surely, if we all work together, we can save even more time?
::'''Kimosi:''' That is indeed true, but in this case... "safety" comes first. I'm sure you understand, my {{MC|handsome young specimen of a man|charming young specimen of a woman}}.
::{{DIcon}} Just a few monsters. No big deal.
::{{DIcon}} Perfectly! I accept the challenge.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph, it's only a few monsters. Stand back and watch. We'll be all like "pew-pew" and they'll be gone in no time!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Kimosi:''' You're certainly full of confidence... We'll stand back and see how you do.
:'''Nzaya:''' You strike me as powerful warriors, but don't push yourselves too hard... Kimosi likes to yammer on, but he said one thing worth listening to just now...
:'''Nzaya:''' Safety does come first. It's more important than saving time. In fact, it's way more important than anything else.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, don't worry about us &mdash; we've got this!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!

;(After talking to Kimosi and Nzaya)
:'''Paimon:''' The "Tephric Ruins," huh... Kinda hard to imagine a ruin erupting from a volcano in one solid chunk...
:'''Paimon:''' Wait a minute... Doesn't that mean there could still be more ruins inside?

;(Approach the giant stone door)
:;(The door slides shut)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, there's our Abyss problem. It looks like they've closed the door...
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like we need to find another way in...

;(Interact with the purple mimic exquisite chest)
:;(An earthquake starts, causing large stalactites to continuously fall)
::;(The mimic chests turn into enemies one by one)

;(After defeating the enemies)
:'''Paimon:''' Nice! Looks like we've beaten all the monsters within these Tephric Ruins!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, you're excited too, huh, little guy... Let's head back and report to Kimosi and company.
----
;(Approach Kimosi and Nzaya at the entrance to the ruins)
;(If Kimosi and Nzaya were not talked to before defeating the enemies in the ruins)
::'''???:''' Huh? What happened to the pitch-black monsters that were here... Did you defeat them all? That's fantastic news! Why, all the time you've saved...
::'''Kimosi:''' It looks like our luck's come in, Nzaya! 
::'''Nzaya:''' That's not a very "tribal warrior" thing to say, Kimosi... Was it you who cleared out all the Abyssal monsters here?
::'''Nzaya:''' You weren't wounded, were you? Wounds from Abyssal monsters can have severe consequences if not treated properly.
::{{DIcon}} Not so much as a scratch.
::'''Nzaya:''' That's good to hear...
::'''Kimosi:''' In any case, I really must thank you again for coming to our rescue. May I ask, what the two&mdash; no, three of you...
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe. Paimon's Paimon, and {{MC|he|she}}'s {{Traveler}}! And this is our little companion, {{Little One}}.
::'''Kimosi:''' Wonderful! Your Tepetlisaurus friend looks like a remarkable fellow, just like... just like a human. He even has his own clothes...
::'''Kimosi:''' If a scarf counts as an article of clothing, anyway.
::'''Nzaya:''' On you, I'm not sure it would. But on this little guy, that's exactly what it is...
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrrawr?
::'''Kimosi:''' That's where we fall short of saurians, I'm afraid. Hey, Nzaya, take a look at his horn...
::'''Nzaya:''' ...
::'''Kimosi:''' Are you going to the volcano, then?
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
::'''Paimon:''' Huh? How did you know where we're headed!?
::'''Kimosi:''' Aha, and this is where smart, time-saving people show their worth. Now, let me guess what you're up to...
::'''Kimosi:''' You want to enter the volcano as well, right... It's possible, and I know the way. I could even tell you...
::'''Kimosi:''' I'm impressed you were able to clear out the Abyssal monsters and come away unscathed, but...
::{{DIcon}} How did I know there would be a but...
::{{DIcon}} What's wrong now?
::'''Kimosi:''' Haha, it's nothing much, I just wanted to ask if you saw a statue. It should have been in the middle of the large platform in the ruins...
::'''Kimosi:''' A witness from our tribe claims they saw one of the Qucusaurs that dwell nearby carrying that statue off from the ruins... We're here to find out what the situation is.
::'''Nzaya:''' And that's when we discovered all these Abyssal monsters crawling out of the woodwork...
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Grroo...
::'''Kimosi:''' No? Well, that could pose a problem. The relics inside the ancient Remnants of the Secret Source are incredibly valuable, and they were deliberately placed in this section of ruins...
::'''Nzaya:''' It's impossible to know for sure where that Qucusaurus has taken it, so we'll just have to look for it later... Though speaking of nearby Qucusaurus dwellings...
::'''Kimosi:''' Perhaps it's on the [[Skyfire Circlet]]... Ah, that reminds me, you wanted to get inside the volcano, right? Well, there's no way in without first climbing the Circlet.
::'''Kimosi:''' And the way in is simple, but by no means easy. To cut to the chase, you'll need to jump in through the crater.
::;(Proceed to the next section)

;(If Kimosi and Nzaya were talked to before defeating the enemies in the ruins)
::'''Kimosi:''' Are things alright...?
::'''Paimon:''' All the monsters have been cleared out!
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
::'''Nzaya:''' I'm more concerned with whether you were wounded or not. Wounds from Abyssal monsters can have severe consequences if not treated properly.
::{{DIcon}} Not so much as a scratch.
:::'''Nzaya:''' That's good to hear...
::{{DIcon}} Just a teensy bit upset you didn't help out...
:::'''Kimosi:''' All the more proof that you didn't need our help.
::'''Kimosi:''' To clean out all the Abyssal monsters in the Tephric Ruins so quickly... It looks like you're even stronger than I thought, {{Traveler}}...
::'''Kimosi:''' Even stronger than the rumors say.
::'''Paimon:''' Huh, you've heard of us?
::'''Nzaya:''' Huh, we've heard of them?
::'''Kimosi:''' You spend too much time focusing on your muscles. If you took a break every now and then to chat with the couriers from the [[Scions of the Canopy]], you might have a better idea who we're talking to...
:;(If ''A Brief History of Rocks'' has been completed){{verify|May instead be dependent on previously getting the "Spirited Eruption" achievement}}
:::'''Kimosi:''' You have our gratitude, warriors. Thanks to you, we can finally complete our investigation and report back to the tribe.
:::'''Kimosi:''' I wish you a smooth journey. After all, a smooth journey means you can quickly reach your target, and quickness...
:::{{DIcon}} ...Saves time!
:::'''Kimosi:''' Exactly!
:::'''Nzaya:''' Indeed, thank you so much for your assistance. Who knows what we'd have done without the great {{Traveler}}, Paimon, and their saurian friend!
:::'''Nzaya:''' May we meet again!
:::;(Quest completes)
:;(If ''A Brief History of Rocks'' has not been completed){{verify|May instead be dependent on previously not getting the "Spirited Eruption" achievement}}
::;({{cx}})
:::'''Kimosi:''' Hmm... Did you see a statue? It should have been in the middle of the large platform in the ruins...
:::'''{{Little One}}:''' Grroo...
:::'''Kimosi:''' I guess it must be missing... We'll just have to look for it later...
::'''Kimosi:''' Anyway, enough chitchat. Seeing as you've shown that you're more than capable of dealing with the Abyss, it's time for me to tell you how to enter the volcano...
::'''Nzaya:''' Hold up. What does dealing with the Abyss have to do with entering the volcano?
::{{DIcon}} The Abyss must have a presence inside...
:::'''Kimosi:''' Exactly! And based on the condition of objects recently ejected from the volcano, it's clear that the Abyssal corrosion has gotten worse.
::{{DIcon}} It was an excuse to get me to do his work for him...
:::'''Kimosi:''' As I'm sure you realized when I offered you this deal, my {{MC|handsome young specimen of a man|charming young specimen of a woman}}. That said, there are indeed a large number of these pitch-black monsters inside the volcano...
::'''Kimosi:''' Not everyone on the exploration team made it back... I still remember a monster disguising itself as one of my companions in distress...
:;(If ''[[Incandescent Ode of Resurrection]]'' has been completed)
:::{{DIcon}} But isn't [[Gosoythoth]] already...
:::'''Kimosi:''' The Abyss is like a disease rooted in the [[Ley Line]]s &mdash; it comes on as suddenly as a landslide but recedes slowly like unraveling silk... In unseen corners, the seeds of sickness continue to fester...
:::'''Kimosi:''' And there are rumors that the space inside the volcano is unique... Perhaps even the shadowy hands of the [[Lord of the Night]] cannot reach inside...
::'''Kimosi:''' Either way, {{Traveler}}, it's an incredibly dangerous place. Are you sure you want to go there knowing that?
::{{DIcon}} I'm certain...
::{{DIcon}} We've already made our minds up, so...
::'''Kimosi:''' Alright... The way in is simple, but by no means easy. To cut to the chase, you'll need to jump in through the crater.
::;(Proceed to the next section)
----
;(Continuing from the previous section)
:'''Paimon:''' Through... the crater?
:'''Kimosi:''' Do you see those floating rocks around the crater? [[Phlogiston]]'s gaseous state causes them to float there during eruptions...
:'''Kimosi:''' The end result is what's known as the "{{Rubi|Skyfire Circlet|Nahuatzin's Springboard}}"... I'm not sure who came up with that name, but it could do with a bit of work.
:'''Kimosi:''' If you climb to the highest point on the Skyfire Circlet, you should be facing the volcano's crater directly. The crater is filled with unstable [[gaseous Phlogiston]], which forms something of a wall...
:'''Kimosi:''' But, haha, I'm sure you'll be able to find a way to jump down through it!
:'''Nzaya:''' Really? Didn't you tell me that very few people outside the [[Flower-Feather Clan]] have ever made it through...
:'''Kimosi:''' I'm just explaining the way. As to the means our intrepid travelers take to get there... Well, that's got nothing to do with me!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrrwar? Mrrroo?
:;(The earth begins to tremble)
:'''Paimon:''' It's an earthquake... Wait, no &mdash; the volcano's erupting!
:;(The volcano erupts, causing nearby wildlife to flee. A [[Spiritway]] forms, leading down near the entrance of the Tephric Ruins.)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah! The volcano erupted again. Seriously, every time that happens, Paimon's heart jumps out her chest!
:'''Kimosi:''' Haha, for those of us in the Collective of Plenty, we hardly even notice anymore. Still, you've always got to be on the lookout for things falling from the sky...
:'''Paimon:''' Okay, so we need to find a way up to that Skyfire Circlet, right?
:'''Kimosi:''' Precisely... Anyway, we've fulfilled our end of the bargain. Nzaya, I think it's about time we got going.
:'''Nzaya:''' Huh, you're not going with them?
:'''Kimosi:''' The volcano isn't somewhere that someone like me has any business going near. Not to mention, Abyssal monsters turning up in the ruins is something we'll need to report to the tribe.
:'''Paimon:''' Okay, don't worry about it! Now that we know how to get in, we'll take it from here!
:'''Kimosi:''' I wish you a smooth journey. After all, a smooth journey means getting in quick and getting out quicker, and being quick...
:{{DIcon}} ...Saves time!
:'''Kimosi:''' That's right! Haha.
:'''Nzaya:''' One last thing &mdash; Safety. Comes. First!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Understood!
:;(Quest completes)
----
;(If the Spiritway was unlocked during this quest)
:'''Paimon:''' Y'know, we might be able to use the Spiritways created by the volcanic eruptions to climb up to the Skyfire Circlet...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, y'think so too? Let's give it a shot, then!
