==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Faruzan's hair is styled with an X-shaped golden hairpin on the left side, and several golden triangular and X-shaped hairpins on the back side. The locks of hair that mimic twintails hang loose.<!-- where it meets her head, there is NOTHING but a bump, look at it -->

Faruzan wears a layered white dress with detached sleeves, decorated with numerous golden trinkets and gems, most notably around the neck and upper arms. She has a set of X-shaped trinkets pinned just above her skirt, which is decorated with some flower-shaped pieces held together by dark blue ribbons with a dark blue undercoat with a design similar to an isometric grid filled with blue and green. Under this, she wears a gold trinket around her right thigh, and a pair of high heeled sandals. She wears a set of gold square-shaped bracelets on her left wrist along with a gold ring on her middle finger, and a number of chained jewelry around her wrist and right hand. Her {{Anemo}} [[Vision]] is pinned to the back of her skirt.
