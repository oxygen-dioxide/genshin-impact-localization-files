|A murder case unfolded in the midst of [[Lyney]] and [[Lynette]]'s first performance at the grand opera house. Though they were cleared of the accusations leveled against them, their identities as agents of the [[House of the Hearth]] were revealed.

{{A|vo fdaq308 11 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' You defeated the Hydro Archon in the very first duel you took part in at the opera house. That's one for the history books, alright!

|It turns out that Fontainians can be dissolved by Water from the [[Primordial Sea]]. Over the years, [[Vacher]] kidnapped and dissolved many young girls for his experiments to try and find a way to bring back [[Vigneire|his wife]], who had been dissolved.

{{A|vo fdaq308 11 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I didn't think that you'd wind up getting to the bottom of the case I'd been following all this time. I guess you could also see this as a happy coincidence...?

|Though [[Neuvillette]] believed [[Childe]] to be innocent, the [[Oratrice]] judged him as guilty in the end, and even [[Furina]] didn't know why.

{{A|vo fdaq308 11 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' This is the first time Monsieur Neuvillette's had a difference of opinion with the Oratrice. Even the Hydro Archon can't figure it out.

|During the diplomatic meeting with [[The Knave]], she revealed that she had already probed Furina on her own, and believes it is possible that not only is Furina not really the Archon, but that she is actually afflicted with some sort of curse.

{{A|vo fdaq308 11 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' A [[Fatui Harbinger]]... She's an extraordinary person. Her instinct must mean something.

|The entrance to the Primordial Sea is sealed beneath the forbidden zone in the [[Fortress of Meropide]], and recently, the Primordial Sea has nearly broken out. It was only temporarily pushed back by Neuvillette's power.

{{A|vo fdaq308 11 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' The Fortress of Meropide was almost destroyed in a single day... That I didn't witness that scene personally will always be source of a professional regret, I think.

|You saw Childe floating in the sea in a dream, as well as [[All-Devouring Narwhal|an indescribably massive whale]].

{{A|vo fdaq308 11 charlotte 06.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' According to Monsieur Neuvillette, both Childe and that whale should have been in the Primordial Sea at that time.

|While exploring the ruin near [[Poisson]], it began to collapse and [[Navia]] fell into water containing Primordial Seawater. Only the protection of the dead members of the [[Spina di Rosula]] prevented her from dissolving.

{{A|vo fdaq308 11 charlotte 07.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I nearly lost my awesome friend Navia... To be honest, that still gives me the shivers.

|[[Nicole Reeyn|"N"]] communicated with you by connecting your consciousnesses. She believes the prophecy will certainly happen, but that you needn't give up all hope.

{{A|vo fdaq308 11 charlotte 08.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' The words of someone as extraordinary as a witch can probably only be truly understood when something surreal happens to you.
