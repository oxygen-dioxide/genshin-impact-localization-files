|text      = Just now, when I was relaxing under a tree, I accidentally fell asleep and ended up being knocked on the head by a falling [[Sunsettia]]...

But thanks to that sweet little fruit, I thought of a new song. Naturally, I'll let you be the first to hear it.

It's a fine day out, so how about we take a walk together through the open country? We can get some fresh air and leave our worries far behind.

In the evening, we'll stop somewhere with a good view and I'll play my new song for you. I wouldn't want to get so caught up in the journey that I'd miss out on watching the sunset with an important friend!

[[Mondstadt]]'s gentle breeze awaits your return from far afield. Just try not to get lost on the way!
