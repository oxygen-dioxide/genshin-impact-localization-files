|text      = Hey, buddy! How've you been? Heard you're in [[Natlan]] tackling some "big meals" over there? Haha, just kidding! Anyway, it's my birthday today, so how about coming over for dinner?

With this cold weather, nothing beats a hotpot feast, right? My [[Yip Tak|Dad]] dragged me to the market this morning to pick out the freshest ingredients &mdash; top-notch stuff, guaranteed! 

Oh, and besides hotpot, Dad's planning to whip up a full-on Nine Great Dishes spread. So you and [[Paimon]] absolutely have to come, yeah? Make sure you arrive with an empty stomach. I've already brewed some palate-cleansing tea so you can eat loads! If we don't finish it all, those same dishes will haunt the dining table tomorrow, the day after, and maybe even the day after that... Ugh, just thinking about it makes me terrified!

But don't worry, my Dad's an amazing cook. Plus, with Paimon around, clearing the plates will be nothing but a piece of cake, haha!

Alright, I'm off to practice now. Better get ready for tonight's epic feast!
