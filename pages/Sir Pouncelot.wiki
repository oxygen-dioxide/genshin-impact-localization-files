'''Sir Pouncelot''' is a cat and an event-exclusive [[NPC]] who appeared in ''[[Feline Fortress Furrdyssey]]''.

==Profile==
He was once a very fierce creature due to having long been subject to stimulating encounters with wild creatures, but after much comforting from the Traveler and [[Paimon]], he has become an obedient kitty once more.

===Appearance===
Sir Pouncelot is a giant orange cat with a scar on his right eye. He wears a scarf emblazoned with the [[Knights of Favonius]] insignia around his neck, and another can be found wrapped around near the end of his tail.
