==Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Punch:''' Approaches and swings its fist at the player, dealing '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}.
*'''Pyro Slime Throw:''' Digs a [[Pyro Slime]] out of the ground, ignites it and throws it at the player, dealing AoE DMG. Staggering the Grenadier during this attack will knock the Pyro Slime out of its hands. A Pyro Slime knocked out of the Grenadier's hands will stay on the ground for a period of time before exploding and dealing AoE DMG.
**The Pyro Slime's explosion deals '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Pyro DMG}} by default.
**The Pyro Slime is initially infused with {{Pyro}}, and can [[Elemental Reactions|react]] with {{Hydro}}, {{Cryo}}, {{Electro}}, {{Anemo}}, {{Geo}}, as well as cause {{Pyro}} [[Elemental Absorption]]s.
***Triggering an Elemental Reaction on the Pyro Slime will extinguish its flames. When extinguished, its explosions deal '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}}.
