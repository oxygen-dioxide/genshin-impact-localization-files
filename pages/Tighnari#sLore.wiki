==Personality==
{{Quote|A young researcher well-versed in botany who currently serves as a Forest Watcher in Avidya Forest. He is a straight shooter with a warm heart &mdash; and a dab hand at guiding even the dullest of pupils.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
Being a Forest Watcher, Tighnari is highly knowledgeable about various species of both plants and animals, particularly flowers and mushrooms, having grown an interest due to studying his parents' books when he was young. He spends a great deal of time in Sumeru's rainforests, studying various species of plants and ensuring that the ecosystem is healthy and balanced. As the Chief Officer of the Forest Watchers, he takes his job very seriously and offers advice to those willing to listen and sternly lectures those who don't. He is very loyal to those whom he considers his friends and cares about them very deeply. 

Due to his [[Valuka Shuna]] heritage, Tighnari is particularly sensitive to weather, disliking the wind and thunder. While his kind used to live in the desert, Tighnari, having a darker shade of fur (which he attributes to his kind migrating to the forests), is notably unable to tolerate the desert heat, causing him to suffer from heatstroke faster than others. He acknowledges this as one of his weaknesses.

He serves as a mentor to [[Collei]], who in turn sees him as a Master of some sorts and holds him with high regard. He places a lot of value on knowledge, and thus oversees her education seriously, ensuring that she understands the content to the best of her ability. While he is friends with [[Cyno]], he does not appreciate his jokes, having been exposed to many unfunny jokes and considers them embarrassing.

==Appearance==

Tighnari uses the [[:Category:Medium Male Characters|medium male]] model. He has fair skin, chin-length dark green hair with black roots and light green streaks at the front, and pale-pupiled eyes that fade from brown to green. He also possesses large, pointy black ears and a fluffy tail in two shades of dark green.

{{Quote|A message for you. I brought back a specialty from the desert, two packs of honeyed dates, which helps to replenish your energy, whether in the morning or at night. Thank you for your patience in teaching and taking care of Collei. Good luck with your work and best wishes for Collei's studies.|An anonymously written message left inside a candy box, placed on the watcher's table.}}
People who encounter misfortunes in the [[Avidya Forest]] are lucky to meet a Forest Watcher named Tighnari.

But if you land yourself in trouble due to foolish antics, you might have mixed feelings meeting Tighnari.

Tighnari resolves problems quickly and professionally, but at the same time, he will give the other party a stern lecture.

As the saying goes, those who underestimate the rainforest will get taught a lesson by it, and those who underestimate a Forest Watcher will eventually face the teachings of the "Wilderness Survival Skills Lecture."

These are all rumors, but in reality, there is no need to be too stressed when encountering Tighnari. Anyone with a clear head will be able to comprehend his easy-to-understand explanations.

As for those who are set in their ways&mdash;

"What a pity, I majored in botany, and helping people grow a brain is not my area of expertise."

              --><p>Arbitrarily occupied camps, shacks built by the destruction of vegetation, domestic waste dumps that may become sources of pollution, bonfire embers that have yet to fully be extinguished...</p><!--
              --><p>In response to such situations, they must not only solve the problem at hand but also try to admonish the perpetrators, and yet these exhortations are not always accurately communicated.</p><!--
              --><p>This would improve greatly after Tighnari joined the Forest Watchers.</p><!--
              --><p>Part of this is his scholarly rigor &mdash; the way in which he will unceremoniously "teach" the troublemakers.</p><!--
              --><p>But more importantly, Tighnari is able to communicate the correct way to act and the reasons behind that in a manner most comprehensible to those he teaches.</p><!--
              --><p>The way he sees it, these crafts of living out in the wilds are also knowledge, and that getting people to accept knowledge is an art in and of itself.</p><!--
              --><p>It is far more useful to be straightforward about the other part's errors and what is at stake as opposed to dryly giving advice.</p><!--
              --><p>This is also why Tighnari has disagreements with the Akademiya's purveying of the [[Akasha Terminal]].</p><!--
              --><p>Knowledge is, in truth, the treasure of all living things. It should be passionately embraced by those who are curious about it as opposed to becoming a tool for survival, doled out in limited amounts.</p><!--
              --><p>Unfortunately, as a young researcher, Tighnari did not have anywhere near the clout to stand against the Akademiya, and even now he can only do what he can in a limited capacity.</p><!--

              --><p>As such, the highly active Tighnari leapt into action to turn things around.</p><!--
              --><p>He created a rationalized forest patrol log, assigned tasks according to each {{sic|person’s}} strengths, and regularly conducted natural history training for his fellow team members...</p><!--

              --><p>"Do we actually have that rank? Or are we going for something similar to 'General Mahamatra'?"</p><!--
              --><p>Whatever the case, Tighnari would eventually prevail upon everyone to go back to calling him "Forest Watcher," "Master," or "Mr. Tighnari."</p><!--
              --><p>"I'm afraid 'General Watchleader' is too great a title for me to bear," or so he said.</p><!--
              --><p>"Heh, that actually reminded me of a joke someone once told about the title of 'General Mahamatra'..."</p><!--

|text4         = <p>There was a time when a certain vibrantly-colored flower was all the rage amongst the people of Sumeru. Many people would buy it to adorn their houses, and thus it gradually became a trend.</p><!--
              --><p>Unfortunately, this flower was not long for the world if removed from the rainforest, and would only last two days at best if so plucked.</p><!--
              --><p>Flowers that were no longer fresh would soon be discarded, left by the wayside to rot &mdash; a shame by any standard of imagination.</p><!--
              --><p>This could not go on. Never mind the garbage or pollution-related issues, this trend ran the risk of damaging the forest ecosystem if it persisted long enough.</p><!--
              --><p>However, just as the Forest Rangers were mulling over this problem, Tighnari would send out an offer of cooperation with the flower sellers in the city:</p><!--
              --><p>The Forest Rangers would help them gather fresh flowers for free, but that they should provide an additional service, informing those who came to purchase the flowers that if they sent them back by the second day, they would obtain a receipt that could then be exchanged within the next 3 days for a dried flower decoration.</p><!--
              --><p>These decorations were of course provided by Tighnari and the Forest Rangers. The option to pay for them and how much to pay would be left up to the buyer of the flowers, just as things might go at a charity bazaar.</p><!--
              --><p>Part of this Mora would go to the store owner as service charge for collecting the leftover flowers, and the rest would be used for funding the Forest Rangers' efforts to maintain the rainforest.</p><!--
              --><p>This cooperation went quite smoothly indeed. The flower shop owners saved themselves the trouble of searching deep within the rainforest for their floral quarry and got some extra income; the Forest Rangers got to control the process and amount of flowers gathered, and also got some extra funds; those who bought flowers would not only receive a temporary flower as a companion, but also a more permanent memento.</p><!--
              --><p>This all went quite swimmingly, but some rangers did not understand, asking: "Why didn't we just ban the gathering of such flowers in the first place? Wouldn't that have been simpler?"</p><!--
              --><p>Tighnari shook his head when he heard this answer, causing his ears to shake.</p><!--
              --><p>"We shouldn't make such simple calculations. If we were to force our requests through, we would be just like a stolid lecturer who fails to have others understand, but who stirs up feelings of rebellion instead."</p><!--
              --><p>"If that were to happen, our reputation would be the least of our woes &mdash; we would have our hands full trying to deal with those who were coming to pick flowers illegally!"</p><!--

              --><p>Pragmatic as these words were, they quickly found traction with the Forest Rangers. Collei's nods were particularly rapid.</p><!--

              --><p>Although he has spent much time meditating on his research and has spent comparatively little on cultivating relationships, he did wind up stumbling into a good number of comrades nonetheless.</p><!--
              --><p>Tighnari had excellent grades in the Akademiya early on, and many would come to him for help with their coursework. When his seminar courses would end, he would often go along with requests for group photos.</p><!--
              --><p>Not that he really understood them, but he agreed anyway.</p><!--
              --><p>That was how "Tighnari knows everything, and he's so nice to talk to!" became a widespread saying, causing many to fight for his time. Even students from other Darshans would want to collaborate with him.</p><!--

              --><p>Slowly, however, he found that as his knowledge increased, the unknowns that he wished to explore also grew more numerous.</p><!--
              --><p>For example, why were other people born without ears and tails like that of his family?</p><!--
              --><p>Flipping through all the ancient tomes he could find in his home, Tighnari discovered a manuscript left behind by an ancestor of his that concerned "Valuka Shuna."</p><!--
              --><p>As the records claimed, Valuka Shuna were a race subject to [[King Deshret]], and who dwelled in the vast desert, mostly possessing light-colored fur and large ears that were excellent at dissipating heat.</p><!--
              --><p>Later, calamity would descend and destroy King Deshret's realm, with the Valuka Shuna only surviving due to the grace of the [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|Dendro Archon]], which turned their fur green.</p><!--
              --><p>"It is worth noting that while Valuka Shuna were noted to have been more like foxes, the meaning of their name was 'large desert dog.'"</p><!--
              --><p>"According to a human friend of mine who has a very close relationship with the forest, it was a little creature known as an [[Aranara]] that gave them this name."</p><!--

              --><p>But of course, such technicalities were of no importance to an excited child. Thus did Tighnari immediately ask his father to bring him &mdash; the 'large desert dog' &mdash; back to the desert to have a look on his next surveying trip.</p><!--
              --><p>Unfortunately, they met with an accident. Not a few meters into the desert, Tighnari fell into a faint from the heat and had to be rushed back to the rainforest.</p><!--
              --><p>"Oh no," Tighnari thought sadly as he convalesced in his treehouse, "the 'large desert dogs' have devolved in my generation."</p><!--

              --><p>The former is simple. Foxes and dogs are, biologically speaking, both canines, so the Aranara might have viewed them as interchangeable.</p><!--

* The name Tighnari is likely derived in part from {{Lang|{{w|al-Tighnari}}|ar=الطغنري}}, an Arab botanist, traveler, physician, and poet from the period of Islamic Golden Age. Tignar is the name of the disappeared village where al-Tighnari was born and nicknamed as, which is located between the existing Albolote and Macarena in the province of {{w|Granada}}, modern day Spain.
* Additionally, the name Tighnari also has roots in {{w|Berber languages|Tamazight}}, a major language of the {{w|Berbers|Amazigh}}, an ethnic group indigenous to, and spread throughout, North Africa. Much of Tighnari's design has potential inspirations from traditional Amazigh clothing and accessories, and his ears and tail are those of a {{w|fennec fox}}, also native to North Africa, making it likely that his name is an allusion to both the Arabic and Tamazight origins.
