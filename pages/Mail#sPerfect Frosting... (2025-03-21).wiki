|text      = Today's commission report is as follows! The tasks that I assisted with were surprisingly relaxing... I was asked to survey some beautiful scenery, and taste-test some delicious food... I understand everyone's good intentions, so I'll complete these commissions earnestly!

It's been a while since I've had a leisurely walk outdoors. Today, the wind in [[Mondstadt]] seems to carry the fragrance of [[Dandelion Wine]], and the [[Valberry|Valberries]] and [[Berry|berries]] are especially fresh. I plan to make a berry cake to thank everyone!

But... although I often say "leave it to me," when it comes to things that require precise control like "sprinkling a perfect layer of frosting onto something," I'm not too confident about getting it right...

If you were here, you could use your [[Anemo]] powers to spread the frosting evenly. Would you mind lending a hand?

Don't worry! I'll definitely save the biggest and sweetest fruit on top of the cake, just for you!
