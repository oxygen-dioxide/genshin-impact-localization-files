|text1    = A machine created from the union between [[Fontaine]]'s intricate device and special energy technologies. Based on whether it's imbued with {{Color|help|[[ousia]] or [[pneuma]]}} energy, the machine will operate differently in battle. When either energy is annihilated upon being {{Color|help|attacked by its opposite}}, an Overloaded state will be induced, causing the machine to lose energy and its combat capabilities.
