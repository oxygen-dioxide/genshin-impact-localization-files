|description    = The windwheel is emblematic of Mondstadt. Its giant arms turn in response to the wind, generating ample energy.<br />Having read some [[Snezhnaya]]n literature on the topic, one alchemist thinks that it may well be possible to store the energy generated by windmills using a mechanism fashioned from a combination of Pyro and Electro slimes. But even if his experiment were to succeed, the [[Knights of Favonius]] would never allow such a dangerous plan to proceed.
