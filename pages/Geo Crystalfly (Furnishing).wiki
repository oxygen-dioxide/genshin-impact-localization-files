|description    = Pure elemental life-forms composed of drifting Geo particles, as free and unbound as the butterflies they resemble.<br>A glittering [[Geo]] creature that is the product of rising and condensing elements, and which feeds off the ubiquitous power of Geo.<br>In antediluvian ages, even rocks could dream. They say that these crystallized flying butterflies are those very dreams the mountains had. Perhaps after hovering over the sky suffused with [[Sub-Space Creation]] energies for a long time, their posture will assume the form of pens and knives, etching these shadowed dreams into the Serenitea Pot.
