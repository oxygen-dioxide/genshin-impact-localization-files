|description    = The Violetgold Angler Gull is a medium-sized seabird with violet and gold plumage whose primary habitat is in [[Fontaine]].<br>They are not a timid bird species and have been known to snatch greasy food from the hands of passersby at the port. Sometimes, they are even bold enough to try stealing fresh catch from fishing boats.<br>On the bright side, after they stole [[Tubby]]'s snacks, Tubby furiously threw huge teacup lids at them. Every single lid struck home, shooting down its intended target. Now, the Violetgold Angler Gulls living in the Serenitea Pot are much better behaved, and the worst mischief they get up to is flocking together to discuss "how to get Tubby to give them some snacks."
