::{{Black Screen|"A Brief Analysis of Possible Events of Historical Importance in the Tatarasuna Area"}}
::Details: This text belongs to a series of works sponsored by the Vahumana's "Veilcutter" project. It has yet to be numbered.<br><br>
::Author: Aqaba<br><br>
::Abstract: The Tatarasuna area has always been a major pillar of Inazuma's smithing industry. Two incidents have occurred here, and the details behind the first are vague at best. I believe, however, that there might a hidden history behind the events that transpired. Hence, this paper will attempt to analyze what may have unfolded from the available data.<br><br><br>
::Glossary: Tatarasuna area; Raiden Gokaden; Mikoshi Nagamasa<br><br>
::Introduction: This paper continues and expands the work of my mentor, Mr. Rumi, in his report on "Haply Hidden Tales of Tatarasuna," and is intended to further this avenue of research. According to the data, the blade-forging techniques of Inazuma were originally handed down from the Electro Archon, also known as the Raiden Shogun. Using the arts they inherited from their Archon, the people of Inazuma devoted themselves to the process of forging. However, strange rumors that do not quite fit the steely nature of metalwork yet linger about Tatarasuna's smelting center, which was a central pillar of the forging industry. There, the Mikoshi and Niwa Clans, along with an eccentric mechanic from abroad, serve as the three windows of insight we need to investigate the truth behind what happened.<br><br><br>
::Body<br><br>
::Strange notes from the Tatarasuna area. Their contents are as follows:<br><br>
::1
::"...Perhaps I overstep, but I think that Sir Nagamasa's mood grows better when he forges blades..."
::"...The obsession to cleanse the stain of the name 'Mikoshi' must eat at him..."<br><br>
::2
::"...The Inspector bought a certain number of Jade Steel ingots..."
::"...Sir Katsuragi discussed matters of smithing deep into the night with the Vice Armory Officer."<br><br><br>
::3
::"...We at last made a single nagamaki. We call it the 'Daitatara Nagamasa'..."
::"The Inspector was in high spirits, and he and the Vice Armory Officer..."
::"...Nozomu was so taken by the beauty of the Daitatara Nagamasa that he drew a picture of it..."<br><br><br>
::4
::"...The Inspector flew into a rage and slashed Katsuragi. The great blade cut deep into the flesh...cast his own nagamaki into the furnace's flame..."
::"...Nozomu could not abide by that order, and drew the completely melted weapon out of the furnace... He was horribly burned..."<br><br><br>
::5
::"...Nozomu died that night. I daresay that while Sir Katsuragi may have committed malfeasance, it was out of the goodness of his heart..."<br><br>
::6
::"...Kinjirou hid the nagamaki and Nozomu's drawing in the Arsenal..."
::"...Nagamasa is harsh, but also knows right from wrong. But even so, he is not amenable to reason. His name indicates one obsessed with purity... Still, I and some households of Tatarasuna have not been blinded by the matter of Nagamasa's mother Chiyo, and we trust him..."
::"...I also remain unwilling to forget the joy of creating the Daitatara Nagamasa with him..."<br><br>
::7
::"Before we withdrew, we should have divided the Arsenal Key into three parts: one for the Inspector, one for the Armory Officer, and one to be left in Tatarasuna itself to prevent theft."
::"But we were in too much of a hurry, and neither the Inspector nor the Armory Officer could be found, so I was so bold as to hide the three pieces within treasure chests in Tatarasuna..."<br><br><br>
::The seven notes mentioned prior have been scattered across the Tatarasuna area. Among the seven notes, six seem to be of good physical integrity, though they all look quite old, while the last one looks more recent. I believe that the first six notes and the last are of different time periods, though the gulf in years between them needs to be verified. The contents of the first six should also be related to each other, as the incidents mentioned are quite consistent with one another.
::Rumi once mentioned in "Haply Hidden Tales of Tatarasuna" (hereafter known as "Hidden Tales") that in the past, researchers from Sumeru had investigated the cultural histories of Tatarasuna and Inazuma. Though the place has fallen into some degree of disrepair since the "Hidden Tales" were written, things have improved since the time when I wrote my original article. Regardless, what used to be an area of major industry remains a place most inhospitable, and residents of Tatarasuna may be found living and dwelling by the waters. The residents, when questioned, told the researchers of Tatarasuna's golden age centuries ago, when it was administered by Armory Officer Niwa, Vice Armory Officer Miyazaki, and Inspector Mikoshi Nagamasa. Yet, the elders among the locals with deeper ties to the region also seemed to stress the fact that there were strange rumors surrounding their homeland's past.
::{{Color|help|A great many of these rumors revolved around the "youkai" who are so very characteristic of Inazuma's folk histories. A small portion, however, repeatedly mentions the word "outsider." It should be known that the appearance of such a character, who is suspected to be based on a real person, is a very curious case. This fact drew the attention of the researchers to delve further, and eventually, the following pieces of information came to light:}}
::{{Color|help|- A foreign mechanic once visited Tatarasuna. Reportedly, the reason for his immigration was to exchange knowledge and forge ties with the locals. However, the mechanic seemed to behave suspiciously, often wandering around essential or restricted areas. And if someone tried to turn him away, they would only earn incomprehensible mumbles from his lips.}}
::{{Color|help|- The mechanic often stared into the furnace, seemingly to check on its condition. Unsettlingly, he also spent a substantial amount of time watching the local residents.}}<br><br>
::{{Color|help|Judging from the era, it was not uncommon to see cross-cultural exchanges of technical knowledge in places such as Tatarasuna. After traveling across the tides, foreign experts being welcome in the region was likely not unreasonable either. Yet, calamity came not long after this exchange of knowledge, which hints at high potential for causation between these events. However, some current residents believe that these assumptions were merely the results of their forebears' overactive imaginations attempting to theorize how things actually unfolded.}}<br><br>
::A list of individuals related to Tatarasuna has been compiled here based on historical documents from Inazuma. Starting from the administrators, the records are as follows.<br><br>
::Armory Officer &mdash; Niwa
::Full name Niwa Hisahide. He was the inheritor of the Isshin Art, and successor to the Niwa Clan. His family, along with the Akame and Kaedehara clans, were together known as the "Isshin Sansaku." Records show that Niwa was a modest and intelligent individual who displayed remarkable talent in the administration of territory and people. His eventual whereabouts are unknown, but he was suspected to have left Tatarasuna with his family following the incident.<br><br>
::Vice Armory Officer &mdash; Miyazaki
::Full name Miyazaki Kaneo. He was Niwa's second-in-command. His origins are unknown, and he primarily assisted Niwa in forging and personnel management. He was of affable temperament and had many friends in the region, including one Mikoshi Nagamasa.<br><br>
::Inspector &mdash; Mikoshi Nagamasa
::The successor of the Mikoshi Clan, adopted son to oni warrior Mikoshi Chiyo, and the younger adopted brother to Mikoshi Michihiro, also known as "Iwakura the Successor." With his mother missing and abandoned by his brother, Nagamasa alone bore the family name, striving daily to wipe the shame from their history. Though records state that Mikoshi Nagamasa was a stubborn figure, he was also noted to be a person of moral virtue and integrity. It has been noted in various records that he practiced forging swords for self-cultivation, and specially requested special instruction from Miyazaki to further his capabilities. However, after the famous blade, Daitatara Nagamasa, was forged, he used it to slay his subordinate, Katsuragi, for reasons unknown at present.<br><br>
::Subordinate &mdash; Katsuragi
::Katsuragi's full name and background remain unknown. Despite all the materials I have sorted through, I have yet to find anymore additional personal information regarding him. As one of Mikoshi Nagamasa's subordinates, he was a loyal warrior who had been saved by Nagamasa in his youth. From then on, he swore to stick by his lord through thick and thin and to give his life in service if it was but asked of him.<br><br>
::{{Color|help|The Mechanic}}
::{{Color|help|Long have I delved through many texts and documents, but I was ultimately unable to decipher even a specter of a clue as to his background. Still, mentions of the mechanic grew scarcer in the aftermath of the Tatarasuna incident. I speculate that, instead of the mechanic possibly being a figure woven from over-ripe imaginations, he actually did exist, and perhaps even had a hand in the events that took place in Tatarasuna.}}<br><br><br>

::Extract I<br><br>
::...
::...
::A man arrived in Tatarasuna around three in the afternoon. From afar, he spied laborers walking along the mountain roads toward the factories, their shoes scuffing along the jutting stones. They walked like people convinced that so long as they reached the fire raging in the mountain's belly, they might extract from it gems beyond price. The mood that the sight inspired was ineffable, beyond mere description for those not present to witness it.
::The man barked a cheerful greeting and sprinted to join the procession. There, a towering character who stood half a head taller greeted him with a heavy slap on the back, and yet, his words were filled with respect: "Do my eyes deceive me? Sir Miyazaki! I cannot think that the return trip here from Inazuma City could have been easy on you."
::Miyazaki smiled like a young man taking the first steps on their journey, expression relaxed. "Why Katsuragi, Inazuma is the realm of the Almighty Shogun. I sailed upon the fastest ship, strode upon the swiftest sea routes. What dangers could I have possibly faced?"
::"And what about the good news?"
::"There was some... Naturally." The two burst into uproarious laughter, roughhousing with the other workers until the path's end.<br><br>
::A young man dressed in a linen shirt and wearing a headscarf gazed into the dancing flames of the furnace before him.
::Now, the flames of a forge are unlike any other, for their intensity affects the resulting integrity of both metal and blade. So too, then, was the flame-watcher an unusual individual. At his fingertips sat a lizard, and on his face he wore a smile.
::The workshop was huge, and the furnace was deeper within. A reasonable person might think that there should have been many working alongside the watcher, yet he stood alone. Only when Katsuragi and Miyazaki strode into the room did the watcher turn.
::This watcher was Niwa, Armory Officer and administrator of Tatarasuna. Born to the Niwa Clan, which served as one of the three pillars of the Isshin Art, Niwa never argued with his siblings and was a worthy successor by all accounts. The post he received as a result of his high standing with those in power served as a statement unto itself.
::Miyazaki handed a well-bundled text to Niwa as he adjusted his expression is said: "It is as you have said, sir. The elders of your clan in the city do not think highly of our plan. Yet I still believe it to be worth a try. As such, I have found the proper vendors and procured the materials that you requested."
::Niwa studied the text and nodded. "We should try some of these new forging techniques, whether Kaedehara says yea or nay."
::Katsuragi frowned, and with a sigh he said: "Forging is a precise and difficult undertaking. You know this better than most, sirs, and still, you seek improvement each day with terrifying drive! Ah, should my lord Nagamasa hear this, the sourness in his face shall be hard to miss."
::Niwa smiled, replying: "And how goes the forging of your lord's great blade, Katsuragi?"
::Katsuragi neither wanted to shame his master nor lie to his two friends, and yet he could not think of any way to deflect, and so groused: "I see your ears are as keen as your hands, Sir Niwa. The jokes of us unlearned men are as nothing before you."
::{{Color|help|Miyazaki hid his grin. Upon hearing this, Niwa released the lizard from his hand into Katsuragi's palm. But just as more words were to be exchanged, someone came walking nearby, their footsteps steady and confident. The head that appeared by the door was that of one from abroad. The newcomer placed some lunchboxes to one side, nodded, and made to leave. Katsuragi called out after him. "Sir, what about your meal? Are you not hungry?"}}
::{{Color|help|The man smiled upon hearing Katsuragi's words. "I already ate. I hope that you, my lords, may also find time to sate your hunger soon."}}
::{{Color|help|"You are our guest, sir. To see you help in these trifling matters fills me with embarrassment," Niwa said with sincerity.}}
::{{Color|help|The man smiled, as if it was no matter. Then, with a nod, he departed.}}<br><br><br>
::Extract II<br><br>
::...
::...
::The stranger, a foreign mechanic, stood next to the coast.
::Sunset fell to the accompaniment of darkness. The bands of twilight showed themselves naught, for in their place did thunderclouds roil, grumbling the omens of a coming rainstorm.
::Darkness filled the flesh of the sea and the dusk bade the clouds to kneel upon the land. But the man stood uncowed, merely gazing into the distance, radiating bloodthirst.
::None passed him by, and none knew what he was plotting.
::Time passed, unmeasured and uncounted, till a black cloud suddenly tore free from the sky and began to circle the mechanic, bearing down on him like an omen. He then caressed the dark mist, as if it was a part of his flesh.
::Outbound, a fishing boat drew near, the lights of its bow flickering in and out of sight beneath falling sheets of rain. A mist unspooled across the area, stealing sight from the fisherman. Repeatedly, he exclaimed: "It is but dusk. How are my eyes darkened? Is there anyone that can deliver my boat upon safe tides?"
::{{Color|help|Like a falling spear, the black cloud reached the bottom of the boat, and was joined in its bereftness of direction. Like a charging beast, they plunged into the shoreline. Scant steps away, the mechanic laughed, slowly approaching the grand wreck.}}
::{{Color|help|Naught but half an arm was left of the one who had cried out for help, and with a "plop," it landed at the mechanic's feet, who crouched to better study the object, straining against the urge to take a bite.}}
::{{Color|help|Yet, he did not, for the dark clouds swirling down had already picked the remnants of the ship clean.}}<br><br><br>
::Extract III<br><br>
::...
::...
::Katsuragi rushed to the doorway and shouted: "My lord! Things go ill at the furnace. I have searched for Sir Niwa, but there is no trace of him. And much time has passed since Sir Miyazaki left to seek aid, but he has yet to send us any missive. Look..."
::Mikoshi Nagamasa turned slowly, his face grave as one attending a funeral. He spoke then, his words heavy-laden: "I wish not to say such words, Katsuragi... But Sir Miyazaki may never return."
::Katsuragi peered past Nagamasa's broad, stiff shoulders, beyond the windows. The clouds above boiled in waves of black, as if darkness now was the only weather, and might even morph into an abyssal beast and devour Tatarasuna whole.
::Over ten people had already perished. That was why... Why...
::Katsuragi recoiled as if struck. Yes! It was coming back to him now, in dribs and drabs... That was why they had to set out to seek aid!
::Miyazaki had been the first to set sail. The clouds had only just begun to form then. Traveling from Tatarasuna to Inazuma to ask for support was normally no great feat, and yet, there had been no sign of his return.
::{{Color|help|Then a second ship was sent, followed by a third, and a fourth... Each who left to seek salvation did so under foul skies and bleak fortunes. Reason dictated that they should not have risked anyone else, but the situation in Tatarasuna was severe. They needed to gain aid from Inazuma, even should it cost them more lives.}}<br><br>
::Niwa was gone, and none could find him. Afterward, Nagamasa led a search party into the mountains and the area around the furnace, all to no avail. Folk began to wonder if Niwa might have encountered an accident, but worry soon turned to suspicion, and they wondered if he had fled, unwilling to bear the sin of having caused these incidents.
::The people grew ever more suspicious, and Nagamasa himself strained against his discontent and fury. His face had grown to resemble the rumbling clouds above.
::Suddenly, a figure flashed by. Their presence did not go unnoticed by Nagamasa. He drew his blade and cut, but in a flash, the evil spirit had shifted behind him, laughing darkly: "Are you seeking someone, my lord? Niwa, perhaps?"
::Nagamasa bellowed in fury: "You dare address Sir Niwa directly?" Yet, the figure parted like mist before his falling blade, only to re-materialize beyond reach but not beyond sight &mdash; a ghastly apparition indeed.
::"Was it you who slew my people?" Nagamasa howled and charged, held back only by Katsuragi's desperate grip. As his senses returned to him, he realized he was but an inch away from falling into the furnace.<br><br><br>

:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 paimon 02a.ogg}} {{A|vo llzaq003 2 paimon 02b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, where to start... Paimon hasn't had a moment's rest this whole time. That night, we ended up chatting and chatting until suddenly, the sun was up... And then, {{MC|m=he|f=she}} decided {{MC|m=he|f=she}} wanted to go to Inazuma.
:{{DIcon}} I was investigating the situation with The Balladeer.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The Balladeer... Hmm. Sounds like some kind of code name.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (...Oh no...)
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' You look troubled... Is there something you need to tell me?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Even Nahida doesn't remember... Just like last time, any changes to Irminsul affect her as well.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (The Balladeer acted quickly. He finished erasing himself before Nahida could stop him...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (I'm the only one who still remembers the things that were erased. Once again... I am the record-keeper.)
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' {{Traveler}}?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, what's wrong...? You look so upset.
:{{DIcon}} There are things that have happened... that only I can remember.
::{{DIcon}} I have to tell you the truth.
:{{Black Screen|With a heavy heart, you piece back together the story that was broken and scattered across time...}}
:{{Black Screen|There once was one named The Balladeer, created by the Electro Archon. He was a puppet who lived among men.}}
:{{Black Screen|After a series of events in Tatarasuna, The Balladeer, thinking he had been thrice betrayed, left Inazuma to roam the world beyond.}}
:{{Black Screen|With no trust for humans, and only loathing for the gods,<br>he bore his grudge for years as he grew in strength, then returned to Inazuma to take his revenge.<br>He tried in vain to become a deity with a Gnosis, and ended up losing everything.}}
:{{Black Screen|Finally, he entered Irminsul and learned the truth behind his betrayal.<br>Knowing now that his entire life was built on lies, he did the unthinkable in an attempt to reverse his tragic fate...}}
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...That's quite a story.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' So this puppet known as The Balladeer erased himself from Irminsul... hoping that he could change the past.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But how was he even able to do that?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' As {{Traveler}} said, he very nearly became Sumeru's deity. Admittedly, I remember it a little differently... I don't recall finding anyone inside the machine after we defeated it.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Nevertheless, it does make sense. If someone were to successfully erase themselves from Irminsul, the world would change to reflect the new reality.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you believe this person really existed, and we just don't remember him because... well, because he literally changed the world?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes. Theoretically speaking, it is possible to do this, but I'm struggling to imagine the kind of person who would dare go through with it...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 10a.ogg}} {{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 10b.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' {{Traveler}} comes from a world beyond Teyvat. That's why there's no information about {{MC|m=him|f=her}} in Irminsul, and it also explains why any changes to Irminsul wouldn't affect {{MC|m=him|f=her}}.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' So, if there's anyone in the world capable of retaining memories from a past that has been rewritten, it's you. It's... quite incredible, when you think about it.
:{{DIcon}} ...You can say that again.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's having a hard time understanding this Balladeer guy's motivations... Why did he do it?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I can only make inferences based on the information we've been given. As for what kind of person he was... only you remember that.
:{{DIcon}} I... I'm really not sure.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (We were enemies, after all. I don't know his perspective on all this, so I can't say why he did something so extreme...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Did he want to reset everything? Or save someone? Or did he want to completely undo his existence?)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' ("Everything can be set right. It's time to solve this once and for all"... Maybe that's all there is to it.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (I still remember the question he asked. He asked me, specifically... and my hesitation gave him his answer.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (I hesitated because I witnessed [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] erase her own existence, but I can't tell Nahida that.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (To put it another way, I know why The Balladeer was so sure it could work... But I can't tell them that.)
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Something else worrying you? ...Something that you can't share?
:{{DIcon}} I just feel... empty.
:{{DIcon}} He chose such a radical option, and yet...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...It couldn't change the fate of the ones who had died. Right?
:{{DIcon}} Yes.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 15.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Once The Balladeer realized he hadn't been betrayed after all, it must have completely changed his view of the people of Tatarasuna. Now he saw them as friends again.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 16.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' He couldn't keep hating humans after that. And if he thought there was a chance he could save his old friends, it would be hard not to try.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 17.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...The story makes sense, every part of it.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 18.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The Balladeer tried to achieve godhood with The Doctor's help. He was unsuccessful, but retained the power to connect with Irminsul.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 19.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' That power then enabled him to change what was recorded in Irminsul and erase himself, even though he didn't have much strength left.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, it does make sense, but... it still ended in tragedy for his friends.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It just feels so hopeless... He gave everything to do this, but it seems like he got nothing in return.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Yeah. He changed the world in many ways, and yet the dead still didn't get a second chance. Those fated to a tragic end could not be saved.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (What exactly did he want to fight back against? The betrayals in his life? Or did he wish he'd never existed at all?)
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 20.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Please wait a moment. I want to check something.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 21.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 22.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Found it. This should be the one.
:;(Nahida hands out a floating green orb in a translucent cube)
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 23a.ogg}} {{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 23b.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It turns out that... I have a strange way of confirming everything {{MC|m=he|f=she}} has told us.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What is it?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 24.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' A record from my personal collection. It was tucked away in a corner.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 25.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' You should take a look.
:{{Black Screen|Surprisingly, the information is presented to you in a way that resembles a fairy tale...}}
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is this a fairy tale? Who wrote it?
:{{DIcon}} This matches everything I said.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 26.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I authored this record myself.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? You... wrote a fairytale that somehow has something to do with The Balladeer?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 27.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' When combined with {{Traveler}}'s narrative, it's clear that this story is an allegory. Everything in it is a symbol for something else.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hold on, so this record survived from the... past-past?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 28.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes. Any information about The Balladeer or the kabukimono in other records will have been changed. But I wrote this story in a way that means, it was left intact.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 29.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Changing the information in Irminsul changes Teyvat.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 30.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But Irminsul can't change information that was well hidden in advance. I guess I must've written this story as a backup before The Balladeer entered Irminsul.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's incredible! What a great idea!
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 31a.ogg}} {{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 31b.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' And sending {{Traveler}} into Irminsul with The Balladeer must have been a further precaution. I knew {{MC|m=he|f=she}}'d remember everything.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 32.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' This story is abstract enough that it still resonates with the present information recorded in Irminsul.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 33a.ogg}} {{A|vo llzaq003 2 nahida 33b.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But if we connect all the different pieces together, the true story that emerges is the one {{MC|m=he|f=she}} told us... the now-erased life of The Balladeer.

|{{A|vo llzaq003 3 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' There once was a [[Il Dottore|lone monster]] draped in fox fur. The monster found a family of foxes, joined them, and they became friends. The monster lived with the family, day and night, and everyone treated it as one of their own.
|-
|{{A|vo llzaq003 3 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Once in a while, the monster would take off its fox fur at night, and lament to itself as it gazed at its reflection in the water: "I am a monstrosity, yet they are too foolish to see it... I pity them."

|-
|{{A|vo llzaq003 3 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The kitten, too, wished to become a fox, but its tail was too slender and it could not grow a coat of richly colored fur. Yet when the other foxes saw this, they spoke words of comfort to the kitten: "Even without a tail and fur like ours, you are still one of us."

|-
|{{A|vo llzaq003 3 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' A [[Niwa Hisahide|gray fox]] stood up and addressed the monster. It said: "You are the cleverest among us. Surely you can help us find a way to solve this."

:{{A|vo llzaq003 3 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 3 nahida 15.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I remember now. This is not just The Balladeer's story... it is his very own memories. I made a backup so that it would be preserved, no matter what happened.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 3 nahida 16.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' To become a god, he was experimented on and modified countless times. It was brutal torture, and the only reason he was able to survive is that he was a puppet.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 3 nahida 17.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' This memory was extracted from him by the scholars. Presumably, they kept it to have something to defend themselves with...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 3 nahida 18.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Creating a deity was just the first step. Some of them wanted to be able to control it. That's why they backed up his memory for later use.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 3 nahida 19.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I buried it deep inside one of my own dreams, and then hid it inside an allegorical story so that it wouldn't be altered.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's hard to believe that this person really existed, let alone that he tried to... get rid of us on more than one occasion...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon has no memory of him at all. He completely vanished, like a puff of smoke...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 3 nahida 20.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The Balladeer agreed to help me look for information about the Descenders, and although he was unsuccessful, he still helped you.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 3 nahida 21.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Before he vanished, he confirmed an important detail: that [[Khaenri'ah]] was where your twin first came into this world.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 3 nahida 22.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...We still don't know how the change to Irminsul will affect the senior ranks of the Fatui, but in all likelihood, they won't even remember their own Harbinger.

:{{A|vo llzaq003 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It sounds like Paimon wouldn't like this guy a whole lot if he was still around. But still, Paimon doesn't like the way it all ended that much better.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 3 nahida 23.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' This is why wisdom alone cannot answer all our questions. We look, we see, and we comprehend, but the question still troubles us.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 3 nahida 24.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' So the answer is not everything. People yearn to find the truth and then conquer the troubles they face.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 3 nahida 25.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' When you give someone the truth, you give them a chance to choose their own destiny.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 3 nahida 26.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' To others looking on, this may seem like a pointless endeavor. But for him, the chance to act on his desire to disappear must have meant a lot.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 3 nahida 27.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Never forget that even when we walk beneath dark clouds along a road filled with suffering, the light of wisdom is always there, guiding us toward a better destination.

:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 wanderer 13.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' You've been following me all the way from the city. I'd have to be blind not to notice.
:{{DIcon}} ...You're right, we were following you.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 wanderer 14.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Uh, have we met before?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 wanderer 15.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' No, we haven't met... But you know me?
:{{DIcon}} Yes.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 wanderer 16.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' ...I have no recollection...
:{{DIcon}} It's complicated, but I do know you.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, are you absolutely sure?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 wanderer 17.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Sorry, but I can't just take your word for it.
:{{DIcon}} I can prove it.
::{{DIcon}} ...You're a puppet.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A puppet? What makes you think that?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 wanderer 18.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' ...!
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? You were right! The look on his face...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 wanderer 19.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' I guess you do know me after all. That is not something I share with a lot of people...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 wanderer 20.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' ...Look, I'm just a wanderer. But seeing as you've gone to all this trouble to track me down, I'm sure whatever it is must be important.
:{{DIcon}} There's somewhere I want to take you.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 wanderer 21.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Okay, but please let me deliver these goods to my boss first.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you really working for that guy? He said that you don't want any Mora for it. Is that true?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 wanderer 22.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Yes. I ran into him out in the wilderness during a storm, and he let me take shelter in his cart. In return, I said I'd be his helper for a while.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's oddly nice of you...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 wanderer 23.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Let me take these back, then I'll come with you. Okay?
:{{DIcon}} ...Alright.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then, let's return to the city.

;(Approach Merchant)
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 wanderer 24.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Here you go, Boss. I'll leave them right here.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 merchant 10.ogg}} '''Merchant:''' Oh, you really went pick some more... Hmm? Who are these two?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 wanderer 25.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Something's come up, and they need to borrow me. Sorry, Boss, I'm afraid I'll be away from the stall for a while.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 merchant 11.ogg}} '''Merchant:''' ... *sigh*
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 merchant 12.ogg}} '''Merchant:''' I was just about to pay you anyway. Go wherever you want, kid. Don't waste your time here.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 wanderer 26.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' What?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 merchant 13.ogg}} '''Merchant:''' I get it, okay? You just wanted to help me out to thank me for giving you shelter from the rain that day. Even then, I don't understand why you're so adamant that you don't want any pay for it...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 merchant 14.ogg}} '''Merchant:''' But look, it was pouring down, and there you were, sauntering along without a care in the world. Like you had nowhere to be, and didn't even care that it was raining...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 merchant 15.ogg}} '''Merchant:''' Imagine you were me for a second. It's a little weird, right? Why's this guy traveling during a rainstorm if he's not trying to get somewhere? And why's he taking a shortcut through the open country if he's not even in a hurry?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 wanderer 27.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Uh...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 merchant 16.ogg}} '''Merchant:''' But anyway, taking you in didn't put me out even slightly. You don't owe me a thing for it, certainly not all this... Your time is valuable, y'know? You should go live your life.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 wanderer 28.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' ...But, I don't...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 wanderer 29.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' ...No. You're right.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 wanderer 30.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Then I suppose this is where we say goodbye. Thank you again for taking me into the city.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 merchant 17.ogg}} '''Merchant:''' Don't mention it, kiddo. I've run into all kinds of characters over the years... I just hope you find your path.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 wanderer 31.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' ...Thank you.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 4 wanderer 32.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Alright, done. Thanks for waiting for me. We can go now.

;(Talk to the Merchant again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog llzaq003 merchant 02.ogg}} '''Merchant:''' Don't worry about me.

;(Approach Nahida)
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nahida! Nahida!
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' What's wrong?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Huh? Are you...?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 wanderer 01.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' ...Hello, I do apologize for the sudden intrusion...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We found this guy in the street, but he doesn't seem to remember anything... So yeah, quite an eventful walk!
:{{Black Screen|You tell Lesser Lord Kusanali what happened in the Grand Bazaar...}}
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' You say that you are trekking across Teyvat to train yourself... Many other Inazumans who describe themselves in this way call themselves "shugenja." Why do you refer to yourself as a "wanderer"?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 wanderer 02.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Well, it seems more relevant in my case... To me, it sounds like a plant with no roots.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 wanderer 03.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' But these two claim that they know me, and that I have a hidden past unknown even to myself.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I wouldn't call it the "past," but rather... Uh, this is a difficult one to explain.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I don't like to rely on using terms like this often, but in your case it seems that it ought to be called a "previous incarnation."
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, like a past life or something?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes. Something far more distant than the past. So far away that you cannot perceive it.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 wanderer 04.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Okay, I have to ask... what was I like in my previous incarnation?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ummm...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 wanderer 05.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' ...Oh, okay, I see.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 wanderer 06.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' You want to tell me, but you can't bring yourselves to say it. Looks like I didn't have the most wonderful existence in my previous incarnation.
:{{DIcon}} We're just trying to think where to start...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 wanderer 07.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' If it's that difficult to talk about, I have no doubt it will be just as difficult to hear.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 wanderer 08.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' But I'll be able to handle it. Please, tell me the truth.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Is truth something you care a lot about?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 wanderer 09.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' ...Yes.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Then I'll be straight with you. In your previous incarnation, you did many things that would be considered evil.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' You nearly died because of what other people did... and many died because of you. As a non-human being, you hated gods and humans alike.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' You drifted from place to place, never able to settle, even where you found status and identity. You adamantly believed that you were missing a heart.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 wanderer 10.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' ...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...Actions rooted in persistence sometimes bear bitter fruit. Sometimes, you have to let parts of yourself go, or you'll never be happy.
:{{Black Screen|Nahida tells the Wanderer about his past...}}
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 wanderer 11.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' I gave everything I had, but it barely changed history at all.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' In terms of the outcome alone... that's true.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 wanderer 12.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' ...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 wanderer 13.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' ...I don't think I can judge everything I've heard purely in terms of right and wrong.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 wanderer 14.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Each choice a person makes belongs to a specific place and time, a chain of cause and effect... a cycle of karma and consequence.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' That is the nature of truth. If one thing is right, its opposite must be wrong, and yet dichotomies like this are not enough to explain the world in all of its complexity.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 wanderer 15.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Seems like my previous incarnation wasn't the most likable individual.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Haha... we're not trying to hurt your feelings, or anything... But yeah, we weren't your biggest fans.
:{{DIcon}} We were each other's enemies.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 wanderer 16.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' If we were enemies, why are you trying to help me find the truth?
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aah, this is so frustrating! This guy's supposed to be our arch-enemy, but now he's just some random stranger we met on the street!
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He's got so much to answer for, but we can't make him talk because he doesn't remember anything... Ugh, what a weird situation...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 wanderer 17.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Lesser Lord Kusanali. As the God of Wisdom, I trust that everything you told me must be true?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 nahida 15.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes, it's all true. I can even show you the memories themselves, if you're willing.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 wanderer 18.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Please. I want to see them for myself. I want to experience my own transgressions.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 nahida 16.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Even though it will cause your present self great mental anguish?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 wanderer 19.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' I'm just a puppet, with no heart and no name. There is nothing in this world for me to cling to, to fill the void within me... except maybe these sins that can never be undone.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 nahida 17.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...Very well. As you wish.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, shouldn't we go with him!? This one's kind of on us for bringing him here...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 wanderer 20.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Don't worry. Whatever danger I might face, it's my burden to bear.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 nahida 18.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' {{Traveler}}, could I ask you to supervise him on my behalf?
:{{DIcon}} ...Okay.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, good point, given your, um... unique situation, w&mdash;we'd better keep an eye on you!
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 wanderer 21.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Understood.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 6 nahida 19.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Thank you. Now, prepare yourselves, everyone.

;(Talk to Nahida again)
:{{A|vo dialog llzaq003 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's time to get ready.

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Wanderer, optional)
:{{A|vo llzaq003 5 wanderer 01.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' (...Time to face the music.)

;(Talk to Wanderer)
:{{A|vo dialog llzaq003 wanderer 01.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' No matter what lies ahead, I'll face it. Whatever it takes. I'm just sorry that you have to join me for the whole thing.

;(Enter the Domain)
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This looks like Inazuma...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Right now, you're in a dream I created using information extracted from your memories.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' These memories will show you the raw truth, but be aware that enemies may react just like in the real world. Please be careful.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds like an immersive experience. It's a good thing we came along...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 wanderer 01.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' ...You don't need to do this for me. I don't deserve your protection.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We never give up halfway. Well, we had to once... But that was your doing.
:{{DIcon}} And now we're just finishing the job.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 wanderer 02.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Alright, thanks.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Wanderer, this is the Shakkei Pavilion. In your Balladeer incarnation, this is where the Electro Archon placed you after your creation. You had a great many memories here.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is that because this is kind of like his birthplace?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' You could say that, in a sense... You'll see why shortly.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 wanderer 03.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' ...I hear footsteps.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 katsuragi 01.ogg}} '''[[Katsuragi]]:''' This place is huge... I can't believe the landslide didn't fill it in. I wonder who built it? The Crystal Marrow miners?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 katsuragi 02.ogg}} '''Katsuragi:''' ...No, there's no way. Look at this exquisite construction work, and so well-preserved, too... No mining crew would be capable of this.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 katsuragi 03.ogg}} '''Katsuragi:''' ...Hmm? There's someone passed out on the ground...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 scaramouche 01.ogg}} '''???:''' ...Who are you?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 katsuragi 04.ogg}} '''Katsuragi:''' Y&mdash;You're awake!? What happened? How'd you get stuck here? Are you injured?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 katsuragi 05.ogg}} '''Katsuragi:''' Huh, not a scratch... and these fine clothes... Who are you...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' This man is Katsuragi, deputy to Torachiyo's adopted son, Mikoshi Nagamasa. He found The Balladeer in Shakkei Pavilion and took him back to Tatarasuna.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...And the rest is history... Well, it used to be...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' In the original version of events, Katsuragi was ultimately killed by Nagamasa.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 katsuragi 06.ogg}} '''Katsuragi:''' Let me get you out of here. Our people are nearby. Hang in there!
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' During the Tatarasuna incident, Niwa was murdered by The Doctor, disguised as a mechanic. The Balladeer, then known as the kabukimono, disappeared not long after.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' As the second-in-command at Tatarasuna, responsibility for what had happened fell to Mikoshi Nagamasa.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But Katsuragi had sworn lifelong loyalty to Nagamasa after the latter had once saved his life. At Katsuragi's insistence, Nagamasa killed him to put an end to the Tatarasuna incident.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 8 wanderer 04.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' ...

:{{A|vo llzaq003 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Katsuragi seems like he was a good guy.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 9 wanderer 01.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' He looks like a warrior, but he has a kind face.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 9 wanderer 02.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' ...Why couldn't he live a long and happy life?

;(Enter the second room)
:{{A|vo llzaq003 9 katsuragi 01.ogg}} '''Katsuragi:''' Nagamasa, I found this young guy in a cave sealed off by a landslide. He doesn't remember his name.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 9 mikoshinagamasa 01.ogg}} '''Mikoshi Nagamasa:''' ...Well, we need to call you something. I hear the workers are calling you "the kabukimono"?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 9 scaramouche 01.ogg}} '''[[Scaramouche|Kabukimono]]:''' That's fine with me.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 9 mikoshinagamasa 02.ogg}} '''Mikoshi Nagamasa:''' Katsuragi, report to Niwa. Tell him we have someone new joining us.

;(Approach the green teleporter)
:{{A|vo llzaq003 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What are we doing back here?
:{{DIcon}} I hear voices!
:{{A|vo llzaq003 10 boy 01.ogg}} '''Child:''' Whoa... This is where you were born? It's pretty! But there's nobody here... *cough*
:{{A|vo llzaq003 10 scaramouche 01.ogg}} '''Kabukimono:''' I was abandoned, like you. I lived here for a while at first, but... There's nothing for us here. We can't stay...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 10 boy 02.ogg}} '''Child:''' ...Okay.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 10 boy 03.ogg}} '''Child:''' I heard my mom and dad used to make swords, but the factory manager died, and then my dad got sick... *cough*
:{{A|vo llzaq003 10 boy 04.ogg}} '''Child:''' He kept coughing all the time, just like me. Then, Mom started coughing too...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 10 scaramouche 02.ogg}} '''Kabukimono:''' But you can't. You promised me.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 10 boy 05.ogg}} '''Child:''' Yep, we're family now. We're gonna be together for ever and ever!
:{{A|vo llzaq003 10 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' This child didn't have a name. Or rather... The Balladeer didn't know what to call him. His father died before he could name him.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 10 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' After his mother died, the child stayed in their straw hut alone. Some of the neighbors helped to raise him.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 10 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' After leaving Tatarasuna, The Balladeer ran into this child who didn't have a name, just like him. They made a promise to live together.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What happened to the child then?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 10 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' He died from his illness while he was still very young. The Balladeer came home one day and found that he had stopped breathing.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 10 scaramouche 03.ogg}} '''Kabukimono:''' ...Hey! Wh&mdash;What's wrong...? Say something!!!
:{{A|vo llzaq003 10 scaramouche 04.ogg}} '''Kabukimono:''' ...You promised me we could be family! You're no different from Niwa and all the others... You betrayed me too. Haha...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 10 wanderer 01.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' ...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 10 wanderer 02.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' The voices have gone. It looks like the memory ends here.

:{{A|vo llzaq003 12 pierro 02.ogg}} '''The Jester:''' What you are, truly, is a weapon, one that could be wielded with an iron will... or, you could continue to drift aimlessly.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 12 scaramouche 02.ogg}} '''Kabukimono:''' ...Are you trying to win me over?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 12 pierro 03.ogg}} '''The Jester:''' The long-fated rebellion has begun. Why not take your place at the banquet and join those who shall feast?

:{{A|vo llzaq003 12 scaramouche 03.ogg}} '''The Balladeer:''' Well, well, my fair lady, is this run-down factory and these incompetent fools all for me? Wow, you shouldn't have.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 12 signora 01.ogg}} '''[[Signora]]:''' Hah. What do you have to gain from belittling your subordinates? You might not want to admit it, but you are a part of this plan.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 12 signora 02.ogg}} '''Signora:''' Perhaps you find fighting in the Abyss to be a more meaningful use of your time? Oh, but of course, even this pales in comparison to being experimented on by The Doctor.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 12 scaramouche 04.ogg}} '''The Balladeer:''' ...Heh, what a sharp tongue you have.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 12 scaramouche 05.ogg}} '''The Balladeer:''' Funny how negotiating never seems to be your strong suit. For the task ahead, I suggest you keep your true feelings to yourself.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 12 signora 03.ogg}} '''Signora:''' Hmph, save your breath. I know what I have to do.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 12 scaramouche 06.ogg}} '''The Balladeer:''' I'm sure you think so, but I still think you need to hear it: Don't start thinking you're invincible. And don't let your emotions get in the way.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 12 signora 04.ogg}} '''Signora:''' Surely you're not worried about me?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 12 scaramouche 07.ogg}} '''The Balladeer:''' I just can't have you getting in my way. You and Childe never fail to find ways to complicate things.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 12 signora 05.ogg}} '''Signora:''' I'm merely lighting a little fire in this chaotic nation, but you... Being tossed out like trash must make you want to destroy it completely.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 12 signora 06.ogg}} '''Signora:''' Do you remember the last time you were here? That was a lot of swordsmiths you killed. I'm sure the descendants of the Raiden Gokaden are still suffering the consequences now.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 12 signora 07.ogg}} '''Signora:''' Look at you... Aw, don't get so sentimental. Now, give that poor little tongue of yours a rest, and stop pretending like you're above everyone else.

:{{A|vo llzaq003 12 scaramouche 08.ogg}} '''The Balladeer:''' ..."Poor little tongue"? Hahaha... She's playing with fire talking to me like that. Who does she think she is?

:{{A|vo llzaq003 12 wanderer 03.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' ...Yes, please don't worry about me.

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo llzaq003 13 signora 01.ogg}} '''Signora:''' Why are you staring at me in silence? Can't you think of a nicer way to express yourself?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 13 scaramouche 01.ogg}} '''The Balladeer:''' I'm under no obligation to be nice to you. Besides, I thought nothing mattered to you except results and your own interests. Isn't that right... witch?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 13 signora 02.ogg}} '''Signora:''' Hehe... Muddle-headed puppet, you're only No. 6 because you can take more abuse than other humans. Do you really count that as an asset?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 13 scaramouche 02.ogg}} '''The Balladeer:''' You're about as much fun to be around as a raging inferno. But before we murder each other, it'd be best if we finish our duties.

;(Approach the green teleporter)
:{{A|vo llzaq003 17 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like we've arrived in Sumeru!
:{{A|vo llzaq003 17 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Is that...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 17 scholar 01.ogg}} '''Akademiya Researcher:''' Considering that Amurta's sage, Naphis, refused to join this project, I'll take part in the experiment in his place.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 17 dottore 01.ogg}} '''[[Il Dottore|The Doctor]]:''' Welcome. I look forward to a fruitful collaboration.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 17 scaramouche 01.ogg}} '''The Balladeer:''' ...Hmph.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 17 scaramouche 02.ogg}} '''The Balladeer:''' When do we start?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 17 dottore 02.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' You seem impatient? You should know that becoming a god is far from a trivial affair.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 17 azar 01.ogg}} '''Azar:''' The biological transformation is a lengthy process. As such, I too would recommend that we commence as soon as possible. In the event that a successful connection is established, his body will become permanently bound to the machine, and he will be unable to move independently of it.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 17 scaramouche 03.ogg}} '''The Balladeer:''' Nothing worse than what I've been through before then, Doctor?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 17 dottore 03.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' You were the most resilient test subject I ever came across. Thanks to you, I was able to garner a great deal of information.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 17 dottore 04.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' Alas, after that, you were under orders to remain in the Abyss. We barely saw each other, and it became difficult to further refine the knowledge I had gained.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 17 scaramouche 04.ogg}} '''The Balladeer:''' That was gracefully worded. Ever wonder what they'd think if they knew that nothing matters to you apart from your crazy experiments?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 17 dottore 05.ogg}} '''The Doctor:''' I suggest you speak to me in a more respectful tone, Scaramouche. The mere fact of your utility does not make you indestructible.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 17 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...The Doctor again... That was uncomfortable to watch.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 17 wanderer 01.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' That person gives off a very sinister energy.
:{{DIcon}} He's The Doctor. He's behind all of this.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 17 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's normal for him to give you the creeps! He scares the bejeebers out of Paimon...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 17 wanderer 02.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' ...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 17 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Let's move on.

;(Approach the green teleporter)
:{{A|vo llzaq003 19 wanderer 01.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' You're a god... Do you think I'm evil?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 19 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' If you accept that he is you, just as you are you, then yes &mdash; you are evil.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 19 wanderer 02.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' In your eyes, are there any differences between humans and puppets?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 19 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Do you think there are any differences between your present self and your previous and future incarnations? If not, then what are the differences between humans and puppets?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 19 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Whoever has tasted the joys and sorrows of life in the human realm is human. Whoever has loved and lost, cried with grief, howled with rage at the tragedy of death that eclipses the miracle of life... they are human, too.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 19 wanderer 03.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' ...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 19 wanderer 04.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' I've seen enough of my past. If possible, I'd like to reclaim the sins that are mine to bear.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 19 wanderer 05.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' No matter the consequences, I won't run from blame or punishment. Whatever I am due, let it come to pass.
:{{DIcon}} Are you saying...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 19 wanderer 06.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Can you return my memories to me?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 19 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? But won't that mean you'll lose your current identity?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 19 wanderer 07.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' I've always believed that human lives follow a set of rules, with each person being a collection of past experiences.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 19 wanderer 08.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' As a puppet living in the human world, my life is subject to the same rules.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 19 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Regaining your memories means reverting completely to your previous incarnation. All the emotions that you discarded will return to you.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 19 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Are you sure you want to do this?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 19 wanderer 09.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' I've lived with a void in my chest my whole life. My creator didn't need me, and ever since I awoke, I've just drifted from one place to the next.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 19 wanderer 10.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' But then I met you, and I finally realized that reclaiming my missing sins might be my one opportunity to become my true self.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (...Is this the true meaning of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's words? A person can't erase themselves, and even though the original Balladeer has gone, this person will live on in his place...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Are a person's sins an inescapable part of their destiny too?)
:{{A|vo llzaq003 19 wanderer 11.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' I've always felt I have an innate tendency to yearn for something more, in a way that goes deeper than for most people... But for all my soul-searching as a shugenja, I've never fully understood it. Looking at it now, it seems that I brought this curse upon myself.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 19 wanderer 12.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' So I beg you... grant me this opportunity to gain a purpose. To change my destiny and end my wandering.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 19 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Very well.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 19 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Since your mind is made up, I will return to you that which is yours.
;(A cinematic plays)
{{Cutscene Description|The turbulent memories return to the Wanderer's heart. His time as The Balladeer flows into his mind, and the shock of it causes him immense agony. As you and Paimon worry over this turn of events, Shouki no Kami, the false god that once posed a massive threat to Sumeru, re-emerges from the depths of his memories and attacks you. Assaulted by his memories, the Wanderer has been rendered immobile, and so you go forth to do battle with the giant machine. Yet Shouki no Kami attacks far too swiftly, and just as you are about to be flattened by one of its mighty, undodgeable blows, someone comes to your defense, deflecting the attack.<br>It is your companion &mdash; now having accepted his memories of his "previous life" as The Balladeer into himself. And the thing that has helped him block that strike... is a Vision.}}
::'''Nahida:''' You have made your decision
::'''Nahida:''' Now... take this
:;(The Wanderer reaches out to the memory and it plunges into his chest)
::'''Wanderer:''' Aah...!
:;(The Wanderer sees a memory of Raiden Shogun at the [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Subarea)|Grand Narukami Shrine]])
::'''Yae Miko:''' Set him free?
:;(The Wanderer sees a memory of a man at the Shakkei Pavilion)
::'''Katsuragi:''' A puppet? What's he doing here...
:;(The Wanderer continues to be in agony)
::'''Wanderer:''' Argh! It's...
:;(The Wanderer sees a memory of Niwa at the [[Tatarasuna]] forge)
::'''Niwa:''' You're a human as far as I'm concerned
:;(The Wanderer sees a memory of Escher)
::'''Escher:''' Everyone's here. Wonderful
:;(The Wanderer sees a memory of a man holding the [[Katsuragikiri Nagamasa]])
::'''Miyazaki:''' What a fine blade!
::'''Miyazaki:''' Nagamasa will be thrilled
:;(The Wanderer drops to his knees in agony)
::'''Wanderer:''' This is... my...
::'''Paimon:''' Is he alright...?
:;(The [[Shouki no Kami]] awakens and begins to attack as The Wanderer is still in shock)
::'''Paimon:''' No way!
:;(The Traveler destroys a rock that was on course to hit the Wanderer)
::'''Paimon:''' Hey! Are you done yet!?
:;(The Shouki no Kami shoots a [[Joururi Workshop#Abilities and Attacks|Electrostreak]] beam towards the three)
:;(The Wanderer, in his mind, reaches towards the light)
::'''Wanderer:''' All worthless dross will be purged
::'''Wanderer:''' That's why...
::'''Wanderer:''' ...This won't be the end!
:;(The Wanderer reaches out and grabs onto The Balladeer's hand, only to notice that the Balladeer has reached out for his other hand)
:;(The Wanderer comes to his senses as the beam reaches them)
:;(In the aftermath of the attack, it seems that something had deflected the beam)
:;(The Traveler and Paimon see the Wanderer standing in front of them, as an [[Anemo]] [[Vision]] descends in front of him)
::'''Paimon:''' Balladeer!?
:;(He snatches the Vision from the air and a familiar grin appears on his face)
::'''Wanderer:''' Die!
:;(Cinematic ends)

;(When the battle begins)
:{{A|vo llzaq003 20 wanderer 01.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' ...This is trying my patience.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 20 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Have you got all your memories back now?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 20 wanderer 02.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Have you got any more stupid questions!?

;(If the trial Wanderer falls during the battle)
:{{A|vo llzaq003 20 wanderer 03.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Ugh, how... how can I fall here!?

;(After defeating the Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom)
:'''Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom:''' ...!!
:{{A|vo llzaq003 21 wanderer 01.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Imbecile! Get out of my sight!
:{{A|vo llzaq003 21 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...It disappeared... Did we win?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 21 wanderer 02.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' What did you expect? I'd never lose to that.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 21 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ehh, there's that tone of voice again. You're definitely back to your old self...
:{{A|vo llzaq003 21 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, but it was you inside that thing, too. What have you got to be smug about?
:{{A|vo llzaq003 21 scaramouche 01.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Sorry, I'm harsh on myself and everyone else. Just the way I am.
:{{DIcon}} Now you've recovered your memories...
:{{DIcon}} The past will catch up with you.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 21 wanderer 03.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Haha, you sound like you're concerned about me.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 21 wanderer 04.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' But don't worry. Thanks to you, even if I didn't change a thing... at least I now know the truth.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 21 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The memory recovery seems to have been a success. This dream has served its purpose.
:{{A|vo llzaq003 21 wanderer 05.ogg}} '''Wanderer:''' Come on. Let's continue this outside.
