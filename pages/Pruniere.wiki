{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Pruniere:''' Hello there. Is there anything wrong with the waterway?
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Pruniere/Awaiting Feedback|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Pruniere:''' Ah, sweet victory. With lady luck on my side today, I suppose there's no need to worry about aquabus safety!
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Pruniere:''' Misfortune dogs me today, it seems. I should see if the aquabus is running well...
:{{DIcon}} Not yet, as far as I know...
::'''Pruniere:''' "Yet," you say... Ominous, but I suppose no news is good news.
::'''Pruniere:''' You know what we maintenance staff fear the most? Cracks that we can't see!
::'''Pruniere:''' It is like sand concealed amidst flour &mdash; one little error can ruin a whole loaf of bread.
::'''Pruniere:''' Ah, yes, there's another problem, which is people who take tools willy-nilly.
::'''Pruniere:''' There was once, when I simply left my crowbar at my side for a moment, and [[Monsieur Volonte Nouvelle|some passer-by]] just... took it!
::'''Pruniere:''' Fortunately, he returned it after giving someone a bit of a thwacking or something, or I wouldn't have been able to work that day.
::{{DIcon}} So, the important thing here is work?
::'''Pruniere:''' For me it is, yes.
::'''Pruniere:''' I remember that the person who got tripped up was a thief, right? Serves him right.
::'''Pruniere:''' There was [[Houallet|a journalist]] who came over for an interview, but I chased him away. I mean, what do I know about public security? It's not something for me to consider.
::'''Pruniere:''' And wouldn't you know it, isn't there a [[Rhemia|Melusine in plain clothes]] looking this way?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Pruniere:''' Sure, see you.
