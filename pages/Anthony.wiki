==Profile==
<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->
Anthony is trying to help his sister [[Anna]] with her rare disease. So he has a job and at night, he also collects coins that were thrown into the fountain in order to pay for medicine that can heal her disease. Anthony knows what he is doing in the fountain is wrong, but he believes that the Archons will forgive his actions.
He requested a prescription from a [[Baizhu|master physician]] in [[Liyue Harbor]] that can heal Anna. He needs to find a [[Dendro-Processed Berry]] that the doctor requested to make the medicine. However he doesn't want to do it himself because he believes that he would be unsuccessful. When he tried to get herbs for Anna's medication in the past, he was chased by a group of Dendro Slimes. So he asks the [[Traveler]] to find Dendro-Processed Berry. If the Traveler were unsuccessful, he would try to defeat a [[Dendro Slime]] for Anna's sake.

===Appearance===
Anthony has short black hair and blue eyes. He is seen wearing a green shirt and brown pants.

===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Before curing Anna's illness)
:'''Anthony:''' Not bad for today...
:'''Anthony:''' What are you doing!? You frightened me!
:{{DIcon}} What are YOU doing?
::'''Anthony:''' I... I'm not doing anything.
::'''Anthony:''' Oh, well. You've caught me already, haven't you...
::'''Anthony:''' It's just an ordinary water fountain, but somehow people treat it like a wishing well...
::'''Anthony:''' Throwing their money away for nothing... But I could use that money!
::'''Anthony:''' I am in desperate need of money... Please don't tell anyone.
::{{DIcon}} Why do you need the money?
::'''Anthony:''' Because of Anna, my sister. You may have met her during the day.
::'''Anthony:''' She's suffering from a rare disease, so she often comes here to make wishes.
::'''Anthony:''' Why does it have to be her... She's such a kind and gentle kid... Why must it be her and not me...
::'''Anthony:''' These coins somewhat make up for the medicine she needs, but I also work hard at my job, of course...
::'''Anthony:''' If the archons are watching... I'm sure they will forgive my actions...
:{{DIcon}} Oh, sorry. Excuse me.
::'''Anthony:''' Stop fooling around and scaring people. It's not good for the heart...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After curing Anna's illness)
:'''Anthony:''' Thanks to that master physician, Anna's finally turned the corner...
:{{DIcon}} Is Anna doing well?
::'''Anthony:''' Thanks to that doctor, Anna's been getting better.
::'''Anthony:''' She hasn't made a full recovery yet, but that doctor also gave me a recuperative prescription for her.
::'''Anthony:''' As long as she keeps taking her medicine, she will eventually get well.
::{{DIcon}} So, what are your plans going forward?
::'''Anthony:''' Me? Well, since Anna's illness has been taking a turn for the better, I can probably take some more relaxed work as compared to before.
::'''Anthony:''' I was really busy then, and didn't have time to spend with Anna at all. I have to change that.
::'''Anthony:''' Unless you mean my picking Mora at midnight &mdash; in which case, well, every little was a gain. But I won't do that anymore. I only did it then on account of my younger sister's illness, anyway.
:{{DIcon}} It's been tough on you.
::'''Anthony:''' Hahaha, this is nothing. I would do anything for Anna.
::'''Anthony:''' To be honest, I have to thank you again. If not for you, I wouldn't have been able to gather those strange ingredients for that prescription.
::'''Anthony:''' Once Anna fully recovers, I should invite you over to taste some of her cooking...
:{{DIcon}} I'll look forward to it.
::'''Anthony:''' See you!
{{Dialogue End}}

===After Anna becomes an adventurer===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Anna:''' Another escort mission? I've lost count of how many of these I've done...
:'''Anna:''' Isn't there some commission that will really let me show off what I can do?
:'''Anthony:''' Everything in good time, Anna. Don't be so hasty.
:{{DIcon}} How've you been lately?
::'''Anna:''' Ah, Traveler! It's you!
::'''Anna:''' I've been taking my progress as an adventurer quite... slowly.
::'''Anna:''' I've completed some escort missions, more escort missions... Have I mentioned the other escort missions?
::'''Anthony:''' And she's very good at them, too.
::'''Anthony:''' As I see it, she's already an expert at these commissions.
::'''Anna:''' Brother! I've done this escort so many times already! I'm looking for something more exciting!
::'''Anthony:''' Come on, Anna. Everything in good time.
::'''Anna:''' Ugh...
:{{DIcon}} How have you been feeling Anna?
::'''Anna:''' Me? I'm feeling great! In fact, I feel almost indefatigable!
::'''Anthony:''' Something that's shown through in your appetite.
::'''Anna:''' Brother! I... I'm only eating a bit more than I used to, come on!
::'''Anna:''' Don't you pin this on me by the way. This is your fault for making the food so delicious!
::'''Anthony:''' And what would you like to have for dinner tonight?
::'''Anna:''' Sweet Madame, Pancakes... and Chicken-Mushroom Skewer! And, and... Let me think...
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Anna:''' Alright, see you.
::'''Anthony:''' See you. Um, and also...
::'''Anthony:''' Thank you, Traveler.
