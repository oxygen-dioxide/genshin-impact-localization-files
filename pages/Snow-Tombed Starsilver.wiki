==Description==
When the verdant city was sealed by cloud and mist,<br />
When the unending snowstorms blotted out the clear moonlight,<br />
When all life and every interrupted story,<br />
Was pierced by that [[Skyfrost Nail|nail]] that fell from the azure skies...

The [[Varuch|priest]]'s [[Princess of Sal Vindagnyr|daughter]] gave the Starsilver greatsword to the [[Imunlaukr|hero from another land]],<br />
In the howling wind and snow, her words could not reach their intended target.

"This fourth fresco is prepared for you. Your likeness will forever remain on this wall."<br />
"For the sake of that fresco, and for everyone, I will wait for you, and pray for your return..."

When the daughter of that snow-entombed city withered together with the grafted yet barren silver branches,<br />
The outlander destined to wield this sword to shatter ice and snow alike was far afield, chasing answers.<br />
Bright as the moonlight though she was, her final words, too, would never reach that wayfarer.

"It's been a while since I last saw the blue sky and green grass. I don't know which hues to use to capture the landscape of thawing ice and snow that my father so longs for."<br />
"I wish I could see you again..."

This was the answer he found&mdash;

The hero ended his fruitless journey at last.<br />
Tainted black blood dripped from the blade of his greatsword,<br />
As he trudged through now-foreign snowy paths.<br />
But when he returned to the great hall of that mountain country,<br />
Naught but ringing deathly echoes welcomed him.

"So even here, there is nothing left for me to protect..."<br />
"You who dwell in the heavens, you must wish for naught but to watch our ashen suffering here below."<br />
"In that case, then let me help you pass the time with a song of iron and blood."<br />
The outlander left the Starsilver originally meant to shatter snow and wind alike between the frescoes.<br />
Then, he descended the mountain to search for a land full of war and strife &mdash; a place he might paint red with blood.

==Trivia==
*This weapon belonged to the people of [[Sal Vindagnyr]] and was entrusted to the outlander [[Imunlaukr]].
*It's likely that Imunlaukr fought with abyssal creatures since he had black blood dripping from his greatsword when he returned.
