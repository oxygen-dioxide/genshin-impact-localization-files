==Description==
When the [[Sal Vindagnyr|verdant city]] was sealed by cloud and mist,<br>
When the unending snowstorms blotted out the clear moonlight,<br>
When all life and every interrupted story,<br>
Was pierced by that [[Skyfrost Nail|nail]] that fell from the azure skies...

The [[Varuch|priest]]'s [[Princess of Sal Vindagnyr|daughter]] gave the Starsilver greatsword to the [[Imunlaukr|hero from another land]],<br>
In the howling wind and snow, her words could not reach their intended target.

"This fourth fresco is prepared for you. Your likeness will forever remain on this wall."<br>
"For the sake of that fresco, and for everyone, I will wait for you, and pray for your return..."

When the daughter of that snow-entombed city withered together with the grafted yet barren silver branches,<br>
The outlander destined to wield this sword to shatter ice and snow alike was far afield, chasing answers.<br>
Bright as the moonlight though she was, her final words, too, would never reach that wayfarer.

"It's been a while since I last saw the blue sky and green grass. I don't know which hues to use to capture the landscape of thawing ice and snow that my father so longs for."<br>
"I wish I could see you again..."

This was the answer he found&mdash;

The hero ended his fruitless journey at last.<br>
[[Abyss|Tainted black blood]] dripped from the blade of his greatsword,<br>
As he trudged through now-foreign snowy paths.<br>
But when he returned to the great hall of that mountain country,<br>
Naught but ringing deathly echoes welcomed him.

"So even here, there is nothing left for me to protect..."<br>
"[[Heavenly Principles|You who dwell in the heavens]], you must wish for naught but to watch our ashen suffering here below."<br>
"In that case, then let me help you pass the time with a song of iron and blood."<br>
The outlander left the Starsilver originally meant to shatter snow and wind alike between the frescoes.<br>
Then, he descended the mountain to search for a land full of war and strife &mdash; a place he might paint red with blood.

==Trivia==
* The princess' final words are also used in their entirety in the description of the [[Princess' Box]], one of the three boxes obtained in the [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] ''[[Dragonspine's Last Trio]]''.
* The description of "tainted black blood" dripping from his greatsword suggests that Imunlaukr fought with [[Abyss]]al creatures. This aligns with the later revelation that the [[Celestial Nail]]s, one of which caused the snowstorms over Sal Vindagnyr, were cast down by the Heavenly Principles to suppress the power of [[forbidden knowledge]] and the Abyss, which had been brought to [[Teyvat]] by the Dragon King [[Nibelung]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|What Shape Does the Self Hold}}</ref>
