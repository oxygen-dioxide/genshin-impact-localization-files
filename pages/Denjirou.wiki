==Profile==
Denjirou is a soldier in the [[Watatsumi Army]]. He is not part of Swordfish II, but was present during the [[In the Name of the Resistance|battle]] against the [[Shogun's Army]] at [[Nazuchi Beach]]. He witnessed the [[Traveler]] fighting during the battle and was awed by their combat skill. After hostilities between the two armies ended, Denjirou was reassigned to patrol Watatsumi Island. He noticed that people were having trouble readjusting to peacetime but was confident that things would improve with time, especially with [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]]'s leadership.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Watatsumi Sightseeing}}</ref> He also attended the Victory Feast held by Watatsumi Island.

After the success of the peace talks between Watatsumi and the Shogunate, Denjirou returned to training and patrol duties. Since then he has had little contact with his wartime friends, but he believes that their bonds of trust will last even despite their separation.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Friend's Path}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Denjirou wears the Watatsumi Army's standard uniform, modeled from the {{Lang|''ashigaru''|ja=足軽}} of feudal Japan.
