*The adventurer whom the description references is [[Herman]]. He can be found in-game in [[Mondstadt]] wandering near the path towards the Cathedral.

When he retired, he forced himself to sell the sword.
*If you speak to the weaponsmith [[Orban]], he mentions that he forged this weapon for Herman. While the sword is famed, he doesn't consider it very special amongst his works, instead he wishes to make a truly legendary weapon.
