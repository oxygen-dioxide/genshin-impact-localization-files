==Trivia==
*The adventurer whom the description references is [[Herman]]. He can be found in-game in [[Mondstadt]] wandering near the path towards the Cathedral. If you speak to him, he will mention that he is worried because he will not have enough [[Mora]] to buy a sword as a birthday gift for his daughter, [[Ellin]], since she wants to join the [[Knights of Favonius]]. When he retired, he forced himself to sell the sword.
*If you speak to the weaponsmith [[Orban]], he mentions that he forged this weapon for Herman. While the sword is famed, he doesn't consider it very special amongst his works, instead he wishes to make a truly legendary weapon.
*[[Kaeya]] is seen wielding this sword in his [https://youtu.be/M2blSYJ6hrE official Character Demo].
