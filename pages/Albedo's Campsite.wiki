'''[[Albedo]]'s Campsite''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a small laboratory outpost in [[Dragonspine]], that can be found along the path from the [[Entombed City - Ancient Palace]] leading to the [[Entombed City - Outskirts]].

The laboratory is situated in a small cave on the side of the mountain. At the entrance are two lit braziers that warm up the player upon approach, along with a cooking pot that can be used to cook food or process ingredients. There are two workstations and four shelves, all stacked with research materials. There is also a [[Crafting Bench]] that players can use for [[Alchemy]]. Finally, various barrels and crates are scattered along the outpost, some of which can be investigated for ingredients.
