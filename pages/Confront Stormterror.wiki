{{Description|Now that the Stormterror crisis has passed, it's clear skies above Mondstadt once again.<br />However, the memory of facing Dvalin in the sky amidst the storms is ever so vivid.<br />Relive your memories and once again partake in the battle. Maybe you'll learn something new.}}
'''Confront Stormterror''' is a [[Trounce Domain]] battle unlocked after completing [[Archon Quest]] [[Prologue]], Act III Quest [[Calm Before the Storm]]. Players can relive the fight they had with [[Dvalin]] in [[A Long Shot]] and receive bountiful rewards.

==Boss Description==
{{Description|One of The [[Four Winds]] of Mondstadt: [[Dvalin]], the Dragon of the East.<br />With the passages of long years and amid boudless darkness, even the purest gem will become dulled by dust, and even the noble dragon might be corrupted and cankered by hatred.<br />But never forget that dust can be wiped away, and the power of doubt and poison can be shattered.<br /><br />"Fly freely in the sky.<br />"Just like you did in those days when we met, when I walked upon this land and sang the songs of the wind,<br />"And you soared on high, looking down on the world from above.<br />"Today, the sky is no longer swept by wind and snow. The green grass grows all over the earth, and it is beautiful.<br />"If you could walk on the earth and listen to the songs of shepherds and the scattered sound of the wind chimes in the distance, if you could have tasted wine as sweet as honey, you could understand.<br />"How wonderful it would have been if you were as I, witnessing your noble, beautiful form as you soared through the blue sky.<br />"Then you would know that this sky and this earth are both things worth fighting for."|[[Archive]]}}

==Rules==
{{Transclude|Domains|trouncerule|section=1}}
*Unlike the other Trounce Domains ([[Beneath the Dragon-Queller]] and [[Enter the Golden House]]), Confront Stormterror does not allow for playing in [[Co-Op Mode]], presumably because of the unique fixed camera angle.

* '''Fly-By:''' Dvalin disappears from view, then swoops through the center of the platform, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}}.

* '''Dragon Breath:''' Dvalin lands on the player's side of the platform and unleashes a powerful breath onto a part of the platform, slowly moving to the left or right, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DoT}}. While this is a very slow attack, prolonged exposure to the breath will ensure certain death for the character.
** Dvalin's talons are exposed during this attack.

* '''Bite:''' Dvalin swipes his head towards the area the player is standing on. It is a quick attack that deals '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}}.
** Dvalin's head and talons are exposed after this attack.

* '''Pulse Bomb:''' Dvalin shoots two pairs of Pulse Bombs towards you, exploding upon impact, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DMG}}.
** The attack is aimed but not homing, so it can be dodged by continuously moving in one direction.
** This attack is always followed by '''Caelestinum Finale Termini''' or '''Omega Bomb''', allowing the player to prepare for the next attack.
** This attack can be blocked by [[Geo Constructs]].

* '''Caelestinum Finale Termini:''' Dvalin unleashes a rain of '''Pulse Bombs''' to attack the platform you are standing on and adjacent platforms. The affected platforms, become cracked platforms, deal continuous {{Color|Anemo DoT}} to the character standing on them. The longer the character stands on the platform, the higher the damage received.
** This attack deals '''3n% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DoT}}. The value of '''n''' starts as '''1''' and will increase by '''1''' for every instance of DMG dealt.
** Dvalin use this attack 3 times, after which all platforms will be affected.
** The camera will be locked onto Dvalin, preventing the player from moving while Dvalin performs this attack.
** By using a shield or Geo construct that can be stood on, the player is able to stand on the cracked platform without taking damage. However, the shield will not be able to absorb the damage forever as the damage increases, and Geo constructs will eventually break.

* '''Omega Bomb:''' Dvalin dives down, and appears to the other end of the arena and begins charging an attack. He then unleashes a gigantic pulse bomb towards the platform. It deals '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}} to characters on the platform.
** Stay above the platform using the wind current to avoid damage, or move to another platform.
** Unlike '''Caelestinum Finale Termini''', the camera will not be locked onto Dvalin while this attack is performed, making it difficult to see if Dvalin is performing this attack.

* '''Energy Lightning:''' Periodically, there will be circular indicators on the ground showing where the energy pulse will strike (actual radius is not accurately defined), dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Anemo DMG}}.
** He swirls around in the air for a period of time and causes a permanent condition on every part of the arena.
** Dvalin uses this attack after 2 minutes of activating '''Caelestinum Finale Termini''' for the second time. This attack persists for the rest of the fight.

==Battle==
There are 5 distinguishable phases, each phase has different combat environment due to '''Caelestinum Finale Termini''' and '''Energy Lightning'''. Time limit is the duration given to break Dvalin's shield before the game automatically transition into the next phase. The phase also increase when Dvalin's shield is broken for a total number of times. Dvalin performs the next transition attack when either the time limit or shield limit is reached.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/j62DdUZXczM Confront Stormterror - Speedrun Strategy & Exploits]</ref> In Phase 3, '''Energy Lightning''' will not be triggered if the player breaks a total of 6 shield within 2 minutes.

==Strategy==
Dvalin does not appear when the fight starts; rather, players must get closer to the center of the arena in order to trigger his appearance. He has two bars; his normal health bar, and a white bar below it which signifies the strength of his hide.

Dvalin prioritizes '''Fly-by''', which can deal massive damage but is easily avoidable with a well-timed dash or simply moving to the far edges of each platform, as it only hits the center.

After this attack, Dvalin will fly back to the center and either perform '''Dragon Breath''' or '''Bite''', the former taking far greater priority. If '''Bite''' is used, then '''Dragon Breath''' will be performed as the next attack. Dvalin leaves himself open for both attacks, so it is important hit him shave off his hide. While any attack can damage his hide, some types of attack deal more than others, such as [[Claymore]]s.

During his '''Dragon Breath''' attack, Dvalin will grasp the platform the player is on with his talons while facing the player's current position. After a few seconds, he will charge a powerful breath attack and slowly sweep his way to the other side. This attack deals massive damage, but because he is open even longer compared to '''Bite''', it is recommended to start from the side opposite of his head.

After the white bar is fully depleted, Dvalin will collapse onto the platform. The player must then climb up and attack the [[Tainted Blood]] clot, which depletes Dvalin's health. The player has about 15–20 seconds to deal as much damage as possible before Dvalin regains his senses. Dvalin will then perform '''Pulse Bomb''', launching two orbs at the player's location.

Each '''Pulse Bomb''' attack will either cause Dvalin to either advance to the next "phase" or reset his attack rotation, depending on the conditions met. When '''Caelestinum Finale Termini''' is performed, it will cause a cutscene, which also stops the player from performing any action for its duration. After the cutscene ends, the platform to the left and right of the one the player is on will become cracked. This deals {{Color|Anemo DoT}} that intensifies the longer they remain on it, so it is important to move to a safe platform as quickly as possible. [[Anemograna]] are present on the edges of each platform to create an updraft for the player to move around. It is important not to fall out-of-bounds, as it will deplete 10% of the team's health and drain them of energy, while putting them back onto the last platform they were on, and causes Dvalin to immediately regain consciousness if he had been knocked out.

After three '''Caelestinum Finale Termini''' attacks, all platforms will be cracked; however, the boss should be defeated well before that happens.

==Known Issues==
* As of Patch 1.2, Dvalin's neck still has a buggy hitbox. It is recommended for now to avoid switching characters or use certain moving Elemental Bursts, such as [[Fischl|Fischl's]] [[Midnight Phantasmagoria]] while standing on Dvalin's neck; both of these can result in somewhat frequent clipping/phasing through the neck from the top. It is unknown if this persists in the newest version.
* When Dvalin is on the platform and you switch characters near his claws, you may be teleported to the middle of the platform. It is unknown why this happens.
