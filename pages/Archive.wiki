The '''Archive''' is an in-game {{w|database}} unlocked after completing the {{Quest|Unexpected Power}} that allows players to view all of the obtainable items in the game. Once an [[item]] has been obtained or an [[enemy]] or [[wildlife]] has been killed for the first time, its entry is unlocked, and its description can be read. There are 7 sections in the Archive. The Archive also contains extended item descriptions for [[#Equipment|Equipment]] and [[#Materials|Materials]].

A total of 2957 entries exist (as of [[Version/5.3|Version 5.3]]).

Not all players can unlock all entries; for example, the [[Tutorial]] entry "Show Cursor" can only be unlocked by playing on PC. Some entries may be added to the Archive prior to their release if they are expected to be released within the same major version number.

==Archive Categories==
<!--keep arbitrary numbers to show current progress of archive. Upon new updates and additions, change numbers and add notes in Change history.-->

====Weapons====
{{Main|Weapon}}
Contains entries for [[Weapon]]s. Some entries may be missable due to them being featured only in limited time banners, or [[Events]].

A weapon's alternate Ascension Appearance will also be registered in the Archive if obtained, but will not count towards entry counts.

====Artifacts====
{{Main|Artifact}}
Contains entries for [[Artifact]]s categorized by set with each set listing all their five artifact types. The entire artifact set must be obtained for the entry to be unlocked.

===[[File:Icon Archive Materials.png|30px]] Materials===
[[File:Archive Menu Materials Teyvat's Resources.png|thumb|right|150px|Materials Section Teyvat's Resources Tab]]
====Teyvat's Resources====
Contains entries for Resources obtainable through mining, foraging, forging, purchasing, or by catching animals.

====Food and Potions====
{{Main|Food}}
Contains entries for [[Food]], Food Ingredients and Potions obtainable through cooking, crafting, purchasing, or through talking with NPCs. Most entries are special dishes only obtainable through cooking with specific characters, which means some entries may be considered by most to be missable due to them being featured only in limited time banners, but note that being in-game on the day of a character's [[birthday]] allows you to receive their special dish via mail even if you do not have the character.

'''Note:''' For food that has Suspicious and Delicious variants, the Archive entry will only be registered upon acquiring the Delicious variant of the food.

'''Note:''' There are some food entries hidden from view until obtained in-game; this will create a discrepancy between total entries in the archive. Examples include food from recipes obtained via the time-limited login event [[Outland Gastronomy]]. The item [[Special Mushroom Pizza]] only shows as an Archive Entry after purchasing it from [[Kiminami Anna]] after completing the {{Quest|Pizza From Another Land}}. Similarly, [[Dango Milk]] can be bought from [[Tomoki]] after completing {{Quest|Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter}}.

====Trophies====
Contains entries for [[Character Talent Material]]s, [[Character Ascension Material]]s, [[Weapon Ascension Material]]s, and [[Character and Weapon Enhancement Material]]s obtainable through crafting, domains, and monsters.

====Utility Items====
Contains entries for [[Gadget]]s.

'''Note:''' It is only currently possible to obtain a maximum of 67 entries. This is because while there have been 6 different [[:Category:Mini Seelie|Mini Seelie]] available through in-game events, with each one adding an archive entry in this category, it has only been possible so far to obtain a maximum of 4 of them on any one account, due to each event only allowing the player to obtain one of their choice.
