The '''Archive''' is an in-game {{w|database}} unlocked at [[Adventure Rank]] 2 that allows players to view all of the obtainable items in the game. Once an item has been obtained or an enemy or wildlife has been killed for the first time, its entry is unlocked, and its description can be read. There are 7 sections in the Archive. The Archive also contains extended item descriptions for [[#Equipment|Equipment]] and [[#Materials|Materials]].

A total of 1498 entries exist.

Not all players can unlock all entries; for example, the Tutorial entry "Show Cursor" can only be unlocked by playing on PC. Some entries may be added to the Archive prior to their release if they are expected to be released within the same major version number.

Contains entries for [[Artifacts]] categorized by set with each set listing all their five artifact types. The entire artifact set must be obtained for the entry to be unlocked.

===[[File:Icon Archive Materials.png|30px]] Materials===
[[File:Archive Menu Materials Teyvat's Resources.png|thumb|right|150px|Materials Section Teyvat's Resources Tab]]
====Teyvat's Resources====
Contains entries for Resources obtainable through mining, foraging, forging, purchasing, or by catching animals.

====Food and Potions====
{{Main|Food}}
Contains entries for [[Food]], Food Ingredients and Potions obtainable through cooking, crafting, purchasing, or through talking with NPCs. Most entries are special dishes only obtainable through cooking with specific characters, which means some entries may be considered by most to be missable due to them being featured only in limited time banners, but note that being in-game on the day of a character's [[birthday]] allows you to receive their special dish via mail even if you do not have the character.

'''Note:''' There are some food entries hidden from view until obtained in-game; this will create a discrepancy between total entries in the archive. Examples include food from recipes obtained via the time-limited login event [[Outland Gastronomy]]. The item [[Special Mushroom Pizza]] only shows as an Archive Entry after purchasing it from [[Kiminami Anna]] after completing the [[Pizza From Another Land]] quest. Similarly, [[Dango Milk]] can be bought from [[Tomoki]] after completing [[Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter]].

====Trophies====
Contains entries for [[Talent Level-Up Materials]], [[Character Ascension Materials]], [[Weapon Ascension Materials]], and [[Common Ascension Materials]] obtainable through crafting, domains, and monsters.

====Utility Items====
Contains entries for [[Gadgets]] obtainable through crafting, forging, or from [[Events]].

'''Note:''' It is only currently possible to obtain a maximum of 33 entries. This is because while there have been 4 different [[:Category:Mini Seelie|Mini Seelie]] available through in-game events, with each one adding an archive entry in this category, it has only been possible so far to obtain a maximum of 2 of them on any one account, due to each event only allowing the player to obtain one of their choice.
