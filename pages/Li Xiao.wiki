{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Before completing Transient Dreams)
:'''Li Xiao:''' Ah, my homeland...
:'''Li Xiao:''' ...Hmm? What do you need?
:{{DIcon}} Why did you sigh?
::'''Li Xiao:''' Sorry that you had to see that. I just... can't hold my homesickness back anymore.
::'''Li Xiao:''' I came to [[Inazuma]] as a representative of our merchant guild, but I got stranded because of [[Sakoku Decree]].
::'''Li Xiao:''' The merchant guild didn't want to give up on the business foundation that they have built throughout these years, so they forced me to stay here.
::'''Li Xiao:''' ...I thought the lockdown would only last several months before it got lifted. I never expected it to go on for so long.
::'''Li Xiao:''' I don't even know if my lover and my parents are okay back home or not, alas...
::{{DIcon}} About your homeland...
::'''Li Xiao:''' I grew up in [[Liyue Harbor]]. I left my home because I wanted to see the other cities. I joined a caravan and started doing  business everywhere.
::'''Li Xiao:''' It has been almost a decade since I left. Although I did make some progress in my career, I also feel more and more guilty... To everyone else, I must be a really unfilial son.
::'''Li Xiao:''' I wanted to go home after this trip, but that got canned by the lockdown in Inazuma...
::'''Li Xiao:''' Even more surprisingly, my mischievous [[Tiger Li|little sister]] snuck out of doors and boarded the same boat bound for Inazuma.
::'''Li Xiao:''' Ah, if I don't take good care of her, how can I face my parents?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Li Xiao:''' Yeah, see you!

;(After completing Transient Dreams)
:'''Li Xiao:''' Oh, archons be praised! At last, I gaze upon my homeland once more!
:{{DIcon}} Congratulations.
::'''Li Xiao:''' Thank you! I just... couldn't hold my feelings of homesickness back anymore.
::'''Li Xiao:''' Before this, I went to Inazuma as a representative of our merchant guild, but I got stranded there because of the Sakoku Decree.
::'''Li Xiao:''' The merchant guild didn't want to give up on the business foundation that they had built throughout the years, so they forced me to stay there.
::'''Li Xiao:''' ...I thought the lockdown would only last several months before it got lifted. I never expected that it would have gone on till recently.
::'''Li Xiao:''' Laugh if you like, but the moment I saw my parents and lover again, my eyes just started brimming over with tears...
:{{DIcon}} Tell me a bit more about yourself...
::'''Li Xiao:''' I grew up in Liyue Harbor. I left my home because I wanted to see the other cities. I joined a caravan and started doing business everywhere.
::'''Li Xiao:''' It has been almost a decade since I left. Although I did make some progress in my career, I also feel more and more guilty... To everyone else, I must be a really unfilial son.
::'''Li Xiao:''' Now that I've finally returned home after being stuck in Inazuma for all this time, I've had some time to think things over.
::'''Li Xiao:''' I've decided to only do business in Liyue for the time being. I might earn less, but I'll be able to spend more time with my family.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Li Xiao:''' Mmhmm, goodbye.
