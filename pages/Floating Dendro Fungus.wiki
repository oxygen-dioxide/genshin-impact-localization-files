'''Floating Dendro Fungi''' ''(unofficial name)'' are an upcoming [[enemy]]. Depending on the environment and the elements affecting them, they will switch back and forth between different states. Other than changes in attack methods, defeating them in specific states will grant rare special materials.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/6DjVUfy_Lng Sumeru Preview Teaser 01: The Fascinating Dendro Element | Genshin Impact]</ref>
