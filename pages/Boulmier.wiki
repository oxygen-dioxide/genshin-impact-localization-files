==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
Boulmier is part of the Beret Society and [[Dougier]]'s subordinate. Being one of the more "docile" and obedient members, Boulmier was sent to greet Wriothesley and the Traveler to put on a performance and make the Beret Society look good. Boulmier can be found organizing the books at the Beret Society gathering place. Later it is found out that Boulmier was following a script. When the Traveler confronted her later, Boulmier insisted that the Traveler not look through the books.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Proud "Beret Society"}}</ref>
