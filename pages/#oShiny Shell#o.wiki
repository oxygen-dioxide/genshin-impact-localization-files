|description    = A rather unique streetlamp that can be found in [[Merusea Village]]. It has an Ash Wood branch for a pole. Some guests believe that [[Melusine]]s must have referenced seashells when building these lamps, while otherwise believe that crab claws were the source material, while the glowing objects within were akin to captured aquatic creatures. The latter guess sounded quite cruel, and thus did the "Shiny Shell" nickname gain favor in most cases.<br>In truth, the Melusines just wanted to add a waterproof covering atop the phosphorescent fruits that crowned the lamp...
