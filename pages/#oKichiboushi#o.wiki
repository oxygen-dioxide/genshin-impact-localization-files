==Profile==
"Kichiboushi" is a bake-danuki who gave Ioroi company. He was sealed alongside many of his kin by [[Kamuna Harunosuke]]; however, as Harunosuke did not properly seal all of the bake-danuki away, some of them were able to escape their confinement, "Kichiboushi" being one of them. During the events of cleansing the Sacred Sakura, [[Ioroi]] has "Kichiboushi" bring the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] bring them to the corrupted Sakura roots underneath [[Chinju Forest]].

Some time afterwards, Paimon and Traveler decided to visit Ioroi on a whim. Ioroi, remarking on the other lands he saw prior to his petrification and that he had no knowledge of them, decided to have "Kichiboushi" accompany the two outside Inazuma as he was excited to play with them again and wanted to train more. When the Traveler remarked that they wanted to talk with "Kichiboushi" during their travels, Ioroi gave them a bake-danuki feast so they could understand what "Kichiboushi" was saying. The training mostly consisted of taking "Kichiboushi" around various places across [[Mondstadt]] and [[Liyue]].

At the end of the trip, "Kichiboushi" was brought back to Chinju Forest and promised to uphold and remember what the Traveler and Paimon had taught him.

===Appearance===
"Kichiboushi" is a lighter-colored variant of the typical [[Bake-Danuki|bake-danuki]]. Unlike other bake-danuki, he has a reddish-orange leaf upon his head. He has a green patterned cape tied around his neck. His belly is a pale shade of beige, and his hands and feet are black. His inner face and ears are a dark brown, with his inner face having white markings around the sides.
