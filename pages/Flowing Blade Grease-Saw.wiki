==Descriptions==
{{Description|A warrior from the source of the springs, and a tribal guardian that patrols the waters and shores.<br>These warriors always lead the charge, and the swords in their hands are as teeth that saw through bone. The members of the tribe who practice the sword do so in the water, honing their skill and strength against the resistance of the water itself. The best among them can cleave a swimming fish in two.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* While the Chinese name of the enemy {{Zh|锯脂者}} can be literally translated as "one who saws through fat," the name may actually be a reference to the {{Lang|{{w|Serrasalmidae}}|zh=锯脂鲤科|zh_rm=Jùzhīlǐ-kē}}, a family of fishes prominently found in South America.
** Serrasalmidae means "saw-salmon family," named for the serrated keel running along their abdomen.
** The Chinese name for Serrasalmidae, {{zh|锯脂鲤科}} means "saw-characiform family." Here, the character {{zh|脂}} is part of the name for {{w|characiform}}s, where it refers to the {{w|adipose fin}} characteristic of this order of fish.
