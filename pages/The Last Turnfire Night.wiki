'''''The Last Turnfire Night''''' is the third part of {{Quest|Kinich's Deal}}.

==Steps==
# Wait till the next day (18:00 &ndash; 20:00)
# Go to Elder [[Trinidad]]'s home
# Head to the [[Turnfire Night]] venue
# Prepare to begin the ceremony
# Obtain the kindling
# Light the Pillars of the Sacred Flame (x/9)
# Complete the Lighting ceremony
# Go to the cave where the [[Kongamato|Mountain King]] slumbers
# Go deeper inside...
# Cleanse the [[Abyss]]al power all around and light the brazier (X/6)
# Go further in
# Light up the last torches and altar (X/6)
# Implement the final step of the plan
# Defeat the Mountain King
#* {{Enemy|Kongamato|text=Kongamato &mdash; Corrupted Mountain King}}
# Talk to the Mountain King
# Consult Chief [[Wayna]]
# Find [[Kinich]] and talk to him
# Standing before a familiar mural...<!-- doesn't show during playthrough, but shows in the Travel Log as the section with the final Sanka dialogue block -->

==Gameplay Notes==
* During steps 3&ndash;15, the player will enter [[Special Story Mode]]. Upon leaving this mode, the player will reappear in front of Trinidad's home, with Kinich standing nearby. Depending on quest progress, talking to him will resume the quest from either steps 4, 5, 8, 11, or 13.
* While lighting the nine pillars, it is possible to miss lighting a pillar if the player advances too quickly, as it is possible to cancel movement toward a [[Coilgrass Sigil]] by triggering another grapple<!-- with both Kinich and an indwelled Yumkasaurus -->. This will cause the process to be restarted.
* During step 14, a trial [[Kinich]] joins the party.

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Kinich where the previous quest ended before 18{{colon}}00 the next day, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' What happened to getting some rest?
:{{DIcon}} I'm still a little anxious about [[Enjou]].
::{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 02a 1.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' You're cautious, like me. I get it. But don't worry &mdash; like I said, I investigated, and I'm confident he has nothing to do with the Mountain King situation.
::{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 02a 2.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Before he got tangled up with us, he was looking into the [[Mare Jivari]]. That's another major part of [[Natlan]]'s history.
::{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 02a 3.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Our ancestor, [[Burkina]] once fought a campaign there alongside the five other heroes. But it's not such an easy place to get to these days.
::{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 02a 4.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' That's about all I know, though. I have yet to take a job that involves the Mare Jivari.
:{{DIcon}} I'm pretty curious about [[Ajaw]].
::{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 02b 1.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Heh, Ajaw's piqued your interest, huh? It's true that he's a relic from an earlier [[Saurian]] age, but since we're bound to each other by a contract, you can see him as my companion for now.
::{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 02b 2.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I know he can be awful, but don't worry. As long as I'm still around, he can't do that much damage.
::{{DIcon}} ...As long as you're around?
::{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Mhm, that's a key part of the contract. Ajaw has to obey my orders and lend me his power for as long as I live.
::{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' And after I die, Ajaw gets control of my body. That's the price.
::{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 05.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Crazy, isn't it? That was probably the first time I really appreciated what it meant to pay a "price." Then, once I signed the contract, I received the [[Ancient Name|ancient name]] "{{Rubi|Malipo|Turnfire}}."
::{{A|vo dialog jnqlq004 kinich 06.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' But that's a whole other story. We can get into it another time, if you're interested.
----
;(Talk to Trinidad)
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 1 trinidad 01.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Ah, at long last, you're back.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 1 trinidad 02.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' I hear that you've done much for our people these last few days. Everyone has nothing but praise for you.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 1 trinidad 03.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Many young people have heard the rumors, too. They're all eager to meet our new flame bearer.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, they won't have to wait long! It's almost time for the ceremony!
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We really hope we can resolve the Mountain King situation quickly and smoothly. Seems like a lot of people have been worrying about it, huh?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 1 trinidad 04.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Haha, well, it's nearly time. So, if you're ready, then follow me to the ceremony site.
;(A note appears on-screen)
::'''Note'''
::The party cannot be changed during the Turnfire Night ritual. Please choose a suitable party in advance.
::Recommended Elements
::{{Element|Pyro}}
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, let's head off.
::{{A|vo jnqlq005 2 paimon 01a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Off we go!
:{{DIcon}} I still need time to prepare.
::{{A|vo jnqlq005 2 trinidad 02b 1.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Of course, there's no rush. I can wait for you right here.

;(Talk to Trinidad again if "I still need time to prepare" was chosen)
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 2 trinidad 01.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Are you ready?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, let's head off.
::{{A|vo jnqlq005 2 paimon 01a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Off we go!
:{{DIcon}} I still need time to prepare.
::{{A|vo jnqlq005 2 trinidad 02b 1.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Of course, there's no rush. I can wait for you right here.

;(After selecting "Yeah, let's head off.")
:;(They move to the ceremony site)<!-- black screen transition -->
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 trinidad 01.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Here we are.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 wayna 01.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Our honored guests have arrived.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 wayna 02.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' I have heard much about your fine work over the past few days. I hope you'll allow us to thank you properly after tonight's ceremony.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't worry about it. Getting this huge venue ready must've been a huge task. No need to make extra work for yourselves on our account.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 trinidad 02.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' If it means getting the Mountain King issue resolved, no cost is too great to bear.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 wayna 03.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' A resolution will come in due course. But every great fire starts as a tiny spark. We must take it one step at a time.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 trinidad 03.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' No one would disagree with you if that were possible, Chief... But it's been far too long since we've seen a real step forward.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 trinidad 04.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Look around you. Can't you see how our numbers have dwindled since the last Turnfire Night?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 wayna 04.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' The ceremony was arranged on short notice. Many are away from home, and could not make it back in time.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 trinidad 05.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' That may be so, but still...
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Good evening, {{Traveler}} and Paimon.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kinich! Not a moment too soon...
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Chief Wayna, Elder Trinidad, could you give us a minute? I'd like to give {{Traveler}} a few pointers as the previous Flame Bearer.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 wayna 05.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Very well, but make it quick. Let me know when you're done, and we will begin the ceremony.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Let's step to the side. Has anyone gone over the key steps of the ceremony with you yet?
:;(They move to a nearby area)
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, Elder Trinidad did. But uh... Paimon seems to have forgotten them...
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 ajaw 01.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' What a surprise, the flying ant has an ant-sized brain.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' If you don't want your tongue to be burned off by the [[Sacred Flame|sacred flame]] tonight, I suggest you stay quiet.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 ajaw 02.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Tch...
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 kinich 05.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' See those Sacred Flame Pillars? Once you've lit the fire, go light each one up in turn.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 kinich 06.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Once that's done, head down into the cave where the Mountain King slumbers, light the braziers along the way, then bring the flame to the final altar. Then, the ceremony is complete.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That sounds simple enough.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 kinich 07.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' The process isn't complicated, but remember &mdash; you mustn't turn back at any point. If you miss a pillar, you can't light the next one then come back to it.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 kinich 08.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' You have to keep moving forward, or it's seen as disrespecting our ancestors. If that happens, you won't receive the blessing of the [[Turnfire]], and you'll have to start over.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 kinich 09.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I made you a diagram that summarizes the steps. Take a look.
:{{DIcon}} Got it.
:[[File:Item Path of Turnfire Image.png|x200px]]
::An illustration of the Turnfire Night ritual. It resembles the [[Scions of the Canopy]]'s totem.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's our part. What about you?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 kinich 10.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I'll be with you the whole way, and once you've lit the altar, I'll start summoning the Rift.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 kinich 11.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' You can leave that side of things to me. Just focus on your part.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay. We'll try to remember all that and get it right first time.
:{{DIcon}} Well then, shall we begin?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 kinich 12.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Ready when you are.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 kinich 13.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' But I think I saw [[Huni]] and the others just now, maybe you should say hi before you start. Might make you less nervous.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 4 kinich 14.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Just tell the chief when you're ready.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Path of Turnfire}})

;(Talk to Kinich near Trinidad's home if the Special Story Mode was exited before completing the ceremony, optional)
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 3 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I saw you leave the ceremony site, and was worried you might get lost, so I came to check up on you.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 3 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Are you in trouble? Let me help you out, then escort you back.
:{{DIcon}} Let's head back.
::{{A|vo jnqlq005 3 kinich 03b 1.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Kay. Let's go.
:;(The Special Story Mode is entered)
:{{DIcon}} I just need a moment.
::{{A|vo jnqlq005 3 kinich 03a 1.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Sure. I'll wait here.

;(Talk to Huni, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog jnqlq005 huni 01a.ogg}} {{A|vo dialog jnqlq005 huni 01b.ogg}} '''Huni:''' {{MC|m=Mr. Traveler, you look so cool today!|f=Miss Traveler, you look so pretty today!}}
:{{A|vo dialog jnqlq005 huni 02.ogg}} '''Huni:''' You're gonna make sure the Mountain King never threatens us again, right?
:{{A|vo dialog jnqlq005 huni 03.ogg}} '''Huni:''' I believe in you! I'll be cheering you on the whole time!

;(Talk to [[Thiago]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog jnqlq005 thiago 01.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Hey, bet you're surprised to see me? Didn't think I'd be coming, did ya?
:{{A|vo dialog jnqlq005 thiago 02.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' I was all packed up and ready to go, but then I thought, I wonder if the ceremony will go any differently with a new Flame Bearer? So yeah, here I am again!
:{{A|vo dialog jnqlq005 thiago 03.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' I still owe you for that picture you took. So once you start, I'll be dancing to cheer you on.
:{{A|vo dialog jnqlq005 thiago 04.ogg}} '''Thiago:''' Don't be nervous. You'll do great.

;(Talk to [[Ponche]] or [[Toba]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog jnqlq005 toba 01a.ogg}} {{A|vo dialog jnqlq005 toba 01b.ogg}} '''Toba:''' {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} {{Traveler}}! You're finally here! I even dragged my uncle out to watch the ceremony.
:{{A|vo dialog jnqlq005 ponce 01.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' Although I'd hoped for the Malipo name-bearer to perform this ceremony, that was never anything to do with you. So please don't take it personally.
:{{A|vo dialog jnqlq005 ponce 02.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' I got thinking last night, and I realized: If the lesson of {{Rubi|Malipo|Turnfire}} is to look forwards, then I should accept that my book is gone, and start anew.
:{{A|vo dialog jnqlq005 ponce 03.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' Besides, I'll have even more to write about this time, given this will be our first Turnfire ceremony featuring a flame bearer from another land.
:{{A|vo dialog jnqlq005 ponce 04.ogg}} '''Ponche:''' I'll be taking detailed notes.
:{{A|vo dialog jnqlq005 toba 02a.ogg}} {{A|vo dialog jnqlq005 toba 02b.ogg}} '''Toba:''' Good luck, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} {{Traveler}}! You got this!

;(Talk to Trinidad, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog jnqlq005 trinidad 01.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Mighty outlanders, the time has finally come. You know what must be done.
:{{A|vo dialog jnqlq005 trinidad 02.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' Please remember, you must cleanse as much Abyssal energy as you can. This is the only way to prolong the Mountain King's slumber.
:{{A|vo dialog jnqlq005 trinidad 03.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' I am sure you have what it takes.

;(Talk to Wayna)
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 9 wayna 01.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' How are you doing? Is all in order?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, we're ready to go.
::{{A|vo jnqlq005 9 wayna 02a 1.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' I'm counting on you. Don't forget what we talked about.
:;(The ceremony begins)
::{{A|vo jnqlq005 9 wayna 02a 2.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' By past fuel, and present flame, life marches ever on...
::{{A|vo jnqlq005 9 wayna 02a 3.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' My brothers and sisters, the time has come to light the fire once again, and let the Turnfire Night shine bright in Huitztlan!
:{{DIcon}} I still need time to prepare.
::{{A|vo jnqlq005 9 wayna 02b 1.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Very well. Then come back when you're ready.

;(Approach the sacred flame)
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 10 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Go get the sacred flame.

;(If the player gets close enough to light any tower they are not supposed to or a tower that has already been lit, including the current tower if they leave and re-approach it, before lighting all nine pillars; optional)
::{{A|vo jnqlq005 10 kinich 06.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' That's not gonna work. You have to do them in order, and there's no going back. You'd better start again.

;(After lighting the second pillar)
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 10 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Great stuff.

;(After lighting the fifth pillar)
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 10 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' You're over halfway. Keep it up.

;(After lighting the eighth pillar)
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 10 kinich 05.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Impressive. Just one more to go.
:;(A tiled solid phlogiston path to the ninth pillar appears)

;(Walk onto the second tile)

;(After lighting the ninth pillar)

;(Approach the marked location by the first brazier on the ground)

;(Approach the marked location further in)

;(Approach the marked location on the platform)

:{{A|vo jnqlq005 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's the Mountain King up ahead, right?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 11 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' That's him. [[Kongamato]], king of the [[Yumkasaur]]s from five hundred years ago. He's very powerful.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon can tell, he's huge... Let's tread carefully. We don't wanna wake him up...
:{{DIcon}} Should we pretend to purify the King?
:{{Color|menu|At this time, Chief Wayna and company arrive...}}
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 11 wayna 01.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' You've made it at last. You did even better than I expected.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 11 trinidad 01.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' {{Traveler}}, now comes the final and most important step of the ceremony. Please use the power of the sacred flame to cleanse the Mountain King of Abyssal filth!

:{{A|vo jnqlq005 11 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Chief Wayna, Elder Trinidad, this is about to get a little dangerous. You should step back.

:{{A|vo jnqlq005 11 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Solving the Mountain King issue.

:{{A|vo jnqlq005 11 kinich 06.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I can't guarantee it, but I'm fairly confident.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 11 trinidad 05.ogg}} '''Trinidad:''' {{Traveler}}, this is not what we agreed on! You must cleanse the Mountain King of every last trace of Abyssal contamination!
:{{DIcon}} I've changed my mind. I don't want the King to die.
:{{DIcon}} This was Kinich's idea. It has nothing to do with me.

Recognizing the familiar Ancient Name, the Mountain King recalls the request of Burkina, the previous owner of said Name, and decides to carry the pain of the past and continue forward.}}

:{{Black Screen|The following day, in the Scions of the Canopy tribe...}}

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew... Pretty eventful day yesterday, huh? Paimon wonders how things are doing now. Let's go ask the chief.

;(Talk to Wayna)
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 15 wayna 01.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' {{Traveler}}, you've come at just the right time. I have some good news for you...
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 15 wayna 02.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Trinidad's condition has stabilized. He suffered burns on much of his body, but we believe he'll survive.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 15 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess that's the best news we could hope for...
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 15 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon has to ask, is everyone in your tribe such a risk-taker? First Kinich, then Elder Trinidad... Is this the Scions of the Canopy's adventurous spirit in action?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 15 wayna 03.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' We're simply not afraid to charge ahead into the unknown.
:{{DIcon}} Is Kinich okay?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 15 wayna 04.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' He's fine, don't worry. He's gone to check on the Mountain King &mdash; something most mysterious has happened.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 15 wayna 05.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' After the incident yesterday, a transparent shell has formed around the Mountain King's body. We don't understand the mechanism behind it, but this shell appears to insulate him against the influence of Abyssal power.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 15 wayna 06.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' It is somewhat akin to a scab, in that it stops the Abyssal energy within him from bleeding out, while also preventing further Abyssal energy from seeping in and infecting him.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 15 wayna 07.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' We've never seen anything like it. The tribe's most senior elders believe it was caused when he was burned by the sacred flame, similar to the way burned wood becomes charcoal.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 15 wayna 08.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' I think their theory makes sense. After all, we've never thrown the Mountain King directly into the sacred flame before.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 15 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, so it's made a barrier against Abyssal energy? That's... a good thing, right?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 15 wayna 09.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' It's practically a miracle, from what we've seen of it so far. It means that the Mountain King's level of Abyssal energy is now stable. No longer will we need to perform an annual cleansing ceremony.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 15 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow! That's amazing!
:{{DIcon}} Was it really just the power of the sacred flame?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 15 wayna 11.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' I know what you're thinking. The young people in the tribe are already speculating that yesterday's ceremony was a Turnfire Night like none other in our history.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 15 wayna 12.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Because you and Kinich... You summoned the very flame that appears in our ancient legends. A great, transparent ball of fire.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 15 wayna 13.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' And that fire is what saved the Mountain King.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 15 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! So that was the real Turnfire?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 15 wayna 14.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' Haha, I may be the chief of this tribe, but I've only ever known the Turnfire as a concept in our legends. I cannot answer that question.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 15 wayna 15.ogg}} '''Wayna:''' If anyone can answer it, I suspect it would be the bearer of the {{Rubi|Malipo|Turnfire}} name. He is in the Mountain King's cave as we speak.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 15 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah... So, Kinich then. Why don't we go see how he's doing?
----
;(Approach Kinich)
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Kinich!
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Hey yourselves. You two doing okay after yesterday?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We were gonna ask you the same question... You scared Paimon half to death when you rushed into the fire.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Sorry, I couldn't just stand and watch the Mountain King get burned alive.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 ajaw 01.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' So you thought you'd try and extinguish the sacred flame with [[Dendro]]? Or was that an attempt to make the Almighty Dragonlord, K'uhul Ajaw die of laughter?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' The sacred flame only possesses a fraction of the [[Pyro Archon]]'s power. It's not as if I was fighting the Pyro Archon herself.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kinich... When you went into the flames, were you intending to... uh...
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Intending to what?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' To, um... do the same thing as Burkina...
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 kinich 06.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Sacrifice myself? Of course not. My focus was on keeping the Mountain King alive, not on what it would cost.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 kinich 07.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' But now I'm curious. What made you think I was going to sacrifice myself?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well... Because everyone's saying the Turnfire is what saved the King last night...
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And Ponche's theory was that summoning the Turnfire is a tit-for-tat exchange, right? So Paimon thought you'd decided to pay for it with your life...
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 kinich 08.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' So you've heard that rumor too.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 kinich 09.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I'm afraid I can't say for sure. What happened yesterday was a first for me too.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, if even you don't know, there's probably no one in the world who does.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 kinich 10.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' What I would say is, if that really was the power of the Turnfire, I'd sooner believe that the Mountain King summoned it himself.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Mountain King? Then... what price did he pay?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 kinich 11.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' The core meaning of "price" is not atonement or compensation, but what you're willing to give up in order to obtain what you want.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 kinich 12.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' It's easy to die for your sins, much harder to live with the guilt and keep on going. In the end, the Mountain King chose the latter option &mdash; for Burkina, and for the tribe. That's the price he paid.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright... So how is the Mountain King doing now?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 kinich 13.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Health-wise, there's nothing to worry about. He'll enter a fighting stance whenever we set foot in his territory.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 kinich 14.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' But his attacks are gentler now, and not as crazed as before. Like he said yesterday, he just intends to be a sparring partner for people to practice with.
:{{DIcon}} You said "health-wise." Is something else bothering you?<ref group="Note">The [[Travel Log]] incorrectly attributes this line to Paimon.</ref>
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 kinich 15.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Yeah. I tried communicating with him again, but he didn't respond.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 ajaw 02.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Hmph, we daresay that Locust King has well and truly lost its mind. The lights are on, but nobody is home.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 ajaw 03.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Its body remains fighting fit thanks to the perverse power of the Abyss, but time has been less kind to its soul... It was ground to a pulp long ago!
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But we saw him come back to his senses yesterday...
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 ajaw 04.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' That was merely one last burst of brain activity before it croaked. As you humans would say, it went out with a bang.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, come on! Stop being such a doomer. Paimon bets the Mountain King has finally let go of the tragedies of the past now, and is focusing on moving forward!
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's why he doesn't have time to chat with us. He's too busy thinking about the future!
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 kinich 16.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Heh, well, at least it means my fellow tribespeople can move forward now, too. Thank you for your help, {{Traveler}}. I owe you one.
:{{DIcon}} Nah, you already gave me that "gift."
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, that's right. You caught Enjou for us, remember?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 kinich 17.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' But he ended up being completely useless. It's not a fair trade if you lost out.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh, that's on him. It's not your fault he's useless! Besides, we're friends now. You don't owe us anything.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 kinich 18.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Friends? But your friendship is an even more valuable gift. I can't in good conscience accept it for free...
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 kinich 19.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' So promise me, if you need anything in the future, you'll come to me.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 16 kinich 20.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' For you, I'll do anything.

;(Meanwhile, at the mural Thiago found)
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 fuchikami 01.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' ACHOO! Ahem... So in the end, only poor little Huni got the sad ending?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 huni 01.ogg}} '''Huni:''' Yeah! Everyone's happy, except me. First [[Nanna]], then my Dad... Why does everyone in my family have to suffer?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 toba 01.ogg}} '''Toba:''' Huni... It'll be okay. Your dad will get better soon.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 huni 02.ogg}} '''Huni:''' Toba, you're my friend, so I shouldn't say this to your face. But it was all the Mountain King's fault.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 toba 02.ogg}} '''Toba:''' Ehh!?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 fuchikami 02.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' Now hold your horses, kiddo. If you promise not to fight, Uncle [[Sanka]] will tell you a story.
:;(Huni and Toba both immediately glare at Sanka)
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 fuchikami 03.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' ...Okay, before you roll your eyes out of your skull, I promise you can trust me. I almost got my eyebrows burned off by the Turnfire after last time. That's why I came back, to make it up to you!
;(Sanka briefly waits for a response from Huni and Toba, who continue to glare at him)
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 fuchikami 04.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' ...Alright, I'll just get to the point. Do you know what Uncle Sanka loves the most about your people?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 huni 03.ogg}} '''Huni:''' ...What?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 fuchikami 05.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' Your extreme sports.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 toba 03.ogg}} '''Toba:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 fuchikami 06.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' On my first day here, I got hit by someone falling out of the sky. I believe you call it "bungee jumping"?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 fuchikami 07.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' It's a dangerous sport, to be sure, but the courage it took to make the jump impressed the heck out of me. So I introduced myself to the jumper, we made friends, and I even helped treat her wounds.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 huni 04.ogg}} '''Huni:''' Aw. Such a nice friend.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 fuchikami 08.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' Of course. Anyway, the good times didn't last, 'cause I got captured by a powerful foe, so we had to part ways for a while.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 fuchikami 09.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' In the hands of the enemy, I was scorned, scolded, and nearly given away as a gift. Oh, it was so humiliating! A horrible experience to look back on.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 fuchikami 10.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' "Why does Uncle Sanka always have to suffer?" I thought. So I feel your pain, Huni. I was in the same position.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 fuchikami 11.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' But in the end, I made it through, and I left all of those painful memories in the past. I even managed to reunite with my friend!
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 toba 04.ogg}} '''Toba:''' Uh... Is that it?
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 huni 05.ogg}} '''Huni:''' The moral of the story is to look forward in life, right? Yeah, we've heard that one millions of times. Sorry, Uncle Sanka, but you're not cut out to be a teacher.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 fuchikami 12.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' Very smart, Huni. But not quite smart enough.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 fuchikami 13.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' What I'm trying to tell you is that after I reunited with my friend, I found her injuries were all healed, but she really missed her family. So, I thought you might like to see her too.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 fuchikami 14.ogg}} '''Sanka:''' She's right behind you. Turn around and see.
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 huni 06.ogg}} '''Huni:''' Another trick about not turning back? I'm not falling for that one again!
:{{A|vo jnqlq005 17 huni 07.ogg}} '''Huni:''' ...Huh!?
:{{Color|menu|Huni feels a warmth from behind. Turning around, she sees her friend Nanna. Before she can recover from her shock, Nanna has pressed her face against Huni's.}}
