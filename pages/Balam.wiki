{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Balam:''' Hello, friend!
:'''Balam:''' Sorry to put you on the spot like this, but from where you're standing, is there anything about my voice that sounds a bit off?
:{{DIcon}} Not at all, it's positively booming.
::'''Balam:''' Phew... Thank goodness for that.
::'''Balam:''' Seems like there was nothing wrong with that drink I just had after all. Though my throat still feels a bit sticky...
::'''Balam:''' A host's voice is their greatest weapon, so we can't get careless with it.
::{{DIcon}} Any tips for maintaining a healthy throat?
::'''Balam:''' Exercise more! The trick is to stay healthy.
::'''Balam:''' You heard that right. The only way to keep your spirits up so you can speak confidently is by staying healthy.
::'''Balam:''' Projecting your voice so that everyone hears it when you're up in a hot air balloon isn't easy, especially when you're competing against the roar of the crowd and the contestants' impassioned cries.
::'''Balam:''' I get through so much water over the course of a competition that I could even drink the People of the Springs dry!
::'''Balam:''' Oh, and speaking of which, if you want to keep your throat in top shape, you should drink more water and less unhealthy beverages!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} But drinks make people happy...
:::'''Balam:''' Do they, then? Well, guess there's no choice in the matter. I suppose we'll have to just compromise on one item here, then?
:::'''Balam:''' As I see it, drinking water isn't exactly something too sad, but some prefer sweeter things.
:::'''Balam:''' Alright, then, let's have ourselves a little pick-me-up.
:::;(Obtain {{Item|Chocolate|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} I can't hear anything wrong with it.
::'''Balam:''' I see. Well, I guess there's no problem after all.
