The '''Watatsumi Army''', also known as '''the resistance''', is an [[Inazuma]]n resistance organization led by [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]] that opposes the [[Vision Hunt Decree]]. It is comprised of those who fear losing or have already lost their [[Vision]]s to the [[Tenryou Commission]], and those who are against the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] whether they have Visions themselves or not. The resistance is based in [[Watatsumi Island]], where the [[Sangonomiya Shrine]] is located.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/l8YXe7EkmoU?t=2671 Version 2.0 Special Program] (Timestamp: 44m 31s)</ref>

The Watatsumi Army continues to function even after the abolishment of the Vision Hunt Decree, but mostly to serve as peacekeepers and help rebuild the devastated economy on the island. It is also working to clear Watatsumi Island of the [[Fatui]].
