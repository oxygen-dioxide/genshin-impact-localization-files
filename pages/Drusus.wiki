==Profile==
An eccentric researcher from the Akademiya, Drusus enjoys writing riddles and putting them around [[Sumeru City]] for people to discover. The [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] stumble across one of his riddles, and they travel through the whole city solving it before finally meeting him to receive their reward. They later help him create a new series of riddles, providing ideas for where to place the clues and what to write.

He may be the mentor mentioned by the Treasure Hoarder [[Narzam]], who also enjoys riddles and brain teasers. He mentions her at the end of [[Treasure of Wisdom: A New Plan]] and wonders if she is causing trouble.
