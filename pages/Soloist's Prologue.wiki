;(Approach the marked location in Caravan Ribat)
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good ol' Caravan Ribat. Huh, now let Paimon think... What were we up to the first time we came here?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon remembers... [[Nahida]]'s consciousness had been trapped by [[The Doctor]], but we followed the clues she left behind to help her!
:{{DIcon}} Good memory, Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} I guess we may have stumbled upon this place at some point before.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So much time has already passed since then, and it seems Sumeru's changing for the better now that Nahida's in charge, right?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon just hopes this peace will last a long time, and then Nahida won't have any more new problems to deal with.
:{{DIcon}} Yes, but as long as we're around...
:{{DIcon}} It's hard to say what will happen...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, guess you're right... We somehow always find ourselves right in the thick of it... Who knows what will happen next!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Come to think of it, maybe it's all because of you... Maybe you're just a magnet for trouble!
:{{DIcon}} I was just thinking that you might be the problem, Paimon.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Me!? Before Paimon ran into you, Paimon never ran into any trouble! At most, when she was super tired, Paimon got caught in some strange whirlpool and sucked out to sea! And even then, you fished Paimon out!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, anyway... For Nahida's sake, maybe we should think about heading to our next destination for now.
:{{DIcon}} Next stop: Fontaine.
:{{DIcon}} Alright, let's continue our journey.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 dehya 01.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Ah, look who it is. Running into you in a place like this, I can see you two still love wandering around.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, it's [[Dehya]]! Since when are we just "wandering around"? We're usually taking care of some serious business... Even though it may have nothing to do with our journey...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But never mind that... What brings you here?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' I just finished a commission in the desert for a usual client of mine. Nothing too interesting... just escorting a shipment of goods. I'm on my way to report back.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' That's when I saw you two all the way over there, chatting away. What were you two talking about, anyway?
:{{DIcon}} We're preparing to leave Sumeru and head to Fontaine.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Huh? You serious...?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 dehya 05.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Can't say I saw that coming... *sigh* But you are travelers, after all. I guess you'd never stay for too long in one place.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 dehya 06.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Bumping into you like this will become a rarity. Ah, I'm starting to feel sad just thinking about it.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 dehya 07.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Hey, how about I gather a few mercs to escort you two... Whaddya say?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thanks, but no need. Paimon had no clue you'd miss us so much. But don't worry, we'll come back to see everyone when we get a chance!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 dehya 08.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Sounds good! All you need to do to get to Fontaine is cross this stretch of desert and navigate some waterways. Knowing you two, I'm sure it won't be anything you can't handle.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 dehya 09.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' So, when are ya leaving?
:{{DIcon}} We'll leave as soon as we've finished a few more preparations.
:{{DIcon}} Journeys should be spontaneous.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, wait a sec... Paimon just remembered there are still a few dishes in Sumeru that Paimon hasn't tried yet. Now where's that list Paimon made...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 eclaireur 01.ogg}} '''???:''' ...
:;(The unnamed man leaves)
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 dehya 10.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' I see. Guess you won't be needing a going away party or anything. It's sad enough to see you go like this.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 dehya 11.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Though now that I think about it, Sumeru wouldn't be what it is today without you. Seems true heroes always prefer leaving quietly, haha.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' By the way, should we go say bye to Nahida?
:{{DIcon}} In her case...
:{{DIcon}} She'll know from our dreams anyway.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, good point. Then there's no need to bother her in the real world.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 dehya 12.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Then I guess this is goodbye for now, {{Traveler}} and Paimon. Whether as a client or a friend, you're always welcome to come find me.
:{{DIcon}} Take care.
:{{DIcon}} Bye, Dehya.
:;(Dehya continues on her way.)
:{{A|vo fdaq001 1 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Goodbye, Dehya! Bye bye, Sumeru!
:{{Black Screen|After settling matters in Sumeru, you approach the border with Fontaine...}}
:;(The player is teleported to the Realm of Farakhkert Teleport Waypoint near the border, where the Traveler and Paimon walk up the desert sands to the edge of a cliff and look out towards the waterfalls of Fontaine and Romaritime Harbor in the distance.)
----
;(Approach the port)
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew, after crossing all that sand and water, we finally made it... This must be Fontaine's port.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, everything looks so advanced in Fontaine. Paimon's heard that the industry here is extremely developed, and there are all kinds of unusual machines.
:{{DIcon}} So I heard, and it's about what I imagined.
:{{DIcon}} It's even more impressive than I expected.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just seeing the sights as tourists is nice, but maybe it would be better if we found something to do.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What do you think, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} Let's start by meeting the [[Hydro Archon|Furina]].
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good idea. Nahida gave us loads of useful information.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seeking out [[The Seven]] is probably still our best source for information at this point.
:{{DIcon}} Our journey is to find [[Traveler's Sibling|my sibling]]...
:{{DIcon}} And also to find the truth.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! The more we can learn, the better.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So what do you think the Hydro Archon's like? Will we get along? Nahida said that she has "a very unique personality"... whatever that means.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' To learn about a nation's god, start with the nation's people! There seems to be some locals talking over there, let's go see if we can join the party.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 antoine 01.ogg}} '''Etienne:''' If you ask me, it's a tragedy how things ended for him. Clearly, he was a pretty decent person.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 vienne 01.ogg}} '''Rena:''' Yeah, I didn't expect that kind of ending for him... I thought he would at least fight on a little longer for his family.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 vienne 02.ogg}} '''Rena:''' I was expecting a sudden plot twist, but it's a pity that it never happened... Still, his story is quite the tear-jerker...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 antoine 02.ogg}} '''Etienne:''' Uh, excuse me, can I help you two? I couldn't help but notice you standing here listening.
:;(Lynette can be seen in the background)
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Hi! We're travelers new to Fontaine, and we had something we wanted to ask, but you seemed to be really busy talking about some kind of play, so we didn't want to interrupt.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 antoine 03.ogg}} '''Etienne:''' A "play"? Oh no, no... We're talking about something that really happened. In fact, it's a case that was just heard a few days ago.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Like a real trial? But the way you were talking about it and the words you used just now made it sound like some kind of story...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 vienne 03.ogg}} '''Rena:''' Well, good tales are often based on true stories, aren't they? And what you see in reality may also be someone deliberately putting on an act while harboring ulterior motives...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 vienne 04.ogg}} '''Rena:''' Whether something is true or not simply isn't that important. The main thing is whether the story being acted out on the stage is splendid enough.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 vienne 05.ogg}} '''Rena:''' Oh, but it looks like you're not from around here! You probably don't know that the Fontaine Court of Justice is called the [[Opera Epiclese]], or more commonly known as just "the opera house."
:{{DIcon}} So they see trials as a sort of "opera"...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, uh... shouldn't court cases be treated a little more seriously than that? Not to question Fontaine's way of doing things, it's just that putting someone on trial is usually a very serious thing...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 vienne 06.ogg}} '''Rena:''' Hehe, no worries. Other visitors to Fontaine have wondered the same thing. You could say that we just don't want to waste the moving stories behind those cases.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 vienne 07.ogg}} '''Rena:''' And as for your worries about whether the cases are treated with due reverence, we have the absolutely just and honorable Chief Justice [[Neuvillette]]...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 vienne 08.ogg}} '''Rena:''' As well as the [[Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale]], a machine created by the Archon. Between the machine and the Chief Justice, false charges and injustice are a thing of the past now.
:{{DIcon}} A judgment device created by the Archon...
:{{DIcon}} So this is the "Nation of Justice"...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Oratrice? Is it some kind of machine too? Paimon's curious... We should check it out if we get the chance.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, Paimon almost forgot to ask you our question! Do you know what we should do if we want to meet the Hydro Archon?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 antoine 04.ogg}} '''Etienne:''' Oh, that's easy! Just go to the opera house. Lady [[Furina]] practically lives there, you could definitely say it's her biggest passion.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 vienne 09a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo fdaq001 2 vienne 09b.ogg}}--> '''Rena:''' Ah, I think what they mean is that they wish to speak with the Archon personally.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 vienne 10.ogg}} '''Rena:''' In that case, I'm afraid it's going to be a tad more difficult. You'll have to make an appointment well in advance, and it'll depend on whether or not she has any timeslots available.
:{{DIcon}} Make an appointment?
:{{DIcon}} Timeslots?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Is the Hydro Archon super busy taking care of official stuff? Wait, didn't you say that she's always at the opera house?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 antoine 05.ogg}} '''Etienne:''' No, no, Lady Furina seldom takes an interest with the nation's affairs. The reason it's difficult to make an appointment is simply because she's incredibly popular.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 vienne 11.ogg}} '''Rena:''' That's right, after all, she is the Archon. Though she may tend to get a little dramatic from time to time, people can't get enough of her.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, first time Paimon's ever heard of an Archon being described that way before...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah wait, Paimon gets it now! The Hydro Archon is kinda like a big celebrity here, right?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 antoine 06.ogg}} '''Etienne:''' Yeah, I suppose you could say that. Heh, perhaps you could even say our "mascot."
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 vienne 12.ogg}} '''Rena:''' Hang on, this is still Fontaine's Archon you're talking about. You should show some more respect!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 antoine 07.ogg}} '''Etienne:''' Yes, you're right. I guess I should at least try to be a little more respectful in front of visitors. Otherwise, I might get arrested and find myself face to face with Monsieur Neuvillette.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 vienne 13.ogg}} '''Rena:''' Haha, come on... Sure, there's a lot of laws here, but nobody's going to be arrested for saying something disrespectful about the Hydro Archon.
:{{DIcon}} Seems the people of Fontaine really like the Hydro Archon...
:{{DIcon}} But they don't appear to revere her.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, I think we get it, thank you! At least we now know that we can find the Hydro Archon at the opera house.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But who knows how long making an appointment will take... Guess we could have a look around the city in the meantime.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, {{Traveler}}, what are you looking over there for?
:{{DIcon}} There's a girl over there...
:{{DIcon}} She's been standing alone for quite some time...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, maybe something's the matter... *gasp* She isn't going to jump into the water, is she?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 2 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Maybe we'd better go check on her.

;(Talk to [[Etienne]] or [[Rena]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq001 antoine 01.ogg}} '''Etienne:''' Hey, how about we get some tickets to the next trial?
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq001 vienne 01.ogg}} '''Rena:''' Hmm, I think we'd better wait and see what kind of case it is first.

;(Talk to [[Lynette]])
:'''???:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, hello there! Excuse me! Are you alright?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lynette 01.ogg}} '''???:''' ...Huh?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lynette 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Ah, I'm fine... Thanks.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, okay then. We just noticed that you seemed to be worried about something.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lynette 03.ogg}} '''???:''' About many things, actually... But there's nothing I can do but just keep my troubles to myself.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lynette 04.ogg}} '''???:''' I was just reminiscing about a place [[Lyney|my brother]] and I would play when we were kids. It was just atop that hill over there, see?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, you're pointing at the sea... Wait, are you saying that you and your brother lived in the water?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe they're mermaids?
:{{DIcon}} Or a fantastical race from Fontaine?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lynette 05.ogg}} '''???:''' Though people call the waters around Fontaine a "sea," it's actually just an inland lake that's filled with fresh water.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lynette 06.ogg}} '''???:''' And though I can still see that hill clearly in my memories, now it's been completely submerged.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lynette 07.ogg}} '''???:''' He would skip and jump, tossing sand in the wind... The sun shone brightly and the air was filled with the scent of the sea.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lynette 08.ogg}} '''???:''' But now the water is gradually swallowing our memories...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lynette 09.ogg}} '''???:''' It won't be long before it swallows us.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, sorry, Paimon doesn't really get what you mean.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lyney 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Ah, I don't believe we've had the pleasure of meeting. Are you Lynette's new friends?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, and you are...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lyney 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Thanks for looking after my sister, she often comes here to reminisce about our childhood, that's all. There's no need for any concern.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Ah, allow me to introduce myself. I'm Lyney, and this is my sister, Lynette. If I had to guess, I'd say you must be travelers from abroad.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nice to meet you, Paimon is Paimon, and this is {{Traveler}}. We just arrived in Fontaine.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We were just talking with your sister, uh... even though we didn't really get what she was saying.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hmm, I see. It's unusual for Lynette to be so willing to talk with anyone, in fact, she seldom speaks at all. I'm usually the only one she ever talks to.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, really? Then you two are just like us! Paimon's always the one talking for some reason.
:{{DIcon}} There's hardly anything left for me to say with you around, Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} Because you always steal all my lines.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh! So that's how you think it is?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lynette 10.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I also think my brother can be too talkative at times.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Ah, hehe... Seems you were right, Paimon. We are quite similar.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So what did Lynette mean just now when she said that the water is engulfing your memories, and that it won't be long before it engulfs you too?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Ah, that... It's from a prophecy that's been circulating in Fontaine for some time now.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well, I suppose "prophecy" isn't exactly the right word, because that implies a certain amount of uncertainty. There's no doubt about what's happening in Fontaine now...
:{{DIcon}} Oh? What's happening in Fontaine?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Where to begin? Hmm...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Ah, let's put that question on hold for a moment. We still haven't formally greeted each other yet, have we?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Did all the introductions earlier not count?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hello, {{Traveler}}.
:{{DIcon}} Hello, Lyney.
:{{DIcon}} It's a pleasure to meet you.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' And hello, Paimon.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Why didn't Paimon get a handshake? You're not poking fun at Paimon, are you!?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lyney 12.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Haha, please don't take offense. Just consider it a sort of etiquette we have here in Fontaine when making new friends. You should remember it, it might prove useful...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, alright then... Well, Paimon's just happy to have a local friend now.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' By the way, we were just getting ready to go to the opera house to meet the Hydro Archon. Would you be able to show us the way?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lyney 13.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' So you're going to see Lady Furina? No problem at all. In fact, I was planning to go to the opera house later myself. I'll gladly take you once I finish things here.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 4 lyney 14.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Please follow me.

;(Follow Lyney)
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Uh, you said you were going to see Lady Furina? Well, it seems Lady Furina has come to see you.
:;(A few guards and [[Clorinde]] file in and Furina makes a grand entrance, standing over the port)
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? So... she's the Hydro Archon? But how did she know we were looking for her?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' My dear people, rich and poor, those with cup in hand and those with nothing at all, raise your glasses in celebration! If you don't have one, then just raise your hand in lieu.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 02a.ogg}} {{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 02b.ogg}} '''Furina:''' As you can all see, two unfamiliar travelers have arrived in our nation. Come, let us make a toast in honor of this Traveler and {{MC|m=his|f=her}} companion who have journeyed here from distant lands!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh...? Is she talking about us?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Nobody here seems to be holding a glass...)
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I've long heard of the turmoil and chaos you've left in your wake as you visited other nations, but I welcome you nevertheless... No, I have come to receive you personally.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Fear is for insignificant cowards. I am a god, and I will never entertain the notion of such meaningless wariness. You can be rest assured, I see clearly your sincerity.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Of course, seeking an audience with me is the most sensible thing to do. It will allow you to truly behold my power and witness my authority. Intelligent people always gather under the correct banner.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I, Focalors, hereby welcome you to the nation of Hydro and acknowledge the value and significance of your trip. Now, you may rejoice in this!
:{{DIcon}} Well, finding the Archon was easy enough...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, Paimon still can't believe it... It feels like we've only been here for a few minutes.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But the Hydro Archon's entrance was, uh... How should Paimon describe it...? A little over the top?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahem... Uh, Miss Hydro Archon... How did you know we were coming?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ah, I see. As outlanders, you inevitably lack even some of the most basic understanding. Don't forget that even the gods can be divided into the mediocre and the excellent. I suppose it's only natural for you to be awestruck by my abilities.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' You had best stop and consider... do you really have the noble qualities and etiquette necessary to communicate with a god? All it takes is a flick of my finger for me to know everything about you.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, talk about sounding high and mighty...
:{{DIcon}} Feels like she can't get over herself...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh? What's with these looks? Perhaps the welcoming ceremony still isn't enough? Hmm, what else should I say then?
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, is she waiting for us to start talking?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 vienne 01.ogg}} '''Rena:''' Wow, I didn't expect to see Lady Furina here. What a surprise!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 vienne 02.ogg}} '''Rena:''' Wait, does this mean they're the "Legendary {{MC|m=Blond|f=Blonde}} Traveler"!? How did I not notice before?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 antoine 01.ogg}} '''Etienne:''' Hey, what's all the commotion? Oh, is that Lady Furina? Is there some kinda drama going on?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 lectoure 01a.ogg}} {{A|vo fdaq001 5 lectoure 01b.ogg}} '''Lectoure:''' Of course! That's the {{MC|m=Blond|f=Blonde}} Traveler, the one all those stories are about. Lady Furina came here to personally see {{MC|m=him|f=her}}... Oh, I bet this is going to be the duel of the century!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 antoine 02.ogg}} '''Etienne:''' Oh! I've got to see this! I knew Lady Furina would never disappoint!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ahaha! Yes, but don't get too excited now... My dear believers and spectators alike tend to get quite rowdy, and despite the noise, I've come to tolerate all their ruckus.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' You may consider this my reward to all of you! I have determined that there will be an epic duel between myself and this traveler from another land, just as you were hoping to see!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? Now she wants to fight? Aren't we getting a little ahead of ourselves?
:{{DIcon}} ...Bring it on.
:{{DIcon}} (Fighting gods? I've got a resumé.)
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hmm? Hmph! A&mdash;Are you not afraid? Might I remind you that this is a duel against the divine!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' What are you trying to do, Traveler? Provoking a god in front of her people?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 14a.ogg}} {{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 14b.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ahem, stand down, Clorinde. I admire {{MC|m=his|f=her}} bravery, few have the courage to draw their sword against a god. {{MC|m=He|f=She}} is obviously a true warrior.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 15.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Unfortunately, people nowadays only crave to be thrilled, and a mere duel will not slake their thirst for excitement!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 lectoure 02.ogg}} '''Lectoure:''' ...Yeah, she's right. Just a duel wouldn't be all that interesting...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 antoine 03.ogg}} '''Etienne:''' On [[Erinnyes]], criminals are always requesting duels to defend their honor. They're getting a bit old, to tell the truth.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 16.ogg}} '''Furina:''' You see... then as the god of justice, I shall face this Traveler in another kind of duel... a duel in court!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 lectoure 03.ogg}} '''Lectoure:''' Whoa! Oooh, alright, now that'll be worth seeing!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 antoine 04.ogg}} '''Etienne:''' Right, this is Fontaine, after all. With such a grand opera house, it would be a pity not to use it.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why do you care so much about the crowd's reactions? Seems you've spent a little too much time in the opera house...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Besides, how exactly do you plan to have a duel in court? You mean you're going to put us on trial?
:{{DIcon}} And we haven't committed any crimes.
:{{DIcon}} We literally just arrived here.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 17.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hehe. Oh, we have reason to put you on trial. It's obvious, isn't it?
:{{DIcon}} Obvious?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 18.ogg}} '''Furina:''' According to Fontaine law, no one is permitted to release any flying objects within Fontaine city limits during the first three days of each month. You are clearly guilty of violating this law, no?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 antoine 05.ogg}} '''Etienne:''' Oh! So that's what they've done wrong. That's our Lady Furina, no one knows the laws of Fontaine like she does.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? You call that obvious? What kind of law is that!? Wait, "flying object"...? You mean Paimon!?
:{{DIcon}} Uh...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 19.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Precisely. Now, if you two have no objections, then in the name of the Hydro Archon, I order your arrest.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' My apologies, Lady Furina. I don't mean to spoil the fun, but if you would allow me to interject...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...I don't think that Paimon here meets the definition of a "flying object."
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You tell her, Lyney! Finally, someone who's not crazy... How could anyone call Paimon a flying object!?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 20.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ah, Great Magician Lyney, my beloved citizen. I'll permit you to object, but how exactly do you plan to prove your claim?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hehe, as a magician who just rained on your parade, I naturally should shoulder the responsibility of "saving the show"...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' So, with such an audience gathered here, allow me to perform a trick for everyone.
:'''Lyney:''' (Snap!)
:;(Lyney's [[vision]] glows and a [[Pyro]]-coloured link appears between the Traveler's hand and Paimon's back)
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Tada~
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Waa! What's that on Paimon's back? Hey, when did you do that!?
:{{DIcon}} (Ah, when Lyney patted you on the back...)
:;(A flashback of Lyney patting Paimon's back plays)
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' There. As you can all clearly see, Paimon should be classified as, well, something like a balloon. This rope has been in the Traveler's hand all along, it was just that no one could see it before.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 vienne 03.ogg}} '''Rena:''' Huh, you call that magic? You've got to be joking...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 antoine 06.ogg}} '''Etienne:''' Hahaha, I thought it was pretty good. Nice one!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 lectoure 04.ogg}} '''Lectoure:''' Huh, I'm not sure what to think. It seems Lady Furina's charges no longer hold water...
:'''Furina:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 21.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hah! Hahahaha...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 22.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Amusing. Very amusing, Lyney. Just the sort of unexpected twist that I enjoy. With you here, today's performance can finally be called complete.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Performance? You see all this as a performance?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 23.ogg}} '''Furina:''' In which case, consider the matter of your trial resolved. The god of justice will not bring charges against an innocent person.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 24.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But when there are valid grounds, I will not only judge travelers from abroad...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 25.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But even the gods of other lands, hehehe...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 5 furina 26.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I look forward to seeing your upcoming performance at the opera house, Mister Lyney and Miss Lynette. That's enough for now. Toodle-oo~
:;(Furina and her guards leave)
----<!-- Transition? -->
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And just like that, she's gone. Well, that's the most unpredictable archon Paimon's ever seen... We never even had a chance to ask her anything, but that's a problem for future Paimon! That whole scene just now was really...
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for bailing us out, Lyney.
:{{DIcon}} Did you know that was going to happen?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Don't mention it. I just happened to remember that there was such a law, so I did a little preparation &mdash; just in case. I didn't think it would actually come in handy.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' So, now do you see what kind of god Lady Furina is?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' She can be a bit confusing at times, but she is still amenable to reason.
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, confusing is a good way to put it...
:{{DIcon}} Is she really that reasonable?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, Paimon had no idea you were a magician, Lyney. It sounded like you'll be performing at the opera house, right?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Haha, I just know a few simple tricks I use to make a living. Lynette is my assistant.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' It will actually be my first time performing on the most prestigious stage in Fontaine, the opera house.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But isn't the opera house where criminal trials are held in Fontaine?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' When there are no public trials being held, the opera house hosts a variety of other performances. To the people of Fontaine, the line between a trial and a performance can be a little blurred...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' And speaking of performances, I would be remiss to forgo this opportunity gifted by fate. Might I invite the two of you to see my performance?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' My brother's always excited to make new friends.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, sure. We don't really have anything to do now, and we wanted to go to the opera house anyway.
:{{DIcon}} I would be delighted.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Splendid! In that case, why don't we go together? I'll show you the way. I just have something to take care of first...
:{{DIcon}} Is there any way I can help?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You really mean it? Then I'll take you up on your offer.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' This is a magical item known as a "Magic Pocket." Perhaps you can help me distribute them to the people here.
:[[File:Item Magic Pocket.png|200px|link=]]
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What are they going to use it for?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' About that, hmm... You asked me before about the prophecy, right? Let me start by telling you a little more about what it entails.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I'm not sure exactly when it began, but [[Prophecy of Fontaine|a prophecy]] has been circulating around Fontaine...
:[[File:Soloist's Prologue Computer Graphic.png|300px]]
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 12.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' It says that every person in Fontaine is born with "sin." No matter how the Nation of Justice holds trial after trial, this sin cannot be absolved.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 13.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Until one day, the water levels in Fontaine will rise, and the sinful people will slowly be drowned...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 14.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' In the end, the people will all be dissolved into the waters, and only the Hydro Archon will remain, weeping on her throne... Only then will the sins of the people of Fontaine be washed away.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That sounds pretty gloomy... Why are people in Fontaine born with sin? What is that supposed to mean?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 15.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' There are lots of guesses... Some say that the ancestors of Fontaine stole the power of the seas, and stirred its wrath.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 16.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Others say that the people of Fontaine never heeded the first Hydro Archon's warnings, and offended [[Celestia]]...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 17.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But, here in Fontaine, evidence is what matters. There hasn't been concrete evidence for any of these claims, so they can only be regarded as conjecture.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If even the people in Fontaine don't know what sin they committed, wouldn't it be better just to ignore the prophecy completely? Why bother feeling guilty all the time?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 18.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That's exactly what the people did at first. But... in the last few years, the water levels in Fontaine have actually started rising.
:{{DIcon}} "But now the water is engulfing our memories..."
:{{DIcon}} "It won't be long before it engulfs us."
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Many places have already been completely submerged and now lie beneath the sea.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 19.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Many people carry on with their lives as before and shrug it off as a "natural phenomenon," but [[House of the Hearth|my family]] and I think that the people of Fontaine shouldn't ignore the possibility, which would end up sentencing them to death.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 20.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' We hope that at least the people who reside near the waterfront can move away before it's too late, so we've started distributing Magic Pockets to them.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 21.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' As a magical item, these Magic Pockets have an astonishing capacity. I'm sure they will come in handy when people are moving their belongings.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon gets it! It's like preparing for a rainy day... but this is more than a bit of rain!
:{{DIcon}} If the prophecy is true...
:{{DIcon}} Then is there no way to prevent the disaster?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 22.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hmm, perhaps only absolute power could ever contend with such a catastrophe. Hehe, but who knows? We're just tiny specks in the grand scheme of things.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 6 lyney 23.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Now, if you'd like to help, then please give these Magic Pockets to anyone nearby. Be sure to convince them to take it, regardless of what they say.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Magic Pocket|x=3}})

;(Talk to [[Augereau]])
:{{A|vo fdaq001 9 augereau 01.ogg}} '''Augereau:''' What's this... So you also believe in the prophecy? Hehe, keep it, I won't have any use for it.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? You mean you don't believe in the prophecy?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 9 augereau 02.ogg}} '''Augereau:''' No, no, I believe in the prophecy, but I also believe in another story.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 9 augereau 03.ogg}} '''Augereau:''' The story says that people once lived in the ocean. They were one with the ocean and couldn't live apart from it.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 9 augereau 04.ogg}} '''Augereau:''' But as time wore on, people desired to live on land and developed blood vessels, encapsulating the sea within their bodies. Thus could people set foot on land.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 9 augereau 05.ogg}} '''Augereau:''' So if you ask me, when the water rises and takes us all, it'll be like we're going home.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, we hadn't heard that one before... But, people can't live underwater, they'll die... You should probably still take it.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 9 augereau 06.ogg}} '''Augereau:''' Ah, alright, I'll take it. I guess I just feel that being "dissolved into the water" doesn't necessarily mean death.

;(Talk to Augereau again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq001 augereau 01.ogg}} '''Augereau:''' What do you think? Pretty interesting story, huh?

;(Talk to Etienne)
:{{A|vo fdaq001 7 antoine 01.ogg}} '''Etienne:''' So you're the {{MC|m=blond|f=blonde}} Traveler that everyone's been talking about. My apologies for not recognizing you earlier.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 7 antoine 02.ogg}} '''Etienne:''' Oh, a Magic Pocket...? Seems you really thought of everything. I guess it's better to prepare for the worst and hope for the best...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 7 antoine 03.ogg}} '''Etienne:''' Thanks. Please also thank the magician on my behalf when you get the chance.

;(Talk to Etienne again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq001 antoine 02.ogg}} '''Etienne:''' But where would I move to? Snezhnaya? Liyue?

;(Talk to [[Galathee]])
:{{A|vo fdaq001 8 galathee 01.ogg}} '''Galathee:''' Huh? Ah, I don't want that thing. Way I see it, if the prophecy's true, it's still gonna be a long time before the water can cover everything.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 8 galathee 02.ogg}} '''Galathee:''' Life is all about living in the moment. What use is there in worrying about the future all the time? We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You should still take it, you never know when it will come in handy.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 8 galathee 03.ogg}} '''Galathee:''' Oh, alright... fine. Thanks. It's just that... if I start moving, that means I've already given up on the life I have now. I'd really rather not...

;(Talk to Galathee again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq001 galathee 01.ogg}} '''Galathee:''' I really can't imagine what it would be like if things changed...

;(Approach Lyney and Lynette)
:{{A|vo fdaq001 13 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Oh? You already handed out all of the Magic Pockets? That was fast. So, what did people have to say? I bet you heard some, ah, interesting opinions...
:{{DIcon}} No kidding...
:{{DIcon}} Many are quite stubborn.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 13 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Yes, but that will change once disaster strikes. I know they'll change their minds, so it's only right to help them prepare.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 13 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is there anything else you need to do before we leave?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 13 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Yes, one last thing. I have the Magic Pockets made by a workshop in the Court of Fontaine. Since we're out and about, I was thinking about bringing him some more materials.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 13 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you want to collect materials? Just tell us what the materials look like and we'll help. Many hands make light work!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 13 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Ah, that would be much appreciated. We'll need some [[Romaritime Flower]]s, I remember seeing them near the waterfront on the east side of the harbor.

;(Approach the flowers)
:{{A|vo fdaq001 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It seems we have to use Hydro to collect Romaritime Flowers.

;(Talk to Lyney or Lynette after collecting three [[Fibery Romaritime Flowers]])
:{{A|vo fdaq001 15 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You made quick work of that, I can tell you're an experienced traveler. I've also finished collecting a few here.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 15 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Maybe next time you'll feel like helping too, Lynette.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 15 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' No way. I'm in power-saving mode today. Otherwise, I fear I may not have any energy left for the performance at the opera house.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 15 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' *sigh* Fine, though the performance is still a long way off. Now that we're finished here, we should get ready to head back to the [[Court of Fontaine]].
:{{A|vo fdaq001 15 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So we're going to the Court of Fontaine before we head to the opera house? Good, Paimon wants a tour of Fontaine's largest city and try&mdash;
:{{A|vo fdaq001 15 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Wait... Shh! Have you noticed that person over there? The young girl...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 15 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What's wrong with her? Paimon didn't notice anything.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 15 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Heh, she's obviously a thief.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 15 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Magicians and thieves practice similar methods. We divert attention, and a distracted audience is one that won't discover what you're really doing.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 15 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Watch her movements carefully...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 15 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, he's right!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 15 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Shh! Keep your voice down... We need to think of a way to catch her, but it seems she's very alert. Perhaps we should split up.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 15 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You two can ride the lift over there and wait up top. I bet that'll be her escape route if she tries to run.
:{{DIcon}} Understood.
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 15 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Alright, let's go.

;(Approach the marked location near the top of the lift)
:{{A|vo fdaq001 16 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This is the spot where Lyney wanted us to wait.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 16 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, look! Isn't that her!?
:{{DIcon}} Get ready to stop her!
:{{DIcon}} Time to make the arrest!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 16 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no, did she notice us? She started running the other direction!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 16 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What should we do? Should we chase her?
:{{DIcon}} Our job is to block this path.
:{{DIcon}} The rest is up to Lyney.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 16 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, you're right. She might also be trying to lure us away.
:{{Black Screen|You wait, but there's no sign of the thief...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq001 16 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nothing's happened for a while now. Paimon wonders if Lyney caught the thief...
:{{DIcon}} Seems there's no reason for us to stay here.
:{{DIcon}} Let's go find Lyney.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 16 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, let's go.

;(Approach Lyney, Lynette, and [[Lectoure|the sailor]])
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Are you sure that's all she took? You should check to make sure you're not missing anything else.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 lectoure 01.ogg}} '''Lectoure:''' No, that was all. I can't thank you enough, I didn't notice a thing earlier.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 lectoure 02.ogg}} '''Lectoure:''' Anyway, I should be going now. Thanks again.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, were you returning what the thief had stolen?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That's right, pity I wasn't able to catch her. She distracted me by dropping the things she stole on the ground. By the time I looked back, she was already gone.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I saw the general direction she went, but Lyney twisted his ankle, and I needed to make sure he was okay.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? Did you get hurt, Lyney?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I'll be alright. It's just a twisted ankle, that's all. In fact, it's feeling better already.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' If you want to play at being a hero, at least try not to get hurt doing it. Imagine what would happen if you managed to derail our performance as a result.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Haha... You're right, you're right! Sorry, Lynette.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' *sigh* I have to admit, that thief was even more skilled than I had anticipated.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But at least we were able to get the stolen items back, so it wasn't a complete failure.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What a slippery little thief... Guess things turned out alright in the end though. Lyney's initiative paid off!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Alright, let's put this little detour behind us. We should go to the Court of Fontaine now.

;(Approach the aquabus platform)
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So we ride this thing to go into the city? What an ingenious way to get around... People in Fontaine really know how to use water.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' This is an "aquabus." It allows people to travel between several key locations around Fontaine.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' It's pretty convenient, but the ride can become a little dull after a while... the scenery is always the same. That's why it's better to travel with friends.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' So you mean it's still boring even when I'm riding with you?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Ah, no, that's not what I meant. It's just that, uh... Well, you don't really talk that much.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Besides, it doesn't really feel like a real trip when it's just the two of us. It's the same as being at home, haha.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Whatever.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess that's what it's like to be an older brother...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 17 lyney 12.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hehe, it's about time for us to leave. Let's get onboard.
:;(The four board the aquabus, but just as it's about to pull out of the station, a running young woman boards just in time. She stops to catch her breath before noticing the other passengers.)

;(If the player has not met [[Charlotte]])
::{{A|vo fdaq001 18 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Oh! Excuse me, aren't you Great Magician Lyney? And his assistant Lynette!
::{{A|vo fdaq001 18 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hello, I don't believe we've&mdash;
::{{A|vo fdaq001 18 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I'm Charlotte, a reporter for [[The Steambird]].
::{{A|vo fdaq001 18 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Nice to meet you. From The Steambird, huh? We've often relied on your paper to promote our performances.
::{{A|vo fdaq001 18 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' It's an honor to meet you.
::{{A|vo fdaq001 18 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Wait, could that be the legendary traveler who's been making headline after headline in their journey across Teyvat?
::{{DIcon}} Uh, I guess you could say that.
::{{A|vo fdaq001 18 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Amazing, you recognized everybody almost immediately.
::{{A|vo fdaq001 18 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Hehe, I wouldn't be much of a reporter if I didn't know who's who, would I?
::{{A|vo fdaq001 18 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Wow, today must be my day. Who knew I would end up on the same boat as so many VIPs? Could my Vision finally be showing me some favor?
::{{A|vo fdaq001 18 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So Charlotte, what do you usually report on?
::{{A|vo fdaq001 18 charlotte 06.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Well, when there isn't any breaking news, I mainly cover the trials at the opera house...
;:{{A|vo fdaq001 18 charlotte 07.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' You can still manage to keep readers' attention as long as you tell things from a clever enough angle, even if it's the same old topics.
::{{A|vo fdaq001 18 charlotte 08.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' For example, reporting on how a scammer once deceived vulnerable girls into relationships, or how a financial criminal was once so poor that they ate a single piece of bread for five days...
::{{DIcon}} That... would definitely get my attention.
::{{DIcon}} Even I want to read those now...
::{{A|vo fdaq001 18 charlotte 09.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' That's fine and all, but what I'm really after is exclusive, sensational news pieces that could shake the country. These smaller stories are a waste of my talents.
;(If the player [[Commence! A Suspect Genesis|has met]] Charlotte)
::{{A|vo fdaq001 19 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!?
::{{A|vo fdaq001 19 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Whaaaat?
::{{A|vo fdaq001 19 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' {{Traveler}}? Paimon?
::{{A|vo fdaq001 19 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Charlotte!
::{{DIcon}} It's Charlotte!
::{{A|vo fdaq001 19 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I never guessed I'd bump into you while riding the aquabus. In the story of my life, this is big news!
::{{A|vo fdaq001 19 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' What are you doing in Fontaine? I didn't hear anything about you paying us a visit.
::{{A|vo fdaq001 19 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, it's quite the coincidence! But as Travelers, we're always on the move. It's not surprising that nobody knew we were coming.
::{{A|vo fdaq001 19 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, though we still have no idea how the Hydro Archon knew about us... Oh! Let Paimon introduce you to our new friends!
::{{A|vo fdaq001 19 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Oh, no need for introductions, Paimon. I would recognize the Great Magician Lyney and his assistant Lynette anywhere.
::{{A|vo fdaq001 19 charlotte 06.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I wouldn't be much of a reporter if I didn't know who they were. It's a pleasure to meet you! I'm Charlotte, a reporter for The Steambird.
::{{A|vo fdaq001 19 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Nice to meet you. From The Steambird, huh? We've often relied on your paper to promote our performances.
::{{A|vo fdaq001 19 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' It's an honor to meet you.
::{{A|vo fdaq001 19 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, now that everyone knows each other, Fontaine suddenly doesn't feel like such an unfamiliar place.
::{{A|vo fdaq001 19 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, what have you been up to lately, Charlotte? Any big news?
::{{A|vo fdaq001 19 charlotte 07.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Not too much... when there isn't any breaking news, I mainly cover the trials at the opera house...
::{{A|vo fdaq001 19 charlotte 08.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' You can still manage to keep readers' attention as long as you tell things from a clever enough angle, even if it's the same old topics.
::{{A|vo fdaq001 19 charlotte 09.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' For example, reporting on how a scammer once deceived vulnerable girls into relationships, or how a financial criminal was once so poor that they ate a single piece of bread for five days...
::{{DIcon}} That... would definitely get my attention.
::{{DIcon}} But that's not really the kind of news you're after.
::{{A|vo fdaq001 19 charlotte 10.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' *sigh* You're right, seems you know me pretty well. What I'm really after is exclusive, sensational news pieces that could shake the country. These smaller stories are a waste of my talents.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 20 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Oh, I just remembered... I've been following a case lately... well, a series of cases, actually...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 20 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' You mean the "serial disappearances of young women" case?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 20 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' That's right. These stories are the talk of the town right now, and it's probably the most mysterious case we've ever seen.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 20 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' If I'm the first with a draft ready to publish when the case is finally cracked, and it's the headline story in The Steambird...
:{{A|vo fdaq001 20 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' When that happens, I bet all the other reporters will shed tears of envy. I've already gathered all kinds of materials, I just can't wait for the truth to be revealed.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 20 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So what is the "serial disappearances of young women" case? You mean the culprit hasn't been found?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 20 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' That's right. The first missing girl case happened almost twenty years ago.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 20 charlotte 06.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' And ever since, after a period of time, another girl disappears. What the cases have in common is that the girls are all of a similar age, and that they've all vanished without a trace.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 20 charlotte 07.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' But the scariest part is that to this day, none of the girls have ever been found.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 20 charlotte 08.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Many suspects have been arrested over the years in connection with this case. But shortly after each arrest, another disappearance would always happen.
:{{DIcon}} Then there must be more than one criminal at work.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe there are copycat criminals?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 20 charlotte 09.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Yes, it's possible. But either way, I believe that every case has some precise truth behind it, waiting to be exposed.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 20 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Yes, I agree. And at the very least, the families of those missing girls deserve some sort of explanation.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 20 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I just imagined for a second what I would do if Lynette were to suddenly disappear... I'd pay any price to get her back and then find a way to track down the culprit.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 20 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Please don't imagine that, Lyney.
:{{Black Screen|You continue talking on the aquabus, and before you know it, you are arriving at your destination.}}
:{{A|vo fdaq001 21 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm? Hey, we're almost there. Look!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 21 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Well, I really enjoyed chatting with you. Life should be full of pleasant little surprises like this.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 21 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, us as well! The ride went by too quickly.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 21 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Ah! I have an interview to get to. I should get going before I'm late.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 21 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, Paimon hopes we can chat again soon, Charlotte. See ya!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 21 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Hehe, bye now. Be sure to stop by and see me at The Steambird when you have time!
:{{A|vo fdaq001 21 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What a tough job... always running around and interviewing everyone. Well, where should we go now?
:{{A|vo fdaq001 21 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' If you don't mind, how about we stop by my home first? Besides, I still have all the materials we collected.
:{{A|vo fdaq001 21 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure, we wouldn't mind at all. This city is so huge, Paimon wouldn't know where to start anyway.
:;(The four walk out of the ground floor of the aquabus station, arriving at the fountain in [[Court of Fontaine: Vasari Passage]].)
