Initially only a handful of small islands, the '''Golden Apple Archipelago''' turns out to be a cluster of multiple mountainous islands after completing [[Summer Vacation: Proceed With Caution]].

If the player did not participate in the [[Midsummer Island Adventure]] event, they can finish the [[Summer Gift]] quest to receive the [[Wind-Blessed Harpastum]] to complete the various puzzles.

The requirements to unlock the Golden Archipelago is:
* Complete [[Klee]]'s [[Story Quest]] "[[Trifolium Chapter]]: Act I - [[True Treasure]]".
* Complete the [[Archon Quest]] "[[Prologue]]: Act III - [[Song of the Dragon and Freedom]]".
* Start the [[Event Quest]] "[[Mysterious Islands: Journey to the Unknown]]" (during [[Midsummer Island Adventure]]).

==Subareas==
Once unlocked, the archipelago can be accessed in the [[Map]] via the Map Tabs, alongside the [[Teyvat]] map and [[Serenitea Pot]] map. Upon zooming out, the names of the four subareas will appear:
* [[Pudding Isle/1.6|Pudding Isle]]
* [[Twinning Isle/1.6|Twinning Isle]]
* [[Broken Isle/1.6|Broken Isle]]
* [[Minacious Isle/1.6|Minacious Isle]]

In Part I, each Isle has 1 [[Teleport Waypoint]] and 1 [[Waverider Waypoint]]. The player starts on Pudding Isle. One can follow the [[Glimmering Beacon]]s to unlock the Teleport Waypoints in a "counterclockwise" fashion, heading north to Twinning Isle, then west to Broken Isle, then south to Minacious Isle. However, it's easier to click "Navigate" on the locked teleport waypoints and go directly towards them from there, in whichever order you wish.

Initially, the entire archipelago is filled with dense [[fog]]. However, after unlocking the four [[Teleport Waypoints]], the fog lifts, turning bright during the day. The sun glows gold like an apple in the sky, revealing the tropical backdrop of the archipelago. The background [[music]] will also change into a relaxing tropical theme.

In Part II, some more islands (like the [[Central Platform]]) emerged along with new Waypoints. [[Sea Ganoderma]] appeared as well. Fog and fog-like conditions appear in certain parts of the archipelago, mostly tied to World Quests.

After completing [[Dodo-King of the Sea: Lying in Wait]], the player can challenge the [[Maguu Kenki]] at the Central Platform, similarly to the other [[Bosses|Normal Bosses]].

*[[Wind-Blessed Harpastum]]: Used to break Dodo-King's Painted Walls and activate Hymnal Rings
