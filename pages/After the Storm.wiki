==Steps==
# Talk to [[Wagner]]
# Go and check for crystal ore in [[Stormterror's Lair]] (0/3)
## Each of these spots the player has to check has 4 [[Crystal Chunk]] nodes.
# Give the Crystal Chunks to Wagner

==Gameplay Notes==
* The three spots will still count even if the ores are not present due to a player having mined them before starting the quest.

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|After [[Dvalin]] was cleansed, access to Stormterror's Lair has been restored. [[Wagner]] would like to go there to look for precious Crystal Ore...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Wagner)
:'''Wagner:''' Traveler, do you have a moment?
:{{DIcon}} What is it?
:'''Wagner:''' Have you heard of Stormterror's Lair? It's those ruins outside Mondstadt.
:'''Wagner:''' While Stormterror made the place his home, it was shrouded in a whirling, impassable storm. No one could pass through, so the precious crystal ore in there hasn't been mined.
:'''Wagner:''' I've heard people say that the storm around the area has disappeared. That should have been a prime moment to go for the ore veins...
:'''Wagner:''' ...But with so many places in the city needing repairs, our smithy's services are in high demand. Schulz can't hold the fort down alone either, so I can't leave.
:'''Wagner:''' What say you go have a look, Traveler? If you find any crystal ore, bring some back with you.
:{{DIcon}} I'm on the case.
::'''Wagner:''' My thanks. These crystal ores should help in forging and in restoring the city as well...
:{{DIcon}} I have other things to do...
::'''Wagner:''' That's no issue. We aren't in a rush. When I have time, I'll check it out myself.
:;(Cancel quest)

----

;(Talk to Wagner before collecting the ore)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} So, about the ores...
:'''Wagner:''' There's still much work to be done. I need to put my back into it...

----

;(At the first location)
:'''Paimon:''' So there are crystals here! Wagner will be pleased.
;(At the second location)
:'''Paimon:''' There's some over here too. Wowee, there's so many of them!
;(At the third location)
:'''Paimon:''' There's a ton of crystal here... Let's mine some and take them back to Wagner.

----

;(Talk to Wagner)
:'''Wagner:''' So, did you manage to mine any ore?
:{{DIcon}} I have it right here.
:'''Wagner:''' Let me see. Huh. These crystal ores actually don't look half bad.
:'''Wagner:''' Here's your payment. Take it for your trouble.
:'''Wagner:''' So, this means that the storm around Stormterror's Lair has indeed dispersed. I should make time to go there myself soon...
