'''Vanarana Nursery''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a small garden located in a cave on the west end of Vanarana. It is tended to by [[Aranakula]] and [[Arakara]], who work hard to grow "happy [[Viparyas]]."

Arakara can always be found in the nursery, but Aranakula will only return after the [[Traveler]] helps restore the [[Varuna Contraption]] in ''[[A Prayer for Rain on the Fecund Land]]''.{{verify}} After completing ''[[Giving Flowers]]'', [[Varsha]] can be found at the nursery in the "real" Vanarana.

After completing ''[[The Viparyas of Vanarana]]'', all 13 Viparyas in the garden can be harvested and will respawn every 3 days. In the "real" version of Vanarana, the Viparyas will be replaced with [[Sweet Flower]]s. Harvesting the Viparyas will not cause the Sweet Flowers to disappear, and vice versa.
