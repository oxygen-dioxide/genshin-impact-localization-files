===Daytime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hakan:''' What can I do for you?
:'''Hakan:''' Sorry, I was dozing off and didn't notice you.
:{{DIcon}} Are you that tired?
::'''Hakan:''' Not so much tired as bored.
::'''Hakan:''' Don't you think it's easier to fall sleep in noisy places like a theater or market?
::'''Hakan:''' There's no one from the [[Akademiya]] around the theater, anyway, so I'm not under watch.
::'''Hakan:''' When [[Azra]] isn't asking me to run after [[Swoof]], and no students insist on taking pictures with [[Nilou]], dozing off is all I've got left.
:{{DIcon}} Excuse me.
::'''Hakan:''' See you.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hakan:''' Ah! If it isn't Lemta! The last time I saw you in the city... Um... Well, I believe I've never seen you in the city before.
:'''[[Lemta]]:''' Yeah. I came this time with an adventurer who paid me to protect her.
:'''Lemta:''' My original plan was to leave after we've registered at the [[Adventurers' Guild]], but she became obsessed with shopping halfway...
:'''Lemta:''' I've spent days with her in the [[Grand Bazaar]]... And I have a feeling that this isn't gonna end soon.
:'''Hakan:''' Wow, you're not exaggerating, are you?
:'''Lemta:''' Nope. I guess it has to do with her being a foreigner, so anything here could pique her interest easily. Every day, she shops until the sun sets. And as her bodyguard, I can't leave her alone.
:'''Hakan:''' Wow, that sounds terrible. You've never been a fan of the fancy stuff at the market. I guess you must be so bored right now.
:'''Hakan:''' Why don't you quit the job and join the [[Corps of Thirty]]?
:'''Hakan:''' We only work for the Akademiya. It's a stable job with much to earn and not so much to be done. This is far better than taking gigs in small gangs.
:'''Lemta:''' I'll pass. The fact that even you are saying there's "not much to be done" means only one thing: What the job involves is eating, drinking, sleeping, and nothing more.
:'''Hakan:''' Haha! You sure know me very well.
