|description     = It's hard to say if the unorthodox, non-full-moon shape is meant to flout tradition or express her "tooth for a tooth" ethos. A rich, savory, and smoky flavor emanates from beneath the golden outer crust, unlikely to be reproducible by anybody else in Mondstadt. Best not to tell her all this, though, lest she add it to her list of personal vendettas.

==Trivia==
* {{Mail Attachments by Category List}}
* Currently, this is the only special food item to be of 4-star rarity or above.
* Stormcrest Pies have been used as field rations for the Reconnaissance Company of the [[Knights of Favonius]] (of which Eula is the captain).<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Receiver of Friends From Afar: Part IV}}</ref>

===Etymology===
* The word "crest" in Stormcrest is likely used in the sense of the "top of a wave," considering its Chinese name (see below).
* The original Chinese name of the dish, {{zh|s=骇浪派|t=駭浪派|rm=Hàilàng Pài}}, translates to the "Terrifying Wave Pie." It corresponds to Eula's title Spindrift Knight ({{zh|浪花骑士}}), which literally means the "Knight of Wave Flowers" in Chinese.
* The German version uses the term {{w|calzone}}, an Italian turnover.
* The Spanish version uses the term {{w|empanada}}, a type of baked or fried turnover probably originating from Galicia.
