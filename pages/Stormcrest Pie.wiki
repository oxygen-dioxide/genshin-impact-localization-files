|description     = It's hard to say if the fang-like crescent shape is meant to flout tradition or express her "tooth for tooth" ethos. A salty, fresh, smoked flavor emanates from under the golden outer crust, its body and intensity likely unmatched by anyone else in Mondstadt. Best not to tell her that, though, lest she "remember" it.

==Trivia==
* Currently, this is the only special food item to be of 4-star rarity or above.
* The following birthday mails included Stormcrest Pie:
**[[Mail/The Day of My Birth... (2021-10-25)|Eula's 2021 Birthday Mail]] (1 Stormcrest Pie)
**[[Mail/Relaxing Moment... (2022-10-25)|Eula's 2022 Birthday Mail]] (1 Stormcrest Pie)
*The word "crest" in Stormcrest is likely used in the sense of the "top of a wave," considering its Chinese name (see below).
*The original Chinese name of the dish {{Lang|''Hàilàng Pài''|zh=骇浪派}} translates to the "Terrifying Wave Pie." It corresponds to Eula's title Spindrift Knight (浪花骑士), which literally means the "Knight of Wave Flowers" in Chinese.
*The German version uses the term {{w|calzone}}, an Italian turnover.
*The Spanish version uses the term {{w|empanada}}, a type of baked or fried turnover probably originating from Galicia.
