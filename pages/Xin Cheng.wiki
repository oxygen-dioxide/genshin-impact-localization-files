{{Lang|'''Xin Cheng'''|zh=辛程|zh_rm=Xīn Chéng}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in {{Quest|Sea of Clouds, Sea of People}}.

==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Xin Cheng is a pilgrim who is always in search for the [[adepti]], which he believes shall offer him a blessing. He met [[Ganyu]] and the [[Traveler]], believing them as adepti and asks for a blessing. Ganyu reluctantly told him that she is unable to do so as he needs to earn for it. Infuriated, Xin Cheng then proceeds to mock her by calling her a "useless" and leaves, thus giving a conflict over Ganyu by questioning herself.
