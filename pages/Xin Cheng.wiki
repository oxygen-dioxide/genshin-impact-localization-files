He met [[Ganyu]] and the [[Traveler]], believing them as adepti and asks for a blessing. Ganyu reluctantly told him that she is unable to do so as he needs to earn for it. Infuriated, Xin Cheng then proceeds to mock her by calling her a "useless" and leaves, thus giving a conflict over Ganyu by questioning herself.
