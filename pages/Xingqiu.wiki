{{Lang|'''Xingqiu'''|zh=行秋|zh_rm=Xíngqiū}} is a playable [[Hydro]] [[character]] in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''.

He is the second son of the Guild Manager of the [[Feiyun Commerce Guild]], an influential group in [[Liyue]], and is also a self-proclaimed practitioner of the [[Guhua Clan]]'s arts. Also an avid reader, Xingqiu aims to be the embodiment of chivalry like the heroes from the books he reads; however, this belies his knack for mischief.
