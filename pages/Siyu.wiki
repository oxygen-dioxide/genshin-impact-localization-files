==Profile==
Growing up by the sea, Siyu and [[Wrench Wang]] were frequent troublemakers,<ref name=Siyu>{{Ref/NPC|Wrench Wang}}</ref> which ultimately resulted in lectures from the adults. She had dreamed from a young age to marry a 'Prince Charming', and has since fulfilled this dream 2 years ago. At some point, she gave Wrench Wang a handkerchief which the latter still holds dear.

Siyu, now the wife and woman of the house, believes she should be wise with her money to provide for her and her husband, no matter how smooth her husband's business is running, even with the guidance of [[Rex Lapis]].

===Personality===
Wrench Wang, her childhood friend and 'sweetheart', describes her as a fellow troublemaker when they were younger. Wrench Wang had been frequently cheered up by Siyu, commonly telling him "Nothing solves difficult problems like a good night's sleep! Every day has a new horizon!" whenever he felt down. Siyu's encouraging words and radiant smile were key to cheering Wrench Wang up, making Wrench Wang feel "like there was no storm I couldn't weather."

She seems oblivious towards Wrench Wang's feelings towards her, even likening Wrench Wang to a big brother, and questioning why her husband and Wrench Wang don't get along.

===Appearance===
Siyu is a lady of fair height, with dark brown hair tucked in a loose, low bun. She has straight-cut bangs with a slight gap in the middle. Her eyes are of a hazel shade, shaped by thin lashes and thin eyebrows.

Underneath a beige shawl that reaches just below her shoulders, she wears an open traditional cardigan with loose sleeves and a mandarin collar, topped with a pearl necklace. Her cardigan is boardered by a dark blue material, and has three-petaled flower knots. Underneath, she wears a dull baby blue shirt with the bottom carrying two layers of petal-shaped fabrications. She wears a dark dress with a single flower printed and of varying shades of blue and a vibrant beige.

To top off her look, she wears dark blue pumps with small, rounded bows on the front.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Siyu:''' Hi, how can I help you?
:'''Siyu:''' Ah! You distracted me with your chitchat and now I've lost count again.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Siyu:''' Call me Siyu. I grew up by the sea, but I'll never tire of the fresh fish here in the harbor.
::'''Siyu:''' I got married just two years ago, and thanks to the prophetic guidance of the Lord of Geo my husband's business has gone smoothly this whole time.
::'''Siyu:''' So we have money to spare now. But still, as the woman of the house, I should learn to be frugal out of principle.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Siyu:''' Oh, I'm just getting ready to buy some fish.
::'''Siyu:''' After visiting Uncle Gao's stand, I can't help but feel that Uncle Sun's fish are not only cheaper, but more fresh too!
::'''Siyu:''' I think it's the perfect chance to buy a load of fish to make for my husband. I'm just worried I wouldn't be able to move such a load. If only "The Wrench" were here...
::{{DIcon}} "The Wrench"...?
::'''Siyu:''' Yes, haven't you heard of Wrench Wang down in the shipyard? He's known for his great strength. Why, he'd help haul this load and carry me back home on his shoulder.
::'''Siyu:''' He's been good to me as long as I can remember. He would always share any tasty food he had, and he even taught me arithmetic. He's like a brother to me!
::'''Siyu:''' But he doesn't seem very fond of my husband for some odd reason. He's always staring at him.
::'''Siyu:''' *sigh* If only there were some way to help them get along...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Siyu:''' Goodbye...
::'''Siyu:''' Wait? How many did I count just now?
