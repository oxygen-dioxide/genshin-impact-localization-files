'''Pressure Plates'''<ref>Official Interactive Map: [https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=67 Teyvat]</ref> are objects found while [[Exploration|exploring]] the world of [[Teyvat]]. They have various functions once activated, such as spawning [[chests]], opening gates or creating [[Wind Currents]]. All of the locations can be found in the [https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=67 Teyvat Interactive Map].

There are three types of Pressure Plates:
*Small Pressure Plates which require a single weight, which can be activated by placing a light construct or a character on it. Enemies and wildlife standing on them can also activate them.
*Large Pressure Plates which require a double weight, which can be activated by placing a single heavy construct or two light constructs on it.
*Special Pressure Plates found in [[The Chasm]] which require a single weight. Once activated, several markers will be revealed. Touching all the markers will reveal a chest.

Most of the time, large plates require creating a construct to apply the pressure while the player performs another task, while small ones are more often used for immediate actions such as starting a trial or summoning a Wind Current.

==Light Constructs==
The following constructs and creatures are able to activate small pressure plates. They can activate large pressure plates if two are placed on top of it simultaneously.

Note that some of these skills summon multiple of a construct at once, such as [[Klee]]'s [[Jumpy Dumpty]] mines or [[Aloy]]'s [[Frozen Wilds]] Chillwater Bomblets, or may come with multiple charges, such as [[Amber]]'s [[Explosive Puppet]] at her [[It's Not Just Any Doll...|4th Constellation]] or [[Ganyu]]'s [[Trail of the Qilin]] at her [[The Auspicious|2nd Constellation]], which can then be combined to produce enough weight to activate large plates.
