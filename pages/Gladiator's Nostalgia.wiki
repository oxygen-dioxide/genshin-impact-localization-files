{{Description|No one knows why the legendary gladiator wore this flower on his chest. It was the brutal warrior's only weakness.}}
'''Gladiator's Nostalgia''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Gladiator's Finale]].

==Description==
An ordinary flower picked gently by the [[Eberhart|gladiator's master]].<br />He made a brooch with it and pinned it on the gladiator's chest. It came to symbolize his gentler side.

Before the gladiator became a living legend, he once strolled with his young master in the garden.<br />The master picked a flower and gave it to the silent slave.<br />"Not all gifts are given out of benevolence. Sometimes they are nothing more than acts of whimsy."<br />One day in the far-off future, the gladiator's sly master would say these words to him.

The invincible gladiator finally fell at the [[Vennessa|foreign girl]]'s feet.<br />At that moment he recalled a dream he had had many years ago.<br />"Such beautiful flowers, I wonder when I'll be able to begin my own journey to see them."<br />"I'd like to see how beautiful the wild flowers are."
