==Gameplay Notes==
* {{Talent Note|particles|Rebuke: Vaulting Fist|1}}
** Hitting non-enemy objects will also generate particles.
** This particle generation has a cooldown of 2 seconds, which is shared with the particle generation from Normal Attacks during {{Talent|Icefang Rush|type=1|nobr=1|20}}.
* Gracious Rebuke will not be consumed if Rebuke: Vaulting Fist fails to hit an enemy or object.
* Rebuke: Vaulting Fist has a much larger [[AoE]] than the unenhanced Charged Attack.
* The 5-second cooldown only starts after Gracious Rebuke is consumed.
* When Wriothesley obtains Gracious Rebuke, an emblem will appear over him accompanied by a sound cue. While he remains in the Gracious Rebuke state he will emit dark red mist.
