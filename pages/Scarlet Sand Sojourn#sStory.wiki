;(Open the Scroll)
:'''Dehya:''' Good morning, my lady. Did you rest well yesterday? The journey today might be long and arduous.
:'''Dunyarzad:''' I'm ready, let's go!

;(Autoscroll)
:'''Dunyarzad:''' I had no idea the desert would be so breathtaking!
:'''Dunyarzad:''' Whoever grew up here must dream of becoming a grain of unfettered sand, freely riding the desert heat into distant lands.
:'''Dehya:''' That's why a desk job at the [[Akademiya]] isn't for me.

;(Interact with the [[Scarab]])
:'''Dunyarzad:''' What's this? An insect from the desert?
:'''Dehya:''' These little things are called Scarabs and they're really hardworking.
:'''Dehya:''' If a furious sandstorm blows them down a high dune, they'll keep on pushing mud balls up that dune.
:'''Dunyarzad:''' I didn't know these insects were so tenacious.
<!-- Experiences: Scarab -->

;(Interact with the [[Loose Sand Pile]])
:;(Two Dendro Crystalflies fly out from the scattered sand pile)
:'''Dunyarzad:''' Is that a [[Dendro Crystalfly]] buried underneath the sand? But why would they burrow there?
:'''Dehya:''' The harsh desert environment forces creatures here to find their own way of survival. 
:'''Dehya:''' There are not only Crystalflies hiding in the sand, but also [[Fungi]] and [[scorpion]]s. Be careful not to dig up every sand pile out of curiosity.
:'''Dunyarzad:''' Scorpions!? If... if we run into one, I'll be counting on you, Dehya!
<!-- Experiences: Dendro Crystalfly -->

;(Continue until Dunyarzad and Dehya beneath the [[Athel Wood|Athel Trees]])
:'''Dehya:''' My lady, if you're exhausted, why don't you ride a Sumpter Beast and admire the view?
:;(Dunyarzad mounts the Sumpter Beast)
:'''Dunyarzad:''' You should take a break too, Dehya.
:'''Dehya:''' Don't worry about me. I enjoy the feeling of walking on the sand.
<!-- Experiences: Desert Sumpter Beast -->

;(Continue until Dehya stops at the oasis camp)
:'''Dunyarzad:''' I didn't expect to find such a beautiful oasis in the desert! I bet it would make for a great place to set up camp.
:'''Dehya:''' Let me light the campfire first.
:;(Dehya lights the campfire and they both sit on a log by the fire)
:'''Dunyarzad:''' I never imagined that I'd be able to experience these sights that I had only seen in books.
:'''Dehya:''' There's something about a real landscape that a picture book just can't capture.
:'''Dehya:''' It's getting late. Let's rest up over here.
<!-- Experiences: Thamud Oasis -->
:;(The night passes)
:'''Dehya:''' Good morning, my lady. I'm just about done with packing, so we can return to Aaru Village.
:'''Dunyarzad:''' Thank you, Dehya. This trip to the desert has been unforgettable.
:'''Dehya:''' You are welcome. Let's go and visit other places together sometime!
:;(They return to Aaru Village)
:'''Dehya:''' I've got an errand to run in Sumeru City. Would you like to join me on the way back? You must be exhausted from all that trekking in the desert, though.
:'''Dunyarzad:''' Don't worry about me. I'll stay here for now.
:'''Dunyarzad:''' I've heard that you've been quietly giving to the homeless children in the desert. Is that the errand that you speak of?
:'''Dunyarzad:''' This is something that I hope will help out. And these are gifts for them. Please take them with you.
:'''Dehya:''' If... If you insist. Thank you very much. I'm sure they'll appreciate it!
:'''Dunyarzad:''' You'd better get going. Safe travels!
:;(Scene transitions to Dehya at [[Lambad's Tavern]])
:'''Dehya:''' Heh... it's been quite a journey.
