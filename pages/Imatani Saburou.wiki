===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing [[Dreamlike Timelessness]].''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Imatani Saburou:''' Hello, are you here to visit our village?
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
::'''Imatani Saburou:''' You must be an outlander, right? An outlander is a guest here. If you are not in a hurry, why don't you come on in, drink some tea, and take a break?
::'''Imatani Saburou:''' Konda Village is a very nice place. Its environment is beautiful and quiet. It's a very suitable place to reside.
::'''Imatani Saburou:''' My wife and I have been living here for decades. I still like this place.
::{{DIcon}} It is indeed a fine place.
:::'''Imatani Saburou:''' Indeed. When she and I traveled here for the first time, we knew that we would settle down here.
:::'''Imatani Saburou:''' We plant fruits, grow flowers, and weave. It's a peaceful life, yet it is not boring at all. Once we had some children, it got even more bustling.
:::'''Imatani Saburou:''' It sounds a bit too carefree, right? But it's not a bad thing to be carefree. You don't have to live a busy life traveling around to have a fulfilling life.
::{{DIcon}} Have you heard of any weird happenings recently?
:::'''Imatani Saburou:''' I remember hearing some talk about some urban legends, but I've never been a fan of these topics, so I don't really know anything useful.
:::'''Imatani Saburou:''' Well, it's not always a good thing to know more. The more news you hear, the more bothered you will be. After a while, even a happy life will be beyond your reach.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Imatani Saburou:''' Come back soon. This is a good place.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing [[Dreamlike Timelessness]].''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Imatani Saburou:''' Hey, aren't you [[Yoimiya]]'s friend? Come on in!
:{{DIcon}} I'm here to visit you.
::'''Imatani Saburou:''' Thank you. I didn't expect you to still remember me.
::'''Imatani Saburou:''' I still have some snacks available at home, so let's dig in. They were sent by Yoimiya.
::'''Imatani Saburou:''' There's just too much. My wife and I can't finish them all.
:{{DIcon}} How is Keisuke doing?
::'''Imatani Saburou:''' He came home once. He told us that he finally resolved his differences with [[Sakujirou]]. As for how it got resolved and where Sakujirou went, he didn't tell me.
::'''Imatani Saburou:''' But as long as the matter is settled, I'm fine with it. My wife and I are happy for him.
::'''Imatani Saburou:''' Many lost things can be retrieved, but you can only have so many childhood friends. There's no getting them back once you've lost them.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
:: Take care. Stay happy.
