'''Heart of the Scales''' is [[Cyno]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Cyno's clothes appear to be inspired by traditional outfits that were worn during the Ancient Egyptian civilization. His headpiece resembles the head of Anubis, a jackal-headed deity, also known as the God of the dead, mummification, and weigher of souls. The kilt-like garment he wears is reminiscent of the Shendyt, which was a popular men's clothing, usually depicted on Ancient Egyptian commoners, rulers and even deities. For his footwear, he wears stirrups that connect to toe rings that leave his heels and toes exposed. His {{Electro}} [[Vision]] is attached to his belt.
