==Descriptions==
{{Description|The fruit of a forest shrub. Its flesh is firm and sweet. It is said to have a calming effect on the mind.<br>In the past, Zaytun Peaches were once used as ornamental plants due to their cute appearance. However, its medical properties were discovered over time, and it has now become a very common commercial product, ironically very seldom noticed for its aesthetic value.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* {{Mail Attachments by Category List}}
* In order to eat Zaytun Peaches in the desert without them going bad along the journey, they must be purchased unripe, spiced, and kept in a wine barrel. This gives Zaytun Peaches eaten in [[Aaru Village]] a unique, crisp flavor.<ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|The Crisp Sweetness}}</ref>
* {{Related Items|type=variant}}
* Zaytun Peach is likely based on a {{w|Syzygium samarangense|java apple}}.

===Etymology===
* Zaytun is {{Lang|Arabic for "olive"|ar=زيتون|ar_rm=zaytūn}}.
