==Descriptions==
{{Description|Bluish, juicy berries that grow in large amounts near the Scions of the Canopy. Their shape is similar to that of Flamegranates.<br>Picking Quenepa Berries is not anywhere near as dangerous as harvesting Flamegranates, though beginners are often unable to distinguish between these berries and unripe Flamegranates.<br>Some believe that long ago, there lived a [[Ahpub|brother]] and [[Ixquieh|sister]] with completely different personalities. Separated at a young age and raised by different tribes, they eventually died fighting one another. The hot-tempered brother transformed into the Flamegranate, while the calm, unflappable sister became the Quenepa Berry.|[[Archive]]}}
