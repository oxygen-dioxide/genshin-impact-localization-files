{{Description|The time of the adepti has long passed. If even the Liyue Qixing don't want to face that truth, then what future is there for Liyue?|[[Keqing]]|when the [[Traveler]] first meets her}}
The {{Lang|'''Liyue Qixing'''|zh=璃月七星|zh_rm=Líyuè Qīxīng|zh_tl=Seven Stars of Liyue}} is a committee made up of seven merchants and business leaders who govern [[Liyue]],<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Qixing}}</ref> specializing within the commerce and trade sectors. The job of the Qixing is to implement the policies laid out by the [[Geo]] [[God|Archon]] [[Morax]] and manage the day to day governance of the region of Liyue.

Every year, one of the Qixing is selected to perform the [[Rite of Descension]]. During this ritual, the Geo Archon appears before the populace in his dragon–qilin form and gives predictions that shape the business trends within Liyue for that year.

==History==
{{Quote|The people of Liyue turned to commerce and artisanship for their livelihood, and prospered once more. Those who prospered above the rest joined, calling themselves the Qixing. Thus was formed the framework around which Liyue Harbor developed. Under the jurisdiction of the Qixing were all the known trades, no business of Liyue took place inside or outside the nation that was not known unto them.|the historian Zichang|in Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I}}
The Liyue Qixing was formed roughly 2,000 years ago, following the end of the [[Archon War]].<ref name="GanyuStoryVision">{{Ref/CS|Ganyu|Vision}}</ref> With the savage fighting between gods concluded, commerce and artisanship flourished, and those seven who prospered above all others joined to form the Qixing.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I}}</ref> After aiding Morax throughout the Archon War, the half qilin [[Ganyu]] chose to remain in Liyue to help the humans build a new government. She took up the post as the organization's secretary, working alongside its changing roster for centuries.<ref name="GanyuStoryVision" />

Following Rex Lapis' apparent death, the Liyue Qixing quickly acted to consolidate their position and fill the power vacuum the god had left. Having learned through a secret message that the Archon was not dead but instead had relinquished his post, the Qixing announced to the people that he had passed in a trial and took up the governance of the region without divine guidance.<ref name="FondFarewell">{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref> In taking charge of Liyue, all of the Geo Archon's previous duties fell to the Liyue Qixing and the Eight Trades. With the end of divine rule, the Qixing began the task of reevaluating the old strictures and establishing new laws.<ref name="KeqingStory4">{{Ref/CS|Keqing|4}}</ref> They also had to address the fallout of the events surrounding Rex Lapis' "death", including relations with the [[Snezhnaya]]n [[Fatui]] diplomats and the cessation of [[Mora]] production at the [[Golden House]].<ref name="FondFarewell" />

==Responsibilities==
{{Quote|They are responsible for implementing the policy that comes down from Rex Lapis and making rulings on important matters. They are akin to the hands and feet of Rex Lapis.|[[Huixin]]}}
The role of the Qixing is to uphold the laws laid down by the Geo Archon<ref name="ZhongliStory4">{{Ref/CS|Zhongli|4}}</ref> and attend to day-to-day affairs in Liyue harbor of all magnitudes.<ref name="KeqingStoryCD">{{Ref/CS|Keqing|Character Details}}</ref> They are considered "the hands and feet of Rex Lapis".<ref name="Huixin">{{Ref/NPC|Huixin}}</ref> Each year, one of their number is chosen to preside over the Rite of Descension, in which Rex Lapis appears before the people of Liyue Harbor and delivers predictions that determine the course of business for the next year.<ref name="RiteOfDescension">{{Ref/Quest|Rite of Descension}}</ref> Both the [[Ministry of Civil Affairs]]<ref name="ClerkZhao">{{Ref/NPC|Clerk Zhao}}</ref> and the [[Millelith]], Liyue's security officers,<ref name="CaiXun">{{Ref/NPC|Cai Xun}}</ref> report to the Qixing. Additionally, the [[Eight Trades]], which represent the major industries in Liyue, are under the jurisdiction of the Qixing.<ref name="SweetSalt">{{Ref/Quest|Farewell, Sweet Salt}}</ref>

The members of the Qixing are the seven leaders of the seven enterprises of Liyue.<ref name="RiteOfDescension" /> Considered "the cream of the crop,"<ref name="GanyuStoryCD">{{Ref/CS|Ganyu|Character Details}}</ref> all are highly accomplished in their own fields and are the pillars of Liyue's prosperity.<ref name="Huixin" /> Their highly revered positions are coveted by many,<ref name="NingguangStory1">{{Ref/CS|Ningguang|1}}</ref> and some have many enemies. The current Tianshu, [[Uncle Tian]], has consolidated his position for years through a strategy of pitting his enemies against each other.<ref name="Secretary">{{Ref/Quest|A Secretary in a Sea of Humanity}}</ref> Most members of the Qixing choose to play things safe and keep a low profile while carrying out their work. The current Tianquan, [[Ningguang]], is a notable exception and is frequently seen around Liyue Harbor, making her the subject of much talk.<ref name="NingguangStoryCD">{{Ref/CS|Ningguang|Character Details}}</ref>

Each of the Qixing are equal in rank<ref name="Secretary" /> and there is a clear internal division of labor within the Liyue Qixing's duties.<ref name="Huixin" /> The Tianquan is responsible for maintaining the book of ancient laws laid out by Morax and all subsequent amendments. Each Tianquan has introduced amendments to ensure the laws align with Liyue's current societal needs.<ref name="NingguangStory4">{{Ref/CS|Ningguang|4}}</ref> The Yuheng is in charge of land, livelihood management,<ref name="Hongyi">{{Ref/NPC|Hongyi}}</ref> construction, and real estate,<ref name="KeqingWork">{{Ref/VO|Keqing|About Keqing: Work}}</ref> The role requires strict regulation and developmental direction<ref name="Huixin" /> and is subject to over a hundred contractual obligations.<ref name="AboutKeqingI">{{Ref/VO|Keqing|More About Keqing: I}}</ref> While each member has their own specialty, their roles can overlap. For example, while livelihood management matters such as water supply quality fall under the domain of the Yuheng, the Urban Areas Sanitation Act, addressing sabotage of water sources, was amended by the Tianquan.<ref name="Hongyi" /> Additionally, while the Tianquan personally maintains the book of laws and amendments,<ref name="ZhongliStory4" /> other members also participate in law-making<ref name="KeqingStory4" /> and the Liyue Qixing as a whole is expected to interpret the law, address loopholes, and punish violators.<ref name="ZhongliStory4" /> Some cultural affairs, such as the [[Moonchase Festival]], are also overseen by the Qixing.<ref name="Moonchase1">{{Ref/Quest|One for the Foodies, Two for the Show}}</ref>

The Liyue Qixing meet at Yuehai Pavilion in Yujing Terrace to discuss official matters.<ref name="Tieshan">{{Ref/NPC|Tieshan}}</ref> Although the day-to-day operations and those who work directly under them are based at Yuehai Pavilion,<ref name="GanyuStoryCD" /> there are days where all seven attend to their business elsewhere.<ref name="Huixin" /> The Yuheng, [[Keqing]], frequently works away from Yuehai Pavilion at places including the south wharf, [[the Chasm]],<ref name="KeqingStory3">{{Ref/CS|Keqing|3}}</ref> and the uninhabited wilderness.<ref name="KeqingStorySH">{{Ref/CS|Keqing|Survival Hairpin}}</ref> Likewise, when seeking a solution to important business matters, Ningguang sequesters herself in her [[Jade Chamber]] until she reaches a decision.<ref name="NingguangStory2">{{Ref/CS|Ningguang|2}}</ref>

==Associates==
{{Quote|I'm always happy to help a junior colleague from Yuehai Pavilion.|Ganyu to Huixin}}
All of the Qixing's decision-making is supported extensively by Ganyu, the General Secretary of Yuehai Pavilion. Behind the scenes, she is responsible for the calculations and data behind all of their policies and decisions. Every ordinance and regulation announced is also the work of Ganyu.<ref name="GanyuStoryCD" /> As general secretary, she is not attached to any one of its leaders, but instead supports the work of the whole organization. She has remained a constant associate to the Liyue Qixing since its inception.<ref name="GanyuStory1">{{Ref/CS|Ganyu|1}}</ref> Some members of the Qixing also have personal secretaries or assistants. Ningguang employs three secretaries, [[Baiwen]], [[Baishi]], and [[Baixiao]], who are her closest and most trusted confidantes and aid her with researching important matters.<ref name="Treat">{{Ref/Quest|Zhongli's Treat}}</ref> The Yuheng also employs assistants, but due to her extreme work ethic and perfectionism, her assistants typically last no more than three months.<ref name="KeqingStory2">{{Ref/CS|Keqing|2}}</ref> Other secretaries, such as [[Huixin]], also work at Yuehai Pavilion. They are junior colleagues to Ganyu and, like her, are not attached to a specific Qixing member.<ref name="Secretary" />

The Qixing founded and secretly runs the [[Wangshu Inn]] as an operation to covertly assist [[Xiao]] in his fight against evil gods, as well as to gather intelligence of any persons-of-interest entering Liyue.<ref name="XiaoStory3">{{Ref/CS|Xiao|3}}</ref> All of the employees of Wangshu Inn are agents of the Qixing, and are among those who act as their eyes and ears, gathering intelligence across the region.<ref name="Equilibrium">{{Ref/Quest|Equilibrium}}</ref> [[The Crux|The Crux Fleet]], an armed merchant fleet led by Captain [[Beidou]], also works closely with the Liyue Qixing, although The Crux is an independent organization and not under the Qixing's direct control. Specifically, Beidou is a close collaborator with the Tianquan and was personally chosen by Ningguang to do her "dirty work."<ref name="BeidouStory3">{{Ref/CS|Beidou|3}}</ref>

===Eight Trades===
{{Main|Eight Trades}}
The [[Eight Trades]] are eight offices that operate the major industrial businesses of Liyue, under the jurisdiction of the Qixing. For example, it includes [[Yinyuan Hall]], a sector that governs the salt industry.<ref name="SweetSalt" />

==Trivia==
* The name "Qixing" {{Lang|zh=七星}} refers to the {{w|Big Dipper}}, and the titles given to each leader are the Chinese names of the constituent seven stars of the constellation. Only five of the Qixing's titles have been mentioned in the game or other official ''Genshin Impact'' material, but the remaining two &mdash; Tianji and Yaoguang &mdash; can be extrapolated from the names of the real stars.
** The {{Lang|Yaoguang|zh=瑶光}} shares its name with the Liyue location [[Yaoguang Shoal]]. However, in the game's lore, Yaoguang Shoal is named not for the Qixing member but the bioluminescent sea creatures that once populated its waters and resembled fallen stars.<ref name="YS">Expedition: [[Yaoguang Shoal]]</ref>
* [[File:Qixing constellation.png|alt=Qixing constellation|thumb]]The Qixing constellation shown in [https://youtu.be/tsPtGG9pFfg Ganyu's Collected Miscellany] looks different from the modern day Earth's view of the Big Dipper.
* The Big Dipper {{Lang|zh=北斗}}, shares its Chinese name with the Liyue character [[Beidou]].
** She is both one of Ningguang's collaborators, and notorious for holding little respect for the Qixing.
** Her ship, the [[Alcor]], is named after one of the stars that make up the handle of the Big Dipper.
* The Chinese pronunciation of Uncle Tian ({{zh|天叔|rm=Tiānshū|lit=Tian Uncle}}) is the same as the star {{zh|天枢|rm=Tiānshū}}. This star is referred to as "the head of the 7 Bei Dou stars" in many Chinese myths and plays a key role in Chinese astrology.
* In Chinese, the name for the Rite of Descension more literally translates to {{Lang|the Qixing's Adeptus Invitation Ceremony|zh=七星请仙典仪|zh_rm=Qīxīng Qǐng-Xiān Diǎnyí}}.
* Although the Liyue Qixing is a human organization, [[Madame Ping]]'s response that "[They] stopped letting my friends and I into their counsel long ago," if the [[Traveler]] asks if she is one of the Qixing suggests that Liyue's adepti worked more closely with the Qixing in the past.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Realm Within}}</ref>
