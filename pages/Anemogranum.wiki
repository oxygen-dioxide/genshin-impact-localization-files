{{Description|Sometimes in the wild you may see a mysterious kind of life form called an Anemogranum. These curious beings will follow travelers around. Gather several Anemograna together to form a wind current.|[[Loading Screen]]: Anemograna}}
'''Anemograna''' are [[Grana]] that appear on the ground in sets of three. Each individual granum appears as a bluish fairy rotating around a very small updraft. The grana can be collected by running into them. The grana will then become attached to the player for a limited time and decrease their [[Stamina]] consumption by 30%, after which it respawns in its original location and must be collected again. If the active character collects all three Anemograna in an area, a Wind Current is created at their current location. Some [[Anemoculus|Anemoculi]] can only be collected using this method, or their collection is made significantly easier by using Anemograna, provided that all of the required Anemograna can be found in time, as some are more hidden.

Anemograna can be found in [[Mondstadt]], including Dragonspine. The Anemograna in Dragonspine have mutated to accommodate their environment.<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Anemograna}}</ref>

==Wind Currents==
[[File:Anemograna 1.png|thumb|left|Anemograna found in Confront Stormterror]]
When three Anemograna are collected, their power is released and a small Wind Current on your location is temporarily formed. This effect can be triggered early by using an {{Anemo}} [[Elemental Skill]] or [[Elemental Burst]], after collecting only 1 or 2 Anemograna. In [[Dragonspine]], this effect can be triggered with a {{Cryo}} Elemental Skill or Burst instead. Note that it is the activation of the skill that triggers this effect, not its damage.

Being inside the wind current created by Cryo Anemograna will increase the accumulation rate of [[Sheer Cold]].

After a certain period of time, the Anemograna will return to their original locations and any Wind Current created will lose its effect. However, in [[Confront Stormterror]], platforms affected by Energy Rain will have their Anemograna instantly and permanently activate Wind Currents.{{clr}}

==Wind Catchers==
Forging [[Wind Catcher]]s allows you to store up to 5 Anemograna charges at a time and unleash them in a designated location. Its blueprint is obtained by reaching [[Mondstadt]] [[Reputation]] Level 3.
