'''Bloodbranch Coral''' is a [[Quest Item]] obtained during the {{Quest|The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent}}. The Traveler was sent by [[Tsuyuko]] to retrieve this Jade Coral Branch from [[Enkanomiya]] in order to perform the [[Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri]].

==Trivia==
* The {{Achievement|Fire Rat's Robe, Dragon-Head Pearl, Sacred Offering Bowl, and...}} is gained from obtaining the Bloodbranch Coral. This achievement is a reference to the Japanese fictional prose narrative ''{{w|Tale of the Bamboo Cutter}}''. The main character, Kaguya-hime demands the items from her potential suitors in return for her love.
** The Bloodbranch Coral would correspond to the jeweled branch from the mythical island of {{w|Hōrai}} that one of her suitors is required to obtain.
