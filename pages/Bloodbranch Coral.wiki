'''Bloodbranch Coral''' is a Quest Item obtained during the World Quest [[The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent]]. The Traveler was sent by [[Tsuyuko]] to retrieve this Jade Coral Branch from [[Enkanomiya]] in order to perform the [[Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri]].

==Trivia==
* The achievement "[[Fire Rat's Robe, Dragon-Head Pearl, Sacred Offering Bowl, and...]]" is gained from obtaining the Bloodbranch Coral. This achievement is a reference to the Japanese fictional prose narrative {{w|Tale of the Bamboo Cutter|''Tale of the Bamboo Cutter''}}. The main character, Kaguya-hime demands the items from her potential suitors in return for her love.
** The Bloodbranch Coral would correspond to the jeweled branch from the mythical island of {{w|w:Hōrai|Hōrai}} that one of her suitors is required to obtain.
