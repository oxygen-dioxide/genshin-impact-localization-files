{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Enter Alhaitham's Home)
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 01.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' [[Alhaitham]] isn't in, so feel free to sit wherever. I'll bring out the box.
:{{Black Screen|Kaveh brings out a box and dusts it off...}}
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' *sigh*
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Oh, nothing. I just didn't realize how much time had passed. The box is pretty dusty, which means it's already been a while since I've moved into this place... and many years since [[Faranak|my mother]] moved to [[Fontaine]].
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 04.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I'm happy for her. I hope she'll be able to find happiness there. She raised me all by herself after [[Kaveh's Father|my father]] passed away. It definitely wasn't easy for her.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 05.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Anyway, enough about that, let's see what I packed into this box. Uh, what are all these things...
:;(An image of a building appears)
:[[File:Past Mementos Building.png|200px]]
:{{DIcon}} Is that a... drawing?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 06.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Oh, I remember now. This is a drawing I made in [[Port Ormos]].
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 07.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Obviously, I wouldn't call it anything special now, but I was less than five years old when I made this drawing. That's more than twenty years ago... Heh, you could say it's pretty good for a child of that age.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 08.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Hmm, now that I've said that out loud, I suppose I do have some level of artistic talent, right?
:{{DIcon}} Why do you say that?
:{{DIcon}} You don't sound as confident as you used to be.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 09.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Criticism and self-doubt have always been a part of the artistic process. Without criticism, there can be no improvement. It's normal for me to question my abilities from time to time.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 10.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I admit that I may have spent a little too long questioning myself this time around, but as you know, the heart tends to dwell on whatever it pleases...
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 11.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' *sigh* Anyway, never mind... The more I talk about it, the less confident I feel. Let's see what else we have in the box.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 12.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Ah, my building blocks... it's been years since I've last seen these. When I was a kid, I used to stack them super high, and could even stabilize the tower to keep it from tumbling over.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 13.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Oh, and this blueprint... Haha, I made it by copying my mother's sketch, and the aspect ratio was horrendous. It's still technically the first blueprint I made myself, though.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 14.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I was super proud of myself when I finished it, and put it in the same pile as my mother's sketches, hoping she'd notice and compliment me for my good work.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 15.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Unfortunately, my mother didn't realize that I had put it there. When she had a meeting with a client the next day, she handed my blueprint to him by mistake. The client was completely confused by this "new" blueprint, but apparently he felt too tongue-tied to question such a famous architect.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 16.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' It was only a few days later that he finally gathered up the courage to pay my mother a visit. He asked, "the door in this blueprint is even taller than the roof... Is this supposed to be part of the design?"
:{{DIcon}} And what happened after that?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 17.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' My mother took me with her to personally apologize to the client several times.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 18.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' She didn't scold me about it in private, though. Instead, she went over all the steps required to draw a good blueprint, and was very patient throughout the whole process. I still remember it like it was yesterday.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 19.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Hmm... let's see, is there anything else left in this box?&nbsp;...Huh, what was this again?
:;(A book appears)
:[[File:Past Mementos Book.png|200px]]
:{{DIcon}} A notebook with a lock?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 20.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Ah, this is my mother's notebook. She used to write and sketch in it all the time.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 21.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' When I was a child, I used to be super fascinated by this notebook, and always pestered my mother to let me read it. After asking her a few times, she told me that I could read it as long as I could guess the password.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 22.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Huh, wonder why she didn't take this notebook with her... Did she leave it to me on purpose?
:{{DIcon}} You could open it and take a look.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 23.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Hah, if only I could... I never managed to guess the password.
:{{DIcon}} Even after all those years?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 24.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Hey, it's not a matter of time, it's a matter of inspiration! That's what we need to guess the password.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 25.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Who knows, maybe this time, something will click in my head, and the answer will just present itself. Let me think, hmm... what could it be...?
:{{DIcon}} Your name?
:{{DIcon}} Your birthday?
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 26.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Haha, I could tell what you were thinking. Don't worry, I tried all the easy guesses a long time ago.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 27.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I've tried my name, my father's name, my mother's name, my grandparents' names on both sides, and all of our birthdays... I've tried every name and number remotely related to my family.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 28.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I've even tried stuff like "LOVEYOUKAVEH," "TAKECARE," and "YOURSTRULY." I've tried every cheesy phrase and well wish in the book, but this lock has refused to budge.
:{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 29.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I wouldn't try that route again... I have a hunch that it won't be that simple. Also, if she really did use something like that, she'd never hear the end of it from the folks over at [[Haravatat]] if they ever found out.
:{{Hangout Branch|We can try asking some of her old acquaintances...|Wondrous Times}}
:;(+1 Heart)
::{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 35.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' So we could find someone who was close to my mother, and see if they might know anything? Hmm, I see what you're saying... But who should we talk to for that?
::{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 36.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' My mother was never really the one to be social. My father was the one with more friends, but all of those connections were severed when he died.
::{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 37.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Let me think... Is there still someone at the [[Akademiya]] who would know my mother... Ah, actually, there is someone. Professor [[Zaha Hadi]].
::{{DIcon}} Who is that?
:;(+1 Heart)
::{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 38.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Huh, you've really never heard of her? She's a famous Kshahrewar scholar, and leading expert in formal garden design. My mother studied under her as a student many years ago.
::{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 39.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Professor Zaha Hadi published many works during her career, so I was also able to learn a lot by studying her essays. If there's anyone who still remembers my mom, it'd be her.
::{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 40.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' She's older now and is no longer teaching at the Akademiya. If I remember correctly, she spends most of her time around the [[Bimarstan]] area.
::{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 41.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Let's go take a look. We might run into her if we're lucky.
:;(Go to [[Wondrous Times]])
:{{Hangout Branch|Then maybe we should just put it aside for now.|The First Ideal}}
::{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 30.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...Yeah, you're right. Although I was hoping to find some words of wisdom from my mother, if I stop and think about it, her words may not be the advice that I need to hear right at this moment.
::{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 31.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Everyone's life journey is different. Traveler, you've visited many lands and met many people, so I'm sure you've run into situations where some advice wasn't exactly suitable for the situation at hand.
::{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 32.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Ah, I just got an idea, though. If I want to rekindle the creative passion that I had before, instead of trying to unlock an old notebook, why don't I take a walk around the parts of town that had changed my life?
::{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 33.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' What do you think?
::{{DIcon}} Sounds good to me.
::{{A|vo kvcop001 1907501 kaveh 34.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I'm glad you agree. Then let's start by taking a quick stroll around the Akademiya.
:;(Go to [[The First Ideal]])
