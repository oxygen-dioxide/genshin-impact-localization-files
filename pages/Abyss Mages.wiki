{{Description|[[Abyss]] creatures who can command the power of the elements in combat to a certain extent.<br />For unknown reasons, abyss mages are able to communicate with the [[hilichurls]], thus enabling them to manipulate their minds easily. They say abyss mages utter a long-forgotten language from which they draw magical power.}}
'''Abyss Mages''' are monsters that are a part of the [[Abyss Order]] who act as their foot soldiers. They are able to harness elemental energy from the Ley Lines of [[Teyvat]] and use that power towards their group's goal of overthrowing the world ruled by the archons.

==Strategy==
Abyss Mages will spawn with or without a shield. In the event that the mage spawns without one (which is usually the case when they're performing rituals), they will immediately activate it upon taking damage or spotting the player, whichever comes first.

The shield is immune to its own elemental damage as well as weak physical attacks such as bows and swords. Physical [[Claymore]] attacks deal some damage but are not as effective as some elemental reactions. The shield also applies an [[Gauge Unit Theory/Auras|elemental aura]] of their affinity around them as long as it is active.

Apart from their own elemental attacks, the mages have a tendency to teleport around to get a better angle on the player by clutching their mask, teleporting in if the player is away from them and out if the player is too close to them. Mages deal elemental damage the area near them upon reappearing after a teleport.

Once the shield has been depleted, the Abyss Mage will drop to the ground in a dazed state and their resistances are reset to base values. See [[Damage#Resistance|damage resistance]] for more details. After they regain their senses, they will perform a ritual to restore their elemental shield, indicated with flame pillars for Pyro, icicles for Cryo, water bubbles for Hydro and electric orbs for Electro, which deal damage to the player if touched. This can be interrupted with sufficient knockback or other means of interruption.

All types of Abyss Mages have 4 different attacks: a Normal Attack which involves shooting a small projectile, a Special Attack, Teleportation and Revival.

After using their special attack, Abyss Mages have a tendency to taunt the player by either dancing or relaxing after successfully attacking the player for a short duration. If the player avoids the attack, they can use this time to deal additional damage to the mage before they get back into combat.
