==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Shibata is a [[Watatsumi Army]] member who knows some amount of information, though not the details, regarding the Sangonomiya Shrine.

===Personality===
''(To be added.)''

===Appearance===
Shibata wears the Watatsumi Army's standard uniform, modeled from the {{Lang|''ashigaru''|ja=足軽}} of feudal Japan. His clothing consists of a light red-white gradient ''shitagi'' with a red-violet colored left sleeve, gray ''kobakama'', and ''waraji'' sandals without the socks. Although not visible, the [[Sangonomiya Clan]]'s crest is imprinted on the back of the ''shitagi'', below the neck. Additional features on the uniform's design such as breastplates and helmets are not present, compared to Shogun's Army uniforms, but were still equipped with ''sode'' (shoulder armor), ''han-kote'' (half-armored sleeves), ''haidate'' (thigh guards), and ''sune-ate'' (greaves) armor, whose colors were red and black with gold accents. The right shoulder guard has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest imprinted on it. Shibata is equipped with a ''juumonji yari'', whose shaft is colored with a red-white gradient and has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest under the spearhead.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Shibata:''' Hello, what are you here at [[Sangonomiya Shrine]] for?
:{{DIcon}} Can you tell me about Sangonomiya Shrine?
::'''Shibata:''' This shrine is the heart of [[Watatsumi Island]], and is run by [[Sangonomiya Kokomi|Her Excellency]]. It is an offering to our deity, [[Watatsumi Omikami]].
::'''Shibata:''' Well, I call it an offering, but this isn't actually where the body of Watatsumi Omikami lies.
::'''Shibata:''' However, the large coral that can be found outside the palace courts were indeed taken from Watatsumi Omikami's very own body... Probably.
::'''Shibata:''' *sigh* I don't really know the details myself. If you want to know more, why not ask [[Mochizuki|the shrine maiden over there]]?
::'''Shibata:''' ...That said, she's been quite troubled of late by that researcher. Either way, good luck.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Shibata:''' And to you, Traveler.
