==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Ulman is a treasure hunter seeking [[Iron Coin]]s to resell them for [[Mora]], which are found by his Treasure-Seeking Seelie companion. When asked about his [[Treasure Hoarders|companions]], he replies that he does not trust them and would not collaborate with these "greedy churls", however he does seems to deal with them as they are the ones that, for a fee, found a boat for him to get to Inazuma. He calls himself a "Seelie magnet" as during his travels, he has encountered and partnered with several Treasure-Seeking Seelies, although all grew uninterested with him with some time. The [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] would run into him across Teyvat, where they would take the Seelies and dig up Iron Coins, giving it to him in exchange for various rewards.

Upon arriving in Fontaine, he ran into and partnered again with another Seelie, but after following it, soon discovered that it led underwater. After acquiring another batch of coins, Ulman begins to contemplate finding a way to cut out his middleman to increase profits and perhaps stop traveling.

===Appearance===
He has golden hair and wears a black hat with a white feather and a black-brown vest.
