==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Ulman is a treasure hunter seeking [[Iron Coin]]s to resell them for [[Mora]], which are found by his Treasure-Seeking Seelie companion. When asked about his [[Treasure Hoarders|companions]], he replies that he does not trust them and would not collaborate with these "greedy churls", however he does seems to deal with them as they are the ones that, for a fee, found a boat for him to get to Inazuma. He calls himself a "Seelie magnet" as he already encountered and partnered with a Treasure-Seeking Seelie thrice, although all grew uninterested in him after some time.
