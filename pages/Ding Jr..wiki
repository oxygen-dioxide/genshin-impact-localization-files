===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing ''An Ancient Sacrifice of Sacred Brocade''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ding Jr.:''' Did you hear the rumors about the water and the soil?
:{{DIcon}} Rumors?
::'''Ding Jr.:''' Shhh! Don't let anyone else hear! I'm only telling you, alright!?
::'''Ding Jr.:''' There've been more and more [[Xuanwen Beast]]s skulking in the mountains lately. A fiend must be behind all this, or something!
::'''Ding Jr.:''' If you ask me, the quality of the tea's gone down because these monsters contaminated the water and the soil.
::{{DIcon}} Okay, that's reaching a bit too far...
::'''Ding Jr.:''' You have no idea just how complicated it is.
::'''Ding Jr.:''' I think we'll need a [[thaumaturge]] to exorcise the fiends... or find some really powerful people to settle this.
:{{DIcon}} I'm more interested in that machine than rumors...
::'''Ding Jr.:''' A practical one, aren't you? No interest in rumors, all work, work, work... Gah, you're making me feel bad.
::'''Ding Jr.:''' Anyway, this is the machine we use to bake the tea leaves. Some of the tea is placed in here after stirring to get rid of the moisture.
::'''Ding Jr.:''' The flames under the machine might be powerful, but the temperature inside isn't too high, so the process takes a good while.
::'''Ding Jr.:''' I don't need to watch the machine every second, so all in all, this job's not too tiring.
::'''Ding Jr.:''' But [[Ding Sr.|Ol' Senior]] can't be distracted at all. I'm afraid I can't do his job yet...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Ding Jr.:''' Take care, and see you next time!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''An Ancient Sacrifice of Sacred Brocade''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ding Jr.:''' Have you heard the rumors about the Carp Adeptus?
:{{DIcon}} Rumors?
::'''Ding Jr.:''' Shhh! Don't let anyone else hear! I'm only telling you, alright!?
::'''Ding Jr.:''' A kind Carp Adeptus awakened recently, saw the damage in Chenyu Vale, and stopped the Xuanwen Beasts from wreaking more havoc.
::'''Ding Jr.:''' If that rumor's true, the quality of tea will return to normal soon, easy!
::'''Ding Jr.:''' Maybe it'll even be better than before!
::{{DIcon}} If you really twist it, it kinda makes sense...
::'''Ding Jr.:''' Moving, huh?
::'''Ding Jr.:''' But baking is something I have to do every day, so my days are more or less the same.
::'''Ding Jr.:''' If only the Carp Adeptus could make tea easier to process... Or improve my techniques...
:{{DIcon}} I'm more interested in that machine than rumors...
::'''Ding Jr.:''' A practical one, aren't you? No interest in rumors, all work, work, work... Gah, you're making me feel bad.
::'''Ding Jr.:''' Anyway, this is the machine we use to bake the tea leaves. Some of the tea is placed in here after stirring to get rid of the moisture.
