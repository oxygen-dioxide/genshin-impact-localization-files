*'''Slash Combo 1:''' Performs 3 slashes with her polearm, dealing '''75% ATK''', '''75% ATK''', '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}. This attack is always used when Ei teleports to the player's left side.
**If the player is close to Ei after the first 3 slashes, performs 3 more slashes, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} with each slash. Ei dashes forward with the final slash and releases a flurry of slashes behind her, dealing '''37.5% ATK''', '''37.5% ATK''', '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.

If not destroyed after a period of time, the Magatsu Electroculi explode violently, dealing '''400% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}. If a player is within an area where multiple Electroculi's AoE overlap, they will be damaged multiple times. This attack can only be used once.

*'''Follow-Up:''' If the player is behind Ei shortly after she performs certain attacks, swiftly turns around to perform a flurry of slashes, dealing {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.

==Lore==
In the Plane of Euthymia, the [[Raiden Shogun]], [[Ei]], spends most of her time {{w|meditating}}, while having a [[The Shogun|puppet]] execute daily affairs in Inazuma. The Plane of Euthymia consists of her consciousness. After seeing all the ambitions in the [[Statue of the Omnipresent God]]'s enclosed Visions, she repeals the Vision Hunt Decree and disables most of her puppet's functions. Because of her isolation for centuries, the Raiden Shogun is unaware of the changes Inazuma has underwent. During the [[Reflections of Mortality]] act of the [[Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter]], Ei realizes that even though Inazuma has changed drastically, it is still Inazuma.

==Trivia==
*During [[Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow]], the boss' displayed name is "Raiden Shogun" and her title is ''The Seven: Electro Archon''.
**During [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]], her displayed name changes to "Ei" and her title is ''Master of the Euthymic Plane''.
*Despite not using Visions to channel their powers, even the Archons themselves are not able to cast their skills while the Vision Hunt Decree is effective.
