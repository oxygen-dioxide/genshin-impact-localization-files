{{Element Infobox}}
'''Physical''' is one of the eight [[damage]] types. The other seven damage types are ''[[Elemental]]''.

[[Sword]], [[Claymore]], and [[Polearm]] attacks deal {{Color|Physical DMG}} by default, as do [[Normal Attack|normal attacks]] from [[Bows]] and [[Aimed Shot]]s that are not fully charged. [[Catalyst]] attacks cannot deal {{Color|Physical DMG}} due to innate elemental infusion for all basic and Charged Attacks, as well as Elemental Skills and Elemental Bursts. The only method of dealing {{Color|Physical DMG}} as a catalyst-wielder is through Weapon Passives, as some Catalyst weapons like [[Eye of Perception]] and [[Skyward Atlas]] can deal additional DMG as {{Color|Physical DMG}}.

Some [[Elemental Burst]]s can also deal {{Color|Physical DMG}}, such as [[Eula]]'s [[Glacial Illumination]] and [[Xinyan]]'s [[Riff Revolution]].
