{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Koyonki:''' Be careful, my friend. Make sure you watch out for falling rocks in this area.
:{{DIcon}} Falling rocks? Aren't we still inside the tribal settlement?
::'''Koyonki:''' Haha, take a look above you. You'll see what I mean. Anyway, make sure to be on the lookout.
:{{DIcon}} About the volcano...
::'''Koyonki:''' Oh, so you're going to the [[Great Volcano of Tollan]]?
::'''Koyonki:''' Haha, I guess I shouldn't be surprised. After all the [[Saurian Relics Association (Faction)|Saurian Relics Association]] and more than a handful of adventurer's have been trying to find a way inside that place for ages.
::'''Koyonki:''' You strike me as the latter, friend. Am I right? Watch out for sudden eruptions on your expedition, then. You never know what the volcano might spit out right on top of your head!
:{{DIcon}} Okay then. See you.
::'''Koyonki:''' You take care of yourself now.
