;今天是流浪者的生日哦，我们快去为他庆祝吧！
:'''派蒙：'''哇！那边的人是…
:'''旅行者：'''嘘&mdash;&mdash;
:'''派蒙：'''（小声）没想到会在图书馆遇到你。
:'''流浪者：'''因论派的学生硬给我推荐了几本书，无聊了随便翻翻而已。
:'''旅行者：'''那要出去走走吗？
:'''流浪者：'''不必了，这里没人烦我，清净点也不错。<ref group="Note" name="qingjing">The phrase {{zh|清净|tl=clean}} is likely a typo of the homophonous {{zh|清静|tl=peaceful, quiet.}}</ref>
:'''旅行者：'''那我也一起看看吧。
:'''流浪者：'''随你。
:旅行者从桌上拿起一本书，坐在一旁开始阅读。

;Today is [[Wanderer]]'s birthday, let's go and celebrate with him!
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! That guy over there is...
:'''Traveler:''' Shh&mdash;
:'''Paimon:''' (Quietly) Paimon didn't expect to bump into you in the library.
:'''Wanderer:''' Some [[Vahumana]] students were trying to push some book recommendations onto me. I don't have anything else to do, so I'm just idly flipping through them.
:'''Traveler:''' Then do you want to go out for a walk?
:'''Wanderer:''' No need. Nobody bothers me here. Some peacefulness is nice for a change.
:'''Traveler:''' I'll read a book with you, then.
:'''Wanderer:''' Suit yourself.
:The Traveler picks up a book, sits down, and begins to read it.
:...
:'''Paimon:''' Umm... Are the both of you still reading? Isn't it already time for dinner?
