'''End of the Oneiric Euthymia''' is a [[Quest Domain]] during [[Raiden Shogun]]'s [[Story Quest]] [[Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter]]: Act II - [[Transient Dreams]] quests "[[Farewell to the Past]]" and "[[Radiant Sakura]]."

In this domain, the player engages in a battle against the [[Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto]]. After completing Transient Dreams, the Trounce Domain [[End of the Oneiric Euthymia]] will be unlocked, allowing the ability to relive this battle and obtain rewards.

==Notes==
*During [[Farewell to the Past]], the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto will fully heal twice after reaching critical health. After healing, she will immediately switch stances.
*During [[Radiant Sakura]], the [[Raiden Shogun]]'s [[Secret Art: Musou Shinsetsu|Elemental Burst]] will be active by default with an unlimited duration.
* The Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto will ''not'' gain a [[shield]] or increased [[Resistance]]s in the Baleful Shadowlord state.
*If [[Raiden Shogun]] reaches below critical HP during battle, she will automatically be revived with maximum HP.<!--Check when-->
