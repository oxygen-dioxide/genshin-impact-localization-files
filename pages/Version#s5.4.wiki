After setting these goals, the system will automatically calculate the amount of materials needed to achieve each goal and display the missing materials if there are insufficient materials.

** If you don't have enough materials to meet the level-up goals, the amount of materials needed to achieve level-up goals and the goals' completion status will be displayed on the item info pop-up when collecting materials.

** Relevant features will start recording data from Version 5.4, and will be fully implemented from [[Version 5.5]].
