'''''Dangerous Haul''''' is a [[Daily Commission]] that can occur in various locations in [[Teyvat]].

==Steps==
{{Quest Description|The hilichurls are escorting a [[Slime Balloon]] that is loaded with dangerous cargo. Destroy the hilichurls' Slime Balloon and clear this menace out.}}
#Sabotage the [[Slime Balloon]] 0/1

==Gameplay Notes==
*The commission will start and the slime balloon will begin to move when a character approaches the balloon. (This is in contrast to [[Safe Conduct]], which requires interaction to start the balloon.) The balloon cannot take damage before the commission begins.
*The slime balloon will continuously advance close to the ground. Destroy it before it reaches its destination.
**AI-based targeting Elemental Skills like [[Guoba Attack]] and [[Nightrider]] will not target the balloon.
**Failing will reset the commission.
**Using the map to teleport away from the area will immediately fail and reset the commission.
*Enemies will spawn as the balloon passes certain points in the route. Defeating them is not required, but may help improve targeting or prevent characters from taking too much damage.
**Enemies spawned by the commission will not drop items, Mora, or experience.
**Travelling far enough to spawn enemies from the next wave will despawn any remaining enemies from the previous wave.
**At times, the player will be surrounded by a combat forcefield and forced to defeat the enemies inside before continuing. Unlike the other enemy spawns, these combat rings seem to trigger based on the player's position, so running ahead or trailing behind the balloon can trigger them early or late, respectively. (The balloon is uninhibited by this ring.)
*Destroying the balloon will despawn all enemies and structures related to this commission.
*The Starfell Valley version of this commission spawns a wind current at the bottom of the cliff north of the starting location, likely to allow quick travel from the Teleport Waypoint at the base to the top of the cliff where the commission takes place.

==Rewards==
{{Commission Rewards|full}}

==Routes==
===Starfell Valley===
Starting south of the west-most pond, follows the path east towards the teleporter, then turns north from the teleporter, taking a Wind Current up a cliff before rejoining with the path and ending at the tower.
# [[Hilichurl Berserker]] ×3, [[Hilichurl Grenadier]] ×1, [[Electro Hilichurl Shooter]], 1 Hilichurl roadblock, 1 Exploding Barrel, 3 Pyro [[Boom Blossoms]] along the path
#* The balloon floats over the roadblock.
# [[Electro Hilichurl Shooter]] ×1, [[Pyro Hilichurl Shooter]] ×1, [[Dendro Samachurl]] ×1, 2 Exploding Barrels along the path
# [[Cryo Abyss Mage]] ×1 in an Anemo barrier
#* The balloon passes through the barrier even if the Abyss Mage has not been defeated yet.
# [[Wooden Shield Mitachurl]] ×1, Wind Current, [[Pyro Hilichurl Shooter]] ×2, [[Electro Hilichurl Shooter]] ×1

===Stormbearer Mountains===
Starting next to the tower on top of the cliff just southwest of the northeast Teleport Waypoint (there will be a wind current from the Teleport Waypoint to the top of the cliff), follows the cliff south, then turns west to descend down the cliff face south of the river, then turns north into the river to end on the river shore southeast of the [[Anemo Hypostasis]].

Unlike other versions of this commission, this version has few distinct sections and instead involves a long series of sequential enemies.

# Combat arena appears at the shore {{Enemy List|Pyro Abyss Mage*1}}
# The balloon turns east, stopping just around the corner, under the overhanging stone. Note that this final leg of the route is very short, so it is best to destroy the balloon before reaching the Anemo barrier.

==Strategy==
*You can use ATK or CRIT boosting food to take down the Slime Balloon more quickly.
*You can hide behind the balloon to avoid enemy attacks; this is particularly useful against projectile-based attackers, but can also help prevent your character from turning around to attack nearby melee enemies.
