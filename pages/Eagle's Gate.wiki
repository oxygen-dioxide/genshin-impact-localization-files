==Trivia==
* The noble-minded person in the description likely refers to [[Vennessa]], because the Chinese description does not specify singular or plural, and the word {{Lang|''yīng''|zh={{wt|鷹|鹰}}|zh_tl={{w|Accipitridae}}/falcons}} is translated elsewhere as "falcon" in the English version.
===Etymology===
* {{Lang|"Eagle's Gate"|de=Adlertor}} is a popular name given to an archway or a gate in Germany and Austria, including one at {{w|St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna}}, the mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vienna.
