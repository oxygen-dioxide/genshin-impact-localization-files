'''Funerary Mask''' is a [[Quest Item]] obtained after completing the {{Quest|Duel Before the Throne}}.

==Archive Description==
A trophy obtained from defeating [[Signora]], Eighth of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers|Fatui Harbingers]].

[[Fatui|The Fatui]] often face the world from behind their masks, and it is said that this is because all they once were mean nothing once they become [[Fatui]], and thus must they forsake their true names and face alike.

&mdash;Yet the act of giving up all that makes up an "I" &mdash; one's past and the bonds that come with it &mdash; is no mean feat. Perhaps it is fair to say that only those who possess an obsession close to or even exceeding the level of delusion might be willing to join this group that so rebels against the [[Heavenly Principles]], binding their remaining days to their [[Delusion]]s and burning as brightly as stars. ...Of course, many within the [[Fatui]] are simply consumed by power and are simple sadists &mdash; nor are these states necessary in conflict.

The woman whose real name was [[Rosalyne-Kruzchka Lohefalter]] may have once led a more innocent, naive existence. But that was before her eyes were filled with a raging fire, and her innocent days were burned away. Before the icy [[Delusion]] extinguished the flaming tongues that ever gnawed her. Before the frozen might that protected her was shattered by the [[Traveler|eternal outlander]], unbound yet no less determined than she was, causing the flames to burst forth once more...
