** The Wayob Manifestation summons jagged rocks that erupt outward in a X-shaped pattern 3 times, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}.
* If the Arena's duration ends and the shield is not destroyed, the Wayob Manifestation summons a massive field of jagged rocks, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}, and converts the remaining percentage of its shield to a {{Geo}} elemental shield.{{Elemental Shield Data|Geo|24|Maximum}}
* If the non-elemental shield is destroyed before the Arena's duration ends, a massive amount of Elemental Particles will spawn, restoring '''90''' base Energy. The actual amount restored will vary based on [[Energy Recharge]], whether the character is on or off-field, and the number of characters in the party.
* When either shield is active, the Wayob Manifestation is immune to all DMG.
* When either shield is destroyed, the Wayob Manifestation becomes paralyzed for 5 seconds.
* '''Local Legend:''' This ability is disabled.
