==New Abilities and Attacks==
===Basalt Column Changes===
[[File:Hypostatic Symphony Blast Column.gif|thumb|right|Destroying Basalt Columns generates shards]]
*When on a Basalt Column, the Hypostasis Core will not change position as it attacks. After a time, the Basalt Column that the Hypostasis Core is currently on will explode, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} and will create a Sandstone Vortex that deals continuous '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}. Once destroyed, a Basalt Column will generate a Geo Elemental Shard, which will provide a shield for the character that picks it up.
*Shortly into the battle, the Hypostasis will activate the other Basalt Columns it is not on, and they will continuously fire rock needles that deal '''20% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} to characters.

===Gilded Tide===
[[File:Hypostatic Symphony Stone Beams.gif|thumb|right|Destroying Stone Beams interrupts Gilded Tide]]
*If not defeated by the time all Basalt Columns are destroyed, the Hypostasis core will use a new attack known as "Gilded Tide", gathering power from summoned Stone Beams in the area and continuously generate shockwaves that deal '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}. Destroy all these Stone Beams to [[Interruption Resistance|interrupt]] Gilded Tide. No more Basalt Columns will be generated after this attack.

==Returning Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Summon Basalt Columns:''' Summons multiple Basalt Columns in the vicinity that can be destroyed with Claymores. Breaking the pillar where the Hypostasis is located will make it fall into a vulnerable state for a while.
*'''Shockwave:''' A single shockwave is emitted from the Basalt Column when the Hypostasis is on top of it.
*'''Shockwave Combo:''' After charging for a while, multiple shockwaves are emitted from each of the Basalt Column. This attack is deadly and deals a massive amount of damage.  Attack the concentrated Geo energy near one of the Basalt Columns to create a Geo forcefield that blocks attacks.  While inside the forcefield, attack the Basalt Column it is on nearby to bring the Geo Hypostasis back down to ground level.
*'''Stone Pellets:''' An attack that shoots multiple small rocks that can be avoided by moving around or hiding behind a pillar.
*'''Seals of Rock:''' Continuously forms magic seals around the player, dropping Geo energy at the location to damage the player.
*'''Clap''': Quickly flies next to the player and forms a large wall, which folds in a "clapping" motion very quickly, dealing damage in an area in front of the wall. Dash sideways to dodge.
*'''Hammerfall:''' Only used after "Gilded Tide". Takes the form of a large hammer and crashes it down at the player's general location.
*'''Terra Resurgence:''' At low HP, the Hypostasis teleports to the center of the arena and forms 3 Geo pillars that channels Geo energy, which must be destroyed using attacks like Claymores. After 15 seconds, the pillars are absorbed to heal ~15% of its HP for each pillar absorbed.

With Stamina being used for destroying pillars through Normal Attack cancels, more concessions had to be taken for a low end geared team.

===Mid Tier Route (Stone Heart Sonata II)===
*Difficulty Level: Expert
*Total Score: 3,960
A bizarre scenario where you are given back 25% attack if you get hit until you are below 50% HP. If the Pure Geo Hypostasis does not attack, you can try keeping a mid-range distance and move backwards and forwards to trigger the next attack.
