==Profile==
In ''[[A Riddle Amidst the Crowds]]'', Scarlett approaches Traveler and Paimon eating in [[Good Hunter]]. She introduces herself as "a traveler, visiting [[Mondstadt]] from another land," who supposedly had family and friends in Mondstadt. She shows interest in solving that year's [[Windblume]] prophecy, and attracts suspicion from [[Rosaria]], who decides to spy on her. In ''[[Joy Above the Clouds]]'' it is revealed that she is a successor of a [[Hexenzirkel]] member [[I. Ivanovna N.]], who used the initial "J".
