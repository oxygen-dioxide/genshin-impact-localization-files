{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Isadora:''' Some problems might have been fated to be intractable... I suspect we've all got to make our own choices.
:{{DIcon}} You seem a little down.
::'''Isadora:''' Heh... I'm not sure I'd say that, but at the same time, it's been a while since I last considered myself happy.
::'''Isadora:''' I'm an auditor here at the Palais. My work is confidential, so I can't really unburden myself of my complaints to anyone.
::'''Isadora:''' Of course, I fully intend to follow the rules, but sometimes I really do wish I had someone to talk to.
::'''Isadora:''' Maybe I need to take another approach &mdash; learn to live with those things that don't go smoothly.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Sorry that I couldn't help.
:::'''Isadora:''' No, it's okay. It is good enough to chat under such a serene night sky. Thank you.
:::'''Isadora:''' Good night and sweet dreams.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Rainbow Rose|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} Best of luck to you.
::'''Isadora:''' And to you.
