{{Description|Jean's magnanimity is as vast as the dandelion fields, and it is the root of her wish to protect others.}}
'''Dandelion Breeze''' is [[Jean]]'s [[Elemental Burst]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* Dandelion Breeze's cast animation takes ~0.9 seconds to complete. Hence, Dandelion Field lasts for 9 seconds only.
* All enemies within the field's AoE will take one instance of Entering/Exiting DMG when the field is created and when it dissipates.
* {{TalentNote|icd|All DMG dealt by this skill|0|plural=1}}
* Additionally, due to the self-applied Anemo status, multiple Swirls can occur on the active character occur in between the casting and termination of the skill (around one every second) when affected by another element. This occurs without damage to the character. These multiple swirls  have several uses:
** It can also be used to cleanse certain debuffs from [[Ley Line Disorders]] as well as the Elemental Marks from [[Azhdaha]]. This can take several Swirls.
** The Swirled element can be used to break elemental shields.
** Damage to foes from these Swirls scales like any other Swirl damage &mdash; with Jean's level and elemental mastery
** These cleansing swirls don't seem to activate 'elemental reaction' type buffs, like that from the four piece set of the [[Instructor]] set. (The Swirls on foes do).
