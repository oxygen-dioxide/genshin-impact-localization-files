{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Cipitz:''' Hehe... Just wait till she sees me in action!
:{{DIcon}} And you are...?
::'''Cipitz:''' Hmph, I'm Cipitz! The future mightiest wrestler in the [[Collective of Plenty]] &mdash; which means I'm plenty strong already, of course!
::'''Cipitz:''' Do you see [[Nanaxa|that Tatankasaurus]] over there? It just tried to knock me down, but I grabbed its leg and executed a perfect take-down!
::'''Cipitz:''' I&mdash;I'm not joking! I really did that! Just you wait till I'm older &mdash; I'm going to wrestle a dragon, just like [[Wanjiru]] did! None of the taller warriors around here will be a match for me then!
:{{DIcon}} Aren't you taking part in training? 
::'''Cipitz:''' Training? Hmph, that's so boring! It's just lifting weights and running laps, what's the point in practicing all that!?
::'''Cipitz:''' A true warrior relies on their own power and skill to achieve victory! Watch, I can take on a [[Tatankasaurus]]... Well, a [[Tatankasaur Whelp|baby Tatankasaurus]], which is more than that lot can manage with their running in circles!
::'''Cipitz:''' A&mdash;And another thing... [[Nappa]]'s never undergone training either. What if she ran into trouble out here? As the future strongest warrior, it's my duty to protect her!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Cipitz:''' Alright, seeya! The next time you see me, I'll be even stronger!
