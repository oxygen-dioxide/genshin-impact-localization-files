{{Quest Description|[[Tang Wen]], a researcher from [[Liyue]], seems to be missing home a lot...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:;(Talk to Tang Wen)
::'''Tang Wen''': Ahh, it would be nice to have some Liyue cuisine...
::{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
::'''Tang Wen''': You are? With that outfit... You're the Traveler, right? Sorry, I'm just a little homesick...
::{{DIcon}} Did you just say you wanted to have some Liyue cuisine?
::{{DIcon}} Do you need help with anything?
:::'''Tang Wen''': Let me introduce myself. I'm Tang Wen, a historian from Liyue. I was previously doing some field research on the unique customs and folklore of Inazuma.
:::'''Tang Wen''': I was about to return to Liyue as I had almost finished collecting information. But because of Inazuma's Sakoku Decree, I ended up being stranded here for a long time...
:::'''Tang Wen''': Actually, I think this is kind of a good thing for me. It's because I feel that this is a historic moment for Inazuma!
:::'''Tang Wen''': I am quite sure that this particular period will certainly leave a strong mark in the annals of history of Teyvat.
:::'''Tang Wen''': To witness such history with one's own eyes, and then record all of it in a true, complete and clear manner for posterity, is what a historian should do.
:::'''Tang Wen''': But... as exciting as this cause is to me, it won't satisfy my stomach...
:::{{DIcon}} Are you getting hungry?
:::'''Tang Wen''': I can't say... it's because I'm hungry... Hahaha, Inazuma's food is quite tasty too.
:::'''Tang Wen''': I really like the tempura here, although it feels like everything is coated with batter and then fried...
:::'''Tang Wen''': But after eating Inazuma cuisine for a long time, I started to miss the Liyue dishes. Sadly, I couldn't find a restaurant that could make authentic Liyue cuisine.
:::'''Tang Wen''': I finally decided to post a Cuisine Commission at the Adventurers' Guild a few days ago but there hasn't been any response...
:::{{DIcon}} Can I give it a try?
::'''Tang Wen''': Huh? Could it be... You know how to make Liyue cuisine? That's great!
::'''Tang Wen''': Th-Then, please help me! Please make me some authentic Liyue dishes!
::'''Tang Wen''': Let me think... What I really want to eat now is...
:;(Dialogue continues to a random version below)

;(After completing Transient Dreams)
:;(Talk to Tang Wen)
::'''Tang Wen''': Ahh, it would be nice to have some Liyue cuisine about now...
::{{DIcon}} What's the matter?
::'''Tang Wen''': Huh, that outfit... You're the Traveler, aren't you? I'm sorry, I'm just feeling a little homesick right now...
::{{DIcon}} Did you just say that you wanted to have some Liyue cuisine？
::{{DIcon}} Do you need help with anything?
:::'''Tang Wen''': Ah, right. Allow me to me introduce myself. I'm Tang Wen, a historian from Liyue. Previously, I was doing some field research on the unique customs and folklore of Inazuma.
:::'''Tang Wen''': I'd finished collecting all the material I needed, in fact, and was preparing to head back to Liyue. But so many big things have happened in Inazuma recently...
:::'''Tang Wen''': So I feel like I'm living in historic times here, you know?
:::'''Tang Wen''': The happenings of this particular period will certainly leave a strong mark in the annals of Teyvat's history.
:::'''Tang Wen''': To witness such history with one's own eyes, and then record all of it in a true, complete, and clear manner for posterity — that is what a historian should do.
:::'''Tang Wen''': But... as exciting as this cause is to me, it won't satisfy my stomach...
:::{{DIcon}} Hungry, are we?
:::'''Tang Wen''': Well, I wouldn't say that exactly... Inazuma's food is actually pretty tasty.
:::'''Tang Wen''': I really like the tempura here, although it's, well... They just wrap everything in batter and fry it, you know?
:::'''Tang Wen''': But after eating Inazuman cuisine for a long time, I started to miss dishes from back home. Sadly, I couldn't find a restaurant here that could make authentic Liyue cuisine.
:::'''Tang Wen''': So I finally decided to post a "cuisine commission" at the Adventurers' Guild a few days ago, but there hasn't been any response since...
:::{{DIcon}} May I give it a try?
::'''Tang Wen''': Huh? Wait... You know how to make Liyue cuisine? That's great!
::'''Tang Wen''': Th—Then, please help me! Please make me some authentic Liyue dishes!
::'''Tang Wen''': Let me think... What I'd really like to eat right now is...
:;(Dialogue continues to a random version below)

===Fish Version===
:'''Tang Wen''': Hmm... I want to eat fish! I miss the fish my mom made when I was a kid...
:'''Tang Wen''': Wash the fish, make slashes on both sides, stuff with spices and aged wine and marinate slightly, fry in a pan until golden brown...
:'''Tang Wen''': Then, add hot water and sauce to simmer. Finally, season over high heat, thicken the sauce, plate, and serve... Ah, that's the real deal!
:'''Tang Wen''': My younger brother would jump and cheer "It's ready! The food's ready!"
:'''Tang Wen''': *sobs* My mom is really good at cooking fish, but when can I go back to eat it?

:'''Tang Wen''': So, I want to eat meat! Please help me prepare a Liyue dish made of meat!

:{{DIcon}} That just sounds like he would attract mice...
