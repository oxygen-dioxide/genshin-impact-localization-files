'''Circlet of Logos''', also known colloquially as "'''the crown'''," "'''the mask'''," "'''the headpiece'''," "'''the hat'''," "'''the headgear'''," "'''the helmet'''," or simply "'''the Circlet'''," is an [[Artifact]] Piece in [[Genshin Impact]]. It can increase a [[character]]'s stats and currently has 7 possible main stats: HP%, DEF%, ATK%, [[Elemental Mastery]], Crit Rate%, Crit DMG%, or Healing Bonus%. Artifact Pieces can appear in all rarities (1-5 stars).

It is considered the second-hardest artifact piece to get "good stats" on, after the [[Goblet of Eonothem]], because of the rarity in which certain main stats drop and the number of different main stats it can have. Certain community-made experiments show the highest probability of main stat are DEF% (24%), HP% (22%), and ATK% (22%), while the lowest are Elemental Mastery (5%) and Healing Bonus% (7%). Crit Rate% and Crit DMG% both appear to have a 10% chance to drop each.
