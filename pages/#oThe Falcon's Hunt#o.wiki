{{Quest Description|After the previous adventure, it seems that Masseira still has some favor to ask of you...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Pass time)

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Masseira, optional)
:'''Masseira:''' (...Tadhla... your growth is... too slow...)

;(Talk to Masseira)
:'''Masseira:''' Ah! If it isn't the esteemed Master of the Jinni, savior of my little Falcon.
:'''Masseira:''' I'm embarrassed to ask but could you do me another favor? It's a hunting task.
:'''Masseira:''' Simply put, this is about Tadhla's coming-of-age ceremony. Please witness her growth for me.
:'''Masseira:''' She could be a bit of a handful, but I promise you will be well compensated. So I'm wondering if you would like to...
:'''Paimon:''' Don't worry, just leave it to us!
:'''Liloupar:''' *sigh*...
:{{DIcon}} We accept your commission.
::'''Liloupar:''' *sigh* Really, must we...
:{{DIcon}} About the hunt...
::'''Masseira:''' It's the coming-of-age ceremony for Tadhla. I used to train the "Falcons" in the tribe personally, but now... I'm no longer as agile as I once was.
::'''Masseira:''' After the previous commission, Tadhla said you have her trust. This is why I want to ask you to join in and see the Falcon's growth.
::{{DIcon}} I see. I'll help.
::'''Masseira:''' It's very kind of you. Please find Tadhla. She'll give you the details of this hunt.
:{{DIcon}} I have other plans.
::'''Masseira:''' Well then, I shall leave you alone.

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Tadhla, optional)
:'''Tadhla:''' (...Why can't you let me finish my coming-of-age ceremony on my own...)

;(Talk to Tadhla)
:'''Tadhla:''' Hello, thank you for your help.
:'''Paimon:''' Tadhla! Looks like you're in better spirits now! How's your wound now? Has it healed?
:'''Tadhla:''' Thank you for asking. Yes, it has healed... but left an indelible scar.
:'''Tadhla:''' No need to worry about me. Master... I mean, my father must have given you this commission.
:'''Liloupar:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Alright...
:{{DIcon}} "Master"...?
::'''Tadhla:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} "Father"...?
::'''Tadhla:''' That's not the target for this hunt. My apologies.
:'''Tadhla:''' There are three targets for this hunt: the Red Vulture, the Scorpion, and the Flying Serpent.
:'''Tadhla:''' First, the Red Vulture. We have already confirmed its whereabouts. All that needs to be done is to track it down.
:'''Tadhla:''' But of course, if you have other priorities, I'll wait here until you're all set. Only the prey won't be as patient as I am...
:{{DIcon}} Let's go.
::'''Tadhla:''' Please follow me.
:{{DIcon}} I have to finish something else first.
::'''Tadhla:''' Don't worry, I'll be here waiting for you.
:'''Tadhla:''' Please follow me. We have already confirmed its whereabouts. All that needs to be done is to track it down.

:'''Tadhla:''' By the way, are you wearing any perfume?
:'''Paimon:''' No, why'd you ask?
:'''Tadhla:''' Great, neither am I.

;(Investigate the first glowing area)
:'''Tadhla:''' What is that over there?
:'''Tadhla:''' She must have dropped these while fighting over food... Female, smelling of carrion... She's had a good meal and should be back in the nest soon.
:'''Tadhla:''' Let's follow her back to the nest.

;(Investigate the second glowing area)
:'''Tadhla:''' Droppings and weasel fur... There's still a little moisture. She's not too far away.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! You shouldn't pinch it with your hands...
:'''Tadhla:''' Why? You want it?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't want it!
:'''Tadhla:''' You can use them to cover your own scent. It will help.

;(Investigate the third glowing area)
:'''Tadhla:''' What is that? Let's take a closer look.
:'''Tadhla:''' Paw prints... Ah, it's covered with sand. She landed here, apparently noticing that someone was following her...
:'''Paimon:''' Tadhla really has good eyesight.

;(After investigating all 3 areas)
:'''Tadhla:''' I can smell the lair. Yes, it is right there.
:'''Tadhla:''' Well then, let's go.
----
;(Apprach the Red Vulture's lair)
:'''Tadhla:''' This is her lair.
:'''Tadhla:''' Red Vultures are careful and wicked by nature. She's probably sensed the danger and fled already, leaving us an empty lair.
:'''Tadhla:''' Now we must wait with patience.
:{{DIcon}} When will the Red Vulture return?
::'''Tadhla:''' Not until she no longer feels in danger... Also, even if she senses our presence in the lair, she'd still be forced back here by the piercing cold of midnight.
:{{DIcon}} What's twinkling over there?
::'''Tadhla:''' "Fool's Gold." Red Vultures love collecting shiny stuff.
::'''Paimon:''' "Fool's Gold"... Hmm... Sounds like Fatui's hidden treasure...
::'''Liloupar:''' "Fool's Gold" are things that only simpletons would believe to be valuable.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon certainly wouldn't fall for that!
::'''Tadhla:''' Shh... You wouldn't want to have any of those. They are mostly commonplace alloys like brass and bronze that are not worth much.
:'''Tadhla:''' We will stay here and wait until midnight. Please have a rest if you are tired. I'll keep watch.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... The Red Vulture won't be back anytime soon. Why don't we check out the {{color|buzzword|shiny stuff}} first?

;(Talk to Tadhla - optional)
:'''Tadhla:''' ...She hasn't returned yet. Please stay put, or she'll be alarmed.

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Tadhla, optional)
:'''Tadhla:''' (...Don't think about it too much, Tadhla, you're just a Falcon...)

;(Approach the shiny stuff without waiting)
:'''Tadhla:''' What are you doing? Come back!

;(Approach the Red Vulture after waiting)
:'''Tadhla:''' Let's go.

;(After defeating the Red Vulture)
:'''Tadhla:''' You are such a talented hunter. No wonder Father commissioned you to help me with this hunt.
:'''Tadhla:''' Please leave the rest to me. If you really are interested in this, I can teach you step by step.
:{{DIcon}} Please teach me.
::'''Tadhla:''' Very well.

::'''Tadhla demonstrates how to dissect a prey. You and Paimon seem to have learned a new skill that you probably will never actually put into practice.'''

::'''After the demonstration, Tadhla shows you her hands soaked by the blood of her prey, a faint smile appearing on her lips.<br />This is the first time that she has revealed any trace of her emotions.'''
:{{DIcon}} Uh... I'll pass.
::'''Tadhla:''' Suit yourselves.

::'''Tadhla dissects the prey with great proficiency and wraps it up in a package.'''
:'''Tadhla:''' Hmm... The smell of blood. Good.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon can smell it, too! Uh... Such a strong smell... Aren't you going to wash it off?
:'''Tadhla:''' No, because we are going to hunt the Scorpion now.
:'''Liloupar:''' Scorpions are predators. They relish the smell of fresh blood.
:'''Tadhla:''' That's right.
:'''Paimon:''' Ohh... Alright... Paimon will hold her breath anyway!
:'''Tadhla:''' Do you need more rest or should we set out right now?
:'''Tadhla:''' It's decently chilly in this lair, our prey's meat should be able to stay overnight and not go bad... We could spend the night here to avoid the cold outside.
:'''Paimon:''' Sounds good to Paimon! The temperature feels just right in here. Let's all just get some good rest for the night!
:'''Liloupar:''' It appears that the little one desires to be slothful again.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph, Paimon knows when she feels cold and tired! Not everyone is immune to temperature changes like you!

:'''Tadhla fetches some desert poplar branches and dried feces. Soon, a simple campfire is built.<br />Sitting and bathing in its warm light, you all share filling quantities of food and water with each other.<br />Watching the campfire dancing and crackling, you find yourselves absent of any topics to discuss...'''

:'''Tadhla:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} About Masseira...
::'''Tadhla:''' He is my father. I am his "Falcon."
::{{DIcon}} ...
:::'''Tadhla:''' ...
::{{DIcon}} And...?
:::'''Tadhla:''' Talking the talk is the doings of parrots. Falcons only walk the walk.
:{{DIcon}} About you...
::'''Tadhla:''' About me...?
::'''Tadhla:''' There's nothing much to say about me... Are you sure you want to know more about me?
::{{DIcon}} Is that so strange?
:::'''Tadhla:''' I am a Falcon. I am only allowed to learn about my prey, not any other way around.
:::'''Tadhla:''' So... I am sorry, but I will not betray myself to you.
:::'''Liloupar:''' Be that so? Some advice to you, child: Think for yourself.
::{{DIcon}} I want to know what kind of person I am working with.
:::'''Tadhla:''' "Person"? No. A "Falcon"? Yes.
:::'''Tadhla:''' Please rest assured. I will not disobey you or leave you behind. It is Father who entrusted me to you.
:::'''Liloupar:''' Heh... A blind-folded Falcon. In what world would she care about how beautiful she is?
:'''Tadhla:''' Did you rest well? Are we ready to go?
:{{DIcon}} Let's go and continue the hunt.
::'''Tadhla:''' Please follow me.
:{{DIcon}} I have some other things to do. I'll be back later.
::'''Tadhla:''' Suit yourselves.
;(Obtain [[Red Vulture's Feather]])

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Tadhla, optional)
:'''Tadhla:''' (...Don't think about it too much, Tadhla, you're just a Falcon...)
----
;(Approach the makred area)
:'''Liloupar:''' Paimon, you've been holding your nose the whole time.
:'''Paimon:''' Because it stinks of blood...
:'''Liloupar:''' But all the scents that greet me are from wild creatures... Ah, it is not so foul.
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, speaking of which, where "is" your nose?
:'''Liloupar:''' Hmph, be silent...

;(Approach the marked area)
:'''Tadhla:''' Here we are.
:'''Tadhla:''' Scorpions are only active under the veil of night. There is still some time before the night falls. Why don't we plan how we hunt the Scorpion?
:'''Tadhla:''' First option, we can mix the secretions of Sand Grease Pupa with a few ground poisonous mushrooms. Secretions of Sand Grease Pupa should lure the Scorpion to take the bait, then ground poisonous mushrooms can paralyze the Scorpion.
:'''Tadhla:''' The toxin is not strong enough to kill it, but would very well suffice to immobilize it.
:'''Tadhla:''' Or, we can mash up a mixture of Henna Berries and viper venom. Then make some poisonous bait by adding fresh meat into the mush. We fight fire with fire.
:'''Tadhla:''' But viper venom is a rare resource. It'll be a huge waste to use it all for the bait... I'll adjust the portions to make sure the bait is just poisonous enough to weaken the Scorpion but not kill it.
:'''Tadhla:''' There's also a third method... Not a clever one though. We risk our lives to hunt it down without any of preparation.
:'''Tadhla:''' But this method has its merits, too. It avoids any contamination so that we can extract the purest Scorpion venom.
:'''Tadhla:''' I'll leave the final choice to you. Please take your time.
:'''Tadhla:''' Oh, one more thing. When fighting with the Scorpion, we must be very careful. Its toxin can be lethal.
:{{DIcon}} Let's use the paralyzing poisonous bait.
::'''Tadhla:''' Very well... Are there any cuts or scratches on your hands?

::'''Tadhla prepares the poisonous bait carefully as you wait patiently in the cave until the moon rises...'''

::'''Tadhla:''' It's working. Let's go!
:{{DIcon}} Let's use the viper venom bait.
::'''Tadhla:''' Be careful and don't cut yourself. It'll be a disaster if viper venom gets into your body.

::'''Tadhla prepares the poisonous bait carefully as you wait patiently in the cave until the moon rises...'''

::'''Tadhla:''' It has been weakened. Let's go!
:{{DIcon}} I don't need any bait.
::'''Tadhla:''' Then I will watch your back.

;(Talk to Tadhla)
:'''Tadhla:''' We need to wait patiently... They should've smelled the blood, but they wont be active before the night falls.

;(After hiding)
:'''Tadhla:''' It's here. Let's go!

;(After defeating the first scorpion)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh!? How is there another one?

;(After defeating the second scorpion)
:'''Tadhla:''' ...Thank you. You didn't have to do this for me.
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
::'''Tadhla:''' I'm fine.
::'''Paimon:''' You are bleeding...
::'''Tadhla:''' It's nothing. Just a scratch.
:{{DIcon}} Are you hurt?
::'''Tadhla:''' No... Um... Just a little bit, but it doesn't matter.
::'''Paimon:''' Don't push yourself too hard.
::'''Tadhla:''' I won't. Thank you, Paimon.
:'''Tadhla:''' Alright... Next up, dissection.
:{{DIcon}} Can I take a look?
::'''Tadhla:''' ...?
::'''Tadhla:''' Pfft...
::'''Paimon:''' Eh? What's so funny?
::'''Liloupar:''' Pretty uncommon for a Falcon, I would say.
::'''Tadhla:''' It's just... It's kind of funny when you suddenly asked to see how I dissect the Scorpion.
::'''Tadhla:''' I barely know anyone else who is as interested in taking apart prey as you are. Or are you interested in this for some other reason?
::{{DIcon}} I'm just worried that your hands might shake.
::'''Tadhla:''' They do not shake when I hunt. Nor will they shake when I harvest my prey.
::'''Tadhla:''' No need to worry. I am a "Falcon," after all...

::'''Tadhla slowly cuts the Scorpion open, harvests its poison glands, and removes the useless organs, and carefully wraps them up in separate packages.<br />While doing this, her hands are nimble and steady, as if playing a soundless musical instrument that is made of blood and chitin.<br />...It is only a short while before she finishes the dissection.'''

::'''After all this work, Tadhla lets out a long breath.<br />Her forehead is dotted with tiny beads of sweat, her breaths tremulous... Her fresh wound must really hurt.'''
:{{DIcon}} You should take a break.
::'''Tadhla:''' No... If not preserved properly, the poison glands will spoil in the air and become useless.

::'''Tadhla harvests the Scorpion with ease, removing its poison glands and useless organs, then carefully wraps them up in separate packages.<br />After that, she shows you her stained hands without a change of expression on her face. Somehow you feel that she is trying to prove something to you...'''
:'''Tadhla:''' See? It's just a scratch. For a Falcon, it's nothing to worry about.
:'''Tadhla:''' Alright, we still need to hunt the Flying Serpent. Let's go.
:'''Tadhla:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Tadhla, you don't look so well. Do you need some rest?
:'''Tadhla:''' I'm fine.
:'''Liloupar:''' Falcons get injured, too. There's no need to be ashamed of such facts, little one.
:'''Tadhla:''' I'm not.
;(Obtain [[Scorpion's Sting]])
----
;(Enter the Flying Serpent's cave)
:'''Liloupar:''' Wait... I feel it... The familiar... pain.
:'''Liloupar:''' It is my soul, my fragments... One is around here...
:'''Tadhla:''' This place is a habitat for flying serpents. Seems this oasis is powered by one of the Jinni's fragments and has become an ecosystem for them...
:'''Liloupar:''' That's right. Uh... No, I can't sense the fragment due to the interference of the flying serpents here. Their scents are too thick, too pungent...
:'''Paimon:''' Then let's go deep and take them down!
:'''Tadhla:''' Yes...
:'''Liloupar:''' I guess you wanted to say "Let's go!" but you'd better stand down and take a break.
:'''Tadhla:''' ...I'll check the Flying Serpent up ahead.
:'''Tadhla:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Tadhla! Are you alright?
:'''Tadhla:''' *pant* Yes...
:'''Liloupar:''' She means to say that "It hurts."
:'''Tadhla:''' I... Do not...
:{{DIcon}} It's okay. Let me do it.
::'''Paimon:''' Yes, you should get some rest!
:{{DIcon}} Leave the rest to me.
::'''Paimon:''' Yes, from now on, you can totally count on us! Umm, Paimon means you can totally count on (Traveler)!
:'''Tadhla:''' ...

;(Talk to Tadhla - optional)
:'''Tadhla:''' *pant* If you need my assistance... please let me know, anytime.
:{{DIcon}}You should have a rest here.
::'''Tadhla:''' ...
:{{DIcon}}Your condition is not suitable for hunting.
::'''Tadhla:''' Hmph...

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Tadhla, optional)
:'''Tadhla:''' (...So thirsty... and hurting... and cold...)

;(After defeating the Flying Serpent)
:'''Tadhla:''' Sorry for not being helpful...
:'''Paimon:''' Don't say that, you deserve some rest! There's nothing wrong with us helping out when you're not feeling so well. We're friends after all!
:'''Tadhla:''' I am but a Falcon of Masseira's.
:{{DIcon}} And a friend of ours.
::'''Tadhla:''' ...
::'''Tadhla:''' Fine.
:{{DIcon}} We see you only as our friend.
::'''Tadhla:''' ...
::'''Tadhla:''' Thank you.
:'''Liloupar:''' Ah... Pardon me, my master, but I... sense my fragment nearby.
:'''Tadhla:''' ...It's okay. I'll go take care of our prey.
;(Obtain [[Flying Serpent's Horn]])

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Tadhla, optional)
:'''Tadhla:''' (...I must not show weakness, or look afraid...)

;(Talk to Tadhla - optional)
:'''Tadhla:''' Did you finish dealing with the Jinn matter?
:{{DIcon}}Not yet...
::'''Tadhla:''' Please don't worry about me. I'm still busy with something...
:{{DIcon}}How is your wound? Is it getting better?
::'''Tadhla:''' Yes, it doesn't hurt anymore. *grunt* It's okay now.

;(Obtain Liloupar's fragment)
:'''As the shard of light merges with Liloupar's magic bottle, you feel a little of your own power being pulled away...'''

:'''Through the Jinni's entranced eyes, you see a vortex of decay and betrayal...<br />The Spirit of Victory fell into madness due to a signet ring most dark, and in a series of tragedies, Queen Shirin brewed the honey-colored catastrophe before her mind yielded to hysteria...<br />The people turned against each other, and the Jinn scattered across the lands... Broken souls became fuel to a titanic machine, and the mindless descendants of the Seelie were degraded into slaves of infinite power...'''

:'''Then, the merciless era of the Spirit of Victory began... The crazed king and the nobles rejoiced in their superiority...<br />Yet none were aware that all the happenings within Gurabad were created by the scheming hands of the Mother of the Jinn...'''

:'''Liloupar:''' My master, are you feeling alright?
:{{DIcon}} It's... Gurabad. Again...
:{{DIcon}} My head really hurts...
:'''Liloupar:''' Apologies. Experiencing a Jinni's memories is not necessarily always a pleasant experience.
:{{DIcon}} Liloupar, what have you done...
:'''Liloupar:''' What have I done? You should see what they have done... With just a nudge, they would have cast themselves down the vile path toward certain ruination.
:'''Liloupar:''' The fall of Gurabad... is just a prologue. I merely revealed what torments await.
:'''Liloupar:''' Alright, now is not the time for such a topic... Your friends are waiting for you to wake up.
:'''Paimon:''' Are you awake? Can you not always scare Paimon to death!?
:'''Tadhla:''' Oh, you are finally awake. Paimon was so worried about you...
:'''Paimon:''' So was Tadhla! When you fell unconscious, she was really nervous and almost cried! Paimon thinks you owe Tadhla an apology!
:'''Tadhla:''' I was not...
:{{DIcon}} I didn't mean to make you worry, Tadhla. I'm sorry.
::'''Tadhla:''' ...
::'''Tadhla:''' A hunter does not apologize to a Falcon.
::'''Tadhla:''' It's nothing.
::{{DIcon}} How is your wound now?
:{{DIcon}} Please don't push yourself too hard.
::'''Tadhla:''' It's nothing.
::{{DIcon}} How is your wound now?
:'''Tadhla:''' Hmm... It's been better. Let's head back.
:'''Liloupar:''' She's shaking, as if having a fever... It's the Scorpion's toxin. I know it well.
:'''Liloupar:''' It is not lethal. But the effects are still deleterious in pain and harm... She will need to rest.
:'''Tadhla:''' No need. I'm okay.
:'''Liloupar:''' For now, perhaps. Yet, time is like a fraying blade in the desert. Soon, the toxins and the heat will unite against your flesh, inflicting dehydration, and drawing you closer to the rapids of demise.
:'''Tadhla:''' ...
:'''Liloupar:''' A good Falcon knows to cherish their life. Or they will become a burden and be eliminated. Be you a foolish Falcon, child?
:'''Tadhla:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' That's enough, Liloupar. Don't be so harsh to her! And Tadhla, stop treating yourself this way... We really should get some rest before we go!
:{{DIcon}} Liloupar has a point.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon's right.
:'''Tadhla:''' Ah... I'm sorry.
:'''Paimon:''' There is no need to apologize! This cave should be able to block out the cold winds at night. Let's set up a campfire right here!
:'''Tadhla:''' Good idea... Let me help... *grunt*
:'''Paimon:''' Don't worry, we got this. We're experts when it comes to building a campfire!

:'''You build a simple campfire and cook some food together with Paimon.<br />Tadhla drinks some water and falls asleep soon...<br />Her body is mildly over-warm. Under the influence of the dehydration and fatigue inflicted by the Scorpion's venom, Tadhla sinks into a deep slumber. You can tell that the pain is wearing off on her...'''

:'''After some time, the morning sun lights up the scarlet desert...<br />The sun is up, and you all wake up as the morning dew dries up in sunlight's heat.'''

:'''Tadhla:''' Time to get up. Let's go.
:'''Paimon:''' You look a lot better, Tadhla. How are you feeling?
:'''Tadhla:''' I'm feeling much better now... Come on, let's go.
:'''Liloupar:''' Pretty soon the day will be searing hot under the sun. If we want to return to the tribe safe and sound, we need to go now.

:'''Tadhla:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? What's wrong Tadhla? Are you still feeling unwell?
:'''Tadhla:''' No, I'm great.
:'''Liloupar:''' Should you bear words, give them unto my master now.
:'''Tadhla:''' ...
:'''Tadhla:''' I... I am very happy to hunt with you.
:'''Tadhla:''' Thank you.
:'''Liloupar:''' Well... that's a first for a Falcon.
----
;(Talk to Masseira)
:'''Masseira:''' Ah, esteemed master of the Jinni! And eh... Hmm. I see you have both returned.
:{{DIcon}} (Hand over the prey)
:'''Masseira:''' A little later than I expected. What happened, my little Falcon?
:'''Tadhla:''' It's embarrassing to say. I... I got injured. But thanks to the Master of the Jinni, I'm okay now.
:'''Masseira:''' ...
:'''Masseira:''' Good, very good. It's good to see you're alright.
:'''Masseira:''' Esteemed Master of the Jinni, did my Falcon hold you back?
:{{DIcon}} Tadhla has done me a big favor.
::'''Masseira:''' Is that so...
::'''Masseira:''' Very well. Thank you very much.
:{{DIcon}} We had a great time.
::'''Masseira:''' Oh, a great time?
::'''Masseira:''' Very well. Thank you very much.
:{{DIcon}} Please do not have such doubts. Tadhla is extremely capable.
::'''Masseira:''' I know that, of course. She's my Falcon, after all.
:'''Masseira:''' But... Falcons belong to hunters, not the earth. Once Falcons get attached to the world, their senses and claws will be dull. If that happens, how can I expect them to hunt for me?
:'''Paimon:''' That doesn't make any sense to Paimon... But hearing you going on and on about Falcons surely makes Paimon irritated!
:'''Paimon:''' Tadhla is human, and our friend! Not some sort of so-called "Falcon"!
:'''Masseira:''' "Friend," huh?
:'''Tadhla:''' No... It's not like that...
:'''Masseira:''' I will deal with you later.
:'''Masseira:''' Haha, please, don't get me wrong! I am most happy that my little Falcon has made some new friends! Truly, I am.
:'''Masseira:''' Here, this is your payment. Please do come find me later. I'll probably have other commissions for you.
:'''Tadhla:''' ...
:'''Masseira:''' ...
:'''Masseira:''' My little Falcon, let's talk about your next "hunt," shall we?

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Masseira, optional)
:'''Masseira:''' (...Before the mist of the morning, before the mirage of the noon, my Falcon takes off...)

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Tadhla, optional)
