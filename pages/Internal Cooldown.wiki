'''Internal Cooldown''' (ICD) is a mechanism that regulates how often an ability can apply an element for elemental reactions or elemental auras on a target.

==Overview==
ICD is counted based on a timer and a hit counter.

For most character abilities, the standard ICD is '''2.5''' seconds or '''3''' hits. This means that the ICD is reset either after 2.5 seconds have passed or after 3 hits of the particular move are made. Note:
* The first hit after the 3-hit sequence will apply an element, but does ''not'' reset the 2.5 second timer.
* The first hit after the timer will apply an element, reset the timer, and reset the hit sequence.

Some characters' abilities may have special ICDs or no ICD at all. Some ICDs may lack a hit counter, but a timer is always present.

Note that ICD is counted separately for each attacker and each target.

For an in-depth explanation of the properties that handle ICD, see [[Internal Cooldown/Data]].

For example, in [[Yoimiya]]'s Normal Attack sequence, she will shoot 7 arrows over the course of around 2.5 seconds,<!--the 7th shot can occur after the 2.5 second timer, depending on attack speed--> and she can infuse her attacks with Pyro by casting her Elemental Skill. When she attacks a [[Cryo Hypostasis]], which has a permanent Cryo aura, because of the ICD, not every shot will trigger a [[Melt]] reaction: only the 1st, 4th, and 7th will trigger Melt, as per the 3-hit rule.

Note that the 1st Melt shot will start the ICD 2.5 second timer. The 2nd and 3rd shots do not melt because they were made in less than 2.5 seconds since the 1st shot. Although the 4th shot was also within the 2.5 second window, it melts because of the 3 hit rule (it is the third hit made after the 1st shot).

Moreover, ''after'' the 2.5 second timer expires, the next shot Yoimiya makes will Melt, regardless of where in the 3-hit attack sequence Yoimiya is, and start a new 2.5 second timer.

==General Patterns==
{{Main|Internal Cooldown/Data}}
* A single character usually has separate ICDs for different abilities or different components of a single talent.
** However, sometimes multiple different abilities will share the same ICD.

Specifically:
* For most Bow, Catalyst and Polearm users, the ICD for Normal and Charged Attacks are separate.
** Exception: For [[Xiao]], the ICDs for Normal and Charged Attacks are shared.
* For most Claymore and Sword users, the ICD for Normal and Charged Attacks are shared.
** Exception: For [[Kamisato Ayaka]] and [[Kamisato Ayato]], the ICDs for Normal and Charged Attacks are separate.
* [[Plunging Attack]]s do not have ICD.
* The ICD for bow users' charged shots varies between specific characters.
