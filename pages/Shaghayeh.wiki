:'''Shaghayeh:''' Hello, are you a visitor here too?
:{{DIcon}} Is this a popular tourist attraction?
::'''Shaghayeh:''' Haha, I'm sorry to say that it isn't. This is just a private residence.
::'''Shaghayeh:''' People visit here from time to time because this place was designed by a [[Kaveh|famous architect]].
::'''Shaghayeh:''' But it's still a private residence, so please forgive me for being unable to give you an indoor tour.
::'''Shaghayeh:''' Oh... I almost forgot. Please don't spread the word about this location.
::'''Shaghayeh:''' While the [[Dori|Lord]] doesn't mind people taking a tour of the garden, this place was priced for the peace and quiet away from the hubbub of the world. So, I hope you understand.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
