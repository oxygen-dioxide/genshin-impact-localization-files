|description  = A ring that seems to have existed for a long time. Though it has become dull due to erosion over time, it is not dirty because it has been stored inside a box.
There are words engraved on the inside of the ring, still clearly legible:

"All beings suffer in war."

The '''Dull Ring''' is a quest item obtained from the Precious Chest inside the ruins at the end of the [[World Quest]] "[[Nine Pillars of Peace]]."

It can be sold to [[Bolai]] for 180,000 Mora and (regular) [[Adeptus' Temptation]] ×5, or to [[Linlang]] for 200,000 Mora.

The inscription on the ring reads, "Disaster runs rampant throughout the world, and all who live do so in agony."
