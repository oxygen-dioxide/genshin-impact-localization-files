'''Deep Gallery's Distant Pact''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Finale of the Deep Galleries]].

==Description==
Following her [[Surtalogi|master]]'s guidance, the [[Skirk|girl]] ventured northward, traversing the freezing wastelands and the corridor of fractured mirrors at the edge of the frozen sea.<br>After slaying countless monsters that wandered the ruins, finally, among the [[Abyss]]al remnants, she caught a glimpse of treasure concealed beneath drifting snow.

Yet she was not the first outsider to set foot here, for long before the scions of the far north had woven their sweet dream of submergence,<br>A [[voyager]], whose sentient will traversed the cosmos, once made a vow of reunion with a [[Nibelung|lord of dragons]] who had yet to fall into darkness.

This passerby was a scribe drifting through the vast void, duty-bound never to commune with primordial civilizations.<br>As her undying body slumbered away within a distant celestial disk-construct, her mind had drifted through an empty expanse spanning many light years,<br>Charting countless peoples and civilizations fated to perish, pondering the ultimate truths of the cosmos in that eternal darkness.<br>Until a faint glimmer pierced her awareness, jolting the voyager from tenfold millennia of meditation. 

It came from an unremarkable [[Teyvat|little world]] at the edge of the spiral arm &mdash; and from the primeval [[dragon]] that had been born alongside that world.<br>Though death would one day bring an endless night, and the sun it gazed upon was but a fleeting ember,<br>This will, bound though it was to its planetary crust, shone more brilliantly than all the civilizations the voyager had ever seen.<br>Unable to suppress the wonder and sorrow welling up from within, she delivered a solemn pronouncement unto its ruler: 

"I have seen the lightless end, tearing through star clusters like a spindle among silken threads."<br>"I have seen how the cold tide of chaos drowns out all songs, so that good and evil alike vanish into silence."<br>"And yet, my kind, gentle king, will you still refuse to abandon your people?"<br>"Forsake this world, fated for ruin, and journey with me beyond the stars."

Yet thus did the proud dragon reply:<br>"O friend from a distant world, I thank you for imparting these truths from beyond the skies."<br>"But though in your eyes they may seem ignorant creatures, to me, they are the very meaning of this universe."<br>"If the tide of oblivion must come, then let my bones be the bulwark that shields this realm."<br>"Bear witness to the path I have chosen, for I shall lead my people onward to the stars."

But when the voyager returned once more, the world she remembered had been utterly changed.<br>The bones of the earth had been bound beneath [[Four Shades|fourfold shackles]], and the soft [[Light Realm|white radiance]] of the sky had been split into [[Element|seven immutable hues]].<br>Like drifting smoke had the lord of dragons vanished, and the [[Heavenly Principles|Winged One]]'s throne now ruled the radiance of the [[Aria, Sonnet and Canon|three moons]]. 

Bewildered by the dragon's unannounced departure, yet unwilling to disturb the world's new ruler,<br>The voyager, defying the laws of her kin, quietly cast her mind into the world inside the [[False Sky|shell]].<br>Vesting her consciousness in the body of a youth, she walked among these chordate animals,<br>Listening to their fervent and ever-escalating debates in this [[Hyperborea|city of gold]]...
