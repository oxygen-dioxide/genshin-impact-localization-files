==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sumac:''' We meet again! How have you been?
:{{DIcon}} Not bad. You?
::'''Sumac:''' Things have been pretty good lately! It was only after I came here that I realized I wasn't doing too badly in the first place. Everyone's so kind, and they've given me loads of helpful advice and encouragement.
::'''Sumac:''' Hehe, seems like leaving my hometown had its silver lining after all!
:{{DIcon}} We've had some slight hitches...
::'''Sumac:''' Ah, I see... Well, I wish I could give you some advice, but the truth is, you've seen far more of the world than I have, so I don't think it would help.
::'''Sumac:''' Maybe you should just put aside your worries for now and have some fun. Like getting something nice to eat, a dip in a hot spring, and a good night's sleep!
::'''Sumac:''' Your problems will still be there when you wake up, sure, but at least you'll face them full of energy, right?
:{{DIcon}} Anyway, about what happened before...
::'''Sumac:''' I hadn't expected this many twists in the tale... In the end, it's hard to say who was right and who was wrong. Perhaps things were more complicated than I thought.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Maybe everyone was at fault, but not completely.
:::'''Sumac:''' It's very hard to say. *sigh* Perhaps I'd be better off if I just stopped thinking about it. Oh, and by the way... Mr. [[Tenehua]] came looking for me earlier, so I just told him everything as it was. Would that have helped?
:::'''Sumac:''' As I see it, you're the one who deserves the credit here. But you must be used to running around like this, right? Anyway, take these &mdash; I'm sure they'll come in handy!
:::;(Obtain {{Item|Grainfruit|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} Let's chat again sometime.
::'''Sumac:''' Alright then, take care!
