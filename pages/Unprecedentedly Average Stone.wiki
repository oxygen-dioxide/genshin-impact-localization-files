|description    = The literati of [[Liyue]] are always capable of finding the fun in life, and will always endeavor to coin charming names for all manner of things in the world around them.<br />Sadly, this poor stone proved simply too ordinary even for them. After scouring the pages of every known ancient text and reviewing every rumor, legend, and folktale they could find, not a single story was identified that made any kind of reference to this stone. Hence, for lack of a historical homage to draw on for inspiration, they named it the "Unprecedentedly Average Stone."
