|description     = Seasoned mashed potatoes.
|desc_suspicious = Some unmashed chunks have been mixed into the lot, adding a measure of unwanted randomness to the dish.
|desc_basic      = The potatoes were thoroughly mashed before a sauce was drizzled over them. The mouthfeel is soft and smooth and it has a rich, multi-layered flavor profile. A satisfying choice for a hungry stomach, whether as a side or as a main dish.
|desc_delicious  = As you take a bite of this fine potato mash, an intense flavor develops on your tongue that is mixed with its natural freshness and the taste of dairy. Such a graceful flavor can hardly be thought to have emerged from an ingredient as plebeian as potatoes.
