==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Kurisu's real name is Christopher and he hails from [[Fontaine]], although he changed his name to Kurisu when he arrived in Inazuma. [[Kaiser]], a cat seen near him, is apparently quite attached to him. He is acquainted with [[Thoma]].

Kurisu eventually became the president of the [[International Trade Association]], a trading group based in Ritou that sells foreign goods into Inazuma. After the [[Sakoku Decree]] was enacted, Kurisu and the others' quality of life began to decline due to harsh treatment by the [[Kanjou Commission]], who would intimidate them into paying higher taxes and not investigate claims of stolen goods. Eventually, he and the other merchants were forced to use [[Crystal Marrow]] as payment.

Thoma, who greeted the [[Traveler]] upon their arrival to Inazuma, had them help Kurisu with his problem.

During [[Kamisato Ayaka|Ayaka's]] Story Quest, she and the Traveler approached Kurisu for silk. He told them that the silk was stolen by vagrants. Ayaka assisted him in reclaiming the stolen goods and he gave them some of the silk in gratitude.

After the [[Hiiragi Shinsuke|Kanjou Commissioner]] is revealed to have taken part in the instability plaguing Inazuma, he is arrested and replaced. Kurisu was delighted by the change as the Kanjou Commission began to treat him and his fellow merchants on better terms, remaining resolved to continue trade and helping newcomers.

===Personality===
Kurisu is a kind and honest merchant who tries to appease others, preferring to avoid violence whenever possible. Even with an advantage, he is not too demanding, only taking what he deemed is enough for him and his fellow merchants to survive. He also tries his best to help outsiders coming in to Ritou.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Kurisu:''' Oh? Do you require the assistance of the International Trade Association? Please, do tell.
:{{DIcon}} About yourself...
::'''Kurisu:''' I'm Kurisu from Fontaine. My real name is actually Christopher, but I've been here so long that it seemed suitable to change it to fit the local customs.
::'''Kurisu:''' I'm currently in charge of the International Trade Association. My main task is to be the bridge between everyone here and the Shogunate officials.
::'''Kurisu:''' We're all considered outlanders here regardless of where you're from, so we've got to take care of each other.
::'''Kurisu:''' It's not an easy life abroad for folks like us. Hahaha...
::{{DIcon}} About the outlanders in Ritou...
::;(Before completing [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]])
::::'''Kurisu:''' Agh, I hardly even want to talk about it. It's just getting more and more difficult nowadays...
::::'''Kurisu:''' Not only have they limited our trading time and locations, they've also added tax items for various reasons. The biggest headaches are those bureaucrats from the [[Kanjou Commission]].
::::'''Kurisu:''' Every now and then, they will come here and pick on us for whatever reason. It's just...
::::'''Kurisu:''' ...Ah, alas! Anyway, the merchant guild and I have dedicated ourselves to providing every outlander with support.
::::{{DIcon|Reward}} That sounds painful.
:::::'''Kurisu:''' Haha. There might be a few tricky problems here and there, but I get a boost of determination seeing everyone's smiling faces after the problem has been resolved.
:::::'''Kurisu:''' We live in an ever-changing world, so we need to be prepared for all kinds of situations. For the sake of the continued prosperity of the International Trade Association, there's still a lot of work that I need to do.
::::;(Obtain [[Guide to Prosperity]] ×1)
::;(After completing [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]])
::::'''Kurisu:''' Since the head of the Hiiragi Clan was removed from his post, all the affairs of the Kanjou Commission have been well-regulated.
::::'''Kurisu:''' Taxes were reduced, and the officials and soldiers made things less difficult for the merchants. Everyone is really relieved.
::::'''Kurisu:''' However, there is still a lot to be done here. The sources of goods, delivery routes and channels... There are still many things to settle.
::::'''Kurisu:''' Anyways, the Trade Association and I have dedicated ourselves to providing every outlander with support.
::;(After completing [[Transient Dreams]])
::::'''Kurisu:''' Since the head of the Hiiragi Clan was removed from his post, all the affairs of the Kanjou Commission have been well-regulated.
::::'''Kurisu:''' Taxes were reduced, and the officials and soldiers made things less difficult for the merchants. Everyone is really relieved, to be honest, and the number of merchants willing to set up shop here in Ritou has increased.
::::'''Kurisu:''' We've got quite a few new arrivals who aren't yet used to the paths through which goods may be sourced or transported, and so that's where we come in.
::::'''Kurisu:''' Anyway, the Trade Association and I have dedicated ourselves to providing every outlander with the support they need.
:{{DIcon}} It's been a while.
:;(After completing [[Woven Wishes]])
::'''Kurisu:''' Oh yes, it has been a while indeed, Traveler. How's everything?
::'''Kurisu:''' You have been doing the International Trade Association a great many favors. I deeply appreciate it. If you need anything, I will try my best to help you out.
::'''Kurisu:''' If it's not too much, could you also help send my regards to Miss Kamisato? If you and Miss Kamisato need anything here, feel free to come find me.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Kurisu:''' You too. Our doors are always open to friendly outlanders.

==Event Dialogue==
===Hues of the Violet Garden===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Kurisu:''' Recently, there's been quite a few outlanders who have come to Ritou specifically to take part in the Irodori Festival. As such, it's up to us here in the International Trade Association to welcome them warmly.
:'''Kurisu:''' From the moment we were notified that Ritou would be the festival site, which would be excellent for business, everyone's spirits really picked up.
:'''Kurisu:''' Whether you may have goods to sell or if you'd just like to know more about the festival events, feel free to ask me.
:'''Kurisu:''' So, is there anything I can help with? Do tell.
