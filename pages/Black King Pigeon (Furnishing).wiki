|description    = A common avian species in [[Teyvat]]. Plump and meaty, but can also be trained to deliver messages.<br>A relatively common pigeon that takes its name from its black-colored head. It is braver and more prone to confrontation than other birds in the pigeon family, making it easier to catch. According to the rules, animals in the Realm Within cannot fight to the death but can fight each other competitively. As a result, the black pigeons can be seen fighting other animals, and legend has it that the Black King Pigeon can even fend off a weasel that is harassing it.
