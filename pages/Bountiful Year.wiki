|description     = Luxurious and exquisite raw fish.
|desc_suspicious = The unevenly mixed fish and condiments are as bedraggled on the plate as any dejected sailor washed ashore by rolling waves, and they do not arouse your appetites at all. Yet it would be such a further waste of these ingredients if you did not eat them &mdash; ah, what a morbid dilemma.
|desc_basic      = The fish is sliced thinly and arranged in the shape of a flower before a ring of side dishes is set all around it. Normally, the side dishes will be mixed with the raw fish according to one's taste before consumption &mdash; this act is said to ensure that things will be smooth sailing in the coming days.
|desc_delicious  = The stacked raw fish is sliced as thin as cicada wings, and their taste is as light as mist, their pattern lines opal-white, like snow kissing the earth. One can hardly wait to dig in &mdash; the soft and smooth meat and myriad condiment flavors coalesce on the tongue, to the praise of all. Truly, this is the flavor experience to top them all!

==Gameplay Notes==
* Obtaining this dish from Linlang will not add it to the [[Archive]]; only a delicious variant cooked by the player will cause it to be added.

==Trivia==
* This dish is most likely a reference to {{Lang|{{w|Yusheng}}|zh=鱼生|zh_rm=Yúshēng}}, a type Cantonese-styled raw salad. This dish is normally eaten during Chinese New Year.
* The Chinese name of the dish, {{Zh|丰年有余|rm=Fēngnián Yǒuyú}}, is possibly a reference to the common New Year greeting {{Zh|{{wt|年年有餘#Chinese|年年有余}}|rm=niánnián yǒuyú}}, which means "to have abundance year after year."
* To celebrate Chinese New Year 2022, the [[Teyvat Food Notes]] released a [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/19846 real-life recipe] for Bountiful Year, featuring all the Liyue playable characters at the time. The blog post's story has each character contributing in some way to the making (and eating) of the dish.
