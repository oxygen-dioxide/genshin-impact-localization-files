Which is just as well &mdash; I haven't had cause for any private celebrations for a long time.

Hmm, how do you think I should approach a day such as this?

Haha, relax. I'm just fishing for your opinion. I am, unfortunately, not well-versed in matters of this sort.

How mysterious... When you're around, the truth just slips out of me at times. I must have had a glass too many, I fear.

Still, I suppose a little honesty with oneself couldn't hurt.

Want to have a few more drinks with me? I'll have the bartender bring you something non-alcoholic. Good drinks loosen lips, as they say.

Don't worry, I have plenty of stories... and plenty of time.
