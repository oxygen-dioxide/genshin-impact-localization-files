:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nahida! Paimon didn't think we'd run into you here.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Oh, hey there. It's been a while, hasn't it? What have you two been up to?
:{{DIcon}} Same old, same old. Adventuring and stuff...
:{{DIcon}} Helping all kinds of people.
:{{DIcon}} The usual... Mining, fishing, [[Genius Invokation TCG]], and catching [[Crystalflies]].
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hehe, seems like you've been enjoying yourselves.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How about you? What are you up to now?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I'm just out looking for some leads while getting some fresh air.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I noticed that I have some blurry memories after saving [[Irminsul]].
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I almost feel like there's still something extremely important I need to do... But I can't remember what it is.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, why is that?
:{{DIcon}} (It's probably the effects of Irminsul...)
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't worry, we'll help you remember.
:{{DIcon}} Feel free to fill us in.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe I can help.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Thank you so much. Since you're willing to help, I have something I'd like to show you.
:{{color|menu|Nahida shows you a strange crystal...}}
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oooh, it's beautiful! It looks like it's filled with some kind of power.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Mm-hmm. I found it in the [[Sanctuary of Surasthana]], but I have no recollection of it whatsoever.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's filled with pure elemental power that is quite similar to mine, but yet it's also a little different...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's very likely that it's connected to my foggy memory, but I can't figure out what it is.
:{{DIcon}} (It's most likely something that [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] left behind...)
:{{DIcon}} (But what's with her foggy memory?)
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, do you have any ideas?
:{{DIcon}} I don't know, but...
:{{DIcon}} It's very concerning.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm. You know, Nahida, we just happen to be going on an adventure right now. If we find anything, we'll be sure to let you know right away.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Thanks, you two. I didn't mean to trouble you again.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't mention it! Besides, it seems you've got a lot on your mind, and we'd like to help.
:{{color|menu|A Floating Hydro Fungus suddenly shows up at the nearby city gate...}}
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 hydrofungusa 01.ogg}} '''Floating Hydro Fungus:''' ...!

:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 layth 01.ogg}} '''Layth:''' Hey, get out! You shouldn't be around here!
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 hydrofungusa 03.ogg}} '''Floating Hydro Fungus:''' !
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 layth 02.ogg}} '''Layth:''' I'm sorry, Lesser Lord Kusanali. Fungi don't usually come near this place.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 layth 03.ogg}} '''Layth:''' Last warning, get out before I kick you out! You hear!?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hang on... I think it's trying to tell us something.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 layth 04.ogg}} '''Layth:''' But Great Dendro Archon, it's a monster.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Please, don't worry.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 hydrofungusa 04.ogg}} '''Floating Hydro Fungus:''' !
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hmm... I think I understand.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Seems that it wants us to follow it.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You could understand it?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 15.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Mm-hmm. Even though different creatures have varying habits and ways of communicating, the emotions we experience are all the same.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 16.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I can feel its anxiety and fear. It's in dire need of our help.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, Fungi are kinda cute, but...
;(If [[The Most Fantastic Tournament You've Never Heard Of?]] was not completed)
::{{DIcon}} It wouldn't hurt to take a look.
;(If [[The Most Fantastic Tournament You've Never Heard Of?]] was completed)
::{{DIcon}} Bongo-Head is a really nice Fungus, you know.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, that's true. Okay, let's go take a look.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 17.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Alright, lead the way, little Fungus.

;(After the cutscene)
:{{color|menu|You grow ever more curious about the Fungus guiding you...}}
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Although they all look about the same, some Fungi are friendly, while others are super aggressive and attack anyone they see.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 18.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It can't be helped. Perhaps in their eyes, humans are like fierce "monsters" as well.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 19.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' After all, they can't distinguish which human behaviors are hostile or not, and it'd already be too late for them once humans have drawn their weapons.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 20.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hence why they tend to strike first, rather than waiting.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's not too different from how humans think sometimes...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 21.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' That's what I meant by shared emotions.

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on the leading Floating Hydro Fungus, optional)
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 22.ogg}} '''Nahida''' (It seems to be anxious. Let's follow it and see where it leads.)

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on the waiting Floating Hydro Fungus, optional)
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 23.ogg}} '''Nahida''' (It seems to be anxious and afraid.)

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on the unconscious Floating Hydro Fungus, optional)
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 1 nahida 24.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' (Hmm? There's something strange about this Fungus...)
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|You and Paimon encounter Nahida at the gates of Sumeru City. She seems to be troubled by something she has forgotten, and in that moment, an unusually behaving Fungus appeared, seemingly willing you to follow it.}}

;(Approach the three Floating Hydro Fungi)
:{{color|menu|The strange Fungus guides you to two of its companions, one of whom appears to have fallen unconscious...}}

:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It appears it was in a hurry because of this unconscious Fungus.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, seems like they might be family.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So maybe this Fungus wanted to bring Nahida here to help its family member.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Probably. Although Fungi are simple creatures, they're very sensitive to elemental power.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Maybe it noticed me on my way back and thought I'd be able to help.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I'll take a look. I should be able to help if it's just a common illness...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hmm?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What is it, Nahida?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Strange... very strange...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' This Fungus didn't develop from a spore. It's an elemental life-form.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? An elemental life-form?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes. Although the Fungi you normally see are capable of using elemental powers, they're merely borrowing elemental power from nature around them.
:;([[Elemental Sight]] activates, highlighting the unconscious Fungus in green)
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' As for this Fungus... It has elemental power flowing through it. Definitely not anything like your typical Fungus.
:{{DIcon}} So you're saying...
:{{DIcon}} It only looks like a Fungus?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Exactly. This is very interesting, I've never seen anything like it.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So this is a first, even for Nahida...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But that's not all... there's a large void within its elemental power.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The void is stopping the elemental power from flowing normally, which must be why it fainted.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So do you think it'll wake up if we can fill the void?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes, and I just so happen to be good at this sort of thing. I'll see what I can do right away.

:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 hydrofunguslifeform 05.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Hello, Paimon. I am not yet able to evaluate an organism's intelligence from its appearance. I will only know you are able to speak once you have spoken.

:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But does Paimon really look so dumb that people might think Paimon doesn't know how to talk?
:{{DIcon}} There's no need to start worrying about that all of a sudden...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 hydrofunguslifeform 06.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' You misunderstand, Paimon. A mouth is used for eating, breathing, and other functions that are more important than speaking.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 hydrofunguslifeform 07.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' So a creature may not speak, even if it has a mouth. I've never seen a creature like you before, so I dared not make the assumption that you could speak.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 hydrofunguslifeform 08.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Even if you do possess a number of human traits, it is still very common for creatures to have similar external forms but completely different interiors &mdash; just like Fungi and Slimes.

:{{A|vo nhdlq101 2 hydrofunguslifeform 09.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' That's correct. This might be surprising to you, and I'm sure that you must have questions. Let's find somewhere else to talk.

:{{A|vo nhdlq101 3 hydrofunguslifeform 15.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' My home... should be safe now. We can go home...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 3 hydrofunguslifeform 16.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' For the longest time, this moment has only seemed like a dream... I never knew it would become a reality so quickly.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 3 hydrofunguslifeform 17.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' I was unable to fulfill our calling. I never found a way to save my homeland, and I have even forgotten where it is...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 3 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's not your fault. You've already done everything you can.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 3 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Every species paid a grave price in the fight against forbidden knowledge. This is not a responsibility you should carry on your own.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 3 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' You mentioned that there were other survivors besides yourself. Where are they? Maybe they'll remember.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 3 hydrofunguslifeform 18.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' The apocalypse put us through immense pain. Many of my family members have already met their end. I'm not sure who else is still alive...

:{{A|vo nhdlq101 3 hydrofunguslifeform 19.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Thank you, Lord of Dendro. We all believe that you will keep your promises.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 3 hydrofunguslifeform 20.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' The moment I saw you when I awoke, I had a feeling you were here because of the agreement.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 3 nahida 21.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hmm? Agreement?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 3 hydrofunguslifeform 21.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' You might not remember, but this is a prophecy that we deeply believe in... That the Lord of Dendro will bring us home once the catastrophe comes to an end.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 3 nahida 22.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Oh, I see... I&mdash;I'm sorry, there are also some blurry segments in my memory as well.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 3 nahida 23.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But I'm very concerned about your homeland. This is something I should help with, it's really no trouble to me at all.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 3 hydrofunguslifeform 22.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Would you all be willing to come with me somewhere as we wait?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 3 hydrofunguslifeform 23.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' The more family members that can return home with me... the better...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But didn't you say that you don't know where they are?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 3 hydrofunguslifeform 24.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Yes, but I know their "end." I will explain it to you along the way.

:{{A|vo nhdlq101 4 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' There's something that I'm very concerned about.
:{{DIcon}} Are you talking about that crystal?
:{{DIcon}} Are you talking about your fuzzy memories?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 4 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes. I didn't mention it just now, but do you remember when I told you that the power in the crystal is very similar to mine, yet also different?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 4 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The elemental power inside the crystal is completely identical to that of the Fungus.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!?
:{{DIcon}} There's a connection between the crystal and the Fungus...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 4 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Exactly. The prophecy that it mentioned was probably an agreement that I made with an elemental life-form that once represented its race.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 4 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I had to deal with the forbidden knowledge to save their homeland. The process, however, took away some of my memories.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 4 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' That sequence of events would explain the persistent feeling that I had unfinished business.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Makes sense... Too bad it's unable to tell us more.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 4 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yeah, I've been trying to think of a place that fits the description of its homeland, but I'm unable to come up with anything.
:{{DIcon}} We'll just have to continue investigating.

:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 hydrofunguslifeform 01.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Amazing. With such skills, you all would've definitely been able to find a way to survive the apocalypse.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Paimon has been meaning to ask &mdash; you all didn't originally look like this, did you?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 hydrofunguslifeform 02.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' No, we didn't. The appearance of our kind will change according to the environment.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 hydrofunguslifeform 03.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' After communicating with various living organisms in Sumeru, we discovered that Fungi are the life-form most adapted to live in these lands.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 hydrofunguslifeform 04.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Thus, we gradually took the form of Fungi and became a part of their group.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's hard to believe that's even possible!
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 hydrofunguslifeform 05.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' The most important instinct any life-form possesses is adapting to the environment. I don't think that should surprise you, Paimon.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 hydrofunguslifeform 06.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Your hand is shaped like that for a reason &mdash; so you are able to grip and use tools more easily.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 hydrofunguslifeform 07.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' The reason why Fungi absorb elemental power is to blend with the environment and fend off natural predators.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 hydrofunguslifeform 08.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' We are Dendro life-forms, one of the most ancient life-forms in this land. That is why we are so adaptable.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you mean... If Paimon wanted to, Paimon could change into a different form as well?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 hydrofunguslifeform 09.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Not as freely, I'm afraid. You would require a long time to make that happen.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 hydrofunguslifeform 10.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Although this is common sense to us, it is still extremely difficult to explain. Hmm... Putting it as simply as possible, changing form requires energy, and energy comes with time.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 hydrofunguslifeform 11.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' You cannot make a sprout grow into a giant tree instantly, nor can you force a tree to bear fruit overnight.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I see. Humans have a term for this, it's called "growth."
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh, you're so smart, Nahida! Paimon gets it now!
:{{DIcon}} Seems like it's pretty good at coming up with metaphors as well...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 hydrofunguslifeform 12.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' "Growth"... I see. Yes, then this is what you would call growth.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 hydrofunguslifeform 13.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' A most beautiful word. I shall enjoy it more as we walk.

;(While following the Elemental Being)
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How much farther is it?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 hydrofunguslifeform 14.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' We're about halfway there. You're doing great, Paimon. Do you need me to carry you on my back?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Oh, no, Paimon was just curious. Paimon isn't that tired.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hehe, you seem to enjoy taking care of others.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 hydrofunguslifeform 15.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' You think so? Does the Lord of Dendro need to be carried?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Erm... that would be awkward, wouldn't it? Why don't you fly up and sit on top of my head?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We can figure out who'll carry who later! We have monsters here!

;(After defeating the hilichurls)
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 6 hydrofunguslifeform 01.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Hmm, I think we may have a different understanding of "carrying" someone.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 6 hydrofunguslifeform 02.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' No matter whether it's tired or not, my child is always happy when I put it on my back and give it a ride.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Child? You mean the Fungi we ran into earlier?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 6 hydrofunguslifeform 03.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Yes. One was my friend, and the other was my child.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why can't your kid speak?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 6 hydrofunguslifeform 04.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Because it's just a Fungus. I don't want my presence to change or affect the original state of the Fungi species here.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 6 hydrofunguslifeform 05.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' However, it is slightly different from an ordinary Fungus. It seems to understand some human language, so I gave it a name.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, then it must be a really cute name!
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You know, like Bongo-Head!
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 6 hydrofunguslifeform 06.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Hmm, you have an odd taste for names.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Paimon thinks that name is great!
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 6 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Strange and cute at the same time. It's a name only Paimon would be able to come up with.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, that's right.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 6 hydrofunguslifeform 07.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' The name I came up with was not as creative as Paimon's. I learned it from an adventurer. It's...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 6 hydrofunguslifeform 08.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Its name is...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 6 hydrofunguslifeform 09.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' I'm sorry, but I've forgotten... *sigh* Seems like I've forgotten many important things.
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry. You can try and remember it on the way.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 6 hydrofunguslifeform 10.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Yes, I must remember it before I return. It's just as important as my homeland.

;(While following the Elemental Being)
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 6 hydrofunguslifeform 11.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Yes, this way. We're almost there.

;(Enter the Withering Zone)
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's... [[The Withering]]!
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 hydrofunguslifeform 01.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Yes, I have heard humans also call it that before.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 hydrofunguslifeform 02.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' It's the last form we take when we are at the end of our life.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, Paimon doesn't understand...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's trying to say that when they've suffered enough and reached the end of their life, they become a Tumor of the Withering.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 hydrofunguslifeform 03.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Yes. I would have also suffered the same fate if it wasn't for the Lord of Dendro's help.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So this is how "The Withering" is formed...?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Previous research has revealed that forbidden knowledge is the root cause of The Withering.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But even if forbidden knowledge has been completely removed, its influence still remains, which is why The Withering remains even after forbidden knowledge has disappeared.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' They've been tormented by forbidden knowledge for a long time. It's understandable that they will eventually become The Withering.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But what a sad and pitiful end...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 hydrofunguslifeform 04.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' When I left my homeland, flowers like these filled the fields. Each bloom represented an individual life.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 hydrofunguslifeform 05.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' They grew in the pristine lakes, in the fertile soil, in my home, and in the homes of my friends...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 hydrofunguslifeform 06.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' They grew everywhere. Until the world suddenly lost all its color and became tainted and murky.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 hydrofunguslifeform 07.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' But it's alright. Our life essence &mdash; elemental power &mdash; still resides in this flower.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 hydrofunguslifeform 08.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' After an adventurer clears The Withering, I will quietly draw near the area. If I can sense the elemental power of my companions, then I take them with me.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But that would mean the effects of forbidden knowledge could've...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 hydrofunguslifeform 09.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' It's okay. That's not important anymore. I just hope that they can all make it back home.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 hydrofunguslifeform 10.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' It's not right to leave them to simply perish in the open like this.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 hydrofunguslifeform 11.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Now that we finally have the chance to return home, each one I manage to bring back will make me that much happier.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I understand. Just leave it to us.
:{{DIcon}} I got this.
:{{DIcon}} This is a product of forbidden knowledge, after all.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' So you're worried about me...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hehe, it's fine. Forbidden knowledge doesn't exist anymore.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's natural to want to be over-cautious when dealing with a highly venomous snake, but when all that's left is its skeleton, there's nothing to worry about.
:{{DIcon}} ...If you say so.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, Paimon doesn't get what you two are talking about, but we're all ready to go now, right?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then let's do this! We've dealt with The Withering countless times already!

;(After clearing the Withering Zone)
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 8 hydrofunguslifeform 01.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' As I expected, it's the last of my kind that I'm aware of.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 8 hydrofunguslifeform 02.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' So it wasn't able to make it to the end. If only it could have held on just a little longer...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 8 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I hope that you will be free of this pain after returning home.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just thinking about how many elemental life-forms have turned into Tumors of the Withering makes Paimon sad.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 8 hydrofunguslifeform 03.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' It's okay. As long as elemental power still exists, then we will still be around.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 8 hydrofunguslifeform 04.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' An external form is but a gift of time. Through "growth" comes change, and even abandonment of previous forms. However, our true nature is not so easily affected.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 8 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It wouldn't have come to this if we were able to cure them earlier...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 8 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But I will cure all of them... even if it's just for the sake of the rainforest and all the life-forms that live in it.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 8 hydrofunguslifeform 05.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Thank you, Lord of Dendro. It was a wise choice for us to place our trust in you and wait.

:{{A|vo nhdlq101 8 hydrofunguslifeform 06.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' It must be in a similar situation as I was. We should hurry and go take a look.

:{{A|vo nhdlq101 9 hydrofunguslifeform 01.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' No fighting. These are all its family.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 9 hydrofunguslifeform 02.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Although we belong to different species, we've spent a long time living among the Fungi. They are very important to us.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 9 hydrofunguslifeform 03.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' They can be reasonable as long as we try to communicate.

:{{A|vo nhdlq101 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But you'll need Nahida's power if you want to save that Fungus.

:{{A|vo nhdlq101 9 hydrofunguslifeform 04.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' You want to transform into a Fungus? But we don't have time for growth...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nahida is a god. Changing into a Fungus should be a piece of cake for her.

:{{A|vo nhdlq101 9 hydrofunguslifeform 07.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' You will have to use power equal to that which is required to break through the limitations of time.

:{{A|vo nhdlq101 10 anemofunguslifeform 06.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus:''' The Dendro Dragon... Inside... Very big... Mountains... water... trees... us.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 10 hydrofunguslifeform 08.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' There is an entire world inside the Dendro Dragon's body. The Dendro Dragon nurtured the earliest life-forms, and protected us inside of itself.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 10 hydrofunguslifeform 09.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' It once told us in a majestic voice that once we've finally matured, we'd be able to start life in a new world.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 10 hydrofunguslifeform 10.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' However, that day never came. Our homeland was the greatest place there ever was before the apocalypse arrived.

:{{A|vo nhdlq101 10 hydrofunguslifeform 11.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Yes, a very good example. It appears that you're much smarter than Paimon. The only difference is that the Dendro Dragon is much, much larger than any Dendro Slime.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 10 nahida 16.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Wait... Then if that's the case... Doesn't that imply that Apep has also been contaminated by forbidden knowledge?

:{{A|vo nhdlq101 10 hydrofunguslifeform 13.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' What has suddenly made you look so worried, Lord of Dendro? I haven't seen this expression on you before.

:{{A|vo nhdlq101 10 nahida 19.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I'm afraid so... Its body and soul have probably been in terrible shape for some time now.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 10 nahida 20.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' No wonder I haven't seen Apep for so long. But how did it get contaminated...? Was it due to the destruction of [[King Deshret]]'s civilization?

:{{A|vo nhdlq101 10 nahida 22.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes! How could I have forgotten!?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 10 nahida 23.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' If the Dendro Dragon fails to hang on, the elemental power inside it will no longer be able to maintain its form, and will all be dispersed.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 10 nahida 24.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Dendro elemental power of that concentration will cause the rainforest to overgrow...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 10 nahida 25.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Giant trees will completely block out the sun... Plants and humans will fight over oxygen... Sumeru will no longer be suitable for sustaining life!

:{{A|vo nhdlq101 11 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Sumeru was Apep's territory. In those days, the lush rainforest covered the entire nation.

:{{A|vo nhdlq101 12 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hmm, it appears we are out of leads to follow... And if no one knows how this crystal works, then Apep may be in danger.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 12 anemofunguslifeform 04.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Anemo Fungus:''' Sorry.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 12 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's okay, it isn't your fault. I don't think it's a coincidence that neither of you can remember anything about the crystal.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 12 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Maybe it's because the crystal has a very close connection to forbidden knowledge which causes memories of it to be unclear.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 12 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' And if that's the case, finding the other Fungi still wouldn't help us at all.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 12 hydrofunguslifeform 04.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Hmm. The crystal and the apocalypse... The apocalypse and memories...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 12 hydrofunguslifeform 05.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' Lord of Dendro, do you still remember the prophecy?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 12 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Mm-hmm, I do. What about it?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 12 hydrofunguslifeform 06.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' The prophecy is a story that connects events of the past and the future. A family member once said that the apocalypse is a part of us and that there is value in preserving it.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 12 hydrofunguslifeform 07.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' The rest of the family did not approve of its opinion at the time, so it left.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 12 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Preserving the apocalypse? Do you mean that there's still some that hasn't been eliminated?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 12 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' That's not very likely. The power of Irminsul covers every inch of the land.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 12 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Did the prophecy say where that family member went?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 12 hydrofunguslifeform 08.ogg}} '''Elemental Being: Floating Hydro Fungus:''' To the limitless depths east of Sumeru. A murky place that no one can return from.
:{{DIcon}} The Chasm.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 12 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, that must be [[The Chasm]], right? But what is it doing there...?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 12 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hmm... it's impossible to preserve forbidden knowledge. But...
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 12 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' What if it can be converted to a different form?
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 12 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I'm sorry if I'm suddenly not making any sense. However, I do think it's possible.
:{{A|vo nhdlq101 12 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Follow me. I'll explain it once we find that elemental life-form.
