|description = An agile, mischievous little prankster.<br>Its dark face gives the impression of a mask-wearing bandit, but in truth these creatures are a gentle and friendly sort, and will rarely steal from human dwellings. Even so, the good nature of Masked Weasels will sometimes be taken advantage of by people of less good intent, using these creatures to satisfy their selfish desires for ill-gotten gain.
