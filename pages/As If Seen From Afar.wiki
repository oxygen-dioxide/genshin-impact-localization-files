==Trivia==
*The achievement's Chinese title references the poem {{zh|遠遊|rm={{w|Yuan You}}|tl=Far-Off Journey}}, recorded in {{w|Chuci|the Songs of Chu}} anthology. The relevant lines read:
** {{zh|因氣變而遂曾舉兮，忽神奔而鬼怪。<br>'''時彷彿以遙見兮'''，精晈晈以往來。}}<br>In the ether's transformations they [the {{w|Zhenren|spiritual masters}}] rose upwards, with godlike swiftness miraculously moving.<br>'''Sometimes men see them, in remote, uncertain glimpses''', as their bright spirit forms dart across the sky.<ref>Hawkes, David. ''The Songs of the South : An Ancient Chinese Anthology of Poems by Qu Yuan and Other Poets. Penguin eBooks'', 2011, p.160.</ref>
