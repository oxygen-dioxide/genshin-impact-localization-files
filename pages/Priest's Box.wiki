"I thought that the young will grow strong and vital like cypresses."

"But these cypresses are about to wither. Their voices won't be carried by the wind anymore. My expectations towards them, as well as the faith they have in me, will all fall through."

"As long as the third one will be of thawing snow and ice, everything will be fine."
