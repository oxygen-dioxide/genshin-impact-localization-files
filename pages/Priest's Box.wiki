|description  = A treasure box with a decorative pattern at the bottom. The ornamentation seems to be a part of a three-piece motif. Once the pattern is completed, a certain door may open.
"I thought that the young will grow strong and vital like cypresses."

"But these cypresses are about to wither. Their voices won't be carried by the wind anymore. My expectations towards them, as well as the faith they have in me, will all fall through."

"Once again I'll climb this peak looking for guidance. By the time I back down, my daughter will have finished the second painting."

"As long as the third one will be of thawing snow and ice, everything will be fine."

The '''Priest's Box''' is used together with the [[Princess' Box]] and the [[Scribe's Box]] to unlock the [[Secret Room]] gate.

It is found in a [[Luxurious Chest]] on top of a tower, at the leftmost bend of the route above [[Entombed City - Ancient Palace]].
