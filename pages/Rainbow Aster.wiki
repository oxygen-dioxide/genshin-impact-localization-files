|desc_suspicious = A most unique drink. It certainly looks alright, and it would taste acceptable, if you ignore the astringency caused by improper handling of the Lavender Melons...
|desc_basic      = A unique drink. Having featured in the famous light novel "[[Pretty Please, Kitsune Guuji?]]", it has since been brought to life by [[Sailing Breeze]] in collaboration with [[Yae Publishing House]], along with its fascinating flavour. As this version does not contain any bean products, it is slightly different from the special limited edition that was available during the [[Irodori Festival]], but this also means that there is no risk of triggering any bean allergies.
|desc_delicious  = A unique drink. Calla Lilies from Mondstadt and Lavender Melons from Inazuma meet from across mountains and seas before having their flavors blended together to perfection using smooth milk.<br />Novel satisfaction guaranteed &mdash; indeed, it is utterly unsurprising that the ill Shogun in the tale was re-energized by the merits of this drink alone.
