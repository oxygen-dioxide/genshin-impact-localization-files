{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to [[Senga]], [[Takitoh]], or [[Wakana]] near the main stage)
:'''Senga:''' ...Do you think this could be some kind of [[youkai]] mischief?
:'''Wakana:''' What? No, come on. I was playing with the youkai I just met yesterday, and we were getting along great...
:'''Takitoh:''' And it’s not like humans are good or bad either... Maybe some youkai just don’t like the Mikawa Flower Festival much...
