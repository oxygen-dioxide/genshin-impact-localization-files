{{Description|A Fatui mage who can command Electro Cicins in battle. Their origins and what they look like under that mask are both mysteries.<br />Similarly to the way that Electro Cicins go crazy for Mist Grass, Cicin Mages take great pleasure in toying with their prey.|[[Archive]]}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
''Attack names are unofficial.''

*'''Summon Electro Cicin:''' Summons three [[Electro Cicin]]s. Summoned Cicins will despawn when the Electro Cicin Mage is defeated. The Mage will only use this ability when no summoned Cicins are present. While summoning Cicins, the mage's [[Interruption Resistance]] is greatly increased.
*'''Cicin Charge:''' Teleports summoned Cicins into a line in front of the Mage and commands them to charge consecutively at the target in balls of Electro, dealing '''100% Cicin's ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}. After charging, Cicins become immobilized briefly.
*'''Blink:''' Travels through the air to a nearby point as an electric current. The Mage can use this ability immediately after recovering poise, allowing her to blink out of a stagger or knockback animation.
*'''Blink (Approaching):''' Consecutively blinks up to 4 times towards the target. The Mage will only use this ability if far from the target. This is considered a different ability than the regular Blink, so the Mage can use them in succession.
*'''Thunderbolt:''' Summons a falling bolt of Electro energy to strike their foe, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|[[AoE]] Electro DMG}}; leaves behind a static charge that deals '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DoT}} to targets within.
** Certain enhanced Fatui Electro Cicin Mages, found in certain [[Domains]], [[Spiral Abyss]], overworld events and challenges, will consecutively summon '''2-6''' thunderbolts instead of 1. The number of thunderbolts is chosen randomly.
*'''Supercharged Shield:''' After ~40 seconds, absorbs all summoned Cicins, conjures an {{Color|Electro Shield}} and then begins flying towards the player, and continuously deals '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} to surrounding targets. While generating a shield, the mage's Interruption Resistance is greatly increased.
**The shield grants immunity to DMG and increased movement speed (faster than a player's base running speed, but slower than base sprinting speed) and prevents the Mage from being staggered or knocked down.
**The shield depletes gradually over ~12 seconds, but can be depleted faster with elemental reactions.
**The shield starts with 8 Electro gauge units, but will usually deplete after 5 to 6 units of reactions due to the decay over time.
**Afterwards, the ability needs to recharge over another 40 seconds. The charge rate of this ability is affected by energy charge rate modifiers such as the buff from Electro [[Elemental Nodes]].

===Ability Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if they meet all of the following conditions:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Certain abilities with extra trigger conditions may defy regular ability logic.

==Strategy==
*One can use [[Vacuum Field]]s to pull the mages or [[Frozen|Freeze]] them to prevent them from teleporting everywhere.
**Electro Cicin Mages can teleport to dodge player's attacks even while staggered.
*Use [[AoE]] attacks to deal with the cicins and mage simultaneously.
*Use {{Pyro}} and {{Cryo}} to destroy their Electro shield. See [[Shields/Shield Gauge Data]] for more info. Alternatively, one can wait for the shield to decay automatically.
*Like most human enemies, Electro Cicin Mages have a vulnerability to {{Color|Physical DMG}}, so dealing {{Color|Physical DMG}} will be especially effective.
**[[Superconduct]] can further lower Physical RES, but it may hit diminishing returns since mages have lower Physical RES to begin with.
*{{Electro}} is not recommended as the mages have increased Electro RES.
*Note that ranged autoattacks may lock on to cicins instead of the mage, so using AoE attacks or closing the distance with melee characters may make it easier to hit the mage.
*Use the environment to your advantage: Electro Cicin Mages that spawn near bodies of water will drown to death if they are knocked into deep water.

==Trivia==
*An old design for Electro Cicin Mages can be seen in the English version of [[:File:Character Demo - "Venti- A Bard's Business" (English Voice-Over) - Genshin Impact|enemy     Demo - "Venti: A Bard's Business"]]. At some point, the Chinese version of the demo was updated to use their current design.
