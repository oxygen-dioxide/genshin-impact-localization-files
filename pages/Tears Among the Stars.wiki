|description  = A drop of water obtained from within the [[All-Devouring Narwhal|colossal beast]] who coveted the [[primordial sea]] of life.<br><br>A philosopher in the faraway ancient world once posited that where there is life, there is death; naturally where there is death, there is life.<br>If not, then the fleeting light cannot resist the eternal darkness, and all withers into nothingness at the end of time.<br>The rules among the stars dictate that nature must be conserved, but the laws of the universe have never been conserved.<br>In a sealed box, destruction always overpowers new life. Millennia upon millennia of prosperity are but an instant in a span of billions of years. The greatest of achievements, the proudest accomplishments, in time all will tarnish, decay, dissipate, and ultimately fade into oblivion.<br>Thus there are things floating in among the stars, once adorned with countless prestigious titles from innumerable civilizations, shedding tears for their ordained demise.<br>Their tears stream down, out of desperation, out of hope, because all desperation and hope alike will be utterly extinguished along with the innumerable stars.<br>Their tears stream down out of sorrow, out of joy, because both will eventually scatter into the cold, dark endless void.<br>Every tiny yet beautiful silhouette and every moment worth remembering will fade with time, even stars.<br>And then there are these so-called "gods" that are determined to save everything worth saving, and devour everything that should be devoured.<br>Until the end of time, until the sea of stars recess into nothing but dying embers, until a newborn "world" moves for the first time in the stomach of the whale.<br>"There will be no more sins, no more sadness, and no more tears, because everything died with the ancient stars."
