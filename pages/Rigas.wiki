==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
Rigas is part of the Beret Society and is [[Dougier]]'s subordinate. Being one of the more "docile" and obedient members, Rigas along with [[Aucelet]] and [[Boulmier]] was sent to greet Wriothesley and the Traveler to put on a performance and make the Beret Society look good. Rigas is the one who talked to the Traveler about taking a deep breath to be happy. Later it is found out that Rigas was following a script. When the Traveler confronted Rigas later, Rigas was paralyzed, not knowing how to act.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Proud "Beret Society"}}</ref>
