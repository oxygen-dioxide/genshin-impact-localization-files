:'''Keita:''' Phlogiston Engraving is such a deep field of study. But... *sigh* kids these days...
:{{DIcon}} What's all this about?
::'''Keita:''' Greetings, outlander. This is the place where oblations are made to the [[Tablet of Tona]].
::'''Keita:''' As to what the Tablet of Tona is, it is a symbol of the uniting bond between our tribes and the Sacred Flame.
::'''Keita:''' Through the Flame, every native of Natlan can establish close connections with others in their tribe, [[Saurian]]s, and the [[Pyro Archon]].
::'''Keita:''' If the Flame's protection is your desire, then offer a prayer before the Tablet of Tona...
:{{DIcon}} What is a Phlogiston Engraving?
::'''Keita:''' Well, it's a pictogram created by the ancient people of Natlan by imitating a primeval language.
::'''Keita:''' They use these to communicate with phlogiston or interface with the Sacred Flame.
::'''Keita:''' Graffiti has become more popular as time has passed...
::'''Keita:''' But Phlogiston Engraving has some different connotations that few nowadays have the patience to study.
:{{DIcon}} Excuse me then.
::'''Keita:''' No worries. Safe travels, outlander.
