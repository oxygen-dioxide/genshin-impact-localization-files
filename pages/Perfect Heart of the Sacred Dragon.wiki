|description  = A flawless piece of jade. Before the fires of human civilization had ever been kindled, it was the heart of the Dragonlord [[Ixlel|Ix Uxul Tz'ib Bolon Ch'ule-L]], ruler of [[Chichen Uctokah]].<br>It once held the authority to command all devices within [[Ochkanatlan]], the ineffable city, yet can no longer be used due to its energy having been completely exhausted.<br>Just as with the half-humans who pursued it so relentlessly, the Dragonlord's quest for perfection was ultimately in vain, leading to naught but an end that was as cold and lifeless as jade.
