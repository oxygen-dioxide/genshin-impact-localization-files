{{Description|A feather-shaped token that was brought forth from a secluded hall. The compassion of [[Ei|its creator]] led to it being left within that mansion along with a certain slumbering form.}}
'''Plume of Luxury''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Husk of Opulent Dreams]].

==Description==
The long-wandering [[The Balladeer|eccentric]] no longer thinks about this,<br>But when he closes his eyes, he can still see the moonlit nights over [[Tatarasuna]] and the burning furnace flames.<br>The [[Katsuragi|kind young deputy]] said:<br>"This gold ornament is a proof of identity granted by the [[Ei|Almighty Shogun]],"<br>"But as you travel the world, please bear this in mind,"<br>"Never to reveal your identity to others."<br>The upright [[Mikoshi Nagamasa|Inspector]] said:<br>"This gold ornament may be a proof of identity granted by the Almighty Shogun,"<br>"But you are neither man nor mechanism,"<br>"And so I can only deal with you in this fashion. Do not hold this against me!"

The wanderer who has left yesterday in the dust no longer thinks about it,<br>But when he covers his ears, he can still hear the wild winds that roared that year.<br>[[Niwa Hisahide|A pair of expectant eyes]] said:<br>"This gold ornament is a proof of identity granted by the Almighty Shogun,"<br>"It must surely be able to save the people."

The [[Yae Miko|intelligent, lovely shrine maiden]] said:<br>"This gold ornament is a proof of identity granted by the Almighty Shogun,"<br>"And she will not abandon you."<br>"As for me, I shall do my best to send for help immediately..."

...But in the end, the golden arrow-feather were covered in dust,<br>And all tales were incinerated in karmic flames till nothing remained.
