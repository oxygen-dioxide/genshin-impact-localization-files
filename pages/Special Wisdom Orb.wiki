|description  = This Wisdom Orb looks quite familiar, though its back and base appear to have a few scratches and dings, almost as if it has been fought over at some point. If you look closely, you can even find the following words: "Backdoor command application sample" and "Confirmed to have no value, may be discarded," as well as some blood. It seems that not only did someone snatch this, but that they might have met with some misfortune afterward...
