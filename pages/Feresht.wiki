:'''Feresht:''' Some day, I'm going to inherit the family business and run it even better than [[Khalid|Father]]!
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Feresht/Al-Ahmar's Ruins|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Feresht:''' So, this looks like a game for the master of treasure appraisal. It's not so simple!
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Feresht:''' Aww, you won... But that's okay! Just wait until I come up with an even harder challenge!
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Feresht:''' You may call me "Master Treasure Appraiser, Prospective Antiques Collector, and Future Prominent Businessman Feresht."
::'''Feresht:''' When it comes to appraising treasure and collecting antiques, my sole objective is to surpass Father. Then there will be no one better than me.
::'''Feresht:''' As for the business side of things, I have two more formidable opponents to defeat...
::{{DIcon}} Who are these formidable opponents?
::'''Feresht:''' One is that sly [[Sulaykha]]. With that silver tongue of hers, she's able to sell something as cheap as a rug at a high price. I'm not gonna lose to her!
::'''Feresht:''' The other is that [[Dori|Lord Sangemah Bay]] often mentioned by Father.
::'''Feresht:''' I don't know who that is yet, but Father makes it sound like they're someone even more impressive!
::'''Feresht:''' It doesn't matter. A powerful adversary is all the more worth the challenge. Just wait and see!
:{{DIcon}} Good luck.
::'''Feresht:''' Thanks!

==Event Dialogue==
===A Parade of Providence===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Feresht:''' Greetings. You may call me "Master Treasure Appraiser, Prospective Antiques Collector, and Future Prominent Businessman Feresht."
:'''Feresht:''' Have you heard? The Akademiya is hosting some kind of celebration along with a competition. Supposedly, the champion's prize is an extremely rare treasure.
:'''Feresht:''' I think it was called... [[Diadem of Knowledge|the diadem of... something]]. Ah. It doesn't matter. The first trick to being an expert appraiser of treasures is to avoid getting intimidated by a treasure's name!
:'''Feresht:''' In terms of appraising antique collections, I'm only slightly less refined than my father. If you want to know how much a certain treasure is worth, just bring it to me and I'll let you know after a glance.
