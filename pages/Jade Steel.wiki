==History==
Historically, production of Jade Steel was concentrated in the [[Mikage Furnace]], until it was halted by the war between the [[Shogunate]] and the [[Watatsumi Army|resistance]]. It is said that Jade Steel is smelted using [[Crystal Marrow]], but its exact method is a trade secret.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Tatara Tales: Purification Device}}</ref> The [[Sangonomiya Clan]] resented the Shogunate's use of Crystal Marrow as the substance was produced from the corpse of their god [[Orobashi]],<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Kujou Masahito}}</ref> so after the ceasefire between the Shogunate and resistance was signed, the Shogunate temporarily halted all production of Jade Steel and related products.<ref>{{Ref/BB|Inazuma Commercial Street Bulletin Board|Shogunate Announcement - Jade Steel}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/BB|Hanamizaka Bulletin Board|Amenoma Smithy Notice II}}</ref>
