==Profile==
<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->
Yuehui is a miner in an independent crew. After [[The Chasm (Area)|The Chasm]] is reopened for surface mining, Yuehui's crew manages to secure a permit from [[Yujing Terrace]] allowing for limited ore mining in The Chasm. However, the miners have recently been seeing [[Hilichurls]] entering The Chasm's depths and not coming back out. This put the crew on edge, so Yuehui put in a commission at the [[Adventurers' Guild]] to put their fears to rest (and ensure their Mining Permit is not wasted). The [[Traveler]] ends up taking and resolving the commission, allowing his crew to get back to work.
