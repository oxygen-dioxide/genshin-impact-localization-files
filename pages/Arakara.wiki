==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Arakara:''' Little Nara in [[Vimara Village]] don't know how to farm... but other Nara cannot see Aranara...
:{{DIcon}} Is something worrying you?
::'''Arakara:''' Ah, it's Nara {{Traveler}}. Hello.
::'''Arakara:''' I am curious, about Nara's way of farming. They don't praise flowers, or sing to fruit trees.
::'''Arakara:''' But their way makes trees happy, too.
::'''Arakara:''' Do you know how they do that, Nara {{Traveler}}?
::{{DIcon}} Fertilizing and watering?
::'''Arakara:''' Watering, that I understand. Plants like water, like how I love farming.
::'''Arakara:''' "Fea-ther-lizing"... What is that?
::'''Arakara:''' Giving feathers to fruit trees to make them fly...?
:{{DIcon}} About [[Viparyas]]...
::'''Arakara:''' Viparyas are very happy. Happier than hearing any song by Arakara and [[Aranakula]].
::'''Arakara:''' Is it because of meeting the Golden Nara?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Arakara:''' Thank you for helping Arakara, Nara {{Traveler}}.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Arakara:''' Marana has been defeated, so Vana has more lands for farming now. But Valuka is still no good...
:{{DIcon}} About Marana...
::'''Arakara:''' Thanks to Nara {{Traveler}}, there are no more traces of Marana in Vana.
::'''Arakara:''' The land that was once polluted by Marana can now hear the laughter of Viparyas.
::'''Arakara:''' When Nara {{Traveler}} comes to Vana next time, you will definitely see greener green than now.
:{{DIcon}} About Valuka...
::'''Arakara:''' Valuka is different from Vana. All the earth has turned into golden remains.
::'''Arakara:''' No Aranara have been there, not even [[Aradasha]].
::'''Arakara:''' But I heard there are Nara farming in Valuka. I wonder how do the Nara there make the flowers happy.
::'''Arakara:''' If Nara {{Traveler}} goes to Valuka someday, can you ask the Nara there about this for me?
::{{DIcon}} Okay.
:::'''Arakara:''' Thank you, Nara {{Traveler}}. I hope that one day, Viparyas flowers can also bloom on Valuka land.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
* {{Furnishing Mentions}}
* Arakara says that no Aranara have been to the desert (Valuka), but after the events of ''[[Static Views, Part 2]]'', [[Aranimba]] is implied to have traveled there. Arakara's dialogue, however, does not change.
