{{Quest Description|You meet two strange oddballs in Sumeru City...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Interact with Przheva or Alexandra before start of quest)
:'''Przheva:''' ...Did you close that deal?
:'''Alexandra:''' The old cargo ship has just been unloaded. Don't worry.
:'''Przheva:''' The ship didn't leak, right? And about {{color|buzzword|the cargo...}} All hidden?
:'''Alexandra:''' Yes, all hidden somewhere safe and secret.
:'''Alexandra:''' But... what about the old stuff that have been replaced?
:'''Przheva:''' Just throw them away. With the new cargo in hand, the old stuff is of no use.
:'''Alexandra:''' I&mdash;Is that okay?
----
;(Open the chest without interacting with Przheva and Alexandra)
::'''Paimon:''' There're some... worn clothes and a stack of letters.
::{{DIcon}} What does the letter say?
::'''Paimon:''' Let Paimon see...
::'''Paimon:''' It says "To the south of Devantaka Mountain, the old ship leaves port."
::'''Paimon:''' What does that mean? How can there be a ship in the mountain?
::{{DIcon}} Maybe it's the clue to some treasures.
::{{DIcon}} Maybe it leads to a treasure trove.
::'''Paimon:''' And we don't know who left the box here.
::'''Paimon:''' Anyway, let's go take a look!

;(Open the chest after interacting with Przheva or Alexandra)
::'''Paimon:''' Ooh! The box is open! It's surprisingly easy.
::{{DIcon}} Let me see...
::{{DIcon}} The box could have something to do with those two Fatui...
::'''Paimon:''' Umm, anyway... Let's see what it has first.
::'''Paimon:''' Looks like... there're only some worn clothes and a stack of letters.
::'''Paimon:''' It says...
::'''Paimon:''' "To the south of [[Devantaka Mountain]], the old ship leaves port."
::'''Paimon:''' What does that mean? How can there be a ship in the mountain?
::{{DIcon}} Maybe it's some kind of code...
::{{DIcon}} The Fatui must be plotting something.
::'''Paimon:''' Well... we'll just have to figure it out.
----
;(Approach the marked location)
:'''Paimon:''' The south of Devantaka Mountain... That's a huge area.
:'''Paimon:''' The view is good here. Let's wait and see if there's anyone coming.

:'''You wait here with Paimon...'''

:'''Paimon:''' Look... Somebody's coming this way!
:'''Przheva:''' Why are you so late? Did you run into any trouble?
:'''Alexandra:''' ...Sorry, someone must have opened the box. I'm afraid our plan...
:'''Przheva:''' Tsk, did we get caught? But... it's not like the higher-ups have sent anyone here lately...
:'''Alexandra:''' Maybe... Maybe it was Nika? Those kids have been badgering me to take them out to play...
:'''Przheva:''' *sigh*... That's why I told you not to get too close to those folks, unless necessary.
:'''Alexandra:''' But their parents are always away from home, I just...
:'''Przheva:''' Forget it. Either way, we're leaving here today.
:'''Paimon:''' Leaving? Do they mean... leaving Sumeru?
:'''Alexandra:''' We don't have any helpers. Can the plan... work? I mean, what if the higher-ups found out about us...
:'''Przheva:''' Stop worrying... Haven't you had enough yet?
:'''Przheva:''' Living in fear, never to be trusted for a single second...
:'''Przheva:''' Today is our last chance to get away from the Fatui!
:'''Alexandra:''' I&mdash;I know, but...
:'''Paimon:''' These two... want to leave the Fatui?
:{{DIcon}} I'll go have a look.
:'''Paimon:''' Okay. But be careful. They are the Fatui after all!
----
;(Approach Przheva and Alexandra)
:'''Przheva:''' Hehe, someone has shown up after all.
:{{DIcon}} You found me?
:'''Przheva:''' You've been eavesdropping for a while without moving.
:'''Przheva:''' As the wind blew just now, the bush you were hiding in swayed differently from the one next to it.
:'''Paimon:''' Y&mdash;You Fatui really are something...
:'''Przheva:''' {{MC|m=Blond|f=Blonde}} hair... and a strange [[Seelie]]. You must be the "Traveler" mentioned in the report.
:{{DIcon}} That's right.
:{{DIcon}} Did you set this trap for me?
::'''Przheva:''' Relax. We wouldn't have had time for that.
:'''Przheva:''' Since you're here, I assume you have checked the stuff in the box.
:'''Przheva:''' I'm surprised that Alexandra's trick actually worked.
:{{DIcon}} What do you want?
:{{DIcon}} So you said all those things just for me to hear?
:'''Przheva:''' As you heard, Alexandra and I want to get away from the Fatui.
:'''Przheva:''' Stop looking at me like that. For your information, we're neither higher-ups in power nor front-line soldiers.
:'''Przheva:''' We are at best some pawns left in a random place waiting to be deployed.
:'''Przheva:''' There are plenty of people like us, but... most of them won't get any orders all their lives.
:'''Przheva:''' Being a Fatuus, one could only spend the rest of their life in the distrust from others.
:'''Przheva:''' We don't want to end up like that. Instead of wasting life here, we'd rather take the risk and free ourselves from the Fatui.
:'''Alexandra:''' But getting away is far from easy. If we get caught, there will be... serious consequences.
:'''Alexandra:''' So we thought up a plan to fake death in an attempt to escape.
:'''Alexandra:''' But our "death" must be proved by someone who is convincing.
:'''Przheva:''' Traveler, you are such a notorious figure for the Fatui, and... Hehe, you've always been at odds with the Fatui.
:'''Przheva:''' You are the ideal witness to the death of two Fatui.
:{{DIcon}} What made you so sure that I would come here?
::'''Przheva:''' I wasn't sure whether you would come, but I would wait until you come.
::'''Przheva:''' Patience is one of the few strengths I have.
:{{DIcon}} What if I hadn't come here today...
::'''Przheva:''' Then we would go back and suspend the plan until you come.
::'''Przheva:''' We've been planning this for so long. It wouldn't hurt to wait a bit longer.
:'''Przheva:''' Traveler, now that we've told you the whole story, it's your choice if you want to help.
:'''Przheva:''' If your answer is yes, we'll give you a handsome amount of rewards in return.
:'''Alexandra:''' And don't worry, the money is earned by doing serious work. I can assure you!
:'''Alexandra:''' I... I cooked dinner for those kids, sewed clothes, told stories, and took them out...
:'''Alexandra:''' And Przheva helped others with hunting and handling prey...
:'''Alexandra:''' If we manage to leave the Fatui, we will make a living out of these skills! And...
:'''Przheva:''' Enough, Alexandra! That's too much information!
:'''Alexandra:''' Oh... right! Okay...
:'''Przheva:''' Anyway, it's all up to you, Traveler.
:{{DIcon}} I'll help.
::'''Przheva:''' Thank you, Traveler. You will get rich rewards.
:{{DIcon}} Aren't you afraid I'd back out?
::'''Przheva:''' Then we'll fight as hard as we can, and in the end... die at your hands.
::'''Przheva:''' It sounds much like our original plan, right?
::{{DIcon}} You'd better have enough money.
::'''Przheva:''' Of course, it'll be a very generous amount.
:'''Przheva:''' Then it's a deal. Now let's go separate ways and get ready.
:'''Przheva:''' Alexandra, you go take care of that.
:'''Przheva:''' And Traveler, please follow me.
----
;(Approach the marked location)
:'''Przheva:''' This is the place, Traveler. Listen, it's a simple plan.
:'''Przheva:''' We are two... ahem, evil Fatui coming over to this forest for some evildoing.
:'''Przheva:''' And you, out of indignation or righteousness, try to stop us.
:'''Przheva:''' Just as Alexandra and I are about to run, a group of monsters appears and strikes us down.
:'''Przheva:''' Being outnumbered by the monsters, you have no choice but to pull back. When you are back with helpers, Alexandra and I are already gone.
:'''Przheva:''' That's the plan. What do you think?
:{{DIcon}} Well crafted, I have to say.
::'''Przheva:''' For the story to make sense and our failure to seem more natural, I've put a lot of thought into it.
:{{DIcon}} Just sounds like how the Fatui would end up.
::'''Przheva:''' Right. The pawns in the Fatui out there collecting intel normally end up like this.
::'''Przheva:''' We made this plan just because we don't want to be one of them.
:'''Przheva:''' But why hasn't Alexandra returned by now? Just setting up some lures for monsters doesn't take that long.
:'''???:''' Alexandra! Alexandra! *sob*...
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, Paimon heard someone over there!
:'''Przheva:''' Shoot! Alexandra must be in trouble!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Wait! Where are you going!?
:{{DIcon}} Let's follow!
:'''Paimon:''' What happened...
----
;(Approach Alexandra)
:'''Paimon:''' S&mdash;So many monsters! Ugh, why are these monsters showing up at this time!?
:'''Przheva:''' Tsk. Why is Nika here...
:'''Przheva:''' Traveler, join me and defeat the monsters first!
----
;(Talk to Alexandra)
:'''Alexandra:''' Sorry... ahem... [[Przheva]]...
:'''Przheva:''' Don't talk. I'll patch you up.
:'''Nika:''' *sobbing*... I'm sorry...
:{{DIcon}} Why are you here?
:'''Nika:''' I'm... I'm here to pick mushrooms... *sob*...
:'''Nika:''' Alexandra... looks so sad these days...
:'''Nika:''' So we talked about cooking something great to surprise her.
:'''Nika:''' Alexandra once took us here and picked all those delicious mushrooms, and I thought I'd pick some myself.
:'''Nika:''' B&mdash;But I got lost in the woods, and before I knew it, I was surrounded by so many mushrooms.
:'''Nika:''' To save me, Alexandra... Alexandra... *sob*
:'''Alexandra:''' *cough*... It's... It's okay, Nika... I'm fine...
:'''Przheva:''' ...Looks like there's a change of the plan.
:'''Przheva:''' Alexandra sustained serious injuries, and other Fatui must have noticed that we left the town without permission. If I take her back now, we will only get arrested for inspection.
:{{DIcon}} Then what about your plan...
:{{DIcon}} Then what do you do now?
:'''Przheva:''' Hehe... Just go along with it and see what will happen.
:'''Przheva:''' I happened to see a group of the Eremites heading this way on my way here.
:'''Przheva:''' Traveler, you send the kid off the forest to the Eremites. I will take Alexandra and leave.
:'''Przheva:''' ...
:'''Przheva:''' Remember our plan? Looks like now we have to do it for real.
:'''Przheva:''' The Eremites must think that two evil Fatui are doing something evil here, and that saving Nika is just a cover-up.
:'''Przheva:''' If we come under attack by the monsters... well, it serves us right.
:'''Nika:''' *sob*... Alexandra... I will never make any trouble again...
:'''Przheva:''' ...Good thing this kid didn't have the mood to listen to what we just said. No need to worry about him.
:{{DIcon}} But what you did was for saving the kid...
:{{DIcon}} But you are not evil...
:'''Przheva:''' Trust me, few would believe in "the Fatui's heroic sacrifice."
:'''Przheva:''' "The evil Fatui eating their own bitter fruit" is much more acceptable.
:'''Przheva:''' Remember the place where you eavesdropped on Alexandra and me for the first time? If... we manage to get away, I will leave a letter there.
:{{DIcon}} So you knew from the beginning...
:'''Przheva:''' With only one chance, we have to be careful.
:{{DIcon}} We should save Alexandra first!
:'''Alexandra:''' I'm fine, Traveler... Ahem... I can take it...
:'''Alexandra:''' ...But if we miss this chance to get out of the Fatui, I'd rather... ahem, *coughing*!!
:'''Nika:''' Alexandra, where are you going? Please come back with us! Everyone is looking for you!
:'''Alexandra:''' Listen, Nika... The Traveler will take you back... ahem...
:'''Alexandra:''' I'm... gonna take a rest here. I will be back if I'm feeling any better...
:'''Nika:''' B&mdash;But...
:'''Alexandra:''' When did I ever lie to you? Ahem... Just be a good boy, will you?
:'''Nika:''' *whimper*... Okay...
:'''Alexandra:''' Traveler, please take good care of him...
:{{DIcon}} I'll be right back.
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
:'''Przheva:''' Thank you, Traveler.

;(Talk to Alexandra and Przheva again)
:'''Alexandra:''' Ahem... Sorry, Przheva, I'm not cut out for this job...
:'''Przheva:''' Don't say that.
----
;(Talk to Berat)
:'''Berat:''' I didn't know this errand could take that long... How exhausting...
:'''Berat:''' Wait! Who's there!
:'''Berat:''' Nika... and Traveler, what are you doing here?
:{{DIcon}} Please take care of Nika!
:{{DIcon}} Someone's under attack over there!
:'''Paimon''' W&mdash;We are running out of time! Please watch Nika for a while!
:'''Berat:''' What? What did you mean? Wait a moment!

;(Talk to Berat and Nika again)
:'''Berat:''' Stop crying, Nika. What happened?
:'''Nika:''' *sob*... Alexandra...
:'''Berat:''' Alexandra? What's she doing here?
:'''Berat:''' Nika, tell me what happened in detail...
----
;(Approach the location where Alexandra and Przheva were)
:'''Paimon:''' Alexandra should be around here. Where... Where are they?
:{{DIcon}} Alexandra!
:{{DIcon}} Przheva!
:'''Paimon:''' Where are you!
:'''Berat:''' Stop shouting! You will only attract the monsters!
:'''Berat:''' Nika told me the whole story. I'm so surprised that Alexandra and Przheva are Fatui members.
:'''Berat:''' I thought they were good folks when dealing with them...
:'''Nika:''' Alexandra is a good person! Przheva is tough... but also a good person!
:'''Berat:''' Umm, but they are Fatui! Who knows if they are just acting nice but actually with ulterior motives?
:'''Berat:''' I mean, I've heard plenty of shady deals of the Fatui.
:'''Berat:''' Maybe they were just scheming something and using saving Nika as a cover-up?
:{{DIcon}} They...
:{{DIcon}} They... are not bad...
:'''Berat:''' You don't know about that. And it's not like we can find them...
:'''Berat:''' One of them is wounded... so according to my experience, the monsters must have... well...
:'''Nika:''' Berat! Could you keep looking? Please!!
:'''Berat:''' Nika, if I wasn't here alone, I promise I would search the whole forest out.
:'''Berat:''' But there's only me here. The monsters are one thing, and what if there're other Fatui here...
:'''Berat:''' Ahem, anyway... Traveler, I say we go back to the city first. I'll report this to my superior and follow his order.

:'''Berat takes Nika and leaves...'''

:'''Paimon:''' His response is just as Przheva expected...
:'''Paimon:''' But did they... manage to get away?
:'''Paimon:''' There's not much we can do now. Let's head back.
:'''Paimon:''' Przheva said if they managed to leave, they would leave a letter at the place where they were.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go take a look if we have time.
:;(Quest ends)
----
;(Interact with the letter where Alexandra and Przheva were in Port Ormos)
:;(Obtain [[Unsigned Note]])
:'''Paimon''' Look! There really is a letter here! Open it up!
:'''Paimon''' "...The old ship left with a half-load of cargo..."
:'''Paimon''' "...My sincere gratitude, Traveler."
:'''Paimon''' That's all there is to the letter. They must've already left.
:'''Paimon''' But where could they go in that old rustbucket?
