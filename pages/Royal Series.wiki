==Lore==
Weapons from the Aristocratic Period, typically owned by nobles that ruled over Mondstadt, aside from the Royal Grimoire, which was owned by a royal mage.

The Anemo Archon [[Barbatos]] reformed the world and founded Mondstadt around 2600 years ago.<br />
During that time [[Venerare]] was the leader of the [[Lawrence Clan]], and she guided the ancient people of Mondstadt to build a statue to commemorate the Anemo Archon's descent.<br />
The leader of all the clans put an inscription on the bottom of the statue.<ref name="Royal Grimoire">{{Ref/Weapon|Royal Grimoire}}</ref> The inscription was an oath of protection to Mondstadt that all of the inhabitants took:

"For Mondstadt, as always. For the verdant plains, for the hills, and for the forests of Mondstadt. May they continue to flourish, as always."<br />
"For Mondstadt, as always. For the everlasting freedom of Mondstadt from the blizzard and the tyrant, whose coldness and oppression are one and the same."<ref name="Royal Longsword">{{Ref/Weapon|Royal Longsword}}</ref>

The nobles used to hunt as a pastime to show their strength in the natural world, and they shared what they caught with the people out of benevolence.<ref name="Royal Bow">{{Ref/Weapon|Royal Bow}}</ref> Swordsmanship was mandatory for nobles for refining wisdom and elegance rather than for combat.<ref name="Royal Longsword"/> The nobles also had a responsibility to fight to protect their people from monsters.<ref name="Royal Greatsword">{{Ref/Weapon|Royal Greatsword}}</ref><br />
The royal mages' duties were to nourish the soil and water, fight off monsters, and tutor the nobles.<ref name="Royal Grimoire"/><br />
Gladiatorial combat originated as a sacrificial ceremony alongside prayers to the gods.<ref name="Royal Greatsword"/>

Eventually the Lawrence Clan gave up the noble aspirations of their ancestors and took down the statue commemorating the Anemo Archon's descent, after which the royal mages stopped talking about history and the oath.<ref name="Royal Grimoire"/> The nobles forgot their responsibilities to protect their people and lost their benevolence. Swordsmanship became a mere formality<ref name="Royal Longsword"/> and the only acceptable fighting style for nobles, as bows and spears were the weapons of commoners and gladiators.<ref name="Royal Spear">{{Ref/Weapon|Royal Spear}}</ref> Gladiatorial combat became a mere bloodsport for the enjoyment of the Lawrence Clan.<ref name="Royal Greatsword"/>

However, one youth among the nobles found a smith to make a spear and put his house's crest on it. This youth couldn't find favor with his family without the spilling of blood, so he practiced with this ignoble weapon in the night where nobody would see him to gain the power he needed to impose change.<ref name="Royal Spear"/>

The commoners also realized that with sharpened poles and pitchforks they could be a match for the sword-wielding nobles in combat,<ref name="Royal Spear"/> and with Vennessa's final push the Lawrence Clan was overthrown.<br />
The newly formed [[Knights of Favonius]] conducted investigations, outlawing gladiatorial combat<ref name="Royal Greatsword"/> and exiling the Lawrence Clan.<ref name="Royal Bow"/><br />
The royal mages were exiled along with them since they had forsaken their responsibility to instill goodness and virtue in the nobles, instead becoming like them.<ref name="Royal Grimoire"/><br />
The Lawrence Clan originally thought they were betrayed by their people, but eventually some of them realized that they were the ones that had betrayed the people.<ref name="Royal Bow"/><br />
The Knights of Favonius also rebuilt the statue that commemorated the Anemo Archon's descent, but the wording of the oath was unfortunately lost.<ref name="Royal Grimoire"/> However, the oath was preserved by the winds that watch over Mondstadt.<ref name="Royal Longsword"/>

==Trivia==
*It's likely that the leader of all the clans was a member of the [[Gunnhildr Clan]], perhaps even Gunnhildr herself, since the oath incorporates the Gunnhildr Clan motto: 'For Mondstadt, as always.'
*It's likely that gladiatorial combat began under the influence of the Imunlaukr Clan since it originated as a form of worship to the gods, much like how the Imunlaukr Clan's view of fighting was before joining Mondstadt.
*While it's hard to put a date to the weapons, it seems the Royal Spear was made much more recently than the others since the lore only mentions events and details from the time the Lawrence clan became corrupted, whereas the others mention events and details dating back to the beginning of Mondstadt.
