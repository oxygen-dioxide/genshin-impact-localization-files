:{{DIcon}} Um, hello?
::'''Affan:''' ...Another merchant here to sell their wares, are you? Ugh, how many does this make...
::'''Affan:''' Not that it matters. I do not lack for food or clothing, nor do I have any savings. Whatever you're selling, go sell it to someone else.
::'''Affan:''' I've got flowers to plant, as you can see. If you're not here about that, don't disturb me.

:{{DIcon}} So, about the folk song...
::'''Affan:''' Ah, so you've remembered it, eh? Well, that makes one more young person who knows it. Good, good.
::'''Affan:''' "Rose, oh roses, grant me my wish. Blooming from the stone, the Golden Rose sang to me."
::'''Affan:''' "No land but folk songs bore my spirit. Songs shall defy my fate, and overcome my destiny."
::'''Affan:''' "They will surpass me, surpass time. They will surpass the ever-lasting withering of life..."
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Affan:''' You have a good heart, child. May the gods watch over you and that heart of yours. See you.
