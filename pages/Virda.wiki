==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Virda:''' I've got to do my best in training... Huh? I don't think I've seen you before. Who are you? Ah, wait, no, let me guess.
:'''Virda:''' You're tall, and you look completely different from us [[Melusine]]s... I know. You must be from outside the village!
:{{DIcon}} A deduction most brilliant...
::'''Virda:''' I&mdash;I mean, I'm just a trainee... That's why my skills are still lacking.
::'''Virda:''' But I've been training diligently every day. One day soon, I'll be able to officially join the [[Marechaussee Phantom]]!
::{{DIcon}} Why do you need to do special training?
:::'''Virda:''' Well, to join the Marechaussee Phantom, of course. Monsieur [[Neuvillette]] says that we all have the potential to become Marechaussee agents...
:::'''Virda:''' But you have to undergo strict assessments to become a member for real, so I have to work hard!
::{{DIcon}} Why do you want to join the Marechaussee Phantom?
:::'''Virda:''' Because I want to defend justice as one of their members &mdash; and also, their official uniform is super cool.
:::'''Virda:''' Oh yes &mdash; my favorite character in "Great Detective Hurlock" is Agent Gina of the Marechaussee Phantom.
:::'''Virda:''' Although her deductions are often full of holes, the effort she puts in to catch criminals for the sake of her future is very inspiring indeed!
:::'''Virda:''' So yes, I dream of becoming a member of the Marechaussee Phantom!
::{{DIcon}} You can do it!
:::'''Virda:''' Yup, I'll do my best!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''Ancient Colors''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Virda:''' It seems I'll need to try harder... Ah yes, thanks for your help previously!
:'''Virda:''' Hehehe, I was able to help everyone out, and [[Sedile]] even praised me &mdash; is this my special training paying off?
:{{DIcon}} Why do you need to do special training?
:;(Same as before)
:{{DIcon}} Could you tell me what happened to the [[Eremites]] from earlier?
::'''Virda:''' Oh, sure. Sedile contacted the [[Gardes]]. They should be in the [[Maison Gardiennage]]'s custody by now.
::'''Virda:''' Sedile said that the Marechaussee Phantom is in charge of finding the bad guys &mdash; and in the cases that they've been found, we can just directly hand them over to the Maison!
:{{DIcon}} Why do you want to join the Marechaussee Phantom?
:;(Same as before)
:{{DIcon}} Keep up the good work.
::'''Virda:''' Yup, I'll do my best!
