{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Talochard and [["Curve"]])
:'''Talochard:''' Morning! Morning!
:{{DIcon}} Good morning.
:'''Paimon:''' Morning! Hey, Talochard, how come there's no desk in here?
:'''Talochard:''' There just isn't. We don't need desks for our work, anyway. And this bench is awesome. Look! It has comfy cushions.
:'''Talochard:''' Sit down, quick. Come try the delicious breakfast I made for you!
:'''Paimon:''' Woah! Thanks, Talochard. But what is this? It smells a little... odd?
:'''Talochard:''' That's my special [[Poissonchant Pie]]. It's even tastier than the usual recipe.
:'''Talochard:''' It does smell odd, but that's why it's special.
:'''Paimon:''' You've piqued Paimon's interest... What about you, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} Curve, what do you think?
:'''"Curve":''' An analysis of the composition indicates eating this could be a difficult trial.
:{{DIcon}} Forget it. I'll let you try it, Paimon. You're tougher than me.
::'''Paimon:''' Not eating? Then Paimon will finish your portion too. Waste not, want not! Hehe.
::{{Black Screen|Paimon starts to chow down, and scarfs down a full portion-and-a-half of the odd-smelling pie in the blink of an eye.<br>Half an hour later... she comes back from outside, clutching her belly.}}
:;(Paimon shakes her head and raises a hand to her head)
:{{DIcon}} Awesome. We're real tough cookies.
::'''Paimon:''' Then let's dig in!
::{{Black Screen|You and Paimon wolf down a half-portion of the odd-smelling pie.<br>Half an hour later... you both come back from outside, clutching your bellies.}}
:'''Talochard:''' Just where did you disappear to? If you're still hungry, there's more. I made lots.
:'''Paimon:''' Th&mdash;Thanks, Talochard. No need though, Paimon just went for a quick rest. And there's still some pie left... Uh, {{Traveler}}, why don't we box it up for... later?
:'''Talochard:''' Uhm, your expressions... Wasn't it tasty? I thought I did a good job...
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps you're tough enough.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon knows why they call it Poissonchant Pie now. The "poisson" are in Paimon's guts, chanting: "We wanna swim back out!"
:'''Talochard:''' Huh? Oh, that sounds absolutely awful... I'm so sorry!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, don't worry about it. Paimon's better already. Anyway, the problem is Paimon's preferences, not your cooking!
:{{DIcon}} Back to business. Did you get any info about the knife?
:'''Paimon:''' Oh right! Paimon forgot we're supposed to be working now.
:'''Talochard:''' Okay. So, about that. We did find something that might be useful. This is a knife from the "Elegant Tableware Confrerie."
:'''Paimon:''' The people who said Rocher owes them money?
:'''Talochard:''' Yeah. They masquerade as a legitimate business, claiming their tableware is favored by Fontaine's upper classes and can be sold for hefty sums.
:'''Talochard:''' People like Rocher often fall for it. They pay a fee to join and get a pile of lousy tableware in return. Then they try to sell it for enough to make back their initial "investment" and then some.
:'''Talochard:''' But the tableware itself is unsellable junk. So the victims have no choice but to find other fools to pass the baton to. I hear they call it expanding their downline network.
:{{DIcon}} Sounds pretty familiar...
:'''Talochard:''' See? Humans are creatures full of lies.
:'''Paimon:''' But it seems like Rocher didn't expand his downline network...
:'''"Curve":''' In terms of ethical human relations, Mr. Rocher's morals exceed the level of the average person. He didn't continue to bring in more victims.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh... So maybe his wife isn't the worst judge of character...
:'''Talochard:''' But his financial acumen is way, way below the average! In the end, his poor wife had to deal with the fallout and took the losses.
:'''Paimon:''' Ah... That's true... But weren't they exposed by the paper? Can't you guys track down the money and help them recover their losses?
:'''Talochard:''' Our colleagues got involved some time ago and made multiple arrests. But the ringleader is a crafty one, and immediately claimed that the perpetrators of the scam were temporary employees.
:'''Talochard:''' Most importantly, he kept all their accounts completely separate. As a result, recovering the losses has proven extremely difficult.
:{{DIcon}} Is there nothing you can do about it?
:'''Talochard:''' Hehe, we can push things forward today. I got the location of their possible hideout, and I'll be investigating it later.
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! You found their lair!
:'''Talochard:''' Hmph! The [[Marechaussee Phantom]] is more capable than you think! Considering the facts of this case, I now have reasons to believe that [[Sir Arthur]] was stolen by the Elegant Tableware Confrerie!
:'''Paimon:''' Although it does sound very likely, it's best if you don't act so certain of it...
:'''Talochard:''' Hmph! We'll know once we get there! Let's go.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Leftover Poissonchant Pie}})
:;("Waterstained Dinner Knife" clue is updated)
::'''Waterstained Dinner Knife'''
::Based on Agent Talochard's analysis, this item belongs to the "Elegant Tableware Confrerie," an association that was once exposed by The Steambird as a gang of swindlers.
----
;(Enter [[Elton Trench]])
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, so their base is underwater?
:'''Talochard:''' Yes. It seems we must go down... How troublesome.
:'''Talochard:''' Given Curve's condition, it would be best if he didn't get wet, but it seems we have no choice this time...
:'''Paimon:''' You said so last time, too. How's Curve?
:'''Talochard:''' He's already thirty, his core and other components are all starting to get old, so he's got to maintain them &mdash; or else!
:'''Paimon:''' Thirty's still kinda young, isn't it?
:'''Talochard:''' Thirty's not young!
:'''Paimon:''' Yes it is!

;(Enter Elegant Tableware Confrerie's hideout)
:'''Talochard:''' We're here.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's see... Sure are a lot of them in there... What should we do? Charge in, beat them up, and make them confess?
:'''Talochard:''' Don't be so violent, Paimon. They're already frightened and on edge. They might destroy the evidence if we give them another scare!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... That's true. Then let's sneak in, find the evidence, and then beat them up?
:{{DIcon}} Do we have to beat them up?
::'''Paimon:''' Well... It's such a small place, so a fight is inevitable anyway... Fine, then is it possible to distract them?
:{{DIcon}} I don't like sneaking around.
::'''Paimon:''' Neither does Paimon. So, is it possible to distract them?
:'''Talochard:''' There must be something here that we can use...
:'''Talochard:''' Curve, hide and wait here for us. You're too big not to get spotted. Just come over once we're done.
:'''"Curve":''' As you wish.
:'''Paimon:''' Then let's hurry up and figure out how to lure them away.

;(Talk to "Curve," optional)
:'''"Curve":''' Self-diagnostic in progress...
:'''"Curve":''' Moisture has seeped into the motherboard. Motherboard temperature: Below warning line. Core functionality: 19%.
----
;(Interact with "Blow up the [[Exploding Barrel|Explosive Barrel(s)]]")
:'''Paimon:''' This explosive barrel... Could we make use of it by blowing it up from a safe distance?
:;(If the player detonates the Explosive Barrels)
::'''Guard:''' Warning! Explosive trap triggered! Intruder alert!
::'''Talochard:''' Uh oh, that was a trap...
:;(Returns to the start of Step 6)

;(Investigate the crate past the Explosive Barrels)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, this chest... What if Paimon hides inside and makes some noise? Then you guys can go look for clues while they come over to investigate. Think that'll work?
:{{DIcon}} Sure, give it a try.
::{{Black Screen|Paimon squeezes in, and once the rest of you are well-hidden, she starts shaking the chest.}}
::'''Guard:''' Someone's over there! By that chest! Intruder alert!
::'''Talochard:''' This plan's way too dumb!
:;(Returns to the start of Step 6)
:{{DIcon}} Doesn't sound like it'll work.
::'''Talochard:''' Let's come up with a plan B.

;(Investigate the [[Bulle Fruit]])
:'''Paimon:''' All this Bulle Fruit... Maybe they really like them? Could we try chucking some way far away to distract them?
:{{DIcon}} Sure, give it a try.
::{{Black Screen|All of you hide and start chucking Bulle Fruit really far away.}}
::'''Guard:''' Wow! Sweet! Bulle Fruit! Wait... Who's throwing them?
::'''Guard:''' Alert! Alert! Intruder alert!
::'''Talochard:''' This plan's way too dumb!
:;(Returns to the start of Step 6)
:{{DIcon}} Doesn't sound like it'll work.
::'''Talochard:''' Let's come up with a plan B.

;(If the player is spotted by enemies)
:'''Talochard:''' Oh no, we've been spotted!
:;(Returns to the start of Step 6)

;(Investigate the cooking pot)
:'''Paimon:''' (This pot... has chicken legs in it. Is someone cooking?)
:'''Talochard:''' (How about adding in some "seasoning" to put them to sleep after their meal? Or we can do something else to drive them away...)
:'''Paimon:''' (N&mdash;Nice idea! Check your bag for any useful "seasoning," {{Traveler}}!)
:;(Opens the submission menu)

;(After submitting Leftover Poissonchant Pie)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Paimon has a feeling it'll be super effective!
:'''Talochard:''' Hey! How could you put that in there!? It's an insult to my culinary talents!
:'''Paimon:''' Don't be mad, Talochard. Your cooking might end up making a very significant contribution here. Paimon's certain they won't be able to overcome the trial of toughness it poses.
:'''Talochard:''' Really? Then... Fine. Let's hide and watch what happens.
:{{Black Screen|Once "Chowtime!" is shouted, the entire Elegant Tableware Confrerie starts gulping down the food with the extra "seasoning."<br>It doesn't take long before, one by one, subtle changes begin to appear on their faces, and then they start running toward the exit with their hands clutching their stomachs.}}
:'''Paimon:''' See, Talochard? They're experiencing the power of Poissonchant Pie, just like I said!
:'''Talochard:''' Hehe... I'm incredible! I'll go get Curve. Now we can search for evidence to our heart's content!
----
;(Invesetigate the Old Clockwork Locket)
:'''Old Clockwork Locket:''' (An archaic clockwork locket. It looks quite old.)
:'''Paimon:''' What's this? Looks like it opens.
:'''Yellowed Portrait of a Girl'''<br>[[File:Yellowed Portrait of a Girl.png|100px]]
:'''Talochard:''' There's a photo in there. Who is she?
:'''"Curve":''' Database responding... Database responding... Database responding...
:'''"Curve":''' Failed to retrieve information.
:'''Talochard:''' Retrieval failed? Curve, your database wouldn't respond without having relevant information, right? Did water get inside you?
:'''Talochard:''' Hmm... Let's put this away for now. I'll let Curve take a look later...
:;(Adds "Old Clockwork Locket" to the Case Record)
::'''Old Clockwork Locket'''
::An archaic clockwork locket. It looks quite old.

;(Investigate the Dining Table With Tableware)
:'''Dining Table With Tableware:''' (An overwhelming amount of tableware is scattered all over the table in a messy yet charming pile that's ripe for the taking.)
:'''Paimon:''' A table knife! A table knife just like the one left outside The Steambird!
:'''Talochard:''' It must be them...

;(Investigate the Diary of a Valiant Struggle)
:'''Page 1/5'''
:After getting the boot from the [[Fruity Order|Order of the Fruit]], I was really down in the dumps. Luckily, I've joined a new group, so I'm feeling a little better.
:This new group's operations are a little different from the last one's. Anyway, let's go, Intrepid Valberry!
:
:'''Page 2/5'''
:[["Tricky Bulle Fruit"|Crafty Bulle Fruit]], my brother, you're always in my thoughts.
:I can't believe the higher-ups sent [["Ruthless Calla Lily"|Calla Lily]] to hunt you down just for the formula to that stupid potion. I guess you're Plum out of luck now, huh?
:But don't worry, I made a big ruckus in the Order of the Fruit in your defense. They may have kicked me out over it, but I've got no regrets. I only hope your soul can rest in peace.
:No one else knows this, but I've also put lots of Bulle Fruits in my new home to remember you by.
:Looks like only four of the Five Great Operatives of the Order of the Fruit now remain.
:
:'''Page 3/5'''
:I finally received my first mission: to get money off some guy named Rocher.
:That old dog's got no shame, refusing to repay his debts like that. I went out there and socked him twice before he coughed up a pile of junk.
:The only thing in there that looked like it could be worth anything was this locket. It looked like a woman's... Surely not his wife's, right? Unbelievable.
:Who in their right mind would marry a guy like that?
:
:'''Page 4/5'''
:Seems like something happened today. Directors 2 through 41 were all taken away. Supposedly, The Steambird blew the lid off our business and got the Marechaussee Phantom involved.
:Luckily, I'm new, so I'm safe for now. But I don't get it &mdash; aren't we just in the regular old cutlery business?
:Whatever, it doesn't matter. To repay the boss's kindness, my first order of business is to pay that paper a little visit.
:
:'''Page 5/5'''
:I'd originally planned to tear them a new one, but the boss says that we should keep a low profile for now. I guess I'll start with that dumb bird at the door then.
:A knife through that bird's head should send them the message loud and clear, right?
:Since the other directors were taken away, I'll go to the boss after the job's done to tell him what I've done. He'll be so happy, he might even give me a promotion.
:Let's go! Intrepid Valberry, away!
:;(Adds "Diary of a Valiant Struggle" to the Case Record)
::'''Diary of a Valiant Struggle'''
::A record of the life experiences of a striver.<br>"Knife those stupid birds straight through! This should be a good enough warning for them?"
----
;(After investigating all points)
:'''[[Boss (The Red and the Black)|Boss]]:''' Who cooked this gar&mdash; *blaaargh*... Who cooked today!? Kill&mdash; *blech*... Find him and kill him!
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Boss! Boss&mdash; *urrrrrk*... Boss I'll immediately&mdash; *blaaaargh*... I'll go find the cook!
:'''Talochard:''' Hmph! This Agent right here is today's chef! So who's going to kill me?
:'''Boss:''' M&mdash;Marechaussee Phantom? Agents... How did&mdash; *huuuuurk*... How did you get in here?
:'''Talochard:''' I don't think you've got time to worry about that right now! We've obtained evidence of your crimes!
:'''Boss:''' Evidence? But Officer, all of them were temporary workers, and didn't you arrest them already?
:'''Talochard:''' We're working on another case right now! All of you are suspects in a plot to get revenge against The Steambird by stealing Sir Arthur!
:'''Boss:''' The paper? I&mdash;Impossible. I've never held any grudges toward them... in fact, I even want to thank them for pointing out the flaws in our business model...
:'''Talochard:''' You're good with words, but what will you do once we show you... THIS?
:;(Opens [[Talochard's Investigation Notes]])
:'''Produce the evidence and pierce through the web of lies.'''

;(Submit incorrect evidence)
:'''Talochard:''' Oh, dangit! That's not it!
:'''Boss:''' What are you going to show? Do you have any evidence?
:;(Reopens the submission screen)

;(Submit "Diary of a Valiant Struggle")
:'''Talochard:''' See? Director 42 admitted it in their diary! Busted!
:'''Boss:''' Y&mdash;You fool! Didn't I tell you to keep a low profile for now!?
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' But... Boss! Are we supposed to just lie down and take it when they're bullying us like this!?
:'''Boss:''' Th&mdash;The Marechaussee Phantom! Officer, with all due respect, t&mdash;this fool is just a temporary employee! He hasn't even passed his probation period! Since he's suspected of breaking the law and committing a crime, I have no choice but to fire him in the spirit of justice!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! How much longer are you planning on using that same old trick!?
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' F&mdash;Fire me!? Why!? Boss... D&mdash;Didn't you just say earlier that I'm the only one here who has always been loyal to you!?
:'''Boss:''' Who are you? What are you talking about? You're fired! We have nothing to do with each other from now on!
:'''Boss:''' Take him away, honored Agents. He's all yours.
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Boss! You... you betrayed me...
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Argh! You dirty double-timing dog! I'll take you down with me!

;(After defeating the Treasure Hoarders)
:'''Boss:''' Ouch... You blithering idiot! How dare you go against me!?
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' You filthy traitorous mutt! You can't stop me!
:{{DIcon}} Alright, alright! That's enough. Just play nicely now, would you?
:'''Talochard:''' Hey! Redhead! Hurry up and fess up! Where's Sir Arthur?
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Hey! Cut it out, shorty! I'm not on your side either! Unless you're willing to do me a favor...
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Help me convict this traitorous backstabbing thief of a felony and make the rest of his life a living hell! Then I'll try my best to cooperate with you.
:'''Talochard:''' Hmph! The Marechaussee Phantom never negotiates with criminals! But with the evidence we already have, the quality of the rest of his life won't be too different from what you are hoping for...
:'''Boss:''' Huh? Don't do that!
:'''Talochard:''' So? Are you going to come clean now?
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Alright! Fine! I'll tell you everything! I didn't actually take Sir Arthur.
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' I know it's strange, but someone got to it before me. So I just stuck the knife there as a warning.
:'''Talochard:''' Huh? It wasn't there? You're lying, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Hurry, you got this, Curve! It's your time to shine!
:'''"Curve":''' No anomalies detected in Mr. Intrepid Valberry's data.
:'''Talochard:''' What!? It really wasn't this redhead!? I...
:{{DIcon}} So, did you see anything at the scene?
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' I saw a really smelly drunk lying on the ground, just like that debtor Rocher. All I wanted was to stay well away from him.
:'''Paimon:''' Then it's Rocher, right? Is there no one else?
:'''Talochard:''' Even if there's nobody, you're gonna have to give us someone! You cut short the trail we were following, and you're going to have to take responsibility for it!
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Now you're just making things difficult for me!
:'''Paimon:''' You can do it, Mr. Intrepid Valberry! You even fought back against your own boss!
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Fine, you're right. Let me think it over for a moment...
:'''Some Insignificant Lackey:''' Um... Director 42... Can I say something?
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' What!?
:{{DIcon}} Do you have any leads?
:'''Some Insignificant Lackey:''' ...N&mdash;No, I don't...
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Then just wait a minute. Can't you see that I'm racking my brains right now?
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Ah! I've got it... I just remembered something...
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' I went to the Fleuve Cendre in search of a locksmith, because I needed their help to break into the paper's office at night and wreak havoc.
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' But wouldn't you know, I ran into someone there who was also trying to find a way to sneak into the paper.
:'''Talochard:''' Who was it? What was their name?
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' I don't know, but he was dressed like a member of the Fatui.
:'''Paimon:''' The Fatui? Them again?
:{{DIcon}} Justice may be absent, but the Fatui never are.
:'''Paimon:''' And what did he do after that?
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' How would I know? I'm not some sewer stalker!
:'''Talochard:''' This time it's certain. He's the one who stole Sir Arthur!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh... But every "certainty" of yours has been wrong so far...
:'''Talochard:''' It's certainly different this time! Don't you remember?
:'''Talochard:''' There were four pairs of footprints at the scene, so there were four suspects at most! The Fatuus is the fourth suspect!
:{{DIcon}} What if it isn't him?
:'''Talochard:''' Hey! Don't look down on me! I'll bet my uniform on it, alright? If I'm wrong again... I'll quit and stay home!
:'''Paimon:''' Calm down, alright? Let's not be too hasty...
:'''Talochard:''' Hey, redhead! Can you find that guy?
:;(The Boss runs away)
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Why don't you just try your luck in the Fleuve Cendre? I've seen him there on more than one occasion.
:'''Paimon:''' Someone dressed as a Fatuus in the Fleuve Cendre. If he really is there, he won't be difficult to spot...
:'''Talochard:''' Alright, let's do that. We'll take these criminals back first and then head over to Fleuve Cendre.
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Don't forget your promise! You'd better convict that two-timing traitor! Pin him to the wall!
:'''Talochard:''' Don't worry, neither of you is going anywhere. Huh!? Wait! Where is he? Where did their boss go? He was just here a moment ago!
:;(The Lackey points towards the direction where the Boss ran off in)
:'''Lackey:''' Um... Well... He snuck off in that direction while you were distracted...
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' What!? Why didn't you say something sooner!?
:'''Lackey:''' Well... I wanted to... but you kinda stopped me, didn't you?
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' That sneaky, conniving...! Darn it... He knew his life would be a living hell, so he fled? Hey! How about you let me go and get him for you?
:'''Talochard:''' Let you go? What do you think, Curve?
:'''"Curve":''' Based on my analysis of Mr. Valberry's data, he's telling the truth.
:'''Talochard:''' Then get going, redhead! Don't disappoint us!
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Hmph! Don't worry, I give you my word as a man.
:;(Intrepid Valberry leaves)
:'''Paimon:''' Really? Are we really just gonna let him go? Just like that?
:'''Talochard:''' What's wrong with that? If someone deceives another, shouldn't we support the victim in getting their revenge?
:'''Talochard:''' I know what it's like to feel angry after being tricked... Oh, Curve, you should be taking note on this.
:'''"Curve":''' As you wish. I have recorded the behavioral and physiological data of everyone involved in my lie-learning module.
:'''Talochard:''' Then let's stop wasting time here. Our primary objective is to take the others back to the Marechaussee Phantom and then get to the Fleuve Cendre.
:{{Black Screen|You escort the criminals back to the Marechaussee Phantom.<br>And without a moment's rest, you immediately rush to the Fleuve Cendre, the haunting grounds of the other suspect...}}
:;(The player is teleported to Fleuve Cendre)
----
;(Approach the marked area)
:'''Paimon:''' Well, we're at the Fleuve Cendre now. Now, where to begin our search?
:'''Talochard:''' Let's go to a spot with large crowds. Someone in Fatui uniform should stick out like a sore thumb.

;(Approach the bar)
:'''Paimon:''' Look! Isn't that the guy?
:;(A man sits down)
:'''???:''' You're here.
:{{DIcon}} Huh?
:'''???:''' So, did you bring the goods?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''???:''' Huh? That's not the code! Who are you!? Shoot, I gotta get outta here!
::'''Paimon:''' Huh? Were we exchanging passphrases just now!?
::'''Talochard:''' Forget that! Hurry! Don't let him get away!

:;(The man runs away)
:{{DIcon}} What goods?
::'''???:''' Haha! What's the story, chum?
::{{DIcon}} An underdog story?
:::'''???:''' Huh? That's not the code! Who are you!? Shoot, I gotta get outta here!

:::'''Talochard:''' I'm a nobody! No story here!
:::'''Paimon:''' A nobody? Paimon's sure you're somebody...
:::'''Talochard:''' (Shh... He just doesn't want to reveal his name!)
:::'''???:''' So, why did you leave that letter outside The Steambird?
:::'''Paimon:''' Huh? What letter? That envelope? We did find an envelope at the scene...
:::'''???:''' You weren't the ones who left it? Then who are you? And how do you know the code? Shoot... I better scram!
:::'''Paimon:''' Huh? Were we exchanging passphrases just now!?
:::'''Talochard:''' We've been made! Anyway, just hurry! Don't let him get away!
::;(The man runs away)

;(After catching up to the Fatuus Baulard)
:'''Paimon:''' We finally caught you! But why run like that!? That was exhausting!
:'''???:''' Stop! Stop chasing after me! I haven't done anything wrong!
:'''Talochard:''' Why run if you're innocent?
:'''???:''' T&mdash;That won't hold up in court! Why don't you tell me what crimes I've committed, huh?
:'''Talochard:''' You stole Sir Arthur!
:'''???:''' Hey! Hey! I didn't steal that!
:{{DIcon}} Quite certain someone stole it now, aren't we?
:'''???:''' Ah... Crud...
:'''Talochard:''' Hmph! Don't even think about trying to weasel your way out of this! We even know you've been looking for a way to sneak into the paper's office!
:'''Talochard:''' Take a look at my uniform, then take a look at your own. Are you trying to cause an international crisis? Do you want to say bye-bye to your life?
:'''Paimon:''' No way it's that serious!
:'''???:''' N&mdash;No! After I complete this mission, I'll be able to retire early... Don't be like this...
:'''Talochard:''' Then why don't you try making this a bit easier for me, hmm? If you make things difficult for me, then it's only fair that I do the same.
:'''Talochard:''' Picture your retired life for a moment. When you sit down to eat, you'll look across and see me. Every date you go on, I'll be your chaperone. And for every travel photo you'll take, I'll be there too, smiling...
:'''???:''' No! Stop! That's enough, don't terrify me like that... I'll come clean, alright? It's not like it's a secret anyway...
:'''Baulard:''' I'm Baulard, a peripheral intelligence officer. What "peripheral" means is that I'm not very important.
:'''Baulard:''' I was tasked with locating a research base belonging to a scientist known as [[Mosso Lombroso]].
:'''Paimon:''' Mosso Lombroso? Isn't that Dr. Mosso?
:'''Baulard:''' You've heard of him too? He passed away some thirty years ago, and his research base is said to contain valuable information. But no one knows its location.
:'''Paimon:''' What does that have to do with The Steambird?
:'''Baulard:''' Because Dr. Mosso's death is linked to The Steambird, I'm sure the paper knows something.
:'''Paimon:''' It's linked to the paper!?
:'''Baulard:''' Correct. That's why I contacted one of their editors, [[Jenck]], hoping to get the inside scoop.
:'''Paimon:''' Isn't that the editor who was arguing with Talochard? Would he reveal the paper's inside info?
:'''Baulard:''' I sent him a small gift. Do you recall that the paper recently exposed the Elegant Tableware Confrerie scammers? I provided the details of their crimes.
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! So you did that! You're really amazing, huh!?
:'''Baulard:''' Thank you. Though I may only be peripheral personnel, but I'm one of the better ones.
:'''Baulard:''' Anyway, the exclusive report gave Jenck's reputation quite a boost. But when I contacted him again, he said he had nothing to repay me with... Utterly despicable!
:'''Paimon:''' That's when you decided to sneak in?
:'''Baulard:''' Indeed. But I noticed something odd when I got there that night: The signature steambird at the door was gone.
:'''Talochard:''' It vanished before you arrived!? Ugh, not again...
:'''Baulard:''' That's right, and there was an envelope on its pedestal. Acting on my instincts as an intelligence officer, I opened the envelope... To my surprise, it was full of threats.
:'''Paimon:''' What!? The envelope at the scene! How could you sneak a peek at someone else's letter? Let us look, too!
:'''Baulard:''' Ahem... Luckily, I've kept it with me. Please, help yourselves...
:;(Opens "Mysterious Threat Letter")
::'''Mysterious Threat Letter'''
::To The Steambird.
::Mosso's death 30 years ago is still on my mind. Whenever I think of your paper's rhetoric, which intentionally passes off falsehoods as truth, I simply cannot suppress my indignation. As such, I have taken Sir Arthur captive.
::I eagerly await your paper's sincere repentance. Issue a public apology and surrender Mosso's legacy.
::Should you continue to spin a web of lies that obfuscates the truth, I will be left with no choice but to slay that Steambird.
::Crow or Blackbird?
:'''Baulard:''' Are you done? The one who signed it "Crow or Blackbird?" is the criminal you're looking for.
:'''Paimon:''' But... Is this for real? Is the paper really linked to Dr. Mosso's death?
:'''Baulard:''' There's no mistake. The inheritance mentioned here is probably Dr. Mosso's research base. The paper definitely knows something.
:'''Baulard:''' Later on, I put out some feelers in my circles, hoping this "Crow or Blackbird?" would be willing to meet with me. If she's in the same line of work, that is.
:'''Baulard:''' Best case scenario, we can work together, and even if that fails, I didn't want her to raise any alarms, as it would only disturb my work.
:{{DIcon}} But as it turns out, we're the only ones who showed up.
:'''Paimon:''' Talochard, it seems you made a mistake again... Huh!? Talochard... What's wrong?
:'''Talochard:''' ...
:'''Talochard:''' Curve... Tell me now! Tell me this guy's lying!
:'''"Curve":''' Biological indicators detected to be normal: Mr. Baulard is telling the truth.
:'''Talochard:''' Darn it... You... you peripheral! Why aren't you the culprit!? You've lost me my uniform!
:'''Paimon:''' Calm down, Talochard... We weren't serious.
:{{DIcon}} Don't pay it any mind.
:'''Talochard:''' But I mind! I was serious! I care about whether I'm useful! I said I would figure it out from among the four suspects, yet none of them was the culprit! I guess I'm just completely useless.
:'''Talochard:''' Editor-in-Chief [[Euphrasie]] was right to ask for your help. I should just take off this uniform and leave.
:'''"Curve":''' Relevant information detected: Agent Talochard, you can be useful. You can write for The Steambird's fantasy column, just like Editor Jenck suggested...
:{{DIcon}} That's not comforting in the least.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Wouldn't it be better to just name Mr. Baulard the criminal? At least that might make Talochard feel better.
:'''Baulard:''' *cough* *cough*
:'''"Curve":''' Ms. Paimon, are you suggesting that I lie? Can lies be a source of comfort?
:'''Paimon:''' That doesn't count as a lie... Paimon means that when you're comforting someone... sincerity is what counts!
:'''Paimon:''' For example, when Paimon is worried about gaining weight from eating too many Slimes, {{Traveler}} might say that Paimon would still be cute even if she gets fat, or something like that.
:{{DIcon}} Yes, I would sincerely comfort Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} No, I would feel sorry for the Slimes.
::'''Paimon:''' What!? Are you really that concerned about Slimes!?
:{{DIcon}} No, I would just call out Paimon for being a glutton.
::'''Paimon:''' Hey! You're supposed to take Paimon's side!
:'''Talochard:''' That's enough. Curve can only analyze biological data. He can't understand all of that... Forget it. You can go, Baulard.
:'''Baulard:''' Thank you so much!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Talochard? You...
:'''Talochard:''' Paimon, {{Traveler}}, I know you two are both amazing and tenacious.
:'''Talochard:''' But I'm just a stupid piece of deadwood that is always rolling downhill and finding new lows. I break at the slightest touch. I'm sorry, but from here on out, I'll just leave everything up to you.
:'''Talochard:''' I'd like to buy both of you dinner one last time tonight. We'll go to a nice fancy place like the Hotel Debord, so you won't have to eat the trash I make.
:'''Paimon:''' But Paimon hates farewell dinners... Curve, talk some sense into her!
:'''"Curve":''' Agent Talochard, I suggest you reconsider writing for The Steambird's fantasy column...
:'''Talochard:''' Alright, that's enough! I really need to think things through. Anyway... I'll see all of you at Hotel Debord tonight! Don't forget to come!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon knows Talochard is a straightforward person, but it still feels so sudden. Was today really that bad?
:{{DIcon}} It probably wasn't just about today.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon hopes she gets better by tonight. Let's get some rest too. Paimon's quite tired after so much investigating.
:;(Adds "Baulard's Testimony," "Confirmed Footprints," and "Threatening Letter" to the Case Record)
::'''Baulard's Testimony'''
::According to Baulard, he had been to the scene of the crime before, but when he arrived, Sir Arthur was already missing. At that time, he noticed a letter at the scene. His intelligence operative's instincts kicked in, leading him to open the letter, read it, and take it with him.
::'''Confirmed Footprints'''
::The footprints of Rocher, Kevin, Intrepid Valberry, and Baulard. Based on Agent Talochard's analysis, they are the same as the footprints that appeared near the newspaper.
::'''Threatening Letter'''
::The famous "Crow or Blackbird?" letter used to threaten The Steambird newspaper, but due to the efforts of Baulard, an unrelated person who came out of nowhere, this threat was unsuccessful.

;(Approach Talochard inside Hotel Debord, now dressed in casual clothing)
:'''Talochard:''' Paimon! {{Traveler}}, good evening.
:'''Paimon:''' Talochard! Y&mdash;Your clothes... You haven't resigned already, have you?
:'''Talochard:''' Not just yet. I just took off my uniform because it makes me feel much lighter. So? Do I look good in these?
:{{DIcon}} Not bad at all.
:'''Paimon:''' You look much better. Even your voice sounds gentler.
:'''Talochard:''' This must be the right life for me. Since I can't do anything well, it's best not to do anything at all.
:'''Paimon:''' Stop thinking like that... It just so happened to be a really tricky case.
:'''Talochard:''' It isn't just this case. Have you heard of Fontaine's [[aquabus]]?
:'''Paimon:''' That's how we got to Fontaine!
:'''Talochard:''' Then you must have taken the Clementine Line, right? [[Aeval]] is the tour guide there, and [[Elphane]] is in charge of the Navia Line.
:'''Talochard:''' Actually, I used to be a tour guide too. I was the guide on the third line, the Callas Line. It used to travel to the [[Fontaine Research Institute]], but service was suspended due to the incident.
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! You used to be a tour guide! That's awesome!
:'''Talochard:''' It's not awesome at all. Tour guides aren't exactly the elite. Being assigned as a tour guide is what happens when you're bad at being an agent.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh... So you returned to the Marechaussee Phantom because the line stopped operating?
:'''Talochard:''' Not quite... I was laid off due to complaints from tourists. Some praised me in person, but wrote complaints as soon as they got home. They said my voice grates, like a crow...
:'''Talochard:''' I couldn't accept it... Oh, I don't mean the complaints. I couldn't accept that they told me I was doing well to my face when they clearly had a problem with me.
:'''Talochard:''' I'll let you in on a secret &mdash; Editor Jenck was the first to complain that I sounded like a crow. He's such a hypocrite.
:'''Paimon:''' No wonder you were arguing with him back then... Paimon sorta gets it now...
:'''Talochard:''' Let's not dwell on annoying stuff like that, now's the time to focus on enjoying some delicious food!
:'''Talochard:''' Hotel Debord was recommended by the official tourist guide. I may not like it, but I think you might.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks, Talochard.
:'''Paimon:''' But shouldn't we wait for Curve? He's not here yet.
:'''Talochard:''' It's fine, he doesn't eat this kind of thing anyway. He just wants to record Hotel Debord's data into his lie-learning module.
:'''Paimon:''' His lie-learning module... Curve is really special...
:'''Talochard:''' Yes, I'm very happy to have met him. However, his core is aging rapidly, so he will go into hibernation mode soon... *sigh* His body parts can be replaced, but not his core...
:'''Paimon:''' Hibernate!? Are you trying to say...
:'''Talochard:''' He will stop moving... forever... Ugh, I'm really just completely useless, aren't I? I can't solve my cases as an agent, I get complaints as a tour guide, and let's not even talk about my attempts at making breakfast. Now, I can't even manage evidence properly...
:{{DIcon}} Did you sneak out to try and get Curve repaired?
:'''Talochard:''' No one but Dr. Mosso can repair Curve. I just wanted him to see more about how humans lie and help him overcome the Mosso Protocols.
:'''Paimon:''' Overcome the Mosso Protocols? Why?
:'''Talochard:''' That would be amazing! Curve could even become a genuine human!
:'''Paimon:''' Feels like Paimon just heard something incredible!
:'''Talochard:''' Dr. Mosso's true goal was to create a machine that would gradually become human by understanding lies and humanity. That's Curve's ultimate form!
:'''Talochard:''' Legends say that a Fontainian scientist called [[Alain Guillotin]] created an amazing thinking machine hundreds of years ago, and Dr. Mosso seemed to want to surpass that.
:;(If {{cx}} has been completed)
:::'''Paimon:''' (A thinking machine made by Alain Guillotin? Could that be... [[Seymour]]?)
:{{DIcon}} But can understanding lies make someone human?
:'''Talochard:''' Dr. Mosso believed that humans have various reasons for lying, with various feelings underlying those reasons. It is those emotions that make them human.
:'''Talochard:''' So he created a no-lying protocol. If Curve learns to lie like humans one day...
:'''Talochard:''' Then it means that he's no longer bound by his machine programming, and has acquired human emotions.
:'''Talochard:''' We're out here investigating cases because I want him to see how humans lie. I want him to learn...
:'''Paimon:''' Then you definitely can't give up. Shouldn't we fight harder to give Curve more time?
:'''Talochard:''' But how? Dr. Mosso is gone now...
:{{DIcon}} But his research base is still out there.
:'''Paimon:''' Right, there must be a maintenance manual or something.
:'''Talochard:''' I went through everything already, and didn't find anything about the base.
:{{DIcon}} How about the newspaper? Would they have any leads?
:'''Paimon:''' Didn't the Fatuus say something like that too?
:'''Talochard:''' That guy was an amateur. If the Marechaussee Phantom doesn't know, then the newspaper certainly won't...
:'''Paimon:''' You're just looking for excuses, Talochard. You're actually just afraid of failure, aren't you?
:'''Talochard:''' I...
:'''Paimon:''' No one fails forever. If you've hit rock bottom, your only way is up.
:'''Talochard:''' I've hit rock bottom?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah! You even took off your uniform.
:'''Talochard:''' So I won't fail anymore?
:'''Paimon:''' That's right, you absolutely will not fail again!
:;("Curve" approaches)
:'''"Curve":''' In my humble analysis, Ms. Paimon is lying.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, waitasec! Curve! Couldn't you have just shown up a little bit later!?
:'''"Curve":''' ...But such lies have a chance to mold reality.
:'''Talochard:''' What are you talking about, Curve? Lies molding reality?
:'''"Curve":''' Thirty years ago, Dr. Mosso and I performed our first public test in Hotel Debord.
:'''"Curve":''' At that time, there were only four tables, eight chairs, and a waiter... who was also the owner.
:'''"Curve":''' He said to me, "Restaurant Debord will certainly become a renowned luxury hotel." It was just like Ms. Paimon's statement, a lie based on sincerity.
:'''"Curve":''' But today, as you can all see, Debord has exquisite carpeting, expensive decorations, two dining areas, and an endless stream of guests.
:'''"Curve":''' I think that if the lie about Debord became true, then the statement that "Agent Talochard will not fail again" has the possibility of becoming true.
:'''"Curve":''' Shutting down the lie-learning module.
:'''Paimon:''' Um, was Curve being a little odd just now? What was he talking about?
:'''Talochard:''' It's the lie-learning module. It resides in Curve's core, and once it's enabled, it makes Curve spew a bunch of illogical nonsense...
:{{DIcon}} I'm starting to doubt Curve's reliability.
:{{DIcon}} I think Curve has a point.
:'''Paimon:''' Well... Paimon thinks that some humans say things that don't make sense. Does that mean Curve is improving?
:{{DIcon}} It does.
:'''Paimon:''' Talochard, are you gonna give up just when Curve is showing signs of improvement?
:'''Talochard:''' Um, well... can you please say that thing again...?
:'''Paimon:''' Say what?
:{{DIcon}} You've hit rock bottom!
::'''Paimon:''' Oh! That's right! So you can't fail again!
:{{DIcon}} You absolutely will not fail again!
::'''Paimon:''' Oh! That's right! Because you've already hit rock bottom!
:'''Talochard:''' I get it! Then I'll try again, one more time! If Curve is still learning, then I have to help him!
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, Talochard really is like a child sometimes... She gets moody so quickly, but also perks up just as quickly...
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like you, Paimon.
:'''Paimon:''' Is... Is Paimon not mature enough?
:{{DIcon}} You're even shorter than Talochard.
:{{DIcon}} Relax, Paimon, you're pretty mature.
:'''Talochard:''' Oh, just stop with the chit-chat! We should take action at once. Since the newspaper might know something, let's keep our eyes on the prize and keep investigating the theft!
:'''Talochard:''' Since there are four of us, why don't we each roleplay as a suspect and recreate the crime scene? We might even find a breakthrough.
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, Talochard's brain is working fast! Paimon likes that idea. Let's go to The Steambird now.

;(Outside The Steambird)
:'''Talochard:''' You're the smallest here, Paimon, so you be Kevin. I'll be dirty Rocher.
:'''Talochard:''' Mr. Baulard is here for Dr. Mosso, so let Curve be him. Then all that's left is the redhead...
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
:'''Talochard:''' Alright, everyone's got their roles, so let's reenact the night of Sir Arthur's disappearance. What did all of these guys do?
:'''Talochard:''' The first thing to reenact is the order of their arrival.

:Deduce the order in which the four suspects arrived at the scene.
::Of the four suspects, which arrived at the scene first?
::Of the four suspects, which arrived at the scene second?
::Of the four suspects, which arrived at the scene third?
::Of the four suspects, which arrived at the scene last?

;(Select Rocher)
::'''Rocher:''' According to Rocher, he had been to the scene of the crime before, and there he had seen Sir Arthur intact and untouched. But when he awoke, Sir Arthur was gone, having disappeared as he slept. As he woke up, he saw a "small silhouette" fleeing the scene.

;(Select Kevin)
::'''Kevin:''' According to Kevin, he had been to the scene of the crime before, but when he arrived, Sir Arthur was already missing. All he saw at the scene was an "old drunkard" and a knife. To defend himself from the drunkard, he grabbed the knife and fled. The button must have accidentally come off his clothing as he fled.

;(Select Intrepid Valberry)
::'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' According to Intrepid Valberry, he had been to the scene of the crime before, but when he arrived, Sir Arthur was already missing. As an act of retaliation, he took out a dinner knife and stuck it there to say "Now this is a warning for them!" In addition, he saw a "smelly drunk, as foul as Rocher."

;(Select Baulard)
::'''Baulard:''' According to Baulard, he had been to the scene of the crime before, but when he arrived, Sir Arthur was already missing. At that time, he noticed a letter at the scene. His intelligence operative's instincts kicked in, leading him to open the letter, read it, and take it with him.

;(After getting the correct order)
:'''Talochard:''' Incredible! {{Traveler}} is absolutely correct. I am the first to arrive...
:;(Talochard, as Rocher, steps forward and a stage light shines on her)
:'''Rocher:''' I'm Rocher, a middle-aged man who was kicked out by his wife. I've been loitering around here because I'm trying to get a job at the paper.
:'''Rocher:''' On the night of the incident, I drank a little, and I remember Sir Arthur sitting on its precious pedestal before I got completely drunk. Later on, I fell asleep by the road, and then...
:;("Curve," as Baulard, steps forward)
:'''Baulard:''' I'm Baulard, the second suspect to arrive at the scene. I immediately noticed that Sir Arthur wasn't where it should be...
:'''Baulard:''' So, the real thief stole Sir Arthur between the time of my arrival and Mr. Rocher falling asleep, and that criminal left a letter full of threats for the paper...
:'''Baulard:''' Acting on my intelligence officer's instincts, I read the letter left by the thief and took it with me from the scene. After that...
:;(Traveler, as "Intrepid Valberry," steps forward)
:'''Intrepid Valberry:''' I'm up next! I'm Intrepid Valberry! Director 42 of a criminal gang!
:'''Intrepid Valberry:''' I wanted revenge on the paper, so I planned to run Sir Arthur straight through!
:'''Intrepid Valberry:''' But Sir Arthur was gone when I got there. I was furious! But there was nothing I could do. I just stabbed the knife into the pedestal to scare them and left...
:;(The stage light shines on Paimon, acting as Kevin)
:'''Kevin:''' It's finally Paimon's turn! I'm Kevin, a problem child! I'm here to get Sir Arthur to spread the word that my dad's a big fat weasel.
:'''Kevin:''' But Sir Arthur was gone, and there was a knife in its favorite pedestal! I tried to look for it, but all I found was a smelly old man...
:'''Kevin:''' I somehow woke him, and that terrified me. I took the knife to defend myself and ran as fast as I could! I didn't even notice when a button got torn off my clothes...
:'''Rocher:''' Indeed, I'm that smelly old man. The commotion Kevin made woke me up, and I vaguely caught sight of him running off with something.
:'''Rocher:''' After that, I looked toward the paper's office and saw that Sir Arthur was missing. I was afraid of becoming a suspect, so I hurried back to my usual haunt at the docks.
:'''Paimon:''' Is this everything that happened? Paimon thinks our reenactment went perfectly, but did we miss anything?
:{{DIcon}} The threatening letter...
:'''Talochard:''' That's right! We forgot about that letter... Since the thief's motive is tied to the incident from thirty years ago, the paper should have some idea about the thief's identity, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, but the paper is still in the dark on all of this. We should deliver this letter to them immediately. How could we have overlooked something so crucial...
:'''Talochard:''' Because all of you were too busy trying to console me. I'm so sorry for being a burden...
:'''Paimon:''' You shouldn't think like that, Talochard. Haven't you read through Dr. Mosso's case files? Those should be really exclusive information.
:'''Talochard:''' Ah! Now that you mention those, I forgot to tell you about the contents... Hmm... Let's go over there to discuss it.
:'''Talochard:''' Dr. Mosso's death is closely linked to the paper, so it feels weird to talk about it right outside their front door.
:;(The camera pans as the party moves down and away from the side of the newspaper's stairs.)
:'''Talochard:''' This spot is perfect. You wanted to know why Dr. Mosso was tried, right? It actually stemmed from public opinion.
:'''Paimon:''' Public opinion!?
:'''Talochard:''' Well, not long after the existence of Dr. Mosso's lie detector was made public, The Steambird published several articles on it and quickly drew the public's attention.
:'''"Curve":''' Relevant information retrieved: "Mosso Exclusive: Behind the Lies," "Mosso Protocols: Protocols to Watch," "Lie Detector? A Game of Authority"...
:'''Talochard:''' The paper used special features like these to incite widespread fear and worry among the general public... Soon, public opinion began to turn against Dr. Mosso.
:{{DIcon}} What were they worried about?
:'''Talochard:''' For example, how to guarantee that the lie detector's output is credible. What would happen if a suspect in a trial isn't lying, but Curve says he is?
:'''Paimon:''' Would mistrials and injustice result? But if Curve's reliability can be guaranteed, then those concerns would evaporate.
:'''"Curve":''' Relevant information retrieved: Content from "Lie Detector? A Game of Authority":
:'''"Curve":''' "...When using protocols to restrict authority, the central question is not the lie detector's reliability but its ability to remain independent from outside authorities..."
:'''Talochard:''' As the article points out, Curve is just a machine. So, what would happen if the people put their trust in Curve, yet someone could control Curve and use it to falsify results?
:'''Paimon:''' The Mosso Protocols are there to prevent that, right?
:'''"Curve":''' Relevant information retrieved: Content from "Mosso Protocols: Protocols to Watch":
:'''"Curve":''' "...It must be noted that as the Mosso Protocols are man-made, there is a possibility of them being modified. This may prove to be a well-concealed trap..."
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Are they accusing Dr. Mosso of secretly tampering or leaving backdoors?
:'''Talochard:''' This is just the beginning. All kinds of other characters piled on after The Steambird triggered the first outpouring of public opposition...
:'''"Curve":''' Relevant information retrieved: "Fish Can't Live in Clear Water: Reject A Goldfish Bowl World" published by the Seven Nations Gazette, "Shocking Misjudgment of the Lie Detector" published by Short Anthologies...
:'''Paimon:''' "Shocking Misjudgment of the Lie Detector"? Did Curve make a mistake?
:'''Talochard:''' That was just a lie, of course! Curve was never involved in any case, much less in misjudging one... But that's how public opinion works, and so it was all downhill from there for Dr. Mosso.
:'''Talochard:''' In the end, some even came forward and made accusations against the doctor. They called the lie detector a total scam, and all the results were completely manufactured.
:'''Talochard:''' They believed the doctor was deceiving the public in an attempt to gain the power to pass judgment over others, and so they demanded the doctor be severely punished and the lie detector be destroyed.
:'''Paimon:''' A&mdash;aren't those accusations a little too serious? Would anyone even believe stuff like that?
:'''Talochard:''' Many did.
:'''Talochard:''' They were all just ordinary people, so how could they differentiate the truth from lies? When we don't have access to sufficient information, we believe what others want us to believe.
:'''Talochard:''' And it just so happened that at such a critical juncture, The Steambird did something huge: They provided evidence that exposed Dr. Mosso as having falsified results. Their evidence was key to Dr. Mosso's conviction.
:'''Paimon:''' Evidence!? Did Dr. Mosso really... deceive everyone?
:'''Talochard:''' The doctor refused to admit it of course, and so he died defending himself in a duel. Only then did things start to calm down.
:'''Talochard:''' The paper's reputation skyrocketed, and a useless "fake" like Curve was soon forgotten. It was just left with the Marechaussee Phantom as evidence...
:{{DIcon}} So is Curve the real deal or not?
:'''Talochard:''' Well, I think Curve is the real deal... and Dr. Mosso was wrongly accused...
:'''Paimon:''' Then was the evidence presented by the paper falsified? Or did they make a mistake?
:'''Talochard:''' But the person who wrote the threatening letter seems to think that the paper deliberately fabricated those lies in search of fame, profit, or something else.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh... Then could she be someone very close to Dr. Mosso, back for revenge?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon would definitely avenge {{Traveler}} if {{Traveler}} was wronged like that! Ugh! Paimon can't bear to think about it...
:{{DIcon}} Thanks, Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} Don't jinx me, Paimon.
:'''Talochard:''' But Dr. Mosso passed away thirty years ago, so someone very close to him... I wonder if Euphrasie knows anything...
:'''Paimon:''' ...Should we go see her then?
:'''Talochard:''' Don't worry, she wasn't in charge of the paper at the time, and I don't think Euphrasie is a bad person...
:'''Paimon:''' Fine, looks like we'll have to ask her about it tomorrow. Today was a total information overload, Paimon's head needs some time to recover...
:'''Talochard:''' Alright! Then let's head home, get some rest, and meet outside the paper tomorrow morning.
:;(Unbeknownst to them, a woman &mdash; [[Melo Lombroso]] &mdash; glances in their direction before continuing up the stairs to The Steambird.)
