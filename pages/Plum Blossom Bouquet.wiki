'''Plum Blossom Bouquet''' is [[Hu Tao]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Hu Tao's hair is styled into two high twintails parted with a zig-zag pattern. Her bangs are side-swept to her left, the layers framing her face curled inwards and the layers behind curled outwards, with two shoulder-length locks of hair in front of her ears left loose. She wears a black porkpie hat emblazoned with a wooden talisman, adorned with a red plum blossom branch in bloom, along with an indigo tassel tied in a looped knot.

Hu Tao wears a traditional red shirt with a mandarin collar, a brown coat with a darker collar and sleeve cuffs, and black shorts with gold accents. Her Pyro Vision is embedded in the back of her coat, along with long rectangular coattails, and golden brooches attached underneath her coat's collar and waist. She wears a pair of mid-calf length white socks, red straps with plum blossoms wrapped around the cuffs, along with low-heeled black dress shoes. Her fingernails are painted black, and she wears multiple rings: one on her left ring finger, one on her right thumb, and one on each of her index and middle fingers. She wears a loose red bracelet on her right hand, though her long sleeves usually hide it.
