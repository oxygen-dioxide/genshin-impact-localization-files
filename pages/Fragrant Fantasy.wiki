{{Description|Flowers and trees intertwine, mingling together to create a melody of fragrance.<br>Embark on a perfume-making journey with Miss Emilie~}}
'''Fragrant Fantasy''' is a [[Web Event]] in [[Version 4.7]].

==Event Details==
===Event Duration===
* July 9, 2024 – July 15, 2024 23:59 (UTC+8)

===Eligibility===
* Travelers who have reached Adventure Rank 10 or above can participate in this event.

===Event Description===
* During the event, you can log into Genshin Impact daily, consume Original Resin, claim Commission Rewards, and complete other missions to obtain card packs.
* Open the card pack at the workbench to obtain any Plant and Omni Cards. Plant and Omni Cards can be used to blend perfumes. You can obtain different grades of perfume based on the level of cards used.
* After successfully blending perfumes, you can obtain Primogems and other in-game rewards based on the total number of perfumes made. Meanwhile, you can give these perfumes to Furina, Navia, and Sigewinne, and they will provide different feedback and evaluations based on the perfumes gifted.
* You will receive fragrance reports from different companions for each bottle of perfume gifted. Give out perfume and share your fragrance report to obtain Primogems and other in-game rewards.

==Obtain Ingredients==
You can obtain card packs through the following methods and open them at the workbench to receive the corresponding Plant or Omni Cards:
# Complete the following actions in Genshin Impact and the web event every day: log into Genshin Impact every day, consume 40 Original Resin, and complete other missions to receive the corresponding number of plant card packs.
#* Log in to the web event daily
#* Log in to Genshin Impact daily
#* Claim Commission Rewards 2 times daily
#* Use 40 Original Resin daily
#* Watch Version 4.8 "Summertide Scales and Tales" Trailer | Genshin Impact
#* Watch Outfit Teaser: Teyvat Style – Simulanka's Blessings | Genshin Impact
# Daily missions refresh at 04:00 (Server Time) each day. Unclaimed plant card packs will also be cleared by then. Please claim and use them in time. Claimed plant card packs will not be cleared.
# If you try to visit the event at around 04:00 (Server Time), which is when the daily missions refresh, you may encounter a brief network error. Please refresh the page if you encounter this error.

==Make Perfumes==
# You need to place three different plant cards separately when making perfume. These plant cards have mutually exclusive relationships. You can open the Perfume Handbook on the left side of the workbench to read the relevant information on perfume blending. Using different plant cards will result in perfumes with different fragrances and colors.
# Two same basic plant cards can be merged into an advanced plant card. To merge cards, simply drag 2 of the same cards in the same slot on the "make purfume" screen. Three advanced plant cards can be used to make a premium perfume.
# You have the opportunity to draw Omni Cards from card packs. Omni Cards can be used to replace any basic or advanced plant cards. Additionally, when you use three Omni Cards to blend perfume, it will automatically create a perfume that you have yet to own.
# Failing to blend a perfume does not deduct plant cards and you can try again multiple times.
# During the blending process, you can visit the Exchange Shop at any time and use available plant cards that you no longer require to exchange for plant cards of the same level that you need.
# Once you have successfully blended a perfume, you can send it to a companion. The corresponding companion will give different feedback based on the perfume you send out.

*If you exit in the middle of the blending process, plant cards will not be deducted.
*If you try to blend perfumes at around 04:00 (Server Time), which is when the daily missions refresh, you may encounter a brief network error. Please refresh the page if you encounter this error.

|rowspan=2|The top note carries with it the bright, refreshing fragrance of Bulle Fruit. As time passes, this scent gradually begins to fade, and the warm, rich aroma of Marcotte takes its place, reminiscent of an elegant lady strolling through the countryside outside the Court of Fontaine. Finally, the light, lingering scent of Lumidouce Bells rises up, bringing this perfume to its perfect conclusion.

The bracing fragrance of Lakelight Lily complements the slightly sour sweetness of Bulle Fruit, delivering a cool, perfectly balanced freshness. The base notes carry a light trace of Lumidouce Bells, allowing the coolness of Lakelight Lily and the sweetness of Bulle Fruit to gradually rise up, resulting in a delightfully refreshing aroma, seemingly capable of dispelling all gloomy weather and dreary moods. Cheers!

A cool minty freshness and the woody aroma of Cypress Wood serve to highlight the fragrance of Marcotte itself. Over time, the different layers of the Marcotte's smooth, gentle fragrance gradually unfold, as if you were holding a bouquet of flowers freshly picked from the garden. May your days be filled with happiness as you journey onward, armed with this symbol of the most sincere care.
