==Trivia==
* Before unlocking this area, the location of the [[Statue of The Seven]] in this area isn't shown on the map.
* Before completing the quest ''[[For Fruits, Seeds, and Trees]]'', trying to step into Lost Nursery is regarded as [[Out of Bounds]] &mdash; [[Paimon]] will appear and force the character to travel back, although Lost Nursery isn't out of the red border on map.
** Before Paimon forces you to go back, [[The Withering]] can be found here. It’s tied with [[Mawtiyima]] for having the worst Withering effect in the game, starting at four bars.
** However, it's possible to visit the area freely before completing the quest by abusing certain mechanics.
* As of [[Version 3.0]], Lost Nursery is the smallest area available in game.
