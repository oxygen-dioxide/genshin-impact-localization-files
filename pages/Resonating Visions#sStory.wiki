|As the Poet Plies Parts of Ether and Earth
|{{A|vo event conch dream kazuha 01.ogg}} "I have traveled far and wide in Inazuma since leaving home, and seen many new things along the way. Though material luxuries have not been a feature of my journey, it has yet been a rich and rewarding one, with the boundless earth and sky to call my abode, and all the wonders of nature as my partners in poetry."

:'''Projection of Geochanter Bracer:''' Well, the waves were really choppy, so I slipped and fell while carrying the device. Fortunately, I was quick enough to save it...
:'''Projection of Geochanter Bracer:''' But the commander still gave me an earful and ordered our squad to do signal reception tests. I mean, ugh, that's the toughest job around...

:'''Projection of Geochanter Bracer:''' Agafya, Persikov has ordered us to perform some signal reception tests. Looks like all four of us have to go... Chevka will probably get mad at me.
