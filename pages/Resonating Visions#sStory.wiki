|As the Poet Plies Parts of Ether and Earth
|{{A|vo event conch dream kazuha 01.ogg}} "I have traveled far and wide in Inazuma since leaving home, and seen many new things along the way. Though material luxuries have not been a feature of my journey, it has yet been a rich and rewarding one, with the boundless earth and sky to call my abode, and all the wonders of nature as my partners in poetry."

:'''Projection of Geochanter Bracer:''' Well, the waves were really choppy, so I slipped and fell while carrying the device. Fortunately, I was quick enough to save it...
