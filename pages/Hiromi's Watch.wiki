{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Hiromi)
:'''Hiromi:''' Yo, outlander! What are you doing sneaking around?
:{{DIcon}} I'm just passing through.
:{{DIcon}} You know, maybe you're the sneaky one here.
:'''Hiromi:''' Don't bother me with anything unimportant, outlander. Otherwise, I'll kindly have you accompany me to the [[Outlander Affairs Agency]].
:'''Hiromi:''' I have no idea how you got here, but it's a criminal offense to interfere with a samurai's job.
:'''Hiromi:''' The Kanjou Commissioner will punish you severely should he find out.
:'''Hiromi:''' So I'd advise you to stay back &mdash; for your own safety.
:{{DIcon}} [[Kanjou Commission]]?
:'''Hiromi:''' Are you serious? Do you outlanders not fear the Commissioner anymore nowadays?
:{{DIcon}} I don't see this place being under Kanjou jurisdiction.
:{{DIcon}} You're not on the job right now, are you?
:'''Hiromi:''' You...!
:'''Hiromi:''' You're not wrong... But even a samurai has a right to some free time. You outlanders wouldn't understand!
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Hiromi:''' None of your business.
::'''Hiromi:''' Alright, I'll... let you go this time. Just please, leave me alone.
:{{DIcon}} Are you waiting for someone?
::'''Hiromi:''' ... So what if I am?
::{{DIcon}} Don't worry, just asking.
::'''Hiromi:''' Please don't ask me pointless questions while I'm on duty.
::'''Hiromi:''' Come on, please stop bothering me. Please leave.

;(Talk to Hiromi again)
:'''Hiromi:''' Why'd you come again? If you've got something to say, hurry up!
:'''Hiromi:''' Don't interrupt a man while he's waiting for someone!
:{{DIcon}} Waiting for someone far outside his realm of jurisdiction?
:'''Hiromi:''' What are you trying to say?
:{{DIcon}} Not some proper folk you're meeting, eh?
:'''Hiromi:''' O&mdash;Of course I wouldn't... Are you questioning a public servant?
:'''Hiromi:''' I'm on duty and waiting for my informant... a contact...
:{{DIcon}} Speak up, I can barely hear you anymore.
:'''Hiromi:''' Ugh, enough! Leave, or you'll be coming with me to the Outlander Affairs Agency on charges of obstructing a personnel on official duty!
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
:{{DIcon}} Why, yes! Let's go, shall we?
:'''Hiromi:''' !?
:'''Hiromi:''' Are you not afraid of being deported by the Commissioner?
:{{DIcon}} I feel like yours is the more evident misdemeanor.
:{{DIcon}} Oh, I have my ways.
:'''Hiromi:''' ...
:'''Hiromi:''' Please don't report this matter to the Commissioner.
:'''Hiromi:''' But... I still don't get it. What is it that you want to know?
:'''Hiromi:''' I'm just a low-ranking officer. I don't know much beyond my duties. I don't think I'll be of much help to you.
:{{DIcon}} Well, I can help you.
:{{DIcon}} I just can't stand the way you're going on like this.
:'''Hiromi:''' I... can't believe an outlander would understand the honor of a samurai. You have my respect.
:{{DIcon}} Ah, a public servant and a honeyed tongue.
:'''Hiromi:''' Alright, please don't mock me anymore. I sincerely apologize for my rudeness. Please accept my apology.
:'''Hiromi:''' By the way, I don't believe that you've given me your name...
:{{DIcon}} Call me (Traveler).
:'''Hiromi:''' Well, (Traveler), since you're willing to help, I do have something to ask of you.
:'''Hiromi:''' Here's how it is. I have a childhood friend &mdash; an outlander &mdash; whom I haven't been able to meet since the [[Sakoku Decree]] came into effect.
:'''Hiromi:''' I was worried about her safety, so I started putting letters into drifting bottles in hopes that she'd receive them.
:'''Hiromi:''' However, she still hasn't responded.
:{{DIcon}} Drifting bottles, you say?
:{{DIcon}} You said "drifting bottles," right?
:'''Hiromi:''' Yes, I did. What of it?
:{{DIcon}} Are you referring to this?
;(Opens item submission screen)

;(Talk to Hiromi again if no bottle submitted)
:'''Hiromi:''' Yes, I did. What of it?
:{{DIcon}} Are you referring to this?
;(Opens item submission screen)

;(Upon submitting [[Someone's Drifting Bottle]])
:'''Hiromi:''' This is it! Her badge is inside, too.
:'''Hiromi:''' I don't know how to thank you enough...
:{{DIcon}} You wouldn't mind me reading it, would you?
:'''Hiromi:''' Eh? What? Please don't...
:{{DIcon}} "Do you still remember the Uyuu Restaurant?"
:'''Hiromi:''' Uh...
:{{DIcon}} "We shall meet there..."
:'''Hiromi:''' Wait&mdash;
:{{DIcon}} "You will find money for wine attached herein."
:'''Hiromi:''' Okay&mdash;
:{{DIcon}} "But if you are not the one I was expecting to receive this letter..."
:'''Hiromi:''' Please stop reading it! (Traveler), that was very, incredibly rude of you!
:{{DIcon}} Look at you, being all serious.
:{{DIcon}} Were you like that when you were writing these letters, too?
:'''Hiromi:''' Stop messing around! If you want to help me, just say so!
:{{DIcon}} Sorry.
:{{DIcon}} Please continue.
:'''Hiromi:''' So recently, one of her... old friends told me that she is doing well. They're both adventurers exploring the world, so I trust his intel.
:'''Hiromi:''' Unfortunately, between all the duties I shoulder, it's impossible for me to venture that far out...
:'''Hiromi:''' I was going to ask him to deliver my letter for me, and we agreed to meet here.
:'''Hiromi:''' But all he thinks about is treasure. He hurriedly left for the ancient ruins on the northern part of [[Narukami Island]]... and I haven't heard from him since.
:'''Hiromi:''' I've been here several times already, finding time every day to wait for him here. But I can't keep making excuses to sneak off.
:'''Hiromi:''' That's why I was hoping that you could accompany me to find him, (Traveler).
:'''Hiromi:''' I suspect that it would take me a lot of time just to find those ruins, were I to go by myself.
:'''Hiromi:''' But with your help, we may yet save a lot of time.
:'''Hiromi:''' By the way, since you already have the bottle... you can hand it over to her as well.
:'''Hiromi:''' (Traveler), can I count on you for this?
:{{DIcon}} Alright.
:{{DIcon}} Let's find him.
:'''Hiromi:''' Aye aye, let's head out at once!
----
;(Upon arriving at the area)
:'''Hiromi:''' He should be around here. Let's split up and search.

;(Upon finding Shun)
:'''Shun:''' Huh? Why are you here? And who's that you've brought along?
:'''Shun:''' Didn't we agree to meet alone?
:'''Shun:''' Eh, I understand. But if it's about "that case," then tell your colleagues that it's not time yet.
:'''Hiromi:''' This isn't about that... it's the matter from last week. The one you promised me about.
:'''Shun:''' Oh? Not that case? Then which one are you talking about? I'm a law-abiding citizen these days, you know! I'm squeaky clean!
:'''Shun:''' This isn't the time we agree on, either way. I mean, I just got out of jail two weeks ago.
:'''Shun:''' Oh yeah, I've got it now... are you trying to preemptively arrest me to gain some credit?
:'''Hiromi:''' No, that's not it at all... And what gain would there be in catching someone like you?
:'''Shun:''' Ouch! Not in the feelings, man! I'm a least a Treasure Hoarder Cadre. I'll have you know that I'm pretty well-known on the streets, too!
:'''Shun:''' No, wait, I get it now! You must be&mdash;
:{{DIcon}} You're a Treasure Hoarder?
:{{DIcon}} An explanation would be nice, Hiromi.
:'''Hiromi:''' *sigh*
:'''Shun:''' Man, not even knowing who the Treasure Hoarders are... Is your colleague over here new or something?
:'''Hiromi:''' Shut up.
:'''Hiromi:''' Listen, (Traveler). Shun is my informant. Please, don't make an unnecessary fuss out of this.
:'''Hiromi:''' Look, {{sic|Kazu}}, I came here with this outl&mdash; I mean, friend of mine, to ask you about where "Big Sis" is. I... I want to get in touch with her again.
:'''Shun:''' Oh... Hahahahhaha!
:'''Hiromi:''' What on earth are you laughing at, huh? What's your issue?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, what he said.
:'''Shun:''' Hahaha, you're hilarious!
:'''Shun:''' So here's the skinny, Traveler. The three of us have known each other since we were wetting beds.
:'''Shun:''' This was back before the Sakoku Decree. Way before Hiromi became some stick-in-the-mud, too.
:'''Shun:''' *sigh* I mean, just look at what the Commission headquarters did to a good boy like him.
:'''Hiromi:''' With me, they turned a good boy into a public servant who protects the people. With him, they turned a bad boy into a Treasure Hoarder.
:'''Shun:''' Alright, alright, I'll be straight with you. See, you knew who we were before the Sakoku Decree was implemented, right?
:'''Shun:''' There you have it: that's why she left Inazuma.
:'''Shun:''' Bet you wrote about Uyuu Restaurant in your last letter, eh? Don't worry, I miss it too.
:'''Shun:''' We even had a drink there the day before the Sakoku Decree took effect.
:'''Shun:''' Everyone could tell what you were thinking, trust me.
:'''Shun:''' But well, isn't it a crying shame that your Shogun hates outlander drifters, eh?
:'''Hiromi:''' ...Let's just get back to business.
:'''Shun:''' Is any of this business?
:'''Shun:''' Alright, I'm done messing with you. And I'd love to help you too, but... I don't think I can.
:'''Hiromi:''' What do you mean?
:'''Shun:''' ...It's a long story.
:{{DIcon}} Oh look, my hand is itching! I think it wants to beat someone up!
::'''Hiromi:''' Wow, a coincidence. Mine does too!
:{{DIcon}} Get to the point, please.
:'''Shun:''' So, "Big Sis" and I were in Jueyun Karst not long ago. You know about Jueyun Karst, right?
:'''Shun:''' Home of the adepti, shiny golden [[Cor Lapis]], light blue [[Noctilucous Jade]], the works...
:'''Shun:''' That's where all the rare and exotic treasures gifted by heaven are buried, you know? They say that the adepti...
:{{DIcon}} Get to the point!
:{{DIcon}} I've been there.
:'''Shun:''' Oh, okay, okay. So "Big Sis" and I were casing Jueyun Karst... Everything was going well at first, and we were even able to conceal ourselves from the adepti...
:'''Shun:''' We planned on treating ourselves to something nice after casing that joint, and we were just about to head back...
:'''Shun:''' And then there was a whistling cry between the rocks and the sea, and two swords were drawn!
:'''Shun:''' Two people leapt in front of us &mdash; one man and one woman &mdash; yelling "Bandits! There's nowhere to run!"
:'''Shun:''' It was a pair of warriors from the [[Guhua Clan]]! That was it, we thought &mdash; we were done for! Oh yeah, and y'know, I've heard that man is named...
:{{DIcon}} Get. To. The. Point!
:'''Shun:''' So the man's called [[Sun Yu]] and the woman's called [[Little Que'er]].
:'''Shun:''' "Big Sis" and I had to split right there. I've got no clue where she is now.
:'''Hiromi:''' Thank you, (Traveler)! You saved me a lot of time there...
:'''Hiromi:''' The scope of our search has been narrowed down a lot. All you need to do now is... check with those two members of the Guhua Clan, and there shoudl be hope of finding her yet.
:'''Hiromi:''' This bottle and her badge... I can only rest easy after I've returned both of these to her.
:'''Hiromi:''' (Traveler), I'm embarrassed to ask, but can you please help me out?
:{{DIcon}} You're not going yourself?
:'''Hiromi:''' I... I have other duties. It will be hard for me to leave.
:'''Shun:''' Ooh, "I have other duties." Aah, "It will be hard for me to leave~"
:'''Shun:''' Hmph. You're useless!
:'''Shun:''' How can you take yourself seriously, what with your pathetic salary and having to flatter your superiors constantly?
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} Do you believe him?
::'''Hiromi:''' Shun's a pain and he's by no means a good man, but I can trust him.
::'''Shun:''' Hmph. Well, at least you've got a conscience.
:'''Shun:''' It's getting late, anyway. You should go back to your post.
:'''Shun:''' Ah, I don't know what to say... You want to be a good public servant and a lackey of the Commissioner...
:'''Shun:''' Yet you can't let go of our friendship or forget the throbbing of your heart...
:'''Shun:''' Even though your paths have diverged so much.
:'''Shun:''' You don't have the guts to make your own choices. You're just a wuss who throws your duties to others.
:'''Shun:''' ...But don't you worry, those choices will come back to you in the end.
:'''Shun:''' When that time comes, you won't be able to hide anymore.
:'''Hiromi:''' ...
:'''Hiromi:''' ...Don't you lecture me.
:'''Shun:''' That's right, that's right! How could I forget! I'm an outlander thief, and you're a public servant. You should be the one lecturing me!
:'''Shun:''' Well, Traveler, looks like it's your time to save the day again.
:'''Shun:''' I'm not gonna play house with this petty public servant a second longer. I've got my own job to do.
:{{DIcon}} You alright over there?
:{{DIcon}} Need some help?
:'''Hiromi:''' No, I'm fine, I'm fine.
:'''Hiromi:''' Well, he wasn't speaking complete nonsense.
:'''Hiromi:''' But I'm afraid that I still need you to do this for me, (Traveler).
:{{DIcon}} You're as stubborn as a mule.
:{{DIcon}} Just this once.
:'''Hiromi:''' Thanks... I will seize the next opportunity when it comes along with my own hands.
:'''Hiromi:''' Well, I'd best be back soon, or my superior will get mad. Thanks again for your help, (Traveler).
:'''Hiromi:''' Take care of yourself! If anything urgent should crop up, you know where to find me in [[Ritou]].

;(Talk to Shun again)
:'''Shun:''' If you've got something to say, say it fast. Us Treasure Hoarders, our time's not yours for the wastin'.
:{{DIcon}} So, about Hiromi...
:'''Shun:''' Ah, he's a good lad... But he's a big baby, too. He needs a bit more time to grow.
:'''Shun:''' So I say, but in the end, being immature is better than being evil.
:'''Shun:''' He has his livelihood and his responsibilities...
:'''Shun:''' It's not all his fault that he's scared to make choices.
:'''Shun:''' At least he's still got some choices to make.
----
;(Speak to Little Que'er)
:'''Little Que'er:''' If you have anything to say, please talk to my senior disciple. I know you don't like listening to me anyway.
:'''Little Que'er:''' Hmph... No one likes to listen to me...

;(Speak to Sun Yu)
:'''Sun Yu:''' Ah, it's you, Traveler. Your great name is known through Liyue Harbor. Might I inquire as to why you have elected to grace us with your...
:{{DIcon}} You're talking all funny.
:'''Sun Yu:''' Ah. I am presently trying to teach Que'er how to treat people with the proper etiquette. As the saying goes, "Those without credibility have no leg to stand on, and those without etiquette..."
:{{DIcon}} Fair, but there's no need to be so formal.
:{{DIcon}} You were giving me goosebumps..
:'''Sun Yu:''' Alright. Then, may I help you?
:{{DIcon}} I'm looking for a certain female thief.
:'''Sun Yu:''' Oh, so you have come to perform the chivalrous act of hunting down criminals. The [[Guhua Clan]] will definitely support that! What aid may we lend you?
:{{DIcon}} The two of you went after her once.
:{{DIcon}} Do you still have any impression of her?
:'''Sun Yu:''' Now that you mention it, I do have an impression of just such an incident.
:'''Sun Yu:''' It happened about a week ago. Que'er and I were wandering these mountains and training when we were interrupted by two thieves.
:'''Sun Yu:''' We rose up and made to help the adepti keep their paradise clean of such unwanted intruders...
:'''Sun Yu:''' We pursued the two thieves deep into [[Mt. Hulao]], only to see their shadows suddenly rise and fall, rise and fall...
:{{DIcon}} Then what happened...?
:'''Sun Yu:''' Suddenly, one of the shadows disappeared. I said, "Que'er, this must be a trap! Don't fall for it!" Then we began to chase the female thief...
:'''Sun Yu:''' We climbed [[Mt. Hulao]] through rock, stone, cave, and cloud...
:'''Sun Yu:''' In short, we chased them up and down, up and down, and up and down...
:{{DIcon}} Uh huh. And then?
:'''Sun Yu:''' We heard a *puff*!
:'''Sun Yu:''' And then the female thief was gone.
:'''Sun Yu:''' Little Que'er and I searched for her for a long time, but we couldn't find any trace. We thought that she must fallen off the cliffs.
:'''Sun Yu:''' Or perhaps she was so agile that she gave us the slip. That's possible as well.
:'''Sun Yu:''' That's all I know. I cannot be sure if it'll be of use to you, but...
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for your help!
:{{DIcon}} No, it wasn't completely useless...
:'''Sun Yu:''' Ah, I am glad that we were able to help! By the way, I also saw a few [[Qingxin]] on the mountain's summit that seemed quite lovely &mdash; beyond the pale, even. I wonder if...
:{{DIcon}} Taking my leave now!

;(Speak to Sun Yu again)
:'''Sun Yu:''' Please go after those bandits. Don't let me slow you down.
:'''Sun Yu:''' Oh! I see! Then you must be here to help me&mdash;
:{{DIcon}} By your leave!

----
;(Break the [[Amber Rock]] and speak with Yan'er)
:'''Yan'er:''' *cough* *cough* *panting* Phew, thought I'd never get out!
:'''Yan'er:''' Thanks for saving my life, stranger...?
:'''Yan'er:''' Eh!? It's you!
:{{DIcon}} You're...
:'''Yan'er:''' Aren't you that... that...!
:{{DIcon}} Oh, so it's "that"...
:'''Yan'er:''' Yes! And [[The Chi of Yore|that time in Qingce]], too... that...!
:{{DIcon}} Yeah. Definitely "that."
:'''Yan'er:''' Yes! That's right! So... did you get any mileage out of those Chi remains?
:{{DIcon}} Hardly.
:{{DIcon}} Everything they said I would.
:'''Yan'er:''' Ah-hahahaha!
:'''Yan'er:''' Ah, you're something, alright. So it really was you who turned my brothers inside-out back in [[Qingce Village]].
:'''Yan'er:''' Well, regardless, you have my thanks for saving my life.
:'''Yan'er:''' Otherwise, I don't know how long I would have been trapped in this accursed amber. It was awful in there...
:'''Yan'er:''' The vaunted adepti of [[Jueyun Karst]] &mdash; a pack of petty jerks, I tell you!
:{{DIcon}} The adeptus saved your life, you know.
:{{DIcon}} Just saying, you're still in their territory.
:'''Yan'er:''' Hehe, you're right.
:'''Yan'er:''' I accidentally fell into this pit back when I was trying to avoid that crazy couple.
:'''Yan'er:''' But thanks to [[Mountain Shaper|Mountain Spitter]] wrapping me up in amber from way over in his abode, I wasn't injured.
:'''Yan'er:''' Well, he's not an avid finisher of what he starts, seeing as how he didn't let me out afterwards.
:{{DIcon}} The adeptus was probably trying to punish you, too.
:'''Yan'er:''' Makes sense, hahaha!
:'''Yan'er:''' Alright, alright. I'm done laughing now. Come on, let's get out of this place.

;(Upon riding the upwards wind current)
:'''Yan'er:''' Must be nice having a wind glider. It's just a shame that mine broke a good while ago, or I wouldn't have needed you to rescue me.

;(Arrive at the highlighted location at the top of the hole)
:'''Yan'er:''' So, I suppose that you've got something you need my help with, then!
:{{DIcon}} Oh, I was just passing through.
:{{DIcon}} Wait, how did you know?
:'''Yan'er:''' Hah! You can't fool me.
:'''Yan'er:''' You outlanders have faces that can hide no secrets.
:'''Yan'er:''' Well then, what's the matter? Did you finally remember that you might have to arrest me, O Hero of Liyue?
:{{DIcon}} Please take this.
;(Opens item submission screen)

;(Talk to Yan'er again if no bottle submitted)
:'''Yan'er:''' Well then, what's the matter? Did you finally remember that you might have to arrest me, O Hero of Liyue?
:{{DIcon}} Please take this.
;(Opens item submission screen)

;(Upon submitting [[Someone's Drifting Bottle]])
:'''Yan'er:''' Oh, is this a gift? Thanks!
:{{DIcon}} It's from Hiromi.
:'''Yan'er:''' Hiromi... who's that?
:{{DIcon}} Don't you know each other?
:{{DIcon}} He said he misses you.
:'''Yan'er:''' Sorry. I don't know any officer who catches thieves.
:'''Yan'er:''' Especially idiots. I don't know any of them.
:'''Yan'er:''' However... please thank him for returning the badge.
:'''Yan'er:''' Also, the Uyuu Restaurant seems like a fine place. I will go there for drinks when I am free.
:'''Yan'er:''' Go for a few drinks and get to know that idiot along the way.

----
;(Go back and find Hiromi)
:'''Hiromi:''' So, did you manage to get any news of "Big Sis"?
:{{DIcon}} We've spoken, aye.
:'''Hiromi:''' What did she say? Don't tell me she's already forgotten about me?
:{{DIcon}} She doesn't know a Hiromi.
:'''Hiromi:''' But...!
:{{DIcon}} Well, that's because she can't get to know any public servants.
:'''Hiromi:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Idiotic ones least of all.
:'''Hiromi:''' Uhh...
:{{DIcon}} Still, she thinks that...
:'''Hiromi:''' She thinks that?
:{{DIcon}} That she can give it a try.
:'''Hiromi:''' Uh...?
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like a date, doesn't it?
:'''Hiromi:''' Eh! Eh!? Is that how you see it?
:{{DIcon}} Is that so strange...?
:'''Hiromi:''' N&mdash;No... it's just... I wasn't expecting this response.
:{{DIcon}} I'll go if you won't.
:'''Hiromi:''' Wha&mdash;! No! There's no need for that! I can take care of this myself!
:'''Hiromi:''' But... she didn't mention when she'll "try to get to know me," did she?
:{{DIcon}} I'm afraid she couldn't spill the beans then.
:{{DIcon}} She is a Treasure Hoarder, after all...
:'''Hiromi:''' Yes, you're right... Anyway, you have my thanks, (Traveler).
:'''Hiromi:''' Perhaps I still need time to digest everything that she said. Well, I can't claim to be disappointed with this answer either way.
:'''Hiromi:''' Sorry for the trouble. Here's your payment.
:{{DIcon}} Don't forget, now: "Uyuu Restaurant."
:'''Hiromi:''' I got it. Thank you!
:'''Hiromi:''' By the way, (Traveler), I wish you all the best here in Inazuma.
