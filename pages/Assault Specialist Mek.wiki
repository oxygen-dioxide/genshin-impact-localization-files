==Descriptions==
{{Description|Alongside the [[Recon Log Mek]], this was one of the first new-type clockwork meka to be made (though of course, after hundreds of years, no one refers to them as "new-type" anymore – this was simply to differentiate them from traditional clockwork mechanisms that were powered by potential energy.)<br>It was named to commemorate a friend of its [[Alain Guillotin|inventor]], and was originally designed to help people. However, its ability to attack people – thereby avoiding the need to put friendly personnel at risk – subsequently came to be seen as its real strength.|[[Archive]]}}
