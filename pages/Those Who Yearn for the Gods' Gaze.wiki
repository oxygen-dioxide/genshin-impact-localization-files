{{Quest Description|You take up the post of leader of Swordfish II. Unexpectedly, [[Teppei]] has also received a promotion...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Go and investigate the ancient ruins)<!-- plays upon arrival or upon activating an Electro Monument from afar, whichever happens first -->
:{{A|vo dqaq102 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This should be the place. But Sangonomiya was right, it doesn't look like anything suspicious is going on...
:{{A|vo dqaq102 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Could they be hiding? (Traveler), let's see what we can find.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' These {{Color|buzz|Electro Monuments}} look a little suspicious...

;(Upon lighting up all three Electro Monuments)
:{{A|vo dqaq102 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yikes! A huge {{Color|buzz|lawachurl}}! Was it drawn out by the {{Color|Electro}} energy?

;(Upon defeating the Thunderhelm Lawachurl)
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew... glad that's over.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' As monsters go, that one was pretty tough. But what's such a huge Thunderhelm Lawachurl doing here in the first place?
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It doesn't make any sense... Also, the atmosphere here gives Paimon the creeps.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, the good thing is that it's over now. We should probably get going... Huh, Teppei? What are you doing here?
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 teppei 01.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' *cough* ...Wow, this is a surprise. Didn't know you were the ones investigating here.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 teppei 02.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' I just got back from delivering some supplies to the front line. I figured I'd stop by and clear any threats in this area on the way back. *cough*...
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you alright there buddy? You're looking slightly the worse for wear.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 teppei 03.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' I'm fine, it's nothing. I must've caught a cold a couple days ago while I was out at sea.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 teppei 04.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' On my way past, I heard that someone had just arrived on the island to investigate, so I thought I'd come and take a look.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 teppei 05.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' If there'd been some real danger, I might've had the chance to be the hero... Heh, shame it was just you guys. Guess I came here for nothing.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Teppei, don't you think there's something strange about this place?
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 teppei 06.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' Hmm... now that you mention it, there is something a little off about it.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 teppei 07.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' It could be that the [[Tatarigami]] is more palpable here, I guess. We're not that far away from [[Orobaxi]]'s remains.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Orobaxi? Who's that?
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 teppei 08.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' A god. Look, there's the corpse over there.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aah! It's a gigantic snake skeleton. It looks terrifying!
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 teppei 09.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' Orobaxi was the one who brought our ancestors from [[Enkanomiya]] up to the surface. That's the origin of the [[Watatsumi Island]] you know today.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 teppei 10.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' Our ancestors regarded it as a guardian deity, but during the Archon War, Orobaxi invaded [[Yashiori Island]].
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 teppei 11.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' The Raiden Shogun came out in person and slew Orobaxi with the [[Musou no Hitotachi]]. That same slash also formed what later became known as [[Musoujin Gorge]].
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Raiden Shogun created Musoujin Gorge in one slash? Wow, that's pretty incredible...
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 teppei 12.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' Yes. But the Archon War was brutal... *cough* and Yashiori Island was completely destroyed during that battle. They say the shogun lost something very dear to her along the way too.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 teppei 13.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' Since Orobaxi's death... *cough* there has always been some animosity between Watatsumi Island and the [[Shogunate]]. But our different beliefs have nothing to do with why the resistance was formed. We only rose up to fight against the [[Vision Hunt Decree]].
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 teppei 14.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' When Orobaxi attacked civilization, the shogun stood up and put a stop to it.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 teppei 15.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' But now that the shogun is stripping people of their ambitions with the Vision Hunt Decree, it's time for someone to stand up and stop the shogun... *cough*
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 teppei 16.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' Alright, I'm heading back. I was just dealing with some of the Shogun's elite samurai, so I think I'm gonna take a quick breather, then it's onto my next assignment.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 teppei 17.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' You should report back to Sangonomiya as soon as possible. Don't stay here longer than you need to &mdash; being around the Tatarigami too long won't do your health any good...
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 teppei 18.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' *coughing*...
:{{DIcon}} Take care of yourself.
:{{DIcon}} Watch your back.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 teppei 19.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' Hey, don't worry about me. Peak condition...
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Teppei's sure made some big progress if he's already dealing with Shogunate Samurai. Paimon can hardly believe it.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 3 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's report back to {{Color|buzz|Kokomi}}, (Traveler).
----
;(Upon returning to headquarters)
:{{A|vo dqaq102 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kokomi, we're back&mdash; Oh, look, Gorou's here too.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What happened? They look so serious...
:{{A|vo dqaq102 4 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Approximately how many people are exhibiting these symptoms?
:{{A|vo dqaq102 4 gorou 01.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' I haven't had the chance to do a full count yet...
:{{A|vo dqaq102 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kokomi, Gorou... what's going on?
:{{A|vo dqaq102 4 gorou 02.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Recently, (Traveler), some of our soldiers started showing symptoms of accelerated aging.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 4 gorou 03.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' I called them in for questioning and found out that they'd privately acquired some secret weapons from our sponsor.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 4 gorou 04.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Most of them are highly ambitious types, vehemently opposed to the Vision Hunt Decree. They've been using these new weapons secretly since getting hold of them.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 4 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' So that's why the war has been going unusually well... But risky secret weapons are not the answer. We must put a stop to it immediately.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 4 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Gorou, have you managed to acquire one of these weapons?
:{{A|vo dqaq102 4 gorou 05.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Most of the officers refused to hand them over. Still, I did manage to get one...
:{{DIcon}} Oh dear...
:{{A|vo dqaq102 4 kokomi 04.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' (Traveler), do you know something about this?
:{{DIcon}} It's a [[Fatui]] [[Delusion]].
:{{A|vo dqaq102 4 gorou 06.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' So that means our secret sponsor is the Fatui?
;(Traveler nods their head)
:{{A|vo dqaq102 4 kokomi 05.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' But why would the Fatui do this...
:{{A|vo dqaq102 4 kokomi 06.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Forget that, there's no time. Right now, we need to inform the whole army to cease using their Delusions immediately.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 4 kokomi 07.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' All soldiers who have shown symptoms are to be taken for treatment. I just hope we'll be in time to save them.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait a second... (Traveler), speaking of soldiers with symptoms...
:{{DIcon}} Teppei...
:{{A|vo dqaq102 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, s&mdash;surely he can't have...
:{{A|vo dqaq102 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh, let's go check on him!

;(Talk to Sangonomiya Kokomi or Gorou again)
:{{A|vo dialog dqaq102 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Gorou, let's go to the resistance camp ourselves. The use of Delusions has to stop right away.
:{{A|vo dialog dqaq102 gorou 01.ogg}} '''Gorou:''' Yes, Your Excellency!
----
;(Upon finding Teppei)
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Teppei!!!
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 teppei 01.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' Oh... *cough* Hey, guys. What're you doing here?
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 teppei 02.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' Just a moment, lemme get up... Oof, it's weird, I don't know where all my strength's gone...
:{{DIcon}} Teppei, you have to tell me.
:{{DIcon}} What's been going on with you?
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 teppei 03.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' Hmm?
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 teppei 04.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' Oh right, yeah, I haven't had time to give you the full details. Well, I've made a lot of great contributions to the war effort lately.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 teppei 05.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' Fighting the Shogun's Army at sea, taking on Shogunate Samurai all by myself, rescuing my comrades fr&mdash;from an ambush... things I never would have dreamed I could do when you first met me.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 teppei 06.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' *cough* If only I were stronger still. The stronger I am, the more I can do for the resistance... Wait a sec, where's my secret weapon gone?
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about this weapon.
:{{DIcon}} When did you start using it?
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 teppei 07.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' *cough* It wasn't long after you were made captain of Swordfish II. I met these mysterious people, said they were with our supporters.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 teppei 08.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' They gave it to me and said that as long as I have the will to become stronger, this secret weapon will answer my call.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 teppei 09.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' Haha... *cough* It's just like a [[Vision]], isn't it? Of course, I've never used a Vision, so I wouldn't know the difference...
:{{DIcon}} This is... a Delusion.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 teppei 10.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' Delusion? *cough* Oh god, that doesn't sound very good...
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 teppei 11.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' So... what's the difference between a Delusion and a Vision?
:{{DIcon}} A Delusion drains the user's life force.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 teppei 12.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' *cough*
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 teppei 13.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' Gosh... Well, I suppose it's not too surprising that a mysterious weapon of unknown origins would come with its risks.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 teppei 14.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' I've been getting more and more tired over the past few days, and I have this... strange sense of dread.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 teppei 15.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' At first I'd find I was a little more beat than usual after a battle. Didn't think anything of it. But today, I got back and suddenly my vision was going blurry.
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 teppei 16.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' This is a real shame... There I was, thinking I was catching up with ya, haha...
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 teppei 17.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' Guess I didn't receive the favor of the gods, after all...
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 teppei 18.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' Hey (Traveler), would you do something for me?
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 teppei 19.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' When our uniforms are ready, grab mine for me... bring it back here, and we can change together...
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 teppei 20.ogg}} '''Teppei:''' What's that look for? Don't worry, partner. Soon as I've rested up, I'll be right as rain. Right as rain, I tell ya... soon as I've... rested up...
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Teppei...
:{{DIcon}} The Fatui...
:{{A|vo dqaq102 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey (Traveler), where are you going? Heyyyy...

;(Interact with Teppei after the quest ends)
:{{A|vo dialog dqaq102 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Teppei's breathing is getting weaker and weaker...
