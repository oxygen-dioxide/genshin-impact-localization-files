==Trivia==
* In the event screen with all of the different destinations, Kichiboushi often wishes to play with the player.
** Upon opening the screen or after 10 seconds of sitting in the camp part of the screen, Kichiboushi will begin dancing.
** Kichiboushi finishes dancing after 5 seconds or after the player clicks on him, whichever happens first. Afterward, he will appear at a random location along the edge of the screen.
** Kichiboushi stays in one spot along the edge of the screen for 5 seconds before moving to a new spot. If the player clicks on him, he will sit at the camp part of the screen.
