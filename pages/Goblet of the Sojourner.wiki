{{Description|A plain porcelain goblet that was once brimming with joyous brews.}}
'''Goblet of the Sojourner''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Resolution of Sojourner]].

==Description==
A lyre has 4 strings.<br />The days he spent with his comrades in the "troupe" were probably the happiest in his life of wandering.<br />At first, it was just a chance meeting with the conductor — but for the invisible strings of fate.<br />First came the girl who used a flute as a sword, and then that fellow Kreuzlied — one by one, the traveler met them all.

In the joyous tavern, the lyrist introduced a maiden he had met by chance to his comrades amidst the singing and dancing.<br />The drunken traveler strummed the strings and sang in a loud voice.

With them by his side, he would never have to travel alone again...<br />Perhaps it would be alright to walk with them till journey's end.
