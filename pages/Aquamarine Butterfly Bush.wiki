|description    = A shrub that thrives in the wilds of [[Fontaine]]. Its aquamarine blooms resemble fluttering butterflies when viewed from the side.<br>Defining colors and studying the properties of light is the responsibility of a research group at the [[Fontaine Research Institute]]. Its researchers often engaged in prolonged debates with painters and photographers about the definitions of aquamarine and oceanic blue. The debate caused delays in other projects, eventually resulting in a compromise in which the definition of colors within the blue spectrum were significantly broadened. It serves as a reminder to newcomers that getting too caught up in trivial semantic debates is a waste of time.
