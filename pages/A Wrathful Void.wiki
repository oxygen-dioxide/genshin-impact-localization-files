==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
The Wanderer wears a wide conical blue kasa hat, with golden details with the top part resembling a lotus, with a pair of light cyan strips of fabric that dangles from the back of his hat, attached with a pair of diamond-shaped trinkets. Accessories resembling the finials of a ''shakujo'' staff hang from these strips of light cyan fabric. He sports a tight black turtleneck bodysuit, and having a pair of black extra long fingerless arm gloves, and a golden ornament attached to the center just beneath the collar, over which he wears a white kimono with large furisode-like sleeves in cyan coloration and an inner cyan tunic. He sports a pair of black metallic arm protections on each arm, having a bandage-like appearance.

Around his waist, the Wanderer wears black hakama-like pleated shorts, with a thick black and indigo obi belt holding it, decorated at the front with a large black bow with indigo tassels that dangle off it, their color paling at the ends. The Wanderer sports a pair of white gaiters, with a black toeless sock knee-high under it, using black geta sandals on his feet, with both legs secured around the top with indigo rope held together with a gold ornament with a singular tassel pinned to it. He wears a patterned blue half-cape with various tones that hangs off his left shoulder, where a large gold ornament containing his {{Anemo}} [[Vision]] is pinned along with a singular gold feather, which resembles the [[Plume of Luxury]].

<!-- this section is transcluded in multiple places unrelated to his outfit, so please take care with the wording --><section begin="Skill Effects" />While wearing {{If Self|A Wrathful Void||his default outfit,}} {{No Selflink|A Wrathful Void}}, when the Wanderer is in the Windfavored state from {{No Selflink|Hanega: Song of the Wind|his Elemental Skill}}, certain patterns on his turtleneck bodysuit, shorts, and gloves, on the neck, shoulders, chest, hips, upper arms, hands, and even his eyes in [[Kyougen: Five Ceremonial Plays|his Elemental Burst]] glow in the [[Anemo]]-aqua color. A symbol similar to the [[Raiden Shogun]]'s appears on the back of his neck on his shirt. If superimposed on each other, their symbols fit together to make a full ''mitsudomoe.''<section end="Skill Effects" />
