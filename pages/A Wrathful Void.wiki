'''A Wrathful Void''' is [[Wanderer]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
The Wanderer wears a large circular dark blue hat with golden details with the top part resembling a lotus, with a pair of light blue fabric that dangles from the back of his hat, attached with a pair of diamond-shaped trinkets. Accessories resembling the finials of a ''shakujo'' staff hang from these strips of light blue fabric. He sports a tight black high-collared undershirt with long detached sleeves and a golden ornament attached to the center just beneath the collar, over which he wears a loose white tunic with blue tones. He sports a pair of fingerless metallic gloves on each arm consisting of black straps wrapped around his wrists giving it a bandage-like appearance.

Around his waist, the Wanderer sports a thick black belt with indigo lining, decorated at the front with a large black bow with indigo tassels that dangle off it, their color paling at the ends. He wears this over a pair of dark shorts with pleats, paired with knee-high white sandals with both legs secured around the top with indigo rope held together with a gold ornament with a singular tassel pinned to it. He wears a patterned blue half-cape with various tones that hangs off his left shoulder, where a large gold ornament containing his Anemo [[Vision]] is pinned along with a singular gold feather, which resembles the [[Plume of Luxury]].

<!-- this section is transcluded in multiple places unrelated to his outfit, so please take care with the wording --><section begin="Skill Effects" />While wearing {{#ifeq:{{PAGENAME}}|A Wrathful Void||his default outfit, }} [[A Wrathful Void]], when the Wanderer is in the Windfavored state from his Elemental Skill, certain patterns on his turtleneck undershirt, shorts, and gloves glow a light blue. These patterns are on the neck, shoulders, chest, hips, upper arms, and hands. Most notably, a symbol similar to the [[Raiden Shogun]]'s appears on the back of his neck on his shirt. If superimposed on each other, their symbols fit together to make a full ''mitsudomoe.''<section end="Skill Effects" />
