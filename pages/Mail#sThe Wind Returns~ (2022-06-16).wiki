|text    = The breeze combing through your hair today feels a little different, don't you think?

It smells faintly of flowers and also carries a refreshing scent of spring water...

If you are sensitive to smells, I wouldn't be surprised if you can pick a hint of sweetness in today's wind. That's because I just ate an [[apple]], haha!

Come on now, let's go for a walk outside!

We can pick berries for a picnic and rest at a roadside tavern. With me, the best bard there is by your side, the journey will be great wherever we go.

Oops, I almost forgot. Here, this [[Cecilia]] bouquet is for you. Heh, we both smell like flowers now.
