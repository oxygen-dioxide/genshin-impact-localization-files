{{Description|Ganyu can bring down sweet rains as a matter of course. But against demons and heretics, they become bitter, freezing snow.}}
'''Celestial Shower''' is [[Ganyu]]'s [[Elemental Burst]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* This ability will drop up to 50 icicles over its duration, with each icicle targeting a random enemy that has not been targeted by the last 4 icicles. If there are ''n'' enemies [[Vacuum Field|grouped]] closely together, and each icicle hits ''n'' enemies, then over the duration there will be at most 50''n'' instances of damage per enemy, so the scaling for this ability is linear per enemy (bounded above by a linear function) and quadratic overall. This is, however, not the case while ''n'' is under 5 as the total number of targeted icicles does not equal to 50. Assuming none of the random icicles hit, this ability instead scales quadratically with the function of 10''n''^2.
