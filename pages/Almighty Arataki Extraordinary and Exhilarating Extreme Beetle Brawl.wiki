===Tutorial===
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exhilarating Extreme Beetle Brawl 1.png
|text1  = Tap the forward button to instruct the Onikabuto to expend a small amount of Stamina to move {{Color|help|half a tile}} forward and get closer to its opponent.<br>This move will not deal DMG.
|image2 = Tutorial Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exhilarating Extreme Beetle Brawl 2.png
|text2  = Hold the forward button to instruct the Onikabuto to charge its energy. When the charging process ends, the Onikabuto will expend a greater amount of Stamina to rush forward. When this rush hits an opponent, it can deal DMG. The Stamina consumed, the distance traveled, and the DMG dealt will all change based on the amount of time spent charging. A {{Color|help|fully-charged}} rush will take the Onikabuto {{Color|help|2 tiles}} forward.
|image3 = Tutorial Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exhilarating Extreme Beetle Brawl 3.png
|text3  = If the Onikabuto {{Color|help|reaches its opponent's exact position}} upon finishing its rush and hits it, it can perform a {{Color|help|piercing strike}} to deal greater DMG. You cannot trigger this special attack by tapping to advance, and over-charging will not allow you to trigger it either.
|image4 = Tutorial Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exhilarating Extreme Beetle Brawl 4.png
|text4  = The time spent charging decides your rush distance, and you can use the charging progress to judge how far your Onikabuto will advance forward.
|image5 = Tutorial Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exhilarating Extreme Beetle Brawl 5.png
|text5  = Tap the back button to expend a certain amount of Stamina and instruct the Onikabuto to move {{Color|help|1 tile}} backward and dodge your opponent's attacks.<br>If the distance or timing of the dodge is incorrect, your Onikabuto may still take DMG.
|image6 = Tutorial Almighty Arataki Extraordinary and Exhilarating Extreme Beetle Brawl 6.png
|text6  = If both Onikabuto unleash their attacks at the same time, your Onikabuto will be knocked down without dealing DMG to the opponent. Take note of the attack timings, and should your plans change, {{Color|help|cancel charging}} to avoid unnecessary {{Color|help|Stamina expenditure}}.

==Challenges==
{{Description|The beetle-fighting grounds built by the Arataki Gang with the help of you and Paimon. The arena was constructed in an "extremely cost-effective way" &mdash; so claimed Arataki Itto &mdash; with a firm foundation and moderately eye-pleasing wooden frames, all of which were attained with an acceptable budget. Around the arena are posters carefully made by Itto himself &mdash; they should be able to outshine Grandmaster Hanakado and his minions, no?|Beetle Brawl description}}
