|text      = Ahem! Oh, esteemed Traveler, why not set aside your oh-so-important adventures for a moment and join me, the one and only Lord Sangemah Bay, in celebrating this glorious, doubly special day?

Not only is it my birthday, but today also marks the grand completion of my Sumpter Beast Park's expansion! The park is now three times its original size, which means three times as many Sumpter Beasts, three times as many shops, and... well, three, four, five, six&mdash; who knows how many more times the Mora earned, hehehe!

As a gracious host, I've prepared a feast of delicacies, along with special guest appearances and surprise performances. And here's the best part: to show my sincerity, entry is completely free today! Just for this one special day! How can you resist such a deal, hmm? Come on, don't keep me waiting~
