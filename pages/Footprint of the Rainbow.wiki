==Description==
===Page #1===
Long, long ago, in what now is seen as an age of myth, when great [[Dragon|dragons]] still swum the [[Toyac Springs|flowing springs]],<br>
There was a fairy who, having drifted to this place carrying a mission from [[Fontaine|a distant land]], met with a valiant youth under the watery moonlight.<br>
The young man was [[Uenuku]] of the [[People of the Springs|Meztli]], known to posterity as the Treader of the Rainbow.<br>
Just as the spring waters have never taken a fixed form, so too are there many different version of the legend of the Rainbow King, each with their own origins.<br>
Yet invariably, they all mention his encounter with the water sprite.

"I am a tear born of the primordial chalice, the daughter of clear springs, sweet dew, gentle winds, and light mist."<br>
"O hero, he who has embarked on a journey to protect the weak, the justice you pursue is the ideal I yearn for."<br>
"Please allow me to bless your spear with my song, and allow me to accompany you on this lonely journey."<br>
"I ask only that when you become King, as my reward, you grant me the spring where vicious beasts prowl."

For the [[Egeria|Mistress of Many Waters']] noble and compassionate vision, for the all-embracing love spread through the land along the flowing waters,<br>
For these things, the searing waters must be turned into clear springs; the flowing [[phlogiston]] purged utterly from the water veins.<br>
So, in the name of justice, was the warrior guided onto his journey, to challenge the order that belonged solely to the dragons—

Though he discerned the fairy's true intentions, realized that the [[Oceanid]] messenger merely saw him as a means to fulfill an end,<br>
Since they shared a common enemy, he would fight by the side of this girl who sought to deceive him, until the time came that they were to betray one another.

And that was enough, he thought to himself. Even if all her words were simply designed to entice, and though it would eventually all dissipate into mist and rain,<br>
At least the justice that he so firmly believed in, the justice that had the power to "unite" the weak; at least that would not fade at the journey's end.

It was only after dozens of winters had passed, and he had spent his life in vain trying to fulfill that promise, that the "King" realized—<br>
At the end of that glorious journey, it was the unwavering faith he had held from the very beginning that he ultimately regretted the most.

===Page #2===
''Unlocked after completing [[The Mysterious Island's Truth]]''

Just as the spring waters have never taken a fixed form, so too do the hearts of humans and fairies sway with the night breeze.<br>
Only when the young man was on the verge of being consumed by the [[Xiuhcoatl|dragonlord]]'s flames did she realize that her objective had long since become muddled.<br>
All she had to do was abandon the one with blind faith in justice here; after all, she had already advised him to abandon his village.<br>
Then, she had simply to find another who could become King; after all, his ideals had never concerned her anyway.

But if that was the case, then why did she now face the dragon's fire for his folly, beheld by his astonished eyes?<br>
Perhaps this was the "communication and understanding" that the Mistress of Many Waters sought after, thought the water sprite to herself,<br>
As she gave him one last smile, covering the sunlike blaze, leaving only rainbow hues in the rising vapor.

...

The ancient scrolls of the Meztli tell a completely different story, however—<br>
Under the gentle moonlight, the hero Uenuku met the wandering water sprite and fell in love.<br>
Yet, in a moment of suspicion, he was separated from his beloved, whose name was Hineila (or Ianeira).<br>
"They say that the human heart is as capricious as the tides. Yet how easy it is to conquer the tides; how difficult the human heart."<br>
Filled with regret, the hero Uenuku wandered every inch of the scorched lands, searching only for his beloved.<br>
After decades of relentless pursuit, the water sprite's hardened heart softened, finally showing a trace of compassion.<br>
She plucked a soft cloud from the sky and turned it into a rainbow, guiding the hero towards the sea's other side.<br>
Blessed by the [[Sacred Flame]], Uenuku and his lover were finally reunited, never to be separated again.<br>
The tribal elders believe that the shells we see today are fragments of the rainbow that fell into the sea back then,<br>
And that the reason they are always formed with two connected sides is because they symbolize our wish for reunion.
