|desc       = Apparently, a group of Wingless over at {{Color|buzz|Western side of the [[Flower-Feather Clan]]'s territory}} have been stirring up trouble... Well actually, perhaps that might be a slight exaggeration. Most of the time, they just stand around grumbling, wailing, and generally causing a ruckus with their Saurian companions. But recently, rumor has it that they've been sneaking around buying weapons, so it seems like a timely {{sic|invention}} might be in order. It would be very much appreciated if someone could go check up on them and "snuff out" their "fiery zeal" before things start getting out of hand.

Though it is said that [[Capitano|their leader]] in Natlan is an honorable, upstanding man, {{sic|yet}} we cannot simply allow them to roam freely across our lands...<br>Unchecked, unchallenged, trampling at will! Our scouts have already identified several of their positions over at {{Color|buzz|Around Huitztli Hill}}, so all that's left is to invite anyone with the requisite brawn to drive these northern invaders back to where they came from!

|desc       = The other day, I was hurrying through the night when I passed by {{Color|buzz|Western side of the [[Scorchwind Trial Grounds]]}}, and I suddenly heard a whooshing sound behind me. You'll never guess what... A giant stone, covered in strange engravings, flew up into the air and started spewing fire all over the place! For a moment, I thought it was a [[Wayob Manifestation]], but when I took a closer look, it turned out to be a mechanism gone rogue. Honestly, it could barely have chosen a more dangerous place to malfunction... People walk through that area all the time, so it'd be best if someone dealt with it pronto.
