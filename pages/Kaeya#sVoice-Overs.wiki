|vo_08_09_tx         = Hmm? You think Fischl having one eye covered is very fitting given her title of Prinzessin der Verurteilung. Hahaha, if that's the case, that must also make me a descendant of some kind of former royal lineage, no?

|vo_08_11_tx         = Ahaha, you want to know about the secrets of Sister Rosaria? That... I cannot tell you. Though my impression of her is not bad &mdash; certainly better than a certain someone whose name I won't bother to mention. She's honest with herself.

|vo_08_12_tx         = Sucrose may not be much of an extrovert in public, but as they say &mdash; it's always the quiet ones... Apparently, her laboratory is home to quite the eclectic range of implements and her experiments are more than just intellectually stimulating... All hearsay, of course.

|vo_08_14_tx         = When I first met Mika, he seemed like the nervous type, so I decided to joke around with him a little. I didn't count on that making him even more nervous... His smile looked as if it were plastered onto his face, and in the end, he even wrote me a letter of apology. Tsk-tsk. Does taking everything so seriously run in the Schmidts' blood?

|vo_09_03_friendship = 4
|vo_09_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} More About {character} - 03.ogg
|vo_09_03_tx         = My eye? My eye is fine. There's nothing unusual about hiding one's body parts from view. It's the same reason I wear pants... or any other item of clothing, for that matter.
|vo_09_04_title      = More About {name}: IV
|vo_09_04_friendship = 5
|vo_09_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} More About {character} - 04.ogg
|vo_09_04_tx         = [[Khaenri'ah]], huh? You sure know a lot! The legacy of Khaenri'ah is long gone. The sinners are all that's left, and they're not worth mentioning.

==Trivia==
*Kaeya's remarks about grape juice, his least favorite food, are a jab at [[Diluc]] &mdash; who hates the taste of wine and prefers grape juice.
*In Kaeya's "Favorite Food" voice-over, he talks about the drink "Death After Noon." However, the actual voiced line has him say "{{w|Death in the Afternoon (cocktail)|Death in the Afternoon}}," which is the name of a real-life cocktail made with {{w|absinthe}} and {{w|Champagne}}.
