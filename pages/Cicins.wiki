'''Cicins''' are small bat-like creatures that do not deal much damage or have much health, but they are hard to lock down and defeat. When attacking together with other enemies, they can become a real nuisance. They are attracted to mist pollen.

==Strategy==
In the wild, Cicins are usually not much of a threat but attack in small groups, ranging from 3–5 at a time. Cicins are very nimble and can be very hard to hit with most characters, so [[Bows]] and [[Catalysts]] are typically the best bet for hitting them. They fire single energy shots at the player, and they pause for about a second to charge up and launch the attack to do so. The attack deals elemental damage of the Cicin's affinity.

Cicins can also be summoned by [[Fatui Cicin Mages]] in groups of three at a time, and they act identically to those in the wild.

==Trivia==
* The English name "Cicin" derives from Latin ''{{Lang|mini=1|la=cicindela}}'' which means "firefly" or "glowworm."
** In real life, the genus ''{{w|Cicindela}}'' refers to the common tiger beetles, which are generally brightly colored, metallic beetles.
