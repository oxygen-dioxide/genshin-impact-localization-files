|text      = Ugh... Boss and the others have really taken things a step too far recently, trying to turn everything into a big event. A few days ago, I caught wind that they've been secretly setting up a stage for my birthday...

Thankfully, to make it a surprise, they've tried to keep the whole thing a secret from me. And based on how the [[Arataki Gang]]'s last few events have gone down... Well, let's just say that without me or you helping them out, the most likely outcome is that it'll all come to nothing...

All in all, what it means is this — for once, I won't have to spend my birthday desperately trying to clean up their mess, and that this year, I'll finally get a chance to let my I hair down.

So instead, how about this? We find a spot, somewhere out there in the wild, where we can just sit and take in the scenery, with the wind in our faces... and I can enjoy my birthday in peace and quiet.

I'll head over to scout out the area and check for any monster threats first. If it's not too much trouble, I look forward to seeing you there.
