===Juicy, Just Juicy===
{{Description|Now that the Eight Treasure bird is ready, it's time to plate up! The juice created from the steaming process is of the utmost importance, and so it must be boiled, then thickened, to produce a gravy that blends freshness and flavor. Then, pour it out over the dish, and voila, this Eight-Treasure Duck is ready to go!<br>If you share Guoba and Yuegui's palate, you might even add a suitable amount of fresh ingredients into the steeping soup to modify its taste to suit different customers!12}}
