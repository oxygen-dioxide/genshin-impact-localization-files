{{Quest Description|The researcher from [[Sumeru]], [[Alrani]], seems to have come up with a new idea for her thesis...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talking to Alrani)
:'''Alrani:''' Hey! Traveler, why are you here?
:{{DIcon}} Are you... Alrani?
:{{DIcon}} Have you finished your paper?
::'''Alrani:''' Ugh, don't even mention my paper...
:'''Alrani:''' After you helped me gather some materials previously, I was preparing to write a thesis on [[Vision]]s and elemental powers.
:'''Alrani:''' The outline was drawn up, the materials were found, and you were a special example of someone who does not have a Vision but could still use the power of the elements.
:'''Alrani:''' So I wrote up the first draft and sent it to the [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]] for my tutor to review, but...
:'''Alrani:''' "The topic is shallow, the logic is unclear, the content is rambling and incomprehensible."
:'''Alrani:''' My paper was summarily rejected. Again.
:{{DIcon}} So it's a rewrite for you, then?
:'''Alrani:''' Yeah. Hahaha... Well, I've rewritten it twice already. What's another time?
:'''Alrani:''' The first time, I wanted to go to [[Mondstadt]] to collect data and write a paper about life in Mondstadt and The [[Four Winds]].
:'''Alrani:''' But as soon as I passed the [[Stone Gate]] I heard that The Dragon of the East, [[Dvalin]], who should be one of The Four Winds of Mondstadt, had suddenly started attacking the city of Mondstadt.
:'''Alrani:''' I specifically went to Mondstadt to consult with [[Sayid|Mr. Sayid]], but he didn't know the reason either, and couldn't help me with my paper.
:'''Alrani:''' Since I didn't have a core argument or any evidence, I had to change the topic.
:{{DIcon}} So you went to [[Liyue]]?
:'''Alrani:''' Yes! I thought that since the [[Geo Archon]] in Liyue is so diligent, and personally guards [[Liyue Harbor]], and also helps to guide its overall development...
:'''Alrani:''' If I wrote a paper on the relationship between the Geo Archon and Liyue Harbor, there should be enough material.
:'''Alrani:''' And then&mdash; and then, Morax suddenly... Ohh...
:{{DIcon}} No one wanted that kind of accident to happen.
:{{DIcon}} Well, at least that didn't happen while you were writing your paper.
::'''Alrani:''' Hahaha... Yeah, I think I might have lost it if that had happened...
:'''Alrani:''' After failing twice, I had no other choice. If I couldn't put a good paper together, I wouldn't be able to show my face back at the Akademiya again.
:'''Alrani:''' So I wanted to go out into Liyue's countryside to investigate and find a paper topic. But you already know what happened next...
:'''Alrani:''' To tell you the truth, even [[And This Treasure Goes To...|when I was captured]] by the Treasure Hoarders and pressed for the whereabouts of the treasure, I still felt less stressed than when I was writing my paper.
:'''Alrani:''' After all, I had a clear idea of what those guys wanted from me, whereas I have no idea what my tutor wants from my paper even {{Not a typo|now ...}}<!-- yes, there's a space before the ellipsis as of writing this comment -->
:{{DIcon}} Is writing a paper that scary?
::'''Alrani:''' The writing's not the scary part, it's my tutor. My tutor is actually a very patient and knowledgeable person.
:{{DIcon}} Is your tutor that terrible?
::'''Alrani:''' Absolutely terrifying! Now, I'll have you know that my tutor is actually a very patient and knowledgeable person.
:'''Alrani:''' But when it comes to "Essay-Writing Guidance", no matter what the tutor was like before, they all suddenly become super scary.
:'''Alrani:''' So I still haven't been able to hand in my paper, and the deadline is getting closer and closer. My tutor must be losing patience.
:'''Alrani:''' If I dare to go back to the Akademiya empty-handed, I've no doubt that he will banish me to sweep the library forever...
:'''Alrani:''' As such I came to Inazuma to find less popular topics, such as the Inazuman people's living conditions under the [[Vision Hunt Decree]]...
;(Before [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]])
::{{DIcon}} Don't get caught again...
::'''Alrani:''' I won't. I mean, I don't have a Vision. In Inazuma, this might actually be considered an advantage.
::'''Alrani:''' I've worked out how to conduct the investigation, starting with {{Color|buzzword|recording the daily {{Not a typo|life}} of the people on this island}}.
::'''Alrani:''' If you're interested, Traveler, you could come and help me with the recording.
::{{DIcon}} Sure.
::{{DIcon}} Do you want me to help you again?
:::'''Alrani:''' No. It's just that... I came to Inazuma alone, and I don't know anyone except for you.
:::'''Alrani:''' It would be comforting to work with the people I know.
;(After Omnipresence Over Mortals)
::{{DIcon}} Well, just don't get caught again...
::'''Alrani:''' I won't. I mean, I don't have a Vision... Which might've actually been considered an advantage, if the Vision Hunt Decree were still in force.
::'''Alrani:''' I've worked out how to conduct the investigation, starting with recording the daily life of the Inazumans on this island.
::'''Alrani:''' If you're interested, Traveler, you could come and do some recordings together with me.
::{{DIcon}} Sure.
::{{DIcon}} Need my help with something again?
:::'''Alrani:''' No. It's just that... I came to Inazuma alone, and I don't know anyone except for you.
:::'''Alrani:''' It would be comforting to work with people I know.
:'''Alrani:''' Let's go. There are still a great many shops on this island for us to explore.
:'''Alrani:''' Let's start with this one called Eipekkusu.

;(Following Alrani)
:'''Alrani:''' Traveler, I think pictures might be a good way to record the Inazuman lifestyle. That way, we can review them at a later date.
:'''Alrani:''' Let's take a picture of Eipekkusu with the {{Not a typo|kamera}} first.

----
;(After taking a photo of [[Eipekkusu]] and its [[Kaede|owner]])
;(Kaede comes out of her shop and walks up to the Traveler and Alrani)
:'''Alrani:''' So that's what Inazuman specialties are like... Hmm...
:'''Kaede:''' Hey, what are you doing?
:'''Alrani:''' Hello! I'm Alrani, a scholar from Sumeru. I'm doing research on Inazuma for an academic paper.
:'''Kaede:''' Investigating us at a time like this? So suspicious...
:'''Kaede:''' I don't care what your purpose is. You're disturbing me, so just leave.
;(Kaede returns to the shop and Alrani starts walking to the next location)
:'''Alrani:''' The owner of this shop doesn't seem very friendly. Perhaps it might be better to go to a shop opened by an outlander? Let's look for one.
----
;(After taking a photo of [[Syavushi Bakshesh Shoppe]] and its [[Vahid|owner]])
;(Vahid comes out of his shop and walks up to the Traveler and Alrani)
:'''Vahid:''' Hey, what are you doing?
:'''Alrani:''' Hello! I'm from...
:'''Vahid:''' A researcher from the Akademiya, right? I didn't expect to see someone like you here...
:'''Alrani:''' How did you...
:'''Vahid:''' I just had to take one look at you to know you're a researcher. There's plenty of them back in Sumeru after all.
:'''Vahid:''' Did you come all the way here from Sumeru to Inazuma for this... so-called "sociological study"?
:'''Alrani:''' Yes. I'm just making some preparations. Are you also from the Akademiya...?
:'''Vahid:''' No, I haven't the talent to be an academic. I'm just an ordinary businessman.
:'''Vahid:''' Since you're writing a paper, you can record whatever you like here if you want, but first, let me give you some advice.
:'''Vahid:''' The [[Outlander Affairs Agency]] is wary of outlanders like us, so remember to be a bit more restrained while you're doing your research.
:'''Vahid:''' If you get into any trouble, it would be hard for an outlander like you, who's only just come to Inazuma, to extricate themselves.
:'''Alrani:''' I... I understand, thank you!
:'''Vahid:''' Well, off you go then. Start writing stuff down.
;(Vahid returns to the shop and Alrani runs off to the wharf)
:'''Alrani:''' Are businesspeople in Inazuma all so unwelcoming to strangers? Hmm... let's try someone else.
:'''Alrani:''' There's the wharf up ahead. Maybe we can {{sic|find try}} talking to a fisherman. Fishermen should be more relaxed.

;(After taking a photo of [[Obata|the fisherman]])
:'''Obata:''' Hello! You two, what are you doing?
:'''Alrani:''' Hello! I'm Alrani, a scholar from Sumeru. I'm doing some academic research here.
:'''Obata:''' Research? I'm a fisherman. What's there to research?
:'''Obata:''' And do you have permission from the Outlander Affairs Agency to do... suspicious things like that?
:'''Obata:''' I heard from [[Ebina Gonshirou|Gonshirou]] that this kind of behavior should be reported to the Agency first, right?
:{{DIcon}} Never heard of it...
:{{DIcon}} Why do you need a permit for such mundane things?
:'''Alrani:''' Eh? Why? Is there such a thing? I've never heard that one before!
:'''Obata:''' You're getting more and more suspicious by the minute... You'd better come and see [[Kageyama|Miss Kageyama]] with me.
:'''Obata:''' She is an inspector with the Agency. She'd know how to handle your affairs.
:'''Alrani:''' Wait, hold on. I'm really just an academic researcher... I'll go report to the agency later...
;(Vahid arrives and interrupts the conversation)
:'''Vahid:''' Mr. Obata, what's going on here? I could hear the row from all the way over there.
:'''Obata:''' Oh, it's Mr. Vahid. Well, these two have been loitering around, claiming to be doing some kind of academic research.
:'''Obata:''' But when I asked, they don't seem to have permission from the Outlander Affairs Agency. I was going to take them to see Miss Kageyama.
:'''Vahid:''' Alrani, what are you running around for? Shouldn't you be helping at the store?
:{{DIcon}} (What's going on?)
:{{DIcon}} See, told you not to run around.
::'''Alrani:''' Hey... Huh?
:'''Vahid:''' You've been writing that paper for so long already. What's the point of rushing it now? Can't you see you're disturbing Mr. Obata?
:'''Obata:''' Why? Mr. Vahid, this is...
:'''Vahid:''' She's a scholar whom I invited from the Akademiya to work as a consultant for my shop.
:'''Vahid:''' Because she is writing a paper about Inazuma, she's looking for inspiration around these parts.
:'''Vahid:''' She just came over from the Akademiya, so she doesn't understand the rules around here.
:'''Vahid:''' I'm still going through the procedures with the Outlander Affairs Agency, but she can't help running around sometimes... I'm sorry for disturbing you, Mr. Obata.
:'''Alrani:''' Huh... Oh! I'm so sorry that I disturbed you, Mr. Obata...
:'''Obata:''' Oh, it's fine. It was a misunderstanding on my part to begin with. I guess you really are a scholar.
:'''Vahid:''' Alright, Alrani, come over here. We need to have a talk.
:'''Vahid:''' Mr. Obata, please excuse me.
----
;(Vahid and Alrani go up to his shop)
;(Talk to Vahid or Alrani)
:'''Vahid:''' *sigh* Didn't I just tell you? Don't do anything suspicious.
:'''Vahid:''' The current situation in Inazuma is such that, if the Outlander Affairs Agency got involved, there would be no way to resolve things peacefully. Fortunately, I was paying attention to what you were doing.
:{{DIcon}} Are things that serious?
::'''Vahid:''' Yes, they are that serious. See the checkpoint in [[Ritou]]? If you want to enter Inazuma, you need to get a permit.
:{{DIcon}} Is the situation so tense?
::'''Vahid:''' I can't be too sure from where I'm at. But judging by how tense the [[Kanjou Commission]]ers are, the situation can't be good.
::'''Vahid:''' See the checkpoint in Ritou? If you want to enter Inazuma, you need to get a permit.
:'''Alrani:''' Oh no, does this mean I can't go to the other islands to collect data?
:'''Vahid:''' Don't worry. I've asked around at the Outlander Affairs Agency before. As it turns out, it might be easier to get a permit if you apply under me, since I'm a businessman here in Inazuma.
:'''Alrani:''' Th&mdash;Thank you... but why do you want to help me?
:{{DIcon}} You're a kind soul.
::'''Vahid:''' Well, I'm not going to turn down the praise...
:{{DIcon}} Is this what they call "fellowship between countrymen"?
::'''Vahid:''' Sympathy... well, a little. It's not often that I can meet someone from Sumeru in Inazuma.
:'''Vahid:''' But really, I too wish to ask a favor of you.
:'''Alrani:''' Oh? But I'm not a good salesperson...
:'''Vahid:''' It's not about that. Well, this is somewhat embarassing, but...
:'''Vahid:''' Although I'm in the fertilizer business, I don't know much about these fertilizers.
:'''Vahid:''' When people ask me about the special characteristics of these fertilizers, I can only refer to the instructions that came with the packaging. I don't know enough to say anything more persuasive.
:'''Vahid:''' If you're willing, I'd like you to help me think about... how to market them.
:'''Vahid:''' At least, help me introduce them in a more persuasive manner, such that I'll be able to attract more customers.
:'''Vahid:''' In return, I promise that I'll get a permit for you from the Outlander Affairs Agency so that you can enter other places in Inazuma
:'''Vahid:''' What do you think? Do you agree?
:{{DIcon}} Huh. So Sumeru does have people who aren't researchers of some kind...
::'''Vahid:''' Of course. Not everyone can, or is willing to go to Akademiya to study and become a researcher.
:{{DIcon}} Seems reasonable.
:'''Alrani:''' Marketing... I did learn something similar to that at the Akademiya.
:{{DIcon}} You've learned that, too?
:'''Alrani:''' I've just read some relevant books. It's all theory &mdash; I've never put them into practice.
:'''Alrani:''' After all, the Akademiya was no place to practice marketing in any way.
:'''Alrani:''' But if I study the applications of these fertilizers, perhaps I can come up with some selling points that can be used in marketing.
:'''Vahid:''' That would be great!
:'''Vahid:''' Ah... Let's not just stand here and talk. You're probably hungry after all of that.
:'''Vahid:''' Let me make you something to eat.
:'''Vahid:''' Traveler, can you please help me find some food? I'll need {{Color|buzzword|a portion of [[Fish]]}}, {{Color|buzzword|a portion of [[Seagrass]]}} and {{Color|buzzword|a portion of [[Rice]]}}.
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
:{{DIcon}} What are you going to make?
:'''Vahid:''' Hahaha, it's nothing fancy, just an old recipe...

;(Talk to Alrani again)
:'''Alrani:''' What can you make with {{Color|buzzword|a portion of [[Fish]]}}, {{Color|buzzword|a portion of [[Seagrass]]}} and {{Color|buzzword|a portion of [[Rice]]}}, anyway?

;(Talk to Vahid again)
:'''Vahid:''' Have you found the ingredients?
;(Item submission menu opens)
:'''Vahid:''' Don't worry, it's more than sufficient. Just a moment. It'll be ready soon.
;(Vahid prepares the food)
:'''Alrani:''' Wow... It looks delicious. You're a great cook.
:'''Vahid:''' Haha, if you live alone for a long time, you will naturally learn this kind of thing. Go on, dig in.
:'''Vahid:''' I'm also doing this for the business. In the beginning, I was thinking about many different ways to market our fertilizer.
:'''Vahid:''' One thing I thought of was to use the vegetables grown with my fertilizer as ingredients to make delicious food, which would help prove their efficacy.
:'''Vahid:''' But later, I realized that the idea of cooking in a fertilizer shop was a little... inappropriate, so I gave up.
:{{DIcon}} It is a bit out of place...
:'''Vahid:''' Of course, now that I have Miss Alrani's help, I won't have to come up with these terrible ideas by myself.
:'''Alrani:''' I'll do my best! But about the issue with the travel permit...
:'''Vahid:''' Leave it to me. If there are no problems, it should be done in just a few days.
:'''Vahid:''' Still, a researcher coming to Inazuma is a rare sight. What sort of paper are you writing?
:'''Alrani:''' Ah, I, um, don't know. I don't know yet...
:'''Alrani:''' I hope to finish the paper while I'm in Inazuma. If I can't get it done, I'll have to go back to the Akademiya to face the music.
