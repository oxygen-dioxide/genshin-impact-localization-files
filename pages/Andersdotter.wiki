'''Anya M. Andersdotter''',<ref name="Until the End of the World" /><ref group="Note" name="anya m name" /> also known by her codename '''"M"''', was a member of the [[Hexenzirkel]]. She was the author of the renowned storybook ''[[The Boar Princess]]'' and was said to be an exceptional writer.<ref name="JAtC">{{Ref/Quest|Joy Above the Clouds}}</ref>

==Profile==
Andersdotter was a human who never received magic or combat training, and was "simply ordinary" in comparison to other members of the Hexenzirkel.<ref>[[Imaginarium Theater/Fortune Slips|Imaginarium Theater Fortune Slip]]: ''(Neat handwriting. This does not look like a fortune-telling slip...)''</ref> She was described as "''A legend that never ends''" for her stories, and her prose was able to teach [[Alice]] the meaning of grief.<ref name="JAtC"/>

In ''The Mages' Tea Party'' cutscene, Andersdotter is represented first by the cover of ''The Boar Princess'', and later by the titular Boar Princess and her fox and turtle companions.<ref name="MTT">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/RigK4OwCCM8 Story Teaser: The Mages' Tea Party | Genshin Impact]</ref>

In the Simulanka event, she creates the fictional character "[[Mini Durin|Durin]]" despite warnings from [[Barbeloth]] that "Durin" will likely share the fate of his [[Durin|real world counterpart]].

===Appearance===
Andersdotter's likeness has only been hinted once in the game's media, potentially being the one embellished on the ink pot she used, showing a woman with long, curly, seemingly orange or ginger hair.

==Story==
When I. Ivanovna decided that she would leave the group after marrying, Andersdotter, Alice, Barbeloth, [[Nicole]], and [[Rhinedottir]] wrote her a letter disguised as a prophecy, asking her to come visit them one last time before her wedding.<ref name="JAtC" />

In her old age, Andersdotter once commented to the group that because her lifespan was much shorter than some of theirs, she wished to leave her storybook &mdash; ''The Boar Princess'' &mdash; to them, and that they may pass it to the next generations.<ref name="MTT" />

==Trivia==
*It is implied that ''[[The Little Witch and the Undying Fire]]'' was written by the other Hexenzirkel members for Andersdotter. However, it is implied that she passed away sometime during the writing of Vol. 5 and never got to read it.<ref group="Note">See the Trivia section on ''[[The Little Witch and the Undying Fire]]'' for a more detailed explanation.</ref>
*Anya's middle name begins with "M." Despite having a first name and last name starting with "A," her codename became "M" as Alice had already claimed "A."
*The three manuscripts found during the Event Quest [[Narration Footnotes]] were signed by "M." as "A.A."

===Etymology===
* The name ''Andersdotter'' is likely a reference to the Danish author {{w|Hans Christian Andersen}}, who is best known for his fairy tales. ''Andersen'' is a patronymic meaning "son of Anders," making ''Andersdotter'' "daughter of Anders."
