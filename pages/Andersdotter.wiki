'''Andersdotter''' is a member of the [[Hexenzirkel]], where she is codenamed "'''M'''." 

Andersdotter is the author of the renowned storybook ''[[The Boar Princess]]'' and was said to be an exceptional writer.<ref name="quest JAtC">{{Ref/Quest|Joy Above the Clouds}}</ref>

==Profile==
Andersdotter was a human mage and a member of the Hexenzirkel, whose way with words were able to teach [[Alice]] the meaning of grief. In their letter to [[I. Ivanovna N.]], Andersdotter was described as "a legend that never ends" for her stories.

In ''The Mages' Tea Party'' cutscene, Andersdotter is represented first by the cover of ''The Boar Princess'', and later by the titular Boar Princess and the Wolf Pup.<ref name="MTT">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/RigK4OwCCM8 Story Teaser: The Mages' Tea Party | Genshin Impact]</ref>

===Personality===
''(To be added.)''

===Appearance===
''(To be added.)''

==Story==
When [[I. Ivanovna N.]] decided that she would leave the group after marrying, Alice, Andersdotter, Alice, [[Nicole]], and [[Rhinedottir]] wrote her a letter disguised as a prophecy, asking her to come visit them one last time before her wedding.<ref name="quest JAtC" />

Later on, I. Ivanovna contacted them to tell them about her decision to end her husband's life in his old age. After Rhinedottir's remark, Andersdotter commented to the group that because her lifespan was much shorter than some of theirs, she wished to leave her storybook &mdash; ''The Boar Princess'' &mdash; to them. Her remark that this story might even be passed down to the next generation piqued [[Barbeloth]]'s interest.<ref name="MTT" />

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
*The name ''Andersdotter'' is likely a reference to the Danish author {{w|Hans Christian Andersen}}, who is best known for his fairy tales. ''Andersen'' is a patronymic meaning "son of Anders," making ''Andersdotter'' "daughter of Anders."
