;今天是莱依拉的生日哦，我们快去为她庆祝吧！
:'''派蒙：'''莱依拉好厉害，赢了好多奖品~
:'''莱依拉：'''那些摊主的手法…多多观察的话，总能找到一些规律。
:'''派蒙：'''欸，这样吗？明明刚刚看的时候，眼睛都没有眨一下，除了感觉眼睛好累，完全没看出规律来。
:'''旅行者：'''有时一眨眼的功夫，摊主就已经调换好了顺序…
:'''莱依拉：'''这…很难描述，每位摊主有不一样的手法…
:'''派蒙：'''那要不我来变个戏法，你们来猜？
:'''派蒙：'''看，这里有平平无奇的三个空杯子和一颗糖&mdash;&mdash;<br>别走神，魔术开始！

;Today is [[Layla]]'s birthday, let's go and celebrate with her!
:'''Paimon:''' You're amazing, Layla! You won so many prizes~
:'''Layla:''' If you pay a little attention... to the tricks the stall-owners tend to use, you're bound to notice some patterns.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, is that so? Paimon didn't even blink while she was watching, but Paimon just got tired. Paimon didn't even notice anything was up at all!
:'''Traveler:''' Sometimes the stall-owners can change the order in the blink of an eye...
:'''Layla:''' Ah... It's hard to explain, but every stall-owner has a different technique...
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe you can try guessing a trick Paimon does!
:'''Paimon:''' Take a good look, Paimon's got three normal cups and a piece of candy&mdash;<br>Keep your eyes peeled! Here comes the magic!
