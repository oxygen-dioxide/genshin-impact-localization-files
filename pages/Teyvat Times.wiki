<small>''Release Date: March 29, 2022''<ref name="Vol. 1" /></small>

===Paimon Express===
''[[Paimon]]: Hello, Travelers, it's been a while!''

Many Travelers have recently invited Paimon to visit their [[Serenitea Pot]] and everyone's Serenitea Pots are really different in style! Paimon's very interested in all of them!<br />Hehe, let's take a look at the news Paimon gathered from the Serenitea Pot adeptus!
* Upon our investigation, up to {{Color|Pyro|45.7%}} of Travelers chose the '''Floating Abode''' when choosing a realm layout for the first time.
* On average, there are {{Color|Pyro|2.32}} '''dogs''' in each Traveler's realm, one of them actually has {{Color|Pyro|275}} '''dogs''' in their realm!
:''[[Thoma]]: "Dogs are our good friends."
* On average, Travelers made {{Color|Pyro|5,775,232}} '''Furnishings''' in a day, and with this number... They can easily go a few laps around Teyvat!

* Among them, {{Color|Pyro|17,998}} Travelers failed after being '''struck by lighting'''.

Among them, {{Color|Pyro|8,793}} Travelers '''walked''' from [[Liyue Harbor]] to [[Inazuma City]].<br />
'''In just this month''', {{Color|Pyro|12,420}} Travelers accidentally drowned on the way to Inazuma. For those Travelers, Beidou has something to say to you.

===Expedition Log: Enkanomiya===

<small>''Release Date: July 12, 2022''<ref>Twitter: [https://twitter.com/GenshinImpact/status/1546675714690252802 Official Announcement of Vol. 3]</ref></small>

"Greetings, Travelers~ Welcome to the latest edition of Teyvat Times!" - [[Paimon]]<br />
Paimon heard that some new trends have emerged in Teyvat recently due to a couple of special people.<br />
Why don't we go and have a look, Travelers?

===Trendsetters in Teyvat===
Latest Updates on the [[Black Serpents]]<br />
1. Over the past month, the number of players who challenged the Black Serpents surged by {{Color|Pyro|98.1%}}!<br />
One Traveler even challenged them {{Color|Pyro|312}} times in the same day!<br />
"Ms. Hina Standee"<br />
2. Travelers, did you notice that there was a "Ms. Hina Standee" beside the Tenryou Commission's Bulletin Board on [[Amakane Island]]?<br />
Paimon heard that everyone was very curious about the "Ms. Hina Standee," and many of you rushed there to take photos with it every day~

===New Chapter of Teyvat's Musical History===
Guess all of you have received the [[The Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival!|mysterious invitation letter]] from the [[Arataki Gang]]~<br />
Your enthusiastic participation has made the Arataki Drumalong Festival a great success!

There was a Traveler who created {{Color|Pyro|389}} music scores during the event! Paimon guesses this Traveler must have entered "the zone" or something!

During "[[The Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival]]," the most popular music score was "[[Blossoms of Summer Night]]" &mdash; it accounted for {{Color|Pyro|23.96%}} of the total number of music score challenges!

Paimon also heard that another Traveler tried a total of {{Color|Pyro|882}} other players' scores, and in a single day, this Traveler went through as many as {{Color|Pyro|149}} scores! Is this the power of music?

Hmm... Come to think of it, should Paimon introduce these two Travelers to each other?

===Records of Perilous Trail===
Paimon heard that there was {{Color|Pyro|a hidden treasure chest}} in the Realm of Snaring Illusions, did you all find it?<br />
According to the data, {{Color|Pyro|43.94%}} of Travelers have found this treasure chest! Paimon knew you could do it all along!

What's more, {{Color|Pyro|6.16%}} of Travelers completed the Realm of Snaring illusions within 15 minutes! Even Paimon cannot fly through it that fast!

There were {{Color|Pyro|13.55%}} of Travelers who completed the City of Hidden Runes without making any mistakes!

But there were also {{Color|Pyro|3,895}} Travelers who stepped on the wrong runes and failed the challenge.

Recently, there has been an increasing number of Travelers who visited [[Pervases]]' temple. Our investigation reveals that during the first week of the "[[Perilous Trail]]" quest, {{Color|Pyro|489,081}} Travelers visited the temple to offer incense in memory of Pervases.

===Liyue's New Assessment Officers===
In the "[[Umbrabilis Orchis]]" Story Chapter, about {{Color|Pyro|1%}}, of players were able to unlock the statue mechanism leading to the underwater entrance in just {{Color|Pyro|314}} seconds and faced the enemy alongside Yelan.

In the meantime, {{Color|Pyro|26.04%}} of Travelers successfully eavesdropped on the conversation between [[Zhiyi]] and [[Linlang]] in just one try.

"With that adeptness, I couldn't even tell that it was your first field work as an Assessment Officer." - [[Yelan]]

===Teyvat Trivia===
Before we say goodbye in today's Teyvat Times, did you know that some Travelers have met [[Xiao]] during a [[Daily Commission]]?<br />
In the first day after Version 2.7 update, {{Color|Pyro|0.32%}} of Travelers have met Xiao in the Daily Commission "[[Uninvited Guests (Commission)|Uninvited Guests]]"~

<small>''Release Date: August 20, 2022''<ref>Twitter: [https://twitter.com/GenshinImpact/status/1560839039057534977 Official Announcement of Vol. 4]</ref></small>

Travelers! How does it feel to be back in the [[Golden Apple Archipelago/2.8|Golden Apple Archipelago]]? The sun... the beach... [[Paimon]] likes them all! Hehe, so Paimon decided to make a special edition just for the Golden Apple Archipelago! Come and take a look!

===TRAVEL NOTES AROUND THE GOLDEN APPLE ARCHIPELAGO===
During this period, you have traveled all over the Golden Apple Archipelago~!
There are tales of your exploits on every island...

On an island just off Pudding Isle, {{Color|Ice|18.12%}} of you managed to find all the Seelie by adjusting the Bonsai Setup, and got great Treasure Chest rewards!

While exploring "[[The Islands' Stirring Strings]]," {{Color|Geo|43.79%}} of you found the [[Phantasmal Conch]] and listened to [[Xinyan]]'s passion for music~

Recently, the Twilight Theater has been busier than ever. In the first week alone, an average of {{Color|Ice|681,117}} shows were performed every day! {{Color|Ice|44.48%}} of you chose to bring the "Bystander" onto the stage! One of you from Asia even brought the "Bystander" on stage {{Color|Ice|32}} times!

Wow, that Traveler must have really wanted the Bystander Night Raven to get his big break real bad, huh?

On the first day of the [[Temple of the Star Latitudes]]' opening alone, Wolfgang received {{Color|Geo|100,906}} servings of Sweet Madame from you! At least we tried.

===BATTLE ON THE HIGH SEAS!===
The [[hilichurls]] of the Golden Apple Archipelago can't seem to catch a break. Only within a week of the Golden Apple Archipelago's opening, you collectively defeated {{Color|Ice|529,583,177}} hilichurls, and sunk {{Color|Ice|56,711,433}} hilichurl sea encampments!

Still... battles don't always go smoothly. In the first week of the event, {{Color|Ice|1,665,189}} Travelers were defeated by falling into the water.

Hmm... were you one of them?

===AN ISLAND! SET SAIL!===
There are treasure chests and stories scattered all across the Golden Apple Archipelago.
After the Golden Apple Archipelago opened, all of you were REALLY excited to explore. In one day, {{Color|Ice|56,042,023}} treasure chests were opened!

And you seem to have combed through {{Color|Ice|Broken Isle}} thoroughly, opening more treasure [[chests]] on it than any other island!

On the first day of the "[[Summertime Odyssey]]" event opening, {{Color|Ice|35.51%}} of you collected 14 Phantasmal Conches!

And on [[Twinning Isle/2.8|Twinning Isle]] and [[Broken Isle/2.8|Broken Isle]], each has a hidden Phantasmal Conch. A whopping {{Color|Ice|72%}} of you missed {{Color|Ice|at least one}} of the two conches.

In just one month, you gathered {{Color|Ice|7,986,013}} crabs! That's a lot of crabs... How many [[Crab, Ham & Veggie Bake]]s can those make? Hehehe...

==="REMINISCENT REGIMEN" OBSERVATIONS===
After the opening of the "[[Reminiscent Regimen]]" event, you've knocked an average of {{Color|Ice|4,411,604}} hilichurls off platforms every day!

YA! "Fight me fair and square!" - Translated by [[Ella Musk]]

Through teamwork, {{Color|Ice|12}} of you managed to complete all the levels of the "Reminiscent Regimen" with a {{Color|Ice|perfect score}} in one try!

That [[Heizou]] guy called Paimon a "little sidekick" and a "Voice"! What terrible nicknames! Oh right! Paimon isn't "emergency food"!
Paimon is Paimon! It was just a slip of the tongue.
