''Paimon: Hello, Travelers, it's been a while!''

Many Travelers have recently invited Paimon to visit their Serenitea Pot and everyone's Serenitea Pots are really different in style! Paimon's very interested in all of them!<br />Hehe, let's take a look at the news Paimon gathered from the Serenitea Pot adeptus!

Among them, {{Color|Pyro|8,793}} Travelers '''walked''' from Liyue Harbor to Inazuma City.<br />
'''In just this month''', {{Color|Pyro|12,420}} Travelers accidentally drowned on the way to Inazuma. For those Travelers, Beidou has something to say to you.

<small>''Release Date: July 12,2022''<ref>Twitter: [https://twitter.com/GenshinImpact/status/1546675714690252802 Official Announcement of Vol. 3]</ref></small>

"Greetings, Travelers~ Welcome to the latest edition of Teyvat Times!" - [[Paimon]]<br />
Paimon heard that some new trends have emerged in Teyvat recently due to a couple of special people.<br />
Why don't we go and have a look, Travelers?

===Trendsetters in Teyvat===
Latest Updates on the Black Serpents<br />
1. Over the past month, the number of players who challenged the Black Serpents surged by {{Color|Pyro|98.1%}}!<br />
One Traveler even challenged them {{Color|Pyro|312}} times in the same day!<br />
"Ms. Hina Standee"<br />
2. Travelers, did you notice that there was a "Ms. Hina Standee" beside the Tenryou Commission's Bulletin Board on Amakane Island?<br />
Paimon heard that everyone was very curious about the "Ms. Hina Standee," and many of you rushed there to take photos with it every day~

===New Chapter of Teyvat's Musical History===
Guess all of you have received the mysterious invitation letter from the Arataki Gang~<br />
Your enthusiastic participation has made the Arataki Drumalong Festival a great success!

There was a Traveler who created {{Color|Pyro|389}} music scores during the event! Paimon guesses this Traveler must have entered "the zone" or something!

During "The Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival," the most popular music score was "Blossoms of Summer Night" &mdash; it accounted for {{Color|Pyro|23.96%}} of the total number of music score challenges!

Paimon also heard that another Traveler tried a total of {{Color|Pyro|882}} other players' scores, and in a single day, this Traveler went through as many as {{Color|Pyro|149}} scores! Is this the power of music?

Hmm... Come to think of it, should Paimon introduce these two Travelers to each other?

===Records of Perilous Trail===
Paimon heard that there was {{Color|Pyro|a hidden treasure chest}} in the Realm of Sharing Illusions, did you all find it?<br />
According to the data, {{Color|Pyro|43.94%}} of Travelers have found this treasure chest! Paimon knew you could do it all along!

What's more, {{Color|Pyro|6.16%}} of Travelers completed the Realm of Sharing illusions within 15 minutes! Even Paimon cannot fly through it that fast!

There were {{Color|Pyro|13.55%}} of Travelers who completed the City of Hidden Runes without making any mistakes!

But there were also {{Color|Pyro|3,895}} Travelerswho stepped on the wrong runes and failed the challenge.

Recently, there has been an increasing number of Travelers who visited Pervases' temple. Our investigation reveals that during the first week of the "Perilous Trail" quest, {{Color|Pyro|489,081}} Travelers visited the temple to offer incense in memory of Pervades.

===Liyue's New Assessment Officers===
In the "Umbrabilis Orchis" Story Chapter, about {{Color|Pyro|1%}}, of players were able to unlock the statue mechanism leading to the underwater entrance in just {{Color|Pyro|314}} seconds and faced the enemy alongside Yelan.

In the meantime, {{Color|Pyro|26.04%}} of Travelers successfully eavesdropped on the conversation between Zhiyi and Linlang in just one try.

"With that adeptness, I couldn't even tell that it was your first field work as an Assessment Officer." - [[Yelan]]

===Teyvat Trivia===
Before we say goodbye in today's Teyvat Times, did you know that some Travelers have met Xiao during a Daily Commission?<br />
In the first day after Version 2.7 update, {{Color|Pyro|0.32%}} of Travelers have met Xiao in the Daily Commission "Uninvited Guests"~
