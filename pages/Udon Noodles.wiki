|description     = Highly springy noodles.
|desc_suspicious = The overly bland noodles and soup make for a boring experience. Looks like you've got to pay a bit more attention to seasoning next time.
|desc_basic      = After several rounds of rising and pulling, the result is silky smooth yet springy noodles. Unlike ramen, which prizes dense flavors, udon noodles use light flavors to heal the Inazuman soul.
|desc_delicious  = The snow-white, soft yet elastic udon, and the elegantly flavored soup combine to make a simple but comforting dish. The faintest scent of wheat may eventually travel down into your belly together with the sweet noodles, but the aftertaste of warmth will remain.
