==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Maryam:''' Hello dear, do you need a place to rest?
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Maryam:''' This is the Gilded Journey, and I'm the owner of this hotel.
::'''Maryam:''' Don't worry, I won't demand an exorbitant price just because I own the only hotel in Caravan Ribat. So, please rest at ease.
::'''Maryam:''' Of course, you can also rent a room from a local or a traveling researcher around here.
::'''Maryam:''' But because this place is a pitstop, the people that come here... It's a mixed bag. So, keep your eyes wide open when you're selecting a place to stay.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Thank you for your kind reminder.
:::'''Maryam:''' Think nothing of it.
:::'''Maryam:''' Traveling is physically demanding. The most important things to have on your trip are adequate food and a safe shelter.
:::'''Maryam:''' And these are the least we can do for our guests.
::;(Obtain [[Biryani]] ×3)
:{{DIcon}} Not at the moment.
::'''Maryam:''' Feel free to come back anytime.
