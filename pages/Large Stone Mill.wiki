|description    = A traditional and highly efficient mill. Driving that barrel requires a great deal of power, which is usually where an attached waterwheel comes in.<br />However, the following legend exists in [[Qingce Village]]: that a [[Chongyun|certain thaumaturge]] once passed this way when he was stricken by some chronic malady. Needing some [[Mist Flower]] dust desperately, he turned the mill with his bare hands at a speed that far outmatched any waterwheel.
