:'''Arashakun:''' As long as Arashakun has "courage," Arashakun won't be scared no matter how many "masked monsters" come! They will never steal "courage" again! Arashakun won't allow that!
:{{DIcon}} Actually, courage can never be stolen...
::'''Arashakun:''' ?
::'''Arashakun:''' But after "courage" was stolen, Arashakun felt weak in hands and feet...
::{{DIcon}} The courage is rooted in your heart...
::'''Arashakun:''' Hmm... what Nara {{Traveler}} said, is hard to understand...
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, so be careful with it...
::'''Arashakun:''' Arashakun will!
