{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Ootomo or Lenne after completing [[The Moon and Stars Inscribe]])
:'''Lenne:''' Ah, when I think that this journey in Inazuma must end and that we shall not read each other poems again like this, I cannot help but feel a little sad.
:'''Ootomo:''' Though they say that "all feasts must someday end," it is inevitable that we shall feel sadness. Lenne, shall we correspond via letters in the future?
:'''Lenne:''' That would be wonderful!
