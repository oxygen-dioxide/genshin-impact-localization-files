|text    = A congregation of rocks thrown into the air during eruptions and left floating by abundant [[gaseous Phlogiston]]. After years of accumulation, the once-scattered debris has formed a collective whole. It has been said that they, like [[the Upper Sanctum]], are the brush strokes of the [[Sage of the Stolen Flame]] &mdash; though this may be baseless conjecture.
