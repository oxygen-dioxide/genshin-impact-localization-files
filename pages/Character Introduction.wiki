==Trivia==
* Character introductions are posted before the character's actual release, often referred to as "{{w|drip marketing}}." This term became popular after [https://twitter.com/genshinimpact/status/1401844688559108104 a tweet] from the official ''Genshin Impact'' Twitter account referred to it as such the first time it happened a full version before. The amount of time before the character release changed over time:
** Closed Beta Test - Varies.
** [[Version 1.0]] - One to two weeks before release.
** [[Version 2.0]] - One day before the previous version, all at the same time.
** [[Version 5.3]] - One week after the previous version, spread apart a few hours or days.
