==Descriptions==
{{Description|Legend has it that hundreds of years ago, Lord [[Hiiragi Hiroshi]] of the [[Kanjou Commission]] miraculously built a prosperous trade center from a deserted island, and greatly impressed the [[Raiden Makoto|Shogun]]. In these days when the [[Sakoku Decree]] was in force, the headquarters of the Kanjou Commission still flourished. However, the merchants from faraway nations languished, and the streets were no longer the bustling appearance of a century ago. Perhaps this is the best reflection of the business of mortals: those who become successful overnight will also lose everything in a day.|Viewpoint, [[Ritou, Narukami Island]]}}
{{Description|To properly explore the realm of the Shogun during this time of the [[Sakoku Decree]], you must first pass the checkpoint in Ritou.
Ritou is under the jurisdiction of the [[Kanjou Commission]] and people need various documents to be granted passage. However, to get the necessary Travel Permit, you have to go through a very complicated procedure and have the right connections.<br>Without the Travel Permit, you can only stop briefly in Ritou. You will see other outlanders who are also stuck there, together looking out upon the desolate landscape of the fishing village with red maples and green roof tiles.|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Exploration], Genshin Impact Official Site}}

==Trivia==
* Ritou may be inspired by {{Lang|{{w|Dejima}}|ja=出島|ja_tl=Exit Island}}, the artificial island of Japan which served as Portuguese and Dutch trading posts during the {{w|Sakoku}} (closed country) period of Japan.
*There is a secret passageway behind one of the houses in Ritou that leads to an alcove by the beach, under the Statue of The Seven. Entering this passageway will allow the player to use a boat that leads to Narukami Island, therefore allowing the Traveler to explore Inazuma without completing Chisato's quest.
* The central plaza with the large maple tree is named "The [[Five Kasen]] Plaza".<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A New Painting in Pale Scarlet (Quest)}}</ref>
* All of the background female Mondstadters (including [[Susan]]) are dressed in [[Mondstadt/Culture#Fashion|Women's attire, version 4]].
