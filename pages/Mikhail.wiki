{{Lang|'''Mikhail'''|ru=Михаил|ru_rm={{#invoke:ru-rm|main|Михаил}}}} is an open-world [[NPC]] and a member of the [[Fatui]]. After completing the {{Quest|The Outlander Who Caught the Wind}}, he and his fellow Fatui diplomat [[Lyudmila]] can be found next to the [[Teleport Waypoint]] above the fountain plaza.

He is always seen talking to Lyudmila, and their dialogue changes to reflect the story's progress with the completion of major quests, such as [[Archon Quest]]s, [[Interlude Chapter]]s and some [[Story Quest]]s.
