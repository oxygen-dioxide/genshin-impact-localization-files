* Updated the monster lineup on Floors 11 – 12 of the [[Spiral Abyss]].
* Floor 11 Ley Line Disorders changed to:
** All party members' Normal Attack DMG increased by 50%.
* Floor 12 Ley Line Disorders changed to:
** Certain opponents in this challenge possess the Honed Spirit effect, which grants them 10% Physical and All Elemental RES. When opponents with Honed Spirit take hits from attacks that are considered Normal Attack DMG, they will lose 3% Physical and All Elemental RES. A maximum of 30% of each may be lost this way. The RES lost this way will be reset every 20s.
* Starting from the first time that the Lunar Phase refreshes after updating to Version 2.4, the three Lunar Phases will be as follows：
** Phase I: Blade-Flourish Moon
*** When the active character's Normal, Charged, or Plunging Attacks hit opponents multiple times within 2s, that character's Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attack DMG is increased by 5% for 8s. Max 15 stacks. This effect can be triggered once every 0.1s and will be cleared if the character goes down or leaves the field.
** Phase II: Blooming Moon
*** When the active character hits opponents with attacks that are considered Normal Attack DMG, there is a 50% chance of unleashing a shockwave at the hit opponent's position, dealing AoE True DMG. One shockwave can be released in this way every 0.3s.
** Phase III: Awakening Moon
*** When the active character's Normal, Charged, or Plunging Attacks hit opponents multiple times within 2s, the character gains a stack of Emergence for 8s. This effect can be triggered once every 0.1s. Emergence will be cleared when the character goes down or leaves the field. When the character gains 15 Emergence stacks, the stacks will be cleared and a shockwave will be unleashed that deals True DMG to nearby opponents. After a shockwave is unleashed in this way, all party members will deal 25% increased DMG for 10s.
