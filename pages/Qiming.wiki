'''Qiming''' {{Lang|zh=绮命|zh_rm=Qǐmìng}} is an [[NPC]] in [[Liyue Harbor]]. She is a fortune teller who usually sets up by the southeastern harbor between 06:00 and 18:59, where she can be seen talking to [[Zhihua]]. From 19:00 – 06:00, she can be found in front of [[Xigu Antiques]].

Zhihua is infatuated with her, but she does not return his feelings and even threatens to call the [[Millelith]] on him. In turn, it is implied she is romantically interested in [[Linlang]], and Qiming wonders if Linlang never budges on prices because she lacks charm.

==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Zhihua:''' Madam Qiming, this time I should like for you to read my fortune on the matter of... my love life.
:'''Qiming:''' Love life... again? This must be the tenth time this month...
:'''Zhihua:''' I only keep coming because your predictions are so accurate! Especially that one thing that you keep telling me, "Being preoccupied with the outcome of a divination is not conducive to finding true love."
:'''Zhihua:''' That's why from now on, my focus will be solely on the divination itself, not the outcome.
:'''Qiming:''' I see. Well, let me try to explain this differently...
:'''Qiming:''' True love may be impossibly far away, or it may be right under your nose. You cannot force it. But when its day comes, it will reveal itself to you right before your very eyes... and who knows, maybe today will be that day.
:'''Zhihua:''' Aha! I understand. I understand it now!
:'''Qiming:''' Pray tell what you presume to have understood...
:'''Zhihua:''' You DO feel the same way! From this day forth I will live solely to bring you happiness. Will you marry me!?
:'''Qiming:''' ...No thank you.
:'''Zhihua:''' Well, are you free tonight?
:'''Qiming:''' No. And now I'm calling the guards.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Qiming:''' Hello traveler. Do you share my passion for antiques?
:{{DIcon}} Antiques?
::'''Qiming:''' That's right! I might make a meager living doing fortune telling down at the docks, but I still love collecting antique items.
::'''Qiming:''' [[Linlang]] is infamously shrewd when it comes to money, we've been acquainted for years and she never budges a [[Mora]] on the price... Maybe I don't have enough charm?
::'''Qiming:''' It's strange though, because my divination clearly said my chances of finding true love today are optimal...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Qiming:''' Bye.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Event Dialogue==
===Fleeting Colors in Flight===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Qiming during nighttime.)
:'''Qiming:''' Hello there. Are you here to have your fortune told, by any chance?
:'''Qiming:''' Every Lantern Rite, many people come to me to have their fortunes read, whether it be for their careers, their health, their literal fortunes... The works.
:'''Qiming:''' It's actually a little bothersome, but more income is more income. I can't complan.
:'''Qiming:'''And now that that fellow who keeps bugging me about his romantic prospects is gone, I can finally have some peace of mind...
;(Continue non-event dialogue.)''

==Trivia==
* If you approach Qiming and [[Zhihua]], Qiming will turn to look at you, while Zhihua will not take his eyes off her and continues rambling.
* While both qǐ (绮) and mìng (命) are polysemous words, since she is a fortune teller, in this case her name is most likely to mean "beautiful destiny" (that is to say, {{zh|绮丽的命运|rm=qǐlì de mìngyùn|tl=beautiful destiny}}).<ref>Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv8715157/ {{zh|【原神】璃月里的名字考据}}]</ref> It also agrees with the fact that Zhihua, the name of a man who is infatuated with her, means "to pursue splendor" or "to pursue beauty."
