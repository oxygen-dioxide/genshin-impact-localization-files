===Geo Seals===
There are five Geo seals located around Qingxu Pool. One is located by a stone tablet, while the others are on or near the pavilions in the surrounding area. Unlocking all five seals reveals a Luxurious [[Chest]] at the same place where the stone tablet was. Among the items inside the chest is a [[Nameless Treasure]].

Interacting with the stone tablet gives the following dialogue:
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Read:''' [[Rex Lapis]] walks among us, and Liyue is secure. To mark the work of our forebears, he {{Color|buzzword|left here five seals, setting them within pavilions}}.
:'''Read:''' You who come thereafter must retrace ancients' path and acknowledge their work, and thus you shall obtain their treasure.
:'''Paimon:''' The seal over here is probably the thing this tablet is talking about... Looks like we need to use {{Color|buzzword|Geo}} to activate it.
:'''Paimon:''' According to this tablet, there should be a total of five seals. Let's have a good look around!
