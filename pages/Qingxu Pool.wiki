==Puzzles==
===Geo Seals===
There are five Geo seals located around Qingxu Pool. One is located by a stone tablet, while the others are on or near the pavilions in the surrounding area. Unlocking all five seals reveals a Luxurious [[Chest]] at the same place where the stone tablet was. Among the items inside the chest is a [[Nameless Treasure]].

Interacting with the stone tablet gives the following dialogue:
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Read:''' [[Rex Lapis]] walks among us, and Liyue is secure. To mark the work of our forebears, he {{Color|buzzword|left here five seals, setting them within pavilions}}.
:'''Read:''' You who come thereafter must retrace ancients' path and acknowledge their work, and thus you shall obtain their treasure.
:'''Paimon:''' The seal over here is probably the thing this tablet is talking about... Looks like we need to use {{Color|buzzword|Geo}} to activate it.
:'''Paimon:''' According to this tablet, there should be a total of five seals. Let's have a good look around!

==Lore==
According to legend, the Qingxu Pool ruins were built before the [[Archon War]]. After the evil god ruling the city was defeated, the city was submerged underwater until the end of the Archon War.<ref name="Roald8" /> It is unclear whether the legend of this evil god are actually referring to the Geo Dragon [[Azhdaha]], who rampaged across Lisha before [[Rex Lapis]] and three of the [[adepti]] finally sealed him in [[The Chasm (Subregion)|The Chasm]].<ref name="CandAnalysis">{{Ref/Quest|Candidature Analysis}}</ref> Records of that conflict have been memorialized in the three [[Nameless Treasure]]s, one of which can be found in Qingxu Pool.<ref>.{{Ref/HEO|Hidden in Nameless Treasures}}</ref>

While Qingxu Pool is no longer inhabited, a settlement which [[Tieshan]] hails from still exists around the area.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Tieshan|quote='''Tieshan:''' Well, actually, I'm not from the city. Qingxu Pool's where my home is, thereabouts.}}</ref>

In the past, the [[Liyue Qixing]] approved an attempt to excavate the Qingxu Pool ruins for their rumored buried treasure. However, the ruins were completely sealed shut and at the time, the technology needed to blast through solid rock did not yet exist, so the project was abandoned. Many groups have not given up on the rumors, however, including the [[Fatui]].<ref name="CandAnalysis" /> Fatui agents stationed in Liyue vied for the treasure, much to the disgruntlement of their diplomat [[Yusupov]]. During the events of {{Quest|Calculated Gambit}}, Yusupov goads [[Zhiyi]] into poisoning the Tianshu, [[Uncle Tian]], so Zhiyi can claim the position for himself &mdash; with the Fatui pulling his strings. While overseeing the Tianshu selection process, Yelan grows suspicious of Zhiyi's Qingxu Pool Redevelopment Plan proposal and discovers that it is a guise for Fatui infiltrators in the [[Blackcliff Forge]] to use the Forge's secret explosives recipes to enter the ruins and take whatever treasure they find for themselves.<ref name="CandAnalysis" /> After discovering Yusupov and Zhiyi's treachery, Yelan and the [[Traveler]] capture the co-conspirators at the [[Qingxu Pool Underground Ruins]], but not before Zhiyi backstabs Yusupov.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Foregone Conclusion}}</ref>
