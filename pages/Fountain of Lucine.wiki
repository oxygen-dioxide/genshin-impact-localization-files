{{Description|The tradition of throwing coins into springs and making wishes comes from the Fountain of Lucine. It has been listening to the wishes of Fontainians for many a long year.}}
{{Location Intro|description=<p>{{If Self|Fountain of Lucine|It|Fountain of Lucine}} is a fountain situated in front of [[Opera Epiclese]]. It is said that all water ultimately gathers at the fountain.</p>}}

[[Offering]] [[Hydro Sigil]]s to the Fountain of Lucine will increase [[Fountain of Lucine's Accolades]] level and provide rewards.

After raising Fountain of Lucine's Accolades to its maximum, the fountain gains additional water streams from each of its six corners and the main one increases in volume.

==Lore==
The Fountain of Lucine is where all the water flowing through Fontaine converges; even tears would flow back to the Fountain.<ref name="TCRR">{{Ref/Quest|The City of Rains and Remembrance}}</ref> It is customary for newlyweds to wish for children at the Fountain of Lucine,<ref name="TCRR" /> and the tradition of throwing coins into fountains originates from throwing [[Hydro Sigil]]s into the Fountain of Lucine.<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Fontaine|Elemental Sigils|quote = Few people know that the true origin of throwing coins into the fountain comes from tossing Hydro Sigils into the Fountain of Lucine, which is in fact the correct way of making a wish to the fountain.}}</ref> Originally, wishing at the Fountain of Lucine was a ritual for [[Oceanid]]s who longed for human life to be blessed by the spring water and become humans in the later months.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Finale}}</ref>

Not just water, however, flows into the Fountain; in the case of [[Vigneire]] and the victims of the missing disappearances case who all dissolved from contact with Water from the [[Primordial Sea]], their consciousnesses also converged into the Fountain of Lucine, forming an Oceanid. The voice of the Oceanid formed from their collective consciousnesses can be heard by people sensitive to the Hydro element, and heightening that sensitivity will allow a person to meet the Oceanid within the Fountain. The [[Traveler]] and [[Vacher]] accomplished this by drinking [[Water from the Primordial Sea]]. The Oceanid in the Fountain has some degree of psychic prowess, as they attempted to "drown" Vacher during their confrontation with him, which caused him to lose his mind and die from a panic attack shortly after.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|When All Return to the Waters}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* After completing {{Quest|As Light Rain Falls Without Reason}}, [[Furina]]'s crying voice can be heard from inside the Fountain of Lucine.<ref>HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/21858342 Perpetual muse of chansons and rondeaux]</ref>
** This cry was revealed to be part of Furina's thoughts during {{Quest|The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur}}. After completion of the quest, Furina's voice can no longer be heard from the fountain.
