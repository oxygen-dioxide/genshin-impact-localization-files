'''Pahsiv''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] located in [[Erinnyes Forest]], [[Fontaine]].

==Shop==
After the {{Quest|The Wild Fairy of Erinnyes}}, Pahsiv can be found inside the entrance to the cavern northeast of [[Loch Urania]]. Submitting all 6 [[Foggy Forest Branch]]es and buying every item in her shop grants the {{Achievement|Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow}}, but she can no longer be found at this location.

==Profile==
Pahsiv is a "fairy" that looks after and protects Erinnyes Forest. She uses a limited amount of words, most notably "pahsiv" for "yes" and "Melusine" for no. She is not aware of other [[Melusine]]s, [[Merusea Village]] or the [[Court of Fontaine]].

During the events of ''[[The Wild Fairy of Erinnyes]]'', the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] encounter her by chance when solving a puzzle in the Erinnyes Forest. The two deduce that she was trying to restore the [[Weeping Willow of the Lake]], which had been defiled by a [[Root-Consuming Tumor]] and a [[riftwolf]] nest. They assisted her in purging the defilement; when the riftwolves attacked, she fled, though upon seeing that they restored the tree's help, she returned with several [[chest]]s to reward them for their efforts.

===Appearance===
Her color scheme resembles a [[Primordial Bathysmal Vishap]] &mdash; her skin and hair are dark blue and eyes are pink with vertical pupils, unlike in other Melusines.

==Trivia==
* Pahsiv is likely to be a Vishap in disguise:
** Her given name, when reversed, spells out "vishap." Her skin and clothing share a similar color hue as a Bathysmal Vishap.
** Like the [[Vassals of Watatsumi]]/[[Reptilian]]s, Pahsiv has snake-like eyes with vertical pupils. Additionally, her eyes are the same color as a [[Primordial Bathysmal Vishap]].
** Pahsiv is also able to calm down a Primordial Bathysmal Vishap.
** While the Traveler is fighting [[Rifthounds]] at the [[Roots of Erinnyes]] in the {{Quest|Within the Depths of Erinnyes}}, Pahsiv disappears and a vishap appears to assist the Traveler with fighting the Rifthounds.
