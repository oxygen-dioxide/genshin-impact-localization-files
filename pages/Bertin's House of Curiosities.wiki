==Trivia==
* The wall behind Mequignon presents a piece of furniture with violins, which appears to be based on the Phonoliszt-Violina, an orchestrion created by a German musical instrument maker, {{W|Ludwig Hupfeld}}.

===Etymology===
* The shop's name may be a reference to {{W|Rose Bertin}}, a French celebrity fashion designer who pioneered Parisian ''haute couture'', and was the dressmaker and milliner to Queen Marie Antoinette.
