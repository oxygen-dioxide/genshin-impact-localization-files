|text      = Greetings, I hope you are doing well.

Today is my birthday, and I should have invited my friends over for dinner, but unfortunately, I have accepted [[Amurta]]'s invitation to give a series of talks scheduled on these days, and I can't duck out of that.

I have prepared some [[Mushroom|mushroom]] dishes for you that I find delicious in advance, I hope you like them. My dishes are lighter in flavor, so you can add some seasonings as you wish.

The rainforest has been doing quite well lately. Should you wish to come to [[Gandharva Ville]] for a short stay, you are always welcome. However, you should always pay attention to your safety when exploring. I've enclosed some glittering items in the letter that you can use to light your way in the night.

Don't hesitate to call the [[Forest Rangers]] if you need anything. Just tell them I sent you!
