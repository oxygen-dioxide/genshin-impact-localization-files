==Profile==
Berrypuff was a sheltered, weak [[Blubberbeast]] rescued from an [[Underwater Survey Mek]] that lost control. A Fontainian engineer attempted to take care of it inside an observatory station, but was unable to due to the whims of the [[Fontaine Research Institute]]. Thus, the Blubberbeast was left abandoned in the station with dwindling food supplies, slowly starving away until the Traveler and Paimon intervened.

Over time, Berrypuff regained its strength and grew healthier. The Traveler and Paimon would check on it once in a while, discovering that it had made a friend in the form of an [[Xenochromatic Creature|Xenochromatic Blubberbeast]] and was worried about its well-being over its own. They protected the creature from more Underwater Survey Meks and fed Berrypuff after each incident. Berrypuff eventually reached an adult size, now called Berrypuffier and was released back into its natural habitat, but not before showing its caretakers a [[chest]] hidden in the observatory before leaving to another area in the [[Chemin de L'Espoir]] with its friend, though it soon departed without it afterwards.
