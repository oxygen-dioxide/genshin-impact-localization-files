===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Verenata:''' I have to sort the previously-recorded data... Oh, it's you. Hello there. What can I do for you?
:{{DIcon}} About your potions...
::'''Verenata:''' I've recorded the various data gathered from our previous trials. Thanks so much for your help.
::'''Verenata:''' However, I'm still not sure what happened with that last type of potion... Only the Master Potioneer can tell you that, I'm afraid.
::{{DIcon}} Do you need any further help?
:::'''Verenata:''' We've completed the trials for three types of potions, so there's not much help needed at the moment...
:::'''Verenata:''' As for the sorting of notes and data, I believe I can handle that myself.
::{{DIcon}} You've got this!
:::'''Verenata:''' Yes. I will &mdash; I want to help more people, and help the Master Potioneer make more effective potions.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about [[Carabosse]]...
::'''Verenata:''' Ah, she does often have impressive, curious ideas. She really does know how to use unexpected things as potions ingredients...
::'''Verenata:''' Her bold, "well, I'm not the one trying the potions regardless" attitude toward formula design is most enviable.
::'''Verenata:''' There is much I still need to learn from her...
;({{cx}})
:{{DIcon}} About the earthquake just a while ago...
::'''Verenata:''' Agh! The potions I just made! They've all spilled out!
::'''Verenata:''' We'll have to start back from square one!&nbsp;... Come on, what was all that shaking just now about, anyway!?
:{{DIcon}} Hmm... No, it's nothing, really.
::'''Verenata:''' W&mdash;Well, in that case, thanks so much for helping me test the potions! Thank you!

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Verenata:''' Ah, right. While the Master Potioneer is here, I should ask about the effects of some of these ingredients...
:'''Verenata:''' Hmm? Would you like my help with anything?
:{{DIcon}} About your potions...
::'''Verenata:''' Yes. Thanks to your help previously, we were able to obtain much data concerning the Truesight Potion...
::'''Verenata:''' With that data, I'm sure the Master Potioneer will be able to improve her potions. This is all thanks to you!
::{{DIcon}} Do you need any further help?
:::'''Verenata:''' We don't have any formulae that need testing at the moment...
:::'''Verenata:''' We do have some notes and data from the previous tests that need sorting, but there aren't that many of those &mdash; I can handle them myself.
::{{DIcon}} You've got this!
::;(Same as above)
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about Carabosse...
