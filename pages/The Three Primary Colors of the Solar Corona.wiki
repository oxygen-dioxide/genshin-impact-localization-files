;(Talk to Sluasi)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. What are you doing here all by yourself?
:'''Sluasi:''' Gah! Don't suddenly talk to people while standing behind them! You almost made me scatter this powder...
:'''Paimon:''' Powder? Err, what's this stuff?
:'''Sluasi:''' Gems!
:'''Paimon:''' Gems? But why would there be any here?
:'''Sluasi:''' Wouldn't it be stranger to not find them here? I mean, this is my workshop, in which I process gems... Although I must admit that it doesn't have an official name yet.
:'''Sluasi:''' I did consider calling it "Studio Sluasi" in the past, but I'm not sure if using my name so directly is such a good idea.
:{{DIcon}} What do you mean by "processing gems"?
:'''Sluasi:''' That means that I turn gems into various pretty ornaments... and stuff?
:'''Sluasi:''' Unfortunately, I won't be able to take new commissions for a while. I need to concentrate on making paints... Well, I am still using gems for that, though.
:'''Paimon:''' You're gonna make paints out of gems? Are you serious?
:'''Sluasi:''' Yes. What's wrong?
:'''Paimon:''' Um, well, it just feels like a waste... You could just give them to Paimon...
:'''Paimon:''' But still, why do you need to make paints? Paimon's pretty sure there's no such step in using gems to make ornaments, right?
:'''Sluasi:''' Well, a child who loves painting came to ask me if I could make paints as shiny as gems and as bright as the sun.
:'''Sluasi:''' Moreover, she recently saved my younger sister when the village was shaking very violently.
:'''Sluasi:''' That's why I've decided to try to fulfill her wish by creating a "paint as bright as the sun" and giving it to her as a thank-you gift.
:{{DIcon}} Wait, you must be referring to...
:'''Paimon:''' Is the girl who enjoys painting you spoke of named [[Mamere]]?
:'''Sluasi:''' Hmm? Yes... Do you two know her?
:{{Black Screen|You tell Sluasi about your previous experiences with Mamere...}}
:'''Sluasi:''' So... So the two of you are the esteemed ones who saved [[Puca]] alongside Mamere?
:'''Paimon:''' Esteemed ones...?
:{{DIcon}} Yes, that was us.
:{{DIcon}} I wouldn't call us the "esteemed" anything...
:'''Sluasi:''' Thank you. Thank you both so much! If it weren't for you, Puca might have been...
:'''Sluasi:''' Please, take these... If you don't mind, that is!
:{{DIcon}} (Beautiful jewels...)
::'''Paimon:''' Can we really take them, {{Traveler}}? They look really expensive...
:{{DIcon}} Thank you.
:'''Paimon:''' Still, Paimon didn't think Mamere would go commission people of her own accord...
:'''Sluasi:''' Well, she didn't really commission me to do anything, did she? She just asked if I could do it. In fact, she ran off before I could even reply...
:'''Paimon:''' That... Yeah. That sounds like something she would do.
:'''Sluasi:''' Speaking of which, esteemed {{Traveler}} and Paimon...
:'''Sluasi:''' What would you call "the closest thing to the sun in color"?
:'''Sluasi:''' I have tried to observe the sun myself, but I am not sure what materials I should use to recreate its tones...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... "closest to the sun in color," you say...
:{{DIcon}} ...Gold, perhaps?
::'''Sluasi:''' Well, Canotila did tell me once that "gold is the tears of the sun," or something like that...
::'''Paimon:''' But wouldn't that be way too luxurious? There has to be something more normal we could use...
:{{DIcon}} ...The sun?
::'''Sluasi:''' ...That is true. The closest thing to the sun is indeed the sun itself.
::'''Sluasi:''' But how do I grind the sun into powder, I wonder...
::'''Paimon:''' What? Are you seriously discussing something this ridiculous?
:{{DIcon}} In that case, you could probably use my hair...
::'''Sluasi:''' ...Hmm?
::'''Paimon:''' C'mon, you can't use hair to make paints!
:'''Paimon:''' Just think. We have to have seen something that most "resembles in the sun in color" and that can be found just about anywhere...

;(Talk to Sluasi)
:'''Sluasi:''' What do you consider {{color|buzzword|"closest to the sun in color"}}?
:;(Submit {{Item|Nilotpala Lotus}}, {{Item|Cor Lapis}} or {{Item|Berry}} &times;1)

;(If submitted Niloptala Lotus)
::'''Sluasi:''' Ah, so this is the thing you call a "Nilotpala Lotus."
::'''Sluasi:''' Hmm. How strange. Why is it named for the moon, when it should be the thing "closest in color to the sun"?
::'''Paimon:''' Well, are the sun and moon really that different in color?
;(If submitted Cor Lapis)
::'''Sluasi:''' Ah, so this is what they call "Cor Lapis."
::'''Sluasi:''' Ah, it is so warm... it smells so good and feels so soft &mdash; it truly is as gentle as the sun itself. Surely, humans must use these to make food? Anyway, thank you so much. I will remember this item.
::'''Paimon:''' How... were you able to see all that?
;(If submitted Berry)
::'''Sluasi:''' Ah, I see, I see... This is the "Berry" you spoke of.
::'''Sluasi:''' It is cold and hard, yet supple... and it stings the eyes like the sunlight of a winter afternoon. Surely this must be a metal that humans forge to make their weapons! Thank you very much. I shall remember this item.
::'''Paimon:''' How... were you able to see all that?
:{{Black Screen|Sluasi carefully checks the material before handing them back to you...}}
:'''Sluasi:''' Whatever the case, thank you two for your help.
:'''Sluasi:''' However, I cannot simply take what is yours, esteemed {{Traveler}}. Thus, I shall simply learn the name of that material from you, and I shall later set out to find it myself.
:'''Sluasi:''' Still, would you not say that this color is a bit too... intense?
:'''Sluasi:''' The "color of the sun" should have a lighter touch, I think...
:'''Paimon:''' Do you mean that it should lean further toward being "white"?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, that's true. The "sun" is more "white" than it is "gold"...
:'''Sluasi:''' "White," you say? However, I am not sure what materials we must use to achieve this lighter shade...
:{{DIcon}} Couldn't we just add water?
::'''Sluasi:''' I have tried that in the past... but it did not turn out so well. Colors produced that way turn out rather murky &mdash; they lack the striking brilliance the sun has...
::'''Sluasi:''' So it would be best if we could use some other material...
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps we could go with Paimon's hair...
::'''Paimon:''' You can't make paints outta hair!
::'''Paimon:''' And even if you could, you can't just pluck Paimon's!
:'''Paimon:''' That said, we can find all sorts of bright, white things around, can't we?
----
;(Talk to Sluasi)
:'''Sluasi:''' "Something {{color|buzzword|white}}"... What is that?
:;(Submit {{Item|Sango Pearl}}, {{Item|White Iron Chunk}} or {{Item|Qingxin}} &times;1)

;(If submitted Sango Pearl)
::'''Sluasi:''' Ah, it's a pearl! But it feels a little different from the ones I've seen before. I sense a... coldness from it, of a sort.
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe. This is no ordinary pearl. It's a Sango Pearl, which means "coral pearl"!
::'''Sluasi:''' Hmm. Can corals produce pearls too? The outside world is truly fascinating...
::'''Paimon:''' Err... That's not exactly true. It's called that because they grow near corals.
;(If submitted White Iron Chunk)
::'''Paimon:''' Y'know, wouldn't "a metal painted white" simply be a "White Iron Chunk"?
::'''Paimon:''' Huh. Come to think of it, considering the price difference between stone and metal, there might actually be some unscrupulous people who might paint stone to sell it as White Iron...
;(If submitted Qingxin)
::'''Sluasi:''' Wow! It's so beautiful! And it even has a light scent to it...
::'''Paimon:''' Gathering them could be quite tough... But would that be a problem?
:{{Black Screen|Sluasi carefully checks the material before handing them back to you...}}
:'''Sluasi:''' Ah, I see, so this is the color that you call "white," yes?
:'''Sluasi:''' I cannot help but feel that this is the exact opposite of what the "sun's color" is. Would its opposite, then, not be more suitable?
:'''Paimon:''' Its "opposite"... You mean black?
:'''Sluasi:''' "Black"... Yes, that must be it. "Black." A brilliant solution, esteemed Paimon. That must be the sun's color indeed!
:{{DIcon}} This feels kinda wrong somehow...
:{{DIcon}} Wonderful and befitting of you, esteemed Paimon.
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, you cut that out!
:'''Paimon:''' But why black, though?
:{{DIcon}} Well, the sun is golden...
:{{DIcon}} So if it was the sun at night...
::'''Paimon:''' The sun doesn't become black at night! Never mind that, there isn't even a sun at night!
:'''Sluasi:''' In that case, could I ask one more thing of you two?
:'''Sluasi:''' Please, bring me something that is "black." That way, I shall know what material I must use to create "a color as radiant as the sun."
:'''Paimon:''' Do we really have to look for that? Paimon thinks we're starting to veer further and further away from anything associated with the sun...
:'''Paimon:''' But since she's asked us to... Let's go find her something that's "black," shall we?
----
;(Talk to Sluasi)
:'''Sluasi:''' If I see something {{color|buzzword|black}}, I will be able to mix a color as radiant as the sun...
:;(Submit {{Item|Sand Grease Pupa}} or {{Item|Iron Chunk}} &times;1)

;(If submitted Sand Grease Pupa)
::'''Sluasi:''' Is this a bone from some creature? I see, I see. You mean to show that the "blackness" of the sun is all that remains once something has become bereft of all life...
::'''Paimon:''' Don't say that kind of weird stuff! Anyway, Sand Grease Pupae aren't bones, they're just the shells left behind by [[Quicksand Eel]]s!
::'''Sluasi:''' Ah, like taking off old clothes? I see. They are very beautiful clothes, though. Now, if only I could sew together something similar...
;(If submitted Iron Chunk)
::'''Sluasi:''' This is... an ordinary Iron Chunk. I see, so this is what you would term "black"...
::'''Paimon:''' Well, its shade is a little off, but Paimon reckons it'll work just fine.
:{{Black Screen|Sluasi carefully checks the material before handing them back to you...}}
:'''Sluasi:''' Thank you very much. With this, I'm sure I shall be able to make pigments "as bright as the sun," which I may then give her as a gift.
:'''Paimon:''' Will this really work...?
:'''Paimon:''' Or rather, can you really make "bright colors" using such base materials?
:{{DIcon}} I suspect not.
::'''Paimon:''' But Sluasi sure does look happy, though...
:{{DIcon}} It's not utterly impossible...
::'''Paimon:''' That's true, the colors Mamere uses are pretty weird too...
:'''Sluasi:''' Whatever the case, I thank you two for your help.
:'''Sluasi:''' Please, take these as my thanks...
:'''Paimon:''' Sh&mdash;Shiny gems &mdash; and components, too!
:'''Sluasi:''' Hehe. I am glad you like them. If you desire any ornaments in the future, you know where to find me.
