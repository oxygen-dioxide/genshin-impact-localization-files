==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Big-Footed Dajiao:''' Oh, I'm Big-Footed Dajiao. Just here to take care of a few things. You? *sigh*
:{{DIcon}} About [[Rex Lapis]]' death...
::'''Big-Footed Dajiao:''' Rex Lapis' Death? I refuse to believe it.
::'''Big-Footed Dajiao:''' Rex Lapis has lived for more than a millennium, what would bring someone to do such a thing in this day and age?
::'''Big-Footed Dajiao:''' If you ask me, the [[Qixing]] are up to something.
::'''Big-Footed Dajiao:''' No wonder the staff at the ministry are so uptight, they must be feeling uneasy.
::'''Big-Footed Dajiao:''' Look at me, just rattling off whatever comes to mind. I'm just mindlessly blabbering. Don't go repeating anything to the [[Millelith]], okay?
:{{DIcon}} What're you taking care of?
::'''Big-Footed Dajiao:''' I carry bridal sedan chairs, and I've just been contracted to carry a new one, but I wanna get a sign for it so the Millelith won't stop us...
::'''Big-Footed Dajiao:''' But as soon as I started to speak, I had this certification form thrown at me. I already got certified ages ago, I came here to get a sign...
::'''Big-Footed Dajiao:''' She didn't listen to me at all... *sigh*
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Big-Footed Dajiao:''' Hey, excuse me. I was here first, please don't try to cut in line.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Big-Footed Dajiao:''' I think I ate too much, my wallet's been cleaned out again... *sigh*
:{{DIcon}} What'd you eat?
::'''Big-Footed Dajiao:''' [[Grilled Tiger Fish|Tiger Fish]] and [[Zhongyuan Chop Suey]], don't remember exactly how much I ate...
::'''Big-Footed Dajiao:''' Once I start, there's no stopping me. Work hard, eat hard, right? I got a big appetite.
::'''Big-Footed Dajiao:''' Oh yeah, did you know? Tiger fish actually used to be called something similar, but the sound changed over time... A bride I was carrying once told me.
::'''Big-Footed Dajiao:''' Ah, what was it again...?
::'''Big-Footed Dajiao:''' ...Darn, it's on the tip of my tongue...
:{{DIcon}} Nice meeting you.
::'''Big-Footed Dajiao:''' You too. Don't go starving yourself, okay!
