{{Lang|'''Shimenawa's Reminiscence'''|ja=追憶のしめ縄|ja_rm=Tsuioku no Shimenawa}}<ref group="Note">Upon the Version 2.0 release, the in-game Japanese language text mostly uses {{ja|しめ縄}} rather than {{ja|注連縄}}.</ref> is an [[Artifact Set]] available at [[:Category:4-Star Artifacts|4-star]] and [[:Category:5-Star Artifacts|5-star]] rarities which can be obtained from [[Momiji-Dyed Court]] in [[Inazuma]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* Energy will not be drained by using Elemental Skills while the effect is active.
* The Energy drain effect has a 7-frame delay (assuming 60 fps) from when Elemental Skill is cast to when the Energy is drained.
* The effect, including the Energy drain, will still trigger even if the player is interrupted during Elemental Skill cast.
* The 4-piece effect will never trigger when used on [[Mavuika]] since she doesn't use Energy.

==Trivia==
*In {{w|Shinto}}, {{w|shimenawa}} are ropes made of woven rice straw or hemp fiber used in ritual purifications, as they are believed to ward off evil spirits. Shimenawa are also placed around ''yorishiro'', objects that are believed to attract or contain {{Lang|''{{w|kami}}'' (spirits)|ja=神}}.
*The Lore explains [[Asase Hibiki]]'s story while living at the [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Subarea)|Grand Narukami Shrine]], and her relationship with [[Kitsune Saiguu]] and [[Takamine the Mistsplitter]].
