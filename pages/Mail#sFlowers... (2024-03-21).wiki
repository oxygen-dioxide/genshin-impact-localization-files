|text      = Whenever this season comes around, flowers all over Mondstadt begin to bloom one after another. Simply gazing out over the colorful countryside is enough to carry all your worries away.

I picked a whole basketful of wild flowers, hoping to make them into garlands and little ornaments to decorate the rooms of the Knights of Favonius.

But on my way back, a group of familiar-looking children crowded around as soon as they saw me, catting out my name... Though I couldn't help but feel shy, their enthusiasm was impossible to resist...

So I decided to share my flowers with them. "I'll teach them how to make flower bracelets for their family," I thought, "Their parents will be so delighted!"

Speaking of which, I've also made one for you... Would you like to come take a look?
