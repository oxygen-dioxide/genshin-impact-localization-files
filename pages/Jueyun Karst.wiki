===Interactables===
*Someone's Poetry
**Located on the bridge over the lake at Jueyun Karst
{{Dialogue start}}
::'''Someone's Poetry:''' "Here the flowing waters reach their wondrous end, with fond farewell into dreams of gods ascend. As cascades split cliffs and into the air splash, I stand at peace beneath soaring eaves vast."
{{Dialogue end}}
*Stone Tablet
**Located along the main road to Qingyun Peak
{{Dialogue start}}
::'''Read:''' "Walk to the view of the changing tide, arrive to the sight of a misty shroud. Ascend to Jueyun Karst up in the skies, sit and gaze at the unfurling clouds."
{{Dialogue end}}

==Puzzles==
===Taishan Mansion Puzzle===
[[File:Taishan Mansion Monument.png|alt=Monument in the Taishan Mansion Puzzle|thumb]]
Right above Taishan Mansion is a stone tablet hinting at the puzzle, although interacting with this tablet is not necessary.

{{Dialogue start}}
::'''Read:''' "Here stood Taishan Mansion, established by royal decree. ...But the Geo Lord wished for his residence to remain among the people of Liyue, hence, all trace of the path to that divine place was lost in the mortal realm. Now, the hidden treasure of Taishan is engulfed in water. At the sight of these words, people should leave immediately, as they should at the sight of the adeptus."
::'''Paimon:''' So this inscription means... Well, Paimon didn't get all of it... but it seems like there's treasure hiding somewhere in a body of water!
::'''Paimon:''' So is there anywhere around here that water might come out?
{{Dialogue end}}

Near the steps leading to Taishan Mansion is a glowing monument. To break the seal around it, defeat the three waves of enemies guarding the monument.

{{Dialogue start}}
::'''Paimon:''' This mechanism looks kinda suspicious.
::'''Paimon:''' Those people over there look totally suspicious. There's definitely some big mystery to uncover here!
{{Dialogue end}}
Climb up to the monument and "Start" it. The water covering Taishan Mansion will drain partway, exposing the second glowing monument down the stairs.

Break the glowing [[Grana#Geograna|Geograna]] ores and lead the Geograna to the stone lanterns surrounding the monument. After lighting all three lanterns, the seal around the monument will break, allowing you to "Start" it. More water will drain away to expose the entrance of Taishan Mansion.
{{Dialogue start}}
::'''Paimon:''' The water level has gone right down.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* Some English character voice-over lines use "Jueyun Jian," which is a directly taken from the location's Chinese name, instead of "Jueyun Karst" as written in-game and in their voice-overs' official transcriptions.
