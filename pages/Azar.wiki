==Profile==
Azar was the Grand Sage of the Sumeru Akademiya. At some point after [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]]'s death, he and the other sages wished to have a new and proper god after her replacement, [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]], was a disappointment in their eyes.

Expelled scholar [[Il Dottore]], now a [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers|Fatui Harbinger]], returned to Sumeru and offered to make them a new god, which Azar and three other sages accepted without hesitation. The other two, who opposed the plan, were subsequently locked up under his orders. He oversaw a dream samsara to harvest the energy of [[Sumeru City]]'s inhabitants. During the [[Sabzeruz Festival]], he threatened [[Nilou]] and ordered her to tear the stage down before deciding to ban public art performances.

When [[Cyno]] noticed anomalies in the data he submitted into the Akasha System, Azar declined his request to investigate and outright told him he had no right to judge him, causing him to resign as General Mahamatra in protest.

After Kusanali is freed from the sages' custody, Cyno apprehended Azar and forced him to repent in front of the Archon. After hearing that Nahida had defeated [[Scaramouche]] and restored [[Irminsul]], Azar and his accomplices supposedly repented, and they were subsequently exiled to the [[Avidya Forest]], where they now spend their time cultivating their wisdom.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Toast to Victory}}</ref>

===Personality===
Azar is shown to be highly arrogant and dismissive of those he considers below him; he refrains from further arguments with Nilou as he believes her unworthy of continuing a debate due to her supposed lack of intellectual credentials. He refuses to recognize Kusanali as his god, pretending to act as if she doesn't exist. He also prevents Cyno from investigating him, claiming that the sages gave him his position and thus he had no right to turn against them.

===Appearance===
Azar has orange eyes, white hair, and a fair complexion. He wears a purple sherwani styled with beige and green decorations. He also wears a purple cap with a copper eight-pointed star, alongside the akasha terminal on his left ear.
