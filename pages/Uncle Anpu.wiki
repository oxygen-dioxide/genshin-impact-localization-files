{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Uncle Anpu:''' Hello. Is there anything you need from me?
:{{DIcon}} Tell me a bit about yourself...
::'''Uncle Anpu:''' I've been the head of Aaru Village for a long time now. If anything happens, just come find me.
::'''Uncle Anpu:''' Food, lodgings... Whatever I can help with, I will, to the best of my abilities.
::'''Uncle Anpu:''' Also, if you encounter loose sands or abnormally strong winds out there in the desert, it's safer if you take shelter in the village as soon as possible.
::'''Uncle Anpu:''' ...Well, these don't always guarantee that a sandstorm will follow, but it never hurts to be careful...
::'''Uncle Anpu:''' Haha, would you look at that? I'm getting long-winded in my old age. Please don't mind me, youngster, hehe...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Thanks for the reminder.
:::'''Uncle Anpu:''' Good, good, as long as I got through to you.
:::'''Uncle Anpu:''' I've seen many a reckless soul run into trouble out in the desert. It's very saddening.
:::'''Uncle Anpu:''' Of course, having the daring to challenge danger is a good thing, but you can't simply ignore danger altogether.
::;(Obtain [[Adventurer's Experience]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} Hello there, Uncle Anpu.
:;(After completing [[King Deshret and the Three Magi]])
::'''Uncle Anpu:''' Ah, it's you! How have you been?
::'''Uncle Anpu:''' Isak mentioned you to me earlier. Said that he wanted to thank you properly.
::'''Uncle Anpu:''' That kid's fond of you &mdash; I can tell. You're quite the example to him.
::'''Uncle Anpu:''' A good thing, of course. Always good to see children be enthusiastic and hardworking. Always glad to see that.
::'''Uncle Anpu:''' If you aren't going to be too busy in the next couple of days, perhaps you might want to rest your feet here. Aaru Village will always welcome you.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Uncle Anpu:''' Goodbye. Stay safe.
