{{Description|Although [[Jean]] came to rescue [[Amber]], the crisis hasn't been solved. A dark conspiracy seems to be in the works.}}
'''Wind and Fyre''' is Chapter 6 of the ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' [[manga]].

==Summary==
Jean rescues Amber in time and continuously dodges the [[Krupp|golem]]'s attacks until successfully dismantling it to pieces in an opening. Amber shows her the [[Fatui]] device but they are suddenly interrupted as the golem rebuilds itself. Despite being wounded, Jean urges Amber to deliver the device to [[Mondstadt City|Mondstadt]]. The golem ignores Jean and chases after Amber instead. Realizing that it is after the device, Jean tells Amber to toss it but she refuses as the golem knocks her down.

Beforehand, Jean and [[Lisa]] examine the burned sheet of paper that caught Amber's attention. They learn that the black fire is related to [[Delusion]]s and that [[Crepus|Diluc's father]] previously owned one. Jean believes [[Diluc]] himself may be involved and sends Lisa to his manor.

Jean and Amber continue to fight the golem until Amber throws the device as bait. They combine their [[Pyro]] and [[Anemo]] elements together, bolstering Jean's sword to successfully destroy the monster.

Back in Mondstadt, the [[Collei|girl]] sneaks out of the library with the Delusion papers and accidentally runs into [[Kaeya]], who asks for her name.

==Trivia==
* During the flashback to the discussion Lisa and Jean had about the Fatui documents, a drawing of Crepus' Delusion is shown. In the manga on the official Genshin Impact website, Jean calls it an "Evil Eye" (page 2), which is a direct translation of the Chinese name for Delusions. However, in the WEBTOON version, Jean calls it a "Delusion."
