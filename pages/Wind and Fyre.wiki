{{Description|Although [[Jean]] came to rescue Amber, the crisis hasn't been solved. A dark conspiracy seems to be in the works.}}
'''Wind and Fyre''' is Chapter 6 of the ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' [[manga]].

==Summary==
''(To be added.)''

==Trivia==
* During the flashback to the discussion Lisa and Jean had about the Fatui documents, a drawing of [[Crepus]]'s [[Delusion]] is shown. In the manga on the official Genshin Impact website, Jean calls it an "Evil Eye" (page 2), which is a direct translation of the Chinese name for Delusions. However, in the WEBTOON version, Jean calls it a "Delusion."
