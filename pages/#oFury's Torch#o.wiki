|description    = A torch placed atop a stone base. The entire thing is a dark gold and has a simple yet dignified design.<br>According to a certain author's essay, "The fire that rises represents undying righteous indignation." Perhaps the flame deep within the [[Opera Epiclese]] does indeed portray Fontainians in their pursuit of justice.
