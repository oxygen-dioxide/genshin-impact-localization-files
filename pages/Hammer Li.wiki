==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Hammer Li:''' Hello, do you need something?
:{{DIcon}} You are...?
::'''Hammer Li:''' ...Me? You asking who I am? I'm just a strong pair of arms. The name's Hammer Li.
::'''Hammer Li:''' I picked that nickname myself. Apparently all I'm good for is bashing my hammer all day long.
::'''Hammer Li:''' *sigh* I wish one day the gods will smile on me and give me a Vision...
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about your work.
:::'''Hammer Li:''' My work? It's not bad. Not much to say: I hammer this, I hammer that, occasionally that old fart [[Manager Xiao]] gives me an earful...
:::'''Hammer Li:''' Anyway, I'm not getting any younger, and this job ain't gonna help me start a family, or buy a boat or house of my own, no matter how long I do it for. So I don't have any big hopes in the future.
::{{DIcon}} Vision?
:::'''Hammer Li:''' What about them? You're interested in them too?
:::'''Hammer Li:''' I've heard as long as you want something badly enough, a Vision will appear right beside you, ready to do your bidding.
:::'''Hammer Li:''' Wouldn't that be incredible? As for me... I just want a Vision, plain and simple. I've dreamed of having one since I was a little boy, but so far I've had no luck.
:::'''Hammer Li:''' If I had a Vision, I could be like those legendary martial nomads who command the wind and rain and cast lighting.
:::'''Hammer Li:''' *sigh* Where are you, my Vision? I've waited my whole youth for you...
:{{DIcon}} So, about Rex Lapis...
:;(After completing [[Rite of Descension]])
::'''Hammer Li:''' What is there to be said? I was there at the Rite of Descension too. That scared the wits out of me...
::'''Hammer Li:''' I honestly thought that is was over for us, that the sky was going to to fall over our heads.
::'''Hammer Li:''' But watching everyone go about their daily lives and have hope for the future anyway... I feel like I should reflect a little myself.
::'''Hammer Li:''' If you look at things optimistically, Rex Lapis couldn't really have left us, wouldn't you say?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye. Chin up.
::'''Hammer Li:''' *sigh* Thank you... Goodbye.
