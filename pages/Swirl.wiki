{{Elemental Reaction Intro|element1=Anemo}}

Swirl damage should not be confused with the non-Anemo damage that comes from [[Elemental Absorption]]. Swirl damage is fixed damage based only on character level and elemental mastery, while the additional elemental damage from Elemental Absorption is regular damage and is thus affected by the stats that normally affect damage, including Attack, CRIT, Damage Bonuses, and Talent Levels.

==Overview==
The Swirl reaction applies the involved non-Anemo element to all targets in an AoE, except the one that the reaction was triggered upon. {{Pyro}}, {{Electro}}, and {{Cryo}} Swirl will also deal AoE DMG of the involved element, but {{Hydro}} Swirl only spreads the Wet status and deals DMG to the target that the reaction was triggered upon.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/0AKterEZ-MY How to use Swirl] (Timestamp: 2m 40s)</ref>

Upon triggering Swirl, the spread of the Swirled element can cause secondary reactions. Damage from these are based on the [[Elemental Mastery]] and level of the Anemo character. As a result, Anemo characters can indirectly cause most reactions. For example:

* Target 1 is affected by Pyro.
* Target 2 is affected by Electro
* Applying Anemo to Monster 1 will cause a Pyro Swirl, which applies Pyro to Target 2.
* The Pyro application from Swirl will trigger an [[Overloaded]] reaction on Target 2, dealing DMG based on the Anemo character's level and EM.

Swirl reactions that trigger secondary [[Melt]], [[Vaporize]], or [[Aggravate]] reactions will also see their DMG increased based on the Anemo character's level and/or EM. See [[Damage#Swirl/Burning-Induced Reaction Damage]] for more information.

Note that one target can only take '''2''' instances of Swirl DMG every '''0.5''' seconds from the same attacker, as limited by the [[Damage Sequence]].<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/0AKterEZ-MY How to use Swirl] (Timestamp: 3m 50s)</ref> Additionally, multiple Swirl reactions triggered on the same target within '''0.1''' seconds can only produce DMG and elemental application once, regardless of the source. These limits are separate for Swirls of different elemental types.

When {{Anemo}} comes into contact with {{Hydro}}/{{Pyro}}/{{Cryo}}/{{Electro}}, the Swirl reaction will be triggered. This reaction will cause the element in contact with {{Anemo}} to affect a larger area, and can even trigger other reactions...

Use {{Hydro}}, {{Pyro}}, {{Cryo}} and {{Electro}} attacks in battle to infuse opponents with the elements. Switch to an {{Anemo}} character and use {{Anemo}} attacks to trigger the Swirl reaction to affect opponents with the elements more effectively!{{Clr}}
