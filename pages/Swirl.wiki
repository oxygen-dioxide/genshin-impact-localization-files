{{Elemental Reaction Intro|element1=Anemo}}

Swirl damage should not be confused with the non-Anemo damage that comes from [[Elemental Absorption]]. Swirl damage is fixed damage based only on character level and elemental mastery, while the additional elemental damage from Elemental Absorption is regular damage and is thus affected by the stats that normally affect damage, including Attack, CRIT, Damage Bonuses, and Talent Levels.

==Overview==
The Swirl reaction applies the involved non-Anemo element to all entities in an AoE, except the one that the reaction was triggered upon. {{Pyro}}, {{Electro}}, and {{Cryo}} Swirl will also deal AoE DMG of the involved element, but {{Hydro}} Swirl only spreads the Wet status and deals DMG to the target that the reaction was triggered upon.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/0AKterEZ-MY How to use Swirl] (Timestamp: 2m 40s)</ref>

Upon triggering Swirl, the spread of the Swirled element can cause secondary reactions. Damage from these are based on the [[Elemental Mastery]] and level of the Anemo character. As a result, Anemo characters can indirectly cause most reactions. For example:

* Monster 1 has Hydro state.
* Monster 2 has Electro state.
* Applying Anemo to Monster 2 will cause a Swirl, spreading the previous Electro state to everyone in range.
* Monster 1, previously wet, will receive Electro state from Swirl and this will cause an Electro-Charged reaction.

When applying Anemo to a target affected by [[Electro-Charged]], it is possible to trigger Electro Swirl and Hydro Swirl simultaneously. In this case, the Electro Swirl will take priority, and the Hydro Swirl will only be triggered if there are still leftover [[gauge unit]]s of Anemo after depleting the Electro aura.

Note that one target can only take '''2''' instances of Swirl DMG every '''0.5''' seconds, as limited by the [[Damage Sequence]]. This limit is separate for Swirls of different elemental types.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/0AKterEZ-MY How to use Swirl] (Timestamp: 3m 50s)</ref>

Since Swirl applies an elemental status, it is possible for it to trigger further Transformative and Amplifying Reactions. For example: {{Color|Anemo|Swirling}} an enemy unit afflicted with {{Pyro}} which is nearby another enemy unit that is afflicted {{Cryo}} will cause a '''Melt Reaction'''.

When {{Anemo}} comes into contact with {{Hydro}}/{{Pyro}}/{{Cryo}}/{{Electro}}, the Swirl reaction will be triggered. This reaction will cause the element in contact with {{Anemo}} to affect a larger area, and can even trigger other reactions...

Use {{Hydro}}, {{Pyro}}, {{Cryo}} and {{Electro}} attacks in battle to infuse opponents with the elements. Switch to an {{Anemo}} character and use {{Anemo}} attacks to trigger the Swirl reaction to affect opponents with the elements more effectively!{{Clr}}
