<!-- Hello -->

|vo_01_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} Hello.ogg
|vo_01_01_tx         = Hi there. I'm Tighnari, Forest Watcher of the [[Avidya Forest]]. My duty is to preserve both the rainforest's ecosystem and the safety of its visitors. If this is your first time here, I suggest you first peruse the Avidya Forest Survival Guide, paying particular attention to the chapter "Distinguishing Between Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms."

<!-- Chats -->

<!-- About -->

|vo_05_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About {character} - Profession.ogg
|vo_05_01_tx         = I studied botany in the [[Amurta]] Darshan. My [[Naphis|academic adviser]] wanted me to join the faculty after graduation, but to be quite honest, I prefer a somewhat freer research environment. From my observations, the way that the [[Akademiya]] handles certain matters leaves much to be desired. Fortunately, my adviser didn't push the issue &mdash; heh, not like that would've worked.
|vo_05_01_mention    = Naphis

|vo_05_02_title      = About {name}: Kin
|vo_05_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About {character} - Kin.ogg
|vo_05_02_tx         = Many people think that [[Tighnarian|my kind]] are loners, and I don't blame them for thinking that. The few of us around are mostly scholars, and we're always chasing our research &mdash; so you'd be lucky to spy a single tuft of tail fur in a whole year. Like my father, for example. He's an entomologist, and lately, he's been studying the evolution of beetles in the desert... I have no intention of joining him. I'm ashamed to admit that I don't tolerate the sun very well. Prolonged exposure turns my brain and body into mush.
|vo_05_02_mention    = Tighnari's Father

<!-- About Us -->
|vo_06_01_title      = About Us: Getting Along
|vo_06_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Us - Getting Along.ogg
|vo_06_01_tx         = I believe that the best way to achieve mutual understanding with someone is to spend time with them. Other methods are less realistic. That's why there is no need to rush introductions. Time will settle everything.

|vo_06_02_title      = About Us: Friends
|vo_06_02_friendship = 6
|vo_06_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Us - Friends.ogg
|vo_06_02_tx         = "Are we officially friends?" What, so this sort of thing needs official documentation now? Okay then... Well, hand over your "friendship certificate." I assume it'll need my signature.

<!-- Miscellany I -->
|vo_07_01_title      = About the [[Vision]]
|vo_07_01_friendship = 4
|vo_07_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About the Vision.ogg
|vo_07_01_tx         = I remember praying as a kid that if I were lucky enough to receive a Vision, it had to be a [[Dendro]] one. It wasn't because of research. I just wanted to make a vine ladder to reach high-hanging fruit.

|vo_07_02_title      = Something to Share: Aranara
|vo_07_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share - Aranara.ogg
|vo_07_02_tx         = I've heard about the [[Aranara]] for some time now, but I haven't personally seen any. Sometimes, I hear rustling sounds from the forest's depths, but they disappear when I go closer. That's a good thing, though. At least they know how to protect themselves, unlike those stupid adventurers whose first thought when they run into an Avidya Leopard is "Ooh, maybe I'll form an inter-species friendship today."

|vo_07_03_title      = Something to Share: Karkata
|vo_07_03_friendship = 4
|vo_07_03_quest      = The Unanswerable Problems
|vo_07_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share - Karkata.ogg
|vo_07_03_tx         = Don't worry about [[Karkata]]. I told the [[Matra]] I know that it's my research assistant. If anyone wants to do anything to it, they'll need to go through me. ...Since you seem to care a lot about Karkata, why don't you enroll in some courses at the [[Spantamad]] Darshan? That way, you can care for it even if I'm gone.

|vo_07_04_title      = Interesting Things
|vo_07_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} Interesting Things.ogg
|vo_07_04_tx         = Did you know that plants can camouflage themselves? Some mimic insects or birds to intimidate their natural predators, others produce bait to attract pollinators, and still others are obligate carnivores that utilize enticing fragrances or honey to lure in their prey... Hmm, I feel like I'm not just talking about plants anymore.

<!-- About teammates -->
|vo_08_01_title      = About [[Collei]]
|vo_08_01_friendship = 4
|vo_08_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Collei.ogg
|vo_08_01_tx         = When that child was first brought here, she was effectively illiterate. It wasn't a huge issue, though. She's a hard worker and a diligent student, so she's made good progress. Still, her goal is to learn advanced medical techniques, so she still has a long way to go. She sometimes puts too much pressure on herself... Help her out when you can, would you? Consider it a favor for me as her mentor. Thanks a lot.
|vo_08_01_mention    = Collei

|vo_08_02_title      = About [[Cyno]]: General Mahamatra
|vo_08_02_friendship = 4
|vo_08_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Cyno - General Mahamatra.ogg
|vo_08_02_tx         = You want to see Cyno...? Well, firstly, a word of caution: if he ever comes chasing you down for work-related reasons, prepare for the nightmare of a lifetime. Other than that, General Mahamatra is a high-ranking position, so it usually isn't easy to find him. But he does occasionally go to [[Gandharva Ville]] to see Collei. As much as he might want to stay unnoticed, he can't fool my ears.
|vo_08_02_mention    = Cyno,Collei

|vo_08_03_title      = About [[Cyno]]: Good Question
|vo_08_03_friendship = 4
|vo_08_03_quest      = Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises
|vo_08_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Cyno - Good Question.ogg
|vo_08_03_tx         = After my adviser's rescue, I wrote him a letter to send my regards. To my surprise, he wrote back saying that someone had already given him my regards in person. He ended the letter with a question "The General Mahamatra said he hopes that the sages will enjoy 'a more tasteful reputation' thanks to the efforts of our Darshan. Whatever do you suppose he meant by 'a more tasteful reputation'?"&nbsp;...It's a good question. I'd like to know, too.
|vo_08_03_mention    = Cyno,Naphis

|vo_08_04_title      = About [[Alhaitham]]
|vo_08_04_friendship = 4
|vo_08_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Alhaitham.ogg
|vo_08_04_tx         = Be careful of Alhaitham. I'm not saying he's a bad guy, but he purely operates by rationality, so people often find his actions unacceptable. If you don't believe me, just ask his [[Kaveh|roommate]] &mdash; thanks to Alhaitham, he has more pent-up frustration than an angry [[Anemo Slime]].
|vo_08_04_mention    = Alhaitham,Kaveh

|vo_08_05_title      = About [[Kaveh]]
|vo_08_05_friendship = 4
|vo_08_05_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Kaveh.ogg
|vo_08_05_tx         = Kaveh is a famous architect in [[Sumeru]]. The [[Palace of Alcazarzaray]] is his magnum opus. During the initial planning, he even asked me to recommend suitable ornamental flora. I don't know why or how, but he ended up heavily in debt after the palace was completed. Alhaitham is helping out by letting him stay at his place, but... I don't know whether that's a blessing or a curse...
|vo_08_05_mention    = Kaveh,Alhaitham

|vo_08_06_title      = About [[Dori]]
|vo_08_06_friendship = 4
|vo_08_06_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Dori.ogg
|vo_08_06_tx         = The renowned Lord Sangemah Bay is none other than Dori. I became acquainted with her through a previous research project. It had required very rare materials, and the only way I could get them was through her and her mysterious supply network. Uh... never you mind what I was buying and what I was researching, thank you very much!
|vo_08_06_mention    = Dori

|vo_08_07_title      = About [[Layla]]
|vo_08_07_friendship = 4
|vo_08_07_quest      = Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises
|vo_08_07_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Layla.ogg
|vo_08_07_tx         = I've heard of her, the famous "Sleepwalking Eccentric." The rumors about her sleepwalking are really quite absurd: feats of superhuman strength, sprinting through [[Aaru Village]] at night, scaling the [[Wall of Samiel]] with her bare hands... Some even say that she can write a 100,000-word thesis while asleep! What a load of nonsense.
|vo_08_07_mention    = Layla

|vo_08_08_title      = About [[Lisa]]
|vo_08_08_friendship = 4
|vo_08_08_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Lisa.ogg
|vo_08_08_tx         = Cyno has mentioned her before &mdash; an extraordinary genius with a veritable wealth of knowledge and talent. A pity that she returned to [[Mondstadt]] so long ago. Perhaps, in the course of her study, she witnessed the horrifying side of knowledge...
|vo_08_08_mention    = Lisa,Cyno

|vo_08_09_title      = About [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]]
|vo_08_09_friendship = 4
|vo_08_09_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Lesser Lord Kusanali.ogg
|vo_08_09_tx         = As a student, I once heard this saying: "Plants and the Land of Dendro share the same history." It could just be one of those things that people say, but I've always felt that there's a deeper meaning to those words... If I meet Lesser Lord Kusanali one day, I wonder if she would explain them to me?
|vo_08_09_mention    = Lesser Lord Kusanali

|vo_08_10_title      = About [[Dehya]]
|vo_08_10_friendship = 4
|vo_08_10_quest      = Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises
|vo_08_10_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Dehya.ogg
|vo_08_10_tx         = Everything happened so fast, and I didn't get the chance to properly thank her. To have a capable and reliable person like her on your side is extremely fortunate. I'm sure she must have many groups trying to persuade her to join their ranks. But she definitely doesn't strike me as the kind of person who would be interested in joining the Akademiya or the [[Forest Ranger]]s, so I'll spare myself the inevitable rejection.
|vo_08_10_mention    = Dehya

|vo_08_11_title      = About [[Faruzan]]
|vo_08_11_friendship = 4
|vo_08_11_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Faruzan.ogg
|vo_08_11_tx         = Madam Faruzan possesses an extensive wealth of knowledge. I often invite her to inspect the mechanisms in the rainforest. The next time she's in Gandharva Ville... *sigh* I hope she doesn't sneak Collei more food. Nutrition is like medicine: moderation is key.
|vo_08_11_mention    = Faruzan,Collei

|vo_08_12_title      = About [[Sethos]]
|vo_08_12_friendship = 4
|vo_08_12_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Sethos.ogg
|vo_08_12_tx         = Sethos? Pretty interesting guy. He's like a distant cousin of Cyno's. Really easy to get along with. Last time he visited us in Gandharva Ville, he insisted on showing off his tent-pitching skills and had a fishing competition with Cyno. Collei got really upset, because she thought there was nothing for her to do anymore...<br>People say Sethos is good at keeping himself amused &mdash; he certainly seems pretty cheerful. But he takes his work very seriously. Hmm, although I don't know how accurate "work" is &mdash; I think he sees his role at the [[Temple of Silence]] as more of a kind of duty. Anyway, if you ever find yourself needing assistance in the desert, I'm sure he'd be a good person to go to.
|vo_08_12_mention    = Sethos,Cyno,Collei

If you want to split hairs, then yes, these courses would be considered as "dissemination of information" by the Akademiya. But what are they gonna do &mdash; lock me up? I dare them.

Business is booming, everyone's so lively, and the theater is full of song and dance. Unfortunately, my ears don't tolerate loud sounds very well... Huh? You'll cover my ears for me? ...It'd be way too hard to walk like that! Thanks for the thought, though.

|vo_10_03_tx         = This may sound strange, but although the blood of a carnivore runs through my veins, [[mushroom]]s are the one food that I can't give up. There are many species of edible mushrooms. Whether fresh or dried, they all give off a unique scent. Even when stewed with meat, it's the mushrooms' aroma that comes out on top.
