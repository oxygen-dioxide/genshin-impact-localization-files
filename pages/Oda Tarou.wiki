===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing [[Reminiscence of Seirai]].''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Hello, are you an outlander traveling in Inazuma?
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Although being on a journey is fun, don't forget to go home sometimes.
:{{DIcon}} About your homeland...
::'''Oda Tarou:''' My homeland is [[Seirai Island]]. Every generation of my family has resided there. Later on, we were relocated by the [[Shogunate]] alongside the other residents on the island to Narukami Island.
::'''Oda Tarou:''' There are many descendants of the Seirai Island locals in Inazuma now. I remember, for instance, that [[Fujiwara Toshiko|Miss Fujiwara]]'s ancestors were from Seirai as well.
::{{DIcon}} Why did the Shogunate tell you to move?
::'''Oda Tarou:''' The reason... Well, I can't remember. It's been many generations after all.
::'''Oda Tarou:''' Some people said it was because of the rampant lightning storms on Seirai Island. Some said it was to prevent smuggling and stowaways... Anyway, there are many theories, and they all sound pretty plausible.
::'''Oda Tarou:''' As the children of the Electro Archon, we listened to the Shogunate's order, of course. After relocating to [[Narukami Island]], my family started doing business in the city, and we eventually became affluent. Turns out it's actually better than staying on a lonely island.
::'''Oda Tarou:''' Still, [[Seirai Island]] is my hometown. To think that we have no idea what's going on there anymore...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Oda Tarou:''' Farewell! I wish you good fortune in the long journey ahead.

::'''Oda Tarou:''' There are many descendants of the Seirai Island locals in Inazuma now. I remember, for instance, that [[Fujiwara Toshiko|Miss Fujiawara]]'s {{sic}} ancestors were from Seirai as well.
::{{DIcon}} Why did the Shogunate tell you to move?

::'''Oda Tarou:''' Right, I should also thank you again for taking those photos for me on Seirai Island.
::'''Oda Tarou:''' Thanks to you, I finally know what my homeland of old looks like today.
::'''Oda Tarou:''' *sigh* I'd love to go there in person should the opportunity arise...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Oda Tarou:''' Farewell! I wish you good fortune in the long journey ahead.
