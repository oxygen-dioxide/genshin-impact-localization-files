'''Vikram''' is a member of [[Vahumana]]<ref name="Baharak">{{Ref/NPC|Baharak}}</ref> who has been mentioned by several [[NPC]]s in [[Sumeru]] as one of the candidates for the Grand Conservator position, alongside [[Rifaet]]. Vikram's supporters believe his personable nature and charisma are what [[Sumeru Akademiya]] needs to maintain its prestige.

==Profile==
{{Quote|Vikram is the obvious candidate for the next Grand Conservator. He's good at communicating, and will surely be able to strike a balance between the various schools of thought.|Shatir}}
Vikram is a charismatic and persuasive individual, and has managed to get funding for his research despite the Akademiya's increasingly limited funding for regular researchers and students.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Shatir}}</ref>

Vikram's research focuses on [[King Deshret]], and he is sponsoring [[Baharak]]'s adventure to the desert to find traces of King Deshret's kin (or familiars). He also asked Baharak to pass on a message to [[Gohar]], a woman living in [[Caravan Ribat]], to meet him in [[Sumeru City]]. By the time Baharak arrived, however, Gohar had already received a letter via [[Dusk Bird]] with the same message and left for the city.<ref name="Baharak" /><ref>{{Ref/NPC|Safie}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* There are suggestions that Vikram and Gohar are lovers. According to a message on the [[Akademiya Public Message Board]], Vikram is married,<ref>{{Ref/BB|Akademiya Public Message Board|About Rifaet and Vikram}}</ref> and [[Hawad]] in [[Caravan Ribat]] says that [[Gohar]] traveled to Sumeru City to meet with her lover. Furthermore, a message on the [[Caravan Ribat Bulletin Board]] has its author refer to their lover as "learned and wise";<ref>{{Ref/BB|Caravan Ribat Bulletin Board|A Lover's Message}}</ref> based on context clues from the NPCs in Caravan Ribat, this message was likely written by Gohar herself.
* According to [[Arina]] and [[Armin]], he has taught students that [[Aranara]] exist "conceptually," though they aren't sure what he means by that.

===Etymology===
* The name {{w|Vikram (name)|Vikram}} is derived from Sanskrit and is generally translated as "valorous."
