{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Shinozuka:''' Ah! Who are you?! And how did you get here?
:'''Shinozuka:''' Eek... Sorry about that, it just feels a little spooky around here. Am I thinking on it too much?
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here?
::'''Shinozuka''' I am a horror novel writer. I've recently hit a wall in my inspiration and it's been hindering my work.
::'''Shinozuka''' I heard rumors that said that there are ghosts in this deserted temple, so I came to see what I could find.
::'''Shinozuka''' But I immediately realized that this was no place for the living... Even the temperature feels lower here...
::'''Shinozuka''' Ah, what should I do? Should I go inside the temple and have a look? I need to prepare myself. I need to be brave...
:{{DIcon}} Silly-churl, billy-churl...
::'''Shinozuka''' Geez... what an eerie song! P&mdash;Please stop singing it!
::'''Shinozuka''' Y-You're a living person, right? You don't seem to be see-through...
::'''Shinozuka''' But if you're here, maybe... *shivers* Ahh, it's getting a little too scary in here...
::'''Shinozuka''' I'm just here for some inspiration for my horror novel! I&mdash;I didn't mean to offend you!
::{{DIcon}} Sorry... Just take care of yourself, alright?
::'''Shinozuka''' Huh? You're not a ghost? Whew... Thanks for the reminder, but please don't scare me like that again.
::'''Shinozuka''' Wait... Can you sing the song that you were singing again?
::'''Shinozuka''' It has an eerie feel to it, can you teach it to me? Maybe I can find some inspiration if I sing while I'm writing my novel.
:{{DIcon}} Be careful. Goodbye.
:'''Shinozuka:''' Hmm, should I go into the temple or not...
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
* The "eerie song" that the Traveler sings is [[Hu Tao]]'s "Hilitune."
