The '''Serenitea Pot''' or '''Realm Within''' (colloquially also known as '''Teapot''', '''Housing''', '''Homeland''', or '''Player Housing''') is a system in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' that allows the player to create their own home. Players interact with the system using a gadget of the same name.

Players can request to visit their friend's Serenitea Pot in [[Co-Op Mode]] regardless of the [[World Level]]. Inside, the player will be greeted by the Teapot Spirit [[Tubby]], who will provide access to various features of Housing.

==How to Access==
After reaching [[Adventure Rank]] 28 and completing the {{Quest|A New Star Approaches}}, the {{Quest|A Teapot to Call Home: Part I}} will be unlocked. Complete this quest to obtain the Serenitea Pot.

[[File:Serenitea Pot Usage.png|200px|thumb|alt=A series of images showing how to use the Serenitea Pot gadget to enter and exit the realm]]
Place the Serenitea Pot gadget on a valid surface and interact with it to enter the teapot. If a [[Sub-Space Waypoint]] is placed inside the realm, they can be teleported to via the Serenitea Pot [[Map]] Tab. The [[Main Building/Mansion|Mansion]] can be teleported to from the Map as well. While inside the teapot, placing and interacting with the Serenitea Pot gadget or teleporting to a [[Teleport Waypoint]] in Teyvat will exit the teapot.

If the player logs out while inside the Serenitea Pot and then logs back in, they will be placed at the location in [[Teyvat]] where they entered the Serenitea Pot. Note that certain [[Gadget]]s like the [[Parametric Transformer]] cannot be used while inside the Serenitea Pot (see [[Errors]]).

==Furnishings==
{{Main|Furnishing}}
In the realm, the player can place buildings, geological features, furniture, decorations, plants, animals, and more according to their liking. These furnishings can be obtained from increasing Trust Rank, completing the Adeptal Mirror, participating in events and World Quests, and exchanging [[Realm Currency]] from the Realm Depot or Teapot Traveling Salesman.

After obtaining and learning [[Furnishing Blueprints]], the player can interact with the Teapot Spirit Tubby to craft furnishings. The [[Serenitea Pot Material|furnishing materials]] are obtained by cutting down trees, collecting ore and plants, and crafting fabric and dye via Tubby's crafting menu.

==Furnishing Sets==
{{Main|Furnishing Set}}
Furnishing Sets are groups of furnishings that can be placed in a set arrangement. Furnishing Set Blueprints can be obtained from Adeptal Mirror, Trust Rank, and Realm Depot. [[Serenitea Pot/Sets#Gift Sets|Gift Sets]] are special Furnishing Sets that can have Companions invited to them for special dialogue and rewards.

The Create Set button in Furnishing Placement screen can be used to select multiple pieces of Furnishings and combined to create a custom set of up to 99 furnishings. These custom sets allow multiple furnishings to be moved at once.

==Companions==
{{See also|Companion}}
<section begin="Companions" />
After completing the {{Quest|Idle Teapot Talk}}, the player can invite their playable [[characters]] obtained other than the [[Traveler]] to live in their Serenitea Pot.

The player can host up to 8 Characters in the realm after achieving the highest Trust Rank. While in the realm, characters will generate [[Companionship EXP]] over time known as Realm Bounty. This is indicated by a gift with a purple gauge meter. The higher the Adeptal Energy Rank, the more Companionship EXP is generated overtime. Players can also interact with characters hosted in the realm.

Some characters have furniture sets that they favor. When invited into these sets, the specified characters will have a special dialogue and gift some one-time rewards. Characters placed within the Realm can be invited to their Gift Set without moving them in the Furnishing Placement menu.

Like Animals and Furnishings, Characters will be counted towards the total load of the area they are placed in.

==Load (Furnishing Capacity)==
{{Main|Serenitea Pot/Load}}
"Load", also known as "Furnishing Capacity", is an indicator used to tell the player how many more furnishings they can place. Each furnishing has its own load, with large buildings taking up more load than smaller objects. Due to their need for animations and pathing, animals and characters use relatively high load compared to other furnishings. Many [[Furnishing/List/By Feature#Interactable Furnishings|Interactable Furnishings]] also take up a lot of load.

Load uses a traffic-light system, with green telling the player they can still place many more furnishings, orange indicating that they are running out of space, and red indicating that space is very limited, or that they have already reached the max capacity.

==Adeptal Mirror==
{{Main|Serenitea Pot/Adeptal Mirror}}
The Adeptal Mirror includes missions that give Furnishing Blueprints and Furnishings. It works similarly to the [[Adventurer Handbook]].

==Trust Rank==
Trust Rank is increased by obtaining {{Item|Trust|24}} from creating each [[Furnishing]] for the first time.

==Jar of Riches==
[[File:Icon Jar of Riches.png|200px|thumb|right]]
{{Quote|A precious jar that can extract wealth from Adeptal Energy.<br>Perhaps the accumulated Realm Currency can be exchanged with teapot spirits for some special goods.}}
Placing furnishings can increase the amount of Adeptal Energy.

Adeptal Energy is separate for each realm. The realm with the highest Adeptal Energy determines the Realm Currency and Realm Bounty accumulation rate, even if the player does not currently have that realm set as their active realm. Thus, players only need one Fit for a King realm to fully benefit from the Jar of Riches.

The Adeptal Energy Overview tab displays the Adeptal Energy of all areas in all unlocked realms.

==Realm Depot==
{{Main|Serenitea Pot/Realm Depot}}
The Realm Depot is the primary shop where [[Realm Currency]] is used to purchase items, furnishings, and furnishing blueprints.

==Teapot Traveling Salesman==
'''[[Chubby]]''' (aka '''Teapot Traveling Salesman''') is a teapot spirit that visits the Traveler's realm every Friday [[Reset|daily reset]]. The Teapot Traveling Salesman will bring some novel furnishings every week to exchange with [[Realm Currency]], and the Furnishing Blueprints they bring to each Traveler will be different.

Travelers and friends share the number of times they can redeem furnishings at the Travel Depot.

===Visit Times===
[[File:Teapot Traveling Salesman On Map.png|400px|thumb|right|The Traveling Salesman can be found on the map by looking for a teapot icon with a yellow symbol inside]]
From 4:00 AM every Friday to 4:00 AM on the Monday of the next week, the Teapot Traveling Salesman will visit your realm, bringing precious wares and rare treasures.

From 4:00 AM every Saturday to 4:00 AM on the Monday of the next week, you can also visit other player's realms to exchange with the Traveling Salesman.{{clr}}

===Traveling Depot===
{{Vendor|Chubby|Traveling Depot}}

===Dialogue===
{{Transclude|Chubby|Dialogue}}

==Realm Music==
{{Main|Realm Music}}
The ambient music in the Serenitea Pot varies depending on the current Realm Layout or Realm Mansion, but can be overridden by tracks of the player's choosing by using the Realm Music interface of Euphonium Unbound furnishings. Additional soundtracks can be unlocked by finding and redeeming [[Radiant Spincrystal]] collectibles.

==Replication==
{{Main|Replication}}
The replication feature allows players to share a Replica of an area with a Replica ID, which can be used by other players in their own Serenitea Pot.

==Co-Op Mode==
To visit a [[Friends]]' Serenitea Pot, head to the [[Paimon Menu]] and go to Friends. Under the Friend's profile avatar, select the option to visit their Serenitea Pot. Players can visit a Friends' Serenitea Pot regardless of their [[World Level]].

Visiting others' Serenitea Pots to buy from their [[Chubby|Traveling Salesman]] is required to advance in the [[Adeptal Mirror]] and complete [[Battle Pass]] Missions. When any player buys an item from the Traveling Salesman, that item will become unavailable to everyone else during that weekened.

A guest is able to speed up the [[Creation]] of Furnishings for their friends by heading to [[Tubby]] and activating the Guest Assistance. This will reduce the creation time by 4 hours max. One friend may only speed up one Creation per day, but it's possible to help multiple different friends in one day.

Guests cannot edit the realm of the host in any way and the host cannot edit their own realm while another player is present. Guests may enter the Mansion and interact with most [[Furnishing/List/By Feature#Interactable Furnishings|Interactable Furnishings]] the host has placed (such as [[crafting]] by using an [[Alchemist's Crafting Bench]] or sitting on any chair/sofa). However, guests cannot speak to [[Companion]]s, nor change the appearance of any furnishing by interacting with it (such as [[Furnishing Subsystem]]s or [[Lingering Moment]]). When interacting with [[Tubby]], the guest can only choose to activate the Guest Assistance or cancel the dialogue.

While inside your own Serenitea Pot, opening the [[Map]] and switching the Guests option at the top right to '''Allow Direct Join''' allows your Friends to join even if you are offline. Speeding up the creation of Furnishings is still possible to be done if the host is offline. This setting is independent from world permissions.
