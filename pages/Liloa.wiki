:'''Liloa:''' That guy [[Manua]], I swear... He probably gave in to [[Amina|chief]]'s request again.
:{{DIcon}} You're...
::'''Liloa:''' Hello. I am the stage designer here.
::'''Liloa:''' ...Although, it's probably more accurate to say I work with everything to do with the tourism industry of the tribe.
::'''Liloa:''' After all, the tourism industry is our main source of income. Besides public performances, I also work with music production and site promotions.
::{{DIcon}} So you're the money person, right?
::'''Liloa:''' Well, someone's got to do the work!
::'''Liloa:''' Manua's got a lot of experience, but he cuts Miss Amina a bit too much slack sometimes.
::'''Liloa:''' Plus, if you ask me, I think his biggest wish is for Miss Amina to grow up as soon as possible, so he can also retire and spend the rest of his days in the hot springs.
::'''Liloa:''' They're lucky that I'm very patient, and can help them slowly turn all of those outlandish ideas into reality.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Liloa:''' See you.
