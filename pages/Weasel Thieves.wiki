'''Weasel Thieves''', colloquially referred to as ''Mora Weasels'', will appear randomly across the world. They will run away from you once they spot you, burrowing and hiding into a hole.

Once they do this, you can investigate this hideout, causing the Weasel Thief to escape. As it runs, it will drop a stream of 1 [[Mora]].

Travelers must hit this curious animal once you have driven them out of their burrow in order to receive 500, 750, or 1000 [[Mora]]. The amount of Mora corresponds to the type of Weasel Thief, which each have a characteristic glow and a different purse.

==Trivia==
* The fact that they do not drop [[Raw Meat]] may imply that the character only removes their purse when attacking them, leaving the critter to escape.
