{{Lang|'''The Five Kasen'''|ja=五歌仙|ja_rm=Go Kasen|ja_tl=The Five Poetry Immortals}} were gifted singers and poetry writers in ancient Inazuma that took turns annually to present a collection of the group's poems to the [[Raiden Shogun (Disambiguation)|Shogun]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Festive Elegance}}</ref> Their great works would spark cultured discussions which caused Inazuma's culture to blossom and gain great influence at that time. As a sign of the appreciation for the great works of The Five Kasen that enriched the lives of the people of Inazuma, the [[Irodori Festival]] was developed.

==Overview==
Due to the age of the tale of The Five Kasen, tales of their identities and accomplishments are highly varied, and it is believed that much extant information about them was lost during the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago.<ref name="Kasen Summary">{{Ref/Item|Five Kasen Summary}}</ref> During ''[[Hues of the Violet Garden]]'', the version that the party is told was devised by [[Kamisato Ayato]] to guide [[Kaedehara Kazuha]] to the truth regarding the fall of the [[Raiden Gokaden]] and the [[Kaedehara Clan]].

==Members==
The real names of The Five Kasen were lost over time.  However, the legend of The Five Kasen were once repeatedly adapted and performed on stage. Each character was dressed in a distinct color and soon, theatergoers referred to the members by their colors: Green for Suikou, blue for Aoi no Okina, red for Akahito, white for Sumizome, and black for Kuronushi.<ref name="Kasen Summary" />
*{{lang|Suikou|ja=翠光|ja_tl=Green Light}}
*{{lang|Aoi no Okina|ja=葵の翁|ja_tl=Elder of Sunflower}}
*{{lang|Akahito|ja=赤人|ja_tl=Scarlet Man}}
*{{lang|Sumizome|ja=墨染|ja_tl=Ink-Dyed}}
*{{lang|Kuronushi|ja=黒主|ja_tl=Black Lord}}

==Stories==
===Ayato's Version===
The legend of The Five Kasen that Ayato devised is recorded in the ''The Five Kasen's Splendor'' poem series:
*[[The Five Kasen's Splendor: Suikou]]
*[[The Five Kasen's Splendor: Aoi no Okina]]
*[[The Five Kasen's Splendor: Akahito]]
*[[The Five Kasen's Splendor: Sumizome]]

==Trivia==
*During ''Hues of the Violet Garden'', [[Albedo]] paints portraits of The Five Kasen-based primarily on members of the party assembled at Ayato's invitation:
**[[Venti]] is the basis for Suikou.
**[[Xingqiu]] is the basis for Aoi no Okina.
**[[Kaedehara Kazuha]] is the basis for Akahito.
**[[Kamisato Ayaka]] is the basis for Sumizome.
**[[Scaramouche]] is the basis for Kuronushi, although his portrait is only revealed after splashing the painting with water; without it, the portrait was left blank to allow viewers to freely interpret Kuronushi's appearance.
* Venti's [[Constellation]] name, {{lang|[[Carmen Dei]]|zh=歌仙座|zh_rm=Gēxiān-zuò|ja=歌仙座|ja_rm=Kasen-za}}, contains the same characters as {{lang|''kasen''|ja=歌仙|ja_tl=immortal poet}} in-game languages that use Chinese characters.

===Etymology===
*The Five Kasen are likely based on the {{lang|{{w|Rokkasen}}|ja=六歌仙|ja_tl=six poetry immortals}}, six renowned Japanese poets from the mid-ninth century whose works were included in the poetry anthology ''{{w|Kokin Wakashū}}''.
**Kuronushi's name is directly derived from {{w|Ōtomo no Kuronushi}}, one of the poets in the Rokkasen.
**Sumizome is likely analogous to {{w|Ono no Komachi}}, seeing as both are the only women in their respective groups.
**Akahito's name is not derived from one of the Rokkasen, and is instead based on {{w|Yamabe no Akahito}}, who predates the Rokkasen. Akahito and the Rokkasen are all considered part of the {{lang|{{w|Thirty-Six Immortals of Poetry}}|ja=三十六歌仙|ja_rm=Sanjuurokkasen}}.
