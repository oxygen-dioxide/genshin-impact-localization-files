'''The Cat's Tail''', also simply known as '''Cat's Tail''', is a tavern in the [[City of Mondstadt]], [[Mondstadt]]. [[Margaret]] owns the tavern, with [[Diona]] working as one of its bartenders. It is located between [[Katheryne]]'s [[Adventurers' Guild]] Post and [[Good Hunter]]. It is where people in Mondstadt go to play [[Genius Invokation TCG]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Come Try Genius Invokation TCG!}}</ref>

Ever since Diona was hired, business at The Cat's Tail has boomed due to her cute appearance and blessing that makes all of her drinks taste delicious, no matter the ingredients used. In fact, she singlehandedly disrupted the monopoly [[Angel's Share]] once had over Mondstadt, which piqued [[Elzer]]'s interest and got him bitten when he tried to headhunt Diona over to the rival tavern.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Diona}}</ref> In addition to the drinks, the tavern is also known for its cats, which are a popular attraction.

The tavern also specializes in pizza, being [[Jean]]'s favorite when she has the time to order one.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Jean|Favorite Food}}</ref>

After completing the first step in the [[World Quest]] ''[[Come Try Genius Invokation TCG!]]'', the interior can be accessed, and the map icon will appear. The map icon acts as a permanent [[Teleport Waypoint]], and teleporting to The Cat's Tail sends the player to the interior.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|This tavern, owned by [[Margaret]], is located in [[Mondstadt]], and is famed for its cute cats and the impeccable drink-mixing skills of its [[Diona|resident bartender]]. Its atmosphere is perfect for putting one's feet up and enjoying a relaxed afternoon or night, and has thus attracted many guests of such inclinations. For reasons unknown, many [[Genius Invokation TCG]] players have also gathered here... Ah, yes. One more thing. Though the drinks here are indeed very good, you should be careful not to praise that bartender's skills...|[[Map]] description}}

==Trivia==
* The Cat's Tail is mentioned in the description of the Furnishing item "[[Pine Dining Chair]]."
* The map icon can be viewed on the map once zoomed in to display [[Main City]] icons and can be used to directly teleport to The Cat's Tail's interior, in front of [[Prince]].
* The Cat's Tail is one of two instances to possess a map of its interior, the other being the mansions of the [[Serenitea Pot]].
