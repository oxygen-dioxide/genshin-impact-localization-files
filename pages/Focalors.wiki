'''Focalors''' was the [[God]] of Justice and the former [[Hydro Archon]] among [[The Seven]], presiding over [[Fontaine]] as the successor of [[Egeria]]. Prior to her ascension, she was originally one of Egeria's [[Oceanid]] familiars that were turned into human by her hand. Upon her ascension, as part of her plan to save Fontaine from the [[Prophecy of Fontaine|prophecy]], Focalors separated her divinity from her body and spirit to exist separately as Focalors, while the body and spirit she left behind became [[Furina]], embodying her humanity. 

As of {{Quest|Masquerade of the Guilty}}, she was sentenced to death by the [[Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale]] and willingly gave up her full elemental authority to [[Neuvillette]]. This also abolished the Divine Throne of the Hydro Archon altogether, making Focalors the last Hydro Archon. After her death, Furina now continues to live autonomously as an ordinary human.

==Profile==
===Introduction===
{{Quote|My ideals have no stains.<br>I must correct you. People here bear no sins in the eyes of the gods... Only laws and the Tribunal can judge someone.<br>They can judge even me. So praise my magnificence and purity.|Focalors|[[Varunada Lazurite Gemstone]]}}

===Appearance===
Focalors is a fair-skinned woman with {{w|Heterochromia iridum|heterochromic}} eyes, her right eye being light blue and her left eye dark blue. Like Furina, her hair is of a whitish-blue tinge with light blue streaks, and is divided into two parts: a short bell-shaped bob that goes to her neck, and two longer strands of hair that go down to her waist. She also has beaded-like eyelashes just like Furina.

Focalors wears a white dress with puffy long sleeves and gold accents, that fades to a dark shade of blue with starry details towards the hems and ends of her sleeves. The bodice of her dress is dark blue fading to white, with gold accents and trims; the center exposes portions of her chest and stomach, and is fastened by gold and blue metal details. She is barefoot, and wears a gold ankle cuff with a blue jewel on her right ankle that connects to a toe ring. Her fingernails and toenails are painted with light blue nail polish.

===Personality===
As Focalors and Furina are two aspects of a once singular being, their personality and interests are similar. She shares Furina's passion for drama and her fascination with grand displays of human emotion, but does not display Furina's emotionality, as those stem from the humanity that now resides entirely within Furina.

Due to her lack of humanity, Focalors has a rather blunt way of speaking, as seen by her nonchalance when revealing that she cursed Furina or the numerous times she laughed mentioning her upcoming sacrifice. Despite this, she appears to genuinely love her human counterpart, Furina, claiming that being human has always been her biggest dream. After her death, she leaves a last message of thanks to Furina and asks her to live happily as a human, just as Focalors had wished for both of them.

One of the main traits in Focalors is her intelligence. She devised an extremely complex and ingenious plan to deceive the [[Heavenly Principles]], thus destroying the [[Hydro Archon]]'s divine throne, returning the elemental authority to the Hydro Dragon, and saving the people of Fontaine from the Prophecy. According to herself, her intelligence was the reason why Egeria chose her as her successor for the position of the Hydro Archon.

Like Furina, Focalors was also extremely selfless and had a strong sense of justice. She was willing to sacrifice her humanity, her divinity, and herself to ensure that Fontaine's people wouldn't be dissolved by the rising [[Primordial Sea]]. Additionally, she highlighted the hypocrisy of the Heavenly Principles in branding Egeria and the Fontainians with the "Sin" of having used the water of the Primordial Sea without permission, when the Heavenly Principles were guilty of stealing the elemental authority of the [[Seven Sovereigns]]. Her plan undid this "injustice" by returning the stolen Hydro authority to Neuvillette.

In her final moments, a more vulnerable side of her is shown, as she admits that she is afraid of dying, stating that she believes that this is the one thing that both humans and gods have in common.

==Story==
===History===
Egeria, the previous Hydro Archon, was slain during the [[cataclysm]],<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Vibrant Pinion}}</ref> and Focalors was instated in her place as the Hydro Archon sometime afterward. Focalors herself was also an Oceanid transformed into a human by Egeria, who Egeria had chosen to be her successor in the hopes that she would figure out a solution to the prophecy. The Oceanids, including the strongest among them, [[Rhodeia of Loch]], did not recognize Focalors as the new Hydro Archon,<ref name="Life Flows On II">{{Ref/Quest|Life Flows On (II)}}</ref> with [[Idyia]] noting that around the same time as her ascension, the very waters of Fontaine became filled with pain and hatred.<ref name="Idyia">{{Ref/NPC|Idyia}}</ref> This change, in addition to their discovery of what remained of their former god at the [[Harvisptokhm]],<ref name="Pale Fire">{{Ref/Quest|Pale Fire (Quest)}}</ref> led the Oceanids to self-imposed exile from Fontaine, never to return.

After she ascended, Focalors spent a long time on the ocean floor, devising a plan to subvert the prophecy. Eventually, she concluded that she needed to deceive the [[Heavenly Principles]] into thinking the prophecy was happening while actually saving all Fontainians. To this end, Focalors separated her divinity from body and spirit, and named the human body she left behind "Furina." Focalors saw Furina as essentially a human version of herself, calling her exactly the kind of human she wished to be. Focalors placed a curse upon Furina, making her immortal as long as Focalors existed, but also preventing her from pursuing her own happiness. She had Furina deceive the people of Fontaine and the Heavenly Principles, pretending to be the Hydro Archon day in and day out for 500 years. If Furina ever allowed her true identity as an impostor of the Hydro Archon to be revealed, Focalors' plan would fail and the prophecy would doom her people.

Meanwhile, Focalors kept her [[Gnosis]] in her divine half and hid inside the Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale, accumulating Indemnitium in the device. When the time came, she planned to use the accumulated energy to not only kill herself but destroy the Hydro Archon's divine throne, returning the stolen Hydro Authority to the [[Hydro Dragon]]—who, at full power, would be able to exert complete control over the Primordial Sea. To that end, Focalors had a letter sent to Neuvillette, the current incarnation of the Hydro Dragon, inviting him to assume the position of Fontaine's Chief Justice. She hoped that he would come to sympathize with humanity, so that when the time came for Focalors to return Neuvillette's stolen Authority, he would be willing to use his regained powers to turn the people of Fontaine into true humans, saving them from the prophecy.

===Archon Quests===
The current Seven are all briefly mentioned in the {{Quest|Downtown}} while [[Zhongli]] is inspecting the kites that represent them. Of the God of Justice's kite, he says ''"Justice flows across the surface of the waters."''

In the {{Quest|A Toast to Victory}}, Nahida mentions that while Focalors doesn't directly preside over trials, she is still present and has the right to influence the final verdict. Focalors created the [[Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale]], which was designed and meant to help the Iudex, Neuvillette, carry out sentences. 

During [[Lyney]]'s first show at the [[Opera Epiclese]], he went to investigate the Oratrice under the guise of performing a magic trick. While in the room where the Oratrice's core was held, Lyney heard a voice, which caused him to retreat. He confessed this fact to the [[Traveler]] during his trial for murder,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lies Cast Shadows Under Gathered Lights}}</ref> who would later pass on the information to Neuvillette.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|When All Return to the Waters}}</ref> Unbeknownst to any of the parties involved, this voice was Focalors'.

Following [[Tartaglia|Childe]]'s disappearance in the [[Fortress of Meropide]], [[The Knave|Arlecchino]] decided to investigate Furina, eventually running into her by pure chance while she was trying to play with a cat, using the opportunity to attack and try to steal her [[Gnosis]]. She did not find the Gnosis on her, while Furina was left shocked and begged for mercy. Arlecchino felt a "curse" of some sort emanating from her, her genuine fear of death and eccentric behavior unfitting for an Archon. Arlecchino left without threatening any further harm, realizing that she was not the actual Hydro Archon and that the Gnosis was being held somewhere else.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Calamitous Tread}}</ref>

As per the prophecy, Focalors would eventually be put on trial for the "original sin" that the Heavenly Principles had declared on Egeria. The Traveler and Neuvillette would cause this to happen by managing to put Furina on trial in an attempt to make her reveal her secrets so as to avoid the prophecy, ultimately concluding that Furina was not the true Hydro Archon. Now revealing her true identity, Focalors appeared to Neuvillette and admitted to having Furina take her place as the Hydro Archon for the past 500 years in order to successfully deceive the Heavenly Principles. She then explained her plan to end herself at the hands of the Oratrice, thus returning her elemental authority to its rightful owner, Neuvillette, both out of guilt from acquiring his stolen power, and knowing that only him at his full dragonhood and the experiences he had with the people, would be able to save them from the prophecy. Having acquired enough Indemnitium to carry out her sentence, she proceeded to execute herself. Her Gnosis was returned to Neuvillette and with his full Authority restored, he proceeded to absolve Fontanians of their sin, preventing them from dissolving, though any that dissolved prior to her sacrifice would not be returned. This self-sacrifice also destroyed Hydro Archon's divine throne, resulting in six Archons remaining.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* In English voice-overs, her name is pronounced with an approximation of the French pronunciation of the French localization ''Foçalors'' {{Nowrap|(/ˈfoʊsəlɔɹ/,}} {{Nowrap|"FOH-sə-lor")}}, instead of the expected Latin-based reading {{Nowrap|(/ˈfoːkälors/,}} {{Nowrap|"FOH-ka-lors")}} of "Focalors" seen in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean.
* Focalors is depicted wielding an elongated straight sword on Fontaine's [[Statue of The Seven]], alluding to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Justice Lady Justice.]
* Focalors is the second Archon to not use their own [[Furina|human vessel]] as their own body, the first being [[Ei]], who currently lacks a human vessel but can possess [[the Shogun]] to get around.
* Focalors is also called "Mirror-me" by [[Furina]].
===Etymology===
* In ''{{w|The Lesser Key of Solomon}}'', "Focalor" is a Great Duke of Hell and the 41st demon, having thirty legions of demons under his command. According to the grimoire, Focalor has power over the wind and the sea, can cause death by drowning and save those about to perish in a watery grave. His hope was to return to Heaven after a thousand years, but he was deceived.
