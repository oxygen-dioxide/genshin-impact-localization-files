'''Grand Thief''' was a [[Treasure Hoarder]] that exclusively appears in the {{Quest|A Herald Without Adherents}}.

==Profile ==
The Grand Thief's real name is unknown, but it is said that he originates from [[Fontaine]].

He was known to be quite popular amongst [[Treasure Hoarders]]. It is said that sometime after [[Osial]] was defeated, a group of Treasure Hoarders banded together to distract the Abyss Order while sending a single thief, The Grand Thief, to infiltrate and steal any valuables. The statue and the Grand Thief's kneeling corpse would later be discovered by the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Involuntary Sacrifice}}</ref> The Grand Thief can be seen kneeling before the [[Defiled Statue]], deceased due to unknown causes.<ref group="Note">It is heavily implied that the Grand Thief did not die from external injuries, despite their proximity to the Abyss Herald. Therefore, it may only be presumed that they died to overexposure to Abyssal Energy surrounding the area, or alternatively some other force of nature (such as the [[Vedrfolnir|Sinner]], which may explain why the Grand Thief was in a worshiping position, given that the Defiled Statue was tainted by [[Chlothar|Chlothar Alberich]])</ref>

===Appearance===
The Grand Thief resembles [[Li Ding]] although with a lighter hair color.

==Trivia==
*The Grand Thief might be an allusion to {{w|Arsène Lupin}}.
* If the Grand Thief is viewed at from a very specific angle, he can be seen blinking. It is unknown as to if this is an oversight or a deliberate decision.
