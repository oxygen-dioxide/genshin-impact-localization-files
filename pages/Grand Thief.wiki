'''Grand Thief''' was a [[Treasure Hoarder]] that appears in the [[Archon Quest]] [[Call of the Abyss|domain]] located in [[Mt. Aocang]], [[Liyue]].

==Profile==
His real name is unknown, but it is said that he is from [[Fontaine]].

He was known to be quite popular amongst [[Treasure Hoarders]], but later on in [[Chapter I]] Act 4: [[We Will Be Reunited]], the Grand Thief's corpse can be seen kneeling before the [[Defiled Statue]]. Although his cause of death is not confirmed, it is suspected that he was killed by an [[Abyss Herald]].

===Appearance===
The Grand Thief resembles [[Li Ding]] although with a lighter hair color.

==Trivia==
*The Grand Thief's death is the first death that occurs in an Archon Quest and also the first to be witnessed by [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]].
*The Grand Thief might be an allusion to {{w|Arsène Lupin}}.
*However, if looked at from an angle, the Grand Thief can be seen blinking.
