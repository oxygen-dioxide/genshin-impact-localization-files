'''Tourmalines'''<ref>Event: [[Graph Adversarial Technology Experiment Log]] Day 5</ref> can be found in the wild in various areas of [[Teyvat]]. While intact, they deal '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} around themselves every 0.5 seconds. When hit by a {{Pyro}} attack, they will shatter, allowing the player to harvest an {{Item|Electro Crystal|20}}.
