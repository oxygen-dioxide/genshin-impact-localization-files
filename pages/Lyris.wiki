'''Lyris''' was an [[Oceanid]] who lived around 500 years ago and served as the Director of the [[Narzissenkreuz Institute]], an orphanage in [[Fontaine]].<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Ref/Quest|Riddles Awaiting Answers}}</ref> At some point, she became a member of the [[Narzissenkreuz Ordo]], where she gained the title of the "Red Empress."

In the {{Quest|Ann of the Narzissenkreuz}}, she is referred to as "Princess Lyris," based on a fairy tale told to her by [[Mary-Ann Guillotin]], one of the children cared for by her at the Narzissenkreuz Institute.

==Profile==
Lyris was a gentle-natured Oceanid whose position of orphanage director was established in honor of the previous [[Hydro Archon]], [[Egeria]]. In the [[Court of Fontaine]]'s official register of Oceanids, she was noted to be highly affectionate and caring towards the children of the orphanage, but she was also said to be unintelligent compared to other Oceanids, having trouble understanding cause and effect and not knowing how to count.<ref name="SitAS">{{Ref/Quest|Search in the Algae Sea (Quest)}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Lyris was described by Mary-Ann to be "tall" and "pure."<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Heroes' Tea Party}}</ref>

==Story==
Not much is known about Lyris's backstory before she became the Narzissenkreuz Institute's director. In this role, she took in and cared for the children there, often playing games with them. She regarded the vice-director, [[Basil Elton]], as her assistant.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Odyssean Flower}}</ref> However, Basil was the actual manager of the orphanage's affairs.<ref name="SitAS" />

When the [[cataclysm]] occurred 500 years prior to the game's events, Lyris and her fellow Oceanids disappeared. During this period, Basil was killed at sea during her battle against the beast [[Elynas (NPC)|Elynas]], while the Institute's location was destroyed in the calamity, and the organization itself was disbanded in the aftermath. Afterwards, [[Rene]] and [[Jakob]], two children who were formerly cared for by the Institute, established a secret society known as the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, with the goal of creating a gestalt consciousness to absorb the personalities of everyone in Fontaine and thus save them from [[Prophecy of Fontaine|prophesied doom]].

Unlike many other Oceanids, Lyris returned to Fontaine; she was saddened by the loss of the Narzissenkreuz Institute and the destruction caused by the cataclysm, and no longer saw a way forward. She longed to return to the past when she played happily with the Institute's children, and spent her time encircling the [[Annapausis|underwater ruins]] of the orphanage.<ref name="SitAS" /> It was there that she was approached by Rene and Jakob, who convinced Lyris to join the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, despite her reservations.

===The Ordo===
Eventually, Rene and Jakob brought Lyris with them to the [[Tower of Ipsissimus]], and she was given the title of "Red Empress." Her participation was a great benefit to the Ordo, as Rene noted that the original Oceanids could no longer be found in Fontaine, apart from some "[[Tainted Hydro Phantasm|inferior mutants]]." Lyris was given the job of dissolving the egos of the Ordo's members in order to help create the gestalt consciousness. However, Lyris's condition began to deteriorate, meaning urgency was needed for the Ordo's project. In time, Rene opted to become the first subject of his experiment and was absorbed into the gestalt, being reborn as [[Narzissenkreuz]].<ref>{{Ref/Item|Enigmatic Page (IX)}}</ref> Narzissenkreuz went on to absorb numerous other personalities, presumably with Lyris's aid.

While in the Ordo, Lyris once returned to the ruins of the Institute, and was visited there by Mary-Ann Guillotin and her robotic companion [[Seymour]], who had dove into the ruins. Seeing Lyris depressed, Mary-Ann tried to cheer her up by telling her a fairy tale based on the story of the "hero Narzissenkreuz," which [[Alain]] had made them play at the Institute as children.<ref name="Rowboat's Wake">{{Ref/Quest|Rowboat's Wake (Quest)}}</ref> In this story, Lyris played the role of Princess Lyris, who sacrificed her "time" to save her friends and fell into an endless slumber, but made a promise that her friends would carry her "future" for her and one day be able to reunite with her. This was an allegory to convince Lyris that the future was not as hopeless as she believed, as her friends were working to rebuild Fontaine, even making reference to Lyris's work with "Ney" (Rene) and "Jak" (Jakob). However, Lyris was more interested in the story itself, so Mary-Ann came up with the start for a new chapter and suggested that Lyris create the ending for herself, before she returned to the surface.<ref>Interactable: [[Annapausis#Interactables|A Story]]</ref>

Soon, it became clear that the Court of Fontaine did not tolerate Narzissenkreuz's existence. The [[Marechaussee Phantom|Marechaussee Hunters]], led by Alain and Mary-Ann Guillotin, were sent to hunt down Narzissenkreuz and destroy the Ordo; Lyris was also branded a criminal with a high-priority arrest warrant. To buy time for the project, Narzissenkreuz sent Jakob, Lyris, and many other members of the Ordo on a mission to [[Elynas]], effectively using them as bait.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Enigmatic Page (XI)}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Item|Enigmatic Page (XIII)}}</ref> There, they fought with the Marechaussee Hunters, during which Lyris ended up absorbing the personality of Mary-Ann for unknown reasons. After the battle, Mary-Ann was listed as missing in action.<ref name="SitAS" />

The merged consciousness of Lyris and Mary-Ann Guillotin became the Oceanid [["Mary-Ann"]], who constructed the dream world of [["The Real Annapausis"|Annapausis]]. She herself within the fairy tale world to avoid confronting the harsh reality of all that had happened, and wait for everyone else from the Institute to return. As a byproduct of this dream, "Mary-Ann" accidentally created the Oceanid [[Ann]], who possesses the memories of both the real Mary-Ann and Lyris, while acting in the role of the hero that Mary-Ann Guillotin dreamed herself to be in the fairy tale.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Unfinished Story}}</ref>

"Mary-Ann" herself is not certain whether she should be considered as Lyris or as Mary-Ann Guillotin. Narzissenkreuz refers to her more as Lyris, saying that she "just holds onto Mary-Ann, who herself still clings to life."<ref name="Rowboat's Wake" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Waking from the Great Dream (Quest)}}</ref>

==Trivia== 
* It is likely that Lyris, along with the other Oceanids, went to the [[Girdle of the Sands]] in search of [[Egeria]] during the cataclysm. The Oceanids scattered themselves upon learning that Egeria's remains had become what is now the [[Amrita Pool]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Pale Fire (Quest)}}</ref>

===Etymology===
* {{w|List of Oceanids|Lyris}} is the name of one of the Oceanids in Greek mythology.
