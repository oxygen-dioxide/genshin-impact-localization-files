'''Geri''' is an open-world [[NPC]] in [[Liyue Harbor]]. He can be found sitting down at [[Su Er'niang]]'s food stall in [[Chihu Rock]].

He and his older sister,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas: Two Cities' Recommendations}}</ref> [[Freki]] are traveling gourmets from [[Mondstadt]] with plans to taste cuisines from all seven nations. So far, Geri is intimidated by [[Liyue]]'s foreign ingredients.

Following a certain dialogue branch for the first time gives the player three [[Tea Break Pancake]]s.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Geri:''' Hello. As a native of Mondstadt, I must say that Liyue Harbor is quite a nice place, but as for the food...
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Geri:''' My name is Geri. My sister [[Freki]] and I are "bon vivant" travelers in search of  fine cuisine. Our aim is to taste and see all that the seven nations have to offer.
::'''Geri:''' But we never expected to meet such an unprecedented challenge on our very first stop of the trip...
::'''Geri:''' The people of Liyue are so unpleasant.
:{{DIcon}} About food and drink...
::'''Geri:''' I absolutely cannot stand Zhongyuan Chop Suey, it's practically inedible!
::'''Geri:''' Back in Mondstadt, my favorite food is Moon Pie.
::'''Geri:''' It's a pie made with seasonal fruits, pieces of cheese, and chicken. When enjoyed together with a special fruit cocktail, it is most superb.
::'''Geri:''' I hardly suspected that the neighboring Liyue cuisine would differ so greatly from our own. Never in my wildest dreams would I have imagined people that would make food from animal innards.
::'''Geri:''' I still need some time to mentally prepare myself, whew...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} So what are you gonna eat while you're in Liyue?
:::'''Geri:''' Well, luckily my sister and I both know enough about cooking that we won't go hungry...
:::'''Geri:''' ...No, we can't let it come to that! We came on this trip to eat food from all around the world, and that's exactly what we're gonna do!
:::'''Geri:''' Yes, I must force myself to get used to the food here... Okay, full disclosure, we caved and cooked some pancakes this morning. Here, take them off me.
:::'''Geri:''' Come on, Geri, you can do this... One whole portion of chop suey, delicious chop suey...
::;(Obtain {{Item|Tea Break Pancake|20|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} Bon appétit.
::'''Geri:''' May the God of Anemo bless you.
::'''Geri:''' Alas, shall the very first stop already hail the end of our journey across the seven nations?
{{Dialogue End}}

==Event Dialogue==
===Moonlight Merriment===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Geri:''' The Moonchase Festival is here, and with it, the Masterful Chefs tournament. All the Liyue locals are getting fired up about good food again, it seems.
:'''Geri:''' Should I take this chance to try a few more Liyue dishes? Oh, but the food here is just...
{{Dialogue End}}
