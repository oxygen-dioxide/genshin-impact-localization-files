'''Diagrams''' or '''Forging Blueprints''' are similar to [[recipe]]s, but are used for [[forging]]. Once used the player will learn to make the associated gadget.

Diagrams are earned through the [[reputation]] system and were introduced with it. With later updates diagrams also became available through [[quest]]s, [[chest]]s and the [[Frostbearing Tree]]. The diagram's rarity is equal to the forgeable item's rarity.

Like [[recipe]]s and [[instructions]], diagrams follow a clear naming pattern of "Diagram: <Item you will be able to forge>". There are diagrams for some weapons that are excluded from this rule:
* {{Item|Snow-Tombed Starsilver|30|type=Weapon}}: [[Memory of the Entombed City]]
* {{Item|Frostbearer|30|type=Weapon}}: [[Memory of the Frostbearing Tree]]
* {{Item|Amenoma Kageuchi|30|type=Weapon}}: [[Saimon Heirloom Blade Diagram]]
* {{Item|Hakushin Ring|30|type=Weapon}}: [[Mask of Memories]]
