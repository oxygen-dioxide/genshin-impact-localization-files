{{Description|A timepiece worn by the witch who dreamt of burning away all the demons in the world. The years the witch dedicated to the flames flow within.}}
'''Witch's End Time''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Crimson Witch of Flames]].

==Description==
A small vessel containing a high-temperature liquid.<br />It is said to be the molten souls of evil spirits.

A special Hydro timepiece given to the Crimson Witch before calamity struck. Back then she was still a maiden, and had not yet embarked on her journey.<br />One cycle was the time required to finish her study at the [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]].<br />By the time the countdown ended and she returned to her hometown, its [[Rostam|previous owner]] had become a casualty of the crisis.

Her maiden years were over. The Crimson Witch of Flame was born, and with her the era of destruction.<br />The timepiece bore witness to the days of monsters and the pain they caused, until all were burned away.
