'''Activated Starshroom''' is a food item that can be obtained in [[Sumeru]] by applying {{Electro}} to a [[Starshroom]]. They are also a type of [[Tri-Lakshana Creature]].

Activated Starshrooms restore 800 HP to the target character. Like most foods, this can not target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]].

==How to Obtain==
Activated Starshrooms can be obtained by applying {{Electro}} to [[Starshroom]]s found in the overworld of [[Sumeru]]. It will revert to a normal Starshroom if not collected within approximately 10 seconds. Activated Starshrooms cannot be obtained from the Starshrooms in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]].
