'''Damage Bonuses''' are means of increasing damage.

There are three different types of Damage Bonuses:
* Percentage Damage Bonus
* Flat Damage Bonus
* Special Multiplier

==Overview==
The three types of Damage Bonuses affect the [[Damage]] formula as follows:
:<div style="overflow-x:auto"><math>(\text{Base DMG} \times \text{Special Multiplier} + \sum \text{Flat DMG Bonus}) \times (1 + \sum \text{Percentage DMG Bonus}\% - \sum \text{DMG Reduction}\%)</math></div>
where the above excludes [[CRIT]], [[Amplifying Reactions]], [[DEF]], and [[RES]].

===Percentage Damage Bonus===
'''Percentage Damage Bonus''' is the most common type of Damage Bonus. This includes Elemental and Physical Damage Bonuses, which are listed in the in-game attribute [[Character Menu|menu]]. Other types of Percentage Damage Bonuses (Normal/Charged/Plunging Attack, Elemental Skill, Elemental Burst, etc.) are not shown in the menu, but are still considered Percentage Damage Bonuses. Percentage Damage Bonuses from different sources stack additively.

[[Damage Reduction]] is an attribute that directly reduces the Percentage Damage Bonus of incoming attacks. It can be understood as a negative Percentage Damage Bonus. Different sources of Damage Reduction stack additively.

===Flat Damage Bonus===
'''Flat Damage Bonus''' is a fixed amount of bonus DMG from abilities such as [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]]'s [[Nereid's Ascension|Elemental Burst]] and [[Yun Jin]]'s [[Cliffbreaker's Banner]]. Flat Damage Bonuses are added to Base DMG then multiplied by the aforementioned Percentage Damage Bonuses. Different sources of Flat Damage Bonuses stack additively.

===Special Multipliers===
'''Special Multipliers''' are a rare means of damage increase that can be granted by some abilities such as Xingqiu's 4th Constellation [[Evilsoother]] and Yoimiya's Elemental Skill [[Niwabi Fire-Dance]]. Special Multipliers are directly multiplicative with Base DMG.

==Elemental/Physical==
Elemental and Physical DMG Bonuses are Percentage Damage Bonuses visible as [[attributes]] in the stats screen. Only one of the following Elemental / Physical DMG Bonuses will apply at a time depending on the attack's element. For a list of talents and constellations that boost a particular elemental DMG Bonus, see the corresponding subpage.
