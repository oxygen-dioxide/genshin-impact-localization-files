'''Azariq''' is a quest-exclusive NPC that appears in the {{Quest|The Dirge of Bilqis}}.

==Profile==
Azariq is a member of the [[Tanit]] tribe; at some point, he became a trusted subordinate of Matriarch [[Babel]]. Azariq colluded with the [[Fatui]] by helping Babel remove the other Tanit elders without much issue.

After [[Jeht]] desired to find the Eternal Oasis to put her parents to rest, Babel had Azariq assist them in the initial steps to discover it. They then found a large [[Ruin Golem]] in the desert, where Azariq gave instructions on how to power and operate the automaton to reach their destination. At the last destination, Azariq then demanded [[Liloupar]], causing the group to realize he had betrayed them. Azariq and his lackeys were defeated in the ensuing scuffle. In accordance to the tribe rules, Jeht killed him for betraying the tribe and left his body in the automaton as it collapsed.

Upon leaving the automaton, they ran into the other traitor, [[Aderfi]] and discovered that Azariq had plotted further with the Fatui to remove Babel from her position before she realized what he was up to. Liloupar cautioned Jeht to finish their original task first lest the tribe misunderstand her intentions. They then discovered the Eternal Oasis and informed Babel of the news, where she had already suspected him of disloyalty.

===Appearance===
Azariq takes on the appearance of an [[Eremite Stone Enchanter]].
