|description    = A tower-like building made of thick tiles and tough wood that may be found within [[Sumeru]]. Other than withstanding the momentum of an enraged [[Sumpter Beast]]'s charge, it can also block repeated impacts from heavy arrows. A watchtower with small observation ports has been mounted atop it, sacrificing some of the view in exchange to ensure better protection for any troops within. However, the rainforest today is a rather peaceful place, so few people will be stationed in these towers for long.
