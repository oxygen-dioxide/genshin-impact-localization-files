===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing ''[[Masquerade of the Guilty]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Aeife:''' Take a guess &mdash; will [[Neuvillette|Monsieur Neuvillette]] preside over the next trial? Will [[Furina|Lady Furina]] make an appearance?
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about Neuvillette...
::'''Aeife:''' Right! So, he's our Chief Justice, and the one who brought us Melusines to the Court of Fontaine to live.
::'''Aeife:''' He's always very busy with work, and can only preside over some cases, and his subordinates in the [[Maison Ordalie]] handle the rest.
::'''Aeife:''' But no matter how busy he is, he will still greet us when he sees us &mdash; just as he's done for several hundred years now.
:{{DIcon}} Could you tell me about Furina?
::'''Aeife:''' Lady Furina's very lovely, like the soft seafoam reflecting the sunlight.
::'''Aeife:''' But her temper is... Well, she's hard to read. Sometimes, she's like tempestuous waves, and other times, like stagnant water in a deep pool.
::'''Aeife:''' I guess gods have more intense emotions than humans, huh?
:{{DIcon}} I'll be waiting in suspense.
::'''Aeife:''' Yup, that we will!

::'''Aeife:''' But her temper was... Well, she was hard to read. Sometimes, she was like tempestuous waves, and other times, like stagnant water in a deep pool.
::'''Aeife:''' It's been a while since I've seen her though... You know, I've just decided that the next time I see her, I'm going to give her a friendly greeting and my biggest smile!
:{{DIcon}} I'll be waiting in suspense.

::'''Aeife:''' But I don't feel like that anymore.
::'''Aeife:''' Lady Furina seemed very cheerful the last time I saw her. She said she might be able to come to the opera house more often! I do hope she does.
:{{DIcon}} I'll be waiting in suspense.
::'''Aeife:''' Yup, that we will!
