==Description==
A dimly fluorescent greatsword with no sharp edge.<br />
Years ago it was known as the "Beacon of the Nether" by the mountain bandits.<br />
Seeing it meant there was no way back.<br />
The only way was forward, towards the end of one's life.

"Formless, like the rain that cuts through rain. Weightless, like the light that pierces light."<br />
"Untouchable, moving like a snake. Inescapable, as sword's stare and polearm's glance."

The Rainslasher was named out of reverence for its master. Originally it had no name.<br />
The blade's first and final master was a martial nomad who went by the name of [[Guhua]].

It is said that he was an [[adeptus]]. While Guhua lived, bandits dared not act and the wilderness knew a peace like that of the city.<br />
Allegedly, at the end of his journey he ascended in a purple haze and became a star.<ref group="Note">In the Chinese version of this line, it specifies that he ascended at [[Huaguang Stone Forest]]. Furthermore, the term {{Lang|''purple haze''|zh=紫气|zh_rm=zǐqì|zh_tl=purple cloud, purple qi}} has some additional context in Chinese; it is believed to be an auspicious sign and the symbol of a person with profound wisdom and spiritual energy.</ref>

One to whom Guhua had shown kindness founded what is now known as the Guhua School in his honor. But no school is destined to last forever.
