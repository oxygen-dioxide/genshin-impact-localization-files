|description     = Dried fish that has been grilled slowly over a charcoal flame.
|desc_suspicious = Every last droplet of moisture within the fish has been drained away, leaving behind naught but a texture that can only be compared to chewing on timber. One can barely tell the difference between fish and bones here.
|desc_basic      = Fish air-dried overnight have a tinge of the salty sea wind and give off a tantalizing flavor when grilled. Many Inazumans who dwell near the sea know this taste well indeed.
|desc_delicious  = The rich fats ooze out as the fish meets the grill, and with those sizzling sounds, the fish is coated in a burnished golden coat. The meat is firm but delicious, and the mouthfeel is quite delicate. Such is the unsurpassed gift of the seas.
