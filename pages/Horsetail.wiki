==Trivia==
*Despite being found growing naturally only in [[Liyue]] (as of [[Version 2.1]]), Horsetails are mentioned in a possible description of a "Great Fortune" [[Bamboo Slip]] from the [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Subarea)|Grand Narukami Shrine]], implying that they canonically also grow in [[Inazuma]].
