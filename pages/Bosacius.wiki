'''Bosacius''', also called by the title '''Marshal Vritras''', was an [[adeptus]] and the leader of the Five [[Yakshas]], who were recognized as the strongest amongst all the yakshas.<ref name="YTGA">{{Ref/Book|Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti}}</ref>

The {{Quest|The Yaksha's Wish}} allows the [[Traveler]] to unearth his treasures.

==Profile ==
Bosacius was the eldest of all Yakshas with mastery of the power of [[Electro]]. He, along with his fellow Yakshas, were tasked by [[Morax]] to defend Liyue against the demons and evils spawned by the remains of Gods that fell during the [[Archon War]]. Bosacius took this duty in stride, dedicating his life to battle. While many yakshas existed, Bosacius, [[Indarias]], [[Bonanus]], [[Menogias]], and [[Xiao|Alatus]] became known as the "Five Yakshas" because of their formidable strength and power.

At some point, Bosacius grew weary of his never-ending duty, having accumulated a great karmic debt which eroded his sanity and memories, and witnessing the dwindling number of yakshas over the years. Believing Liyue was at peace, and with only himself and Alatus left, Bosacius decided to depart from this world and sealed his treasures in the region of [[Minlin]] and disappeared.<ref name="TYW">{{Ref/Quest|The Yaksha's Wish}}</ref> At some point, Bosacius' karmic debt caused him to lose his sanity, and that was the last time Alatus saw him.

Following his disappearance, Bosacius later re-emerged during the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago. Bloodshed in The Chasm caused by a massive battle between the Millelith and monsters of [[Khaenri'ah]] attracted Bosacius. Despite his insanity, Bosacius fought alongside the [[Millelith]] in defense of Liyue, eventually leading to his death. Because he no longer remembered his own name, and others could not recognize him, legends of the battle at The Chasm referred to him as the "Nameless Yaksha."

===Appearance===
Bosacius was a tall yaksha with a muscular frame and most noticeably, four arms. He did not have upper garments but instead possessed multiple purple tattoos in the shape of thunderclouds with lightning. His forearms and hands were gradually hued dark purple distally from his body, with almost claw-like long nails crowning his fingers. He has short, spiky, slicked backed hair with purple strands and green irises.

Like the other Yakshas he habitually wears a mask in battle, which can also be seen as the [[Thundering Poise]] piece from the [[Vermillion Hereafter]] artifact set in which his lore was featured.

==History==
Bosacius, like the other yakshas, was summoned by the Geo Archon, [[Rex Lapis]], to fight the demons that were spawned from the remains of defeated gods after the Archon War. Among the multitude of yakshas, Bosacius, Bonanus, Indarias, Menogias, and Alatus were acknowledged as the strongest, and Bosacius was their leader due to his strength and seniority.

The yakshas, though strong, were not all able to handle the darkness they faced. Each encounter with evil imbued them with karma, and the accumulation of karmic debt destroyed them. Bonanus, Indarias, and Menogias, along with many other yakshas, died either in battle against the remnants of old gods or as a result of the madness borne from fear or rage brought about by their karmic debt, which caused yakshas to turn upon one another. Bosacius witnessed several of his beloved comrades end each other's lives.

Others grew weary of the constant bloodshed and suffering, and abandoned their duties. Bosacius was among them; he was the second-to-last yaksha to remain, alongside Alatus. Tired of his duties, he eventually chose to depart after seeing that Liyue was finally at peace.<ref name="TYW" /> However, he later succumbed to his karmic debt and went mad, forgetting his own name.

During the cataclysm, hordes of monsters from Khaenri'ah attempted to invade Liyue through The Chasm. Having completely lost his sanity by then, Bosacius had only arrived at the battle because he had been attracted by the bloodshed. He joined the battle, fighting in defense of Liyue alongside the thaumaturge [[Boyang]], Boyang's brother [[Rongzhao]], and the Millelith. Due to his shattered sanity, he frequently mistook the people around him as his Yaksha comrades. Because the threat posed by the monsters was nigh-insurmountable, Bosacius, alongside Boyang, Rongzhao, and other members of the Millelith, devised a plan to change the tide of the fight. By using the [[Fantastic Compass]], a catalyst which had the power to manipulate space, they could trap and seal away the monsters. However, this plan came with a great cost: the catalyst required significant energy from both a mortal and an adeptus to power it, and the trap would seal some of them away along with the monsters. With no other choice, Bosacius and Boyang volunteered to sacrifice themselves for the sake of Liyue.

Sealed along with the monsters, Bosacius, Boyang and the other Millelith soldiers eventually perished. Bosacius and Boyang were the last to perish, and together they wandered around the chaotic space. Before he died, Bosacius became lucid enough to remember his comrades, his duty, and his name.

Although none of the survivors of the battle in The Chasm knew of Bosacius' name, they preserved the memory of his gallant actions during the battle. Bosacius became known as the "Nameless Yaksha" in legends concerning the battle.

Alatus, who took up the name Xiao sometime afterwards, was curious as to Bosacius' fate and believed that he may had been the Nameless Yaksha that had been referred to by those who fought there. Recognizing that searching for the answer could be dangerous (as the powerful Bosacius had not returned), he first sought [[Zhongli]]'s approval to investigate. He travelled to the Chasm and met with the Traveler, [[Paimon]], [[Yelan]], [[Arataki Itto]] and [[Kuki Shinobu]] by coincidence. Upon falling into [[The Chasm's Bed]], Xiao confirmed that the Nameless Yaksha was Bosacius. While exploring a domain, an illusory manifestation of Bosacius fought Xiao but eventually expired after expending its energy.

==Trivia== 
* He wielded [[Calamity Queller]] during the cataclysm. It is unclear whether he was the one who had it forged, or whether he borrowed it.
* In one of Bosacius' memories with the other four Yakshas, Menogias can be seen attempting to convince Bosacius to wear a purple robe. However, the robe only has two arms, posing a problem for the four-armed Bosacius.

===Etymology ===
*In the Chinese version of ''Only Old Memories Remain'', Bosacius gives the meaning of his name, {{zh|浮舍|rm=Fúshě}}, in the last line of the cutscene: {{zh|'''浮'''生一刹，万般皆'''舍'''|rm='''Fú''' shēng yī chà, wànbān jiē '''shě'''|tl=Life is as fleeting as an instant, everything can thus be let go}}.
*Bosacius' English title, Marshal Vritras, is a reference to {{w|Vritra}}, a Vedic serpent and the personification of drought, evil, and chaos.
* Bosacius' Chinese title, {{zh|腾蛇太元帅|rm=Téngshé Dàyuánshuài|lit=Generalissimo Soaring Snake}}, is a two-part reference:
**{{zh|腾蛇|rm=Téngshé|lit=Soaring Snake}} refers to the {{Lang|{{w|Teng (mythology)|Téngshé}}|zh=腾蛇}}, a flying dragon (or serpent) in Chinese mythology.
**{{zh|太元帅|rm=Dàyuánshuài|tl=Generalissimo|lit=Great Marshal}} is the title held by the yaksha {{Lang|{{w|Āṭavaka}}|zh=大元帅明王|rm=Dàyuánshuài Míngwáng|lit=Generalissimo Wisdom King}}, who is often depicted with one head and four arms and encircled by {{w|nāga}}s on his arms and legs.
***{{w|Generalissimo}} is the highest military rank, above Field Marshal, and is assigned to military officers who lead an entire state's military, subordinate only to the sovereign.
