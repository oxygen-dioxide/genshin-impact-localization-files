{{Quest Description|On account of your contributions to [[Mondstadt]], you have been chosen as this year's Windblume Star. As such, you will be making a Windblume offering to the Anemo Archon, [[Barbatos]], on behalf of the whole of Mondstadt. That said, what on earth is a Windblume?}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Jean)
:{{A|vo eqfh004 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Jean!
:{{A|vo eqfh004 1 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Traveler! Ah &mdash; excuse me. I should address you as Honorary Knight under the circumstances.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 1 qin 02.ogg}} '''Jean:''' I suppose you heard? You're this year's Windblume Star. You will be making an offering of Windblumes to the Anemo Archon, Barbatos, on behalf of the whole of Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 1 qin 03.ogg}} '''Jean:''' ...Although... things will be a little different this time.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* ...Yeah... But with us and the Tone-Deaf Bard here, this year's Windblume Festival is sure to be bigger than ever!
:{{A|vo eqfh004 1 qin 04.ogg}} '''Jean:''' That is true... Thank you for taking up residence in Mondstadt, and I hope you continue to enjoy Mondstadt life.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 1 qin 05.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Oh! The Windblume Ceremony is about to begin. Windblume Star, have you chosen your Windblume?
:{{A|vo eqfh004 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So we choose one type of flower, then offer it to the Anemo Archon, right?
:{{A|vo eqfh004 1 qin 06.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Exactly right. Please consider your choice carefully. Remember, you are representing the whole of Mondstadt.
:{{DIcon}} Venti, what kind of flower do you like?
:{{A|vo eqfh004 1 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Eh? ...Very cunning, trying to cheat, are we?
:{{A|vo eqfh004 1 qin 07.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Ahem...
:{{A|vo eqfh004 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Don't you two go spilling secrets during an occasion like this!
:{{A|vo eqfh004 1 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Haha, they told us!
:{{A|vo eqfh004 1 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Don't worry about me, choose something you like! I trust your tastes.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 1 qin 08.ogg}} '''Jean:''' So, Honorary Knight, what is your choice?
:{{DIcon}} [[Dandelion Seed|Dandelion]]
::{{A|vo eqfh004 1 paimon 05a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahhh... throwing your weight behind one of the people's favorites! Windblumes must be Dandelions after all!
:{{DIcon}} [[Windwheel Aster]]
::{{A|vo eqfh004 1 paimon 05b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahhh... throwing your weight behind one of the people's favorites! Windblumes must be Windwheel Asters after all!
:{{DIcon}} [[Cecilia]]
::{{A|vo eqfh004 1 paimon 05c.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Same idea as Beatrice, Cecilias for Windblumes. Pretty niche, but not without advocates!
:{{DIcon}} [[Small Lamp Grass]]
::{{A|vo eqfh004 1 paimon 05d.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Same idea as Nimrod, Small Lamp Grass for Windblumes... A flower to light  up the dark!
:{{DIcon}} [[Sweet Flower]]
::{{A|vo eqfh004 1 paimon 05e.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Same idea as Sucrose, Sweet Flowers for Windblumes. A flower that has lasted through the ages!
:{{DIcon}} [[Wolfhook]]
::{{A|vo eqfh004 1 paimon 05f.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Same idea as Razor, Wolfhooks for Windblumes. Spiky and tingly!
:{{A|vo eqfh004 1 qin 09.ogg}} '''Jean:''' On behalf of the people of Mondstadt, please offer your Windblume to the statue.

;(Talk to Jean before offering the Windblume)
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh004 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Follow your instinct, choose whichever Windblume you see fit.

;(Talk to Venti before offering the Windblume)
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh004 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' What will the Windblume be this year? I can't wait to find out!

;(Talk to Jean)
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh004 qin 02.ogg}} '''Jean:''' May the wind carry our blessings and praise.

;(Examine {Windblume}, except Wolfhook)
:'''Examine {Windblume}:''' (The {Windblume} on the altar sways gently in the breeze...)

;(Examine Wolfhook)
:'''Examine Wolfhook:''' (The breeze comes, but the Wolfhook on the altar doesn't move at all... what a tough customer!)

----
;(Talk to Venti after offering the Windblume)
:{{A|vo eqfh004 1 qin 10.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Thank you, Windblume Star, for your sincere Windblume offering to the Anemo Archon, Barbatos. May the wind protect Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 2 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Huh, interesting choice.
:{{DIcon}} You like it?
:{{A|vo eqfh004 2 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hehe, take a guess...
:{{A|vo eqfh004 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Typical Tone-Deaf Bard, stop making people guess all the time!
:{{A|vo eqfh004 2 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Ahahahaha! Okay, okay, I'll tell you. But not here though.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 2 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Not a good idea with so many people in the plaza... Change of surroundings needed.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Where should we go?
:{{A|vo eqfh004 2 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I want you to come with me to [[Stormterror's Lair]].
----
;(Upon arriving at Stormterror's Lair)
:{{A|vo eqfh004 3 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' It's been a while since I've come here, and... things have gotten a little out of order.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 3 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Traveler, shall we clear the area up a bit? Let's call it our Windblume gift to Dvalin.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, good point... doesn't Dvalin wanna take part in the Windblume Festival too?
:{{A|vo eqfh004 3 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' He's not here, but I sense he'll be back soon.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 3 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' ...Right, I'll let you handle that area, I'll take another. Let's meet up top when we're done.
----
;(After clearing the enemies at the location)
:{{A|vo eqfh004 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The wind here is in chaos!
:{{A|vo eqfh004 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We need to find a way to restore the wind's direction.
;(Upon failing the puzzle for the first time)
:{{A|vo eqfh004 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... Something's wrong...
;(Upon failing the puzzle for the third time)
:{{A|vo eqfh004 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why not try a different order?
;(Upon failing the puzzle for the fifth time)
:{{A|vo eqfh004 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... These wind currents seem to appear according to a set pattern, maybe we need to check the order.
;(After completing the puzzle)
:{{A|vo eqfh004 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, that should do it. Let's go find our Tone-Deaf Bard!
----
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Ah... now this is a view
:{{DIcon}} The scenery is beautiful.
:{{DIcon}} It's a pleasant atmosphere.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Isn't it? I am fond of this place. Sometimes, when I've got nothing else to do, I come here just to sit and gaze a while.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You mean sit and laze around?
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hahaha, guilty as charged!
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' ...It's so beautiful... if only we had some cider in hand.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' So, Traveler. Mondstadt Windblume festival. Do you like it?
:{{DIcon}} It's full of love and cheer.
:{{DIcon}} It's great to be with everyone.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' And yet, you still have something you wish to ask, do you not?
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 07.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I know your question. What are Windblumes, exactly? And what do Windblumes and the Windblume Festival mean to Barbatos, the Anemo Archon?
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 08.ogg}} '''Venti:''' As you've seen, the people of Mondstadt each make their own choice. Out of the millions of flowers there are, some choose the dandelion, others choose the Windwheel Aster.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... it does seem like "Windblume" means something unique to each person.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 09.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Correct, and long may that be the case. There is no single and answer and no true Windblumes in existence.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So Windblumes... don't really exist?
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 10.ogg}} '''Venti:''' The word "Windblume" dates from the age of Old Mondstadt. It was a code word that the people used to stay in contact and mount resistance in secret.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 11.ogg}} '''Venti:''' At that time, people often said that the stronger the wind blows, the firmer the roots of the Windblume grow, and the brighter the flower that bursts into bloom.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 12.ogg}} '''Venti:''' If you want my perspective, Windblumes don't exist. Yet they are all around us nonetheless.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 13.ogg}} '''Venti:''' They are the spirit of yearning for freedom, the courage to follow the wind wherever it may lead... All objects are beautiful and worthy of blessing... All can be Windblumes.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You can't see them, but you can feel there presence everywhere... just like the wind!
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 14.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Haha, well said.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 15.ogg}} '''Venti:''' So what are Windblumes? Something that the Anemo Archon Barbatos will not define.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 16.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Flowers of blessings, flowers of respect, flowers of love. Every individual has their own Windblumes and every individual has the right to define them.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess it's no surprise that the type of flower given by the City of Freedom to it's deity is in itself an expression of freedom.
:{{DIcon}} I enjoy the feeling of freedom, too.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 17.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I know.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 18.ogg}} '''Venti:''' It is people's shared will that brings them onto the same page. And surely, it is the wind of freedom that brought us together.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 19.ogg}} '''Venti:''' It comes from the end of the journey, the edge of the world, the depths of our heart. It is ceaseless.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 20.ogg}} '''Venti:'''
::"Who was it that stroked your bloodied, determined visage
::By stream flowing small
::By boulder standing large"
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 21.ogg}} '''Venti:'''
::"Who was it that embraced your weary yet noble soul
::In dreams deep
::In skies soaring"
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 22.ogg}} '''Venti:'''
::"Dear friend
::I am leading you by the hand
::Into the night where lanterns shine bright"
:{{A|vo eqfh004 4 venti 23.ogg}} '''Venti:'''
::To tell you a tale of freedom and dreams
::The tale of where this festival begins"
----
;(A cinematic begins)
:'''Venti:''' The Windblume Festival originated in the "Crown of the North, the City of Freedom"
;(Transition to Bennett and Razor walking towards Mondstadt)
:'''Bennett:''' We gotta bring enough supplies this time, otherwise you'll go hungry again!
:;(Razor nods)
;(Transition to Jean and Lisa walking past With Wind Comes Glory)
:'''Venti (voice-over):''' So, if you're asking me...
:'''Marjorie:''' On official business? We're grateful to you
:'''Jean:''' As are we to you
:'''Lisa:''' Funny, we haven't gotten together for a meal in a while
:'''Jean:''' It's been so busy lately...
;(Transition to Sucrose and Timaeus studying the Tetratanic Sweet Flower as Albedo approaches)
:'''Venti (voice-over):''' What should we do, on this day?
:'''Sucrose:''' Mr. Albedo!
:'''Albedo:''' How is the research going?
:'''Sucrose:''' We've had a few issues...
:'''Timaeus:''' Have a look a this. Now, we think...
;(Transition to Rosaria, Kaeya, and Diluc at the Angel's Share)
:'''Kaeya:''' Of course, any good tavern offers bar snacks
:'''Rosaria:''' Really?
:;(Kaeya reaches out for the bottle of wine and Diluc nonchalantly takes it away; Rosaria and Kaeya become upset)
;(Transition to Barbara holding a picture of her and Jean in the Cathedral)
:'''Venti (voice-over):''' How should we do it? Who should we do it for?
:'''Venti (voice-over):''' Quietly? Or boldly?
;(Transition to Noelle carrying a crate, with Amber gliding around the Cathedral)
:'''Venti (voice-over):''' Make the first move? Or trust to chance?
:'''Amber:''' Aaaah... Look out!
:'''Amber:''' Sorry, so sorry!
:'''Venti (voice-over):''' My answer is this:
:'''Venti:''' So long as we can both share fond memories, it doesn't matter
:'''Venti:''' Let the heart decide
:;(Dvalin flies overhead)
----
;(Talk to Venti)
:{{A|vo eqfh004 5 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Haha, I guess Dvalin found the gift we prepared for him.
:{{A|vo eqfh004 5 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' A fresh breeze and a comfortable environment, he'll love it.
