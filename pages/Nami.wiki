===Personality===
''(To be added.)''

===Appearance===
Nami wears the Watatsumi Army's standard uniform, modeled from the {{Lang|''ashigaru''|ja=足軽}} of feudal Japan. His clothing consists of a light red-white gradient ''shitagi'' with a red-violet colored left sleeve, gray ''kobakama'', and ''waraji'' sandals without the socks. Although not visible, the [[Sangonomiya Clan]]'s crest is imprinted on the back of the ''shitagi'', below the neck. Additional features on the uniform's design such as breastplates and helmets are not present, compared to Shogun's Army uniforms, but were still equipped with ''sode'' (shoulder armor), ''han-kote'' (half-armored sleeves), ''haidate'' (thigh guards), and ''sune-ate'' (greaves) armor, whose colors were red and black with gold accents. The right shoulder guard has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest imprinted on it. Nami is equipped with a ''juumonji yari'', whose shaft is colored with a red-white gradient and has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest under the spearhead.

{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Nami''': This is an important sea route. There are tons of ships passing in and out, so I have to be vigilant in standing guard...
:{{DIcon}} You seem pretty anxious.
::'''Nami''': Uh... Ahaha, is it really that obvious...
::'''Nami''': Actually, I've always been the nervous sort. Maybe it's because I've always had sharp eyes. The more you can see, the more pressure you feel, you know?
::'''Nami''': I can see a long way out from here. The last time I looked out from here to the sea, I saw an outlander vessel with people on it dressed all fancy. They had masks, too.
::'''Nami''': ...Were they the [[Fatui]]? I have to be more careful. We can't let them reach the shore willy-nilly.
::{{DIcon}} That's definitely something worth looking out for.
:::'''Nami''': See? I knew I was right.
:::'''Nami''': I've been more strict with people coming in and out from the harbor recently as well. We don't just need to stop Shogunate operatives from getting in, but we need to guard against smuggling and stowaways as well.
:::'''Nami''': Harbors are transport hubs, after all. Can't ever be too careful.
::{{DIcon}} You should really relax a bit.
:::'''Nami''': I've been trying, you know? I've tried all sorts of methods that a friend recommended to me, like bathing under a waterfall, jogging at midnight... and things like that.
:::'''Nami''': But I don't feel like any of these measures have worked. I've asked that friend before, and he just says that I need to "bear with it for a while," and that I'll be fine once I "surpass my limits."
:::'''Nami''': What does that even mean?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye, then.
::'''Nami''': Yeah, I need to get back to my work as well.
