{{Lang|'''Ghostly March'''|zh=幽幽大行军|zh_rm=Yōuyōu Dàxíngjūn|zh_tl=Ghost-Ghost Great March}} is a [[Special Dish]] that the player has a chance to obtain by cooking [[Vegetarian Abalone]] with [[Hu Tao]]. The [[recipe]] for Vegetarian Abalone is obtainable from [[Verr Goldet]] for 2,500 [[Mora]].

Ghostly March revives a character and restores '''15'''% of Max HP, then restores an additional '''550''' HP to the target fallen character with a 120-second cooldown. Like most foods, this can not target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]].

==Notes==
* Hu Tao's passive talent, [[The More the Merrier]], can also activate when successfully creating Ghostly March, producing a Suspicious-quality Vegetarian Abalone.

==Trivia==
* {{Mail Attachments by Category List}}
* To celebrate Hu Tao's birthday, the [[Teyvat Food Notes]] released a [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/16399 real-life recipe] for Ghostly March and [[Vegetarian Abalone]].

===Etymology===
* This dish is perhaps a word play on the {{Lang|''bailing'' mushroom|zh=白灵菇|zh_rm=báilíng-gū|zh_tl=''Pleurotus eryngii var. tuoliensis''}}, which literally means the "white spirit mushroom," as a white ghost is seen in the image of the food.
** It is a variety of the {{w|Pleurotus eryngii|king oyster mushroom}}. In China, the ''bailing'' mushroom is a popular ingredient for mock abalone, although it is more expensive than the king oyster mushroom. The official recipe by miHoYo uses the king oyster mushroom but it also says the ''bailing'' mushroom is the best option if available.
* Although a part of the Chinese name of this dish "ghost-ghost" is used as a diminutive form of "ghost" here, it can also mean "profound" or "unfathomable" in Chinese. The last sentence of the description "Actually, what on earth is this stuff, anyway?" may be a word play on this point.
