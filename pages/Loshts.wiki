{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the crowd around Loshts)
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Everything's so busy here! Did we arrive in time for some special event?
:'''Paimon:''' Hurry up, {{Traveler}}, let's go check it out!

;(Talk to Loshts)
:'''Paimon:''' Hello there! Um...
:'''Loshts:''' Such overwhelming "intensity"! As expected of the legendary {{Traveler}} and Paimon! You've come all this way &mdash; don't tell me you're here to compete for the title of the "strongest in the Collective of Plenty"?
:'''Paimon:''' "Strongest in the Collective of Plenty"? Isn't this just the regular "[[Warrior's Challenge]]"? Look, there's a whole line of people waiting over there!
:'''Loshts:''' Haha, they're nothing compared to you two. To claim the title of "strongest," you must defeat the current "strongest." Ordinary people don't even qualify for that.
:'''Loshts:''' So, it is good that you are here... though your timing is less stellar, I fear. [[Ma'chah|The master]] presently has no time to deal with worldly affairs, so a face-to-face meeting is not on the cards for now.
:{{DIcon}} Where is he, anyway?
::'''Loshts:''' Oh? Are you planning to seek the master out for a battle? A bold move! In that case, I wouldn't mind sharing his whereabouts with you.
::'''Loshts:''' Journey along training's rugged path, and you'll come across a mountainous region brimming with the "Waters of Intensity." There, perhaps, you'll find traces of the "strongest."
:{{DIcon}} Alright, then we'll wait for him to return.
::'''Loshts:''' Indeed, indeed. "Intensity" draws "intensity," and the "strongest" will surely cross paths with the "strongest." So yes, waiting is certainly one option.

;(Talk to Loshts again)
:'''Loshts:''' How goes your journey to find the "strongest," oh warrior from faraway lands?
:{{DIcon}} Tell me where the "strongest" is located...
::'''Loshts:''' If you head up the mountain, you'll come across a region brimming with the "Waters of Intensity." There, perhaps, you'll find traces of the "strongest"...
:{{DIcon}} Still working on it...
::'''Loshts:''' Ah yes, that would be lovely! Lovely!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
Available after completing ''Is "Intensity" Really the Key?''.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Loshts:''' Such incredible "intensity"... It's thrilling! Absolutely thrilling!
:{{DIcon}} Are you talking about me?
::'''Loshts:''' Precisely, precisely! So, what do you say? Want to give the "Warrior's Challenge" a shot? Just sign up with the master. I've got high hopes for you!
::{{DIcon}} I'll head over soon!
:::'''Loshts:''' Lovely, lovely! Ah, I can hardly wait to see your legendary skills in action!
::{{DIcon}} Let me think about it...
:::'''Loshts:''' Ah, a shame, a shame indeed... I suppose I won't get to witness you in action after all.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry for disturbing you.
::'''Loshts:''' Go well, go well.
