'''Bija''' is a [[Quest Item]] obtained during the {{Quest|"Hello," "Thank You," and the Final "Goodbye"}}. 

It is a fruit of condensed memories that can be used to "realize dreams, so long as these dreams are meant to help others." The mechanism is similar to how memories can be consumed to perform [[Mystic Arts in Teyvat#Ararakalari|Ararakalari]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Festival Utsava}}</ref>

A Bija can be formed by feeding [[Vasoma Fruit]] to the [[Ashvattha Tree]]. According to [[Arama]], [[Festival Utsava]] is also necessary for the Bija to be "healthy, strong, and filled with energy."<ref name="WOA">{{Ref/Quest|The World of Aranara}}</ref> If the Ashvattha Tree is not healthy or particularly young, more energy may be required. To make the Bija for [[Rana]], three Vasoma Fruits and a large portion of [[Arana]]'s memories were used.

==Trivia==
* According to [[Araja]], the last time a Bija was produced was when [[Traveler's Sibling|Nara Varuna]] was still in [[Vanarana (Subarea)|Vanarana]] (i.e., around the time of the [[Cataclysm]]).<ref name="WOA" />
