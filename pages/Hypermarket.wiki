{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Hypermarket:''' Hello. you look like a traveler to me. Need to stock up on any essentials?
:'''Hypermarket:''' We've got everything you could possibly think of in here, and more.
:{{DIcon}} Do you sell artifacts?
::'''Hypermarket:''' ...Ah, everything except those.
::'''Hypermarket:''' Those you'd find in a museum or Cathedral... Hardly what you'd call 'essentials', no?
::{{DIcon}} So much for 'everything I could possibly think of.'
::'''Hypermarket:''' B&mdash;But... I said 'essentials'! If you class those as essential then I'm not sure what to say...
::'''Hypermarket:''' Anyway, I sell things that by most people's definition would fall under 'travel essentials.'
::'''Hypermarket:''' You've piqued my curiosity though. What exactly does your journey entail?
::{{DIcon|Reward}} As I thought, your branding is a sham...
:::'''Hypermarket:''' T&mdash;This... I can't lose my branding just because of you...
:::'''Hypermarket:''' Wait! Do you need food? It doesn't matter who you are, surely you have some needs!
:::'''Hypermarket:''' This... This was food that I brought with me. There's only one of it, and it's free, so please, just leave me alone...
::;(Obtain [[Matsutake Meat Rolls]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} Do you sell legendary weaponry?
::'''Hypermarket:''' ...Ah, everything except that.
::'''Hypermarket:''' Many travelers carry a run-of-the-mill sword or dagger on them, but not legendary weaponry... Are you sure you're just a regular traveler?
::{{DIcon}} So much for 'everything I could possibly think of.'
::'''Hypermarket:''' B&mdash;But... I said 'essentials'! If you class those as essential then I'm not sure what to say...
::'''Hypermarket:''' Anyway, I sell things that by most people's definition would fall under 'travel essentials.'
::'''Hypermarket:''' You've piqued my curiosity though. What exactly does your journey entail?
:{{DIcon}} Do you sell poison?
::'''Hypermarket:''' ...Ah, everything except that. I don't dare...
::'''Hypermarket:''' That would never fly with the Millelith &mdash; or what, did you have some contacts you were planning on hooking me up with? Not just anyone can sell that stuff, you know...
::{{DIcon}} So much for 'everything I could possibly think of.'
::'''Hypermarket:''' B&mdash;But... I said 'essentials'! If you class those as essential then I'm not sure what to say...
::'''Hypermarket:''' Anyway, I sell things that by most people's definition would fall under 'travel essentials.'
::'''Hypermarket:''' You've piqued my curiosity though. What exactly does your journey entail?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Hypermarket:''' Come again soon! Remember, we stock everything you could possibly think of &mdash; and more!
