==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Anchieta:''' Hello there. Want to try playing an instrument?
:{{DIcon}} You're...
::'''Anchieta:''' The boss of [[Djembe Studios]], at your service. I sell some old instruments.
::'''Anchieta:''' Quite a few tourists who watch musical performances at [[Colomche Plaza]] come here to buy some &mdash; for my part, I always get them to try things out first, then come back the next day.
::'''Anchieta:''' Many youngsters get caught up in the heat of the moment, buy an instrument, then wind up never playing it.
::'''Anchieta:''' All the ones sold here hold some sentimental value to me, so I'd rather they not lie abandoned in someone's house.
::'''Anchieta:''' As such, I prefer to give customers a chance to cool down and come back later. There's time aplenty, after all.
::'''Anchieta:''' This store isn't going anywhere, and there's nothing wrong with just enjoying music.
:{{DIcon}} When you say "old fogeys"...
::'''Anchieta:''' Ah, heard that, did you? Sorry about that. I was just talking about some old friends from the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]].
::'''Anchieta:''' I'm often invited to perform and sing at some of their tribe's events when music or song accompaniment is required...
::'''Anchieta:''' ...But those louts never show up to watch, even when I make the long, long trip over to where they are.
::'''Anchieta:''' *sigh* Forget it. Those old geezers are just like that.
::'''Anchieta:''' Unless I write them a letter myself, there's no getting them to move &mdash; and I ain't doing that!
:{{DIcon}} I'm fine for now.
::'''Anchieta:''' Alright. See you then.
