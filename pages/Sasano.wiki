==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Sasano:''' Ah, for her sake, should I...
:{{DIcon}} You seem to be troubled by something...
::'''Sasano:''' My outlander friend, have you ever experienced this before? Feeling like your whole world has become brighter after meeting someone?
::'''Sasano:''' Ah... Sorry. That must sound a little bit cringey...
::'''Sasano:''' But this is how I really feel.
::'''Sasano:''' After I met her, I even wanted to leave my hometown and follow her to the unknown beyond...
::{{DIcon}} "Her"?
:::'''Sasano:''' Yeah, this girl is from [[Liyue]], someone I had a fated encounter with not long ago.
:::'''Sasano:''' She's cheerful, clever, and carefree. She is completely different from me, someone who has spent his entire life in Inazuma. When I was with her, I felt like my whole world was becoming different.
:;(Before completing Transient Dreams)
:::'''Sasano:''' I often wonder if I should leave Inazuma with her and set out on a journey that I have never imagined before...
:::'''Sasano:''' But I'm supposed to be the successor of my family business. It's going to be very hard for me to give up on my duties and just leave...
:::'''Sasano:''' Ah, what should I do...
:;(After completing Transient Dreams)
:::'''Sasano:''' Someday, she'll set out on a new adventure, and then... Should I follow her lead and take a step ahead too?
:::'''Sasano:''' Living in Inazuma and continuing the family business is my safest bet, but I know in my heart that I'd regret it if I let her go...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Sasano:''' Goodbye... I should really put more thought into this...

;(Talk to Sasano or Tingting after completing [[The Strange Tale of Suikou's Tipsy Tincture (Quest)|The Strange Tale of Suikou's Tipsy Tincture]])
:'''Tingting:''' Have you finished reading the fan novel that we bought together?
:'''Sasano:''' Yup, more or less...
:'''Tingting:''' Wasn't it great? I loved the ending, the way in which the female lead chose to stride towards her new life, convictions in hand!
:'''Sasano:''' You know, although the plotline at the start was very exciting, I remember that this wasn't the original ending...
:'''Tingting:''' *sigh* I guess that's the freedom of fan works for you.
:'''Tingting:''' Getting to see all sorts of characters' stories in fan works is exactly their charm.
:'''Sasano:''' ...That's true, that's true. You've got a point there...
:'''Sasano:''' Also, I've heard that a new picture book's come out over there. Wanna go have a look?
