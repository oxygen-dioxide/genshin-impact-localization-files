==Manage Shop==
You need to secure funds and then complete [[Favonian Goodies]] to start managing the shop.
Managing shop has two phases: Charity Stall (a total of 10 Customer Flow Cycles) and Charity Alliance (available until you reach the earnings target).
You can manage up to three different shops, the first and default of which is Snack Store, second is General Goods, and third is Flower Shop. They get unlocked at the beginning of Charity Alliance stage.
===Usable Funds===
The three "directions" of the stores are: Product Quality, Business Efficiency, Holistic Service. You can allocate Usable Funds to them. Once you confirm allocation, the Usable Funds get consumed and the "directions" get upgraded for this Customer Flow Cycle. When you reach all three target points, you get a medal next to the store name. In the beginning of the first Customer Flow Cycle, you get 2000 of them. The amount you get later depends on the Store performance.
When running three shops, the "directions" of the shops are independent from each other.

===Strategic Inspiration===
This currency can be earned by completing certain milestones (100 each): earning 40000, 60000, 140000, 240000, 300000 and 480000 in Business Earnings. You also get 100 when you complete the following Emergencies: Plan and Practice, The Soggy Goods, Floral Composition. You can use them to unlock Shop Stratagem slots (up to 3 per shop, 100 each).

===Shop Assistants===
You can hire your friends as shop assistants, or be hired yourself. Hired assistant can get a certain amount of earnings (1000) as a reward, but only up to 10 times (automatically added to your earnings). You can choose the bonus you will provide to your friends between increasing one of Holistic Service, Product Quality or Business Efficiency by 30%. Once unlocked, you can choose between random friends.
Note: you have to wait two Customer Flow Cycles between hiring any new assistants in any store.

===Emergencies===
Emergencies happen between the Customer Flow Cycles in a form of a dialogue, and award you with Shop Stratagems for dealing with them, as well as some earnings. You need to choose the right store (indicated by a speech bubble) to start the emergency.
====Plan and Practice====
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Bernhard:''' Honorary Knight, Paimon, you've been running the shop for a while.
:'''Bernhard:''' The current operation method of the store refers to the previous business activities, which is fine, but may not be applicable in all cases.
:'''Bernhard:''' You are well informed and can think about your unique "business style" based on your experience with other business people.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh! Is this what Bernhard meant earlier when he mentioned "Shop Stratagems"?
:{{DIcon}} We actually have quite a few ideas.
:{{DIcon}} It's time to put them into practice.
:'''Bernhard:''' Okay! Then do whatever you feel is best, and I will do my best to carry out your orders!
:'''Bernhard:''' At the same time, I will also help collect the experience of other businessmen and provide it to you.
:'''Bernhard:''' I hope these notes will inspire you and give you new ideas!
{{Dialogue End}}
====Assessment Time!====
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Bernhard:''' Honorary Knight and Paimon, the "owner's assessment" is here. Please cooperate with me!
:{{DIcon}} Owner's assessment?
:'''Paimon:''' Sounds a bit like a legal examination. Are we supposed to fill out a... super-complicated answer sheet?
:'''Bernhard:''' No no no. No need to be so formal. I just need your verbal answers!
:'''Bernhard:''' Our store was in a special situation, and Leah was supposed to be inspecting me, but I already knew the entire safety manual by heart.
:'''Bernhard:''' You two are in charge now, so Leah asked me to check you out on her behalf.
:'''Bernhard:''' All you have to do is answer two questions and prove that you are safety-aware. I believe in you guys!
:'''Bernhard:''' You can also get a reward if you answer correctly.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon was really nervous about the test just now! Well, now it sounds pretty simple.
:{{DIcon}} Let's do this.
:'''Bernhard:''' Alright. First question.
:'''Bernhard:''' "If a known alcoholic suddenly shows up in front of your shop intoxicated, what do you do?"
:{{DIcon}} What was he drinking?
:{{DIcon}} We'll be selling it too!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! That's definitely wrong!
:'''Bernhard:''' Well... the correct answer is "call the Knights of Favonius for support to prevent the other party from getting into a drunken accident"...
:'''Bernhard:''' Still, according to the Honorary Knight's thinking, if it can fuddle even an alcoholic like that, it must be no ordinary drink.
:'''Bernhard:''' Its stock is bound to be limited. If we join in, we can cut down on inventory in other stores.
:'''Bernhard:''' Plus, there's another place on the market that sells it. It reduces the likelihood that drinkers will drink too much in one store.
:'''Bernhard:''' Amazing! Thinking longer-term is indeed something more fitting for the Honorary Knight!
:'''Paimon:''' Bernhard... This logic is so complicated... You don't have to work so hard to bail {{Traveler}} out...
:'''Bernhard:''' Alright, so next question...
:'''Bernhard:''' "Items for sale are often boxed up and stacked, posing a fire hazard. As a shopkeeper, what measures would you take to prevent fire hazards?"
:{{DIcon}} Put a Cryo Slime in one of the boxes...
:{{DIcon}} Put a Cryo Slime in each of the boxes...
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Be serious!
:'''Bernhard:''' Wait, I never thought about that before!
:'''Bernhard:''' The way goods are stacked for sale is a problem that every shopkeeper faces.
:'''Bernhard:''' Normally, a good answer would be along the lines that "it is very dangerous to concentrate a large number of wooden boxes together, and they should be stacked separately with proper ventilation in mind."
:'''Bernhard:''' But that would make it cumbersome to pick up the goods, and it would be too much of a problem for understaffed stores.
:'''Bernhard:''' Only those who are very strong can employ the Honorary Knight's method. But by ensuring the fire resistance of wooden cases, you can fundamentally solve the problem.
:'''Bernhard:''' I remembered Timaeus in the city say that there is a coating laced with Slime Condensate that has a good fire resistance effect. That's for sure worth promoting!
:'''Paimon:''' Bernhard... are you for real?
:'''Paimon:''' If Paimon knew {{Traveler}} could answer either way, Paimon would have jumped on those questions, immediately!
:'''Paimon:''' Otherwise, as one of the store owners, Paimon isn't pulling any weight at all!
:'''Bernhard:''' Please don't be discouraged, Paimon. The Honorary Knight's answers were light and witty, and also made sense. In a way, it's a lot like what you would say.
:'''Bernhard:''' Perhaps the Honorary Knight's answers to the questions were inspired by you.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, really?
:{{DIcon}} Hehe.
:{{DIcon}} You found me out.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph, that's right. Next time you have a question like that, let Paimon answer it.
:'''Bernhard:''' Either way, I always learn a lot when I'm working with you two!
:'''Bernhard:''' You passed! You gave excellent answers to both questions. Here is the reward from Leah, please accept it!
{{Dialogue End}}

====Mysterious Package====
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Bernhard:''' You two! We've got a problem!
:'''Bernhard:''' An unidentified man came quietly into the store, leaving a package and a letter.
:'''Bernhard:''' The man said in his letter that he had heard about our charity sale, and remembered his financial hardships as a child. He was very touched.
:'''Bernhard:''' He wanted every child to grow up happy, so he donated some Fairbrew Jelly and other goods for sale.
:'''Paimon:''' This is the first time this has happened to us! Paimon's a little moved...
:{{DIcon}} But... why would he hide his identity?
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe this guy has a low profile! Perhaps, doing good deeds without leaving a name also gives a special sense of accomplishment?
:'''Bernhard:''' Maybe we should be more prudent...
:'''Bernhard:''' I have heard that Treasure Hoarders have mixed counterfeit goods with ordinary goods for unsuspecting merchants to sell.
:'''Bernhard:''' This way, they can successfully throw away the hot potato, and make Mora on the side.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon can't believe it! Those horrible Treasure Hoarders, how can they even cheat innocent shop owners and customers!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's suddenly a little nervous... {{Traveler}}, what do you think we should do with the package...
:{{DIcon}} This will not affect the sales revenue.
::'''Bernhard:''' Indeed, Knights of Favonius has done this before - auctioning off the loot of Treasure Hoarders to raise money for charity.
::'''Bernhard:''' Even if the package's origins are questionable, it's all the same.
::'''Paimon:''' Come to think of it, the Treasure Hoarders wouldn't dare do this in a Knight of Favonius' shop, would they?
::'''Paimon:''' Besides, he just left the package and it didn't seem like he made half a Mora.
::'''Paimon:''' People who are willing to follow the charity sale must be very kind, and we don't have to be so nervous!
::'''Bernhard:''' Then we'll take this package. I'll make a note of it and report it to the head office.
:{{DIcon}} Better check the package.
::'''Paimon:''' Yup, let's be on the safe side!
::'''Bernhard:''' I'll take the package back to the Knights of Favonius and have it verified.

::'''Bernhard took the package to the Knights of Favonius headquarters...'''

::'''Bernhard:''' It's approved, Honorary Knight and Paimon! There was nothing wrong with the content of the package!
::'''Bernhard:''' Captain Hertha told us not to worry. In previous years, people have made such anonymous donations at the charity sale.
::'''Bernhard:''' But this is still a good reminder. Recently, we've been following the Treasure Hoarders very closely, and it's possible they could use this trick to get out of trouble.
::'''Bernhard:''' When Captain Hertha heard about it, she also made a donation to the sale from her own pocket to show her encouragement.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon sees... So the package is alright! Thanks to this mysterious kind soul. Paimon wishes him good fortune every day!
{{Dialogue End}}
====The Soggy Goods====
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Mats:''' This won't do. There won't be any end to this...
:'''Paimon:''' What's wrong, Mats? What's up with the store?
:'''Mats:''' It's an old problem. I have some daily necessities that have been shipped to my store, and they've been caught in the middle of the wind, waves, and tide.
:'''Mats:''' I was hoping to dry them while we were open, in hopes that they would be ready to sell for cheap at the end of the festival.
:'''Mats:''' But the sunshine in Mondstadt is too gentle, and we are here beside Cider Lake, where the air is humid. So far, nothing has gone as planned.
:'''Mats:''' If it goes on like this, our daily necessities will get moldy.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... this is a bit tricky.
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe we can make a fire to dry the shipment... but that would be too dangerous... Bernhard and Leah would stop it.
:{{DIcon}} You could try using Flaming Flower Stamens.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, that's a good idea. The Flaming Flower Stamens are really hot and should be able to dry them out in no time.
::'''Paimon:''' To be on the safe side, you can also put them in a large glass bottle, so you don't have to worry about fire spreading.
::'''Mats:''' Good idea. I'll send someone to get the needed materials!
::'''Mats:''' You two are very clever, and I am in your debt!
:{{DIcon}} How about using Anemograna?
::'''Paimon:''' You mean blowing the goods dry with the strong wind from the Anemograna?
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm... The wind will be strong enough for sure, but won't it blow the goods away?
::'''Paimon:''' Perhaps we can tie the boxes together and increase their total weight that way!
::'''Mats:''' Huh. That's not a bad idea! I'll send someone to find Anemograna right now, and I'll send all the supplies over.
::'''Mats:''' Thank you both very much. Please accept this as a token of my gratitude.
{{Dialogue End}}
====Floral Composition====
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Pauline:''' Arranging flowers really is a science unto itself...
:'''Paimon:''' Are you running into any problems, Pauline?
:'''Pauline:''' It's not really a big deal.
:'''Pauline:''' Usually, I always sell flowers by variety, because I think they would be clear to customers at a glance...
:'''Pauline:''' But recently, I heard that combining several kinds of flowers can make them complement each other and look more beautiful.
:'''Pauline:''' I tried to match the different flowers, and although I don't quite understand how it works, the business of the shop during the festival is significantly more busy.
:'''Pauline:''' So I was wondering, how do you cultivate this particular kind of artistic sense? Do you have to find a professional mentor?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, what Pauline said is definitely something worth thinking about.
:'''Paimon:''' What do you think, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} Go with something that matches your inspiration.
::'''Paimon:''' That's right, inspiration does work really well sometimes!
::'''Paimon:''' Y'know, you put some random flowers together and that made the store's business better, just like that!
::'''Paimon:''' And that means that you're plenty inspired. Just follow your heart from now on, and maybe you won't need a mentor at all!
::'''Pauline:''' Really? This is the first time I've been told that... I seemed to have hit my stride!
::'''Pauline:''' Thank you for your vote of confidence! I don't know what to say, but I'd like to thank you properly...
:{{DIcon}} Go look for some reference books first.
::'''Paimon:''' Well... theory is the safest way to get started.
::'''Paimon:''' The Knights of Favonius' library has a large collection of books. You should be able to find something there, right?
::'''Paimon:''' Liyue and Inazuma also have knowledge on arranging flowers. If you get the chance, you can also try to get some books written there for reference.
::'''Pauline:''' I understand. I'll ask someone to help me get some books from the library once Weinlesefest ends.
::'''Pauline:''' As for reference books from Liyue and Inazuma, I should be able to ask Mats. He travels a lot.
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, maybe the next time we meet, you'll have become a master at arranging flowers!
::'''Pauline:''' I'll do my best. Your suggestions are really valuable. Thank you very much!
:'''Pauline:''' Here's a token of my gratitude. Please take it!
{{Dialogue End}}
====Surplus Merchandise====
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Bernhard:''' Honorary Knight. Paimon. There's one more thing for you to decide.
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, alright. We'll help. What do you need?
:'''Bernhard:''' The peak time of Weinlesefest will soon be over. Some shopkeepers estimate that they will have some surplus in stock and plan to donate it to us.
:'''Paimon:''' Isn't that a good thing? "Surplus stock" sounds like a bad thing, but they seem to mean well.
:{{DIcon}} We might not be able to sell it all.
:'''Bernhard:''' The Honorary Knight has a good point. Our ability to sell is also limited.
:'''Bernhard:''' After these goods are donated to us, we might not be able to sell them, and they might accumulate.
:'''Bernhard:''' Some of the daily necessities and food would soon go bad, which would be a waste of good intentions.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm! Paimon didn't think about that. {{Traveler}} always seems to know best!
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps we should politely decline after explaining our reasons.
::'''Bernhard:''' Understood. I'll talk to the owners.

::'''Bernhard leaves to talk to the people involved...'''

::'''Bernhard:''' Honorary Knight. Paimon. The owners were very reasonable and understood our reply.
::'''Bernhard:''' However, the shopkeepers did donate a sum of money to show their support for the charity sale.
::'''Paimon:''' These shopkeepers are so kind...
::'''Paimon:''' Anyway, it is fortunate that nothing went to waste this time!
:{{DIcon}} Could it be resold to the Knights of Favonius?
::'''Bernhard:''' This is indeed a method, and sometimes, the Knights will spontaneously count their personal needs.
::'''Bernhard:''' If residents have used goods that they are willing to sell, and the knights do not mind, they can make a deal directly to reduce the waste of materials.
::'''Bernhard:''' In the same way, the inhabitants could speak directly to the knights if they need something.
::'''Bernhard:''' Maybe someone recently wanted to buy something, but didn't realize that these owners had a lot of stuff they couldn't sell.
::'''Paimon:''' Alright! Well, it's up to you to bridge the gap, Bernhard.

::'''Bernhard leaves for the Order to look at the purchase needs...'''

::'''Bernhard:''' Honorary Knight. Paimon. Good news!
::'''Bernhard:''' It just so happens that a lot of people want to buy used goods these days, and they can resell most of the surplus goods to them.
::'''Bernhard:''' Some of the knights also chipped in to pay for our hard work.
::'''Paimon:''' Okay! The thrift crisis is solved, and everyone's needs are met!
