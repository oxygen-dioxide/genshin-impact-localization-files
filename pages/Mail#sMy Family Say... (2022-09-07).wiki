|text    = My family say that birthdays are big days for Tianheng Thaumaturges and that we should never take them lightly.

On my birthday this year, I'll go up the mountain to perform prayer rituals with the elders of my clan. I've already made a list of wishes: I hope everything goes smoothly next year, and that I can make progress in training, and finally encounter evil spirits. What's more, please let me stay away from any dishes that might contain [[Jueyun Chili]]es...

Oh, and there's one more thing: I wish you safety and peace.

My prayers are not for myself alone; I want my cherished friend here to have a pleasant journey ahead, too.

By the way, are you free today? Would you like to join our prayer rituals on [[Mt. Tianheng]]?
