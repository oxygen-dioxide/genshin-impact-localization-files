===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available after step 8 of ''[[Deluge of Wrathful Waters]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Vincenzo:''' Please, friend, stay. It's not the time to go to Poisson, so please come back.
:{{DIcon}} You are...
::'''Vincenzo:''' I'm with Spina di Rosula. As you can see, the town's suffered flooding recently, and it's a total mess.
::'''Vincenzo:''' While the waters have receded for now, no one knows what's going to happen. Perhaps you also know of the [[Prophecy of Fontaine|"prophecy"]]...
::'''Vincenzo:''' Anyway, the townspeople have already evacuated. No help is needed right now, so you should really get out of here too.
:{{DIcon}} I see...
::'''Vincenzo:''' Yep. The water's been unstable these days, so it's best if you just leave. Quickly.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''Masquerade of the Guilty''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Vincenzo:''' Hello, do you need any help?
:{{DIcon}} You are...
::'''Vincenzo:''' I'm with Spina di Rosula. I mainly used to work in the [[Court of Fontaine]], but the [[Navia|Boss]] sent me here a while ago.
::'''Vincenzo:''' I'm sure you know that the town was flooded. I've come to help the people here rebuild their homes.
::'''Vincenzo:''' Ah, though they've lost so much, most of them are staying strong. They even care about me being tired...
::'''Vincenzo:''' To be honest, after getting to know everyone, I don't really want to leave...
:{{DIcon}} No need, thank you.
::'''Vincenzo:''' Hmm. The road's still not in great shape, so please be careful.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #3===
''Available after {{cx}}.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Vincenzo:''' I would have never discovered my gift for fishing if I hadn't moved to Poisson.
:{{DIcon}} You're...
::'''Vincenzo:''' Hello, I'm with the Spina di Rosula. I used to work in the Court of Fontaine until the Boss sent me here.
::'''Vincenzo:''' I'm sure you know that the town was flooded. I came over then to help the people here rebuild their homes.
::'''Vincenzo:''' Take a look for yourself! The rebuilt Poisson is quite beautiful, huh? And that's why I moved here with the intention of settling down.
::'''Vincenzo:''' Everyone here is so friendly, and they even taught me how to fish and dive... well, this is the birthplace of the Spina after all.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Vincenzo:''' See you. It's pretty nice here in town, so you should stay for a while.
