==Trivia==
* It was implied by Schubert that this domain is the same one as [[Retrieve the Holy Lyre der Himmel]] from the quest [[Chasing Shadows]].
* The two Knights of Favonius that accompany Eula during the confrontation with Schubert look the same as the ones from the quest [[Kaeya's Gain]], appearing with Kaeya in the [[Lost Treasure of Arcadia]] domain. Though they share the same appearances with [[Athos]] and [[Huffman]], it is not confirmed to be them.
