'''Floating Platform''' is a [[Furnishing Subcategory]] in the category [[Landform]].

Unlike most other Furnishings, Floating Platforms are [[Furnishing/List/By Feature#Floatable Furnishings|floatable]] and can be freely moved both vertically and horizontally. They also act as [[Furnishing/List/By Feature#Surface Furnishings|surface]]s.

As they are both floatable and surfaces, the setting "Snap Height" is also available to allow Floating Platforms to snap to the same height as other furnishings with a surface.
