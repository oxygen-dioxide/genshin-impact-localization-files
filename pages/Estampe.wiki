==Profile==
Estampe was a top competitor in the jumping contest to determine who would "rescue" [[Cimest|Princess Cimest]]. In the final round, he faced off against [[Faurobert]], the champion jumper from whom he learned his craft. Overwhelmed by the weight of everyone's expectations, Faurobert ended up fumbling a jump, making Estampe the official winner, but Estampe rejected this result as he felt that Faurobert's performance did not reflect his true abilities. He also believed that Faurobert was truly the most skilled and most worthy to represent frogkind.

In an effort to boost his self-confidence, Estampe and [[Horellou]] orchestrate a series of events that leads to Faurobert executing an impossible jump. After this, Faurobert finally accepts the role of fetching the princess, having proven to himself and others that he deserves it.

===Appearance===
Estampe is an origami frog with a green body that fades to yellow at the ends of his limbs. He has orange eyes, an orange belly, and a lotus leaf sitting atop his head.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Faurobert:''' Estampe! Where have you been!?
:'''Estampe:''' Uhh, actually, I was strolling about the area, and had a go at that trial. It was fun, but I had to adopt a slightly different approach to pass it.
:'''Estampe:''' Mr. Horellou has filled me in on everything that has happened to you. Not bad, Mr. Guardian. Turns out you're pretty talented after all, eh?
:'''Faurobert:''' Y&mdash;Y&mdash;You... If you'd been standing next to me, I'd have pushed you off, I tell you! I'd have pushed you off ten times if I had the chance!
:'''Estampe:''' Hence why I decided to take part in the trial instead. Faurobert, my friend, I always believed you could do it. And look... You did it!
:'''Horellou:''' Hahaha, you're jolly good fellows, the both of you. Today is an auspicious day for our pond!
:'''Horellou:''' Finally, we have a true champion. Though Mr. Faurobert hasn't saved a princess yet, I believe that his chance will come.
:'''Faurobert:''' *sigh* But I really didn't do anything, Mr. Horellou, other than standing by and watching as Her Highness did all the heavy lifting...
:'''Horellou:''' Isn't that even better? Surely you didn't want the princess to be in danger?
:'''Faurobert:''' I... Uh...
:'''Horellou:''' Ahh, that's quite enough, Mr. Faurobert. You were entrusted to fulfill the calling by Cibrelus himself!
:'''Faurobert:''' Oh, pish posh! I'm not even sure if it was Cibrelus! After all, I've only ever heard of him, never heard him speak!
:'''Estampe:''' And you even accepted the princess's trial. You're a champion if ever there was one.
:'''Faurobert:''' Can we just... Not talk about this for now? Please...
:'''Horellou:''' Anyway, to sum up &mdash; the future of [[Rainsong Pond]] is now in your capable hands!
:'''Horellou:''' Now, we can simply enjoy jumping for jumping's own sake! When I get back, I'll suggest to the committee that we make "fun" the focus going forward!
:'''Estampe:''' That sounds like a proposal I'd be willing to get behind. On that note, let's head back.
:'''Faurobert:''' Hey, don't leave me here!
