==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Qiu'ge:''' *cough* ...Ugh...
:'''Qiu'ge:''' Are you here for the opera? I'm sorry, but my throat's not feeling so swell...
:{{DIcon}} What happened to it?
::'''Qiu'ge:''' *cough* I'm a recent debutante, but I hurt my throat while singing a short time ago.
::'''Qiu'ge:''' Mm... Well, it's not much. My teacher used to say that this often happens to us opera singers.
::'''Qiu'ge:''' Fortunately, the troupe seems to have stopped performing for certain reasons, which has given me some time to rest my voice... *cough*
::'''Qiu'ge:''' *sigh* How many more times must I hurt my throat before I can become a star like [[Yun Jin]]?
:{{DIcon}} About the opera...
::'''Qiu'ge:''' *cough* Well, although life's not great before you make a name for yourself, and my teacher would hit me often...
::'''Qiu'ge:''' To me, standing on stage and becoming the center of attention makes it all worth it.
::'''Qiu'ge:''' Imagine the enraptured audience, beside themselves with grief or clutching their bellies with laughter because of my every action and change of expression...
::'''Qiu'ge:''' Ah... If you'd ever had that feeling, you would know what I'm talking about.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Qiu'ge:''' Farewell, dear guest, and be sure to come and watch my show once my throat has healed up.
