==Profile==
Domon is the present-day master of the [[Meikyou Shisui Art]], with the goal to become the best swordmaster in the world. He has two current known disciples, [[Junya]] and [[Nanako]], who care for him very deeply.

When he was younger, he studied Meikyou Shisui Arts, but was scolded at the time by their sensei for his aspiration to be the best. He studied the arts with his good friend and senior [[Anzai]]. Later on, Domon dueled both Anzai and their sensei, defeating both of them. Anzai left out of shame and embarrassment, while their sensei, well advanced in his years, died shortly after the duel. At some point in his travels, Domon saved Nanako from a group of pirates, but was unable to save her parents. He later settled down in [[Inazuma City]] and set up a dojo for the arts, becoming well known throughout Inazuma for his swordsmanship.

Domon has since had his Vision taken away due to the [[Vision Hunt Decree]], in turn losing his ambition to be the best in the world. This caused him to fall into a state of deep regret and anxiety of the pain he brought to others. Eventually, this lead him to lose his mind and hallucinate everyone he had previously beat in a duel surrounding him, including Anzai and his old sensei.

After reconciling with Anzai, he is now focused on passing everything he has learnt onto his disciples, including his old ambition. His Vision was soon returned to him following the abolishment of the Vision Hunt Decree, although he still retains his humbleness and continues to pass down his aspirations to his disciples.

===Personality===
Before his battle with Anzai and his sensei, he was very ambitious and eager in pursuing his dream. He also seemed to be very reliant on his own will and, to an extent, his [[Vision]].

Domon is now altruistic and generous, being very hopeful for his students. He still retains his ambitiousness from before and uses it in teaching his mastered arts further.

===Appearance===
He is a tall man with unkempt gray hair, sporting an Inazuman layman's attire. He also keeps a katana at his belt, with the curve of the blade going upwards.

==Trivia==
*[[Iwakura Mitsunari]] mentions him if you talk to him after defeating the other Iwakura Art disciples, wondering if Domon taught the Traveler their swordsmanship style.
* Considering his name and his [[Meikyou Shisui Art]], he was motivated from {{w|Domon Kasshu}} who is main character of {{w|Mobile Fighter G Gundam}}.
