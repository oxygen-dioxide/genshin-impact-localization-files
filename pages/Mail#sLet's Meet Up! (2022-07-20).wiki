|text    = Hey, comrade! Where have you been adventuring recently? If you're available, how about we meet up sometime?

I made a trip back home and told my family about you.

Before I left, they made it a point to stuff a lot of homemade food into my bag and specifically asked me to bring it to you.

Of course, I still know my manners, so I've also prepared my own share of local specialties for you. Don't worry, it's alright if you're not used to the flavor. I'd be glad if you will try a taste.

Anyway, let's set all those quarrels and fights aside today and focus on things that make us happy &mdash; family, food, weather, or even previous combat experiences... Rest assured, together, we'll never run out of topics.
