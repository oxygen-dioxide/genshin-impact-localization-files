[[Version 4.1]]
* After Converting an item, the formula selection interface will no longer move so that the selected formula appears at the bottom, and will instead align the interface so that the selected formula is in the middle of the screen. Moreover, formulas for which the player runs out of materials will not immediately be moved to the bottom of the list; the list will only be updated after switching to another screen.
