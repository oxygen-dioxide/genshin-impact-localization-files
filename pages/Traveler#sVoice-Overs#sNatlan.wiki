We froze half to death on [[Dragonspine]], narrowly avoided being fried in all those thunderstorms, got sandblasted in the scorching desert, stared death in the face in those eerie [[Withering Zones]]... The list goes on.<br><!--

|vo_01_24_tx         = '''{name3}:''' You know who we haven't seen in a while? [[Xilonen]]. Last time we saw her, she was lying down in a tree fast asleep.<br><!--
                    -->'''{{Traveler}}:''' And the time before that, she was sunbathing on the roof wearing sunglasses.<br><!--
                    -->'''{name3}:''' And the time before that, she was chilling in her home-made rocking chair, sipping fruit juice...<br><!--
                    -->'''{name3}:''' That's weird, how come our only memories of Xilonen are of her taking a break?<br><!--
                    -->'''{{Traveler}}:''' Hmm... It could be that those memories only stand out because they're so unusual. Maybe she's such a hard worker that she doesn't take breaks very often.<br><!--
                    -->'''{name3}:''' You think? Huh. Well, speaking of hard workers, Paimon's been finding herself in that category quite a lot recently.<br><!--
                    -->'''{name3}:''' Like when we were chasing down that baby [[Tepetlisaur]]. Paimon had to fly up and pretty darn high to show you the way.<br><!--
                    -->'''{name3}:''' And also the time when we went [[Cacahuatl]]-picking, and helped that messenger from the [[Scions of the Canopy]] look for their package... Whew, if anything, Paimon's been working TOO hard.<br><!--
                    -->'''{name3}:''' Hmph, Paimon's gonna be doing a lot more slacking off during our commissions from now on. But secretly, so you won't notice!<br><!--
                    -->'''{{Traveler}}:''' You slack off all you need, Paimon. I'll make sure I don't notice.<br><!--
                    -->'''{name3}:''' Aww, that's so nice of you! In that case... whenever you're slacking off, Paimon will make sure not to notice you, either!<br><!--
                    -->'''{name3}:''' Although actually... It might be easier if we just slacked off together...<br><!--
                    -->'''{name3}:''' Alright, new plan! We'll slack off at the same time, but without watching each other. C'mon, let's go, it's sunbathing time!
