'''Chubby''' {{Lang|zh=阿嘟|zh_rm=Ā Dū}}, the Teapot Traveling Salesman ([[Teapot Spirits|Teapot Spirit]]), is an [[NPC]] that can be found in the [[Serenitea Pot]]. Talking to him will allow you to purchase unique Furnishings from the [[#Traveling Depot|Traveling Depot]] shop.

Chubby appears only on [[Housing#Visit Times|certain days of the week]], namely Friday, Saturday and Sunday. He will appear randomly in one of four total possible locations each week, one in each area (Chubby will only spawn in the unlocked areas). On Fridays, Chubby's shop will only be open to the player who owns the realm he is in. On Saturdays and Sundays, his shop will open to visitors and players will be able to [[Housing#Co-Op Mode|visit their friends' Teapots]] to purchase items from him.

Purchasing items from another player's Traveling Depot is required for Round 4 of the [[Adeptal Mirror]], as well as for a weekly [[Battle Pass]] mission.

==Traveling Depot==
The furnishings available in the shop varies and the number of items depends on the player's [[Trust Rank]] when Chubby arrives for the weekend. The possible items include:

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:{{A|vo tips mimitomo store chubby 01.ogg}} '''Chubby:''' The one before you is known as Jade Seeker. One travels far and wide, seeking naught but to witness all of the treasures this world has to offer...
:{{DIcon|Shop}} What do you sell here?
::{{A|vo tips mimitomo store chubby 02.ogg}} '''Chubby:''' Ahh... encounters with fine treasures cannot be forced. This is something that only fate may decide.
:;(Opens [[#Traveling Depot|Traveling Depot]] shop)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::{{A|vo tips mimitomo store chubby 03.ogg}} '''Chubby:''' To gain that which you treasure is a blessing indeed &mdash; but do not be aggrieved should fate deny you the object of your desire.

;(In someone else's Serenitea Pot)
:'''Observe:''' (Seems we have ourselves another teapot spirit...)
