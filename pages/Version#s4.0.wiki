==Known Issues==
# Currently, some [[gadget]]s equipped by characters cannot be used underwater.

If you need to switch between gadgets, you can do it in the Inventory for now, or Quickswap to the gadgets usable underwater before you dive. This issue will be fixed in future versions.
# There is an issue in [[Genius Invokation TCG]] whereby when you have 0 Elemental Dice before the Action Phase begins, you would still be able to abnormally play the Event Card "[[Covenant of Rock]]" due to the Omni Element generated by the Equipment Card "[[Gambler's Earrings (Equipment Card)|Gambler's Earrings]]" after the Action Phase begins. (Under normal conditions, "Covenant of Rock" will not be playable as you have more than 0 Elemental Dice at this time.) This issue is scheduled to be fixed in [[Version 4.1]].
# There is an issue whereby some enemies in the water and some characters in swimming mode are unable to take DMG from [[Electro-Charged]] Reactions in certain water bodies. This issue is scheduled to be fixed in Version 4.1.
# There is an issue whereby when carrying out the World Quests "[[Capturing Light and Shadow]]" or "[[Returning Curios]]" in [[Co-Op Mode]], the host is unable to obtain the Mora treasure chest related to the "Choo-Choo Cart" gameplay under specific circumstances. We will issue the treasure chest reward via an in-game mail to all affected Travelers after the end of Version 3.8.
# There is an issue with [[Lyney]]'s Elemental Burst icon and the fireworks ignited when the Grin-Malkin Cat generated by the Elemental Burst is canceled actively or its duration ends whereby the position of its teardrop is indicated wrongly. This issue is scheduled to be fixed in Version 4.1.
# Under specific circumstances, when characters take the elevator at the [[Romaritime Harbor]] or other regions in [[Fontaine]], they might encounter an issue of falling abnormally and hovering persistently in the air. Travelers who encounter this issue can teleport to a nearby Teleport Waypoint, then take the elevator again as a temporary fix. If the issue persists, Travelers can submit feedback via the in-game Paimon Menu > Feedback.
# There is an issue whereby when certain characters [[Diving|dive]] into the water at specific regions, the character will abnormally maintain a [[climbing]] state if there is no follow-up action. Travelers who encounter this issue can teleport to a nearby Teleport Waypoint as a temporary fix. This issue will be fixed in a future update. Please stay tuned for future notices.
# There is an issue under specific circumstances whereby certain characters' voice lines will be abnormally triggered when moving around in the water (such as Opening Treasure [[Chest]] voice lines). This issue will be fixed in a future version update. Please stay tuned for future notices.
# There is an issue under specific circumstances whereby the 2-Hit DMG of [[Diluc]]'s Elemental Skill would abnormally trigger multiple times. Our developers are working hard to fix this issue, please stay tuned to future announcements.
# There is an issue under specific circumstances whereby when [[Lyney]] casts his Charged Attack at Charge Level 2, he can abnormally obtain Prop Surplus stacks without losing HP. This issue will be fixed in Version 4.1.
