'''Ashvattha's Concourses''' are locations in Sumeru that are integral to the following [[World Quest]]s:
* ''[[The Rhythm that Leads to the Gloomy Path]]''
* ''[[The Rhythm that Nurtures the Sprout]]''
* ''[[The Rhythm that Reveals the Beastly Trail]]''

Completion of these three World Quests awards the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement, ''[[The Rule of Three]]''.

Ashvattha's Concourses are originally infected with [[The Withering]], which the Traveler cleans up by entering the dreams of each [[Vasara Tree]] located within the concourses. After cleaning up The Withering within the Vasara Trees’ dreams, the trees bear a [[Vasoma Fruit]], necessary to obtain the [[Bija]].

==Lore==
A long time ago, when all Nara could see [[Aranara]] and made friends with each other, Ashvattha's Concourses were places where they played together. However, after an incident (presumably the [[Cataclysm]]) that destroyed [[Vanarana]] and [[Marana]] came into existence, these places were abandoned. The Aranara of the past &mdash; [[Araji]], [[Aramaha]], and [[Arayama]] &mdash; sealed each of the three Ashvattha's Concourses with their own rhythms, and then turned themselves into [[Vasara Trees]]. They are now considered sacred places where the Vasara Trees sleep and dream until all memories come together in [[Sarva]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Encounter in the Woods}}</ref>

Despite this, Marana continues to corrode the Ashvattha's Concourses and has even crept into the dreams of the Vasara Trees, where [[Fungi]] have taken refuge in.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Rhythm that Reveals the Beastly Trail}}</ref> By unsealing the concourses and clearing the Marana from their dreams, they will recover and accumulate dreams and memories to bear [[Vasoma Fruit]]s, which are to be offered to the Ashvattha Tree to obtain [[Bija]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The World of Aranara}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Rhythm that Leads to the Gloomy Path}}</ref>
