{{Dialogue start}}
;(At daytime)''
::'''Bruce:''' Hi&mdash; Hi! Anything the Knights can do for you?
;''(At nighttime)''
::'''Bruce:''' Hi! Are you here to try Mondstadt's famous wine too?
:{{DIcon}} About [[Stormterror]]... ''(After completing [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]])''
::'''Bruce:''' If you ask me, I don't think it's anything serious.
::'''Bruce:''' The [[Archon War]] makes Stormterror look like child's play. If you think about it, there haven't been a lot of casualties at all.
::'''Bruce:''' In any case, we have our reliable colleagues and our eminent [[Jean|Acting Grand Master]]. This issue will be solved very soon. Mondstadt won't be in any great danger.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
:;(At daytime)
:::'''Bruce:''' I was just having a sleep&mdash; Uh.. a sweep!
:::'''Bruce:''' ...I was doing a sweep&mdash; sweeping survey of all the, uh, safety blind spots in Mondstadt! Mm-hmm!
:::'''Bruce:''' Slacking off? No! By no means, not me! Never! Perish the thought!
:::{{DIcon}} What a peculiar knight...
:::'''Bruce:'''  *sigh* Look at me, making a fool of myself.
:::'''Bruce:''' In any case, you can't say peace prevails in Mondstadt unless you've got a freeloading &mdash; sorry, I meant free-spirited &mdash; knight to show for it...
:;(At nighttime)
:::'''Bruce:''' Hmm! From the look of you, you must be a traveler from out of town!
:::'''Bruce:''' Here you go, try some of this &mdash; the crowning jewel of Mondstadt's wine industry, dandelion wine!
:::'''Bruce:''' What? You're underage? In that case... you have to try the apple vinegar!
:::{{DIcon}} What are you doing here?
:::'''Bruce:''' What do you mean? I'm off work...
:::'''Bruce:''' I sleep better when I've had a little tipple after work to take the edge off.
:::'''Bruce:''' ...Huh? What difference does it make when I slack off all day anyway, you say?
:::'''Bruce:''' Well there's nothing to do because... because Mondstadt is just so peaceful, that's why.
::'''Bruce:''' I'm sure my life would have been more interesting if I'd gone with the [[Adventurers' Guild]] instead...
::{{DIcon}} ...What makes you say that?
::'''Bruce:''' Just think. As an adventurer, you'd get to go explore wherever you wanted, literally anywhere in the seven nations of [[Teyvat]]...
::'''Bruce:''' And best of all, you can make a living from it! What could be more fun than that?
::{{DIcon}} It does sound like a good deal.
::'''Bruce:''' Exactly! I also feel like the Knights have too serious an air about them for my liking...
::'''Bruce:''' By comparison, the Adventurers' Guild doesn't have so many annoying rules, and has a lot of interesting people!
::'''Bruce:''' For example, there's Fischl. I don't always understand everything she says, but it sounds really cool!
::'''Bruce:''' If only I had joined the Adventurers' Guild back then, I might even be her partner right now...
::'''Bruce:''' I've even thought of something to call myself. Something like "The Demon King of Damnation." Sounds cool, right?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Bruce:''' Okay, goodbye!
::'''Bruce:''' Hope you enjoy your stay in Mondstadt.

==Event Dialogue==
===Invitation of Windblume===
====Daytime====
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Bruce:''' Ah, the Windblume Festival... How I envy those heroes who left their mark on history...
:{{DIcon}} What's with the long face?
::'''Bruce:''' Ah, it's just a shame. Mondstadt is so... well, it's peaceful, but maybe it's too much so.
::'''Bruce:''' *sigh* If only I'd been born in the days of Old Mondstadt *hic* ...just maybe...
::'''Bruce:''' How is one to become a hero in such days of peace?
::{{DIcon}} By fending Stormterror off, perchance?
:::'''Bruce:''' Well, that certainly was an opportunity, but...
:::'''Bruce:''' Wait. Are you trying to ask me what I was doing during the Stormterror Crisis?
:::'''Bruce:''' I... I'll have you know that I was doing a sweeping survey of all of Mondstadt's safety blind spots!
:::'''Bruce:''' *cough* I mean, it's all water under the bridge now, isn't it? Let's not dredge it up anymore, hahaha...
::{{DIcon}} Perhaps dueling a [[Fatui Harbinger]] might do the trick?
:::'''Bruce:''' I... well... I mean, [[Snezhnaya]] is, after all, an ally of Mondstadt's...
:::'''Bruce:''' I couldn't possibly cause a diplomatic incident just like that, could I?
:::'''Bruce:''' *cough* I guess I should just find some other way to do this...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Bruce:''' Okay, goodbye!
