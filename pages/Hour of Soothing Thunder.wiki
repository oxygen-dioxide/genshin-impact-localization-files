{{Description|A timepiece kept by hero who conquered thunder and lightning. The tiny shard of Electro crystal within flow back and forth with the passing of time.}}
'''Hour of Soothing Thunder''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Thundersoother]].

==Description==
An hourglass the Thundersoother once used. Flowing within it is not sand, but tiny Electro shards.<br />The shards shatter and flow down as time passes, then merge at the bottom of the hourglass.

The one who defeated the Beast of Thunder crafted this hourglass from amethyst.<br />The passage of time is just like lightning. It bursts through the sky and is gone in a flash.<br />Even the Thundersoother could not conquer the flash of time.

Within this hourglass, even thunder and lightning have to obey the never-changing law of time.<br />In the hourglass, the shards shatter and merge countless times while time silently flashes by.<br />Observing this taught the Thundersoother about the cycle of life and death. Empowered with this knowledge, he was able to defeat the beast.
