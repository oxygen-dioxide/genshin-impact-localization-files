==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|According to [[Vermeer]], his lost paints and brushes are at a {{Color|buzzword|viewing spot}} that he previously visited. If you examine the two paintings carefully, you should be able to figure out where he painted them...<br>
Vermeer, an artist who is looking for inspirational material near [[Luhua Pool]], seems to have hit a snag, and is looking for help...}}
===Introduction===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Vermeer)
:'''Vermeer:''' Oh, this is terrible. How will I paint like this...?
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
:'''Vermeer:''' You... Oh, it's you, Traveler. Well, here's the problem: I've been looking for inspiration around the Luhua Pool, and I wanted to paint a few pictures to bring back with me.
:'''Vermeer:''' But I haven't been able to find a good angle, and so none of my paintings have been to my satisfaction.
:'''Vermeer:''' I was so focused on taking the scenery in that I only realized that most of my paintbrushes and paints had gone missing when I arrived here.
:'''Vermeer:''' I must have left them in the previous posts where I'd painted pictures. Could you help me look for them?
:{{DIcon}} Where did you paint those pictures?
::'''Vermeer:''' Uh, actually... I don't quite remember myself. I was too engrossed in my painting each time to pay my surroundings much mind, so I can't give you very specific locations...
:{{DIcon}} But where do I start?
::'''Vermeer:''' I was too engrossed in my paintings each time to pay attention to my surroundings, so I can't remember any specifics...
::'''Vermeer:''' But I've only painted two pictures in this area, so it can only be in those two places.
:'''Vermeer:''' I'll give you these two paintings. I'm sure that I must have left my painting tools in the areas I was {{Color|buzzword|using as a reference}} for those paintings.
:'''Vermeer:''' Once you've found them, please bring them back to me. I'll keep looking around here... I'm sure there's a better angle to take.

;(Talk to Vermeer again)
:'''Vermeer:''' I should bring more materials to paint with next time...
:'''Vermeer:''' Or maybe I should keep a memo of the things I lose instead...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Search for painting tools===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Find the spot for either [[Black and White Sketch]] or [[Color Sketch]])
:'''Paimon:''' Right, here we are. This should be the spot that was used as a scene in the painting.

;(Collect [[Vermeer's Paintbrushes]])
:'''Paimon:''' We found it! This must be the brush that the artist is looking for.

;(Collect [[Vermeer's Paints]])
:'''Paimon:''' Are these the paints that the artist is looking for? So many colors... Well, let's get them back to the artist and see what he says.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Give painting tools back to Vermeer===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Return to Vermeer)
:'''Vermeer:''' Have you found my painting tools?
:{{DIcon}} Yup.
:'''Vermeer:''' Just as I thought, I left them in the place I was taking references from. I tend to put the things I've used on the ground while I paint out of habit.
:'''Vermeer:''' When I'm in too much of a rush, I tend to leave a lot of things behind. Thank you so much. If not for you, I'd have to back into the city to buy more.
:{{DIcon}} You're going to continue painting here?
:'''Vermeer:''' Don't even mention it. I've heard people say that these two statues have eyes that could light up, and that you could see that from afar.
:'''Vermeer:''' Giant statues with blazing eyes, standing guard next to a mountain... It would surely have made an excellent painting.
:'''Vermeer:''' But when I came here, the statues were here, but there were no shining eyes to be found.
:'''Vermeer:''' I thought that I might have missed some special timing, or that my angle was off, which is why I've been walking around.
:'''Vermeer:''' But it seems that no matter where I stand, the scenery doesn't change...
:'''Vermeer:''' The only thing I've gotten out of the whole venture is this &mdash; I found it in the pond down there...
{{Dialogue End}}

===If you have not yet found a [[Strange Stone]]===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Continue from earlier dialogue)
:'''Vermeer:''' I have no idea what it is, but the more I look at it, the more it resembles an eye.
:'''Vermeer:''' But if this is an eye, then there might be another similar rock nearby. People do have two eyes, after all...
:'''Vermeer:''' *sigh* That's my conjecture, anyway. Don't think too hard about it. This rock's of little use to me, anyway, so why don't you have it? Consider it thanks for helping me find my tools.
:'''Vermeer:''' Statues with shining eyes... I wonder what secrets one can uncover in Luhua Pool?

;(Talk to Vermeer again)
:'''Vermeer:''' How will I find that one perfect view...
:{{DIcon}} Regarding that rock...
:'''Vermeer:''' About the rock? Why are you suddenly interested in that?
:'''Vermeer:''' I picked it up while looking for a good view in Luhua Pool.
:'''Vermeer:''' Do you want to go to Luhua Pool to have a look?
:'''Vermeer:''' You'll have to keep a close eye out. There's all sorts of things in that pool, and I have no idea who threw it in there...
{{Dialogue End}}

===If you already found a Strange Stone===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Continue from earlier dialogue)
:{{DIcon}} Hmm, I found one too...
:'''Vermeer:''' Did you? Let me have a look. Why, I never &mdash; they're identical.
:'''Vermeer:''' Strange. There are even words carved into the back. Now, what do they say...
:'''Vermeer:''' "The stone sentinels hold the gate as such, against those who add not a finishing touch..." What does this mean?
:'''Vermeer:''' Well, this rock's of little use to me, anyway, so why don't you have it? Consider it thanks for helping me find my tools.
:'''Vermeer:''' Actually, I have a thought. It's just a wild guess, but don't you think these two rocks look a bit like eyes?
:'''Vermeer:''' If they really are eyes, do you think that the "finishing touch" has something to do with these two stones.
:'''Vermeer:''' Well, it's just a guess, so don't think too hard about it. I'm going to look for other view, now &mdash; thanks for finding my tools for me!

;(Talk to Vermeer again)
:'''Vermeer:''' This isn't right... This can't be right. Those statues' eyes don't light up...
:'''Vermeer:''' Is my viewfinding technique wrong somehow? No, that can't be it...
:'''Vermeer:''' Eyes... What eyes? This statue doesn't have any at all.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Search for Strange Stone===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Search in the pond) (spot 1)
:'''Paimon:''' Erm, what's something like this doing in a pond...

;(Search in the pond) (spot 2)
:'''Paimon:''' Who tossed these in here...

;(Search in the pond) (spot 3 with Strange Stone)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, what's this? Is it a rock?
{{Dialogue End}}

===Conclusion===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After slotting both Strange Stones into the statues)
:'''Vermeer:''' Oh... So that's how it is! These two rocks really are the eyes of the two statues. Their eyes will only shine once you've slotted those stones in...
:'''Vermeer:''' Looks like I'll be able to paint something great after all! I'm off to find a good angle! Thank you so much!
