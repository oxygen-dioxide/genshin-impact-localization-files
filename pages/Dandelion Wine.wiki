'''Dandelion Wine''' is the signature product of the [[Dawn Winery]] and is widely famed as a [[Mondstadt]] specialty.

Dandelion Wine is so famed that merchants and businesses from other nations have tried to gain understanding, both honestly and dishonestly, about Dawn Winery's methods and the Dandelion Wine brewing process, sometimes in hopes of directly imitating it.<ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|Dawn Orchard}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Wine, with a Taste of Freedom}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Art of Hospitality}}</ref>

According to the wine maker at the Dawn Winery, [[Connor]], it has a sweetish and refreshing taste, and it is rich in cereal aroma.

In high-class society, Dandelion Wine is to be poured into a silver goblet, "allowed to breathe for 12 minutes" (which likely means to let the goblet of wine sit in an open area undisturbed), and then have ice cubes added such that 60% of the ice is submerged beneath the wine.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Eula|Something to Share: Wine-Tasting}}</ref>
