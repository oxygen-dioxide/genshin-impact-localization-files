|text      = I managed to get my hands on some [[Bulle Fruit]] recently, and I've been trying to work them into some new recipes... But the initial reviews from customers haven't been great.

Not only do most people not like meat and fruit cooked together, but they also aren't used to [[Wanmin Restaurant]] serving hot dishes that taste sweet... And I worked so hard to find the perfect ratio, too!

Still, it's okay! What's important is for everyone to enjoy the food, not for them to eat what I recommend.

You'll stop by for a bite too, won't you? [[Guoba]] already helped light the fire, so we can sit around the table and have a nice chat.

After all, grilled Bulle Fruit is absolutely delicious, and best enjoyed hot!
