'''Electro Cubes''' are puzzles found in [[Inazuma]]. There are two types of Electro Cubes: ones that rotate and ones that light up when attacked. The rotation and lighting changes can affect adjacent cubes or a specific set of cubes, so attacking different cubes is required to solve the puzzle and obtain rewards. When the cube puzzle is solved, the cubes will stay lit similar to [[Elemental Monuments]].

==Gameplay Notes==
*Damage from [[Normal Attack]]s, [[Elemental Skill]]s, or [[Elemental Burst]]s will cause the cube to react.
**Elemental Bursts with continuous damage can cause a cube to react more than once, but only one cube can be rotated or lit up at a time. Elemental Bursts that do not deal damage, like [[Barbara]]'s will not affect cubes. {{verify|any other characters who can't affect cubes with their bursts?}}
*The cubes are sometimes at the same level, other times at different heights. Once all the blocks are lined up, the blocks will glow and activate a mechanism, such as revealing a hidden [[Chest]], lowering/raising water levels, or opening doors.
*One particular cube puzzle in Inazuma requires figuring out which cubes, when lit up, will cause all the diagonal, vertical, and horizontal sums to be equal.
