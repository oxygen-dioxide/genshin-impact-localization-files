==Description==
The naginata was a lethal weapon by which scattered dross might be cut away.<br>
And the one who wielded that naginata was [[Ei|one who guarded the path to eternity]].

When the one who stood high above the storm clouds looked upon the mortal world, which she so loved,<br>
Seeing their shallow disputes and transient obsessions...<br>
Such contentions stemmed from needless attachments and unchecked desire &mdash; both enemies of eternity.<br>
The wild weeds that disturbed the unchanging world would be swept away by the lightning.

"Well then &mdash; what sort of Eternity would {{Obfuscate|Ei}}'s eyes reflect?" So asked the [[Kitsune Saiguu|clergyperson]] who sloshed and drank wine with her under the sakura tree in that still-clear memory.

What a pointless question. Though the answer she gave them was lost to the alcohol,<br>
She had gained the answer countless times in those memories. One must thin fruits to improve their quality, and plants used in dyes must have their flowers pruned.<br>
Not a single speck of dross could be permitted in an eternal paradise.

"Ah, but even so..."<br>
"Using that great blade of light to uproot all obsession and to eliminate the possibility for dreams to take root and wither by themselves..."<br>
"A tranquil world that brooks no dispute, no gain, or no loss... It shall be an amnesiac world, lost to itself."<br>
In the heart of eternity, those old friends still appear so clear and the scent of the sakura remains so fresh.

But I will never forget you, just as I will not forget the things that were lost across the years.<br>
After all...

Having witnessed the [[Cataclysm|pitch-dark annihilation]] consume those precious to her,<br>
How could she not see the absurd nature of life and death, yes, incomprehensible destiny itself, as her mortal foe?<br>
But since no one can overturn the impermanence of the world,<br>
and the barren nature of this game,<br>
Then let the eternal euthymia within her heart carry forth into the [[Inazuma|nation she loves]].

==Trivia==
* The Japanese name of the polearm {{Lang|Kusanagi no Inabikari|ja=草薙の稲光|ja_tl=Lightning of Grass-Cutting}} may be a reference to {{Lang|{{w|Kusanagi no Tsurugi}}|ja=草薙の剣|ja_tl=Sword of Grass-Cutting}}, one of the Three {{w|Imperial Regalia of Japan}}. In Shinto, the sword symbolizes the valor of an emperor and the nation.
** The mythology says the sword was found from the dead body of the great serpent {{w|Yamata no Orochi}} (which may have inspired the serpent god [[Orobashi]] in the game), who had been slain by the storm god {{w|Susanoo-no-Mikoto|Susanoo no Mikoto}}. Susanoo then rescued and married the damsel in distress  {{w|Kushinadahime}}, who is the goddess of rice plant, which in turn is traditionally associated with thunder and lightning. For example, ''[[Inazuma]]'' ("Lightning") literally means the "Spouse of Rice-Plant" (Susanoo in this case).
** According to legends, the sword was wielded by the hero {{w|Yamato Takeru}}, when one of his enemies set a fire to burn him in the midst of the field. He then cut down the grass with this sword to reverse the direction of the flames; one legend from the classic ''Nihon Shoki'' even says the magical sword moved autonomously for this action. Hence the sword earned the name Kusanagi ("Grass-Cutting").
* In the [[Version/2.0|Version 2.0]] Special Program, Xiao Luohao, Head of the Creative Concept and Writing Team, mentions that the weapon Ei used to kill Orobashi weighed thousands of tons.
