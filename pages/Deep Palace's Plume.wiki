{{Description|A down feather with the same hue as coral, said to come from a shrine maiden's ceremonial garment.}}
'''Deep Palace's Plume''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Ocean-Hued Clam]].

==Description==
In the days when the many clans first saw the light of day, [[Omikami]] chose shrine maidens from among the people of the sea.<br>In the island-songs of history, the first Divine Priestess was once one of the sea-daughters who collected pearls.

She would come amongst the children, who in their meaningless conflict, lost sight of their future<br>And amongst the old who had lost sight of life's beauty amidst ruthless tragedy.<br>The Divine Priestess comforted the people using her lovely songs and gentle words,<br>And even amidst the stormy times, the people of Watatsumi saw hope for the first time.

This sea-born feather was said to have come from that Divine Priestess' ceremonial garb.<br>It was plucked by mistake by a child's tender hand, and was preserved by a fretful person.<br>Later, when the brave hero and priestesses rushed to their irrevocable sacrifice,<br>The Divine Priestess' ceremonial garment was not lost, but passed down in memory to the present day.
