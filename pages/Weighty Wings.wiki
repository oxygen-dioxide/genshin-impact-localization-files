{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the camp)
:'''???:''' Look what you've done, [[Night Owl]]! This could have made us a killing!
:'''Night Owl:''' Hey, don't try pinning it all on me! *sigh* If it's really beyond saving... Well, at least we've got plenty of substitutes...
:'''Qucusaurus:''' *whine*

;(Approach the Qucusaurus)
:'''Paimon:''' Wait a second! What are you rascals thinking of doing to it?

;(After defeating the enemies)
:'''[[Mouse]]:''' Ugh, you're... tougher than you look...
:'''Night Owl:''' Gah. Who did we offend... Who'd send someone on this day, of all days, to come whack us...
:'''Night Owl:''' Please, {{MC|m=Big Bro|f=Big Sis}}. How have we offended you? Just... let us know. We won't do it again.
:'''Mouse:''' Hey, you little rascal! You're really gonna grovel before this piece of work?
:'''Night Owl:''' You think talking tough's going to make us a living? I can see it now, I tell you. We're just living like thieves and crooks. There's nothing special about trafficking Saurians, is there?
:'''Night Owl:''' If the only alternative's being robbed by a stronger crook, why shouldn't I go with them instead?
:'''Night Owl:''' And not to brag, {{MC|m=Big Bro|f=Big Sis}}, but I'm sure I'd be way more useful to you than these two. Just call me if you need anything. I'll settle it, nice and clean.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Hmm?
:{{DIcon}} Well, I do happen to be shopping about for a sidekick.
::'''Paimon:''' Are you serious!? No way! Paimon vetoes this motion!
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for your consideration, but no need.
:'''Paimon:''' Also, you're a bunch of bad eggs anyway! No way good guys like us would team up with Saurian traffickers like you!
:{{DIcon}} Yup, there's no one good-er than me.
:{{DIcon}} Well, there's always room for accommodation.
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, you're gonna be a bad influence on {{Little One}}! Don't worry, little guy, there's no way we're teaming up with this lot!
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrrah... Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Ahem! Anyway, whatever designs you have on the Saurians, better stop now, or we'll... Well, {{Traveler}} will show you what's what.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:{{Black Screen|The two traffickers leave amidst a cloud of resentment...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon wonders how that Qucusaurus is doing. Shall we go see to it?

;(Talk to the Qucusaurus)
:'''Qucusaurus:''' Roar...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh no, it looks so weak... It must have suffered so much...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Wooo... Rrrooo...
:{{DIcon}} If only there was something we could do to help...
:{{DIcon}} We can't take care of it forever, can we...
::'''Paimon:''' But there's gotta be something we can do to make it feel better, even if it's only for a short time...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrah... Rawr! Raaawr!
:'''Paimon:''' What is it? Do you have an idea, {{Little One}}?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!

;(Talk to the Qucusaurus again, optional)
:'''Qucusaurus:''' (It looks incredibly weak. If only there was some way to revive it...)

;(Follow Little One to the [[Embercore Flower]])
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Raaawr! Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Do you think Embercore Flowers might help it out?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Sure, we can give it a go!

;(Interact with the Qucusaurus)
:Use Embercore Flower ×1 to heal the Qucusaurus?
:;(Submit {{Item|Embercore Flower|x=1}})
:;(The Qucusaurus recovers 1/3 of its health)
:The Qucusaurus seems to have recovered a bit

;(After submitting three Embercore Flowers)
:'''Qucusaurus:''' ...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr... Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like it's kinda reinvigorated?
:'''Paimon:''' Heh. Flew away just like that... Guess it still doesn't trust us, huh?
:{{DIcon}} Trust isn't built overnight, you know.
::'''Paimon:''' That's true. We had to work hard to reach the understanding we've got with {{Little One}} too!
:{{DIcon}} Looks like it'll fly on its own power just fine.
::'''Paimon:''' Sure does. Great idea, {{Little One}}!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Rawr rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' And it's not like we did it to earn its gratitude or anything, don'cha think, {{Little One}}?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, you're a generous little Saurian, aren't you? Just like Paimon and {{Traveler}}!
