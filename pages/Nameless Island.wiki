==Reaching the Island==
There are several different ways to reach the nameless island:
* Use {{Cryo}} applications ([[Kaeya]], [[Qiqi]], [[Wriothesley]], etc.) on the [[water]] to freeze it and walk to the island.
* Glide off [[Starsnatch Cliff]].
** Aim for the nearest rock off the coast.
** Utilize [[:Category:Adventurer's Dishes|food]] or [[:Category:Gliding Talents|passive talents]] to decrease gliding stamina consumption or restore stamina.
** Utilize the [[Red Feather Fan]] or [[Xiao]]'s [[Lemniscatic Wind Cycling]] to boost the traveling speed.
* Use a [[Waverider]] (requires completion of {{Quest|Transient Dreams}}).
* Use [[Furina]]'s skill to walk on water, repeating it when available to not lose the effect.

==Trivia==
* The Ruin Guard on the island has some peculiarities:
** It respawns with daily [[reset]] like other Elite Enemies, but it is not guaranteed to spawn. Its spawn chances appear to be random, and it may take several days before it respawns.
** It will spawn on either the northern side of the island (against a rock, facing the island) or on the southern side (against a rock, facing away from the island).
** If the Ruin Guard spawns on the north side, it will always generate with a random title. If it spawns on the southern side, it is treated as a normal enemy and no boss HP bar or title will appear during combat.
* When the player approaches the area surrounding the center of the island, a sound effect that resembles strong, ominous wind will play. It becomes notably stronger at the area behind the sundial. At the center however, the sound effects will cease.
** This sound effect can also be heard at [[Stormterror's Lair]], specifically at the wind barrier surrounding the base of [[Decarabian]]'s tower. It is heard strongest close to the bottom.
