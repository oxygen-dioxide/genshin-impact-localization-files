{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the location)
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's quite a crowd over there. Is someone doing a performance? Let's go see!

;(Approach Sansa)
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 01.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' Uh, h&mdash;hi everyone...! I'm Sansa, and I'm a... or, well, I'm working on becoming a bard. Uh... Th&mdash;Thanks for coming out today, and um... yeah, uh... I guess I'll start the song now...
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 02.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' "All goes quiet on Starsnatch Cliff. High in the trees, all is..." Wait, sorry, that's not right.
:;(The crowd slowly disperses)
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 03.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' "High in the trees, no whiff of the wind, no sign of... the birds, no flapping of wings..." Uh, then it goes... "Pause"... "Pause for a moment, and"...
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 04.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' Oh gosh, this is so embarrassing, I'm making a complete mess of this... I didn't get tongue-tied at all on the forty-second time or the ninetieth time, so why can't I get it right now?
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The forty-second and ninetieth time...?
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 05.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' Yep! I rehearsed this a hundred times to try and perfect my performance. So this is my one-hundred-and-first time playing this song, but my first time performing it live...
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 06.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' *sigh* I really thought it would go well this time, but nope &mdash; I blew it again. Though not for lack of practice, surely... I guess I need to figure out what I was doing right on my forty-second and ninetieth attempts, and keep practicing...
:{{DIcon}} A hundred rehearsals is plenty.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe the problem isn't the amount of practice, but something else.
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right! That amount of practice should have been more than enough. If it still isn't working... Maybe it's more a question of how you've been practicing?
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 paimon 04a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Actually, {{Traveler}} here has loads of experience with performing music. Why don't you tell us what your method is? Maybe we can give you some suggestions!
:{{DIcon}} Oh, please. I dabble.
:{{DIcon}} I'm just a hobbyist, but I can share my thoughts if you'd like.
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And, uh, Paimon can give... give you pro tips from an audience perspective! As a highly seasoned and professional audience... person!
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 07.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' Aw... That's so kind of you, I'm touched that you're willing to help me. Gimme a second &mdash; lemme just check my notes... or actually, why don't I just give you my notes so you can read them for yourself?
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Notes about what?
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 08.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' Just things I jot down after each practice. Stuff to watch out for, areas to improve on, et cetera... Oh, but you can ignore the second half, that's just my random thoughts on other people's performances and trying out different instruments...
:{{Black Screen|The worn-out notebook records Sansa's detailed reflections on her rehearsals. But the "random thoughts" in the second half are quite verbose... it sounds less like journaling and more like an essay or research report...}}
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, this is denser than the encyclopedias in the Mondstadt Library! So are you like, a music scholar? Collector? Librarian?
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 09.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' Hehe, well, my parents always hoped I'd become a scholar, so they made me take classes in all of those things and more... But now, I'm applying everything I've learned in academia to becoming a bard!
:{{DIcon}} That sounds logical... but feels off somehow.
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 10.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' Well, I'm all ears. Where do you think I'm going wrong, {{Traveler}}? Have I misunderstood some core principles of music theory, perhaps? Or am I approaching my rehearsals wrong?
:{{DIcon}} Uhh... I'm not sure I'm qualified to answer that...
:{{DIcon}} It feels like your efforts are misdirected.
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon never knew being a bard was such hard work. The Tone-Deaf Bard always makes it look so easy. He never seems stressed out at all...
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And still, his singing and lyre playing always sound really great. Hmm, unless he's actually been practicing in secret?
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hehe. Looking for me, {{Traveler}}?
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 11.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' *gasp* Venti!
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aah! Tone-Deaf Bard? Where'd you come from!?
:{{DIcon}} Which wind brought you here?
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Why, the sweet wind of reminiscence, of course. Sweet, with a hint of exotic flora, blowing from a land far away.
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmph, well Paimon sure hasn't missed that attitude...
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hehehe. Actually, I was just out taking a stroll in the countryside, when inspiration struck me like an apple falling from a tree. So I grabbed a leaf and hastily wrote down a few lines of verse...
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' But before I could finish, there was a "whoosh"...
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 12.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' ...A whoosh?
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Yes, the sound of a mischievous wind who insisted on being the first one to read my new poem. It whipped the leaf right out of my hand and whisked it away. I was about to give chase, but then I saw a dark silhouette appear and grab the leaf in its mouth.
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I sneezed a few times, and when I'd recovered, my second avid reader had vanished without a trace.
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 venti 07.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Now I'm having the urge to sneeze again just thinking about it...
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, so it must have been a cat that stole the leaf, right? And with your allergies, you can't exactly go chasing it down...
:{{DIcon}} But we can help.
:{{DIcon}} I'll ask the cat what it thought of the poem.
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 13.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' I can help too, Venti! Your music has always been a huge inspiration to me, so it would be my honor!
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 14.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' And, um... After we find it, could I... get some advice on songwriting from you...?
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 15.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' Sorry! I know I shouldn't spring that on you... I was just worried if I stayed quiet now, I might be too shy to ask later, and I didn't wanna let the opportunity slip by, so... I'm sorry! I hope I didn't make this weird!
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 venti 08.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hahaha, it's fine. If problems are the veins on a leaf, inspiration is like the nutrients that flow through them &mdash; you've got to grab them when you can.
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 venti 09.ogg}} '''Venti:''' So whatever questions you have, ask away. I'll gladly share my thoughts with you.
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 16.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' Wow, really!? Okay, I'll just grab my... Wait, where's my notebook? Oh, it's right here... Sorry, gimme a second!
:{{Black Screen|Sansa frantically flicks through to the "Questions" page in her notebook, takes a deep breath, then explains her background and the issues she's having...}}
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 venti 10.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I see... Well, it sounds like you've already mastered music theory and your instrument. I don't think you need my input on either of those.
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? But then, why did her performance go so badly despite all the effort she put in? There's gotta be a reason for it!
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 17.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' I guess I just lack that natural talent... Maybe I'm not meant to be a bard, heh...
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 venti 11.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Do you still remember why you wanted to become a bard in the first place?
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 18.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' Lemme think... Maybe it was a sense of yearning. Back when my parents forced me to stay in my room and study, I'd always hear this bard singing outside the window...
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 19.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' His wonderful melodies and beautiful voice were like a soft breeze that stirred my heart... I remember thinking to myself... If I became a bard, could I be free, like him?
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 20.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' Yeah, that's it. I wanted to be free and happy just like him. And like him, I wanted to share that joy with the whole world...
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 21.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' But I get so nervous when I'm performing in front of a crowd. I try to mitigate that by doing plenty of practice to make sure nothing goes wrong, but it's no use. As soon as the performance starts, I get tongue-tied...
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 venti 12.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Well, I think you are a true bard.
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 22.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' What? But... I can't even get my words out...
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 venti 13.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Didn't you say that you dreamed of becoming a bard for the sake of freedom and happiness?
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 venti 14.ogg}} '''Venti:''' A bard's voice is like the wind &mdash; nothing can tie it down, and nothing can stand in its way. Otherwise, you wouldn't have heard that bard's voice from your bedroom where you were studying.
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 venti 15.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I do believe you're a true bard. But... there's too much noise in your ears, and you've allowed that to drown out your own thoughts. That's what's holding you back.
:{{DIcon}} Stop worrying about what other people think.
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Exactly! If you really wanna share freedom and joy with the world, first you need to be the freest and happiest person of them all!
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 venti 16.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Nice, Paimon. Sounds like you have the makings of a bard, too.
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 23.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' So I've gotta be my freest, happiest self in order to share that with others... Yeah, that makes a lot of sense! Thank you all so much, I'll be sure to take that to heart!
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 venti 17.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Well, since we're all here, why not give it another shot with {{Traveler}} and I accompanying you on our instruments?
:{{DIcon}} I'd be happy to.
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' In that case, Paimon will be the audience. Paimon is the most professional... and freest audience you'll ever find! Hehe.
:;(Venti, Sansa, and the Traveler perform together, attracting a crowd again)
----
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 24.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' That was... that was my first ever successful performance in front of a crowd! For once, I didn't stumble over my words. Ah, I'm so happy...
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 25.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' Once the music started, it felt like I became one with the wind. I could roam freely, and nothing could stop me...
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The audience definitely felt it too. Look, even that cat came to check out the show! ...Wait... a cat!?
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 venti 18.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Aha, it must be my second avid reader! Let's go ask it about its thoughts on my... my... achoo!
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 26.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' Oh, Charcoal, so it was you! I'm sorry, that's my neighbor's cat. Whenever I'm rehearsing, it always comes to sit on the windowsill and listen in...
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 tbd 01.ogg}} '''"Charcoal":''' Meow~
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What was that in its mouth? Was it the leaf with Venti's poem?
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 27.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' Charcoal, that belongs to Venti. It's very important to him. Could you give it back?
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 tbd 02.ogg}} '''"Charcoal":''' Meow~
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 28.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' You've helped me so much. I feel bad that I have no way to repay you...
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 venti 19.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hey, you've helped me plenty. You got my missing inspiration back, didn't you? That's a huge he... hah.. hachoo!
:{{DIcon}} Let's ask kitty for a critique.
:{{DIcon}} Did you like the poem, kitty?
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 tbd 03.ogg}} '''"Charcoal":''' Meow~
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 venti 20.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Aw, you liked it? Whoa, not so close... Achoo! No more peeking! I haven't finished writing it yet!
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 venti 21.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Whew, what a friendly feline... My friends, I hope to see you at my next performance!
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Gone like the wind...
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 29.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' I can hardly believe I got a personal lesson from Venti himself... I must find time to thank him properly. ...Oh, and of course, I owe you two a huge thank-you as well.
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 30.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' I can't offer much, but... why don't you take this songbook? It's from back when I was studying &mdash; I noted down all kinds of tunes from many parts of the world. Maybe you'll find it useful!
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 sansa 31.ogg}} '''Sansa:''' Oh, and as well as tunes, I also collected all kinds of instruments! You're welcome to try them out any time you want. It'd be great to have another musician to trade tips with.
:{{A|vo tbmb001 1 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, awesome! We'll definitely take you up on that.
