'''Cryptic Message in Sumeru''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] that takes place in [[Sumeru]], which involves discovering at least one Damaged Ruin Guard which, after reactivating, will reveal a coded message. Interacting with all 5 Damaged Ruin Guards after submitting the Lost Energy Blocks will reward the {{Achievement|In the Name of Anfortas}}.

Also intertwined with these messages are traces of the [[Zandik's Legacy|ill-fated Sumeru investigation team]] involving a certain Trainee Dastur named [[Zandik]].

==Steps==
# Collect 15 [[Lost Energy Block]]s
#* Each Damaged Ruin Guard has 1 Lost Energy Block nearby, so another 10 blocks are needed
# Activate the [[Dendrogranum-Locked Rock]] near one of the Damaged Ruin Guards to reveal a non-hostile [[Ruin Scout]]
# Follow the Ruin Scout
#*Some Fungi will spawn on the path that the Ruin Scout follows. Defeating them is optional
# Defeat the hostile [[Ruin Sentinel]]s that spawn near the Damaged Ruin Guard
#*After defeating the Ruin Sentinels, an [[Exquisite Chest]] will spawn
# Place three [[Lost Energy Block]]s into the Damaged Ruin Guard
#*The Ruin Guard's name will change to '''Records: Code "[Name]"'''
# Interact with the Ruin Guard. ''(Optional)''
# Repeat Steps 2 to 6 for the other four Damaged Ruin Guards
#* All Lost Energy Blocks will be removed from the inventory once the fifth Damaged Ruin Guard is done

===Deciphering===
#The Ruin Guards' codenames are the names of the first five {{w|Futhark}} runes. The messages should be put together in alphabetical order: Fehu, Uruz, Thurisaz, Ansuz, Raidho.
#*{{F|.2-.1.-1..1-2.1-1.2-.2.-.1-..1.-.-.1-.2-.2-1.1-2-.-.3-...-..1-..1.-.3-...1-1.2-3-2-2.-..1-1.2-....-..1.-2-....-.2-.1..-1.-1..1-....-..1.-2.-.}}
#Convert {{F|-}} to spaces, and the numbers to the equivalent number of dashes:
#*{{F|.-- .-. -..- --.- -.-- .--. .- ..-. . .- .-- .-- -.- -- . .--- ... ..- ..-. .--- ...- -.-- --- -- --. ..- -.-- .... ..-. -- .... .-- .-.. -. -..- .... ..-. --. .}}
#Decipher as {{w|Morse code}}:
#*{{F|WRXQYPAFEAWWKMEJSUFJVYOMGUYHFMHWLNXHFGE}}
#Decipher the {{w|Vigen√®re cipher}} with the key {{F|ANFORTAS}}, a name ascribed to a Knight Marshall inside the Ruin Golem:
