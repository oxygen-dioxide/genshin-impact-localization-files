|text      = Haven't you rested yet? That won't do at all. You have to promise me you'll get a good night's sleep so you'll be ready to embrace this flower-filled day of happiness, okay?

In return, I've prepared a gift even sweeter than Candied Ajilenakh Nuts. I'll give it to you in your dreams!

And after day breaks, come find me, and we'll ride the Flower Carriage together amid the sounds of celebration...

The Knight of Flowers and other attendants will give us candy, and we can follow the path to find our hidden friends. Together we'll hold hands, throwing Padisarah petals as we dance in a circle.

Right now, these hopes of mine are like the bubbles gurgling and fizzing from those fruit spritzers.

Can you smell the sweet scent, too?
