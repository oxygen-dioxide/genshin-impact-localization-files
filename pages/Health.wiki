'''Health''' or '''Health Points''' abbreviated in-game as '''HP''', is an {{w|integer}} measure of how much life force a character has. If a character's HP reaches 0, they will become incapacitated, and the next character in the player's team will be brought onto the field. If all characters on the team die, the player will automatically revive at the nearest Teleport Waypoint and the characters will have less than 50% of HP. HP can be restored by eating [[food]], by using Talents, character Passives, weapon passives that heal, or by a [[Statue of The Seven]]'s Blessing.

* When the player's entire team falls, the following sound effect plays:
** In the overworld: {{A|Player Death SFX.ogg}} All members have fallen
** In domains: Challenge failed

The relevant in-game attribute is Max HP &mdash; the current maximum HP of a character. Max HP can be increased by raising your character level or equipping [[artifacts]] and [[weapons]] that provide HP or HP% increase. Leveling up these weapons and artifacts will also increase the HP bonus they provide. All flower-type artifacts increase HP, so leveling these up is a good way to boost HP.

:<math>\text{Max HP} = \text{Base HP}_\text{Character} \times (1 + \% \text{ HP Bonus}) + \text{HP Flat Bonus}</math>
