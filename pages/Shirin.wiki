==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Shirin:''' Lucky me! I've found another [[Nilotpala Lotus]] habitat.
:{{DIcon}} Are you picking Nilotpala Lotuses?
::'''Shirin:''' Not yet, I'm just marking their locations for now.
::'''Shirin:''' Nilotpala Lotuses are common medicinal plants, but they work best when they're fresh.
::'''Shirin:''' As the [[Forest Rangers]]' doctor, I must do my best to mark areas rich with herbs so that I can pick them easily when they're needed.
::'''Shirin:''' The rainforest may seem quiet, but its dangers cannot be underestimated. If you do enter the forest, try to stay on the main path and pay attention to your surroundings.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I will.
:::'''Shirin:''' Okay. And on top of common emergency medicine, it's best to have a handy weapon.
:::'''Shirin:''' Something that can be used for hunting, or against monster attacks. Ranged weapons like bows are quite ideal. They're also a common choice for us Forest Rangers.
::;(Obtain [[Recurve Bow]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Shirin:''' Goodbye. Stay safe.
