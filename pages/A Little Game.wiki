==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You met a strange person on [[Mt. Tianheng]] who is looking for someone to play hide-and-seek with him...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Childish Jiang near Mt. Tianheng)
:'''Childish Jiang:''' So bored... Need someone to play with...
:{{DIcon}} What are you up to?
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Mom and dad don't have time to come home and play with me, so I have to play here all by myself. But it's so boring playing with only one person...
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Also, I can't stray too far from home, otherwise mom and dad wouldn't be able to find me when they got back, and then they'd start worrying.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Do you wanna play with me? We can play hide-and-seek, it's really easy, anyone can play it.
:{{DIcon}} Sure, I love that game!
::'''Childish Jiang:''' Yay! Alright, let the game begin!
::'''Childish Jiang:''' Um, but gimme a sec first... I haven't thought where to hide...
::'''Childish Jiang:''' ...Okay, I got it! Hehehe, you'll never find me!
::'''Childish Jiang:''' Ready?
::{{DIcon}} I'm ready!
:::'''Childish Jiang:''' Okay! Uh, on your marks... get ready... let's go!
::;(1st hide-and-seek challenge starts)
::{{DIcon}} Not just yet...
:::'''Childish Jiang:''' Okay, well you do what you gotta do... and when you're ready, let me know!
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, no hiding and seeking for me today...
::'''Childish Jiang:''' Okay... Guess I'll play alone some more then...

;(If you fail the 1st hide-and-seek challenge)
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Hee-hee, see? Told you you'd never find me, didn't I!
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Well, since it's your first time playing, I'll give you a little clue.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' I'm hiding {{Color|buzzword|behind a rock}}. You just gotta look a little harder! You wanna carry on playing?
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
:;(1st hide-and-seek challenge starts)
:{{DIcon}} I need a break.
:;(Ends dialogue, talking again starts from the hint)

;(If you fail the 1st hide-and-seek challenge for the 2nd time)
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Still can't find me?
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Seems like I'm pretty good at this! Hmm.... Maybe I should go easier on you.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' I'm hiding {{Color|buzzword|to the north}}. You just gotta a look a little harder! You wanna carry on playing?
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
:;(1st hide-and-seek challenge starts)
:{{DIcon}} I need a break.
:;(Ends dialogue, talking again starts from the hint)

;(If you fail the 1st hide-and-seek challenge for the 3rd time)
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Was I really so well hidden? Hmm, this must be getting pretty boring for you if you can't find me.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' I'm hiding near {{Color|buzzword|a big rock to the north}}.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Alright, let's go shall we? Surely you'll be able to find me this time.
:{{DIcon}} Nah, I'm fine.
:;(1st hide-and-seek challenge starts, without any timer)
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, I need a rest.
:;(Dialogue ends, talking again repeats the hint)

;(Talk to Childish Jiang in his 1st hiding spot)
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Ah, you found me! Was it obvious?
:{{DIcon}} It was pretty obvious...
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Really? How could that be? When I hid here, even my father couldn't find me...
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Hmph. We've only just begun. I haven't used my full power yet!
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Let's play.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' This time, I'm gonna hide in the best hiding place ever. You'll never find me!
:{{DIcon}} Okay.
:;(2nd hide-and-seek challenge starts)
:{{DIcon}} Actually, I need a break.
:;(Dialogue ends, talking to him again repeats dialogue from 'Let's play')
----
;(If you fail the 2nd hide-and-seek challenge)
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Give up?
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Hmm... Okay, I'll give you a little clue. This time, I'll be hiding {{Color|buzzword|near one of the trees around here}}.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Let's have another round, you'll definitely be able to find me this time. Well? You wanna carry on playing?
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
:;(2nd hide-and-seek challenge starts)
:{{DIcon}} I need a break.
:;(Dialogue ends, talking again repeats the hint)

;(If you fail the 2nd hide-and-seek challenge for the 2nd time)
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Still couldn't fine me? Maybe you're just not very good at this kind of game...
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Here's a tip: Try looking {{Color|buzzword|further northwest}}. I'm hiding over that way.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Let's go again. You ready?
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
:;(2nd hide-and-seek challenge starts)
:{{DIcon}} I need a break.
:;(Dialogue ends, talking again repeats the hint)

;(If you fail the 2nd hide-and-seek challenge for the 3rd time)
:'''Childish Jiang:''' ...Have you even played this game before?
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Ugh, it's hopeless... You'll never find me at this rate.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Look out for a {{Color|buzzword|tree on the slope to the northwest}}.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Surely you must be able to find me now... Let's give it another try.
:{{DIcon}} Nah, I'm fine.
:;(2nd hide-and-seek challenge starts, without any timer)
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, I need a rest.
:;(Dialogue ends, talking again repeats the hint)

;(Talk to Childish Jiang in his 2nd hiding spot)
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Ah, you found me!
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Hee-hee, was I well hidden or what? This is my secret hiding place. Even mommy can't find me here!
:{{DIcon}} That tree doesn't hide you completely.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' I don't believe you! I'm tiny and this tree hides me perfectly, even daddy says so.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' My dad's really tall and it even hides him. There's no way it could hide him but not me.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Anyway, I guess you're really good at this game. Let's play again!
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Hmph, this time I'm gonna hide way out of sight. I know just the place, daddy picked it for me...
:'''Childish Jiang:''' My daddy's a Millelith, and he says that there's no one better than him at being stealthy.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Every time we've played hide-and-seek before, mommy can never ever find me and daddy until daddy comes out on purpose... Or mommy yells at him to come out, that works too.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Bet you won't find me this time!
:{{DIcon}} Okay.
:;(3rd hide-and-seek challenge starts)
:{{DIcon}} Actually, I need a break.
:;(Dialogue ends, talking again starts from 'bet you won't find me this time')
----
;(If you fail the 3rd hide-and-seek challenge)
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Haha, guess you couldn't find me after all?
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Well, it is a pretty neat hiding place. My daddy found it for me, even mommy can't find me there.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' There's no way you can compete with daddy in this game, so I'll have to give you a clue. My hiding place is {{Color|buzzword|nearby that house over there}}.
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
:;(3rd hide-and-seek challenge starts)
:{{DIcon}} I need a break.
:;(Dialogue ends, talking again repeats the hint)

;(If you fail the 3rd hide-and-seek challenge for the 2nd time)
:'''Childish Jiang:''' See, you couldn't find me, right? Haha, well this hiding place was picked by my dad, after all.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' I'll have to give you a clue, otherwise you'll never find me. So, try heading {{Color|buzzword|east}} next time.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Let's go again! You can do it, you just need to look a little harder.
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
:;(3rd hide-and-seek challenge starts)
:{{DIcon}} I need a break.
:;(Dialogue ends, talking again repeats the hint)

;(If you fail the 3rd hide-and-seek challenge for the 3rd time)
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Couldn't find me, huh?
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Don't feel bad &mdash; my daddy found the hiding place for me, so normal people would never be able to find it.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Here's a tip: Look out for {{Color|buzzword|hidey holes around that house to the east}}.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' As tips go, that was a pretty big one. So surely you should be able to find me now.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Let's go again! You can do it, you just need to look a little harder.
:{{DIcon}} Nah, I'm fine.
:;(3rd hide-and-seek challenge starts, without any timer)
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, I need a rest.
:;(Dialogue ends, talking again repeats the hint)

;(Talk to Childish Jiang in his 3rd hiding spot)
:'''Childish Jiang:''' What do you think of daddy's specially chosen hiding place? Pretty well hidden, right?
:{{DIcon}} It wasn't that hard to find.
::'''Childish Jiang:''' Really? Well... At least, Mommy can never find me and Daddy when we're hiding here.
:{{DIcon}} It was pretty hard to find.
::'''Childish Jiang:''' See? See? Whenever me and daddy hide here, mommy can never find us and always has to tell us to come out.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Daddy's even hidden a load of cool stuff here like snacks, wine, and even some Mora! Daddy says I'm not supposed to tell mommy about that part though.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' But then this one time just as daddy was leaving the house, he went and told mommy about all the places where he was hiding stuff anyway.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' But whatever, some of the stuff that goes on between mommies and daddies isn't meant for kids to understand. Let's keep playing, shall we?
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Okay, this time I'm gonna go to... my ultimate hiding place! You'll never find me there.
:{{DIcon}} Okay.
:;(4th hide-and-seek challenge starts)
:{{DIcon}} Actually, I need a break.
:;(Dialogue ends, talking again repeats from the previous line)
----
;(If you fail the 4th hide-and-seek challenge)
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Hmm... Well, this is the ultimate hiding place, I guess.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Okay, a hint: I'm hiding {{Color|buzzword|by the cliff}}. Look carefully!
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Let's give it another go.
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
:;(4th hide-and-seek challenge starts)
:{{DIcon}} I need a break.
:;(Dialogue ends, talking again repeats the hint)

;(If you fail the 4th hide-and-seek challenge for the second time)
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Still can't find me... Alright, I guess you're allowed another clue.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' The clue is: Look further {{Color|buzzword|south}}.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Got it? Let's try again, you should be able to find me this time.
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
:;(4th hide-and-seek challenge starts)
:{{DIcon}} I need a break.
:;(Dialogue ends, talking again repeats the hint)

;(If you fail the 4th hide-and-seek challenge for the third time)
:'''Childish Jiang:''' My ultimate hiding place is even better than I thought. Seems like you'll never find me there...
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Since you're having so much trouble finding me... Try looking by the {{Color|buzzword|big cliff at the south}}
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Hee-hee... Who knows what you might find there &mdash; maybe me!
:{{DIcon}} Nah, I'm fine.
:;(4th hide-and-seek challenge starts, without any timer)
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, I need a rest.
:;(Dialogue ends, talking again repeats the hint)

;(Talk to Childish Jiang in his 4th hiding spot)
:'''Childish Jiang:''' You found me! Hehehe...
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Looks like this was kinda hard work for you.
:{{DIcon}} I managed...
::'''Childish Jiang:''' It's okay, there's no shame in admitting you found this a tough challenge. It is the ultimate hiding place, after all.
:{{DIcon}} It was a little tough.
::'''Childish Jiang:''' Haha, well, this is the ultimate hiding place after all. It's normal that finding it was a challenge.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Even Mommy's never found this place. One day, she suddenly said she wanted to play hide-and-seek with me, with me as the hider and her as the seeker.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' So I went to a special hiding place that daddy once told me about, and sure enough she couldn't find me at all. Then, I heard loads of people walking up the mountain...
:'''Childish Jiang:''' I thought it must've been Mommy getting all her friends to help look for me. So I hid even further inside.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' After a few days, she still hadn't found me. I thought she might be worried, and I was also a little hungry... so I came out. But she still didn't find me.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Maybe Mommy got mad because I was so well hidden that she couldn't find me? Still... I'd have thought that Mommy or Daddy would've found me by now, after such a long time...
:'''Childish Jiang:''' But anyway, thanks for playing with me for so long. Mommy and Daddy always said I shouldn't take up too much of other people's time, and that when I get somebody to do something for me. I should always repay them.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' So here you go, take these. They're from the hiding place that Daddy picked out for me.
:'''Childish Jiang:''' This one time, a guy brought some food for me, and I wanted to repay him too, but he wouldn't take it. I have no idea why...
:'''Childish Jiang:''' Okay, I'm going home. You can carry on with your other stuff now.
