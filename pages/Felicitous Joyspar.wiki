'''Felicitous Joyspar''' is a [[Gadget]] obtained during the [[Secret Summer Paradise]] event by collecting 270 [[Joyeux Voucher]]s. Upon activation, the Felicitous Joyspar will reveal all Joyeux Vouchers and [[Fascinating Chest]]s containing them on the overworld map. The gadget has a 60-second cooldown between uses.

==Gameplay Notes==
*The Felicitous Joyspar replaces the [[Flowing Joyspar]] upon redeeming the 270 Joyeux Vouchers.
*The message "All Joyeux Vouchers have been marked" will appear if the Felicitous Joyspar is activated when all Joyeux Vouchers have been obtained. The 60 cooldown will also still persist when the gadget is activated.
