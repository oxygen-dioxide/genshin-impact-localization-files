==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
:'''Homayun:''' If the present rainforest could not fight off pollution, we could only try to change the surrounding environment...
:'''Homayun:''' Gotta go to the [[House of Daena]] and request some previous research... Or go ask [[Rifaet]].

;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
:'''Homayun:''' We cannot rest on our laurels even though the pollution of the rainforest has decreased...
:'''Homayun:''' I must go to the House of Daena and request to requisition some previous research... Or go ask Rifaet.

:{{DIcon}} What are you thinking about?
:;(Before completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
::'''Homayun:''' [[The Withering]] has always been one of the tough issues that [[Amurta]] wanted to conquer.
::'''Homayun:''' It is true that while vision holders and forest rangers are working together to control the zones, the Withering won't impact Sumeru people's daily lives all too much.
::'''Homayun:''' But beyond dealing with the symptoms, we researchers want to cure the cause.
::'''Homayun:''' To this end, I've always wanted the Scribe to sort through the latest rainforest reports from the researchers.
::'''Homayun:''' The Scribe is only responsible for documenting their findings, but he'd be able to discern any anomalies with his keen eyes...
:{{DIcon}} What are you thinking about?
:;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
::'''Homayun:''' Rainforest life is among the foremost concerns of the Amurta.
::'''Homayun:''' Although the taint caused by the Withering has been greatly alleviated, no one can say for sure that no new problems will arise.
::'''Homayun:''' To this end, I've always wanted [[Alhaitham|the Scribe]] to sort through the latest rainforest reports from the researchers.
::'''Homayun:''' The Scribe is mainly responsible for documenting their findings, true. But I reckon he'd be able to discern any anomalies in those writings with his keen eyes...
:{{DIcon}} About Rifaet...
::'''Homayun:''' Oh? He's a very knowledgeable young researcher. He's not very articulate, but he's familiar with all kinds of literature. Have you heard of him?
::{{DIcon}} I've heard of him...
:::'''Homayun:''' How rare. He's been absorbed in research and barely shows up around here.
:::'''Homayun:''' If it weren't for the fact that he's a candidate for the next [[Grand Conservator]], even fewer young researchers would know about him.
::{{DIcon}} Never heard of him...
:::'''Homayun:''' Well, he's been absorbed in research and barely shows up around here. That [[Vikram]] always steals the limelight.
:::'''Homayun:''' If it weren't for the fact that he's a candidate for the next Grand Conservator, not many would have heard his name.
::'''Homayun:''' I prefer him though, compared to that Vikram fellow. Rifaet is more like a researcher in my opinion.
::'''Homayun:''' But I don't know what those sages think. After all, they're the ones who have the final say.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Homayun:''' Okay, goodbye.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Event Dialogue==
===A Parade of Providence===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Homayun:''' Even if we find a calm place to think, we will inevitably be interrupted by noisy students.
:'''Homayun:''' To be honest, I was never interested in these celebratory events or competitions when I was in the Akademiya.
:'''Homayun:''' Winning the Championship doesn't really help add any credit to your research, and any renown gained from it only amounts to some short-lived attention.
:'''Homayun:''' ...Realistically speaking, there are few people as practical as I am.
