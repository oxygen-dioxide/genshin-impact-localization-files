'''Executor's Thorns''' is [[Rosaria]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Rosaria wears a form-fitting nun's habit consisting of a long white and black coif with red lining, a white sleeveless turtleneck top, long white gloves, and a long black and red slit skirt that partially reveals her right leg and completely reveals her left. She wears black belts around her left thigh, along with black fishnet tights and silver high-heels.

Rosaria's outfit is adorned with multiple silver and white gold accessories embedded with red gems; including a silver tiara on top of her coif, a silver pendant on her white top, a white gold brooch on her left shoulder and left hip, multiple silver claw rings on her fingers and a small silver censer tied to her right wrist with a long piece of black cloth. Her {{Cryo}} [[Vision]] hangs off of her waist on her lower back.
