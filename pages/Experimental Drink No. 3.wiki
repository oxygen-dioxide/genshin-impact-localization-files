'''Experimental Drink No. 3''' is a [[Quest Item]] obtainable from the {{Quest|Time to Drink}}.

==How to Obtain==
Experimental Drink No. 3 can be obtained from ''Time to Drink'' by choosing the following dialogue options in the respective encounters in the {{Quest|Refreshing Fonta, a Font of Refreshment!}}:
* First Encounter: "Just add it, I reckon that a little saltiness will do us good."
* Second Encounter: "I'd like to try uncarbonated Fonta out."
* Third Encounter: "I think we should keep Fonta in its original state."
Subsequent encounters of ''Refreshing Fonta, a Font of Refreshment!'' past the third do not affect which [[Experimental Drink]] is obtained.
