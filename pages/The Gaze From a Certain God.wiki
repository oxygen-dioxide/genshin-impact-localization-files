{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the entrance to Gandharva Ville)
:{{A|vo xmaq102 1 tashfin 01.ogg}} '''Tashfin:''' Hold it right there.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 1 tashfin 02.ogg}} '''Tashfin:''' A {{MC|m=blond|f=blonde}}-haired traveler and a floating fairy... We've got you, alright. Take a look around &mdash; you've fallen right into our trap.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! Are you mercenaries from the Corps of Thirty? Did you come here to arrest us?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 1 tashfin 03.ogg}} '''Tashfin:''' Corps of Thirty? We're nothing like those government lapdogs who don't even get scraps for their work.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 1 tashfin 04.ogg}} '''Tashfin:''' We are an elite brigade that commands the highest commission rate in all of Sumeru. We're here on the orders of a client known only as "The Outcast."
:{{A|vo xmaq102 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "The Outcast"... An outcast from the Akademiya?
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like The Doctor.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But why wouldn't The Doctor just send the Fatui after us?
:{{DIcon}} Local mercenaries might have an edge over the Fatui.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe he's taking advantage of the Akademiya's resources.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 1 tashfin 05.ogg}} '''Tashfin:''' Hmph, still wasting time on idle chit-chat? We'll shut you up soon enough. Get them!
:{{A|vo xmaq102 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're up, (Traveler)!

;(After defeating the second wave of Eremites)
:{{A|vo xmaq102 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh, it isn't over yet, (Traveler)! Here come reinforcements!

;(After defeating the third wave of Eremites)
:{{A|vo xmaq102 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That was pretty rough... Is that what elite mercenaries are like?
:{{DIcon}} It probably won't be long before we see more of them.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, looks like we'll have to keep our guards up.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But this Doctor guy seems like a pretty tough opponent... He knew exactly where to set up an ambush. Did he predict that we would try to find Tighnari?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, going up against smart people is tough... Anyway, let's keep going.
----
;(Approach Collei)
:{{A|vo xmaq102 3 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh, it's the Traveler and Paimon! What are you two doing back here?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[Collei]], it's nice to see you again! Are you doing alright?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 3 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I... To be honest, I'm not doing too well. My Eleazar has been progressing at a faster rate lately. I'm finding it harder to complete more intricate tasks.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 3 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' As a result, Master Tighnari has taken me off the patrol schedule. He will only allow me to stay here and coordinate other people's tasks.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Collei...
:{{DIcon}} It seems that curing Irminsul is our only chance...
:{{A|vo xmaq102 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Speaking of Tighnari, did he go off on patrol? We're here to talk to him!
:{{A|vo xmaq102 3 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh, Master Tighnari? He just left the [[Avidya Forest]] a little while ago. He was headed to [[Pardis Dhyai]].
:{{A|vo xmaq102 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, he left? But... isn't Tighnari always saying that he never wants to leave the Avidya Forest? He even turned down the sages' invitation.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 3 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I thought it was weird, too... Master Tighnari always prioritizes his work as a Forest Watcher above everything. He almost never leaves his post. He left in a hurry this time, though...
:{{A|vo xmaq102 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He didn't give a reason?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 3 collei 06.ogg}} '''Collei:''' No, I only found out that he left through a message he left behind. He also made sure to delegate all his tasks using a schedule.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 3 collei 07.ogg}} '''Collei:''' To leave in such a hurry... I'd guess he had something urgent to take care of.
:'''Paimon:''' You mentioned that he was going to Pardis Dhyai... What kind of place is that?<ref group="Note">This line does not exist at all when playing through this quest. However, it appears in the Travel Log.</ref>
:{{A|vo xmaq102 3 collei 08.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Hm... Master Tighnari originally studied in the [[Amurta]] [[Darshan]] of the Akademiya, and Pardis Dhyai is something like the Amurta's research base. Many rare shrubs and grasses have been planted there for research.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 3 collei 09.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I know that before he became a Forest Watcher, Master Tighnari once spent a long time conducting research at Pardis Dhyai.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A research base, huh... Gotta wonder what kind of research Tighnari just decided to work on all of a sudden...
:{{A|vo xmaq102 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Traveler), we don't have a lot of time, so let's go look for him at Pardis Dhyai.
:{{DIcon}} Please take care of yourself, Collei.
:{{DIcon}} Don't push yourself too hard, Collei.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 3 collei 10.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Ah... Don't worry, I'm fine. I'm used to living with Eleazar by now! If you run into Master Tighnari, please send him my regards.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Got it, will do! See you later, Collei!

;(Talk to Collei again)
:{{A|vo dialog xmaq102 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I had already made up my mind to be honest with you, so I didn't try to hide my current condition... Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.
----
;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, look who it is...!
:{{DIcon}} Nahida!
:{{DIcon}} Katheryne!
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thank goodness, you're okay! We were so worried about you...
:{{DIcon}} You ARE Nahida, right?
:{{DIcon}} You haven't been reprogrammed by The Doctor, have you?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey (Traveler)! This was supposed to be a touching reunion, but you're ruining the moment!
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Actually, it's very smart of the Traveler to be wary of me right now. After all, The Doctor has shown that his technology can apparently even control human minds...
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Plus, it's not like you could've known what happened after we split up, and I was facing The Doctor by myself.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Even a pool of stagnant water after a torrential storm can occasionally pass as a patch of sky.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... Paimon feels like only the real Nahida could come up with such an obscure analogy.
:{{DIcon}} I agree.
:{{DIcon}} I believe you.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Huh? But I wasn't trying to win your trust or anything. All I wanted was to clarify my point...
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, we understand that point now! Please, Nahida, tell us more about what happened. Are those poor people alright?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' When you left, I was still in the middle of restoring everyone's minds. Thankfully, when The Doctor mentioned "depositing information into the subconscious," he didn't mean engraving information into their minds...
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...Instead, he did something closer to creating hallucinations. That was still within my power to fix.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Luckily, I managed to finish my restorations and mind-jump away from him just as he was about to capture me.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew, what a relief... The Doctor sure pulled out some hidden cards, but good thing we had Nahida with us...
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I wouldn't be relieved just yet.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I gave away my true identity when I restored everyone's minds, which means we've lost another one of our trump cards.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Also... The Doctor is already an expert at modifying Akasha Terminals. Maybe it's only a matter of time until he captures my consciousness inside the Akasha.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Would that mean you'd no longer be able to jump between minds? Then, how do we stop him... He's still at the Akademiya, so it's possible he's already started messing with the Akasha...
:{{DIcon}} We need to hurry.
:{{DIcon}} Our position will only get worse with time.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Argh, it feels like he's toying with us! What a nasty piece of work!
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Plus, The Doctor's combat ability alone is apparently enough to make him worthy of being number two of the Fatui...
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' We shouldn't give up hope just yet. Let's try to find another way to attack this problem.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Actually, Nahida, how did you know we were trying to get to Pardis Dhyai? Have you been waiting for us?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Yes, I have. I can see (Traveler)'s Elemental Energy, so I deduced your destination by looking at the direction you were moving in.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' You didn't come here for sightseeing, right? Did you find any leads?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're looking for a scholar we know! His name is Tighnari, and the sages once tried to reach out to him. Why don't you come inside with us and see what we can find?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 4 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Okay. Let's just hope we won't get him into trouble...

;(Approach Haypasia)<!--time auto change to day-->
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 haypasia 01.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Traveler? It is you!
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! It's [[Haypasia]]!
:{{DIcon}} Long time no see!
:{{DIcon}} Didn't expect to run into you here.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 haypasia 02.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Ahh, what a pleasant surprise! It's so nice to see the two of you again.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Who's this...?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She's a scholar we met in the Avidya Forest! When we last saw each other, she was still training in the uh, what's it called... "Satyavada Life"?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Oh... I see.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 haypasia 03.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' That's right, we're old friends! You've come at just the right time. Ever since I've come here, hardly anyone has even talked to me.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Haypasia, you're way too excited about this! Actually, for you to leave the Avidya Forest means... you're not in training anymore?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, no... Did you already finish your training and reach [[Paripurna Life]]?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 haypasia 04.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Hehehe... What do you think?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 haypasia 05.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' My consciousness... has already managed to make contact with the divine.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' ...Hmm?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You did it!? Congratulations!
:{{DIcon}} I'm really happy for you.
:{{DIcon}} You're truly amazing!
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 haypasia 06.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Haha, it's so exhilarating to share this sublime joy with others at long last!
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 haypasia 07.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' When my consciousness made contact with the gods... What a supreme and unparalleled experience that was...
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That sounds incredible...
:{{DIcon}} Actually, we're here for Tighnari...
:{{DIcon}} We're in a hurry, so let's chat about this next time.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 haypasia 08.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Oh, alright... Actually, please wait &mdash; I haven't forgotten my promise to you.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 haypasia 09.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Remember? I promised to help you understand what you saw from Irminsul once I gained deeper insights.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 haypasia 10.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' My current self has not only gained true insight, but I can even help you establish a direct connection to the consciousness of the divine!
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Y&mdash;You can do that?
:{{DIcon}} Do you believe her, Nahida?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I've never heard of anything like that, but... if you want to give it a try, I'll do my best to protect your consciousness during the process.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 haypasia 11.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Hold on, I've brought some Spirit Borneol with me. This is still a crucial part of the ceremony.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, we're using that incense again?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 haypasia 12.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Alright, now... hold my hand. I'll help you establish a pathway to connect your consciousness.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Okay.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 5 haypasia 13.ogg}} '''Haypasia:''' Ready?

:{{DIcon}} It's me...
:{{DIcon}} What just happened?

:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' After that... Tighnari heard the commotion and came over. He helped us defeat the mercenaries, and then he ran with us all the way here.
:{{DIcon}} This time, she didn't just transfer her mind into my body...
:{{DIcon}} Our minds swapped places.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? You swapped places? You mean, your consciousness also went into Nahida's body?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, then where is Nahida's consciousness? Where is she now...?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I never imagined that an individual's consciousness could be transferred around like this... Had I not seen it with my own eyes, I would have never believed it. I don't think this can be achieved with current human technology...
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Also, (Traveler), while we were running, the consciousness in your body told me to pass on a message. She said:
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' "The Doctor has found a way to trap my consciousness, so I can't journey with you anymore."

:{{DIcon}} We can't let The Doctor figure out what we're up to.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that makes sense! Since The Doctor captured her, she won't be able to say anything without him knowing. She's being extra careful...
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Even in a moonless night, a shower of starlight can still drown out illusions and lies..."

:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Didn't Nahida use a "starlight" analogy before? It had something to do with Setaria...
:{{DIcon}} "The Moon" refers to Nahida herself.
:{{DIcon}} "Starlight" refers to the people of the desert.
:{{DIcon}} "Illusions and lies" refer to the Akademiya's plans.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohhh! That makes a lot of sense. Do you think Nahida was telling us to go find help in the desert?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But she isn't with us anymore... Think we'll be okay?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 tighnari 06.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Paimon... you said Sanctuary of Surasthana? Does this mean that this "Nahida" you're talking about, the consciousness who was occupying (Traveler)'s body... is... the Dendro Archon?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Your guess is correct, but the situation's a bit complicated, so it's really hard for us to explain right now...
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 tighnari 07.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' That's alright. A scholar's curiosity doesn't need to be appeased right away. As for the complicated nature of the situation... Safe to say, I have witnessed that for myself.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 tighnari 08.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I've spent some time with you, and it looks like the Dendro Archon's also on your side, so... I trust you.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thank you, Tighnari! Oh, actually, we came here to ask you a question. What do you know about the project that the sages have been working on?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 tighnari 09.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Ah, that... While I was indeed invited to join that project, the sages were always secretive about its scope and goals, so I eventually declined.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 tighnari 10.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' All I know is that that project has something to do with the restoration of Irminsul.
:{{DIcon}} I think I know what the project is about.
:{{DIcon}} I just received some new intel.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh? Did you see something when you were in Nahida's body?
:{{DIcon}} The Akademiya is... turning The Balladeer into a god.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 tighnari 11.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' ...Do you have any evidence?
:{{DIcon}} I saw a "nascent god" under construction.
:{{DIcon}} Haypasia also showed us a so-called divine consciousness...
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 tighnari 12.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' ...

:'''You describe what you saw when you exchanged consciousnesses with Nahida...'''

:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 tighnari 13.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Hm, so that's what happened... That explains why Haypasia's symptoms were different from those of the other scholars who went mad. It's because she made contact with the consciousness of a new god who is still in the process of being born...
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Tighnari, did you leave the Avidya Forest because of Haypasia?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 tighnari 14.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I did. I noticed Haypasia's mental anomalies, but since her symptoms were rather atypical, I secretly took her to Pardis Dhyai, and began searching for a way to return her to her normal self.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 tighnari 15.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' If I didn't take action, Haypasia would have already been taken by the matra to the desert, doomed to a life of exile at [[Aaru Village]].
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 tighnari 16.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Now that you mention it, I knew the Akademiya has never thought particularly highly of Lesser Lord Kusanali, but...
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 tighnari 17.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' ...But I still didn't expect them to do something as arrogant as creating a new god. Looks like I made the right decision by not accepting their invitation.
:{{DIcon}} The Fatui is also behind some of this.
:{{DIcon}} The Fatui may have fanned the flames.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 tighnari 18.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' The Doctor and The Balladeer... We have two Fatui Harbingers in Sumeru... Sounds like we're in for a bad time.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 tighnari 19.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' From your description, I don't think they've completed their project. There may still be room for us to intervene.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 tighnari 20.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' But then, what is the connection between creating a new god and restoring Irminsul...?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, it feels like we're still nowhere close to figuring out the sages' goals...
:{{DIcon}} Let's head to the desert for now.
:{{DIcon}} We must stop them no matter what.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right. We've pretty much gone over everything we need to know, so we should head out... How about you, Tighnari? What are you going to do?
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 tighnari 21.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I'll stay here for now. I still want to try a few more things to help Haypasia.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 tighnari 22.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' If you're planning to go into the desert, start by heading for [[Caravan Ribat]]. That'll be your fastest route.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 tighnari 23.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Come find me here if there's anything else I can do to help. May the spirit of wisdom go with you.
:{{A|vo xmaq102 6 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thanks, Tighnari! Hopefully Haypasia will feel better soon! We're off, then.
