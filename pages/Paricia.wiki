==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Paricia:''' The ocean is like a giant sapphire gem.
:{{DIcon}} It should sell for a good price.
::'''Paricia:''' Ah, I bet it'd go for a fortune.
::'''Paricia:''' Moreover, different regions of the ocean have different shapes and colors. If we could cut the gem by the directions of the current, or even flip those directions around...
::'''Paricia:''' Ah, my apologies. My thoughts just kind of took off on their own. It's hard to get out of the mindset of a gemstone merchant.
::'''Paricia:''' I love gemstones just as much as I love the sea. It's pretty difficult to strike a balance between the two.
::'''Paricia:''' Thankfully, I've got a regular business partner here, so I can come over here as often as I want.
:{{DIcon}} Seeya.
::'''Paricia:''' See you.
