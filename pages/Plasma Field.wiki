'''Plasma Field''' is a [[Ley Line Disorder]] that deals elemental damage to players outside of it. It was first introduced with the [[Energy Amplifier Initiation]] event.

Plasma Field can also take the form of an aura. When the player is discovered by an enemy with this aura, if they are not on the rune created by it, they will take {{Color|Electro DMG}}.

==Notes==
*Intermittently leaving and entering the Plasma Field helps prevent the build-up of static electric charge and thus stops {{Color|Electro DMG}} altogether.
