|description    = A short bamboo fence that is often seen around [[Dihua Marsh]].<br />Bamboo rafts are a key method of transporting goods within Liyue's borders, and the traffic of such rafts up and down the [[Bishui River]] is a practice that has persisted for a long time indeed. Rafts that are nearing the end of their lifespan will be broken down and repurposed as fences of this kind. Waste not, want not.
