'''Dragonfall''' is a rare ore used for forging formed from [[Elemental Reactions]].

It first appeared in a great battle between [[Azhdaha]] and [[Morax]] in [[The Chasm]] millennia ago. The fighting created a specific type of elemental crystals dubbed Dragonfall, which were then used to forge items later on. Centuries before the present, they were "mined into obscurity."

In the present, [[Kun Jun]] had suddenly gained an interest in finding Dragonfall, although he did not initially understand why he was looking for it, and hoped that finding some of the ore would help him remember.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|No Mere Stone}}</ref> In truth, he had been possessed by Azhdaha's good half, and he was trying to remember his goal of assisting Morax, now [[Zhongli]], in resealing himself.
