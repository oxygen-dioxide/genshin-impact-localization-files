==Personality==
{{Quote|Lady Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine also serves as the editor-in-chief of Yae Publishing House. Unimaginable intelligence and cunning are hidden under her beautiful appearance.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}

Miko has a mysterious demeanor around her whenever she assumes her duties as the Guuji of the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]]. When she assumes her duties as the boss of the [[Yae Publishing House]], she is known to be very kind and enjoys reading books and stories,<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Kano Nana}}</ref> although she also shows an obsessive side in making profits at the same time. She has an enigmatic air around her, with her friends growing used to it.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Raiden Shogun|About Yae Miko}}</ref> When speaking with outsiders or close friends, she shows a blunter and more cynical side to her. Miko does not mince words, even towards her friend and master [[Ei]]. Being a kitsune, Miko is fond of fried tofu. She despises pickled foods of all sorts.

As a kitsune and youkai, she's very mischievous, including in her roles as Guuji and owner of Yae Publishing House. She couples this mischievous streak with impressive skills of manipulation and reading people. As such her tricks and pranks are usually elaborate, long-winded affairs towards rather simple ends, which she does out of enjoyment and the fact that she enjoys watching people squirm.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Yae Miko|Miko's Hobbies}}</ref> Both [[Thoma]] and [[Gorou]] are such unfortunate victims that they're easily terrified upon seeing her. If not partaking in such affairs, she shows interest in those who get her attention.

She is one of Ei's only friends who survived the ravages of time. She tends to call the Shogun by her true name, Ei. Ei herself also calls Miko by her first name, signifying their closeness and friendship.

Despite her light-hearted, mischievous personality, she showed a more emotional side during the [[Hyakkiyakou]], indicating that she does genuinely care for those in her life and has considered thousands of youkai from across Inazuma to be her friends. Though in typical fashion for her, she quickly turns the Traveler and Paimon's sympathy into opportunity to trick them into paying for an expensive dinner.

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3 paragraphs with 3-4 sentences each. -->
In her regular form, Miko has purple eyes and long, muted pink hair that is tied at the bottom. She also has fox ears, while notably lacking a tail in this form,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|What Shall We Do?}}</ref> they briefly appear as a set of five translucent tails when she uses [[Great Secret Art: Tenko Kenshin]], or one when she uses [[Yakan Evocation: Sesshou Sakura]] or when performing a [[Plunging Attack]]. Miko wears a unique and stylized variation of clothing inspired by the colors of a shrine priestess' traditional outfit. She wears a golden head accessory accompanied by matching golden earrings. The right earring contains an Electro Inazuman Vision wrapped in a complex drop-shaped piece and decorated by a small fan-shaped accessory at the bottom. The earrings are attached to her ears by diamond-shaped studs.

Being a kitsune, Miko also has a fox form, although she refuses to reveal it to the Traveler.

{{Quote|"I have witnessed the Kitsune's majesty in the moonlit forest. She has a myriad of forms, revealing the unknown and the unseen... just as how fate shines on me and the endless world."|[[Ei]]}}

The [[Grand Narukami Shrine]]'s head shrine maiden and a descendant of Kitsune lineage, [[Raiden Shogun|Eternity]]'s servant and friend... and the intimidating editor-in-chief of [[Yae Publishing House]], a publisher of light novels.

There's no need to uncover her every facet, as they are all reflective of Yae Miko. Yet, all the same, they are not revealing of her true nature.

Like fragments of a mirror, each attitude reflects a different version of her. By being enveloped in many identities, she has become a brilliant diamond surrounded by countless mirrors.

There are hundreds of facets: solemn or cheerful, sympathetic or aloof.

No one knows the truth, just as how no one can easily spot a kitsune brushing past passers-by in the mystic woods.

But if the kitsune watches humans, where will her destiny lead?

Well, I did ask him to write on this topic, yes, but isn't this the hot genre of the day?"</p><p>Faced with the editor's doubtful gaze, Miko gave her opinion forthrightly: that a book that should have been interesting yet was shackled at every turn by the topic was, simply put, "not free enough."</p><p>Things like "top sellers," "genre fiction," these were naught but fads that would come and go every decade.</p><p>Getting with the times was a shortcut, yes, but if a work had the quality that could surmount this tide, why go with the flow nonetheless?</p><p>"Pass this message to this new author of ours: tell him that there's no need to bother about genre. He just needs to write his story and write it well."</p><p>Upon hearing this, the author stopped writing for a time, as if suddenly having an epiphany. Several months later, a new manuscript was sent to Miko and her editors.</p><p>The latter were stunned, and even Yae Miko, who cared little about taboos, furrowed her brows slightly — a rare sight indeed.</p><p>"Um... What do we do? This isn't good..."</p><p>"Exactly! I mean, there's 'not being concerned about genre, and then there's something like 'Shogun Almighty: Reborn as Raiden'... This is just too much!"</p><p>"Hmm? Genre? No, no, there's no problem with that — it's his pen name I'm worried about. It's too normal for a book like this."</p><p>"Huh, so that was what you were concerned about... No, uh, never mind. As long as you're happy, Lady Yae."</p><p>Not long after, the author of this book would take to the literary stage with the Yae Miko-approved (and overly long) pen name "[[Kadenokouji Kenzaburou]]."</p><p>As to how the editor-in-chief got the idea to start a "Reborn as Guuji Yae" writing submission event, that would be a tale for another day.</p>

As the years fly by, boredom becomes the greatest foe.</p><p>And if even she were, archon-forbid, one day to accept sitting quietly still, obstinate as deadwood, would the world now sorely lack for another clever person adept at discovering fun and grasping opportunity?</p><p>As such, looking for fun things to do in every nook and cranny can only be the most reasonable and necessary course.</p><p>And if she were to, say, utilize her authority as Guuji in making fun things happen — why, some things are unavoidable, are they not?</p><p>On the day of the festival, Guuji Yae would nod in satisfaction as she received a delivery of fireworks from the [[Yashiro Commission]] — of [[Naganohara Fireworks|Naganohara]] construction and specially-made to boot.</p><p>That night's ceremony was, of course, performed with perfect respect to all etiquette and rites.</p><p>The sight of the "Lady Guuji" kneeling gracefully the whole night through would be the object of awe for all the other shrine maidens.</p><p>In the meantime, she would sit beneath the meteor shower of light adorning the skies, watching the festival-goers as they came and went.</p><p>And the din of the fireworks covered the mumbling that came between teeth chewing on a candy apple.</p><p>"You know, when you asked me to become Guuji, you never mentioned that I'd only ever be able to sneak outside to watch the festivities from then on."</p>

* Yae Miko is one of the characters with ornaments that glow. {{Transclude|Miko's Instruction|Glowing Ornaments|section=1}}
* In the ''Genshin Impact'' 2020 New Years tweet, Miko welcomed [[Kamisato Ayaka]] to her shrine as the first guest of the year.
* While the Chinese, Japanese, and French official introductions for Zhongli featured a quote from [[Raiden Ei]] to Yae Miko, the English equivalent tweet left Miko's name out.<ref name="ZL">Twitter: [https://twitter.com/Genshin_7/status/1330722557574537219 Zhongli's JP introduction]</ref>
* Miko is younger than Ganyu. In her debut in the Chinese version of the Version 1.5 Special Program, she refers to Ganyu as {{zh|甘雨姐姐|Gānyǔ-jiějie}},<ref name="CN 1.5 SP">Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV17y4y147fa Version 1.5 Special Program (Chinese)]</ref> wherein {{zh|姐姐|jiějie}} is a term used that literally means "older sister" but is generally used for any older female, even if they are not blood-related.
** Based on ''[[New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune (V)]]'', Miko was a young girl 500 years ago, which is when the [[cataclysm]] occurred and the [[Kitsune Saiguu]] died. In contrast, Ganyu participated in the Archon War over 2,000 years ago<ref>{{Ref/CS|Ganyu|Vision}}</ref> and is also suggested to have lived in the [[Guili Assembly]],<ref>{{Ref/CS|Ganyu|3}}</ref> which fell 3,700 years ago.
* Miko is a [[kitsune]] from the [[Hakushin Clan]] and possesses a fox form. In Japanese mythology, {{w|kitsune}} are spiritual fox-like creatures with a reputation for cleverness. Befitting Miko's close ties with the Raiden Shogun, the God of Eternity, mythological kitsune are believed to live for thousands of years and symbolize eternity.
** While Miko calls herself a Sky Kitsune, or [https://yokai.com/tenko/ Tenko], based on her age and number of tails she has (five), Miko would only be the rank of Kiko in kitsune society with Ashireiko being the lowest and Tenko being the highest according to Japanese folklore.

** Both are {{w|miko}} associated with foxes.
** Yae Sakura is of Japanese origin, while Inazuma is Japanese-themed.
** They are both voiced by Du Mingya in Chinese and Ayane Sakura in Japanese.
* While performing her normal uncharged attacks, Miko does not use her equipped Catalyst, instead using her gohei staff.
* Yae Miko may have studied under the onmyouji [[Kamuna Harunosuke]] (who was closely acquainted with the Kitsune Saiguu), the inventor of Onmyoudou; the Chinese and Japanese names of her [[Spiritfox Sin-Eater|Normal Attack]] contain the term ''shiki'' ("law," "ceremony," or "formula"), which can mean {{w|shikigami}} (Onmyoudou familiars) in the context of mystic arts.
* Yae Miko is known by these aliases or titles:
** Guuji Yae
** Lady Yae
** Fox Lady (by [[Akira]] and [[Mamoru]])
** Fried Tofu with All the Frills (pen name in correspondences with [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]])
* During ''[[The Almighty Arataki Great and Glorious Drumalong Festival]]'', Yae Miko signs a message with the name "Ramen Buddy."
