==Profile==
Toraemon and his brother Kunihiko, were adopted by a practitioner of the Iwakura Arts. They, alongside Arashi, trained under [[Eiin|Master Eiin]], the Soushu of the Iwakura Clan at the time. Toraemon and Arashi both reached the Menkyo Kaiden rank, the second-highest rank in the clan, though Kunihiko never moved beyond Souken, the lowest known rank.

Sometime after [[Iwakura Mitsunari]] succeeded as Soushu of the Iwakura Clan, the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] was proclaimed. Mitsunari's [[Vision]] was one of those confiscated, and Mitsunari decided to join the [[Shogunate]] forces. Toraemon and Arashi apparently vocally disapproved of the decision, leading Mitsunari to expel them.

Upon hearing about a certain [[Traveler]] who had gone around slaying the other practitioners of the Iwakura Arts, Toraemon and Arashi gathered their swords, besides [[Iwakura Mitsunari]]'s, to build a memorial for them. The Traveler encounters them at Byakko Plain, at the same place where Kunihiko was slain. Once the two acknowledge that the Traveler is the very one whom they sought revenge on, they force the Traveler into a battle, only to meet the same fate as their fellow disciples. The Traveler then takes their swords and adds them to the memorial, spawning a [[Luxurious Chest]].

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Okazaki Toraemon:''' ...now, the blade of Iwakura Kouin is the only thing we're missing.
:'''Yanagiha Arashi:''' The ancestral [[Hakuen Michimitsu Amenoma]] of the Iwakura Clan, huh... Say, do you remember, when you and Kunihiko were first adopted, while Master Eiin wasn't looking...
:'''Okazaki Toraemon:''' We have already been expelled. There's no need to call him "Master."
:'''Yanagiha Arashi:''' But Okazaki...
:'''Yanagiha Arashi:''' "When you weigh affection against righteousness on a scale, a real swordsman must walk the path of righteousness."
:'''Yanagiha Arashi:''' Since Master said so, it means he was not willing to expel us, but had no other choice.<ref group="Note">The English phrasing can be a bit confusing here, as the title "Master" is used for Nagatane earlier. This Master refers to Iwakura Mitsunari, the Soushu at the time the Vision Hunt Decree was enacted.</ref>
:'''Okazaki Toraemon:''' Of course he was unwilling. But since he has already decided to become the sword of the Shogun and carry out the Vision Hunt Decree, then we can only...
:'''Yanagiha Arashi:''' We can only choose our own righteous path. After all, "a real swordsman must walk the path of righteousness."
:'''Yanagiha Arashi:''' And yet, Master's own righteousness was defeated in the end.
:'''Okazaki Toraemon:''' That's right. We must avenge them all. Kunihiko, the others &mdash; even Iwakura Kouin.
:'''Okazaki Toraemon:''' Such is the righteousness of expelled disciples like ourselves.
:'''Yanagiha Arashi:''' This must also be Master's blessing. Our first object of vengeance came to us, just like that.
:'''Okazaki Toraemon:''' You are right. You must be (Traveler). I've heard about your story.
:'''Okazaki Toraemon:''' In the world of swordsmen, only blood can cleanse blood. I assume you are prepared to face the Ex-Iwakura Art Menkyo Kaiden?

;(The Traveler fights against "Expelled Crimson Oni - Okazaki Toraemon" and "Expelled Violet Oni - Yanagiha Arashi")
:'''Yanagiha and Okazaki:''' Ex-Iwakura Art Menkyo Kaiden, we accept your challenge!

;(If Okazaki Toraemon is defeated first)
::'''Menkyo Kaiden Okazaki Toraemon:''' Kunihiko, I am sorry...
::'''Menkyo Kaiden Yanagiha Arashi:''' I will have revenge, Okazaki, for you and your brother both!
:;(Upon defeating Yanagiha Arashi)
::'''Menkyo Kaiden Yanagiha Arashi:''' Like the kiss of snow... So this is the taste of a blade?

;(If Yanagiha Arashi is defeated first)
::'''Menkyo Kaiden Yanagiha Arashi:''' Live on, Okazaki!
::'''Menkyo Kaiden Okazaki Toraemon:''' Go in peace, Yanagiha. I will not be defeated.
:;(Upon defeating Okazaki Toraemon)
::'''Menkyo Kaiden Okazaki Toraemon:''' So my justice... was such a deplorable thing?
