|description    = A simple, unglazed pottery piece. Its patterns were crafted through making use of different clay materials during firing and carving the surface. Because the whole crafting process has been greatly simplified, these bottles are sold at extremely low prices. Its neck might seem broken if you look at its appearance alone, but in fact, the neck was specially designed to conveniently help peel fruits and break the shells of nuts.
