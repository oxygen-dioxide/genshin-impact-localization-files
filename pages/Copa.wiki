{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Copa:''' Youth is to be cherished...
:{{DIcon}} Well, you look pretty young.
::'''Copa:''' Ah, when it comes to age, there's always someone older than me, and always someone younger.
::'''Copa:''' Really, I'm not that old, nor do I lament my age. Have you met that kid named [[Cadmael]]?
::'''Copa:''' He's a few years younger than me, and I'm one of his maternal cousins by relation.
::'''Copa:''' Hasn't been smooth going for that kid lately, I'll tell you what.
::{{DIcon}} Are you worried about him?
:::'''Copa:''' ...Yeah. But some might consider my concern one-sided.
:::'''Copa:''' On the one hand, I hope he doesn't give up on flying tests so easily. After all, he's still young, and it's not as if he's talentless.
:::'''Copa:''' But on the other hand, I don't want him to waste too much time failing and hope he can find a career for himself soon that will bring him a sense of both satisfaction and achievement.
:::'''Copa:''' You see, not even I can wrap my head around such life choices. If I ever figure it out, I'll go give him some guidance.
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
::'''Copa:''' Hmm? Well, let's help big each other up, shall we?
