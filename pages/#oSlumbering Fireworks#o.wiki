|description    = A compact "Launch Tube" that is small and can be placed in almost any flat place. The "Launch Tube" is filled with fireworks beads carefully pre-made by craftsmen and can be set off with a simple operation.<br />The [[Yoimiya|Queen of the Summer Festival]] of [[Hanamizaka]] once said to the children, "The fireworks in the Launch Tube are still sleeping. Only when you wake them up at the right time will they perform a beautiful dance for everyone."<br />After hearing the words of the Queen of the Summer Festival, the children restrained their playfulness and never let off all the fireworks before the festival.
