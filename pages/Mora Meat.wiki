|description     = A large hunk of minced meat packaged inside of a pastry.
|desc_suspicious = The tough pastry shell almost seems to sally out against your teeth as you bite into it. If you fight through the greasiness and only chew on the minced meat, you can sort of taste its flavor.
|desc_basic      = When you split the pastry in two, minced meat spills out. The taste of meat grease is all but gone, and the baking process has brought out the sweetness of the pastry. Such pastries are usually stamped with the word "[[Mora]]," all the better to represent wealth and fortune.
|desc_delicious  = With a crispy crust and tender meat, this legendary delicacy is so succulent that not even Mora laid in front of you could distract you from enjoying it.

Aocang]] during the [[Custodian of Clouds]] quest. <!--Needs confirmation: as well as by scavenging; found one in mingyun village--> Mora Meat can also be purchased from [[Su Er'niang]] or [[Mr. Zhu]] for 430 [[Mora]] (max 10 per day).
