{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Salm:''' Ah, let's try one more time... Kutta, listen to me! Sit!
:'''Kutta:''' (Sits.)
:'''Salm:''' Remember what a [[Sumpter Beast]] is? A large, rotund creature.
:'''Kutta:''' Woof!
:'''Salm:''' And do you remember how many Sumpter Beasts we have?
:'''Kutta:''' Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof... woof?
:'''Salm:''' Wrong again! I told you to include the cubs that were born last month.
:'''Kutta:''' (Wags tail.)
:'''Salm:''' It's no use wagging your tail at me! Wrong answers will get you no treats.
:'''Kutta:''' *whimper*
:'''Salm:''' ...Okay, okay, at least there's been an improvement since the last time. I'll give you a little.
:'''Salm:''' I envy you sometimes. Your only job every day is running around the Sumpter Beasts. Life is so easy for you...
:'''Salm:''' Unlike mine. I work day and night to keep these Sumpter Beasts, and whatever profit I manage to make barely covers the loss from those that run away.
:'''Kutta:''' ?
