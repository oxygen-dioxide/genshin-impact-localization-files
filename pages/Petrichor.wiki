{{Location Intro|description=<p>{{If Self|Petrichor|It|Petrichor}} is a town located on an island in the south of [[Fontaine]]. It is not situated on the continental plate that the rest of Fontaine sits on. The town is known for its beauty<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Tatara Tales (Quest)}}</ref> and its exceedingly pure waters,<ref>{{Ref/Item|Dew of Repudiation}}</ref> and is a popular tourist location to see the massive waterfall that encircles Fontaine.<ref name="Ancient Log">Interactable: [[Ancient Log|Ancient Log #2]]</ref></p>}}

The name Petrichor apparently means "golem" in an ancient language. It is in the vicinity of many ruins and stone statues related to the Golden Troupe of [[Remuria]].<ref name="Ancient Log" /><ref>Interactable: [[Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering Region#The Research Notes of Master Ruggiero|The Research Notes of Master Ruggiero]]</ref>

{{Dialogue Start}}
:I once crossed the layers of clear waters, visiting the corridor beneath the lake.
:And once crossed the boundless valley, reaching the ruined city in the east.
:I once conquered the golden sands blotting out the skies, seizing the treasures of the dead.
:And once conquered the boundless blue, unearthing the buried secrets of deserted islands.
:But the more I obtained, the emptier I felt.
:No amount of treasure could fill the hole in my heart.
:Until I met the great sage [[Ruggiero]],
:Through his teachings, my inner peace was restored.
:I used the wealth accumulated over long years to aid him in rebuilding this town,
:And divided the remainder into four parts, hiding them on this island.

:Facing the heart of the mountains,
:Seeking the eye of the springs,
:Reach the corner's apex,
:Gazing at the distant island of pouring pearls.

:If you want it, then go look for it. The wise will always find the answer.

:Juliano, an ordinary villager

{{Dialogue Start}}
:...

:...As a Treasure Hoarder, I shouldn't be leaving records, but since we recruited through all kinds of different channels for this treasure hunt, we hereby leave this record to prevent an unfair division of the spoils...

:...Our destination is the town of Petrichor, where it is said the secret treasure of the [[Liliacruces Forum|Liliacruces Ordo]] lies, and where the legendary [[Faded Castle]] is said to be located. But more importantly, according to the intel I collected, it's also the final refuge of the legendary bandit Juliano...

:...Utterly baffling. Could a tiny island like that somehow be some kind of bottomless treasure-swallowing pit? Still, no matter what, this time I'm sure we'll find something...

:...The voyage has been going smoothly. To make things easier, I decided to head into town disguised as an adventurer. I hope the rest of the crew can keep their tempers in check...

:(The next few pages are illegible, having been repeatedly scribbled over. In the next legible section, the handwriting seems to be completely different from before.)

:...Ahaha! We made off like bandits this time! Though there were a few wrinkles, we nicked many of the [[Remus|Dark Lord]]'s treasures. Next, we return to our village in the north to recruit soldiers and purchase horses. We'll show those lunatics following [[Erinnyes (NPC)|Erinnyes]] just who has the right to rule the Fontaine to come...

:...How many days have passed? Three? No land to be seen, and nothing but sea fog as far as the eye can see...

:...Has it been ten days, or nine? I can no longer tell. We tossed out most of our supplies to make room for more treasure, and our food is running short...

:...Damnation! None of this is treasure at all, it's nothing but rocks, rocks! What have we done? How did it come to this...

:(The diary ends abruptly.)

==Trivia==
* In the past, [[Carter Scherbius]], [[Mary-Ann]], [[Rene]] and [[Alain Guillotin]], and [[Jakob|Jakob Ingold]] once went to Petrichor for a picnic during their time at the [[Institute of Natural Philosophy]].<ref name="Ancient Log" />
* Petrichor is the hometown of the researcher and filmmaker [[Xavier]].
* [[Félix Yogue]] states that the [[Daydream Club]] gathers in Petrichor, and that two of their members, the brothers [[Mécantre]] and [[Babisse]], are currently staying there.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Félix Yogue}}</ref>
* [[Bossuet]] is currently staying in Petrichor, and [[Sevigne]] wonders why he did not take his portrait "back to Petrichor" from the [[Fontaine Research Institute]].<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Sevigne}}</ref>
* Petrichor might've been named after the Remurian settlement of Petrocorii, which was destroyed shortly before the kingdom's fall.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Goldoni|quote="[...]Just as you have heard, his negligence caused the fall of Petrocorii. Countless citizens were massacred by the barbarians, and the streets were awash with ruin and blood in a single night."}}</ref> Alternatively, the name may originate from the "de Petrichor Family", the family who once ruled the town until at least 500 years ago.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Tiepolo|quote="[...]Five hundred years ago, this place was still governed by the de Petrichor family, and their lineage had long ruled here[...]"}}</ref>
* Petrichor's government form (Elective republic with the ruler called “doge”), family names (Foscari, Contarini, Loredan, Tiepolo, Venier, Este, all of these surnames inscribed in the register of Venetian noble families), isolated insular position, playwright (the woman named Goldoni, same name as the famous Venetian playwright Carlo Goldoni), and instrument-making industry all point to a heavy inspiration from the {{w|Republic of Venice}}.

===Etymology===
* The term "{{w|petrichor}}" (from Ancient Greek {{Lang|mini=1|grc=πέτρᾱ|grc_rm=pétrā|grc_tl=rock}} and {{Lang|mini=1|grc=ῑ̓χώρ|grc_rm=īkhṓr|grc_tl={{w|ichor}}}}) was coined by two Australian researchers in 1964. It refers to the pleasant, earthy smell when rain falls on dry soil.
** The in-game meaning of "golem" likely refers to the literal meanings of ''pétrā'' and ''īkhṓr'', referring to the Remurian stone golems seen throughout the island that were filled with golden ichor by King Remus.
