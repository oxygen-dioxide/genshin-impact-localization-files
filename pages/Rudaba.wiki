:::'''Rudaba:''' Even though the Amurta are not good with numbers, I often play this game privately, so I'm quite well-practiced...
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Rudaba:''' ... I'm done playing. It's time to move on with the interviews and the research.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you...
::'''Rudaba:''' Oh my, I forgot to introduce myself.
::'''Rudaba:''' I'm an {{rubi|[[Amurta]]|Biology}} researcher from the [[Akademiya]], and I'm carrying out an academic study on the rainforest.
::'''Rudaba:''' I'm ashamed to admit it, but I haven't been able to hire a suitable bodyguard due to financial difficulties. So I've been temporarily limited to small-scale surveys in areas protected by the [[Forest Rangers]].
:{{DIcon}} I'm not a Vanara...
::'''Rudaba:''' Oh... What a shame.
::'''Rudaba:''' Still, the opinion of others... can be used as a reference as well, right?

:::'''Rudaba:''' ...Or how much of the traces the Dendro Archon left behind you've encountered?
::'''Rudaba:''' ...Oh, forgive me for taking so much of your time. If you don't mind, you can have a chat with me when you're free.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry that I couldn't help you...
::'''Rudaba:''' Oh, it's okay. Thanks anyway.
