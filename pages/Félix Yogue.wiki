===Evermotion Mechanical Painting===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Félix Yogue:''' Salutations to you once again, Honorary Knight, would you like to try piecing the Evermotion Mechanical Painting together?
:'''Félix Yogue:''' Hmm? It seems that you have some questions for me, yes?
:'''Félix Yogue:''' Aha! Are you interested in the Daydream Club, by any chance?
:{{DIcon}} Daydream Club? What is that?
::'''Félix Yogue:''' Hmm, let me think, how should I explain this... So generally, a "club" is... a loose assembly of people sharing the same interests.
::'''Félix Yogue:''' But... the Daydream Club is bound by something more than "interests" &mdash; that is to say, "dreams."
::'''Félix Yogue:''' However, these "dreams" are often criticized as unrealistic. So we said to ourselves, "why not just name the club 'daydream'?" And that's what we did.
::'''Félix Yogue:''' As for us, the members of the club are naturally "daydreamers" holding to our "daydreams."
:{{DIcon}} Tell me more about the members of the Daydream Club...
::'''Félix Yogue:''' Ah, we are not great in numbers, but our members are all extraordinarily imaginative.
::'''Félix Yogue:''' I, Félix Yogue, wish to create an energy source that can operate in perpetuity!
::'''Félix Yogue:''' And I want to use purely mechanical structures to build it, requiring no materials that regular people can't handle.
::'''Félix Yogue:''' Next up is [[Xavier]], the genius artist and creator of the Film Kamera &mdash; which, by the way, is an exquisite product, I'll tell you that.
::'''Félix Yogue:''' However, his hidden talents are most stirringly displayed in the Films he creates.
::'''Félix Yogue:''' We believe with all our hearts that this man will become the greatest Film Maker in Teyvat.
::'''Félix Yogue:''' That said, I haven't heard from him since his journey to Inazuma. Honestly, what has he been doing?
::'''Félix Yogue:''' Then there's another one of us &mdash; [[Garcia|Mr. Garcia]], who's working on a Numbering Machine.
::'''Félix Yogue:''' Well, he does zone out from time to time... but trust me, he's a natural-born mathematical genius.
::'''Félix Yogue:''' Last but surely not least, we have the brothers, [[Mécantre]] and [[Babisse]], with their boundless energy.
::'''Félix Yogue:''' They are working on a super-sized cannon. Their schematics state that it shall fire missiles that can fly high enough to touch the stars of Teyvat... all while carrying people inside.
::'''Félix Yogue:''' They are still searching for the right fuel for the project, but their "daydream" is the craziest plan I've ever heard.
::{{DIcon}} Are you... serious?
::'''Félix Yogue:''' Of course! We're absolutely serious about our "daydreams," haha! I mean, isn't "Daydream Club" a perfect name for us?
::'''Félix Yogue:''' If you're interested, do visit the town of Petrichor in the Court of Fontaine. That's where our members gather.
::'''Félix Yogue:''' That said, if you went there now, you'd probably encounter a rather downcast pair of brothers...
:{{DIcon}} Um... I've actually met Xavier in Inazuma... ''(Available after completing [[Tatara Tales: The Last Act]])''
::{{Black Screen|You tell Félix Yogue about your experiences with Xavier in Tatarasuna...}}
::'''Félix Yogue:''' Ah, fabulous, fabulous! "[[Tatara Tales]]" shall make Xavier, bless his heart, famous overnight. Mark my words!
::'''Félix Yogue:''' ...But honestly, I am just really relieved. I thought he might've, you know...
::'''Félix Yogue:''' That said, since things have been dealt with, why hasn't he even sent one letter back...?
::'''Félix Yogue:''' Whatever, I'll send a letter back to [[Petrichor]] later to tell Mécantre the news, so that he can stop worrying...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Félix Yogue:''' Farewell. Once more, I salute you, Honorary Knight.

===Duel! The Summoners' Summit!===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Félix Yogue:''' Ah, Traveler, it's you. Would you like to try this painting out?
:{{DIcon}} Yep.
::'''Félix Yogue:''' Haha, great! I'm sure you'll solve this mechanical painting in no time.
::'''Félix Yogue:''' The mechanical painting's over here. You may begin whenever you're ready.
:{{DIcon}} I've got something else to do.
::'''Félix Yogue:''' Uh... okay then. Feel free to stop by when you get the chance! I won't be going anywhere for the time being...

;(if something)
:'''Félix Yogue:''' What a surprise. To think that my invention could be used in this fashion...
:'''Félix Yogue:''' Ah, Traveler! It seems we meet again... *cough*
:{{DIcon}} I thought you'd left Mondstadt.
::'''Félix Yogue:''' That was the plan, yes, but... Things do change, you know...
:{{DIcon}} Did something go wrong with your invention again?
::'''Félix Yogue:''' No, not at all! Not this time... Or should I say, there was never a problem.
::'''Félix Yogue:''' When I asked you for your help previously, I was having a monster problem, not an invention problem!
:'''Félix Yogue:''' *cough* But let's get back on topic.
:'''Félix Yogue:''' This time, I've been invited by the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild to create several Mechanical Paintings based on certain card faces that can be disassembled and reassembled.
:'''Félix Yogue:''' As for the card game, what was it again... Ah, right, it's called Genius Invokation TCG.
:'''Félix Yogue:''' According to them, these paintings will be brought to be used in the King of Invokations Grand Prix as a sort of minigame to liven things up just a bit.
:'''Félix Yogue:''' *sigh* These things are too complicated for me. I should just concentrate on my inventions.
:'''Félix Yogue:''' Ah, yes, Mondstadt's mechanical paintings are with me, so if you want to play around with them, feel free.
