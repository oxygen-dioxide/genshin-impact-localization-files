:'''Inkanak:''' Sure enough, working together with capable people lets us meet new challenges.
:{{DIcon}} You are...
::'''Inkanak:''' I am the manager of the flight trial grounds, and I'm involved in organizing much of the work that gets done here.
::'''Inkanak:''' The arena's a very important place for the Flower-Feather Clan. In my heart, its importance is second only to the totem pole.
::'''Inkanak:''' After all, the fate of many a flying squad member or associate member is determined here.
::'''Inkanak:''' That's how a person's fate is. Sometimes up, sometimes down, like the undulating wind. But if I could, I'd love to be the breeze beneath everyone's wings.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Inkanak:''' See ya!
