'''Furnishings''' are buildings, geological features, furniture, decorations, plants, or animals that players can place in their [[Realm Layout]]s in the [[Serenitea Pot]]. It is the ninth tab in the [[Inventory]].

There is a total of {{Furnishing/Total}} Furnishings.

==Creating Furnishings==
{{Main|Creation}}
[[File:Icon Creation Small.png|200px|thumb|right]]
Furnishings can be created through [[Creation]] using [[Serenitea Pot Materials#Furnishing Materials|furnishing materials]] and can take 12–16 hours to create. Creating a furnishing for the first time requires a [[blueprint]] for the item, and rewards a certain amount of {{Item|Trust|20}}.

==Placing Furnishings==
[[File:Icon Place Furnishings.png|200px|thumb|right]]
Within the Serenitea Pot, the Placing Furnishing feature is accessed via the Pointer icon at the top of the screen. There will be several areas to place furnishings, internal and external. The internal area is accessed by entering the [[Main Building/Mansion|Mansion]] the player is initially given. The mansion itself possesses a main hall, upper chamber and five rooms.

===Areas===
As Trust Rank increases, more external areas will be unlocked in the player's Serenitea Pot. There are four external areas, which are unlocked at Trust Ranks 1, 4, 7 and 9.

For each area (internal or external), one can place a maximum of 200 different furnishings, provided that the [[Serenitea Pot/Load|load]] is not capped by the time the player does so. Additionally, no more than 99 of the same furnishing can be placed.

Each area will have an associated [[Adeptal Energy]] corresponding to the kinds of furnishings placed. The total Adeptal Energy of the realm is the sum of the Adeptal Energies across each of these areas. Each Realm has its own Adeptal Energy total. However, the Realm Currency Accumulation Rate only takes into consideration the realm with the most Adeptal Energy, not the total of all Realms.

At Trust Rank 7, the player will unlock another mansion to use. Only one mansion can be placed per Realm. If the player attempts to replace the mansion in their current Realm with another while furnishings are still inside, a confirmation prompt will appear. If the player continues, the mansion will be replaced and all furnishings inside it will need to be placed again.

===Placement Rules===
The furnishings must be placed within the boundaries of the given area. Some furnishings can be placed on top of each other (see [[Furnishing/List/By Feature#Surface Furnishings|Surface Furnishings]]), and some furnishings can be moved both vertically and horizontally (see [[Furnishing/List/By Feature#Floatable Furnishings|Floatable Furnishings]]). All furnishings be rotated and moved horizontally, and most furnishings can be overlapped (clipped) with each other.

If the player attempts to move a furnishing that is part of a [[Furnishing Set]], the player has the option to either move the entire set or the individual item itself. Choosing the latter and then attempting to move the item more than halfway out of the set's circular boundary will cause a confirmation prompt to appear, as confirming to move the item more than halfway out of the set will no longer make the entire furnishing a set unless replaced once more. Furnishings in sets can be freely rotated and moved within the circular boundary without causing the set to no longer be considered a set.

==Types of Furnishings==
Furnishings are categorized into two broad classes: Exterior and Interior. Besides these classes, some furnishings can only be placed through [[Furnishing Subsystem]]s.
