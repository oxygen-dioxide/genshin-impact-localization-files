|introduction = All sorts of people enter and leave the harbor, and there is no lack of ill-tempered folks among them who often get into altercations with others. As one who must keep order, Chourei needs to mediate such conflicts, despite her desire to only lead a peaceful life. Thanks to some inspiration from the harbormaster, she started requesting that conflicting parties settle things over Genius Invokation TCG, with the losing party being bid not to make a fuss &mdash; a method that has seen impressive results. Slowly, Chourei became quite the hobbyist herself.<br>{{color|bp|Special Rule: You will not use your own deck, but a preset deck named "Eruption of Energies Ravenous" instead.}}
