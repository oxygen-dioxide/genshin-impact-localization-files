==Gameplay Notes==
* Opening the Luxurious Chest grants the {{Achievement|"Maybe Get Yourself a More Social Hobby..."}}
* Date's line, "What do you mean 'hehe'?!" is a callback to when [[Paimon]] tells [[Venti]] the same during the {{Quest|State of the Holy Lyre der Himmel}}.
* The solution to the Heterodoxa Labyrinth during step 2 is as follows:
*# Use the Day-Night Mechanism nearby the sealed Luxurious Chest to switch to Whitenight.
*# Activate the southern lever, which is directly in front of the Day-Night Mechanism, to open the gate.
*# Hit the eastern Triangular Mechanisms twice.
*# Activate the southern lever to close the gate.
*# Activate the northern lever, which is on the opposite side of the room, to open the gate.
*# Hit the western Triangular Mechanism twice.
*# Activate the northern lever to close the gate.
*# Hit the eastern Triangular Mechanism once.
*# Use the Day-Night Mechanism to switch back to Evernight.
*# Open the Luxurious Chest.

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Read the Stone Tablet near the prerequisite labyrinth)
:'''Tablet Text:''' (The stone tablet has some intelligible words on it that say...)
:'''Tablet Text:''' My father told me that everything we do should be backed up by mortality and brought forth with elegance.
:'''Tablet Text:''' That's why he said that I should use these words to record hints for my labyrinth.
:'''Tablet Text:''' Only within Evernight will the mechanisms to the labyrinth walls and the way forward appear, bathed in invisible moonlight as they are.
:'''Tablet Text:''' The mechanisms that control the solution to this labyrinth are hidden in its four corners.
:'''Tablet Text:''' And because I lacked rhyme or rhetoric in my writing at the end...
:'''Tablet Text:''' My father, [[Eurydates]], gave me a few strokes on the backside with his crutches.
;(The first time after reading the Stone Tablet, must be at [[Evernight]])
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. Wait. If you can see labyrinth from above, wouldn't it cease to pose any challenge at all? Well then, guess I'll just do this.

;(Talk to the afterimage after completing the prerequisite labyrinth)
:'''???:''' Oh ho, are you here to try my latest, greatest work, too?
:'''Paimon:''' What are you, Enkanomiya's celebrity chef?
:'''Date:''' The name's Date. They used to call me Daedalus, son of Eurydates. I'm a labyrinth artisan! The puzzle you just went through is my work.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, so you're the guy who had fun stumping us, huh? Alright! Bye!
:'''Date:''' Hey, wait, wait a moment! I'm not just some kid doodling on pieces of paper. I'm no mere labyrinth artisan either &mdash; I'm the second-best architect in the history of Byakuyakoku!
:'''Paimon:''' And who's number one?
:'''Date:''' Why, [[Aberaku]] no Mikoto, of course, bless his heart! If the Dainichi Mikoshi were to be second place, no other building could take first place.
:'''Date:''' The fact that you've met me means that you've cleared my first "Neopathos"-style labyrinth.
:'''Date:''' How did you find it? Any interest in trying my other "Heterodoxa"-style labyrinth? It's completely different from one made only from walls.
:{{DIcon}} No need. We've sampled your work enough as-is.
:'''Date:''' Oh, come on now. This masterpiece was a result of abundant space, time, and funds!
:'''Date:''' A significant portion of us have already gone to live on [[Watatsumi Island]] up there on the surface, so there's plenty of real estate around here.
:'''Date:''' And that's why I borrowed "Hydrological Studies in Byakuyakoku." I meant to study the principles of load-bearing, the maximization of underground spaces, the avoidance of water leakage, and even some principles of geomancy!
:'''Date:''' Well, and sorry, Ema, but I... might have left the book in the labyrinth's treasure vault...
:'''Paimon:''' Sorry, what were you muttering about?
:'''Date:''' Nothing! I mean to cordially invite you to challenge my grand masterpiece!
:'''Date:''' Whatever the case may be, take this key. It can be used to open the puzzles.
:'''Date:''' If you are successful, you can even obtain a medal of recognition that I made myself.
:'''Paimon:''' That's not a very rare prize.
:'''Date:''' I have also hidden my treasures in the vault ahead. If you obtain two medals, you can open the treasury!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh... is that how it is? Well, we'll give it a try if we have time, then.
:'''Date:''' Wonderful! I look forward to your feedback.
:'''Date:''' Ah, yes! Since you've conquered the first labyrinth, here's your first medal.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, okay...
:'''Date:''' So, any comments?
:'''Paimon:''' How should we put it? It felt like...
:'''Date:''' Felt like?
:'''Paimon:''' It felt like it lacked a little boom-shaka-laka.
:'''Date:''' Boom-shaka-laka? What's that?
;(Obtain {{Item|Date's Key}})

;(Talk to Date again)
:'''Date:''' So, have you challenged my Heterodoxa labyrinth yet?
----
;(Read the Very Obvious Note inside the Heterodoxa labyrinth)
:'''Very Obvious Note:''' Now that I've added a lock on this labyrinth, that old man can't bother me about my writing anymore.
:'''Very Obvious Note:''' A labyrinth is a labyrinth, and a maze is a maze. The word itself is derived from "labrys," the "double-bladed axe" &mdash; so of course it should be symmetrical!
:'''Very Obvious Note:''' During Evernight, the two sides of this labyrinth become symmetrical, and so the way forward will become clear.
:'''Very Obvious Note:''' It's pretty orthodox, but there's a little avant-garde in there too! "The one who finally solves the mystery will create the labyrinth." What a romantic notion!
:'''Very Obvious Note:''' Such romanticism isn't something the old man, obsessed with rhetoric and rhyme as he is, would understand.
;(Obtain Date's other Medal of Recognition by clearing the Heterodoxa labyrinth)
----
;(Talk to Date's afterimage after clearing the Heterodoxa labyrinth)
:'''Date:''' Did you clear the labyrinth over there as well? Good, very good. Very impressive.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, okay...
:'''Date:''' What did you think of it?
:'''Paimon:''' What we think? Well...
:'''Date:''' Hehe, it was super intricate and super awesome, wasn't it?
:'''Paimon:''' Heh... Hehe!
:'''Date:''' What do you mean, "hehe"!?
:'''Date:''' *cough* Regardless, since you now have both medals of recognition, the path to the secret chamber should now be open.
:'''Date:''' Place the medals in there, and you should be able to open the treasury gate.

;(Talk to Date again)
:'''Date:''' Honestly, these labyrinths are just a means, not the end. What I really wish to do is serve the people, like Aberaku did.
----
;(Open Date's secret room and obtain the treasure)

;(Obtain {{Item|Hydrological Studies in Byakuyakoku}})
