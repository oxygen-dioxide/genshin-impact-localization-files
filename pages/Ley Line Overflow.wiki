'''Ley Line Overflow''' is a [[Recurring Event]]. During the event, the [[Ley Line Outcrops]] will provide double the rewards a maximum of three times each day. {{Item|Condensed Resin}} is not eligible to consume Ley Line Overflow rewards.

==Event Details==
During the event, Travelers who successfully complete a Blossom of Wealth or Blossom of Revelation and claim the rewards by using [[Original Resin]] will receive double the rewards. A total of 3 such bonuses will be available each day.

After claiming rewards from a Ley Line Outcrop, the following message appears:

"1 multiplied Ley Line Overflow reward consumed. Attempts remaining today: X/3"

If the Reunion Blessing bonus from the [[Stellar Reunion]] permanent event is active, then the Reunion Blessing bonus will be consumed first.

Event subtraction rules are as follows: Improved reward instances are first subtracted from the event with the highest Multiplier. If the Multiplier is equal for both events, then double reward instances are first subtracted  from the "Stellar Reunion" event.

Using Condensed Resin to claim rewards from Ley Line Outcrops does not affect the amount of available Ley Line Overflow bonuses. It will grant the same rewards as it does outside of the event.
