;(Approach Louis' Snack Shop)
:{{A|vo lnlq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, isn't that Charlotte?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, we're always running into her! What's she doing this time... Oh, looks like street interviews?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon has a funny feeling that we might be in for an interesting time if we go check it out. Shall we?

;(Approach Charlotte)
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I see! So you believe that this warning letter was sent by The Phantom Weasel?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 abagnale 01.ogg}} '''Abagnale:''' Absolutely! I've said it before, and I'll say it again: The Phantom Weasel never acts as you expect. He must have faked his own death ten years ago using a body double!
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 abagnale 02.ogg}} '''Abagnale:''' Now that he's back, I'm sure the Gardes who worked on his case back in the day are in for a headache. But however this turns out in the end, the one thing it won't be is boring!
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Couldn't agree more! As a journalist, I'm gonna get a lot of mileage out of this one!
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Thank you, Sir, for your time. Now, whom should I interview next... Huh!? Hey, what a coincidence. Fancy meeting you here!
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Perfect timing. So, The Phantom Weasel's latest warning letter &mdash; what are your thoughts?
:{{DIcon}} "Phantom Weasel"?
:{{DIcon}} "Warning letter"?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, this is the first time we're hearing of this one. Could you clue us in?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Huh? Oh... Ah, sorry! Yes, this case is from a decade ago. I guess you wouldn't know about it...
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 06.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Well, not to worry &mdash; you're in good hands, because I'm a professional! The story goes like this...
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 07.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Ten or so years ago, a phantom thief became active in the Court of Fontaine. Known only as "The Weasel," nobody knew his true identity, and the authorities never managed to catch him.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, cool! He sounds like one of those... mysterious night burglars that you read about in novels!
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 08.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Precisely &mdash; well, except the part where they actually have a good reputation. Our Weasel targeted whatever people held dear, and no one was safe from his predations!
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 09.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' He would just as soon steal a necklace from a rich merchant's safe as he would a toy doll given to a commoner child for their birthday.
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like an absolute weirdo.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 10.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I know! The phantom thieves you read about in novels rob the rich to pay the poor, but this guy did not discriminate. Unsurprisingly, this didn't work wonders for his public reputation. Every man and his dog wanted to see him behind bars.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeesh. So, uh... Did they catch him?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 11.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Umm... Not exactly. There's a good chance that the Weasel would still be at large to this day if it hadn't been for an accident ten years ago.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 12.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' A magician named [[Cesar]] fell to his death in a botched high-altitude escape performance.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 13.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' When the police went through his personal effects, they found a hoard of stolen loot and gadgets used for criminal activities... and that was how The Phantom Weasel's identity was revealed to all.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 14.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Sure enough, thefts in Fontaine went down after Cesar's death... But today, ten years on, the notorious thief has once again issued one of his warning letters &mdash; and pasted it on the gate of the Opera Epiclese for all to see!
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 15.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I had to squeeze through the crowd this morning to get a photo as soon as I heard... Here, it's this one.
::[[File:The Phantom Thief's Reappearance 1.png|500px]]
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So this is the warning letter, huh? Let's see what he wrote...
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Three days from now, when evening falls, I shall take from you that which you hold most dear at the opera house, just as you did to me ten years ago."
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 16.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' This is, without a doubt, a clear declaration of criminal intent. After years of laying low, The Phantom Weasel is back with a vengeance!
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 17.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' What once seemed like an open-and-shut case has been blown wide open again. But why has he re-emerged now, and what does he want? I sense an epic scoop &mdash; and I'm going for it!
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh-oh... If this thief will steal anything that other people value, does that mean even we might be targeted?
:{{DIcon}} He might steal all your favorite snacks.
::{{A|vo lnlq001 2 paimon 07a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Hmph, let him try! In fact... Paimon's gonna eat all her snacks right now &mdash; let's see what he can do about that!
:{{DIcon}} He might try to nab you, little Paimon.
::{{A|vo lnlq001 2 paimon 07b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aww... But Paimon doesn't wanna get kidnapped... Well, he'd have to go through you first.&nbsp;...You would stop him, right?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 18.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Okay, the people have spoken. It's clear that the public are very concerned about The Phantom Weasel's reappearance...
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 19.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Let's see, I've got a photo of the letter, my interview notes... Yup, that should be enough to form the skeleton of my article. It does feel like something is missing, though...
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 20.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Something... exclusive.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 21.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Who should I interview next? I need someone with a more concrete connection to the Weasel... Hmm? Is that who I think it is...?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lyney?
:{{DIcon}} Looks like he's performing some magic.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 22.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Magic... Magician... Cesar... The Phantom Weasel! That's it! Let's go interview Lyney!
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 23.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' You see? The original phantom thief, Cesar, was a magician too. And what do phantom thieves and magicians have in common? They both have an air of mystery about them! Perhaps there's a connection there?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you serious? What sort of a deduction is that!?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 2 charlotte 24.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Oh, relax... My journalistic instinct tells me that an exclusive news story is beckoning. Let's go &mdash; no time for delay!

{{Quest Description|update|Is there a connection between phantom thieves and magicians? Interview Lyney about the Phantom Weasel's reappearance.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Lyney)
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 david 01.ogg}} '''David:''' Wow, Mr. Magician! How did you know which card I'd picked?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Oh, it's simple! Come closer, and I'll let you in on my secret... Magicians have a special skill called "telepathy," which means we can read other people's minds.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 david 02.ogg}} '''David:''' Really? Then... What am I thinking now?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well, first you need to relax... Because I can see that you're clenching your fist in your mind, as if to say "No, I mustn't let him guess it..."
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 david 03.ogg}} '''David:''' Aww...!
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' And now you're getting a little flustered. You're trying to find a way to empty your mind, to think of nothing at all. But the more you try to hide a secret, the easier it'll come out~
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You snuck out from home today, didn't you? You told your family a little lie so you could come out and play. Now, now, that's not a good habit.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 david 04.ogg}} '''David:''' Y&mdash;You can tell? Oh boy... you really CAN read my mind!
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Of course. And that's the end of my performance &mdash; you should really be heading home. Remember to apologize to your family, alright? They must be worried about you.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 david 05.ogg}} '''David:''' A&mdash;Alright, got it. Bye, Mr. Magician!
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Hey, Lyney...
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Why, hello, we meet again. Are you looking for me? What's the situation?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, why don't you guess, Mr. Telepathic?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Oh, please! You didn't believe that spiel, did you? The power of telepathy is quite beyond me.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I'm sure that child would beg to differ... Seemed like you were right on the money.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That was nothing more than a little trickery. I made an educated guess based on his microexpressions...
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That, plus the fact that he was the only kid here without his parents, and he looked as guilty as sin. He made it easy for me.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You guys, on the other hand... Let me guess... Don't tell me you're here for the Phantom Weasel, are you?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow! Got it in one! Is this more of your trickery at work?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Wait, really? Haha... No, no trickery this time. It was pure luck.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 12.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' His warning letter's been the talk of the town, so I figured that maybe you were asking around about that.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Bingo! I plan on writing a column reporting on the latest news about The Phantom Weasel!
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' So Lyney, what are your thoughts on this infamous thief's reappearance?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 13.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hmm... To be honest, it makes me angry.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Angry? Why?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 14.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You read his letter, right? The Phantom Weasel claims he's planning something in three nights' time at the opera house. That's the night I'll be performing there.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, what are the chances...
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Wait a minute. You don't think he's after you... do you?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 15.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well, if he is, then his warning is clearly a direct challenge to me personally.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 16.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' And if he's not... then it's still going to be a huge headache for me.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 17.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' The mere mention of the Weasel's name is enough to scare people off. So once the contents of that letter get out, barely anyone will be showing up to watch my show.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 18.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But I've been preparing for this for a long time. I'm not about to let him ruin my big day. This leaves me with only one choice... I have to expose The Phantom Weasel's identity before the show begins.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Really? So what you're saying is... We might get to see a live duel between a famous magician and an infamous thief? Wow... This has "exclusive" written all over it!
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 19.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' To be honest, I'm not sure if I'll emerge the victor. The Phantom Weasel is a notorious crook, infamous for his inscrutable methods.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' You're being far too modest, Lyney. I think your magic tricks are even more inscrutable than those of a thief!
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 20.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Thanks for the compliment, though I have to say, I don't care much for the comparison.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 21.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' A lot of people liken magicians to thieves because we both have the ability to make things disappear without the person noticing. But there's an important difference that these people overlook.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 22.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Allow me to demonstrate with a quick magic trick. Here I have a flower, just an ordinary flower that was picked not long ago. Watch it carefully now... Three, two, one...
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's gone!
:{{DIcon}} Where'd it go?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 23.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That's the question. Where did it go?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 24.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Therein lies the difference between us. Thieves make precious things disappear, but only magicians make them reappear.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 25.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' If I could now invite you all to check your clothes... There might be a surprise in there somewhere.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A surprise? Lemme see...
:{{DIcon}} Huh!!!
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's right there! But how? You haven't moved this whole time!
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 charlotte 06.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' What an outstanding trick! Sorry, Lyney, it seems that my previous praise was woefully inadequate. Clearly, magic is the superior art form to theft.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 26.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Don't worry, I didn't take offense. I just wanted to take the opportunity to perhaps change some of the preconceived notions you might have about magicians.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 27.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Since Cesar's death, a lot of people associate magicians with criminality. It can be quite frustrating.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 charlotte 07.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I can imagine. Um, coming back to your trick just now &mdash; might I presume that you are well-versed in floral symbolism?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 charlotte 08.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' For example, magicians often use "Rainbow Roses" in their flower-related performances to represent "passion" and "romantic encounters."
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 charlotte 09.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' But you used a Lumidouce Bell, which, if I'm not mistaken, allude to "separations." I'm curious to know if there was any deeper meaning behind this choice?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 28.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Impressive knowledge &mdash; it's no wonder you're such a successful journalist. But I'm afraid I don't know the first thing about floral symbolism. I'm just in the habit of using Lumidouce Bells in my magic.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 29.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' It sounds like something I should look into though. I'll buy myself a copy of "Fontaine's Floral Language Facts" when I have some time &mdash; but it'll have to wait until this Phantom Weasel business is behind us.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 charlotte 10.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Well-noted... In that case, this brings us to the end of our interview. I, for one, am looking forward to the final showdown between you and the thief.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 charlotte 11.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Please feel free to get in touch to update me on any further developments. Otherwise, I will of course see you at your show in three days' time. But let's hope The Phantom Weasel is caught by then.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 charlotte 12.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' If there's nothing else, I'll be off. You've given me lots to work with here, and I've got no time to lose if I wanna write that exclusive piece! I'll see you all later!
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, Lyney... Are you gonna tell us how you did that flower trick now?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 30.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hehe... I'm afraid that's my little secret.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aww... Well, magicians are entitled to their secrets... But Paimon's reeeally itching to know how it's done...
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You feel it too, right? So itchy!
:{{DIcon}} The Phantom Weasel...
:{{DIcon}} You sure you'll be able to handle him?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 31.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hehe, not so itchy then, huh?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 32.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well, since you're so concerned, how you would like to serve as my temporary magician's assistants, and help me investigate?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Magician's assistants? That sounds fun! Assistants are technically magicians too!
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Also, it'll bring us one step closer to figuring out how that darn trick is done! Shall we go for it?
:{{DIcon}} We'll help you with your investigation.
::{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 33a 1.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Excellent. Thank you for putting your trust in moi.
:{{DIcon}} What's your plan?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 34.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' The first thing we need to look into is who Cesar really was. If he truly was The Phantom Weasel, that means that the weasel is dead, and whoever wrote this warning letter is just a copycat criminal.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 35.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But if he wasn't The Weasel... Well, that'll make things more interesting. It would mean that The Weasel lives, and he's been laying low all this time in some corner of Fontaine.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 36.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' And if we're investigating Cesar, his fiancée, Jemma, is a good place to start. Word is that she visits the cemetery often, so I asked [[Lynette]] to wait for her there.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 3 lyney 37.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' We should make a move. Let's go and rendezvous with Lynette.

;(Talk to [[Baltasar]]) 
:{{A|vo lnlq001 5 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Excuse me good sir, do you by any chance know a Jemma?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 5 baltasar 01.ogg}} '''Baltasar:''' Jemma? You mean Cesar's fiancée? Sure I do... What's this about?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 5 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I'm just trying to get ahold of her, because I need her help with something. I heard she comes here a lot?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 5 baltasar 02.ogg}} '''Baltasar:''' Yeah, she does. *sigh* Poor thing... It's no secret why, either. She's heartsick.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 5 baltasar 03.ogg}} '''Baltasar:''' Ever since Cesar passed away, she's been coming here once every week to clean his grave. Often, she just sits there in front of his headstone, lost in thought. Sometimes she talks to herself.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 5 baltasar 04.ogg}} '''Baltasar:''' I asked her what she was doing once. She said... she wanted to speak to him again.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 5 baltasar 05.ogg}} '''Baltasar:''' She knows he's gone, and can't hear her from the grave, but... She just likes to spend time there, telling her fiancé all about how her life is going.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And she's been doing this ever since Cesar passed away? So, ten years? Wow. Their love must've been really strong.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 5 baltasar 06.ogg}} '''Baltasar:''' I'll bet. Cesar's reputation fell apart after his identity was revealed, so no one else visits his grave... Jemma's the only one who still thinks about him after all these years.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 5 baltasar 07.ogg}} '''Baltasar:''' I don't know if the mind lives on in the waters after death, but if it does... I'm sure Cesar must be grateful to have someone who remembers him fondly.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 5 baltasar 08.ogg}} '''Baltasar:''' If I'm honest, I think this is all so unfair to poor Jemma. Her fiancé was a lowlife crook &mdash; he doesn't deserve someone like her.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 5 baltasar 09.ogg}} '''Baltasar:''' Anyway, all of that said &mdash; she's running later than usual today. Normally, she'd be sitting in front of his grave by now. I wonder if she's okay?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 5 baltasar 10.ogg}} '''Baltasar:''' Well, that's everything I know, I'm afraid. You might have more luck asking some other people.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 5 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Alright, well thanks for sharing all of this with us. We'll keep asking around.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 5 baltasar 11.ogg}} '''Baltasar:''' You're welcome. *sigh*&nbsp;...I just hope she'll be able to move on one day.

:{{A|vo dialog lnlq001 baltasar 01.ogg}} '''Baltasar:''' A lot of people find cemeteries bleak and oppressive, but not me.
:{{A|vo dialog lnlq001 baltasar 02.ogg}} '''Baltasar:''' I find the silence gives me a sense of peace. And something about being in the presence of the dead and buried... It sorta puts all of life's woes in perspective.

;(Talk to Gracia or Juliano) 
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 gracia 01.ogg}} '''Gracia:''' Did you hear the news? They're saying The Phantom Weasel's back.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 juliano 01.ogg}} '''Juliano:''' You're kidding... Wait, isn't he dead?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 gracia 02.ogg}} '''Gracia:''' I dunno anymore. All sorts of news flying around nowadays. I can never tell what's true and what isn't.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 gracia 03.ogg}} '''Gracia:''' But what if... Just hypothetically, I mean... What if this Weasel's the real deal, and Cesar was framed?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 juliano 02.ogg}} '''Juliano:''' Called it. Seriously, ten years ago, on the day it all went down, I said to myself "You know what? This guy's been set up." The Cesar I knew was a good guy. He gave balloons to children on the street, for Pete's sake. What, are we supposed to believe that he was a balloon thief, or something? Gimme a break.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 gracia 04.ogg}} '''Gracia:''' Oh please. Weren't you the one cursing his name to high heaven when the police announced the news!? You were all, "That gosh-darn lousy son of a... You think you know a guy..." Or words to that effect.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 juliano 03.ogg}} '''Juliano:''' Wait, did I say that? Hmm. I don't seem to recall...
:{{DIcon}} Sorry to interrupt...
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hello there. Sorry for disturbing you, but I couldn't help but notice you were discussing The Phantom Weasel?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' We're actually quite interested in this topic as well, but we're struggling to get to the bottom of it. Do you think you could spare a moment to tell us a little bit about Cesar?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 juliano 04.ogg}} '''Juliano:''' You've come to the right people. Yep... I was there. Back when Cesar used to perform magic tricks on the street.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 juliano 05.ogg}} '''Juliano:''' He was a great magician. The best trick I ever saw him do was pop a transparent balloon, only for a whole bunch of doves to fly out from the inside.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 juliano 06.ogg}} '''Juliano:''' I was right up close and didn't blink or look away once. But for the life of me, I still don't have the faintest clue how he pulled it off. Really incredible stuff.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 gracia 05.ogg}} '''Gracia:''' I saw him perform too. He always used to bring some gifts along for the kids who came to watch his show, and he'd hand them out after he was done.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 gracia 06.ogg}} '''Gracia:''' Sometimes, he even got the kids to write their wishes down, and then he'd make the items on the "wishlist" appear in his next show.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, he doesn't sound like such a bad guy...
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 gracia 07.ogg}} '''Gracia:''' But after he died, there were also rumors that he used the wishlist to find out what was precious to people, with the intent to steal it later.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 gracia 08.ogg}} '''Gracia:''' ...As I'm sure you know, The Phantom Weasel would steal just about anything from anyone.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 juliano 07.ogg}} '''Juliano:''' Whatever the case, now that The Weasel is back, Cesar's become a hot topic once more.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 juliano 08.ogg}} '''Juliano:''' I bet Jemma must be pleased. If Cesar's name gets cleared, maybe it'll finally give her some solace after all this time.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 juliano 09.ogg}} '''Juliano:''' Oh, speak of the devil &mdash; that's her over there. If you've got any more questions about Cesar, she's definitely the one to ask.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's Jemma... Is it just Paimon, or does it look like something's wrong?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait... It looks like she's injured! C'mon, let's see if she's okay!
:;(The group walks up to Jemma, who is standing in front of a tombstone)
:{{A|vo lnlq001 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Hi there. You're Jemma, right?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 8 gemma 01.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' ...Who's asking?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 8 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Don't be afraid, we mean no harm.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 8 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' It looks like you're injured. How bad is it?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 8 gemma 02.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' Thanks for your concern, but you didn't answer my question. Who are you? And what do you want with me?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 8 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' My name is Lyney, and this is my sister Lynette.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' My name's Paimon, and this here's {{Traveler}}. We're investigating The Phantom Weasel.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 8 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' The Weasel posted a warning letter this morning. If he still lives, that means that Cesar was falsely accused.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 8 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You knew Cesar better than anyone else. So if you're willing, we'd love to hear what you think about all this.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 8 gemma 03.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' ...
:{{A|vo lnlq001 8 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I promise you can trust us. We won't hurt you &mdash; in fact, we'll do all we can to keep you safe.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 8 gemma 04.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' I... I never believed that he was The Weasel.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 8 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Huh, I suspected as much. Okay, so going back ten years, do you remember anything strange in the weeks leading up to the accident? Did Cesar have a falling out with anyone, for instance?
:{{A|vo lnlq001 8 gemma 05.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' ...No. Not that I know of.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 8 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...
:{{A|vo lnlq001 8 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Got it. Alright, sorry for disturbing you.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 8 gemma 06.ogg}} '''Jemma:''' If you don't have any more questions, please leave. I want to be alone with him.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Judging by the look on her face, there's definitely something fishy about her...
:{{A|vo lnlq001 8 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' She's lying. She definitely knows something.
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps she simply doesn't trust us.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 8 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That's fair. We're just a bunch of strangers who showed up and started questioning her about things that happened a whole decade ago... It makes sense that she'd be wary around us.
:{{A|vo lnlq001 8 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' In any case, I doubt we'll get any further here, so let's call it a day. Meet me outside Hotel Debord tomorrow, and then we'll start the next step of our plan.

;(Talk to Juliano, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog lnlq001 juliano 02.ogg}} '''Juliano:''' Jemma's hurt, you say?
:{{A|vo dialog lnlq001 juliano 03.ogg}} '''Juliano:''' Now that you mention it, I did see her getting into a heated argument a while back...
:{{A|vo dialog lnlq001 juliano 04.ogg}} '''Juliano:''' Maybe someone who hates Cesar was taking it out on her... People can be unbelievable sometimes.

;(Talk to Gracia, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog lnlq001 gracia 02.ogg}} '''Gracia:''' Oh, Cesar... Were you or weren't you The Phantom Weasel?
