==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Yamaue:''' When the show starts, you will say, "Tokunaga, hurry, show us a good one!" before I'll show up with a backflip...
:'''Tokunaga:''' Wait, isn't that a bit over the top? I think it'll be better if we stick to the original plan. You just scare me from behind, and I'll pretend to be shocked...
:'''Yamaue:''' No no, that's too simple. Our goal is to become professional comedians! How can we make a name for ourselves if we don't give it all we've got?
:'''Yamaue:''' Even a dog wouldn't laugh at tricks as old as pretending to be scared. Don't you think so, Pika?
:'''Pika:''' ?
:'''Yamaue:''' See?
:'''Tokunaga:''' See what, exactly? If you come over and scare me, I can make it really funny. I'll show you if you don't believe me!
:'''Tokunaga:''' Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!
:'''Yamaue:''' ...
:'''Tokunaga:''' Pretty funny, right?
:'''Tokunaga:''' Well... Pika, you tell him if that's funny.
:'''Pika:''' (Wiggling tail)
