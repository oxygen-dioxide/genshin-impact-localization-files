:'''Lenne:''' [[Weinlesefest]] is the best festival for bards!
:'''Lenne:''' Sampling fine wines while singing your heart out. This is the life of a bard, and that's how it's supposed to be.
:'''Lenne:''' It's the perfect festival for getting those creative juices flowing. I really hope my poet friends from Inazuma can come and check it out as well.
