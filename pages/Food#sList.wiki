==List of Food Items==
Food is sorted into various types, indicated by an icon when seen in the backpack. Food items of the same type do not stack when used (any consumed food will simply overwrite any pre-existing in the same category, regardless of buff strength or star rank), and only four types of Food buffs can be active at once. Regenerative buffs do not fall under the three food buff categories, and the effects may exist alongside the other food buffs.

===List of Special Dishes===
{{Main|Special Dish}}
Dishes that have a chance to be cooked if a specific character cooks them. Compared to the dishes they are based off on, they offer superior benefits (more HP/Stamina recovered, more potent buffs, longer duration etc.).
