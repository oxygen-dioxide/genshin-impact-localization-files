==Wargame Rules==
===Drawing Combat Units and Stratagems===
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Exercise Surging Storm 1.png
|text1  = During Exercise Surging Storm, you need to collect Combat Units and Stratagems to form lineups and do battle against the opposing lineup.<br>Each Wargame will consist of 10 rounds of battle. Different opponents will be encountered in each round.
|image2 = Tutorial Exercise Surging Storm 2.png
|text2  = Before each round of battle begins, you will get a certain number of chances to draw Combat Units and Stratagems.<br>Each round will feature a certain number of opportunities to reset your choices. This will let you reset your Combat Unit or Stratagem choices when selecting them.<br>The Combat Units and Stratagems you select will persist until the end of this Wargame.
|image3 = Tutorial Exercise Surging Storm 3.png
|text3  = In Round 1/3/5/7 of each Wargame, you will gain 1 chance to draw a Stratagem.<br>Stratagems can provide various buffs in the Wargame, and choosing them wisely can have a significant impact upon the outcome.
|image4 = Tutorial Exercise Surging Storm 4.png
|text4  = Combat units are split into Normal, Elite, and Apex classes, which each class starting at Level 20, 25, and 30 respectively.<br>As the Wargame proceeds, the chance of more elite Combat Units appearing will also increase. Elite units will appear after Round 2, and Apex units will appear after Round 5.
|image5 = Tutorial Exercise Surging Storm 5.png
|text5  = When you have 2 Combat Units of the same rank, you will instantly fuse them into 1 Combat Unit of higher rank.<br>You get Combat Units up to Rank 3 this way. The higher the Combat Unit's rank, the higher its Level and combat ability.
}}

===Preparation Phase===
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Exercise Surging Storm 6.png
|text1  = Before the battle starts, you can check your opponent's lineup and adjust your lineup to match. Make the best of this opportunity.
|image2 = Tutorial Exercise Surging Storm 7.png
|text2  = You can switch out units that are currently of little use in exchange for a chance to draw a new Combat Unit.<br>Each time you switch out a Rank 1/2/3 Combat Unit, you will gain 1/2/4 Reinforcement Points. Consume 3 points to gain 1 chance to draw a new unit.
}}

===Battle Phase===
{{Tutorial
|image1  = Tutorial Exercise Surging Storm 8.png
|text1   = After the battle begins, the Combat Units on both sides will automatically enter the field, advance toward their opponents, and attack.
|image2  = Tutorial Exercise Surging Storm 9.png
|text2   = Both sides can only deploy 1 Combat Unit at the same time at the start of each battle. As the battle grows more intense, the number of units that both sides can deploy at once will increase.<br>If the number of Combat Units on the field is below the current limit, units that have yet to deploy will enter the field in order, continuing the battle.
|image3 = Tutorial Exercise Surging Storm 10.png
|text3  = If the battle lasts for a certain amount of time without victory being decided, it will enter the Attrition Warfare phase, in which all Combat Units on the field will continuously lose HP.
|image4 = Tutorial Exercise Surging Storm 11.png
|text4  = During battle, the side that successfully defeats all opposing units is considered victorious.<br>The Wargame will end after completing 10 rounds of battle or after being defeated in 4 rounds of battle. Win as many battles as you can to win more Wargame Medals.
}}

===Strategic Countering===
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Exercise Surging Storm 12.png
|text1  = Different types of Combat Units are effective at countering certain other types:<br>AoE DMG units have a significant advantage against squad units.<br>At the same time, Melee units counter Ranged units, Ranged units counter Flying units, and Flying units counter Melee units.
|image2 = Tutorial Exercise Surging Storm 13.png
|text2  = Melee units have extremely high combat resilience, can take more DMG, and can protect other units to some extent.<br>Flying units can fly through the air, thus avoiding ground-based melee attacks and certain forms of AoE DMG.<br>Ranged units have long-range attacks with higher DMG, but are fragile by comparison. Most ranged attacks can strike Flying units.
