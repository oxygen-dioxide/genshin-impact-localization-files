==Profile==
<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->
Xamaran is a mushroom creature hailing from [[Sumeru]], and has the ability to communicate through the release of spores in the air. According to [[Tighnari]], it took a long time for Xamaran to achieve its current form. It has a certain affinity to [[The Chasm: Underground Mines|The Chasm]], specifically [[Lumenspar]], with [[Paimon]] and the [[Traveler]] being able to energize it by lending it energy from the [[Lumenstone Adjuvant]].

It is said that Xamaran was a name it took up from an old friend in Sumeru,<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Liyue|Shroom-Kin}}</ref> and "Sheeshroom" is a nickname created by Paimon brought about by her surprise that Xamaran could talk.

During the Traveler's adventures in [[Natlan]], they discover that Xamaran is an offshoot of the Sage-Lord of Fungi, [[Bifrons]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Field Fungal Traces}}</ref> However, Xamaran has long since been disconnected with its progenitor, and speaks of Bifrons with disdain.

===Appearance===
Xamaran is a giant glowing mushroom.

::'''Xamaran:''' Well then... How does it fare?
::'''Paimon:''' Worse than you for sure.
