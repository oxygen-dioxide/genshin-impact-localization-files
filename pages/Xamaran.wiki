==Profile==
<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->
Xamaran is a mushroom creature hailing from Sumeru, and has the ability to communicate through the release of spores in the air. It has a certain affinity to [[The Chasm]], specifically [[Lumenspar]], with [[Paimon]] and the [[Traveler]] being able to energize it by lending it energy from the [[Lumenstone Adjuvant]].

It is said that Xamaran was a name it took up from an old friend in Sumeru,<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Shroom-Kin}}</ref> and "Sheeshroom" is a nickname created by Paimon brought about by her surprise that Xamaran could talk.

===Personality===
Xamaran is shown to have a playful and even bard-like demeanor, talking in a poetic manner with an almost innocently jesting tone. It has a personal view on social hierarchy, holding creatures without legs in the highest regard and creatures with more legs lower on the hierarchy.

===Appearance===
Xamaran is a giant glowing mushroom.
