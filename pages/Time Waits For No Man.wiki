{{Quest Description|Mondstadt's crisis has passed, but Cyrus seems... unhappy?}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talking to Cyrus)
:'''Cyrus:''' Bah, [[Stormterror]] was defeated, just like that? We didn't even get the chance to take the stage...
:{{DIcon}} What's the matter?
:'''Cyrus:''' Oh, if it isn't the Honorary Knight. The storms have ceased, and Stormterror has been defeated.
:'''Cyrus:''' This is a good thing, yes... But couldn't Stormterror have put up a bit more of a fight?
:'''Cyrus:''' And here I was thinking that after clearing the monsters surrounding the city out, we could select some elite adventurers to form a team of dragon hunters to challenge Stormterror!
:'''Cyrus:''' But just as we were having trouble finding a healer, Stormterror was defeated.
:'''Cyrus:''' We also need to help the citizens find cats and dogs, send meals and clean house... At this rate, we'll have lost our opportunity for sure...
:'''Cyrus:''' *sigh* Let's leave that aside for now. I've heard from our scouts that there are still monsters wandering the [[Whispering Woods]].
:'''Cyrus:''' But our forces are scattered throughout the wilds and cannot return, and I must handle some assorted matters.
:'''Cyrus:''' Could I trouble you to go to the Whispering Woods and see to the situation there?
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
::'''Cyrus:''' Thank you. I will be handling commissions here...
::'''Cyrus:''' A signboard blown away by the wind... Flowers blown away by the wind... A lost cat... *sigh* It is as I expected...
:{{DIcon}} I have other matters to handle...
::'''Cyrus:''' Ah. Go about your business, then. Now that Stormterror has been vanquished, these things aren't so urgent...

;(Approaching the first location)
:'''Paimon:''' Look at all those barrels of [[Pyro Slime]]! Only those monsters would dare do something so dangerous. Let's help them clear these away, shall we?
----
;(Approaching the second location)
:'''Paimon:''' Look at this tower... Are the monsters preparing to build a camp here?
----
;(Approaching the third location)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Paimon's got a bad feeling about this bonfire. Wonder what they could be using it for?
;(After defeating all the monsters)
:'''Paimon:''' There's still so many monsters... Seems we've only seen the beginning of them...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go tell Cyrus what we've seen here.
----
;(Talking to Cyrus)
:'''Cyrus:''' Back so soon? Well then, I suppose nothing serious is happening...
:{{DIcon}} No, there's still a lot of monster activity.
:'''Cyrus:''' What? There are still monsters wandering around, and in even greater numbers than before?
:'''Cyrus:''' That's strange. Wasn't the large force that attacked Mondstadt defeated previously? Why are they still skulking about in the area?
:'''Cyrus:''' Could they have some other plans? ...I must gather the adventurers and re-issue our commissions. We cannot take these monsters lightly.
:'''Cyrus:''' Conducting careful investigations into the activities of monsters in the wild falls within the purview of the Adventurers' Guild. It's time to show everyone what we're made of!
:'''Cyrus:''' Ah, yes. Please take these for your efforts.
