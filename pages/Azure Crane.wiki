'''Azure Crane''' is a type of bird. It can be found both as [[Wildlife]] and as a pet in the [[Serenitea Pot]].

In the wild, they will usually be found in groups. Getting too close to them will cause them to fly away, so to properly hunt them, bow and [[Plunging Attack]]s are recommended.

In the Serenitea Pot, cranes will not be startled when you approach them, but will fly away if you try to hit them. They will respawn at their original location a few seconds later.

Outdoor animals can only be placed in outdoor spaces within the Serenitea Pot.

==Drops==
{{Card|Fowl|2}}

==Locations==
Can be found north of [[Windrise]], and west of [[Falcon Coast]].
