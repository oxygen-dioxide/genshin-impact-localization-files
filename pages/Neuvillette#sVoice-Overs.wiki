|vo_01_01_tx         = Greetings. I am the Chief Justice, or "Iudex" of [[Fontaine]], but you may simply address me by using my surname, "Neuvillette." Not because I wish to keep my distance from you... No, I am merely conscious that being overly familiar may bring the impartiality of the judiciary into question in some people's eyes.<br>If you have any requests or concerns, then &mdash; to the extent permissible by law, at least &mdash; we can sit down and discuss them together as we partake of some imported water from [[Qiaoying Village]].

|vo_02_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Chat - Water Tasting.ogg
|vo_02_02_tx         = Water comes in many flavors to the discerning palate. [[Mondstadt]]'s water is crisp and pure, while water from [[Liyue]] has an enduring aftertaste. In [[Inazuma]], the water possesses a depth of flavor unlike any other. [[Sumeru]]'s water, meanwhile, has a rich and complex flavor profile, but it must be savored patiently to fully appreciate it.

Well, never mind. I don't think that the Hydro Dragon would "weep," per se. I think he just finds himself a little stirred when he gets a taste of the tears that have been shed on this land, on account of all the emotions they contain.

|vo_05_03_tx         = This is a topic that's been discussed ad nauseum... I don't mean to condescend to humanity, but it is quite clear to me that society's concepts of justice, fairness, equality, and rule of law are not equivalent, and can never be. Now of course, water always seeks its own level, and it was in this spirit that the previous Hydro Archon, [[Egeria]], hoped to achieve universal equality by connecting all things with love. Her [[Furina|successor]] chose instead to seek equality by means of the law. But ultimately, due to various external factors, this unfortunately manifested itself in the distorted form of trials for the sake of trials. Nevertheless, there are reasons for everything. I should refrain from criticizing her.

Besides this, I pardoned the sins of humanity long ago, so I can promise you that my future judgments will not cause any harm to the common folk. Nevertheless, my grievances with the [[The Seven|usurpers]] have yet to be settled... They owe a debt of blood that shall not be forgotten.

That being said, my grievances with the usurpers have yet to be settled... They owe a debt of blood that shall not be forgotten.

|vo_07_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About the Vision - I.ogg
|vo_07_01_tx         = I was once advised to wear a counterfeit Vision, so that I might more easily intervene during moments of crisis. To be quite frank, I was not enamored by this suggestion, nor the implication that one must only exercise the power that is rightfully theirs under false pretenses. With that said, however, I have developed a newfound appreciation for the value of human yearning and determination having spent considerable time around Vision-bearing humans.

|vo_07_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share - Laws.ogg
|vo_07_03_tx         = Fontaine does have some rather intriguing laws on its books. For instance, "it is forbidden to release any flying objects during the first three days of each month," "during the dry season, all bivalves that wash ashore belong to the [[Hydro Archon]], while other mollusks belong to the people," "no domestic pets shall be named after [[Furina]]," "tomato ketchup is to be consumed in restaurants only as a condiment, never on its own," and, finally, "Melusines are to be addressed using she/her pronouns, never the impersonal it/its"... That last one was my personal contribution.

|vo_07_05_tx         = The Vishaps' ancestry can be traced directly back to the [[Fontemer]], which is why they are so adept at evolution. I am reminded of an old custom that the dragons once observed: We would take a sip of our perished young brethren's blood. Whenever the tides are disrupted by the motion of the moon and stars, the water within the bodies of us [[Hydro]] organisms surges up towards our heads, reminding us that our deceased kin will soon be revived.

|vo_07_06_file       = VO_{language}{character} Interesting Things - Humans.ogg
|vo_07_06_tx         = From my observations, humans have a tendency to view themselves as being in opposition with nature. And whenever this point is raised, someone is always quick to respond by declaring that humans are in fact a part of nature, like any other organism. To someone like me, however, who knows an inkling of the truth, what would be most beneficial is if human civilization and the natural world of this planet could seek ways to co-exist with one another.

|vo_08_01_tx         = Nothing will stop me from rendering judgment on each of The Seven. As the Archon who won the Authority of [[Geo]], Deus Auri must be called to trial. If one does not wish to see us on opposite sides of a conflict, they need not worry, for I intend to stay in Fontaine for the foreseeable future, which could well mean another four hundred years. As another point of consolation, even when the trial eventually takes place, it is still not a given that the judgment will lead to a physical confrontation.

|vo_08_05_tx         = Wriothesley is a trustworthy man. I fought hard for the title and reputation he now has. I expect you to think that I've simply been duped by his flattery and appearance of loyalty... But to that, I would quote the Inazuman proverb: "The words unspoken are the flower."

Though she is meek and full of doubt by nature, she was able to use madness to stiffen her resolve and see her duty through to its conclusion. The work that she has done over the centuries is truly immense. If she were to ever make a return to the stage, I should personally attend the performance and give her my heartfelt applause...

Nevertheless, I must wear these garments to maintain the dignity of a Chief Justice, and endure whatever inconveniences this entails. Incidentally, the world at large appears to operate on this general principle, too. Everyone is faced with an identity that they must accept, endure, understand, and eventually learn to co-exist with. This has been my experience all along.
