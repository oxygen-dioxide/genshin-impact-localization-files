No, no, it's not that I don't want to, I'm just not sure my crazy sleep schedule will really work for you... But uh, I guess... I look forward to working with you!

And there's a few charts to be appended to the mid-term report, which... yep, she hasn't even started drawing up yet. Alright, time to get to work. ...Huh? What're you doing up?

|vo_05_01_tx         = According to my textbook, "Using theoretical astrology to solve specific problems in our daily lives should not be our primary goal." But whether we should or not, the real reason nobody does it is that... well, it's just... it's not worth the effort. When we do a prediction, we usually have to use multiple celestial globes and consult at least one whole year's worth of Star Charts to get any... precise answers. To go through all that just to find out whether the price of spices will go up tomorrow... I mean, it's just not worth it...

Huh, maybe I should just drop out and go back home.

The first time I saw one, I was scared speechless! Huh? Are you interested? If you just want to take a quick look... lemme put in an application for you, I think it should be fine... I think...?

I don't fall asleep easily to begin with, but now there's this little flying bug somewhere in my room... The buzzing is so loud, and it never stops... but I&mdash;I've tried, but I just can't find it... *groan*

I have a lot of respect for... amazing people.

|vo_08_03_tx         = Oh... D&mdash;Dori... ahem... I took the plunge and bought something from her once. She looked euphoric as I was settling the bill &mdash; I think she assumed I was some sort of mega-rich person. Kept relentlessly sending product ads to me in the mail afterwards. Ugh... biggest mistake of my life! I paid such a huge price for it... 'cause not only did I spend all of my scholarship money in one go, but for most of the next year, I had to survive mainly on cheap vegetables, and I couldn't buy textbooks unless they were on sale...

|vo_08_05_tx         = ...Huh, I saw someone who matches that description when I woke up after sleepwalking for the first time. "Candace," huh? Now I know. I still remember the moment I woke up... All of my reports and essays were done. At the time, it felt like... like after pleading to the stars for days and days, now they'd finally heard me, and sent a messenger to help me... I felt so touched!

You have to use a ruler, then do some calculations on paper, then check past Starlogs... Before you know it, the whole day is gone.
