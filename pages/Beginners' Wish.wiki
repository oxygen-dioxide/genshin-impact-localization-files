{{Description|Dear Travelers: The Beginners' Wish is available! Win new characters, grab new weapons, and assemble your dream team!<ref>Twitter: [https://twitter.com/GenshinImpact/status/1310580022193733632 Official Announcement]</ref>}}

The '''Beginners' Wish''' is a [[Novice Wish]] that has no time limit and is aimed at Travelers who have recently landed in [[Teyvat]], serving as the introduction to the [[Wish]] system.

The Beginners' Wish expires automatically after amounting a total of 20 wishes, after which the Wish will disappear permanently. It is not possible to exceed the limit. A limited selection of non-promotional characters and weapons are available.

For the Beginners' Wish, 10-wish sets cost 20% less [[Acquaint Fate]] (only 8 instead of 10), and your first 10-wish set is guaranteed to include "Chivalric Blossom" [[Noelle]] ({{Geo}})! Your second 10-wish set is guaranteed to include one other 4 or 5-star character!<ref>Based on in-game description</ref>

For more information about rates and mechanics, see the [[Wishes]] page.

==Item Pool==
The starter characters [[Amber]], [[Lisa]] and [[Kaeya]] and 4-star characters added to the Standard Wish after [[Version 1.0]] cannot be obtained from this wish. Apart from the single guarantee, which is always on the 8th wish,<ref>HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/497840 Statistical model for Genshin Impact's droprates]</ref> [[Noelle]] cannot be obtained from this wish.

The Wish's pool does not contain any 4-star or 5-star weapons.
