==Part I: The Blazing Stars Ring in Fortune==
{{Main|The Blazing Stars Ring in Fortune}}

Returning to Liyue to celebrate the [[Lantern Rite]], the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] head to Yuehai Pavilion and find [[Ningguang]] sending her secretaries off. Ningguang greets the pair and explains that after the recent events in Liyue, she and the others decided to incorporate fireworks into the year's festival and explains the history of fireworks to them. The two then decide to visit [[Keqing]], who is busy organizing the fireworks.

Down at the harbor, they find Keqing finishing up preparations with [[Pengyi]]. Keqing greets the three before she takes her leave, being the busy Yuheng she is. Ningguang remarks that Keqing has always been busy but is concerned about her health as she insists on doing most of the work herself instead of asking her subordinates to do so. The Traveler offers to help check in on Keqing as Pengyi gives them a [[Launch Tube]]. When Paimon suggests asking a friend for help, the Traveler immediately thinks of [[Zhongli]] and heads to the [[Wangsheng Funeral Parlor]]. The [[Ferrylady]] informs them that Zhongli went out with the [[Hu Tao|director]] to [[Third-Round Knockout]].

Arriving at the restaurant, the two find Zhongli, Hu Tao, [[Xiangling]] and [[Guoba]] at a table and join in. Hu Tao, Xiangling and Guoba leave to allow the Traveler and Zhongli to have a private conversation. Zhongli listens and suggests that they indirectly inform Keqing to take a breather by telling a story incorporating her daily life and those of her friends. Keqing then inexplicably arrives, having sought the Traveler. She explains that she wanted to give some festive gifts to the [[adepti]], worried that they had forgotten about her and her sudden intrusion to their lands. She had sought out [[Ganyu]] at first but as she was on leave. The Traveler accepts and tells her that they would like to watch the fireworks with her once her work's done, which she also accepts.

==Part II: Sky-Gazers, Land-Walkers==
{{Main|Sky-Gazers, Land-Walkers}}

The Traveler arrives at the [[Jade Chamber]] to meet up with Keqing, who has already finished up the last of the gifts for the adepti. She decides to first start off with [[Madame Ping]] and head to Yuehai Pavilion where they find her talking with [[Yanfei]]. Keqing gives the two some of the gifts which they accept, during which Ping asks Yanfei to keep her health in consideration as she works during the Lantern Rite.

Keqing then decides to visit [[Cloud Retainer]] at [[Mt. Aocang]]; when they arrive, they also find Ganyu, who is surprised by their arrival. She gives Cloud Retainer the gifts, which she gracefully accepts, taking particular interest in the Launch Tube. Keqing asks Cloud Retainer where [[Mountain Shaper]] and [[Moon Carver]] are as she also wishes to give them gifts, but she tells her that the two have gone missing on a "trip" before realizing the two might have gone on a journey together but promises to keep the gifts for the two adepti. [[Shenhe]] soon arrives with some food from the harbor. The Traveler asks Cloud Retainer if she had seen [[Xiao]], who tells her that she hadn't. Cloud Retainer then tries to talk about a story from Ganyu's childhood, but Ganyu excuses herself under the pretense of important work which Keqing tries to support. Cloud Retainer does not press the issue further and remarks about how busy Ganyu is, asking Keqing to watch her health. She explains to Paimon that if one were to exhaust themselves in work, they would not be able to enjoy the benefits of their work before she and Shenhe depart.

With the gifts delivered, the only adepti left to give them to is Xiao and they decide to head to [[Wangshu Inn]] since he usually hangs out there. Upon arrival, they run into [[Baizhu]] and [[Qiqi]] by chance, who had just returned from picking herbs for the incoming festival. Baizhu remarks on how busy Keqing is even during the Lantern Rite. The two then head to [[Verr Goldet]], who tells them that Xiao is likely on the rooftop terrace.

Once there, Xiao surprises the three by warping into them. Keqing gives him the gifts, which he somewhat declines as he is only focused on keeping Liyue safe from demons before he leaves. With all the gifts delivered, Keqing suggests a break and they head downstairs, where they find Pengyi. Pengyi informs her that after delivering the fireworks to [[Qingce Village]], the fireworks were stolen. Keqing decides to investigate herself, but the Traveler insists on coming along. She tells Pengyi to prepare another batch of fireworks, this time with an escort.

Arriving at the village, they speak to [[Granny Ruoxin]] who informs them of where the fireworks were being held. Upon arrival, they spot footprints on the ground and follow their tracks to the outskirts of the village when they hear a commotion and join in. They find [[Xingqiu]] and his servants alongside [[Chongyun]] apprehending a [[Treasure Hoarder]] named [[Kangsheng]]. Kangsheng claims that he and his group wouldn't have attacked if he knew who the convoy was affiliated with due to the [[Feiyun Commerce Guild]]'s influence. Keqing tells Xingqiu to have his servants bring him to the harbor for interrogation, which he gladly obliges with. The two young men then learn of the fireworks theft and agree to protect the village for the time being while Keqing heads off to investigate who might have stolen the fireworks, telling the Traveler to rest.

==Part III: The Stars Inscribe the Year's Wishes==
{{Main|The Stars Inscribe the Year's Wishes}}

[[File:Fleeting Colors in Flight Event Cutscene Animation- "Age of Flowing Hues" - Genshin Impact|thumb]]
After resting, the Traveler catches up with Keqing who had just finished her investigation; a group of Treasure Hoarders were responsible for the thefts and she found their cache of stolen goods left unguarded. The Traveler chooses to accompany her to the location, where they find [[Xingxiu]] and his group and apprehend the criminals. They surrender upon after a brief scuffle upon realizing that they're fighting the Yuheng and Xingxiu admits that he and his men were stealing fireworks to create a ruckus in the city so they could steal plenty of items. Keqing departs to scout the area to apprehend any more thieves, tasking the Traveler with bringing the criminals to the village to hand them over to the Millelith.

Upon arriving at the village, Xingqiu and Chongyun depart due to their busy schedule as the criminals are put into custody. They then hear fireworks explode in the distance; the Traveler, fearing that Xingxiu's group were alerting their fellow thieves, heads to the location where they find Keqing. Keqing states that she was messing around with the fireworks and accidentally set them off, but reassures them that all of the criminals had been apprehended before she leaves to seal the case, telling them to spend time in the city. As Paimon remarks on how busy Keqing is, the Traveler remembers Zhongli and they head off to meet him.

Returning to the city, Zhongli had just finished a conversation with [[Yun Jin]]. Paimon brings up the idea of a food-related story with a chef who cooked excellent food but eventually lost his reputation due to stubbornness. Zhongli approves of the story's meaning and wishes the Traveler luck as they head to Keqing. Outside the Ministry of Civil Affairs, they spot Keqing wrapping up business with [[Jingcheng]]. Jingcheng correctly takes the Traveler's arrival as a reminder for Keqing to take a break, stating that he could handle the new patrol plans to protect the city.

Keqing accompanies the Traveler to the Jade Chamber where she changes into her [[Opulent Splendor|new dress]] that Ningguang had tailored for her. The firework show starts as everyone across Liyue, including the adepti, celebrate the Lantern Rite.

==The Roiling Waves Hide Pearls From Sight==
{{Main|Petal-Lit Ships Fish For the Moon}}

Arriving at the Jade Chamber, the Traveler speaks with Ningguang who informs them that she is still seeking to replace what she had lost from her original Jade Chamber after dropping it on [[Osial]]. Having tasked Beidou with reclaiming as much as possible, she suggests they visit Beidou at the Crux.

Upon arriving at the ship, they find Beidou with [[Xinyan]], who is relieved to learn of the Traveler's assistance in the endeavor as she and her crew have been trying their best to claim as much of Ningguang's belongings as possible, although the massive sea and their larger ships meant they have some difficulty doing so. The Traveler offers their own [[Waverider|boat]] for the job, which the two women find somewhat cramped but suitable for collecting treasure.

While they explore the ocean around [[Guyun Stone Forest]], they find Treasure Hoarders collecting treasure too. The first trail leads to a group led by [[Carmen]]; after realizing who he's up against, he quickly surrenders all of his goods and flees with his crew. Further investigation leads to another group led by [[Liuliu]], who also flees with his crew without the treasures despite trying to stall for time. Beidou, realizing the Traveler's boat is too small to carry the goods, decides to have all of the collected items dumped in the area so they could collect it all in one go, worried that [[Sea Drake]] and his men might run into more Treasure Hoarders. She tells them to report back to Ningguang.

Returning to the Jade Chamber, the Traveler informs Ningguang of the situation. She thanks them for their assistance and tells them to enjoy the Lantern Rite.

==The Lantern-Lights Reflect Clear Dreams==
{{Main|The Bright-Windowed Lanterns Hide Their Shadows}}
While walking around Liyue Harbor, the Traveler and Paimon come across [[Yuan Rong]]'s latest invention, the "Shadow Lantern". She explains how it works and the Traveler decides to try it out.
