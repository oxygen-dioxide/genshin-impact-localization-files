A '''Flying Energy Thief''' is an exploration mechanic found in the {{Location|Geode Mine Shaft}}. They are floating, glowing balls that move within the mine, and which explode upon nearing the player. The explosion is physically harmless, but will neutralize any [[Fixed Storage Device and Energy Transfer Device|Energy Transfer Device]] the player is holding. Exploded thieves respawn immediately within the mine. During the {{Quest|An Eye for an Eye}}, the player must avoid them while carrying devices through the mine to complete their objective.
