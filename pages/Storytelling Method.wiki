{{Quest Description|[[Junkichi]] seems to be struggling with his writing again...}}

{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Junkichi:''' ...So this is the structure I have in mind this time.
:'''Junkichi:''' The supremely-skilled ninja uses all sorts of abilities to infiltrate the enemy fortress and retrieve the required intel in secret...
:'''Shigeru:''' *sigh* And how many "abilities" are you going to give this ninja this time?
:'''Junkichi:''' Th&mdash;That, uh, might depend on the situation?
:'''Shigeru:''' Right. So you haven't thought about it, then.
:'''Junkichi:''' I mean, it's fine! I mean, if you lock down all the narrative devices ahead of time, there's nowhere to adapt from there, right?
:'''Shigeru:''' Oh, here you go again. If you had these devices locked in beforehand, your writing wouldn't go all over the shop!
:'''Junkichi:''' I&mdash;I have my own creative methods, alright? The story should put its narrative first. How can it be shackled by these devices?
:'''Shigeru:''' That's just irresponsible, you...
:{{DIcon}} What are you two arguing about?
:'''Junkichi:''' Oh, its you! I was just thinking about to structure a novel about a ninja.
:'''Junkichi:''' But Shigeru's criticizing the structures that I came up with again...
:'''Shigeru:''' I'm not saying that what you've come up with is bad, per se. I'm just asking you to put your narrative devices in place first before you start writing...
:'''Junkichi:''' No, no... I'm not going to list them all down and structure the narrative around them. That's just too staid!
:'''Junkichi:''' The narrative is the most important thing in the novel, which everything else revolves around, even the setting and narrative devices...
:'''Shigeru:''' You...
:'''Junkichi:''' I...
:{{DIcon}} Alright, cut it out.
:{{DIcon}} Let's call a halt to this real quick, shall we?
:'''Shigeru:''' Forget it, you're not going to listen to me anyway...
:'''Junkichi:''' I'm sticking to my creative principles no matter what you say.
:'''Shigeru:''' *sigh* ...You know what, Traveler? Since you're here, why don't you be the judge?
:{{DIcon}} And how am I supposed to judge...
:{{DIcon}} Am I supposed to read his novel right here and now?
:'''Shigeru:''' Uh, no, you just need to listen to Junkichi tell us the structure of this new narrative passage he's dreamed up.
:'''Shigeru:''' After that, just use your judgment and think about how his ninja would act.
:'''Shigeru:''' That way, Junkichi should get the feedback he needs about what happens when he just writes his story willy-nilly.
:'''Junkichi:''' Hmph, sure. Well, Traveler, we're counting on you.
:'''Junkichi:''' I'll narrate the story for you. Just act according to what you think is natural.
:'''Junkichi:''' Let's show Shigeru how awesome a story unbound by these... narrative devices can be!
:'''Shigeru:''' You...
:'''Junkichi:''' I...
:{{DIcon}} Let's just start...
:{{DIcon}} This creativity business sure is tiring...
:'''Junkichi:''' Well, let's begin, Traveler.
:'''Junkichi:''' So, as I was writing, this ninja is entering the enemy fortress solo, preparing to steal critical intelligence.
:'''Junkichi:''' Hehe, Traveler, are you ready to play the stealthy ninja?
:'''Junkichi:''' Having made all the necessary preparations, the ninja infiltrates the fortress stealthily...
----
;(After entering the domain)
;(If Traveler move backward and into the first room)
::'''Junkichi:''' The ninja, being very vigilant, scouts the area thoroughly before acting... and he finds nothing out of place.

;(Move forward towards the ladder)
:'''Junkichi:''' After infiltrating the fortress, the ninja prepares to initiate the operation. He is sure that the intelligence was hidden beside a fake tree within the fortress itself...

;(Standing on the breakable planks) <!--No longer possible to trigger this line?-->
::'''Junkichi:''' The wooden planks below seem rather fragile, so the ninja thinks that he might find some way to break them.

;(After breaking the planks and drops down)
:'''Junkichi:''' The ninja discovers guards ahead. The broken wooden planks must've alerted the enemy. The ninja decides to find a way around them...

;(If Traveler didn't alert the enemy and up the stairs)
::'''Junkichi:''' Using his amazing agility, the ninja passes through this room without alerting anyone... What a brilliant move!
;(If Traveler defeated the enemy and up the stairs)
::'''Junkichi:''' And failing that... Then defeating them is still an option!
;(If Traveler alerted the enemy and up the stairs)
::'''Junkichi:''' Oh no, the ninja alerts the enemy, and they come in hot pursuit!
:;(After defeating the enemies)
::'''Junkichi:''' Fortunately, the ninja's... uh, direct combat skills as also very good, and he defeats them all with ease!

;(Enter a room with another breakable planks)
:'''Junkichi:''' Yet another tightly locked room lies ahead, but the ninja adroitly discovers that perhaps the weak wooden flooring might serve as an entry point.

;(Standing beside the window into a room with 2 enemies)
::'''Junkichi:''' On the other side of the window, the ninja finds yet another room next door. But he should focus on his missions...
;(If Traveler approaches the 2 enemies)
::'''Junkichi:''' Wait, what are you doing here... Oh, I guess I can just write that the ninja checks his surroundings to be sure that it's safe...
::'''Junkichi:''' Maybe the ninja can also look for a few other trinkets while he's at it.
::'''Junkichi:''' What? I didn't write his character to be like that!

;(If Traveler investigates the shining points nearby)
::'''Junkichi:''' Aha! Vegetables! Guess we shan't leave empty-handed!
::'''Junkichi:''' I must say that your searching skills are like that of a... uh, a vigilant, professional ninja.

;(If Traveler drops down through the elevator shaft) <!--Won't trigger this line if the mechanism already activated this line-->
::'''Junkichi:''' Oh no! The ninja seems to have activated a mechanism... An alarm... something! The enemy has discovered him!
:
:;(After defeating the enemies)
::'''Junkichi:''' The ninja defeats the enemy with his mastery of martial arts. Time to go get that intelligence...

;(Standing outside the room with 3 Precious Chest)
::'''Junkichi:''' The next room is full of treasure, but the ninja is unmoved. He is a true professional, and will certainly not deviate to perform some side quest.
;(If Traveler enters the room with chests)
::'''Junkichi:''' Hey! That treasure chest is empty, too, really! Come on, please, can you just follow my outline!?
;(If Traveler opens chests)
::'''Junkichi:''' I already said there's nothing inside. I haven't finished thinking yet... Well, nevermind. The ninja eventually decides to leave this room.

;(Reaches the room with the final objective)
:'''Junkichi:''' This should be where the intel is. The ninja decides to check the fake tree.

;(If Traveler approaches a drum)
::'''Junkichi:''' It's a fake tree! Or it's clearly a drum! ...Well, whatever. The ninja carefully searches around the drum...
::'''Junkichi:''' There's nothing around the drum! But the ninja is still quite pleased. At least he now knows that there's... nothing beside the drum...
;(If Traveler approaches the wall of the room)
::'''Junkichi:''' The ninja feels that perhaps his surroundings might hide some unspeakable secret, and so he searches carefully...
::'''Junkichi:''' But there really is nothing here...

;(Approaches the final objective)
:'''Junkichi:''' This should be that fake tree, and the ninja searches carefully...

;(Investigates the final objective)
:'''Junkichi:''' The ninja finds the intel successfully! Now he can return and make his report.
:'''Shigeru:''' If I might interrupt, what's the intel exactly? Why's it just a box?
:'''Junkichi:''' I&mdash;I haven't finished thinking yet! ...Whatever the case, the ninja has the intel now!

;(If Traveler go to the exit point shortly after completing final objective)
::'''Junkichi:''' The ninja checks that he has the box with the intelligence inside it in hand, and he prepares to leave.
:
:;(During the dialogue, if Traveler leave the exit point, away from the hallway) <!--This trigger need to verify, going into the hallway didn't trigger this line-->
::'''Junkichi:''' H&mdash;He prepares to leave... Hey, the ninja's leaving to report back. What are you planning to do?
;(If Traveler didn't approach the exit shortly after completing final objective and later enters the back room with enemies)
::'''Junkichi:''' Oh, come on... The ninja's actions have been discovered by the enemy, and large numbers of them surround him on every side. The ninja believes that it's time to go.
:;(After defeating the enemies in the back room)
::'''Junkichi:''' What? Why do I have to write the ninja as being this good as fighting... The ninja defeated all the enemies...
::'''Junkichi:''' The ninja gazes upon the foes he has defeated. It's *really* time to leave now...
----
;(After exiting the domain)
:'''Junkichi:''' Alright, that's a wrap.
:'''Junkichi:''' I've... never been this tired. Was this story always that complicated...
:'''Shigeru:''' That's what you get when you don't decide on things early. Without narrative devices to restrain you, the various elements just clash wildly against each other.
:'''Shigeru:''' When that happens, you'll end up losing control over the plot altogether. You'd exhaust yourself no matter what you were writing.
:'''Junkichi:''' *sigh* Alright, alright... I've got no strength left to argue with you. Traveler, thanks for your... judgment.
:'''Junkichi:''' I think I've gained a lot from this...
:'''Junkichi:''' Take this as a token of my thanks. I'll get to writing again shortly.
:'''Junkichi:''' Hmm, narrative devices or narrative... Which is more important?
