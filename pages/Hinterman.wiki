::'''Hinterman:''' Please do.
:;(Opens [[#Shop|Shop]] menu)
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Hinterman knows)
:::'''Hinterman:''' A kind client told me that there's a place around here that produces [[Condessence Crystal]]s and Magical Crystal Ore, asking if I'd need some to reinforce my fishing boat.
:::'''Hinterman:''' I don't need any right now, but it'd be a shame to not put them to good use. If you're interested, perhaps you can go have a look around here, eh?
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]] marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more Magical Crystal Ore Veins Hinterman knows)
:::'''Hinterman:''' I'm sorry. I was busy with my fish stall, so if there was, I didn't notice.
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Hinterman:''' Welcome to [[Poisson]], a little place for us fishermen.
::'''Hinterman:''' The sights here aren't as grand as you'll see in the [[Court of Fontaine|city]], but everyone here lives a leisurely life.
::'''Hinterman:''' Ah, yes. I should probably mention that the terrain here can be quite slippery, so if you're here to travel, do watch your step.
:{{DIcon}} I'm fine for now.
::'''Hinterman:''' Take care, then.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing {{cx}}.''
{{Dialogue Start}}

:{{DIcon|Shop}} Could I buy some fish?
::'''Hinterman:''' Oh, so you're really here to do that? Well, in that case, please go ahead.
:;(Opens [[#Shop|Shop]] menu)
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are Magical Crystal Ore Veins Hinterman knows)
:::'''Hinterman:''' A kind client told me that there's a place around here that produces Condessence Crystals and Magical Crystal Ore, asking if I'd need some to reinforce my fishing boat.
:::'''Hinterman:''' I don't need any right now, but it'd be a shame to not put them to good use. If you're interested, perhaps you can go have a look around here, eh?

:::'''Hinterman:''' I'm sorry. I was busy with my fish stall, so if there was, I didn't notice.
:{{DIcon}} How are things in town?
::'''Hinterman:''' Normal, ever-constant, just like our lady [[Navia]]'s burning passion.
::'''Hinterman:''' Thanks for your concern, though, and if you should meet the Boss later, do take care of her on our behalf too, alright?
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Hinterman:''' Sure. Thanks for your help!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #3===
''Available after step 5 in ''[[Deluge of Wrathful Waters]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hinterman:''' Isn't this the Boss's friend? Things haven't been so good around Poisson recently. I know you're not from around here, but I wouldn't recommend tarrying.
:{{DIcon}} It's that bad, huh?
::'''Hinterman:''' *sigh* The water rises quickly and recedes quickly. While it seems to be subsiding now, you never know when it'll be back.
:{{DIcon}} Take care.
::'''Hinterman:''' Yes, I will.
::'''Hinterman:''' But someone's gotta be on guard here at all times. We can't let some random person wander in here again by accident and get themselves killed.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #4===
''Available after completing ''[[Masquerade of the Guilty]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hinterman:''' Oh my, aren't you the Boss's friend? Welcome! Though things haven't been so good around Poisson recently, which may inconvenience you.
:{{DIcon}} What's going on?
::'''Hinterman:''' Boss said that the crisis in the "prophecy" had passed, so loads of people came back to town. We're all pitching in, so reconstruction is coming along nicely.
::'''Hinterman:''' It's still a little chaotic though, and people can hurt themselves if they're not careful. That's why I'm on guard here, to stop any outsiders from wandering in by accident.
:{{DIcon}} It's fine. I'm here to look around.
::'''Hinterman:''' Well... just watch your step. You don't want to get hurt.
{{Dialogue End}}

::'''Hinterman:''' Thanks for your concern, though if you meet the Boss later, do take care of her on our behalf too, alright? She's gone through a lot, she has.
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Hinterman:''' Sure, and thanks!
