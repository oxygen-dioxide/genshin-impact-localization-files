The '''Art of Khemia''' is a form of [[alchemy]] that was developed in and primarily used by the people of [[Khaenri'ah]]. Because Khaenri'ah was an underground nation with little natural fauna, the Art of Khemia focuses on the creation of life; its capabilities are vastly different from those practiced in the Seven Nations of [[Teyvat]].

500 years ago, the Art of Khemia was a major factor in the fall of Khaenri'ah during the [[cataclysm]].

Details about how the Art of Khemia was developed or how it works are currently unknown. Those who have attained the pinnacle of learning and alchemical prowess are capable of creating synthetic life, the "apex achievement" of alchemy.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Snowy Past}}</ref> Currently, the only known person to have attained this level of ability is [[Rhinedottir|"Gold" Rhinedottir]].

The Art of Khemia played a major role in the cataclysm 500 years ago, which resulted in the destruction of Khaenri'ah at the hands of the [[gods]].<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/xOJfaOI87XU Collected Miscellany - "Albedo: Kreideprinz"]</ref><ref>{{Ref/VO|Venti|About Albedo}}</ref> As such, both [[Dainsleif]] and [[Venti]] &mdash; who were present for the fall of Khaenri'ah &mdash; express their apprehension over Albedo's practice of it.

===Synthetic Lifeforms===

While Rhinedottir created many monsters, whose invasion of Teyvat contributed to a large part of the conflicts during the cataclysm, she considered only two of her creations to be "miraculous beings": the dragon [[Durin]] and [[Albedo]], her successful synthetic human.

The star-shaped mark on Albedo's neck was left after sealing the area where life force was infused into his vessel. He likens it to a birthmark and a {{wt|pontil mark||English}} left on glassware made through {{w|glassblowing}}.<ref name="SAS2">{{Ref/Quest|The Shadows Deepen}}</ref>

Before she created Albedo, Rhinedottir produced another [[Primordial Albedo|"abandoned experiment"]] during her Primordial Human Project. After deeming it a failure, she apparently had him devoured by Durin, allowing him to eventually reemerge after Durin's death over [[Dragonspine]].<ref name="SAS2" />

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
*The Ancient Greek word {{Lang|mini=1|el=Χημία|el_rm=Khēmía|el_tl=black earth}} is a possible root for the Arabic word {{Lang|''al-kīmiyā''|ar={{wt|الكيمياء‎||Arabic}}}}, from which the English word ''alchemy'' was derived.<ref>Wikipedia: {{w|Alchemy#Etymology|Alchemy § Etymology}}</ref>
