'''Yuegui''' is a mechanical device created by [[Cloud Retainer]] for [[Yaoyao]].<ref name="cs">{{Ref/CS|Yaoyao|Yuegui}}</ref>

==Profile==
Yuegui is a machine rabbit that Cloud Retainer created to assist Yaoyao in her training. In addition to battling alongside Yaoyao, it also alerts [[Madame Ping]] to her location upon calling out its name.<ref name="cs"/> Yaoyao regards Yuegui as her friend and sometimes plays with it.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Yaoyao|Yaoyao's Troubles}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Yuegui appears as a yellow rabbit with white-tipped ears, solid brown eyes, a white underbelly, and fluffy white tail. It has a vertical orange mark in the middle of its forehead and a reddish-orange flower on each flank, which is presumably an osmanthus flower, as the shape matches Yaoyao's [[Osmanthus|Constellation]].
