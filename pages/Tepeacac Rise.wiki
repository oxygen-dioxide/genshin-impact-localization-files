{{Dialogue Start}}
:(A seemingly incomplete musical composition is stuck within the notebook. The following is written below...)
:Thanks for your suggestions. After making the adjustments, the musical inflections have indeed become more vivacious.
:We haven't even met again since the last [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]], have we?
:Next time, let's drink some fruit wine and jam out with some new songs. By that time... I suppose I'll be done with this one.
