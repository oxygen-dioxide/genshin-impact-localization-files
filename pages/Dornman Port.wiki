'''Dornman Port''' is a port in [[Mondstadt]], although its exact location is unclear. So far, it has only been mentioned through [[NPC]] dialogue and character stories.

==Overview==
Dornman Port's geographical location has not been contextualized, but [[Henry Morton]] states it is "too far away" from the [[Nameless Island]] to try reaching the place by boat,<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Henry Morton}}</ref> and its distance from the [[City of Mondstadt]] is large enough that the [[Knights of Favonius]]' Reconnaissance Company, led by [[Eula]], has to constantly patrol the trading route between Dornman Port and Mondstadt City during [[Weinlesefest]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Charity Event! A Great Success!}}</ref>

Eula and her company once tracked down a dangerous hidden cargo belonging to the [[Abyss Order]] to Dornman Port, where it was about to be shipped to [[Liyue Harbor]]. [[Yanfei]] was, at that time, working as a consultant for the merchant vessel; unaware of the cargo's true nature, she started investigating it after discovering something in it, putting herself in great danger.<ref name="EulaAboutYanfei1">{{Ref/VO|Eula|About Yanfei: Encounter}}</ref> She was saved from this perilous situation by Eula, and the two then cooperated to investigate and capture all the Abyss Order operatives hiding in the vicinity of the port.<ref name="EulaStory3">{{Ref/CS|Eula|3}}</ref>

[[Jones]], originally a menial worker at Dornman Port, was recruited by the [[Kanjou Commission]] to be a sailor, only to arrive in [[Ritou]] and discover that he couldn't leave due to the [[Sakoku Decree]]. Following the events of ''[[Transient Dreams]]'' and the repeal of the Sakoku Decree, Jones returns to Mondstadt via the port in Mondstadt City, but has not yet returned to Dornman Port.

Recently, a trading route has opened up between Dornman Port and [[Port Ormos]], [[Sumeru]]. A trading company from Dornman Port plans on exporting fruit, although a reply on to their message on the [[Port Ormos Bulletin Board]] voices the replier's doubts about the fruit's quality after such a long journey.<ref>{{Ref/BB|Port Ormos Bulletin Board|Trading Company Advertisement}}</ref>
