'''Dornman Port''' is a port in [[Mondstadt]], although its exact location is unclear. So far, it has only been mentioned through [[NPC]] dialogue and character stories.

It was first mentioned by [[Henry Morton]], who states it is "too far away" from the [[Nameless Island]] to try reaching the place by boat.

[[Eula]] and her company once tracked down a dangerous hidden cargo belonging to the [[Abyss Order]] to Dornman Port, where it was about to be shipped to [[Liyue Harbor]]. [[Yanfei]] was, at that time, working as a consultant for the merchant vessel; unaware of the cargo's true nature, she started investigating it after discovering something in it, putting herself in great danger.<ref name="EulaAboutYanfei1">{{Ref/VO|Eula|About Yanfei: Encounter}}</ref> She was saved from this perilous situation by Eula, and the two then cooperated to investigate and capture all the Abyss Order operatives hiding in the vicinity of the port.<ref name="EulaStory3">{{Ref/CS|Eula|3}}</ref>

[[Jones]], a former menial worker at Dornman Port, was recruited by the [[Kanjou Commission]] to be a sailor, only to arrive in [[Ritou]] and discover that he couldn't leave due to the [[Sakoku Decree]].
