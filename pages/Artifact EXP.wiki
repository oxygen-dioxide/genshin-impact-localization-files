Upon artifact enhancement, every point of EXP costs 1 [[Mora]] except when recycling an enhanced artifact (see below).

Upgrading a set of 5{{star}} [[artifact]]<nowiki/>s will cost <math>270475\times5=1352375</math> EXP & [[Mora]].

==Enhancement Materials==
There are 2 types of enhancement materials:

===EXP Material===
{{Main|Artifact Enhancement Material}}
{{Card|Sanctifying Unction|2,500EXP|show_caption=1|stars=1}}
{{Card|Sanctifying Essence|10,000EXP|show_caption=1|stars=1}}

===Artifact===
Upon artifact consumption, the EXP provided is calculated as:

<math>\text{EXP}_{\text{base}}+(\text{EXP}_{\text{enhanced}}\times\frac{4}{5})</math>
{| class="wikitable align-center"
!Quality!!Base EXP
|-
|{{Icon/Stars|1}}||420
|-
|{{Icon/Stars|2}}||840
|-
|{{Icon/Stars|3}}||1,260
|-
|{{Icon/Stars|4}}||2,520
|-
|{{Icon/Stars|5}}||3,780
|}
For example, consuming a {{Icon/Stars|4}} artifact at level 16 provides <math>2520+(122675\times\frac{4}{5})=100660</math> EXP.

==Enhancement Cost==
Upon [[artifact]] enhancement, an amount of [[Mora]] equal to the EXP value gained is spent, except if the enhancement material is an enhanced [[artifact]], then the cost is equal to the base EXP which is equivalent to consuming a non-enhanced [[artifact]]. 

==EXP Bonus==
Upon [[artifact]] enhancement, there is a probability that the EXP provided will be multiplied by a certain factor: 

{| class="wikitable align-center"
!EXP Multiplier!!Probability
|-
| 1 || 90%
|-
| 2 || 9%
|-
| 5 || 1%
|}
Therefore, if there is no wasted overflow (before the 20% tax), an average of 113% of the regular EXP value is provided.

==Farming Artifacts for Artifact EXP==
===Artifacts from Domains===
At the highest domain level, a single domain run has a mean artifact EXP equivalent to '''{{nowrap|14,767 EXP}}'''.<ref name="GDGT">Genshin Data Gathering Team: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RcuniapqS6nOP05OCH0ui10Vo3bWu0AvFbhgcHzTybY Drop Rates]</ref> With mean artifact exp of '''738''' per resin, '''19 runs''' are required to have enough [[artifact]] EXP to fully upgrade a single 5★ [[artifact]], without accounting bonus multipliers or artifact exclusions.

At the highest world level, a single trounce domain run has a mean [[artifact]] EXP equivalent to '''{{nowrap|17,098 EXP}}'''.<ref name="GDGT" /> With 6 trounce domains per week, they contribute a mean artifact EXP of '''380''' per resin.

===Artifacts from Investigation===
By using daily resetting [[investigation]] in places that drop [[artifact]]<nowiki/>s, it is possible to gather each day without resin around 20× 2★ Artifacts and 100× 1★ [[artifact]]<nowiki/>s for around '''{{nowrap|60,000 EXP}}''', which is worth 4 Domains worth of Artifact EXP or 80 [[Original Resin]].<!-- Average for different days of farming by only investigating artifacts drop spots in Liyue/Dragonspine and Inazuma. Due to the daily investigation cap, the number shouldn't evolve considerably in the future. -->

===Artifacts from Shops===
{{Main|Shops#Artifacts}}
As of [[Version/5.0|Version 5.0]], a total of 35× 2★ [[artifact]]<nowiki/>s are available for purchase from NPCs every week. As they cost 2,000 Mora each (70,000 Mora total for 35 [[artifact]]<nowiki/>s per week) and amount to a total of '''{{nowrap|29,400 EXP}}''', buying [[artifact]]<nowiki/>s from shops provides 70% more EXP per [[Original Resin]] (assuming the equivalent of 23.33 Resin spent to get 70,000 Mora from [[Ley Line Outcrops|Blossoms of Wealth]]) than domain runs.
