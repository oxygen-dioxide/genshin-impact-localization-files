{{Description|An odd [[Ruin Grader]] that can be found lumbering amidst the thick fog that hangs over Tsurumi Island. It is significantly stronger than your average Ruin Grader.<br />
For reasons unknown, it has appeared on this deserted island, along with the equally enigmatic ancient techniques that power it. [[Hosseini]] has a strong academic interest in this Ruin Grader and would like you to defeat it, all the better for his research to continue.}}

{{Enemy Attacks
|enemy = AM Ruin Grader

|name_1 = 4-Slam Combo
|desc_1 = Performs the following attacks subsequently: a sweep with its arm and a stomp. While stomping, weak points are exposed on its lower legs.

The Ruin Grader targets [[Pursina's Spike]]s when using this attack.

|file_2 = AM Ruin Grader Self Repair

|name_3 = Enhanced State

|name_4 = Chaotic Slam

|name_6 = Charge Stomp

|name_7 = Chaotic Rush
|desc_7 = The Ruin Grader performs a three hit combo followed by a jumping slam before firing its laser directly in front of it.

|name_8 = Bulldoze

}}

==Strategy==
{{Main|Ruin Grader#Strategy}}
To defeat the Anomalous Ruin Grader, charge all the spikes to 100%. When all three spikes are fully charged, it will immediately trigger the death of the Ruin Grader. If any of the three spikes loses health, or if time runs out, the challenge fails.
