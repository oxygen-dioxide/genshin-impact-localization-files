==Profile==
Tlapo is an ancient [[Iktomisaurus]] that has lived for several centuries and has served many chiefs of the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]]. The people of the tribe consider him an elder and call him Elder Tlapo as a shortening of his actual name, Tlapopoctiztetl. He has been an elder for the past 200 years.

When the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] entered the Masters of the Night-Wind lands, Tlapo greeted them with a [[Iktomisaurus Chick|young Iktomisaurus]]. The two then went to the village, where he greeted them in person, though they did not understand him. High Priest [[Caholom]] believed they were disrespecting Tlapo, but Tlapo told him otherwise. Caholom then told the two that Tlapo had appointed an important task to them and brought them to the base of the tribe, where they met [[Biram]].

Biram explained to the Traveler and Paimon that his tribe recorded events in Natlan as their solemn duty. Whenever a major event affected all of Natlan, the tribe would record it in a special kind of scroll that could be weaved by someone that Tlapo had appointed. Tlapo had traditionally appointed those in the tribe for the task, but for this particular event, he had chosen the Traveler &mdash; the first outsider to be granted the privilege to do so. He had sensed the change prior to their arrival, but hadn't picked someone until they had arrived in the tribal lands. Paimon told Biram that they had no experience in weaving scrolls, but Biram told her that everyone that Tlapo had chosen weren't experienced either &mdash; but despite this, they submitted their scrolls on time, claiming to be aided by a "gift from the spirits."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Calling from the Masters of the Night-Wind}}</ref>

When a group of Fatui led by [[Montluson]] sought the ancient ruins, Citlali, skeptical of their motives, informed Tlapo to trail him. Indeed, her suspicions became true, and as he tried to flee, Tlapo and the other Iktomisaurs accompanying him used a trick that he used to scare people by hallucinating their worst fears &mdash; in Montluson's case, bankruptcy, holding him in place until the guards arrived to apprehend him.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Seven-Hued Ruins}}</ref>

During their own investigation into the matter, the Traveler eventually learns that the "gift from the spirits" was actually Citlali's doing, and the people Tlapo had appointed were his attempt to help Citlali gain more friends, as she was trying to distance herself from the grief caused after Huitzilin passed away.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Color of Memory}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Tlapo is an Iktomisaurus. He is much larger than a normal Iktomisaurus and has brighter markings.
