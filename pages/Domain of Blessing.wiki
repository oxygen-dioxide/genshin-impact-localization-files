'''Domains of Blessing''' are [[Domains]] that award [[Artifacts]], which increase the strength of [[character]]s in many ways. They require {{Item|Original Resin|30|x=20}} to claim.

Players must reach [[Adventure Rank]] 22 or complete [[Song of the Dragon and Freedom]] to unlock the entrances to Domains of Blessing, although the Domains within may have higher Adventure Rank entry requirements.
