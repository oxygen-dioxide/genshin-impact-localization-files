'''Geo Elemental Reaction?''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Challenger: Series IV]]''. To complete this achievement, the player needs to defeat the [[Primo Geovishap]] in all of its elemental forms.

==Notes==
* When approaching it, the Geovishap is randomly imbued with one of the four elements, {{Pyro}}, {{Hydro}}, {{Cryo}}, or {{Electro}}, which is marked on its scales and various lines on its body.
* The element will change at server [[reset]], or when it respawns after being defeated, so you can kill the boss without collecting rewards and repeat until it has the desired infusion.
