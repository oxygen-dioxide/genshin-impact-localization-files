|description = A peculiar bird that can walk on two feet yet cannot spread its wings to fly. Lively and friendly, they are only found in specific areas, such as underground caves.
The Flowcurrent Bird subspecies known as Flowfire Birds love high temperatures and have feathers that can withstand the high temperatures of burning liquid phlogiston. To them, a pool of magma that would be dangerous to other creatures is like a hot bath at just the right temperature. Perhaps the reason that other areas of [[Natlan]] seem a bit too cold to this creature is because it is used to the heat of liquid phlogiston. Should it accidentally find itself outside of its preferred caves, Flowfire Birds might even search far and wide for the campfires of adventurers to stay warm...

}}
'''Flowfire Bird''' is a [[Wildlife]] found in [[Phlogiston]]-rich areas in [[Natlan]]. Like [[Flowcurrent Bird]]s, they cannot be killed and will only bounce away if hit.

Hitting one for the first time will add this creature's entry into the player's in-game [[archive]].

==Trivia==
