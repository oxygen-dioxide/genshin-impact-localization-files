'''Clue:'''<br />
Happy Weinlesefest! I've placed the gift near the stage at the Wine Market. I hope that this gift will make the day of the person who finds it.<br /><br />
'''Attached Note:'''<br />
Are you enjoying yourself at Weinlesefest?<br />Every time a festival comes along, the roads and streets are lined with all sorts of decorations, and the conversations people have with one another grow light-hearted. They talk about how they'll be spending the holiday, what they'll buy... Their happiness is truly infectious.<br />This harvest festival, I'd like to send you some small flags that I made myself. If they can be used as decorations to liven up your day, that would be great!<br />Barbara

I have left my honest well-wishes beside the spring fairy.<br /><br />

'''Attached Note:'''<br />
Huh. Never thought the day might come when someone as dispassionate as me would be asked to prepare a Fecund Hamper.<br />Still, I've yet to shake the rust off my brain, so I simply have no clue where to hide it... or what to write in this note.<br />Uh, Happy Weinlesefest, I guess?<br />Jotun

'''Clue:'''<br />
I placed my gift behind a shop in Mondstadt City. The cats here are quite cute, and the cocktail made by that angry bartender is pretty good &mdash; not a match for our Snezhnayan Fire-Water, but still!<br /><br />
'''Attached Note:'''<br />
Honestly, I can't help but miss my mighty homeland Snezhnaya every time such festive events roll along. But I'm afraid I can only take time off at night to drown my sorrows in wine... To be honest, I'd recommend trying the drinks they sell here... But if you were able to find the gift, I reckon you're already a regular here, eh?

Congratulations! It probably wasn't that easy to find this place, so you must be someone with some real spirit! Well then, have a look around. Isn't the view here great? Heh, I'm glad that I was able to share that view with you.<br />Well, just remember to follow the Gliding Instruction Manual as you make your way down using your wind glider.

Come, you who enjoy adventure! A gift prepared specifically by yours truly is waiting for you near a certain shop that sells souvenirs!<br /><br />
'''Attached Note:'''<br />
Hahaha! So you know my daughter well, do you? Well then, make sure you patronize her shop more often!

It's truly a wonderful thing, and she will always be my pride and joy... But don't let her hear that. It, uh, might be awkward, haha!<br />If you wish to join the Adventurers' Guild, just contact me, Branch Master Cyrus!

How do you do, friend? I have placed my gift near a venerable hotel in Mondstadt City (that is now being occupied by a group of guests from afar).<br /><br />

The ducks and I are good friends. They look very cute when they're swimming.

Thanks for finding the gift that I left here!<br />Solving puzzles, avoiding traps, completing challenges, collecting precious rewards... These are my favorite things! It's quite rare that I get this kind of chance, so I hid my treasure somewhere out in the wild before designing a little quest around it.

Well now, I imagine that this one wasn't too difficult. Don't worry, I'm not pulling a fast one on you. I just want to spend more time on drinking festival-exclusive wine, and you don't have to run all over the place looking for the present, so it's a win-win for both of us.<br />Of course, if you would like to savor some drinks or have a chat, I'd buy you a glass any time.

Just follow your nose! The gift is beside that one spot in Springvale from which the aroma of meat ever drifts!<br /><br />
'''Attached Note:'''<br />
Come on, it's a festival! Just having fruits and wine isn't going to cut it. And that's why, apart from the usual little tokens, I've also left you some steak I made myself. I don't mean to brag, but I used the freshest meats and the greatest care in making these &mdash; it would be no exaggeration to call them the best delicacies in Mondstadt. I even matched them with the best wine at this festival.<br />You'll know it once you try some. Happy Weinlesefest!
