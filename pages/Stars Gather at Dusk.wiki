{{Description|This is the newest invention in the "Lunastar Artifices" series, of which previous creations include the Supreme Cuisine Machine, the Snowdrift Mechanism, the Supreme Housekeeping Machine, the Floating Toting Device, and the Bloom Pruner. This series was intended for young humans Cloud Retainer held in great esteem, and so was not designed with a [[Ganyu|certain half-adeptus]] in mind. However, when offered Starwicker, a [[Shenhe|certain female disciple]] of hers had these emotionless words to say: "No thank you."<br>Cloud Retainer thus had no choice but to keep it herself.}}

==Gameplay Notes==
