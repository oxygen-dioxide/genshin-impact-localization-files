'''Ley Line Outcrops''' are open-world challenges that grant [[Adventure Rank]] (AR) EXP and either [[Character EXP Materials]] ('''Blossom of Revelation''') or [[Mora]] ('''Blossom of Wealth''').

Outcrops for Blossoms of Revelation are unlocked upon reaching AR 8, while Blossoms of Wealth are unlocked at AR 12.

==Description==
{{Quote|A flower blossom known as "Revelation" which grows from the Ley Lines in response to someone's desire for battle. Perhaps the treasures within it can help one recall the perils that they have experienced once before...|Adventurer Handbook description for Blossom of Revelation
}}

{{Quote|A flower blossom known as "Wealth" which grows from the Ley Lines in response to someone's desires. Perhaps the treasures within it can satisfy a person's monetary desires, for now...|Adventurer Handbook description for Blossom of Wealth
}}

==Overview==
There will always be two outcrops per [[Teyvat|region]], one Blossoms of Revelation and one Blossom of Wealth. Touching an outcrop spawns [[Enemies]]; the type of enemies faced depends on the region the outcrop is in, while their levels scale to the player's [[World Level]] (WL). Enemies spawned by outcrops will drop items, [[Mora]] and [[Character EXP]] like regular enemy encounters.

After defeating all enemies, a [[Ley Line Blossom]] will be revealed; revitalizing the blossom to gain rewards consumes either 20 [[Original Resin]] or 1 [[Condensed Resin]]. Once an outcrop is completed and its blossom revitalized, another will spawn in a different region within the same nation. Completed but unopened outcrops will remain where they are, and no new outcrop is spawned, until [[World Reset Timers#Daily Reset|daily reset]].

For the [[Battle Pass]] weekly mission "Complete Ley Line deposit challenges 20 times," only the challenges need to be completed; revitalizing the blossom (receiving rewards) is not required. For the ''[[The Hero's Journey]]'' achievement "[[Bounty of the Earth]]," collecting the rewards is required.

==Rewards and Scaling==
The amount of [[Companionship EXP]], [[Character EXP Materials]] or [[Mora]] you receive from completing an outcrop depends on the player's current [[World Level]] (WL).
