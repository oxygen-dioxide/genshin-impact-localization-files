'''Kukulkan''', also known as '''Waxaklahun Ubah Kan''' or as the '''Sage of the Stolen Flame''', is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] who first appears in the {{Quest|Moment of Awakening}}. He is a historical character in [[Natlan]] who stole [[Phlogiston]] from the [[dragon]]s and taught humans how to use it.<ref name="Seeker">{{Ref/Quest|Seeker No Finding}}</ref>

==Profile==
===Appearance===
Body-wise, Kukulkan has brown and beige scales. His upper torso is humanoid, but his lower body is serpentine and has no legs, ending on a tail with a green feathered tip. He has four fingers in each hand, with talons in their ends. He has a pair of long, flat horns and two bundles of two-toned green feathers growing from the sides of his face. 

Kukulkan wears white and grey robes, with triangular patterns on his sleeves and a scaled pattern on the part that covers his lower torso. He has two stone structures imbued with Phlogiston floating behind his back, similar to those some Sacred Source constructs have.

Kukulkan is able to disguise himself as a human, as shown with [[Bona]]; it is highly implied that both [[Manqu]] and [[Titu]] were also some disguises he used.

==Story==
Kukulkan was given life by his older brother [[Xiuhcoatl]] from an offshoot of the primal flame, on the same day the latter himself had been born.<ref name="Annihilation">{{Ref/Quest|An Omen of Annihilation and the Final Entreaty}}</ref> He fought in the war between the ancient dragons and the [[Heavenly Principles]].<ref name="Moment">{{Ref/Quest|Moment of Awakening}}</ref>

At some point after Xiuhcoatl was incapacitated, Kukulkan was appointed to serve as Regent for the dragon civilization in [[Natlantea]].<ref>Interactable, Tanit Camps: [[Chamber of Deliberation#Interactables|Chamber of Deliberation: Sovereign Rulers' Council Records]]</ref> Foreseeing the fall of his kin due to using violence to enforce their might and believing that they would only find salvation if they shared their knowledge with other races, he stole a seed of [[phlogiston]] and set out to find a land that had "yet to know the touch of filth and decay."<ref name="Reckoning">{{Ref/Arti|Reckoning of the Xenogenic}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Book|Records of Hanan Pacha}}</ref> 

Kukulkan travelled the lands until he came upon humans, the "weakest of species." Impressed by their tenacity, he decided to teach them how to use phlogiston. However, he knew that it would not only civilize them, but also order their destinies. He dwelled on a floating island and gave the seed of phlogiston to [[Chaac]], the first human to visit him. Kukulkan told him that the "savior of two worlds" would come from his heirs, and that he will slay the "overlord of fire" and ascend to the "oldest of thrones."<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Root of the Spirit-Marrow}}</ref>

At some point, Kukulkan, in an attempt to further understand humanity, would have his son [[Och-kan]], a "dragon mixed with a human soul" who was raised among human tribes. He hoped that Och-Kan would one day slay Xiuhcoatl and ascend the throne to become the new Dragon Sovereign, leading both dragon and humankind into a new epoch.<ref name="Moment" />

At some point before [[Xbalanque]] became the [[Pyro Archon]], Kukulkan created [[Sanctum of Rainbow Spirits|a realm of purity]] to teach human warriors the language of Phlogiston and wield its power. However, despite his hope that they would use their knowledge to build civilization, the tribes instead used it to ignite conflict against each other, and the disheartened Sage withdrew from the world and history.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Blazing Sacrificial Heart's Resolve}}</ref> The trials also became unnecessary after the Pyro Archon seized the authority of flame, and the sanctum has long since been abandoned.<ref>{{Ref/Domain|Sanctum of Rainbow Spirits}}</ref>

Kukulkan's scheme to grant phlogiston to the humans was eventually uncovered by the dragons, for which the [[Thirteen Lords]] and Three Princes attempted to impeach him. However, the proceedings were put on halt when Xiuhcoatl made an appearance at the trial.<ref name="Once, the Sacred Seat of Judgment"/>

As Xiuhcoatl lay dying after his fight against [[Xbalanque]], the Pyro Sovereign told him that in his final moments, Kukulkan would understand his desire.<ref name="Annihilation"/>

After Och-Kan was overthrown by the Scarlet-Eyed Youth and his allies, Kukulkan returned to "collect his soul." He took Och-Kan's body &mdash; which had been separated from his mind within the [[Core of Chu'ulel]] &mdash; and poisoned it with Abyssal energy, turning it into the [[Dragon of the City of Flowing Ash|fell dragon]] which would circle the ancient region of Ochkanatlan for centuries. Meanwhile, Kukulkan had created the legend of the Jade of Return, an item which could supposedly repel the Abyss. In reality, however, the Jade of Return was one of the two Golden Entreaties needed to activate Huitzilopochtli which Och-Kan had hidden on the Tonatiuh. Kukulkan had devised the legend to lure countless humans to Tonatiuh, all for his own 'personal experiment'; anyone who entered the city would be devoured by the fell dragon and their souls used to fashion "masks," which Kukulkan used to traverse the world in human disguise. The [[Ochkanatlan Adventure Team]] and [[Bona]] were lured to Tonatiuh in search of the Jade of Return, and all except [[Liriwu]] would would meet their ends due to Kukulkan's machinations.<ref name="Moment"/>

Kukulkan eventually became known to the people of Natlan as a human being, under the names Sage of the Stolen Flame and Waxaklahun Ubah Kan. There are stories of him dating from the tribal era, [[Ochkanatlan (Civilization)|Ochkanatlan]], and even the [[Cataclysm]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Rite of the Bold|quote='''Pacal:''' Still, how long did this Sage live anyway, Manqu? I feel like there are tales of him from the tribal era to that of Ochkanatlan...<br>'''Pacal:''' ...And even around the Shadow Pin.}}</ref>

When [[Och-Kan]] revealed his memories to the [[Traveler]], one memory showed Waxaklahun Ubah Kan on the [[Legendary Tonatiuh]] speaking to the Chosen of Dragons, who is soon revealed to be [[Little One]]. Waxaklahun Ubah Kan remarked on the fall of dragons and the rise of humanity, as well as his disappointment in his son's betrayal. He then told Little One to take the token of oath to the "sacred mountain," and that they would meet again when all was done; when that time came, it would be Little One's duty to decide matters.<ref name="Moment" />

After Little One acquired both Golden Entreaties with the help of the Traveler, they headed to the [[Great Volcano of Tollan]] to conduct the rite to wash the Flamelord's Blessing away. As they descended down to the volcano's depths, they encountered a [[Primeval Source Dragon Mech]], which trapped the Traveler and Paimon. Waxaklahun Ubah Kan then brought Little One to his domain and reintroduced himself as Kukulkan. Kukulkan tasked Little One with activating the Huitzilopochtli array, which would reverse creation and convert all of Natlan to [[Phlogiston]], thus destroying the Abyss if it ever returned to Teyvat. While Kukulkan acknowledged that it was the Traveler's actions which had brought Little One to this point, they were not meant to have existed in Natlan, and he was surprised that Little One remembered them.

Ultimately, Little One decided to cancel Huitzilopochtli. When Kukulkan asked why he had done so. Little One told him that he cherished the time with the Traveler and Paimon and did not want to put them at risk. Kukulkan countered that they might not cherish him as much as he thought and would lose everything. Stating that there was no way out, he was shocked when Little One carved one, ignoring his demands to return. After the trio defeated the Source Dragon Mech, Kukulkan remained in his domain, remarking that he finally understood his older brother's feelings and admitted that he still believed in humanity and that Little One made the same decision as both his old self and Och-Kan had done. Due to Little One rejecting the power granted to him, Kukulkan fades away, but is content with the outcome.<ref name="Annihilation" />

==Trivia==
* Natlan graffiti was allegedly inspired by the Sage painting vibrant murals on the cliffs of [[Tequemecan Valley]] using Phlogiston.<ref>{{Ref/VP|Among the Painted Peaks}}</ref>
* Some Natlanese like [[Chikya]] believe that Waxaklahun Ubah Kan was actually a human.<ref name="Seeker" />
* The story of Waxaklahun Ubah Kan stealing phlogiston from the Dragon and giving it to mankind as a symbol of advancement in civilization are most likely inspired by the real-world myth called the {{w|Theft of fire|Theft of Fire}}, in which fire were stolen and given to mankind as a symbol of civilization, knowledge, and technology.
