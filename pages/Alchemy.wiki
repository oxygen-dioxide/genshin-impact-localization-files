'''Alchemy''' allows the crafting of higher rarity [[Character and Weapon Enhancement Material]]s, [[Weapon Ascension Materials]], [[Character Talent Materials]], [[Potions]], and [[Character Ascension Materials]], as well as being used to make some [[Gadgets]]. It allows players to convert ascension materials using the [[Dust of Azoth]] and [[Dream Solvent]].

The [[Parametric Transformer]] also can be used for material transformation when activated by elemental magic, but in a not wholly controllable way.

The [[Art of Khemia]] was an advanced form of Alchemy that sustained the underground Kingdom of [[Khaenri'ah]].

==Performing Alchemy==
Players must be at a [[Crafting Bench]] to perform Alchemy.

To craft higher rarity materials, three of a lower tier material are combined and catalysed with [[Mora]] in a reaction that gives just one of a higher tier material. The player needs to increase their [[Adventure Rank]] in order to unlock the ability to create certain materials.

Alchemy can also be used create [[potions]] that will provide a [[element]]al resistance or attack boosts, as well as other items like [[Condensed Resin]]. The [[Dust of Azoth]] allows conversion of a gem or fragment of one elemental material to another elemental material of the same rarity. [[Dream Solvent]] allows conversion of [[Weekly Boss]] drops from the same boss into each other.
