|text      = Mmm, birthdays are meant to be enjoyed, you know? How could you possibly have a birthday without also having a little bit of fun? So, under the auspices of the Yae Publishing House, I've organized a short light novel writing competition. Whoever can write the most engrossing and exciting short light novel on the spot and within the time limit will receive a publishing contract for their work, right then and there!

Naturally, this task is even more taxing for the judges themselves, and so their table will need to be piled high with the best Fried Tofu and cool drinks, and of course an unlimited stream of snacks.

Why not join me up there as a judge, little one? Sit and chat with me while we enjoy the sight of all those aspiring authors tying themselves into knots trying to tie up their plots... Don't you think that sounds divine?
