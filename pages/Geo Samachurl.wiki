==Descriptions==
{{Description|A wizened, mumbling hilichurl, one that listens to the strength of Geo.<br />Hilichurls especially gifted in commanding the elements who often reach the zenith of their skill in their twilight years. To the persevering mountains, these old hilichurls are but children, but their memories and experiences have guided them towards gaining power over rock and stone.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
*A trio of Geo Samachurls can be found in a special Hilichurl camp in Sumeru consisting of {{Electro}} and {{Geo}}-affiliated Hilichurls, cheering on a [[Stonehide Lawachurl]] against a [[Thunderhelm Lawachurl]]. If enemies are engaged, the Samachurls will despawn.
