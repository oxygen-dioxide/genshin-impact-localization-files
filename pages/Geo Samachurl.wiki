{{Description|A wizened, mumbling hilichurl, one that listens to the strength of Geo.<br />Hilichurls especially gifted in commanding the elements who often reach the zenith of their skill in their twilight years. To the persevering mountains, these old hilichurls are but children, but their memories and experiences have guided them towards gaining power over rock and stone.|[[Archive]]}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Rock Spikes:''' Summons rock spikes that erupt from the ground at the player's location, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}.
*'''Rock Pillars:''' Summons pillars below itself and any nearby Samachurls, [[Hilichurl Shooters]], and [[Abyss Mages]], giving them a higher ground to attack. As [[Geo Constructs]], the Rock Pillars take [[Poise Damage]], and can withstand 900 Poise Damage from [[Blunt Attack]]s or 6000 Poise Damage from non-Blunt Attacks.
*'''Shockwaves:''' Periodically releases shockwaves around the summoned pillars, dealing '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}.
*'''Smack:''' If the player is within melee range, swings its staff at the player, dealing '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} and knocking the player back. The Samachurl also falls in the process due to the staff's weight. The Samachurl will not perform this attack while it is on top of a pillar.
