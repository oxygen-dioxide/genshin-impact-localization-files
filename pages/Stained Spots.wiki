;(Pass time)
;(Idle quote)
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq002 graciette 04.ogg}} '''Graciette:''' Did you read the paper today?

;(Talk to Graciette or Trudaine, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq002 graciette 01.ogg}} '''Graciette:''' Did you read the paper today?
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq002 trudaine 01.ogg}} '''Trudaine:''' Oh I did! My goodness, I couldn't believe what I was reading!
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq002 graciette 02.ogg}} '''Graciette:''' Do you think there's any truth to it? Have you asked your husband? He's a judge isn't he?
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq002 trudaine 02.ogg}} '''Trudaine:''' Pfft, he would never indulge in such idle gossip! Still, he advised me to hold off on buying any more related wares for the time being.
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq002 graciette 03.ogg}} '''Graciette:''' Yes, how prudent &mdash; wait for the dust to settle. My husband said the same.
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq002 trudaine 03.ogg}} '''Trudaine:''' Indeed, indeed! I wouldn't want to invite scandal through one of my purchases, now would I?

;(Enter Chioriya Boutique)
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Chiori! We're here!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Oh, you're here early. I haven't even opened the shop yet.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, has Kirara left already?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Yep. With the Special Patrol, bright and early.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did everything go alright on the road?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I believe so. The Patrol makes for quite the entourage.

:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' The way they marched forward with Kirara in the center, you'd think she was some sort of VIP. For the second leg, the [[Spina di Rosula|Spina]] also came with a pretty large group, led by Navia herself.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' They took care to clear the path beforehand as well. Kirara won't so much as step on a single stray rock on her journey.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I even heard that Navia decided out of the blue to make a batch of macarons as a going-away gift for Kirara. An excellent souvenir to remember Fontaine by, I'd say.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds like Navia really got into it!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 chiori 07.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' My thoughts exactly. She even lamented the fact that she didn't have time to prepare something even fancier. I'm pretty sure she can't wait for another escort opportunity to come her way.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Y'know, now that you mention Navia, Paimon thinks the two of you are actually pretty similar... You say what you mean, and when you have an idea, you really hit the ground running...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 chiori 08.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I suppose that's why we're such good friends.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 chiori 09.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Navia has a certain resilience about her &mdash; it's part of who she is. No matter what comes her way, she never bows down in the face of adversity. That sort of determination and courage is something I really admire.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 chiori 10.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' That same spirit is the true vision of my brand. When she first mentioned commissioning an outfit from my boutique... Well, I'm sure you can imagine my excitement.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's like finding the perfect brand ambassador, huh?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 chiori 11.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Indeed. Customers pay attention not just to the clothes, but also to the figures in society who wear said clothes. People like to copy the styles of those they look up to.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, and here Paimon thought all that mattered was for the clothes to look cute...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 chiori 12.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Fashion is about more than just looks, my dear &mdash; especially if you've got your sights set on a market the size of Teyvat.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 chiori 13.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...Hmm? Well, would you look at the time...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh yeah! Come on, let's get down to business. We're here to model!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 chiori 14.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Indeed. Give me a moment while I go retrieve some fabrics and sample outfits. Why don't you help me set up the shop displays in the meantime?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Set them up... Uh, how exactly?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 chiori 15.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Just carefully organize the ready-to-wear clothes with an eye toward their types and styles. This way, we can guarantee that the customers will see something different every day.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa... There sure is a lot that goes into running a store!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 1 chiori 16.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Well then, I'll leave the displays to you.

:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So uh... We just need to put all the clothes with similar styles together, right?

;(Talk to Chiori, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq002 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Please organize the clothes with an eye towards their types and styles. I'm counting on you.

;(Talk to Chiori)
;(If the clothes were placed in the correct configuration)
::{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Hmm, not bad. You might just have an eye for design.
;(If the clothes were not placed in the correct configuration)
::{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...You didn't get bought out by my competitors, did you? This arrangement... It's...
::{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...Never mind. It might look like a chaotic mess, but I suppose it works as a change of pace &mdash; and who knows? This style arrangement might come into vogue someday.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Anyway, let's move on to the real task at hand.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Over here, stand still. I'll take your measurements first...
:{{Color|menu|At that moment, a woman suddenly arrives...}}
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 leeann 01.ogg}} '''Leeann:''' ...Excuse me, Miss Chiori.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Oh, good morning, Leeann. How have you been recently?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 leeann 02.ogg}} '''Leeann:''' Umm... Not too bad.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 07.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Your gown will be ready next week, so there's no need to worry about missing the ball. Or did you come here today because you'd like to make a new request, perhaps?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 leeann 03.ogg}} '''Leeann:''' Oh... No... Nothing like that, Miss Chiori. To be honest... I came here today to cancel my order for that gown.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 08.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...Cancel your order?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 leeann 04.ogg}} '''Leeann:''' Uh, but you can keep the deposit, of course! I know you can't return any materials you've already used.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 09.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Don't worry about the materials. I'm more concerned about you. Did something happen, Leeann? Have your plans changed?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 leeann 05.ogg}} '''Leeann:''' Umm...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 10.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' It's alright, I'm not trying to make things difficult for you. I'll take note of the cancellation.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 leeann 06.ogg}} '''Leeann:''' Thank you... I'm really sorry.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 11.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Don't worry about it. Just let me know if there's anything I can do to help.
:{{Color|menu|Leeann nods, then turns and leaves...}}
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is it just Paimon, or was she acting a bit strange just now... Wonder why she wouldn't tell us why she was cancelling her order...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 12.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' It's not a big deal. These things happen every once in a while.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 13.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' A family emergency, an important payday falling through, a lovers' quarrel, no one to take you to the ball... I've pretty much heard it all.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 14.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Judging from the look on her face, something's keeping her from revealing the truth to us. It's best not to pry.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, guess this means you'll have more time to work on Fashion Week, right?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 15.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' That's true. Come, let's pick up where we left off...
:{{Color|menu|A man also walks into the shop...}}
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 with 01.ogg}} '''Weis:''' ...Is Miss Chiori in?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 16.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I am. How can I help you?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 with 02.ogg}} '''Weis:''' Um... I'd like to return this item.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 17.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Oh? Could I ask why?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 with 03.ogg}} '''Weis:''' It's just, um... not to my liking. You said I could get a refund if I wasn't satisfied, so... that's why I'm here.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 18.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Is there something about it that didn't meet your expectations? Are the sleeves too short, or is the color too dark? I can always make those adjustments for you.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 with 04.ogg}} '''Weis:''' Uh, no need... You don't have to concern yourself with that. I'd just like that refund please.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 19.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' And I'd be happy to process that for you... If you could just tell me the cause of your dissatisfaction...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 guestoutdoor 01.ogg}} '''Guest Outside the Shop:''' Is Chiori here? I'd like to return my outfit!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Another one!?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 20.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Is there some sort of new calamity coming that I haven't heard about? Another flood? Or an apocalypse maybe? What does the prophecy say this time &mdash; you'll be spared if you get rid of all your clothes?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 21.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Surely, the entire population of Fontaine didn't convene and pick this one day to come and return my clothes. What is going on?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 with 05.ogg}} '''Weis:''' ...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 guestoutdoor 02.ogg}} '''Guest Outside the Shop:''' What kind of rags are you trying to sell us, huh? The way I see it, this shop is nothing more than a black market front run by a bunch of dirty criminals!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 eloffe 01.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' Please calm down, sir...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What is he talking about?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 with 06.ogg}} '''Weis:''' Haven't you heard? Chioriya Boutique has been exposed for having close ties with criminals. It's all over the papers!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 22.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' And just who is it that dares to throw that accusation around?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 with 07.ogg}} '''Weis:''' Well, you tell us! The fabrics you've got here &mdash; they're all sourced from underground factories, aren't they?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 23.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...I've been transparent about my materials from the very beginning. I've already proved there's nothing wrong with them.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 24.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' If a little hearsay and baseless slander are enough to convince you, then by all means, go ahead and hand over your garments right now &mdash; spare yourself from that flood of yours. Or have you not been convinced of that one just yet...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 with 08.ogg}} '''Weis:''' You...!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 25.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Eloffe!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 eloffe 02.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' Miss Chiori...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 26.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Go outside and help these customers with their return requests. There's no need to ask them why. We'll refund them at the purchase price.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 eloffe 03.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' A&mdash;Alright...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 27.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' And once you're done, put up the sign that says we're closed for the day.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 eloffe 04.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' ...Got it.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 with 09.ogg}} '''Weis:''' Hmph...
:{{Color|menu|Weis and Eloffe leave together...}}
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Chiori...
:{{DIcon}} These rumors...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 28.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' They couldn't be more fabricated if you tried. No need to worry about them. I'm sure they'll go away on their own in a few days.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 29.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' The real goal here is to divert my attention away from Fashion Week. The best response right now is to tune it out and focus on finalizing my designs.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If you say so... but Paimon still can't help but worry...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 30.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' The best way to respond to public skepticism is to let your work speak for itself. There will be no doubt about the quality of my work once my new designs are released &mdash; the public just has to see it for themselves.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 eloffe 05.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' ...Miss Chiori! Bad news!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 31.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Oh, for the love of... Can a woman not get a moment of peace to do her work? Go on. What's the matter now?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 eloffe 06.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' It's our accessories supplier. They just sent word that they'll no longer be able to supply us during Fashion Week!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 32.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' What? No accessories? Not even the ones we pre-ordered?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 eloffe 07.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' Yes, that's what their messenger said...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 33.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' And what about the models we asked them to book for us?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 eloffe 08.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' I think... They'll probably pull out as well...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Even the suppliers believe those nasty rumors!?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 34.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 35.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Is the messenger still here?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 eloffe 09.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' No, they've already left.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So no accessories means... no brooches, no bow ties, things like that?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 36.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Not just that. It means no gems, ribbons, gold thread &mdash; all the elements that lend life and soul to my designs.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But... if you take those away... Does that mean you won't be able to make your designs at all?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 37.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...Eloffe, you stay and watch the shop. I'll go talk to the supplier myself.
:{{DIcon}} We'll go with you.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe we'll be able to find out what happened.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! And we can vouch for you too! We'll make sure your supplier knows there's nothing wrong with your clothes!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 2 chiori 38.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Thank you. In that case, please come with me.

;(Talk to Eloffe, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq002 eloffe 01.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' I know Miss Chiori has put a lot of work into making Fashion Week a success...
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq002 eloffe 02.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' I hope you can talk things through with the supplier.

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' By the way, we really are just going to "talk," right?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Of course. I wouldn't do anything to one of my business partners, especially when a reasonable conversation should suffice.

;(Approach the marked location)
:'''Chiori:''' ...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 01.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' Who is it?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Wenger. It's Chiori.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 02.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' ...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' We've worked together all these years &mdash; the least you could do is allow me a face-to-face conversation.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 03.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' Haha... Straightforward as always, I see. You know, there are certain conventions people usually follow if they want to seek someone's company &mdash; sending a messenger for example.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' And when has following convention ever gotten me anywhere? Why hire a messenger when I can just explain things in person?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 04.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' Hmm... Have you read the papers today?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I don't like to waste my time on baseless lies and speculation. Maybe that's something you should consider as well...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 05.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' You're right. I only subscribe to [[The Steambird]], and most days, I never even read the others.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' So these rumors... The Steambird was the one that published them?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 06.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' No, not at all. They were in some second-rate fashion tabloids.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 chiori 07.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Well then, there you go! Those sort of headlines become old news faster than you can read them. Surely a bit of tabloid drama isn't worth cutting off my supply?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 07.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' *sigh* You would think that... But this time is different...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 08.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' Someone paid off the tabloids to publish the same article at once. They even went so far as to leave a copy in front of every house. That's how I first learned of the rumors.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Every house? That means... someone must have been planning this for a very long time...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 09.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' It seems your rival has really pulled out all the stops this time, Chiori. The article was even published alongside a photo of you...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 chiori 08.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' What sort of photo?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 10.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' A photo of you... beating up someone on the street yesterday.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yesterday!? Wait. That means...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 chiori 09.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Tsk... Uther again...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 11.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' Here, I've got a copy. See for yourselves.

::'''Chioriya Boutique - Darkness Disguised Behind a Facade of Fashion'''
::...Chioriya Boutique, located within our good Court of Fontaine, claims to be a clothing store with a unique style. But there is another side to this tale for those few who look beneath that facade&mdash;
::Sources in the [[Fortress of Meropide]] say that not a few criminals have boasted of wearing Chioriya Boutique's clothes. "I just felt that the atmosphere in there suited me..." convicted felon Lyle said. These words met with wide approval from many of his fellow inmates. Our sources also stated that a prisoner who was recently convicted of violent conduct and battery also openly supported Chiori's designs a year ago.
::...
::Upon close investigation of Chioriya's many suppliers, we discovered that there is something more to the discovery that criminals favor its wares. The Boutique is in truth comparable to an invisible hand, like a spider's web that connects these evil-doers. Our investigations show that the Wenger family supplies the ornaments that adorn her designs, and a certain member of this household is a frequent guest at the Fortress... But do birds of a feather not flock together? ...
::...
::Not only that, but many customers have also been subject to rough treatment at Chioriya. Mr. Valerian had this to say: "A real brute, that one. Never mind refusing to tailor my clothes! Why, she seized her scissors and began wrecking them, and threw me out the window! A clothing store? More like a thieves's lair if you ask me!"
::Doubtless, many of you may have wondered why the glass at Chioriya Boutique often shatters with a loud crash, leaving behind a terrifying mess... Mr. Valerian's unfortunate encounter unveils the truth.
::Just the day before this report was going to print, another such act of brutal battery occurred on the streets. Just imagine, if you would, the scene playing out as depicted in the photo above &mdash; Chiori, her countenance terrifying as she grabs her competitor Mr. Uther by the scruff, making threatening gestures toward him. This incident was ultimately broken up by Gardes who reached the scene...
::...
::When we asked criminals why they appreciated this brand, the answer we received was that Chioriya employs illegal competitive tactics to come out on top, giving hope to evil-doers among us that wrongdoing can still prevail, provided you conceal it under the guise of fashion and beauty...
::...
::Perhaps those who purchase clothes from this establishment may, following this establishment's philosophy, prefer to "liquidate" those with whom they have disagreements...
::...
::...Is Chioriya Boutique, indeed, a place blindly flattered by fashionistas that keeps an exclusive clientele of crooks?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Behind the scenes, the true Chioriya Boutique takes shape &mdash; not a fashion house, but a house of lies...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Relying on its close ties to the criminal underworld, the Chioriya brand employs illegal competitive tactics to come out on top, giving hope to the evil-doers among us that wrongdoing can still prevail, provided you conceal it under the guise of fashion and beauty.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 chiori 10.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 12.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' I don't know what happened, and I don't want to comment on things that I didn't see with my own eyes. Still, that photo shows you to be the clear aggressor.
:{{DIcon}} But Uther harassed Chiori first...
:{{DIcon}} He even hired some goons to attack her courier...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! He was the one who started it, that little...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 chiori 11.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I appreciate you standing up for me, Paimon, but it can't be helped now...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 13.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' That's right. The court of public opinion has already made up its mind... Still, I've got to give your rival high marks for effort. They even dug up the fact that my father once served time in the Fortress of Meropide...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 chiori 12.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' But that was so long ago...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 14.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' In the world of fashion, your past is like a piece of clothing stained with mud &mdash; once tainted, it can never be washed clean.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 15.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' They claim that most of your clientele are criminals and that those who buy your clothes are just like you &mdash; people who silence all dissent with violence.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 chiori 13.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' The absurdity... I don't even know which part to laugh at the most.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 16.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' Well, it's no laughing matter.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 17.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' Maybe your clientele are criminals, maybe they're not. There's even the possibility that they're just people who happened to commit crimes after buying your clothes...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 18.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' But, with the way this article combines fact with rumor, trying to determine the truth is practically an exercise in futility. It's not something people are just going to forget about in a day or two, especially when they've found several people to back up their claims.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 chiori 14.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...Wenger, are you sure you won't reconsider? If we go through with the show together, we can defeat them fair and square.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 19.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' Hahaha... If I were younger, I might have said yes.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 20.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' But I'm no longer that brave young man with nothing to lose. I've got the family business to consider now.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 21.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' I'd be perfectly happy to work with you again after this, but my daughter is manning the store during Fashion Week, and I don't want her implicated in all this. She doesn't deserve to be swarmed by all that negative publicity.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 chiori 15.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...I understand.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 22.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' Let me offer you a piece of advice, Chiori, for old time's sake &mdash; let this Fashion Week go. There's always next year. You just need to wait for all of this to blow over.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 chiori 16.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' You're free to wait things out, Wenger. I'll make my own choices.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 23.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' Heh... have you ever thought maybe that attitude of yours is what's gotten you into all this trouble?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 chiori 17.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Have you ever thought maybe this attitude of mine is precisely what paved the way for my success?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 wenger 24.ogg}} '''Wenger:''' Fair enough... Then I suppose all there's left to say is... Best of luck. As for the models... *sigh* None of them wanted to be implicated in all this either...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 chiori 18.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Understood. Take care.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, um... What should we do now?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 chiori 19.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Without the accessories, I can no longer use my old designs.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, how could they do this! They're making things up! The Boutique doesn't have anything to do with violent criminals! Can't people tell this is just a bunch of lies!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 chiori 20.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Public opinion has never been about what's true and what's not. It's about echoing the loudest voice in the room.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 chiori 21.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Tch... I should have seen it from the beginning. Uther knows me too well. Everything that happened yesterday... was just a trap.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, guess all we can do is just head back for now...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Charlotte!? What are you doing here?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Looking for you, of course! Did you see those fashion tabloids this morning?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You mean that sorry excuse for an article? Ugh, just thinking about it makes Paimon's blood boil!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' You too, huh?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Whoever wrote that article must have known The Steambird would never print something so defamatory. Unfortunately, not all the papers in Fontaine share our same sense of journalistic integrity...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Miss Chiori doesn't deserve to suffer all this baseless slander! I was just about to find some people to interview so that I can write an article to refute all those claims! If there's one thing I can't stand... it's people who misrepresent and distort the facts!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's great! With your help, we might be able to get some people back on our side!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 charlotte 06.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' It's my pleasure! I've met Miss Chiori several times. I know she's not the kind of person that article makes her out to be.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 charlotte 07.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' She was the one who made the hat and tie for my Kamera, "Monsieur Verite."
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 charlotte 08.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Speaking of Miss Chiori, do you know where she went? Eloffe told me you all were together.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Huh? She was just here... Maybe she went over there. Let's go and check.

;(While passing the first set of bystanders)<!-- camera zooms in on the two -->
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 strangera 01.ogg}} '''Person Idly Chatting by the Roadside:''' If you ask me, I think Chioriya Boutique is done for.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 strangerb 01.ogg}} '''Person Idly Chatting by the Roadside:''' I mean, what did they expect? Engaging with criminals behind their customers' backs...

;(While passing the second set of bystanders)<!-- camera zooms in on the two -->
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 strangerc 01.ogg}} '''Person Idly Chatting by the Roadside:''' They kept up a solid front, though. I've even bought from them before...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 strangerd 01.ogg}} '''Person Idly Chatting by the Roadside:''' Really? How was it?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 strangerc 02.ogg}} '''Person Idly Chatting by the Roadside:''' The owner was plenty fierce, that's for sure. Makes sense if she regularly deals with criminals, I guess. I've got the chills just thinking about it...

;(Approach the marker)
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no... We've lost her.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did you hear what all of those people were saying? Paimon can't believe they bought all that nonsense...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 charlotte 09.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Miss Chiori doesn't often appear in public or give a lot of interviews, so the general public hasn't had a chance to really get to know her.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 charlotte 10.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' It's also true that her way of dealing with things can be a little... extreme sometimes. It's easy to use that to mislead people who don't know anything else about her.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, this is all Uther's fault! Paimon would pick him up and throw him across the room too, if she could!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait a second... You don't think Chiori might have gone looking for him, do you? Y'know, so she can, uh... finish what she started?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 charlotte 11.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' That would only make the situation worse for her. I'm sure Miss Chiori knows that too.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 3 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You've got a point... Let's just return to the boutique and see if she's there, then.

;(Return to Chioriya Boutique)<!-- via black screen transition -->
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eloffe! We're back.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? Who's this?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 eloffe 01.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' Ah, this is Miss Laetitia. She's also here to see Miss Chiori.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! You're the one who came to collect the wedding dress yesterday, right? Wait, please don't say you're returning that dress, too...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 laetitia 01.ogg}} '''Laetitia:''' Oh, no, no, not at all! I'm just here to thank her! In fact, if there's anything I can do to help her out, I'd be more than willing...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Ah, so you've come across that article as well.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 laetitia 02.ogg}} '''Laetitia:''' Yeah... You probably don't know this... But after I got engaged, I didn't think I'd be able to wear a Chioriya dress on my wedding day.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh. Why?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 laetitia 03.ogg}} '''Laetitia:''' My fiance owns a small business. It doesn't bring in a lot of Mora, but we get by. After he proposed, he took me to Chioriya Boutique, and we put down a custom order for a dress.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 laetitia 04.ogg}} '''Laetitia:''' He probably noticed how often I talked about Miss Chiori's clothes and how pretty they were... Being able to wear one of her dresses to my wedding has always been my dream.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' And then?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 laetitia 05.ogg}} '''Laetitia:''' And then... Something happened to the business, and we ran into major Mora problems. We were able to scrounge up enough to pay off our debts, but... it left us without the funds to pay for the dress.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But didn't Chiori say she was able to make the dress from what was left of the original deposit?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 laetitia 06.ogg}} '''Laetitia:''' Yes... When I came to cancel the order, she asked if something happened, and I told her everything...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 laetitia 07.ogg}} '''Laetitia:''' She heard me out, and then told me not to worry. She assured me that the deposit I paid would be enough for the dress, and that she'd be able to finish making it in time as well... She promised that I'd be able to wear a Chioriya dress on my wedding day.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 charlotte 03.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Well, that's a good thing isn't it? I've always known Miss Chiori to be a woman of her word.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 laetitia 08.ogg}} '''Laetitia:''' It is good... It's just... After I went home yesterday, I couldn't help but take out the dress and try it on. My fiance happened to walk into the room... and when he saw me, he froze on the spot.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 charlotte 04.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Ah... What a shame... He's not supposed to see it until the wedding day...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 laetitia 09.ogg}} '''Laetitia:''' Well, see, that wasn't actually the issue...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 laetitia 10.ogg}} '''Laetitia:''' He's seen a lot of wedding dresses in his time doing business, so as soon as he saw it, he knew for sure that it must've cost far more than what we paid.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 charlotte 05.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Huh? So wait, that means...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 laetitia 11.ogg}} '''Laetitia:''' Yeah... Miss Chiori covered all the costs and held nothing back. The fabric, accessories, beading, construction... It was all of the highest quality.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 charlotte 06.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' ...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 charlotte 07.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Miss Laetitia... I'd really like to use your story for a piece I'm writing about the boutique. Would you mind going on the record?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 laetitia 12.ogg}} '''Laetitia:''' Huh? Well, if it would help Miss Chiori out, I wouldn't mind at all...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 charlotte 08.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I think it'd go a long way! Your real experience is more powerful than all of those lies combined!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Eloffe... Has Chiori come back here since we left?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 eloffe 02.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' Huh? I thought you all were together...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, we were... Hmm, if she didn't come back here, then do you know of any other places she could've gone?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 eloffe 03.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' Umm...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 eloffe 04.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' Oh, I remember now! There's this one cliff by the sea! Miss Chiori would always go there whenever she was upset.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 charlotte 09.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' In that case, why don't we split up? I'll continue interviewing Miss Laetitia, and you two can go look for Miss Chiori.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, sounds good! Let's go!

;(Talk to Charlotte or Laetitia, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq002 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' So, in your opinion, what is Miss Chiori like as a person?
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq002 laetitia 01.ogg}} '''Laetitia:''' Let's see... Well, she's certainly not afraid to say what she means, but she always looks out for her customers however she can...

;(Talk to Eloffe, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq002 eloffe 03.ogg}} '''Eloffe:''' Miss Chiori isn't the sort to just give up. She probably just needs a place where she can think in peace.

;(Approach Chiori at the cliffside)
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There you are, Chiori!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Huh? How did you know where I... Ah, Eloffe told you, didn't she?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She did... We were just looking for you at your shop, and Laetitia was there! She wanted to thank you for the dress... So you see? You don't have to be sad! We'll figure out how to get through this together!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Ah, I'm not upset. I just wanted to get some fresh air.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Want to sit here with me? The view's quite stunning.
:{{DIcon}} It's pretty high up...
::{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 04a 1.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Don't worry, I'll catch you if you fall.
:{{DIcon}} It doesn't look like there's a lot of space...
::{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 04b 1.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Ah, sorry about that. I'm the only one here most of the time.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright. Don't mind if we do!

:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Well, how does it feel?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This place is pretty great!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Right? It's quiet and open, and far from the relentless critique from fashion commentators and the media. It's just you and the beautiful scenery.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! It's important to take yourself out of that kind of stressful environment every once in a while.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 07.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 08.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I didn't grow up in a very strict family. My parents would joke that I grew up to be so assertive because they spoiled me as a child.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 09.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I would get together with the other children to climb trees and explore caves... One time, I even climbed over the walls of the [[Kamisato Estate]]. One of the servants had to physically remove me...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa... Paimon would have never imagined that...

:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 10.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' But even as rambunctious as I was, when it came to needlework, I was as quiet and focused as could be.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 11.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' It was as if I'd discovered a whole new world within those vibrant, dazzling fabrics... You know the feeling?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Err, sorta...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 12.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' My parents noticed, and they sent me to study under a famous Inazuman tailor. It wasn't long before I had driven away pretty much every master tailor on the archipelago. You could say I really tried their patience.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You were that misbehaved?
:<gallery widths="350">
Stained Spots Quest Still 4.png
</gallery>
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 13.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I wasn't misbehaved, exactly. I just... often had strange ideas when it came to fashion, ones that weren't in line with traditional ways of doing things.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 14.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' On top of that, I hated the idea of groveling and making outfits for every arrogant big shot expecting me to be at their beck and call.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 15.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Anyway, a few incidents later, I soon found myself without a master. Worse, not one shop was willing to hire me, not even to do grunt work.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No wonder you left Inazuma...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 16.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I was angry and frustrated, so before I left, I swore to all those "masters" that my brand would one day become renowned all over Teyvat.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, that's a great dream to strive towards!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 17.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' After that, I came all the way to the Court of Fontaine &mdash; a city often referred to as the capital of arts and fashion.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 18.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I had a lot of fun starting out. Sure, I was living in a small, cramped room... but I was finally free to make whatever I wanted.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 19.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I had a far more naive view of "fashion" back then. As long as something was pretty, it would become popular, right? A simple concept, surely.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 20.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Of course, as I spent more and more time in the industry, I learned nothing was ever that simple, least of all "fashion."
:{{DIcon}} Well, I know someone who absolutely adored your designs...
:{{DIcon}} And dreamed of wearing one at her wedding...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 21.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Oh, you mean Laetitia?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 22.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Yeah, she did mention that dream... I'll be honest with you. That's the first time I ever heard something like that from one of my customers.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 23.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Who would have thought... Even as I continue to pursue my dream, my work has also become someone else's...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 24.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 25.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Alright, that's enough sight-seeing for one day. Time to come up with a way out of this mess.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh! Looks like you've got your game face back!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 26.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Back? It was never gone to begin with. I did say I wasn't upset, didn't I?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks we should look for evidence that Uther wrote that article, and that he hired those Treasure Hoarders to attack Kirara!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Charlotte's already working on an article to address all those nasty rumors, so we can publish all our findings in The Steambird once we're done!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 27.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I don't like duking it out in the press... But if Charlotte's thrown her hat in the ring, I won't stop her, either.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 28.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I know where Uther's clothing factory is located. It might be a good place to start looking for some evidence.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds good! We'll come with!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' As for Fashion Week... Well, there's always next year, right? So there's no need to be too upset!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 29.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Hmm? When did this become an either-or situation? Find incriminating evidence, or participate in Fashion Week? Hah, I'm doing both.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? But your accessories... Didn't you say your designs were unusable without them?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 30.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Well, it's true that I haven't quite figured out what to do about that, but...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 31.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' To tell you the truth... Even here in Fontaine, every time I see the sea, I can't help but remember Inazuma... and the vow I made in front of those "masters"...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 32.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Thinking about all that, I just... can't bear to take even one step back.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 33.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...The sea...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm? What did you just say, Chiori?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 34.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...The sea. Seashells... Coral...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 5 chiori 35.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...I've got it!

:{{A|vo qzlq002 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Erm... A Lumitoile? Or a pearl maybe... Ooh, coral's pretty too...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! Paimon gets it now... You want to use things like that as the "accessories" for your designs!

:{{A|vo qzlq002 7 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Hmm... everything looks great. I've also collected a pretty big batch, so we should have enough.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! So, are we gonna head back now and make some new designs?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 7 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Yes, but don't forget, we've got more than just the designs to worry about when we get back.
:{{Black Screen|You return to the boutique with Chiori...}}
:{{A|vo qzlq002 8 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Okay, we've got the materials for the accessories. Next... we'll need to use what we have on hand to create some new outfits.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You mean we have to start from scratch? Will there be enough time?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 8 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I should be able to make it... if I skip out on sleep.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nuh-uh, skipping out on sleep is not the answer! Wait... How come this conversation is giving Paimon major deja vu...
:{{DIcon}} Sounds pretty similar to one we've had with [[Ganyu]] before.
::{{A|vo qzlq002 8 chiori 03a 1.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Ganyu? Who's that?
::{{A|vo qzlq002 8 paimon 03a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A friend of ours who does way too much overtime!
:{{DIcon}} I guess going after what you want means making certain sacrifices.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, anyway... Sleep is important! You're not gonna convince Paimon otherwise!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 8 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Haha, well I can't argue with you there. One thing's for sure, though &mdash; I'm going to do whatever it takes to make it work.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 8 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Hah... All this grit and determination... It reminds me of the first Fashion Week I ever participated in...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What else can we help with?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 8 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Hmm... Let me see...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 8 chiori 07.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I suppose all there's left to do is... tear up all the outfits currently on display.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You got it! Uh... Wait, what did you just say!?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 8 chiori 08.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' You heard me. Tear them all up.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 8 chiori 09.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' When I went to that first Fashion Week, I had no savings to speak of, just a few dozen yards of fabric and a dream.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 8 chiori 10.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I had to make something work, so I tore up all the clothes that I brought with me from Inazuma, and I used the scraps to make my entries for the show. I used the larger pieces for the base fabric and the smaller pieces for accessories...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 8 chiori 11.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' If it worked back then, why not now? We can also repurpose some of the ready-to-use accessories in the shop as well.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But... You worked so hard on all these outfits...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 8 chiori 12.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I know. That's why I refuse to let it all go to waste. I'm not going to let them win, even if it takes everything I've ever made and more.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 8 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, okay... Then, here's goes nothing...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 8 chiori 13.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' No need to be nervous. I won't hold it against you.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 8 chiori 14.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Of course, if anyone dared to tear up one of my dresses in front of me on a normal day, I'd probably toss them into the sewer.

:{{A|vo qzlq002 8 chiori 15.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Just this once, though, I think I can make an exception. Go ahead and tear them up. Think of it as a good way to vent your emotions.

;(After dismantling the clothes)
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Good job. That should do it.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Chiori! Are you alright? Sorry for taking so long, I got caught up and... Whoa! Wh&mdash;What happened to your shop?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Who did this!? Those monsters... Slandering you in the papers wasn't enough for them, was it? They even sent people to wreck your shop...!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Give me their names! Since they're all too eager to tear up other people's clothes, I think it's about time the Spina di Rosula returned the favor!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' M&mdash;Maybe you should calm down a bit first, cause you see, um...
:{{DIcon}} I&mdash;I was the one who did it...
:{{DIcon}} Boss... Please, go easy on us...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Huh...? HUH?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' What is this, a soap opera? I was the one who asked {{Traveler}} to tear up the outfits. We need all the fabrics and accessories we can get.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Oh, so that's... what happened... Ahaha... Guess I got a bit ahead of myself just now. Back to what you were doing, everyone. You can all just pretend like I didn't say anything...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Navia sure is scary when she's angry...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' If there's one thing I can't stand, it's a false accusation. No one's gonna orchestrate some conspiracy to take down one of my friends and get away with it.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You and Chiori are really close!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Of course! Everyone knows that Chiori makes the most gorgeous outfits in town. All of the Spina di Rosula's formal wear is custom-tailored here!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Now, if only you'd give me the contract for your uniforms as well...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Pfft, as if you'd enjoy designing something as boring and formulaic as a uniform. That's why I didn't ask you in the first place, silly.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Plus, with how much your intel has helped us out in the past, to the Spina, you're more of an intelligence agency than a fashion boutique.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' If I had it my way, it would be the other way around...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Anyway, we both know why I'm here. Tell me, how can the Spina be of service to you?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' ...If it's not too much trouble, can I borrow some skilled hands to help with some simple sewing work? I'll need all the help I can get if I'm going to finish these outfits over the next few days.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' No problem. I've got a few of those guys all ready to go! I just knew you wouldn't be intimidated into withdrawing from this year's show.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' When are you going to get started? I can help with the sewing, too.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Actually, there's something else I'd like to ask of you.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Ask away. I'm all ears!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 chiori 07.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Oh and, {{Traveler}} and Paimon &mdash; could you help me pass word to Lyney and Lynette? I'll need their help as well.
:{{DIcon}} Gladly.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 charlotte 01.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' I'm done with my interview! Has Miss Chiori made it back yet&mdash; Aahhhh!! What happened to the boutique!?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' Who did this!? Give me names! I'll make sure every last one lands a full feature on the front page of the Steambird tomorrow!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 9 chiori 08.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Not this again...

;(Talk to Chiori, Charlotte, or Navia, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq002 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' What should we do about these clothes everywhere? Need any help?
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq002 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Sort them by the type of fabric first, and then by color. Oh and, don't forget to remove any accessories and put them to the side.
:{{A|vo dialog qzlq002 charlotte 02.ogg}} '''Charlotte:''' That sounds pretty straightforward. I'll help, too!
----
;(Talk to Lyney and Lynette)
:{{A|vo qzlq002 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lyney, Lynette! Great, you're both here!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 10 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' A moment later and you'd have missed us.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 10 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' We read the article in the papers &mdash; we were just about to go find Miss Chiori.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 10 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' She helped design a number of our costumes in the past and even sponsored one of our performances. The time has come, it seems, for us to return the favor.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, perfect! She was the one who sent us!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 10 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' In that case, I assume that there's something we can do to help? Just say the word, and we'll take care of it.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, so it's like this...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 10 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...Is that all we'll need to do?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 10 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Should be a piece of cake for the two of us.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon's glad to hear it!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 10 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well then... Guess it's about time we go and find some evidence for all the bad stuff Uther has been doing, right?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 10 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Chiori said we shouldn't disturb her over the next couple of days. We can check in with her again once she's done with all the new designs.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 10 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But the show's in another two days, isn't it? Will she be able to make the deadline?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 10 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, according to her, she wants to first beat Uther fair and square at the show, and then defeat him in the court of public opinion. She said that it'd be like, uh...
:{{A|vo qzlq002 10 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' A two-pronged approach?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 10 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Courtesy first, confrontation second?
:{{A|vo qzlq002 10 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... Yeah, something like that.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 10 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Understood. Then we'll have faith in her decision. We'll go make some preparations &mdash; see you at the venue in two days.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 10 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright! We're counting on you!
:{{A|vo qzlq002 10 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, then let's also do as Chiori said and meet up with her at Uther's factory in two days. We'll gather the evidence then.
:{{A|vo qzlq002 10 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon sure hopes she won't have a hard time making all of those new outfits for the show...
