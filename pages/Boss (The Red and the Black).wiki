'''Boss''' is a quest-exclusive NPC that appears in the {{Quest|Questioning Melusine and Answering Machine}}.

==Profile==
Boss is the leader of the "Elegant Tableware Confrerie," a multi-level marketing organization. They masquerade as a legitimate business, claiming their tableware is favored by [[Fontaine]]'s upper classes and can be sold for hefty sums. Customers pay a fee to join and receive tableware, but since the tableware is low-quality, the only way they can make a profit is to find other unsuspecting victims to pass their products off to.

At some point, [["Intrepid Valberry"]] joined the organization after being kicked out of the [[Fruity Order]] and became Director 42. Their organization was later exposed by [[The Steambird]], and Directors 2 through 41 were arrested by the [[Marechaussee Phantom]]. However, Boss claimed that the arrested perpetrators were only temporary employees, and since he had kept all their accounts completely separate, the organization remained intact.

During ''[[The Red and the Black]]'', [[Talochard]] arrested more members of the organization, but Boss managed to escape while everyone was distracted. He was presumably arrested after Intrepid Valberry handed him over to the Marechaussee Phantom in ''[[Questions and Answers]]''.

===Appearance===
Boss is a tall man with short, light brown hair, thick eyebrows, and brown eyes. He wears the same outfit as the [[Treasure Hoarders: Wallenstein]].
