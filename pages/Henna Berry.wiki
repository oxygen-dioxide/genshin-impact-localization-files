==Descriptions==
{{Description|A fruit that grows even in the most hostile of desert environments. Its vibrant crimson fruits are made even more lovely against a backdrop of yellow sand.<br />Thanks to its extremely bright color, after a simple treatment, it can be made into a pigment. An important part of the desert people's lives, it is said to have been used as a dye for the fiery banner of the Eremites. The red fabric follows them in all their travels. No matter where you are, whenever you see these fluttering textiles, you can almost feel the hot wind of their homeland on your skin.|[[Archive]]}}
