|text      = A few days ago, I received a report documenting how the cultural exchanges between [[Inazuma]] and [[Fontaine]] have been steadily progressing.

The remarkable success of this collaborative endeavor owes much to your assistance too.

After returning to Inazuma, [[Ayaka]] and I have often spoken of that trip. When we have a spare moment together, it is a joy indeed to recount and reminisce upon such happy memories.

As I write this letter, the first Sakura buds are starting to open up outside my window, and a warm breeze is beginning to blow. Perhaps this is why I feel at ease.

All goes well with you, I trust? If you have the time, feel free to drop by so we can admire the sight of Sakura blossoming under a rosy sky together.

Think of it this way — you'd be giving me an excuse to escape my retainers' stuffy visits and tedious exchanges of gifts, and thereby doing me a great favor.
