==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ottnit:''' Hello! Are you looking for [[Sigewinne]]? I'm afraid she's not here right now.
:{{DIcon}} Are you one of the inmates here too?
::'''Ottnit:''' Mm? No, I'm not! Though a Melusine who committed a crime would be punished the same as a human, it so happens that I am an innocent citizen.
::'''Ottnit:''' In fact, it's practically the opposite! I'm a member of the Marechaussee Phantom. But it's my day off, so I've come here to speak with a friend, that's all.
::{{DIcon}} So you're a friend of the head nurse?
::'''Ottnit:''' Yeah. And her infirmary is quite spacious, it's perfect for us to get together and chat over milkshakes.
::'''Ottnit:''' Sigewinne's vision is much closer to humans than most Melusines. We all like to hear her describe the surroundings, and then draw them.
::'''Ottnit:''' ...But as we're still in the Fortress of Meropide we have to keep things low-key.
::'''Ottnit:''' The terrain here is quite complex, but that's ideal for us smaller types to move about without anyone noticing.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Very impressive.
:::'''Ottnit:''' Hoho, Since your praise is well deserved, I'm very happy to accept it.
:::'''Ottnit:''' Why don't I return the favor? I found this while I was swimming nearby. Pretty isn't it?
::;(Obtain {{Item|Lumitoile|20|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} I'll come back later then.
::'''Ottnit:''' Okay.
