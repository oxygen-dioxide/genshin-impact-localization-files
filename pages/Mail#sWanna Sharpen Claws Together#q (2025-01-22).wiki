|text      = Mew~ I woke up to so many birthday blessings and snacks! Heehee, I don't even need to count my toe beans to know that it's my birthday again! I shared the fish snacks with my purrfect cat friends, and they "meow-meow-mewed" happily while gobbling them up in no time! I'm also planning to gather some pretty little trinkets and deliver them later as thank-you gifts in return.

Wanna go out and have some fun? We could splash in the water while collecting [[Sango Pearl]]s, or climb trees while catching [[fireflies]]... Oh, oh! Speaking of climbing trees, I have to take you to my favorite forest! The texture of every tree there is so unique! Just one touch with my paw pads, and I can't help but start sharpening my claws! It's so relaxing, making me go "purr-purr"...

Humans might not need to sharpen their claws, but sniffing the wood's scent is super interesting too!
