'''Sunsettias''' are a [[food]] item that the player obtains by foraging in the wild.

Sunsettia restores 300 HP to the target character. Like most foods, this can not target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]]; this can only target characters of the player's party.

==How to Obtain==
Sunsettias grow in groups of three on some [[Cuihua Wood|Cuihua Trees]] in [[Mondstadt]], [[Liyue]] and [[Sumeru]], and can be harvested by either climbing or hitting the tree to make them fall within the player's reach. Dropped Sunsettias may also be found at the base of such trees, in critter hideouts and on crates and tables of urbanized areas. They are most commonly found in [[Starfell Valley]], [[Galesong Hill]], [[Bishui Plain]] and [[Qiongji Estuary]].

Sunsettias can also be dropped by destructible crates, barrels and pots or by [[Investigation]] points found all over [[Teyvat]].

See the Video Guides section or the '''[https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=164 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for specific locations.

Additionally, the following NPCs give Sunsettias after following a certain dialogue branch for the first time:
* [[Bolai]] in [[Liyue Harbor]], [[Liyue]] (4 Sunsettias)
