|text      = Not long ago, the Reconnaissance Company faced a particularly grueling battle, but fortunately, everyone returned safely. Phew, otherwise, this letter might fail to reach you as punctually as it does each year...

The monsters we encountered were noticeably stronger than before, and their tactics were much more cunning. I've already sent a detailed report back to the Knights of Favonius, urging all companies to remain vigilant.

As for you, our Honorary Knight still fighting in another land, I'd like to speak with you in person... If you're beginning to grow weary of the constant battles, perhaps you should listen to the sound of the bone whistle, close your eyes, and let the waves wash over you.

Hmph, who knows, when you open your eyes again, you may find yourself renewed with strength. Rest assured, before I take revenge upon you, I will support your quest for vengeance against those implacable enemies.
