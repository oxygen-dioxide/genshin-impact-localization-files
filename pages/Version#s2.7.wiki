|description = The mysteries in the depths of [[The Chasm]] are complicated and bewildering, and people have gathered here for different purposes.<br />The mountains and valleys stay silent while the visitors' thoughts are in turmoil. Nevertheless, the path to finding answers is unclear.<br />Where daylight falls, there are still things left to be done and wishes to be fulfilled.

# After [[Yelan]] uses her Elemental Burst, the [[Raiden Shogun]] will experience problems gaining Resolve for Chakra Desiderata. This issue will be fixed after the update on June 9th.
