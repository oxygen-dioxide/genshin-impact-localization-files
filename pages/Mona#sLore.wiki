{{Quote|A mysterious young astrologer who proclaims herself to be "Astrologist Mona Megistus," and who possesses abilities to match the title. Erudite, but prideful.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}

Mona is an astrologist who takes her passion seriously. She is very knowledgeable in this subject in part and respects, yet also fears [[Barbeloth]], her master, at the same time. She combines her astrology skills with hydromancy, which makes her a well-known, if still growing astrologist. In part due to her astrology, Mona can tell whether or not a person is lying, can sense their intentions from a single glance, being capable of seeing their fate and is able to accurately deduce a person's traits just from knowing what their constellation is.

Being obsessed with astrology gives Mona a sense of pride, but this also serves as a double-edged sword; any [[Mora]] she gets her hands on is immediately spent on astrology-related materials, regardless of its cost. She only realizes too late when she has run out of Mora to meet her daily needs, occasionally going without shelter or food for days on end. She is particularly picky when it comes to eating, as she prefers simple dishes when eating out; when she cooks, she makes the most out of whatever she can buy.<ref>{{Ref/Companion|Mona}}</ref> She does not tolerate those who disrespect her.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Where Ancient Stars Align}}</ref> She also makes a lot of denials when someone is pointing out what she doesn't have.

{{Quote|Astrologist Mona Megistus's essays are truly fascinating. Not that I really get it, but it's super interesting nonetheless.|[[Ziwei]], a long-time reader of [[The Steambird]].}}

Mona is unique among astrologers &mdash; others may speak with great ostentation for money, but Mona has never done so. Nor does she dress up or mince her words, even if her results are unpleasant to hear: "You won't amount to anything even if you join the Adventurers' Guild." "You've got no chance with him. In fact, he will soon leave you" &mdash; such is the nature of her rejoinders.

Her blunt nature has resulted in plummeting numbers of people coming to have their fortunes told. But Mona isn't one to complain, for that just leaves her with more time for her personal research.

But when one speaks of research, one also speaks of the necessity of purchasing texts and research apparatus. Mona's only income comes from her contributions to The Steambird's "All Things Astrological" column. Every paycheck is spent first on her research. Books from [[Liyue]], an astrolabe from [[Sumeru]]... all of these come with a hefty price tag, and by the time Mona regains her senses, there's only enough of her income left for her to scrape by each month.

"It matters not. Astrologers must rid themselves of material desires. Only by ridding oneself of clutter can one see the true world around them." So says Mona, coughing loudly all the while to cover the sound of her growling stomach.

Today, too, is another day Mona worries about Mora.

==Trivia==
* Mona is the first 5-star character to use a Catalyst as a weapon.
* Mona is one of the few currently playable characters who acknowledges (or even seems aware) that the Traveler is from another world. She was able to find this out through her astrology.
* Mona is one of the characters with ornaments that glow. While wearing her default outfit, [[Flowing Fate]], or her alternate outfit, [[Pact of Stars and Moon]], when Mona's Elemental Burst is ready, the red parts of the ornaments on her hat, leg, and pigtails will glow along with her Vision.
* Mona is able to use her astrology to ascertain and avoid danger, and she claims it allows her to "see through lies."
** In {{Quest|Beyond This World's Stars}}, she is able to recognize a group of what appears to be traveling merchants looking for travelers to accompany, but actually are a group of bandits looking for tired travelers to rob.
** In the {{Quest|What the Skies Conceal, the Water Reveals}}, she realizes [[Scaramouche]] is actually one of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]] and seeks to kill the Traveler. While Mona says that "even a junior astrologist would have seen through him instantly," Scaramouche himself seems surprised that she uncovered his true identity.
* In one of Mona's idle animations, the constellation she views will randomly be [[Lepus]] (Amber's), [[Tempus Fugit]] (Lisa's), or [[Leo Minor]] (Jean's). The constellations she looks at are mirrored from her point of view, which is likely because she uses hydromancy as her method of astrology &mdash; looking at the night sky through its reflection in water.
** What Mona specializes in is catroptromancy (also known as captromancy or enoptromancy), a term derived from the Ancient Greek words: {{Lang|mini=1|grc=κάτοπτρον|grc_rm=katoptron|grc_tl=mirror,}} and {{Lang|mini=1|grc=μαντεία|grc_rm=manteia|grc_tl=divination.}} This type of divination consists in predicting someone's future or also discovering their past through the use of a mirror, or any surface that may reflect light, like water. This practice was common in Classical Greece and Ancient Rome.
** In the {{Quest|Afterword (Summertide Scales and Tales)}}, when asked by Paimon to find [[Mini Durin]]'s whereabouts, Mona's scrying mirror shows Klee's [[Trifolium]] constellation.
* There is a running gag where other characters find it hard to pronounce Mona's last name, "Megistus," from [[Goth]] to [[Kazuha]] and [[Xinyan]]. To English-speaking players, this gag may be difficult to understand since Megistus is not hard to pronounce, but in Chinese, it may be hard to pronounce {{zh|梅姬斯图斯|rm=Méijīsītúsī|tl=Megistus}}.
** The English [[Mona/Voice-Overs#Hello|"Hello" voice-over]] also downplays it since Mona only requires the Traveler to learn her name, while the Chinese [[Mona/Voice-Overs/Chinese#Hello|voice-over]] has Mona require the Traveler to "say it all correctly in one go."
* Mona is known by these aliases or titles:
** Centennial Genius
** Lady Megistus (by Fischl and Oz)
* During the [[Summertime Odyssey]] event, after completing the [[The Ancient Azure Stars (Domain)]], the answer to the astral puzzle inside Mona's room is Mona's constellation.
* Mona, along with [[Ningguang]], are the only playable characters known to have revived [[Vision|Masterless Visions]] rather than receiving their own.
* Mona was born in Mondstadt after her parents migrated to [[Dornman Port]], and eventually traveled with Barbeloth before settling in Mondstadt City during her Story Quest. She further clarifies that she is not Fontainian, with Paimon feeling relieved knowing she would not be affected by the [[prophecy of Fontaine]].<ref name="HP">
{{Ref/Quest|Hunters, Prophets}}</ref>
* Mona took up her current surname Megistus when she became Barbeloth's apprentice.<ref name="HP" />
* {{Furnishing Mentions|Mona}}
* Mona shares her Korean voice actress, Woo Jeong-sin, with [[Diona]].

===Etymology===
* Her name has several possible origins:
** English name "Mona," which is derived from Gaelic "muadh" (noble).
** Northern European name, an alternative form of "Monica."
** Old English "mona" (moon), which possibly stemmed from her career as an astrologer.
** From "Mona Lisa" with the first element derived from Italian "madonna," which means "my lady."
* Her constellation, Astrolabos, is Latin for "The Astrolabe."
* Her epithet "Megistus" may very well derive from the Ancient Greek adjective {{Lang|mini=1|grc=μέγιστος}}, which is the superlative of the adjective {{Lang|mini=1|grc=μέγας}}, which means "big, great."
** Mona confirms that her surname generally means "great."<ref name="HP" />
