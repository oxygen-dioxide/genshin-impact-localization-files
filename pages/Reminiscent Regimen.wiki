* After completing the quest [[Any Unsolved Mysteries?]], the event can be found under [[File:Icon Reminiscent Regimen.png|30px]] at [[Twinning Isle/2.8|Twinning Isle]].
* The "Reminiscent Regimen" challenge has three themes: Descent, Raid, and Convoy. Each theme has 2 challenges respectively and 6 levels in total. After the event begins, one challenge level will be unlocked each day. Travelers can participate by forming a custom Co-Op party or select [[Co-Op Mode]] to begin matching.

Travelers can confirm the challenge objectives for each challenge on the Score Details page in Challenge Details.
* The Descent challenge requires Travelers to start from a platform high in the sky and begin a descending assault. Defeat all opponents on various floating platforms and reach the sea surface within the time limit to complete the challenge.

{{Tutorial
|image1  = Tutorial Reminiscent Regimen 1.png
|text1   = The Reminiscent Regimen challenge has three themes: Descent, Raid, and Convoy. Complete these challenges and accumulate scores to obtain the corresponding rewards.<br />You can match-make in single-player mode to engage in the Co-Op challenge.<br />Other players in your team may be invited to take part in the challenge when in Co-Op Mode.
|image2  = Tutorial Reminiscent Regimen 2.png
|text2   = In the Descent-themed challenge, you will start from a platform high in the sky and begin a descending assault. Defeat all opponents on various floating platforms and reach the sea surface within the time limit. The opponents on the next group of floating platforms will only appear once you have defeated all the opponents on the current group of floating platforms.
|image3  = Tutorial Reminiscent Regimen 3.png
|text3   = During the challenge, you can pick up the Aegis of Descent. It is used to change the unique traits of the platform below. One such change is Compulsion, which will cause opponents on the indicated floating platform below to be immediately defeated if hit by Plunging Attacks. Pick the Aegis of Descent up to complete the challenge faster.
|image4  = Tutorial Reminiscent Regimen 4.png
|text4   = The Raid-themed challenge will see Travelers navigate their Waverider within the time limit to reach a certain sea region.
|image5  = Tutorial Reminiscent Regimen 5.png
|text5   = After the Waverider stops at all Mooring Points, a wind current will be generated.
|image6  = Tutorial Reminiscent Regimen 6.png
|text6   = You can use this wind current to board the floating platforms. Defeat all opponents on the floating platforms to complete the challenge.
|image7  = Tutorial Reminiscent Regimen 7.png
|text7   = In the Convoy-themed challenge, you must protect a Driftstone Raft that will automatically move towards a destination.<br />The Raft will come under attack and will be obstructed while en route. If the Raft reaches its destination within the time limit without being destroyed, the challenge is a success.
|image8  = Tutorial Reminiscent Regimen 8.png
|text8   = The Driftstone Raft comprises a propulsion device and 4 stone-raft components. Each of these components can be destroyed as a standalone part. Pick up Repair Parts and stay on top of the Driftstone Raft to repair it.<br />The propulsion device will constantly consume Drift Energy while en route. If it runs out of energy, it will stop moving. Pick up Drift Energy and stay on top of the Driftstone Raft to replenish the device's energy.
|image9  = Tutorial Reminiscent Regimen 9.png
|text9   = The Driftstone Raft's progress will sometimes be barred by some Ominous Obstacles. One type of obstacle will cause the Raft to stop moving. Destroy these Ominous Obstacles to allow the Raft to proceed. The other type will deal damage to the Raft as it passes through. Destroy the support pillars on either side of this obstacle type to destroy them.
|image10 = Tutorial Reminiscent Regimen 10.png
|text10  = If you stray too far from the team or if you are too far from the challenge objective, you can use the Return to Challenge Area option to teleport yourself closer and continue the challenge.
