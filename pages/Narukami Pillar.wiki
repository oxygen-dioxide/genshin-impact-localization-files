The '''Narukami Pillars''', also referred to as '''wards''', are stone lanterns found throughout [[Yashiori Island]] created to suppress the [[Tatarigami]] that spawned after the ancient [[god]] [[Orobashi]] was slain there.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Orobashi's Legacy: Prologue}}</ref> Recently, a radical faction within the [[Watatsumi Army]] attacked and broke the wards, believing it would restore Orobashi's power and turn the war in their favor.<ref>Interactible: [[Serpent's Head#Waterlogged Note|Waterlogged Note]]</ref> Instead, it unleashed the Tatarigami, causing chaos for everyone on the island.

Over the course of the [[World Quest]] series [[Orobashi's Legacy]], the [[Traveler]] helps [[Kaji]] repair the Narukami Pillars at [[Fort Fujitou]], [[Serpent's Head]], [[Jakotsu Mine]], and [[Fort Mumei]] by retrieving each Narukami Pillar's Rock Pillar Pearl and Rock Pillar Warding Stone. This abates the constant thunderstorms plaguing the island.

The pillars can be Observed before starting Orobashi's Legacy, resulting in some dialogue. When interacting with them, the option to interact with it simply says "Observe"; it changes to "Narukami Pillar" after starting the quest.

Before the wards are repaired, they emit black and purple crackles.

==Fort Fujitou==
This ward is restored in [[Orobashi's Legacy: Part I]] using the [[Musoujin Gorge: Rock Pillar Pearl]] and [[Musoujin Gorge: Rock Pillar Warding Stone]]. Both items are locked behind a [[Sacred Stone Puzzle]] that cannot be completed before the quest.

;(Before starting [[Orobashi's Legacy]])
:'''Observe:''' The strangely-shaped stone lantern seems to be emitting an ominous energy.
:'''Paimon:''' This stone lantern is so strange... It's so creepy.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, what's that written on the light post?
:'''Observe:''' "Travelers passing through: if you have any questions about this ward, please go to the [[Musoujin Gorge]] and talk to [[Kaji|Mr. Kaji]] about it."
:'''Observe:''' The handwriting looks very recent, and there are a few lines of smaller handwriting below, which have been eroded by the rain:
:'''Observe:''' "Please tell Mr. Kaji we've tried... But unfortunately... Maybe he can find it somewhere nearby..."
:'''Observe:''' "Please tell Mr. Kaji to come to the refuge as soon as possible. He's dearly missed by his family."
:'''Paimon:''' This Mr. Kaji seems to be pretty concerned about these stone lanterns. Why don't we go to Musoujin Gorge and ask him?

===Garrison Log Fragment===
Next to the ward at [[Fort Fujitou]] is a Garrison Log Fragment, recording the perspective of soldiers stationed at Fort Fujitou before and shortly after the wards were destroyed.

{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Garrison Log Fragment:''' It's sunny and the sea breeze is refreshing...
:'''Garrison Log Fragment:''' ...How unfortunate, then, that we're stationed out in the middle of stinking nowhere! Apparently, the transfer was made at the request of [[Yae Miko|Lady Yae Miko]]. Still, we are the samurai of the [[Tenryou Commission]], after all, not the [[Grand Narukami Shrine|Grand Shrine]]'s guards! Lady Miko may have greater seniority than our [[Kujou Takayuki|Lord Kujou]], but such behavior is still quite unreasonable...
:'''Garrison Log Fragment:''' ...That said, the new equipment is quite good. And this notebook is waterproof...
:'''Garrison Log Fragment:''' ...
:'''Garrison Log Fragment:''' ...It's cloudy today and the rain is imminent...
:'''Garrison Log Fragment:''' ...The onmyouji from [[Narukami Island]] conducted a routine maintenance ceremony. Before they left, they gave us many [[Sakura Mochi]] as a gift. They're of [[Kamisato Clan]] make, I believe. Most delicious...
:'''Garrison Log Fragment:''' ...Sanboushi's at that age where his teeth are growing out, isn't he? I'd really love to make some desserts for him, but I wonder if it's too late for me to learn...
:'''Garrison Log Fragment:''' ...Heita said that he's discovered some abnormal movements on the western beach, and that it might be [[Kairagi]]. The [[Watatsumi Army|Sangonomiya]] are so weak &mdash; how can they just let pirates run amok on the western sea? They may have been getting along well all this time, but they shouldn't be so complacent...
:'''Garrison Log Fragment:''' ...
:'''Garrison Log Fragment:''' ...
:'''Garrison Log Fragment:''' ...Thunderstorm...
:'''Garrison Log Fragment:''' ...It's been raining heavily today for some reason. There's thunder and lightning everywhere. We can hardly tell whether it is day or night...
:'''Garrison Log Fragment:''' ...A faint, sad voice can be dimly heard in the thunder. Scary...
:'''Garrison Log Fragment:''' Old Man Hachino said this is happening because the Ogosho is enraged. What nonsense. Inazuma is a peaceful place. What reason would the Ogosho have to be angry?
:'''Garrison Log Fragment:''' ...We can't find Heita anywhere. Once this storm is over, he shall have to be punished...
:'''Garrison Log Fragment:''' ...We can see strange flames amidst the rain...
:'''Garrison Log Fragment:''' (The contents end here)

==Serpent's Head==
This ward is restored in [[Orobashi's Legacy: Part II]] using the [[Serpent's Head: Rock Pillar Pearl]] and [[Serpent's Head: Rock Pillar Warding Stone]]. The Rock Pillar Pearl is locked behind a [[Sacred Stone Puzzle]] that cannot be completed before the quest. The Rock Pillar Warding Stone is locked behind an underground puzzle and can be collected before the quest.

;(Before starting [[Orobashi's Legacy]])
:'''Observe:''' The strange stone lantern seems to emit an ominous energy.
:'''Paimon:''' This stone lantern is so creepy... It feels familiar.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, someone's written something on the lantern post!
:'''Observe:''' "Soldiers stationed here, if you have any questions about this ward, please go to the [[Musoujin Gorge]] and talk to [[Kaji|Mr. Kaji]]."
:'''Observe:''' The handwriting looks new, yet eroded by rain. A few clear lines of smaller writings are below.
:'''Observe:''' "Please don't believe these strange notes. We've got no time to lose! This {{sic|must an}} enemy trick meant to slow us down."
:'''Observe:''' "Whoever leaves the team without permission will be severely punished!"
:'''Paimon:''' This Mr. Kaji seems to be pretty concerned about these stone lanterns. Why don't we go to Musoujin Gorge and ask him?

===Waterlogged Note===
Next to the Narukami Pillar is a Waterlogged Note left by a radical faction within the [[Watatsumi Army]], revealing [[Nathan]] and the Resistance's involvement in breaking the wards on Yashiori Island.

{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Waterlogged Note:''' ...If anyone leaks the team's secrets, they shall be held accountable...
:'''Waterlogged Note:''' Phase 1: Ambush the [[Shogunate]] soldiers on a rainy night using our long-studied tactics, switch outfits with them, and obtain their ship's supplies.
:'''Waterlogged Note:''' Phase 2: Attack and {{sic|break Shogunate's}} wards according to the methods [[Nathan|Mr. Nathan]] explained, and restore the dignity of our great [[Orobashi|Omikami]].
:'''Waterlogged Note:''' Stage 3: If the plan does not go well, sacrifice yourselves for our mighty Omikami. If things go well, you may retreat safely. But in neither case can you reveal your identity, thus implicating our [[Sangonomiya Kokomi|Divine Priestess]]...
:'''Waterlogged Note:''' The above information is to be kept strictly confidential. Not a word to anyone, whether it be Her Excellency the Divine Priestess or our lowest-ranking comrades. Those with loose lips will face the consequences.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Jakotsu Mine==
The Narukami Pillar at [[Jakotsu Mine]] is inside a barrier that can only be removed during [[Orobashi's Legacy: Part III]] by completing the [[Sacred Stone Puzzle]] around it after obtaining the quest. It is restored in that quest using the [[Jakotsu Mine: Rock Pillar Pearl]] and [[Jakotsu Mine: Rock Pillar Warding Stone]]. Both items are locked behind [[Thunder Barrier]]s and can be collected before the quest.

==Fort Mumei==
The Narukami Pillar at [[Fort Mumei]] does not appear until the [[Sacred Stone Puzzle]] in Fort Mumei is completed during the quest [[Orobashi's Legacy: Part IV]] or [[Orobashi's Legacy: Part V]]. It is restored in that quest using the [[Fort Mumei: Rock Pillar Pearl]] and [[Fort Mumei: Rock Pillar Warding Stone]]. Both items can only be collected once the ward appears.
