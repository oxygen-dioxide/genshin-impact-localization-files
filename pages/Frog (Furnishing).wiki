|description    = A small frog that often appears in wetlands.<br>This animal is very common in wetland areas, and its body secretes a mysterious sticky substance that has much medicinal utility.<br>Because the Realm Within has a lot of moisture, the frogs can also be found in the grass, and sometimes less careful dogs might end up stepping on their slippery backs and falling over.
