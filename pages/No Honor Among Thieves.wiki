==Steps==
{{Quest Description|A group of [[Treasure Hoarders]] have made camp in the wilderness and are up to no good. Defeat them to put an end to this threat.}}

==Gameplay Notes==
* Unlike most quests, where reinforcement waves spawn after all enemies have been defeated, most versions of this commission spawn reinforcements after any 3 enemies have been defeated.
