If the sunlight's too blinding, try covering one eye with an eyepatch &mdash; it might even remind you of an old friend from afar, y'know? Haha, just kidding.

Now that you've traveled so much, you probably have more than a few friends with their eyes covered. But on a day like this, nothing beats a drink with the closest of old friends, reminiscing about the good old days... Now that's no joke.

So, same spot, same seats, what do you say? Maybe you're up for a new drink and a game of cards that's not [[Genius Invokation TCG]]?

Just like old times, I'll have one ready for you, and I won't be drunk before you get here, trust me.
