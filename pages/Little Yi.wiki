{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Little Yi:''' Hello, person whose name I don't know! Are you here to hear the story?
:{{DIcon}} A story?
::'''Little Yi:''' Yep! Uncle Ghast's stories are so cool! They're kinda scary... And they're true!
::{{DIcon}} ...True?
:::'''Little Yi:''' Yep! Some of the stories actually happened in real life...
:::'''Little Yi:''' Like the one about Dusky Ming! I've even seen her before, and she said we should play again next time...
:::'''Little Yi:''' But I think ghosts probably don't have very good memory, because she's never come to play with me again since then.
::{{DIcon}} How spooky...
:::'''Little Yi:''' I know, right!? The story used to give me the creeps every time...
:::'''Little Yi:''' But after I saw Dusky Ming for myself, I wasn't scared anymore. Ghosts aren't that scary!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Little Yi:''' Bye!
