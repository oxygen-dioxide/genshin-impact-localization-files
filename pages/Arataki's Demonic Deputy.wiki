Shinobu's hair is held up in a messy ponytail with a thick dark reddish rope and a dark hairpiece with gold accents. In addition to this, she has messy bangs and wears a strapless dark gray mask that covers the lower portion of her face.

Shinobu's outfit consists of a dark-colored cropped top exposing her navel in the lower part of her midriff, matching dark shorts, and a black belt decorated with a thick red rope tied into a bow. Over this, she wears a cropped dark purple-red and gold-trimmed hooded jacket with a buckle, and dark gloves that leave certain fingers exposed. She also has thigh-high legwear with red armor plating that ends at her ankles, which she pairs with sandals and dark magenta toenail polish. Her outfit is decorated with a number of gold and red accents and trinkets and thicker red ropes, most notably around her chest area. In addition to this, she wears a single samurai plate over her left shoulder, where her {{Electro}} [[Vision]] is attached.
