** {{Color|Old:}} The adepti deserve the greatest applause, considering their years of seclusion... They hardly recognized the city.

Not only did they manage to cooperate with the Qixing, but in the end, they even tried to understand the heart of the people.<br>{{Color|New:}} Take the adepti, for instance. Owing to their years of seclusion, they were the least informed. Yet, when faced with a crisis, they, commendably, showed the greatest amount of restraint possible.

Thank you for joining me on this journey, Traveler.
** {{Color|Old:}} These things were all a part of my script. The only unforeseen plot twist was the conduct of the Liyue Qixing.<br>{{Color|New:}} All of these things turned out as I had planned. There is only one thing that I had not anticipated... and that was the conduct of the Liyue Qixing.
** {{Color|Old:}} That is the case. And since Raiden is also the Shogun of {{Highlight|the Inazuma Bakufu}}, people call her the Raiden Shogun.<br>{{Color|New:}} That is the case. And since Raiden is also the Shogun of {{Highlight|Inazuma}}, people call her the Raiden Shogun.
** {{Color|Old:}} Yes.
