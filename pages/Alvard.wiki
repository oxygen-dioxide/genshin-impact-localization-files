'''Alvard''' is an open-world [[NPC]] located in the [[Administrative Area]], [[Fortress of Meropide]], [[Fontaine]]. He is the owner of the [[Rag and Bone Shop]].

He can be found under the [[File:Icon Rag and Bone Shop.png|25px]] icon on the map while the shop still has anything for purchase. The icon disappears upon buying the last item, signifying that there is nothing left to purchase, although Alvard can still be found there.
