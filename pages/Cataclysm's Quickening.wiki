==Summary==
;Into the Deepwater Murk

The following morning, the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] wake up to find one of [[Lyney]]'s cards near them. Reading the card, they discover that the prison has their monthly "free day" off and to meet at the usual spot, as he has new information.

While making their way to Lyney, the two run into various individuals, such as [[Laverune]] and [[Cuistot]], the "Bombshell Bros". They learn from them that getting the [[Wriothesley|Duke's]] attention is beneficial and that two people have been frequently visiting the infirmary. They also overhear several prisoners deciding to stay in the prison even after their sentences are over before meeting up with Lyney. Lyney reveals that [[The Knave|"Father"]] knew that [[Tartaglia|Childe]] had initially come to Fontaine for personal reasons and they were tasked with finding his location. Therefore, [[Freminet]] would be suited for the task, while [[Lynette]] would continue gathering information and Lyney himself would assist Freminet.

Still needing more information, Lyney asks the Traveler to help infiltrate the infirmary by feigning illness, though they get no relevant information from [[Sigewinne]] or the two people, [[Jurieu]] and [[Lourvine]]. During next few days, the Traveler collects information and passes it to Lynette, preparing for their meeting with Lyney.

;The Truth Shrouded in Shadow
On the ninth day, the Traveler meets up with Lyney, who reveals that Lynette had also feigned illness to acquire more information from the infirmary. However, when they arrive, Lynette is nowhere to be seen and the bed she was using tidied, causing Lyney to become uneasy. They soon discover a paper and read the contents, learning that Wriothesley had known of their motives. Lyney, worried for his siblings' safety and not wanting to be separated from Lynette again, decides to confront Wriothesley, against the Traveler's wishes, forcing them to follow him into the office.

Lyney heads to the administrative office and accuses Wriothesley of kidnapping Lynette and likely Freminet, though he appears to dodge the accusation, much to his anger. Wriothesley states that he simply locked Freminet out, knowing that he would not abandon his family. He offers Lyney a proposal; their safety would be guaranteed if he asks "Father" to come for a talk, since he did not like the Fatui intrusion in his fortress, though Lyney refuses, believing that he was trying to blackmail them. Wriothesley decides to end the negotiation for his afternoon tea, though the Traveler steps in on Lyney's behalf. Wriothesley allows to hear the Traveler out, since they had come under [[Neuvillette]]'s request and agrees to release them if they answer several questions of his.

Wriothesley questions the Traveler over the "hidden rules", starting with the [[Production Zone]]. They deduce that the "strange meat" is actually Sigewinne's cooking, meant to help restore stamina to those working non-stop, but because of how [[Melusine]]s perceive differently, humans would believe it to be non-edible and thus avoid it. Wriothesley is pleased that someone had acknowledged Sigewinne's cooking and then asks them about the strange red liquid. The Traveler deduces that the liquid is actually experimental [[Fonta]] which was only accepted because Wriothesley had allowed it, and thus meant to teach prisoners how to spend their [[Credit Coupons]] wisely. Wriothesley acknowledges the answer and then asks about the secret behind Sigewinne and the people in the infirmary, though the Traveler is unable to answer it as they had not covered it. Lyney suddenly snaps and charges at Wriothesley, alarming the Traveler, but before he could do anything, he is hit in the neck by a projectile. Sigewinne had come in and had shot a tranquillizer dart, which causes him to collapse before Wriothesley states that they have incoming guests.

The guests turn out to be [[Clorinde]] and an unconscious Freminet who Sigewinne immediately inspects and deduces from his symptoms that he consumed [[Primordial Sea|Primordial Water]], shocking Lyney. Clorinde reveals that the concentration of Primordial Water had increased significantly around the prison and that Freminet had correctly deduced something was wrong when he tried to follow Childe's path. Sigewinne gives Freminet a pill while Lynette arrives and they bring him to the infirmary, where he regains consciousness and warns the group of his discovery, recalling the events leading up to his near-death encounter. Learning that Clorinde had saved him, he decides to thank her in person. Sigewinne suggests they talk to Wriothesley for more information, while Lyney decides to remain behind with his siblings.
----
;Secret Keepers and Forbidden Zones
Returning to the office, the Traveler and Paimon ask Wriothesley to "enlighten" them about recent events. He tells them that he knew the children were all Fatui operatives at the start and originally believed they were sent to find Childe, but learned of Lyney's true motive during their work around the prison; he wanted to look into the "forbidden zone". Once he realized this, he intervened for both their and the prison's safety and that he had hired Clorinde for "work". He offers to take them to the "forbidden zone", which they accept.

Wriothesley takes them to the area, explaining that only he was allowed to enter. When they arrive at the central room, they find a large sluice gate in the middle of the room, where he asks Paimon what she thinks the gate was for. Paimon makes some guesses, but Wriothesley tells her she's incorrect and explains the gate's purpose and the readings on the dashboard nearby. They had never moved when he first laid eyes on them, but they had slowly begun to increase in the past year; coupled with Freminet's near-death experience, he concludes that the gate must be holding back the water from swallowing Fontaine and that it would eventually fail.

Wriothesley then begins to explain about the fortress' purpose; when the previous Hydro Archon, [[Egeria]], ruled the land, all the criminals were exiled with nowhere to go and shunned by society. Some of these people began to repent and beg for forgiveness, which she granted by having them guard her secret beneath the waves, which they did with the present-day fortress. Meeting up with Jurieu and Lourvine, Wriothesley reveals that after believing the Primordial Sea to be behind the gate, he had begun constructing a boat after being inspired by Remurian legend, though it had been kept secret from the rest of the prison as they would likely riot should they learn of it. Before they leave, he tells them that they had the option of informing Lyney and his group of what he just told them.
----
;Calamitous Tread
Returning to the infirmary, Lyney informs the Traveler and Paimon of his deductions through their information they acquired, which impresses the two as he was nearly right on every topic. They in turn then inform the three of what they learned from Wriothesley, telling them that they had no time to fight. The three siblings are shocked by the revelation but thank them for the information, with Lyney thanking them for saving his family. Paimon soon becomes hungry and they head to the canteen, where Sigewinne treats them to a delicious meal.

Once the meal is finished, the two return to the dorms to sleep, only to be interrupted by Cuistot, Laverune and others in a large panic. Cuistot informs them that they've been given orders to head upwards, away from the bottom. The Traveler realizes that the sluice gate had likely failed and they rush down to find Wriothesley, finding him with Clorinde just as the gate fails. Wriothesley manages to hold the waters briefly with his {{Cryo}} powers, though it soon smashes through the ice. Clorinde then shoots a control panel with {{Electro}} before Wriothesley freezes the entire gate to stop the water from advancing. With a brief moment of respite, Wriothesley informs the Traveler to fetch Neuvillette, knowing that they would not be able to hold back the water for long.

Returning to surface entrance to the prison behind the [[Opera Epiclese]], they find Neuvillette there, who asks them to watch Furina as she was in a meeting with the Knave, worried for her safety and agrees to head to the prison to deal with the growing situation. The Traveler and Paimon arrive at the meeting, defending Furina from the Knave's attempts to pressure her. During the meeting, Paimon notices their cups shaking, making Arlecchino realize that they might be in the next stage of the prophecy.

Back at the prison, Neuvillette arrives and takes over the situation, using his powers to push the water back and reseal the sluice gate, stating that the sentence was too severe for the people of Fontaine. Back at the party, Arlecchino drops the pleasantries and confronts Furina over the prophecy, accusing her of not protecting her people. Furina claims to have a primary and backup plan, though when Arlecchino questions her over it, claims both to be confidential. Arlecchino then asks about the [[Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale]], as she wonders what the large amount of Indemnitium was going to be used for. She then realizes Neuvillette was not present and they change to less serious topics at hand before concluding the tea party, but asks the Traveler to see her off.

As they leave the opera house, Arlecchino thanks the Traveler for watching over her "children", confident in the siblings' judgement and abilities in the prison before asking what they thought of Furina. When the Traveler is not able to come up with their perspective on her, she decides to share her own. Learning of Childe's apprehension, she decided to meet the Archon in-person, knowing that he had given her an opportunity to do so. One night, she discovered Furina trying to play with a cat and attempted to take the [[Gnosis]], but discovered that she did not hold it before sensing a "curse" on her. Furina, believing that someone was trying to assassinate her, begged for mercy. Noting the genuine fear in her eyes and with no Gnosis, Arlecchino left. Her subordinates then confirmed that Furina was severely shaken by the "assassination" attempt, unable to sleep or even eat her cake. She then entertains the thought that Neuvillette might be the Hydro Archon and/or knew where the Gnosis was.

With Childe having gone missing from the fortress soon after, Arlecchino realized that she could diplomatically pressure Furina and Neuvillette for a meeting. Paimon is surprised that she would blatantly attack the Hydro Archon, though she reminds her that no one would believe the claim. She then tells them that she believes that Neuvillette is not the Hydro Archon either, as their behavior was not fitting of one given her time with the [[Tsaritsa]].

Neuvillette then arrives, prompting Arlecchino to take her leave, though she tells the Traveler that she would be happy to cooperate with them if needed. The Traveler then asks Neuvillette about what he did. He then remarks about mourning the recent turn of events, causing the area to begin raining. The Traveler then recalls what Freminet told them about the Dragon of Water before realizing that Neuvillette is actually the Hydro Sovereign. When he indirectly confirms it, he spots Furina stealing a quick glance at the Traveler before running off, distracting him before Paimon calls him back to his senses before confirming that he's the Hydro Sovereign, though telling them to keep it a secret. He then tells them about the dragons' past; when the [[Heavenly Principles|First Usurper]] arrived on Teyvat, they took part of the Seven Sovereigns' power to create the Archons' Authorities. Paimon asks if he could stop the prophecy, of which he states that he would not be able to do much unless the Hydro Archon gave his Authority back to him and thus should look towards other solutions.
----
;A Moment's Respite

Returning to the fortress once more, the Traveler and Paimon talk to everyone they met, learning that the prison was faring fine after Neuvillette pushed the water back. Wriothesley allows them to wander around the fortress and even stay in their cell until their sentence is finished. Upon returning to their cell, the Traveler and Paimon remark about their adventures and take a sleep.

Meanwhile, at the Primordial Sea, Childe can be seen drifting through its depths when he regains consciousness. He becomes shocked to find a massive [[All-Devouring Narwhal|narwhal]] swimming right above him.
