==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Cheven:''' Hello. Do you need any accessories or weapons today?
:{{DIcon}} You make both?
::'''Cheven:''' Yes, that's right. Is anything the matter?
::'''Cheven:''' To the people of the [[Children of Echoes]], there's little difference between forging accessories and forging weapons. Both involve using phlogiston to process ore.
::'''Cheven:''' It is also extremely common to adorn weapons and accessories with gems. Any piece of equipment that doesn't have a gemstone engraved on it is of no use at all.
::'''Cheven:''' On the other hand, if you see someone digging for ore with a chisel that's engraved with row upon row of crystals, you can rest assured, for that's the surest sign that you've got a real expert on the job.
::{{DIcon}} Very impressive.
::'''Cheven:''' I feel the same way.
::'''Cheven:''' Still, I find that practice a bit too avant garde. The way I look at it, if you want to customize your tools, engraving two or three stones is more than enough.
::'''Cheven:''' Ah, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Cheven, the owner of Muhuru's Gemporium. I'm a jeweler by trade, but I know how to make weapons too.
::'''Cheven:''' Most of the weapons I make are in the traditional style. They've been proven to be reliable and easy to wield.
::'''Cheven:''' If you'd like to check out some newer styles, you can try your luck with [[Xilonen]]. She's not always around, though &mdash; you might have to check every tree in Natlan to find her sunbathing spot.
:{{DIcon}} I don't need either at the moment.
::'''Cheven:''' No worries at all. Take care.
