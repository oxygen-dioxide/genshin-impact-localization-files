;(Talk to Keqing at the Jade Chamber)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 1 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Ah, you've arrived. I've made all the necessary preparations and even packed some handmade snacks.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 1 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Oh, that reminds me, I've also prepared some launch tubes made by Pengyi. I hope the adepti will like them. Is there anything else I should bring?
:{{DIcon}} I think that should be everything.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 1 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Good. In that case, let's first pay Madame Ping a visit in the city before heading out to Jueyun Karst.
{{Dialogue end}}

{{Quest Description|update|At Keqing's request, you accompany her to look into the matter of festive gift-giving. You travail across the land, delivering gifts and presents to various places in Liyue...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach Madame Ping near Yujing Terrace)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 madameping 01.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' The festive season is upon us. This is no time to be running hither and thither. You should relax and enjoy the season.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 yanfei 01.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' I get it Granny, but you know, having lots of clients is a good thing!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 madameping 02.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Hehe, I'm sure it is... But really, child, who could be seeking your help during the Lantern Rite?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 yanfei 02.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' You'd be surprised...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Madame Ping! Happy Lantern Rite!
:{{DIcon}} Happy Lantern Rite.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' It's a pleasure to see you again, Madame Ping. How are you?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 madameping 03.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Oh dear, well look who's here. I am so glad to see you all in time for the festival.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 yanfei 03.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Hello, Traveler, long time no see.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 yanfei 04.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Oh, and Lady Keqing is here, too.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' The [[Qixing]] have prepared some small gifts for you to celebrate this festive occasion. There are some seasonal goods, two bolts of fine silk, and some exotic flower seeds which I picked specifically for you, Madame Ping.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I've brought all the lighter gifts with me, but the silks are still on the way. I just submitted them for delivery, so I'm sure they'll arrive in good time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 keqing 09.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Please accept our humble gifts, I hope you'll find them to your liking.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 yanfei 11.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Wow, those gifts sound marvelous! Please be sure to thank the Qixing on our behalf.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 madameping 04.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Yes, how very nice of you. I'm sure the flowers will be most beautiful if you personally selected the seeds. Thank you very much, Keqing.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Please enjoy them. We intend to visit the other adepti as well, so I'm afraid we must be going now.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 madameping 05.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' I presume you mean Cloud Retainer and the others? Yes, they should be over in [[Jueyun Karst]].
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 madameping 06.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' By the way, I've heard that you designed all the street decorations yourself, Keqing. You decorated the city so beautifully, yet you don't even have the time to go and see it for yourself. What a pity...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 madameping 07.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Yanfei really enjoys spending time at the festival, you'll find her wandering around there whenever she can spare a moment.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 yanfei 05.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' C'mon, Granny, I wasn't wandering around. I was providing essential consultation to my clients.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 madameping 08.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Oh, is that so? Were you also holding consultations with clients while you stood in front of the Grilled Tiger Fish stand for all that time?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 yanfei 06.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' As a matter of fact, I was helping them calculate the prices. It's not easy, you know. I had to check a lot of different items.
:{{DIcon}} So you're working during Lantern Rite, too?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 yanfei 07.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' That's right. There are no holidays in my line of work. I have to be ready whenever my clients need me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That sounds exhausting! Paimon can't imagine a life without holidays!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 yanfei 08.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Well, though there are no set holidays, I do get to decide on my own schedule. I can always budget some time to relax.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 yanfei 09.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Otherwise, I would always look exhausted in front of potential clients. It'd be hard to land new cases after leaving a terrible first impression.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 yanfei 10.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Besides, what's the saying... Ah yes, "A rested worker is an efficient worker!"
:{{DIcon}} Have you been to the festival yet, Keqing?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I was there many times when I was supervising the festival construction, but I haven't been there since.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I was planning to go after I finish my work, but the work keeps piling up... I ended up completely forgetting about it.
:{{DIcon}} Let's go together once you're finished with your work.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Yes, I should take the opportunity to show you around while you're here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 2 keqing 08.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' But first, we should head to Jueyun Karst. If you'll excuse us, Madame Ping, we'll be leaving now.

;(After conversation with Madame Ping ends)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 5 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Let's see... which adeptus shall we visit first?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm. Oh, why don't we visit Cloud Retainer at Mt. Aocang first?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She usually stays inside her abode, so she'll be super easy to find.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 5 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Alright, Cloud Retainer it is.

;(Talk to Yanfei again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj102 yanfei 01.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Lady Keqing is so hard-working. Maybe I should take a leaf out of her book...

;(Talk to Madame Ping again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj102 madameping 01.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' I know that you must be busy, but please take care of yourself. Sacrificing your health is never wise.
----
;(Head to Mt. Aocang and approach Ganyu and Cloud Retainer)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 01.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' The festive season is fast approaching. What brings you to one's abode? Has the [[Ministry of Civil Affairs]] simply run out of work for you to do?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 ganyu 01.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Well, with Lantern Rite just around the corner, I decided it was a good time to take leave and pay you a visit.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 ganyu 02.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' But, um... where are [[Moon Carver]] and [[Mountain Shaper]]?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 02.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Them? Hmph! Don't even get one started...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 03.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Oh? Is that not the Traveler? And the Yuheng too. A rare visitor, indeed.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Happy Lantern Rite, everybody!
:{{DIcon}} Happy Lantern Rite.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Greetings, venerable adeptus. And greetings, Ganyu.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 ganyu 11.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Huh, Lady Keqing? I didn't expect to see you here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 44.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' (The Yuheng of the Qixing? Here? Most fascinating...)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 04.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Hmm... Most courteous of you to travel hither and pay your respects. What is the purpose of your visit, if one may ask?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' It's the festive season and on behalf of the Qixing, I'd like to give you our regards. Please accept our humble gifts.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 05.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' As the governing body of Liyue, the Qixing must be busy with a myriad of affairs. And yet, you still take the time to visit one in this mountain abode. Eminently considerate of you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 06.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Oh? What an amusing cylindrical device. I wonder what that could be...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' This is a new type of firework which has been modified by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. I've heard that you are fond of gadgets, so I've brought one for your amusement.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 keqing 11.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' (Cloud Retainer... although she is not outwardly opposed to us, she is still skeptical of Liyue being ruled by humans.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 keqing 12.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' (Maybe she thinks humans are still too young to handle it. Hmm, no matter, with time, our strength will become apparent enough. Before then, we should try to give her a good impression.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 keqing 13.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' (Hehe... Good thing I came prepared! Cloud Retainer has a great interest in gadgets, so she will certainly appreciate this gift.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 keqing 14.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' (Ganyu has said that Cloud Retainer is very picky about food, so I made sure not to bring any snacks to avoid upsetting her. I've given everything thorough consideration, it should all go well.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 45.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' (Goodness me, whoever would have thought... Oh? My, how very interesting.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 07.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' It is intricate, with ingenious design... And is aesthetically agreeable...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 ganyu 12.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' (Yes, judging from Cloud Retainer's expression, it seems this gift was a success.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 46.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Very good, one shall gladly accept this device.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 08.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' One surmises from Ganyu's words that you also wish to see Moon Carver and Mountain Shaper. Pity, your timing is most unfortunate.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? Are they not home? We wanted to see them, too.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 09.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Hmph. Those two old fossils...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 10.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Moon Carver has been most anxious to see how Liyue Harbor fares. But the agreement was clear. Liyue is now in the hands of the Qixing, and he cannot simply roam into the city and begin supervising others' work as he pleases.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 11.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' So, one tried to persuade him otherwise, proposing that if he could not be placated, he could go to the city disguised as a human, and take a brief look around. Alas, he is too stubborn, too proud. He would have none of it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 12.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Thereafter, he left, claiming to have gone traveling. He has not returned since.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 13.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Mountain Shaper, however, is more open-minded. But he said he wished to look for something new with which to defend the tranquility of his mountain.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 14.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' He told one that he was leaving in search of treasures, and one has not heard from him since... Wait! Surely this is not a case of two old coots in cahoots, rusing to excuse themselves that they might venture behind one's back to scurry away and go traveling together!?
:{{DIcon}} (Seems possible...)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 shenhe 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Huh? What's everybody doing here?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 15.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' This voice... Is it [[Shenhe]]?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 keqing 15.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Oh?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? So Shenhe's here, too. Is she also here to visit Cloud Retainer?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 ganyu 03.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Is she the one that you mentioned before?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 shenhe 02.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Hello, everyone.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 16.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Shenhe, this is Ganyu. You have most likely heard of her.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 ganyu 04.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Oh&mdash; Hello, I'm Ganyu. I work at Yujing Terrace. I've heard that you've returned to Liyue Harbor recently, so if you need anything, please feel free to come to me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 shenhe 03.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I will. Thank you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 shenhe 04.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I brought some food from the city. I heard that during Lantern Rite, people in Liyue bring food to share with their friends, so here I am.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 keqing 19.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' (Oh no! I intentionally refrained from bringing any snacks. Is... Is this going to be okay?)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 17.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Oh? And you even brought food for those two old fossils?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 shenhe 05.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' That's right.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 47.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Hmph...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 keqing 16.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Ahem...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 18.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' After barely a few days in the city, you have learned so much. Thank you for these delectable edibles, Shenhe.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 keqing 17.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Phew...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 ganyu 13.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 19.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Everyone, you shall all be staying in Liyue Harbor in the future. One should like to think that you will all look out for each other. Is that understood?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 shenhe 06.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Will do.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 ganyu 05.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Yes, understood.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 keqing 18.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' This place is much livelier than I'd imagined...
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like it's time we change the topic!
::{{DIcon}} Speaking of which, have you seen [[Xiao]]?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 20.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' The Conqueror of Demons? One has not seen him of late.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, then he's probably not in Jueyun Karst. Let's go look for him in his usual spot at Wangshu Inn.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 21.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' In short, one is the only adeptus who has elected to remain in Jueyun Karst for the festival.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 22.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Had Ganyu not come to visit, one would likely have stayed firmly put in one's abode to resume research of gadgets and mechanics.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 ganyu 06.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I didn't mean to interrupt you. Please accept my profuse apologies.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 23.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Haha, why the sudden solemnity? It would certainly not be the first time one has been interrupted on your account.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 24.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' As a youngling, you did so love to scurry around the place whilst one's attention was monopolized by mechanisms... You were especially drawn to a certain implement one had made. Oh, what was it...?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh?
:{{DIcon}} Huh?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' (Oh no, here she goes again! This could spell trouble for Ganyu.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 ganyu 07.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Huh!? Oh&mdash;uh, I'm sorry, Cloud Retainer! I&mdash;I just remembered there's something I must attend to. I should be going!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 25.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Oh? Why the sudden haste? With the Yuheng present, why not settle this matter here and now?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 ganyu 08.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Uh, n&mdash;no, it's something very important. In fact, I&mdash;I must see Lady [[Ningguang]] about it immediately...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 26.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' A matter so pressing that you must find Ningguang in person?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Ahem... Ah, yes, Ningguang and I have different scopes of work, you see, and Ganyu has to report to both of us respectively. It's indeed not easy for her.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 ganyu 09.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' (Lady Keqing is trying to help me!)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 ganyu 10.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Yes, that's right! I'm very sorry, everyone. I will take my leave!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 27.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Huh, gone already... That child... She has always been easily ruffled.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 28.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' One can sympathize, however. It is no simple thing to be a secretary. Nearly every matter in Liyue Harbor, momentous or trivial, passes through Ganyu's diligent hands.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 29.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' But even as an adeptus, she must never neglect her own health, lest she fall prone to exhaustion.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 30.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Ganyu is an assiduous worker, apt to foregoing food and rest once she is busy. Please make sure she eats and sleeps properly whenever you see her.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I will, Ganyu has always been a great asset to us. Her health is a priority, so I will take good care of her.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 31.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' The Yuheng, reliable as ever, hehe.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 32.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' It was indeed a wise decision to leave Liyue Harbor to you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' We will certainly strive to live up to your expectations.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 33.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' As for these edibles... Hmm, they do look delectable indeed.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 34.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' You may leave them here. Shenhe shall bring these into one's abode, and one shall pass them on to Moon Carver and Mountain Shaper once they have made their return.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 35.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' This firework has an intriguing design. One must conduct a thorough study of it. And one also wants to hear what Shenhe has learned in Liyue Harbor.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 shenhe 07.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Yes, I have many interesting stories to tell.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 36.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Let us chat whilst one scrutinizes this device.
:{{DIcon}} You'll continue your research even during Lantern Rite?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, don't you rest during the holidays? This is a festive season, after all!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 37.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Hah, one has long been living secluded in the mountains and no longer observes the holidays. Worry not, one shall take appropriate care of oneself.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 38.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Rest is crucial. If one is too devoted to one's research and falls ill, one shall be in no fit state to test the devices personally.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is it really that important to test it yourself?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 39.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Of course. As one sows, so do they reap, and the joy of reaping is what one yearns for.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 40.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' If one spends all that time working on a machine, yet forgets to test the outcome...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 41.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Hmph, that would be akin to a chef who never tries his own food, no?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 42.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' It is unwise to put the cart before the horse.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 cloudretainer 43.ogg}} '''Cloud Retainer:''' Enough idle chatter, everyone. One must go and continue one's research. Come, Shenhe, this way.

:'''Cloud Retainer leaves with Shenhe...'''

:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A chef who doesn't get to try their own food... Hmm, that would be kinda weird.
:{{DIcon}} You sure caught on to that one quickly.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cloud Retainer sure does know a lot about gadgets and cooking! Though she can be a bit strange sometimes... but then again, she is an adeptus!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 keqing 08.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' That's the wisdom of an adeptus. She takes good care of those around her. Though she lives in seclusion, she also manages to bring everyone together.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 keqing 09.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' A hermit who's more social than most living in society. Hmm, what an interesting character.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 6 keqing 10.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Traveler, Paimon, let's head to Wangshu Inn. Perhaps we'll find the Conqueror of Demons there.
----
;(Approach Wangshu Inn)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 7 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Let's ask Verr Goldet where the Conqueror of Demons may be.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Hold on, isn't that...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[Qiqi]]! Oh, and the weird guy with the snake around his neck!

;(Approach Qiqi and Baizhu)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 8 qiqi 01.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Dr. [[Baizhu]], here are the herbs... I've picked lots of them.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 8 baizhu 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Splendid. Let me pack up and then we can be on our way.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey you guys! What are you doing?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 8 qiqi 02.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Dr. Baizhu wanted herbs. So, I came to collect herbs, lots of them. And... Dr. Baizhu came too.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 8 baizhu 02.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Traveler, Paimon... Oh! And Lady Keqing! It's a pleasure to see you all. We're here stocking up more herbs.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 8 baizhu 03.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' [[Bubu Pharmacy]] always runs out of digestive herbs during the festival seasons. With Lantern Rite just around the corner, I thought we should get prepared.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 8 baizhu 04.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' We came all this way to collect some herbs, and we've picked quite the assortment. We'll be on our way back to the pharmacy once the herbs are sorted.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 8 baizhu 05.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' I certainly didn't expect to see the Yuheng all the way out here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 8 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I have some business to attend to here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 8 baizhu 06.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Ah, I see.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 8 baizhu 07.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' It's nearly time to celebrate Lantern Rite and you're still running errands... hardworking as always!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 8 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I appreciate the sentiment, Dr. Baizhu. I'm just doing my job.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 8 qiqi 03.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Keqing and the Traveler are very busy... And we are busy too.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 8 qiqi 04.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Everyone... keep it up.
:{{DIcon}} Yes, keep it up, everyone!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 8 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Right, thank you, Qiqi.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 8 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' We shouldn't tarry here any longer. Take care, you two... Ahem! Three.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 8 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Traveler, let's go find Verr Goldet.

;(Talk to Qiqi or Baizhu again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj102 qiqi 01.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Dr. Baizhu, are we done yet?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj102 baizhu 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Yes, almost. But don't rush me, just give me a moment...

;(Talk to Verr Goldet)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 10 verrgoldet 01.ogg}} '''Verr Goldet:''' Ah, Lady Keqing, what a surprise! Is there anything I can help you with?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 10 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' No, thank you. I'm just wondering if you might know where the Conqueror of Demons is?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 10 verrgoldet 02.ogg}} '''Verr Goldet:''' Oh, we never inquire about Xiao's whereabouts. But if he's here, he would be up on the rooftop terrace. Please feel free to go up and have a look.

;(Talk to Verr Goldet again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj102 verrgoldet 01.ogg}} '''Verr Goldet:''' If you're looking for Xiao, you can check the rooftop terrace upstairs.

;(Approach the roof terrace)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Hmm, he doesn't seem to be here. Perhaps we came at the wrong time?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Maybe he's out battling somewhere again...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's leave the gifts with the owner and ask her to...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' How can I help?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aaaah!!!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;Where did you come from? You scared Paimon!
:{{DIcon}} Were you here the whole time, Xiao?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Yes.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Hello, I am Keqing, Yuheng of the Liyue Qixing.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' The Yuheng... Yes, I saw you when we battled [[Osial]]. You are fierce with your blade.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh anyway, we're here to give you some Lantern Rite presents! See, there's lots of tasty food!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Hmph, don't waste your delicacies on me.
:{{DIcon}} The Qixing specifically prepared them for you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Hmph...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Eradicating demons is my duty. You don't have to thank me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 xiao 11.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Karma is harmful to humans. Even though your constitution surpasses that of ordinary mortals... It would be best if you didn't approach me so casually.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, wait! Are you leaving?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' C'mon, Lantern Rite is almost here! Don't you want to take a break?
:{{DIcon}} Why don't we go watch the fireworks in the city together?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 xiao 07.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Like I said before, I have no liking for crowds.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 xiao 08.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I must remain vigilant of evil attacks, especially during the holidays. I will continue my patrol as usual.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 xiao 09.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' You should also exercise caution. And if there's any danger...
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, we know.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 xiao 10.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Good.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And he's gone...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, Xiao hasn't changed a bit. Wonder if he'll come and watch the fireworks this year, though.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe.
:{{DIcon}} Only if he wants to.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Alright, we've completed our visits with all the adepti. Let's take a break downstairs before we head back into the city.

:'''After a short break, everyone gathers on the ground floor of the inn.'''

:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 pengyi 01.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' Oh no! What should we do!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 pengyi 02.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' Huh? Oh, Lady Keqing, Lady Keqing! I'm so glad to see you here!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Pengyi? What's wrong? What are you doing here?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 pengyi 03.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' Lady Keqing, let me explain...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 pengyi 04.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' I had rearranged the fireworks layout and expanded the range to Qingce Village, just like you requested.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 pengyi 05.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' My people finished setting up the fireworks and we left someone in charge to launch them for the show.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 pengyi 06.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' But... *sigh* the person we left in charge came back shortly after, and reported that all the fireworks in Qingce Village have been stolen!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 pengyi 07.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' I immediately reported the situation to the Millelith, and had another batch of fireworks made to be transported to Qingce Village under escort.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 pengyi 08.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' However, everyone's short-handed during Lantern Rite. The Millelith are already stretched thin and don't even have enough people to fill their regular patrols. They can't spare anyone to look after the fireworks for us.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 pengyi 09.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' We don’t have many materials left, so if the second batch of fireworks gets stolen as well, we're done for... So, I was thinking to go to Qingce Village and have a look first.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 pengyi 10.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' Which is when I bumped into you. Lady Keqing, what should we do?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' According to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the number of guards on patrol has to be doubled and rotated continuously during Lantern Rite.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' They must perform these extra measures in addition to their standard daily affairs. The only manpower they can muster during the festival would be the emergency response units.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' But, those special units are intended only for backup. There are not many of them, and they cannot perform prolonged guard duty. If we wish to make use of them, we'll need to resolve the problem quickly.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, maybe we could ask the adepti for help...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This would be a piece of cake for someone like Cloud Retainer or Xiao!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 keqing 08.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' *sigh* No, that would only make us look incompetent. I'll handle this, Pengyi.
:{{DIcon}} (We can't let Keqing do this all by herself.)
::{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 paimon 12a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We can help too, Keqing!
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, let us help you.
::{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 paimon 12b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's right, we can take care of this together!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 keqing 09.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Thanks, you two. Actually, I have an idea. Let me make some arrangements.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 keqing 10.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Pengyi, go back to Liyue Harbor and get the fireworks ready, then meet me in Qingce Village.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 12 keqing 11.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Traveler, come with me. Let's ask around to see what happened.
----
;(Approach Granny Ruoxin in Qingce Village)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 13 grannyruoxin 01.ogg}} '''Granny Ruoxin:''' *sigh* How could a whole batch of fireworks just vanish like that?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 13 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Hello, Granny Ruoxin. We'd like to know more about the recent fireworks theft.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 13 grannyruoxin 02.ogg}} '''Granny Ruoxin:''' Ah, Lady Keqing! I can hardly believe you came personally to investigate.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 13 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' It's no trouble at all. Please, tell us what happened.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 13 grannyruoxin 03.ogg}} '''Granny Ruoxin:''' Well, when they brought the fireworks, the children in the village were very excited, they were all gathered around watching the area for a long time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 13 grannyruoxin 04.ogg}} '''Granny Ruoxin:''' The workers piled up the fireworks and said they would go confirm the locations to set them off. That's when they left the village.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 13 grannyruoxin 05.ogg}} '''Granny Ruoxin:''' Now let me remember... Ah yes, I recall that they left the fireworks in an open area, just next to a house down the old road.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 13 grannyruoxin 06.ogg}} '''Granny Ruoxin:''' But, the very next day, all the fireworks were nowhere to be seen. The person in charge of the fireworks was so anxious that they went straight back to the city to find a solution.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 13 grannyruoxin 07.ogg}} '''Granny Ruoxin:''' *sigh* The villagers here are worried too. The fireworks missing can only mean that there are thieves about. There are elderly and kids in the village, you know...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 13 grannyruoxin 08.ogg}} '''Granny Ruoxin:''' Although the Millelith are stationed here, no one dares to go out anymore.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 13 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I understand. Please help reassure the people in the village and tell them everything's going to be fine with the Millelith standing guard.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 13 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Traveler, let's go investigate the place where the fireworks were stolen.

;(Talk to Granny Ruoxin again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj102 grannyruoxin 01.ogg}} '''Granny Ruoxin:''' *sigh* How could such a terrible thing happen during a festival?

;(Approach the fireworks storage)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 15 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This is the place... The fireworks were stolen here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 15 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' The thieves must think there are mostly elderly and children living in Qingce Village, all too weak to defend themselves. Otherwise, they would never dare commit such a blatant crime.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 15 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' This is absolutely awful. We cannot let such a matter go unpunished.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 15 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Let's see if we can find any clues here before we plan our next step.

;(Examining the clue)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 16 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Hmm? Are these footprints?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 16 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Let's see where they lead.

;(Examining subsequent footprints)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 17 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' The footprints continue here. Let's keep following them!

;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 treasurehoardera 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Sir! Please, this is all just a big misunderstanding!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''???:''' A misunderstanding, you say? If so, then tell me, why are you hiding here?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 treasurehoardera 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Please, good sir! This really is just a misunderstanding! I would never dream of getting anywhere near the Feiyun Commerce Guild's shipment!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Something's happening over there. Let's go have a look.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, the Feiyun Commerce Guild? It must be...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Please, save your breath.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 03.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Restrain this fellow! Tightly now, we mustn't let him get away.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 servant 01.ogg}} '''[[Hongxing]]:''' Yes, young master!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I was sure it was an evil spirit... Turns out it's the Treasure Hoarders again.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Xingqiu and Chongyun! Hello!
:{{DIcon}} What are you guys doing here?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 04.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Well, hello, dear Traveler! Our fates cross once again. What brings you here?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Excuse me, please tell me what is happening here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 05.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Ah yes, allow me to explain. It so happens that every year during the Lantern Rite, the Feiyun Commerce Guild transports supplies to various villages outside of Liyue Harbor.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 06.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Family rules stipulate that the supplies must be personally escorted by a family member. Because my older brother went last year, the duties have fallen to me this time around.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so what's Chongyun doing here?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 07.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Chongyun happened to be visiting, so I cordially invited him to join us for the journey.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, I see. But why did Chongyun say he thought there was an evil spirit?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 08.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' I see that you are not familiar with the story of old. It is said that fireworks were once called firecrackers, and were used to ward off evil spirits and the like.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 09.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' In ancient times, Liyue was plagued by evil spirits. As people gathered together to celebrate the annual festival, the yang energy would intensify, and evil spirits were thus attracted to the fringes of the city by the strong scent.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 10.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Liyue Harbor was under the gracious protection of Rex Lapis, so the spirits dared not enter the city. However, they still lingered near the city gates and pestered the passersby.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 11.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' In order to drive the spirits away, people made firecrackers and lit them near the city gates. The flashes of light and loud noise successfully drove the spirits whence they came.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 12.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' This festival is now known as the Lantern Rite. It was my intention to travel around to see if there are any malicious spirits lying in wait for passersby.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 13.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Since I happened to have a shipment of goods to deliver and our course was through the mountains, I naturally thought it best to have my thaumaturge friend traveling alongside me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Xingqiu said he learned the story about evil spirits from an ancient text.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' The text vividly describes the appearance and even the whereabouts of the spirits.
:{{DIcon}} (Xingqiu must be leading Chongyun along.)
:{{DIcon}} (Chongyun never got to see the book, did he?)
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 14.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Anyway, when we arrived at the area, Chongyun sensed an ambush about to take place.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 15.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Upon searching the area, we found a group of Treasure Hoarders. They tried to flee the moment we were upon them.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 16.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Fortunately, I was swift enough to catch one of them. Your timing couldn't have been more fortunate, we were just preparing to send them to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 17.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' He insists the matter is merely a misunderstanding. But things seem quite clear as I see it...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 treasurehoardera 03.ogg}} '''[[Kangsheng]]:''' Good sir, just hear me out! Everyone knows the Feiyun Commerce Guild. Had we known it was your merchant caravan, we never would have dared to attack!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 treasurehoardera 04.ogg}} '''Kangsheng:''' The master of the Feiyun Commerce Guild is famous for his generosity and noble deeds. A true hero of the people...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 treasurehoardera 05.ogg}} '''Kangsheng:''' So, you see, this is nothing but a big misunderstanding! W&mdash;We didn't want any trouble with the guild!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' What you mean to say is that you were targeting someone else, then. Well, who was it?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 treasurehoardera 06.ogg}} '''Kangsheng:''' I... uh, well... Just trust me, we were definitely not trying to steal your goods, please... please believe me!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Master Xingqiu, I would like to borrow a few of your staff to escort the thief to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. As for the bounty, we will pay you afterward.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 18.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' It is my humble duty to uphold justice. No remuneration shall be necessary.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 19.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Come then, see that this thief to taken to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 servant 02.ogg}} '''Hongxing:''' Yes, young master, leave it to us! You heard him, take this man over there and make sure he is secured. Tie each of his fingers separately if you have to, he's not gonna pull anything under our watch.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Wait a second.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Please also deliver this message to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' It's very likely that this thief is related to the recent fireworks theft in Qingce Village. Make sure they have someone question him thoroughly.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 20.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Haha, so the plot thickens.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 21.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Is your task clear? We mustn't disappoint the Yuheng.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 servant 03.ogg}} '''Hongxing:''' Yes, young master, I understand. We'll be on our way!

:'''The guards take the Treasure Hoarder away...'''

:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 08.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I've heard many good things about you, Master Xingqiu. Thank you for your assistance.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 22.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' I hardly lifted a finger. Think nothing of it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Everyone, my intuition tells me that there could be more than one group of Treasure Hoarders in this area.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 09.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' More than one group?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 23.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Oh! You've got quite a keen eye, too, Chongyun!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 chongyun 05.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' During our search, I found scattered sets of footprints differing from those on the road. There may still be other Treasure Hoarders waiting to ambush passersby.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 chongyun 06.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' When I was chasing the Treasure Hoarders earlier, I noticed that they were nearly unarmed and very few in numbers. If they truly intended to ambush the Feiyun Commerce Guild, they must've overestimated themselves.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 chongyun 07.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' If you ask me, they didn't seem to be staging an ambush, but rather, it appeared as if they were waiting for someone.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 10.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' It appears they may be the thief's accomplices. They were probably hiding here to wait for the stolen goods.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 24.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' What exactly are the stolen goods, if I may ask?

:'''Keqing tells them about the fireworks theft in Qingce Village...'''

:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 25.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Taking advantage of the elderly and children, what a loathsome group of criminals.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 26.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Lady Keqing, don't fret about manpower. Chongyun, let's go lend them a hand in Qingce Village, shall we?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 chongyun 08.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Yeah, just leave it to us! We can handle a bunch of thieves.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 11.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Thank you, that will help alleviate the crisis in Qingce Village. Unfortunately, the footprints we were following end here. I don't know where we should go next.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 12.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' It seems we were only a moment away from catching all the Treasure Hoarders...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Keqing...
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry.
:{{DIcon}} We'll find a way to catch them.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 13.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Thank you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 14.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Master Xingqiu, I'll leave Qingce Village under your watch.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 xingqiu 27.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Most assuredly, Lady Keqing.

:'''Chongyun and Xingqiu leave for Qingce Village.'''

:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 15.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Phew, it's fortunate our paths crossed with those two.
:{{DIcon}} It's always good to have some help.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's so cool to fight for justice!
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 16.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' The thieves who stole the fireworks haven't revealed themselves yet.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 17.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I'll go have a look around. Traveler, please go take a rest in Qingce Village.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 18.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I've troubled you enough already. I can handle the rest of this matter myself.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, Keqing... Are you planning to look for clues all by yourself? Somehow, that doesn't sound like a very good idea.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, wait! You're in the Liyue Qixing! Why don't you ask some of your subordinates to help?
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' At least it'll be safer than investigating on your own.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon's right.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 19.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Yes, I agree, but we are short-handed at the moment. I can handle these trivial matters myself.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 20.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' The fireworks that were transported to Qingce Village were quite bulky. They couldn't have gone far.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 21.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Way I see it, if they were clever enough, they would conceal the stolen goods somewhere and then come pick them up later.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 22.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' All I have to do is find out where they hid the fireworks, and then return to the location with reinforcements.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 23.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Don't worry, I am not reckless, and I won't carelessly alert the thieves. You can certainly trust me by now.
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, when you put it that way...
:{{A|vo eqhdj102 18 keqing 24.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' It's settled, then. Traveler and Paimon, please go get some rest. I'll go find you in Qingce Village when I'm done.

===Baizhu and Qiqi===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Baizhu or Qiqi in front of the house north of the Teleport Waypoint in Qingce Village)
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 8 qiqi 01.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Baizhu. I want to go on the roof. To watch the fireworks.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 8 qiqi 02.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' It's high up there. I don't wanna disturb the Finches down on the ground.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 8 baizhu 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Don't worry, Qiqi, Finches just fly away as a precaution whenever they hear footsteps approaching. It's not because they're scared.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 8 baizhu 02.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' We can't stay here for too long, I'm afraid. We still have patients to visit...
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 8 qiqi 03.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Hmm... Okay. Patients are more important. Don't mind Qiqi.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 8 baizhu 03.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' The busy period will die down after the festival ends, and then, I'll take you wherever you want to go &mdash; promise. Okay, Qiqi?
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 8 qiqi 04.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' Let me write that down. In my notebook.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 8 baizhu 04.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Alright, here's your pen...

===Ganyu===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Ganyu near the Teleport Waypoint at Mt. Aocang)
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 7 ganyu 01.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Happy Lantern Rite, (Traveler). How have you been recently?
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 7 ganyu 02.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' I hope everything's going well for you. Don't be like me, worrying all the time...
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 7 ganyu 03.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Oh, uh... it's nothing though, just... as you can see, there's a lot going on during the Lantern Rite, and I was originally supposed to head back to Yujing Terrace to assist with the preparations...
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 7 ganyu 04.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' However, Lady Ningguang urged me to take a proper vacation. She said that there's nothing so urgent that it can't wait, and that this festival is a time to reconnect with friends and family...
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 7 ganyu 05.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' But if I really spent this vacation with Cloud Retainer, it wouldn't be long before she started asking me "How has your career developed this year?" "Any new crushes one should know about?"...
:{{DIcon}} Oof, I can imagine...
::{{A|vo eqhdj talk 7 ganyu 06a.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Yes... I can handle overtime, but not that...
:{{DIcon}} Seriously though... Got a crush on anyone at the moment?
::{{A|vo eqhdj talk 7 ganyu 06b.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' What the&mdash; Don't you start that as well!
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 7 ganyu 07.ogg}} '''Ganyu:''' Besides that... I do feel better getting some of this off my chest. So... thank you for being here and listening to me.

===Shenhe===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Shenhe next to [[Jiangzhou]] on the docks in Liyue Harbor)
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 11 shenhe 01.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Liyue Harbor by night is even brighter than Mt. Aocang by day.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 11 shenhe 02.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' I couldn't get used to this view at first. But I'm told this is how it always looks at the Lantern Rite. I guess everyone likes brightly lit places, because every time you mention Lantern Rite, people can't help but smile.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 11 shenhe 03.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Like this, look.
:{{DIcon}} Yes, that's the Lantern Rite smile.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 11 shenhe 04.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Will you be staying here for good now, (Traveler)?
:{{DIcon}} Just for the festival.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 11 shenhe 05.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' ...Oh, I see.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 11 shenhe 06.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' Well... it's nice to see you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 11 shenhe 07.ogg}} '''Shenhe:''' If Lantern Rite could continue indefinitely... that would be even better.

: {{A|Vo eqhdj talk 9 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' You're here.
: {{A|Vo eqhdj talk 9 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I'm guessing this Lantern Rite is the same as every year.
: {{A|Vo eqhdj talk 9 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' The demons have retreated and the humans are safe and well. If Pervases knew... it would be a lifelong wish come true for him.
:{{DIcon}} Xiao...
: {{A|Vo eqhdj talk 9 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I trust you're not here to invite me to watch the fireworks in the city?
:{{DIcon}} Guilty as charged.
: {{A|Vo eqhdj talk 9 xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I think I'll be fine right here.
: {{A|Vo eqhdj talk 9 xiao 07.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' As long as the fireworks fly high enough, you can see them from wherever you are. Besides, if anyone wishes to see me, I know they'll come and find me.
: {{A|Vo eqhdj talk 9 xiao 08.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' So whether I'm here or in the city... it makes no difference.

:{{DIcon}} Do you have time off for the festival?
:{{DIcon}} Are you off work today?
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 6 yanfei 02.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Yep! I got a letter from my dad &mdash; he said all is well with him and mom on their travels, and wished me and Granny a Happy Lantern Rite.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 6 yanfei 03.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' So typical of my dad. He wrote the exact same thing last year &mdash; it's like his go-to Lantern Rite greeting!
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 6 yanfei 04.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' But hey, I guess he doesn't overthink these things, and that's where I get my carefree side from, too. Look at me, I've taken a few days vacation just so I can enjoy the view.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 6 yanfei 05.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Oh, this reminds me &mdash; I should mention you when I write back! When you meet interesting new people, you've gotta share it with your family.
