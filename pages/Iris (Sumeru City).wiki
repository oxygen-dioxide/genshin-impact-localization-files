'''Iris''' is an [[NPC]] located in [[Sumeru City]], [[Sumeru]] who comes from a lineage of scholars. She and her younger sister [[Hawa]] are both researching material related to the [[Scarlet King]], while their father is away on an expedition in the desert.

During daytime, she can be found at [[Puspa Café]], sitting across from [[Nayab]]. During nighttime, she can be found inside [[The Akademiya]], discussing the Scarlet King's ancient runes with Hawa.

Following a certain daytime dialogue branch for the first time gives the player one [[Guide to Ingenuity]].

==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Iris:''' I'll think about my research topic before [[Nayab]] finds a new counter card.
:{{DIcon}} About your research topic...
::'''Iris:''' I come from a family of academics. Everyone has either worked at the [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]] or continued their studies there. So, research has become an essential part of my life.
::'''Iris:''' I'm from [[Vahumana]], and am currently conducting research on the history of the desert and [[Scarlet King|King Deshret]].
::'''Iris:''' One of my younger sisters also happens to be researching the semantics of the ancient King Deshret runes, so occasionally we'll discuss our findings together.
::'''Iris:''' But she has to instruct new students during the day, so we can only talk at night.
:{{DIcon}} About that countermeasure card...
::'''Iris:''' Well, you know the popular card game "[[Genius Invokation TCG]]"? It was invented in Sumeru and then spread throughout Teyvat via [[Inazuma]].
::'''Iris:''' I'd only heard about this game before, but never tried it. Then one day, I came here to have a coffee and [[Nayab]] invited me to play a round.
::'''Iris:''' I was scared out of my wits at first. I thought I'd inadvertently let slip some forbidden knowledge about the King Deshret and that the [[matra]] had found me.
::'''Iris:''' But it was fine in the end. After this matra came over, it was just a few bizarre deck questions from there.
::'''Iris:''' That isn't the sort of thing I'm good at. I just ask the questions. As for the solutions, I let him work them out for himself.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} It's pretty hard.
::'''Iris:''' Tell me about it. By the time he comes up with a solution, my sisters and I might have already finished our researchers.
::'''Iris:''' However, doing research is similar to playing cards. You need to think out of the box to make a breakthrough.
:;(Obtain [[Guide to Ingenuity]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Iris:''' See you later. I'm going to order another cup of coffee and think over the problem.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Iris:''' Are you sure you've found the correct semantic field for these ancient runes?
:'''Hawa:''' Of course I'm not sure. I'm only speculating.
:'''Hawa:''' Besides, I discovered that there are overlapping marks on the ancient runes on this stone wall.
:'''Hawa:''' So, I have reason to suspect that they may have been carved by people over several generations.
:'''Iris:''' Well, that complicates things... In my history researches, the meanings of runes like these can differ significantly from era to era.
:'''Iris:''' When will Father finish his desert expedition again? We should ask him what he thinks when he gets back.
:'''Iris:''' Or ask [[Rifaet]]. Maybe he has some leads.
