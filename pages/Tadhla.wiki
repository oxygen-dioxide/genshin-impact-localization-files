'''Tadhla''' was a quest-exclusive NPC in the [[Tanit Camps]] and was a member of the [[Tanit]] tribe.

==Profile==
Tadhla was the daughter of [[Masseira]], trained to become a Falcon of the tribe. After the [[Traveler]] was welcomed as a guest, Masseira asked them to help find Tadhla. The Traveler found Tadhla in a [[Fatui]] camp, having been ambushed by them and caught in the process. Driving the Fatui away, Masseira was disappointed in her inability to focus as a Falcon, but nonetheless continued with her coming-of-age ceremony.

The next day, Masseira asked the Traveler to accompany Tadhla on her hunt, which consisted of the three [[Consecrated Beast]]s &mdash; a [[Consecrated Red Vulture|Red Vulture]], [[Consecrated Scorpion|Scorpion]] and [[Consecrated Flying Serpent|Flying Serpent]]. While hunting the scorpion, Tadhla and the Traveler were caught off guard by a second scorpion which injured her, forcing the Traveler to tackle the Flying Serpent alone. After preparing the items, they returned to Masseira, who then gave her the next hunt &mdash; the Traveler themselves.

Tadhla confronted the Traveler at the ruins of [[Gurabad]], where she fought them as a Falcon as they were to see them as potential prey. The Traveler fought back in self-defense, defeating her, upon which she asked them not to forget her. [[Liloupar]] interpreted her final words as her choice of no longer living as a Falcon, but a friend instead. They picked up her [[Tadhla's Feather|feather]], implying that she had died after the fight.

===Appearance===
<!--Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 2 paragraphs with 3-4 sentences each.-->

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After finishing the quest [[The Falcon's Hunt]], near Masseira's hut)
:'''Tadhla:''' (Tadhla avoids eye contact and lowers her head nervously).
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
::'''Tadhla:''' Sorry, the hunt is over. I am Father's "Falcon."
::'''Tadhla:''' But I'm feeling great. Don't worry about me.
::;(Proceed to next dialogue set)
:{{DIcon}} About your relationship with Masseira...
::'''Tadhla:''' As I said, he is my father, and I am his Falcon. I follow his orders. I hunt for him, risk my life for him, as he is the will of the Tanit.
::'''Tadhla:''' When the day comes that I cannot fully execute my Father's orders, then my life as a Falcon will end.
::;(Proceed to next dialogue set)

;(Continue from previous dialogue set)
:{{DIcon}} That's pretty extreme...
::'''Tadhla:''' Extreme, huh? I'm not sure about that. I've always lived like this ever since I was a child.
:{{DIcon}} Haven't you ever thought about living for yourself?
::'''Tadhla:''' ...
::'''Tadhla:''' No. Never. I never had such thoughts, or expectations.
::'''Tadhla:''' The desert is a place of indifference and brutality, where I have no time to think for my own good. Without me, my tribe lives on just the same. However, without my tribe, there is no way I will survive.
:'''Tadhla:''' Well... But, the stories of you and Paimon, and the adventures that you two experienced...
:'''Tadhla:''' Should there be a chance, I would really want to hear more of them.
:'''Paimon:''' No problem! We have tons of stories to tell!
:{{DIcon}} Yes, I'll tell you all of them.
:{{DIcon}} We can talk about them any time you want.
:'''Tadhla:''' Pfft...
:'''Tadhla:''' Ahem, sorry. I'm just very happy. Thank you, the Master of the Jinni. Um, I mean, thank you, {{Traveler}}.
