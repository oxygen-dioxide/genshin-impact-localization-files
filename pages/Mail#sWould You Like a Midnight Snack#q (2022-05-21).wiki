|text    = After today's performance, I can't help but feel the emptiness in my heart and the desire to meet friends. If you are free, let's meet later at [[Chihu Rock]]. I'll show you around the night bazaar and we can try some midnight snacks. How does that sound?

When it comes to midnight snacks, the barbecue and drinks combo will be absolutely satisfying. They're not the healthiest things to eat, but since it's my birthday, the elders in the troupe will cut me some slack tonight. Indulging like this once a year makes me happy.

This time, I would also like to invite you to try a local delicacy of Liyue: Pop's Tea! You don't have to down it in one gulp if you find it too strong and bitter. Just think of it as a new experience.

See you then.
