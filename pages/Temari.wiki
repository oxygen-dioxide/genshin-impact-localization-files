{{Lang|'''Temari'''|ja=手まり|ja_rm=Temari}} is a mini-game challenge playable by interacting with [[Kid Kujirai]] throughout his various locations scattered around Inazuma. It is a simple game which consists of a ''temari'', a decorated ball, which is hidden somewhere in the area, and the player must find the Temari before the time limit is up.

To unlock Temari in [[Co-Op Mode]] in a location, the Traveler must first complete [[Temaria Game]], and then successfully complete three Temari challenges by Kid Kujirai at said location. After this, the Traveler can play custom games of Temari at that location by interacting with the Temari. ''(See [[#Co-Op Tutorial|Co-Op Tutorial]].)''
