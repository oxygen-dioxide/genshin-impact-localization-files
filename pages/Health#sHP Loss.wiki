'''HP Loss''' refers to when a fixed amount of [[HP]] is removed from a character or enemy. HP Loss ignores [[DEF]], [[RES]], [[Damage Reduction]], or [[Shields]].

HP Loss is not [[Damage]], and therefore cannot trigger passive effects that require taking damage, such as [[Serpent Spine]]'s stack loss.
