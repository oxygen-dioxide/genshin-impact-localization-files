{{Description|He has just signed the contract to end all contracts. His stories are told all throughout this vast land.<br />Be that as it may, all shall be erased by the passage of time &mdash; and that is why a record must be left behind.<br />But even the firmest bedrock does not last forever.<br />And so, a medium more reliable than bedrock, deities, or anything else in this world must be found to store the legacy of [[Rex Lapis]]. That medium is you &mdash; the [[Traveler]] who traverses countless worlds.}}
