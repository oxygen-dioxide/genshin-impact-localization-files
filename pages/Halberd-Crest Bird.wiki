|description = A medium-sized bird that can be found in Natlan. Its huge crest looks like the blade of a halberd, and is an excellent deterrent. Even the fiercest of monsters think twice before trying to hunt them...<br>It is said that the crests of adult Halberd-Crest Birds are as heavy as a one-handed sword, and their bones are quite sturdy. This even allows their crests to penetrate thin, light shields when they charge at full speed. Some warriors of the Collective of Plenty have taken note of this, and specifically seek out wild Halberd-Crest Birds to see "whose head is harder," attempting to temper their own bodies through such competitions until they become as strong as steel...
