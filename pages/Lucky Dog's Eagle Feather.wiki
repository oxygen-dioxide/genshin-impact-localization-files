{{Description|A monster once cornered an adventurer, but was then picked off by a hunting eagle... That eagle dropped this feather, which now carries some of the adventurer's good luck.}}
'''Lucky Dog's Eagle Feather''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Lucky Dog]].

==Description==
When fortune has your back, even the most ferocious monster has to yield.<br />Strolling in the forest, the boy known as Lucky Dog had no idea that a monster was lurking nearby, having singled him out as its prey.<br />The boy became distracted by some colorful mushrooms, and the monster pounced. He leaped out and landed on the poisonous mushrooms, stomping them flat.<br />This was going to be an easy hunt, the monster thought — until a feather from the eagle circling above fell quietly onto its back.
