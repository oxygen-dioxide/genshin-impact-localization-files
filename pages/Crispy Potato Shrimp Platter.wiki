|desc_basic      = A spread made from potatoes and berries is placed onto crispy potato slices, and a whole shrimp is then added on top. The fragrant and full-bodied flavors serve to whet the appetite, while the addition of Mint adds a whole other dimension to the mix.
|desc_delicious  = The moment this enters your mouth, the springiness of the shrimp and the crispiness of the potato slices form a profound contrast. The fluffy potatoes immediately follow up by melding these flavors together, creating a sweet experience that makes you relax, body and soul.
