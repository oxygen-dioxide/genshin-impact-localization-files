'''Viaghara''' lived in the times of [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]], the previous [[Dendro]] Archon of [[Sumeru]].

==Story==
Greater Lord Rukkhadevata summoned the spirit [[Varuna]] in a section of the desert<ref name="ZH Sun and Rain" group="Note">The Chinese description for [[The Coordinates of Sun and Rain]] details: {{zh|依照传说，司草木的女神在沙漠的一角唤出能召来甘霖的精灵，名之曰「法留纳」亦即「水天」。|tl=According to legend, the goddess who controlled plants summoned, in a part of the desert, a spirit of sweet rains, whose name was Varuna, or 'Water-Sky.'}}</ref> and used "hedges and streams" to protect a certain secret related to "sun and rain." After the forest labyrinth was created, the lord of the forest Viaghara was born from the moon's reflection on the water, resembling a tiger in shape.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Laurel Coronet}}</ref><ref name="ZH Sun and Rain" group="Note" />

Viaghara blessed "[[Aranara|the seeds of pomegranate]]" under the first [[Vasara Tree]], and made a pact with the divine, to share the labyrinth with them, and to command the birds and beasts not to harm them. After "the flowing water was once corrupted," Viaghara died protecting the nurseries of life and "melted into the forest." As [[A Time of Insight]] says: "Their claws would become metal and wood, and their stripes would become an endless maze, And their smoldering eyes would become the moon in both the sky and the water."
