==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Kokomi's hair is styled in a high ponytail that divides itself in two at the top. Her hair is accessorized with an indigo ornament that resembles fins, each side curving around the top of her ponytail.

Her attire consists of an off-the-shoulder navy-blue kimono-like coat with paler blue swirling accents that resemble waves at the bottom of her ''tamoto'' sleeves. She wears a low cut white-lilac bodysuit under her coat ending with shorts with a scalloped hem. Attached on her chest is a large indigo bow with her {{Hydro}} [[Vision]] mounted at the center alongside two purple ribbons.

Her footwear consists of ''geta'' sandals. Her accessories consist of white-lilac half gloves with scalloped edges and a navy-blue and light lilac choker with turquoise gemstones hanging from the bottom.
