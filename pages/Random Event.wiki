{{stub|Random Event table not automatically generated; missing events}}
'''Random Events''' and randomly occurring World Quests are random encounters that the player can run into while roaming around the world of [[Teyvat]]. Upon completion, the player will gain a random amount of rewards based on region and World Level.{{cite}}

Straying too far from the encounter or failing to interact with it after a certain amount of time{{verify|How much?}} will cause the Random Event or World Quest to disappear.

==Rewards==
The player can gain rewards from Random Events and Random World Quests up to 10 times per day. [[Companionship EXP]] varies based on the area the reward was completed in and is doubled during [[Co-Op Mode]].
* {{Item|Companionship EXP|20|x=10–15}}
* {{Item|Mora|20|x=1055–1936}}<!--WL4:1905-->
* {{Item|Fine Enhancement Ore|20|x=0–2}}<!--WL3?-->
* {{Item|Mystic Enhancement Ore|20|x=0–2}}<!--WL3?-->

==Random Events==
Random Events are denoted by their blue-colored banners on the screen when activated. They will only show up on the mini-map, so keep your eyes peeled!

After factoring in enemy drops, an average of {{Item|Mora|20|x=1600}} can be obtained per random event, which could theoretically net 16,000 Mora each day. <small>(Calculated based on 10 runs.)</small>

Certain World Quests have a chance of randomly occurring while exploring. When activated, a new quest pop-up will appear on the left side of the screen, which players can then navigate to. It will also appear at the bottom of the World Quest list in the Quest menu.

Currently, all Random World Quests are located in Mondstadt or Inazuma.
