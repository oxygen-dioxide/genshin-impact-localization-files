==Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Icicle Spikes:''' Summons icicles that spike from the ground at the player's location, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}}. Also leaves behind a frozen patch of ground that deals '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DoT}} to players that step on it.
*'''Ice Pillars:''' Summons pillars below itself and any nearby Samachurls, [[Hilichurl Shooters]], and [[Abyss Mages]], giving them a higher ground to attack. The pillars also periodically release blasts around it, dealing '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}}. The pillars are considered Cryo Constructs, which can be effectively damaged with {{Pyro}} or [[Blunt Attack|Blunt]] attacks. Defeating the Samachurl will also destroy all its summoned pillars.
*'''Smack:''' If the player is within melee range, swings its staff at the player, dealing '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} and knocking the player back. The Samachurl also falls in the process due to the staff's weight. The Samachurl will not perform this attack while it is on top of a pillar.
