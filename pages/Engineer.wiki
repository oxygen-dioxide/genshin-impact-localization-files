:'''Engineer:''' *panting* You two sure are full of energy. Unfortunately, I don't have time to entertain you...
:{{DIcon}} How did you get so exhausted?
::'''Paimon:''' That panting sounds so realistic! It's Paimon's first time hearing a Water Droplet sound tired. Paimon never realized this is what a worn-out Water Droplet would be like...
::'''Engineer:''' Well, guess it can't be helped. That's what you call an "occupational hazard."
::'''Paimon:''' Technical maintenance? Quite the specialized term to pop out of nowhere...
::{{DIcon}} What does it refer to?
::{{DIcon}} Could you elaborate?
::'''Engineer:''' Oh! It's too complicated. I doubt I'd ever finish, so let me give you a quick rundown instead.
::'''Engineer:''' This broadcasting device before you is something Idyia made for Zosimos. I heard it was made based on some new research out of the Akademiya...
::'''Engineer:''' However, due to some design flaws, it works very well at times, but it often has serious bugs and can be quite troublesome.
::'''Engineer:''' We Hydro Eidolons are incapable of speech, so we rely on prerecorded voice lines to converse with you.
::'''Engineer:''' All the narration used in the show is prerecorded as well. I'm sure you understand why.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, we understand the concept, but all of you still react very naturally! Speaking with you often feels as smooth as speaking to a normal person!
::'''Engineer:''' That's because Idyia did everything she could to find us a lot of audio materials, and she broke apart the recordings so each word could be broadcast and used independently, or in any order.
::'''Engineer:''' Thus, we gained the ability to use this device to form sentences from individual prerecorded words and respond to you.
::'''Engineer:''' Of course, we have prerecorded answers for certain questions.
::'''Engineer:''' "Predict potential questions and prepare answers in advance for a smooth conversation..." That's what Fake Playwright practices in its free time. You could say it is its hobby.
::'''Engineer:''' Fake Playwright felt it would help with its writing, but it later realized that it wasn't the issue, but that's another topic completely.
::'''Paimon:''' Whoa! So some things you say are made on the spot? You must have prepared so many voice lines...
::'''Paimon:''' And if you lack a recording for a certain word, you have to find a way to work around it.
::'''Engineer:''' Indeed, you've discovered the critical issue! This broadcasting device requires too many voice samples, and I'm in charge of maintaining everything.
::'''Engineer:''' And everyone has been developing unique personalities lately, so even more voice line updates are necessary. I simply can't keep up with it all...
::'''Paimon:''' Really? You sound way overworked!
::{{DIcon}} That kind of workload is horrifying.
::{{DIcon}} You deserve a massive raise and a bonus!
::'''Engineer:''' Just this alone isn't too much work for me. The problem is I have to maintain all the other equipment and mechanisms, like the device for the sea monster's minions you saw...
::'''Engineer:''' Just getting to the set of each play takes so much time, and yet I still have to repair everything that broke...
::'''Engineer:''' It's all Zosimos's fault! He's the worst! Just because I showed the tiniest bit of interest in the equipment, he trained me to be the one and only maintenance guy!
::'''Engineer:''' Why couldn't he have gotten a few more Hydro Eidolons? No matter how fond you are of something, you'll get tired of it when you have to do it all day every day.
::'''Paimon:''' C-Calm down, don't be sad! Cheer up!
::'''Paimon:''' Maybe your troupe will recruit other Water Droplets, and once you have more members, they'll be able to take some work off your hands!
::'''Engineer:''' I hope so... but I wonder when we'll be able to find any qualified new members.
::'''Engineer:''' I should go ask Idyia when I get the chance...
:{{DIcon}} Please take some rest!
::'''Engineer:''' I appreciate the concern. I'll take a break once I'm done here... But will there ever come a day when my work is truly done...?
