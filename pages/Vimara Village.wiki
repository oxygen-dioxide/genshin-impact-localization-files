{{Description|There is nothing to Vimara Village apart from a tranquil life. Come, exhausted traveler, rest here awhile.|Viewpoint, [[The Village by the River]]}}

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
*Vimara is possibly derived from the ''{{w|Vimalakirti Sutra}}'', a Buddhist text named after its hero Vimalakirti, whose name means "taintless fame." Vimara is another way to write Vimala.<ref>Google Books: [https://www.google.ca/books/edition/Body_Mind_and_Healing_After_Jung/E2zFBQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=vimarakirti&pg=PT202&printsec=frontcover Body, Mind and Healing After Jung]</ref>
