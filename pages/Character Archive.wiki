The '''Character Archive''' is a [[Game System]] to view all the [[Playable Characters]], except for the [[Traveler]]. It shows the characters the player owns as well as those that have not. It is unlocked after completing the {{Quest|Unexpected Power}}.

==Content==
The [[Wish]] art for characters that have already been obtained can be viewed at the bottom-right of the screen when they are selected. If the character has a [[Character Outfit]], the obtain art of the outfit can be viewed regardless if the character is owned.

Viewing a character's details displays the element, weapon, description, [[Constellation]]s, [[Talent]]s at Level 1, [[Birthday]], and affiliation. The character's [[Character/Gallery|idle animations]] are played.

Characters can be filtered by a single or multiple [[Element]] and [[Weapon]].

Characters can be sorted in ascending or descending order by:
* Default (Release Date, then Quality)
* Characters Owned
* Character [[Quality]] (mislabeled as [[Character Ascensions|Ascension]] Phase)
* Character [[Element]]al Type
* [[Weapon]] Type

==Trivia==
* [[Zhongli]] and [[Xinyan]] were not added to the Character Archive on their release during [[Version 1.1]] but rather during [[Version 1.2]].
* [[Aloy]] does not appear in the Character Archive unless obtained.
