The '''Character Archive''' is a system in the game to view all the Playable [[Characters]], except for [[Traveler|The Traveler]]. It shows the ones the player has obtained as well as those that have not been obtained. It's unlocked at [[Adventure Rank]] 2.

The wish art for characters that have already been obtained can be viewed at the bottom-right of the screen when showing a character that has already been obtained.

[[Characters]] can be filtered individually by their [[Element]] and [[Weapon]].

[[Characters]] can be sorted in ascending or descending order by:
*Default (Release Date, then Rarity)
*Characters Owned
*Character [[Character Ascensions|Ascension]] Phase
*Characters [[Element]]al Type
*[[Weapon]] Type

==Trivia==
*[[Zhongli]] and [[Xinyan]] were not added to the Character Archive on their release but rather during [[Version 1.2]].
* It is only upon obtaining the Archon that the "'''[[Vision]]'''" of that character is replaced by "'''[[Gnosis]]'''" in viewing their details.
