letter to wish you a happy spring!

Although spring has arrived, the weather is still a bit chilly. As the saying goes, "It takes more than one cold day for the river to freeze three feet deep," so I think it'll stay cold for a while longer. Make sure to keep yourself warm when you sleep, especially your belly. Don't catch a cold!

Now that the serious stuff is out of the way, let's talk about going out to play! With the sun shining so brightly today, it's the perfect time for a spring outing! I've made some snacks with fresh fruit and vegetables to enjoy along the way. [[Madame Ping|Master]] says this is called "Biting the Spring," a way to welcome good fortune.

Alright then, see you soon!
