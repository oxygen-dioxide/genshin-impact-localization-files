|description = The ancient [[Sacred Sakura]] stands on the peak of [[Mt. Yougou]], its roots running long and deep into the earth, stretching endlessly.<br />Underneath its shadow, there are people who wholeheartedly wish for blessings, a kitsune who is amused at the floating world, and a god who yearns for transient eternity.<br />Everything in this world changes, people come and go, but the Sacred Sakura blooms brilliantly every year, its petals going where the wind leads.
