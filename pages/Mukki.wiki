==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Mukki:''' Is it time to get some new [[Saurian]] whistles made...?
:{{DIcon}} Saurian whistles?
::'''Mukki:''' A general term for any instruments used to aid in communication between Saurians and humans.
::'''Mukki:''' They're not standardized and entirely depend on the habits of the user and Saurians related to them.
::'''Mukki:''' So long as it can be used for communication and so long as the user calls it a Saurian whistle, then it is one &mdash; doesn't matter if it's a harmonica, a whistle, or any other sound-making device.
::'''Mukki:''' There are always new Saurian whelps being born to the tribe, and I'm just wondering whether or not I should make some ahead of time.
::'''Mukki:''' Or perhaps, we can let the Saurians pick out the sound that they like best once they're older.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Mukki:''' Goodbye.
