==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Michelle:''' Even Barbatos needs his rest...
:'''Michelle:''' Rest is only rest after a day of hard work, otherwise, it's just loafing off.
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror...
:;(After completing [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]])
::'''Michelle:''' Never mind my safety. I just hope that this windmill that my family has protected for generation upon generation will be fine.
::'''Michelle:''' *sigh* The storm created when the dragon attacked previously was far too strong. I wonder if the windmill has taken damage.
::'''Michelle:''' I wanted to climb it to have a look, but the Knights stopped me.
::'''Michelle:''' They said that it was too dangerous because Stormterror could attack again at any moment...

:;(After completing [[A Long Shot]])
::'''Michelle:''' Seeing the windmill safe puts my heart at ease.
::'''Michelle:''' The sound of the windmill spinning in the storm was frightening &mdash; it was as if the wind itself was crying out.
::'''Michelle:''' How wonderful! Thanks to Lord Barbatos' protection, the windmill has returned to normal.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Michelle:''' Hush... I'm receiving the will of Barbatos.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about the windmills.
:::'''Michelle:''' The windmills are instrumental in drawing water for Mondstadt.
:::'''Michelle:''' Our family has worked with windmills for generations. This is why I'm well aware of it.
:::'''Michelle:''' Tired of it? Not at all. I'm always full of energy as long as the wind of Barbatos blows.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about Barbatos.
:::'''Michelle:''' Barbatos is a benevolent and hard-working archon.
:::'''Michelle:''' I'm sure the wind, or Barbatos, would listen to all of your troubles.
:::'''Michelle:''' However, rely on yourself, not Barbatos, on your own tasks.
:::'''Michelle:''' Only you can solve your own troubles, right?
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} Is something troubling you?
::::'''Michelle:''' Yes, actually, but it isn't a serious matter... Well, do you know about Philanemo Mushrooms?
::::'''Michelle:''' These mushrooms just spring up all over the windmill when we're not looking. I've cleaned a portion of it, but there are just too many.
::::'''Michelle:''' I'm racking my brains as to how to go about cleaning at the moment. If you could take a few with you, that would be great.
:::; (Obtain [[Philanemo Mushroom]] ×6)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Michelle:''' Be respectful toward the windmills. Barbatos' wind is all around us.
