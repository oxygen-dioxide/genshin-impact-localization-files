==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Carpe Diem:''' Blink, and your life's gone... Drink, and it smooths the ride...
:'''Carpe Diem:''' *sigh* I can't see a w&mdash; *hic* way out...
:{{DIcon}} You're drunk.
::'''Carpe Diem:''' You... You trying to say I'm some sort of alcoholic? Hahaha&mdash; *hic* &mdash; ah. You're too kind.
::'''Carpe Diem:''' I'm just a good-for-nothing swordsman... Good for nothing except prancing around waving my sword in yer pretty face. Hah! *hic*
::'''Carpe Diem:''' Live by the sword, die by the sword. Kill or be killed. Which is it gonna be today? Only one way to find out! I'd rather take my chances with alcohol poisoning!
:{{DIcon|Reward}} There's... blood on your accessories.
::'''Carpe Diem:''' Blood? ...Ah. If you hadn't mentioned it, I wouldn't have noticed.
::'''Carpe Diem:''' To think that I'd forgotten to take care of that person's possessions...
::'''Carpe Diem:''' ...Well, you can have it. That way, that person and I will have finally settled our grudge.
::'''Carpe Diem:''' Right now, I need nothing more than a flask of muddy wine. Hahaha...
:;(Obtain 2{{star}} [[Berserker's Indigo Feather]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} See you, bye.
::'''Carpe Diem:''' Shhhhh... Don't say that.
::'''Carpe Diem:''' Come this evening, I'll have to get back to fighting to survive... *hic*
::'''Carpe Diem:''' So tomorrow, there might not be much of me left to see. Hah! Hahaha...

==Trivia==
* His name, based on the phrase "''Carpe Diem''," is a Latin phrase meaning "[https://www.dictionary.com/browse/carpe-diem seize the day]." The phrase is used to encourage people to live in the present moment rather than worrying about the future.
** This explains his dialogue where he is an alcoholic and living the life of a wandering swordsman, as settling his "grudge" may have settled his original purpose in life.
** Considering his name, it can also be speculated that it is an alias he uses to hide his origin.
