'''Plume of Purifying Light''' is an item that can be found in the [[Girdle of the Sands]], [[Sumeru]]. It can be offered to the [[Amrita Pool]] for rewards.

When a Plume of Purifying Light is within close proximity of a player, the icon {{Icon|Plume of Purifying Light}} will appear on their mini map along with a sound effect, like with elemental [[oculi]]. The player cannot directly interact with the plumes, and must instead use the [[Sorush (Gadget)|Sorush]] gadget. 

36 Plume of Purifying Light can be found throughout the Girdle of the Sands. When the player upgrades the Amrita Pool to the highest level, they will be granted the {{Achievement|Alkanet Amrita}}.

For the rewards and amount needed for each offering level, see [[The Gift of Amrita]].
