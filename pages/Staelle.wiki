:'''Staelle:''' She smiled, her lovely face wet with rain, and she felt herself fortunate indeed.
:'''Staelle:''' For this way, he would not know that she was crying...
:{{DIcon}} What are you talking about?
::'''Staelle:''' Hmm? I'm considering the plot for a novel. The editor's been on my case for two days now &mdash; I shan't be able to delay any longer.
::{{DIcon}} You seem very tired...
::'''Staelle:''' *sigh* The vagaries of writing serial novels...
::'''Staelle:''' I originally took this up as relief from boredom. I never expected the romance novel I wrote to be so popular.
::'''Staelle:''' I was quite naive at the time, signing that serialization contract as I did. And now, I find myself struggling late into the nights over my writing progress...
::'''Staelle:''' *sigh* I'm stopping once I finish this series. I mean, it's not as if I need the Mora...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Staelle:''' "See you later," she said to him...
::'''Staelle:''' Knowing in her heart that this would not likely be the case.
