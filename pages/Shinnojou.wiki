==Profile==
Shinnojou is a guard serving under the [[Hiiragi Clan]], and has feelings for the clan head's daughter, [[Hiiragi Chisato]]. During ''[[Ritou Escape Plan]]'', he was heartbroken upon learning that the person he adores loves [[Kujou Kamaji|someone else]].

===Personality===
Even though he was heartbroken when he learned that Hiiragi Chisato has a lover, he still tries to improve himself to gain the abilities to protect her in the future. He is loyal to his duties and the Kanjou Commission.

===Appearance===
Shinnojou wears a standard uniform modeled from the {{Lang|''ashigaru''|ja=足軽}} of feudal Japan. He wears a purple-gray ''shitagi'', lavender ''kobakama'', white socks, and ''waraji'' sandals. His eggplant-colored armor with pale gold accents consists of ''dou'' (breastplate) with the [[Inazuma Shogunate]]'s crest, ''kote'' (armored sleeves), ''haidate'' (thigh guards), and ''sune-ate'' (greaves). He is also wearing a {{Lang|''jingasa''|ja=陣笠}} with the crest of the Inazuma Shogunate. He is equipped with a ''juumonji yari'' (cross-shaped spear), whose shaft is lavender colored, and contains the Shogunate crest under the spearhead.

==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available after completing [[Ritou Escape Plan]] and before completing [[The Firmiana Leaf Falls]].''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Shinnojou:''' Hello, Traveler! What is your business at the [[Kanjou Commission]] today? Or... are you here to look for [[Hiiragi Chisato|Miss Hiiragi]]?
:{{DIcon}} You seem energetic.
::'''Shinnojou:''' Haha, of course! I live each day seriously, and I'm always looking to improve myself.
::'''Shinnojou:''' When we were escorting the lady previously, I learned that my ability and skills still need a lot of improvement. If I want to protect her, I must further hone them!
::'''Shinnojou:''' N&mdash;Now, don't get the wrong idea. I'm not harboring any illicit thoughts about her. She is not only a lady of nobility, but she already has a lover...
::'''Shinnojou:''' Uhh... A&mdash;Anyway, my greatest goal is to carry out my duty as best as I can, and to that end, I shall do my best for the Kanjou Commission and for Miss Hiiragi.
:{{DIcon}} Do your best.
::'''Shinnojou:''' I will! Goodbye.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing [[The Firmiana Leaf Falls]].''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Shinnojou:''' Hello there, Traveler. We meet again.
:{{DIcon}} You don't look too well.
::'''Shinnojou:''' Come on, how could that be? Don't worry about me, I'm very much fine. Honestly, it's like a weight's been taken off my shoulders.
::'''Shinnojou:''' And our Lady is in exceptional spirits right now. I can rest assured knowing that she's in top shape.
::'''Shinnojou:''' It's just that... Well, never you mind.
::{{DIcon}} It's just that?
::'''Shinnojou:''' Well, you know, this all started when I impulsive charged up to stop her. Now that I think about it, it was so presumptuous of me...
::'''Shinnojou:''' But our Lady really is a gentle soul. She even came to thank me specifically after the dust settled.
::'''Shinnojou:''' *sigh* I no longer have any regrets. It's just... feelings that you spent so much time nursing... They don't go away so easily.
:{{DIcon}} Well, I wish you all the best.
::'''Shinnojou:''' Thank you. I'll get back on my feet as soon as possible.

==Event Dialogue==
===Hues of the Violet Garden===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Shinnojou:''' I flipped through some of my latest diary entries, and page after page is filled to the margins with sadness... You couldn't even tell that I was a positive guy on the up and up before. *sigh* This is no way to motivate oneself.
:'''Shinnojou:''' I wonder, though... Would such tragic developments make for a good novel?
:'''Shinnojou:''' You know, with the pauper lad unable in the end to win the hand of the fair, rich young lady...? Aha, ahaha...
:'''Shinnojou:''' Maybe I might have a shot at getting published if I were to organize my internal journey into a novel...
