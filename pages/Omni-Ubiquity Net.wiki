'''Omni-Ubiquity Net''' is a consumable [[gadget]] that can be purchased from [[Wakamurasaki]] upon completing the world quest [[Omni-Ubiquity Net (Quest)|Omni-Ubiquity Net]].

It allows the user to capture the essence of small animals in the open world and place them in their [[Serenitea Pot]] by converting the player's [[Elemental Skill]] into an event-specific skill. When attempting to use the gadget on animals not marked by a net symbol in the [[Archive]], the player will be prompted with the '''"This target cannot be captured"''' message. If the usage is invalid or the player misses the target, the gadget is not consumed. Up to 99 omni-ubiquity nets can be stored in the [[Inventory]].

{{Description|A net created using [[Mystic Arts in Teyvat#Onmyoudou|onmyoudou]]. It can be used to detain the essences of small animals and also serves as a medium to recreate their forms. There exits a [[Mystic Onmyou Chamber|training ground]] somewhere in Inazuma that uses onmyoudou to recreate monsters and villains. The technique used to make these nets may be the product of those same techniques following many long years of degradation in power and knoweledge.|[[Archive]]}}
