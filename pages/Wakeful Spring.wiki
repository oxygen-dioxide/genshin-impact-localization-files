|description    = A feature-complete open-air hot spring. The minerals present here may not be the equal of [[Aisa Bathhouse]], but hot springs of this kind win in terms of their relaxed, casual atmosphere and the relative lack of regulations. Just a half-hour soak in here and all the fatigue you've accumulated from work will dissipate into nothingness, replaced by a reawakened vigor, and if there's time, you can lean against a nearby white stone and have some tea and a chat with your friends. Of course, please keep some basic etiquette in mind before entering: enjoying the hot spring with friends is fine, but do not stay too long. If you spend too much time in there with chatty folk like the [[Yoimiya|Queen of the Summer Festival]], you might get dizzy.
