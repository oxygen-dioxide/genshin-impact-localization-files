|description    = A feature-complete open-air hot spring. The minerals present her may not be the equal of Aisa Bathhouse, but hot springs of this kind win in terms of their relaxed, casual atmosphere and the relative lack of regulations. Just a half-hour soak in here and all the fatigue you've accumulated from work will dissipate into nothingness, replaced by a reawakened vigor, and if there's time, you can lean against a nearby white stone and have some tea and a chat with your friends. Of course, please keep some basic etiquette in mind before entering: enjoying the hot spring with friends is fine, but do not stay too long. If you spend too much time in there with chatty folk like the Queen of the Summer Festival, you might get dizzy.
