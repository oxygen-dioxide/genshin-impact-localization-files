{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kannek:''' Flower-Feather Clan members aren't all natural poets, are they?
:{{DIcon}} What makes you say that?
::'''Kannek:''' I'm not sure if it's because flying [[Saurian]]s solo is all too lonesome, but all of the riders here are actually fantastic singers.
::'''Kannek:''' The same goes for the letters they write. Sometimes it's hard to tell whether they're song lyrics or a love letter.
::'''Kannek:''' The only letters that aren't confusing are battle reports.
::'''Kannek:''' There are riders patrolling here on the regular. If you see someone flying back from [[Ochkanatlan|Cinder City]], it means I'll be dispatching a letter to the [[Speaker's Chamber]] very shortly.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} This must be some important intel.
:::'''Kannek:''' Indeed. Sometimes, even a simple "all good" can make a big difference.
:::'''Kannek:''' On regular days, the riders would bring back supplies or mementos. Those were, in themselves, things to look forward to.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Withering Purpurbloom|x=5}})
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Kannek:''' Bye. Let me know if you need anything.
