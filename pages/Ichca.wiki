==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ichca:''' Hello, friend! Any plans to travel somewhere a bit "cooler" in the near future?
:{{DIcon}} What's this question about, exactly?
::'''Ichca:''' For argument's sake, let's just assume you do want the thrill of a chill. In which case, you can't set out without something warm to wear, can you?
::'''Ichca:''' You wouldn't be interested in trying out some [[Alpaca]] wool products, would you? They're finer, softer, and warmer than sheep wool!
::{{DIcon}} Sounds like a hard sell here in Natlan.
::'''Ichca:''' Uhh... Umm... Well...
::'''Ichca:''' I&mdash;I wouldn't say it's "impossible" to sell. It's just, uh... a niche market. Sorta.
::'''Ichca:''' Normally, the Masters of the Night-Wind only use that wool for making blankets.
::'''Ichca:''' But Alpacas themselves can be used in many ways. They can be ridden for transport and they also make great farming assistants.
::{{DIcon}} Doesn't sound like you'd be in a hurry to sell them, then.
::'''Ichca:''' No, wait a moment. This has nothing to do with being in a hurry.
::'''Ichca:''' As a farmer raising Alpacas, isn't it perfectly natural that I'd want to show the world how great and versatile they are?
::'''Ichca:''' Wouldn't it just be a tragedy if there were people out there, freezing their socks off in a world of ice and snow, yet who have never experienced the immeasurable bliss in clothing form that is their wool?
::'''Ichca:''' So, my friend, if you run into anyone in need of some warm clothes, please be sure you put in a good word for Alpaca wool!
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps.
::'''Ichca:''' Come on, don't just brush me off...
