==Summary==
;In the Depths, an Unexpected Reunion

The [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] accept a commission from [[Yuehui]], a miner, regarding strange [[hilichurl]] activity in [[The Chasm (Subregion)|The Chasm]]. Believing the [[Abyss Order]] is involved, the two venture into the depths of the [[The Chasm: Underground Mines|underground mines]] and discover an [[Inverted City]] which reminds them of the [[Defiled Statue]]. Just then, Dainsleif appears from a portal behind them, having pursued an [[Abyss Herald]] through its portal only to be separated from it. When Dainsleif chased the [[Traveler's Sibling]] into a portal the last time they saw each other, the same thing happened to him then.

This prompts the Traveler to ask about his background, which their sibling alluded to during their last confrontation, as well as the relationship between the two. Dainsleif tells them that "Twilight Sword" was his title as captain of [[Khaenri'ah]]'s Royal Guard five hundred years ago; the Sibling, meanwhile, was his traveling companion in their search for their fates, but they "did not make it to the journey's end together." He quickly changes the subject back to the Abyss Order, which he suspects has plans for the area, and the trio move further in to investigate.
----
;The Grave of the Guarded
The investigation leads Dainsleif to suspect that the hilichurls have come to The Chasm to live out the end of their lives, sensing that this area mitigates the curse of immortality placed on Khaenri'ahns during the [[cataclysm]], although he is unsure of the principles at work. They are interrupted by two attacking [[Black Serpent Knights]], who were Dainsleif's subordinates before they succumbed to the curse and lost their minds. However, one Knight does not attack them, instead staring at Dainsleif before retreating. The group ponders whether it recognized Dainsleif, a feat he believed was impossible without "it."

After reaching the Inverted City, Dainsleif believes that the city likely belonged to a civilization older than Khaenri'ah. They defeat some Black Serpent Knights and discover they were protecting a group of hilichurls at the end of their lives, confirming Dainsleif's earlier suspicions. Before the Black Serpent Knight reinforcements can attack, the Knight from earlier stops them and silently orders them to retreat. Dainsleif believes the Knight must be [[Halfdan]], a Royal Guard elite during the cataclysm whom he ordered to "inform all Black Serpent Knights to protect the people of Khaenri'ah at all costs." Ever since then, despite the curse eroding their minds, these knights have been trying to fulfill their last orders.

No longer impeded by the Black Serpent Knights, the group climbs to the summit and find a water pool, a relic of the ancient civilization and the source of the area's ability to weaken the curse. Before they can investigate the strange devices located around it, Halfdan then arrives and urges them to follow him.
----
;Memories of Inteyvat

The three end up in a hilichurl camp, where the Traveler finds an [[Inteyvat]], the Khaenri'ah national flower. Upon touching it, they have a vision of their Sibling and an Abyss Herald discussing their plan to amplify the water pool's special properties, remove the curse from the gathered hilichurls, and restore "the homeland." Due to the reality-changing nature of the curse, Dainsleif deems this a futile effort and tells the Traveler that it will only bring the hilichurls even more suffering. The Traveler decides to help him stop their Sibling's plan, believing that their Sibling has no right to subject others to near-guaranteed suffering for an infinitesimally small chance of redemption.

As they leave the settlement, the Abyss Order puts their plan into motion. After vanquishing the Abyss Herald attempting to delay them, the group rushes back to destroy the device.
----
;The Black Serpent Knights' Glory

Just as they enter the chamber, an [[Abyss Lector: Violet Lightning|Abyss Lector]] activates the amplification device, causing all those affected by the curse to experience agonizing pain. Halfdan sacrifices himself to temporarily stop the device, buying the Traveler enough time to defeat the Lector and destroy the mechanisms powering the device. In the wake of Halfdan's death, the distraught party turns to leave when Halfdan's soul appears before them, briefly conversing with Dainsleif before passing on. Dainsleif leaves to recuperate from the device's effects and to investigate the Abyss Order's [[Loom of Fate]] project, while the Traveler and Paimon report back to Yuehui.
