==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Someone seems interested in creating a Gift Envelope...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Mika)
:'''Mika:''' Huh, this doesn't seem right, either... These gift envelopes are really hard to make.
:{{DIcon}} Mika, are you making gift envelopes?
:'''Mika:''' {{Traveler}}! What a coincidence! I wasn't expecting to see you here.
:{{DIcon}} Are you here to celebrate [[Lantern Rite Festival|Lantern Rite]]?
:'''Mika:''' Oh, no, no. I came to deliver a letter, and it just so happened to be during Lantern Rite.
:'''Mika:''' [[Klee]] said she really wanted a Lantern Rite gift envelope, so I thought about buying one to take back.
:'''Mika:''' Imagine my surprise when I found out you have to make them yourself...
:'''Mika:''' I spent a long time trying to make one, but it still feels "off" for some reason. I can't tell where I went wrong...
:'''Mika:''' {{Traveler}}, you know more about Liyue customs than me... Could you give me some advice on how to improve it?
:{{DIcon|Greeting Card}} Hmm, let me think about it for a second...
----
;(Enter the editing screen)
:'''Mika:''' It'd be great if we could add a bit of color... Hmm, maybe an {{Color|help|orange}} or {{Color|help|yellow}} theme would work well?

;(Choosing a correct Motif will result in one of these following dialogues)
:'''Mika:''' This color works great!
:'''Mika:''' It looks really nice.

;(Attempt to submit without meeting the conditions)
:'''Mika:'''  Hmm... Perhaps {{Color|help|orange}} or {{Color|help|yellow}} would be better.

;(After three correct Motifs are used)
:'''Mika:''' This gift envelope is lovely! Thank you. I'd never have managed to make one like this myself...
----
;(After completing the Gift Envelope)
:'''Mika:''' Whoa, it's beautiful! So well made, and you did it so fast... You're amazing, {{Traveler}}!
:'''Mika:''' ...Oh no! I should really get going! I need to report back to the [[Knights of Favonius|Knights]]!
:'''Mika:''' Thanks for the help, {{Traveler}}! I'm sure Klee will love the envelope.
