The '''Iridescence Tour''' is an international music tour in [[Teyvat]] involving all seven nations. It was begun in [[Fontaine]]. [[Xinyan]] was meant to attend it in [[Inazuma]], but it was cancelled suddenly.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Tricky Situation}}</ref> The organizers planned the show again, but this too ended up being cancelled, much to Xinyan's disappointment.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Golden Apple Vacation Returns! (Quest)}}</ref>

Back in [[Liyue]], Xinyan bumps into [[Dvorak]] during the [[Lantern Rite Festival]]. Dvorak had been visiting for personal reasons, but Xinyan convinces him to consider holding the Iridescence Tour there and then, even if it had been put off numerous times. With the help of [[Ganyu]], the [[Liyue Qixing]], and several others, the Iridescence Tour: Lantern Rite Grand Concert was held. Xinyan and [[Hu Tao]] performed the opening act.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Thousand Miles for an Enigmatic Tune}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Single Harmony for an Irreplaceable Soul}}</ref>
