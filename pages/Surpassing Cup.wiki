{{Description|An intricately-made cup. Its appearance betrays nothing of its age to an observer.}}
'''Surpassing Cup''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Pale Flame]].

==Description==
He was born with a face fairer than any other,<br />Destined to a long life and a hollow will.

He was a transcendent being, divinely created, but he was cast aside like worthless dross.<br />Yet, due to an error that cannot be known, he roused himself from slumber,<br />And began to wander the mortal realm.

Before the Fatui found him, he had drifted for countless years<br />And in that time, this is what his experience had taught him:

"I am a 'human' who surpasses all others."<br />"Even the gods daren't meddle in my fate."<br />"Neither mortal nor god, nor fate itself, is qualified to be my judge."<br />"I am free to choose how I wish to spend the remainder of my days."

"Since these mask-wearing people are so fun to be around..."<br />"I think I'll become one of them."
