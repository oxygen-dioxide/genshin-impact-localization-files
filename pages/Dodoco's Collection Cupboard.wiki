Some of them are enhanced for [[fish]]-blasting, some super-heavy 'blasting charges' can burrow into the ground and blow rocks up, and we've got airburst ones for bad guys who are way high up!"<br />"But [[Klee]] usually just uses the most convenient ones. The rest are just kept as souvenirs."<br />"Can you tell the difference between them, [[Paimon]]?"<br />...<br />Listening to Klee's words and looking at the Sparks 'n' Splashes stored in the exhibition cabinet, Paimon lapsed into a deep silence.
