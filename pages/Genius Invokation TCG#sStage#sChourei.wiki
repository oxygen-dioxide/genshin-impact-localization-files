{{Description|Certified player Chourei, a member of the Maison Gardiennage stationed at Lumidouce Harbor, who is in charge of keeping order there &mdash; a task that her gentler personality sometimes makes tricky. Fortunately, after being told as much by the port master, she found that Genius Invokation TCG was a good (and universally reliable, in her experience!) way to get two parties to sit down at a table to talk. Watching all these matches has also helped make her a qualified player herself.|[[Map]] description}}
