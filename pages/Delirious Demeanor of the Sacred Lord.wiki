|description = It was in that era that the [[Xbalanque|first human]] to ascend arose from the throne to enter the [[Sacred Flame]], while the mortal world awaited the arrival of their successor.<br>It was also the era that the mastermind took up the reins of all authority in their stead.<br>Unfortunately, this self-proclaimed [[Sacred Lord]], this usurper who believed that the god he had loved and shed golden tears for should forever remain the one and only &mdash; overstepped his authority. Placing selfish desire above the commandments left by that revered god, he established a [[Ochkanatlan (Civilization)|city]] in which the heavens and the earth were separated from one another.
