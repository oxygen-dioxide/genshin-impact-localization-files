{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Delaroche)
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 delaroche 01.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' That can't be, right? Hmm... But what if they're real after all? No, that can't be... but what if there's a chance?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Greetings, Miss! Is there something that's bothering you?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 delaroche 02.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' Oh? No, it's nothing... I'm Delaroche, the representative of the Fontaine Fishing Association. How can I help you?
:{{DIcon}} We received your commission request.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 delaroche 03.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' Oh, so you're adventurers! Finally, someone has heard my prayers...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon could tell you're really bothered by something! Don't worry, you've got two super-experienced adventurers right here. We'll take care of anything and everything for ya as long as you pay us a little bit of Mora!
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 delaroche 04.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' Ahh, you're exactly the helpers I need! See, the problem is that the fish around a fishing spot at Erinnyes have just all up and vanished recently!
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 delaroche 05.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' They disappeared too quickly for it to have been the work of human anglers. As the representative of the Fishing Association, I had planned to go and investigate the area right away...
:{{DIcon}} But?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 delaroche 06.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' Ahem... Right... But unfortunately, as the representative of the Fishing Association, there are a few other errands that I absolutely have to run, so...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you'd like us to investigate the spot for you?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 delaroche 07.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' Exactly! You're right on the Mora! So I thought I could delegate this work to you... Are you two some kind of prophets, knowing exactly what I was going to say like that? Or maybe like the oracles you read about in fairytales...?
:{{DIcon}} Nope, we already told you that we're adventurers.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, we're just really experienced in this kind of thing, that's all!
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 delaroche 08.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' Haha, well, I'm glad to hear it! I'll get a good night's sleep knowing the two of you are on the case.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But don't we just need to investigate the missing fish? It really doesn't sound too difficult...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 delaroche 09.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' No, you mustn't let your guard down. As the representative of the Fishing Association, I have good reason to believe that the fish have gone missing due to an encounter with the Water Imps...
:{{DIcon}} ...Water Imps?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 delaroche 10.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' Yes. You're both outlanders, right? Our local fairytales often speak of a terrifying underwater creature called Thelxie.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 delaroche 11.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' The story our parents would tell us was always the same... If we went to the water alone, then we'd be snatched away and eaten by a Water Imp called Thelxie.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A child-eating Water Imp!? Did they tell you what it looked like?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 delaroche 12.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' My father would always describe it as a beautiful, multi-colored snake-woman, while my mother said it had a handsome face. It's really strange, though, because you'd also hear other people describe it as just a chubby penguin with a deceptive appearance...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 delaroche 13.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' Even though the tales vary regarding its appearance, everyone agrees that it's really dangerous. It lives in an underwater cave surrounded by pallid bones and uses its sensitive nose to track down lonely children who've lost their way...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 delaroche 14.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' And once it finds a child, it uses its alluring singing voice to lure them into the water before swallowing them whole. Pretty terrifying, isn't it?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... sounds kinda scary, but isn't that pretty normal for a fairytale? After all, those kinds of stories are usually made up to help keep children away from danger...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 delaroche 15.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' But what if the fairytale was inspired by a real-life tale? Just like how a Water Vein always has a source.
:{{DIcon}} Do you have any concrete evidence?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 delaroche 16.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' Well, I wouldn't call it "evidence," per se, but I've heard some rumors lately... They say that someone recently saw a child walk into the water as if he was possessed by something. Doesn't that sound just like he was responding to the call of a Water Imp?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? So you mean someone really got eaten by a Water Imp?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 delaroche 17.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' It's all hearsay, so it's hard to confirm. But still, they all say this happened on Erinnyes! That's no laughing matter if you ask me.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 delaroche 18.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' Both the opera house and the Fountain of Lucine were built there, and the sources of many Water Veins can be traced to the island as well. Combine that with the mysterious mist, the huge tree with expansive underground roots, and the rumor that the vishaps on the island can understand human language...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 delaroche 19.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' Is it really so shocking that an island so shrouded in mystery could harbor a terrifying Water Imp as well?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, why does Paimon feel like you're pulling our leg... You're just piling on the rumors now. Still, if someone's really been hurt, then we can't just ignore the situation, right {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} We'll go check it out.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 delaroche 20.ogg}} '''Delaroche:''' Marvelous, then I'll just mark the stretch of water on your map! Don't forget that no matter what, safety always comes first.
----
;(Approach the stretch of water in [[Erinnyes Forest]])
:{{A|vo rpeq001 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is this the stretch of water Delaroche was talking about? It looks really peaceful... Huh? Look, there are some footprints over there...

;(Investigate the footprints)
:'''Fresh footprints:''' (The footprints extend all the way into the water...)
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' These look pretty fresh... Did the Water Imp get someone again? Let's look around and see if we can find anything else.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, {{Traveler}}! Did you hear something just now?
:{{Black Screen|Gurgling noises can be heard coming from the water...}}
:{{Black Screen|The noises grow louder and louder...}}<!--adds onto previous Black Screen text-->
:{{Black Screen|Until something emerges with a loud splash...}}<!--adds onto previous Black Screen text-->

;(Freminet appears)
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Arghhh!! What is that!? Don't come any closer!
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Paimon? {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} Freminet?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I'm sorry... I forgot I was still wearing this...
:{{Black Screen|Freminet removes his diving helmet.}}
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' F&mdash;Freminet!?
:{{Introductory Note|Freminet}}
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Paimon, are you okay?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew... Paimon nearly mistook you for a Water Imp! Thank goodness, it was just you wearing your helmet...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 04.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Huh?&nbsp;...A Water Imp?
:{{DIcon}} We're investigating a Water Imp called Thelxie.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 05.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Thelxie, you say? How surprising...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, you know that name too? Or do you know someone else who's trying to investigate the Water Imp?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 06.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' No... I think our situations are probably unrelated.
:{{DIcon}} Then could you tell us about what's going on with you?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 07.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Sure... If that's an order.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 08.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I know the name because of one of my employers. She noticed the clockwork penguins I brought to the workshop and contacted me through the shop's owner. She has commissioned me to make a special toy.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 09.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Following her request, I've named the toy "Thelxie."
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? but isn't it a little creepy to name a toy after a Water Imp... Wait, hold on! Freminet, you never take commissions from other people...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 10.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' ...Yeah, but uh... She made a special request, but out of respect for her privacy... I can't really talk about it.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 11.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' It's all right, though. She'll be coming over to check on my progress shortly, and I'll just tell her that you're two of my trustworthy companions. Hearing that, she might be willing to share some information and you'll be able to continue with your investigation.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, even though you seem a little cold and reserved sometimes, you're still really considerate! Our target isn't necessarily the Water Imp, though, we're primarily here to investigate the disappearance of the fish.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 12.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' The fish...?
:{{Black Screen|Freminet nods slightly, and seems lost in thought after you tell him about the commission from the Fishing Association.<br> Suddenly, his breath catches in his throat...}}
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 13.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Ah... I think I may have connected the dots...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 14.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' These past few weeks, I've been taking Thelxie for underwater testing every day. The pressure testing makes a lot of noise...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 15.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' So... All that about the disappearing fish... Well, it was probably because of me.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ehhh!? So that's all it was? That actually... makes a lot of sense... Wait, so could that mean the child we heard about who walked into the water was also...
:{{DIcon}} Just Freminet preparing for another day of work?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 16.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Yes, I think that's quite likely as well.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew, so in the end it was just Freminet! Paimon's spent all this time imagining what a Water Imp from the fairytales might look like, and it all turns out to be just a hoax...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 17.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I'm sorry... It sounds like I've created a lot of trouble for everyone else as well. I'll try to finish this commission as soon as possible. Once I'm done, the fish should come back.
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry about it. It was just a misunderstanding.
::{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 18a 1.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Thank you...
::{{A|vo rpeq001 2 paimon 11a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Actually, how much work do you still have left, Freminet? Maybe we could lend you a hand.
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, we'd be happy to help. Is there anything we can do?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 19.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Ah, thank you for offering... But I can't trouble you any more than I already have.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, it's no trouble at all! Didn't you just call us your trustworthy companions? Companions are all about helping each other, you know!
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 20.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' But... don't you need to report back to your commissioner?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nope, that's not how it works! See, Paimon's got these commissioner types all figured out. Even though we were just tasked with finding out why the fish had gone missing...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If we tell them now that it was all just a misunderstanding, you can bet they'd just immediately hand us another commission to help them get the fish back.
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, we're just really experienced in this kind of thing, that's all!
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Exactly! So if we can help you finish up your work and get the fish back, that would save us an extra trip.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 21.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Is that what you'd like to do as well?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, I think Paimon's right.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 2 freminet 22.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Huh... Alright, I'll trust your judgment. Please follow me... I've made a makeshift camp over there.
----
;(Approach Freminet's camp)
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I've stored Thelxie in the tent. He can respond to some simple verbal commands. You can try calling his name and see if he'll come over.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, sounds pretty advanced! Let Paimon give it a try. Hey, Thelxie, are you there?

;(Talk to Thelxie)
:'''Thelxie:''' -.. -... .-- -...?<ref group="Note" name="Ça va">{{w|Morse code}} for "DBWB." Deciphering the {{w|Caesar cipher}} using a left shift of one results in "CAVA" {{Lang|fr=''Ça va ?''|fr_tl=How are you?}}.</ref>
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's Freminet's version of Thelxie. It's also penguin-shaped, just like [[Pers]]!
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Yep. Had Thelxie lived in Penguin Town, he'd probably have become great friends with Pers.
:{{DIcon}} Where's Penguin Town?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' ...It's not really anywhere famous or important. Don't worry about it.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Thelxie! Nice to meet you! Do you know how to say hello?
:'''Thelxie:''' -.. -... .-- -...?<ref group="Note" name="Ça va" />
:{{DIcon}} So can Thelxie talk?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 freminet 04.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I wanted to install a language output module, but due to time constraints, I had to give up on the idea.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 freminet 05.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' As it stands, Thelxie can only output messages that were pre-written into its motherboard. I haven't given him the ability to convert those messages into discernable words, so... he can't really talk to us just yet.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... no need to get so technical! So basically, you want us to help you complete and install this language module, right?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 freminet 06.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' No, there's no need, that wasn't one of my employer's requests. It was just something I wanted to try...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 freminet 07.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I have two other things I'd like your help with... The first is to do some integration testing on Thelxie's motherboard to make sure he will be able to function properly in most situations.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That doesn't sound too hard... And what's the other thing?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 freminet 08.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' The other shouldn't take too long either... You'll need to find Thelxie some colorful shells and coral so I can craft a weapon for him.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A weapon? Will Thelxie have to fight?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 freminet 09.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Mm hmm, Thelxie will need to be able to charge forward with a weapon in hand like that brave prince of legend. It's a part of my employer's request.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What an imaginative employer! Naming Thelxie after a Water Imp, but wanting him to look like a prince...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 freminet 10.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Well, regardless of his role or species, Thelxie's purpose is the same. Just like Pers, he has come to this world to serve as somebody's companion.
:'''Thelxie:''' -.. .--. -. --.- -... .... --- .--- ..-.<ref group="Note">Morse code for "DPNQBHOJF." Deciphering the Caesar cipher using a left shift of one results in "COMPAGNIE" {{Lang|fr=''compagnie''|fr_tl=company}}.</ref>
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, Thelxie just said something again! Could he understand what we were just talking about?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 freminet 11.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' He can react to certain keywords, but unfortunately, due to the lack of a translation module, he still can't quite communicate with us...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...That's a pity, but anyway, the most important thing right now is for us to get to work! Maybe let's start by doing some testing on the motherboard, that sounds like something we can do here in the camp.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 freminet 12.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Sounds good. The motherboard is on my workbench, so please follow me.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 freminet 13.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Ah, here we go. I have this testing manual, so feel free to reference it if you get stuck.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 freminet 14.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Want to give it a try? It's okay if you don't succeed immediately. I've got a lot of backup boards just in case.
:{{DIcon}} I'll give it a try.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 3 freminet 15.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Okay. Knowing you, I'm sure you'll be able to figure it out.

;(Talk to Freminet, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog rpeq001 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Please give the testing a try. The motherboard's on the table there.

;(Talk to Thelxie, optional)
:'''Thelxie:''' -.. -... .-- -...?<ref group="Note" name="Ça va" />
----
;(Talk to Freminet after debugging the motherboard)
:{{A|vo rpeq001 4 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' You're doing well... just as I expected.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've taken on a lot of similar tasks before, you know!
:{{A|vo rpeq001 4 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Then let's move on to the underwater part. It's just as I mentioned earlier &mdash; we're after colorful shells and coral.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 4 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Oh, speaking of which, you're both already pretty used to Fontaine's underwater environment, right?
:{{DIcon}} ...More or less.
:{{DIcon}} We're pretty much experts now.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 4 freminet 04.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Okay, that's good. Just let me know if you ever feel uncomfortable &mdash; I'll make sure to stay right by your side.
----
;(Approach the body of water)
:{{A|vo rpeq001 5 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' It should be right over there. We'll be able to find something that'll help us with our search.

;(Approach the Echoing Conch)
:{{A|vo rpeq001 5 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' This is it. We call this thing the Echoing Conch. It can detect special reflection waves in the water, and help us with all kinds of underwater exploration and excavation efforts. Here, try it.

;(Play the Echoing Conch)
:{{A|vo rpeq001 5 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Did you notice any interesting places? The Echoing Conch should have detected some just now. Let's go check them out.

;(Interact with Inscribed Shell (I), optional)
:'''Inscribed Shell (I):''' "Full fathom five Thelxie lies; Of his bones are coral made."

;(After obtaining three {{Item|Material for Thelxie's Weapon}})
:{{A|vo rpeq001 5 freminet 04.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Alright, these should be enough. Let's head back to camp... Thank you for staying out here with me all this time.
----
;(Approach Zuria Destree at the camp)
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 01.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' ♪♫♪~
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 02.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Ah Freminet, you're back! I thought you might have been out diving.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I'm sorry, Madame Destree... I must have kept you waiting. I can report, though, that the construction of Thelxie is going quite smoothly.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 03.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' There's no rush. I'm your employer, not your supervisor. And these two are...?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 freminet 02a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo rpeq001 6 freminet 02b.ogg}}--> '''Freminet:''' Ah, they are two of my trustworthy companions. They're here to help me work on Thelxie.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 04.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Yes, I see... I suppose it's only natural for someone responsible like you to have some reliable friends.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's really nice to meet you, Madame Destree! Are you Freminet's employer? Paimon is Paimon, and this is {{Traveler}}.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 05.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Greetings, my new friends. Just call me Zuria. You are both so adorable &mdash; the sight of you reminds me of little fairies under a cottage roof.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, do you really think so?
:{{DIcon}} Do I look like a fairy, too?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 06.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Of course, if my child had friends like you, then perhaps he wouldn't have become so obsessed with the tales of Water Imps, and I wouldn't have had to trouble Freminet here with this commission.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Obsessed with... the tales of Water Imps?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 07.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Ah, so you don't know anything about my request yet? I would have thought Freminet had explained to you already.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, Freminet told us that it was a private matter, so he didn't want to just share it willy-nilly.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 08.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' I see, so Monsieur Freminet is even more discreet than I had thought. Hmm... as you are assisting him with the project, I believe it'll be beneficial for you to learn more about its vision and history.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 09.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' But it would be quite impolite of me to simply pile all of my troubles on you without your permission. So... would you like to listen to my story?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure, you can tell us anything! You've already said nice things about us, so we'll try our best to help you get through your troubles!
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 10.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Ah, what a lovely little fairy... Then let me think of a way to put my situation into words. Hmm... I'm sure you are already familiar with the tale of the Water Imps, right?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 11.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Simply put, parents came up with a story painting Water Imps as scary abductors in an effort to convince their children to stay away from the water. My child is rather special, however. While most other children are terrified of Thelxie... he's infatuated with him.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' In&mdash;Infatuated with a Water Imp? What a brave soul!
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 12.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Yes, he told me that he thought the Water Imp might have just been misunderstood. In his mind, instead of singing to abduct children, the Water Imp actually sang out of a longing for companionship. As a result, he often goes near the water in secret.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... So he wanted to become friends with the Water Imp so it wouldn't be lonely any longer? What a unique way of thinking!
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 13.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Thank you, little Paimon. He indeed has always stood out from the crowd... He was actually diagnosed with Loneliness Syndrome when he was only eight years old...
:{{DIcon}} Loneliness Syndrome?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 14.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Mhm, it's a type of mental disorder. Those affected by it often feel extremely lonely, and lose interest in many mundane activities. The syndrome is probably what made him so determined to become friends with the Water Imp.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no... Is it a very serious disorder?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' If you were to become afflicted with the disorder, Paimon, you would only be able to say less than a fraction of the words you're saying to {{Traveler}} now.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 paimon 09.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo rpeq001 6 paimon 10.ogg}}--> '''Paimon:''' No, Paimon won't accept that! We would have to find a doctor to help cure Paimon! Paimon has a 2000-word quota for daily conversations with {{Traveler}}, and she won't settle for a single word less!
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 15.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' The family doctor has already begun to treat my son... but since the disorder is rare, there aren't many good regimens for treatment. He's also developed some new symptoms lately... such as uncontrollable delusions.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Uncontrollable what now?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 freminet 04.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Uncontrollable delusions. To put it simply, he can no longer differentiate between fantasy and reality, and spends all his time in his fantasy world...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then... Then what is he seeing in his fantasy world?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 16.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' It's a dream that he often mentioned to me when he was younger. I've compiled what I could understand of his recent rambling. It goes a bit like this...
:{{Black Screen|Once upon a time, there was a splendid and magnificent underwater Kingdom of Water Imps on the Salacia Plain, five hundred feet beneath the surface.}}
:{{Black Screen|Countless lovely Water Imps lived in houses made of rainbow shells and corals, tending to sea animals during the day and singing between fields of golden tidalga during the night.}}<!--adds onto previous Black Screen text-->
:{{Black Screen|Everyone led carefree and blessed lives until the Day of the Iridescence Parade, the important festival during which the new king would be crowned...}}<!--adds onto previous Black Screen text-->
:{{Black Screen|Before the festival, all Water Imps would select the most precious pearl they owned, wrap it in golden branches and leaves, and offer it to their most beloved prince.}}
:{{Black Screen|And during the day of the parade, the prince would cross a rainbow bridge made from all the offered shells, and accept the crown from his father amid the applause of his subjects. Finally, the new king would bless everyone with his well wishes.}}<!--adds onto previous Black Screen text-->
:{{Black Screen|And as for the prince's name &mdash; it's none other than Thelxie.}}<!--adds onto previous Black Screen text-->
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Amazing... your son came up with all of this? He really crafted a lovely fairytale world for Thelxie. It's like a beautiful dream.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 17.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' But perhaps no beautiful dream can ever last long. You see, the story ended with a twist...
:{{Black Screen|The Day of the Iridescence Parade came as expected, but countless monsters also arrived alongside the prince...}}
:{{Black Screen|The monsters were evil and cruel, and they struck fear into all the Water Imps' hearts. The Water Imps, adept at singing as they were, could not defend themselves against the monsters. So the kingdom fell, the king was killed, and the Water Imps were locked behind bars. The rainbow bridge lost its color and crumbled away.}}<!--adds onto previous Black Screen text-->
:{{Black Screen|The prince was barely able to escape with the help of a mysterious masked individual, but he had already lost everything, and could only spend his days singing mournful songs.}}<!--adds onto previous Black Screen text-->
:{{Black Screen|And just as the prince sang out of loneliness, so could his song only be heard by similarly lonely children.}}<!--adds onto previous Black Screen text-->
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How could the story end like this...? Is that kind of fantasizing what caused your son to develop his Loneliness Syndrome?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 freminet 05.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Well, it'd be more accurate to say that it was the syndrome that caused such terrible delusions to manifest... But in any case, the biggest problem is the patient eventually loses themselves to the fantasy world of their own creation.
:{{DIcon}} What do you mean?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 18.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' My poor child can no longer differentiate between imagination and reality... He's begun to see himself as Thelxie.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 freminet 06.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Perhaps in his mind, the loneliness he felt became the same as that of a prince who lost everything he ever loved or stood for.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!? So that's what you mean by "uncontrollable delusions"... Then we have to help him snap out of it!
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 19.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Alas... Most of the time, he acts as if he can no longer sense or interact with the real world at all. I've had several discussions with the doctor, and we think it is best to try to guide his fantasy.
:{{DIcon}} Guide his fantasy?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 20.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' He once wanted to make a picture book of his imaginary world, but since the disorder progressed too quickly, he never quite got past the first page of the book. If we could use this book as a breakthrough for his condition... Here, you can take a look.
:[[File:Thelxie's Fantastic Adventures Picture Book 1 Part 1.png|250px]]
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, so Zuria's son also saw Thelxie as a penguin... Aw, he looks so sad...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 21.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' What we should do now is help him complete this picture book. However, we'll lead the story to a different ending... one where the Water Imp Prince is eventually able to restore his kingdom with the help of his friends.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 22.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' We'll need to chase away his loneliness and sorrow and let him perceive a world full of hope again. That's what I mean by "guiding his fantasy."
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But if we just need to finish the picture book, why does Freminet need to make a Thelxie as well?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 23.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Because we need to treat the book's story seriously, as if it's a history of things that have really happened. We'll need to go on a journey like Thelxie and help him regain his crown and country.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 24.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' But... my child can no longer go on a journey of his own. This is why I commissioned Freminet here to craft a "Thelxie," and then I'll paint the journey with this Thelxie into the picture book.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh, like a stand-in for your son! Paimon's starting to get it now... You really put a lot of thought into this, Zuria. Paimon still has one question, though &mdash; where will we be able to find a Water Imp kingdom?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 25.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' There are some ruins on the seabed of the Salacia Plains. I've already asked Freminet to research them for me. We'll be able to use one of the ruins as the kingdom.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! So we'll just need to act out a performance of, uh, "A Brave Journey Through the Kingdom of Water Imps." As long as we chase away the monsters in the ruins, it'll count as chasing away the monsters in the Water Imp kingdom, right?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 freminet 07.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Sadly no... We won't be just putting on a performance. It's just as Zuria said... We need to take this seriously, and the only way we can take this seriously is if we choose to believe everything that's happening is real.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... So we'll be playing it straight? Or uh... making it a fully immersive experience? Ugh, neither of those really sound right. Ah well, either way, we'll still be able to help, right?
:{{DIcon}} I'll try my best.
:{{DIcon}} We've got this!
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 26.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' It's alright, there's no need to get that serious. It's not a big deal &mdash; I believe in my son, we can just see this as him wanting to stay asleep for a bit longer because he's so enamored with his dream.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 freminet 08.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Zuria...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 27.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Keep your spirits up, everyone. If we were to look troubled, my son is sure to become anxious as well... Hmm, I should be heading back right about now to check on my son.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 28.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' We temporarily moved to a place on the hill over there so my son will have a better spot to convalesce. It's not far from the water and there's also a great view. Feel free to come find me if anything urgent comes up.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 freminet 09.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Understood. There's also one last thing... since these two friends were able to help me out, I've made some more progress on Thelxie. I estimate that he should be ready sometime tomorrow.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 29.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' That's great news &mdash; I must thank you all. Hmm, with that in mind, how about we meet here in two days' time to head to the Kingdom of Water Imps?
:{{DIcon}} Sounds good.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 zuria-destree 30.ogg}} '''Zuria Destree:''' Alright everyone, let's meet again in another two days.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Zuria sure is a brave and optimistic lady... Freminet, do you think her plan will work out?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 6 freminet 10.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' ...Let's discuss that over by the tent. There were a few things that I didn't bring up because the madame was here.

;(Talk to Freminet)
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What is it, Freminet? What did you want to say?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Ahem... If you don't mind me asking, I would like the two of you to mentally prepare yourselves...
:{{DIcon}} Mentally prepare ourselves? For what?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' {{Traveler}}, this is the first time that you've met anyone with this syndrome, right? I know you two are both really strong, and will do everything you can to help the child, but with the syndrome being the way it is, if things don't...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' If things don't quite turn out as we wish... I hope you'll be able to accept the outcome and not put too much blame on yourselves.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Freminet, why do you bring this up all of a sudden? Didn't we just promise Zuria that we'll be optimistic about everything working out?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 04.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' It's not that I'm not optimistic... It's just...
:{{DIcon}} You know this illness really well?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, so that's why you looked like you knew exactly what she was talking about! Wait, Freminet, don't tell Paimon that you also...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 05.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' No no... Please don't misunderstand, I never had it. I've just... I've just seen many cases of it at the [[House of the Hearth]], back when we lived under the previous Director.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 06.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' They say there are many factors surrounding the development of this illness... I've heard everything from heredity factors and one's state of mind to environmental factors and even Ley Line disorder effects. Some even say it could be caused by contamination from god remains...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 07.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' And from the cases I've seen, there weren't many positive outcomes. In the worst cases, the patient could even... pass away.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? It can get that serious? And here Paimon thought they'd just stop talking as much...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 08.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Yeah, that's just the nature of it. So if you'll find it difficult to cope with the worst-case scenario, I would prefer that you back out right now. I don't want you to help only to feel like you've failed...
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry, I've seen all kinds of strange and difficult things in life.
::{{A|vo rpeq001 7 paimon 05a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, that's right! Paimon's seen all of those things too... No matter how hard it might get, we won't be scared!
:{{DIcon}} You've got a point. I'll give it some thought.
::{{A|vo rpeq001 7 paimon 05b 1a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo rpeq001 7 paimon 05b 1b.ogg}}--> '''Paimon:''' Hey, now's not the time to be joking around! Don't worry, Freminet, no matter how hard it might get, we'll be able to handle it!
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 09.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Really... Then, in that case, let's see this real-life fantasy adventure together to the end.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! But Paimon has a question... If this illness can really be as bad as you've described, then do you really think Zuria's method will be able to help?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' After all, we'll just be using a toy as "Thelxie" and some ruins as the "Kingdom of Water Imps." The whole adventure will only be turned into a picture book for her son to read...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 10.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Well... I think it should be able to do something. To harbor a fantasy means that the child wants to save himself somehow. The only reason he's allowed his dream kingdom to fall is because he's lost control of his heart.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 11.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' But if we can help him regain control and escape from the darkness, we'll be able to change his world... like helping someone who's lost their voice be able to speak again.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon sees what you're saying now... How do you understand all of this so well, Freminet?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 12.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Hmm... well, maybe because I've also had many of my own dreams in the past. I even had my own fairytale world much like that boy's. I was able to draw a lot of support from it, so I believe in the power of fantasy worlds.
:{{DIcon}} So the Penguin Town you mentioned was...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 13.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Ah, so you remembered...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What Penguin Town? Why doesn't Paimon remember... Is that also a fairytale world? Don't leave Paimon in the dark!
:{{Black Screen|Suddenly, Freminet pulls out a diving helmet and puts it on his head...}}
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, why did you put that on!?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 14.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Ahem... It's just... One of my personal quirks. Please pay it no mind.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 15.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Anyway, Penguin Town is a peaceful place with lots of penguin residents. They are all really good at making clockwork toys.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 16.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' And Pers is the town's triumphant hero, as well as the one who quietly protects the whole place.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Pers? But didn't you make Pers yourself?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 17.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Well, I often think that Pers only came to me because he realized how much I needed him... So it's not so much that I made Pers as Pers chose me as his friend.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... Freminet, are you sure you're not losing control of your fantasies as well?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 18.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' No I don't think so... I can still differentiate between fantasy and reality, I just believe that the fairytale world of my dreams must also exist somewhere.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 19.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' It might just be hidden, which is why it's difficult to see, or it'll only reveal itself at very specific times...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Specific times? Like when you put on your diving helmet?
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 20.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Yeah, that's the general idea of it...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really!? Paimon just said that because you put on your helmet...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 21.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Have you ever observed the surface world from underwater? It's as if you're viewing a whole different world from the outside. It's a very surreal feeling... both alienating, but also as if you're being protected by something.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 22.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I have a similar feeling when I put on my diving helmet. In those moments, it's possible to see some... truly wondrous things, as if a fairytale has become reality. It's almost like a sort of miracle...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Like a miracle?
:{{DIcon}} Now I want to try on your helmet, too.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 23.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Well, if that's an order...
:{{DIcon}} I'm just kidding.
::{{A|vo rpeq001 7 paimon 16a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, don't you still need some time to work on Thelxie's weapon? We don't want to keep you from finishing your commission.
:{{DIcon}} Yep, that's an order.
::{{A|vo rpeq001 7 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, now's not the time! Freminet still has Thelxie's weapon to make, we don't want to bother him now.
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 24.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Right, I still have to collect some tools I'll need to craft the weapon, I've got to finish everything before tomorrow... Thank you for reminding me, Paimon. I'm sure there'll be other opportunities for you to try my helmet...
:{{A|vo rpeq001 7 freminet 25.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Thanks for all of your help. I'll be off for now &mdash; let's meet up here again in two days.

;(Interacting with the door at Zuria Destree's house)
:{{A|vo dialog rpeq001 jalacan 01.ogg}} '''A male voice from inside the room:''' Who are you? I have a patient here who needs quiet bed rest. Please leave us be unless you have anything urgent to report.
