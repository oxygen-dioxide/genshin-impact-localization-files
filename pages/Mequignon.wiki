==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Mequignon:''' Welcome to Bertin's House of Curiosities.
:{{DIcon|Souvenir}} What do you sell here? ''<small>(Before reaching [[Fountain of Lucine]] Level 50)</small>''
::'''Mequignon:''' I apologize, but I haven't encountered anything that catches my fancy lately. Come again later, if you please.
:{{DIcon|Souvenir}} What do you sell here? ''<small>(After reaching [[Fountain of Lucine]] Level 50)</small>''
::'''Mequignon:''' Please, take your pick. I do hope something catches your eye.
:;(Opens Souvenir Shop)
:{{DIcon}} You're a collector?
::'''Mequignon:''' Not exactly. I'm actually a clothes designer.
::'''Mequignon:''' If you ask someone in Fontaine about tailoring recommendations, there's a good chance that you'd either hear my name...
::'''Mequignon:''' ...Or that of "[[Chiori]]"...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Is collecting a hobby of yours?
:::'''Mequignon:''' Yes, it's also a way of seeking design inspiration.
:::'''Mequignon:''' I believe that "only those that are completely forgotten can become something that is brand-new."
:::'''Mequignon:''' Fashion is a loop of becoming outdated and then coming back in trend. If you're interested, take this. It's no longer useful to me anyway.
::;(Obtain 4{{star}} {{Item|Golden Bird's Shedding}})
::{{DIcon}} Chiori?
:::'''Mequignon:''' I refer to [[Chioriya Boutique]]'s Chiori, a designer from Inazuma.
:::'''Mequignon:''' Her tastes... aren't bad, but we've got differences in ideas. She's also a rather picky character &mdash; even her works do not satisfy her.
:::'''Mequignon:''' The last time I spoke to her of a design flaw in her work, not only did she not get angry, but she even picked at her own work more vehemently than I. I didn't dare put a word in lengthwise...
:{{DIcon}} I'll pass for now.
::'''Mequignon:''' Sure. Come again next time.
