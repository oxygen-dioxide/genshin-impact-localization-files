{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Batz:''' Need some music, my friend?
:{{DIcon}} Sounds good, I'm an excellent singer.
::'''Batz:''' Ah, then this must be fate! I've got a lot of records over at my place. I'll be sure to invite you if a concert comes up.
::'''Batz:''' Actually, that reminds me... The [[People of the Springs]] are huge fans of music, too. Their music's a lot more laid back, though &mdash; kinda like the hot springs they're known for.
::'''Batz:''' Our music is a lot more rhythmic in nature &mdash; you can even work with it playing in the background. Even [[Xilonen]], the most famous engraver here, has borrowed my records a few times.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, I'm not the best singer...
::'''Batz:''' That's okay! You don't have to be an expert to listen to music.
::'''Batz:''' I'm not a professional musician, either &mdash; my regular job is working as a caretaker for the [[Tepetlisaur]]s. That hasn't stopped me and my [[Saurian]] friends from appreciating music, though.
::'''Batz:''' If I have to make an analogy, it'd be like how some people love to listen to music as they do their chores. Aren't there a lot of people like that?
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, but I have other things to do at the moment.
::'''Batz:''' Aww, that's a pity. Well, maybe later, then!

==Trivia==
* According to [[Apoxpalon]], Batz was last seen "rushed off brandishing a sword he'd barely used to save a [[Saurian]] trapped in a mine."

===Etymology===
* In {{w|Maya civilization|Maya}} belief, ''Hun-Batz'' is one of the {{w|Howler monkey gods}}.
