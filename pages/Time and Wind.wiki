==Steps==
Reach and explore the island to start the quest.
#Uncover the secret of the uninhabited island
##''Find the "[[Ragged Notebook (Time and Wind)|Ragged Notebook]]" item by destroying the breakable rock on the south end of the island and read it.''
#Observe the shadow on the sundial
##''Wait until 2:00 – 5:00 and use [[Elemental Sight]] to follow the trail to the first cluster of wind located east of the sundial. Use Anemo on the cluster.''
#Disperse the cluster of wind (0/3)
##Use Anemo on the clusters located at the southern coast, on top of the ruin on the eastern coast, and on top of the largest pillar.
#Scatter the deposit of wind
##Located in the middle of the island above the stone circle.
##Fight the [[Eye of the Storm]].
#Pursue the Eye of the Storm
#*Use the wind current to follow it.
#*Alternatively, teleport to the [[Temple of the Wolf]] and head northeast until you reach the group of hilichurls by the sundial.
#Search for the Eye of the Storm
#*Optional: Speak to [[Henry Morton]], who will be standing near the sundial, and/or find his [[Thick Notebook]] in the nearby camp.
#*Wait until dawn (02:00 – 05:00) and use Elemental Sight to discover 3 clusters that need to be dispersed.
#**Fend off the monsters that spawn after dispersing each cluster.
#*Use Elemental Sight again to see the deposit of wind and scatter it again.
#*Fight the Eye of the Storm again. It will be slightly stronger than the first encounter, and also summons [[Anemo Slimes]] and [[Samachurls|Anemo Samachurls]] as reinforcements. These reinforcements despawn when the Eye of the Storm is defeated.
#Talk to Henry Morton

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You reach an uninhabited island across the sea, which is home to an enigmatic sundial. Who knows what secret it holds?}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Interact with the sundial before finding the Ragged Notebook)
:'''Ravaged Carving:''' "Stories brought on the wind will bloom into legends in due time."
:'''Paimon:''' What does that even mean? ...Paimon has no idea.
:'''Paimon:''' Still, this place looks like it hides some secret...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's check the area out. We might find some clues!
----
;(After finding the Ragged Notebook)
:'''Paimon:''' These seem to be somebody's notes, but what's this scribbled on top? Let's open it and have a closer look.

;(Observe the sundial after finding the notebook)
:'''Ravaged Carving:''' "Stories brought on the wind will bloom into legends in due time."
:'''Paimon:''' This must be the sundial mentioned in the notebook!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't get what's special about it, though...
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe we should read that notebook a bit more carefully.

;(After scattering the first wind cluster)
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, it seems to Paimon that this can be easily scattered by the wind.

;(If the clusters are not scattered before <nowiki>5:00</nowiki>)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? That strange feeling that was here seems to be gone now.
:'''Paimon:''' What's going on? Did the time already pass?

;(After scattering all wind clusters the Eye of the Storm)
:'''Faint Voice:''' "An ancient tale comes whisked in the wind..."

;(After the Eye of the Storm retreats)
:'''Paimon:''' Did it escape? Whatever it is, it's definitely an elemental life form with a reaction like that.
:'''Paimon:''' That way leads to the Thousand Winds Temple. C'mon, let's move those legs!
;(After summoning the Eye of the Storm again)
:'''Faint Voice:''' "In time, it will grow and sprout once again..."
{{Quest Description|Update|In pursuit of the [[Eye of the Storm]], you return to the vicinity of the [[Thousand Winds Temple]]. There is a sundial here as well, and it seems to be exactly the same as the one on the uninhabited island...}}

;(Henry Morton's idle quote while searching for the Eye of the Storm)
:'''Henry Morton:''' Where is this wind coming from?

;(Talk to Henry Morton)
:'''Henry Morton:''' Hmm? Did you have business here, Traveler?
:{{DIcon}} About the Eye of the Storm...
:'''Henry Morton:''' The Eye of the Storm? I've been in this area this entire time, and I've never seen any such thing, except for that sudden huge wind earlier...
:'''Henry Morton:''' But I'm sure that it wasn't an Eye of the Storm. I would have recognized that thing anywhere.
:{{DIcon}} Alright then...
::'''Henry Morton:''' Believe me, I wouldn't be able to forget something like that coming to interrupt my research if I tried.
:{{DIcon}} What are you up to, here?
::'''Henry Morton:''' Me? I'm doing a bit of research.
:'''Henry Morton:''' To be precise, I'm doing research together with a friend of mine.
:'''Henry Morton:''' He's also a scholar, and we went to [[Sumeru Akademiya]] together.
:'''Henry Morton:''' He became an archaeologist thereafter, traveling the world and doing surveys, while I continued my studies in the Akademiya.
:'''Henry Morton:''' When he came to Mondstadt, he told me excitedly that he was surveying the Thousand Winds Temple.
:'''Henry Morton:''' He even said something like "Once I've uncovered the secrets of your homeland, you're the first person I'll tell."
:'''Henry Morton:''' I didn't hear from him afterwards. I asked someone to send [[Cyrus]] a letter, requesting that the [[Adventurers' Guild]] help me look for my friend's whereabouts.
:'''Henry Morton:''' But there was no news of him at all, and so I discontinued my studies and hurried back here.
:'''Henry Morton:''' But there's nothing here but a sundial, and there are no other clues...
:{{DIcon}} Well, there's a sundial on that island...
:'''Henry Morton:''' What? There's another sundial elsewhere that's identical to this one, and it's on an island?
:'''Henry Morton:''' Oh, yes! Now I remember. I've actually seen that island sometimes, when the weather's clear.
:'''Henry Morton:''' Wait... You said that you found a notebook next to the sundial? Did that fellow go there?
:'''Henry Morton:''' Thank you. If I have the chance, I will head to that island to have a look. For now, however, I still have to figure this place out.
:'''Henry Morton:''' I must continue my research. If you're interested, you can have a look at my research notes. I've left it over there.
:'''Henry Morton:''' Who knows? Perhaps there's something in there that might help you.
----
;(Henry Morton's idle quote while fighting the Eye of the Storm)
:'''Henry Morton:''' Ugh! Wh&mdash;What a mighty wind!

;(Henry Morton's idle quote after defeating the Eye of the Storm)
:'''Henry Morton:''' Traveler! Come over here!

;(Talk to Henry Morton after defeating the Eye of the Storm)
:'''Henry Morton:''' Where did this thing come from? It wasn't here before!
:'''Henry Morton:''' How did you summon it?
:{{DIcon}} Well...
:'''''You give Henry Morton a detailed account of how the riddle was solved.'''''
:'''Henry Morton:''' Ah, so that's "time and wind..."
:'''Henry Morton:''' So, there's another sundial exactly like this one on the island, am I right?
:'''Henry Morton:''' And the method to solve its riddle is the same? Then, there must be some link between these two sundials, and the two places they are located in.
:'''Henry Morton:''' I must find a way to get to that island, and quickly...
:'''Henry Morton:''' Thank you, Traveler. Once I've made some preparations, I will look for you, and we shall visit that uninhabited island together.

==Trivia==
*Despite being called {{w|sundial}}s in the quest and its related achievement, these sundials are more likely to be {{w|moondial}}s. Real-life sundials require their gnomons to point true south or true north (depending on the hemisphere) due to the way the sun moves across the sky from east-to-west. However, even though Teyvat's sun appears to move in the same direction, the gnomons on these sundials point west and are largely useless for telling time during daylight hours.
**During nighttime, a shadow cast over the gnomon by moonlight can be seen by 0:00 (midnight), falling on the second-right diamond. The shadow hits the middle of the sundial at 3:00 and nearly reaches the second-left diamond by 5:00, which marks the start of sunrise and the end of the period in which the player can disperse the clusters. By 5:30, the sundials are covered by full shadow and are useless for telling time until 12:00.
