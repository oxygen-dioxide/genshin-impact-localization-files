|description    = An ordinary-looking sample holder that's one of the instruments used by [[Forest Rangers]] to measure and improve the forest's soil composition. It also serves as a culture dish for investigating the effectiveness of certain plants in improving the fecundity of the rainforest. The Forest Rangers would plant seeds that are difficult to germinate and wait in anticipation for their desired outcome. "It just might work this time," they would quip as they began the long observation process. Most of the time, all they got in return was a large batch of ordinary mushrooms. However, the persistent Forest Rangers have not given up, and are still going through an endless cycle of trial and error.
