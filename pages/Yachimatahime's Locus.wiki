==Trivia==
* Yachimatahime's Locus can be [[Gliding|glided]] to from the rocks above the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]] at any time, even if [[Eboshi]] has not been talked to.
* Before talking to Eboshi for the first time and starting the World Quest [[The Three Great Martial Trials]], there is nothing in this area except for some floating textures and [[Smashed Stone]]s, but arriving at this area shows this area's name and difficulty rating just like other areas.
* After talking to Eboshi for the first time and starting the World Quest The Three Great Martial Trials, Yachimatahime's Locus is raised, and a [[Time Tunnel]] at [[The Emanant Skylight]] in [[Evernight Temple]] appears that teleports players to the [[Teleport Waypoint]] in Yachimatahime's Locus.
* After Yachimatahime's Locus is raised by Eboshi, players can land on this area after gliding from the rocks above the Dainichi Mikoshi. However, most of this area is surrounded by a barrier until the player has sufficiently progressed through [[Yachimatahime's Trial]]. Aside from a few errant patches of cliff and land, the only place outside of the barrier is the area around the [[Teleport Waypoint]].
* The area can be glided to and landed upon with 240 Max [[Stamina]] with various combinations of Stamina restoration, decreases in gliding Stamina consumption, increases in gliding movement speed, and Talents that can be used in mid-air to gain distance or height.
* The Teleport Waypoint can be unlocked as soon as the area is raised by Eboshi, regardless of how the player reaches the area.

===Etymology===
*{{lang|Yachimatahime|ja=八衢姫}} is derived from the Japanese local deity {{lang|Yachimatahime|ja=八衢比売|ja_lit=Eight-Fork-Road-Princess.}} Some believe Kunado, Yachimatahiko, and Yachimatahime to be three gods of the {{w|Dōsojin}} (or ''Sae no kami''), Shinto kami who protect travelers; both Yachimatahiko and Yachimatahime's names refer to the idea that they protect an area in the eight directions by defeating evil beings that approach and avert disasters.<ref>Google Books: [https://www.google.com/books/edition/Shinto_The_Ancient_Religion_of_Japan/DNPOCgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=Yachimatahiko-no-Kami&pg=PT137&printsec=frontcover Shinto, the Ancient Religion of Japan]</ref><ref>Ashiya Shrine: [https://www.ashiyajinja.or.jp/saisin/saisin-45/ {{Ja|八衢比古命／八衢比売命}}]</ref>
