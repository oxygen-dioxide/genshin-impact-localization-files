A grey cat with emerald green eyes that possesses the grace of an "aristocat." If you want to build a relationship with it, it wouldn't hurt to imitate the mannerisms of an aristocrat, and gently raise its paws in an invitation to dance with you.

==Trivia==
* When [[Fischl]] appears next to [[Dopey]], [[Oz]] can be found near a dock on the eastern shore of [[Cider Lake]], almost directly west of the [[Starfell Lake]]. Talking with Fischl reveals that Oz did not accompany her because cats react negatively to his presence, due to his high amount of Electro energy.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Oz:''' It is rare to have such leisure time. I wonder if Mein Fräulein is also enjoying herself...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Oz seems to be resting. Best not to disturb him...)
{{Dialogue End}}
* [[Ematol]] can be found at the top of the stairs leading to [[Hertha]], having previously been knocked out cold by the escaping [[Knights of Favonius#Investigation|Investigative Team]]'s squad cat, [[Sir Pouncelot]]. She will no longer be here once Sir Pouncelot is part of the event.
