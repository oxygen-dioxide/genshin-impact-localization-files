'''Food''' are [[Consumable]] items in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''. It is the fourth tab in the [[Inventory]]. Food can be used to heal characters, revive characters, buff the player's character, or buff the entire party.

Most food items can be crafted through [[Cooking]] or [[Alchemy]]. A few ([[Apple]], [[Bulle Fruit]], [[Candlecap Mushroom]], [[Starshroom]], and [[Sunsettia]]) can be foraged in the wild and consumed directly.

When knocked out characters are revived, they will still have the same ongoing duration of food buffs as the rest of the other party members. Food items cannot be deleted from the inventory, except for those aforementioned ones that can be foraged.

==Food Quality==
{{See also|Cooking}}
Food items have 3 different types of quality: Suspicious, the regular version of the dish, and Delicious. Suspicious and Delicious variants of the dish have a 20% decrease/increase to the normal dish's stats respectively; the timer is consistent regardless of the food's quality.

Dishes, when cooked with a specific character, have a certain chance to be made as a [[Special Dish]] variant depending on the quality and quality of the food. These special dishes provide either a higher bonus or additional effect over its Delicious variant, as well as a separate icon, name and description.

==Fullness==
When a character consumes [[:Category:Recovery Dishes|Recovery Dishes]] (Food that restores [[Attributes#Health|HP]]), their Fullness Gauge will increase. The Fullness Gauge has a maximum length of 100.<ref>NGA: [https://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=30824180 关于饱食度的一些补充研究]</ref>

When Fullness = 100, no more Recovery Dishes can be consumed.

When Fullness > 0, it will deplete over time at a rate of 0.3/s

When Fullness reaches 100, the Full State will be applied to the character for 30 seconds, which halts the over time depletion of Fullness until it ends.

Fullness is reset to 0 when a character is revived.

Fullness increase from a single Recovery Dish item is calculated as <math>\text{Parameter A} + \frac{\text{Parameter B}}{\text{Character Max HP}}</math>.

==Multiple Food Buffs==
Eating foods with positive benefits other than health gain can increase stats like [[Defense]], [[CRIT Rate]], [[Attack]] - these are grouped into four types - Offensive, Defensive, Elemental, and Stamina. Only one food buff of each type can be active at a time, and the most recent one will replace any previously obtained, even if it is inferior. However, buffs affecting all four states can be active at the same time.
# Offensive group: [[CRIT Rate]], [[CRIT DMG]], [[Physical DMG]], and [[Attack]] boosts
# Defensive group: [[Shield Strength]], [[Defense]], [[Health]], and [[Healing Bonus]] boosts
# Stamina group: [[Climbing]], [[Gliding]], and [[Sprinting]] stamina reductions (stamina restoratives act separately)
# Elemental group: Both elemental damage boosts and elemental damage reductions are classed together, and it is not possible to have two boosts or a boost and resistance active simultaneously.

===Notes===
* Foods that affect [[Sheer Cold]] accumulation form the fifth group.
* When the player logs out, the duration of food/potion effects are frozen. It is not known if they will still tick when the game client is still running but not connected to the server.
* Flat Attack foods (like +100 Attack) are not modified by ATK% stats from equipment.
*Healing from multiple continuous healing foods does not stack.
* (As of [[Version 1.4]]) The numerical values currently active, nor their remaining time are not shown in any menu.

==Cooldown==
Some foods have a cooldown period after usage. Stamina refill foods have a 300-second cooldown, and Revival foods have a 120-second cooldown on usage. Unlike most other items with a cooldown on usage, the cooldown timer for food does not count down if gameplay is paused (i.e. opening the Inventory menu).

==Trivia==

** {{Item|Rainbow Aster}} (recipe only obtainable from an event in Inazuma, {{Item|Calla Lily}} unobtainable from Inazuma)
** {{Item|Candied Ajilenakh Nut}} (recipe only obtainable from Sumeru, {{Item|Almond}} unobtainable from Sumeru)
