===Requirement===
*Complete World Quest [[Bullseye Balloons (Quest)|Bullseye Balloons]]

===Description===
''Shoot the balloons as quickly and as accurately as you can to reach a high score!''

Archery contests are a Windblume Festival tradition that commemorate the early days of Mondstadt, an age of pioneering and hunting...<br />
Challenging archery competitions have also been prepared for this year's Windblume Festival.
Those who are well-versed in these arts will, naturally, be able to win the prizes and wow the residents of Mondstadt...

====Balloon Types====
[[File:Invitation of Windblume Balloon Types.png|500px]]

* {{Icon|Bouquet Balloon|30}} [[Bouquet Balloon]]
* {{Icon|Celebration Balloon|30}} [[Celebration Balloon]]
* {{Icon|Heartbreak Balloon|30}} [[Heartbreak Balloon]]

===Tutorial===
[[File:Tutorial Bullseye Balloons 1.png|200px|thumb|left]] During the Windblume Festival, corresponding event billboards will display the challenge locations for Bullseye Balloons. Once the challenge has begun, participants must accumulate points by {{Color|buzzword|shooting the right balloons down in succession}}. Only {{Color|buzzword|Normal and Charged Attacks}} can be used to shoot these balloons down (Aimed Shots are counted as Charged Attacks). {{Color|buzzword|The challenge will end once time runs out.}}
{{clr|L}}
[[File:Tutorial Bullseye Balloons 2.png|200px|thumb|left]] Different balloons will produce different effects when hit. The green Bloom Balloon will award points, while the orange Bouquet Balloons will provide a large number of points. Aside from this, the Celebration Balloons will {{Color|buzzword|explode and destroy surrounding balloons}} when popped, while the similar-looking Heartbreak Balloons will {{Color|buzzword|deduct points}} when popped. Hit multiple balloons in a short period of time to accumulate Combo, which will increase the number of points awarded for each hit. Hitting a Heartbreak Balloon will interrupt your current combo.

[[File:Tutorial Bullseye Balloons 3.png|200px|thumb|left]] You can also enter Bullseye Balloons with friends in Co-Op sessions to test your shooting skills against each other.

[[File:Windblume Floral Freefall Minigame.png|thumb|right]]
===Requirement===
*Complete World Quest [[Floral Freefall]]

===Description===
''Glide down through the air and collect the Flower Balls!''

Leap from great heights using wind gliders, catch the flower balls that billow about in the wind, and descend amidst gorgeous garlands...<br />
This celebratory activity is much-loved by adventurers. In the words of Mondstadt's poets, the feeling of slowly descending from the skies is akin to becoming a flower in the wind.<br />
Of course, you will need a gliding license to take part in Floral Freefall. But the Knights of Favonius are quite happy to close one eye to such matters when it comes to a festival of such size and joy...

====Flower Balls====

===Tutorial===
[[File:Tutorial Floral Freefall 1.png|200px|thumb|left]] During the Windblume Festival, corresponding event billboards will display the challenge locations for Floral Freefall. Once the challenge has begun, participants will descend from a platform in the sky {{Color|buzzword|and collect a variety of Flower Balls}} to obtain and accumulate points. {{Color|buzzword|Touching the ground or running out of time will end the challenge}}.
{{clr|L}}
[[File:Tutorial Floral Freefall 2.png|200px|thumb|left]] Collect different types of Flower Balls to obtain different amounts of points. Of these, the {{Color|buzzword|green Fluorescent Flowerballs}} are worth 35 points, while the {{Color|buzzword|Honey-Petal Crowns made from orange Windwheel Asters}} are worth 200 points. The {{Color|buzzword|elaborate Finish Line Garland}} is worth 400 points. Aside from this, your remaining time will be converted into points once you complete the challenge. Each second remaining is worth 10 points.

==Ballads of Breeze==
[[File:Windblume Ballads of Breeze Minigame.png|thumb|right]]
===Requirement ===
*Complete World Quest [[Ballads of Breeze]]

===Description===
''Want to put your musical ability to the test? Try to keep up with the beat!''

Thanks to the influence of poetry and song, the people of Mondstadt are all at least passingly familiar with the art of performing a song they love.
The artful transcription of scores, the nimble plucking of strings... these are at the heart of one of the Windblume Festival's long-preserved events: musical competition!

===Tutorial===
{{See also|Rhythm Game}}
[[File:Tutorial Ballads of Breeze 1.png|200px|thumb|left]]
You can test your performance skills in "Ballads of Breeze" through the "Invitation of Windblume" event menu. Follow the rhythm and the hints provided by the gradually-shrinking Rhythm Rings to {{Color|buzzword|press the corresponding buttons at the right time}}. Getting the rhythm right will award points. Your performance will be graded afterward according to the points you obtained.
{{clr|L}}
[[File:Tutorial Ballads of Breeze 2.png|200px|thumb|left]] The Rhythm Rings will appear before the beat and will shrink over time. When the Rhythm Ring {{Color|buzzword|aligns precisely}} with the button press area, it is time to press the button and play some music! But get it wrong and you'll miss the beat...
{{clr|L}}
[[File:Tutorial Ballads of Breeze 3.png|200px|thumb|left]] Accurate play allows you to increase the Combo count. When your Combo count reaches a certain point, accurate play will award more points. Watch out though &mdash; a missed note will send your Combo count up in smoke...
{{clr|L}}

===Notes===
*On PC (using mouse and keyboard), you can use your mouse to tap the notes, but because some notes are played simultaneously, a keyboard is also required.
*Bonus points are awarded for combos (consecutive notes played successfully):
