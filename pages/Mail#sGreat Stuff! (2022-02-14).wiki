|text    = Recently, I happened upon some Noctilucous Jade of decent quality, I'll bring them over to you. I am not big on ore research, but they sure are beauties.

In my hands, they are nothing more than just rocks, but you can probably find some use for them. Perhaps you can collect them, or make jewelry or weapons? Haha, your choice will reflect your taste in ore and I can see your level of skill.

I'm free today, how about you? If you have time, why not join me for a walk?

You don't need to bring anything, I'll cover all costs, same as before.

You know where to find me, right? See you soon!
