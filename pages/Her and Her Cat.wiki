'''Her and Her Cat''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Wonders of the World]]''. To complete this achievement, the player needs to complete ''[[The Narukami Trail]].''

==Trivia==
*The achievement name is likely a reference to the 1999 Japanese animation "{{w|She and Her Cat}}", which depicts the life of a cat and her female owner from the cat's perspective.
**The short film's themes share similarities to Neko and Hibiki. The cat in the animation adores and loves their owner, much like Neko loves and misses Hibiki. The perspective and narration from the cat in the animation also resembles how everything we know about Hibiki is from Neko's point of view.
