|description     = A dessert made from fermented milk.
|desc_suspicious = It appears to be fine, but as soon as you try some... your teeth will quiver due to the unbearable acidity. The lack of seasoning can still be made up for by adding more sugar. However, that lingering sourness is hardly something that can be easily forgotten.
|desc_basic      = Once the milk is fermented and filtered into yogurt, stir sugar in before garnishing with dried roses and chopped nuts. In the beginning, this dish was only popular among adventurers and traveling merchants, but now, it is served as breakfast and a tea-time dessert across Sumeru.
|desc_delicious  = When mixed together, the dense curd, fragrant petals, and crisp nuts together create a mellow and sweet taste. As that fragrant milky concoction slips down your throat, it is almost as if you can smell the floral scent from a long time ago.

==Trivia==
* Based on its description, as well as the Japanese localization's name for the dish, this dessert is based on {{w|shrikhand}}, a dessert which originated in western India. It is made with strained yogurt which is whipped until creamy and combined with sugar, cardamom, and saffron. Traditionally, rose shrikhand derives its rose flavor from {{w|gulkand}}, a sweet rose petal preserve.
** Some localizations may have interpreted Rose Custard to be based on {{w|muhallebi}}, a Middle Eastern milk pudding which is commonly flavored with rose water and cardamom, and garnished with rose petals and pistachios. However, muhallebi is made with milk thickened with starch, not with fermented milk like Rose Custard and shrikhand are.
