|description  = An ancient type of coinage that Ulman is collecting. Perhaps he may offer you something in exchange for Iron Coins.
Long ago, there was once an organization that attempted to found their own nation. These coins were the nation's minted currency at the time.

'''Iron Coin''' is an event currency for the event [[Lost Riches]]. The player can trade them with [[Ulman]] for valuable rewards.

During the event, in a Treasure Area, the [[Treasure-Seeking Seelie]] can be used to detect dig sites within a two sprint radius that have 4, 8 or 20 Iron Coins, for a maximum of 60 Iron Coins per Treasure Area.

==Trivia==
* The ancient coins share the same design as the more modern [[Mora]] in use since the ascension of [[The Seven]], the only difference apart from their material being the additional triquetra embossed on Mora.
