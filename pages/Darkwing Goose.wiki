|description = A large bird that lives in ponds or lakes. A close relative of Snow-Wing Geese.<br>Due to the Darkwing Geese bearing wings of pitch black, they were once thought of as Snow-Wing Geese that have been cursed. Due to such superstitions, the Darkwing Geese were regarded by a minority of Fontainians as omens of abnormality and uncertain calamities.<br>With the changing of the times, people began to seek new and fresher expressions of art. Hence, there came an increased number of works portraying the Darkwing Geese in a more positive light. In Fontaine's artistic circles, the term "Darkwing Goose" has been used to describe unexpected phenomena and individuals who were ill-regarded at the inception, but proved to astonish with the passing of time.

==Trivia==
* Despite the fact that the species is a "goose", the appearance looks more based on a {{W|swan}}.
** The design was also based on a mixture of the {{W|mute swan}} and the {{W|black swan}}.
* The design and the description of the Darkwing Goose has hints of the famous ''{{W|Swan Lake}}'' ballet.
** The crown-like "accesory" in its head is reminiscent to the white swan's headdress, even though this time it was in a black color.
** When the [[Snow-Winged Goose]] and the Darkwing Goose was spotted together, this was possibly made as a reference to the main swan characters from the ballet itself, Odette and Odile, who represents good and evil due to their main colors.
** When it was mentioned that they were thought for being "cursed" and being the "omens of abnormality and uncertain calamity", it was also referencing about Odile herself (or maybe, the rest of the swans) being under the influence of the main villain of the ballet, Rothbart.

* In the description, when it was mentioned that it was "used to describe unexpected phenomena" and so on, this is a direct reference to the {{W|black swan theory}}.
