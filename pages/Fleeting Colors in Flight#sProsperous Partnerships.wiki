The [https://books.google.com.my/books?id=b1j-q7-TLHYC&pg=PA227&lpg=PA227 chapter] details "eight short sections listing various matters to be observed if one is to ascertain the general health of a state". Additionally, the number "eight" in the event name may also be a reference to the fact that there are eight in-game characters available during the event.
