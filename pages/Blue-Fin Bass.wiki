==Trivia==
*The Blue-Fin Bass may be inspired by a combination of the namesake of a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_bluefin_tuna bluefin tuna] with the anatomy of a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_(fish) bass].
**If this is the case, it may explain why all [[Bass|bass variants]] can be found in both freshwater bodies, lakes and rivers, and in saltwater, at the sea.
