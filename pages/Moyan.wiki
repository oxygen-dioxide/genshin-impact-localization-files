==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Moyan:''' Greetings, guest from afar! If you're looking for Qiaoying Village, just keep walking north on this road.
:{{DIcon}} You are...
::'''Moyan:''' I'm Moyan, the village accountant. I sometimes also help the others with odd jobs here and there.
::'''Moyan:''' Our merchants often pass through here, and I ask after their businesses every day.
::'''Moyan:''' I also visit every family in the village every month, so I have a good idea of how we're doing financially.
::{{DIcon}} Sounds really tough...
::'''Moyan:''' Thank you for asking!
::'''Moyan:''' My job's not that difficult, especially when compared to taking care of tea trees, drying tea, and stirring them in a hot pan. After all, tea is our most important commodity.
::'''Moyan:''' The tea farmers get up while it's still dark and work year-round to make sure that people everywhere get to enjoy it at a fair price.
::'''Moyan:''' I've never heard them complaining about their work, either.
::'''Moyan:''' They love tea, and they make the most out of their days. That must have rubbed off on me, I guess, 'cause I'm pretty proactive myself.
:;(If the player has not completed ''An Ancient Sacrifice of Sacred Brocade'')
:::{{DIcon}} How are things lately?
:::'''Moyan:''' It's a long story...
:::'''Moyan:''' For some reason, the first harvest this year is yellower than usual, and didn't fetch a good price.
:::'''Moyan:''' Most of the villagers live off of the money we make growing tea, so we need to figure out what happened as soon as possible.
:;(If the player has completed ''An Ancient Sacrifice of Sacred Brocade'')
:::{{DIcon}} About your income...
:::'''Moyan:''' It's not all stormy clouds. The first harvest wasn't great, but the second was better.
:::'''Moyan:''' When you grow things, you're bound to have a bad year here and there. I just hope next year will be better.
:{{DIcon}} About Qiaoying Village...
::'''Moyan:''' We're already within Qiaoying Village's borders. Welcome to the home of Liyue's most famous tea!
::'''Moyan:''' Qiaoying Village is not as bustling as Yilong Wharf, but a quiter, more relaxed place has value all its own.
::'''Moyan:''' If you like tea, please give our Sunglo Tea and Single-Origin Yauwan Tea a try, You'll love them!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Moyan:''' Please take care.
