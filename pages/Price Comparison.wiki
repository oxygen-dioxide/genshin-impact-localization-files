==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Azalai from Aaru Village seems to be troubled by one of his orders.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Azalai, optional)
:'''Azalai:''' (Just think about all the trouble I have to go through for every batch of goods... *sigh*)

;(Talk to Azalai)
:'''Azalai:''' I'll have to ask [[Raef]] to find someone...
:{{DIcon}} Why the long face?
:'''Azalai:''' What are you looking to buy, Traveler? I'm afraid that we may be somewhat out of stock.
:{{DIcon}} So that's what troubles you?
:'''Azalai:''' Yes... This is a desert village, so shipment has always been troublesome for us.
:'''Azalai:''' Whenever I want to source some wares, I need to ask those who happen to leave the village to place an order for me, then transport it to the village together with Raef.
:'''Azalai:''' One way or another, my business costs are slowly rising. To make ends meet, I have no other choice than to increase my prices.
:'''Azalai:''' Thankfully, the people of this village understand my predicament and are willing to support my business, otherwise... I would've gone bankrupt a long time ago.
:'''Azalai:''' But, alas... I can't find anyone who's planning to leave the village, and Raef and his crew aren't always available...
:'''Azalai:''' If I'm unlucky, some low-volume goods may be out of stock soon...
:{{DIcon}} And those goods are...
::'''Azalai:''' They are all daily essentials. Even though I'm usually quick to source them, they sell even quicker.
::'''Azalai:''' I'm running a small business, so I can't always buy large volumes.
:{{DIcon}} If only you could find a long-term business partner...
::'''Azalai:''' It's not like I haven't considered that, but look around you.
::'''Azalai:''' Shipping goods into the village and running business here aren't exactly easy.
:'''Azalai:''' Ahem... that's a topic for another day. Traveler, perhaps you are getting ready to leave the village?
{{Dialogue end}}

===Spice Version===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Azalai:''' I've been wanting to source some spices and need someone to place an order for me... Could you assist me with this?
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
:{{DIcon}} So spices are out of stock in your store?
::'''Azalai:''' I wouldn't say we've run out completely... but given how big the sales volumes are, it's always better to have some more in stock.
:'''Azalai:''' Let me see... {{color|buzzword|Rama's}} spices are fairly priced and the quality is... serviceable.
:'''Azalai:''' {{color|buzzword|Jut}} has recently got his hands on some novelty spices &mdash; the quality's quite promising. I'd like to give them a shot, just to see if there's any demand, but I'm not sure about the price point...
:'''Azalai:''' But my budget for this purchase is limited, so deciding which supplier to choose isn't going to be easy...
:'''Azalai:''' Traveler, please check out both suppliers and pick one to place an order with.
:'''Azalai:''' Oh, one more thing. Whenever I commissioned someone to place an order for me in the past, I'd ask them to look for a relatively cheap price point.
:'''Azalai:''' I'd like you to do the same. Please remember to look for the cheaper supplier.
:'''Azalai:''' The business strategy that's been working in Aaru Village so far is "selling more at a lower profit margin."
:{{DIcon}} I'll check out what {{color|buzzword|Rama}} has to offer first...
::'''Azalai:''' Thank you in advance. I'll mark her location on the map for you.
:{{DIcon}} I'll check out what {{color|buzzword|Jut}} has to offer first...
::'''Azalai:''' Thank you in advance. I'll mark his location on the map for you.
:'''Azalai:''' Alright, come back anytime if you have any additional questions.
:;(Obtain [[Azalai's Payment]])

;(Talk to Azalai again)
:'''Azalai:''' How did it go? Have you placed an order yet?
:{{DIcon}} About {{color|buzzword|Rama's}} location...
::'''Azalai:''' You can't find her exact location? Okay... I'll mark that spot on the map for you.
:{{DIcon}} About {{color|buzzword|Jut's}} location...
::'''Azalai:''' You can't find his exact location? Okay... I'll mark that spot on the map for you.
:'''Azalai:''' You should be good to go now. I'm counting on you, Traveler.

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Rama, optional)
:'''Rama:''' (It's difficult to do business...)

;(Talk to Rama)
:'''Rama:''' Welcome! Want to buy some spices? We have all the usuals, and all at affordable prices!
:{{DIcon}} About Azalai's order...
:'''Rama:''' Huh? Azalai asked you to place an order for him? No problem at all...
:'''Rama:''' It's just that he used to ask the Eremites to source his goods, and this time, he commissioned an Adventurer...
:'''Rama:''' Ahem! What's his budget today? Let's see... Ooh, quite a bit.
:'''Rama:''' Uh, if you place an order at my store, the spices supplied by me should last him for a long while.
:'''Rama:''' As for the selling price... Just like before, I suggest setting a slightly lower price point. That's an easy way to boost sales.
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to place my order here.
::'''Rama:''' Oh! Thanks for your patronage! Please wait a moment while I make preparations and arrange delivery.
:;(Obtain [[Rama's Receipt]])
:;(Proceeds to next quest step)
:{{DIcon}} I'll try my luck elsewhere.
::'''Rama:''' Okay... Come back and tell me if you change your mind.

;(Talk to Rama again)
:'''Rama:''' Made up your mind yet? Want to place your order with me?
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to place my order here.
::'''Rama:''' Thanks for your patronage! Please wait a moment while I make preparations and arrange delivery.
:;(Obtain [[Rama's Receipt]])
:;(Proceeds to next quest step)
:{{DIcon}} I'll try my luck elsewhere.
::'''Rama:''' Alright. But hurry up, please. If you wait too long, I may be out of stock.
----

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Jut, optional)
:'''Jut:''' (We're having fewer customers lately...)

;(Talk to Jut)
:'''Jut:''' Hi, are you shopping for spices?
:{{DIcon}} About Azalai's order...
:'''Jut:''' For this amount... He won't be able to buy much. However, my spices are worth a lot of Mora.
:'''Jut:''' Well... Since it's his order, I'll add my two cents. As a friend, I don't really recommend him to buy from me.
:'''Jut:''' From what I gathered about business in Aaru Village... I'd say that "selling more at a lower price point" is the way to go.
:'''Jut:''' Simply put, it's about selling goods of passable quality for a relatively low price, and selling large quantities fast as a way to make a quick return on the invested capital.
:'''Jut:''' Conversely, if he tries to sell expensive high-quality goods in Aaru Village, the return will be slow.
:'''Jut:''' But this is just my opinion. It's up to him what kind of goods he decides to sell.
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to order from you.
::'''Jut:''' Alright. I'll go prepare the goods then.
:;(Obtain [[Jut's Receipt]])
:;(Proceeds to next quest step)
:{{DIcon}} I'll try my luck elsewhere.
::'''Jut:''' All good. If you still want to order from me, feel free to come back anytime.

;(Talk to Jut again)
:'''Jut:''' How's it going? Made up your mind yet?
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to order from you.
::'''Jut:''' Alright. I'll go prepare the goods then.
:;(Obtain [[Jut's Receipt]])
:;(Proceeds to next quest step)
:{{DIcon}} I'll try my luck elsewhere.
::'''Jut:''' I understand. We're talking about no small sums. Careful consideration is highly advised, indeed.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dried Fish Version===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Azalai:''' I've been wanting to source some Dried Fish and need someone to place an order for me... Could you assist me with this?
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
:{{DIcon}} I thought everyone would dry fish on their own...
::'''Azalai:''' Hahaha... Trust me, Traveler. Drying fish out in the desert is not a good idea...
:'''Azalai:''' Let me see... {{color|buzzword|Butrus'}} Dried Fish are fairly priced and the taste is... acceptable.
:'''Azalai:''' {{color|buzzword|Jahangir}} has been using a new Dried Fish recipe recently &mdash; people say that the flavor is really good thanks to all the spices.
:'''Azalai:''' I'd like to give them a shot, just to see if there's any demand, but I'm not sure about the price point...
:'''Azalai:''' But my budget for this purchase is limited, so deciding which supplier to choose isn't going to be easy...
:'''Azalai:''' Traveler, please check out both suppliers and pick one to place an order with.
:'''Azalai:''' Oh, one more thing. Whenever I commissioned someone to place an order for me in the past, I'd ask them to look for a relatively cheap price point.
:'''Azalai:''' I'd like you to do the same. Please remember to look for the cheaper supplier.
:'''Azalai:''' The business strategy that's been working in Aaru Village so far is "selling more at a lower profit margin."
:'''Azalai:''' I'm counting on you, Traveler.
:{{DIcon}} I'll check out what {{color|buzzword|Butrus}} has to offer first...
:{{DIcon}} I'll check out what {{color|buzzword|Jahangir}} has to offer first...
:'''Azalai:''' Thank you in advance. I'll mark his location on the map for you.
:'''Azalai:''' Alright, come back anytime if you have any additional questions
:;(Obtain [[Azalai's Payment]])

;(Talk to Azalai again)
:'''Azalai:''' How did it go? Have you placed an order yet?
:{{DIcon}} About {{color|buzzword|Butrus'}} location...
:{{DIcon}} About {{color|buzzword|Jahangir's}} location...
:'''Azalai:''' You can't find his exact location? Okay... I'll mark that spot on the map for you.
:'''Azalai:''' You should be good to go now. I'm counting on you, Traveler.
----

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Butrus, optional)
:'''Butrus:''' (I need to make more Dried Fish.)

;(Talk to Butrus)
:'''Butrus:''' Welcome! Are you looking for fish? Then you've come to the right place! There are no fish fresher than mine. Ask that cat over there if you don't believe me.
:{{DIcon}} About Azalai's order...
:'''Butrus:''' Huh... Azalai is looking to source some Dried Fish from me? No worries.
:'''Butrus:''' This amount of Mora is enough to buy a large quantity of Dried Fish. It should last him for a while.
:'''Butrus:''' Though my Dried Fish is... well... faithful to the original flavor! No spices or anything like that.
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to place my order here.
::'''Butrus:''' Alright! Hehe... I'll go pick out some Dried Fish and get someone to deliver his order to him in a bit.
:;(Obtain [[Butrus' Receipt]])
:;(Proceeds to next quest step)
:{{DIcon}} I'll try my luck elsewhere.
::'''Butrus:''' Huh? Fine... Go ahead and compare prices.
::'''Butrus:''' But I can't really afford to give you another discount. I won't make any profit otherwise.

;(Talk to Butrus again)
:'''Butrus:''' What say you? Want to order Dried Fish from me?
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to place my order here.
::'''Butrus:''' Alright! Hehe... I'll go pick out some Dried Fish and get someone to deliver his order to him in a bit.
:;(Obtain [[Butrus' Receipt]])
:;(Proceeds to next quest step)
:{{DIcon}} I'll try my luck elsewhere.
::'''Butrus:''' Don't be too long or there won't be any Dried Fish left.
----

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Jahangir, optional)
:'''Jahangir:''' (I'm exhausted. I need to get some rest later...)

;(Talk to Jahangir)
:'''Jahangir:''' Welcome! Would you like to have a bite? Everything's freshly made.
:{{DIcon}} About Azalai's order...
:'''Jahangir:''' Ahaha, sure! I told him my Dried Fish is famous far and wide and will definitely sell for a good price.
:'''Jahangir:''' This amount of Mora will get you some Dried Fish. Just say the word and I'll make a fresh batch for you.
:{{DIcon}} You'll start drying it now?
:'''Jahangir:''' Of course not! What I meant was going to my warehouse to take the Dried Fish out and seasoning them to elevate their flavor profile.
:'''Jahangir:''' Wait a minute... With the cost considered, you won't be able to buy that much Dried Fish after all.
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to place my order here.
::'''Jahangir:''' Okay! I'll send one of my employees to deliver the order when I'm done making Dried Fish.
:;(Obtain [[Jahangir's Receipt]])
:;(Proceeds to next quest step)
:{{DIcon}} I&mdash;I'm going to look elsewhere...
::'''Jahangir:''' Huh? No need to rush, the price is negotiable. Besides, you won't find such tasty Dried Fish anywhere else!

;(Talk to Jahangir again)
:'''Jahangir:''' Hey, have you decided yet? One word and I'll start prepping the everything.
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to place my order here.
::'''Jahangir:''' Okay! I'll send one of my employees to deliver the order when I'm done making Dried Fish.
:;(Obtain [[Jahangir's Receipt]])
:;(Proceeds to next quest step)
:{{DIcon}} I&mdash;I'm going to look elsewhere...
::'''Jahangir:''' Huh? Didn't I say you wouldn't find such tasty Dried Fish elsewhere? There's not much to think about...
{{Dialogue end}}

===Ending===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Azalai)
:'''Azalai:''' How's it going, Traveler? Did you place the order for me?
:{{DIcon}} I did.
:;(Opens item selection screen)

:'''You bring Azalai up to speed on sourcing goods'''

;(If [[Rama's Receipt]] was submitted)
::'''Azalai:''' Hm... Ordered from Rama's? Should be alright.
::'''Azalai:''' Her spices are both cheap and of good quality, very popular with the people of this village. Once they arrive, selling them shouldn't be a problem.
::Thanks for your help, Traveler. This is your remuneration. And this Mora, please take it along, too.
::'''Azalai:''' That miser Rama though... I've ordered so many times from her, and she never gave me a discount.
;(If [[Jut's Receipt]] was submitted)
::'''Azalai:''' Ordered from Jut's? Are the prices high? Well, I'll have to raise my price point to match the cost then.
::'''Azalai:''' But these spices seem to be of very high quality. I should not worry about selling them...
::'''Azalai:''' By the way, Traveler, this is your remuneration.

;(If [[Butrus' Receipt]] was submitted)
::'''Azalai:''' I see, the quality of Butrus' Dried Fish is always reliable, and the quantity... not bad at all.
::'''Azalai:''' When the goods arrive, I'll have to send some to doctor [[Maruf]] as thanks for treating my leg injury last time.
::'''Azalai:''' There's also Raef and [[Fodil]], they helped me unload cargo...
::'''Azalai:''' Ahem! Thanks for your help, Traveler. This is your remuneration. And this Mora, please take it along, too.
::'''Azalai:''' Fortunately, you ordered from Butrus. Giving some Dried Fish away shouldn't be a problem considering the order quantity.
;(If [[Jahangir's Receipt]] was submitted)
::'''Azalai:''' Purchased from Jahangir? The price is... *gasp* How can it be so pricey? What spices does he use? Mora itself?
::'''Azalai:''' It's nothing I can't handle. Worst case scenario, I'll cut the Dried Fish up and sell it that way.
::'''Azalai:''' Ah... Um, here is your payment, Traveler. Thank you for your help.
::'''Azalai:''' How many pieces can these be cut into?
