:'''Qiongjiu:''' I don't think I've seen you before... Did you come from [[Yilong Wharf]]? Do you know how to make jadeware?
:{{DIcon}} Well, I really don't...
::'''Qiongjiu:''' Oh... What a pity. That's the most interesting thing in the world.
::'''Qiongjiu:''' *sigh* If only I could reel some in while fishing...
::{{DIcon}} Why would you even think that...
::'''Qiongjiu:''' If I could fish up some jade while fishing, then I could play with [[Muli]] every day...
::'''Qiongjiu:''' Even though fishing is fun, making jadeware is more interesting still.
::'''Qiongjiu:''' But if I don't put in the effort and practice fishing as my family wants, my parents' techniques will be lost forever.
::'''Qiongjiu:''' If only [[Little Mao]] was willing to learn how to fish...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Qiongjiu:''' Well then, goodbye.
