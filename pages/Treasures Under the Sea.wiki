{{Quest Description|You run into Ulman again in the Court of Fontaine...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Ulman)
:'''Ulman:''' C'mon, little one, I really don't know how to dive. Look! I don't even have a divesuit.
:'''Ulman:''' *sigh*... No matter how much you jump and dance, I still can't follow you down there...
:{{DIcon}} Ulman! You came to Fontaine too?
:{{DIcon}} Looks like your "Seelie magnetism" is as strong as ever.
:'''Ulman:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon! Fancy meeting you here again, of all places. Quite the coincidence.
:'''Paimon:''' You haven't changed a bit! Still popular with the Seelies. And... it looks like you're getting better and better at communicating with them!
:{{DIcon}} Translate what the Seelie is saying for me, please.
:'''Ulman:''' *sigh* Please don't make fun of me. I don't have a clue what it's trying to say.
:'''Ulman:''' I just came here to do some business and decided to take a stroll by the water. Suddenly a Seelie started following me out of nowhere... again.
:'''Ulman:''' I'm used to this sort of thing by now, so I followed it. Up hill and down dale, I even had to row a boat for a bit.
:'''Ulman:''' Normally, they start bouncing around to tell me "something's buried here!"
:'''Ulman:''' But... It keeps diving into the water, deeper and deeper...
:'''Ulman:''' But I haven't got a clue how to dive! I've heard other people saying that the waters here not only have powerful currents, but also all kinds of other dangers... All I can do is sit here on my little boat, waiting for it to return.
:'''Ulman:''' But that little guy is still leading me to place after place... I really want it to know that I really don't know how to dive...
:{{DIcon}} Ah, so you're enjoying the unique Fontaine experience?
::'''Ulman:''' Totally and completely. A friendly, passionate, kind nation that you never ever feel like leaving. Ha. Ha. Ha.
:{{DIcon}} I would have thought you were used to monsters by now.
::'''Ulman:''' I am indeed! But at least when I run into them on land, I can turn tail and run. Underwater, I haven't a hope of swimming away!
:'''Paimon:''' Sounds like you're about to ask us for help again, aren't you?
:'''Ulman:''' Yes, yes! Oh, thank the Archons, you haven't yet been influenced by the local customs here too much, you still speak so directly and clearly!
:'''Ulman:''' The dramatic, flowery way some Fontainians talk, I just can't take it anymore!
:'''Ulman:''' Every twenty words, there's two respectful terms of address, three metaphors, and six adjectives...
:{{DIcon}} I always get straight to the point.
:{{DIcon}} I, being naught but a humble Traveler, have not yet achieved such incredible feats of rhetorical mastery.
:'''Ulman:''' Gah! ...I feel like even I'm starting to get influenced... Come on! Take this notebook, I've marked the spots where the little guy has taken me.
:'''Ulman:''' Just like before, find the Ancient Iron Coins, bring them to me, and I'll buy them off of you at an excellent price.
:'''Ulman:''' Always a pleasure working with you and Paimon.
