==Gameplay Notes==
*Toratarou is guarded by a [[Nobushi]].
*Freeing Toratarou grants players the {{Achievement|Who Let the Dogs Out}}.
*It is possible to feed Toratarou {{item|Fowl|x=1}} before or immediately after freeing him. Doing so has no impact on gameplay.
*The chest spawns only after opening the cage.
*Toratarou will despawn if the player teleports somewhere else; similarly, the bowl in Toratarou's cage will also disappear.
