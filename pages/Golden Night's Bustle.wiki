{{Description|An ancient silver urn that was once filled with fine wine as red as rubies. Now, it contains nothing but bitter seawater.}}
'''Golden Night's Bustle''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Golden Troupe]].

==Description==
The peaceful sea surged, sending the ship sliding between the silent manor and the temple.<br>
Under the pale moonlight, the [[Domus Aurea|golden dome]] that had seemed so glorious in the daytime lost its luster.

The [[Remus|God King]] awoke with a start from his majestic dream. The clear starlight had fled.<br>
Violence and estrangement formed a darkness deeper than darkness, shrouding the great dome.<br>
In terror and remorse did he summon to him his most loyal guards and most attuned musicians,<br>
And he gave them his [[Whisper of Domus Aurea|final orders]], intending to bring peace back to the fractured lands...

Yet, just as a flood unleashed cannot be held back, the deeply ingrained arrogance and prejudice could not be reversed in a night, and crushed the Harmosts and rulers...<br>
All the noble sacrifices, all the unselfish plans &mdash; all fell to ruin at the hands of the [[Phobos|wicked]], and all came crashing down in the end.<br>
Whether the barbaric armies of the [[Scylla|Fell Dragon Prince]], or the God King determined to the last to save the empire,<br>
They were swept away by an inexorable storm &mdash; even the luxurious palace and the jade-green manor were consigned to destruction together...<br>
Without the guiding golden song, the once-noble people of the [[Remuria|glorious kingdom]] transformed into disfigured [[Praetorian Golem|golems]]...

When the final cacophony of the golden night faded to calm, the Harmost [[Boethius]] lay amidst the rubble,<br>
Only the rubble heard his insensate mumblings, and only the debris recorded the sin of treachery...

"In a moment of madness, he betrayed us all."<br>
"Order will not easily change, nor will human regrets."
