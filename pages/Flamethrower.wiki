'''Flamethrowers''' are a type of [[Obstacle]] that shoots out flames that deal {{Color|Pyro DMG}} to the player.

These can be activated with switches or monuments or can be always on. They can be temporarily deactivated by inflicting {{Cryo}} on the monument, or avoided by simply climbing over them.

Sometimes flamethrowers are stationary. Other times they are seen rotating in a group.

==Domains==
* Flamethrowers are first seen in [[Crash Course]], Kaeya's tutorial domain, but appear in various domains throughout Mondstadt, including:
** [[Retrieve the Holy Lyre der Himmel]] ({{Quest|Chasing Shadows}})
** [[Behind Enemy Lines]] ({{Quest|Through the Motions, to the Heart}})

==Tutorial==
{{Tutorial

|text1   = A flamethrower's core is what gives it the energy to shoot fire.
|image2  = Tutorial Kaeya 4.png
|text2   = Use {{Color|help|Cryo Skills}} to temporarily disable flamethrowers' cores and stop them from shooting fire.
}}

==Trivia==
* One must use Cryo to disable them. Using Hydro does not work.
* Flamethrowers always reactivate after a few seconds, even if the Cryo application that deactivated them is a long-lasting Cryo application.
