:'''Dr. Livingstone:''' Hmm? Pardon me, I was lost in thought.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Sword Cemetery...
::'''Dr. Livingstone:''' What the... You've broken the three seals!?
::'''Dr. Livingstone:''' Then... Does that mean you've defeated all three hilichurl tribes too?
::{{DIcon}} Sure does.

::'''Dr. Livingstone:''' Thank you for succeeding where I did not. But I am going to stay here.

:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Dr. Livingstone:''' Be careful!
:{{DIcon|Reward}} Are you an adventurer?
::'''Dr. Livingstone:''' I certainly am, though I would be the first to admit that my appearance is more that of a scholar... Nevertheless, my principle occupation is indeed adventuring.
