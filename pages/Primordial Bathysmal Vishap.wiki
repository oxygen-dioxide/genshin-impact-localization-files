==Abilities==
''Ability names are unofficial except for Cleansing Shower.''

===Normal===
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Cleansing Shower
|desc_1 = Forms an orb within their mouth and launches it at the player. On hit, the orb deals '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}} and drains 10 [[Energy]] from the active character. If the active character has less than 10 Energy, inflicts [[HP Loss]].
* The HP Loss is calculated as:<br><math>\begin{align} \text{HP Loss} = {} & ( 14 \% \times \text{Max HP}_\text{Character} + 200 ) \\
& \times ( 1 - \frac{\text{Remaining Energy}}{10} ) \end{align}</math>

|name_2 = Spinning Sweep
|desc_2 = Curls up and quickly spins, dealing '''30% ATK * 2''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}}.

|name_3 = Waterwheels
|desc_3 = Forms 3 wheels of water at the tip of its tail before launching them at the player in a wide spread, dealing '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}} along their paths.

|name_4 = Spike Field
|desc_4 = Plugs its tail into the ground, creating a large field around it within which water splashes from the ground at random locations, dealing '''60% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}}. The player will be targeted by one of these once every 2 seconds if within the field.

|name_5 = Slash Combo
|desc_5 = If the player is within melee range, performs 2 horizontal slashes followed by a downward smash, dealing '''30% ATK''', '''50% ATK''', '''80% ATK''' respectively as {{Color|Physical DMG}} with each hit.
}}

====AI Logic====
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Global CD is shared with other Primordial Bathysmal Vishaps and certain [[Slimes]] that utilize ranged attacks.

|name_1 = Cleansing Shower
|desc_1 = Launches 3 orbs. On hit, an orb deals '''20% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}} and drains 30 [[Energy]] from the active character. If the active character has less than 30 Energy, inflicts [[HP Loss]].
* The HP Loss is calculated as:<br><math>\begin{align} \text{HP Loss} = {} & ( 20 \% \times \text{Max HP}_\text{Character} + 200 ) \\
& \times ( 1 - \frac{\text{Remaining Energy}}{30} ) \end{align}</math>

|name_2 = Cleansing Burst
|desc_2 = Launches 6 orbs in quick succession. On hit, an orb deals '''20% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}} and drains 20 Energy from the active character. If the active character has less than 20 Energy, inflicts HP Loss.
* The HP Loss is calculated as:<br><math>\begin{align} \text{HP Loss} = {} & ( 15 \% \times \text{Max HP}_\text{Character} + 150 ) \\
& \times ( 1 - \frac{\text{Remaining Energy}}{20} ) \end{align}</math>

|name_3 = Cleansing Field
|desc_3 = Gains a {{Hydro}} shield and summons a field with a '''6.5m''' radius around itself, increasing all RES by 80%.
* Every 0.5 seconds, the field will drain 10 Energy from active characters within it. If the active character has less than 10 Energy, inflicts HP Loss.
** The HP Loss is calculated as:<br><math>\begin{align} \text{HP Loss} = {} & ( 10 \% \times \text{Max HP}_\text{Character} + 100 ) \\
& \times ( 1 - \frac{\text{Remaining Energy}}{10} ) \end{align}</math>
* The shield can be destroyed using [[Elemental Reaction]]s and is weakest to {{Dendro}}. When destroyed, the Bathysmal Vishap will be paralyzed for a short duration, and both the field and increased RES are removed. {{Elemental Shield Data|Hydro|16}}
