==Abilities and Attacks==
''Attack names are unofficial except for Cleansing Shower.''

{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Cleansing Shower
|desc_1 = Forms an orb within their mouth and launches it at the player. On hit, the orb deals '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}} and drains 10 [[Energy]] from the active character. If the active character has less than 10 Energy, inflicts [[HP Loss]].
* The HP Loss is calculated as:<br /><math>\begin{align} \text{HP Loss} = {} & ( 14 \% \times \text{Max HP}_\text{Character} + 200 ) \\
& \times ( 1 - \frac{\text{Remaining Energy}}{10} ) \end{align}</math>

|name_2 = Spinning Sweep
|desc_2 = Curls up and quickly spins, dealing '''30% ATK * 2''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}.

|name_3 = Waterwheels
|desc_3 = Forms 3 wheels of water at the tip of its tail before launching them in an arc at the player, dealing '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}} along their paths.

|name_4 = Spike Field
|desc_4 = Plugs its tail into the ground, creating a large field, within which water splashes from the ground at random locations, dealing '''60% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}.

|name_5 = Slash Combo
|desc_5 = If the player is within melee range, performs 2 horizontal slashes followed by a downward smash, dealing '''30% ATK''', '''50% ATK''', '''80% ATK''' respectively as {{Color|Physical DMG}} with each hit.

===AI Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Global CD is shared with other Primordial Bathysmal Vishaps and certain [[Slimes]] that utilize ranged attacks.

{{Description|A vishap that dwells deep beneath the oceans.<br />They were once the dominant race in the depths - and indeed, dragons were the overlords of the whole world in an even earlier age. But their former seven Sovereigns were defeated by a power from the heavens, withering one by one.|[[Archive]]}}
