{{Quote|The [[Cataclysm|destruction]] of the nation of [[Khaenri'ah]] by the gods... is the reason why the Abyss Order now seeks to destroy the nations watched over by [[The Seven]].|[[Dainsleif]]|in ''[[Dishonorable Trial]]''}}
The '''Abyss Order''' is a mysterious, powerful legion of monsters from the [[Abyss]] who are the enemies of both humanity and surface civilization, and thrive in many corners of [[Teyvat]]. They are one of the two primary antagonistic factions alongside the [[Fatui]] in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''.

==Description==
The Abyss Order was founded by [[Chlothar|Chlothar Alberich]], a noble in the [[Alberich Clan|Alberich royal family]]. Some time after the [[cataclysm]], he encountered a "[[Vedrfolnir|Sinner]]" and was greatly awed by its power. He would then go on to establish the Abyss Order. In his ramblings, he addressed the [[Traveler's Sibling]] as the "Prince/Princess" of the Abyss Order, somehow aware that they would eventually become its leader.<ref name="caribert">{{Ref/Quest|Caribert}}</ref>

The Abyss Order's size, membership, hierarchy, and degree of power are unknown. Because most members reside in the Abyss, little is actually known about them by Teyvat, other than that they hold a strong hatred against the people of the seven nations and their [[Archons]], and desire to overthrow the world ruled by the Archons. Many, if not all members were originally from [[Khaenri'ah]] prior to being cursed.

Members of the Abyss Order are generally perceived as any intelligent humanoid being, such as [[Abyss Lector]]s/[[Abyss Herald|Heralds]] and [[Iniquitous Baptist]]s. It should be noted that not all of these beings are members of the Abyss Order, such as [[Jakob]], a neohuman who takes the form of an Iniquitous Baptist (and shows disdain towards the organization), a [[Abyss Herald: Frost Fall|Cryo Abyss Herald]] that the Traveler's sibling encountered before the Abyss Order was founded,<ref name="caribert" /> and an [[Abyss Lector: Violet Lightning|Electro Abyss Lector]] that [[Burkina]] fought during the [[cataclysm]].<ref>{{Quest|A Hero's Rite}}</ref>

There is an "inner circle" in the Order that is close to the Traveler's Sibling, though the purpose or members of this group is currently unknown.

===The Loom of Fate===
The '''Loom of Fate''' is an ongoing operation that the Abyss Order is undertaking. The name was first used by Chlothar a few centuries prior to the events of the game to describe his son [[Caribert (NPC)|Caribert]]; he claimed that Caribert had become the "Loom of Fate" after being imbued with Abyssal power, and would be able to weave his destiny anew.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Portended Fate}}</ref> Before the Traveler arrived at [[Fontaine]], the term refers to attempts by the Abyss Order to construct a mechanical [[god]].<ref name="herald">{{Ref/Quest|A Herald Without Adherents}}</ref>

Following the destruction of the Divine Throne of Hydro, the Loom of Fate now refers to a powerful device that when fully operational, is able to weave its own [[Ley Line]]s into the planet. While incomplete it was able to weave new memories, a function Caribert used to calm the [[hilichurl]]s around [[Vimara Village]] and implant false memories of him living with the village's inhabitants to enjoy the life that he was never able to live. Upon completion it lost this function. The Traveler's sibling is currently attempting to fully activate the device before the [[Heavenly Principles]] awaken.<ref name="narration">{{Ref/Quest|World-Order Narration}}</ref>

===Hilichurls===
{{Main|Hilichurls}}
The Abyss Order usually conscripts [[Hilichurls]] to do their work. Most were former citizens of Khaenri'ah who were originally from the lands of the gods and relocated there. When Khaenri'ah fell, they were cursed with the "wilderness" and transformed into hilichurls.<ref name="caribert" />

Because many hilichurls are cursed citizens from the destroyed nation of [[Khaenri'ah]], the Abyss Order and the Traveler's sibling hope to cleanse the curse from the hilichurls so that they may either "return to the natural cycle of life and death as soon as possible" or, according to [[Dainsleif]], become the foundation for the to-be-rebuilt Khaenri'ah if they are successfully cleansed.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Memories of Inteyvat}}</ref>

==Story==
Around 500 years ago, the fall of the [[Eclipse Dynasty]] led to a cataclysm that destroyed [[Khaenri'ah]].<ref>{{Ref/Book|Breeze Amidst the Forest|1|title=Ballad Selection Excerpt}}</ref> Sometime after the fall of Khaenri'ah, Chlothar and his transformed son [[Caribert (NPC)|Caribert]] moved to [[Avidya Forest]] for the latter's medical treatment. He met the [[Traveler's Sibling]], and together they discovered the "[[Vedrfolnir|Sinner]]", a chained crystal hidden within the [[Unknown Sanctuary]]. The Sinner imbued Chlothar with Abyssal power, allowing him to restore Caribert's sentience. Chlothar concluded that the power of the Abyss was able to do what the Seven could not and reverse the Khaenri'ahn curse. Inspired, he began to worship the Sinner and eventually founded the Abyss Order, appointing the sibling as his "Prince/Princess." The sibling, while disturbed by his ramblings, soon learned the truth of Teyvat and became disillusioned, joining the Abyss Order after finishing their travels.<ref name="caribert" />

The sibling is revered by the Abyss Order, who address them as "Prince/Princess" of the Abyss.

In the beginning of the game, the Abyss Order takes advantage of [[Dvalin]] to incite him to destroy [[Mondstadt]]. However, [[Venti]] and the [[Traveler]] are able to purify the Abyssal poison in his veins and restore his sanity.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Long Shot}}</ref>

[[File:Defiled Statue.png|thumb|''Defiled Statue''.]]
After, the Abyss Order attempted to execute their Loom of Fate operation. To this end, they planned to use the ancient technology within the "[[Ruin Guard|Field Tillers]]" from Khaenri'ah, searching through the many Ruin Guards littered throughout Teyvat hoping to find the eye of the very first one. They intended to use both the [[Defiled Statue]] underneath [[Mt. Aocang]] and the eye on [[Osial]] to create a mechanized god they could control. However, the Traveler and Dainsleif found the first Field Tiller's eye at [[Stormterror's Lair]] before the Abyss Order could, and Dainsleif opted to keep it with him rather than entrust it to another party.<ref name="herald" />

A group led by [[Enjou]] would later arrive in [[Enkanomiya]] to look for the book ''[[Before Sun and Moon]]'', which would serve as proof that [[Celestia]] came from beyond Teyvat. Due to an unrelated situation on [[Watatsumi Island]], the Traveler would descend into Enkanomiya, resulting in the operation failing with a large amount of casualties. Later on, Enjou would negotiate with the [[Bathysmal Vishap]] to engulf Enkanomiya in darkness so they could rescue their kin inside the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]]. This appeared to serve no useful meaning, since Enjou had no real reason to help the [[vishap]]s.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Three Realms Gateway Offering: Aftermath}}</ref>

The Abyss Order became aware of an unusual pool of water in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines|the Chasm]] that would subdue the effects of the curse placed upon them. The Traveler's sibling, determined to reverse the curse, authorized an experimental device that would supposedly amplify the water's effects &mdash; this was despite its low chance of success and the high chance of causing undue suffering to the hilichurls. The operation was foiled by both Dainsleif and the Traveler, the former having been accidentally been sent to the Chasm and the latter investigating unusual hilichurl activity.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|In the Depths, an Unexpected Reunion}}</ref>

Sometime after the events of the [[Sumeru]] [[Archon Quest]]s, the Abyss Order began to meddle with the [[Ley Line]]s around [[Avidya Forest]] for reasons unknown. Dainsleif manages to put a stop to it, though the Ley Line disruption allowed the Traveler to relive their sibling's time with Chlothar in the same location centuries ago.<ref name="caribert" />

Roughly 500 years ago in Sumeru, a descendant of [[Hadura]], [[Klingsor]], became enthralled by the powers of the Abyss and learned of some of the truths he had suspected were hidden from him by the [[Order of Skeptics|Skeptics]]. He led a group of Abyss Order members and monsters to attack [[Vourukasha Oasis]] to obtain the [[Great Song of Khvarena|Great Songs of Khvarena]] in order to break the seal over the [[Harvisptokhm]], though they were ultimately pushed back by the [[Pari]] and the Skeptics. He was still persistent, and later convinced the current head of the Skeptics, [[Nasejuna]], to help him break the seal. They convinced the [[Pari]] [[Sorush]] that she would need the songs and sacrifice herself to do so, but the plot was foiled by the Traveler, who had stumbled upon the Pari and agreed to help, while harboring suspicion towards Nasejuna due to his behavior while obtaining the songs and reinforcing the seal.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Khvarena of Good and Evil}}</ref>

After the Divine Throne of Hydro was destroyed by [[Focalors]], the Traveler's sibling noted that despite the flagrant disregard for the "rules", the Heavenly Principles did not react, concluding that they had a "situation" of their own up above. Continuing the Loom of Fate operation, Caribert's consciousness manages to fool Dainsleif into believing that he had given the eye of the Field Tiller, prompting him and the Traveler to check the ruins to see if he had done so. The Traveler's sibling, along with a [[Abyss Herald: Frost Fall]], ambush the pair and begin tampering with the Ley Lines, prompting Dainsleif to send the Traveler away. The sibling then confronts Dainsleif and manages to injure him in the ensuing fight, while the Traveler discovers Caribert and enters his mind realm. Caribert explains the purpose and nature of the Loom of Fate before he expires, while the Traveler's sibling also runs into the realm and reunites with the Traveler, explaining their motives and reasonings to them before they are forced to leave when the space collapses. The sibling manages to recover the eye from Dainsleif (who had hidden it in his body), allowing the operation to continue as planned, with the sibling hoping that they could fully activate the Loom of Fate before the Heavenly Principles awakened.<ref name="narration" />

Enjou would later travel to [[Natlan]] in order to study lore about the [[Turnfire]] and [[Mare Jivari]], where he would negotiate a deal with [[Kinich]] to do his "historical research" in return for summoning a [[Beastly Rift]] for him. Kinich intended to use the rift in order to place a severely deteriorating [[Kongamato]] in it for both it and his tribe's safety. Secretly, Enjou struck a deal with [[Ajaw]] to claim his body, though this was actually a ploy Kinich and Ajaw had set up in order to lure Enjou to the Traveler, as Kinich was aware they sought information regarding the Abyss Order. While the lure worked, Kinich had not been aware that the two had known each other and Enjou left after a short conversation with them.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|I, Flame Bearer}}</ref>

==Notes==
* Background stories that may be related to the Abyss Order are told in some artifact set and weapon lores &mdash; notably that of [[Arundolyn]], Grand Master of the [[Knights of Favonius]], who led an expedition against the monsters that spewed forth from Khaenri'ah. While he survived, his friend and companion [[Rostam]] perished in battle.<ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Brave Heart}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Ferrous Shadow|Description}}</ref>
** Rostam was mentor to a person known as the White Knight, later known as the [[Bloodstained Knight]]. After his violent path caused others to shun him, he continued his battle against the monsters in Khaenri'ah and ultimately perished. After death, however, he learned about the injustice behind Khaenri'ah's destruction, that caused the people of the land to be cursed and become monsters.<ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Bloodstained Chivalry}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Weapon|The Black Sword|Lore}}</ref>
