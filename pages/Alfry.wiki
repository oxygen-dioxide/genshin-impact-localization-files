==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Alfry:''' Hey! Alfry here, from the Adventurers' Guild Intelligence Department.
:'''Alfry:''' Got any intel you can share with me?
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to ask about something.
::'''Alfry:''' Ask away. Helping Guild members is also our duty.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Adventurers' Guild.
:::'''Alfry:''' Ad astra abyssosque!
:::'''Alfry:''' Roughly speaking, we are a hub for adventurous friends who resolve all kinds of troubles for the people or organizations.
:::'''Alfry:''' We need to put food on the table, of course. So there will be rewards for completing commissions.
:::'''Alfry:''' [[Katheryne]] at reception takes care of visitors.
:::'''Alfry:''' Since you're interested, please pay them a visit!
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about yourself.
:::'''Alfry:''' Me? I'm just an average person.
:::'''Alfry:''' Well... unless knowing everyone in [[Teyvat]] is something to talk about.
:::'''Alfry:''' It's not that incredible... The info came mostly from the resources of the Intelligence Department of Adventurers' Guild.
:::'''Alfry:''' I'm also a member of the Intelligence Department. Aside from contacting and guiding, gathering information is also part of my job.
:::'''Alfry:''' We've chatted for so long. I guess I can say we're friends now?
:::'''Alfry:''' Come on, tell me something about you!
::{{DIcon}} About the Intelligence Department...
:::'''Alfry:''' The Intelligence Department does not take part in commissions most of the time. We help adventurers to complete commissions by providing them with information.
:::'''Alfry:''' In simple terms, our functions can be divided into "collection" and "organization."
:::'''Alfry:''' Our field staff, known as investigators, handle the collection of information. An example is [[Fischl]] &mdash; she is an exceptional investigator.
:::'''Alfry:''' Others, like me, remain at the back-end and organize the information we have collected, before providing it to adventurers.
:::'''Alfry:''' So you can say that the success of adventurers and the Intelligence Division's work are joined at the hip.
:{{DIcon}} Have you ever met someone who looks like me?
::'''Alfry:''' I know about you. You're the outlander who's just arrived in [[Mondstadt]], right? I've had my eye on you since your arrival.
::'''Alfry:''' So you mean to say that there is another person like you? Another traveler from a faraway land?
::'''Alfry:''' ...How strange. To think that there were people in Teyvat who I had no knowledge of...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Alfry:''' Oh, you don't need my help?
