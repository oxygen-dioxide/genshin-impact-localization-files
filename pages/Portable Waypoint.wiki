The '''Portable Waypoint''' is a consumable [[gadget]] that can be created through [[alchemy]]. The [[Instructions: Portable Waypoint|instructions]] can be obtained by reaching [[Reputation]] Level 6 in [[Mondstadt]].

It allows the user to create a temporary teleport waypoint in their current location that lasts for 7 days, which can also be used by any guests during [[Co-Op Mode]]. When attempting to use the gadget midair, in [[Domains]], or in bodies of water, the player will be prompted with the "Cannot use in current state" message. If the usage is invalid, the gadget is not consumed.

Attempting to deploy another portable waypoint, while one is currently active, will show a window asking the player for confirmation. Proceeding will result in the previous waypoint being deleted.

Once placed it appears as {{Icon|Portable Waypoint Map|30}} on the [[Map]].

==Usage and Adjustment==
This gadget is relatively cheap to craft (for players who have reached the point in which they are able to unlock the blueprint), and essentially allows a player to teleport to a location, so as long as the player remembers to replace it every week. It is a one-use consumable item.

See the [[Portable Waypoint#Notes|notes]] section for more info before using.

==Gameplay Notes==
* Creating a Portable Waypoint for the first time unlocks a new archive entry, and like all new archive entries, clicking on the pop-up grants you 1 Primogem.
* Unlike regular [[Teleport Waypoints|Waypoints]], Portable Waypoints bring you inside their (non-rigid) entity, in the exact position it was placed, with the player facing the direction they were facing when the Waypoint was placed.
** It is possible to place a Portable Waypoint on water by first freezing the water and then deploying the gadget. Upon teleporting to the Waypoint, your character will immediately fall in the water.
** If a Waypoint is created in a location that stops existing for any reason (such as event-exclusive locations), the Waypoint can still be teleported to &mdash; however, depending on the Waypoint's position, you will end up falling due to the ground you originally stood on no longer existing.
* Teleporting to the Waypoint when nearby will always display the loading screen, rather than the black screen fading in and out.
* This gadget is not refundable/retrievable after it is successfully deployed. Deploying a second Portable Waypoint will delete the previous one and will not refund the cost.
* It cannot be deployed in another player's world while playing in [[Co-Op Mode]].
* Portable Waypoints cannot be deployed in the following maps:
** [[Three Realms Gateway Offering/Area|Three Realms Gateway Offering]] (event-only)
