'''Slime Balloons''' are objects that float in the air with a [[Large Anemo Slime]]. They are usually found in [[quests]] and challenges where the objective is to destroy the balloon before it reaches a certain destination.

Unlike other enemies, hitting the balloon will not generate [[energy]]. However, it is still possible to trigger [[Elemental Reactions]] like [[Vaporize]] or [[Overloaded]] on the balloon to deal increased damage. Moreover, it is possible to freeze the balloon with the [[Frozen]] reaction which will slow the balloon down.

*[[Dangerous Haul]]

==Events==
*[[Moonlight Merriment]]: [[Contraption-Contrived Cooking Course: Part II]]
** Appeared alongside a [[Transport Balloon]]

==Notes==
*It is possible to stand on the balloon and be transported along with it. It is also possible to deal damage to the balloon while standing on it.
*[[Vacuum Field]]s such as [[Venti]]'s [[Wind's Grand Ode]] can damage the balloon but do not displace it.
*It will not be affected by certain player-made [[status]]es such as [[Riptide]], [[Illusory Bubble]], [[Aurous Blaze]], etc.
