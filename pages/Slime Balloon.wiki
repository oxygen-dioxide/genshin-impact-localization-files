'''Slime Balloons''' are objects that float in the air with a [[Large Anemo Slime]]. They are usually found in [[quests]] and challenges where the objective is to destroy the balloon before it reaches a certain destination.

Unlike other enemies, hitting the balloon will not generate [[energy]]. However, it is still possible to trigger [[Elemental Reactions]] like [[Vaporize]] or [[Overloaded]] on the balloon to deal increased damage. Moreover, it is possible to freeze the balloon with the [[Frozen]] reaction which will slow the balloon down.

==Gameplay Notes==
* It is possible to stand on the balloon and be transported along with it. It is also possible to deal damage to the balloon while standing on it.
* [[Vacuum Field]]s cannot displace the balloon.
* It will not be affected by certain player-made [[status]]es such as [[Riptide]], [[Illusory Bubble]], [[Aurous Blaze]], etc.
* It is possible to shred its [[RES]].

==Quests==
*[[Dangerous Haul]]
