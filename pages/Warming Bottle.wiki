The '''Warming Bottle''' is a [[gadget]] that can be used to temporarily create a fake Warming [[Seelie]] at the spot where it is used. It lasts for 5 seconds, long enough to completely remove Sheer Cold, so long as the player stays at the spot. The item will be consumed upon usage.

The blueprint for Warming Bottle is obtained by raising the [[Frostbearing Tree]] Offering to Level 4.

Generally, because [[source of warmth|sources of warmth]] are relatively common in [[Dragonspine]], Warming Bottles are considered less useful than the food item [[Goulash]], which reduces the speed at which [[Sheer Cold]] accumulates.
