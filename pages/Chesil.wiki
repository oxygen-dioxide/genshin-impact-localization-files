===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available prior to completing ''Strange Stone Chronicle (Part 2)''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Chesil:''' Welcome, welcome. Our store offers the most extensive selection of precious gems in the entire Court of Fontaine. We also have the newest ornaments and craft goods for sale.
:'''Chesil:''' Anything here catch your eye?
:{{DIcon}} About the latest ornaments on sale...
::'''Chesil:''' That's got to be the Wings of Oscillation.
::'''Chesil:''' They are modeled after the slim wings of [[Crystalfly|Crystalflies]]. The metallurgical process used to make them is quite unique, and they are encrusted with dazzling gems...
::'''Chesil:''' They say that even the gentlest breeze will cause them to flap like real Crystalfly wings. To say that the Wings of Oscillation have taken high-class society by storm would be an understatement!
::'''Chesil:''' But though everyone loves chasing fads, I'd say that ornaments should be chosen according to their ability to bring out our unique characters.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Chesil:''' We often push out new products, so your patronage is always welcome!

:{{DIcon}} Tell me about clock production...
::'''Chesil:''' Thanks to you, the mass production of the new clock model has been going smoothly, and the ores Ms. [[Puca]] has provided to us have been of high quality.
::'''Chesil:''' Actually, I was planning to make a new batch of clocks designed for [[Melusine]]s based on this model.
::'''Chesil:''' Of course, we'll use a water-resilient clam-style structure &mdash; I'm sure this will be a market-opener!
::'''Chesil:''' The only problem we have is that Ms. Puca doesn't seem to want us to use Mora as collateral for trade...
::'''Chesil:''' I've been racking my brains as to the sort of things she'll take in exchange...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
