:'''Jayant:''' Hello, friend.
:'''Jayant:''' We must've been fated to meet in such a wonderful place.
:{{DIcon}} Right, some destiny.
::'''Jayant:''' Haha, don't say that.
::'''Jayant:''' Even though the waves that flow to the harbor every day may not come from the same sea, the two of us got to meet here. What is it if not a miracle?
::'''Jayant:''' Where are you from? Tell me about yourself.
::'''Jayant:''' I possess a wealth of knowledge and experience. Be it ice fishing in [[Snezhnaya]], or boat rowing in [[Fontaine]], I know it all. In fact, I know a little bit of everything.
::'''Jayant:''' So, we can talk about anything you like.
:{{DIcon}} Learning about me would cost you a fortune.
::'''Jayant:''' Hahaha, I understand. Everyone has their own fate, none less precious than anybody else's.
::'''Jayant:''' But if you really want to put a price on it, I just might be able to afford it.
::'''Jayant:''' If my background were worse, I wouldn't be able to go on the streets and meet people from all walks of life.
::'''Jayant:''' Anyway, you know where to find me. If you ever need a friend, I'm right here waiting.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Jayant:''' Fate shall let us cross paths again.
