{{Description|''Peculiar meteorites are descending upon [[Teyvat]], bringing a rare sleeping sickness with them. People trapped in deep slumber, mysterious dreams, an unknown star... The crisis draws closer!''}}
'''Unreconciled Stars''' is a [[Flagship Events]] during [[Version 1.1]].

==Summary and Requirements==
During the event period, Travelers can complete challenges related to the meteorites, collecting [[Fading Star's Might]] and [[Fading Star's Essence]] and exchanging them for goods at the Shop.

==Event Phases==
===I &mdash; Unknown Star===
{{Main|Unreconciled Stars/Unknown Star|l1=Unknown Star}}
Collect '''Meteorite Shards''' to obtain Fading Star's Might.

When you reach an affected area, the mini-map in the upper left corner of the screen will show the approximate locations of meteorite shards. The meteorite shards will resonate with a nearby character's Vision, causing the Vision to glow. The closer you draw to a shard, the brighter the glowing will become. Once you have found a meteorite shard, you may interact with it to salvage it. Clear away meteorite shards to obtain Fading Star's Might and complete salvage quests in designated regions to claim the corresponding rewards from the event page.

Each quest requires obtaining (a minimum of) 7 '''Meteorite Shards''' out of about ~20 possible ones per area. For locations of each shard, see [[Fading Star's Might#Locations|here]].

===II &mdash; Star of Deceitful Dreams===
{{Main|Unreconciled Stars/Star of Deceitful Dreams|l1=Star of Deceitful Dreams}}
Participate in the '''Meteorite Remains Salvage''' challenge to obtain Fading Star's Might. Requires 20 [[Original Resin]].

Meteorite Remains can be found at Meteorite Strike Zones, which can be pinpointed on the map by speaking to [[Mona]].

===III &mdash; Star of Destiny===
{{main|Unreconciled Stars/Star of Destiny|l1=Star of Destiny}}
Participate in the '''Star of Destiny''' challenge in Single-Player or Co-Op Mode to obtain Fading Star's Essence. Rewards are calculated based on your own [[Adventure Rank#World Level and Ascension|World Level]]. Requires 40 [[Original Resin]].

The largest meteorite to date - or in [[Fischl]]'s words, "the very heart of darkness. " The energy it secretes draws the attention of monsters and evildoers alike. It is located in [[Falcon Coast]], [[Mondstadt]].

===IV &mdash; Where Ancient Stars Align===
{{main|Where Ancient Stars Align}}
''The meteorites that have rained down were once, in fact, part of someone's constellation. Why did this ancient array of stars fall from the sky? What goal were their extinguished flames chasing? Armed with the courage to face the answers, you march onward.''

This Event Quest was released on November 26, 2020, and concludes the narration of the event.
