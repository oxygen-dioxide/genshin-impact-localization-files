==Lore==
...<br />
...An [[Traveler|outlander]] with a [[Paimon|chatty little fairy]] arrived on the island. They really came at a bad time...<br />
...<br />
...Thanks to that outlander's help, my research has been fast-tracked. I never would've believed that things would go so smoothly...<br />
...Next, [[Yasumoto|I]] will travel to the southern shoals of [[Yashiori Island]] to test the effects of the medicine once more. This time, I will be using the full dose...<br />
...Whatever happens, I want to thank everyone for their help...
