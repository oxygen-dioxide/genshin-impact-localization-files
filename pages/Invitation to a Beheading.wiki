'''Invitation to a Beheading''' is [[Arlecchino]]'s [[Normal Attack]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* Unlike all other [[Polearm]] users, Arlecchino's Charged Attack is not preceded by a Normal Attack.
* The third hit of Arlecchino's Normal Attack will pull enemies towards her.
* If Arlecchino wields any other polearm other than [[Crimson Moon's Semblance]], her polearm will have a yellow scythe blade starting from the second hit of her Normal Attack combo.
* While holding her Charged Attack and during her high speed movement, she will sprout a red wing and be able to fly over the surface of [[water]].
* Her Normal Attack [[AoE]] is increased during her "Masque of the Red Death" state.
* She remains in "Masque of the Red Death" even if she is swapped off field and swapped back in so long as her Bond of Life is greater than 30% HP.
* During the "Masque of the Red Death" state, the base damage of Normal Attacks is calculated as:<math>(\text{ATK} \times \text{Talent Multiplier}) + (\text{ATK} \times \text{Masque of the Red Death Increase} \times \frac{\text{Bond of Life}}{\text{Max HP}} )</math>
