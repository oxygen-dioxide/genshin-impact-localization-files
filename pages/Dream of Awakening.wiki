==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|One day, you and Paimon notice that many people in Sumeru City are talking about dreams...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Pedrush, optional)
:{{A|Vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 01.ogg}} '''Pedrush''' (I hope a lot of people will come to participate today.)

;(Approach Pedrush)
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 02.ogg}} '''Pedrush:''' Hello, Traveler. Have you ever heard of "A Moment of Dreams"?
:{{DIcon}} "A Moment of Dreams"?
:{{DIcon}} What's that?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that sounds like some kind of sweet drink!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 03.ogg}} '''Pedrush:''' Haha, I'm afraid not. It's the name of an event we started to hold regularly.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 04.ogg}} '''Pedrush:''' Dreams have become quite the hot topic in Sumeru, and many people are excited to share the dreams they've seen at night.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 05.ogg}} '''Pedrush:''' The same goes for me! The last time I dreamed was when I was but a little child, so I can't help but feel excited and nostalgic about dreaming again.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh right, everyone's able to dream again now!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 06.ogg}} '''Pedrush:''' Yes! We organized an event to give everyone with new dreams a platform to freely share their experiences.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 07.ogg}} '''Pedrush:''' And thus our event, "A Moment of Dreams," was born.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So it's kinda like a fireside chat...
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 08.ogg}} '''Pedrush:''' You could say that. We hear all sorts of wild and fabulous stories every day. Really, why not have a listen for yourselves?
:{{DIcon}} I can understand your curiosity...
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, but to us, dreaming is as normal as breathing.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, but if there are free drinks and snacks involved, then Paimon might consider it!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 09.ogg}} '''Pedrush:''' Oh really? So you mean... you've already seen many dreams?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mm-hmm, but no need to get so excited, it's really nothing special.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 10.ogg}} '''Pedrush:''' No no no, we need experienced participants like you to share your experiences with dreaming.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 11.ogg}} '''Pedrush:''' Please allow me to address you two as "dream experts"!
:{{DIcon}} ...Sounds kinda weird.
:{{DIcon}} There are some things that "expert" just doesn't seem to go with...
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, "expert." Hehe, Paimon kinda likes it!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 12.ogg}} '''Pedrush:''' Now you seem interested, hehe. Please, follow me to the meeting place. It won't take much of your time.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 13.ogg}} '''Pedrush:''' Rest assured, you'll find all the drinks and snacks you'd like there.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, how accommodating!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 09a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 09b.ogg}}--> '''Paimon:''' Sign us up! Ah, but wait... Paimon's getting ahead of herself again. We should see what the Traveler thinks first.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh? Why aren't you saying anything?
:{{DIcon}} You're the boss...
:{{DIcon}} I don't think I really have a choice.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe! Alright, hurry up and take us to be dream experts!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 14.ogg}} '''Pedrush:''' Haha, very good. Follow me, then.

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you know what's the most important part of being an "expert"?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 15.ogg}} '''Pedrush:''' Ahem... Well, I suppose it must be accumulating knowledge and sharing your experiences?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nope, it's all about the title. From now on, Paimon will be known as "Paimon, the Dream Expert"!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 1 pedrush 16.ogg}} '''Pedrush:''' O&mdash;Okay...

;(Approach the gathered people)
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 pedrush 01.ogg}} '''Pedrush:''' Sorry to interrupt, everyone. We finally have some REAL dream experts joining us!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 pedrush 02a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 pedrush 02b.ogg}}--> '''Pedrush:''' Esteemed experts, this way, please. Ahem, now, if anyone has any questions, please feel free to ask them.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 01.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' They must be dream experts from another land... Great!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nasser 01.ogg}} '''Nasser:''' Oh, I have a question! Me first! Me first!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 pedrush 03.ogg}} '''Pedrush:''' No rush. Everyone, please line up and ask in an orderly fashion!
:{{Black Screen|After some initial commotion, everyone finally forms a queue.}}
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, Paimon didn't expect them to be so enthusiastic...
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ata 01.ogg}} '''Ata:''' My question is simple. My everyday life is very difficult, so I would like to become a Slime in my dreams. How can I do that?
:{{DIcon}} Oh, that's a tough one...
:{{DIcon}} Honestly, I don't have any good tips.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon knows! Paimon's had this kind of dream before, so she knows a thing or two.
:;(Paimon gains the title "Expert")
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The first time, Paimon became an Anemo Slime. Paimon was shot by an adventurer's arrow and flew in the sky all night long.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The second time, Paimon became a Dendro Slime. A group of kids thought Paimon was a Radish and pulled out all the grass on her head. It was super painful!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The third time, Paimon became a Cryo Slime. In the end, Paimon was captured by a chef and turned into a smoothie.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And the fourth time, Paimon became a powerful Geo Slime and went to take revenge on the Forest Boar that used to bully Paimon.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But then the boar showed up with all its relatives, and Paimon lost again.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ata 02.ogg}} '''Ata:''' Wait, why did all of your dreams end so tragically?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Because Slimes are monsters, even though they look cute, they usually cause trouble and end up getting killed by adventurers.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Things don't tend to end well for monsters. Believe Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} (I want to interrupt, but...)
:{{DIcon}} (At least she's grasped the standard tropes of adventurer stories.)
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ata 03.ogg}} '''Ata:''' I suppose you're right... They are monsters, after all.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ata 04.ogg}} '''Ata:''' I just want to experience a different life, but it seems that becoming a monster would be even worse than my current life.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ata 05.ogg}} '''Ata:''' Hmm, maybe I'd be happier if I became just a regular Finch or fish...
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It looks like being an expert is way easier than Paimon imagined.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Next!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 02.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Oh, it's my turn. Esteemed expert, I want to know what posture I should sleep in so I can have the same dream as the one I had last night.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, well...
:;(Paimon's title becomes "Expert?")
:{{DIcon}} Yes, please enlighten us, esteemed expert.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! You're supposed to be helping!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, first, why don't you tell Paimon about the dream you want to have again?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 03.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Oh, it's quite ordinary. I sat and chatted with my wife on a sunny day, listening to the breeze blowing through the valley.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why don't you just find your wife and talk with her? There's no need to wait for a dream!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 04.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Well, uh... Unfortunately, she passed away.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh!? Uh, sorry! Paimon shouldn't have assumed anything.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 05.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' No, it's fine, I didn't make that clear. I just want a chance to see her again.
:{{DIcon}} Have you tried looking at her photos right before you fall asleep?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, it's not really about posture. What you think about right before falling asleep is probably way more important.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 06.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Oh, is that all I have to do?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Think about it, if you're the one thinking about her, and you're the one that'll be dreaming about her, then it'll be easier to connect your thoughts and dreams.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 07.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' You do have a point... I'll give it a try tonight! Thanks for your wise advice!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 kathya 01.ogg}} '''Kathya:''' Oh, my turn, my turn! Ahem, I want to know the name of the plant in my dream!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 debbi 01.ogg}} '''Debbi:''' I want to bring the souvenir box in my room into my dream!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paulin 01.ogg}} '''Pawlin:''' I dreamt of a raven flying over the wasteland last night. Does that have any kind of special meaning?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, no rush. One at a time!
:{{Black Screen|After a long time, the "experts" finally conclude their work.}}
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, their questions were way too difficult. We don't actually know anything more than they do. We're just more experienced dreamers, that's all.
:;(Paimon no longer has a title)
:{{DIcon}} They didn't really care about the answers.
:{{DIcon}} Vivid dreams are just really exciting to them.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You do have a point. It's more rewarding to explore and contemplate the meaning of a question than to focus on the answer itself.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right now, these people are like wanderers who've starved for three days and three nights and are desperate to replenish their energy. Any explanation they get now is like pure sustenance to them, no matter how good the explanation really is!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, and now that Paimon has said that, you know who comes to mind?
:{{DIcon}} Nahida.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 24.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Bingo! If she was here, she'd probably be making some similar analogy.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 25.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Unfortunately, she's super busy right now, and may not have time for gatherings like this.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 pedrush 04.ogg}} '''Pedrush:''' Dear experts, we have another guest who would like to consult you.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 26.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh? But you saw how we answered all the questions just now... We're not really all that knowledgeable.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 pedrush 05.ogg}} '''Pedrush:''' Ah, but this guest is rather... special.
:;(Nahida walks up)
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' My question is, why didn't you immediately tell me about such an interesting place?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 27.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, Nahida!? How did you get here!?
:;(Pedrush bows towards Nahida and walks off)
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Interesting events like "A Moment of Dreams" don't happen every day, after all. No matter how busy things are, I'd still set aside some time to check it out.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Anyway, I really didn't expect to meet you here.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 28.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, right! If there's anyone that understands dreams, it's you! You should be able to help us answer all these questions!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' You're not wrong. All right, they can ask me anything. The more interesting, the better.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 08.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' ...
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Huh? What's wrong? You were all so excited a minute ago... why the sudden hesitation?
:{{DIcon}} I think they need to build up some courage first.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Even so, it's not like I look super intimidating or anything, right?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' And in terms of reputation and renown, you've also done many great things in Sumeru, yet they didn't even flinch at you.
:{{DIcon}} Still, not quite the same as approaching an archon.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Alas, the interesting questions have all vanished in an instant. It appears I'm the one spoiling the fun here. I'll see myself out.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 29.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, that's not true, Nahida!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I don't want to get in the way of the original purpose of "A Moment of Dreams," which is to let people gather here and freely share their marvelous dreams.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Now the atmosphere here is like water poured into a container... The water is more secure and settled, but it has lost its free-flowing nature from the river.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I just wanted to be another drop in the water, not the cold and restrictive container.
:{{DIcon}} Is she doing what I think she is...?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 30.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She's sulking...
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 31.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, hey, it's all right, everyone. No need to be shy! The Dendro Archon is really nice, so please, just go ahead and ask! Otherwise, she'll leave.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ata 06.ogg}} '''Ata:''' A&mdash;Alright... I'll give it a try.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 32.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, it's the slime guy.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ata 07.ogg}} '''Ata:''' Hey, drop the nicknames, would ya? Besides... I don't want to become a Slime anymore. Maybe a Finch or fish is more suitable for me.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I see. So you want to become a small animal in your dreams, right? Why do you think that sounds good to you?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ata 08.ogg}} '''Ata:''' I guess I just want to experience something different. My everyday life is nothing but the same...
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ata 09.ogg}} '''Ata:''' The sky is right above me, and the ocean just over the horizon, yet I remain caged in a life of monotony.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' So you want to experience something new in your dreams... Sorry, I'm getting a little confused. Why don't you seek out some new experiences in real life?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ata 10.ogg}} '''Ata:''' Because if I don't work, I won't have any Mora. Sure, I don't want to be out hammering nails and cutting wood every day, but I have aging parents and young children to take care of.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ata 11.ogg}} '''Ata:''' By the time this all dawned on me, I realized that my life has already been filled to the brim by trifling matters, and I have no more freedom.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But if that's the case, then even if you became a flying bird or swimming fish, you will still be hammering nails and cutting wood in your dreams.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 15.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' The reason is you've already been caged. It doesn't matter what your physical body turns into, your mind will still be stuck in the same predicament.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ata 12.ogg}} '''Ata:''' Really? That sounds pretty terrible! Then what should I do?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 16.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I don't know everything that you're going through, but how about replacing your hammer?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ata 13.ogg}} '''Ata:''' Huh? Replacing my hammer?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 17.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' That's right. Having worked for such a long time, you of all people must know what makes a good hammer.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ata 14.ogg}} '''Ata:''' Well, of course. A good hammer needs to be heavy enough to drive the nail in with just a couple taps... and the handle has to have a good grip to it &mdash; not too smooth.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ata 15.ogg}} '''Ata:''' Come to think of it, I haven't replaced my current hammer in quite some time.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 18.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' You should replace it. Then decorate the handle with something you like... maybe some ornaments, fur, or a hard leather wrapping. Then, write the names of your children on it.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ata 16.ogg}} '''Ata:''' That makes sense... I think it'd give me a good boost of energy at work!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 19.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' A new sense of adventure often begins with the little things in life.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 20.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' You don't need to become a bird in the air or fish in the sea. You only need to do your best in life, and all those things you cherish will become your source of happiness.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ata 17.ogg}} '''Ata:''' Yes, yes... I get it now. This is a real eye-opener for me!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ata 18.ogg}} '''Ata:''' I'll go and pick out a new hammer right away... No, I should make one of my own. Thank you, great Dendro Archon!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 33.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's our Nahida! Only you would know how to get right to the heart of the problem.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 21.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Actually, I didn't really understand the problem.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 34.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 22.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I gave him that advice because I once saw a worker doing the same thing. Whenever he became tired, he would look at some names on the handle of his tool.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 23.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' After a moment, he'd start to smile. It really surprised me at the time... My guess is that the names on the handle were of important people to him.
:{{DIcon}} I think I understand.
:{{DIcon}} You were just drawing from a similar example.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 24.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Mm-hmm. After observation, I know this kind of behavior motivates people... but why is that?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 25.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Is it because of excitement, anticipation, or helplessness? I really don't know... And even if I could know what's going through his mind, it's still difficult to fully grasp his feelings.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 35.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon gets what you mean... Huh, Paimon had no idea it takes you so much effort to understand these kinds of things...
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 26.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hehe, that's why I was a bit nervous just now. But luckily, seeing his happy face in the end reassured me that I didn't say anything wrong.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 27.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Don't mind me, though. This is just my way of learning.
:{{DIcon}} I'm happy to help if you ever need it.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 36.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, don't forget about Paimon! Everyone knows that Paimon's also super skilled at reading people's feelings!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 28.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Thanks, you two. That makes me feel a lot better. Let's move on to the next question, shall we?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 09.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' I already asked the experts my question earlier, but I wanted to hear the Dendro Archon's response, too.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 10.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' What should I do if I want to see my deceased wife in my dreams every night?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 29.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hmm, longing for the deceased...
:{{DIcon}} (Is she remembering something about Greater Lord Rukkhadevata?)
:{{DIcon}} (No, she shouldn't be able to remember anymore.)
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 30.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Even if you keep reliving those beautiful memories, it'll only highlight the emptiness in your real life.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 31.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' If your wife were still alive, she certainly wouldn't want to see you like this, would she?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 11.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' No, I suppose not... But our time together in my dreams is not just reliving our past together.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 12.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' I don't know. Maybe it's because I miss her too much, but it's really as if she had come back to life in my dreams.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 13.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' She even remembers each and every dream. After I wake up and then continue dreaming again later, we can pick up our conversation right where we last left off.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 32.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' That's really amazing. Statistically speaking, continuous dreams are extremely rare.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 14.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' It's almost as if my wife has obtained a second life in my dreams. But the more vivid she appears, the emptier I feel and the more painful it is when I wake up. I don't know whether to call it a blessing or a curse...
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 33.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Maybe all of this is rooted in your deep longing for her.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 34.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Were there any unresolved matters or regrets between the two of you?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 15.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' I don't know... I suppose my biggest regret is that I couldn't spend the rest of my life with her.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 16.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' I really felt like I was ready to move on. I wouldn't be so hesitant now if it weren't for these hyper-realistic dreams I've been having.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 paimon 37.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh. You know, they say that whatever's on your mind is what goes into your dreams.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 35.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But dreams are, and will forever be, just dreams. We are people living in the real world.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 36.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' It's not good to be overly obsessed with dreams. All it'll do is fill up your mind and eat away at your thoughts.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 17.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Yes, I know... That's why I'm also a little disappointed in myself. I still need to take care of our child.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 18.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' And it's probably not good to let her see me in such a state...
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 ilman 19.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' *sigh* Anyway, thanks for your advice, great Dendro Archon.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 37.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Hmm, I'm a little worried about him. I hope he can find a way to cheer up soon.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 2 nahida 38.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I think I can handle things from here. You don't need to stay here if you find it boring. You're here to have a good time, after all.

;(Talk to Ilman)
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you feeling any better now?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 3 ilman 02.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Yes. I think the Dendro Archon made a really good point. I need to stop dwelling on my wife like this and move on with my life.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 3 ilman 03.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Now that I think about it, my wife and I always meet at a familiar place in my dreams.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 3 ilman 04.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' I know where that place exists in reality, but it's a bit far and dangerous. I don't dare to go there on my own.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 3 ilman 05.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' But, at the same time, I feel as if I should go and have a look anyway. Perhaps I'll be able to move on once I see that there's nothing there.
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like a good plan.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 3 ilman 06.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Otherwise, I'll keep on feeling like everything is covered in a haze... like I'm only half-awake.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 3 ilman 07.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Once I can stop dreaming about that place, I'll probably be able to get my life back together.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 3 ilman 08.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Actually, you two are adventurers, right? If it's okay with you, could you escort me to that place?
:{{DIcon}} Sure, let's go have a look.
:{{DIcon}} Let's go get a breath of fresh air.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, it might also be a good chance for us to unwind.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Even if you can't see your wife there, taking in some nice scenery will definitely help cheer you up.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 3 ilman 09.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Yeah, I hope so too.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, go ahead and get yourself ready then.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Speaking of longing for the deceased, I'd better tell Nahida about Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Nahida should at least know that she once existed in this world.)
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 3 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Ahem! Are you headed off to some interesting place without telling me again?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, wait, aren't you supposed to be answering questions?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 3 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I just finished. And I really got a lot out of it... so many interesting and novel thoughts.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 3 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Anyway, it looks like you're going somewhere. Why don't you take me with you?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 3 ilman 10.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Oh, there's no need to trouble you, great Dendro Archon. I imagine you must have many other important things to deal with.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 3 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' No need to stand on ceremony. Besides, I wouldn't have asked to come along if I didn't have a good reason.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 3 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I wanted to use this opportunity to discuss with you some things that are puzzling me right now.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 3 ilman 11.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Hmm, I didn't know the great Dendro Archon could become puzzled, too...
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 3 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I'm not all that different from you, you know. All right, let's go. We can talk on the way.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (I'd better go with her. The whole Greater Lord Rukkhadevata thing will take some explaining...)

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(On reaching the marked area, the group arrives just after sunset)
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, it's always nice to go for a leisurely stroll!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 01.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Do adventurers often go to places like this?
:{{DIcon}} Yes, of course.
:{{DIcon}} We usually journey through far more dangerous places than this.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 02.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Hmm, I guess so.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 01.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' So this is where you always meet your wife in your dreams?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 03.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Yes, for the most part. Our place is on the summit just up ahead.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 04.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' When I saw her in my dreams, we didn't do anything but talk about ordinary, mundane topics.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 05.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' I'd tell her about our daughter, [[Haydar]], and she always listened intently.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 06.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' She would also reminisce about the past with me, telling me interesting stories and cracking jokes.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 07.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' It feels like no matter how long we may chat, it's never enough.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sometimes, it's the little things in life that matter the most.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 02.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' This is the part I'm a little puzzled about...
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 03.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I am very familiar with dreams, and normally, they lack logic and continuity.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 04.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But you said she could remember what you had told her before, right?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 08.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' That's right. She always listened to me carefully in real life, and now, she's doing the same in my dreams.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 09.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' She always surprises me with some details from our lives in the real world. The fact that she can remember such things makes me feel like she's alive.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, that's pretty weird... Well, dreams are kinda weird to begin with.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' However, the problem is that his dreams have too much structure and continuity. Most dreams are far more fragile than you could imagine.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 06.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' For example, a loud noise outside your window in the real world could cause your dream self to get loaded into and fired out of a big cannon.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 07.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Another example... If you're thirsty in the real world, then you might find yourself trudging through a desert in your dream.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 08.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But the appearance of your wife seems unusually stable and unaffected by any outside interference. Statistically, this should be extremely rare.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 10.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' I don't understand it either, but I have no reason to suspect or reject these dreams. They're too beautiful.
:{{DIcon}} Indeed.
:{{DIcon}} I agree, it doesn't really feel like a cause for concern.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 09.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' But I still want to figure out the how and the why. These kinds of dreams are novel to me as well. That's why I want to have a look at the scene your dreams have been taking place at.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 10.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Let's go! Just think of it as a nice little hike to the top of the mountain.
----
;(Approach the summit)
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, he really wasn't kidding. This place definitely isn't safe.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 11.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' No matter. We'll just finish them quickly.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Are you going to fight too, Nahida?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 12.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Of course. This is all part of our little trip.

;(After defeating the enemies)
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The scenery here is amazing... It also seems like a great spot for eating snacks and taking a nap.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon wouldn't mind spending some time here every day, either. *sigh*
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 13.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I've yet to see anything strange about this place.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 14.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I do not plan to deny the power of longing. Such an intense but unquantifiable emotion could indeed have the power to organize dreams.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' His wife must be a really amazing person.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Wait, where'd he go?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 11.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Oh, so you were waiting for me here? Well, guess what, I've brought someone amazing with me today.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 12.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' When the Dendro Archon said she wanted to come with me, I could hardly believe it!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 13.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' I'll bring Haydar once I'm more familiar with the way here. She's been telling me that she really misses you.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Wh&mdash;What's wrong with him?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's nobody there.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 14.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Wait, Maynar. Don't go that way, it's dangerous.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 15.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Uh-oh, he's gonna fall. Catch him!
:{{Black Screen|You rush to stop Ilman, who is walking towards the edge of the cliff.}}
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew, luckily he didn't fall... But what was all that rambling about? He also looks like he's passed out...
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 16.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' He's in a dream now. What he said just now matches almost perfectly with the dreams he described to us earlier.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? So... he fell asleep, and started to have the same dream?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 17.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' I find it a little strange as well, but we mustn't awaken someone while they're sleepwalking. All we can do is sit here and wait.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 15.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Uh... Huh?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 16.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Maynar... Where's Maynar?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, good! You're finally awake.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 17.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' What happened...
:{{DIcon}} You were sleepwalking...
:{{DIcon}} And almost fell.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 18.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Huh? Sleepwalking?
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 19.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' Oh, right... It was all just a dream...
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 20.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' The moment I reached the summit, I saw my wife, Maynar, sitting there, and walked over to her.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 21.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' After I introduced her to you, she seemed a little flustered and started walking away. I told her to stop because of the cliff...
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 22.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' And then she seemed to suddenly disappear. A strong wind started to blow around me and the sky grew dark.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 23.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' When I realized something wasn't right, I woke up.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That sounds pretty wild... Maybe you were just too tired.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 24.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' I don't think so... I slept a lot yesterday, and I don't feel very sleepy now.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 18.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Maybe we've affected the way his subconscious constructs dreams by following him here.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 19.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Anyway, all that matters is that you woke up safe and sound.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 25.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' I think I know what happened now, I'm sorry... If it weren't for you, I would have fallen.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 20.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Let's head back now. Don't come back to this place again for the time being.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 ilman 26.ogg}} '''Ilman:''' ...O&mdash;Okay.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nahida, what's on your mind? Paimon's a little worried now.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 21.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' We still don't have enough evidence to work off of, so it's hard to draw any reliable conclusions yet... But I'm concerned that Ilman's case may not be unique to him...
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh right, come to think of it, there were lots of people from the event who had vivid memories of their dreams!
:{{DIcon}} Maybe this phenomenon is already spreading.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 22.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Right, and not only at "A Moment of Dreams." There may be people like this all across Sumeru.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 nahida 23.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' We need to understand what's happening and the rate of its development as soon as possible.
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then there's no time to lose. Let's head back!
:{{A|vo nhdlq001 4 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Stop standing there, Ilman! Let's go!

:{{A|vo nhdlq001 5 pedrush 03.ogg}} '''Pedrush:''' But could you at least tell me what happened? You all look so serious...

:{{A|vo nhdlq001 5 nahida 05.ogg}} '''Nahida:''' Please help us tell the others not to do anything reckless.
