|description  = This [[tengu]] annex dwelling that floats upon the sea like a lonesome boat once played host to the somewhat famous "[[Yougou Three]]," and this would later become the cage in which they, having despaired, spent the rest of their days.<ref group="Note">The English translation "and this would later become the cage in which they ([[Yougou Three]]), having despaired, spent the rest of their days." has somewhat deviated from the original Chinese {{zh|后来成了此人灰心之后虚度余生的樊笼，沉入了海下}}. The phrase {{zh|此人|lit=this person}} is an archaic expression which is almost always used as a singular. Therefore, a more plausible interpretation would be "Thereafter, [this boat] became the house of seclusion (lit. bird cage) in which this person ([[Reizenbou]]), having despaired, spent the rest of of her days in vain and [the boat] finally sunk into the sea."</ref>

{{Description|This was once the final abode of a [[Reizenbou|tengu warrior]] incarnate. Having since forsaken the world, it falls to you to solve the riddle they left behind and defeat the trespassing bandits.|Tutelage: A Thousand Scrolls}}
'''Empty Boat of a Thousand Gates''' is a [[One-Time Domain]] in [[Inazuma]]. It contains one level, '''Tutelage: A Thousand Scrolls'''.

Unlocking the domain requires first obtaining the [[Memento Lens]] and then using it to access [[Araumi]]'s underground labyrinth. Traveling through the underground passageways and completing several puzzles will eventually lead to unlocking the domain (see the [[Araumi]] page for more details).

==Steps==
#Open the door by finding three amulets
#*An Exquisite Chest can be found in a room within the puzzle area.
#Defeat two enemies at the end of the hallway:
#*{{Enemy|Kairagi: Dancing Thunder}}
#*{{Enemy|Kairagi: Fiery Might}} &mdash; this enemy appears when the Dancing Thunder Kairagi reaches half health.
#*A Precious Chest appears after the enemies are defeated.
