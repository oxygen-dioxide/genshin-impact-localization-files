==Archive Entry==
[[Durin|He]] had a very, very long dream...

He dreamed that he and everyone else had gone on a long, long journey,<br />
Into [[Mondstadt|a land]] where green grass grew, and where soulful songs were sung.<br />
He dreamed that he sang along with the gentle people of this land,<br />
And danced in the skies with [[Dvalin|a dragon]] as beauteous as a jewel.

When he opened his eyes, he was in the sky above [[Dragonspine|a mountain]] swept by roaring snowstorms.<br />
The green, tranquil land had already been painted crimson by fire and blood,<br />
And the song of that [[Venti|sky-blue bard]]'s lyre was almost drowned in the howling tumult.<br />
And that bejeweled, lovely dragon, like a tender lover,<br />
Had now pierced his neck through with its sharp fangs.

"Farewell, [[Rhinedottir|Mother]]! My journey is ended."<br />
"I shall sleep beneath this white, shining silver... and perhaps this, too, is good."<br />
"Farewell, O lovely bard! And farewell, O lovely dragon!"<br />
"Would that we had met in a different time and place,"<br />
"To meet, to sing and dance together!"<br />
So he thought most sincerely as he lay dying.

"Now then, this great blessing that pulses through my veins,"<br />
"And lovely sight of the dark universe that gave me birth..."<br />
"They are now yours to inherit."
