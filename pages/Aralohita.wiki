'''Aralohita''' is a historical figure of the [[Aranara]], who accompanied [[Pir Kavikavus]] when he was alive.<ref name = "Vana">{{Ref/Quest|Until Vana is Healed}}</ref>

After Pir Kavikavus went missing and presumably dead after a mysterious accident, Aralohita saved some of his research and locked it behind riddles and puzzles, which the Aranara had been fond of. Aralohita's own fate is unknown, but [[Ararycan]] was able to locate their last known location and unearth Pir Kavikavus's research papers.<ref name = "Vana"/>

It is speculated that Aralohita was one of the factors that helped Pir Kavikavus achieve many achievements at a very young age.
