|info          = Mika derives the ability to spur his teammates on from the recited prayers of the knightly order, regenerating [[HP]] for all nearby party members. This healing is based on Mika's Max HP and will grant them the Eagleplume state. When the Normal Attacks of active characters affected by Eagleplume hit an opponent, Mika will help them regenerate HP based on his Max HP. Characters affected by this state can only regenerate HP in this way once per short interval of time.
