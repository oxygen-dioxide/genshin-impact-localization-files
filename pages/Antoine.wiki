:'''Antoine:''' Humans should break free of the shackles of the earth and soar into the skies! Don't you think so too?
:{{DIcon}} Err, you are...
::'''Antoine:''' Antoine Roger's the name, and clockwork engineering's the game. My specialty? The eternal dream of humanity: flight!
::'''Antoine:''' Now, you might be curious, and rightly so, as to how this might be different from [[Edwin Eastinghouse]]'s research. In which case, let me explain!
::'''Antoine:''' I generate propulsion using energy converted from the annihilation reaction between [[Arkhe|pneuma and ousia]], which powers my aircraft's movement!
::'''Antoine:''' What do you think? If you'd like to give it a try, hop aboard the Antoine Roger Aircraft and activate it using an annihilation reaction!
::'''Antoine:''' It will move along the designated path &mdash; accident-free travel guaranteed!
::{{DIcon}} Is it really safe?
:::'''Antoine:''' ...
:::'''Antoine:''' Absolutely, positively &mdash; according to my calculations and simulation experiments, that is!
::{{DIcon}} Is this work for the [[Fontaine Research Institute]]?
:::'''Antoine:''' Ah, what are you talking about? The Institute has been rendered a ruin. Its capacity for research has been lost! All that remains is the official agency.
:::'''Antoine:''' But what cannot be denied is that many independent engineers &mdash; of whom I am one &mdash; still use kinetic cores designed by [[Alain Guillotin|Guillotin]], the Institute's founder.
:::'''Antoine:''' The aircraft is merely one step in the realization of my goals.
:::'''Antoine:''' My final objective is the creation of sufficiently powerful and affordable kinetic cores.
:::'''Antoine:''' I wish to attain greatness like that of Guillotin and build something that can change Fontaine.
:::'''Antoine:''' Imagine a nation as I envision it, dear friend. Humans freed from gravity, free to fly through the skies.
:::'''Antoine:''' Clockwork meka shall perform all the labor we need on the ground.
:::'''Antoine:''' While we, having primacy over all other beings, shall be freed from such. We shall be free to think, to produce art, to develop culture!
:::'''Antoine:''' Is this not lovely?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Antoine:''' You have a wonderful day!
