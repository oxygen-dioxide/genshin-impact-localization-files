{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Timaeus and Sucrose)
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 01.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' So, Sucrose, the package you mentioned that you received before... It's not dangerous, is it?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 02.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' You need to be careful when you're opening packages. I once had a friend mail me some research materials, and all the bouncing around in transit caused a reaction...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 03.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Once I opened it, it let out a stench that could wake the dead.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 04.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' If your package contains anything like that, then maybe you should check with Albedo first and see what he thinks.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' No, this package didn't contain any hazardous materials...
;(If the player has not yet met Sucrose)
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, Timaeus! What are you chatting about?
::'''Paimon:''' And... who might this be?
::'''Timaeus:''' Oh, hello you two. This is Sucrose.
::'''Sucrose:''' Hi, I'm Sucrose, Albedo's assistant. If you have any alchemy-related queries, you could always ask me. I'd... do my best to help...
::{{DIcon}} You don't have to be so nervous!
::'''Sucrose:''' Huh? Do I look nervous?
::'''Surcose:''' M&mdash;My apologies, I don't get out too often. I'm usually in the laboratory, where there aren't many others to talk to.
::'''Paimon:''' That's okay, you don't have to force yourself! Paimon's sure that once we get to know each other better, we'll become really good friends!
::'''Sucrose:''' {{Traveler}}... Hey, aren't you the legendary Traveler? The one who repelled Stormterror?
::{{DIcon}} "Legendary" is a bit much.
::{{DIcon}} I don't even charge for autographs.
::'''Surcrose:''' Ah! Thank you!
::'''Sucrose:''' I've heard so many stories about you! Always wanted an opportunity to research you up close!
::'''Paimon:''' Uhh, what do you mean "research"...?
::'''Sucrose:''' Ah! Sorry, don't mind me. What am I saying...
::'''Paimon:''' Well, never mind. So, what were you two talking about just now?
::'''Timaeus:''' Sucrose received a strange package recently...
;(If the player has met Sucrose)
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Timaeus, Sucrose! What are you two chatting about?
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 05.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Oh, hey you two! We're just talking about a strange package that Sucrose received recently.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A strange package?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Yes. I believe it's from a Sumeru scholar who came here to study in Mondstadt. It's most likely a thank-you gift for collaborating on some research together.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, a package from an Akademiya scholar? Then there could be anything inside.
:{{DIcon}} Well, it is a thank-you gift.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' There wasn't anything dangerous inside, just a bunch of strange cards.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 04.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I think I've seen Timaeus with some similar-looking cards before, so I came to ask him about what they might be.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 06.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' You've seen me with some cards? Ah, maybe those were the testing cards used for distinguishing reagents?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 05.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' No, they didn't look like test cards. Here, have a look...
::[[File:Sucrose Character Card.png|120x120px]]
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 07.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Oh, you meant these... Huh, Sucrose, have you really never seen these before?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 06.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' No, never. Recently, I've been spending all my time up in the mountains working on cultivating Pentatanic Sweet Flowers. Why, is this an area of research that has started trending in the alchemical community during my absence?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 08.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Haha, you could definitely say that it's trending, but not as an area of research... It's a card game that's been getting really popular these days.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 09.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' It's called "[[Genius Invokation TCG]]"!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Genius Invokation TCG!
:{{DIcon}} So this is the game we've been hearing about.
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 05a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, we've been hearing about this game all over the place, but this is the first time we've ever actually seen any of the cards.
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 05a 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We didn't know it had made it all the way to Mondstadt. Must be pretty popular, huh?
:{{DIcon}} Genius what now?
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 05b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Genius Invokation TCG! Haven't you heard of it before?
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 05b 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Apparently it's a game that was invented by a scholar in the [[Akademiya]]. People from all over are playing it now!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 10.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' That's right. The game's been catching on lately. The [[Yae Publishing House]] in Inazuma has even published a series of light novels based on the game. The story is really good!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 11.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' It starts with a young guy in Sumeru who finds an ancient "Casket of Tomes" in the attic. He opens it, and discovers that the soul of an ancient TCG player called the Crocodile King has been captured inside.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 12.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' It turns out that the Crocodile King was [[King Deshret]]'s viceroy, who battled an opponent named the Ibis King. During the match, the Crocodile King fell prey to his opponent's scheme and was sealed away in the Casket of Tomes.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 13.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' After being unexpectedly released by the kid, the Crocodile King possesses him and helps him to gradually climb the ranks and become a legendary TCG player.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 07.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Uh, Timaeus?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 14.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Huh? What's wrong, Sucrose? Uh, if you're interested in how the story plays out, I can lend you the novels.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 08.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' No, I was just thinking about that time you requested an extension on your progress report deadline, citing "personal reasons" for the delay...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 15.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Ahem, well... I did go through a phase recently where I wasn't putting enough focus on my work, but it's under control now. I've committed to not even touch Genius Invokation TCG until I've made enough progress in my research.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 09.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Aw, well that's unfortunate.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? Why's that?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 10.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Well, since it's a gift from a researcher I've collaborated with, I thought that I should at least try to learn the rules. That way, I could say that I at least tried to appreciate his gift.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, right... And since it's a game from Sumeru, who knows, playing it might even make you smarter!
:{{DIcon}} If you want to play, then just say it.
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 08a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, fine! Paimon's curious and would like to give it a try! ...Please?
:{{DIcon}} Then you desperately need to play this game.
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 08b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, just wait until Paimon plays it enough to become smarter than you. Then you'll be sorry!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Although it seems like we can't learn how to play it anytime soon 'cause Timaeus has given up for a while.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 16.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Haha, well research is my priority, you know.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 17.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' But if you'd like to learn the rules of Genius Invokation TCG, then I'd actually suggest you go to [[The Cat's Tail]].
:{{DIcon}} The Cat's Tail...
:{{DIcon}} That's [[Margaret]]'s place...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 18.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Yep, that's the place. It's where everyone in the community goes to play when they have time. They gather there, trade cards... and they're very welcoming to new players.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 timaeus 19.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Trying to learn the rules can be intimidating at first, but it's a lot of fun once you get the hang of it.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 11.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Understood. {{Traveler}}, Paimon, let's go to The Cat's Tail and try asking around.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 sucrose 12.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' To be honest, hearing Timaeus talking about the game has also piqued my curiosity.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, what are we waiting for? Let's get going!
----
{{Quest Description|update|So the cards Sucrose received are Genius Invokation TCG cards. Why not try the Genius Invokation TCG and become a player yourself?}}
;(Enter The Cat's Tail)
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 2 margaret 01.ogg}} '''Margaret:''' Welcome to The Cat's Tail. Ah, it's {{Traveler}} and Paimon, what a nice surprise!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 2 margaret 02.ogg}} '''Margaret:''' Oh, and Sucrose the alchemist. It's been a while, hasn't it?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 2 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Heh...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 2 margaret 03.ogg}} '''Margaret:''' I'm afraid I've already told you before: Fur from The Cat's Tail staff is not for sale, no matter how much Mora you offer.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 2 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Ah, don't worry, Margaret, we're not here for that research project I told you about last time.
:{{DIcon}} Uh... What research project?
:{{DIcon}} Fur? From The Cat's Tail staff?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, Sucrose... what kind of experiment were you trying to do at The Cat's Tail?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 2 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Oh, I just wanted to test out some hypotheses, and I needed some materials... But, uh, we can talk about that later.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 2 sucrose 04.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Actually, Margaret, we're here to learn more about Genius Invokation TCG.
:{{Black Screen|Sucrose explains everything to Margaret...}}
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 2 margaret 04.ogg}} '''Margaret:''' Ah, Genius Invokation TCG... We were just talking about that game.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 2 margaret 05.ogg}} '''Margaret:''' You see, more and more people have been gathering at The Cat's Tail to play, so I thought: Why not have a dedicated staff to serve the new customers?
;(If ''[[Margaret's Longing]]'' has been completed)
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 3 margaret 01.ogg}} '''Margaret:''' Speaking of which, I believe you've already met...
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm? Met who?
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 3 margaret 02.ogg}} '''Margaret:''' You know, [[Prince]]. This is The Cat's Tail, after all, so I thought having a cat take care of our new customers would be quite a nice touch.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 littleprince 01.ogg}} '''Prince:''' Meow.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 01.ogg}} '''[[Shuyun]]:''' Ah, allow me to interpret. Ahem, Prince says that the word "customer" is much too loose of a term, and we should instead refer to anyone who loves dueling with cards as "TCG players."
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 margaret 01.ogg}} '''Margaret:''' Hmm... my mistake. So it seems I haven't introduced you yet... This is Prince and Shuyun. They will be in charge of taking care of our "TCG players."
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 02.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Ah, I'm afraid I must correct you there, Ma'am. Only Prince, the strongest and most formidable TCG player of all, is capable of providing valuable guidance to our new players.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 03.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' The average player is incapable of grasping the subtlety and sheer genius behind Prince's every play, and he has no choice but to rely on me to communicate with everyone. I am merely Prince's lowly assistant, that's all.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, another guy who can understand animals!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 04.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' How can you use such a crude word as "animal" to describe the one and only Prince? He is special and the only one of his kind... Such a remark is an insult to Prince!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 littleprince 02.ogg}} '''Prince:''' Meow...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 05.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Oh? What's that? "Shuyun, in the eyes of the common folk, I look no different than any other ordinary cat. It's a natural mistake to make, and you shouldn't overreact." Ah, understood... I do apologize.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Hmm, it seems he really is capable of communicating with the cat. Could this be the result of some modification to the language center of his brain?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seriously, how can he get all of that from a simple meow?
:{{DIcon}} Amazing...
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 06a 1.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Yes, it was the sacred duels of Genius Invokation TCG that formed and cemented our bonds of mutual understanding. It's my firm belief that by simply playing the game, players can develop a deeper level of understanding between one another.
:{{DIcon}} That's pretty weird...
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 06b 1.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' It was the duels of Genius Invokation TCG that allowed our hearts to bond. It's understandable that ordinary people such as yourselves are unable to comprehend such a thing.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' So playing Genius Invokation TCG fosters some sort of a telepathic link between players?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... Somehow, Paimon doubts that.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 margaret 02.ogg}} '''Margaret:''' Uh-huh... Anyway, if you'd like to know anything about Genius Invokation TCG, then please ask Shuyun... Uh, who will ask Prince.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 margaret 03.ogg}} '''Margaret:''' Though I'd love to explain more myself, it's time for my daily walk. I'll let Prince play a game with you and walk you through all the rules.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 07.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Meow... "Just as a seasoned warrior can foresee the path of his opponent's sword, so too can I, as a TCG master, predict my opponent's every play. It would be improper to pit a newcomer to the art of the card against one such as myself, and I must therefore politely decline."
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 08.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Ahem, that's what Prince said.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, PRINCE doesn't wanna play with us, huh? Fine, then Prince doesn't have to. We'll play you instead!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 09.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' I'm sorry, but from the day I met the mighty cardmaster Prince, I swore an oath that my hands would live solely to hold the cards, and not to play them. I will never play another match of my own again.
:{{DIcon}} Right, Prince's paws probably can't hold the cards...
:{{DIcon}} What a backstory...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 margaret 04.ogg}} '''Margaret:''' If Prince is unwilling to play, then I guess we should look for an alternative. How about this... [[Diona]]!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Yeah, blah blah blah, what is it? I'm pretty busy over here, you know!
:{{Introductory Note|Diona}}
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 diona 02.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Hmph, why is it that every player that sets foot in here to play Genius Invokation TCG has to have a drink... Ugh! Don't they have any clue that the key to playing a game is the ability to think straight?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 diona 03.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Seriously, games and drinks don't mix. Don't they get that? Ugh!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 margaret 05.ogg}} '''Margaret:''' What can I say... As the tavern owner, I can't help but feel happy to hear this.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 margaret 06.ogg}} '''Margaret:''' Anyway, I see you've been working hard so I thought you could use a break... So why not come over here and teach these customers the rules of Genius Invokation?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 diona 04.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Ha, hahah! Yeah! What kind of break is that? I'd rather not, hmph!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 diona 05.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Oh... why are we letting all these loafers come in here to play Genius Invokation TCG anyway? All it does is encourage more people to come to the bar for a drink...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 diona 06.ogg}} '''Diona:''' *sigh* Ya know, if drinks sales keep going up like this, pretty soon, Mondstadt's alcohol industry is gonna reach new heights...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 diona 07.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Grr, looks like my first step in destroying Mondstadt's alcohol industry should be stamping out the spread of Genius Invokation TCG!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 10.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Meow... "My dear, you are quite mistaken. You said it yourself &mdash; a clear mind is necessary to win. Soon, their thirst for victory will overcome their thirst for alcohol..."
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 11.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Prince speaks the truth, Diona. Not only is the spread of Genius Invokation TCG no obstacle to your goal of destroying Mondstadt's alcohol industry, it could even support you in this endeavor!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 diona 08.ogg}} '''Diona:''' C&mdash;Could it really?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 margaret 07.ogg}} '''Margaret:''' Sure, why not. Alrighty then, our two customers are waiting to learn... Shuyun, let's put you on drink-mixing duty for now.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 12.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Meow... "But Shuyun is destined for a far greater purpose..."
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 margaret 08.ogg}} '''Margaret:''' Shuyun. Drink-mixing. Now.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 suyun 13.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' O&mdash;Okay...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 4 diona 09.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Ooo... alright! We'll need some space to learn, heheh. Let's go to that empty table over there.

;(Talk to Prince or Shuyun again)
:{{A|vo dialog tips tcg001 suyun 01.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Meow... "Diona's waiting for you. Go talk to her and she'll teach you the rules of the game."
:{{A|vo dialog tips tcg001 suyun 02.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' That's what Prince said. *sigh* And I need to go start mixing drinks. It's a pity that I can't look on while you learn...

;(Talk to [[Gary]])
:'''Gary:''' I will surely defeat all my opponents just like how I chase down prey, and I'll become the best Genius Invokation TCG player in no time.
:'''Gary:''' ...Hmm? You're interested in the game too? But you're not a player yet, are you?
:'''Gary:''' Hehehe... When you become a true TCG player, you might even get the chance to duel me...

;(Talk to [[Belén]])
:'''Belén:''' Hey there, up for a game of cards? Hold on... I don't think you're a player yet.
:'''Belén:''' Come find me once you've become an official player. Perhaps there'll be something I can learn from your mistakes...

;(Talk to [[Makri]])
:'''Makri:''' A new player, huh... You can ask Shuyun about the rules of the game, but if there's other things you wish to know...
:'''Makri:''' You're always welcome to ask.

;(Talk to [[Nanaya Yuumi]])
:'''Nanaya Yuumi:''' The illustrations on some cards are really pretty, don't you think? I'm trying to collect them all.
:'''Nanaya Yuumi:''' Beauty is also one form of victory!

;(Talk to [[Atra]])
:'''Atra:''' Do you want to be a TCG player, too? If you do, you should have this in mind:
:'''Atra:''' It will be I who will become the king of Genius Invokation TCG!

;(Talk to Diona)
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 11 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Hehe, okay! Let's go through the rules. First things first, you'll be needing your deck, so place that on the table...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 11 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' A... deck?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 11 diona 02.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Uh, yes? You should have built a deck. You know, a set of cards that meets the bare minimum requirement to play the game...?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 11 diona 03.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Huh-huh... what's with the blank stares? ...C'mon, don't tell me you came to learn Genius Invokation TCG without bringing any cards?
:{{DIcon}} Actually, we do have some cards...
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 11 sucrose 02a 1.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' That's right, we have some cards that I received from a friend.
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 11 diona 04a 1.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Uhh... you're gonna need a few more cards than that.
:{{DIcon}} Don't you have a practice deck we could try?
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 11 paimon 01b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, we need a practice deck! Can't you just let us use one?
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 11 diona 04b 1.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Tch, there's no such thing!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 11 diona 05.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Okay, lemme think... To learn the game, you'll need at least two Character Cards to switch between...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 11 diona 06.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Oh, oh! That reminds me, a few days ago when I was closing up for the night, I noticed a customer had left a couple of Character Cards on the bar counter. Haha! Maybe you could use those for now.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 11 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Are you sure that's okay...?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 11 diona 07.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Eh, it's already been a few days and he still hasn't come back to claim them. Who knows, maybe he left them here on purpose...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 11 diona 08.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Oh. Okay, yeah. Got them here with me, you know, just in case the customer came looking for them. Yeah, yeah, not because I like to play the game or anything. Please...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, so now we have two Character Cards. That's everything we need, right?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 11 diona 09.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Yup. So, are you ready to start?
:{{DIcon|TCG}} I'm ready!
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 11 diona 10a 1.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Alright, then let's begin!
:{{DIcon}} Not just yet, I need a moment...
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 11 diona 10b 1.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Okay, I guess I'll get things set up on the table first. Once you're ready, we can get started.

;(Talk to Sucrose before completing the tutorial, optional)

===Genius Invokation TCG Basics (I): Character Cards and Attack Types===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Haha! Welcome &mdash; welcome to the world of Genius Invokation TCG!
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 02.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Simply put, this is a game where you control {{Color|bp|Character Cards}} to duke it out with your opponent! Pew pew pew!
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 03.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Once you've {{Color|bp|defeated all of your opponent's Character Cards}}, victory shall be yours!
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 04.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Now then, you're gonna need a character on the field to {{Color|bp|start}} with.
::Select Diluc as your first active character
::Confirm your selection
:{{Black Screen|You attack first &mdash; Round 1}}
;(Roll Phase)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 05.ogg}} '''Diona:''' First, we {{Color|bp|roll 8 Elemental Dice}} at the start of every Round.
:;(The player rolls two Omni Dice, four Pyro Dice, one Hydro Die, and one Electro Die)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 06.ogg}} '''Diona:''' These dice correspond to elemental energy! We'll be spending these dice to perform actions!
::Confirm your roll results
:;(Diona's Blazing Axe Mitachurl's Flowfire Edge activates)

;(Action Phase)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 07.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Once the Roll Phase is over, you will enter the {{Color|bp|Action Phase}}, where the real game starts!
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 08.ogg}} '''Diona:''' During the Action Phase, you can spend Elemental Dice to perform various actions.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 09.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Of course, the most common action is to {{Color|bp|use Character Skills}}!
::Select Diluc's {{Color|bp|Elemental Skill}}
::Diluc's Elemental Skill will cost {{Color|bp|3 Pyro Dice}}. After selecting the Skill, you will select the Elemental Dice that must be spent by default.
::Searing Onslaught can deal {{Color|bp|3 Pyro DMG}}.
::Use Searing Onslaught against the opponent's active character
:;(Diluc uses Searing Onslaught on Diona's Hilichurl Fighter)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 10.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Heh, not bad. You just made your first attack.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 11.ogg}} '''Diona:''' During the Action Phase, both sides will {{Color|bp|take turns making their moves}}.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 12.ogg}} '''Diona:''' After you use a Skill to attack your opponent, it's their turn to attack.
:;(Diona opponent's Hilichurl Fighter uses Jump and Hit on Diluc)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 13.ogg}} '''Diona:''' And as you can see, once the enemy finishes their move, it's our turn again.
::Attack using your Elemental Skill again
::We have 2 {{Color|bp|Omni Dice}} amongst our rolls.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 14.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Now, these are Omni Element Dice. They can be spent {{Color|bp|on any move, regardless of the elemental type}}!
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 15.ogg}} '''Diona:''' So we're gonna use them to pay for the Pyro Dice needed for this Skill. Go on, give it a try.
::You can also click the Skill button again to use the Skill
:;(Diluc uses Searing Onslaught on the Hilichurl Fighter and defeats it)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 16.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Haha, that was pretty good. That's one opponent down for the count! Kabam{{sic|！<!--This is a full-width exclamation mark.-->}}
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 17.ogg}} '''Diona:''' But the game has only just begun, remember? You have to {{Color|bp|defeat all opponents}} to win.
:;(Diona's Blazing Axe Mitachurl uses Du Plama on Diluc)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 18.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Hmm, as much as we'd like to attack again, seems like we've run out of usable dice...
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 19.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Hmph. In that case, let's {{Color|bp|end this round}}!
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 20.ogg}} '''Diona:''' After you {{Color|bp|End Round}}, you won't be able to do anything else this Round.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 21.ogg}} '''Diona:''' And once everyone chooses End Round... We can {{Color|bp|move on to the next Round}}.
::End Round
::Confirm the end of your actions
:;(Diona declares the end of her Round)
:{{Black Screen|You attack first &mdash; Round 2}}
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 22.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Alright! Here we are, {{Color|bp|a fresh new Round}}, woohoo!
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 23.ogg}} '''Diona:''' And a fresh new Round means time to {{Color|bp|roll the dice again}}! That's how we're gonna get the elemental energy we need, after all.

;(Roll Phase)
:;(The player rolls one Pyro Die, three Geo Dice, two Electro Dice, one Hydro Die, and one Dendro Die)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 24.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Ew, that's some terrible luck. There's no way we'll be able to use Diluc's skill now...
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 25.ogg}} '''Diona:''' But don't worry! Situations like these are why we have the option to {{Color|bp|Reroll}}! Haha!
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 26.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Once per Round, you can {{Color|bp|select all the dice that you don't like and Reroll them}}.
::Select all the non-Pyro Dice
::After selecting the dice you want to reroll, click the button to reroll them
:;(The player now has two Omni Dice, three Pyro Dice, and three Hydro Dice)

;(Action Phase)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 27.ogg}} '''Diona:''' When the Action Phase begins, {{Color|bp|the player who first chose End Round in the previous round}} takes their turn first.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 28.ogg}} '''Diona:''' This means that since you finished first the last Round, you will be the first to start this Round.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 29.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Alrighty then. Let's learn a little bit about {{Color|bp|Energy and Elemental Bursts}}!
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 30.ogg}} '''Diona:''' {{Color|bp|Each time you use a Skill}}, your Character will gain 1 {{Color|bp|Energy}}.
::Last Round, we used 2 Skills, which means that we have obtained 2 Energy.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 31.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Once Diluc's Energy is full, he can use a powerful Elemental Burst. But we're still one short...
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 32.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Never mind, let's start with a Normal Attack instead.
::Use a Normal Attack
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 33.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Diluc's Normal Attack only needs 1 Pyro Die and 2 other dice of any type.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 34.ogg}} '''Diona:''' In any case, your Normal Attack needs fewer Pyro Dice than your Elemental Skill.
::You can also click the Skill button again to use the Skill
:;(Diluc uses Tempered Sword on Diona's Blazing Axe Mitachurl)
::Just like Elemental Skills, Normal Attacks grant 1 Energy after using them.
:;(Diona's Blazing Axe Mitachurl uses Upa on Diluc)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 35.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Hehe, now we have 3 Energy &mdash; plus, we have enough Pyro Elemental Dice left over.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 36.ogg}} '''Diona:''' It's time to use your powerful {{Color|bp|Elemental Burst}}!
::Use Diluc's Elemental Burst
::The Elemental Burst, Dawn, can deal a whopping 8 DMG. Use it to finish off your final opponent and claim victory!
::Use your Elemental Burst to wipe out your opponent!
:;(Diluc uses Dawn on the Blazing Axe Mitachurl and defeats it)

===Genius Invokation TCG Basics (II): Switching Characters and Elemental Reactions===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{Black Screen|You attack first &mdash; Round 1}}
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 37.ogg}} '''Diona:''' In an actual game of Genius Invokation TCG, you need to use {{Color|bp|multiple Character Cards}} to form a party.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 38.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Next up, it's time for your second Character Card, Kaeya, to take the stage!

;(Roll Phase)
:;(The player rolls one Cryo Die, one Pyro Die, two Electro Dice, two Geo Dice, and two Dendro Dice)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 39.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Huh... It seems like any move by Kaeya is gonna cost quite a lot of Cryo Dice...
::Select all non-Cryo and non-Pyro Dice
::Reroll selected dice
:;(The player now has one Omni Die, three Cryo Dice, two Pyro Dice, and two Hydro Dice)
:;(Diona's Blazing Axe Mitachurl's Flowfire Edge activates)

;(Action Phase)
::Select Kaeya's Elemental Skill, Frostgnaw
::Kaeya's Elemental Skill can deal {{Color|bp|Cryo DMG}}.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 40.ogg}} '''Diona:''' When you deal {{Color|bp|Cryo DMG}}, you will cause your target to be affected by Cryo.
::Now then, use Frostgnaw to apply Cryo to your opponent!
:;(Kaeya uses Frostgnaw on Diona's Blazing Axe Mitachurl)
:;(Diona's Blazing Axe Mitachurl uses Upa on Kaeya)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 41.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Good. Now our opponent is affected by Cryo. This is a good time to learn about {{Color|bp|Elemental Reactions}}!
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 42.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Different types of Elemental Damage affect enemies with different Elements. When a character is affected by certain elemental combos...
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 43.ogg}} '''Diona:''' An {{Color|bp|Elemental Reaction}} will be triggered!
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 44.ogg}} '''Diona:''' At the moment, your opponent is affected by Cryo, so we should try and use a Pyro Skill on them... Looks like we have to switch active characters, though.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 45.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Oh! That reminds me... Both sides must have one {{Color|bp|active character}}, while others are considered {{Color|bp|standby characters}}.
::Active characters will be in a more forward position compared to ones on standby.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 46.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Normally, we {{Color|bp|can only use the active character's Skills}}.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 47.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Now, if we want to use the Skills of our standby character, we'll have to {{Color|bp|switch them to the active character}}.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 48.ogg}} '''Diona:''' In this case, we'll have to {{Color|bp|switch to Diluc}} in order to use his Skills...
::Select Diluc
::Activate the Switch Character action
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 49.ogg}} '''Diona:''' You can {{Color|bp|spend 1 Elemental Die of any kind}} to switch a standby character to the active character.
::Spend 1 Hydro Die to switch your active character to Diluc
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 50.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Switching characters is an action, just like using a Skill, so once it's done, {{Color|bp|it's your opponent's turn}}.
:;(Diona's Blazing Axe Mitachurl uses Du Plama on Diluc)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 51.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Most Skills {{Color|bp|can only target the active character}}. As you can see, your opponent just attacked Diluc.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 52.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Alright then. Now that Diluc is our active character, it's time to use his Skill!
::Select Diluc's Elemental Skill
::Unlike Kaeya's Elemental Skill, Diluc's will deal Pyro DMG.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 53.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Because the opponent is already affected by Cryo, dealing Pyro DMG triggers the {{Color|bp|"Melt" Elemental Reaction}}.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 54.ogg}} '''Diona:''' When triggered, {{Color|bp|Melt}} increases DMG dealt by 2!
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 55.ogg}} '''Diona:''' This will allow you to deal loads of damage in one go! Haha! Genius Invokation's Elemental Reaction system is pretty cool, huh?
::Now, use an Elemental Reaction to defeat your opponent!
:;(Diluc uses Searing Onslaught on Diona's Blazing Axe Mitachurl and defeats it)
{{Dialogue End}}

===Genius Invokation TCG Basics (III): Action Cards and Support Effects===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 56.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Alright, haha. Next up, let's learn how to use card types other than Character Cards.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 57.ogg}} '''Diona:''' These Cards are all known as {{Color|bp|Action Cards}}.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 58.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Each time a match starts, you have to {{Color|bp|draw 5 Action Cards to form your starting hand}}.
:{{Black Screen|You attack first &mdash; Round 1}}
;(Roll Phase)
:;(The player rolls three Dendro Dice, two Geo Dice, two Anemo Dice, and one Hydro Die)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 59.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Uh-oh, looks like we don't have any Elemental Dice we can spend to make an attack...
::Guess we'll just have to reroll them all!
::Reroll all Elemental Dice
:;(The player now has two Geo Dice, two Dendro Dice, two Dendro Dice, one Hydro Die, and one Electro Die)

;(Action Phase)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 60.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Seriously!? We still don't have any usable dice even after that reroll?
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 61.ogg}} '''Diona:''' ...Well, never mind. Even in cases like this, we can still attack &mdash; we just need to put the Action Cards in our hand to good use!
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 62.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Don't underestimate {{Color|bp|Action Cards}}! They can grant all kinds of support and buffs to your Active Character. Take this one, for example...
::Expand Hand
::Select White Iron Greatsword
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 63.ogg}} '''Diona:''' So playing this Action Card will require {{tt|2× [[File:Genius Invokation TCG Matching Cost.png|20px]]|two of these}}. See this [[File:Genius Invokation TCG Matching Cost.png|20px]] symbol? Yeah, that means you'll need to play {{Color|bp|Elemental Dice of the same type}}.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 64.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Some other Cards will cost you {{tt|[[File:Genius Invokation TCG Unaligned Cost.png|20px]]|these}} instead. The cost requirements for {{tt|[[File:Genius Invokation TCG Unaligned Cost.png|20px]]|these}} are much more lenient. You can spend {{Color|bp|any kind of Elemental Dice}}.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 65.ogg}} '''Diona:''' We'll cross that bridge when we get there, though. For now, just play this Action Card.
::Drag this card onto the field to play it
::We need to spend 2 Elemental Dice of the same type to pay the cost shown here.
::Spend two Dice to equip this weapon
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 66.ogg}} '''Diona:''' So, playing an Action Card from your hand is a form of {{Color|bp|Fast Action}}. Fast Actions do not end your current turn.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 67.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Simply put, {{Color|bp|you can even continue to act even after playing an Action Card}}. Well then, you have your blade. Time to test it out!
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 68.ogg}} '''Diona:''' But wait... Diluc's Elemental Skill costs 3 Pyro Dice, and right now, we don't even have 1...
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 69.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Not a problem! This is where we can use a more advanced mechanic known as {{Color|bp|Elemental Tuning}}.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 70.ogg}} '''Diona:''' By discarding one card from your hand, you can convert one Elemental Die into the element of your {{Color|bp|current active character}}!
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 71.ogg}} '''Diona:''' And this card isn't useful right now, so we might as well use it for {{Color|bp|Elemental Tuning}}.
::Select {{Color|bp|Magic Guide}}
::Drag this card to the Elemental Dice Zone to use it to conduct Elemental Tuning
::Tune 1 Elemental Die to turn it into Pyro, Diluc's Element
<!--::Select 1 Elemental Die--><!--If the player deselects the Hydro Die-->
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 72.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Sometimes, you won't be able to perform any actions you want to, because you didn't roll the Elemental Dice you wanted. Oh well, moving on.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 73.ogg}} '''Diona:''' In Genius Invokation TCG, keeping up a constant flow of combat is much more important than the number of cards you have.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 74.ogg}} '''Diona:''' In this case, well... Let's just take all these useless cards and use them for {{Color|bp|Elemental Tuning}}!
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 75.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Just like playing cards from your hand, {{Color|bp|Elemental Tuning}} is a Fast Action.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 76.ogg}} '''Diona:''' C'mon, hurry up. Use {{Color|bp|Elemental Tuning}} to get yourself 3 Pyro Dice!
::Select {{Color|bp|Raven Bow}}
::Drag this card to the Elemental Dice Zone to use it to conduct Elemental Tuning
::Tune 1 Elemental Die to get a Pyro Die that matches your active character
::Select {{Color|bp|White Tassel}}
::Drag this card to the Elemental Dice Zone to use it to conduct Elemental Tuning
::Tune 1 Elemental Die to get 1 Pyro Die
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 77.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Well, well, well, would you look at that? Finally, we now have enough Elemental Dice to use Searing Onslaught.
::Collapse Hand
::Select Diluc's Elemental Skill
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 78.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Because you have the {{Color|bp|White Iron Greatsword}} equipped, {{Color|bp|Searing Onslaught}} will deal 1 extra DMG. What!?
::Luckily, that's just enough to defeat your opponent!
:;(Diluc uses Searing Onslaught on Diona's Hilichurl Berserker and defeats it)

===Genius Invokation TCG Basics (IV): Intent and Final Test===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 79.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Now comes the final part! Booyah! In a real match, you can {{Color|bp|make adjustments to your initial hand}}.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 80.ogg}} '''Diona:''' At this time, we can {{Color|bp|select any number of cards in our hand to shuffle back into the Draw Pile}}, and then draw the same number of new cards. Whaat?

::Return selected cards to your Draw Pile and shuffle, then draw an equal number of new cards
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 81.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Once you have confirmed any adjustments you wish to make to your starting hand, both players have to {{Color|bp|select their starting active character at the same time}}!

;(On Round 2)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 90.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Wait, wait, wait. There's one more thing I almost forgot...
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 91.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Every time you hit an End Phase, you get to {{Color|bp|draw 2 cards}} from your Action Cards pile!
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 92.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Remember, you have to make use of both your Elemental Dice and your Action Cards to win!

===After the Tutorial===
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Alright, cool, those are the basics. Did you get all that?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diona 02.ogg}} '''Diona:''' What we just played was an Adventure Challenge, designed specially for new players.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diona 03.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Genius Invokation TCG can be played in duel mode, where each player brings three Character Cards, or in Adventure Challenge mode, with a fixed deck for each challenge.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diona 04.ogg}} '''Diona:''' But the rules are all the same. As long as you understand the basics, then you should be able to take on any of those rowdy boozehounds!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Although I feel there are still many details to grasp, I think I understand the basic premise of the game now.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 01.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' That was quite the detailed explanation. I didn't know The Cat's Tail's famous mixologist had such an eclectic skillset.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diona 05.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Waah! Wha&mdash; Oh! When did YOU get here...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 02.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' I stepped in while you were in the middle of your explanation... I hope I didn't dampen the mood.

:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 05.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Never mind, it's nothing urgent. In fact, I think I'm now more interested in this card that you're using to teach them the game.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diona 09.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Wait, this card...?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's Diluc's Character Card.

:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diona 10.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Uh, a customer left it behind a few days ago. But he wasn't even playing the game while he was here.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 07.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Oh? And what sort of a customer was he?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diona 11.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Uh... He wasn't wearing an eyepatch, okay? He had a light complexion, and a super serious look on his face. He wasn't much of a talker, and looked like he was just drinking his worries away. Eh... never seen him around here before!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 08.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Eyepatch, you say...
:{{DIcon}} That's Kaeya...
:{{DIcon}} There's no doubt about it...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diona 12.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Gah, I was trying to give the opposite description, but I just ended up giving it away. Sorry, Guard Captain...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 09.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Don't worry. Somehow, I don't think he'll be giving you any trouble over it...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... what about the Diluc Character Card...?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 10.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' I don't mind. It's just a card with my image on it.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I didn't expect Diluc to be familiar with Genius Invokation TCG!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 11.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' The game has been catching on lately, it's hard to go anywhere without hearing it mentioned. Every now and then, I'll sit down and play a game with the customers in Angel's Share.
:{{DIcon}} You up for a game now?
:{{DIcon}} I challenge you to a duel!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 12.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' I was hoping we could play a game... But this issue of someone leaving a Character Card with my image at The Cat's Tail is... very intriguing.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 13.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' It's getting late, and someone has some explaining to do... We'll have to have that duel another time.
:{{DIcon}} Sure, I look forward to it!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diluc 14.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Good. Then I'll take my leave.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diona 13.ogg}} '''Diona:''' You know where the door is! Don't let the door hit ya where Lord Barbatos split ya!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diona 14.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Uh-oh... Guard Captain...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I hope Kaeya will be alright...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 sucrose 04.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Well, now that we are familiar with the rules, why don't we try playing a game of Genius Invokation TCG?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diona 15.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Ooh, two new players having their first ever duel... haha! This sounds like fun!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diona 16.ogg}} '''Diona:''' But, in order to play an official duel, you need to have three Character Cards.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 diona 17.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Remember, a complete deck has to have three Character Cards and thirty Action Cards. Got it?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 sucrose 05.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Then let's use my cards... These were mixed in with all the others I had received, and I didn't know what they were for at first. But now that we've learned the rules, I can see that this one must be the Sucrose Character Card.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 sucrose 06.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Now, it looks like we each have the Kaeya, Diluc, and Sucrose Character Cards. So why don't we have our first duel?
:{{DIcon|TCG}} If you say so!
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 sucrose 07a 1.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Alright, let's duel!
:{{DIcon}} ...Hold on, I need a moment. I'll be right back.
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 16 sucrose 07b 1.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Take your time, I look forward to our first duel.

;(Talk to Diona if the player selected "Hold on," optional)
:{{A|vo dialog tips tcg001 diona 06.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Hehehe, let's see how you and Sucrose get along in your duel.
:{{A|vo dialog tips tcg001 diona 07.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Now, I trained you myself, so you'd better not go down without a fight, okay! Huh, what? ...Well, yeah, I suppose I did train Sucrose, too... Hmm...

;(Talk to Sucrose if the player selected "Hold on")
:{{A|vo dialog tips tcg001 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Ready for our duel, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Let's play some Genius Invokation TCG!
::{{A|vo dialog tips tcg001 sucrose 03a 1.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Alright, let the duel begin!
:{{DIcon}} Not just yet, I need a moment...
::{{A|vo dialog tips tcg001 sucrose 03b 1.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Sure. Even though it's just a game, it's important to be fully prepared. In that case, I think I'll go over the card stats again...

;(Before the duel)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 93.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Unlike the Adventure Challenge you tried previously, duels are true tests of strength between two players.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 94.ogg}} '''Diona:''' In a {{Color|bp|duel}}, your opponent can also use Action Cards, and they will also be able to grab new cards during an End Phase.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 95.ogg}} '''Diona:''' At the same time, your opponent must also spend Elemental Dice to take actions, so you will be unable to view their Intent.
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 9 diona 96.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Hehe. Are you ready? It's time for some exhilarating fights to the bitter end! Myeowza!

;(When the player defeats one of Sucrose's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 2 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Darn... I didn't factor that in to the equation...

;(When the player defeats two of Sucrose's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 3 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Oh... I wasn't expecting that.

;(When Sucrose defeats one of the player's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 1 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Okay, one Character Card defeated...

;(When Sucrose uses an Elemental Burst)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 4 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' According to the rules, it costs Dice and Energy to unleash an Elemental Burst...

;(After defeating Sucrose)
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 19 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I can't believe I lost when we had the exact same Character Cards... The rules must be more complicated than I first thought.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 19 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Every decision is a difficult trade-off in this game. If there was only a way to transplant the arms of the two standby characters onto the active character's body&mdash;
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 19 diona 01.ogg}} '''Diona:''' That's not how the rules work, Sucrose. Don't be a sore loser. That kind of thing is looked down on in TCG circles.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 19 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Oh, I am sorry... I was beaten fair and square, I know that. I just can't stand losing.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 19 sucrose 04.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' But it was a fun match.
:{{DIcon}} You went easy on me.
:{{DIcon}} It was a close call...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 19 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon didn't know you could get so competitive, Sucrose.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 19 sucrose 05.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I always get a little upset when I lose.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 19 sucrose 06.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' It's like that with my research, too. It always gets to me when my experiments don't go as planned, especially when there's an alchemy genius like Albedo around to compare myself to...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 19 diona 02.ogg}} '''Diona:''' ...Uhh, you lost me at "alchemy" and "experiments." But I'm pretty sure it's normal to feel that way.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 19 diona 03.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Playing cards is no different. Each game you lose makes you wanna win the next one to settle the score, and the desire to win pushes you to improve your strategy and build a better deck.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 19 diona 04.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Hehe! Seizing victory through a winning combination of luck, skill, and experience is where all the fun of Genius Invokation lies!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 19 sucrose 07.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' ...But what if you keep trying and trying, and never win a single game?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 19 diona 05.ogg}} '''Diona:''' A losing streak... Yeah, that'll definitely get you down. But it's way better to keep trying until you win than to just accept you're a plain old loser and give up!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 19 sucrose 08.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Hmm... you make a good point, Diona.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 19 diona 06.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Besides, Sucrose, you're already making great progress. It'd take at least eight of our regular boozehounds to match your level. You played well this last match!
:{{DIcon}} Agreed. It was a brilliant game.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 19 sucrose 09.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Thank you... I'm just a little disappointed to lose, that's all. But Genius Invokation TCG is a really fun game.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 19 diona 07.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Good. Having fun is the main thing. If you ever wanna play again in the future, feel free to come by The Cat's Tail... Ah, but don't expect me to play with you, I just mean this place probably has the right atmosphere...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 19 sucrose 10.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I'll definitely be back.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 19 diona 08.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Alright, I think you should have the basics down by now. I need to get back to bartending &mdash; Shuyun's likely been busy making this tavern more popular with his delicious cocktails... Phooey, phooey, phooey! And we can't have that.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 19 diona 09.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Hmph! Burning Mondstadt's wine industry to the ground keeps me pretty busy, y'know! So if you need any more help, go bother Shuyun!

;(Talk to Diona again)
:{{A|vo dialog tips tcg001 diona 08.ogg}} '''Diona:''' I have to make drinks for the customers now...
:{{A|vo dialog tips tcg001 diona 09.ogg}} '''Diona:''' If you've got any more questions about Genius Invokation TCG, you can go ask Shuyun. He's over there.

;(Talk to Shuyun or Prince)
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 01.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' I see, so you have now grasped the rules of Genius Invokation TCG.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehehe, that's right! {{Traveler}}, Sucrose, and Paimon are TCG players now!
:{{DIcon}} I didn't notice you play any matches, Paimon...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Paimon picked it up from watching you and Sucrose!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 02.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Meow... "Becoming a TCG player is not as simple as that. You cannot call yourselves true TCG players until you have passed the test."
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 03.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Sobering words from Prince there... But I'm afraid he's right. To become official players recognized by the [[Genius Invokation TCG Society]], you have to pass the test.
:{{DIcon}} There's really a test?
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 04a 1.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Yes, although to be honest, it's not that difficult...
:{{DIcon}} What does it entail? Sealing a Samachurl within a deck of cards?
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 04b 1.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' It's just a tabletop card game. I'm not sure how you would plan on achieving something like that...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 05.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Basically, to become an official and recognized TCG player, you have to best three opponents in a duel.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' So you have to win three duels against three different opponents?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 06.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Meow... "The duel you just played can count towards this tally..."
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 07.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' I agree. Although I didn't get to observe the match myself, I did listen along. And from what I could hear, you both performed at a rather high level.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Same way you can "hear" what Prince says...?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 08.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' A well-trained ear is a basic skill expected of anyone hoping to become a TCG master. But back to the matter at hand &mdash; {{Traveler}} only needs to beat two more opponents to become an official TCG player.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 09.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Sucrose, you may have lost the last duel, but don't be disheartened. I can assure you that winning three games is well within your ability.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 10.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Meow... "But first things first, Shuyun. Before that, our TCG newcomers should receive their free gift..."
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 11.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Ah yes, my goodness. Completely slipped my mind &mdash; I'm lucky to have Prince here to remind me. Everyone who wants to start playing Genius Invokation TCG is entitled to claim a free Casket of Tomes.
:{{DIcon}} A Casket of Tomes?
:{{DIcon}} Where have I heard that before?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Oh, Timaeus mentioned it, didn't he? It was from the light novels he's been reading. The thing that the main character found in his attic...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohh, that's right. The soul of an ancient TCG player was trapped inside, right?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So the Casket of Tomes is actually real?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 12.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Heh, well... actually, all card cases in Genius Invokation TCG are called Caskets of Tomes. Not only do they provide a reliable and sturdy container to store your decks, they can also sense when other people in the area are also carrying a Casket of Tomes with them&mdash;
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, Paimon can guess what you're gonna say next &mdash; the reason they can sense each other is because they have the souls of ancient TCG players inside!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 13.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' That would mean an extraordinarily high number of people in history have been turned into disembodied souls as a consequence of playing card games... No, the real reason that it can sense other Caskets is because it holds a nifty little mechanism invented by Sumeru scholars...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Darn, what a letdown...
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like a convenient way of finding other TCG players.
:{{DIcon}} Cool! A TCG friend finder!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, now let's see this Casket of Tomes already!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 14.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' "Meow! All Caskets of Tomes are issued by Margaret, so you will need to see her to claim yours..."
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 15.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Probably for the best. If Prince and I were responsible for handing them out, knowing how eager we both are to promote the game, we'd probably have dished them all out by now...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 16.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Okay, so go and see Margaret to claim your Casket of Tomes, use it to find another player, beat them in a duel, and then come back here.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' But even for {{Traveler}}, that's only two wins in total. What about the last one?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 17a.ogg}} {{A|vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 17b.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Meow... "I shall choose the final contestant {{MC|m=he|f=she}} must beat in order to become an official TCG player, for it must be one of comparable prowess."
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 21 suyun 18.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Excellent plan, Prince! Happy dueling, both of you.

;(Talk to Prince or Shuyun again)
:{{A|vo dialog tips tcg001 suyun 05.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Meow... "Go, claim your Casket of Tomes, seize victory, and become a TCG champion!"
:{{A|vo dialog tips tcg001 suyun 06.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Prince seems to have high hopes for you.

;(Talk to Diona again)
:{{A|vo dialog tips tcg001 diona 10.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Ugh, let me guess &mdash; you're here to order a drink, hmph... Oh, it's you. So, how are your Genius Invokation matches going?
:{{A|vo dialog tips tcg001 diona 11.ogg}} '''Diona:''' You need to win three matches to become an official TCG player? Ohh yeah, now you mention it, I remember there being some sort of rule about that. Why'd they have to make it so competitive? It's just a game, why can't people just have fun!
:{{A|vo dialog tips tcg001 diona 12.ogg}} '''Diona:''' Hmph, I'll never understand why grown-ups have to put a bunch of stupid rules on everything.

:{{A|vo tips tcg001 24 margaret 01.ogg}} '''Margaret:''' Hello you three, has Little Diona finished teaching you the rules of Genius Invokation?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 24 margaret 02.ogg}} '''Margaret:''' Ah, I see, you're here for your Casket of Tomes, aren't you? A very useful tool indeed.
::[[File:Item Casket of Tomes.png|120x120px]]
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 24 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' So this is a Casket of Tomes.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 24 margaret 03.ogg}} '''Margaret:''' That's right. A purpose-built case for your card deck, that can even detect when someone else nearby is carrying one... Gosh, whoever invented this must have seriously disliked being alone.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 24 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah. Well, even the most fun game is pretty lonely if you've got no one else to play it with.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 24 margaret 04.ogg}} '''Margaret:''' True. So I'm glad that these customers... ahem, TCG players are able to congregate at The Cat's Tail.
:{{DIcon}} Can't be bad for business...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 24 margaret 05.ogg}} '''Margaret:''' You're not wrong, but that's secondary. The important thing to me is the opportunity for like-minded people to come together and enjoy their favorite hobby. It creates a nice atmosphere... Anyway, now you have your Caskets of Tomes, it's time to find some opponents.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 24 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Alright. In that case, I'll go find some people to play against, too. Let's meet back at The Cat's Tail in a while!
:{{DIcon}} Trust in your cards.

:{{A|vo tips tcg001 32 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, is that right...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 32 oz 01.ogg}} '''Oz:''' Indeed, mein Fräulein has watched many games of Genius Invokation TCG, and has gained a solid grasp of the rules. Even in a duel between beginners, it is best that both participants are well-versed in them.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 32 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that's true.
:{{DIcon}} A duel between beginners?
:{{DIcon}} When you say "watched" many games...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 32 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh, this makes sense now. Prince did say that he was gonna pair us with someone of a similar skill level... Guess that means Fischl hasn't been playing that long either!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 32 fischl 04.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Hmph, the Prinzessin needed but a single glance at these mere machinations of mankind to discern their working principles. Thus, with speed and brilliance paralleled by lightning alone do I now arrive here at the gateway to yonder circle of secrets...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 32 oz 02.ogg}} '''Oz:''' Mein Fräulein, too, has bested two opponents thus far, and is therefore one step away from becoming an official TCG player.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 32 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So there's a lot on the line, huh? Either Fischl or {{Traveler}} is gonna come out of this duel as an official TCG player...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 32 oz 03.ogg}} '''Oz:''' Indeed.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 32 fischl 05.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Hmph! The Prinzessin herself heeds the call of fate and descends to this realm from the Immernachtreich, yet still you dare to doubt the inevitability of the inevitable. Your stubborn foolishness is contemptible.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 32 oz 04.ogg}} '''Oz:''' Mein Fräulein, I implore you to consider less odious turns of phrase, lest you be forced to feast on your words in the fullness of time.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 32 fischl 06.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Wh&mdash; ...I shall not lose, Oz!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 32 fischl 07.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' What say you, outlander? Do you wish to make an enemy of me, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, who even now begins to strum the strings of fate that shall sound out the Traveler's Requiem?
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Verily, 'tis time to duel!
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 32 fischl 08a 1.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Then I say it is time to see what you are made of!
:{{DIcon}} Wait, wait, wait, I need to check my deck first...
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 32 fischl 08b 1.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Oh, do you? How disappointing. But then again, for one accustomed to the petty burdens of this lowly realm, to challenge the Prinzessin is a load under which most mere mortals would crumble.

;(Talk to Fischl if the player selected "Wait, wait, wait")
:{{A|vo dialog tips tcg001 fischl 01.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' I ask you once again, outlander: Do you wish to make an enemy of me?
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Verily, 'tis time to duel!
::{{A|vo dialog tips tcg001 fischl 02a 1.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Then it is time to see what you are made of!
:{{DIcon}} Not yet... I entreat Your Majesty to ask me again later...
::{{A|vo dialog tips tcg001 fischl 02b 1.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Very well, I will ask you again when the time comes. But be warned, should you seek to flee when the hour of the battle draws nigh... I shall show you no mercy.

;(When the player defeats one of Fischl's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 6 fischl 01.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' This is but a small sacrifice, necessary to achieve ultimate victory.

;(When the player defeats two of Fischl's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 7 fischl 01.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Ah, what happened... Oz! With lightning twixt upper and lower mandible, strike thy pointy beak into this obstacle, and remove it from my path!
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 7 oz 01.ogg}} '''Oz:''' Mein Fräulein, I cannot simply attack the Traveler!

;(When Fischl defeats one of the player's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 5 fischl 01.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Hahaha, now see what happens to those who dare defy the Prinzessin!

;(When Fischl uses an Elemental Burst)
:{{A|vo tips tcg002 8 fischl 01.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Hmph! As the cryptic chronicles of fate have prophesized, so do I command: In the name of the Prinzessin, deal your almighty final blow, and bring all that moves in the heavens to an everlasting standstill!

;(Talk to Fischl if the player is defeated)
:{{A|vo dialog tips tcg001 fischl 03.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' It seems that you fall short of the superior skills of the Prinzessin. But I know you, Traveler, and even this shall not stop you from facing me again!
:{{DIcon|TCG}} I will face you again right here, right now!
::{{A|vo dialog tips tcg001 fischl 04a 1.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Then show me once more what you are made of!
:{{DIcon}} Yes! ...But I need a moment to rethink my strategy first.
::{{A|vo dialog tips tcg001 fischl 04b 1.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Very well. When you think you are ready, I shall be right here waiting for you.

;(After defeating Fischl)
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 36 fischl 01.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Impossible... Ugh, the cursed dragon looms near once more, casting its dark shadow on the slender threads of fate, hiding them from my vision...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 36 fischl 02.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Traveler... Was even this part of your plan?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 36 oz 01.ogg}} '''Oz:''' What a truly ingenious plot, and what an exciting duel to witness.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 36 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Congratulations! You've won three duels now. That makes you an official TCG player!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 36 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! ...Oh, Sucrose, you're back. Does that mean...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 36 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Yep, I've won two games so far. When I got back, I heard you were in the middle of your final duel, so I came over to watch.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 36 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nice, Sucrose won two as well. Great work!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 36 fischl 03.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Hmph. It seems I am forced to admit, fellow voyager of the stellar void, that your... mastery of the cards is second to none.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 36 fischl 04.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' To commemorate your glorious ascent to a battlefield beyond this lowly mortal realm, I grant thee an incarnation of my majesty in miniature. As you embark on this ingenious vocation, may you wield it in battle against all your fated foes, that not a single one of them may be left standing.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 36 oz 02.ogg}} '''Oz:''' Mein Fräulein wishes to give you a Mein Fräulein Character Card.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 36 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, it's Fischl's Character Card!
:{{DIcon}} I dare not take advantage of the Prinzessin's generosity...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 36 fischl 05.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' 'Tis a mere token of such. To the victor of this splendid duel is a boon of commensurate splendor due.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 36 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Oh, um, excuse me Ma'am, I am also a beginner who has won two games so far. Might I also have the honor of joining you in a duel? If you would be willing, of course.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 36 fischl 06.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Nothing would delight me more. I hereby grant you permission to join me in performing the hallowed rite of Genius Invokation.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 36 sucrose 04.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' One other thing. When I got back, Prince and Shuyun said there was something they needed to give you if you managed to become an official TCG player.
:{{DIcon}} Hopefully not another test...
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 36 paimon 04a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Probably not... Oh, Paimon bets it's some kind of prize for making it as an official TCG player!
:{{DIcon}} Hopefully an instant victory card?
::{{A|vo tips tcg001 36 paimon 04b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No card game in the world has a card like that. Paimon bets it's some kind of prize for making it as an official TCG player!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 36 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go get our prize!
:;(Obtain {{Item|Fischl (Character Card)}})

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 38 fischl 01.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' With three Electro Dice, I summon my eternal familiar, Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, to my side. Heed my invokation!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 38 oz 01.ogg}} '''Oz:''' But mein Fräulein, I have been by your side all along.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 38 fischl 02.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' I mean in the game, Oz.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 38 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Hmm... Then I'll use Chaotic Entropy to invoke a Large Wind Spirit...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 38 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' That deals increased damage when it carries an element other than Anemo, so...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 38 fischl 03.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Oh... So be it, one shall not be swayed by such a feeble attack...

;(Talk to Fischl or Sucrose again)
:'''Confrontation Duel:''' (Fischl and Sucrose are playing Genius Invokation TCG. Maybe it's best not to interrupt their game...)

;(Talk to Shuyun or Prince)
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 37 suyun 01.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Ah, so it WAS you who won the duel in the end. I knew you'd do it! Congratulations, you are now officially recognized members of the Genius Invokation TCG community!
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 37 suyun 02.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Meow... "Very well done. Now, I will explain to you what becoming an official TCG player entails."
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 37 suyun 03.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Meow... "The first thing all new official TCG players receive is their TCG Player's Handbook."
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 37 suyun 04.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' This handbook tells you exactly what you need to do to become a top-tier TCG player. Make sure you read it.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 37 suyun 05.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Secondly, a range of Genius Invokation merchandise is now available to you for purchase here at The Cat's Tail. Hehe, so you see, becoming an official TCG player is really just the first step.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 37 suyun 06.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Meow... "And thirdly, whenever you wish to play a game with a friend, you can use the Invitation Board there. Whoever you wish to duel against, simply invite them to the tavern for a game."
:{{DIcon}} Invitation Board?
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 37 suyun 07.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Yes, it's right by the bar counter. Once you get the hang of it, you can play with your friends whenever you want.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 37 suyun 08.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' That's it, really. If there's anything you didn't quite understand, you can always come and ask me.
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 37 littleprince 01.ogg}} '''Prince:''' Meow...
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 37 suyun 09.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' Yes indeed, I'm quite sure they will. ...Oh, sorry, I forgot to translate for you. Prince would like to say:
:{{A|vo tips tcg001 37 suyun 10.ogg}} '''Shuyun:''' "{{Traveler}}, hope you'll have fun playing Genius Invokation TCG!"
