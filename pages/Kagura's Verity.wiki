==Description==
Where once there were [[Mikoshi Clan|dances]] before the throne, the [[Hakushin Clan|sounds of the bells]] still linger.<br>
[[Kitsune Saiguu|The white silhouette]], once something to pursue, [[Cataclysm|never returned]], yet it remains an unceasing dream from which one cannot wake...

"[[Yae Miko|I]] was a silly little thing back then, nowhere near as intelligent as our great matriarch [[Hakushin]]."<br>
"Groping about clumsily, I was a whelp foraging through the snow, hoping to draw [[Electro Archon|Her Excellency]]<!--Unclear whether this refers to Ei or Makoto due to the memories being pre-cataclysm-->'s attention."<br>
"Funnily enough, it was exactly because of my foolhardy courage that Her Excellency had pity on me."<br>
"And that's how I came into her service. You know, warming her hands and feet and all. Very great honor."

"Lady Saiguu would later depart, never to return, and those [[Urakusai|seniors of mine]] would also be lost due to various other reasons."<br>
"And that was how someone as bumbling as I took up the role of "Miko" and grew into the person you know today."<br>
"Thus it was in this way that the unfortunate task of putting a smile on Her Excellency's face fell squarely on my shoulders."<br>
"The night when I first performed the Kagura dance, I felt the weight of the 'past.'"

The tinkling of the bells grew distant, and the great silver kitsune, master and friend, disappeared into the winding river of dreams.<br>
The bells sounded again, and the obstinate sandbar loosened and dissolved into the swirling current.<br>
The pure white, gentle figure of the past had long drifted into dark memory.<br>
So the lone daughter of the great kitsune lineage would take up the Kagura bells, and dance for the vibrant "now."

I knew a [[Kujou Sara|young and obstinate tengu warrior]], and used the pretext of "training" to bluff her into asceticism in the mountains,<br>
But sensing her unruly nature, I recommended her to those block-headed [[Kujou Clan|Kujou]].<br>
And though I once had a competition against an [[Arataki Itto|obstinate oni]] and was defeated by dint of sheer perseverance...<br>
I did add a [[A Bag of Beans|few little tricks]] to make our contest more interesting.<br>
I corresponded with a [[Ganyu|half-adeptus]] from a [[Liyue|distant land]], and gifted her fresh and supple [[Sea Ganoderma|ocean plants]].<br>
Still, I felt keenly that I could not understand her almost foolish love. Is that not a form of bondage for the adepti?<br>
The moonlight sweeps across the imperial garden through branch and petal, alighting upon the empty courtyard.<br>
That scene still glows brightly in my shallow heart like countless glimmering jewels...

"In the short span of these few hundred years, I have walked the earth in many guises."<br>
"Though I have not had the fortune to have deep relationships with ordinary people, I came to know human beauty deeply."<br>
"And Her Excellency, whom I might dare to call friend, should have more time yet to roam this world."<br>
"So let us see this imperfect world together and enjoy its obsessions with love and hate, with meetings and partings."

With Her Excellency engrossed in her dream-real of Eternity, someone needed to look out for the common folk.<br>
To quell the resentment of the wicked oni Kuroami, I once showed but a hint of the ominous power I wield.<br>
And the great disturbance caused by Kosanta the Bald Tanuki would be made sport of with a little application of magic.<br>
The marauding pirate [[Rinzou's Letter|Rinzou]], terror of the archipelago, would also be betrayed over some small discordance in plans.<br>
And as for that blank slate, that [[Scaramouche|immortal eccentric]]...<br>
I hope "he" will find his way and not become a threat to us all.<br>
[[Takamine the Mistsplitter|The darkened remains of the swordmaster's soul]], the beasts of catastrophe hiding in the [[Chinju Forest|sacred forest]], they were all wiped out...<br>
Compared to the dream of Eternity Her Excellency pursues, such things were but fleeting interludes,<br>
And the wait for her to come around seemed to stretch out infinitely, but I knew that time was on our side.

"I mean, a Euthymia without wind or moon, with lotuses and udumbara that do not wither,"<br>
"I'm sorry, but the loneliness would get to me. I'd be bored to tears."<br>
"I'd much rather snap off [[Thunder Sakura]] branches in a drunken haze and cavort with the impudent [[youkai]]."<br>
"And no, these are not stories of the ancient past, but of a future full of hope."<br>
"So, {{sic|You}} Excellency, might I still have the pleasure of joining you to watch the first pale purple buds that emerge when the snow next melts?"
