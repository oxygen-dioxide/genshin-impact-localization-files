'''Shafaqat''' was a former researcher at [[Sumeru Akademiya]] who was exiled to [[Aaru Village]] in the [[Great Red Sand]], [[Sumeru]], where he eventually died.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Gifted Rose: Ballad of Days Gone By}}</ref>

==Story==
{{Quote|Rose, oh roses, grant me my wish. Blooming from the stone, the Golden Rose sang to me.<br />No land but folk songs bore my spirit. Songs shall defy my fate, and overcome my destiny.<br />They will surpass me, surpass time. They will surpass the ever-lasting withering of life...|Shafaqat's folk song}}
Shafaqat was a top researcher at Sumeru Akademiya, presumably in the [[Amurta]] Darshan due to his cultivation of a new species of flower called the Golden Rose. However, for some reason, he was ultimately exiled to Aaru Village. Despite his circumstances, he managed to cultivate a garden in the barren desert and befriended the children there.<ref name="Stones Bloom">{{Ref/Quest|A Gifted Rose: Can Stones Bloom}}</ref>

As the years went on, however, Shafaqat became more and more disillusioned by his situation. Realizing that his daughter, whom he had been forced to leave while she was still a child, was by now grown up, he came to despise children and his demeanor gave him the nickname "old ghost" among the villagers. Only [[Affan]] still respected him and treasured that which Shafaqat left behind after his death.<ref name="Stones Bloom" />
