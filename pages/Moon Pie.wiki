'''Moon Pie''' is a [[food]]  that the player can cook. The recipe for Moon Pie is obtainable from [[Hertha]] for reaching [[Reputation]] Level 7 in [[Mondstadt]].

Depending on the quality, Moon Pie increases all party members' Shield Strength by '''25'''/'''30'''/'''35'''% and defense by '''165'''/'''200'''/'''235''' for 300 seconds. Like most foods, this has no effect for other players in [[Co-Op Mode]].

When [[Eula]] cooks Moon Pie, there is a chance [[Stormcrest Pie]] will be created instead.

==Trivia==
*The name of the dish is fitting for a traditional dish of Mondstadt, which is German for "Moon City."
*This dish is probably based on {{w|Beef Wellington}}, an English steak dish that appeared around 1900.
*There is also a speculation that it is based on {{w|Pithivier}}, a pie from the French cuisine whose filling is typically a sweet ingredient such as frangipane but can be meat as well.<ref>Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/GifRecipes/comments/l3ixsa/moon_pie_from_genshin_impact_french_pithivier/ Moon Pie from Genshin Impact (French Pithivier)]</ref>
