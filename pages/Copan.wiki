'''Copan''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in the {{Quest|Moment of Awakening}}. 

He was the founder and self-proclaimed president of the [[Saurian Relics Association (Faction)|Saurian Relics Association]].<ref>Interactable: [[Furnace of Fiery Embers#Nameless Traveler's Notes (I)|Nameless Traveler's Notes (I)]]</ref><ref>{{Ref/Arti|Wandering Scholar's Claw Cup}}</ref><ref group="Note">The lore of the Artifact [[Wandering Scholar's Claw Cup]] mentioned that the founder of the [[Saurian Relics Association (Faction)|Saurian Relics Association]] was from the [[Collective of Plenty]]. As Copan was the only known member who was from the tribe based on his attires, he was likely the founder.</ref> After the [[Cataclysm]] struck, he joined the [[Ochkanatlan Adventure Team]]'s quest to reach the [[Tonatiuh]]. He, like most of his teammates, ultimately perished at the hands of [[Waxaklahun Ubah Kan]].
