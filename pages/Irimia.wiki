{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Joliot:''' Oh Archons, please grant us a healthy and wise child!
:'''Irimia:''' Hmm... Well, I wouldn't ask for intelligence or talent, but please, may our child live a peaceful life!
:'''Joliot:''' Uh, honey, is it just me, or did you ask for more than I did, somehow?
:'''Irimia:''' Shh, you'll jinx it! Also, what's so excessive about asking that our child grow up well?
:'''Joliot:''' That's not what I'm saying, it's just, in light of that "prophecy"...
:'''Irimia:''' Ah, right. That's true...
:'''Irimia:''' But it's just a legend, and not something that will happen for sure, right?

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Joliot:''' Oh Archons, please grant us a healthy and wise child!
:'''Irimia:''' Erm... Can you still say that? The Hydro Archon seems to have left...
:'''Joliot:''' That doesn't matter. I'm referring to all Archons!
:'''Joliot:''' And the Hydro Archon only lost her powers to help Fontaine. So the Archons do look after us, don't they?
:'''Irimia:''' That is true. But I wouldn't make such big requests.
:'''Irimia:''' Well, I wouldn't ask for my child to be clever or talented. Just for them to have a peaceful life!
