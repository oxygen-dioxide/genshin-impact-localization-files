;(Before completing [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]])
:'''Matsukawa Souzen:''' *sigh* ...Hello, do you need something?
:{{DIcon}} You seem upset.
::'''Matsukawa Souzen:''' As an officer with a duty towards Inazuma, I should naturally be upset about the current state of the nation.
::'''Matsukawa Souzen:''' *sigh* ...When I think about the endless fighting between the [[Shogunate]] and the [[Watatsumi Army|rebels]], I can't even sleep or eat.
::'''Matsukawa Souzen:''' If it keeps going on like this, Inazuma's finances will continue to worsen with each passing day. It's only a matter of time before it starts to affect the lives of the people...
::'''Matsukawa Souzen:''' I hope that [[Raiden Shogun|Her Excellency]] can act soon and fix the situation from the root of the problem herself...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Matsukawa Souzen:''' *sigh* ...Goodbye.

;(After completing [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]])
:'''Matsukawa Souzen:''' *sigh* ...Hello, do you need something?
:{{DIcon}} Something seems to be troubling you.
::'''Matsukawa Souzen:''' Inazuma has just gone through a series of changes. A new era is coming.
::'''Matsukawa Souzen:''' To be honest, all this has made me too busy to have time for anything else, but I don't think that this is a bad thing, necessarily.
::'''Matsukawa Souzen:''' Her Excellency has seems to have had something of a change of mood. I can only hope that...
::'''Matsukawa Souzen:''' Ah, I shall not speak of this now. Whatever the case, our work in clearing our accounts is far busier than usual. Perhaps we can chat again some other time.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Matsukawa Souzen:''' Indeed. Farewell.
