Whether as a maid helping those around me or in my daily training, I strive to be the best I can be.

Still, there are times when I do feel like I can't go on anymore...

At times like these, I look to the stars. The thought of you, far more brilliant than me, persevering somewhere under the night sky makes me feel like my fatigue is not worth mentioning.

The day has finally come and it feels a little earlier than expected. I admit that I feel slightly nervous but not as much as I am excited. Now, I can finally show you the fruits of my labor.

I hope you'll be here to see it!
