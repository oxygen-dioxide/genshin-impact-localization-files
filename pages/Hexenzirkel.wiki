The '''Hexenzirkel''' is an organization of powerful witches or mages, founded by [[Alice]],<ref>[[Imaginarium Theater/Fortune Slips|Imaginarium Theater Fortune Slip]]: ''To be honest, we weren't the most familiar of people in the organization Alice founded.''</ref> which conducts [[Irminsul]] explorations and gathers around for "formal tea parties."<ref name="lisa">{{Ref/VO|Lisa|About Mona}}</ref> One place they met was [[Hexenzirkel's Island in the Sky|a secret island]] above [[Falcon Coast]].

==Overview==
The coven is comprised of powerful beings, with some possessing abilities that rival even the [[god]]s of [[Teyvat]].

According to [[Skirk]], [[Rhinedottir]] is similar to Skirk's master [[Surtalogi]], in that they are both "pursuing some form of perfection." Rhinedottir is well known for her practice of the [[Art of Khemia]], which she used to create beings such as [[Albedo]], [[Durin]], and the [[Riftwolf|Rifthounds]]. She was also described as "a flower that is not of this world,"<ref name="joy">{{Ref/Quest|Joy Above the Clouds}}</ref> suggesting that she does not originate from Teyvat.

Alice possesses the power to lift or mold entire island systems on command, and has a longer lifespan than normal humans.

[[Nicole]] is aware of changes made to Irminsul.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As Though Morning Dew}}</ref> Like a prophetess, she only speaks to guide people toward the truth when a major change has occurred.<ref name="joy"/>

[[Barbeloth]] is an astrologist who pioneered the study of divination in Teyvat, even taking students under her wing, such as [[Mona]].

Some members of the Hexenzirkel are human, including [[Andersdotter]] and [[I. Ivanovna N.]]. There are at least eight members of the Hexenzirkel according to various imagery in the game's media.

==Members==
Currently, there is little information on the Hexenzirkel's establishment, succeeding members, and joining and leaving processes.

===Successors===
Becoming a {{lang|successor|zh=继承者/继承人|zh_tl=heir}} to a Hexenzirkel member does not guarantee Hexenzirkel membership.
*[[Scarlett]], successor of J

==Trivia==
*Despite the eight portraits shown in the representative image of the Hexenzirkel, the tea party table in both the cutscene and in the open world only has seven chairs, and only six members were immediately identified in ''Joy Above the Clouds''.
**The missing chair is most likely Octavia's, as the witches in ''[[The Little Witch and the Undying Fire]]'' typically do not prepare a chair for her at their tea parties, due to her frequent traveling.
*Not all witches are members of the Hexenzirkel. [[Lisa]], the Witch of Purple Rose,<ref>{{Ref/VO|Lisa|Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion}}</ref> explicitly denies her interest in the Hexenzirkel.<ref name="lisa" /> [[La Signora]], who was once known as the Crimson Witch of Flame, has no known ties to the Hexenzirkel and takes great offense to being called a "witch" at all.<ref>[[Narukami Island: Tenshukaku]] Combat Voice-Over, Phase 2: [[Narukami Island: Tenshukaku#Phase 2 4|The Witch's Wrath]]</ref>
*It is unknown if Alice's "acknowledgment" of [[Scarlett]] is also an invitation to join the Hexenzirkel.
*Based on [[Lisa/Voice-Overs|Lisa's voice-over]] about Mona as well as her status as Barbeloth's student, it seems like [[Mona]] is affiliated with the Hexenzirkel. However, Mona does not seem to be familiar with the other Hexenzirkel members, as she says, "Who would have guessed that there are so many mysterious women in this world, and that they would all know each other..." after Alice's explanation in ''Joy Above the Clouds''. Scarlett also describes Mona as Barbeloth's {{lang|student|zh=弟子}}, not her {{lang|successor|zh=继承者/继承人|zh_tl=heir}}.
*During {{Quest|Beyond This World's Stars}}, Mona originally thought that Alice had a {{lang|successor|zh=继承者/继承人|zh_tl=heir}}, who would be guarding a certain box that Mona was sent to retrieve. The person with the box turned out to be [[Klee]], who does not appear to be Alice's successor, as she has not learned any of Alice's mystical arts.
*Mona's special dish [[Der Weisheit Letzter Schluss (Life)|Der Weisheit letzter Schluss]] is a direct quote of the play "Faust" by the German poet Goethe. In ''Faust'', a coven of witches convenes on top of the windy mountain Brocken in Germany's Harz Mountains, an area infamous for its folklore of witches and witchcraft. This is parallel to how the Hexenzirkel meets on top of a mountain.
===Etymology===
*"Hexenzirkel" is German for "Circle of Witches," and could also be more commonly translated to "Coven of Witches."
