The '''Hexenzirkel''' is an organization of witches which conducts [[Irminsul]] explorations and gathers around for "formal tea parties."<ref name="lisa">{{Ref/VO|Lisa|About Mona}}</ref>

Not all witches are members. [[Lisa]], the Witch of Purple Rose,<ref>{{Ref/VO|Lisa|Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion}}</ref> explicitly denies her interest in the Hexenzirkel.<ref name="lisa" /> [[La Signora]], who was once known as the Crimson Witch of Flame, has no known ties to the Hexenzirkel and takes great offense to being called a "witch" at all.<ref>[[Narukami Island: Tenshukaku]] Combat Voice-Over, Phase 2: [[Narukami Island: Tenshukaku#Phase 2 4|The Witch's Wrath]]</ref>

Rhinedottir, Nicole, "J" (succeeded by Scarlett), "B" (of which Mona is a student), and "M," were all revealed to be members of the Hexenzirkel during ''[[Joy Above the Clouds]]''. Their "codenames" were given in the mentioned quest.
The names of "J" and "B" were later given in the description of ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RigK4OwCCM8 Story Teaser: The Mages' Tea Party | Genshin Impact]'' along with the VAs.

==Trivia==
*[[Mona]]'s special dish [[Der Weisheit Letzter Schluss (Life)|Der Weisheit letzter Schluss]] is a direct quote of the play "Faust" by the German poet Goethe. In ''Faust'', a coven of witches convenes on top of the windy mountain Brocken in Germany's Harz Mountains, an area infamous for its folklore of witches and witchcraft. 
*If the player has completed ''[[Inversion of Genesis]]'', during the final section of ''Joy Above the Clouds'', the Traveler will question whether the strange voice they heard at the end of [[As Though Morning Dew]] was actually Nicole.
