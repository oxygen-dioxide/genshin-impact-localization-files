'''Tumbleweeds''' can be found rolling across the [[Great Red Sand]]. When ran into or attacked, they will be destroyed and have a chance to drop an item such as [[Bird Egg]], [[Ajilenakh Nut]], or an [[Artifact]].

Destroying a tumbleweed for the first time earns the achievement [[Drifting in the Wind]].

==Trivia==
* Tumbleweeds do not count towards the delay cap of [[Investigation]] per day.
