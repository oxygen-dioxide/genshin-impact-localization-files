==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yamada:''' Hmm? Is there something you need? If not, I need to get back to my slips.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
:;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:::'''Yamada:''' I am drawing [[Fortune Slip|fortune slips]]. I wish that the [[Ei|Almighty Shogun]] will change her mind and lift the [[Sakoku Decree]] soon...
:::'''Yamada:''' But I have already drawn slips several times. They either read "Misfortune" or "Great Misfortune"! Alas, what an awful day!
:::'''Yamada:''' Because of the restrictions of the Sakoku Decree, I can no longer sail out for business. The goods I have now are all stuck.
:::'''Yamada:''' Business has not been smooth at all, and even the Grand Narukami Shrine can't save me... Is it because my luck can't get better after I witnessed that event?
:::'''Yamada:''' No, no way! I can't give up now! No matter how many times it takes, I will get a good slip before I leave!
:;(After completing Transient Dreams)
:::'''Yamada:''' I'm here to get a fortune slip to see what the future holds for my business...
:::'''Yamada:''' Originally, I thought that I'd now be able to leave the country and make a big profit doing business, but all the slips I've drawn have "Misfortune" on them...
:::'''Yamada:''' Business has not been smooth at all, and even the Grand Narukami Shrine can't save me... Is it because my luck can't get better after I witnessed that event?
:::'''Yamada:''' No, no way! I can't give up now! No matter how many times it takes, I will obtain a positive sign before I leave!
::{{DIcon}} What event are you referring to?
::'''Yamada:''' It's something that happened after the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] came out. [[Kazuha's Friend|Someone]] bit off more than he could chew by challenging the Vision Hunt Decree enforcers from the [[Tenryou Commission]] to a duel before the throne.
::'''Yamada:''' Naturally, this imprudent guy was promptly defeated and received divine punishment from the Almighty Shogun... *sigh* What an awful way to go, now that I think about it...
::'''Yamada:''' But to everyone's surprise, the Vision that the defeated man had lost was taken away by [[Kaedehara Kazuha|another young lad]] who barged onto the scene!
::'''Yamada:''' That Vision, which should have become part of the [[Statue of the Omnipresent God|statue]] of the Almighty Shogun, is now in the hands of some unknown ronin... Alas, what a terrible omen!
:{{DIcon}} I won't disturb you then.
::'''Yamada:''' Please, oh please, let the next slip be good...
