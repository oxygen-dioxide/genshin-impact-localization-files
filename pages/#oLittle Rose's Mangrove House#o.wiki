|description    = A treehouse-style cat tree. When paired with the natural color of the wood, the valberry red adds an additional layer of beauty to the aesthetic. The cat tree's two planks are said to be soft to the touch and even more comfortable than a sofa. Of course, these are just [[Shuyun]]'s claims as none of the clientele have experienced the cat tree firsthand.<br>Rumor has it that this style of cat tree was first purchased for [[Little Rose]]. Being of relative experiential seniority and the most graceful amongst the duel cats, Little Rose is well-respected amongst its peers and none would dare take its topmost spot of ultimate comfort...
