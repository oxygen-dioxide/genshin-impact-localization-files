{{Description|An ancient, strangely-shaped canteen. The interior is fitted with harp strings, which plays a wondrous tune as the water flows out.}}
'''Wanderer's String-Kettle''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Wanderer's Troupe]].

==Description==
A strangely-shaped kettle that plays a wondrous tune as the water flows out.<br />There was always music in the life of a Troupe member, even when drinking water.

An ancient tale tells of a wandering troupe that roamed the land.<br />For flutes they had swords, and for harps they had bows.<br />They performed not only for friends, but also for foes.<br />They traveled through the desert and set foot in the blazing [[Mare Jivari]].

The tune of the harp echoing in the kettle was a reminder for them.<br />"Along with the boundless tunes we walk."<br />"Wherever there is music, there is us."
