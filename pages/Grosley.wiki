{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Grosley:''' Welcome to Fontaine! Please, do watch your step.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Court of Fontaine.
::'''Grosley:''' You may ride the lift at the side to the Court, and there you shall see the [[Palais Mermonia]], the beating heart of Fontaine.
::'''Grosley:''' If you've ridden one of our [[aquabus]]es, I'm sure you've heard a [[Melusine]] tour guide introduce Fontaine, yes?
::'''Grosley:''' Well, now you'll get to experience it for yourself.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Melusine tour guides...
:::'''Grosley:''' As far as I know, Melusines are our special companions.
:::'''Grosley:''' But don't underestimate them on account of their appearance. The ones amongst them in uniform are detectives from the [[Marechaussee Phantom]].
:::'''Grosley:''' ...That includes the guides.
:::'''Grosley:''' Just like us humans, different Melusines have their unique personalities.
:::'''Grosley:''' The sort of introduction you'll get will thus depend on the Melusine serving as your guide.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about the lift...
:::'''Grosley:''' It stops at 4 different levels. Level 1 is the main aquabus station hall, and the highest one leads straight to the Palais Mermonia.
:::'''Grosley:''' We are presently at Level 2. Before us is the Clementine Line, which links [[Romaritime Harbor]] with the main station. The third level, for its part, is the Navia Line, which leads to [[Erinnyes]].
:::'''Grosley:''' A lot of travelers get the floors mixed up, so be careful now.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the aquabus lines...
::'''Grosley:''' There are three aquabus lines here in Fontaine &mdash; the Callas Line, the Clementine Line, and the Navia Line.
::'''Grosley:''' These three names were not chosen at random, far from it. They refer to [[Callas]], the President of the [[Spina di Rosula]], [[Clementine|his wife]], and [[Navia|his daughter]] respectively.
::'''Grosley:''' The aquabus had a truly troubled gestation &mdash; if not for the Spina, we'd still be navigating on foot.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Grosley:''' See you! May you have a wonderful day.
