==Lore==
A long, long time ago, the youkai lived alongside humans and used their powers to help them through "an era of strife and poverty." Together, they founded a city on Narukami Island, which would later become the nation of Inazuma.<ref name="Yae4">{{Ref/CS|Yae Miko|4}}</ref> 

During the [[Cataclysm]], both humans and youkai fought against the Abyssal invasion. Many youkai lost their lives or disappeared, including [[Mikoshi Chiyo]], the [[Kitsune Saiguu]], and [[Reizenbou]], all prominent members of revered clans. By the present day, the number of youkai has dwindled substantially, and their bloodlines continue to thin.

==Trivia==
* In Japanese mythology and folklore, {{w|Yōkai|youkai}} play an almost identical role to that of the youkai in Teyvat.
