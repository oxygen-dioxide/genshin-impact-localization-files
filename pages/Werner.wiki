==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Originally hailing from [[Mondstadt]], Werner went into the shipping business for trade between [[Liyue]] and Inazuma.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Confessions of an Outlander}}</ref> After the [[Sakoku Decree]] was declared, Werner was stuck on [[Ritou]]. He originally joined the [[International Trade Association]], but soon left as he felt that he was unable to contribute.

Soon after he left, he conspired with [[Keijirou]] to sell [[Crystal Marrow]] to the association at an inflated price. Despite playing the role of seller, Werner was barely given any compensation for his activities. [[Kurisu]] sent the Traveler to investigate on his behalf, but only after advice from [[Thoma]] did the Traveler learn of his origins. Giving him items from both Mondstadt and Liyue, Werner soon admitted he was wrong and exposed Keijirou's misdeeds to them. While not known, it is suggested that he later reconciled with the International Trade Association as he felt ashamed of conning them at the time.
