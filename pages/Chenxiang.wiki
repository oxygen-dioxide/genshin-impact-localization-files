==Profile==
<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->
Because Hongdou is afflicted with a chronic, incurable illness, she has to take [[Baizhu]]'s herbal medicines, but she can't stand its bitter taste. Chenxiang spends most of her time trying to convince her to take her medicine, and sometimes resorts to asking the player to bring her [[Almond Tofu]] as a bribe.

:'''Chenxiang:''' Doudou, be a good girl, let's go pick your medicine. You'll only get better if you take your medicine.
:'''Hongdou:''' I'm not going, I'm not going! I hate the medicine at Bubu Pharmacy. I hate it!
:'''Chenxiang:''' You need to do as you're told, Doudou... And hey, if we go to Bubu Pharmacy, you'll get to see Baizhu. How about that?
:'''Hongdou:''' Wow, really? ...Mr. Baizhu is so nice, I'm sure just seeing him will make me better. Then I won't need any medicine!
:'''Chenxiang:''' Hmm, but if poor Mr. Baizhu found out you didn't like his medicine... You wouldn't want to make him mad, would you?
:'''Hongdou:''' Erm... erm... What about if we just pick the medicine, but I don't take it?
