Their long ears are an adaptation that helps them better live in their hot and dry desert home.<br />Logically speaking, you would think that these creatures would be much more active in the cooler Realm Within, but neither the slightly muddled [[Tubby]] nor the itinerant [[Chubby]] have seen them all that much, and in lieu of hard evidence have had to guess that they likely have a decent relationship with the [[Masked Weasel]]s, for they can be seen (when the Desert Foxes can be seen at all) playing together.
