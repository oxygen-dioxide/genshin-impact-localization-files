|description = A sly animal as elusive as a fairy that often appears in folk stories, symbolizing unusual cunning and ancient memories.<br>These animals call the vast desert home and are smaller than most of their kin, which is possibly how they evaded the ancient calamities. Their long ears are an adaptation that helps them better live in their hot and dry desert home.
