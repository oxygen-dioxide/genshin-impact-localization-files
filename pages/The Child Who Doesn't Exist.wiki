{{Quest Description|It's a fine day. Yes, a fine day for a stroll around Poisson!}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Upon obtaining quest)
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's been a while since we visited Poisson. Maybe we should head over and have a look around?

;(Approach Poisson)
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hey, {{Traveler}}! Paimon!
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon knows that voice...
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Over here!
:{{DIcon}} Lyney!
:{{DIcon}} It's been too long.
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' To borrow one of the more popular turns of phrase at the moment, this appears to be quite the "fated reunion." Running into you two out of the blue like this has really made my day. I certainly wasn't expecting it.
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You can say that again! What brings you to Poisson?
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait! Paimon's got it! You must be here for one of your magic shows, right?
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Um... Actually, we've run into a bit of trouble on the home front, so "Father" arranged for us to stay in Poisson for the time being.
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, are Lynette and Freminet here too?
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Yep, along with most of the other members of the [[House of the Hearth]]. You may have noticed Poisson seems a bit more... crowded than usual.
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you're saying nearly the entire organization has moved to Poisson? Sounds like you've run into way more than just "a bit of trouble." What's really going on?
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Umm... Well...
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 arlecchino 01.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Since the two of you are so curious, perhaps I can fill in the gaps.
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ack! You scared Paimon half to death!
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' "Father," you're here.
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... Y'know? On second thought, maybe we don't need to know. It's all probably super confidential House of the Hearth stuff, right? We totally weren't trying to pry or anything...
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 arlecchino 02.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' No need to be nervous. I could sense your genuine concern from your conversation just now.
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 arlecchino 03.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Of course, I can also understand your confusion. Sending so many Fatui here to Poisson, it's only natural that some might suspect an "ulterior motive" to be involved.
:{{DIcon}} Well, we are a little curious...
:{{DIcon}} We still have our reservations about your organization.
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 arlecchino 04.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' I understand. I'm well aware you've had your fair share of confrontations with the Fatui in the past. And I can't exactly guarantee that we'll remain on good terms in the future.
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 arlecchino 05.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' As for right now, however, I would say we have little reason to be at odds, wouldn't you agree? The House of the Hearth could stand to be more open with those who have worked so closely with us in the past.
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 arlecchino 06.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' As for the issue at hand... Well, it hardly relates to any ulterior motive. To be frank, it all stems from a certain rumor circulating around the House of the Hearth. It's an internal matter.
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What sort of rumor?
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 arlecchino 07.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' A rumor that a certain "phantom child" is hiding away in the House of the Hearth.
:{{DIcon}} Some sort of ghost story, maybe?
:{{DIcon}} I feel like I'm getting chills already.
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A phantom child? Just hearing the name is giving Paimon the creeps...
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 arlecchino 08.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' A spirit that should have long ceased to exist is lurking in the shadows of the House of the Hearth.
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 arlecchino 09.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' So, I decided to bring the children to Poisson before continuing to investigate the situation. I expect I should be able to track down the spirit fairly quickly. After that, it's just a matter of "resolving" the situation, if you will. It shouldn't be much trouble at all.
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 arlecchino 10.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' If you're curious, or if you still have some concerns, it might be advisable to stick around for a few days. I'm sure the children would be exceedingly pleased to welcome some visitors.
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 arlecchino 11.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Lyney, I'll leave you to entertain our guests. I have some matters to attend to.
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Of course, "Father."
:{{Color|menu|The Knave turns and leaves...}}
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (I couldn't help but feel intimidated during that conversation with The Knave. Now that she's gone, it feels like I can finally breathe again...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (She also suggested that we stick around for a few days... But why?)
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hmm, it has long been a dream of mine to invite you to our home, and introduce you to my other siblings.
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You're quite well-known in the organization already. A lot of people have been talking about you, especially after everything with the prophecy.
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' If you're willing, why don't you stay awhile and have a little chat with us?
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, alright! We don't have anything else to do right now anyway. But let's be clear, we're just gonna be there as guests, okay? Don't get any funny... Wait a second! If we're your "guests," that probably means we'll be treated to lots of yummy food, right?
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 lyney 12.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Of course! During our stay in Poisson, we've been helping out the locals with some fishing. We bring in quite the bounty every day. In fact, today is the perfect chance for me to show you what I can do in the kitchen.
:{{A|vo arlq001 1 lyney 13.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Let's go. I'll take you to where we're staying.
{{Quest Description|update|The Knave invited you to visit the House of the Hearth. Have a chat with the children.}}
;(Approach the marker)
:{{A|vo arlq001 2 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' We rented this house from one of the locals to use as a temporary base. I'll come back later and tidy up a bit. After that, it should be all ready for you to stay in tonight.
:{{A|vo arlq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Awesome, thanks! So where are we off to now?
:{{A|vo arlq001 2 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well, when I happened to run into you two earlier, I was actually in the middle of distributing some supplies.
:{{A|vo arlq001 2 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' With this many people staying in Poisson, we have to bring in outside supplies every now and then. I should probably make sure the rest of these provisions get delivered, otherwise people might start to get antsy.
:{{A|vo arlq001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay! We'll come with!
:{{A|vo arlq001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There are all sorts of rumors about your organization floating around out there. Paimon's not sure she could even take a wild guess as to what's true and what's not.
:{{A|vo arlq001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, now that we finally have the chance to see a day in the life of the House, we can take a good look at how you operate.
:{{A|vo arlq001 2 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well, you're more than welcome to come along. Just follow me.
----
;(Approach Chapleau)
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 chapleau 01.ogg}} '''Chapleau:''' Lyney! You're finally here! The supplies... I'm assuming you've&mdash;
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Brought them with me? Yep, here you go.
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Uh... hello? Something caught your eye?
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 chapleau 02.ogg}} '''Chapleau:''' It's {{Traveler}} and Paimon!
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 foltz 01.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' No way!
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 heloir 01.ogg}} '''Heloir:''' C'mere everyone! Hurry! {{Traveler}} and Paimon are here!
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' One at a time please. Don't crowd around them all at once. We don't want to scare off our guests, now do we?
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's alright. Gotta say, Paimon didn't realize we were THIS famous...
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 foltz 02.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' Of course! "Father" and Lyney have told us so much about you!
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 chapleau 03.ogg}} '''Chapleau:''' "Father" told us about how you helped Lyney. According to her, you're a trustworthy friend, and as far as she's concerned, that's pretty much the highest compliment we've ever heard her give. As you can imagine, everyone's been very curious about you.
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 foltz 03a.ogg}} {{A|vo arlq001 3 foltz 03b.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' I heard {{Traveler}} is so strong that {{MC|m=he|f=she}} can move a mountain with {{MC|m=his|f=her}} bare hands!
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 heloir 02.ogg}} '''Heloir:''' I heard Paimon eats so much that she can clean out the entire pantry at [[Hotel Debord]] in just three days!
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait a second, that's the rumor you've heard about Paimon!? Not cool at all!
:{{DIcon}} Mine's also a bit of a stretch...
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 foltz 04.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' Oh, wait! When guests visit, you're supposed to give them gifts and stuff, right?
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, we don't need something like that. Besides, we don't have anything to give to you...
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 heloir 03.ogg}} '''Heloir:''' C'mon, we insist! I can give you some of my new potions? Just pick your poison &mdash; and by that I mean medicine or actual poison. I've got both.
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 foltz 05.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' Ooor, maybe Chapleau can teach you guys about stealth! He's super good at it! He's never been caught!
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 chapleau 04.ogg}} '''Chapleau:''' Ah, now that's not a bad idea! I know you usually prefer to fight head-on, but it never hurts to expand your bag of tricks, right? When it comes to eliminating your enemies, staying quiet can go a long way. Trust me &mdash; I would know.
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 chapleau 05.ogg}} '''Chapleau:''' I was poisoned not too long ago, and I'm still dealing with the aftereffects, so I'm not quite as good as I was before... but I can still give you some pointers.
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, wait, uh... When you said gifts, Paimon didn't think you meant poison and stealth tactics!
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 foltz 06.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' But those are the best things we can give you! You don't like them?
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 foltz 07.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' Ooh! How about this? Tell me the name of someone who really annoys you, and we'll teach 'em a lesson for you!
:{{Black Screen|The dangerous suggestions keep on coming one after another. You start to get a bit overwhelmed...}}
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Alright, Foltz, Heloir &mdash; I think that's enough suggestions for now. When it comes to being a good host, it's the thought that counts.
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You don't need a physical gift to make our guests happy. In fact, pestering them with suggestion after suggestion might make them more annoyed than anything. I would say your enthusiasm has certainly gotten across.
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 heloir 04.ogg}} '''Heloir:''' Really?
:{{DIcon}} Absolutely.
:{{DIcon}} We definitely feel the love.
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 foltz 08.ogg}} '''Foltz:''' Awesome! It's been so long since we've had guests to play with! If there's anything you need, just let us know!
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 heloir 05.ogg}} '''Heloir:''' Yeah! Especially if it's poison or something. I've got all sorts of potions for that.
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' *ahem* Well, we'll talk to you all later. We've still got supplies to distribute.
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 chapleau 06.ogg}} '''Chapleau:''' Alright. See you later.
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 together 01.ogg}} '''Crowd:''' Bye!
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... Lyney, about all that poison and stealth tactics talk just now...
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Scared you, did it? That kind of talk comes with being part of the House of the Hearth.
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' When Foltz was really young, he strangled all of his family pets &mdash; just out of curiosity. He was labeled a dangerous "problem child" and was abandoned by his family.
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Heloir has an unnatural obsession with potions. "Father" has forbidden her from trying all the different concoctions she comes up with, but she still tries to test them in secret. You really have to keep an eye on that one.
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Chapleau is around my age. While I'm mainly responsible for collecting intelligence, he handles surveillance. He's very passionate about his work and has no reservations about taking on some very difficult missions.
:{{A|vo arlq001 3 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I know you two probably aren't used to that kind of talk, but I can promise you they only had the best of intentions. Things like stealth tactics and developing different poisons... they really mean a lot to them. They were just trying to share the best of what they could offer &mdash; that's all.

;(Talk to Chapleau, Foltz, or Heloir again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog arlq001 chapleau 01.ogg}} '''Chapleau:''' Wow, {{Traveler}} and Paimon... I finally got to meet them in person!
:{{A|vo dialog arlq001 heloir 01.ogg}} '''Heloir:''' Hmm, they don't really seem as intimidating as you hear in the stories.
:{{A|vo dialog arlq001 foltz 01a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo dialog arlq001 foltz 01bb.ogg}}--> '''Foltz:''' They'd probably get along really well with Filliol... If only they got here sooner.

;(Approach Filliol)
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Filliol, supplies are here.
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 filliol 01a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo arlq001 4 filliol 01b.ogg}}--> '''Filliol:''' Thanks. And who are these two? Outsiders?
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 lyney 02a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo arlq001 4 lyney 02b.ogg}}--> '''Lyney:''' Ah, allow me to introduce you. This is {{Traveler}} and Paimon.
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 nanteuil 01.ogg}} '''Nanteuil:''' Oh, you're the famous duo I've been hearing so much about.
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 nanteuil 02.ogg}} '''Nanteuil:''' It's nice to meet you. I heard you've traveled to all sorts of places. Is that true?
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Of course! We're making our way all across Teyvat!
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 filliol 02.ogg}} '''Filliol:''' Oh, good for you.
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 nanteuil 03.ogg}} '''Nanteuil:''' You must be pretty familiar with Fontaine by now, then. Have you seen the new opera that started running recently? I think it's called... "The Four Thousand Thieves"?
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This is the first we've heard of it!
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 nanteuil 04.ogg}} '''Nanteuil:''' It seems like it's going to be fantastic &mdash; from what I've been able to tell from the posters, anyway. You should definitely check it out if you have the time.
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 filliol 03.ogg}} '''Filliol:''' Oh, and there's "The Blind Maiden" too. That one is supposed to have audience interaction. Seems pretty interesting.
:{{Black Screen|As you spend some time talking about popular culture, the atmosphere becomes more and more relaxed...}}
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 filliol 04.ogg}} '''Filliol:''' After this mission is over, I think I'll go get a manicure.
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 nanteuil 05.ogg}} '''Nanteuil:''' Maybe I should dye my hair. Hmm, wonder how much it'll cost...
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is it just Paimon, or do these two seem much easier to get along with than the others... Looks like the House of the Hearth has some "normal" members, after all.
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 filliol 05.ogg}} '''Filliol:''' I heard that.
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Uh... Oops, hehe...
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 nanteuil 06.ogg}} '''Nanteuil:''' I'm guessing you're referring to Foltz and the others? Yeah, we're definitely not all like them.
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 filliol 06.ogg}} '''Filliol:''' I bet those crazies are practically foaming at the mouth right now. Heh, I'm sure they just can't wait to get back to [[Snezhnaya]] to carry out the plan...
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That's enough, Filliol.
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 filliol 07.ogg}} '''Filliol:''' Ah, "don't talk about family members behind their back," right? Heh, whatever. Let's go.
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 nanteuil 07.ogg}} '''Nanteuil:''' Um, guess this is goodbye then! If you ever have some time, we should go see the opera together!
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' *sigh*...
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well, that's it for the supplies. We should probably head back as well.
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, they didn't seem too happy with each other. Seems like there could be something more going on here...
:{{DIcon}} We should observe for now.
:{{DIcon}} It's better not to pry.
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're right. We're only here as "guests," after all.
:{{A|vo arlq001 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Lyney's getting super far ahead! C'mon, let's catch up!

;(Talk to Filliol or Nanteuil again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog arlq001 filliol 01.ogg}} '''Filliol:''' Looks like there's more trouble in store next month too... *sigh* When will it end...
:{{A|vo dialog arlq001 nanteuil 01.ogg}} '''Nanteuil:''' Hey, just focus on the positives. At least our time in Poisson has been pretty relaxing. Don't you think?

;(Return to the temporary accommodations)
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' So... What do you think of the members you've met so far?
:{{DIcon}} They've certainly got a lot of personality.
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Haha, well, "Father" is always encouraging us to be strong-willed and independent. So, if there's one thing we've got, it's people who aren't afraid to speak their mind.
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well, I should probably get cooking. Wanna join?
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Of course!
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Then let's head out... Huh? Freminet? What are you doing here?
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Ah, well, um...
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Freminet! Nice to see you again!
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' You too. I heard you're here as guests of the House of the Hearth. Welcome.
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' We were just going to make some food. Why don't you come along? I could use some help in the kitchen, and I seem to remember you mentioning you wanted to make [[Poisson Seafood Soup|Seafood Soup]] for {{Traveler}} and Paimon.
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seafood Soup! Paimon's drooling already!
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Were you looking for something just now, Freminet? Maybe I can help.
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Ah, it's nothing. I just wanted to see if there were any extra supplies.
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Yeah, we've got some left over. What do you need?
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 freminet 04.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Some food and water. And some clean cloth, if possible.
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' No problem. Give me a second here. Food, water...
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Wait a minute... What do you need all of those for? You're not on any missions, as far as I'm aware, and you were just going to come eat with us... So what's this all about?
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 freminet 05.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I&mdash;I thought I'd grab an extra portion because I get hungry at night. Could be because I'm growing, y'know, and...
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Freminet.
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You remember what I told you? You're not like me &mdash; your lying skills still need some work.
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 lyney 12.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Tell me what's going on. Is it really bad enough that you have to keep it from your own brother?
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... Maybe it'll be better if we gave them some space...
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 freminet 06.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' ...
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 lyney 13.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Huh, this is the first time I've seen that kind of look on your face. Whatever happened... Does it have something to do with "Father"?
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 freminet 07.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Yes.
:{{A|vo arlq001 5 freminet 08.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Just... follow me.
----
{{Quest Description|update|Freminet seems to be concealing something very important. Lyney wants to know the truth...}}
;(Approach Clervie)
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 creirve 01.ogg}} '''???:''' You're back! Oh, and you've brought some friends with you this time!
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hello, my name's Lyney. I grew up in the House of the Hearth. And you are...
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 creirve 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Hi, Lyney. I'm also a child of the House of the Hearth &mdash; just like you!
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 creirve 03.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' You can call me Clervie.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Clervie?
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 creirve 04.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' It's nice to meet you.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Does that name ring any bells, Lyney?
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' No, not at all. That's not a name we have on our roster &mdash; I'm sure of it. What I'm not sure of, though... is how she managed to sneak in.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' She must be the "phantom child" "Father" has been searching for. From the looks of it, I'm guessing you were the one that found her, Freminet? You, uh... haven't told "Father," have you?
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' No, I haven't told anyone. I've just been... keeping her hidden.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' For how long?
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' About half a month now.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' So, ever since we got to Poisson, then? Do you have any idea what you're doing!?
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I know what I'm doing.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Really? 'Cause from where I'm standing, it looks like you're hiding the very person "Father" has been trying to find! If "Father" finds out about this, everyone involved is going to be punished.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You know the rules of the House, Freminet. I know you do &mdash; "Father" doesn't tolerate any form of betrayal. So, why are you doing this?
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 freminet 04.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I've thought it through... And I just can't hand her over like that.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 freminet 05.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Lyney, don't you remember last year? Chapleau nearly died after getting poisoned during that one mission. He wasn't able to get back before the poison started taking effect, and not a single person was there to help him.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 freminet 06.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' That night, while I was sleeping, I heard a voice telling me to go save him. I opened my eyes, but I couldn't find the source of the voice. I thought maybe I was just hearing things, but I went to look for him anyway. Luckily, I got there with enough time to save his life.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 freminet 07.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' That feeling of being "haunted," of hearing voices... It's happened many times in the House of the Hearth. I'm sure you've noticed.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' So what you're saying is... That was her? She was the one who spoke to you that night?
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 freminet 08.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Unless there are other spirits roaming around the House of the Hearth, I don't think there's any other possibility.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 freminet 09.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' If Clervie were our enemy, it wouldn't matter whether she was a spirit or an actual child &mdash; I would have acted without a second thought, because that's what "Father" ordered us to do.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 freminet 10.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' But, she's been living with us, helping us from the shadows all this time. I think that makes her family.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 freminet 11.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I couldn't just hand her over to be dealt with &mdash; not when there's so much we still don't know.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' So what's your plan then? You can't keep her here forever. Someone is bound to find out eventually.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 freminet 12.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I haven't thought that far yet. I don't want to disobey an order from "Father," but I also don't want to put Clervie in danger.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Come with me. There are a couple things I'd like to say to you in private.
:{{Color|menu|Lyney leads Freminet somewhere further away to speak.}}
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 creirve 05.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Those two sure care a lot about each other.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, they got a funny way of showing it. From where Paimon was floating, it sure seemed like they were about to bite each other's heads off...
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 creirve 06.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' No way! They have a really deep bond. I could tell right away, 'cause I also have a friend like that.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 creirve 07.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' I just... don't know how long that kind of bond can last.
:{{DIcon}} What do you mean?
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 creirve 08.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' The darkness in the House runs deeper than you can imagine. No one can get out alive.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 freminet 13.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I'm sorry, Lyney. I really didn't mean to drag anyone else into this...
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 lyney 12.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Oh, really? You didn't mean to? 'Cause I, for one, wish you did.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 freminet 14.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Huh? What do you mean?
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 lyney 13.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Y'know, when we were younger, you didn't call me "Lyney." You called me "Brother," just like Lynette.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 lyney 14.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' We grew up together, the three of us. We were all orphans, all rescued by "Father." Of all the siblings in the House of the Hearth, I think our bond was the closest.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 lyney 15.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Later on, when you started calling me "Lyney," I wasn't actually surprised. After all, Lynette and I are related by blood. We've had to depend on each other to survive long before we joined the House.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 freminet 15.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Lyney, I...
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 lyney 16.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' The darkest and most difficult moments of my life happened before you and I had ever met &mdash; I'm sure that's true for you as well. Even so, Freminet, we've stood by each other for all these years now, and, to me, that means more than blood.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 lyney 17.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You and Lynette are the most important people in my life. No one can replace you. So, I won't let you face anything alone &mdash; not if I can help it.
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no, looks like things are getting kinda heated between Lyney and Freminet... Maybe we should go check on them.

;(Clervie's idle quotes)
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 creirve 09.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Oh, it's raining. I should put my clothes away...
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 creirve 10.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' [[Perrie]]? Huh... Looks like she's not here either...
:{{A|vo arlq001 6 creirve 11.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Ah, it's time to eat.

;(Talk to Freminet and Lyney)
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, you two... Hope we aren't interrupting anything, like a fight or...
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait a minute! Freminet! Y&mdash;You're not... crying, are you? Is everything alright?
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Everything's fine... Thanks for asking.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, we're all friends here, right? We've been through so much together, so if there's anything we can do to help, just say the word!
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' It's just a small family dispute. It's not something our guests should trouble themselves with. In fact, it might be better if your stay ended here.
:{{DIcon}} But sometimes, having guests around can come in handy.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... What are you getting at, {{Traveler}}?
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' When guests are around, families are often on their best behavior... and any disputes are less likely to escalate... That's what you're trying to say, isn't it?
:{{DIcon}} Exactly.
:{{DIcon}} I think it'll be better if we stick around.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I... just... Thank you. I was really hoping to keep you out of it, but even if I could think of some other reason to turn you away, I'm not sure I could convince you. I know things could turn dangerous, so I promise you this &mdash; from now on, I'll protect you like my life depends on it.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Me too.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well, back to the matter at hand, then. If we don't plan on handing Clervie over to "Father," then our only other option is to solve the mystery of her identity before "Father" is able to track her down.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That means finding out where she came from and what she's doing here. Then, we can send her on her merry way and pretend like none of this ever happened.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I've tried that already.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' And?
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 freminet 04.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' And... nothing. I tried taking her somewhere really far away, but... after some time, she just reappeared.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 freminet 05.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' She even came with us all the way to Poisson. It seems like wherever the House is, she follows.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hmm, I don't know much about spirits... Do you two have any ideas?
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's see here... Ooh! Paimon remembers hearing something like... If you fulfill a spirit's last wish before they died, they'll let go of whatever's keeping them here and return to the Ley Lines.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's just that... Paimon doesn't really remember where she heard that... so it's not guaranteed to work or anything.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well, sounds like it's worth a shot. Guess that means we should go ask her about her wish. But first... Freminet, I need you to promise me something.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 freminet 06.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' What is it?
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I need you to promise me that this will stay between the two of us. We're the masterminds behind this whole thing &mdash; no one else gets involved. Can you do that for me?
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 freminet 07.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Of course. I promise.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Alright, then let's seal the promise just like when we were kids... Fist bump on three. Ready? One, two, three...
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 together 01.ogg}} '''Lyney & Freminet & Lynette:''' I swear.

:{{Color|menu|Everyone is shocked to see Lynette, who appeared all too suddenly.}}
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 freminet 08.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Ah!!
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Whoa!!
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' L&mdash;Lynette!
:{{DIcon}} You scared me!
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lyney 12.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Wh&mdash;What a surprise! *ahem* What brings you here, dear sister?
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lyney 13.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' And, uh... When exactly did you get here?
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' You're an idiot, Brother.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lyney 14.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Um...
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' And you too, Freminet.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 freminet 09.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Uh...
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' You three, {{Traveler}}. And you four, Paimon.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, what did we do?
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I've seen Clervie around the House of the Hearth before. I hadn't seen her in Poisson, so I figured she must not have come with us... But it turns out you were just hiding her.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lynette 05.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I heard you talking about your plan. Rather than steering clear of the situation, I'd rather fully join in.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lynette 06.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' If you don't agree, I'll have no choice but to report everything back to "Father." Simple as that.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lyney 15.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' *sigh* You're not giving us much wiggle room here, Lynette.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lyney 16.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well, I guess we're all in this together, then. After we talk to Clervie, we'll figure out our next move.
:{{A|vo arlq001 7 lyney 17.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' There's no time to lose. Let's go.
{{Quest Description|update|You didn't expect Freminet to be harboring the child that The Knave has been investigating. What do you do now?}}
;(Talk to Clervie)
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 creirve 01.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Ah, I'm full! Thank you for bringing me this food, you guys.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She said she's "full," but the food doesn't look like it's even been touched...
:{{DIcon}} Well, she's a spirit...
:{{DIcon}} She can't actually eat.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' That's right. Based on what I've been able to observe, it doesn't seem like Clervie can interact with the physical world at all.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Still, when she's presented with food, she'll always linger around it for a good little while. Maybe, in her mind, she really is eating those things.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Does she know that she has already passed away?
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I've tried to ask her, but she didn't answer. My guess is that she's just as confused as we are, or... Maybe she couldn't understand the question at all.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Clervie, if you've got some time, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 creirve 02.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Sure.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 creirve 03.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Oh! Another new friend! Hi, I'm Clervie.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Hello.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Clervie, how did you join the House of the Hearth?
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 creirve 04.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Huh? Isn't it the same for everybody?
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 creirve 05.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' The Knave brings you here, and then you can't leave.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' It's just that... your name, it's not on the roster. And I've never seen you before.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 creirve 06.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' The roster? Ah, I get it now. I think there might be some things you don't know about this place.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 creirve 07.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' The people in charge... They're not as nice as they look. They say they keep a roster... but it's not complete. There are a lot of people who aren't on it... and never will be.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 creirve 08.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' In this House, some people are "family" and other people... are just "test subjects." Those kinds of people aren't ever going to get a place on the roster... unless it's the roster of people who've been executed.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, does that mean The Knave, she...
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Is there anyone that can vouch for you?
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 creirve 09.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' ...
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 creirve 10.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Perrie. She's my best friend. She's the only one I trust in this place.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Have either of you heard of that name before?
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' No.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 freminet 04.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Me neither...
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Clervie... Perrie... Neither of those names are on the roster.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But... it seems like she's telling the truth. Either that, or this kid's already got a bag of tricks bigger than mine.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hmm, maybe we should try a different approach. Clervie, do you have a wish?
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 creirve 11.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' A wish?
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' It can be anything you want. Just imagine &mdash; it's your birthday, you're blowing out the candles, and your wish is...
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 creirve 12.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' To... To go outside.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 creirve 13.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Where the sun can find me.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's it? Well, that sounds easy enough.
:{{Color|menu|You recall what Clervie said...}}
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 creirve 14.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' The darkness in the House runs deeper than you can imagine. No one can get out alive.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (What did she mean by that...? Things can't be this simple.)
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Okay, time to divide and conquer. Listen up. I've got a plan.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I'll try and find a way to use basic illusory magic to take Clervie outside and bring her somewhere with sunlight.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lyney 12.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Lynette, try and find the list of executions that Clervie was talking about, and see if her name is on it.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lyney 13.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Freminet, you stay in Poisson. We can't be the only ones who've had run ins with Clervie. I need you to collect intel on everything she's said and done.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Understood.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 freminet 05.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I'll try my best.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What about us? What should we do?
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lyney 14.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I really appreciate your willingness to help, but this is a family matter. I don't want to drag you in too deep. It's too risky.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lyney 15.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Let me think... Since "Father" considers you to be guests, maybe you could stick by her side for a little while? You don't need to do anything except keep up some nice, casual conversation.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, Paimon gets it! You want us to distract her!
:{{DIcon}} How should we contact you?
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lyney 16.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I'll give you a magic bird. If "Father" suspects something, all you need to do is release it when she's not looking, and it'll alert me that something's wrong.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lyney 17.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Of course, that's only as a last resort. If "Father" doesn't seem to notice us, there's no need to make contact. We'll reconvene here tonight after all's said and done.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lyney 18.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' If the worst-case scenario happens, and we're discovered, just tell "Father" everything. We're not going to let our guests get punished for our own actions &mdash; that's where we draw the line.
:{{DIcon}} Be careful.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lyney 19.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You too... Okay, this is where we part. "Father" should be at the beach nearby.
:{{A|vo arlq001 8 lyney 20.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I really hope this goes well. No... It has to go well. That's the only way this can get resolved.

;(Talk to Lyney and Clervie, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog arlq001 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Clervie, I'd like to take you somewhere. Is that okay with you?
