{{Transclude|Sacrificial Series|Notes}}

==Description==
In the early days, the people of [[Mondstadt]] had a tradition of building theaters on top of windy cliffs to please the gods.<br />
Rituals took the form of performances, for they believed the gods enjoyed stories and ballads.<br />
This script is millennia old, and is no longer legible.

Long ago, a war waged between the [[Decarabian|Lord of Storm]] and the [[Andrius|Great Wolf King of the North]]. Mondstadt was engulfed in blizzards, and the snow stung like sand.<br />
A group who could bear the cold no longer built a shrine high on a clifftop in the east. There, they prayed for divine mercy and protection.

The wind blows for a moment, but the ravages of time are constant, unrelenting, and irreversible.<br />
A god of the winds may move between the pages of a book, but in the end, the merciless god of time will eat away at them until not a single legible word remains.

Yet, time's assault and that of the wind often take their toll the same upon the heart.<br />
Perhaps that is why later generations presumed the shrine to have always been to the wind, and the wind alone.
