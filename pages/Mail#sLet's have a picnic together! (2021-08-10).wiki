|text    = Hey, do you have time today? I'll just come out and say it: I'd like to invite you to a picnic!

I'll cover the snacks, drinks, and fruits, but could you please bring dessert? I'm sure what you'll make will be great!

It doesn't have to be too complicated. As long as I get the chance to chat with you on my birthday, I'll be happy.

I haven't missed a single day of training as an Outrider! Hehe, I saw some interesting things that I can't wait to share with you when we meet. You've got to tell me what you've been up to these days, too. We can exchange adventure stories!

Oh! By the way, these [[Dandelion Seed|dandelion seeds]] are for you. I picked them during one of my scouting missions. Aren't they pretty?
