{{Lang|'''Urakusai'''|ja=有楽斎}} was a [[kitsune]] in [[Inazuma]] known for his literary works, including the original ''[[New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune|Chronicles of the Six Kitsune]]''.

He was an associate of the [[Kitsune Saiguu]]'s up until five hundred years ago;<ref name="NCotSK2">{{Ref/Book|New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune|2}}</ref> while it is unknown what exactly he did, his actions apparently may have contributed to [[the Abyss]]' invasion of [[Teyvat]] during the [[cataclysm]].<ref name="NCotSK6">{{Ref/Book|New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune|6}}</ref>

==Profile==
During the Kitsune Saiguu's time, she took an interest in Urakusai's literary abilities and tastes in tea; as a result, Urakusai became famed as "one of the most cultured and sophisticated of all the kitsune" by the time the author of ''New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune'' was born.

==Story==
It is unknown how long Urakusai has lived, but he recounted tales from the era of [[Hakushin]], the matriarch of the [[Hakushin Clan]], and her apprentices.

Five hundred years ago, before the start of the cataclysm, Urakusai made a "mistake" that greatly incited the Kitsune Saiguu's wrath. She banished him to parts unknown, then left the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]] to reside in [[Tenshukaku]], predicting the impending catastrophe and deciding that she had to stay close to [[Ei]] to better protect Inazuma.<ref name="NCotSK6" />

Urakusai's fate after his banishment is unknown, although the author of ''New Chronicles'' believes that whatever he did five hundred years was connected to the Abyss.<ref name="NCotSK6" />

Eventually, Urakusai died, and his memories were absorbed into the Ley Lines in the [[Sacred Sakura]]'s roots. His spirit remained dormant until recently, when he heard a down-on-his-luck light novelist named Tomoyuki yell "Please, someone, anyone! Help me write a truly amazing novel!" Urakusai's curiosity was piqued, and he possessed Tomoyuki and wrote the light novel ''[[A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits]]''. He included a real summoning incantation in the novel, so that anyone who tried out the incantation would be possessed by Urakusai's fellow youkai spirits, who would be able to walk the mortal realm for a couple of days. The possession incidents caught the attention of the [[Traveler]], [[Paimon]], and [[Yae Miko]], who arranged a ritual to summon Urakusai by having him possess the Traveler's body. After catching up with Miko, Urakusai returned to whence he came.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Great Narukami Offering}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* Urakusai's name may be derived from {{w|Oda Nagamasu}}, who also went by the name {{Lang|Urakusai|ja=有楽斎}}. Notably, both Nagamasu and Urakusai are noted for their expertise in tea; Nagamasu was a master of the Japanese tea ceremony who learned directly from {{w|Sen no Rikyū}}.
