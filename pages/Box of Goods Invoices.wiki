'''Box of Goods Invoices''' are quest items obtained during the [[World Quest]] ''[[Big Business]]'', found throughout Dihua Marsh and Stone Gate in the region of [[Liyue]].

Two can be collected in [[Dihua Marsh]], while the third one requires the player to talk to [[Bao'er]], an NPC found at [[Stone Gate]], who will exchange the third box for 3 [[Noctilucous Jade]]s.

==Description==
''Although it only contains papers, it's still pretty heavy. You can't help but to start sympathizing the merchants that deal with them daily.''

''A box containing invoices of goods. Common sense says that to avoid raising any suspicion, it's usually best to not open to open the box and take a peek.''

''A box containing various invoices. It appears to have been opened once before and then tightly sealed back up. What nature of business could make even one who stumbles upon the box feel at nerve's end?''

==Notes==
* During the ''Big Business'', the quest will highlight all three locations on the map. The first can be found in a cave on the island to the left of the title, Dihua Marsh. The second can be found near the Statue of the Seven waypoint in Dihua Marsh.
