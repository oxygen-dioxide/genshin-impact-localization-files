{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Shima Masaoki:''' Hey, who are you? You don't work here, do you?
:'''Shima Masaoki:''' This is [[Tenshukaku]], the office of Inazuma's most important officials. Everyone here has a big job to do.
:'''Shima Masaoki:''' If you disturb anyone here, I will happily escort you away from the premises.
:{{DIcon}} Making some preparations, are we?
:;(After completing ???)
::'''Shima Masaoki:''' Of course. I'm always looking to do something for the Shogunate.
::'''Shima Masaoki:''' Word on the street is that the fog over [[Tsurumi Island]]'s gone, and that people might be sent there. The way I see it, the new troops need more training now than ever before!
::'''Shima Masaoki:''' I mean, we can't have them panicking the moment there's a whiff on danger in the air there! That would be an embarrassment!
:{{DIcon}} What big job are you doing?
::'''Shima Masaoki:''' Reprimanding new recruits and fixing morale.
::'''Shima Masaoki:''' Young people these days are lazy. If no one is strict with them, the entire group becomes one big mess.
::'''Shima Masaoki:''' I need to let them know that serving as a guard of Tenshukaku is a precious honor not to be taken lightly!
::'''Shima Masaoki:''' What most people would give for an opportunity like this... They must discipline themselves and work hard to rise through the ranks, just like me!
::{{DIcon}} Just like you?
::'''Shima Masaoki:''' Correct.
::'''Shima Masaoki:''' I wasn't born into this position as a military officer.
::'''Shima Masaoki:''' I came from nothing, relying on nothing but my own diligence and dedication to earn recognition from the old Hatamoto lord, gradually rising through the ranks from infantry to one of the Hatamoto forces.
::'''Shima Masaoki:''' The clan name I have the pleasure to humbly serve is a symbol of my pride!
::'''Shima Masaoki:''' My experience is evidence that if you work tirelessly, you will be successful.
::'''Shima Masaoki:''' If these new soldiers work as hard as I have, they too will eventually earn a place among the Hatamoto forces!
:{{DIcon}} Got it.
::'''Shima Masaoki:''' Hmph, you better understand.
