The first time I served him salt and pepper tofu, he took just one bite, and then proceeded to say: "It would be better to try sea salt extracted from the shallow seas of Guyun Stone Forest, because it would bring a fresh sense of depth to the tofu." I tried it and the taste was just so different! He's just amazing, don't you think!?

She doesn't come to the [[Wanmin Restaurant]] very often &mdash; but when she does, she sits alone in the corner and eats her meal in total silence. Poor girl, she seems kinda lonely... I always give her an extra-large portion because I feel sorry for her. Funniest thing is, she eats every last bite, every time!

|vo_08_09_tx         = Hee-hee, I'm proud to call her my junior! She hasn't swung by the Wanmin Restaurant in ages, though. Maybe [[Madame Ping|master]] is trying to protect her from me or something... Last time we hung out, I was about to dig into some fresh raw octopus from the Sea of Clouds, but not only did she stop me from eating it, she sent master to tell me off too! Ugh... Honestly, sometimes it feels like I'm the one who gets treated like the junior...

|vo_08_11_tx         = Yelan? Of course, I remember her! When I first met her, I was certain she'd be the kind of gal who'd prefer lighter dishes... turned out that she can handle the most spice out of all my customers! Apparently, my dishes weren't spicy enough for her, because she started taking bites of raw Jueyun Chilis! Truly amazing.

** '''About Zhongli...:''' In Chinese, Xiangling says (parts that are the same as English omitted): "[...] but the precision of Mr. Zhongli's palate is really one-of-a-kind. The other day, I first served him salt and pepper tofu. He took just one bite, then asked me what kind of salt I used. Then he said... what was it... [...]"
