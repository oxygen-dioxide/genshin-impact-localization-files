|text      = In the desert, we make candy from the finest [[Ajilenakh Nut]]s and offer them as gifts. [[Uncle Anpu]] says the nuts are growing especially well this year, so I've already set aside the largest and juiciest ones for the cherished guests of [[Aaru Village]].

At dawn, the bells of caravan [[Sumpter Beast]]s chime gently, scholars weave through the village clutching scrolls, and children's bright voices trade tales of wonders beyond the [[Wall of Samiel]]... The growing bonds between Aaru Village and the rainforest trace back to what you did here.

If you are ever tired from your journey, why not return to Aaru Village and rest awhile? We may not have festive bonfires, but I promise you protection and restful nights. 

For you, Aaru Village's doors are always open.
