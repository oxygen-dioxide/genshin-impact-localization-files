The {{Lang|'''Sangonomiya Clan'''|ja=珊瑚宮家|ja_rm=Sangonomiya-ke}} is one of the major noble clans of [[Inazuma]]. Unlike the other known clans of Inazuma, they do not have any known positions in the [[Inazuma Shogunate]] and worship [[Orobashi]] instead of the [[Ei|Raiden Shogun]].

Historically, they were on relatively poor terms with the Shogun and her government, having fought against her in an unnamed war that resulted in their loss when the Raiden Shogun supposedly<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2|Before Sun and Moon}}</ref> killed their serpent god, [[Orobashi]]. When the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] was declared, the clan immediately opposed her once more and was at war with the [[Tenryou Commission]], forming a [[Watatsumi Army|resistance group]]. After the Vision Hunt Decree and Sakoku Decree were abolished, Sangonomiya and Narukami were at peace once more.

Their residence is located on [[Watatsumi Island]], the outermost of the Inazuma archipelago. Additionally, they had a few forward outposts and war camps set up on [[Yashiori Island]].

Great houses that serve the Sangonomiya Clan include the [[Yuna Clan]].<ref name="Life of Mouun">{{Ref/Book|The Life of Mouun the Shrine Maiden}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* Considering Sangonomiya Kokomi has several Okinawan-inspired abilities, the clan may be loosely based on the {{w|Second Shō dynasty|Second Shou clan}}, a former royal house of Okinawa that ruled Ryukyu islands under the title {{w|Ryukyu Kingdom|King of Ryukyu}} between 1469 and 1879.
** During the 16th century, the clan established the priestesshood {{w|Kikoe-ōgimi|Kikoe-oogimi}} (Chifijin in Okinawan), or the High Priestess of the {{w|Ryukyuan religion}} that still takes the role of the spiritual leader of the religion to this day; the Divine Priestess of the Watatsumi Island may be inspired by this tradition.
** However, unlike the in-game Sangonomiya Clan whose origin is different from other major Inazuman clans, the Second Shou clan claims to be a descendant of the mainland samurai {{w|Minamoto no Tametomo}} (1139–1170), who in turn is a descendant of {{w|Emperor Seiwa}} of Japan (850–881); therefore, the historical clan is perhaps only an inspirational source for the Sangonomiya Clan rather than a direct root.
** The ''kamon'' (family crest) of the real former royal family is ''mitsudomoe'', which is curiously used as the ''kamon'' of the Raiden Shogun in this game.
