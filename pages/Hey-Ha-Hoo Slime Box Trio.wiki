|description    = A combination of wooden chests with a rather unique appearance. It is said that three different colored [[slime]]s are named "Hey Hey" "Ha Ha" and "Hoo Hoo." The craftsmanship is a bit shoddy, but it creates a rather endearing effect. A common sight within the [[Veluriyam Mirage]], they are often used as decorations, but the staff of various attractions use them to store tools or their personal belongings. In addition, their popularity with guests has led to their inclusion on the list of potential prizes for many attractions.<br>However, as the latches are rather flimsy, they are not recommended to be used as storage containers, and so are filled with lots of fragrant plants and anti-moisture barriers, so that it can be used as an interior decoration without need for long-term maintenance.
