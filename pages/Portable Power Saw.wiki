==Description==
A chainsaw favored by workers of the past to cut through keels and pipes.<br>
Its simple and sturdy structure made maintenance and swapping parts a breeze.<br>
Grab the handle tightly with both hands, and even hard steel will be split before you.<br>
This all-powerful tool was once the hallmark of progress.

As the urban areas of [[Fontaine]] grew, the light of order drove away the shadows.<br>
It was largely due to this convenient tool that the sewers eventually became the [[Fleuve Cendre]].<br>
The people of the Fleuve Cendre believed that, though they lived in a city below the city with neither rain nor sun,<br>
The workers' abundant diligence and tenacity occasionally won them the right to live on the surface,<br>
And at other times turned their underground watery realm into a residence just as beautiful as the world above.

Unlike dock swords and exploration drills, these chainsaws were not banned.<br>
This was because such chainsaws played an irreplaceable role in the early production of [[clockwork meka]].<br>
Later on, a massive clockwork meka factory was constructed in an absolutely safe area outside the city,<br>
And those who could skillfully utilize these saws were gradually washed away alongside their weapons by the torrent of progress.
