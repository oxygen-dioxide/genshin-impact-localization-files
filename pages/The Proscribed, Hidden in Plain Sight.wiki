:{{A|vo fdaq103 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *stretching* Are you awake, {{Traveler}}?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm? What's wrong? You seem to have something on your mind... Did you dream about something last night?
:{{DIcon}} I dreamed of Childe...
:{{DIcon}} Rather, in the dream, I was Childe...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is that even possible? Unless... It wasn't an ordinary dream?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah.... Childe's Vision! So you had it with you this whole time...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Maybe the Vision connected Childe's consciousness to yours?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe I can use his Vision...
:{{DIcon}} To see everything he experienced from his perspective.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And our investigation has its first major breakthrough! Good thing you brought the Vision with you here.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So what did you see in the dream? Do you know where Childe went?
:{{DIcon}} The dream was a little hazy...
:{{DIcon}} And I didn't see anything particularly useful.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, okay... Well, hopefully it'll be a bit more helpful in the future.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's more important now is that it's the start of another new day as prisoners. Let's do our best to earn more Credit Coupons!
:{{A|vo fdaq103 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's the plan for today?
:{{DIcon}} Let's go work in the production zone.
:{{DIcon}} Let's spend some coupons to skip work.
::{{A|vo fdaq103 1 paimon 11b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? You want to spend our coupons on slacking off already? We'd better go to work and earn some more coupons first. We'll have more room to relax once we've got some spare coupons to fall back on!
:{{A|vo fdaq103 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go, it's time to start working. If that guard Fielding catches us skulking about, he's sure to give us an earful.
:{{Black Screen|You arrive at the Production Zone...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq103 3 grainville 01.ogg}} '''Grainville:''' Look who decided to show up! Get your butts in gear and get to work, time's a-wasting!
:{{DIcon}} Already on it!
::{{A|vo fdaq103 3 grainville 02a 1.ogg}} '''Grainville:''' Good, here you go! Remember to give me the widget once you're finished processing it.
:{{DIcon}} Could you explain the job to me again?
::{{A|vo fdaq103 3 grainville 02b 1.ogg}} '''Grainville:''' Your job is to use the machine over there to process these widgets.
::{{A|vo fdaq103 3 grainville 02b 2.ogg}} '''Grainville:''' You step on the pedal when the timing is right. If the machine gets jammed, give it a good whack or two and it'll fix it right up. You got it?

;(Process the widget)
:{{A|vo fdaq103 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, finished!

;(Talk to Grainville)
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's beat... but after so many shifts, it seems we're really getting the hang of it now.
:{{DIcon}} It does seem to be getting easier.
:{{DIcon}} All you do is float around telling me what to do.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 rowan 01.ogg}} '''Rowan:''' Hey there, fellow shift-mates! I saw you just finished your work so I thought I'd come over and say hi.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, hey there! We've seen you before, your assigned workspace is really close, isn't it?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 rowan 02.ogg}} '''Rowan:''' Haha, that's right. The name's Rowan. These past few days I couldn't help but notice the new faces working nearby, I guess we were destined to meet.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 rowan 03.ogg}} '''Rowan:''' I've been working here for almost 15 years. Even the foreman, Grainville, always calls me "Chief."
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, you've been working here a long time, Chief!
:{{DIcon}} Hey, Chief.
:{{DIcon}} In other words, you haven't managed any improvement in 15 years.
::{{A|vo fdaq103 9 paimon 04b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Not so loud...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 rowan 04.ogg}} '''Rowan:''' Hahaha... If there's anything you'd like to know, just ask me. I know the work here in the production zone better than the back of my hand.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, Chief! We'll be sure to come to you first!
:{{DIcon}} I think I've got the work more or less down pat...
:{{DIcon}} We just haven't quite learned all the "rules."
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 rowan 05.ogg}} '''Rowan:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 rowan 06.ogg}} '''Rowan:''' Did you just ask about... the "rules"?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 rowan 07.ogg}} '''Rowan:''' Heh, pretty sharp for newcomers. You've already heard about the "rules," huh?&nbsp;...Who'd you hear it from?
:{{DIcon}} I don't think you need to know that.
:{{DIcon}} The "hidden rules"... That's what they're called, right?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 rowan 08.ogg}} '''Rowan:''' Hmm... Alright, seeing as I'm the one who came over here and you're already callin' me "Chief," I guess I can tell you a little.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 rowan 09.ogg}} '''Rowan:''' Truth is, you two keep workin' like this, you might be puttin' yourselves in danger.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Wait, there's even a rule about that? What would've happened if you never told us about this...?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 rowan 10.ogg}} '''Rowan:''' Well, it's usually not that easy to break one on accident... The conditions of the "hidden rules" are usually pretty specific, but once you do break one, bad things happen.
:{{DIcon}} So the conditions in this case are...?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 rowan 11.ogg}} '''Rowan:''' If you work continuously in the production zone for three days, and if all you do besides eating and sleeping is just work...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 rowan 12.ogg}} '''Rowan:''' Then something bad will happen during lunch on the third day.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh! Like what!? Oooh, don't scare Paimon!
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 rowan 13.ogg}} '''Rowan:''' Heh, if I knew that, then I wouldn't be standing here talking to you, now would I?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You mean, even you have never tried working three days like that before?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 rowan 14.ogg}} '''Rowan:''' There's actually a legend about this rule...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 rowan 15.ogg}} '''Rowan:''' They say that there was a worker who worked way harder than me. He was both efficient and eager on the job, and most other workers couldn't hold a candle to him.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 rowan 16.ogg}} '''Rowan:''' One time, he tried to test his limits and worked as long as he could. Then, during lunch on the third day...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 rowan 17.ogg}} '''Rowan:''' He disappeared into thin air, as if he'd evaporated. Later, some people went and asked some of his past friends about him, but they said... "Never heard of the guy."
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What the...!? How could that happen?
:{{DIcon}} What did that worker look like?
:{{DIcon}} Did you ever see him?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 rowan 18.ogg}} '''Rowan:''' Unfortunately, we were assigned different production zones. I never saw for myself what he looked like.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, are you thinking that it was...
:{{DIcon}} Thank you very much for the information.
:{{DIcon}} We'll give it a try...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 rowan 19.ogg}} '''Rowan:''' Oh?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 rowan 20.ogg}} '''Rowan:''' You... *sigh* Listen, kid, this ain't the kind of thing you should be curious about. Let me tell you, you're better off forgetting about it and looking after yourself. Now I kinda regret ever telling you...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 9 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, I agree with Chief here... Do you really want to try?
:{{DIcon}} It sounds like a good lead to me.
:{{DIcon}} Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

::{{A|vo fdaq103 13 collins 11.ogg}} '''Collins:''' OK, the "hidden rule" here is... If you buy both boxers' tickets and support them both...
::{{A|vo fdaq103 13 collins 12.ogg}} '''Collins:''' Something bad will happen the next morning...
::{{A|vo fdaq103 13 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So the rule is that we shouldn't pick both boxers in the same fight? But if anyone actually did that, wouldn't they be guaranteed to lose coupons... Who would do that anyway?

::{{A|vo fdaq103 13 collins 15.ogg}} '''Collins:''' According to the rumor, there was a masked boxer who possessed incredible skill and power. None of his opponents even stood a chance against him...
::{{A|vo fdaq103 13 collins 16.ogg}} '''Collins:''' However, in the final match, the organizers told him to take off his mask. He refused, and never showed up to the fight.
::{{A|vo fdaq103 13 collins 17.ogg}} '''Collins:''' And after that, he was never seen again. Some say he died, or that he was taken care of by the event's organizers. But everyone remembers that he was someone who cherished honor above all else...
::{{A|vo fdaq103 13 collins 18.ogg}} '''Collins:''' In his eyes, supporting both boxers in a match would dishonor the competition itself.
::{{A|vo fdaq103 13 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, you mean... It's like a curse? He'll take vengeance on anyone who does that?

:{{A|vo fdaq103 14 roussimoff 08.ogg}} '''Roussimoff:''' ...Alright, then, if you're absolutely sure. Remember, no refunds once you buy the tickets.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 14 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, yeah, we got it. Just shut up and take our coupons!
:{{Black Screen|You leave the Pankration Ring and return to the dormitories...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq103 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* Looks like we won't get a chance to sleep in as long as we're here. Let's get to bed early.
:;(Time passes)
:{{Color|menu|The next morning, you receive an unexpected package...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq103 15 fielding 01.ogg}} '''Fielding:''' Hey, Traveler, Paimon! Package here for ya.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 15 fielding 02.ogg}} '''Fielding:''' The next time you buy something, go pick it up yourself. I'm not a deliveryman, you know.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 15 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? A package... For us? Did you buy something, {{Traveler}}? *yawn* Paimon's not quite awake yet, so why don't you go take a look...
:{{DIcon}} I didn't buy anything.
:{{DIcon}} Unless, this is...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 15 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, right! Yesterday we broke the "hidden rule" and bought tickets for both boxers. Maybe this package is the "bad thing" that Collins said would happen...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 15 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, Paimon suddenly feels wide awake! Wait, maybe let Paimon go hide somewhere first. Just call for Paimon AFTER you've opened it!
:{{A|vo fdaq103 15 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, wait, wait! Paimon's still here, don't open it! Ahh!
:{{DIcon}} Doesn't seem especially scary.
:{{DIcon}} But there is something a little odd inside.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 15 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What is it? Are you okay?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 15 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' L&mdash;Let Paimon take a peek too...
:[[File:Clue Book The Strange Blood-Colored Fluid.png|120px]]
:{{A|vo fdaq103 15 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, it's just a small bottle... but the color of the liquid inside looks so wrong, almost like...
:{{DIcon}} Hmm, rumor has it that a boxer went missing...
:{{DIcon}} And the liquid in the bottle obviously looks like blood...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 15 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, that's enough of that! No need to say it out loud, Paimon already knows what you're trying to say...
:{{DIcon}} Do you want to give it a sniff?
:{{DIcon}} Do you want to give it a taste?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 15 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Blegh, no way! Get that stuff away from Paimon!
:{{DIcon}} Seems we'll have to investigate.
:{{DIcon}} This place is chock-full of strange happenings after all...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 15 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks we shouldn't open the bottle until we've figured out what's going on. Just trust Paimon on this one, okay!?
:;(Obtain [[Clue Book (Fortress of Meropide)]] entry, ''The Strange Blood-Colored Fluid'')
:{{A|vo fdaq103 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What do you plan on doing now?
:{{DIcon}} Investigate the clues you discovered (-400 Coupons)
:;{{Color|menu|In order to investigate the truth behind the "strange package," you decide to look for more leads.}}
::{{A|vo fdaq103 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Though it feels nice to slack off a little, less work means less coupons... Let's make the most of our morning!

;(Talk to Collins)
:{{Color|menu|You and Collins discuss the matter...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 collins 01.ogg}} '''Collins:''' I heard you crazy fools really did it, you bought tickets to support both fighters, didn't ya? Well? Did anything happen?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, the next day we received a mysterious package, but we still haven't made any sense of the contents...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 collins 02.ogg}} '''Collins:''' So it is real... You didn't become cursed or anything like that, did ya? Are you both still okay? Wait, are you sure that it's still you controlling your bodies right now?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, Paimon's not sure... What do you think, {{Traveler}}? Is Paimon still Paimon?
:{{DIcon}} Only you'd ever ask such a question, so I'm pretty sure you're fine.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, okay... well, that's good!
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 collins 03.ogg}} '''Collins:''' Yeah, you two don't seem to have changed at all, but I wouldn't let your guard down just yet...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 collins 04.ogg}} '''Collins:''' Still, I didn't expect you would actually do it. You'd actually throw away coupons like that, just to satisfy your curiosity?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Even if we bought tickets like everybody else, it's not like we could hope to earn any coupons...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' When it comes to things like this, it's always the organizer who makes the real profits.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 collins 05.ogg}} '''Collins:''' Hey, just what are you trying to imply? The Pankration Ring is an honest business, and we really don't make much from selling tickets...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 collins 06.ogg}} '''Collins:''' We make so little that even the current tournaments can only be held thanks to funding from the producer of Fonta.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so it's the company that manufactures Fonta sponsoring the events? Paimon thought all of this was thanks to the Duke's support.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 collins 07.ogg}} '''Collins:''' Let's just say it's a mutually beneficial arrangement... They reached out to us first, hoping to promote Fonta products in the Fortress of Meropide.
:{{DIcon}} I understand.
:{{DIcon}} That's some important info.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 collins 08.ogg}} '''Collins:''' *sigh* Anyway, you try and take extra good care of yourselves these next few days, you hear?
:;(Obtain [[Clue Book (Fortress of Meropide)]] entry, ''Sponsor of the Pankration Tournament'')

;(Talk to Collins again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq103 collins 01.ogg}} '''Collins:''' Oh, it's you. Heh, you must be absolutely loaded with coupons if you have time to stroll around like this.

;(Approach the scattered papers near the Pankration Ring)
:{{Color|menu|You find some scattered information around the Pankration Ring...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, what are these papers scattered all over the ground? Are they registration forms or something?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, maybe not... Every page has the Fonta Co. symbol on it. Maybe it's some flyers from the company?
:{{DIcon}} Let's take a look before anyone else shows up.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, okay. But if someone catches us, they could accuse us of trying to steal the company's secrets, couldn't they?
:{{DIcon}} What're you afraid of? We're already convicted criminals.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, hehe, you're right! Guess there's nothing to worry about then, let Paimon have a look here...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Without assistance from the Fontaine Research Institute, development of the new product has been slow, and some researchers on the project have voiced concerns.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We have no choice but to let the new product undergo the first phase of promotional trials without a designated name or packaging. We will adjust the direction of future development according to feedback...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We have decided to only conduct closed, small-scale trials for the time being...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure doesn't seem like anything unusual... The company is just trying to develop some new products besides Fonta, but it sounds like things aren't going well at all.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's put these papers back where we found them, and make it look like nobody went through them... Okay, good.

;(Talk to Promoter)
:{{Color|menu|You meet a product promoter from the Fonta Company...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 promoter 01.ogg}} '''Promoter:''' *sigh* If there's no way to send it all out, then maybe I'll never get a chance to leave...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, who are you? We've never seen you before, and you don't look like a fellow convict.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 promoter 02.ogg}} '''Promoter:''' I'm not! Of course I'm not. Please don't mistake me for a criminal, I'm a good, law-abiding citizen.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then what are you doing here? You sure seem anxious about something.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 promoter 03.ogg}} '''Promoter:''' I'm a promoter for Fonta Co., and I'm usually responsible for promoting our drink products. I thought I could complete my task here quickly and return to headquarters, but I've been here way longer than I anticipated...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, a promoter from Fonta Co.! So what kind of problem did you run into?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 promoter 04.ogg}} '''Promoter:''' Ugh, I'm so upset... It's all because of that Duke.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 promoter 05.ogg}} '''Promoter:''' After discussing the company's promotional plans with him, he told me outright that my project was worthless.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 promoter 06.ogg}} '''Promoter:''' However, in light of our long history of successful collaboration, I still tried to patiently explain the details. However, to my surprise, he just cut me off while I was speaking!
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 promoter 07.ogg}} '''Promoter:''' Let me take a moment and recall his exact words...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 promoter 08.ogg}} '''Promoter:''' I'm just gonna stop you there and say no. If anything, I'm saving you time.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 promoter 09.ogg}} '''Promoter:''' It seems you don't fully understand the value of Credit Coupons here, nor do you understand the value of your own products. The former is because you are from the overworld, that's understandable and I don't blame you for that.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 promoter 10.ogg}} '''Promoter:''' But as for the latter, only someone monumentally stupid, so breathtakingly stupid that they were completely ignorant of the value of Credit Coupons despite living in the underworld would ever possibly consider buying your drink. Let's just forget it.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 promoter 11.ogg}} '''Promoter:''' Anyway, that's how he rejected my proposal and asked me to come up with another solution with the condition that it doesn't cause any trouble for him. Can you believe that guy...?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, well, he is the head honcho here. Not much you can do about that. We met him too and could tell that he's the kind of guy that's hard to pin down.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 16 promoter 12.ogg}} '''Promoter:''' Fine, fine, I should just let it go... I'm on his turf, after all. His house, his rules.

;(Talk to Promoter again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq103 promoter 01.ogg}} '''Promoter:''' I just don't want to be stuck here forever...

;(Eat at the Coupon Cafeteria)
:{{A|vo fdaq103 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, we ended up here without even thinking about it... Wanna grab something to eat?
:{{DIcon}} Let's end the shift.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, but remember that we bought this time with coupons, so let's make better use of it next time.

;(After all relevant clues in this quest have been found and the day ends)
:{{A|vo fdaq103 17 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A mysterious box, a bottle of crimson liquid... Paimon still doesn't know what to make of it.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 17 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you have any ideas, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} I think I've got something...
:{{DIcon}} But unfortunately, it's not related to Childe.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 17 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Then it looks like that part of the investigation led us nowhere...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 17 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, we'll keep searching for more clues tomorrow. Good night, {{Traveler}}.

===Unsorted Voice-Overs===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq103 deakin 01.ogg}} '''Deakin:''' Just like His Grace said, paying attention to every little detail is the key to prosperity. Hmm, maybe this is the true meaning of "rebirth," not just earning Credit Coupons...
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq103 grainville 01.ogg}} '''Grainville:''' What're you two doing here? Don't know how to take a day off?
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq103 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, no, not at all! Not working really agrees with us!
:{{A|vo fdaq103 3 paimon 08a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow! Impressive philosophy. Could that be the secret sauce behind the blond Traveler's success?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We don't have enough coupons to skip work, let's go earn some more before trying to take any time off.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 4 paimon 06b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, it costs 300 Credit Coupons to enter the ring.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 4 paimon 06b 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's save enough coupons first, and do something else for now.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 4 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, giving it your all even when it's just a game. That's {{Traveler}} for ya!
:{{A|vo fdaq103 5 collins 01.ogg}} '''Collins:''' Oh? You must be {{Traveler}}, huh? Sorry, mate, but competitors as strong as you are prohibited from participating. I don't make the rules, mind you, but I was given very specific instructions...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 5 collins 02.ogg}} '''Collins:''' Even convicts value their lives, don't they? I hope you can understand, haha...
:{{A|vo fdaq103 5 collins 03.ogg}} '''Collins:''' But we have a game here that'll let you show off your strength, and you'll even earn some Credit Coupons in the process. What do you think? Interested?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 5 collins 04.ogg}} '''Collins:''' Of course! That's the cruel reality facing every competitor in a place like the Pankration Ring.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 5 collins 15.ogg}} '''Collins:''' OK. Great, let me walk you through the rules.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 5 collins 16.ogg}} '''Collins:''' The targets in front of you will pop up one after another.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 5 collins 17.ogg}} '''Collins:''' You'll need to hit the targets in the same order that they popped up. If you can complete a few rounds in a row with no mistakes, then you'll win Credit Coupons.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 5 collins 18.ogg}} '''Collins:''' But the second you mess up the order, you lose. Game over.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 5 collins 19.ogg}} '''Collins:''' The game costs 300 Credit Coupons to have a go. So, you up for it?
:{{A|vo fdaq103 5 collins 20.ogg}} '''Collins:''' Then come back once you've got enough coupons, I'll still be here to start the game for ya.
:{{A|vo fdaq103 5 collins 23.ogg}} '''Collins:''' Not bad, not bad at all... Here, the coupons you won. Be sure not to lose 'em.

:{{A|vo fdaq103 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess we'll have to come back later. For now, we can either look for more leads or go back and rest.
