'''Sea Breeze Dandelion''' is a 4-Star [[Character Outfit]] for [[Jean]]. It is purchasable from the [[Character Outfit Shop]].

During [[Version 1.6]], Sea Breeze Dandelion was available at a [[Sea Breeze Dandelion Discount|limited-time discount]] of {{Item|Genesis Crystal|30|x=1350}}. After [[Version 2.0]], its cost was increased to {{Item|Genesis Crystal|30|x=1680}}.

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Jean's hair is tied back into a high ponytail with a black bow. On her ears, she wears a pair of gold cross earrings.

Jean sports a blue sleeveless shirt with matching puffy blue arm cuffs, high-waisted white shorts that stop at her upper thigh, and a dark blue belt that has a chain attached to it. Her black bow is also replaced with a larger blue one. On her thigh is an elegant blue leglet with a light blue rose on it. Her [[Vision]] is attached to a ring with a bow under it. The shoes she wears are a pair of lace-up blue sandals.

==Description==
The Acting Grand Master's life runs like the gears of a machine, driven by the great force of heavy responsibility, constantly being ground down by work.<br />
Over time, the armor of chivalry has become like Jean's second skin, the presentation of proper dress code and a formal image becoming ever more firmly forged into her nature.<br />
But in truth, Jean is no older than the ordinary young women around her.

In the novels that these young ladies enjoy, gorgeous gowns are as quintessential as sun, moon, and starlight themselves, and some opulent noble scions do indeed sit pretty in dresses that sprawl out like palaces, their hem-lines and long skirts intertwined like the lapping waves of the sea.<br />
Perhaps Jean once had such romantic aspirations too. After all, who has never hankered after the blissful beauty of luxury?

But now, Jean has had her wish granted with a set of form-fitting summer wear made just for her &mdash; and this one item has far surpassed any number of beauteous dresses that appeared in her novels.<br />
"I heard that the original idea was [[Barbara]]'s and that she and [[Lisa]] searched every store before deciding on the most suitable design."<br />
"Then [[Kaeya]] was somehow able to convince Master [[Diluc]] to hire craftsmen to make some modifications..."<br />
"...With fabric chosen by [[Amber]] out of her experience with making [[Explosive Puppet|Baron Bunnies]], to render it comfortable but relatively inexpensive..."<br />
"...And with gems for decoration picked from [[Albedo]] and [[Klee]]'s collections."<br />
"The tailoring was then overseen by [[Noelle]], right down to the last needle and thread..."<br />
"...And the detailed dimensions were provided by Lisa, who even sewed this lovely rose ornament on personally..."<br />
This gift, made for her by everyone, was the loveliest surprise she had ever had.

If her previous holiday was a tiny respite amidst a sea of work, this seaside trip was an unexpected opportunity to fully relax.<br />
Having laid her armor aside, she now shimmered in the sea's light like a twirling dandelion.<br />
"This... is the first time I've ever had such a relaxing summer holiday."
