{{Description|[[Ludi Harpastum]] has gotten better for [[Collei]], but where will fate lead her next?}}
'''Serpent's Dance''' is Chapter 11 of the ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' [[manga]].

==Summary==
After cornering [[Collei]] in an empty alley, [[Kaeya]] suddenly attacks her with his [[Cryo]] powers, aware that she is the culprit of the black fire incident. He sends out continuous waves of ice shards as Collei dodges until she is forced to unleash the powers of the [[god]] remains within her. Fueled by its darkness, Collei destroys Kaeya's attacks as he pushes her to fight at full strength. 

At the statue of [[Barbatos]], the [[Ludi Harpastum]] tradition is being performed. [[Amber]] is upset at Kaeya for tricking her into searching the area for [[Fatui]] devices. She suddenly notices a beam of light in the distance and heads towards it.

Collei continues fighting Kaeya in the alley, with no control over her powers. Kaeya creates an ice sword to attack, but Collei's powers easily overpower him. As Kaeya expected, Amber arrives at the scene just in time to witness Collei strangling Kaeya. Collei manages to momentarily regain control of herself, freeing Kaeya. Not willing to let her escape, he prepares to strike her once more but to his shock, Collei willingly asks Kaeya to kill her. His hesitation allows Amber to interfere and escape with Collei. Kaeya is left musing over Collei's words as [[Barnabas|someone]] watches him from above.
