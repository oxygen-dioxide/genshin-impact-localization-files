{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Godwin)
:'''Godwin''': ...Ugh, I am so ready to just get back to Mondstadt...
:'''Godwin''': Oh, Traveler! Hi! Can I ask you a favor?
:'''Godwin''': As you can see, I'm with the Knights, and I'm on patrol right now.
:'''Godwin''': I told my girlfriend I would send her a letter before too long, just to let her know I'm safe and sound.
:'''Godwin''': Then things got busy and I forgot all about it... dear me. Could you deliver this {{Color|buzzword|letter}} to her for me? Her name's {{Color|buzzword|Glory}}...
:{{DIcon}} Wait&mdash; Glory?
:'''Paimon''': The blind girl... Dandelion Seed collector...
:'''Paimon''': Aha! You must be Godwin? Glory mentioned you!
:'''Godwin''': Wha&mdash; How do you know Glory?
:{{DIcon}} She had us run an errand for her.
:'''Godwin''': She made you run an errand, you say? I hope it wasn't anything dangerous...
:'''Paimon''': She just asked us to get her some Dandelion Seeds, that's all. She said by releasing them into the wind, they would convey her heart's desires to you.
:'''Godwin''': Dandelion Seeds, eh? That does sound like my Glory alright.
:{{DIcon}} Hang on, she said you were supposed to be somewhere far away from Mondstadt?
:'''Godwin''': Yes&mdash; erm, well that was the plan... Let me, uh, fill you in.
:'''Godwin''': Did you hear about the time the Grand Master left Mondstadt and took four out of every five knights with him?
:'''Godwin''': Right, well, I was one of the ones assigned to that expedition. But unfortunately... just as we were getting ready to set off, I realized I'd lost the keepsake that Glory gave me. By the time I was done looking for it, they'd already left...
:'''Godwin''': I&mdash;I still haven't figured out how to catch up with them, and in the meantime I've just been milling around here...
:'''Godwin''': I can't bring myself to go back to Mondstadt. I can only imagine what the knights would think of me if I just came crawling back...
:'''Godwin''': Also... I promised Glory I would send her letters and gifts from all around the world. I said I would send her the world!
:'''Godwin''': If she found out I'd never even made it out of Mondstadt...
:'''Paimon''': You don't want to lose face.
:'''Godwin''': Please, deliver this {{Color|buzzword|letter}} to {{Color|buzzword|Glory}} for me won't you? I bet she's worried sick about me.
:{{DIcon}} Okay.
::'''Godwin''': I can't thank you enough, Traveler! Please keep everything I just told you a secret though.
:{{DIcon}} Why not try the dandelion hotline?
::'''Godwin''': There is so much I want to say to Glory, far more than a handful of Dandelion Seeds could ever hope to carry.
:'''Godwin''': Thank you for taking her my letter. And remember, not a word about any of this!

;(Talk to Godwin again)
:'''Godwin''': Thank you for delivering my letter. *sigh* All I want to do is go back and see Glory... If only...
----
;(After meeting with Glory)
:'''Glory''': Hello. I know that voice... Traveler! It's you, isn't it?
:'''Glory''': What bring you here today?
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Someone told me to bring you this letter.
:'''Glory''': A letter... for me? Who would do that...
:'''Glory''': ...Godwin.
:'''Glory''': Have you seen him? I guess that must mean he's okay&mdash; Did he say when he'll be back?
:'''Glory''': Sorry, forget all that. I'm sure he must be far too busy to answer all these questions, I don't want to put any more pressure on him.
:'''Glory''': But could you read the letter to me?
:'''Glory''': Quietly... No one needs to hear this but the two of us.
:{{DIcon}} Okay.
:;(After reading [[Godwin's Letter]])
:'''Glory''': Wow, you read it so nicely... Is this something you do a lot?
:{{DIcon}} That's the end of the letter.
:'''Glory''': Liyue Harbor... Wow, Godwin really is seeing the world after all!
:'''Glory''': Thank you, I will treasure this letter. Next time you see {{Color|buzzword|Godwin}}, do tell him I'm thinking of him.

;(Talk to Glory again)
:'''Glory''': What is it? Is there something else you need to tell me?
----
;(After meeting with Godwin)
:'''Godwin''': Did you deliver my letter?
:{{DIcon}} Glory sends her best wishes.
:'''Godwin''': Phew... At least she's not mad at me after that long silence.
:'''Paimon''': How do you know about Liyue Harbor when you've been milling around Mondstadt this whole time?
:'''Godwin''': Ah, yes... All my stories are based on things the Grand Master has told me. He's been everywhere.
:'''Godwin''': Anyway, thanks again. You have been a big help.
:'''Godwin''': Here, take these Dandelion Seeds. I picked them myself.
:'''Godwin''': Next time Glory asks you for more Dandelion Seeds, I'd appreciate it if you could help her out again.
