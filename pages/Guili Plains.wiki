{{Location Intro|The {{Lang|'''Guili Plains'''|zh=归离原|zh_rm=Guīlí-yuán}}|description=<p>It was the central area of the [[Guili Assembly]], the ancient civilization ruled by [[Guizhong]], the God of Dust, and [[Morax]], the God of Geo.</p><!--

--><p>The location's name is derived from their names,<ref group="Note">Morax's name during this time is unknown, as "Morax" and "Rex Lapis" are names that were given to him after [[The Seven]] were established. However, it includes the ''li'' also found in his [[Zhongli|current vessel]]'s name.</ref> and it is also called the '''Plains of Returning and Departing''' based on the characters taken from their names.</p><!--

--><p>Unfortunately, during the [[Archon War]], Guizhong died trying to defend her people, and the place was destroyed. After her death, Rex Lapis took his people and brought them south of [[Mt. Tianheng]], where he established [[Liyue Harbor]].</p>}}
