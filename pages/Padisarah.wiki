==Descriptions==
{{Description|A holy and noble plant. The conditions for growth in its environment are very demanding. The flower buds can be processed to make valuable spices.<br />The Padisarah is said to derive its name from a certain ancient deity. It is said that in those times long past, there were three gods who had struck up excellent relations with one another. In those days, there was once a great plain covered in lovely flowers that people would gather up and use as incense to offer up to their gods.<br />Those flowers are no longer extant, but the Padisarah is a cultivar that was brought back to the land via the use of the [[Anahitian Blessing]].|[[Archive]]}}
