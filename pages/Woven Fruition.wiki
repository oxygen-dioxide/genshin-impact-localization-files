|description    = A stall where carpets, tapestries, and finished fabrics are displayed for sale. Such stalls are often seen in many stores in the [[Grand Bazaar]]. Diverse textiles of rich patterns and beautiful colors fascinate tourists and trigger a bulk-purchase impulse. Thanks to the popularization of weaving machinery techniques, quality carpets can be seen in almost every [[Sumeru]] household. Carpets have also become an important part of interior design in Sumeru, and the academic discussions surrounding them are legion — such as pattern design in aesthetics studies and dyeing material enhancement in chemistry studies, and overviews on the development of the textile industry and weaving machinery. Once, a self-claimed "senior" researcher in machinery even had an intense academic argument with an architecture researcher over a related discussion in front of a textile stall. Their argument ended up with both sides "agreeing to disagree," which was later deemed as a classic example of "rational discussion" between researchers.
