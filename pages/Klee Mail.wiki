===I'll Let You in on a Little Secret! (1/5)===
Sender: Klee

Time/Date: 2020-10-24 xx:xx

Today, when I was out on a work, I nearly tripped over some things. When I had a good look, those things turned out to be shiny little rocks. They were so pretty, with so many colours and everything, so I dug them out really carefully... But I don't know what to do with them.

Then I remembered that out of all the people I know, you've been to the most places, Traveler, and you know lots of things! So if I give these little rocks to you, maybe you'll know what to do with them!

Oh yes! I've also been planning a very big, totally safe adventure! If I find anything cool tomorrow, I'll send them to you too!

But remember, you mustn't tell anyone! Shh!

===I Found Something New Today, Too! (2/5)===
Sender: Klee

Time/Date: 2020-10-25 xx:xx

Since being caught by [[Jean|Master Jean]] last time, I've figured that it's safest to go fish blasting when she's busiest!

But when I was leaving today, I felt like Master Jean looked at me longer than usual. That made me feel really bad... I decided that I'd go on my big adventure tomorrow instead.

Soo, I went to [[Springvale]] to play! I picked lots of Philanemo Mushroom from the houses while I was there.

Those mushrooms are my favorite! They're so fuzzy and fluffy!

I've sent you some, hope you like them!

===Let's Get Ready for a Big Adventure! (3/5)===
Sender: Klee

Time/Date: 2020-10-26 xx:xx

I must've had too much fun yesterday. Before i knew it, a whole day passed while I was picking Philanemo Mushrooms!

"I can't do that. I'm supposed to go on a big adventure! Oh, but now my bag is full of mushrooms. If I don't make new treasures soon, I won't be in time for the adventure at all!"

That's what I told myself. So, to make my new treasures, I woke up really early to start catching some lizards. I caught lots and lots of them, and they all had different patterns, too.

I ground most of their tails into powder to make bombs. But these looked too pretty to grind up, so i decided to send them to you instead!

As for my adventure... I'll definitely go on it tomorrow!

===Dropped by Wolvendom Today! (4/5)===
Sender: Klee

Time/Date: 2020-10-27 xx:xx

Not long ago, [[Albedo]] came up with a way to infuse things with [[Electro]] energy. And last night, I dreamed about just such a bomb! Just think about it - I'm sure they'd be more effective at going bang-boom-pow than my usual waterproof bombs!

I was scared of asking [[Lisa]] for help, so after waking up, I ran as fast as i could over to [[Wolvendom]]! But no matter how many bushes I dove into, I couldn't find [[Razor]]...

The more I walked, the more tired i got, and the heavier my backpack felt. And that's when I discovered that lots of Wolfhooks had gotten stuck all over my clothes and pack.

I'm sending them all to you - I won't need them where I'll be adventuring!

===The Big Adventure Was a Big Success! (5/5)===
Sender: Klee

Time/Date: 2020-10-28 xx:xx

I've got some great news, Traveler!

I blasted a ton of fish today! And I didn't get caught by Master Jean, either!

I was super prepared for this adventure - I made the bombs ahead of time, buried them where no one could find them, and picked a lake further away from [[Mondstadt]]!

The fish taste great, you know - and I saved some just for you!

It's just a shame that this adventure is gonna end just like that...

Oh, I know! I'll spend some time writing down everything that happened this time. That way our next big adventure will be just as fun, and just as safe!

You should come along next time, Traveler!
