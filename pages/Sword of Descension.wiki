==Description==
This is a proof that [[Traveler|you]] came to [[Teyvat|this world]] via special means.<br>
Only [[Descender|one who has challenged the "world"]] may wield such a sword.

When this sword was last drawn, humankind was trying to preserve a doomed world.<br>
That world was their last and only home.<br>
This sword was drawn to defy that fate of destruction.<br>
&mdash;But to draw steel against the law of universe that "all who exist must one day perish..."<br>
Surely it must have seemed the height of folly.

But really, when one is faced with such a final fate, when up against the star-devouring [[Abyss|darkness]],<br>
What weapon would be fitting for one to wield? It can only be a sword. If nothing else, it shall bear the memory of those who faced their ends without fear...

When you wield this sword, you search for the answers hidden within this world.<br>
In this world, such a weapon may be used without any problem.<br>
Not for the fact that the universe casts no shadows here, and certainly not simply because it suits this world's aesthetics...<br>
But because this search is perhaps why you descended to this realm in the first place.

When the past is dust, and the future arrives,<br>
As the present fades away, you can trust to this blade's edge.<br>
Having a weapon for self-defense is, of course, a good idea. After all, this one was forged for one such as yourself.<br>
Someone who challenges and pursues.<br>
Take it, walk this earth,

And cut open all the challenges and mysteries that it has to offer you.

==Gameplay Notes==
