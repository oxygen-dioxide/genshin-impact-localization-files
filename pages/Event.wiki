'''Events''' are limited time activities in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' that allows the player to earn [[Event/Rewards|rewards]]. Players must be [[Adventure Rank]] 2 to participate in Events, but most have additional requirements. Some Events include [[Quest]]s that are not available after the Event duration has ended. The Event Menu can be accessed from the [[Paimon Menu]], from the [[File:Icon Events.png|30px|link=]] icon in the top right of screen, or the {{Key|F5}} key on PC.

Some Events allow the player to skip quests requirements using the [[Quick Start]] feature.

See [[Event/History]] for a complete list of Events.
