'''Events''' are limited time activities in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' that allows the player to earn [[Event/Rewards|rewards]]. Players must be [[Adventure Rank]] 2 to participate in Events, but most have additional requirements. Some Events include [[Quest]]s that are not available after the Event duration has ended.

The Events Overview menu can be accessed from the [[Paimon Menu]], from the [[Shortcut Wheel]], from the {{Icon|Events}} icon in the top right of screen, or pressing the {{Key|F5}} key on PC.

Some Events allow the player to skip quests requirements using the [[Quick Start]] feature.
