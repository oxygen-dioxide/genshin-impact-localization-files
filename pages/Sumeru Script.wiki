<section begin="Description" />The '''Vedanagari Script''' refers to one of the writing systems of [[Sumeru]].

This script seems to be based on the [[Teyvat Language|Teyvat alphabet]] and appears to be inspired by {{W|Devanagari}} script, which is used most notably in India. This language is generally used to write English words and sentences, but unlike English, there appears to be no distinct letter case or punctuation.<section end="Description" />

==Trivia==
* The proper name for this script is likely "Vedanagari script," a name which is mentioned in [[Mail/..._(2024-02-11)|Alhaitham's 2024 birthday mail]].
** Vedanagari script is used in [[Sumeru City]]: In the letter, Alhaitham states that [[Isak]]'s rapidly developing skill at reading and writing the Vedanagari script has led him to receive primers from [[Sumeru Akademiya]], and the Chinese name for Vedanagari includes the term {{zh|学城|xuéchéng|academic city,}} which has been used several times to describe Sumeru City. (The English localization translates the term in various ways, including "academy city"<ref>Viewpoint: [[Viewpoint/The City Where All Wisdom Resides|The City Where All Wisdom Resides]]</ref> and "City of Wisdom."<ref>{{Ref/VO|Faruzan|About Lesser Lord Kusanali}}</ref>)
** This script borrows visual features of the real-world Devanagari script, most recognizably the horizontal line that runs along the top of letters. Meanwhile, the name ''Vedanagari'' closely parallels ''Devanagari'' in both the English localization and the original Chinese term:
*** ''Vedanagari'' is a compound of Sanskrit {{Lang|mini=1|sa={{wt|वेद||Sanskrit}}|sa_rm=veda|sa_tl=knowledge}} and {{Lang|mini=1|sa=नागरी|sa_rm=nāgarī|sa_tl=[script] of the city.}} ''Devanagari'' is a compound of Sanskrit {{Lang|mini=1|sa={{wt|देव||Sanskrit}}|sa_rm=deva|sa_tl=deity, divine}} and {{Lang|mini=1|sa=नागरी|sa_rm=nāgarī|sa_tl=[script] of the city.}}
*** The Chinese equivalent for ''Vedanagari'' is {{zh|学城体|Xuéchéngtǐ|Academic City Script,}} while Devanagari is known as {{zh|{{w|zh:天城体|天城体}}|Tiānchéngtǐ|Heavenly City Script}} in Chinese.
