|description     = A grilled dish.
|desc_suspicious = Even at first glance, this is a complete failure &mdash; the color of the eel meat looks exactly the same as the charcoal used to make it. Even when flipped over to eat, the intense stench of charred meat would make one hesitate.
|desc_basic      = The sliced unagi has been steamed first to remove the excess fat before being grilled and sauced. There is no consensus in Inazuma as to where the name "unagi" came from, but everyone at least agrees that it will take a whole lifetime to master its making.
|desc_delicious  = The fat oils sizzle all across the meat's surface like a flowery prelude. The baptism of charcoal fire and moistening sauce has imparted a delicate softness to the unagi's mouthfeel. If you paired this with rice, you'd be liable to leave not even a single drop of sauce behind.

==Trivia==
*The Japanese name {{Lang|Unagi no Kabayaki|ja=うなぎの蒲焼}} refers to the ''{{w|kabayaki}}''-style dish of ''{{w|unagi}}'', meaning freshwater eel, especially the {{w|Japanese eel}}.
*Although the English text says there is a dispute regarding the origin of the fish name ''unagi'' (eels), the Chinese and Japanese texts say it is the dish as a whole whose etymology is disputed, not the fish itself. In fact, there are several theories about the etymology of the Japanese word ''kabayaki'' in real life.
