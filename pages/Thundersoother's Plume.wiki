{{Description|The feather of a predatory bird that soars through lightning storms. It was said to have been adopted as an insignia by the legendary hero who pacified thunder and lightning.}}
'''Thundersoother's Plume''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Thundersoother]].

==Description==
An insignia made in the shape of the plume of a falcon that soared through the storms.<br />Its wearer can almost feel the booming of thunder and the heat of a volcano.

Fearing neither the thunder nor the volcano,<br />the falcon left its plume in the burnt woods.<br />The Thundersoother fashioned an amethyst insignia in the plume's likeness.<br />The purple insignia shimmered with light under the gaze of enemies.<br />On this small object lightning glittered,<br />as if to foreshadow the downfall of the Beast of Thunder.

Like the falcon, the Thundersoother conquered both thunder and flames,<br />and eventually beheaded the Beast of Thunder.
