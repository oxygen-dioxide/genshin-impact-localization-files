==Stages==
===I - Windswept Landscape===
{{Description|This picture seems to depict the Mondstadt cityscape. If you find the right angle, you can easily see the missing scenery. Carefully examine the picture to discover just what is missing. How will the "artistic hallucination" form this time...|The City of Wine and Song map marker}}
{{Description|This picture seems to depict Dawn Winery at sunset. Though some of the scenery in the picture is missing, according to [[Batlo]], if you understand this picture, then you will understand the process of creating it... Uh, maybe just examine the picture carefully first.|Winery's Leisurely Relaxation map marker}}
{{Description|This picture seems to depict Stormterror's Lair at night. Though some of the scenery in the picture is missing, if you examine it carefully like Batlo said and the "artistic hallucinations" are real, then perhaps you'll be able to perceive how this picture was created.|Great Dragon's Residence map marker}}

{{Description|This picture seems to show a huge lake! Based on the details in the painting, it seems to be near Lingju Pass. Examine the picture carefully and find the missing scenery.

===IV - Truth Through Painting===
{{Description|This picture seems to show the landscape of Mondstadt from afar. Carefully examine it and find the missing scenery. But can "artistic hallucinations" faithfully replicate the nuanced shifts of light and shadow?|Gazing Into the Distance map marker}}
{{Description|This picture shows Liyue Harbor from an elevated perspective. Keep following Batlo's advice and carefully examine the picture, find the missing scenery, and then grasp the "artistic hallucination." But the way this "artistic hallucination" changes with each work of art, should it be said to be "artistic," or is it more properly a "hallucination"...|The City That Is the Beating Heart of Commerce map marker}}
{{Description|This picture seems to record the area near Windrise, but just which scenery is missing... Though, could it be that if someone completely masters the rules of forming "artistic hallucinations," then they have the potential to be an artist...?|Mondstadt Scenery map marker}}
