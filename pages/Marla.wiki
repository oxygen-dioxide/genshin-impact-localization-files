:'''Marla:''' Hello... Can I help you with something?
:{{DIcon}} You look sleepy.
::'''Marla:''' *yawn* Yeah... I feel like I'm about to fall asleep any second. So if you've got something to say, tell me quick...
::{{DIcon}} Nothing in particular...
:::'''Marla:''' Okay then... Good thing this bench is here, I think I'll have a nap now.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Why are you so exhausted?
:::'''Marla:''' Hmm... Well, it's because I can only meet with my lover at night.
:::'''Marla:''' The other reason is that I've been reading the Boar Princess series lately. I just finished the grand finale.
:::'''Marla:''' The ending is a bit strange, but it's so wonderful that the Boar Princess and the wolf pup could be together!
:::'''Marla:''' Have you read it? If you haven't, please do... and please help me return it to the library when you've finished it, thanks.
::;(Obtain {{Item|The Boar Princess (VII)|type=Book}})

===Invitation of Windblume===
====Daytime====
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Marla:''' It's [[Windblume Festival]] again... I suppose the Windblumes must be dandelions, after all.
:'''Marla:''' No matter how strong the wind, it can only blow dandelions away, but it will never cause them to perish.
:'''Marla:''' But this is just my opinion. But it may be for this reason that dandelions became the symbols of love.
:'''Marla:''' I hope... I hope that our love will be just as resilient.

<section begin="IoW" />{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Marvin:''' Marla, the Windblume Festival is here, and yet, it holds no meaning for me...
:'''Marla:''' Oh, Marvin, say not that!
:'''Marla:''' We do not have your father's approval, but this time for lovers is ours also...
:'''Marvin:''' No, what I mean is that as long as I am with you, every day may as well be the Windblume Festival.
:'''Marla:''' You're right, Marvin. Our love is like the dandelions that bloom on Cape Oath...
:'''Marvin:''' Marla, no... Our love should not be a thing so fragile...
:'''Marla:''' No, I mean to say that though the dandelions are scattered by the wild winds, their lives will not thusly end.
:'''Marla:''' Dandelion Seeds will fly to distant places, take root, and sprout there... One day, they will cover the length and breadth of Teyvat.
:'''Marvin:''' Oh, my darling Marla...
:'''Marla:''' Oh, Marvin! My love...

:'''Marla:''' No matter what your father thinks of us, my love... is like wine made from Mist Flowers...
:'''Marvin:''' Marla, no... Your love should not be a thing so cold...
:'''Marla:''' No. I mean that, my love will turn into burning liquor to warm you for a thousand &mdash;& nay, for ten thousand years...
:'''Marvin:''' Oh, Marla, my love! Then my love for you is like the bitter north wind that follows the west wind...
:'''Marla:''' Marvin, no... Your love should not be a thing so chilly...
:'''Marvin:''' No. I mean that, I don't want you out of my sight, not even for a moment. I want to turn into a full season of Mondstadt's wind, always by your side...
