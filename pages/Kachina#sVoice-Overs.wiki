How incredibly cool is it to be able to seal the [[Abyss]] beneath the ground as an ordinary mortal? Oh, that reminds me... you've been to a bunch of countries in [[Teyvat]], so you must know a lot of legends, right? I'm super curious... Could you tell me some of them when you can find the time?

Even though I'm nowhere near as strong as a legendary hero right now, if one day, my story could inspire someone else, I'd be the happiest person in the world. Really, just one person would be enough...

He's super strong, so even I get knocked over sometimes. Not much you can do about it, though, because it's just how [[Tepetlisaur]]s show their affection! Oof, Ayo, stop headbutting me!

|vo_08_01_tx         = Mualani's my first good friend! Before I met her, I never even knew that people as sweet as her existed, or how many fun things there are in the world! Look, this is a photo of us! She said we should jump right when they took the photo... I look a bit stiff? Hehe, you caught me! A lot of people were staring at us when we took this photo, so I was really nervous...

|vo_08_02_tx         = It was Mualani who introduced me to him! To be honest, I was a little scared of him at first, because his eyes... well, he's got a scary look. It was only later that I found out that he secretly taught my bullies a lesson. But when I tried to give him a gift to thank him, he refused to take it. He said something along the lines of having already received enough compensation...

|vo_08_03_tx         = She's a famous "peacemaker" in Natlan! They say she can resolve any conflict, no sweat. I guess that she probably does it because like me, she's really not a fan of people getting into fights with each other...

|vo_08_04_tx         = Before, when I wanted to become stronger, I asked Iansan to train me. She had me do all sorts of high-intensity workouts, and I often only managed to get through them by pushing myself to the limit. Luckily, she always knew just the right amount of training for me, so I still had just enough energy to make my way home after each session... I'm really grateful to her.

|vo_08_05_tx         = Mualani told me that you were only able to save me thanks to her invention, so I have to accept my share of the responsibility for the destruction of the [[Spiritspeaker Stone]]. I worked up the courage to apologize to her in person, and asked her to pick a few rocks from my collection as repayment. She scratched her head and said, "Well, it'll become an issue if I don't pick one, won't it? Then... We'll be even as long as I pick something reasonably similar, right?" In the end, she waved me off after taking the most unremarkable piece of obsidian I had. What do you think? Should I try to get her something else? Do you know the kind of thing she likes?

|vo_08_06_tx         = After I received my [[Ancient Name]], Uncle [[Pacal]] took me to see her and asked her to make Turbo Twirly for me. Her craftsmanship really is out of this world!<br>Later, we discussed our experiences collecting and storing gems, and even admired each other's collections. Everything in her collection is in top condition, so she must take great care of them. She seems to take a more... casual approach to her own life, though... Once, I went looking for her, and couldn't find her for ages! I eventually found her basking in the sunshine in a big tree, sound asleep...

She's the idol of every warrior in our land, so being recognized by her is like... *sniffle* I just get overwhelmed every time I think about it, sorry... *sniffle* Sorry, sorry! I shouldn't have started crying...

|vo_08_08_tx         = Ifa's a really amazing sauro-vet! Any little Saurian who sees him comes back and starts living a healthy life! They eat right, sleep well, don't cause trouble, and basically don't get sick again! So whenever a Saurian's looking sick, everyone's first thought is to ask him to fly over and have a look!

"Uthabiti" is my Ancient Name, and I've... I've decided to become the best "me" I can be. There have to be things in this world that only I can accomplish. I will... keep striving.
