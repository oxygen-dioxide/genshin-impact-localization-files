{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Leone:''' Welcome! The weather's rather fine today, isn't it? Is there anything I can help you with?
:{{DIcon}} Hello there.
::'''Leone:''' Welcome, welcome. This is Hotel Debord, a stage for fine food and fine art both.
::'''Leone:''' May you enjoy delicious food and exciting performances both here today.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about the performances...
:::'''Leone:''' If I had to recommend something, it would be the magic show by the Great Magician Lyney and Lynette.
:::'''Leone:''' Their magic is truly a thing of surpassing beauty, and they also have many unexpected ideas!
:::'''Leone:''' That said, their performance times are as unpredictable as their magic tricks.
:::'''Leone:''' You would be very fortunate to meet them indeed.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Leone:''' Take care.
