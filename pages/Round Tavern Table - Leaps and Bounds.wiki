|description    = A large round table that is mounted within [[The Cat's Tail]]. It is made of lightly-scented [[Cuihua Wood]] and has a rather ingenious design that takes both its main uses &mdash; a site for [[Genius Invokation TCG]] matches and a tavern table &mdash; into account. Although the main support structure of this round table is in the middle, it will never have trouble remaining stable no matter how worn it is. This is thanks to [[Margaret]], the owner of the tavern, having stressed the various use cases of such tables while speaking to the craftspeople. For example, it has to be able to withstand a heavy fall by someone defeated in a TCG match, or the slam of hands on the table by drunk customers tickled pink by a friend's humor... And most importantly of all, it has to be able to hold the bulk of The Cat's Tail's collection of rather sturdy feline specimens as they leap from table to floor to table, and survive any incidental impacts that might occur as they play. As for the high costs that came with the reinforcement of the tables' central structures... Well, so long as the cats are happy, there's no price too high!
