|text      = Recently, I accompanied [[Dunyarzad]] on an adventure into the desert. Almost as soon as we'd got back, she was already running around organizing a birthday celebration for me. I wanted to help out, but she just told me not to worry about anything except turning up looking as good as I possibly could. So I got out my make-up box and tried out several different popular styles of makeup with a whole series of beautiful dresses. But in the end, I just couldn't decide which look to go for... If only choosing an outfit was as simple as choosing a weapon! Anyway, it would mean a lot to me if you came. If you're worried about trudging through the desert after having been away for so long, I'll even bring a [[Sumpter Beast]] and come pick you up!
