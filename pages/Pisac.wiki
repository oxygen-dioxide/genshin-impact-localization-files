==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
{{Ancient Name|bearer=1}} Five years ago, Pisac participated in the doomed [[Night Warden War]] which also saw [[Mallko]]'s death. Greatly overwhelmed, exhausted, and badly injured, Pisac and Mallko had their final conversation as they awaited certain doom. Pisac expressed regret that he would be survived by his grieving mother and died of his injuries while Mallko was responding to him. Shortly afterwards, Mallko was killed by [[Riftwolves]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|To Reclaim an Ancient Name}}</ref>
