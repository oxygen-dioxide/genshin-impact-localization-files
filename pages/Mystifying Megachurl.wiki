===Day 1===
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Summon Sunsettias
|desc_1 = Raises its staff and summons 5 sunsettias that fall from the sky, each dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on impact. It then proceeds to perform one of two possible attacks:<ul><!--
--><li>'''Spin:''' Performs continuous spinning attacks with its staff while moving towards the player, dealing '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} with each spin.</li><!--
--><li>'''Pogo Stick''' Uses its staff to jump up and stab down at the player's location for a total of 8 times, dealing '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on each impact.</li><!--
--></ul>The summoned sunsettias will burst when hit by a [[Normal Attack]] or [[Charged Attack]] and turn into sunsettia juice. If the player steps on sunsettia juice, they will be inflicted with {{Hydro}} application. If the Mystifying Megachurl steps on sunsettia juice, it will slip and fall, losing a percentage of its Max [[HP]] and becoming paralyzed for 10 seconds, during which its [[RES]] will be reduced.<br><!--
-->The percentage of HP lost starts at '''18%''' and increases by '''2%''' every time it has been paralyzed.

===Day 2===
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Rumble
|desc_1 = Raises its staff, gains a shield, causes 3 3×3 areas of the floor to cave in, and continuously summons sunsettias and fish that fall from the sky, each dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on impact. <ul><!--
--><li>The falling fish will cause a 3×3 area of the floor to cave in where they land.</li><!--
--><li>The cabbages will be launched towards the Mystifying Megachurl when hit by a [[Normal Attack]] or [[Charged Attack]]. The first shield requires 2 cabbages to destroy, and all subsequent shields will require 3.</li><!--
--><li>Random summoned cabbages will be golden. Golden cabbages deal '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on impact and immediately break the Mystifying Megachurl's shield when launched towards it.</li><!--
--><li>When the Mystifying Megachurl's shield is broken, this attack will be interrupted, and it will lose a percentage of its Max [[HP]] and become paralyzed for 10 seconds, during which its [[RES]] will be reduced.<ul><li>The percentage of HP lost starts at '''18%''' and increases by '''2%''' every time it has been paralyzed.</li></ul></li><!--

{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Enhanced Pogo Stick
|desc_1 = Raises its staff and summons wind currents across the entire arena, granting players increased jumping height. It then gains a shield and performs 5 slow jumps towards the player's location in succession on its staff, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} over a large area every time it lands.<ul><!--
--><li>During this attack, when a player character successfully executes a Plunging Attack, they will deal additional {{Color|Physical DMG}} equal to '''10%''' of their ATK in a '''8m''' radius.</li><!--
--><li>The additional DMG scales with the character's stats, including [[CRIT]], [[DMG Bonus]], etc., but does not count as Plunging Attack DMG.</li><!--
--><li>This additional DMG will also reduce the Mystifying Megachurl's shield durability by '''34%'''.</li></ul>
