{{Description|[[Collei]] reveals a dark truth, and [[Amber]] makes the decision to save her.  Will the [[Knights of Favonius|knights]] be able to help Collei rewrite her destiny?}}
'''Unshrouded Resolution''' is Chapter 12 of the ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' [[manga]].

==Summary==
After returning to a safe place, Collei reveals to Amber that she is the culprit responsible for the black fire incident. Instead of pushing her away, Amber tells Colllei that she's happy she met her and asks why would a bad person ask to be killed. Collei is unable to answer.

The girls return to the [[Knights of Favonius Headquarters]] to meet [[Lisa]] but find a [[Cyno|hooded figure]] instead. He reveals himself to be the person from [[Sumeru Akademiya]] that Lisa solicited help from to cure Collei's disease. The man explains that it cannot be cured, but can be sealed away into a dormant state. Collei agrees and they plan to meet the next morning at [[Starsnatch Cliff]] for the process.

Meanwhile, [[Kaeya]] visits [[Diluc]] at [[Angel's Share]], informing him that the [[Fatui]] may be the real culprits behind the black fire incident in hopes of repeating the same event involving [[Crepus]]' death to play hero again. They both plan to return the favor.
