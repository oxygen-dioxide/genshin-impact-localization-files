The {{Lang|'''Guili Assembly'''|zh=归离集|zh_rm=Guīlí-jí}} was an ancient civilization in the region of [[Liyue]] that was established and ruled by the God of Dust [[Guizhong]] and the God of Geo [[Morax]] (Rex Lapis),<ref name="STC1">{{Ref/Book|Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I}}</ref> and supported by other gods such as the God of the Stove [[Marchosius]]<ref name="MoonMerry2">{{Ref/Quest|Three to Get Ready, and Here We Go}}</ref> and by the [[adepti]]. At its height, it was a prosperous and flourishing civilization that possessed highly advanced engineering skills.

During a particular battle of the [[Archon War]], Guizhong was slain, the Guili Assembly was destroyed, and its people were scattered. Morax eventually regathered his people and established [[Liyue Harbor]] 3,700 years ago, which has remained standing to this day.<ref name="STC1" />

==Etymology==
The name "Guili" is derived from the first character in Guizhong's name ({{zh|'''归'''终}}), and the second character in Morax's name at the time.<ref name="STC1" /> The name he went by is unknown, but he currently goes by the name [[Zhongli]], which contains the same character ({{zh|钟'''离'''}}).

==History==
===Origin===
Little is known about the Guili Assembly before the Archon War, but it seems to have its origins with the foundation of Liyue itself. When Morax first descended, much of western Liyue was submerged underwater and its people were at the mercy of sea monsters such as Baqiu.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Primordial Jade Winged-Spear}}</ref> He lowered the tides, raised [[Mt. Tianheng]], and subdued the sea monsters. After peace settled upon the land, people began mining from the mountains he raised and used the stones they mined to create settlements.<ref name="STC1" />

At some point in time, Morax became allies with fellow [[gods]] Guizhong and Marchosius. Guizhong and the [[adepti]], [[Cloud Retainer]] among them, built the [[Guizhong Ballista]] on Mt. Tianheng. For reasons unknown, Guizhong and her people then moved north of the mountain and joined Morax's settlement. Her people took up agriculture and farming as their livelihood, and farming towns appeared all throughout the area.<ref name="STC1" />

===Archon War===
3700 years ago, the Guili Assembly was destroyed as another casualty of the [[Archon War]]. During the conflict, [[Guizhong]] was slain. Following the battle came a great flood that devastated the area, forcing its inhabitants to move south of Mt. Tianheng, where [[Liyue Harbor]] was established.<ref name="STC1" /><ref name="MoonMerry2" />

==Geography==
The Guili Assembly was centralized in the area now known as [[Guili Plains]]. At its height, it was said to have spread a thousand miles around, with [[Stone Gate]] as its northern boundary.<ref name="STC1" /> Through in-game measurements, assuming its territory was a circle with Guili Plains as its epicenter, it can be deduced that its western boundary was the edge of [[Jueyun Karst]], its southern boundary was the area that is now the entrance to Liyue Harbor, and its eastern boundary was the end of [[Mingyun Village]].
