{{Quest Description|[[Draff]] is angry at the pigeons he keeps...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Draff)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Regarding these pigeons...
:'''Draff:''' They'd be more use to me roasted with a few wild mushrooms...
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
:'''Draff:''' I raised them as carrier pigeons, to deliver messages.
:'''Draff:''' But for some reason they are getting less and less reliable.
:'''Draff:''' Either they lose the message or they glide around for hours but never actually deliver it. Or, they sit around the whole time just waiting for someone to chase them off.
:'''Draff:''' If you have time, maybe you could hurry along the pigeons I just released.
:{{DIcon}} Got it.
::'''Draff:''' Great. So if you see any of them slacking off, chase them away for me.
:{{DIcon}} I seek not the enmity of pigeons.
::'''Draff:''' Don't worry, it's not like pigeons to hold a grudge. Their memory is much too short for that.
::'''Draff:''' I never had you down as such a pigeon lover...

;(Talk to Draff again)
:'''Draff:''' These pigeons are getting plumper by the day... What is [[Allan]] feeding them?

===Normal Version===
;(Look for the pigeons in the woods)
:'''Paimon:''' These pigeons are such lazy slackers. Hurry them along, they need to learn to be good little pigeons and deliver those messages!
:''<small>(If you scare them all off)</small>''
::'''Paimon:''' There! I doubt they'll be planning on slacking off again anytime soon...
::'''Paimon:''' Let's go and update Draff.
:''<small>(If you kill any)</small>''
::'''Paimon:''' Yikes! What are you doing that for!? Draff will flip a lid!
::'''Paimon:''' How are we going to face Draff now...
----
;(Return to Draff)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Regarding these pigeons...
:''<small>(If you scared them off)</small>''
::'''Draff:''' Maybe now they'll deliver their messages without a fuss in future...
::'''Draff:''' But I can't exactly follow them and check... Anyway, that'll do for now.
::'''Draff:''' For your trouble, please take this. And if you ever need to send a message, just come and find me.
::;(Commission ends)
:''<small>(If you killed the pigeons)</small>''
::'''Draff:''' You did WHAT? How could you!? They were my carrier pigeons!!
::'''Draff:''' You churlish cretin... hilichurlish, even! What am I going to do about all these letters!?
::{{DIcon}} Sowwie...
:::'''Draff:''' Is that the best you can do? A Knight of Flaming Favonius and the best you can offer is a half-hearted apology!?
::{{DIcon}} Sometimes I don't know my own strength...
:::'''Draff:''' It helps if you don't chase them off with a flaming meat cleaver!
::'''Draff:''' You've really fluffed up here, and now you have to make it right. Since you're so bird-brained anyway, I trust you will have no problem being my new carrier pigeon!
:;(Obtain [[Sara's Letter]] ×1)
----
;(Deliver the letter to Sara)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Chirp chirp, I have a letter for you.
:'''Sara:''' Oh! I never expected you to be the one delivering this!
:'''Sara:''' I thought it would be a carrier pigeon, like usual.
:'''Sara:''' But as long as it's delivered I'm happy. Thanks!
----
;(Return to Draff)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Regarding these pigeons...
:'''Draff:''' Goodness... The devil makes work for idle hands, eh.
:'''Draff:''' Alright, well never mind. I'll let you off this once. Off you go now.

===Hilichurl Version===
;(Look for the pigeons in the woods)
:'''Paimon:''' Dun-dun-dun! The pigeons are gone! Paimon swears they were here just a second ago...
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe they've flown off to somewhere nearby to keep slacking off. Let's look around.
;(Further ahead)
:'''Paimon:''' Look at these hilichurls, they're gathered round a cooking pot and there's a bit pile of meat by the side...
:'''Paimon:''' ...The pigeons! Nooo! The hilichurls are eating the carrier pigeons... They might be carrying messages too!
:'''Paimon:''' Destroy them! And get those messages back.
;(Upon picking up [[Draff's Letter]])
:'''Paimon:''' Eh, what's this? ...A message?
:'''Paimon:''' Shoot, one of the pigeons must have dropped it on the way...
:'''Paimon:''' (Traveler), see who the sender is. Maybe we can sort this out.
----
;(Return to Draff)
:'''Draff:''' The hilichurls have an insatiable appetite for avian messengers? Are you serious...
;(If [[Draff's Letter]] was picked up)
:{{DIcon}} Is this letter yours?
::'''Draff:''' A letter? Ah yes, I sent this! It was supposed to go to Sister Grace, in the city.
::'''Draff:''' You didn't read it, did you? Not that it matters anyway, it's all stuff that happened years ago.
::'''Draff:''' With some things, you can't leave them in the dark forever...
::'''Draff:''' Thank you for bringing it all this way, I'll run it down to the city myself some time. Here's a small reward for finding it...
::'''Draff:''' Timmie, hey Timmie...
;(If [[Draff's Letter]] was not picked up)
:'''Draff:''' Well, I suppose they are getting plump, and would probably make a great pairing with a glass of jagerschnapps...
:'''Draff:''' ...I mean, uh... Oh drats, now I have to raise a whole new flock of pigeons.
