|description    = A grand and stylish gate, upon which is carved patterns most intricate. It has the same design as the great metal gate in the [[Astral Garden]].<br>It is said that every new resident of [[Simulanka]] will travel to the [[Forest of Blessings]] to give thanks to the [[Goddess of Creation]] for casting them, and to [[Constellation Metropole]] to pray to the [[Goddess of Prophecy]] for an oracle. This great gate happens to be behind the statue of the Goddess of Prophecy, and for this reason, it is no mere great gilded gate. Rather, it is a manifestation of the grace of said Goddess, and thus is reverently called the Window to Prophecy.
