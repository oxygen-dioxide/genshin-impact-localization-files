;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Sido at Chatrakam Cave, optional)
:{{A|Vo dialog eqpm001 sido 01.ogg}} '''Sido:''' (With the Traveler around, I don't think there will be any major issues. Mahamatra Cyno will be able to move all the more quickly with his investigation.)

;(Talk to Sido at Chatrakam Cave, optional)<!--unvoiced-->
:'''Sido:''' Hmm? What are you two doing here? You must have a lot of free time on your hands to come all the way out here...
:'''Sido:''' Seems like the competition is just a piece of cake for you two! You guys are spectacular!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Have we met before? Paimon must've forgotten...
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here...?
::'''Sido:''' I'm here on a mission. I'm sorry, but that's all I'm able to disclose.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Sido:''' Do your best in the competition. I have faith in you.

;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo eqpm004 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's time for the quarterfinals. Our opponent is definitely gonna be a tough one this time!
:{{A|vo eqpm004 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's showtime, Bongo-Head! Let's smash our way through to the semifinals!
----
;(Approach the arena)
:{{A|vo eqpm004 2 ferreaferro 01.ogg}} '''Hardy Two-Blades:''' It's you. The uncultured swine of the Nilotpala Cup.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, you potty mouth! What's your problem?
:{{A|vo eqpm004 2 ferreaferro 02.ogg}} '''Hardy Two-Blades:''' The way you dote on your Fungi. It's pathetic. What a joke! You make a mockery of the philosophy of the greatest beast-tamer of all, the mighty Haniyyah.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Greatest beast-tamer of all"? That's debatable.
:{{DIcon}} We'll set her "philosophy" straight.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 2 ferreaferro 03.ogg}} '''Hardy Two-Blades:''' You keep telling yourself that! You were never gonna come close to facing Haniyyah. Time for you to go home!

;(During the fight)
;(Once player uses Bongo-Head's Water Bomb)
:{{A|vo eqpm006 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's finish this with a Waterballoon Meteor Strike!

;(Once Hardy Two-Blades uses Rocksteady's Rocks Fall)
:{{A|vo eqpm004 2 ferreaferro 05.ogg}} '''Hardy Two-Blades:''' Storm their frontline and take them down!

;(Once Bongo-Head has low health)
:{{A|vo eqpm006 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no... Bongo-Head, are you okay?

;(Once Rocksteady has low health)
:{{A|vo eqpm004 2 ferreaferro 04.ogg}} '''Hardy Two-Blades:''' Hey! No backing down! We fight to the end!

;(After defeating Hardy Two-Blades)
:{{A|vo eqpm004 3 ferreaferro 01.ogg}} '''Hardy Two-Blades:''' Nooo! This can't be happening... I trained my Fungi non-stop... Maybe I should have been harder on them?
:{{A|vo eqpm004 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew. Well, we beat him... but somehow Paimon isn't really in the mood to celebrate.
----
;(Leave the arena)
:{{A|vo eqpm004 4 layla 01.ogg}} '''Layla:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon. I made it through!
:{{A|vo eqpm004 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's amazing, Layla! You've reached your goal!
:{{DIcon}} Congratulations!
:{{A|vo eqpm004 4 layla 02.ogg}} '''Layla:''' I heard you won against the unstoppable Hardy Two-Blades... But you don't seem too happy about it. How come?
:{{A|vo eqpm004 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's just that... He was really mean. He said some weird things...
:{{Black Screen|You tell Layla the details of the match...}}
:{{A|vo eqpm004 4 layla 03.ogg}} '''Layla:''' I see what you mean... Yeah, somehow beast-tamers like him make me feel a little... sad.
:{{DIcon}} Sad?
:{{A|vo eqpm004 4 layla 04.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Yeah. He clearly doesn't know anything about Haniyyah. He's just making assumptions about what she's like based on a vague impression, and even trying to copy her. I'm sure Haniyyah would feel uneasy about it too, if she knew.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 4 layla 05.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Also, he's so cruel to his shroom buddies, when they could have been friends... It's not just his loss, either. It brings all the other contestants down.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right! You have the right mindset, Layla! If only everyone was like you, this whole tournament would feel a lot less gloomy!
:{{A|vo eqpm004 4 layla 06.ogg}} '''Layla:''' But it's only because I'm not aiming as high... I just wanna be able to take Twirly-Whirly back to live with me, that's all.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 4 layla 07.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Looks like the next fight is you against me. Let's just try to enjoy ourselves. It doesn't matter who wins, this is just a little contest between friends.
:{{DIcon}} You have a deal!
:{{A|vo eqpm004 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright! Time to see who's the strongest Fungi, Twirly-Whirly or Bongo-Head! Loser buys dinner for the winner!
:{{A|vo eqpm004 4 yaemiko 01.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Whatever deal this is, you seem very happy about it. Did I miss anything big while I was gone?
:{{A|vo eqpm004 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Miko, you're back &mdash; finally! You snuck off without saying anything last time, so we didn't get to tell you about the evidence we&mdash; Ahem! Uh, evidently we have some things to discuss with you...!
:{{A|vo eqpm004 4 yaemiko 02.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Yes, well, it's been quite the ordeal for me, too. I only entered this tournament for a bit of fun, but now I've ended up in the semifinals. I've barely had any time at all to spend with Souka and the others gathering source material for the novel.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 4 yaemiko 03.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' I'm sure you two will have a wonderful time in your fun-and-friendly match. I, on the other hand, have to take mine a little more seriously. I'm up against that stubborn young lady, after all.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 4 layla 08.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Yeah, who knew it'd get to this point... Miss Yae has to face off against Haniyyah...
:{{A|vo eqpm004 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look on the bright side! Maybe Miko will help us defeat Haniyyah!
:{{A|vo eqpm004 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But that means we won't get to show Haniyyah the error of her ways ourselves... Whatever, Paimon just doesn't want to see Miko lose!
----
;(Approach the arena)
:{{A|vo eqpm004 5 layla 01.ogg}} '''Layla:''' I'm feeling nervous, but excited at the same time!
:{{A|vo eqpm004 5 layla 02.ogg}} '''Layla:''' You don't have to go easy on me. Twirly-Whirly and team have weathered plenty of tough challenges already, and they know how to put up a good fight! So you and your shroom buddies can give it your all!
:{{A|vo eqpm004 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well then, prepare for battle, Layla and Twirly!

;(During the fight)
;(Once player uses Bongo-Head's Water Bomb)
:{{A|vo eqpm004 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Use your Happy-Clappy Waterballoons, Bongo-Head! Gently, of course!

;(Once Layla uses Twirly-Whirly's Vortex of Blades)
:{{A|vo eqpm004 5 layla 04.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Twirly, quick! Do the thing... the Wind Vortex!

;(Once Bongo-Head has low health)
:{{A|Vo eqpm004 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Layla and Twirly-Whirly are like a well-oiled machine... We gotta step up our game!

;(Once Twirly-Whirly has low health)
:{{A|vo eqpm004 5 layla 03.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Hang in there, Twirly! You can still do this!

;(After defeating Layla)
:{{A|vo eqpm004 6 layla 01.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Oh shoot, we lost...
:{{A|vo eqpm004 6 layla 02.ogg}} '''Layla:''' But you and the gang put on the best show I've seen so far, Twirly-Whirly! That was a real blast, I loved it!
:{{A|vo eqpm004 6 layla 03.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Thank you all! Twirly-Whirly and I went out with a bang. Any other opponent, and we might be feeling a little disappointed right now... but we were definitely beaten by the best.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You did really well too, y'know! Felt like we were one wrong move away from a very mushy Bongo!
:{{A|vo eqpm004 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just letting the Fungi do their thing and enjoying the match with no pressure to win... It was a good feeling.
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps this is how all competitions should be...
:{{A|vo eqpm004 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If only every match could be as carefree as that... Meanwhile, Miko's busy duking it out with Haniyyah. Paimon's so nervous for her! Let's go see how she's doing!
----
;(Leave the arena)
:;(The group approaches Haniyyah and Yae Miko facing each other with their Ace Fungi by their side)
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh...? It's over already? And why's the atmosphere so heavy... Does this mean Miko won!?
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 yaemiko 01.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Your match is over too? You took your time. I'm assuming it was a close call...
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You sound way too relaxed for someone who's just fought in the semifinals. Bet it was a walk in the park, huh?
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 yaemiko 02.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Ahaha, yes, ours was as far from a close call as you could get. All it took was a few short, sharp strikes for Blitzara and I...
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 yaemiko 03.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' ...to be beaten by Haniyyah.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 haniyyah 01.ogg}} '''Haniyyah:''' ...What, you think this is funny? Am I a joke to you?
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 yaemiko 04.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Hehe, far from it, Haniyyah. I know full well how serious you are about all this from your iron-clad determination to annihilate an entire species... How would I ever dare mock you?
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 yaemiko 05.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' That said, if you continue down this path and find that it leads somewhere quite different from what you had hoped... what will become of that iron-clad determination then? I look forward to finding out.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 haniyyah 02.ogg}} '''Haniyyah:''' That's... not your concern.
:;(Haniyyah walks away)
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 yaemiko 06.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Running away so soon?
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 layla 01.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Miss Yae lost the match, but why is Haniyyah the one who seemed upset...
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 yaemiko 07.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' The situation gets more interesting with each development... Blitzara injured Pyro-1 soon after the match started, and Haniyyah was clearly quite distressed.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 yaemiko 08.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' I simply pointed out that she's still deceiving herself, and her defenses began breaking down. She's more fragile than I'd imagined.
:{{DIcon}} Deceiving herself?
:{{DIcon}} Defenses?
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You mean, Haniyyah isn't as heartless as she tries to make herself out to be? So she does care about Pyro-1... but she didn't mean to show it in front of you...
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 yaemiko 09.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Right answer. Now's our chance to get through to her. You, my little friends, are the only ones who can get her back onto the right path.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But Haniyyah's long gone now. Where should we look for her?
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 yaemiko 10.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Well, right now, I'm sure she must be wondering what it is that has made her suddenly start doubting herself after all this time.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 yaemiko 11.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' The answer lies with the three of you. I'm sure you all know where she's gone to.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, Layla, and me?
:{{DIcon}} Wait, you mean...?
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 layla 02.ogg}} '''Layla:''' The place where I first met {{Traveler}} and Paimon?
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good point... it was when Layla mentioned her plan to bring her shroom buddies back home with her that Haniyyah's mood suddenly changed... Layla, it seems like you're on to something!
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's catch up with Haniyyah and set things straight!
:;(Paimon begins to leave)
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 yaemiko 12.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' You should stay here, Little Layla. I understand that you want to help Haniyyah, but she's not the kind of person you're good at dealing with. Leave it to them this time.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 layla 03.ogg}} '''Layla:''' That's true... And if I said something that struck a nerve again, I'd only make things worse. Plus, you guys move pretty fast... If I tag along, I'd probably need to stop and gather my strength every 10 minutes...
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 yaemiko 13.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Well, what are you waiting for, little one?
:{{DIcon}} This is everything we've dug up so far.
:{{DIcon}} Please take a look and see what you think.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 yaemiko 14.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Oh? My, you've been busier than I thought.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 7 yaemiko 15.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' In return, I give you a blessing from me: Good luck. I'll share my thoughts the next time we meet.

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Elchingen at Chatrakam Cave, optional)
:{{A|Vo dialog eqpm004 elchingen 07.ogg}} '''Elchingen:''' (What a pleasant surprise... If Master knew this, I'm sure he would treat me differently.)

;(Talk to Elchingen at Chatrakam Cave, optional)
:{{A|Vo dialog eqpm004 elchingen 01.ogg}} '''Elchingen:''' Hmm? Ah, hello you two.
:{{A|Vo dialog eqpm004 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Elchingen! Fancy meeting you here!
:{{A|Vo dialog eqpm004 elchingen 02.ogg}} '''Elchingen:''' Congratulations on advancing to the finals. Your duel with Haniyyah and the Ultimate Trial will no doubt be the highlight of this tournament.
:{{A|Vo dialog eqpm004 elchingen 03.ogg}} '''Elchingen:''' Practicing aside, taking a walk is a good way to prepare yourself for the final. It keeps your mind clear and your spirits up.
:{{DIcon}} What are you up to?
:{{DIcon}} All on your own here, I see...
:{{A|Vo dialog eqpm004 elchingen 04.ogg}} '''Elchingen:''' I just wanted to find a quiet spot to reflect on what I have learned... what you have shown me.
:{{A|Vo dialog eqpm004 elchingen 05.ogg}} '''Elchingen:''' I am now, more than ever, convinced that the relationship between master and servant improves dramatically when the servant is well-behaved...
:{{A|Vo dialog eqpm004 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Master? Servant? What does that have to do with us?
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you in peace, then.
:{{DIcon}} We'll talk next time.
:{{A|Vo dialog eqpm004 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Oh, uh... Yeah! We have something super important to tell you next time we meet!
:{{A|Vo dialog eqpm004 elchingen 06.ogg}} '''Elchingen:''' Very well. I shall patiently look forward to it. Best of luck with your preparations.

;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo eqpm004 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Haniyyah should be around here somewhere...
:{{A|vo eqpm004 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Pyro-1 follows her everywhere. We should be able to track her down through its elemental traces!
:{{A|vo eqpm004 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Search the area with Elemental Sight!

;(Follow the elemental tracks)
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 haniyyah 01.ogg}} '''Haniyyah:''' Huh? How did you find me here...
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We followed Pyro-1's tracks. We're a little worried about you...
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait a second... Are you comforting Pyro-1!?
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 haniyyah 02.ogg}} '''Haniyyah:''' "The irony," I know... and I'd probably be enjoying it, if Pyro-1 were any other animal than a Fungi.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 haniyyah 03.ogg}} '''Haniyyah:''' The next time we meet will be in the finals. Whatever you have to say, save it for if you beat me...
:{{DIcon}} We want to understand where you're coming from.
:{{DIcon}} We want to help you see the Fungi differently.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 haniyyah 04.ogg}} '''Haniyyah:''' The fox lady said you might say that... You're pure of heart, kind, and believe the best in things.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 haniyyah 05.ogg}} '''Haniyyah:''' You wouldn't understand if I tried to explain, so here &mdash; read this.

::Merchant Log, Expedition No. 39
::Day 10 of the Fungi Invasion:
::...
::Thankfully, we came across a group of farmers in the nearby area. They seem to have been trapped here by the aggressive Fungi too, and have set up a temporary camp.
::The kind farmers brought sufficient provisions and medicinal herbs, and almost saved us all.
::But there were still several people who did not make it...
::The Fungi surrounding this area are increasing in number, and they're still in that berserk state.
::We can't leave just yet, at least not before the Fungi are gone... if they ever leave.
::It looks like we'll be staying here for a good while.
::...<br><br>
::Merchant Log, Expedition No. 39
::Day 42 of the Fungi Invasion:
::...
::I never thought that I'd become trapped by a bunch of Fungi for so long. I still can't see any hope of getting away from this place.
::Rabib took his axe and made an attempt to go fight the Fungi, but he was stopped by the other farmers. Everyone knows that none of us are going to last long without the leader of the farmers around...
::But if the circumstances are enough to make the calmest and most composed farmer lose his cool, I can only imagine what the others feel. Everyone must be feeling pretty frustrated by now.
::The Zaytun Peaches we picked from nearby areas and the remaining provisions are going to last a few more weeks.
::Following the farmers' suggestions, we have started looking for suitable seeds to grow our own food.
::And the camp needs an expansion. We have to make plans for the long term &mdash; we might eventually have to turn this place into a small village.
::A village full of Fungi victims? How absurd...
::Hopefully, we'll manage to keep ourselves from starving to death before the crops mature.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 haniyyah 06.ogg}} '''Haniyyah:''' These are my ancestors' records. They were attacked by a horde of Fungi in the rainforest, and many people were seriously injured.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 haniyyah 07.ogg}} '''Haniyyah:''' There was nothing exceptional about this incident at the time, and it certainly never made it into any official records. But my family have been reading it to me since I was a child, constantly warning me of the grave threat that Fungi pose to us.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's what happened... No wonder you're so hostile towards Fungi.
:{{DIcon}} We're sorry about your past.
:{{DIcon}} But things are different now.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! And anyway, doesn't your family's experience make this tournament all the more meaningful? The Wisdom Orb finally means that humans and Fungi can live in peace together...
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 haniyyah 08.ogg}} '''Haniyyah:''' It's not as simple as turning bad Fungi into nice Fungi with the Wisdom Orb. Plenty of scholars have experimented with similar things in my village in the past.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 haniyyah 09.ogg}} '''Haniyyah:''' But every one of them failed, gave up, and moved on. Even this new Wisdom Orb can only suppress the Fungi's aggressive nature temporarily. Without this device, they're still extremely dangerous creatures.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 haniyyah 10.ogg}} '''Haniyyah:''' On top of that, the Orb's Intellectual Boost makes the Fungi unnaturally strong. Too much elemental energy in one place is not a good idea, especially for people in poor shape already. If you've got a sensitive constitution and you start using a Wisdom Orb, you're gonna start experiencing symptoms pretty quickly.
:{{DIcon}} Unnaturally strong...?
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, Layla's been coughing a lot lately... Could that be because of the Wisdom Orb?
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 haniyyah 11.ogg}} '''Haniyyah:''' As you'll be well aware by now, all Kautilya cares about is his precious research. He just wants to expand his influence and increase the profile of the beast-tamer event.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 haniyyah 12.ogg}} '''Haniyyah:''' Meanwhile, Elchingen's taking advantage of the situation. Impressed by Kautilya's research, he invested a huge sum into promoting the tournament, consequently lowering everyone's guard against the Fungi...
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 haniyyah 13.ogg}} '''Haniyyah:''' I don't trust either of them, period. I don't believe highly aggressive creatures like the Fungi can co-exist with humans. But I'm just another retired mercenary, so who's gonna listen to me?
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 haniyyah 14.ogg}} '''Haniyyah:''' All I can do is play by their rules until victory is mine. Then I'll fight for the outcome I'm hoping for, and keep them from getting their way.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 haniyyah 15.ogg}} '''Haniyyah:''' I initially had a sliver of hope that you might help me in my endeavors... guess that was pretty naive of me. But it doesn't matter what you think about all this, or what you think of me. I'm going to beat you, and then there will be nothing you can do to stop me.
:{{DIcon}} Haniyyah!
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 haniyyah 16.ogg}} '''Haniyyah:''' This notebook is just a relic from my past now. Do whatever you want with it, because come the day of the final, I'm going to declare the execution of all Fungi... including Pyro-1.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 9 haniyyah 17.ogg}} '''Haniyyah:''' It's time to say goodbye to the past.
:;(Haniyyah leaves)<!-- black screen transition -->
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That didn't go as planned... Well, there's only one option left: we gotta defeat Haniyyah in the final match.
:{{DIcon}} At least we got to know how she really feels.
:{{DIcon}} At least we got her notebook.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Didn't Haniyyah mention something about other researchers in the past trying to stop the damage caused by Fungi, too? There should be more information in this notebook. Let's take a look.

::Merchant Log, Expedition No. 39
::Day 7 of the Investigation:
::...
::The researchers seem to be planning to use some kind of capturing device to control the aggressive Fungi.
::The codename of the device is... a string of complicated terminology. They've also included a license of approval from the Akademiya...
::In addition, they're preparing something called the Withering Potion to suppress the Fungi's activity, making them easier to control.
::The Withering Potion also came with complex notes and official approval from the Akademiya.
::Anyway, I'll record the information down for now.

::We failed again. When we returned to the village, two seriously wounded mercenaries insisted on quitting.
::Before going to bed, I heard the lead researcher arguing with a few subordinates.
::One of them tried to convince the lead researcher to give up on the Withering Potion, saying that they have gotten its function wrong from the very beginning. The outcome contradicted their expectations, and it could very well lead to their deaths.
::Another subordinate was yelling curses at an unfamiliar person. Judging from the details of their argument, it seems like someone has made a grave mistake.
::They're here to settle this mess, but upon witnessing the state of things, they start planning to drop everything and run.
::Something doesn't feel right, but I still need more evidence to make sure...
::...
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' These look like... research notes. Guess Haniyyah's ancestors kept them after the scholars left...
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew... This section looks super complicated. The handwriting is really bad, and there are too many technical terms... Paimon can't make heads or tails of this.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, some of these look familiar though... Oh, that's right, we saw them on the documents Dori gave us!
:{{DIcon}} So the notes and the documents are connected.
:{{DIcon}} Let's try putting everything together.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright! Let's put them side by side, go through carefully, and try to figure out what's written in these notes.
::{{Black Screen|Derived Contents}}
::Contents compiled after combining the clues:
::(The device remnants and the remains of the files that Dori gave you contain the same license of approval as the device recorded in the notes has. Evidently, these devices were considered technologically identical by the Akademiya.)
::(Similarly, the formula for floral jelly shares many basic ingredients and medicinal principles with the Withering Potion from the notes. The only difference is that the amount of certain active ingredients applied in the Floral Jelly is much lower than that of the Withering Potion. Also, protective ingredients and so-called stabilizers were added to the Floral Jelly.)
::(At this point, it can be roughly deduced that the remnants of the instrument that the organizer of the Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament attempted to destroy utilized the technological outcomes of the capturing device.)
::(And the Floral Jelly can be deemed as an upgrade of the Withering Potion with enhanced safety that can trigger a temporary boost to the activity of Fungi and let them gain some special powers while being activated.)
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A capturing device? And a Withering Potion?
:{{DIcon}} The device used to capture the Fungi made them calm and approachable.
:{{DIcon}} But the Withering Potion made them go berserk.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's how it went down... The Fungi only attacked Haniyyah's ancestors because of what that potion did to them... And then the researchers built that device to try and capture the angry Fungi.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Also, if Floral Jelly is just an improved version of the Withering Potion, and the Wisdom Orb isn't Kautilya's invention either...
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...He's basically giving someone else's inventions a new name and passing them off as his own. He's a big fat liar!
:{{DIcon}} A big fat liar indeed!
:{{DIcon}} Although, I can't say I'm that surprised.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why is Kautilya so eager to get people to use the Wisdom Orb, anyway?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe he wants to finish the work started by scholars that went before him...
:{{DIcon}} ...But more likely, he just wants to take credit for other people's work.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've gotta warn Elchingen. He needs to stop bankrolling Kautilya right away!
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' As for Haniyyah... She has no idea that the Fungi only attacked her ancestors because they were under the potion's influence. No wonder she holds it against them...
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't worry, Bongo-Head. Paimon knows you're not gonna turn evil because of some Floral Jelly. You stayed a very good Fungus, even after we turned off the Wisdom Orb!
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, you can understand what Paimon's saying? Oh wow! You're getting smarter!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, wait...
:{{DIcon}} The Wisdom Orb isn't active.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Since when!? Paimon didn't even notice...
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Does that mean... Bongo-Head is hanging out with us by choice right now?
:{{DIcon}} It's had a good experience with us so far.
:{{DIcon}} We've gained a mutual understanding.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' See, see! Haniyyah was wrong after all, the Fungi aren't gonna lose control this time. Some Fungi understand people and just wanna get along, like Bongo-Head here!
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Haniyyah did make one good point, though: The Wisdom Orb has its limits. As long as that's the case, Fungi won't be able to live with humans forever.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aww... Paimon was really hoping Bongo-Head could join us for the rest of our journey... Isn't there a way?
:{{DIcon}} Let's keep a safe distance from them now...
:{{DIcon}} Let's look for ways to improve the Wisdom Orb...
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah... It's a shame, but it seems like there's no other choice.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We still have some time before the final. Should we report Kautilya to the Akademiya?
:{{DIcon}} We don't know what he's capable of.
:{{DIcon}} We also don't want to let him know we're onto him.
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' True... For him to have made it this far, he must've been planning for a long time. If he caught wind of our plans to expose him, he'd definitely be wary of us!
:{{A|vo eqpm004 10 paimon 24.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whatever else happens, we have to give it our all on the day of the final. Let's beat Haniyyah, and knock some sense into her. Then, we should get Elchingen to help us expose Kautilya for the fraud he is!
