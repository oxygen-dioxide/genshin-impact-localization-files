| [[File:Tutorial Hyakunin Ikki 1.png|200px]]
| The Hyakunin Ikki follows special combat rules. Characters must be divided into {{Color|help|6 teams}}, and each team can have a maximum of 2 characters and 2 Garyuu Arts. Additionally, you can not only switch characters during this challenge, but also switch teams. Switching teams will {{Color|help|cycle through teams in order of when they were formed}}.
|-
| [[File:Tutorial Hyakunin Ikki 2.png|200px]]
| Every 10s, you can use the Relay skill to {{Color|help|switch to the next team}}. If one team {{Color|help|stays on the field for too long, their combat ability will decrease drastically.}} Switching teams will clear most of the effects that the previous team left behind. Moreover, {{Color|help|if all members of any one team fall, the challenge will fail}}.
|-
| [[File:Tutorial Hyakunin Ikki 3.png|200px]]
| {{Color|help|When you switch teams and defeat opponents}}, you will accumulate Fervor. When Fervor builds up to a specific extent, you will increase the level of your Ferocious Fervor, which will {{Color|help|provide bonuses in battle}}. But if you fail to perform spectacularly in combat and continuously build up Fervor, the Ferocious Fervor you have obtained will also dissipate...
|-
| [[File:Tutorial Hyakunin Ikki 4.png|200px]]
| During this challenge, you must {{Color|help|defeat opponents that constantly emerge to obtain points within the allotted time}}. Of those opponents, Nemeses will provide more points. Once the challenge ends, you will gain different insignias based on the number of points you gained.
