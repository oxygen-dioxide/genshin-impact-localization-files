'''Snowboar''' is a type of boar. It can be found both as [[Wildlife]] and as a pet in the [[Serenitea Pot]].

Snowboars, as the name suggests, lives in the snowy regions of the game and are usually entrapped in ice. Upon melting the ice, the boar seeks out to attack the player, afterwards will begin to flee. Unlike [[Forest Boar]]s however, they do not fade and will continue to flee from the player. The player can capture a Snowboar using the [[Omni-Ubiquity Net]] without melting the ice that it is trapped in.

In the Serenitea Pot, boars will not be startled when you approach them, but will scatter when you try to hit them. If they run too far from where they were placed or fall off the map, they will respawn at their original location.

Outdoor animals can only be placed in outdoor spaces within the [[Housing]] system.
