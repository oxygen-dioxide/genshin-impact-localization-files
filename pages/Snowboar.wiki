|description = A forest boar that makes its home in cold climates, with thicker fur than its warmer climate cousins.<br>According to scientists, although the cold, frosty conditions of its habitat required a stubborn ability to survive, it also provided an environment without any natural predators, allowing Snowboars to multiply in number unhindered. Legends say that Snowboars can live for an incredibly long time, even allowing it to grow abnormally large during such a long battle for survival.<br>People believed this species of boar to have gone extinct long ago, but as adventurers explore deeper into [[Dragonspine]], they seem to have made a new ecological discovery...

'''Snowboar''' is a type of [[Boar]] that can be found in the wild.

Snowboars live in the snowy regions of the game and are usually entrapped in ice. Upon melting the ice using {{Pyro}}, the boar attacks the player then begins to flee. Unlike [[Forest Boar]]s, they will not despawn while fleeing. Snowboars can be captured using the [[Omni-Ubiquity Net]] without melting the ice that they are trapped in.
