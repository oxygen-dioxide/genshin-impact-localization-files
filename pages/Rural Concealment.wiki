|description    = This [[Inazuma]]n village quite effectively recalls the scenery of [[Konda Village]]. These buildings are already of certain "age," but they are far from dilapidated. Instead, they give off a feeling of simple leisure. None of the buildings stand out in particular, and it even seems like they might all blend in with the nearby mountains in a few more years... These are, of course, all the hallmarks of an excellent hiding spot &mdash; and you can be sure that a certain lazy [[Shuumatsuban]] [[Sayu|ninja]] has done just that before, slacking off and sleeping somewhere in an equally sleepy village.
