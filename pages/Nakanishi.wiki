{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Nakanishi:''' Phew... Komore Teahouse is such a great place to drink tea. If only I had an old classical text on hand...
:{{DIcon}} About books from the past...
::'''Nakanishi:''' Youngster, are you also interested in old tomes as well? Not bad. Kids like you are rare.
::'''Nakanishi:''' You have to read the{{sic}} these old classics slowly. Nowadays...
::'''Nakanishi:''' Ah, I'm sorry. It's not that I disapprove of the younger generation. It's just the fact that [[Yae Publishing House]] has been focusing on Light Literature recently... I really can't accept that.
::'''Nakanishi:''' Pondering, thinking, and coming up with the right words are all part of the fun of literature.
::'''Nakanishi:''' Using simple and forgettable pleasures to win readers over... I don't think it's a good trend...
:{{DIcon}} About Komore Teahouse...
::'''Nakanishi:''' It's hard to find a classy tea house in Inazuma nowadays. Indeed, only when those who understand real culture gather together can we maintain the serenity of this place.
::'''Nakanishi:''' I heard from [[Kozue]] that you were invited by the [[Kamisato Clan]] to Komore Teahouse. If Kozue is around, you can feel free to relax here.
::{{DIcon}} About Kozue...
::'''Nakanishi:''' Many people have been taken in by Kozue's weak, girly appearance and have paid the price.
::'''Nakanishi:''' This girl is not just a talker. She can handle herself really well.
::'''Nakanishi:''' She is the offspring of the Kamisato Clan's retainers. Her swordsmanship is impeccable. Though, she's nowhere near as good as me, haha.
::'''Nakanishi:''' Anyway, with her skills, she is definitely qualified to be the gatekeeper of Komore Teahouse. Perhaps she's even overqualified...
:{{DIcon}} About [[Taroumaru]]...
::'''Nakanishi:''' Taroumaru is very cute, eh? He is an old friend of mine. Back in our [[Shuumatsuban]] days, we were both well-known hunks, hahaha...
::{{DIcon}} Shuumatsuban?
::'''Nakanishi:''' Haha, I would be remiss not to mention my grand history if we're going to be talking about that!
::'''Nakanishi:''' Back in the day, I was an instructor of the ninja village. No one dared to not greet me when they saw me. Taroumaru followed me around back then as well. We served the Kamisato Clan loyally together...
::'''Nakanishi:''' Now that both of us have retired, I'm not sure if they can still count on those young'uns... Hehe.
::'''Nakanishi:''' They're probably still expecting me to give them a score, I'll bet...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Nakanishi:''' Go on your way. Look for [[Taroumaru]] if you need anything from the tea house.
