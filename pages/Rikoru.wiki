{{Quote|Here lies Rikoru no Mikoto. He loved to build. He once built a small-scale [[Dainichi Mikoshi]]. It was six feet tall and immensely vivid.|The Royal Tomb of Rikoru}}
Rikoru was the first [[Sunchild]].<ref name="tokoyokoku">{{Ref/Book|The Serpent and Drakes of Tokoyokoku}}</ref> He originally admired [[Aberaku]], the creator of the Dainichi Mikoshi, to the point where he built a miniature version of the structure. However, when Aberaku began to oppose the regime of the Sunchild and the nobles who controlled him, the nobles deceived Rikoru into thinking that Aberaku wanted to kill him and seize the throne for himself,<ref name="hide and seek">{{Ref/HEO|Sunchildren Hide and Seek}}</ref> which Rikoru responded to by imprisoning Aberaku in the Dainichi Mikoshi for life.<ref name="tokoyokoku"/> Afterwards, Rikoru began to nurse a desire to build a structure even more impressive than the Dainichi Mikoshi to prove himself better than his former idol.<ref name="hide and seek"/>
