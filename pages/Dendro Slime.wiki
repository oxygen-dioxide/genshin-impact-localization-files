==Strategy==
*Dendro Slimes are usually found in grassy areas and can be particularly hard to spot, even with [[Elemental Sight]] as they are highlighted as {{Dendro}} entities like nearby grass. If battle music plays but no enemies can be visually seen, it is likely that a Dendro Slime has targeted the player.
*Unlike the other small slimes that attack on instinct, Dendro Slimes are much more timid and will only attack when the player's back is turned against them. The player must use extremely well-timed attacks on the slime when it takes a '''peek''' from the ground.
*When reacting to {{Pyro}}, the slime will be afflicted with [[Burning]] and jump out of the ground, running around wildly in the process. It will not attack while its top is burning, although it will eventually burn off and the slime will act like other smaller slimes in combat.
*The hold version of [[Jean]]'s [[Gale Blade]] can pull Dendro Slimes out of the ground.
