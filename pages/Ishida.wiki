==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After completing [[The Strange Tale of Suikou's Tipsy Tincture]])
:'''Ishida:''' As you've seen, I'm a writer of fan novels.
:'''Ishida:''' I'm decently well-known in fan work circles, and I was approached some time back by an editor from [[Yae Publishing House]], who asked if I was willing to try working on an original project.
:'''Ishida:''' I did try, of course, but I found that it's just... not that interesting, you know? I just love doing fan work more!
:'''Ishida:''' Of course, some readers did comment that I might just be afraid of change and progress, but to me, it's just that creating should be about happiness.
