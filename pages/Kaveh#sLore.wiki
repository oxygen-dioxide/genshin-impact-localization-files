==Personality==
<!--{{Quote|In-game text|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}-->
In stark contrast to [[Alhaitham]]'s rationality, Kaveh is led by emotion, and operates by what he feels to be right, first and foremost. He is described by characters such as [[Dori]] and [[Faruzan]] as being unique among [[Akademiya]] scholars in regards to being more open-minded and original in his way of thinking, and by Alhaitham as being emotional to the extent that he could be seen as fragile or sensitive.

He is easily flustered, and quick to become defensive or angry as a result (particularly when dealing with Alhaitham, or when the subject of money is brought up) and will derail entire conversations to vent his frustrations in the presence of friends and strangers alike. Kaveh and Alhaitham's clash in personality and intense disagreements are such that they even bleed into messages on bulletin boards across [[Sumeru City]] and [[Port Ormos]].

However, despite his tendency to become irritable, Kaveh also prides himself on his capacity for empathy, and will approach people without hesitation if he suspects they’re in trouble. Alhaitham implies during a routine argument of theirs that it’s common for him to "work himself to death" for the sake of pleasing his clients, and even recounts a story where Kaveh, without a second thought, purchased a dozen handmade keychains that were being sold under the pretense that the proceeds would help feed hungry children&mdash;completely overlooking the fact that healthcare and other necessities were already free to [[Sumeru]] citizens.<ref group="Note">Despite Alhaitham's implying that Sumeru has sufficient free food for the poor, it is still possible that Kaveh was not duped, as Sumeru is known to have families even in Dharma Forest who do not seem to get enough to eat, such as [[Tanger]] and [[Razi]], who only ate [[Zaytun Peach]]es for dinner every night before Tanger gained fame. However, given Kaveh's personality displayed thus far, it is still possible that Kaveh was, indeed, duped. There is currently not enough information to determine the full story.</ref> Additionally, Kaveh disagrees with the Akademiya’s labeling of certain students as geniuses because of the societal pressure that comes along with such a title.

Kaveh is also a staunch defender of the arts, and heavily idealizes things that he considers to be ornate, beautiful, or romantic in terms of interior design or architecture.

Kaveh has distinct, medium length dirty blonde hair and sharp eyes with red irises. His hair hangs down the back of his head, complimented with some red hair clips holding his hair, and a slight braid. On Kaveh's left, he wears a blue feather tucked under one of his hair strands and above his ear. He also sports a pair of golden, angular ear ornaments with small red and blue squares inside of them.

Kaveh dons a white shirt with a high collar and triangular chest window. Along his collar he wears a golden, angular ornament along with his cape. His cape is a mix of black, gold, and blue, but majorly red. It is split into two halves with intricate patterns. Along his waist, he wears a coastal blue sash, white tassels with golden ornaments, and his Dendro Vision on his left. His pants are colored black with some patterning and his footwear is a pair of white socks with a sandal-like structure.

{{Quote|Mainstream Sumeru academia tends to hide a certain fact from time to time, which is that for some people, talent can occasionally be more of a burden instead. Nevertheless, this view can also be but an excuse. In truth, it is your character that determines your destiny first and foremost. The aforementioned ideas are the sort that Kaveh will persistently rebut.|[[Alhaitham]]}}
A renowned architect from Sumeru, known as the Light of [[Kshahrewar]]. He is one of the most high-profile figures in the industry.

As a designer and an outstanding alumnus, Kaveh has quite the reputation among Akademiya students and is idolized as a role model by the students of Kshahrewar. Unfortunately, his career is not as plain-sailing as people imagine. The same can be said for many other facets of his life.

Titles, rumors, fame, and reputation... These are all mere by-products of his work. Equipped with astounding professional design skills, Kaveh puts his heart and soul into his work and is imbued with ideals and pursuits for aesthetics and architectonics. Designers are not in charge of the construction's final execution, yet they hold responsibility for all its aspects. Thus, be it design details, safety and security, or practicality, no effort may be spared in ensuring the quality of each aspect. On top of that, being one of the best in his field, Kaveh pays additional attention to the aesthetic and human elements that he is concerned about throughout the process. For him, designs that are completely divorced from reality should be classified as fantasy, whereas a building that is actually put into construction must have practical value.

That said, it is rather inconceivable that such an extraordinary architect could have been rendered bankrupt by a single project. Fortunately, very few know about this matter, and most of them keep it a secret. As for Kaveh himself, he is deathly afraid that the secret of his bankruptcy might ever leak out. It is thus fair to say that he is not really living his ideal life.
