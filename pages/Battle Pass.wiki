The '''Battle Pass''' is a recurring [[Event]] unlocked at [[Adventure Rank]] 20. Once unlocked, players can complete various daily, weekly, and BP Period missions in order to gain [[Battle Pass EXP]] (BEP).

Each of the 50 levels in the Battle Pass requires 1,000 EXP. Upon reaching each level, players will unlock rewards depending on their Battle Pass type (basic Battle Pass or Gnostic Hymn). {{Item|Primogem|24|x=150}} can be used to purchase a level. The game automatically sets the amount to what is needed to reach the next level ending in 0 or 5, but the amount can be increased or decreased as desired.

Purchasing the '''Gnostic Hymn''' or '''Gnostic Chorus''' packages allows you to claim rewards from all previously unlocked levels in the current BP Period. These packages must be re-purchased every BP Period.

==Gnostic Hymn==
Gnostic Hymn can be purchased for $10 USD and will unlock a second tier for the current BP Period. It includes an extra reward at BP Lv. 30 where the player can choose one of the 4★ weapons from the [[BP Bounty]].

===Gnostic Hymn Value===
Purchasing Gnostic Hymn awards the following items (after reaching the appropriate level in the Battle Pass):
{{Card|Hero's Wit|162|caption=1}}{{Card|Mystic Enhancement Ore|384|caption=1}}{{Card|Mora|2,880,000|caption=1}}{{Card|Primogem|680|caption=1}}{{Card|Fragile Resin|10|caption=1}}{{Card|Intertwined Fate|4|caption=1}}{{Card|Guidance of the Land of Thunder|4|caption=1}}{{Card|Guidance of the Land of Geo|3|caption=1}}{{Card|Philosophies of the Land of Thunder|1|caption=1}}{{Card|Philosophies of the Land of Geo|1|caption=1}}{{Card|BP Bounty|1|caption=1}}
The items' values in [[Original Resin]] are follows:
*'''420 Original Resin''' for 126 Hero's Wit via [[Ley Line Outcrops]] at World Levels 6, 7, and 8.
*'''480 Original Resin''' for 288 Mystic Enhancement Ore using [[Magical Crystal Chunk]].
**'''9.6 Days''', without using Original Resin, to use 1,152 [[Crystal Chunk]]s to craft 288 Mystic Enhancement Ore.
*'''720 Original Resin''' for 2,160,000 Mora via [[Ley Line Outcrops]] at World Levels 6, 7, and 8.
*'''816 Original Resin''' for 680 Primogems.
*'''300 Original Resin''' for 5 Fragile Resins.
*'''768 Original Resin''' for 4 Intertwined Fates.
*'''383 Original Resin''' for 195 (2{{Star}}) units of talent books, with an average of 0.23 Philosophies (4{{Star}}), 1.97 Guides (3{{Star}}), and 2.20 Teachings (2{{Star}}) or 10.18 (2{{Star}}) units per run at Domain Level IV.<ref>Genshin Data Gathering Team: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RcuniapqS6nOP05OCH0ui10Vo3bWu0AvFbhgcHzTybY Drop Rates]</ref>

Considering the 50 Primogems to 60 Original Resin ratio from the first Original Resin refill per day, without considering the exclusive BP weapon, the values that approximate the worth of Gnostic Hymn are:
*'''3887''' Original Resin.
*'''3239''' Primogems.
*'''21.6 Days''' of game progression.
*'''500%''' efficiency relative to a 3280 [[Genesis Crystal]] or 6480 [[Genesis Crystal]] bundle.

The value that can be purely used to wish on a promotional character or weapon banner is '''1320''' Primogems, which has at least '''204%''' efficiency relative to any [[Genesis Crystal]] bundle.

==Gnostic Chorus==
Gnostic Chorus costs around $20 USD (or $11.99 if the player has already purchased Gnostic Hymn). It will advance the Battle Pass by 10 Levels, contains a Battle Pass exclusive [[:Category:Battle Pass Namecards|Travel Notes]] [[Namecard]], a [[Furnishing Blueprint]], and {{Item|Fragile Resin|24|x=5}}.
