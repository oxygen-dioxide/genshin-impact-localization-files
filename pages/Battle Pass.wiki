The '''Battle Pass''' is a recurring [[Event]] unlocked at [[Adventure Rank]] 20. Once unlocked, players can complete various daily, weekly, and BP Period missions in order to gain [[Battle Pass EXP]] (BEP).

Each of the 50 levels in the Battle Pass requires 1000 EXP (in versions 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2 this was temporarily reduced to 900 EXP). Upon reaching each level, players will unlock rewards depending on their Battle Pass type (basic Battle Pass or Gnostic Hymn). {{Item|Primogem|24|x=150}} can be used to purchase a level. The game automatically sets the amount to what is needed to reach the next level ending in 0 or 5, but the amount can be increased or decreased as desired.

There is a weekly cap of 10000 EXP that can be obtained from daily and weekly missions which resets on 4 AM server time each Monday. Each BP Period also has a unique branch of BP-only missions that often revolve around any active event(s) and general tasks such as overall wishes or completing the [[Imaginarium Theater]]. These BP-only missions provide larger amounts of EXP and do not count towards the weekly cap, so they can be done at any time.

Purchasing the '''Gnostic Hymn''' or '''Gnostic Chorus''' packages allows you to claim rewards from all previously unlocked levels in the current BP Period. These packages must be re-purchased every BP Period.

==Reward Plan==
Before being able to claim the Battle Pass rewards, a Basic BP Reward Plan must be selected from three of the following:
{| class="article-table"
!Type
!Items 
|-
|Mora
|{{Card|Mora|show_caption=1}}
|-
|Character EXP
|{{Card|Adventurer's Experience|show_caption=1}}{{Card|Hero's Wit|show_caption=1}}
|-
|Weapon EXP
|{{Card|Mystic Enhancement Ore|show_caption=1}}
|-
|Artifact EXP
|{{Card|Sanctifying Unction|show_caption=1}}{{Card|Sanctifying Essence|show_caption=1}}
|}

BP Rewards are divided into groups of 10 levels. If all of the rewards from a given group have not been claimed, the reward selection in that group can be changed by changing the reward plan. If any of the rewards in a group have already been claimed, the rewards in the group it belongs to cannot be changed.

==Sojourner's Battle Pass==
The Sojourner's Battle Pass is unlocked by default at the start of each BP Period.

===Rewards===
Depending on the reward plan chosen, the following rewards will be granted in total (after reaching the appropriate Battle Pass level):
{| class="article-table"
!Type
!Total Amount
|-
|Mora 
|{{Card|Mora|540,000|show_caption=1}} 
|-
|Character EXP
|{{Card|Adventurer's Experience|48|show_caption=1}}{{Card|Hero's Wit|42|show_caption=1}}
|-
|Weapon EXP
|{{Card|Mystic Enhancement Ore|108|show_caption=1}}
|-
|Artifact EXP
|{{Card|Sanctifying Unction|63|show_caption=1}}
|}

The Sojourner's Battle Pass additionally awards the following items, regardless of the reward plan chosen (after reaching the appropriate level in the Battle Pass):
{{Card List|Acquaint Fate*5;Fragile Resin*5|delim=;|show_caption=1}}

==Gnostic Hymn==
Gnostic Hymn can be purchased for $9.99 USD and will unlock a second tier for the current BP Period, containing enhanced general rewards and Talent level-up bundles. At level 30 BP, the player can choose one of the 4★ weapons from the [[BP Bounty]].

===Weapons===

===Gnostic Hymn Rewards and Value===
Depending on the reward plan chosen, the following rewards will be granted additionally to the rewards in the Sojourner's Battle Pass (after reaching the appropriate Battle Pass level):
{| class="article-table"
!Type
!Total Amount
|-
|Mora 
|{{Card|Mora|1,620,000|show_caption=1}} 
|-
|Character EXP
|{{Card|Hero's Wit|159|show_caption=1}}
|-
|Weapon EXP
|{{Card|Mystic Enhancement Ore|324|show_caption=1}}
|-
|Artifact EXP
|{{Card|Sanctifying Essence|45|show_caption=1}}
|}
Purchasing Gnostic Hymn awards the following items in addition to those obtained in the Sojourner's Battle Pass, regardless of the reward plan chosen (after reaching the appropriate Battle Pass level):
{{Card List|Primogem*680;Sanctifying Elixir*1;Intertwined Fate*4;Fragile Resin*5;Guides of a Journey*7;Philosophies of a Journey*2;BP Bounty*1|delim=;|show_caption=1}}
The items' values in [[Original Resin]] are as follows: 
*'''519 Original Resin''' for 159 Hero's Wit via [[Ley Line Outcrops]] at World Levels 6–9.
*'''540 Original Resin''' for 324 Mystic Enhancement Ore using [[Magical Crystal Chunk]]. 
**'''10.8 Days''', without using Original Resin, to use 1,296 [[Crystal Chunk]]s to craft 324 Mystic Enhancement Ore.
*'''540 Original Resin''' for 1,620,000 Mora via [[Ley Line Outcrops]] at World Levels 6–9.
*'''610 Original Resin''' for 450,000 Artifact EXP via Level VI [[Domain of Blessing]].
*'''816 Original Resin''' for 680 Primogems.
*'''300 Original Resin''' for 5 Fragile Resin.
*'''768 Original Resin''' for 4 Intertwined Fates.
*'''383 Original Resin''' for 195 (2{{Star}}) units of talent books, with an average of 0.23 Philosophies (4{{Star}}), 1.97 Guides (3{{Star}}), and 2.20 Teachings (2{{Star}}) or 10.18 (2{{Star}}) units per run at Domain Level IV.<ref>Genshin Data Gathering Team: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RcuniapqS6nOP05OCH0ui10Vo3bWu0AvFbhgcHzTybY Drop Rates]</ref> 

Considering the 50 Primogems to 60 Original Resin ratio from the first Original Resin refill per day, and without factoring in the exclusive BP weapon or the Sanctifying Elixir, while choosing the most resin-value BP plan (Mora, Weapon EXP, and Artifact EXP), the values that approximate the worth of Gnostic Hymn are:
*'''3,957''' Original Resin.
*'''3,298''' Primogems.
*'''22 Days''' of game progression.
*'''500%''' efficiency relative to a 3,280 [[Genesis Crystal]] or 6,480 [[Genesis Crystal]] bundle.

The value that can be purely used to wish on a promotional character or weapon banner is '''1,320''' Primogems, which has at least '''204%''' efficiency relative to any [[Genesis Crystal]] bundle.

==Gnostic Chorus==
Gnostic Chorus costs around $20 USD (or $11.99 USD if the player has already purchased Gnostic Hymn). It will advance the Battle Pass by 10 Levels, contains a Battle Pass exclusive [[:Category:Battle Pass Namecards|Travel Notes]] [[Namecard]], a [[Furnishing Blueprint#Battle Pass - Gnostic Chorus|Furnishing Blueprint]], and {{Item|Fragile Resin|24|x=5}}.

===Namecards===
