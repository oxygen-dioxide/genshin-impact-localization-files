|text1    = A ruin machine that can absorb energy and hurl it back as an attack. This machine has even greater abilities than the [[Ruin Drake]], being able to attack from the air and on the ground. The [[Aeonblight Drake]] can periodically release a dangerous torrent of energy and increase its own Elemental RES against the previous main type of Elemental DMG it has suffered. Under various circumstances, the {{Color|help|cores}} all over its body will be exposed. Take such opportunities to attack those cores, and you may be able to immobilize this creature and {{Color|help|remove its Elemental RES boost}}. Whenever this creature recovers from paralysis, it will switch between aerial and ground-attack forms.
