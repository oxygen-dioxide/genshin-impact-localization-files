'''Oeno''' is a quest-exclusive NPC.

==Profile==
Oeno is the boss of a [[Saurian]] trafficking group in [[Natlan]]. He<ref group="Note>Despite the Iktomisaurus Warrior: Cryocrystal Cannon model having a female appearance, this page will use the in-game pronouns used for Oeno to reflect dialogue accurately.</ref> and his [[Treasure Hoarder]] accomplices injure and kidnap people's Saurian companions to sell them for a profit. His enemy title in ''[[Friends of Fire and Water]]'' implies that he once had a Saurian companion of his own, but possibly betrayed it by selling it off. The [[Traveler]], [[Paimon]], and [[Little One]] fight him on two separate occasions, and he is defeated in the second encounter.

===Appearance===
Oeno takes the appearance of an [[Iktomisaurus Warrior: Cryocrystal Cannon]].
