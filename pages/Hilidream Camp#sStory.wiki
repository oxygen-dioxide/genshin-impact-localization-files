:'''Traveler:''' ...
:'''???:'''  ...
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} ...What is this place?
:'''???:'''  ...This is The Realm Within, a refuge beyond the mortal world created by the adepti.
:'''Teapot Spirit:'''  My name is... Hmm, no. As an outsider, you need only know me as a teapot spirit.
:'''Teapot Spirit:'''  Hmm... You seem quite capable. Maybe you might be able to help me solve the problems these hilichurls are causing.
:{{DIcon}} Hilichurls?
:{{DIcon}} I can take ten of them at once!
::'''Teapot Spirit:''' Hey. Violence shouldn't be your first option. Not to mention how I'd have to clean up after you.
:'''Teapot Spirit:''' For some reason, a group of hilichurls appeared within this realm a few days ago. Since then, they've been cutting trees down, setting up straw huts... Sometimes they even start to dance for no reason. Whatever it is, they've made a real mess out of this place.
:'''Teapot Spirit:''' But never mind the racket. The furnishings that they've made are just... Let me ask you, have you ever seen a three-legged bed?
:{{DIcon}} Sure I have
::'''Teapot Spirit:''' ...Have you? You have a rather broad range of experience, don't you? In that case, could you help guide those hilichurls to make some furnishings?
:{{DIcon}} Not in my life.
::'''Teapot Spirit:''' You're a Traveler, aren't you? You must have experienced a good number of things, then. In that case, could you help guide those hilichurls to make some furnishings?
:'''Traveler:''' Not going to do that yourself?
:'''Teapot Spirit:''' We teapot spirits do not show ourselves to outsiders easily, but this is an exception.
:'''Teapot Spirit:''' Moreover, if I were to guide them, we would still be here after seven days, talking about the basics of making furnishings.
:'''Teapot Spirit:''' As such, I'll leave this to you, Traveler. You will be well compensated for your efforts.

;(Unlock 4 Furnishings)
:'''Teapot Spirit:''' This seems passable, if somewhat marginally so. You're quite gifted, actually.
:'''Traveler:''' I've been meaning to ask... why do you look like a teapot?
:'''Teapot Spirit:''' These realms are created by the adepti, and so are we teapot spirits. We are meant to help guard their realms and manage their affairs.
:'''Teapot Spirit:''' As for the reason why I look like a teapot... Well, I only stay in the teapot. I don't actually look like one!
----
;(Unlock 9 Furnishings)
:'''Traveler:''' So, why did adepti make these realms?
:'''Teapot Spirit:''' A long time ago, the world was in tumult, and finding half a day or so of peace was a much-needed good.
:'''Teapot Spirit:''' But such realms and the departures from the world they provide are only temporary.
:'''Teapot Spirit:''' I haven't heard from the previous owner of this realm for a long time... perhaps they no longer require such a moment of peace.
----
;(Unlock 12 Furnishings)
:'''Teapot Spirit:''' This realm is beginning to fill up with all sorts of strange furnishings... Where did you learn to create such things?
:'''Traveler:''' Been to many places and met many people.
:'''Teapot Spirit:''' My knowledge comes from the adepti who created me, and while I wouldn't consider myself all-knowing, I do know a lot.
:'''Teapot Spirit:''' Still, the mortal realm changes ever so quickly...
----
;(Unlock 15 Furnishings)
:'''Teapot Spirit:''' All this hustle and bustle is making me nostalgic.
:'''Traveler:''' Those hilichurls are having an indoor barbecue...
:'''Teapot Spirit:''' Did you teach them how to make that stove, by any chance?
:'''Traveler:''' ...
:'''Teapot Spirit:''' ...Perhaps I should have asked you all to leave from the start.
:'''Teapot Spirit:''' Well, I say that. But despite the noise, it's been a long time since this realm was so lively. Thank you, Traveler.
:'''Teapot Spirit:''' Will you be continuing on your journey soon? If that's the case, I hope that you will find a "home" that you can call your own, come the wind or rain.

|{{Character|Lisa}}
|-
|rowspan="3"|{{Hilidream|Mitachurl Mask|150}}

|{{Character|Zhongli}}
|-
|There are some merchants who are superstitious about folding screens that can bring prosperity. But I believe that fate is something best grasped in one's own hands.

|{{Character|Barbara}}

| -
|-
|This can be used as a footstool when making cocktails... I'll make a purrfectly awful drink this time, just you wait!
|{{Character|Diona}}
|-
|Stealing a moment to have short rest in the middle of a busy day isn't bad... once in a while. Care to join me for a drink?
|{{Character|Kaeya}}
|-
|rowspan="3"|{{Hilidream|Multipurpose Pot|150}}

|-
