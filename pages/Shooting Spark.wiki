Klee's hair is tied in pigtails. She wears a red coat with a darker red embellishment and keyhole shapes in the hem over a white dress and shorts, as well as a fluffy scarf with a pom-pom, gloves, knee socks, boots, and a brown backpack that resembles a {{w|randoseru}}, a backpack commonly used by elementary school children in Japan. Attached to this bag is her {{Pyro}} [[Vision]], as well as [[Dodoco]], a furry, woodland animal-shaped pom-pom made by her mother. She also wears a large red newsboy cap with a pin featuring a clover insignia and two white feathers.
