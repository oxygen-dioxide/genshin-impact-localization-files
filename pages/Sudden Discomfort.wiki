:{{A|vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 01.ogg}} '''Fu San'er:''' It's dangerous to walk alone here, isn't it?
:{{A|vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 02.ogg}} '''Fu San'er:''' You have no idea who... or what you'll meet.
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 03.ogg}} '''Fu San'er:''' Hmm, you seem to be pretty calm. You know, there's a saying, "you can't keep your shoes dry if you keep walking along the river."
:{{A|vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 04.ogg}} '''Fu San'er:''' You're bound to run into something in such a strange and eerie place...
:{{A|vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 05.ogg}} '''Fu San'er:''' And what you encounter here could become a nightmare that haunts you for the rest of your life.
:{{DIcon}} Oh, really?
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, I don't get it... What are you doing here?
:{{A|vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 06.ogg}} '''Fu San'er:''' Huh? How are you so calm? People usually run away in terror before I can finish a sentence.
:{{DIcon}} You look like just another average person to me.
::{{A|vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 07.ogg}} '''Fu San'er:''' Yeah... but a more sophisticated way to play a ghost is to create a creepy atmosphere that scares people psychologically.
:{{DIcon}} Don't you have a costume or anything like that?
::{{A|vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 09.ogg}} '''Fu San'er:''' Yes, I have one, but it's too hot to wear... and besides, a more sophisticated way to play a ghost is to create a creepy atmosphere that scares people psychologically.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 08.ogg}}<!--vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 10.ogg--> '''Fu San'er:''' In which case, my appearance becomes irrelevant.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 11.ogg}} '''Fu San'er:''' *sigh* Besides, I'll never be able to scare someone like you who doesn't believe in ghosts to begin with.
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like you're just slacking off to me...
:{{A|vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 12.ogg}} '''Fu San'er:''' Hey, that's not true! Oh, I'd better go find some wimps to scare now!
:{{A|vo cycop001 1903102 fusaner 13.ogg}} '''Fu San'er:''' You should go back and find your partner. He might be terrified by now.
:;(Go to [[Killjoy]])
