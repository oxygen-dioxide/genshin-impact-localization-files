==Profile==
Grace serves as a motherly figure to children in [[Mondstadt]] who were either abandoned or otherwise lack parental figures in their lives. Three people she is known to take care of are [[Glory]],<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Glory}}</ref> [[Timmie]], and [[Nora]].<ref name="sorry">{{Ref/Quest|Sorry, Timmie!}}</ref>

Both Glory and Timmie call Grace their mother, though she tells the [[Traveler]] that Timmie is not biologically related to her, while Glory's parentage is unknown. Nora does not speak about her mother and only mentions her father, [[Patton]], who is too busy repaying his debt to [[Angel's Share]] to care for Nora.

During the event [[Unreconciled Stars]], she gives the quest "[[That Which Fell From the Sky]]."

::'''Grace:''' Although I say that it is over, [[Dvalin]]'s influence will likely remain for a while longer...
::'''Grace:''' But I believe that as long as the winds of Mondstadt persist, Lord Barbatos will always be with us.
::'''Grace:''' ...Perhaps he is already amongst us. Who can say?

==Event Dialogue==
===Invitation of Windblume===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Grace:''' Nowadays, no one truly knows what the Windblume is.
:'''Grace:''' There are some who have judged that the flower simply does not exist, save in legend and song only.
:'''Grace:''' The way I see it, Windblumes are real so long as there are those who believe in it.
:'''Grace:''' As to which flower it might be, I think that everyone is free to decide that for themselves.
:'''Grace:''' I believe that this "freedom to choose" is what Lord Barbatos would have wished for us to have...
