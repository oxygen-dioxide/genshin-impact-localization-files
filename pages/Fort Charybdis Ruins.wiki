==Trivia==
*{{w|Charybdis}} is a sea monster from Greek mythology that lives on one side of a narrow channel of water alongside her counterpart, {{w|Scylla}}, their distances being an arrow-shot away from each other. She takes on the form of a gigantic whirlpool that swallows the ocean and spits it back out again. In the myths, she, alongside Scylla, pose a serious threat to several Greek heroes, most notably Odysseus, king of Ithaca and hero of Homer's ''Odyssey''.
