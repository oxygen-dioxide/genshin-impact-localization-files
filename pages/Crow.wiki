Some locals consider them inauspicious, while others consider them a symbol of good fortune. As the saying goes, that's how traditions work.<br>Rumors abound among adventurers from various nations concerning a [[Oz|giant talking crow]] raised by a [[Fischl|young female investigator]] from [[Mondstadt]]...
