==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Tizoc:''' *sigh* It's always like this... So embarrassing...
:{{DIcon}} What happened?
::'''Tizoc:''' Ah, well, I'm a supplier who delivers ingredients for Ms. [[Chanca]] every so often.
::'''Tizoc:''' But even though all I do is help carry things around from time to time, she always insists that I stay for a meal.
::'''Tizoc:''' The issue is, I have quite the appetite... So I always feel guilty eating here without paying.
::{{DIcon}} Your boss seems like the nice sort.
::'''Tizoc:''' Yeah, that's just how Ms. Chanca is.
::'''Tizoc:''' Did you know that she used to be a top-ranking warrior in the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]]?
::'''Tizoc:''' But she was forced to retire after seriously injuring her leg in the [[Night Warden Wars]].
::'''Tizoc:''' Many people used to come here on her reputation's account, but she never liked them making all that fuss.
::'''Tizoc:''' On that note, I suppose I shouldn't say too much either. All I'll say is, she's a very reliable owner, and this is a great place to come to.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Tizoc:''' *sigh* See you then.
