'''The Sea of Flowers at the End''' is a location that the [[Traveler's Sibling]] discovered at the end of their journey across [[Teyvat]]. During their travels across worlds, the [[Traveler]] had previously expressed a desire to find a place in the universe where [[Inteyvat]] flowers were in full bloom, so when the Traveler's Sibling discovered this place, it inspired them to stop their journey with the Traveler and become involved with Teyvat's affairs.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|World-Order Narration}}</ref>

The [[Epilogue]] of ''Genshin Impact''{{'}}s [[Archon Quest]]s takes place in this location.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/TAlKhARUcoY Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview]</ref>
