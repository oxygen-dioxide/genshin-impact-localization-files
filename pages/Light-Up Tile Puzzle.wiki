'''Light-Up Tile Puzzles''' refer to panels or platforms that can be lit up when the player steps on them. Some puzzles require the player to light up all the tiles, whereas some require the player to light them up in a certain configuration. For the Tile Puzzles in Inazuma, stepping on a lit tile will deactivate it. The tiles usually have the [[Solomon's knot]] symbol on them.
