==Descriptions==
{{Description|Where the Stadium of the Sacred Flame is situated.<br>Members of the Saurian Relics Association once surveyed the terrain and concluded that this basin was not a natural formation, but rather the result of a [[Celestial Nail|colossal object]] crashing down here many years ago.<br>However, what exactly that colossal object was remains a mystery for which no one has been able to provide a definite answer. Perhaps if the ancient Sacred Flames could speak, they might just hear the answer they seek. Alas, the flames on the Stele of the Sacred Flame burn on, and have yet to answer anyone’s questions.|[[Expedition]] description}}
