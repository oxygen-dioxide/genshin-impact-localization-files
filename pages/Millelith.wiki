{{Quote|While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail!|Motto of the Millelith}}
The '''Millelith''' is a military force stationed around [[Liyue]] to serve as guards, reporting to the [[Liyue Qixing]]. They are the Liyue equivalent of the [[Knights of Favonius]] and the [[Inazuma Shogunate]]. Unlike the Knights of Favonius, there are no playable Millelith, and they serve as antagonists for much of Liyue's [[Archon Quests]].

The Millelith was originally the Millelith Brigade, which served in the [[Archon War]].<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Fengyan}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Lithic Blade}}</ref> Local elders would take oaths of allegiance to [[Morax]], and select soldiers.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Noble's Pledging Vessel}}</ref> These ancient Millelith also apparently had superhuman strength (at least by current standards).<ref group="Note">[[Lithic Spear]] and [[Lithic Blade]]’s descriptions assert that they are extremely heavy and nearly impossible to carry, but the ancient Millelith would all wield them.</ref> Once the Archon War ended, the Millelith started reporting to the Qixing.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I}}</ref>

==Enemies==
{{main|Millelith Soldiers}}
The Millelith can be encountered as enemies in certain [[Archon Quests]].

==Trivia==
* The name Millelith derives from Latin {{Lang|mini=1|la=''{{wt|mille||Latin}}''|la_tl=thousand}} and Greek {{Lang|mini=1|el=''{{wt|λίθος|lithos|Ancient Greek}}''|el_tl=stone.}}
* Millelith soldiers are usually seen wielding polearms, using either the [[White Tassel]] or the [[Halberd]], though a few Millelith soldiers can be seen using swords in the Archon Quest [[Rite of Descension]]. The sword being used in the cutscene is the [[Dark Iron Sword]] (pre-Ascension design).
* The Millelith Sergeants resemble Fengyan, but with black hair and a lack of goatee.
*Descriptions of several Furnishing items mention the Millelith:
** [[Adeptus Gate]]
** [[Formation Rock]]
** [[Foundations of Stone: Double-Time]]
** [[Hardwood Weapon Rack]]
** [[Thundering Heavens Drum]]
** [[Toy Stand: Dazzling Delights]]
