==Descriptions==
===Riddle Note 1===
"A mirror not made of glass reflects every drama."<br>
Another riddle you got from the chest indicated by the previous riddle.<br>
Who wrote these riddles...<br>
Maybe the answer is hidden somewhere associated with dramas?

===Riddle Note 2===
"The sole path to knowledge."<br>
A riddle that is surprisingly straightforward to read.<br>
But what does "the sole path" mean in this case?

===Riddle Note 3===
"The flowers in the pond are blooming, with watery pearls there lingering."<br>
The third riddle found from a chest.<br>
Perhaps this might be some kind of plant?

===Riddle Note 4===
"Please go to the front door of the Temple of Knowledge at noon."<br>
This riddle is like some kind of "invitation"...
