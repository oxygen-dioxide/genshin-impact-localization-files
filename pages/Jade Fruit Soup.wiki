|desc_basic      = The water is brought to boil, various ingredients are added in, and then it is simmered for some time before rock sugar is added. The liquid mixture is then simmered until clear and thick. The lengthy simmering creates a soup with a gentle mouthfeel, causing the ingredients to melt with just a light sip. Suitable for all ages.
|desc_delicious  = The large chunk of fruit soaked in the soup seems like unto a lonesome boat drifting down a flowing river, and the fresh taste of the dish assails like a sudden breeze.

The dish, prepared by steaming rock sugar and an {{w|Pyrus pyrifolia|Asian pear}} together over a slow fire, is said to have cooling properties and is commonly taken as a cold antidote.
