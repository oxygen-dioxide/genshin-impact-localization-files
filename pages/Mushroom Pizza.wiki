'''Mushroom Pizza''' is a [[food]] item that the player can cook. The [[recipe]] for Mushroom Pizza is obtainable from a Precious Chest at [[Stormterror's Lair]], just north of the tower. The recipe is also obtainable during {{Quest|Food From Afar}}.

Depending on the quality, Mushroom Pizza restores '''26'''/'''28'''/'''30'''% of Max HP to the selected character, and regenerates '''450'''/'''620'''/'''790''' HP every 5 seconds for 30 seconds. Like most foods, this has no effect for other players in [[Co-Op Mode]].

==Trivia==
* To celebrate Jean's birthday, the [[Teyvat Food Notes]] published a [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/14518 real-life recipe] for Mushroom Pizza and [[Invigorating Pizza]]. Both pizzas use a cheesy garlic mushroom sauce instead of a tomato sauce, and Mushroom Pizza uses arugula (represented in-game with a cabbage) while Invigorating Pizza uses green bell peppers instead.
