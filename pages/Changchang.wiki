==Trivia==
* In [[Linling's Anthology of Selected Poetry]], [[Linling]] complains in a poem that Changchang's crying is disturbing the beautiful night. Given that Changchang is never seen crying, it is likely that Linling mixed up Changchang with [[Yi Xian]].
* She is one of the very few people from Liyue whose name in the Japanese localization is directly transcribed from Chinese instead of being read as the ''{{w|on'yomi}}'' or ''{{w|kun'yomi}}''.
