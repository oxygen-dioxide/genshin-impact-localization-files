::'''Changchang:''' Hee-hee, everyone says I'm very polite for my age. Are you waiting for someone too?
::{{DIcon}} Are you here on your own?
:::'''Changchang:''' Yep! But it's okay, I'm very grown-up for my age and I play by myself all the time! Grandad works in the Dockyard as a conduction worker... conduction...? Construction, construction worker. I made a boo-boo again.
:::'''Changchang:''' I'm not scared though, everyone's really nice here and there's the [[Millelith]] to beat up all the bad guys!
::{{DIcon}} What're you playing now?
:::'''Changchang:''' Right now I'm not playing. I'm doing something very important!
:::'''Changchang:''' I'm waiting for daddy. I've lost count of how many days he's been away now...
:::'''Changchang:''' But whenever daddy comes home he always brings lots and lots of pressies!
:::'''Changchang:''' Last time, he brought me some new clothes! And the time before that, he brought me a windmill! And the time before that, he brought me loads and loads and loads of candy!
:::'''Changchang:''' ...And the time before that, he brought me, erm, a porcelain doll! And, and, and... [[Wolfhook]] Cake! And a little bottle that lights up in the wind! And a purple hourglass! And...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Changchang:''' Bye-bye!

:'''Changchang:''' Last night in my dream, Dolly told me her wish was to fly up into the sky and see the view.
:'''Changchang:''' So I gave her to the lady over by the big deer lantern. Dolly's wish will come true now, won't it?
:'''Changchang:''' I did the right thing, didn't I? Wishes are supposed to come true at the Lantern Rite, aren't they?
{{Dialogue end}}

;(Continue non-event dialogue)
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* In [[Linling's Anthology of Selected Poetry]], [[Linling]] complains in a poem that Changchang's crying is disturbing the beautiful night. Given that Changchang is never seen crying, it is likely that Linling mixed up Changchang with [[Yi Xian]].
* She is one of the very few people from Liyue whose name is directly transcribed from Chinese instead of being read as the ''{{w|on'yomi}}'' or ''{{w|kun'yomi}}''.
