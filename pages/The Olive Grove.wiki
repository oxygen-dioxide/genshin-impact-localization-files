|description    = A gorgeous carpet made of tough plant fiber and excellent quality dye that has a memorable fruit-green motif and light-gold decorative patterns that reveal a luxurious look and feel.<br>In reality, the prices of such rugs are so affordable that rug shops all over the [[Grand Bazaar]] sell them, and ordinary merchants use them as floor mats for their stalls. The reason for this is that the research theories of various scholars from the [[Akademiya]] have gradually been applied to the production process. It is said that the most promising advancement in rug fibers was an incidental result, born from a senior architecture researcher's work on lightweight building materials. However, the man himself seems to have no knowledge of this and is more concerned with the equipment that assists in the weaving process.

The blueprint for The Olive Grove is obtainable from a [[Remarkable Chest]] in the Hypostyle Desert in [[Sumeru]], it is locked behind a Clearance level 4 door in an underground ruin.

==How to Obtain==
Obtained from a Remarkable Chest underground in [[Hypostyle Desert]].

Go north from the waypoint near the lower left corner of [[The Mausoleum of King Deshret]]. When you arrive at a fork in the road, go left. There are two [[Scarlet Sand Slate|locked doors]] on either side of the room. Go through the left one first, where you will pick up a prism. Then go through the right-side door and activate the mechanism by standing on the square. This will open another door on the right side of that room. The chest is there.
