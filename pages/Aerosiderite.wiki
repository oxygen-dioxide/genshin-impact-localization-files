{{Lang|'''Aerosiderite'''|zh=陨铁|zh_rm=Yǔntiě|zh_tl=Meteoric Iron}} is a rare ore of varying quality used to [[Weapon Ascension Materials|ascend]] [[Weapons]].

As its name implies, this rare ore is only found in meteors. While the ascension materials refer to a meteor created by Rex Lapis' power,<ref name="Aero Grain">{{Ref/Item|Grain of Aerosiderite}}</ref> it is unknown whether aerosiderite in Teyvat can only be found in meteors created by the god or if any meteor can contain this material.

==History==
At some point during the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago, Morax dropped a meteor beyond the [[Sea of Clouds]] to vanquish a corrupted monster. The monster's blood stained the meteor's material black, tainting it with a power from beyond Teyvat.<ref name="Aero Grain" />

Within about a lifetime after the cataclysm, [[Han Ce]] went searching for aerosiderite on his various adventures. After his father [[Han Wu]] died, Han Ce studied the weapon blueprints left to him and upon going outside a meteor made of aerosiderite landed in front of him. He used the material from the meteor alongside another rare ore, blackcliff, to forge the [[Blackcliff Pole]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Blackcliff Pole}}</ref>

==Material Lore==
Some time in the past, Morax summoned a meteor outside of the Sea of Clouds to vanquish a monster, likely one with [[Abyss]]al powers that emerged from [[Khaenri'ah]] during the cataclysm &mdash; over time, the meteor was stained by the monster's powerful tainted blood,<ref name="Aero Grain" /> which is a feat impossible for other ancient gods whose powers are derived from the same source as Morax's.<ref name="Aero Bit">{{Ref/Item|Bit of Aerosiderite}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Item|Chunk of Aerosiderite}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*The word ''{{wt|aerosiderite}}'' refers to a mass of meteoric iron.
*During the second Closed Beta Test, this term was simply called Siderite, using the definition of ''{{wt|siderite||English}}'' as an iron meteorite.
