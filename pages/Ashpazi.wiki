{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ashpazi:''' Even an idiot can cook awesome food with this fresh meat!
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'd like some fresh meat too.
::'''Ashpazi:''' Aha, looks like you know your stuff. Just pick whatever you want!
:;(Opens [[Ashpazi#Shop|Shop]] menu)
:{{DIcon}} You can cook?
::'''Ashpazi:''' Ahem, what kind of question is that?
::'''Ashpazi:''' Don't look down on my culinary expertise just because I'm wearing a [[Forest Watcher]]'s uniform! I'm the renowned "Master Chef" of the [[Forest Rangers]]!
::'''Ashpazi:''' ...Haha, alright, alright, that's enough jokes for now.
::'''Ashpazi:''' Still, even if I'm not truly "renowned," my culinary skill is pretty extraordinary. Everyone praises it once they try it.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I don't believe it.
:::'''Ashpazi:''' You got a problem with me, pal?
:::'''Ashpazi:''' But you don't look anything like an unreasonable oaf.
:::'''Ashpazi:''' Oh, I get it! You're using reverse psychology to get a free meal out of me!
:::'''Ashpazi:''' That's okay, I don't mind falling for tricks when it comes to sharing food.
:::'''Ashpazi:''' I have only one request. Just spread the good word about my food if you like it.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Shawarma Wrap|20|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} You can hunt?
::'''Ashpazi:''' Of course. Where do you think the meat I sell comes from? Did you think stupid boars rush at me and ram their heads against my arrows?
::'''Ashpazi:''' ...Haha, that's enough jokes. After being with Mr. [[Tighnari]] for so long, even the way he speaks has rubbed off on me.
::'''Ashpazi:''' I oversee logistics for the Forest Rangers, so knowing how to hunt and cook is perfectly normal, right?
::'''Ashpazi:''' In my opinion, the first step to being a good chef is to be a good hunter.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Ashpazi:''' See you. Come again if you feel like having some meat!
