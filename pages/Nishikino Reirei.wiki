==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Nishikino Reirei''': Hello. If you're looking for me, you must need some medical attention, right?
:'''Nishikino Reirei''': Did you scrape a leg? Or do you have a flu or a fever? Make it quick, please.
:{{DIcon}} Uh, you are...
::'''Nishikino Reirei''': You can't tell? I'm a doctor.
::'''Nishikino Reirei''': No, I'm not from [[Watatsumi Island]]. My family's from [[Narukami Island]]. They're mostly in the medical profession, too.
::{{DIcon}} Why did you come to Watatsumi Island?
::'''Nishikino Reirei''': While working as a traveling doctor, I happened to save one of the [[Watatsumi Army|Sangonomiya troops]] out in the wild, and heard about the situation here.
::'''Nishikino Reirei''': That they've managed to last this long without sufficient manpower or materiel... Should I call them determined, or overly eager to go it alone...
::'''Nishikino Reirei''': Well, now that I'm here, things have turned around a decent bit. These soldiers should get well... as long as they follow my advice instead of running around arbitrarily.
::'''Nishikino Reirei''': I just wish that the kids around here would be a bit less rowdy, and stop coming to me crying about broken arms and legs... I've got no time to entertain those little brats.
::{{DIcon}} You're a good person.
:::'''Nishikino Reirei''': Huh? Wh&mdash;What are you saying all of a sudden?
:::'''Nishikino Reirei''': A doctor saves lives. That's normal. Nothing more to it.
:::'''Nishikino Reirei''': ...A&mdash;Anyway, just take this. Who knows, it might be of use to you at some point.
::;(Obtain 3{{Star}} [[Traveling Doctor's Handkerchief]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} Well, I won't bother you, then.
::'''Nishikino Reirei''': Right. Call me if you need me.
