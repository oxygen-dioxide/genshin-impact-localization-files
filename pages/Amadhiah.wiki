===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue start}}<!--"Rana..."; checked during The Lost Child quest-->
:'''Amadhiah:''' It's [[Rana]]'s little guest. Well, Rana is a good guide, isn't she?
:{{DIcon}} Your vision...
::'''Amadhiah:''' Oh, my apologies. Now that I'm getting on in years, my eyes are not as sharp as they used to be. Everything is a blurry shadow to me. Luckily, my ears still work well...
::'''Amadhiah:''' I'm really sorry about before...
:{{DIcon}} About the children...
::'''Amadhiah:''' Oh, the "tiger cubs"? They are all good children, always full of energy... I wish them the blessings of [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]]. One day, they will grow up, safe and healthy.
:{{DIcon}} About Rana...
::'''Amadhiah:''' Rana... *sigh* She's been a smart girl since childhood... but sometimes she is too headstrong.
::'''Amadhiah:''' After becoming a [[Forest Watcher]], she's returned to the village less often. Forest Watchers are busy, I understand that. I'm just worried if she's getting enough rest...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Amadhiah:''' Well then, I won't keep you any longer...
::'''Amadhiah:''' Oh, one more thing, little guest. If you ever meet Rana, please remind her to take more rest...
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #3===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Amadhiah:''' It's Rana's little guest. If you're looking for Rana, she's gone on a trip and won't be back for a while.
:{{DIcon}} About Rana...
::'''Amadhiah:''' She returned all of a sudden, saying that she was to "go on a trip with a very, very important friend"...
::'''Amadhiah:''' She sounded very serious... Only those who have traveled understand the meaning of a journey. I hope she'll find what she's been looking for...
:{{DIcon}} About the musical instrument...
::'''Amadhiah:''' That instrument, huh? You can have it.
::'''Amadhiah:''' It belongs to wayfarers who travel like the wind. But it's been by my side for far too long.
::'''Amadhiah:''' Please let it sing in the woods, I guess that won't let the poet lady's goodwill go to waste...
:{{DIcon}} About your past...
::'''Amadhiah:''' Those are all stories of the past. I gave up on becoming an adventurer, but I don't regret it...
::'''Amadhiah:''' Every person has their own path in life...
:{{DIcon}} About Alphonso...
::'''Amadhiah:''' That child, Alphonso... Why did he leave without a word? He lived in Vimara Village for many years. Everyone said he's a good child...
::{{DIcon}} He might never come back again...
::'''Amadhiah:''' *sigh* He is a good child. Sometimes, he seemed preoccupied with something. I felt I was not in the position to ask...
::'''Amadhiah:''' I hope he will stop worrying about those things in the future.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Amadhiah:''' Well then, I won't keep you any longer...
