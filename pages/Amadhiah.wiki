===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
<!-- If I remember it correctly, Amadhiah disappeared after The Children of Vimara Village and only showed up again during The World of Aranara. The below dialogue is when talking to him after the initial encounter with him in The Children of Vimara Village. Judging by the text format, it's more like the missing NPC dialogue rather than an optional quest dialogue. -->
;(Before competing [[The Children of Vimara Village]])
:'''Amadhiah:''' Ah, friends of Rana, sorry about before. I must apologize for my aging eyes.
:{{DIcon}} About the mysterious creatures we saw before...
::'''Amadhiah:''' You mean the round little plantlike fairies? I think I saw them before, but when and what was it...?
::{{DIcon}} Are they called Aranara?
::'''Amadhiah:''' Aranara... Probably. I might have heard stories before, but I'm too old to remember for sure.
::'''Amadhiah:''' The forests of Sumeru are very big, teeming with countless wondrous creatures. But one won't miss what they're destined to find.
::'''Amadhiah:''' However, if I was destined, I shouldn't have forgotten about them, either. So when was it...?
:{{DIcon}} About Rana...
::'''Amadhiah:''' Rana is a good kid. She works hard every day to keep this old man and the children in Vimara Village safe.
::'''Amadhiah:''' I wonder when she'll have time to start a family and settle down.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Amadhiah:''' Okay, goodbye.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue Start}}<!--"Rana..."; checked during The Lost Child quest-->
;(After competing [[The Children of Vimara Village]])
:'''Amadhiah:''' It's [[Rana]]'s little guest. Well, Rana is a good guide, isn't she?
:{{DIcon}} Your vision...
::'''Amadhiah:''' Oh, my apologies. Now that I'm getting on in years, my eyes are not as sharp as they used to be. Everything is a blurry shadow to me. Luckily, my ears still work well...
::'''Amadhiah:''' I'm really sorry about before...
:{{DIcon}} About the children...
::'''Amadhiah:''' Oh, the "tiger cubs"? They are all good children, always full of energy... I wish them the blessings of [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]]. One day, they will grow up, safe and healthy.
:{{DIcon}} About Rana...
::'''Amadhiah:''' Rana... *sigh* She's been a smart girl since childhood... but sometimes she is too headstrong.
::'''Amadhiah:''' After becoming a [[Forest Watcher]], she's returned to the village less often. Forest Watchers are busy, I understand that. I'm just worried if she's getting enough rest...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Amadhiah:''' Well then, I won't keep you any longer...
::'''Amadhiah:''' Oh, one more thing, little guest. If you ever meet Rana, please remind her to take more rest...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #3===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After competing [[The Bad Guy in Vimara Village]])
:'''Amadhiah:''' It's Rana's little guest. If you're looking for Rana, she's gone on a trip and won't be back for a while.
:{{DIcon}} About Rana...
::'''Amadhiah:''' She returned all of a sudden, saying that she was to "go on a trip with a very, very important friend"...
::'''Amadhiah:''' She sounded very serious... Only those who have traveled understand the meaning of a journey. I hope she'll find what she's been looking for...
:{{DIcon}} About the musical instrument...
::'''Amadhiah:''' That instrument, huh? You can have it.
::'''Amadhiah:''' It belongs to wayfarers who travel like the wind. But it's been by my side for far too long.
::'''Amadhiah:''' Please let it sing in the woods, I guess that won't let the poet lady's goodwill go to waste...
:{{DIcon}} About your past...
::'''Amadhiah:''' Those are all stories of the past. I gave up on becoming an adventurer, but I don't regret it...
::'''Amadhiah:''' Every person has their own path in life...
:{{DIcon}} About Alphonso...
::'''Amadhiah:''' That child, Alphonso... Why did he leave without a word? He lived in Vimara Village for many years. Everyone said he's a good child...
::{{DIcon}} He might never come back again...
::'''Amadhiah:''' *sigh* He is a good child. Sometimes, he seemed preoccupied with something. I felt I was not in the position to ask...
::'''Amadhiah:''' I hope he will stop worrying about those things in the future.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Amadhiah:''' Well then, I won't keep you any longer...
