|text    = Come to think of it, I haven't seen you in a while, what a pity. Seems like you haven't encountered any legal predicaments that needed my stepping in.

Is that a good thing or a bad thing? I can't tell... If I were to say it's a good thing, it would make it seem like I don't want to see you, so I can't say it's a good thing. But if I say it is a bad thing, it's like I expect you to get into trouble, and I wouldn't want that.

This is another dilemma that is difficult to deconstruct rationally.

To be honest, I'm not sure who is the elder and who is the junior between the two of us.

Well, let's not get carried away by these little nuances. Here, take this [[Guide to Prosperity]]. No matter where you venture off to, don't forget what people pursue in the [[Liyue|land of Geo]].

If you are willing to keep one other thing in mind, such as today being my birthday, I wouldn't mind.

Anyway, remember to study hard and work harder!
