The '''Kätzlein Bloodline''', also called the '''Kätzlein Lineage''', is a family that has been in [[Springvale]] for at least three hundred years, where the hunter [[Olaf]] lived before being accidentally preserved in ice. They are a line of renowned hunters, from Olaf to his descendant, [[Draff]].

==History ==
They are a family who are well known for their feline features, as well as their hunting prowess.<ref name="Umbertail">{{Ref/Wildlife|Umbertail Falcon}}</ref> Skills such as infiltration, archery, climbing, and dodging come naturally to members of the bloodline.<ref name="Diona Story 3">{{Ref/CS|Diona|3}}</ref> They have keen eyes<ref name="Umbertail" /> that are able to see well in the dark. The feline features of members of the Kätzlein bloodline are exceedingly rare in [[Mondstadt]], leading [[Dr. Edith]] to write about them in "Studies of Bloodlines Strange and Unfamiliar."<ref name="Diona Story 3" /> Diona falsely claims that everyone in the Kätzlein lineage has a [[Vision]], but she is the only member known to have one.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Diona|About the Vision: Heirloom}}</ref>
[[Sucrose]], a young woman with similar cat-like features, often wondered if she had shared ancestry with Diona, and many people would ask her about it. Through observation, she determined that her feline features were of a similar genome to the Kätzleins but a different ancestry.<ref name="Sucrose Story 2">{{Ref/CS|Sucrose|2}}</ref>
