'''Durin''' was a shadow [[dragon]] created by the alchemist "Gold" [[Rhinedottir]].<ref name="BAtF">{{Ref/Book|Breeze Amidst the Forest}}</ref><ref name="SAS1">{{Ref/Quest|The Snowy Past}}</ref> Five hundred years ago, during the [[cataclysm]], he invaded [[Mondstadt]] and was slain by the might of [[Dvalin]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Skyward Blade}}</ref> His corpse fell over the mountain of Vindagnyr, thereafter leading the mountain to become known as [[Dragonspine]].

Durin's blood was highly toxic and contained power from the [[Abyss]]. This blood was one of the catalysts that led to Dvalin's resurgence as "Stormterror" during the events of the {{Quest|Prologue}}.

==Profile==
Durin had a gentle heart and dreamed of befriending the people of Mondstadt, hoping to share with them the stories of his creator and his birth. He was apparently unconscious of his destructive actions in Mondstadt and genuinely believed that his poisonous blood was a "great blessing," seeing the events of his rampage as a "very, very long dream" in which he sang and danced with Dvalin, [[Barbatos]], and the people of Mondstadt. Even after he woke to find that he had been dealt a killing blow by Dvalin, Durin held no ill will toward Dvalin or Barbatos and only wished that they could have met under better circumstances.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Festering Desire}}</ref><ref name="dragonspine spear">{{Ref/Weapon|Dragonspine Spear}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Durin is depicted as a disfigured, black skeletal dragon with glowing red eyes. His wings have long veins running along the folds. Judging from his skeletal remains around Dragonspine, Durin is almost as large as the great snowy mountain itself.

==Story==
===History===
Durin was created by Rhinedottir in the land of [[Khaenri'ah]] and classified under "Humus."<ref>{{Ref/Item|Concealed Unguis}}</ref> Of her many creations, she considered Durin to be one of her "miraculous creations" alongside [[Albedo]], who would not come into being until after the cataclysm.<ref name="SAS1" /> She had, however, started the Primordial Human Project to create synthetic humans before Durin's invasion of [[Teyvat]]; [[Primordial Albedo]], her first attempt, was considered a failure and left inside Durin.<ref name="SAS2">{{Ref/Quest|The Shadows Deepen}}</ref>

Five hundred years ago, during the cataclysm, Durin emerged in Mondstadt and caused much devastation. The [[Knights of Favonius]] at the time had been preoccupied with a campaign in Khaenri'ah and suffered great casualties during the expedition; Wolf Pup [[Rostam]] perished in battle and Grand Master [[Arundolyn]] gave up fighting in his grief. This left no one capable of defending the nation from Durin's rampage. Hearing the pleas of his people, Barbatos awoke and summoned Dvalin to come to their aid.<ref name="BAtF" />

Barbatos and Dvalin fought together against Durin, luring him over the perpetually-snowy mountain of Vindagnyr. Dvalin ultimately managed to land a decisive blow by piercing Durin's neck with his fangs, and Durin was sent plummeting to the area now known as [[Wyrmrest Valley]].<ref>Version 1.2 Website: [https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/ys/event/e20201216new/index.html "The Chalk Prince and the Dragon"]</ref>

===Legacy===
The mountain where Durin's corpse landed, previously known as Vindagnyr, thereafter became known as [[Dragonspine]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Skyward Spine}}</ref> Durin's blood has soaked into Dragonspine's [[Ley Line]]s,<ref>{{Ref/Item|Festering Dragon Marrow}}</ref> reviving the [[Frostbearing Tree]] which had been destroyed eons earlier by [[Celestia]]'s [[Skyfrost Nail]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Frostbearer}}</ref> Durin's heart is still "active" underneath Wyrmrest Valley, and his life energy has also spread throughout the valley.<ref>{{Ref/Location|Wyrmrest Valley}}</ref> Consequences of this include the formation of [[Crimson Agate]] and [[Scarlet Quartz]]: the former is a result of Durin's life energy interacting with shards of the broken Frostbearing Tree,<ref>{{Ref/Item|Crimson Agate}}</ref> while the latter seems to be a form of gemstone made from Durin's remains, containing his blood toxins.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Enigmatic Page (V)}}</ref> Parts of Durin were used to forge the cursed sword [[Festering Desire]].<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/dzpmNU8WJVg?t=14 Version 1.2 Trailer]</ref>

Dvalin, worn out from the battle and in pain from the poisoned blood he ingested, fell into a deep slumber in [[Decarabian]]'s tower. He would eventually wake up to find a Mondstadt that had forgotten him, making him susceptible to the [[Abyss Order]]'s lies that Barbatos had abandoned him. During the events of the Prologue Chapter, a reawakened [[Venti]] &mdash; Barbatos' vessel &mdash; would join forces with the [[Traveler]], [[Jean]], and [[Diluc]] to foil the Abyss Order's plot and restore Dvalin to his senses. Twice, Venti plays a tune explaining Dvalin's transformation into "Stormterror," during which Venti recounts the battle against Durin.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|That Green Fellow}}</ref>

Primordial Albedo eventually broke free from Durin's stomach. After he discovered the existence of a "successful" Albedo, he began conspiring to take the latter's place. To that end, he took on Albedo's appearance and used Durin's blood to create a [[Fellflower]], a heavily mutated [[Cryo Whopperflower]], having it take on the form of Albedo as well to serve as a distraction, although it was destroyed during the events of ''[[Shadows Amidst Snowstorms]]''.<ref name="SAS2" />

The [[Fatui]] have secret plans for Durin's heart in Wyrmrest Valley, though the Traveler ends up interfering when they arrive.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Festering Fang}}</ref>

[[Andersdotter]] later created [[Mini Durin]] based on the real-life Durin who would end up having a similar experience to what Durin had. Mini Durin had a much happier ending and was able to get his wish by becoming small in order to be less threatening to the people of [[Simulanka]]. According to a conversation by Andersdotter and Barbeloth that the [[Wanderer]] recalled, Barbeloth prophesized that R's child would return from the dead, referring to Durin. While the Wanderer expressed doubt that the memory was genuine, Albedo noted that Durin's heart was slowly revitalizing itself and could potentially revive in the foreseeable future.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Afterword (Summertide Scales and Tales)}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* Durin's skull faces towards the west-northwest, where [[Celestia]] floats above. [[Roald]] the Adventurer wondered if Durin still "yearns for the celestial heights."<ref>{{Ref/Book|Diary of Roald the Adventurer|9|Dragonspine}}</ref>
* Durin is likely the "evil dragon that once wrought havoc on a neighboring land" whose dried but still highly potent blood is allegedly in a bottle that [[Linlang]] shows to the Traveler in her regular nighttime dialogue. The only other known dragon that might fit the description is [[Ursa the Drake]], and Ursa's blood is not known to be venomous, unlike Durin's blood.

===Etymology===
* In Norse mythology, both {{w|Durinn|Durin}} and {{w|Dvalinn|Dvalin}} are dwarves first mentioned in the {{w|Poetic Edda|''Poetic Edda''}}. In the {{w|Hervarar saga}}, Durin forges the mythical sword Tyrfing with Dvalin's help.
* According to the description of the [[Concealed Unguis]], Durin was classified as "Humus." In {{w|soil science}}, humus is formed when dead plant and animal matter within soil is broken down even further by {{w|Anaerobic organism|anaerobes}}, becoming dark in color. The presence of humus in soil helps boost its fertility.
