{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hanqian:''' Hah... Training is the only way to pack more power behind that punch! Gotta keep going!
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Hanqian:''' I'm one of the leaders of the Sword and Strongbox Secure Transport Agency. As it stands now, you can think of me as half an owner.
::'''Hanqian:''' Let me tell you... There used to be three of us leaders, and we were all very good.
::'''Hanqian:''' At our peak, we were in charge of almost half of the orders here in Yilong Wharf.
::'''Hanqian:''' After we started working with the [[Communications Office]], the best leader among the three of us lost his drive, and just hung around all day.
::'''Hanqian:''' He used to be the kind of guy who would train under a waterfall to discipline himself. I can't for the life of me figure out what happened.
::'''Hanqian:''' Another was ambushed by bandits and took almost a full year to recover. He's no longer as good as he was, so I'm the only one left.
::'''Hanqian:''' The owner saw what happened and decided to just go hands-off on us.
::'''Hanqian:''' We'll just have to wait until the newly recruited guards for hire are ready and see if things improve.
::'''Hanqian:''' Speaking of which... [[Dip Yeuk]] isn't slacking off, is he? And I wonder how [[Huang the Third]] is doing.
::'''Hanqian:''' *sigh* I do spend my days just worrying about things, don't I?
::{{DIcon}} What are the recruiting standards for guards?
::'''Hanqian:''' Good question.
::'''Hanqian:''' You must be agile, patient, good with directions, observant, and have a quick mind. These are all necessary qualities.
::'''Hanqian:''' You need them to defeat bandits and monsters while on a job, so you can escort whatever you're delivering to the destination safely.
::'''Hanqian:''' Most importantly, and many ignore this, you need to have chivalry.
::'''Hanqian:''' You must not be tempted by money. There was once a real scumbag who colluded with the bandits during a job and seized the goods.
::'''Hanqian:''' Many guards went after him as a result, handing him his sorry arse before handing him over to the [[Millelith]].
::'''Hanqian:''' The stuff he stole? Returned, and he was forced to pay all he had as compensation &mdash; on top of spending the rest of his life in prison.
::'''Hanqian:''' Anyway, I digress. You must be chivalrous and righteous.
:{{DIcon}} About training methodologies...
::'''Hanqian:''' You don't look like some Millelith elite. An adventurer, then?
::'''Hanqian:''' If you ask me, we, the Millelith troops, and adventurers face different challenges, so our training programs emphasize different things.
::'''Hanqian:''' For a guard, everything is about stamina. Endurance and weight training are extremely important.
::'''Hanqian:''' You can ask Gaming about it if you'd like.
::'''Hanqian:''' He's not the most muscular one, but his stamina, strength, and explosive power are second to none.
::'''Hanqian:''' Maybe it's because he often practices [[Wushou Dance]], which requires precise movements and core strength to get through any given show.
::'''Hanqian:''' But I can't train like him, so I improve my stamina in the most basic way possible.
:{{DIcon}} Bye, I'm off to train too!
::'''Hanqian:''' You look pretty motivated. Let's take it to the next level!
