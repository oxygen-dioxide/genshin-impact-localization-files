|- id = "Favonius Cathedral"
| [[Favonius Cathedral]]
| Once a place for the nobles to look down on the poor and weak, the Favonius Cathedral is now a place where the poor and weak can be taken care of and assisted. Even scholars and enthusiasts come from all over the world to see it.

|- id = "Sealed Doorway"
| [[Sealed Doorway]]
| On the southern end of the city (a bit beyond [[Schulz's Blacksmith]]), there is a door with a Hydro seal over it. Speaking to [[Goth]] reveals that it is one of his properties, but because someone placed the seal over it, he cannot lease it until someone breaks the seal. While the seal is active, interacting with the door leads to the following dialogue:<br />{{Dialogue start}}<br />'''Examine the door:''' (This door seems to be locked by a curious seal. What is this place, really?)<br />{{Dialogue end}}<br />During [[Mona]]'s first [[Story Quest]], "[[Beyond This World's Stars]]," she breaks the seal on the house and rents it. You are able to interact with Mona through the door, but after the quest ends and you leave the area, the house is no longer interactable.

|- id = "Anemo Archon Statue Plaza"
| [[Anemo Archon Statue]]
| The Anemo Archon Statue is located at the plaza in front of the Favonius Cathedral. It features a giant statue of Barbatos that is climbable, and people can sit on the hands. Several events occurred here, including the offering of the Windblume flower and parts of Venti's story quest.<br /><br />The player can initiate a minigame that involves running through hoops around the plaza perimeter. Running through all the hoops will grant a [[Chest]].
