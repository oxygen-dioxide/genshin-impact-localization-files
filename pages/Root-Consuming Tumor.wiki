{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1         = Barrier
|desc_1         = The tumor starts with a barrier that protects itself from DMG. To remove the barrier, small tumors around the Root-Consuming Tumor must be destroyed first using the [[Xenochromatic Ball Octopus]]' ability. Once the barrier is destroyed, the tumor can then be damaged using the aforementioned ability. At certain HP percentages, the tumor will regain its barrier and summon new waves of small tumors.

|name_2         = Counterattack
|desc_2         = If hit by the player while its barrier is active, launches a counterattack in the form of a murky projectile, dealing '''2 × [[Level Multiplier]]''' as {{Color|True Physical DMG}}.
