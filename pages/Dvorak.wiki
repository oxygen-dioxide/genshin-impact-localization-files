==Profile==
Dvorak is one of the main organizers of the [[Iridescence Tour]]. Originally from Fontaine, he spends a lot of time on the road due to his job.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Thousand Miles for an Enigmatic Tune}}</ref>

Dvorak said that he was in [[Ritou]] while the war was going on in Inazuma.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|This Ain't Your Daddy's Iridescence Tour...}}</ref> Later on, according to the Puppy Union Admission Details that [[Heizou]] had given to the Traveler, it was revealed that Dvorak was one of the many people who were rescued from the warzone, with his codename being ''Unagi No. 9''. He was 40 years old during the events of that war.<ref>Event [[Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness/Story]]</ref>

===Appearance===
Dvorak wears a maroon coat, maroon top hat, and a golden monocle among other things. His outfit has many musical motifs all over it. He carries a black acoustic guitar around on his back. <!--(Expand and rewrite)-->
