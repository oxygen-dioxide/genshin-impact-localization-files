'''Vishaps''' are a species of [[dragon]]-like creatures that once followed each of the [[Seven Sovereigns]] with their corresponding elements and were formerly the dominant race of the world.

From each vishap species, the Seven Sovereigns will be born anew, so long as they remain biologically pure.

They belonged to the [[Light Realm|Vishap Realm]], also known as the Elemental Realm or the Light Realm.

==Types==
===Lords===
'''Azhdaha''' is the lord of the Geovishaps.
* {{Enemy|Azhdaha}}
The '''[[Dragon of Water]]''' is the lord of the Bathysmal Vishaps. Due to Bathysmal Vishaps' forced changes to Cryo and Electro, they are now biologically impure and an Enkanomiyan prophecy claims that the Dragon of Water will be born anew as a human.

===Geovishaps===
The '''Geovishaps''' are a species of Vishaps that live in the mountains of [[Liyue]] and have inhabited since a bygone era, along with their lord, [[Azhdaha]]. They have attuned with the [[Geo]] element and are capable of using multiple elements without the need for evolution through the energy of the ley lines.

==Etymology==
* Vishap is derived from the Armenian {{Lang|hy=Վիշապ|hy_rm=Vishap|mini=1}}, an indigenous name for dragons, specifically those from Armenian Mythology. Armenian dragons are traditionally imagined to be serpentine creatures, metaphysical manifestations in the world with ties to elements, commonly water and related concepts such as rain, thunderstorms and fertility.<ref>Armenian Wikipedia: [https://hy.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D5%8E%D5%AB%D5%B7%D5%A1%D5%BA_(%D5%A3%D5%A5%D6%80%D5%A2%D5%B6%D5%A1%D5%AF%D5%A1%D5%B6_%D5%A7%D5%A1%D5%AF) Armenian Vishaps (Dragons)]</ref>
