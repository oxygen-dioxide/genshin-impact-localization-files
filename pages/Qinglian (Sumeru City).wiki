==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Qinglian:''' Maybe there could be a market for cosmetics made from gemstones back in [[Liyue]]...
:{{DIcon}} Cosmetics? Made from gemstones?
::'''Qinglian:''' That's right, people in [[Sumeru]] will grind down gemstones into a powder to make cosmetics with. It's supposed to be good for skincare.
::'''Qinglian:''' It seems there are researchers who specialize in studying the skincare effects of different gemstone powders on varied skin types.
::'''Qinglian:''' But because the gemstones they use are so expensive and often need to be imported from Liyue, this is something quite luxurious that only the wealthy in Sumeru can enjoy.
::'''Qinglian:''' It got me thinking, Liyue has an abundance of precious ores. If this practice could be brought back there, it's possible it could open up a whole new market...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Qinglian:''' See you, I've really got to study this...
