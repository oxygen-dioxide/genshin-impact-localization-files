'''Altar of Primal Flame''' is an exploration mechanic in [[Natlan]]. It is a large brazier that holds the primal flame, [[Phlogiston]]. Offering [[Pyrophosphorite]] (or [[Tutorial/Crackling Mysterious Firestone|similar]]) to it can trigger certain mechanisms.

There are two known Altars of Primal Flame, both located in [[Ochkanatlan]]. Offering to the first altar opens up a path to the [[Legendary Tonatiuh]], while offering to the second altar grants access to the [[Jade of Return]]. They are both encountered during the {{Quest|Lost Traveler in the Ashen Realm}}.

==Lore==
[[Waxaklahun Ubah Kan]] once used the promise of treasure to lure heroes to the Tonatiuh. It is implied that many past adventurers did successfully use the first Altar of Primal Flame to reach the sky-ship, only to perish at the Sage's hands. This was the fate of the [[Ochkanatlan Adventure Team]], and later, [[Bona]].<ref name="MOA">{{Ref/Quest|Moment of Awakening}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* Once the Golden Entreaty is retrieved from the altar on the Tonatiuh, its flame goes out. The other altar continues to burn.
