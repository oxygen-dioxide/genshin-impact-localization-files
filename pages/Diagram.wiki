'''Diagrams''' or '''Forging Blueprints''' are similar to [[recipe]]s, but are used for [[forging]]. Once used the player will learn to make the associated gadget.

Diagrams are earned through the [[reputation]] system and were introduced with it. With later updates diagrams also became available through [[quest]]s, [[chest]]s and the [[Frostbearing Tree]]. The diagram's rarity is equal to the forgeable item's rarity.

Like [[recipe]]s and [[instructions]], diagrams follow a clear naming pattern of "Diagram: <Item you will be able to forge>".
