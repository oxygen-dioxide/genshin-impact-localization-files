*When you first download the game client on a mobile device, only the voice-over resources corresponding to your device's system language will be downloaded initially by default. (Example: Devices where the system language is set to English will download only English voice-over resources by default.) When you update the game client on a mobile device, voice-over resources will be downloaded for both the voice-over language corresponding to your device's system language and the currently selected voice-over language in the game. (Example: If your device's system language is set to English and you have selected Japanese voice-over in the game, both English and Japanese voice-over resources will be downloaded when you update the game.)

*Fixes an issue whereby Ice Cage, Vacuum Vortex, Rumbling Stone, Lightning Stake, Pursuing Fireball, Mist Bubble, and other monster skill effects may incorrectly remain after the monster is defeated.

*Fixes an issue with [[Tartaglia]] whereby after applying the Riptide status to a monster, removing the character from the party and adding him back in may incorrectly trigger the Riptide effect that was previously applied.
*Fixes an issue whereby [[Albedo]]'s Level 6 Constellation "Dust of Purification" may not take effect properly.
*Fixes an issue with [[Qiqi]]'s animation on the [[Dressing Room]] screen.
*Fixes an issue with Qiqi whereby casting the Elemental Skill "[[Adeptus Art: Herald of Frost]]" in the same location multiple times consecutively may cause the skill's effects to disappear.

*Fixes an issue whereby when a character uses a [[Plunging Attack]], they may become obstructed by a [[Geo construct]] and unable to perform any other actions.
*Fixes an issue whereby if a character is hit by a monster while jumping, the character may be launched far away.
*Fixes an issue whereby performing a [[Plunging Attack]] may not reduce the fall damage sustained by the character as intended.
*Fixes an issue whereby character animations may be incorrect when walking up and down steps.
*Fixes an issue with [[Noelle]]'s Passive Talent "[[Devotion]]" whereby its cooldown does not function correctly.
*Fixes an issue affecting characters with shield skills whereby generating a shield, then switching character, then removing the character who generated the shield from the party may cause errors with the shield's duration.
*Fixes an issue whereby closing the PC game client while a character's shield is active then logging back in to the game may cause errors with the shield's duration.

This issue will be fixed in a later version update. Please stay tuned for future notices regarding the exact fix time.
#When switching characters while protected by a [[shield]], there is a small chance that the character who takes the field will be launched if hit by an attack with a rather strong interrupt effect at the moment of switching. This issue will be fixed in a later version update. Please stay tuned for future notices regarding the exact fix time.
#Casting characters' skills while using the [[Windsong Lyre]] gadget may cause errors with the skills' effects. This issue will be fixed in a later version update. Please stay tuned for future notices regarding the exact fix time.
