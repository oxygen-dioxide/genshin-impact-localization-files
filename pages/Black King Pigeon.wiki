|description = A common avian species in Teyvat. Plump and meaty, but can also be trained to deliver messages.<br>A relatively common pigeon that takes its name from its black-colored head. It is braver and more prone to confrontation than other birds in the pigeon family making it easier to catch. Its meat is dense and flavorful, making it well-suited to roasting.
