==Profile==
Iian is the storyteller at Third-Round Knockout. He frequently narrates various stories to the customers there, the most notable of them being Zhongli.

He was [[Tea Master Liu Su]]'s junior, but they have broken ties ever since Liu Siu began storytelling at the [[Heyu Tea House]].

===Personality===
Tian enjoys telling stories; unlike his senior Liu Su, he narrates them to all types of people, believing that the art of storytelling is part of street culture. By elevating it to the higher class, he feels that it is wrong and is instead a way to become famous and wealthy.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' [[Tea Master Liu Su]] was once my senior. He loves to tell elegant, high-flown stories.
:'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' Me? I don't truck with him and his faux-cultured fellows. What, are the common people unworthy of the storyteller's art, now?
:{{DIcon}} (Listen in)
::'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' I don't like the way he rarifies storytelling. This art was originally part of street culture.
::'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' It's like trying to turn offal from the street kitchens into divine elixir... It's just wrong-headed.
::'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' Those who aren't familiar with the art might be entertained<!--"entertainment" in-game-->, but all the old patrons in attendance know that it's got none of storytelling's original flavor.
::{{DIcon}} (Keep listening)
::'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' So I'm not sour at all that my senior is famous and earns a lot of money.
::'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' In front of my old patrons, I daresay this much&mdash;
::'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' Were I to go to the Heyu Tea Whatever today and give an oration...
:{{DIcon}} (Stop listening)
::'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' Don't be so skeptical. If I were to go to Heyu Tea House and speak before the ladies and gentlemen of Yujing Terrace...
