==Steps==
# Talk to [[Sefana]] (optional)
# Purify all [[Sunyata Flower]]s
# Report to Sefana

==Gameplay Notes==
* Sorush's dialogue changes greatly depending on whether or not ''[[Khvarena of Good and Evil]]'' has been completed.
* Completing this Hidden Exploration Objective awards the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement ''[[The Sea of Fertility]]''.
* [[Amrita Mayfly|Amrita Mayflies]] will spawn around purified Sunyata Flowers at night (18:00 - 6:00). [[Sorush (Gadget)|Sorush]] can collect stunned Mayflies and touch Sunyata Flowers to revitalize them, causing a Precious Chest to spawn per Sunyata field.

;(Approach any Sunyata Flower)
:'''Paimon:''' Look over here, {{Traveler}}. Doesn't this flower look kinda special?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon can't help but think that [[Sorush]] should recognize it!
:'''Sorush:''' Hah. This is a Sunyata Flower. Most common amongst us [[Pari]]. I believe that young Sefana has always been caring for them.
:'''Sorush:''' However, this one is not in good shape. I shall aid her in caring for it, and we shall discuss its secrets later.

;(If the player purifies a Sunyata Flower before speaking to Sefana)
:'''Paimon:''' Not bad, Sorush! You really made the area regain its vitality real quick, huh?
:{{DIcon}} Pari powers are quite fascinating, yes.
:'''Sorush:''' You startle pointlessly! My powers are more than enough to easily rescue the Sunyata Flower!
:'''Sorush:''' The dark corrosion expands yet, and these Sunyata Flowers are but one amongst its many victims...
:'''Sorush:''' The other flower ponds have not been spared. Sefana must be in quite the fluster at this moment.
:'''Paimon:''' This Sefana you mentioned seems like a nice Pari who works hard to take care of the flowers...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go help her, shall we, {{Traveler}}?
:'''Sorush:''' Well now, I suppose it may serve as a suitable diversion upon my great work. In that case, my Yasnapati, I bid you have a care for Sunyata Flowers of this kind.
:{{DIcon}} I'll tell you when I see them.
:'''Paimon:''' Yup! Let's save these pretty flowers together!
----
;(Talk to Sefana, before purifying all Sunyata Flowers)
:'''Sefana:''' *sigh* Is this... the power of darkness?
:'''Sefana:''' Such terrible strength... resistance may as well be futile...
:'''Sorush:''' Pull yourself together, Sefana! What is with all this fear and trembling?
:'''Sefana:''' Wait, do my eyes deceive me? ... It's you, Sister Sorush! You're back!
:'''Sefana:''' Ah, the Sunyata Flowers are saved... I've been waiting for so long, and hope has finally arrived!
:'''Sefana:''' You won't suddenly leave again, will you? You won't be gone for a long, long time, right? Right?
:'''Sorush:''' Cease your fretting, Sefana. My comings and goings are of no importance. What is important is that I and my Yasnapati, {{Traveler}}, have come to make up for your failings.
:'''Sorush:''' I pursue the great task of extinguishing [[the Sign of Apaosha]], and shall surely eliminate this dark corrosion and rescue all our flower ponds. But remember, Sefana, this was on account of your failings!
:'''Sefana:''' I... I know it's my fault...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, so Sefana calls Sorush "Sister"... But don't you think this big sister is too strict? Ugh, she's so unlovable...
:'''Sorush:''' Such immaturity! It is the duty of one senior to give pointers to their juniors. How can I speak softly to them in the face of such errors?
:'''Sefana:''' That... That's right! Sister Sorush has always taken good care of me...
:'''Sefana:''' The words Sister Sorush said before the Sunyata Flower... "I shall be [[Simurgh]]'s equal"... They encouraged me more than any teachings might.
:'''Sefana:''' From that day on, I have believed that her will was most commendable.
:'''Sefana:''' That's why I decided to follow the human custom of addressing one's elders when it comes to her, to show my respect!
:'''Paimon:''' What a gentle Pari you are... Paimon can't imagine Sorush getting lectured by another Pari and still calling her "Sister" after that...
:'''Sorush:''' P&mdash;Preposterous!
:{{DIcon}} Let's get back on topic, please.
:{{DIcon}} So, as for the Sunyata Flowers...
:'''Sefana:''' Right, Sister. Does your Yasnapati not understand much about the Sunyata Flowers? Perhaps I can introduce them, on behalf of the elders...
:'''Sefana:''' There was a Pari who once sang thus&mdash;
:'''Sefana:''' "This coalescence of color is the miraculous sign of the flowing spring of life"...
:'''Sefana:''' "Linger here with me, dance and sing with me, let us weave lasting joy"...
:'''Sefana:''' ...And I've forgotten the rest.
:'''Sefana:''' I've spent too long guarding against the encroachment of this defilement. My exhaustion is clouding my mind...
:'''Paimon:''' Don't push yourself too much! It doesn't matter if you can't remember some quotations. Just say stuff in a more relaxed way!
:'''Sefana:''' Well then, let me think... Though the Sunyata Flowers are not the most precious thing within the Vourukasha Oasis, they are exceedingly dear companions to our people.
:'''Sefana:''' Many Pari spend time with those flowers after they've finished their work for the day.
:'''Sefana:''' It would be like a human growing up alongside those creatures that go "Meow-meow" and "Woof-woof"...
:{{DIcon}} You means cats and dogs?
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, so that's how it is. Y'know, if Paimon had one of those as a pet for a while, and it got sick, Paimon would be really sad too.
:'''Paimon:''' Never mind what might happen if it was Paimon's only friend...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon understands your urgency now, Sefana. The health of the Sunyata Flowers is definitely important!
:'''Sorush:''' What a shallow, coarse analogy. The importance of the Sunyata Flowers is far beyond such. Your choice of words still requires some work, Sefana.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh, there's no need to be so picky, we understood what she said, anyway! Anyway, there's no time to delay. Let's go!
:{{DIcon}} Time to save some pretty flowers!
:{{DIcon}} Time to save the Pari's pets!
:'''Sorush:''' Wait here, Sefana. You shall soon hear glad tidings from us.
:'''Sorush:''' It will not be long before I shall show forth my might and free the Sunyata Flowers from the clutches of this darkness.
:'''Sefana:''' Th&mdash;Thank you all very much!
:'''Sefana:''' Not only have I troubled Sister Sorush, but also our great Yasnapati... and on our first meeting too... I must prepare some gifts for you in return...

;(Talk to Sefana again, optional)
:'''Sefana:''' Sister Sorush must know how to revitalize Sunyata Flowers.
:'''Sefana:''' What a relief! Thank you so much!
----
;(After purifying all Sunyata Flowers)
;(If the player has not spoken to Sefana)
::'''Sorush:''' All the Sunyata Flowers have been revitalized. We have helped Sefana solve her problems before she even knew of it.
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm... if we get the chance, let's inform this Sefana you mentioned of what happened!
;(If the player has met Sefana)
::'''Sorush:''' Excellent. Now all the Sunyata Flowers have been revitalized.
::'''Paimon:''' All right, now that's a wrap! Let's head back and look for Sefana!

{{Tabber

|{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Report to Sefana)
:'''Paimon:''' We're back, Sefana!
:'''Sorush:''' The Sunyata Flowers have been purged of their defilement. You need not worry any longer.
:'''Sefana:''' That's wonderful, Sister Sorush! You've always been so reliable.
:'''Sefana:''' And you too, great Yasnapati {{Traveler}}! I have prepared a gift for you...
:'''Sefana:''' I picked up some shiny objects while caring for the Sunyata Flowers. I have heard that humans and their meow-meows and woof-woofs love them...
:'''Paimon:''' Would that be... Mora? Paimon wouldn't mind some if that were the case!
:'''Sefana:''' What gift could I get you, Sister Sorush?
:'''Sorush:''' How shallow, Sefana! What I did was out of a commitment to my great work. I require not your tokens of gratitude. You should instead focus on keeping yourself and the Sunyata Flowers in good shape.
:'''Paimon:''' Sorush means to say that you don't have to feel in debt and... should take good care of yourself? She does sound like a big sister now...
:{{DIcon}} Showing love and care doesn't seem to be Sorush's strong suit...
:{{DIcon}} Maybe she was once very nice to Sefana...
:'''Sorush:''' Nonsense! I was merely cautioning Sefana not to fail in her duty.
:'''Sorush:''' To use an analogy that humans can understand, both Sunyata Flowers and Pari hail from the dewdrops of the [[Harvisptokhm]]. And that makes us family.
:'''Sorush:''' The Pari who watch over the Sunyata Flowers are exposed to the constant encroachment of the defilement, so they must be wary of any bodily harm it may incur.
:'''Sorush:''' Despite Sefana's failings, she has guarded the Sunyata Flowers for a long time, and I shan't simply write her off.
:{{DIcon}} "Family"...
:{{DIcon}} In that sense, they are very important, indeed...
:'''Paimon:''' Whatever the case, you do care about your junior, huh... Maybe there really is a gentle side to you, Sorush!
:'''Sefana:''' Gentle? Yes, I agree! Although Sister Sorush always says terrible things, she often helps me solve my problems too. She is a caring senior!
:'''Sorush:''' Preposterous... Such absurd diction is forbidden from now on!
:'''Sorush:''' And that's all. We still have to extinguish the Sign of Apaosha. Now, enough with the chit-chat. It's time we parted ways with Sefana.
:'''Sorush:''' Once I carry out the great work of eliminating the power of darkness, the Vourukasha Oasis will recover its pure and pristine hues.
:'''Sefana:''' Ah, are you leaving now? Then... I wish you the best of luck.
:'''Sefana:''' I will wait for you, Sister Sorush, great Yasnapati {{Traveler}}, and the Pale Companion!
:'''Sefana:''' Next time we meet, I'll tell many, many stories about Sister Sorush to the great Yasnapati and the Pale Companion. Do hear them out!
:'''Sorush:''' Hmph... I doubt there will be a "next time". But if you do get to tell my stories, feel free to share anything you know, as it will help flesh out my Yasnapati's record of my great undertakings.

;(Report to Sefana)
:'''Sefana:''' The power of darkness hasn't been fully stopped... But all flower ponds have been purified and regained vitality...
:'''Sefana:''' What is happening? Is someone helping me?
:'''Sefana:''' If it's true, maybe the [[Harvisptokhm]] has graced me and these ponds with her blessings... How fortunate we are!
:'''Sorush:''' It has been some time, Sefana.
:'''Sefana:''' Wait, do my eyes deceive me? ... It's you, Sister Sorush! You're back!
:'''Sefana:''' You won't suddenly leave again, will you? You won't be gone for a long, long time, right? Right?
:'''Sorush:''' Calm down. My comings and goings are not the point. What is important is that I and my Yasnapati, {{Traveler}}, have come to inform you that we've made up for your failings.
:'''Sorush:''' I pursue the great task of extinguishing the Sign of Apaosha, and along the way, I eliminated this dark corrosion and rescued all our flower ponds. But remember, Sefana, this was on account of your failings!
:'''Sefana:''' S&mdash;So it is all thanks to you, Sister Sorush!
:'''Sefana:''' I... I am sorry...
:'''Sefana:''' I cannot thank you enough... I've always had butterflies in my stomach this whole time, and now I can finally breathe easy!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, so Sefana calls Sorush "Sister"... But don't you think this big sister is too strict? Ugh, she's so unlovable...
:'''Sorush:''' Such immaturity! It is the duty of one senior to give pointers to their juniors. How can I speak softly to them in the face of such errors?

;(Immediately after the previous dialogue)
:'''Sorush:''' Excellent. The daytime Sunyata Flower has regained its vitality.
:'''Sorush:''' It also emits light of a different vibrance after night falls. Yasnapati, if your timing shall be amenable, you may come back to witness it.

|After completing Khvarena of Good and Evil
|{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach any Sunyata Flower)
:'''Paimon:''' Look over here, {{Traveler}}. Doesn't this flower look kinda special?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon can't help but think that [[Sorush]] should recognize it!
:'''Sorush:''' Indeed, this is the Sunyata Flower that Sefana has been caring for.
:'''Sorush:''' However, it is not in good shape, and is being corroded by the remnants of that dark power. I will find a way to purify it, and then we shall speak further.

;(If the player purifies a Sunyata Flower before speaking to Sefana)
:'''Paimon:''' Not bad, Sorush! You really made the area regain its vitality real quick, huh?
:{{DIcon}} [[Pari]] powers are quite fascinating, yes.
:'''Sorush:''' Of course, many Pari know how to bring Sunyata Flowers to life by heart.
:'''Sorush:''' Simply put, even though [[the Sign of Apaosha]] has disappeared, this Sunyata Flower hasn't recovered from its corrosion and it's still extremely feeble...
:'''Sorush:''' The other flower ponds are unlikely to be spared. This must be very upsetting for Sefana.
:'''Paimon:''' This Sefana you mentioned must be a nice Pari who works hard to take care of the flowers!
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go help her, shall we, {{Traveler}}?
:'''Sorush:''' For me, it's nothing too difficult, and it'll help out Sefana. My Yasnapati, please keep an eye out for these Sunyata Flowers.
:{{DIcon}} I'll tell you when I see them.
:'''Paimon:''' Yup! Let's save these pretty flowers together!
----
;(Talk to Sefana, before purifying all Sunyata Flowers)
:'''Sefana:''' *sigh* Is this... the corrosive power of the dark remnants?
:'''Sefana:''' Such terrible strength... I can't do anything against it no matter how hard I try...
:'''Sorush:''' It has been some time, Sefana.
:'''Sefana:''' Wait, do my eyes deceive me? ... It's you, Sister Sorush! You're back!
:'''Sefana:''' The Sunyata Flowers are saved... Ah, I've been waiting for so long, and hope has finally arrived!
:'''Sefana:''' You won't suddenly leave again, will you? You won't be gone for a long, long time, right? Right?
:'''Sorush:''' Don't get so worked up, Sefana! I will help you rescue the Sunyata Flowers, fret not!
:'''Sorush:''' This is my Yasnapati, {{Traveler}}, and {{MC|m=his|f=her}} companion, Paimon.
:'''Sorush:''' We have already extinguished the Sign of Apaosha, and have rescued flower ponds from dark corrosion. Leave the ponds under your charge to us.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, that sure was straightforward! Given what Sefana calls you, you two sure seem like you have a close relationship!
:'''Sorush:''' Close? I would not say so... though we did spend some time together and share some experiences...
:'''Sefana:''' Hmm, while I'm not sure why you're speaking a little differently, Sorush, I'll have you two know that she took great care of me in the past!
:'''Sefana:''' She said before the Sunyata Flower... "I shall be [[Simurgh]]'s equal"... They encouraged me more than any teachings might.
:'''Sefana:''' From that day on, I have believed that her will was most commendable.
:'''Sefana:''' That's why I decided to follow the human custom of addressing one's elders, when it comes to her, to show my respect!
:'''Sefana:''' That sure gets Paimon thinking. Ah, she can see it now...
:'''Sorush:''' St&mdash;Stop mentioning things from so long ago!
:{{DIcon}} Let's take a quick gander back to our original topic...
:{{DIcon}} So, as for the Sunyata Flowers...
:'''Sefana:''' Right, Sister. Does your Yasnapati not understand much about the Sunyata Flowers? Perhaps I can introduce them, on behalf of the elders...
:'''Sefana:''' There was a Pari who once sang thus&mdash;
:'''Sefana:''' "This coalescence of color is the miraculous sign of the flowing spring of life"...

:'''Paimon:''' Paimon understands your urgency now, Sefana. The health of the Sunyata Flowers is definitely important!
:'''Sorush:''' Hmm... The importance of the Sunyata Flowers is far beyond such. You're still not all that good at analogies, Sefana.
:'''Paimon:''' Don't worry, we got the message. Since this is a serious issue, and Sorush is being so proactive, let's get going right away!
:{{DIcon}} Time to save some pretty flowers!
:{{DIcon}} Time to save the Pari's pets!
:'''Sorush:''' Just wait here for us, Sefana.
:'''Sorush:''' {{Traveler}} and I shall rid the Sunyata Flowers of the remaining defilement that plagues them shortly.
:'''Sefana:''' Th&mdash;Thank you all very much!
:'''Sefana:''' Not only have I troubled Sister Sorush, but also our great Yasnapati... and on our first meeting too... I must prepare some gifts for you in return...

;(Talk to Sefana again, optional)
:'''Sefana:''' Sister Sorush must know how to revitalize Sunyata Flowers.

:'''Paimon:''' That's surprisingly nice, and Sorush sounds like a big sister, too... You two do have a close relationship!
:{{DIcon}} Are you scared that Sefana may share a story or two about your past...
:{{DIcon}} Ahh, do share a few embarrassing incidents of hers!
:'''Sorush:''' I'm not trying to hide anything! I just genuinely want Sefana to take better care of herself!
:'''Sorush:''' After all, to use an analogy that humans can understand, both Sunyata Flowers and Pari hail from the dewdrops of the Harvisptokhm. And that makes us family.
:'''Sorush:''' The Pari who take care of the Sunyata Flowers are under the constant encroachment of the defilement, which is a great burden to bear.
:'''Sorush:''' Sefana is a tough soul, always shouldering the responsibility on her own. And she's also been respectful to me too. It's only natural that I want to take care of her.
:{{DIcon}} "Family"...
:{{DIcon}} In that sense, they are very important, indeed...
:'''Paimon:''' A caring Sorush, huh &mdash; Paimon didn't expect to see this gentle side of you!
:'''Sefana:''' Gentle? Yes, I agree! Sister Sorush often helps me solve my problems. She is a caring senior!
:'''Sorush:''' You should refrain from using this absurd way of wording things!
:'''Sorush:''' Ahem! Anyway, the threats to the Sunyata Flowers have been eliminated! I will pay you and these flowers a visit again someday, Sefana.
:'''Sorush:''' One day, the embers of the darkness shall be no more, and the pure and pristine colors shall return to the Vourukasha Oasis!
:'''Sefana:''' Ah, you've got other things to do? Then... best of luck to you!
:'''Sefana:''' I will always wait here for you, Sister Sorush, the great Yasnapati, and the Pale Companion!
:'''Sefana:''' Next time we meet, please allow me to share my experiences with Sister Sorush. There are so many interesting stories that I'd love to share!
:'''Sorush:''' That won't be necessary!

:'''Sorush:''' We have already extinguished the Sign of Apaosha and rescued all Sunyata Flowers from the clutches of the dark corrosion. They have been revitalized. You can rest assured now!
:'''Sefana:''' S&mdash;So it is all thanks to you, Sister Sorush!
:'''Sefana:''' I cannot thank you enough... I can finally breathe easy. I'm so touched!
:'''Paimon:''' Well, that sure was straightforward! Given what Sefana calls you, you two sure seem like you have a close relationship!
:'''Sorush:''' Close? I would not say so... though we did spend some time together and share some experiences.
:'''Sefana:''' Hmm, while I'm not sure why you're speaking a little differently, Sorush, I'll have you two know that she took great care of me in the past!
:'''Sefana:''' She said before the Sunyata Flower... "I shall be Simurgh's equal"... They encouraged me more than any teachings might.
:'''Sefana:''' From that day on, I have believed that her will was most commendable.
:'''Sefana:''' That's why I decided to follow the human custom of addressing one's elders, when it comes to her, to show my respect!
:'''Sefana:''' That sure gets Paimon thinking. Ah, she can see it now...
:'''Sorush:''' St&mdash;Stop mentioning things from so long ago!
:{{DIcon}} Let's take a quick gander back to our original topic...
:{{DIcon}} So, as for the Sunyata Flowers...
:'''Sefana:''' Right, Sister. Does your Yasnapati not understand much about the Sunyata Flowers? Perhaps I can introduce them, on behalf of the elders...
:'''Sefana:''' There was a Pari who once sang thus&mdash;
:'''Sefana:''' "This coalescence of color is the miraculous sign of the flowing spring of life"...
:'''Sefana:''' "Linger here with me, dance and sing with me, let us weave lasting joy"...
:'''Sefana:''' ...And I've forgotten the rest.
:'''Sefana:''' I've spent too long trying to clear the defilement that remains in this place. The exhaustion is clouding my mind...
:'''Paimon:''' Don't push yourself too much! It doesn't matter if you can't remember some quotations. Just say stuff in a more relaxed way!
:'''Sefana:''' Well then, let me think... Though the Sunyata Flowers are not the most precious thing within the Vourukasha Oasis, they are exceedingly dear companions to our people.
:'''Sefana:''' Many Pari spend time with those flowers after they've finished their work for the day.
:'''Sefana:''' It would be like a human growing up alongside those creatures that go "Meow-meow" and "Woof-woof"...
:{{DIcon}} You means cats and dogs?
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, so that's how it is. Y'know, if Paimon had one of those as a pet for a while, and it got sick, Paimon would be really sad too.
:'''Paimon:''' Never mind what might happen if it was Paimon's only friend...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon understands now, Sefana. The health of the Sunyata Flowers is definitely important! Our efforts were not in vain!
:'''Sorush:''' Hmm... The importance of the Sunyata Flowers is far beyond such. You're still not all that good at analogies, Sefana.
:'''Sefana:''' Speaking of, not only have I troubled Sister Sorush, but also our great Yasnapati... and on our first meeting too... I must prepare some gifts for you in return...
:'''Sefana:''' I picked up some shiny objects while caring for the Sunyata Flowers. I have heard that humans and their meow-meows and woof-woofs love them...
:'''Paimon:''' Would that be... Mora? Paimon wouldn't mind some if that were the case!
:'''Sefana:''' What gift could I get you, Sister Sorush?
:'''Sorush:''' There's no need, Sefana. just take care of yourself and the Sunyata Flowers.
:'''Paimon:''' That's surprisingly nice, and Sorush sounds like a big sister, too... You two do have a close relationship!
:{{DIcon}} Are you scared that Sefana may share a story or two about your past...
:{{DIcon}} Ahh, do share a few embarrassing incidents of hers!
:'''Sorush:''' I'm not trying to hide anything! I just genuinely want Sefana to take better care of herself!
:'''Sorush:''' After all, to use an analogy that humans can understand, both Sunyata Flowers and Pari hail from the dewdrops of the Harvisptokhm. And that makes us family.
:'''Sorush:''' The Pari who take care of the Sunyata Flowers are under the constant encroachment of the defilement, which is a great burden to bear.
:'''Sorush:''' Sefana is a tough soul, always shouldering the responsibility on her own. And she's also been respectful to me too. It's only natural that I want to take care of her.
:{{DIcon}} "Family"...
:{{DIcon}} In that sense, they are very important, indeed...
:'''Paimon:''' A caring Sorush, huh &mdash; Paimon didn't expect to see this gentle side of you!
:'''Sefana:''' Gentle? Yes, I agree! Sister Sorush often helps me solve my problems. She is a caring senior!
:'''Sorush:''' You should refrain from using this absurd way of wording things!
:'''Sorush:''' Ahem! Anyway, the threats to the Sunyata Flowers have been eliminated! I will pay you and these flowers a visit again someday, Sefana.
:'''Sorush:''' One day, the embers of the darkness shall be no more, and the pure and pristine colors shall return to the Vourukasha Oasis!
:'''Sefana:''' Ah, you've got other things to do? Then... best of luck to you!
:'''Sefana:''' I will always wait here for you, Sister Sorush, the great Yasnapati, and the Pale Companion!
:'''Sefana:''' Next time we meet, please allow me to share my experiences with Sister Sorush. There are so many interesting stories that I'd love to share!
:'''Sorush:''' That won't be necessary!

;(Immediately after the previous dialogue)
:'''Sorush:''' Excellent. The daytime Sunyata Flower has regained its vitality.
:'''Sorush:''' It also emits light of a different vibrance after night falls. Yasnapati, if your timing shall be amenable, you may come back to witness it.
