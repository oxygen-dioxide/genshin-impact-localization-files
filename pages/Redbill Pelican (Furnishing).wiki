|description    = A type of waterfowl that dwells in open water bodies such as lakes and rivers. A pointed crimson-hued beak and magnificently colored plumage are its distinguishing characteristics.<br>Redbill Pelicans are born to fish, and their innate talent for doing so remains unchanged even when they are in a place like The Realm Within with its abundant supply of food. Their greatest joy is to silently observe the movements of fish within the [[Pool of Sapphire Grace]]. But fret not&mdash; these avians with keen eyesight will never even entertain the notion of attacking unless [[Tubby]] allows it.
