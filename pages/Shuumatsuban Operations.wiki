;(Walking towards the stairs)
:'''As you approach the Adventurers' Guild in Inazuma City, someone slams into your shoulder.'''

:'''Paimon:''' Come on, what was with that person just now? The road's wide enough. They didn't have to walk straight at us like that!
:'''Paimon:''' No "sorry" or "excuse Paimon" either. They just walked right off!
:{{DIcon}} Things aren't quite that simple, Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} I discovered this on my person.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? This is... a small note? You mean that person slipped it onto you?
:'''Paimon:''' Quick, let's open it and see what it says!
:;(Opens [[A Note Someone Stuffed You]])
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, nothing to read over here. Just a windmill and a window.
:{{DIcon}} I think it might be depicting some other things.
:{{DIcon}} You mean a shuriken and a metal gate?
:'''Paimon:''' Huh... You're right! Hmm, let Paimon think... A shuriken, huh... Ooh, that's right! It's the "Shuumatsuban"!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon gets it now! This must be a coded message from Ms. Gendou. In that case, this "metal gate" has to be the entrance to her safehouse!
:{{DIcon}} More or less.
:'''Paimon:''' Come on, (Traveler), let's head over to the safehouse. That's where Ms. Gendou's gotta be!
;(Obtain [[A Note Someone Stuffed You]] ×1)
{{Dialogue end}}

----
{{Quest Description|The note that was stuffed onto you seems to contain coded instructions to contact [[Gendou Ringo]]. Perhaps she has some matter to speak to you about...}}

{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the safehouse)
:'''Paimon:''' The entrance to the safehouse should be right up ahead.
:'''Paimon:''' Ms. Gendou did say that she'd contact us if something new came up. But it's been a while, hasn't it?
:'''Paimon:''' She didn't meet with any trouble, did she? Let's go ask her!

;(Talk to Gendou Ringo)
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Well, look who's here. What? You've been staring since you came in.
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, Ms. Gendou, you look really different from before...
:'''Paimon:''' Did something change while we were out of contact? Don't worry, we'll do our best to help you out!
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Changes? What are you talking about? Hmph. Forget worrying about me. You're the ones who were completely defenseless out there on the street.
:{{DIcon}} Wow, this terrible attitude...
:{{DIcon}} Ah, this familiar, horrible tone of voice...
:'''Paimon:''' Yup, that's the Gendou Ringo we know.
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' What are you two yammering about?
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, nothing, nothing! It's just good to see that you're well...
:'''Gendou Ringo:''' Hmph. For us ninja, every appearance is a disguise. I have a new mission now, so of course I no longer need that restrictive shrine maiden uniform.
:'''Gendou Ringo:'''  Anyway, "Gendou Ringo" is still being used by that fake at the Grand Narukami Shrine, so use my new codename, "Momoyo." Got it?
:'''Paimon:''' Roger, Ms. Momoyo!
:{{DIcon}} Roger, Ms. Momoyo!
:'''Momoyo:''' ...Whatever. Now, back on topic. There is a reason why I haven't contacted you recently.
:'''Paimon:''' So what happened?
:'''Momoyo:''' I guessed previously that the fake Gendou infiltrated the Shrine because she believed you to be Shuumatsuban members, and was thus preparing to infiltrate the Shuumatsuban itself.
:'''Momoyo:''' Logically, she should be trying to contact you often, which will push the plan forward. But things have been oddly quiet there recently.
:'''Paimon:''' That's true. She hasn't given us any missions in quite a while.
:'''Momoyo:''' Experience tells me that the Fatui must be "experiencing some changes" themselves. Perhaps they are planning to launch some truly large-scale operation...
:'''Paimon:''' That would be terrible!
:'''Momoyo:''' That's why I looked for you today. I'm giving you a mission: figure out what the fake Gendou and the Fatui are plotting.
:{{DIcon}} Should we actively seek her out?
:'''Momoyo:''' No need. Let's not stir them up just yet.
:'''Momoyo:''' Recently, we discovered three other undercover Fatui. Disguise yourself as one of their comrades and try to coax some intel out of them.
:'''Paimon:''' Ehhh? That's a super hard mission! How could you talk about it in such a relaxed manner?
:'''Momoyo:''' Oh, quit complaining. I've already figured it out for you. Here, take this code sheet.
:{{DIcon}} Code sheet?
:'''Momoyo:''' That's right. The Fatui's modus operandi differs greatly depending on which Harbinger they're under. This latest batch uses codes to ascertain their common allegiance.
:'''Momoyo:''' The codes they commonly use are written here. Take it.
:'''Paimon:''' That sounds super cool. Let Paimon see, let Paimon see!
:;(Opens [[Fatui Code Sheet]])
::Fellow countrymen who've forgotten their homeland: Fatui self-identification.<br />Hiking: conducting mission, on operation.<br />Sunbathing: Lie low, take no action.<br />Smash the plates: Attempt some bold action.<br />Wash the dishes: To be exposed and captured.<br />Clench the left hand: Take revenge.<br />Clench the right hand: Make an alliance.<br />Loosened the left hand: Betra{{Obf|y}}.<br />Loosened the right hand: F{{Obf|or}}give.<br />South Wind: Things going well.<br />North Wind: Things {{Obf|no}}t going wel{{Obf|l}}.<br />{{Obf|S}}un Crabs: The International Trade Association. Probably because they're not {{Obf|fro}}m Inazuma.<br />{{Obf|General}} Crabs: The Kanjou {{Obf|Commi}}ssion. {{Obf|Probably}} because they {{Obf|serve}} under the Shogun.<br />{{Obf|Pale Red}} Crabs: The Nobu{{Obf|shi}}.

Ugh, calling us {{Obf|ra}}ts. {{Obf|So}} annoying! {{Obf|---- --}} annoying, it's {{Obf|------ -- ------}}.<br /><br />(The words start out quite clear, but as time goes on, the handwriting becomes less and less legible, and there are clear signs of water smudging.)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, so many of these words are more like scrawls, and there's water damage too. Paimon can barely read it!
:'''Momoyo:''' Water? Huh, might've been saliva, then.
:'''Paimon:''' S&mdash;Saliva!?
:'''Momoyo:''' Hmph. You'd best know that I somehow managed to snag that [[Sayu|infiltration-specialist shortie]] to get this done. In fact, I'm impressed she actually managed to stay awake long enough to catch this much.
:{{DIcon}} ...I think I know who you're talking about.
:'''Momoyo:''' Whatever the case, memorize those codes, and the rest is up to you. Adapt, improvise, and overcome!
:'''Momoyo:''' One of your three targets is {{Color|buzzword|disguised as someone from Sumeru and often hangs around Ritou by the seaside}}. Very easy to spot.
:'''Momoyo:''' The other two operate in Inazuma City. {{Color|buzzword|One, a man, is dressed as a merchant. The other, a woman, started working in disguise at the Royal Hot Springs very recently}}. Got that?
:'''Momoyo:''' I'll be here in the safehouse for a few more days, preparing fake cadavers for a mission.
:'''Momoyo:''' I've already marked the Fatui's locations out on the map. Go, and return quickly!
;(Obtain [[Fatui Code Sheet]] ×1)

;(Talk to Momoyo again)
:'''Momoyo:''' What, need more detailed information? {{Color|buzzword|One of those three Fatui is disguised as someone from Sumeru and often hangs around Ritou by the seaside}}. Very easy to spot.
:'''Momoyo:''' {{Color|buzzword|The other two operate in Inazuma City. One, a man, is dressed as a merchant. The other, a woman, works in disguise at the Royal Hot Springs}}. Got that?
:'''Momoyo:''' What are you standing around for? Cadavers aren't that interesting &mdash; or are you interested in being used as raw materials to make one?

;(Approach [[Buzuleac]]'s location)
:'''Paimon:''' One of the Fatui spies should be nearby, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Remember, stay cool and act natural, or he'll suspect us for sure!

:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's got a feeling that it's gotta be him!

{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Buzuleac)
:'''Buzuleac:''' Oh? Are you looking for me?
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Attempt to make contact.
::'''Buzuleac:''' Hello? Is something the matter?
::'''Paimon:''' Err, we're actually...
::{{DIcon}} "Fellow companions who've forgotten their homeland."
::;(Lose all Hearts)
:::'''Buzuleac:''' Hmm? Oh, I get it. You mean that you're also outlanders living in Ritou, right?
:::'''Paimon:''' (Uh, so he seems friendly enough, but Paimon thinks you got that one a teensy bit wrong, (Traveler).)
:::'''Buzuleac:''' Sorry. Could you leave me alone for a while? I'd like to rest for a few days.
:::'''Paimon:''' (Looks like he doesn't trust us. We should study the codes we were given one more time.)
::;(Conversation ends)
::{{DIcon}} "Fellow countrymen who've forgotten their homeland."
::;(+1 Heart)
:::'''Buzuleac:''' Oh? You seem pretty young, but you're "fellow countrymen," huh?
:::'''Paimon:''' Hey, don't you underestimate us!
:::'''Buzuleac:''' How long have you been in Inazuma? Have you gotten used to life here?
:::'''Paimon:''' Not long, really, but we're doing alright.
:::'''Buzuleac:''' Good, good. Well, I suppose you've met those "General Crabs," then? Those people really know how to give us trouble.
:::{{DIcon}} Ugh, yeah, especially those taxes.
:::;(+1 Heart)
::::'''Buzuleac:''' No kidding. Taxes used to be the worst thing ever around here in Ritou. They've actually gone down quite a lot after the recent abolition of the Vision Hunt Decree.
::::'''Buzuleac:''' On the downside... *sigh* You know what? It's probably due to that incident with our Lady. Vigilance is at an all-time high. We can't act rashly.
::::'''Paimon:''' ("Our Lady"... He must mean Signora.)
::::'''Buzuleac:''' Well, let's leave the "General Crabs" aside first. Those "Iron Rats" are also getting harder to deal with.
::::'''Buzuleac:''' I just came back from a "hike," so I'll probably spend some time here in Ritou "sunbathing." I mean, we've really got a great "north wind" blowing!
::::{{DIcon}} Well, that's certainly worth celebrating.
::::;(Lose all Hearts)
:::::'''Buzuleac:''' Celebrating? Why, thank you.
:::::'''Paimon:''' (Uh, Paimon thinks you said something wrong. His expression's darkening.)
:::::'''Buzuleac:''' Sorry. Could you leave me alone for a while? I'd like to rest for a few days.
:::::'''Paimon:''' (Looks like he doesn't trust us. We should study the codes we were given one more time.)
::::;(Conversation ends)
::::{{DIcon}} That's terrible. You've had it rough, I see.
::::;(+1 Heart)
:::::'''Buzuleac:''' *sigh* Thanks. I've heard that many of our "fellow countrymen" have gone to "wash the dishes." Who knows how long we can stay here ourselves?
::::;(Go to next section)
:::{{DIcon}} Aye, what with the robberies and all.
:::;(Lose all Hearts)
::::'''Buzuleac:''' Robbery? Surely you jest. They're with the Shogunate. Surely they wouldn't do such things!
::::'''Paimon:''' (Uh oh, he's getting suspicious! You must've mixed up the lines that were related to crabs!)
::::'''Buzuleac:''' Sorry. Could you leave me alone for a while? I'd like to rest for a few days.
::::'''Paimon:''' (Looks like he doesn't trust us. We should study the codes we were given one more time.)
:::;(Conversation ends)
::{{DIcon}} "Fellow conspirators who've forgotten their homeland."
::;(Lose all Hearts)
:::'''Paimon:''' (Oh, come on, (Traveler), that's clearly not the right line!)
:::'''Buzuleac:''' "Fellow conspirator," you say? That's quite the sense of humor you've got there. I suppose you, too, must be an outlander living in Ritou.
:::'''Buzuleac:''' Sorry. Could you leave me alone for a while? I'd like to rest for a few days.
:::'''Paimon:''' (Looks like he doesn't trust us. We should study the codes we were given one more time.)
::;(Conversation ends)
:{{DIcon}} May I ask who you are...?
::'''Buzuleac:''' My name is Buzuleac, a merchant from Sumeru. I'm currently doing business in Ritou.
:: '''Buzuleac:''' But I've been on break recently, so if you're here to talk business, could you come back in a few days?
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry, it's nothing.
::'''Buzuleac:''' Goodbye.

;(After successfully increasing hearts with Buzuleac)
:'''Buzuleac:''' Speaking of which, the Teacher did mention that there would be a few new members coming in to work with Lyudochka. You must be one of them.
:{{DIcon}} That's right.
:'''Buzuleac:''' I see! Ah, I'm sorry. I've been on edge lately, that's why I tested the two of you for so long.
:'''Buzuleac:''' I mean, of course you're one of us, that should have been obvious. You were so familiar with our codes!
:'''Paimon:''' (This is great, (Traveler), looks like he totally trusts us now!)
:'''Buzuleac:''' What do you need from me?
:'''Paimon:''' To be honest, we'd like to know a bit more about the "fellow countryman" you called Lyudochka.
:{{DIcon}} Exactly. We have to work together, after all.
:'''Buzuleac:''' I see. To be honest, I've never seen her either. I just know that she's infiltrated the Grand Narukami Shrine atop Mt. Yougou.
:'''Buzuleac:''' Ah, she's so lucky. We were all brought up in similar circumstances, but it's just easier for people with Inazuman blood like her to create a fake identity, you know?
:'''Buzuleac:''' Those who look like outlanders no matter how you slice it, like me, can only stay here in Ritou.
:{{DIcon}} Do people say anything else about her?
:'''Buzuleac:''' Well, they certainly all think she's been fortunate to get a safe and relaxing job like "being a shrine maiden." But there are also those who are jealous of her position.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, so that's how it is?
:'''Buzuleac:''' Exactly. She's in an excellent position, but her infiltration mission hasn't progressed at all. It seems like the Teacher's patience is wearing thin.
:'''Buzuleac:''' As such, the Teacher's decided to transfer her to an active unit so that she can make some actual contributions to the cause. She'll be out in the field with people like you.
:'''Buzuleac:''' You needn't worry, though. They say she's never been in a real fight, but that she was pretty sharp in training. Between the two of you, you should be able to get some big things done.
:'''Buzuleac:''' I can't be sure about much else, I'm afraid. You can ask the others. Just be prepared. You might get a cold reception from those who are ill-disposed toward Lyudochka.
:'''Buzuleac:''' Do you two have anything else you need to know?
:{{DIcon}} Actually, I'm with the "Iron Rats."
::'''Buzuleac:''' What&mdash;! You're... with the Shuumatsuban!?
::'''Paimon:''' That's right &mdash; and we're going to put an "end" to you!
:;(Defeat Buzuleac)
:{{DIcon}} Nothing much.
::'''Buzuleac:''' See you, then. If you wish to know more about Lyudochka, you can ask the others.

;(If Buzuleac was not fought)
;(Talk to Buzuleac again)
:'''Buzuleac:''' Oh? Are you looking for me?
:{{DIcon}} Actually, I'm with the "Iron Rats."
:;(Same as above)
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry, it's nothing.
::'''Buzuleac:''' Goodbye.

;(If Buzuleac is fought)
;(At the start of the fight)
:'''Buzuleac:''' I've always been so careful! How did this happen&mdash;
:'''Buzuleac:''' Don't blame me! You're the ones who discovered a secret you never should have!
;(After defeating Buzuleac)
:'''Buzuleac:''' So this is... where it ends...
----
;(Approach [[Nakatani]]'s location)
:'''Paimon:''' One of the spies active in Inazuma should be around here somewhere.
:'''Paimon:''' Momoyo wrote on the map that he enjoys hanging out on the high ground, so let's get hunting, shall we?

;(Approach Nakatani)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. Did you see someone on the roof? Let's go have a look!
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|Attempt to win the trust of this spy and obtain useful intelligence.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Nakatani)
:'''Nakatani:''' ...Hmph. What is it?
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Attempt to make contact with him.
::'''Paimon:''' Wow, you're pretty easy to find, aren't you?
::'''Nakatani:''' ...What is it? You want to fight?
::'''Paimon:''' Oh, no, no, don't misunderstand. We've got something to ask you.
::'''Nakatani:''' ...Ask me? Who are you?
::'''Paimon:''' Actually, we're...
::{{DIcon}} "Fellow countrymen who've forgotten their story."
::;(Lose all Hearts)
:::'''Nakatani:''' "Story?"
:::'''Nakatani:''' A man has no story. Only friends... or enemies.
:::'''Paimon:''' (Wow. This guy's actually kinda cool... But come on, the code you gave was obviously wrong.)
:::'''Nakatani:''' ...Hmph.
:::'''Paimon:''' (Looks like he isn't bothering with us anymore. We've got to pay more attention to those codes.)
::;(Conversation ends)
::{{DIcon}} "Fellow countrymen who've forgotten their failure."
::;(Lose all Hearts)
:::'''Nakatani:''' "Failure"?
:::'''Paimon:''' (What are you saying, (Traveler)!? That's way too far off the mark!)
:::'''Nakatani:''' Ha... Hahaha...
:::'''Paimon:''' (Look at his face, just look at that scary mug! Please stop using the wrong codes!)
:::'''Nakatani:''' No, no! Failure only comes when people "loosen their left hands."
:::'''Nakatani:''' That is why we must "clench our left hands." Yes, that's right.
:::'''Paimon:''' (...Hmm, he seems to be off in his own world. Doesn't look like he's in the mood to bother with us right now.)
::;(Conversation ends)
::{{DIcon}} "Fellow countrymen who've forgotten their homeland."
::;(+1 Heart)
:::'''Nakatani:''' "Fellow countrymen" from the homeland... You're new?
:::'''Paimon:''' Yup, that's right. That's why we came to say hello.
:::'''Nakatani:''' I see. Then, have you heard?
:::'''Paimon:''' Heard about what?
:::'''Nakatani:''' The "General Crabs" and "Sun Crabs," "clenched their right hands"... Our "fellow countrymen" went "hiking," encountered the "north wind."
:::{{DIcon}} Look enraged.
:::;(+1.25 Hearts)
::::'''Nakatani:''' Mm. The Teacher says that we must "smash the plates."
::::'''Paimon:''' (Honestly, Paimon's feeling kinda lost already, but at least he seems pleased with what you said.)
::::'''Nakatani:''' Also, that woman. She must be tested.
::::'''Paimon:''' That woman?
::::'''Nakatani:''' Lyudochka. Our "fellow countryman" at the shrine. She has been "sunbathing" all this time.
::::{{DIcon}} So you suspect that she's "loosened her left hand"?
::::;(+1.25 Hearts)
:::::'''Nakatani:''' Yes. Exactly. That.
::::;(Go to next section)
::::{{DIcon}} So you suspect that she's "loosened her right hand"?
::::;(Lose all Hearts)
:::::'''Nakatani:''' You... Very suspicious.
:::::'''Nakatani:''' ...Hmph.
:::::'''Paimon:''' (Looks like he isn't bothering with us anymore. We've got to pay more attention to those codes.)
::::;(Conversation ends)
:::{{DIcon}} Look pleased.
:::;(Lose all Hearts)
::::'''Nakatani:''' You smiled. Why? Are you... an enemy?
::::'''Paimon:''' No, no, {{MC|he|she|mc=1}} was just about to sneeze, that's all! We'll talk to you again later!
::::'''Paimon:''' (That was way too dangerous! You really ticked him off back there. Did he confuse you by using too many code words?)
::::'''Nakatani:''' ...Hmph.
::::'''Paimon:''' (Looks like he isn't bothering with us anymore. We've got to pay more attention to those codes.)
:::;(Conversation ends)
:{{DIcon}} May I ask your name?
::'''Nakatani:''' ...
::{{DIcon}} Why are you standing here?
::'''Nakatani:''' ...
::{{DIcon}} Enjoying the view?
::'''Nakatani:''' If so, or if not... what is it to you?
::'''Nakatani:''' Either way, not your business.
:{{DIcon}} Nothing.
::'''Nakatani:''' Hmph.

;(After successfully increasing hearts with Nakatani)
:'''Nakatani:''' Speak. What do you want?
:'''Paimon:''' Actually, we'd like to know a bit more about what's going on with Lyudochka.
:'''Nakatani:''' Lyudochka? Hmph. She is weak.
:'''Nakatani:''' But she knows Inazuma. Well. The Teacher gave her an important task. But she has disappointed.
:'''Nakatani:''' Tonight. The Teacher will meet her. And give her orders. It will be at the usual place.
:'''Paimon:''' The "usual place"? Where's that supposed to be?
:'''Nakatani:''' I do not know. Nor do I care. I only know that she is "Snezhevna." So the Teacher has been good to her.
:'''Nakatani:''' She must "smash the plates." Repay that debt.
:'''Nakatani:''' Anything else?
:{{DIcon}} Actually, we're with the Shuumatsuban.
::'''Nakatani:''' ...
::'''Nakatani:''' So you are enemies. We must destroy the enemy. We must "clench our left hands"!
:;(Defeat Nakatani)
:{{DIcon}} Nothing much.
::'''Nakatani:''' Lyudochka must decide. Tonight.
::'''Nakatani:''' See you.

;(If Nakatani was not fought)
;(Talk to Nakatani again)
:'''Nakatani:''' ...Hmph. What is it?
:{{DIcon}} Actually, we're with the Shuumatsuban.
:;(Same as above)
:{{DIcon}} Nothing.
::'''Nakatani:''' Hmph.

;(If Nakatani is fought)
;(At the start of the fight)
:'''Nakatani:''' Enemies must be destroyed. We will "clench our left hands"!
;(After defeating Nakatani)
:'''Nakatani:''' The Teacher... will catch you...
----
;(Approach the Royal Hot Springs)
:'''Paimon:''' There should be a Fatui spy nearby, right? She apparently just started working at the Royal Hot Springs. Let's go ask around.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon wonders where she is now...

;(Talk to [[Mikawa Akane]])
:'''Mikawa Akane:''' I took my eyes off her for a moment, and now she's gone...
:'''Mikawa Akane:''' Oh, my apologies. Do you need my help with something, by any chance?
:'''Paimon:''' Could we ask if you've hired a new employee recently? We'd just like to ask her a few things.
:'''Mikawa Akane:''' Oh, you must be referring to Tae. As it happens, I'm looking for her too.
:'''Mikawa Akane:''' She isn't very focused at work, and even skips out on her shift quite often. I bet she's hiding out somewhere right now, taking a break.
:'''Mikawa Akane:''' Somehow, there was an incident of a guest getting frostbite while she was on shift. So yes, she's a headache. In fact, I wonder if it might be better if she didn't come to work at all...
:'''Paimon:''' Um... Wow...
:'''Mikawa Akane:''' I don't think she'll have gone far. She should be slacking off in the courtyard by the cliff.

;(Approach [[Tae]])
:'''Paimon:''' That's gotta be her! Paimon just knows it!

{{Quest Description|update|Attempt to win the trust of this spy and obtain useful intelligence.}}

;(Talk to Tae)
:'''Tae:''' Yes? What is it?
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Attempt to make contact with her.
::'''Paimon:''' We've got something to ask you...
::'''Tae:''' Hmm? Who are you? Did that Mikawa Akane send you? Pfah. I just skipped a shift. You don't have to call people to catch me. Ugh!
::'''Paimon:''' Uh, you've got it wrong...
::'''Tae:''' What, are you from the Tenryou Commission, then? I already told you. I was on duty that day, yes, but I've got nothing to do with that case of frostbite, you hear?
::'''Paimon:''' Uh, we're not from the Tenryou Commission either. We're...
::{{DIcon}} "Fellow countrymen who've forgotten their homeland."
::;(+1.25 Hearts)
:::'''Tae:''' What? So you're "fellow countrymen"? You should've just said so!
:::'''Paimon:''' But you didn't let us speak earlier...
:::'''Tae:''' What? Are you trying to start a fight with me?
:::'''Paimon:''' No, no, definitely not!
:::'''Paimon:''' (Ugh, and here Paimon thought that Momoyo had a terrible temper. This Fatui lady might be even worse...!)
:::'''Tae:''' Hmph. "Fellow countrymen," eh? If you've got nothing else to do, get out of my way.
:::'''Tae:''' This job is tiring as all get-out, and there's not a moment of peace and quiet to be found. Archon, I might as well go "wash the dishes"!
:::{{DIcon}} Well, that might not be a bad thing.
:::;(Lose all Hearts)
::::'''Tae:''' Huh? What did you say? If you've got nothing good to say, then get lost!
::::'''Paimon:''' (Oh no, you misunderstood the meaning of that code word. She looks super angry right now!)
::::'''Tae:''' Get out of my face until you know what you're talking about!
::::'''Paimon:''' (She seems pretty annoyed. We've gotta study those codes more carefully.)
:::;(Conversation ends)
:::{{DIcon}} Stay cool, you're still young...
:::;(+1.5 Hearts)
::::'''Tae:''' *sigh* ...You're right. Working here at the hot spring is tiring, yes, but at least for now, the "south wind" is blowing.
::::'''Tae:''' Hah, and what's more, I need to stick around long enough to watch that woman, slacking off at the shrine as she is, get her comeuppance!
::::{{DIcon}} Comeuppance?
::::'''Tae:''' That's right! That Lyudochka and her archon-forsaken good luck... Believe you me, I've never liked that wretch!
::::'''Tae:''' I could've been the one to work at the shrine, but the Teacher chose her in the end... Hmph. We're all "Snezhevnas." How am I inferior to her in any way, huh?
::::'''Tae:''' And what do you think of that woman, huh? Will you "clench your right hand" or "loosen your right hand"?
::::{{DIcon}} I shall "clench my right hand."
::::;(Lose all Hearts)
:::::'''Tae:''' Tch. What, are you two on good terms or something? What did you come find me for, then?
:::::'''Paimon:''' (To "clench your right hand" means to "make an alliance." She might not suspect that we're not Fatui, but she probably thinks we've taken the fake Gendou's side...)
:::::'''Tae:''' Get out of my face until you know what you're talking about!
:::::'''Paimon:''' (She seems pretty annoyed. We've gotta study those codes more carefully.)
::::;(Conversation ends)
::::{{DIcon}} I shall "loosen my right hand."
::::;(Lose all Hearts)
:::::'''Tae:''' Tsk, you're useless. Just hanging around people like you makes me sick.
:::::'''Paimon:''' (Huh... to "loosen the right hand" means to "forgive." Ugh, she's looking down on us!)
:::::'''Tae:''' Get out of my face until you know what you're talking about!
:::::'''Paimon:''' (She seems pretty annoyed. We've gotta study those codes more carefully.)
::::;(Conversation ends)
::::{{DIcon}} No, I will "clench my left hand."
::::;(+1.25 Hearts)
:::::'''Tae:''' Ahaha! That's right! That's how things should be! And here I thought you two looked kind of weak. Didn't expect you to be this ruthless, to be honest!
:::::{{DIcon}} Oh, you'd be surprised.
:::::'''Paimon:''' (She just praised us... That doesn't feel right somehow, but at least she trusts us now.)
::::;(Go to next section)
::{{DIcon}} "Fellow countrymen who've abandoned their homeland."
::;(Lose all Hearts)
:::'''Tae:''' And what does your abandoning your homeland have to do with me? Wait. Are you stowaways? Well, if you're looking for my help, you're barking up the wrong tree!
:::'''Paimon:''' (Uh-oh, you must've used the wrong code back there. She's got a terrifying look on her face!)
:::'''Tae:''' Leave! Or I'll set the Tenryou Commission's lackeys on you, and they'll lock you right up!
:::'''Paimon:''' We're leaving! We're leaving!
::;(Conversation ends)
::{{DIcon}} "Fellow colleagues who've abandoned their homeland."
::;(Lose all Hearts)
:::'''Tae:''' Colleagues? You work here as well? Then what are you looking for me for? If you've got a problem, go find Mikawa Akane or something!
:::'''Paimon:''' (That's not the code we're going for, (Traveler). Look, she's ignoring us now.)
:::'''Tae:''' Get out of my face until you know what you're talking about!
:::'''Paimon:''' (She seems pretty annoyed. We've gotta study those codes more carefully.)
::;(Conversation ends)
:{{DIcon}} Who are you...?
::'''Tae:''' What? Who died and made you the boss of me?
:{{DIcon}} It's nothing.
::'''Tae:''' Hmph!

;(After successfully increasing hearts with Tae)
:'''Tae:''' Hah! It seems like you're no friends of Lyudochka either. That makes three of us... Anyway, what did she do to you?
:{{DIcon}} She deceived us.
:{{DIcon}} She dumped her work onto us.
:'''Paimon:''' (Huh, you know what? That's not actually untrue...)
:'''Tae:''' Agh, that's rough. But fret not. She'll get what's coming to her soon enough, haha!
:'''Paimon:''' Why'd you say that?
:'''Tae:''' Well, it all comes back to what happened last week. I had to meet that woman at a restaurant. It was a mission, you understand. So, while she was paying for the meal, I rifled through her bags for a little spare change.
:'''Paimon:''' (Wow. This person doesn't just say horrible stuff, she *is* horrible!)
:'''Tae:''' Hehe, but I made quite the unexpected find! And what a find it was!
:{{DIcon}} What did you find?
:'''Tae:''' A novel from Yae Publishing House. A new issue, fresh off the presses, too! As you know, the Teacher has always forbidden unnecessary leisure. So I reported her, of course.
:'''Tae:''' Hah! Never did I expect that the Teacher was already losing patience with her shilly-shallying on her assignment to infiltrate the "Iron Rats."
:'''Tae:''' The Teacher was absolutely fuming after hearing my report. "I'm kicking her out of the shrine. She's going to Watatsumi Island to do some proper work!" Ah, that was great! Best thing I've heard all week!
:{{DIcon}} Very well done indeed!
:'''Paimon:''' (Hey, (Traveler)! You really sound like the bad guy here, you know?)
:{{DIcon}} (Shh, I'm just acting.)
:{{DIcon}} (I see I was quite convincing.)
:'''Tae:''' Hehehe. Whatever the case, let's eagerly await Lyudochka's tragic fall.
:'''Tae:''' What else do you need?
:{{DIcon}} You know, we're actually...
::'''Tae:''' Wait. So you really *are* with Lyudochka, aren't you!?
::'''Paimon:''' Yup! That's exactly it!
::{{DIcon}} Uh, Paimon, that's not...
::'''Paimon:''' Whatever! The way she keeps talking about other people just ticks Paimon off! Even Lyudochka wasn't this annoying!
:;(Defeat Tae)
:{{DIcon}} Nothing much
::'''Tae:''' Alright, I'll rest up a bit further before going back to work. Working at a hot spring really makes you dizzy... That's how I let my Cryo abilities slip by mistake previously.
::'''Tae:''' The Tenryou Commission hasn't stopped suspecting me over that, even now.

;(If Tae was not fought)
;(Talk to Tae again)
:'''Tae:''' Yes? What is it?
:{{DIcon}} You know, we're actually...
:;(Same as above)
:{{DIcon}} It's nothing.
::'''Tae:''' Hmph!

;(If Tae is fought)
;(At the start of the fight)
:'''Tae:''' You know what? I don't care who you are. I'm going to give you a piece of my mind &mdash; and then some!
;(After defeating Tae)
:'''Tae:''' Lyudochka... You'll get what's... coming to you...

{{Quest Description|update|All three Fatui spies have provided you with important intelligence concerning the impostor Gendou Ringo. Head back to the safehouse and inform Momoyo.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the safehouse)
:'''Paimon:''' Whew, that's all the information we could get, Paimon thinks. That was super tiring!
:'''Paimon:''' Let's head back to the safehouse and tell Momoyo all that we've learned.

;(Talk to Momoyo)
:'''Momoyo:''' Well, you're finally back. Did you manage to get any intel from them?

:'''You tell Momoyo the details of the intelligence you got from the Fatui.'''

:'''Momoyo:''' Hmph. Seriously, between the two of you talking over each other, your report was as clear as mud. But don't worry, I got the gist of it.
:'''Momoyo:''' So, the fake at the shrine is named Lyudochka. Her superior has actually been pushing her to make further contact with you, but for some reason, she hasn't acted yet.
:'''Momoyo:''' As such, this superior, whom they call "the Teacher," is going to give her a new assignment tonight. She will have to leave the shrine and go to Watatsumi Island.
:'''Paimon:''' That's exactly how it is, yes.
:'''Momoyo:''' The details of this operation in Watatsumi Island is key intelligence. We must find some way to get our hands on it.
:'''Paimon:''' But we don't know where they're going to meet up...
:{{DIcon}} We could follow her from the shrine.
:'''Momoyo:''' That is so. But given that the area near the Grand Narukami Shrine is filled with mountain paths, we're quite likely to lose her.
:'''Momoyo:''' Wait just a moment.
:'''Momoyo:''' Here. Use this.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Isn't this one of those Bamboo Slips you get from the Fortune Slip Box?
:'''Momoyo:''' This is no ordinary Bamboo Slip. I've scattered some Shuumatsuban-made elemental powder on it. You can use Elemental Sight to see the traces left by the powder.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon gets it now. We'll pretend to draw a Bamboo Slip, and then take the opportunity to get the powder onto her. Hehe, leave it to Paimon!
:'''Momoyo:''' Stop waving that slip around! How are you supposed to identify the right target if that powder gets onto you as well, huh?
:'''Paimon:''' S&mdash;Sorry! Paimon's sorry!
:'''Momoyo:''' Hmph. Anyway, this powder is somewhat toxic, so fiddle with it willy-nilly at your own risk.
:'''Paimon:''' (Y'know, (Traveler), Momoyo seems really fierce, but she's actually a pretty nice person...)
:'''Momoyo:''' Hey! Less jibber-jabber, more work! Any further delay and the sun's going to go down!
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, we're going, we're going!
;(Obtain [[Special Bamboo Slip]] ×1)

;(Talk to Momoyo again)
:'''Momoyo:''' Go on, quickly now. Get the powder onto that fake, and we'll able to track her using Elemental Sight.
:'''Momoyo:''' The Fatui are surely up to no good on Watatsumi Island. But now that the Tenryou Commission isn't covering for them, they can forget about trying anything funny.
