{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = Dual Form
|desc_1      = The Lava Dragon Statue starts in its Geohuman form. A [[Fury]] bar will fill when attacked by {{Pyro}}. When the bar fully fills, it will transform into its Molten Dragon form. In the Molten Dragon form, the Lava Dragon Statue will be permanently imbued with {{Pyro}}, and its all RES except Pyro is reduced to '''-30%'''. The Fury accumulation will vary depending on the attack:<ul><!--
--><li>If a {{Pyro}} attack applies {{Pyro}}, it will gain '''~6.667%''' Fury per [[gauge unit]] applied.</li><!--
--><li>If a {{Pyro}} attack does not apply {{Pyro}}, it will gain a fixed '''~1.687%''' Fury.</li><!--
--></ul>In the Molten Dragon form, a second Fury bar will be present and be '''20%''' filled by default. This Fury bar will fill when attacked by {{Pyro}} and deplete when attacked by {{Cryo}} or {{Hydro}}. If the second Fury bar fully fills, it will enter the Overburn state, causing it to become paralyzed for a period of time, during which all RES is reduced to '''-60%'''. If the second Fury bar fully depletes, it will revert to the Geohuman form. Additionally, when the second Fury bar fills to 50% and 100%, it will take {{Color|True Physical DMG}} equal to '''15%''' of its current HP. The Fury accumulation will vary depending on the attack:<ul><!--
--><li>If a {{Pyro}} attack applies {{Pyro}}, it will gain '''~2.976%''' Fury per gauge unit applied.</li><!--
--><li>If a {{Pyro}} attack does not apply {{Pyro}}, it will gain a fixed '''~0.833%''' Fury.</li><!--
--><li>Any {{Hydro}} or {{Cryo}} attack will reduce Fury by '''20%''' regardless of elemental application.</li><!--
--></ul>

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A monster that can continuously generate heat to sustain its activities.<br>Legends say these monsters with lava at their cores are the products of a distinct line of research to the Source Mechanisms that followed them — research into whether the primal flame could be used to create a new race based on humans. This research undoubtedly failed, for once the reaver arrived with their throne from beyond the skies, all that the primal flame could birth were hollow shells whose nominal lifeforce granted them no more consciousness than a stone.|[[Archive]]}}
