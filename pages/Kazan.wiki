:'''Kazan:''' *sigh* What I'd do for someone to teach me how to talk to children...
:{{DIcon}} Did they get up to something again?
::'''Kazan:''' No, no. That would be an overstatement.
::'''Kazan:''' Here's the situation. I'm in charge of guarding the lowest White Lift &mdash; we use it to draw water &mdash; and ensuring the safety of our water source.
::'''Kazan:''' Everyone in [[Aaru Village]] knows the importance of maintaining a steady supply of water in the desert. No one can be allowed to mess with it.
::'''Kazan:''' But the children can be quite playful, and they sometimes throw pebbles into the water or skim stones across it.
::'''Kazan:''' They'll say something like "I won't do it again," or "I'll be careful next time," but they'll be back in a few days as if they've forgotten all about their promise...
::{{DIcon}} Well, I can go and...
::'''Kazan:''' Uh, no, that's fine.
::'''Kazan:''' I don't have much to do around here, anyway, so it's really not too much trouble having to remind them every once in a while.
::'''Kazan:''' And recently, it seems that they've changed their tack. Sometimes, they'll shout, "Stop the elevator! Stop the elevator! This is not a drill!" and come rushing at me.
::'''Kazan:''' Hold on... That seems even more problematic...
:{{DIcon}} Well, best of luck to you.
::'''Kazan:''' *sigh*
