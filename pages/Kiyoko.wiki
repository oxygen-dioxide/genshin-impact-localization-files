==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Kiyoko:''' Would you like to buy anything? Our prices are reasonable and our goods are convenient and practical. Definitely worth your Mora!
:{{DIcon|Shop}} What do you sell here?
::'''Kiyoko:''' Well, feel free to have a look. This way, please.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me a bit about yourself, if you would...
::'''Kiyoko:''' I'm a merchant who came to [[Watatsumi Island]] specifically to do business. I provide high-quality, low-cost goods.
::'''Kiyoko:''' You've seen how things are around here. The village is small, the villagers lead rather limited existences, and they still need to receive those soldiers...
::'''Kiyoko:''' *cough* It's not that I'm looking down on this place. In fact, it's precisely because it's lacking development that it needs our help, right?
::'''Kiyoko:''' So that's why I decided to stay here for good and provide goods at an affordable asking, such that the inhabitants of this island will never lack daily necessities.
::{{DIcon}} Is importing goods convenient?
::'''Kiyoko:''' Well... This is a rather distant location, and it isn't under the jurisdiction of the [[Shogunate]] either, which makes importing goods quite tricky. In fact, I really don't know how these people got by before I came here...
::'''Kiyoko:''' *cough* Well, I've got my ways in any case. All my goods are delivered from the wharf via legal means.
::'''Kiyoko:''' The only big hassle is the questioning I get from the soldiers there every single time.
::'''Kiyoko:''' I mean, couldn't they give me a pass on account of all the help that I've given them? You know, like an exemption certificate or something...
:{{DIcon}} See you, then.
::'''Kiyoko:''' See you! Come back next time if you need anything.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
*Kiyoko is mentioned on the [[Ritou Harbor Bulletin Board#Outlander's Message|Ritou Harbor Bulletin Board]], in which an unidentified outlander professes their love for Kiyoko and indicates they are willing to pay off the Kanjou Commission troops at Ritou to go on dates with her.
