'''Decoration''' is a [[Furnishing Category]].

Unlike other furnishings, the player cannot choose where Decorations are placed, as they have set locations within each room of the [[Mansion]]. Some rooms may not have a spot for a particular Decoration (for example, most rooms do not have [[Decoration/Stairs|Stairs]] and some do not have [[Decoration/Ceiling Lamp|Ceiling Lamps]]). As well, changing the [[Decoration/Room Door|Room Door]] for one room will change it for every door in the mansion.
