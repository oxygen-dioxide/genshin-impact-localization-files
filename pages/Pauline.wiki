:'''Pauline:''' We sell all sorts of fresh flowers and plants here &mdash; looking to buy a few bouquets?

::'''Pauline:''' Greetings, Honorary Knight!
::'''Pauline:''' Perhaps you don't recognize me...
::'''Pauline:''' But I'm a resident of Springvale, and I run a small flower shop.
::'''Pauline:''' I'm always busy looking after the flowers and plants, so I haven't had any dealings with visitors from outside the town in a long time...
::'''Pauline:''' I never thought I'd meet a celebrity like you this year. Perhaps it's good luck brought by the returning wind?
:{{DIcon}} Flowers and plants?
::'''Pauline:''' I'm a keen gardener &mdash; the plants you see here? I grew them all myself. They're less common varieties that are purely ornamental.
::'''Pauline:''' My hope is that such beautiful plants will lift everyone's spirits.
::'''Pauline:''' However, because of their seasonal nature, I can only open for business at certain times of the year.
:{{DIcon}} Bye.
::'''Pauline:''' Goodbye, have a nice day!
