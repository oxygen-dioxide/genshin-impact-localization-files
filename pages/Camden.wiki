{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Camden:''' This isn't a place to be wandering about. If you don't have any business here, get out.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius_Invokation_TCG/Stage/Camden/Invigoration|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Camden:''' Such exciting duels don't come knocking too often round these parts. I'm not feeling so sleepy anymore, thanks to you!
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Camden:''' *yawn* Lost, as expected. Now I'm even sleepier...
:{{DIcon}} About the [[Geode Mine Shaft]]...
::'''Camden:''' *yawn* Sorry, I'm a bit tired. I think it's because of the [[Arkhium|stones]]... Have you ever heard anyone talk about how they have a mysterious energy?
::'''Camden:''' I don't know what the [[Fontaine Research Institute]] engineers do with the stones. But they form here, looking like that. Just thinking about them makes me sleepy...
::'''Camden:''' If... If you can avoid it, don't go over there. Otherwise I'll need to write a report... *yawn*
:{{DIcon}} About the middle gearwheel...
::'''Camden:''' Oh, that... That's, uh, an old issue from way back when.
::'''Camden:''' Just don't go touching it. I don't want my whole world to start spinning while I'm enjoying a proper snooze...
::'''Camden:''' Heh. I just mean, if you do move it make sure you don't accidentally trap anyone. It's happened before.
::'''Camden:''' Not that creatures like humans will ever learn from their mistakes, of course.
:{{DIcon}} Okay. See you.
::'''Camden:''' Good night... Uh, I mean goodbye.

''Available after completing ''An Eye for an Eye''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Camden:''' Oh, it's you! *cough* This isn't a place to be wandering about. If you don't have any business here, get out.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Same as above)
:{{DIcon}} About the Geode Mine Shaft...
::'''Camden:''' [[Clynes]]' device isn't as useful as he claims it is... But there are four of you.
::'''Camden:''' In that case, it would be best if I knew nothing about any of this. In fact, it must be something I dream up while sleeping in my lovely soft bed.
::'''Camden:''' *cough* [[Estienne]] wrote the incident report. I don't know what happened. I just found a new place to take a beautiful nap.
:{{DIcon}} About the middle gearwheel...
::'''Camden:''' Oh, that... That's, uh, an old issue from way back when.
::'''Camden:''' Just don't go touching it. I don't want my whole world to start spinning while I'm enjoying a proper snooze...
::'''Camden:''' And if something does go wrong I can't act like I didn't see anything this time. I mean, I'm right here.
::'''Camden:''' And {{sic|if say}} I didn't see anything, that would prove I've been sleeping on the job. I hope you can understand.
:{{DIcon}} Okay. See you.
::'''Camden:''' Good night... Uh, I mean goodbye.
