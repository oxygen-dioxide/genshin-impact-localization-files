''(To be added.)''

===Personality===
''(To be added.)''

===Appearance===
Hiroyuki wears the Watatsumi Army's standard uniform, modeled from the {{Lang|''ashigaru''|ja=足軽}} of feudal Japan. His clothing consists of a light red-white gradient ''shitagi'' with a red-violet colored left sleeve, gray ''kobakama'', and ''waraji'' sandals without the socks. Although not visible, the [[Sangonomiya Clan]]'s crest is imprinted on the back of the ''shitagi'', below the neck. Additional features on the uniform's design such as breastplates and helmets are not present, compared to Shogun's Army uniforms, but were still equipped with ''sode'' (shoulder armor), ''han-kote'' (half-armored sleeves), ''haidate'' (thigh guards), and ''sune-ate'' (greaves) armor, whose colors were red and black with gold accents. The right shoulder guard has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest imprinted on it. Hiroyuki is equipped with a ''juumonji yari'', whose shaft is colored with a red-white gradient and has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest under the spearhead.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before completing Omnipresence Over Mortals)
:'''Hiroyuki''': Hmm, things could get dicey if we entered a war of attrition...
:{{DIcon}} A war of attrition?
::'''Hiroyuki''': Yes. I'm currently considering conflict scenarios versus the Shogun's Army.
::'''Hiroyuki''': I've fought against the enforcers of the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] before. I know how strong they are.
::'''Hiroyuki''': By contrast, we Sangonomiya troops suffer from a severe material shortage. [[Watatsumi Island]]'s production capacities just can't keep up. A war of attrition is therefore strictly disadvantageous to us.
::'''Hiroyuki''': Not to mention how Vision wielders are in the vast minority. How long can us ordinary people stand against the Vision Hunt Decree?
::'''Hiroyuki''': *sigh* This path of resistance is an arduous one indeed...
:{{DIcon}} Stay safe.
::'''Hiroyuki''': I sure hope I do.

;(After completing Omnipresence Over Mortals)
:'''Hiroyuki''': Ah, it's a load off my shoulders to know that we no longer have to worry about fighting the Shogun's Army...
:{{DIcon}} Hey there, are you well?
::'''Hiroyuki''': Yes, and I hope you're doing well, too! Now that the war's over, I can finally enjoy the scenery here on Watatsumi Island again.
::'''Hiroyuki''': Have you been to the Sangonomiya Shrine? The huge coral really is something, isn't it?
::'''Hiroyuki''': The flora unique to the island is also definitely worth a few extra long looks.
::'''Hiroyuki''': *cough* Well, I might be getting a bit too relaxed, yes. The war is over for now, and the Vision Hunt Decree has been abolished, but our differences with the Shogunate remain...
::'''Hiroyuki''': Still, that's not going to stop me from taking this opportunity to relax a little.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Hiroyuki''': Goodbye!
