'''''Desert's Remembrance''''' is a [[World Quest]] in the series [[Old Notes and New Friends]].

==Steps==
# Search the Tomb of Carouses
# Talk to Soheil

==Gameplay Notes==
* Step 1 can be completed before obtaining this quest, with its corresponding dialogue still playing and staying the same, as if the quest was being played out.

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Soheil's archaeological notes record his desert adventures in his youth. Some of the ruins mentioned may contain treasures and old documents. Head into the depths of the desert again to look for them.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the tomb)
:'''Paimon:''' Heh, no wonder Soheil called this place the Lesser Mausoleum of King Deshret. It's a lot like the main tomb!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon wonders which one came first.

;(Activating the Prism of Khaj-Nisut)
:'''Paimon:''' Gah, this mechanism has changed color, but nothing happened at all. Is it damaged or something?
:'''Paimon:''' If our previous experience is anything to go by, something around here should've changed. Let's try to find it.

;(After activating the switch)
:'''Paimon:''' What's that noise? Feels like it came from deeper inside that pathway...

;(Opening the Exquisite chest containing [[Record of the Tomb of Carouses]])
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon wonders which one came first.
{{Dialogue end}}
<!--not sure where this changes{{Quest Description|update|Soheil's notes mention a place known as the Tomb of Carouses, which is similar to King Deshret's Mausoleum but smaller in scale. Is it as complex as the Mausoleum?}}-->
{{Quest Description|The ruins near the Dune of Carouses? You've found some old documents there before, so you can just directly give them to Soheil.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Soheil)
:'''Soheil:''' You're back. Did you find anything special in the desert?{{Transclude|Soheil's Wish|tomb of carouses|section=1}}
:;(Quest completes)
:{{DIcon}} Not yet.
::'''Soheil:''' Alright. If you do find anything, please share them with me and quench my thirst for knowledge.
