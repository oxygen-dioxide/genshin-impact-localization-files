|description    = A giant orange cat wearing a scarf emblazoned with the Knights of Favonius insignia. It was once a very fierce creature due to having long been subject to stimulating encounters with wild creatures, but after much comforting from [[Traveler|you]] and [[Paimon]], it has become an obedient kitty once more.<br>Its scarf was a gift from the [[Knights_of_Favonius#Investigation|Investigation Team]], but past experience demonstrated that it could not be the "Interim Team Feline" indefinitely. As such, [[Albedo]] has suggested that you and Paimon take care of it... which is just fine by Paimon.<br>After arriving in [[The Realm Within]], [[Sir Pouncelot]] has stepped out of the shadow of its past, growing used to this leisurely lifestyle...
