'''Enemies''' in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' are creatures that can be defeated by players. They can be classified by their difficulty type ([[Common Enemies]], [[Elite Enemies]], [[Normal Bosses]], and [[Weekly Bosses]]), by their family ([[Automatons]], [[The Abyss]], [[Elemental Lifeforms]], [[Mystical Beasts]], [[Hilichurls]], [[Fatui/Enemies|Fatui]], [[Other Human Factions]], and [[Enemies of Note]]), or some other form of grouping (e.g. [[Slimes]]).

For enemies, their HP, ATK and DEF are determined by '''base values''', '''level multipliers''' and '''special multipliers'''.

For animals, most of them have 0 DEF and 0 Resistance. Their level HP multiplier are 1 for all levels.

The ATK data are still under testing and not listed.
