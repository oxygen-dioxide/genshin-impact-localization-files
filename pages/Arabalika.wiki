==Profile==
Arabalika has a very powerful [[Mystic Arts in Teyvat#Ararakalari|Ararakalari]], as witnessed by the Traveler when he defeated a [[Ruin Guard]] by himself. They were sent to Ruins of Dahri to help heal the [[Varuna Contraption]]'s "branch" in the area and sensing [[Arapandu]]'s scent on them, Arabalika remained composed. As the roots are underground, The Traveler and Arabalika had to defeat Ruin Guards in the area to go down. He told [[Paimon]] to be careful since she does not fight and "mushrooms might eat her," where she added that [[Aradasha]] can beat a Ruin Guard in a blink of an eye. Arabalika mentioned that they were indeed powerful in the past, but they are not in the "now," so he has to train harder for his Ararakalari to be stronger. The Traveler and Arabalika fought two activated [[Ruin Grader]]s shortly after adjusting the "leaves" mechanisms. He then awakens the stone by singing and they returned to the "rest stop" in [[Apam Woods]].<ref name=":0">{{Ref/Quest|Irate Iron Chunk}}</ref> Arabalika, alongside Arapandu, [[Aranakula]], and [[Arakunti]], fixed the spore-covered Varuna Contraption once the Traveler got rid of the [[Fungus|Fungi]] in the underground space below [[Viewpoint/Varunastra|Varunastra]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Prayer for Rain on the Fecund Land}}</ref>

===Appearance===
