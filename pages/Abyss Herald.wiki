'''Abyss Heralds''' are an [[Elite Enemy|elite]] enemy group part of the [[Abyss Order]] and who are capable of manipulating intense abyssal energy. They are melee counterparts to [[Abyss Lector]]s, though they also have some ranged attacks at their disposal.

In combat, Abyss Heralds perform aggressive elemental attacks with their blades, some of which can apply a debuff to the player. When their HP is low, they will generate a durable elemental [[Shield/Enemy|Shield]] which is most efficiently destroyed using the correct [[Elemental Reaction]]s. After the shield is destroyed, they will be immediately defeated.

===Klingsor===
{{Main|Klingsor}}
A descendant of Khaenri'ahns who lived among the [[Order of Skeptics]] in the [[Girdle of the Sands]] several hundred years ago. After gaining an opportunity to investigate Khaenri'ahn ruins, he became allured by and embraced the power of the Abyss. He then led an invasion of [[Vourukasha Oasis]], but was repelled by the [[Pari]] and the other Skeptics.

In the present, he colludes with [[Nasejuna]] to seize the Great Songs of Khvarena and destroy the seal over [[Tunigi Hollow]], which would cause Abyssal energy to engulf Teyvat, but the Traveler foils their plans.

==="Presager of the Abyss"===
An otherwise unnamed [[Abyss Herald: Wicked Torrents|Hydro Abyss Herald]] encountered during four separate Archon Quests, working directly under the [[Traveler's Sibling]]. It flees after fighting the Traveler the first three times, but in the Chasm, the Traveler and [[Dainsleif]] finally put an end to it.

==="Fortune Lector"===
An otherwise unnamed [[Abyss Herald: Frost Fall|Cryo Abyss Herald]] encountered during the quest ''[[Caribert]]''. It guards the final chamber of the quest's dungeon, where the Sinner's crystal resides. It battles the Traveler to test their worthiness to continue and meet the Sinner.
