'''Crafting''' is a [[Crafting Method]] available at [[Crafting Benches]] to perform [[Alchemy]].

It allows players to craft higher rarity [[Character and Weapon Enhancement Material]]s, [[Weapon Ascension Material]]s, [[Talent Level-Up Material]]s, [[Potion]]s, and [[Character Ascension Material]]s. [[Gadget]]s can also be crafted after obtaining their [[Instructions]].

==List of Crafting Recipes==
Ascension Materials are crafted from three units of the same material of one tier lower.

==Character Bonuses==
Certain characters have [[Talents]] that provides a bonus while performing crafting.

{{Talents by Category Table|Crafting Talents}}

===Efficiency===
The bonuses from talents when crafting [[Character Talent Material]]s, [[Weapon Ascension Material]]s, and [[Character and Weapon Enhancement Material]]s are typically one of the following:
* 25% chance to refund one count of one material used
* 10% chance to double the product

Over time, '''the 10% chance to double the product bonus will yield slightly more products''' than the 25% chance to refund one material:

In terms of the number of additional products, these bonuses are effectively:
* 25% chance to refund one count of one material used:<br />On average, for every three materials used, ~0.09 products can be obtained additionally if the refunded materials are also used up
* 10% chance to double the product:<br />On average, for every three materials used, 0.10 products can be obtained additionally

In terms of the materials used per products, these bonuses are effectively:
* 25% chance to refund one count of one material used:<br />On average, 0.25 fewer materials required per product
* 10% chance to double the product:<br />On average, ~0.27 fewer materials required per product

====Derivations====
;25% chance refund
Suppose one starts with <math>x_0</math> materials. For every 3 materials the probability of getting one back is p, so the expected number of materials refunded is <math>x_0\left(\tfrac{p}{3}\right)</math>. One can also use these refunded materials to craft even more and get more refunded materials back. The expected number of materials refunded from these is <math>x_0(\tfrac{p}{3})^2</math>. One can continue this process, so that theoretically, the number of materials gained is:
:<math>x_0[\tfrac{p}{3} + (\tfrac{p}{3})^2 + (\tfrac{p}{3})^3 + \ldots] = \tfrac{x_0}{(3/p)-1}</math>
when summing the {{w|geometric series}}. This means that <math>\tfrac{1}{(3/p)-1}</math> more materials are gained from these passive talents. In turn, one will be able to craft around <math>\tfrac{1}{3/p-1}</math> portion more products (or <math>\tfrac{1}{(3/p)-1}</math> more products per 3 materials used).

So the total amount of materials that can be used for crafting is <math>x_0 + \tfrac{x_0}{(3/p)-1} = \tfrac{x_0}{1-(p/3)}</math> meaning one can craft <math>\tfrac{x_0}{3-p}</math> products. Thus with the passive talent, the amount of materials used per product is <math>3-p</math> whereas otherwise it would be 3. Hence <math>3-(3-p)=p</math> fewer materials per product are used.

For <math>p=1/4=25\%</math> this means 0.25 fewer materials per product are used and <math>\tfrac{1}{11} \approx 9\%</math> more products can be crafted (or .09 more products per 3 materials used).

;10% chance double
For characters which have a 10% chance of yielding double the product, 10% more products will be gained.

So if one starts with <math>x_0</math> materials, they can gain <math>\tfrac{11x_0}{30}</math> products on average. With this passive, the amount of materials used per product is <math>\tfrac{30}{11}</math> so <math>3-\tfrac{30}{11} \approx 0.27</math> fewer materials per product are used on average.
