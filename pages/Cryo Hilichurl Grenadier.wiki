{{Description|The primitive wandering inhabitants of Teyvat's wildernesses.<br />Hilichurls have discovered the use of [[Cryo Slime]]s in effectively keeping food fresh. Hilichurls have surprising amounts of wisdom in the practical use of Slimes, whether it be the use of Pyro and Cryo slimes to make Exploding Barrels, or the use of [[Anemo Slime]]s in vehicles... Perhaps this is their way of adapting to their hard lot in life.|[[Archive]]}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Cryo Slime Throw:''' Digs a [[Cryo Slime]] out of the ground and throws it at the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}}. Staggering the Grenadier during this attack will knock the Cryo Slime out of its hands. A Cryo Slime knocked out of the Grenadier's hands will stay on the ground for a period of time before exploding and dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}}.
**Although the Cryo Slime is highlighted as a {{Cryo}} entity under [[Elemental Sight]], it will not react with another element, neither will it cause a {{Cryo}} [[Elemental Absorption]] to occur.
