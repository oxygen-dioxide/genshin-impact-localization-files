You can almost feel the Lasagna becoming lodged in your throat &mdash; but don't worry, this isn't the worst part. You still have the next bite, which will be even harder to swallow.
|desc_basic      = Spread cheese, meat sauce, and Béchamel sauce on a layer of pasta strips, and place another layer of pasta strips on the top &mdash; repeat the process a few times and bake the pasta until the cheese becomes golden and bubbly. The secret of its tastiness lies in the carefully-prepared meat sauce.

'''Lasagna''' is a [[food]] item that the player can cook. The recipe can be purchased from [[Sanguinetti]] in [[Hotel Debord]] for 5,000 [[Mora]].

Depending on the quality, Lasagna restores '''30'''/'''32'''/'''34'''% of Max HP and an additional '''600'''/'''1,250'''/'''1,900''' HP to the target character. Like most foods, this can not target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]].
