==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|As per the plan written in the letter, the Feiyun Commerce Guild has bought up all the [[Cor Lapis]] there is to be bought in [[Liyue Harbor]]. Now all that remains is for Gentry Maocai to discover this, and for the real show to begin.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Xingqiu at the Feiyun Commerce Guild warehouse)
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Welcome. The final act in this drama would not be complete without you two here as audience.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You'd better believe it! We're the ones who've been doing all the work! What exactly have you been doing all this time?
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Ah, well... Naturally, I used the time to immerse myself completely in Legend of the Shattered Halberd. I managed to finish the book off, and I enjoyed every minute of it.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 xingqiu 03.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Divine Halberd and Ominous Sword, Mir and Weiyang...
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 xingqiu 04.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' The way the story develops across the first five volumes &mdash; nothing short of exemplary. But the sixth volume... words fail me.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 xingqiu 05.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' How blessed we are to have such an author grace our world with such works.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And this is related to Gentry Maocai... how?
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 xingqiu 06.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' It's not, but when something surpasses expectation to such a degree, one must show one's appreciation.
:{{DIcon}} You saw how everything would play out.
::{{A|vo xqlq004 2 xingqiu 07a.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' And it is thanks to your help that everything will play out just as I had foreseen.
:{{DIcon}} Is the ending of the book good?
::{{A|vo xqlq004 2 xingqiu 07b.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' It was rather good, thanks... I only hope that as our plan reaches its denouement, it too will live up to its expectations.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Why does Paimon have to be the only one who doesn't get what's going on? No fair!
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh... So go on then, tell me. What are we doing here? And what's this big dramatic showdown thing that's supposed to happen?
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 xingqiu 08.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Think about it. Gentry Maocai goes searching for Cor Lapis all over Liyue Harbor, and he doesn't find a single piece.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 xingqiu 09.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' He panics &mdash; without the goods, he can't fulfill his contract. And if he can't fulfill his contract, he can't stay in good standing with the [[Fatui]].
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 xingqiu 10.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' He hears a rumor that the Feiyun Commerce Guild is the culprit. Panic turns to disbelief.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 xingqiu 11.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Gentry Maocai is a hugely powerful figure in the business world. Never has anyone dared to target him like this.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 xingqiu 12.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' So regardless of whether it is revenge or a swift resolution that he seeks, he is certain to&mdash;
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 gentrymaocai 01.ogg}} '''Gentry Maocai:''' So it was you! You were the ones sticking your necks out for [[Chang the Ninth]]!
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 xingqiu 13.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Speak of the devil.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 gentrymaocai 02.ogg}} '''Gentry Maocai:''' I went everywhere trying to find someone selling Cor Lapis before I realized the Feiyun Commerce Guild had been on an acquisition spree!
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 gentrymaocai 03.ogg}} '''Gentry Maocai:''' Cor Lapis is hardly a rare mineral, and yet suddenly the stocks dry up, just like that! Explain yourselves! What is the meaning of this persecution?
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 xingqiu 14.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' We are not persecuting you, but protecting another, one to whom I am indebted. Upon witnessing an injustice, it is a perfectly normal response to rush to the aid of he who has been wronged.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 xingqiu 15.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Was it not one of your own men who said... this isn't over?
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 gentrymaocai 04.ogg}} '''Gentry Maocai:''' Hmph. You clearly don't know what's good for you. I won't beat around the bush.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 2 gentrymaocai 05.ogg}} '''Gentry Maocai:''' Master, if you please. Seize their Cor Lapis!

----

:{{A|vo xqlq004 4 agent 01.ogg}} '''Agent:''' Don't get too carried away now.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 4 paimon 01.ogg }} '''Paimon:''' Yikes! This guy looks all kinds of dangerous!

;(Fend off the Agent)
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 agent 01.ogg}} '''Agent:''' Impressive. You are no commoners... To continue this fight would be to incur greater losses than I can accept.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 gentrymaocai 01.ogg}} '''Gentry Maocai:''' Their strength is almost spent! Finish them off! The Cor Lapis is almost within our grasp...
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 agent 02.ogg}} '''Agent:''' Might I remind you that the Fatui's relationship with you extends to business matters only! I did not lend you my men to have them stir up trouble at your beck and call!
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 gentrymaocai 02.ogg}} '''Gentry Maocai:''' W&mdash;What are you saying? Master, everything I did, I did with only one thing in mind &mdash; to complete the order!
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 agent 03.ogg}} '''Agent:''' Then figure it out by yourself!
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 gentrymaocai 03.ogg}} '''Gentry Maocai:''' D&mdash;Don't go! Wait! Master! Waaaait...
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xu 01.ogg}} '''[[Xu]]:''' My lord! What are you doing here? Are you hurt?
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xingqiu 01a.ogg}} {{A|vo xqlq004 6 xingqiu 01b.ogg}}  '''Xingqiu:''' Thanks to this valiant young {{MC|man|woman|mc=1}}, I am unscathed.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "My lord"!?
:{{DIcon}} "My lord"!?
:{{DIcon}} ...I did NOT see that coming!
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 gentrymaocai 04.ogg}} '''Gentry Maocai:''' You... You are the heir of the Feiyun Commerce Guild?
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Indeed, my liege. I am Xingqiu, disciple of the [[Guhua Clan]] and second son of the Feiyun Commerce Guild manager, and I make no secret of it.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 gentrymaocai 05.ogg}} '''Gentry Maocai:''' Drats! I've been played like a fiddle!
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xingqiu 03.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Gentry Maocai, coercion and intimidation are hardly the attributes of a respectable businessman. The problems that your business practices have created, I have sought to resolve through mine.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xingqiu 04.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' I shudder to think what the Fatui will do with you if you fail to provide their Cor Lapis.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 gentrymaocai 06.ogg}} '''Gentry Maocai:''' You meddling swine! Well, go on! Tell me, what will you sell it for?
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xingqiu 05.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Since you asked Chang the Ninth for a discount of seventy percent, let's fight fire with fire, shall we?
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xingqiu 06.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Three times the market rate sounds fair, no?
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 gentrymaocai 07.ogg}} '''Gentry Maocai:''' How dare you subject me to such viciousness! This is a malicious and calculated attempt to run me into the ground&mdash;
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xingqiu 07.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' ...Deep breaths now. This is a simple decision. Will you buy, or not?
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 gentrymaocai 08.ogg}} '''Gentry Maocai:''' I... Hmph, fine, have it your way! I'll find the money somehow. Happy now!?
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xingqiu 08.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' On behalf of the Feiyun Commerce Guild, I thank you for your business and hope you will continue to do business with us in the future.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You? Funny-speaking, book-reading, Guhua-geeking, Xingqiu... Are the heir of the Feiyun Commerce Guild!?
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that massive stash of [[Mora]] you let us burn through in a day &mdash; that was from your private vault!?
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xingqiu 09.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' 'Twas but a paltry sum. I got to make a very sound investment while putting Gentry Maocai in his place. A classic two birds, one stone situation.
:{{DIcon}} Appearances really can be deceiving.
::{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xingqiu 10a.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' You're too kind. You have valor in your heart, and that is worthy of admiration.
:{{DIcon}} Don't you rich kids take calligraphy classes from a young age?
::{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xingqiu 10b.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Hahahaha, very droll... My family can always tell me from my handwriting, it's certainly one of my distinguishing features.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yikes! Paimon's been calling you Guhua Geek this whole time...
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon read in one of these martial artist novels that when rich heirs like you get angry at someone, you have their arms and legs chopped off!
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Arghhh, Paimon's toast! And sorry! Very sorry! Please don't hurt Paimon~!
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xingqiu 11.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Calm down &mdash; since you can fly, you hardly need your legs anyway.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ARGH! Save me {{Traveler}}, save me! This is not a drill. Repeat, this is not a drill!
:{{DIcon}} He's so obviously joking.
:{{DIcon}} What kind of book did you say you read this in!?
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xingqiu 12.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Jokes aside, I have the two of you two thank for this successful resolution. Really, you were a huge help.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xingqiu 13.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Meanwhile, Legend of the Shattered Halberd was positively riveting. Much obliged if you could return it to Chang the Ninth for me.
:{{DIcon}} You're making us run yet another errand!?
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xingqiu 14.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' I did nothing, and hence deserve none of his gratitude. The two of you, meanwhile, though strangers to the circumstances, stepped in and saved the day.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xingqiu 15.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' To have made such valiant and chivalrous friends is more than enough for me, my liege.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xu 02.ogg}} '''Xu:''' My lord, forgive the intrusion... It's about your father...
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xingqiu 16.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Please inform my father thusly: I have averted a disaster and earned a sizable sum of money in the process.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xingqiu 17.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Might this meritorious act compensate for my prior transgressions and earn me a few more days of freedom, perchance? Legend of the Shattered Halberd speaks of a domain that I should very much like to investigate...
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' For all your clever long words, the fact is you're just a lazybones who doesn't wanna work!
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xingqiu 18.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Hahaha... What if I told you that a reward awaits you at Chang the Ninth's palace, and not just his gratitude?
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A reward! Hmm... Well, that sweetens the deal somewhat.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xu 03.ogg}} '''Xu:''' *sigh* It seems whatever I say, there's no persuading you to stay...
:{{DIcon}} Why didn't you tell us Xingqiu was the Feiyun heir?
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xu 04.ogg}} '''Xu:''' Oh, I didn't realize you weren't aware...
:{{A|vo xqlq004 6 xingqiu 19.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Thank you in advance for returning the book for me, I will take my leave now. May we meet again, fellow merchants!

----

;(Talk to Chang the Ninth)
:{{A|vo xqlq004 7 changtheninth 01.ogg}} '''Chang the Ninth:''' Finally, you're back! This morning the pawnbroker showed up and gave me back my entire collection!
:{{A|vo xqlq004 7 changtheninth 02.ogg}} '''Chang the Ninth:''' I'm positive that you must have been behind this once again. Thank you, thank you from the bottom of my heart!
:{{DIcon}} No big deal, happy to help.
:{{DIcon}} Actually, that wasn't us.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 7 changtheninth 03.ogg}} '''Chang the Ninth:''' Please don't say that. You have no idea how much this means to me!
:{{A|vo xqlq004 7 changtheninth 04.ogg}} '''Chang the Ninth:''' The Chang family was a prestigious household in Liyue back in the day. Unfortunately, after I took over the family's affairs as heir, a series of business setbacks devoured our fortune...
:{{A|vo xqlq004 7 changtheninth 05.ogg}} '''Chang the Ninth:''' Since then, I've saved for years, hoping to restore the house to its former glory... In the end, everything was riding on this Cor Lapis deal.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 7 changtheninth 06.ogg}} '''Chang the Ninth:''' Were it not for you, this barren wasteland in the mountains would have become my final resting place.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, that's the second heir we've met in this town!
:{{A|vo xqlq004 7 changtheninth 07.ogg}} '''Chang the Ninth:''' I'm sorry, what?
:{{A|vo xqlq004 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Uh, nothing! Oh &mdash; here's your book back.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 7 changtheninth 08.ogg}} '''Chang the Ninth:''' Wonderful, Legend of the Shattered Halberd! I was beginning to think that Guhua rascal had swindled me!
:{{A|vo xqlq004 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do people really look down on the Guhua Clan so much?
:{{A|vo xqlq004 7 changtheninth 09.ogg}} '''Chang the Ninth:''' Actually, the art is centuries old, and was once held in high esteem. But now it has faded beyond recognition.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 7 changtheninth 10.ogg}} '''Chang the Ninth:''' To instigate a revival, you need to inject some fresh blood, but it's hard to attract budding young talent to a dying art... And so it becomes a vicious cycle.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 7 changtheninth 11.ogg}} '''Chang the Ninth:''' In any case, Guhua kids these days... Take that young rascal Xingqiu for instance, for all his talk about repaying kindness with kindness and whatnot, what has he done to show for it? You're the ones who've displayed a genuine sense of responsibility.
:{{DIcon}} He's better than you give him credit for.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe a Guhua renaissance is just around the corner.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 7 changtheninth 12.ogg}} '''Chang the Ninth:''' Ah, what does it matter? Anyway, you wanted the Liyue volume of the Teyvat Travel Guide, didn't you? I'll fetch it for you.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 7 changtheninth 13.ogg}} '''Chang the Ninth:''' It's yours to keep. In addition, here is but a small token of appreciation for your huge generosity.
:{{DIcon}} Finally. Our trip was worth it after all.
:{{DIcon}} I'd almost forgotten about that.
:{{A|vo xqlq004 7 changtheninth 14.ogg}} '''Chang the Ninth:''' My ore is sold and my treasured books have returned, I can't believe it...
:{{A|vo xqlq004 7 changtheninth 15.ogg}} '''Chang the Ninth:''' What?

[[File:Bookmark.png|alt=The strange bookmark that fell from Chang's book.|thumb|160x160px|Strange Bookmark]]
;(A bookmark bearing the Feiyun symbol falls out of the book...)
:{{A|vo xqlq004 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What was that? Paimon saw something fall out...
:{{A|vo xqlq004 7 changtheninth 16.ogg}} '''Chang the Ninth:''' Huh. Nothing, nothing...
:{{A|vo xqlq004 7 changtheninth 17.ogg}} '''Chang the Ninth:''' (That little rascal... surely isn't...)
