|text      = After completing a painting, I like to take it out from time to time to admire the work.

People say that the purpose of a painting is to capture the beauty of a moment for eternity. But even the highest quality paints will crack with time, and that moment's beauty will long have begun to fade.

However, I don't mind this change at all.

When I find that the paint has begun to dry and flake, I will often brush over the fissures with new strokes, and the new piece thus created is one I can continue to cherish.

Just as people enjoy regular gatherings, seeing the wrinkles left by long years of hardships, worries, and lament on one another's faces thickens the bonds between friends.

Or perhaps for a painting, time itself is a kind of pigment.

Should you have time to come for one such gathering, we will be able to add a few more brushstrokes to the painting called "You and I."
