==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Nazafarin:''' Ah, by [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]], the weight on my shoulders has truly been lifted!
:'''Nazafarin:''' Most good hearts do the two of you possess!
:{{DIcon}} You know, your manner of speech is kinda...
::'''Nazafarin:''' Ah, "dear Lesser Lord Kusanali"! You mean how I tend to say things like that? Well, you see, I have a friend from [[Fontaine]] who enjoys talking like that.
::'''Nazafarin:''' After spending too much time talking to him, I, too, began to speak in that fashion.
::'''Nazafarin:''' I would even say that I'm comparatively restrained... I just can't help myself at times. Blessed Kusanali, I'll do what I can, though.
:{{DIcon}} So, how do I use this pot of yours?
::'''Nazafarin:''' Ah, yes, sorry. I would've forgotten if you hadn't reminded me, I'll wager.
::'''Nazafarin:''' It's actually quite simple. You simply need to add the correct seasonings at the right time.
::'''Nazafarin:''' I'm sure you'll figure it out in just a couple of tries.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Nazafarin:''' See you! Thank you once again, Nazafarin's saviors!
