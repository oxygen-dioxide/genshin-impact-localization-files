'''Whopperflowers''' are dangerous plants that can be found all over [[Teyvat]], although some types of Whopperflowers are unique to specific nations. Whopperflowers will spawn with three "fruits," which it uses for specific attacks.

==Description==
Some can be found wandering in the world, but others appear disguised as a plant, most often among groups of 3 or more [[Sweet Flower]]s, [[Mint]]s or [[Small Lamp Grass]]es in the wild, ambushing the player if they try to pick up the fake plant. Less commonly, some Whopperflowers may burst from the ground when the player walks too close, and they can also spawn in [[Dragonspine]] if the snow covering them is melted.

Whopperflowers that feed for a long time end up becoming [[Regisvines]].

==Strategy==
All Whopperflowers possess a 35% damage reduction against all attacks, apart from their own element, which is 75%. Whopperflowers, when in close range of the player, tend to burrow and emerge a short distance away from them. All of their attacks deal elemental damage of their type. Whopperflowers have three "fruits" surrounding them that indicates the amount of charges for their Charged Attack.

This Charged Attack is used after a short duration of fighting the player. The Whopperflower will charge up and glow brightly where a secondary shield bar will appear under their health bar. If this shield is not disabled in 10 seconds, the Whopperflower will leave the charged state and perform a barrage of elemental attacks aimed at the player. It cannot be staggered in this state.

Depending on the Whopperflower's elemental affinity, the shield can be damaged through specific elemental reactions or weapons. A single application from the Whopperflower's weakness knocks it out straight away, which also includes weather and is not affected by character stats. Note that any physical attacks do not damage the elemental shield at all.

When the shield is destroyed, the Whopperflower is left stunned for around 15 seconds, and their passive damage reduction is reduced by 25% all across the board.

Alternatively, the Whopperflower can be drowned by knocking or manipulating it to appear in a deep body of water, but not all Whopperflowers appear near such areas.

==Disguised Whopperflowers==
In some areas, rather than a Whopperflower wandering around, it may appear as a harvestable plant. If this plant is collected, elemental particles will appear in the surrounding area before the Whopperflower bursts from the ground, dealing elemental [[AoE]] damage in the process.

*'''Sparkles:''' Any standard collectible plant will glitter, signifying that it's a collectible item. A disguised Whopperflower never glitters.
*'''Elemental Vision:''' Any standard collectible plant will show a white silhouette like the player character or non-elemental enemies when viewed in Elemental Vision. The disguised Whopperflower doesn't have that white silhouette.
*{{DIcon}} '''Icon:''' Any typical collectible plant will show with its unique icon when the collect option pops up once the player is near enough. For the disguised Whopperflower, a dialogue bubble appears instead of an icon, similar to when talking to an NPC.
*'''Seed Dispensary:''' When carrying the [[Seed Dispensary]], disguised Whopperflowers will not show up as collectable seeds, setting them apart from real plants.
*'''Glow:''' This only works at night on Whopperflowers disguised as Small Lamp Grasses; regular small lamp grass will always glow a faint blue, the disguised ones don't.
*'''Quick Pickup:''' Tapping to pick up all nearby items at once (on mobile platforms) will not "pick up" disguised Whopperflowers, and they will stay in the ground.
