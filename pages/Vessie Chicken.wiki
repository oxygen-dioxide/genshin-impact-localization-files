|desc_basic      = "Vessie" means "bladder" in Fontaine. As the name suggests, the seasoned chicken meat is enclosed in a forest boar's bladder when being poached in a meat broth. The bladder will puff out during the process like a rotund Specter. People usually only eat the chicken meat inside.
|desc_delicious  = Delicious juice locked inside the meat gives off a rich and layered aroma. This dish is considered a highly sought-after cuisine by many gourmets. After wolfing down the whole plate, one can't help but lick their lips, savoring the lingering scent. This exquisite cuisine is no doubt the crown jewel of Fontaine's gastronomy.
