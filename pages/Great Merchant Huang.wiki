{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Great Merchant Huang:''' Ho, did you come here because you've heard that an adeptus saved me, hoping that my luck might rub off on you?
:'''Great Merchant Huang:''' Well, it's fine. It's not as if I had anything else to do. Let's have a chat, then.
:{{DIcon}} An adeptus saved you?
::'''Great Merchant Huang:''' Some time ago, I picked up a stone that looked an outstretched thumb and little finger!
::'''Great Merchant Huang:''' With such a strange shape, it must surely have been a sacred stone, and so, I must be protected by the adepti!
::'''Great Merchant Huang:''' Not to mention the fact that since I obtained this mysterious stone, good things follow me wherever I go! This must be what they call "rocks fall, fortunes turn," eh?
::'''Great Merchant Huang:''' When you think about it like that, I suppose all those people at the Lantern Rite were celebrating me, then! The same goes for all the people coming to Wangshu Inn. They must all be here for my blessings, no?
::'''Great Merchant Huang:''' ...Well then, should you encounter any good fortune in the future, just remember to thank me in your heart.
:{{DIcon}} Why don't you have anything to do?
::'''Great Merchant Huang:''' Oh, just talking about it makes my blood boil.
::'''Great Merchant Huang:''' Ever since I received the protection of the adepti, I've been doing business on the road between Mondstadt and Liyue, and it was going swimmingly, too!
::'''Great Merchant Huang:''' But after a while, someone &mdash; I have no idea who, but I'm sure it was someone in our merchant guild jealous of my success &mdash; caused the higher-ups to have me posted to [[Qingce Village]]!
::'''Great Merchant Huang:''' ...Hmph. Even if I were to die here at Wangshu Inn, I would never go to Qingce Village. That destitute backwater would be the death of my talents and fortune!
:{{DIcon}} See you then.
::'''Great Merchant Huang:''' Ho, not even a "thank you"? But a great man must have a great heart. I shall not quarrel with you. No need to thank me!

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Great Merchant Huang:''' Oh ho, are you worried about the meteorites too? Worry no more! As long as you stay by one blessed by the adepti such as myself, you will remain hearty and hale!
:'''Great Merchant Huang:''' I am a man of leisure after all &mdash; I will gladly keep you company.
