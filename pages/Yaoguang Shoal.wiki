{{Description|Yaoguang Shoal is named as such in the local language because of its shallow waters and bioluminescent sea creatures that used to appear after dusk, like stars that had fallen into the sea swimming to shore.<br />The sea creatures that gave this place its name have sadly all been taken by lovers that visited the area, and the area's namesake can no longer be seen.<br />But still, if one looks hard enough, the shore may still have things to offer.|[[Expedition]] description}}
{{Location Intro|{{Lang|'''Yaoguang Shoal'''|zh=瑶光滩|zh_rm=Yáoguāng-tān}}|description=<p>It lies south of [[Mingyun Village]] and east of [[Guili Plains]].</p><p>A [[Teleport Waypoint]] is located to the eastern side of Yaoguang Shoal. There is also a [[Statue of The Seven]] located between Mingyun Village and Yaoguang Shoal, which is located high enough to glide over to either location.</p><p>To the far east side of Yaoguang Shoal is an unnamed "hidden" location dubbed '''Heart Island''' by players, for the heart-shaped puzzle located on the island. Unlocking the Luxurious Chest buried on the island requires standing on the heart with another player in Co-Op, and grants the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement "[[Unswerving]]."</p>}}
