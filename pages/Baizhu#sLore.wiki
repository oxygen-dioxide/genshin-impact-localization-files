==Trivia==
* According to [[Herbalist Gui]], the pharmacist [[NPCs|NPC]] located at [[Bubu Pharmacy]], Baizhu has a weak constitution. Qiqi claims that even as a corpse, she's in better physical shape than Baizhu.<ref name="Qiqi-VO-StS">{{Ref/VO|Qiqi|Something to Share}}</ref> Because of this, he assigns Qiqi to handle herb-picking, and Herbalist Gui to assemble the medicines.
* Baizhu has a message on the [[Feiyun Slope Bulletin Board#B|Feiyun Slope Bulletin Board]], where he tells people not to be afraid of Qiqi. After [[Hu Tao]] leaves a response, telling him to bring her to the [[Wangsheng Funeral Parlor]] so she can be put to rest, Baizhu replies "Please, Director Hu, no more jokes."
* Baizhu is likely the doctor who gives [[Anthony]] the prescriptions in "[[Miracle Medicine]]" to cure [[Anna]]'s illness. After completing three versions of the commission, Anna will actually recover.
* Baizhu's name ({{Lang|mini=1|zh=白术}}) is the name of the root of the ''Atractylodes macrocephala'' plant, which is used as an herb in traditional Chinese medicine.
* Baizhu and Changsheng may be inspired from the Chinese legend of the white snake, in which a snake immortal helps a struggling herbalist by curing his patients using his divine power. In the original Chinese story, the herbalist and the snake immortal end up marrying.
* The fact that "Changsheng" ({{Lang|mini=1|zh=长生}}) translates to "longevity" may be a reference to Baizhu's pursuit of eternal life.
*He is currently the only character in the game to possess a Dendro vision.
*In the Chinese and Japanese transcripts there are multiple people referring to Baizhu as "Mr. Bai" ({{Lang|mini=1|zh=白先生}}), all of which are translated as "Dr. Baizhu" in the English localization, marking the dispute of whether "Bai" is his last name.<ref name="Qiqi-VO-StS" /><ref>{{Ref/VO|Xiangling|About Baizhu}}</ref>
