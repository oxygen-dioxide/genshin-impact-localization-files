==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Caholom:''' Good day, I'm the high priest of the Masters of the Night-Wind. Can I help you with something?
:{{DIcon}} Ooh, a "high priest"...
::'''Caholom:''' Ah, please don't expect too much from this title. Here, a high priest is just a priest with more experience.
::'''Caholom:''' There's more than one high priest, and "high" does not refer to any kind of status or ability.
::'''Caholom:''' ...Sorry, I don't mean to shirk any responsibility by saying this. I'm just doing this in hopes that visitors will get a general understanding of our tribe.
::'''Caholom:''' Well, let's get back on track. Come see me if you need any help from us.
:{{DIcon}} Not at the moment.
::'''Caholom:''' That's good, that's good.
