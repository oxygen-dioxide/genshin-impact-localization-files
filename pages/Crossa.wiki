:{{DIcon|Shop}} What do you sell here?
::'''Crossa:''' Take your pick.
:;(Opens shop interface)
:{{DIcon}} I don't really feel anything.
::'''Crossa:''' *sigh* Must be my old sickness acting up, then.
::'''Crossa:''' I used to be a sailor, but I was injured in an accident, and ever since, I've felt like my surroundings are shaking.
::'''Crossa:''' I can't go back to being a sailor, so I can only help old friends sell things they salvage underwater to make a living.
:{{DIcon}} Take care of yourself.
::'''Crossa:''' Yeah... I think I should take a break for now.
