===Dialogue Set #1===
''Before {{cx}}.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Boyan:''' The market outlook's not been the best lately. I'd better stock up just in case...
:{{DIcon}} And you are...?
::'''Boyan:''' Ah, dear guest, how fortunate that our paths should cross! Boyan's the name, "a merchant from [[Liyue]]" is the game.
::'''Boyan:''' I transport goods from Liyue to [[Fontaine]], and goods from Fontaine to [[Sumeru]], and I pocket the difference. After all, everyone loves seeing things they've never seen before!
::'''Boyan:''' A merchant's gotta keep their eyes peeled and their ears open. And I hear that tea's been on the downswing recently, and that's worrying news.
:{{DIcon}} Goods?
::'''Boyan:''' If tea's your thing, know that the "[[Chenyu Adeptea]]" of [[Chenyu Vale]] is the very best there is.
::'''Boyan:''' But there's been trouble in the vale's water and soil, and the tea quality's dropped like a rock in a river!
::'''Boyan:''' This has troubled me day and night, and I can think of only one solution...
::{{DIcon}} What way?
:::'''Boyan:''' Why, of course, I'll stock up on goods while spreading the word that "all is well in Chenyu Vale."
:::'''Boyan:''' And once everyone finds themselves unable to secure good tea leaves... Well...
:::'''Boyan:''' Oh dear, did I say too much?
:::'''Boyan:''' Ah, but you're the sort who can keep a secret, aren't you?
:{{DIcon}} I shan't disturb you any longer.
::'''Boyan:''' *sigh* I can't keep being so down. I'll scare my customers away...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''After {{cx}}.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Boyan:''' My brand was at stake for a moment there, but now that supply's been restored, I can sleep soundly again...
:{{DIcon}} And you are...?
::'''Boyan:''' Ah, dear guest, how fortunate that our paths should cross! Boyan's the name, "a merchant from Liyue" is the game.
::'''Boyan:''' Our work's pretty tough, and risk is a constant companion, too. I haven't had a good night's sleep in several days now on account of that tea. Only now have I been able to heave a sigh of relief.
::'''Boyan:''' *sigh* When will I be able to sit in a teahouse and just enjoy a cup of Chenyu Adeptea?
:{{DIcon}} Supply problem?
::'''Boyan:''' Indeed! Businesspeople like me fear blocked roads, robbed clientele, and worst of all, cut supplies!
::'''Boyan:''' I've run routes throughout [[Teyvat]] for many years, building my reputation on naught but the excellent quality of my goods.
::'''Boyan:''' Then, a few days ago, a wealthy gentleman ordered ten carts of Chenyu Adeptea from me...
::'''Boyan:''' Only for there to be water and soil trouble in the vale... Even with the goods that I had stocked, I couldn't come up with ten carts!
::'''Boyan:''' My reputation will be destroyed if I mix the top-grade goods with average stuff, but if I don't deliver on time at all...
::{{DIcon}} You shouldn't have to worry about that now.
:::'''Boyan:''' Hmm? You're the well-informed sort, I see!
:::'''Boyan:''' Indeed, I hear tell that we have a [[Fujin|Carp Adeptus]]'s aid to thank...
:::'''Boyan:''' Well, not that I'd know much about this. All I know is that business is back on track!
:{{DIcon}} I shan't disturb you any longer.
::'''Boyan:''' Heh! There's much cheer to be had when things are going swell. Come by again if you've the time!
