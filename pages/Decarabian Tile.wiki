==Lore==
The place currently called Stormterror's Lair used to be the capital city of Decarabian, the God of Storms.<ref name="Deca Tile"/> Decarabian thought that the people worshipped him out of respect or adoration,<ref>{{Ref/Item|Debris of Decarabian's City}}</ref> but they actually only did so because of the oppression of the harsh winds.<ref name="Deca Dream"/> Decarabian worked so hard on his dream of prosperity that even [[Boreas]] was unable to make a scratch when he attacked his capital, and if not for the song of freedom that shattered the city suddenly then Decarabian's dream would have continued on forever.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Fragment of Decarabian's Epic}}</ref>
