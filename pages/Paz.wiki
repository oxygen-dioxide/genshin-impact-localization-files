==Event Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Before completing [[Opening Festivities]])
:'''Paz:''' Might this degree of simplification and generalization be too facile, I wonder...
----
;(After completing [[Mimetic Replication]])
:'''Paz:''' Was my tone too serious? Ugh, that's not good...
:'''Paz:''' Traveler? Are you here to give "Mimetic Replication" a try?
:{{DIcon|Mimetic Replication}} I'll give this one a go, why not?
::'''Paz:''' Alright. In that case, please step over here.
:{{DIcon}} I've got some other things to do.
::'''Paz:''' That's fine. My booth will be open throughout the Gala, so you can come over and try the game out any time.
