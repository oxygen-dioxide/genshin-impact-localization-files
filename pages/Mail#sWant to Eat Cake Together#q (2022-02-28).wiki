|text    = Haha... I can't believe it. Today, I received a cake from my dads.

Actually, I feel a little embarrassed but thinking that this is their way of showing their kindness to me, I couldn't possibly refuse it.

Repaying my dads is something that requires perseverance, and it is the same with friends, hehe, I understand.

Speaking of, I recently found a pretty [[Boreal Wolf's Milk Tooth|cool-looking wolf fang]]. It was hidden in a dark humid [[Domains|Domain]] and was not easy to get. It caused me quite a bit of suffering.

Well, take it as a souvenir of my adventures. I hope you like it!

Oh right, the cake is huge, I'll be waiting for you to come help eat it!
