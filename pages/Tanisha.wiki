'''Tanisha''' is a quest-exclusive NPC that appears in {{Quest|Treasure and True Interest}}.

==Profile==
Tanisha was a student at Alkami's training center and one of the 20 students assigned to Kaveh's class. Like [[Uzayr]] and [[Waiz]], she was falsely sold the dream of striking it rich as an architect, and planned to use her riches to "buy whatever she wanted."  

After Alkami's training center is closed down for investigation, she, [[Uzayr]], and a new boy named [[Shurayh]] return to the location of Alkami's classes to discuss the situation, expressing disappointment that Alkami was a scammer. She doubts that they can enroll on into the Akademiya after studying on their own, since only the best of the best are able to do it successfully.

Uzayr explains to her and Shurayh that Kaveh could always become their instructor, recalling how Kaveh promised to take him under his wing if anything happened the day before, with Shurayh skeptical that Kaveh would return.

At the end of the route, she becomes one of Kaveh's students.
