===Mountain Ranger's Notes===
This interactable is found in a vase of scrolls to the left of the wall mural.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Mountain Ranger's Notes:''' "...The terrain here is far more complex than I imagined. Perhaps [[Abyss]]al erosion is to blame, but many roads that should have been passable have been rendered useless. I marked them out roughly as we passed. The markings should last until our return trip..."
:'''Mountain Ranger's Notes:''' "...Encountered the adventurers who went missing previously... There was nothing that could be done for them, besides granting peace to their flesh..."
:'''Mountain Ranger's Notes:''' "...We must find a way to enter the city. If [[Copan]]'s statement is correct, there must be some mechanism in the city that leads to the [[Legendary Tonatiuh|sky-vessel]]..."
:'''Mountain Ranger's Notes:''' "...We should not have let such a [[Liriwu|young child]] come with us. The [[Masters of the Night-Wind]] are truly inhumane in such matters. She is ten years my sister's junior. Why, she is not yet of age to even rightly speak of marriage. We cannot let her take such a risk..."

===Nameless Priest's Notes===
This interactable is found on a desk behind a wall opening in front of the elevator on Vucub Caquix Tower: Lower Level.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:...
:[[Chupicua]], the craftsman meant to be recruited to repair the waterway facilities, gave the Recording Officer, [[Tlamachtihquetl]], three whole bags of Obsidian, claiming that he could not volunteer for such labor due to his physical condition, and hoping that these gifts might prove his earnest desire to serve the alliance's cause. The Recording Officer praised his enthusiasm and replaced him with [[Manqu (Historical)|Manqu]] from the (...)

:The waterway repairs have been suspended indefinitely. As though overnight, the deep well was completely submerged by a dark calamity, and all nearby residents were transformed into...
:&nbsp;
:The [[Cuauhtli Warriors]] sealed the entrance and incinerated the infected (...) with flames borrowed from the Holy Sovereign, claiming that all was under control.
:&nbsp;
:An old lady who had come to the temple suddenly fell to raving madness before the Recording Officer, spouting nonsense about the sun and the collapse of the alliance. The [[Kamayuq]] warriors quickly dragged her out. By the alliance's laws, she will likely be...
:&nbsp;
:...
:Over the past few days, commoners coming to the temple have been whispering. They believe that the taboo on using (...) to offer sacrifices to the [[Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night|Lord of the Night]] has aroused its rage and curses, which is why this dark, mortal illness has descended upon us.
:&nbsp;
:[[Chichiri]] tried to persuade them but to little avail. People always choose that which they wish to believe in. What can words alone accomplish?
:&nbsp;
:...
:The streets are filled the with scent of (...). By the Holy Sovereign's decree, the three areas in the southwest sector have been sealed off, and the Cuauhtli Warriors are trying to incinerate all the (...), which have decayed, yet still roam. They have had little success. How can that which is finite defy the infinite? Not to mention how they too will end up the same way once they fall...

:Nothing but despairing wails now comes on the night wind, not only from the world of the living, but also from that long-forbidden world...

===Spiritcaller's Notes (I)===
This interactable is found in a vase full of scrolls to the left of the door.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:...
:Starting today, I'm swapping to a new notebook!
:&nbsp;
:After all, (...)'s revelation indicates that we'll catch up with Uncle [[Taika]] and the others, and embark on an adventure to Cinder City together. As such, it's important to establish a sense of ritual!
:&nbsp;
:A magnificent fortress built by an ancient tyrant... Exciting, no? Hehe. No matter the danger, you can remain at ease, and safely leave it in the hands of the apprentice of the apprentice of the apprentice of Grand Master [[Sanhaj]] &mdash; and by that I mean the super awesome Spiritcaller prodigy, Liriwu!
:&nbsp;
:...
:I don't know what else I can do. Even the voices of the [[Wayob]] cannot be heard here, and no mystical art I've learned can be used. Even healing arts have no effect...
:&nbsp;
:If a more experienced mystic... No, I fear that even Grand Master Sanhaj could not dispel the curse laid upon this place.
:&nbsp;
:Ancestors above, what in the world happened here?

===Traveling Scholar's Notes===
This interactable is found on a desk near the edge of a hole at the east side of Vucub Caquix Tower: Lower Level.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:...
:If the scroll was no counterfeit, then there can be no doubt that ancient dragon artisans once created a weapon that could be used to annihilate the Abyssal threat in one fell swoop.
:&nbsp;
:The one who wove this scroll seems to hail from the era of the [[Xbalanque|One Entombed With the Primal Fire]], for he (or she) did not use the proper honorifics when addressing the priest-king [[Maghan]], instead viewing him as an "immature" negative example (such disrespect almost makes one tremble). Various details indicate that the odds of it being a forgery of a latter generation are very low &mdash; at least, no scholar or mystic I know of could do such a thing. As such, I lean heavily toward believing that this is an ancient text and that the weapon it speaks of is no figment of the imagination &mdash; moreover, the scroll clearly mentions a "treasure ship moored above the Cinder City."
:&nbsp;
:However, the recorder appears to have underestimated the damage dealt by the Abyss (understandable, considering the time that has passed). In any case, we must make for the city above the clouds, lest the Abyss...
:&nbsp;
:...
:We were deceived. In the end, we were all deceived. The essence of that "treasure that can burn away all filth" is, in truth...
:(The rest has been torn away by someone.)
