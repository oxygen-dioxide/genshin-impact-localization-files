;(Enter the [[Entanglement of Past Dreams|Domain]])
:{{A|vo bzlq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhhh... This place gives Paimon the creeps. Who knows what we're gonna find up ahead...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 2 changsheng 01.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' The digging marks here appear amateur, and rather old... I suspect it is a thieves' tunnel.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A thieves' tunnel? Hmm, Paimon has heard rumors about treasure around these parts before... Maybe it was the [[Treasure Hoarders]] that dug this tunnel?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 2 baizhu 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Judging by the tools they left behind, it's certainly a possibility.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 2 baizhu 02.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' ...But why did they abandon this place without even stopping to pack up their tools?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 2 jialiang 01.ogg}} '''Jialiang:''' ...I remember now. She took me here once and told me that she'd found a way to save me in this cave...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 2 jialiang 02.ogg}} '''Jialiang:''' But she... She said that the method would cause me to... Ugh, curses, why can't I remember what she said? Argh!
:{{A|vo bzlq003 2 baizhu 03.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Easy, Jialiang. Come on, let's keep going.

;(Defeat the monsters)
:{{A|vo bzlq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, there's a censer here... Those treasure hoarders sure made themselves at home...
:{{DIcon}} (I don't see any dust on the censer's surface...)
::{{DIcon}} ...I don't think this was left here by the Treasure Hoarders.
:{{DIcon}} (The burn marks on the inside are still fresh...)
::{{DIcon}} ...I don't think this was left here by the Treasure Hoarders.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 3 baizhu 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' ...I believe this censer was used to burn a monster-repelling incense.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A monster-repelling incense? You sure? 'Cause we did run into that group of monsters just now.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 3 baizhu 02.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' The incense was burned several days ago. If I had to guess, the monsters we fought just now were enticed here by some entity deeper inside the cave.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 3 baizhu 03.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' No doubt an encounter with the very same entity was what prompted the Treasure Hoarders to flee and abandon their designs on this cave.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 3 baizhu 04.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' After them, Jiangli was the next person to discover this place, and what lies inside... But to her, it presented an opportunity to save Jialiang's life, albeit as a last resort...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 3 jialiang 01.ogg}} '''Jialiang:''' That's right... This censer &mdash; it belongs to Jiangli! Yes, this was the place!
:{{A|vo bzlq003 3 jialiang 02.ogg}} '''Jialiang:''' This is where... I told Jiangli to give me the poison... *cough* *cough*
:{{A|vo bzlq003 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Jialiang!
:{{A|vo bzlq003 3 jialiang 03.ogg}} '''Jialiang:''' I'm fine... Let's keep going. I can feel it, s&mdash;she... is right below us... waiting for me.

;(Enter the hallway approaching the mechanism)
:{{A|vo bzlq003 4 jialiang 01.ogg}} '''Jialiang:''' I can feel it... We're getting close...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 4 jialiang 02.ogg}} '''Jialiang:''' We're almost there... It's right up ahead, the place where we made a pact together to... Ugh...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 4 changsheng 02.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' ...

;(Complete the puzzle)
:{{A|vo bzlq003 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aha! We can keep going now!
:{{A|vo bzlq003 4 baizhu 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' From the looks of it, the energy released by this mechanism can not only clear barriers, but also be conducted by corresponding mechanisms &mdash; perhaps it's something we can make use of.

;(Approach the door on the other side of the room)
:{{A|vo bzlq003 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Paimon doesn't see any barrier-breaking mechanisms around here.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 4 changsheng 01.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' There are tracks here, and it looks like they're connected to something... Shall we follow it, and see where it takes us?

;(Upon pushing any mechanism in any direction with damaged tracks or dead-ends)
::The mechanism cannot shift toward this direction...

:{{A|vo bzlq003 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look out! There's a monster next to her!
:{{A|vo bzlq003 4 baizhu 02.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' The god remains must have lured them here... Watch my back!

;(Defeat the Geovishap)
:{{color|menu|You defeated the monsters together.}}
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 jialiang 01.ogg}} '''Jialiang:''' Dr. Baizhu, how serious is it? Is she...?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 baizhu 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' I can still feel a pulse, but her condition is quite grave.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 baizhu 02.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' The god remains here are encroaching on her cognition, much as the poison in your system did to you.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 baizhu 03.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' If we don't eliminate it soon, then even if we save her life... I fear that she may never wake up again.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then what are we waiting for? Let's destroy the remains right away!
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 changsheng 01.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' ...It's not as simple as that. Don't you remember what Baizhu said?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 changsheng 02.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' The poison within Jialiang's body is inextricably linked to the god remains here.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 changsheng 03.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' ...If the source is purged, the poison in his system will stop having any effect.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah... And the poison within Jialiang's body is keeping his heart condition under control. So, if it stops working...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no! Are you saying...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 baizhu 04.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Indeed. If the god remains here are purged... then your life will come to an end.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 jialiang 02.ogg}} '''Jialiang:''' ...*sigh* I wondered when this day might come...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, wait, wait! But we've all been working our butts off to save Jialiang's life! After all that... we can't just give up on him!
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Baizhu, you're a great doctor, surely you've gotta know of some other way we can save him... right?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 baizhu 05.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' ...You could continue to take the poison, which would buy you some time. As for Jiangli... Maybe if we put our heads together, we can think of something.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 changsheng 04.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' It appears to me that she was striving to concoct your medicine for you, right up until the moment when she lost consciousness... Maybe it's her greatest wish that you will continue to take it, and live...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 jialiang 03.ogg}} '''Jialiang:''' Dr. Baizhu, give it to me straight. ...How long does Jiangli have?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 baizhu 06.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' The god remains have reached her internal organs. Under ordinary circumstances, I would give her less than three days. But if I were to treat her using a secret art...
:{{DIcon}} ...!
:{{DIcon}} You can't be thinking about that again...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 jialiang 04.ogg}} '''Jialiang:''' ...But what would be the point of that?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 jialiang 05.ogg}} '''Jialiang:''' Dr. Baizhu... I'm all too aware of the dangers of god remains. You are not the first to mention it to me.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 jialiang 06.ogg}} '''Jialiang:''' If I continue to sustain my own life using this wretched substance, not only would Jiangli have to keep risking her life to make my medicine for me, but I would have to live with the looming threat of these remains breaking out and wreaking havoc not just upon me, but my entire family...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 jialiang 07.ogg}} '''Jialiang:''' ...I know for a fact that I should have died over a decade ago. The fact that I've been around to see [[Ayu]] grow up is already a great blessing from [[Rex Lapis]].
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 jialiang 08.ogg}} '''Jialiang:''' If my choice can bring Jiangli back... then even if I... even if I... die...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Jialiang...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 jialiang 09.ogg}} '''Jialiang:''' ...Hah, after cheating death for so long, it seems I've grown somewhat addicted to life.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 jialiang 10.ogg}} '''Jialiang:''' {{Traveler}}, Dr. Baizhu... Could I have another minute with my wife? I just want to have... one final moment together. Just a moment, that's all.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 baizhu 07.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' ...Of course.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 jialiang 11.ogg}} '''Jialiang:''' Thank you, everyone. And I'm sorry that... I won't be able to repay your kindness in this life.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sniff* Jialiang... Baizhu, [[Changsheng]], is there really nothing else you can do?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 baizhu 08.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' I am sure that over the years, Jiangli will have tried all the conventional methods known to humankind. As for less-conventional methods, I have little expertise besides Changsheng's secret art...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 changsheng 05.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' Mortals are fated to grow old and pass on when their natural lifespan runs out. If it were so easy to combat the natural processes of aging and death, Jiangli would not have had to resort to unnatural methods.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What a crazy situation... Jiangli risked it all to save Jialiang's life, and now, Jialiang has to sacrifice himself to save Jiangli... Wh&mdash;What's the point of it all?
:{{DIcon}} All we can do right now...
:{{DIcon}} Is honor Jialiang's decision and bear witness.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 baizhu 09.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' I've seen many final farewells in my time... but I can never get used to it.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 changsheng 06.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' In the human realm, all things must come to an end... Is it not a fitting end to die for a worthy cause?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 changsheng 07.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' ...At least, that's what generations of masters before you have always believed.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 baizhu 10.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' The path they chose was indeed a heroic one. But when I think of those who would willingly sacrifice themselves for others...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 5 baizhu 11.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' ...I cannot help but think that theirs are the lives least deserving of death.

:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 changsheng 01.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' How does it feel to come back to life?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 baizhu 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Do you feel strange or different in any way? If so, could you describe it to me in detail?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 jialiang 03.ogg}} '''Jialiang:''' Dr. Baizhu! I... I thought that I was going to...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 baizhu 02.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Hehe, die? You did indeed. As things stand now, you're more akin to a zombie than a human.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 jialiang 04.ogg}} '''Jialiang:''' ...I'm a zombie?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 baizhu 03.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' That's right. Before we set off, I asked [[Qiqi]] to prepare an... Elixir of Immortality. With its help, you have been suspended in the space between life and death.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 baizhu 04.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Of course, this is but a crude imitation of an [[adeptus]] art. I don't expect it to extend your life indefinitely.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 baizhu 05.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Whether it will keep you alive for a few days, a few months, or a few years... I am as interested as you to find out.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 baizhu 06.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' But however long you have left, I believe it should be more than sufficient time for you to say your final goodbyes before departing the world in peace. ...I hope that [[Hu Tao|Director Hu]] finds this arrangement to be a satisfactory one?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 hutao 01.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' An "Elixir of Immortality"? How'd you cook that up? Ugh, leave it to you to work on something like that behind my back...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 baizhu 07.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' It's a work in progress that hardly lives up to its name. And it would have had no effect were it not for Jialiang's iron will.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 baizhu 08.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' In the end, I am merely a doctor. I understand very little of the great principles governing life and death, and the perpetual cycle of yin and yang.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 baizhu 09.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' All I know is that if I'm presented with a life that deserves to be saved, I will do everything in my power to save them.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 baizhu 10.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' And even this would have counted for nothing without Director Hu's assistance... After all, did you not tell Jialiang to show us the way before we set off for Qingce Village?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 hutao 02.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oops, aaaand I'm busted.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 baizhu 11.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Without Director Hu nudging things in the right direction, we may not have found Jiangli in time.
:{{DIcon}} I KNEW someone was listening in on that conversation...
:{{DIcon}} So it was Hu Tao!
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 hutao 03.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' No wonder he didn't mention the elixir back then. Hmph, I thought he was being frank and transparent with me for once, but apparently not...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 jialiang 05.ogg}} '''Jialiang:''' Ahem... Hehe, Director Hu told me to keep her suggestion a secret. But it seems nothing escapes Dr. Baizhu's attention.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 changsheng 02.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' Hehehe, never underestimate a serpent's sense of smell!
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 hutao 04.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' ...All I wanted was to help Jialiang find his missing wife as soon as possible, so that he could be on his way to the afterlife without any unfulfilled wishes making the journey more difficult than it needs to be...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 hutao 05.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Leave it to Bubu Pharmacy to snatch the perfect opportunity right outta my hands at the last hurdle! Never mind, I'll just have to put it down in the books as a deferred consideration.

:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 hutao 06.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' *sigh* One Qiqi was enough of a conundrum, the last thing I need's another one... If I'd known this was coming, I'd have whisked him off to the [[Wangsheng Funeral Parlor]] the moment I found him...

;(Follow Jiangli)
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 jiangli 05.ogg}} '''Jiangli:''' Time flies... It's been so long since we bade each other farewell in [[Chenyu Vale]].
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 jiangli 06.ogg}} '''Jiangli:''' Changsheng, you're the same as ever. You haven't changed one bit!
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 changsheng 03.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' You, on the other hand, have changed a lot.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 jiangli 07.ogg}} '''Jiangli:''' ...You're right. My younger self would have never imagined that things would one day turn out this way.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 6 jiangli 08.ogg}} '''Jiangli:''' ...Or that you'd turn out this way, Baizhu.

;(Approach the roofed corridor)
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 jiangli 01.ogg}} '''Jiangli:''' ...I've taken a look at your Elixir of Immortality. It's not altogether dissimilar from the poison I concocted in terms of the way it functions.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' ...I have to say, Jiangli, it was a stroke of genius to use poison to maintain life. I hope you're not too upset at me for... copying your methods?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 jiangli 02.ogg}} '''Jiangli:''' No, not at all. With your intellect, even if you'd never seen my poison, I believe you would have eventually arrived at the same approach.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 jiangli 03.ogg}} '''Jiangli:''' But I'm still impressed by how quickly you managed to gain such a thorough understanding of it. Jialiang's still only been in your care for a few days.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 jiangli 04.ogg}} '''Jiangli:''' Not just that &mdash; you even managed to improve upon the original formula. That cannot be explained by intellect alone...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 jiangli 05.ogg}} '''Jiangli:''' Baizhu, be honest with me... Did you try out some of the poison on yourself?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 changsheng 01.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' Hah! Told you the truth would surface sooner or later.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 jiangli 06.ogg}} '''Jiangli:''' ...Life force isn't the only thing that Changsheng's contract lets you transfer between bodies, is it?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 02.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' ...Nothing gets past you, Jiangli.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 03.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' You are correct. Besides life force, Changsheng's secret art also allows for the transfer of toxins and diseases.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 04.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' When I treated Jialiang for the second time, I transferred some of the poison from his body into my own. Not only did this allow me to alleviate the burden on him, but it also gave me an opportunity to study its properties...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 05.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' There is no need to worry about any long-term consequences to my health, however. Now that the source has been destroyed, any remaining poison in me will have already dissipated.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 jiangli 07.ogg}} '''Jiangli:''' ...But you took such a huge risk. If we hadn't destroyed the gods' remains back there, then even you might have&mdash;
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 jiangli 08.ogg}} '''Jiangli:''' ...Hah. What am I saying? I'm in no position to criticize you for this.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 jiangli 09.ogg}} '''Jiangli:''' The reason I left our [[Baizhu's Master|Master]] and went into hiding all those years ago was that he was getting old, and I didn't want him using up any more of his own life force to treat my husband.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 jiangli 10.ogg}} '''Jiangli:''' But in the end, how were my methods any different? I risked one life to save another. And then you tried the poison on yourself, too... It looks like both of us have ended up going the same way as our master before us.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 jiangli 11.ogg}} '''Jiangli:''' Are all disciples of Chenyu Vale destined to turn out this way? To live a short life, having given away our own for the sake of others? To fight relentlessly against the natural course of life and death, whatever the cost? ...Maybe our fate is sealed the moment we decide to study medicine.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 06.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' ...We are doctors, Jiangli. We ought never say that anyone's fate is sealed.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 jiangli 12.ogg}} '''Jiangli:''' Baizhu, I can tell that over the years, you've used the contract with Changsheng to transfer many diseases and toxins to yourself. There are so many, that some of them I don't even recognize...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 jiangli 13.ogg}} '''Jiangli:''' Can you... still stop before it's too late?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 07.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' I think you know the answer, Jiangli. Every one of us from Chenyu Vale believes in the same thing...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Food's ready!
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 ayu 01.ogg}} '''Ayu:''' Mom! Come and join us!
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 ayu 02a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo bzlq003 7 ayu 02b.ogg}}--> '''Ayu:''' {{Traveler}} taught me a load of new recipes, and said even dad'll be able to taste them! Come and try them out!
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 jiangli 14.ogg}} '''Jiangli:''' Yes, darling, mom'll be there in just a second... Hey, slow down!
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 jiangli 15.ogg}} '''Jiangli:''' ...Baizhu, I know I won't be able to convince you, but... please don't forget that, if one day, you're not around anymore...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 jiangli 16.ogg}} '''Jiangli:''' Qiqi, [[Herbalist Gui|Gui]], and all the friends who have grown fond of you... they will all miss you dearly.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 08.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' There's no need to worry, Jiangli. I know what I'm doing.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 jiangli 17.ogg}} '''Jiangli:''' *sigh*... I can only hope so.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 09.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' ...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Baizhu... What did Jiangli mean by "not around anymore"? Are you gonna be okay?
:{{DIcon}} Also, when Changsheng was talking about "fate"...
::{{DIcon}} What did she mean, exactly?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 changsheng 02.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' ...Every single mortal I've ever contracted with, including Baizhu and Jiangli's Master, has passed away at a young age.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, that doesn't make any sense! You said that the contract with you helps people live longer!
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 10.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' *sigh* ...It is a very long story...

::'''Baizhu's Master:''' But even the most ingenious mortal medicine
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' Could not stay the tide of disease
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' And after working tirelessly for many years
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' Even his dearest loved ones fell sick

::'''Baizhu's Master:''' The doctor sought the Herblord
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' But found only a white snake, its breathing weak and its power all but spent
::'''Changsheng:''' "Sign this contract, and let our lives be joined"
::'''Changsheng:''' "Then I will impart to you the secret art of healing"
::'''Changsheng:''' "But be warned: This art will harm your own health"
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' With means beyond human ken
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' The doctor could now reverse the process of death
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' And yet, the time still came to say goodbye
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' Only now... the one departing was the doctor, his life force spent
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' His final act in life was to pass on the contract
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' To his final patient: his favorite disciple
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' The disciple chose to dedicate their life to saving the lives of others...
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' And generation upon generation followed in these footsteps
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' Since I inherited this contract, I've always respected the path taken by my predecessors
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' And followed it myself unquestioningly
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' That is, until...
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' I tried to use the art to save my own disciple's beloved
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' She begged me not to use up my own life force
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' She said that this art is a poisoned chalice, an evil and unnatural practice...
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' She did not wish to sacrifice one life for the sake of another, when both were lives she treasured
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' ...Only then did it occur to me: Did I not suffer when my master passed away
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' Just as patients' families do at their loved ones' deathbed?
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' Are not the lives cut short by this contract
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' Just as worthy of saving as any patient's?
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' What is this contract to us? Medicine, or poison?
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' Alas, I no longer have enough time left to find the answer
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' I entrust to your care both Changsheng and this final question
::'''Baizhu's Master:''' May you find a remedy for this conundrum, which has ailed us so...

::'''Changsheng:''' And you? What's your answer?
::'''Baizhu:''' ...If I abandoned the contract and left you without a host, what would happen?
::'''Changsheng:''' Hmm... I suppose I'd spend my final moments taking a nice nap on Mt. Yaojun
::'''Changsheng:''' Then, I'd be reunited with my old friends, and your predecessors
::'''Baizhu:''' Then it's decided
::'''Baizhu:''' If there's a life in front of me that deserves to be saved
::'''Baizhu:''' Why shouldn't I do everything within my power to save it?
::'''Changsheng:''' ...*sigh* Once again, it's the same answer
::'''Changsheng:''' So be it. Close your eyes
::'''Changsheng:''' ...Who knows how many more people will take on this contract
::'''Baizhu:''' None
::'''Baizhu:''' This contract... will end with me
:;(Baizhu opens his eyes to reveal that his irises have changed from red to yellow with vertical pupils)
:;(Cinematic ends)
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 changsheng 03.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' ...My contract has strict requirements on the host's natural temperament. All my hosts have been most pure of heart.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 11.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' But when one with an altruistic nature gains access to this art, they are more seduced than the average person by the miracle of overturning the laws of life and death.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 12.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Though they know better than anyone else the fate that awaits them, when faced with the sorrows of humanity and the pain of losing their nearest and dearest, they cannot help but reach beyond human means.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 13.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' ...They are like moths that throw themselves into the flame, seeking a glimmer of hope in a dark world filled with pain and suffering.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... Baizhu, does that mean...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 14.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Heh... I suppose that would make me a moth that yearns for the light, but doesn't want to be burned to a crisp.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 15.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Changsheng's art can transfer pain and suffering between people, but it cannot reduce the total amount of pain in the world. It's just like we witnessed: either Jialiang feared for Jiangli's life, or Jiangli grieved over Jialiang's sacrifice.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 16.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' I have nothing but the utmost respect for my predecessors who sacrificed their lives for their principles, but I do not wish to join their ranks... nor do I wish to pass on this contract to anyone else in the future.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? But, didn't you already transfer a ton of diseases onto yourself?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 17.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' What makes a poison, "poison"? And what makes a disease, a "disease"? When it comes down to it, are not both mechanisms that affect the operations of the human body?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 18.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' If disease is defined as deviation from normal functioning, then who knows... perhaps the true Elixir of Immortality could in fact be a kind of poison?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 19.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Many may view the notion of searching for immortality in poisons and illnesses as a flagrant violation of the natural order. But to me, it is no different from the way our ancestors tested the medicinal qualities of herbs by sampling each and every one.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 20.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' I don't want those who come after me to lose their lives to this contract, nor do I wish for Changsheng to perish from losing her host... This leaves only one solution, doesn't it?
:{{DIcon}} The Elixir of Immortality...
:{{DIcon}} You have to become immortal yourself...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 21.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Precisely. I will be Changsheng's final host, and the tradition of passing down the contract will end with me.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 changsheng 04.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' ...Even the gods of old struggled to achieve true immortality. First you want to save others, then you want to save yourself. Now you even want to save me... You're getting greedy, Baizhu.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 22.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Mmm... but isn't wanting to have it all what makes us human?
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 23.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' ...For a selfish moth like me, who's afraid of the flame, yet yearns for the light, the only path forward is up towards the moon.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh*... For once, Paimon just does not know what to say.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 ayu 03a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo bzlq003 7 ayu 03b.ogg}}--> '''Ayu:''' Dr. Baizhu! {{Traveler}}! What are you still chatting about? The food's about to get cold!
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 qiqi 01.ogg}} '''Qiqi:''' We also have coconut milk, for Changsheng and Paimon...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ummm... Okay fine, let's go grab some food! Paimon has a bunch of burning questions, but they can wait till after we've eaten.
:{{DIcon}} Oh, Paimon...
:{{DIcon}} Leave some grub for me.
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 changsheng 05.ogg}} '''Changsheng:''' Ah, I do envy Paimon sometimes. Eating her fill is enough to satisfy her body and mind...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 24.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Hehe, true. And yet... although we call them simple pleasures...
:{{A|vo bzlq003 7 baizhu 25.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Are such things as these not precisely why we mortals cling desperately to the life we have?

;(Interact with the message on the door of Jiangli's residence, optional)
:'''Message:''' "We're going to [[Natlan]]! Mom told me that there could be herbs there that aren't in any medicine books."
:'''Message:''' "I've heard that [[Toyac Springs|the hot springs]] in Natlan help with muscle relaxation and blood circulation. Perhaps they will be beneficial for Jialiang..."
:'''Message:''' "Let's not think too much about that for now, and just focus on the journey! We are going to enjoy every moment we can spend as a family."
:'''Message:''' (At the end of the message, you see three crudely drawn stick figures. It shows a man, a woman and their son, holding hands as they set off on a new journey.)
