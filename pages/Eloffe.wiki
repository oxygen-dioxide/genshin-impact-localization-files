===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Eloffe:''' Welcome to Chioriya Boutique. Is there anything you need?
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about Chioriya Boutique...
::'''Eloffe:''' This clothes shop was opened by Ms. [[Chiori]], a renowned [[Inazuma]]n designer.
::'''Eloffe:''' She has gained great favor in Fontaine's fashion world by incorporating elements of "resistance" and "revolution" into her designs.
::'''Eloffe:''' I know this sounds like tooting one's own horn, but it is no exaggeration to say that Ms. Chiori has sparked a real fashion craze here in our nation.
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Eloffe:''' I'm Eloffe, a staff member here at the boutique. I'm in charge of taking pre-orders and receiving clients... and placating them, at times.
::{{DIcon}} Placating clients?
:::'''Eloffe:''' Our boss's manner of speech is... on the straightforward side. Takes some getting used to, if you catch my drift.
:::'''Eloffe:''' But not to worry. Chioriya Boutique's work is always up to standard.
:::'''Eloffe:''' This is why some customers might leave in a huff, but they'll be back in a few days to commission clothes all the same.
:{{DIcon}} I don't really need anything at the moment.
::'''Eloffe:''' I look forward to your next visit.
