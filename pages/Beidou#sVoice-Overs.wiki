|vo_08_06_tx         = One year on the eve of the [[Lantern Rite Festival|Lantern Rite]], we ran into a storm as we were returning to port. Try as we did, we only made it back to [[Liyue Harbor]] in the dead of night, long after the lanterns had all been released. As I looked towards [[Guyun Stone Forest]], I saw an [[Adepti|adeptus]], floating in the air, in the form of what appeared to be a young boy.

|vo_08_09_tx         = Yaoyao always comes on board to play when we're in the harbor. Trouble is, when it's time for her to go she gives you the puppy eyes, and no one has the heart to send her away... Means we're always cutting it quite close by the time we manage to set sail.
