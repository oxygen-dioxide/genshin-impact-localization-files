{{Quest Description|The hydrologist Woliu seems distressed about something...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Woliu)
:'''Woliu:''' The flow of water is good, and the conditions of the waters in the surrounding areas are quite satisfactory as well... This is great.
:'''Woliu:''' I should still keep an eye on the surrounding soil environment, though. Looks like I'll have to place a few more instruments...
:{{DIcon}} Did something happen here?
:'''Woliu:''' Ah, are you the [[Traveler]]? Could you spare a moment? I could really... use a favor from you.
:'''Woliu:''' Please allow me to introduce myself first. I'm Woliu, a hydrologist. I'm currently conducting some investigations in [[Chenyu Vale]] for research purposes.
:{{DIcon}} Why would a hydrologist need to keep an eye on the soil environment?
:'''Woliu:''' That's a very good question. The short answer is that the study of hydrology concerns more than just the movement of water.
:'''Woliu:''' The mountainous terrain, the flow of the streams, the geology of the land, the weather of the area, and even the daily lives of the human residents who call this place their home... they all affect the hydrology of the vale.
:'''Paimon:''' P&mdash;Paimon can't say she really understands, but that definitely sounds super complicated...
:'''Woliu:''' It is indeed quite complicated. Still, conducting research here is far easier than conducting research in [[Fontaine]].
:'''Woliu:''' I kept running into all kinds of problems trying to place even a single hydrology device in Fontaine. They'd get attacked by the aquatic wildlife one day, and be swept away by the currents the next...
:'''Woliu:''' And that's not even going into all of those underwater mechanical things that archons-know-who placed down there... Ugh, just remembering all of this is giving me a headache.
:{{DIcon}} So, about the favor you'd like to ask of us...
:'''Woliu:''' Ah, that... Well, it's really a small thing. I'd like to request that you help me place these monitoring instruments on that mountain.
:'''Woliu:''' I have just ordered these mechanical instruments from Fontaine. Once placed, they will continuously bore down through the earth until they've obtained the deep soil samples that I require.
:'''Woliu:''' With those samples, I'll be able to measure the influence the local hydrology has had on the soil quality of the nearby mountains.
:{{DIcon}} That sounds straightforward enough.
:{{DIcon}} It's been a while since we got such a simple commission.
:'''Woliu:''' If that's... what you think. I've been meaning to hire a few adventurers for the task, but no one has accepted my commission so far, and I've heard that there are a lot of Treasure Hoarders in the area...
:'''Woliu:''' But judging from your looks, you're not at all scared of those bullies, are you?
:{{DIcon}} Just leave them to me.
:{{DIcon}} If they're smart, they should be scared of me.
:'''Woliu:''' Then, I leave the placement of the instruments to you. All you need is to place them on the nearby hill.
:'''Woliu:''' I still need to stay here to adjust some more instruments. Just come back to me once you've placed the batch that I've given you.
;(Obtain {{Item|Woliu's Drilling Device}})

;(Talk to Woliu again, optional)
:'''Woliu:''' That position right up ahead looks quite promising... Hmm... Maybe I'll take a look by the drawbridge in a bit.

;(Place the Drilling Device on the mountain north of Woliu)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Would this place do? Ah well, let's just trust that this device will do its job.

;(Place the Drilling Device on the mountain south of Woliu)
:'''Paimon:''' D&mdash;Don't look down! It's so high up here. Let's just get out of here once we've placed the instruments!

;(After placing both Drilling Devices)
:'''Paimon:''' Well, that should be enough! Let's go back and find Woliu. It's not every day that we just get a simple commission like this, hehe. Easy-peasy, eh?

;(Talk to Woliu)
:'''Woliu:''' ...These adjustments ought to do it.
:'''Woliu:''' Ah, have you placed the instruments already? Thank you so much.
:'''Woliu:''' Once I'm done placing this one, I'll give you your reward.
:{{DIcon}} You could have just given it to me alongside the rest of the batch.
:'''Woliu:''' Thank you for your kindness. Unfortunately, this instrument is somewhat special. It requires some additional adjustments and calibrating, and I wouldn't want to trouble you that much.
:'''Woliu:''' Let's go to that cliff over there and place it, then I'll give you your reward.
:'''Paimon:''' That sounds really hard... Have you always worked like this?
:'''Woliu:''' Haha, at least now, I only need to place my instruments down on the ground. In a previous expedition, I actually had to figure out a way to place one in the middle of a raging river...
:{{DIcon}} Couldn't you just take a boat over there?
:'''Woliu:''' I mean, if all I needed to do was to drop the instrument, then sure, I could have just taken a boat, dropped it in the middle of the river, and left...
:'''Woliu:''' But I was trying to measure the intensity of the water flow, so I had to keep that specialized instrument stationary within the heart of the stream so that it would neither float to the top nor sink to the bottom...
:'''Woliu:''' Thankfully, there was a drawbridge above that river. Had there not been a bridge, I'd have had to ask some people to help me draw a rope between the two mountains...
:'''Woliu:''' And then hang the device onto one of the ropes, before using another rope to move it to the center of the river and drop it in the water.
:'''Woliu:''' Anyway... There's no point talking about that now. It's not like that's something we'll have to deal with... That said, we'll still pass by a drawbridge on our way to our destination.
:'''Woliu:''' Come this way. That drawbridge isn't far from here.

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Woliu:''' Hmm... It should be over this way. The scenery here is quite excellent, so we can take our time.
:'''Woliu:''' A lot of professional photographers came here to record the scenery during the "[[Our Chenyu Vale Trek]]" photography competition not too long ago.
:'''Woliu:''' You'll be able to get a great view of the surrounding vistas from on top of the bridge.

;(Approach the bridge)
:'''???:''' Help! Is anyone there? Help!

;(Approach the Treasure Hoarders)
:'''???:''' Guard that other end well, brother! Let's see how much further they can run!
:'''???:''' Ugh, I'm so tired... Why do I have to cut off their escape path?
:'''???:''' Help! Help!!
:'''Paimon:''' Th&mdash;They are... Ah well, never mind that now! Let's save them first!

;(Cross the bridge)
:'''Paimon:''' There are Treasure Hoarders on both sides of the bridge... Be careful, {{Traveler}}!

;(Defeat all the Treasure Hoarders)
:{{Black Screen|After chasing away the Treasure Hoarders, you bring the people they cornered to a nearby pavilion to catch their breath.}}
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Thank you, I really don't know how to express my gratitude...
:{{DIcon}} You are... Ms. Qiu?
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Ah... It's you, {{Traveler}}! Well, fancy running into you again! This is really... This is the second time that you've done me such a huge favor!
:'''Paimon:''' Weren't you guys in Fontaine learning how to shoot a film? How are you already back in Liyue?
:{{DIcon}} Have you already mastered the art of filmmaking?
:'''[[Yifeng]]:''' Well, rather than that...
:'''[[Xingye]]:''' It'd probably be more accurate to say we've been forced to make some quick [[Mora]] first.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' You two...
:'''Yifeng:''' Mr. [[Geisert]] is indeed a master filmmaker, and he's given us a lot of very useful advice. However...
:'''Xingye:''' The films that he's helped us shoot have all really focused on big ideas and themes. As for the actual plot, or the world and things that were intended to be featured...
:'''Yifeng:''' They kind of... In Mr. Geisert's words, they were "left behind the scenes."
:'''Xingye:''' But we had looked into filmmaking in the first place to create a film that could bring attention to Chenyu Vale's excellent teas. If we had stayed with Mr. Geisert, we would have gone nowhere. So...
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' So! I made the executive decision to put a pause on our studies and come back to shoot a documentary. We will use this opportunity to put our knowledge to the test!
:'''Yifeng:''' ...Well, and because we'd just about run out of funds.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' H&mdash;Hey, haven't I told you about my plan already? As long as this documentary becomes a smash hit, we'll make our investment back in no time.
:'''Yifeng:''' Well, and then we found ourselves cornered by Treasure Hoarders on a drawbridge. Thankfully, the great {{Traveler}} came to save us.
:{{DIcon}} Isn't this place... a bit far from Qiaoying Village?
:{{DIcon}} But why are you here if you want to photograph Qiaoying Village?
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' *sigh* Well, I wanted to get some majestic shots of the scenery, so the film would look a bit more imposing...
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' But we got a bit too distracted while shooting and caught the attention of those Treasure Hoarders. We fled all the way here but were still cornered by them in the end...
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, so the "pro photographers" Woliu mentioned earlier were...
:'''Woliu:''' Yep, they were Ms. Qiu and her assistants.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Wh&mdash;Where did you suddenly just pop up from, Ms. Woliu? I&mdash;I swear I didn't see you at all before now...
:'''Woliu:''' I just hid myself very well.
:{{DIcon}} So you already know each other...
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' I mean, Ms. Woliu is an expert hydrologist. No one knows these lands better than her.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' We'd consulted her several times before this on the best places to shoot.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' We've even tried to get her to join us! But she said that she could only consider once she's finished with her work.
:'''Yifeng:''' Boss, um... While we were running away earlier, we seemed to have, um, left the case containing our film and equipment on the ground...
:'''Xingye:''' I think... All the work that we've done so far is in that case...
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' ...
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Ms. Woliu! {{Traveler}}! Paimon! Thank you for everything! Wh&mdash;When you are next free, please find me in Qiaoying Village!
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' After all... You've saved our lives, so we've got to prepare a reward in return!
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' But for now, we must be off and away! Hurry! Where did we leave that box!? We need to go back for it!
:{{Black Screen|Ms. Qiu and her assistants leave in a great hurry...}}
:'''Paimon:''' That film case... sure has gone through a lot...
:'''Woliu:''' They say that good things often come at the end of many tribulations. I'm sure Ms. Qiu's film will turn out to be a hit.
:'''Woliu:''' Anyway, let me give you your reward. I'll go place my final instrument shortly, and then... probably go check on Ms. Qiu to see how she's doing.
:'''Woliu:''' I've got to find her fast, or she'll probably be off archon-knows-where again, shooting her film.
:'''Woliu:''' Hmm, I suppose she did just say that she can be found at Qiaoying Village. I'll just go check that out later.
;(Obtain {{Item|A Bag of Mora (Temporary Acclimatization)|text=A Bag of Mora}})

;(Talk to Woliu again, optional)
:'''Woliu:''' I hope Ms. Qiu will be able to shoot the film of her dreams while ensuring her personal safety.
----
;(Approach the group in Qiaoying Village)
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' *sigh* Maybe we should've grabbed the Qiaoying Village shots first after all...
:{{DIcon}} Is everything okay?
:{{DIcon}} Looks like you didn't lose any equipment, at least.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Ah, {{Traveler}}, Paimon! Thanks to you, we were able to save all of our stuff.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' I suppose, though, that if we were to ever return to that area in the future, we shall have to bring a few adventurers with us.
:'''Paimon:''' So, um, about your feature film on tea... How is the shooting for that going?
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Well... We've currently got...
:'''Xingye:''' A good opening sequence.
:'''Yifeng:''' And a good artistic vision.
:{{DIcon}} So... you haven't shot much at all!?
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Well, you see... We're currently a little short on money. As a master filmmaker, Mr. Geisert's tuition doesn't exactly come cheap...
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Even though we've already shot a few smaller films, and made some Mora from that, a feature film of this length just burns through your budget as if it's nothing.
:'''Xingye:''' Especially since Boss also turned down a few potential sponsors.
:'''Yifeng:''' And refused many invitations to collaborate.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Hey, what do you two know!? This was all so that we can create an excellent film that reflects our standards and our vision!
:'''Xingye:''' But Boss... Didn't we start this film company because we wanted to make money...
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' I... Stop worrying about that for now! Just go and set up the equipment!
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' {{Traveler}}, this is your reward. Thank you for always lending me your support.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Once I've made the film of my dreams, I'll be sure to invite you over for the premiere, and then also take you out for tea.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Yifeng, Xingye, make sure you get the best angle for our lighting! We're gonna get this in one take, you hear me?
:'''Xingye:''' But Boss, we don't even have any actors here with us...
:'''Yifeng:''' Isn't it all up to chance whether or not we can grab a scenery shot in one take...?
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' J&mdash;Just hurry up and set up the equipment! And then wait here!

;(Talk to Ms. Qiu, Yifeng or Xingye again, optional)
:'''Xingye:''' Boss, just how long are we going to wait here? We've been shooting for such a long time already...
:'''Yifeng:''' Boss, I really feel like luck's not on our side today regarding this shot...
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' J&mdash;Just wait for a little more. Just a little more...
