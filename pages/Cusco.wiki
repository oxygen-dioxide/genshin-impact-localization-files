==Profile==
Cusco is the father of [[Chuychu]] and the adoptive father of [[Chasca]], after she was reintroduced to human society when she became of age. Alongside his wife, the family maintained a stable relationship, though he would frequently worry about both his daughters since they were frequently on the front lines. Learning of her condition, Cusco had Chasca agree to undergo quarterly checkups to ensure her symptoms weren't flaring up.

<!--chronological order of lore, so this section assumes the player completed [[The Rainbow Destined to Burn]]-->
During the Abyssal invasion, Cusco managed to escape to safety, but Chuychu died while making her way to the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]]. Cusco and his wife mourned their blood daughter's death, not wanting to lose their adoptive daughter either and asked the [[Traveler]] to remind her of her appointment. After [[Coya]] fainted from exhaustion when they were dealing with [[Allpa]]'s coup, Chasca brought the qucusauri to Cusco for a checkup, where he found nothing wrong. He told her that she had simply overexerted herself and that Coya was just like her, being reckless and living dangerously. He even told her that his wife had written a letter to him, since she was on business at the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]], scolding him for not being more vigilant around her.
