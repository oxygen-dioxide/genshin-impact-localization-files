{{Dialogue start}}

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Ebeid, optional)
:'''Ebeid:''' (I must hurry up.)

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Hilmi, optional)
:'''Hilmi:''' (Hehe, I'm the fastest!)

;(Talk to Ebeid or Hilmi)
:'''Ebeid:''' {{MC|m=Mister|f=Miss}}! Wait!
:'''Ebeid:''' Are you... an adventurer? I mean the kind of adventurers who are skilled in battle and travel to many places.
:{{DIcon}} You could say that.
:{{DIcon}} That's sort of accurate.
:'''Ebeid:''' Look, Hilmi! I said {{MC|m=he|f=she}} must be an adventurer!
:'''Hilmi:''' But don't adventurers always wear those green outfits?
:{{DIcon}} I'm too skilled to need that green outfit.
:{{DIcon}} I'm quite special and don't need that outfit.
:'''Hilmi:''' Wow!
:'''Ebeid:''' Wow!
:'''Ebeid:''' In that case, you can definitely help us!
:'''Ebeid:''' Do you see that big warehouse in the village? [[Habachi]] said we must keep watch over it because many important things are kept there.
:'''Hilmi:''' He also told us that if any bad guys come, he'll shut down the lift and cut off the bridge.
:'''Ebeid:''' But the lift is some distance away from the warehouse. To shut it down, Habachi will have to run really fast.
:'''Ebeid:''' We thought we could train with him, but he's been ignoring our offer...
:'''Hilmi:''' How I wish he could instead ignore us when we try to sneak out to skip stones! Like that's gonna happen... Hmph!
:'''Ebeid:''' Ahem, anyway, if Habachi happens to be exhausted when the bad guys come, we'll shut down the lift for him.
:'''Ebeid:''' You're an adventurer, so you must be a fast runner, too! Please train with us.
:{{DIcon}} Sure. Let's run together.
:{{DIcon}} You can trust Habachi...
::'''Ebeid:''' Play with us, please!
::'''Ebeid:''' Play with us, please, nice {{MC|m=Mister|f=Miss}}!
::{{DIcon}} Okay...
:'''Ebeid:''' Yay! Thank you!
:'''Hilmi:''' We've chosen the starting point. Let's go there!
:'''Hilmi:''' Hehe, I will be your rival. For the record, I'm a really good runner!
----
;(After the cutscene)
:'''Ebeid:''' Ready...
:'''Paimon:''' You can do it! But don't push yourself too hard...
:'''Ebeid:''' Go!
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, gone just like that! Hurry, catch up with him!
:'''Ebeid:''' Hilmi, keep going! {{MC|m=Mister|f=Miss}}, keep going, too!
----
;(If the player wins the race)
::'''Hilmi:''' Huff... You ran so fast!
::{{DIcon}} Because I&mdash;I'm an adventurer...
::{{DIcon}} Because I've run many, many times.
::'''Ebeid:''' We aren't fast enough. Habachi can definitely catch us... What do we do?
::'''Hilmi:''' Besides, he's not even out of breath each time he catches us. He doesn't even look like he was running.

;(If the player loses the race)
::'''Hilmi:''' *huff* I&mdash;I won!
::{{DIcon}} C&mdash;Congratulations...
::{{DIcon}} You were... almost flying...
::'''Hilmi:''' Hehe, I told you how good I am! You underestimated me, didn't you?
::'''Ebeid:''' But even if we can run this fast, we can't outrun Habachi. I just don't understand why.

:{{DIcon}} There might be a shortcut.
:{{DIcon}} He might be playing some trick.
:'''Ebeid:''' Is that so? But I don't think there's any shortcut around.
:'''Hilmi:''' {{MC|m=Mister|f=Miss}}, can you play with us next time...
:'''Hilmi:''' I mean... train with us! Um... Let's train that "tracking in the wilderness" thing!
:'''Ebeid:''' You're right! Since we can't outrun Habachi, we can get around him...
:'''Hilmi:''' We tried that before, didn't we? But it never worked...

==Trivia==
* The name of the quest is probably a reference to an iconic scene from the 1994 American movie {{w|Forrest Gump|''Forrest Gump''}}, which is based on the 1986 novel of the same name.
