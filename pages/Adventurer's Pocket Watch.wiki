{{Description|It's easy to lose track of time when you're adventuring where the sun doesn't shine, whether that's the depths of the abyss or the ruins of a lost city.}}
'''Adventurer's Pocket Watch''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Adventurer]].

==Description==
A pocket watch that once belonged to an adventurer. It was crafted by a master watchmaker with simplicity and practicality in mind, aligning with the philosophy of the Adventurers' Guild.<br />The adventurer spent most of his days in darkness. The rhythmic sound of its moving hands was the only proof he had of the passage of time.<br />Long after he had grown accustomed to a normal life, having given up the adventurer lifestyle he once loved so dearly,<br />this forgotten pocket watch still sat quietly in the cabinet, waiting for its next adventure.
