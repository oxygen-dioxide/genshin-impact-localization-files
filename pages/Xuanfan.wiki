:'''Xuanfan:''' Can you believe it? I caught [[Captain Beidou]]'s eye!
:{{DIcon}} Captain Beidou?
::'''Xuanfan:''' That's right! It happened just as I was starting to think that I should leave the fleet due to my dismay at our lack of results...
::'''Xuanfan:''' It was at that moment that the "[[Alcor]]" passed us by, and I saw Captain Beidou standing at the helm...
::'''Xuanfan:''' ...And in that moment, our eyes met.
::'''Xuanfan:''' I just happened to be on her left, and that courage of hers that subdued the seas themselves pierced my heart in one glance.
::{{DIcon}} Isn't that the side with the eyepatch?
::'''Xuanfan:''' Yes, of course, but ah, details!
::'''Xuanfan:''' She truly is great! With but a single look, she was able to save the spent soul of a sorrowful sailor...
:{{DIcon}} Congratulations.
::'''Xuanfan:''' Thank you! And thank Captain Beidou for setting my sailor's soul afire once again!
