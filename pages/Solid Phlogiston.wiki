'''Solid Phlogiston''' is an exploration mechanic in [[Natlan]]. 

It can appear as orange-and-blue crystals, such as in the [[Sulfurous Veins]], or as uniform orange blocks, such as in the [[Land of Myriad Megaliths]]. The people of Natlan use it to create a variety of objects, including [[Phlogiston Explosive Barrel]]s, [[Tutorial/Recon Rings and Recon Targets|Recon Targets]], and [[Tutorial/Drop down, Solid Phlogiston Nail!|Solid Phlogiston Nails]]. 

Only [[Tepetlisaur]]s, [[Children of Echoes]] characters, and [[Mavuika]] can move through solid Phlogiston.
