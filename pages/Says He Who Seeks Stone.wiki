{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Muning)
:'''Muning:''' Archaic Stone... *sigh* In all years I've worked in The Chasm, I've barely seen even one. What are the big shots at [[Huishan Hall]] thinking...
:'''Muning:''' Let them do the job and they'll know how impossible the task is.
:'''Paimon:''' Muning&mdash;!
:'''Muning:''' Oh, it's you. Why are you still wandering on the upper levels of The Chasm?
:'''Muning:''' Um... Don't get me wrong. It's not that I don't welcome you here. I just wonder... Uh, don't you have other important matters to attend to?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph, we were just kindly dropping by to check up on you, since you looked so troubled...
:{{DIcon}} What happened?
:{{DIcon}} Is anything bothering you?
:'''Muning:''' *sigh*... Do you know about Archaic Stone?
:'''Muning:''' It's a rare ore &mdash; so rare that you won't even necessarily find one in the mines. I've only seen two or three such stones for all my years here at The Chasm. It's such a gorgeous gemstone with beauty beyond imagination.
:'''Muning:''' They say that if you look inside the finest Archaic Stones, you'll see shimmering light rays as thin as hair, and that the stones' color reminds you of the sea horizon in the twilight...
;(If the player does not have the [[Archaic Stone]] from [[Historia Antiqua Chapter]], Act II)
::'''Paimon:''' So what you're trying to say is that you are looking for some stones of beautiful colors?
::'''Muning:''' Not all stones of beautiful colors will do. It has to be THE stone.
::'''Muning:''' Speaking of which... How about this, {{Traveler}}? You help me look out for stones that fit my description.
::'''Muning:''' Bring them to me, and I will purchase them.
::'''Paimon:''' Huh? Paimon seriously doubts if your pocket is thick enough to afford this stone.
::'''Muning:''' Well... I've got a buyer behind me, so finances aren't exactly the problem.
::'''Paimon:''' A buyer?
::'''Muning:''' Yes. Somehow, the big shots at Huishan Hall got interested in the stone and wanted to analyze it, so they sent me to The Chasm to look for a few samples.
::'''Muning:''' But I'm busy getting my job over with... ahem... I mean, doing my job.
::'''Muning:''' How about we make a deal, {{Traveler}}? If you find any Archaic Stones, bring them to me. In exchange, the reward promised by Huishan Hall will be yours.
;(If the player has the [[Archaic Stone]] from [[Historia Antiqua Chapter]], Act II)
::{{DIcon}} Do you mean a stone like this?
::'''Muning:''' Ah, you... you actually have one! And it's of the highest quality that I've ever seen, too!
::'''Muning:''' {{Traveler}}, how about you sell this stone to me?
::{{DIcon}} No way.
::{{DIcon}} Dream on.
::'''Paimon:''' Yep! It's a gift from a friend...
::'''Paimon:''' Besides, Paimon seriously doubts if your pocket is thick enough to afford the hole this stone is gonna burn through.
::'''Muning:''' Well... I've got a buyer behind me, so finances aren't exactly the problem.
::'''Paimon:''' A buyer?
::'''Muning:''' Yes. Somehow, the big shots at Huishan Hall got interested in the stone and wanted to analyze it, so the sent me to The Chasm to look for a few samples.
::'''Muning:''' But I'm busy getting my job over with... ahem... I mean, doing my job.
::'''Muning:''' How about we make a deal, {{Traveler}}? If you find any Archaic Stones, bring them to me. In exchange, the reward promised by Huishan Hall will be yours.
::'''Muning:''' They don't have to match the quality of yours, as long as they are Archaic Stones.
:'''Paimon:''' Rewards from Huishan Hall!
:'''Muning:''' Normally, I would handle the job myself, but my hands have been tied by various affairs here in The Chasm lately, so please help me with this.
:'''Muning:''' *sigh*... That said, I'm not sure how many they want. How about you bring me three for starters?
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, alright, we got it.

;(Talk to Muning again without [[Archaic Stone]]){{Verify|Is it referring to the ones you need to obtain OR whether you don't have the one from Zhongli's SQ in the inventory?}}
:'''Muning:''' Have you found the Archaic Stones?
:{{DIcon}} Here they are.
:;(Opens Inventory)

;(Talk to Muning again)
:'''Muning:''' Have you found the Archaic Stones?
:{{DIcon}} Here they are.
:;(Submit {{item|Archaic Stone (Says He Who Seeks Stone)|text=Archaic Stone|x=3}})
:'''Muning:''' These are indeed Archaic Stones. You have my thanks.
:'''Muning:''' I was right to come to you. I bet it would've taken much longer if it'd been the Adventurers' Guild.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... who knows. Perhaps, the Adventurers' Guild might even...
:{{DIcon}} Send us the commission.
:'''Muning:''' That's quite likely.
:'''Muning:''' Adventurers... Hmm... I used to be envious of them. The way they ventured into high mountains and deep dungeons... There seemed to be nowhere they dared not go.
:'''Muning:''' I'm quite the opposite though&mdash; I've been working here for years but haven't once visited [[Cinnabar Cliff]] on the very top of The Chasm.
:'''Paimon:''' What? You haven't been there even once?
:'''Muning:''' Well, Cinnabar Cliff is one of those famous tourist spots that locals seldom go to.
:'''Muning:''' Maybe it's so close that I always think that I can visit it later when I've got time&mdash; but well, I've never "got time."
:'''Paimon:''' Then, why don't we go now?
:'''Paimon:''' It's important to act spontaneously.
:'''Muning:''' I think I'll pass. I'm still in the middle of something.
:'''Muning:''' What's more, such errand-running is best left to adventures.
:'''Muning:''' Dangerous places are their bread and butter, after all. I'd probably get injured if I did the same, and that's something I'd like to avoid.
:'''Paimon:''' Make sense. Getting injured could be a big deal.
:'''Muning:''' If I'm injured, no one's gonna supervise the exploration team down there and ensure the safety of the miners.
:'''Muning:''' Should anything happen, it will escalate into a grievous matter.
:'''Paimon:''' That's what you're worried about... Paimon thought you were just scared of getting injured!
:'''Muning:''' The formidably high cliffs near The Chasm, the bottomless caves... and the ancient battlefield left behind by [[Morax|Rex Lapis]] are all full of danger...
:'''Muning:''' I don't have the slightest interest in venturing into those places.
:'''Muning:''' Here, the rewards for the three Archaic Stones. Huishan Hall wants quite a lot of them, so bring me more if you can find any.
:'''Muning:''' Of course, there will be rewards for those, too. Just remember to come to me once you find more Archaic Stones.
:'''Paimon:''' You can count on us!
