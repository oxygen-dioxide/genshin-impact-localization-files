|text    = It's the Great Astrologist [[Mona]]'s birthday again! Do you want to come over to my place?

I'll say this in advance &mdash; you absolutely cannot complain about the state of my room. It is NOT because I don't clean up, okay? Everything I put out there are things I need to use on a daily basis.

If you're curious about what they do, I can explain it all to you in detail. But if you want to try them out, you need to pay close attention to my instructions because things can easily go wrong. Do you understand?

See you tonight then! I'm going to start preparing for dinner...
