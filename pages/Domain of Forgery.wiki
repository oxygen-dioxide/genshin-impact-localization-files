'''Domains of Forgery''' are [[Domains]] that award [[Weapon Ascension Materials]]. These materials can be used to ascend [[weapons]] to increase their stats and max level. They require {{Item|Original Resin|30|x=20}} to claim.

Players must reach [[Adventure Rank]] 16 or complete {{Quest|For a Tomorrow Without Tears}} to unlock the entrances to Domains of Blessing, although the Domains within may have higher Adventure Rank entry requirements.
