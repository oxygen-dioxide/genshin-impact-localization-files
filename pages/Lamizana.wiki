:'''Oberon''': Cooo, Croooo.

;(Talk to Lamizana and Lliwa after finishing ''[[From One Case to Another]]'')
:'''Lamizana:''' ...Does that mean you're willing to forgive me?
:'''Lliwa:''' Hah, I didn't say that. Taruka's my brother, and you got him caught up in that whole mess. On the off-chance something had happened to him...
:'''Lamizana:''' H&mdash;Hey, come on... He's alright, isn't he? And he's a bright kid, he should be able to turn things around no matter what kind of trouble he's facing! You should have more faith in him, too...
:'''Lliwa:''' Uh-huh. And who is it that's always saying that he's immature and unreliable, and...
:'''Lamizana:''' That was then, this is now! After all that, I see him in a whole new light. So, it be nice if you could re-evaluate your opinion of me, too...
