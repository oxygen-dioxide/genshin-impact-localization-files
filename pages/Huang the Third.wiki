==Profile==
Huang the Third can be found in the northern part of [[Yilong Wharf]] just south of the northern teleport waypoint prior to accepting the World Quest [[A Wangshan Walk to Remember]].

Huang the Third is a member of the [[Guhua Clan]]. However, as the clan has been in decline, the clan's training grounds and [[Wangshan Hall]] had been neglected. To help (barely) maintain the hall, Huang would look for people in Yilong Wharf to swindle of their Mora by giving them a tour of the grounds.

He eventually comes upon the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]], convincing them to join under the guise of treasure that would be theirs. However, they soon realize the truth after a brief tour of Wangshan Hall, and Paimon gets payback on him with a [[The Paimon Special|burnt, overly salted steak]] when he requests something to eat. They then threaten to report him to the [[Millelith]], but he begs them not to and gives them the [[Wangshan Hall Backup Key]] so they could claim the "treasure", which existed, but modern disciples could not find. He admits that they were honest compared to the others, and their willingness to humor him made him feel that the books in the hall would be better off with them before leaving.

Using the keys, the Traveler quickly discovers the true "treasure" of Wangshan Hall, having discovered a secret, hidden area that had been submerged in water.
