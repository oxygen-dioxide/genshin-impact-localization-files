==Personality==
{{Quote|A caged bird secluded within the confines of the Sanctuary of Surasthana who can only see the world in her dreams.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
When the Traveler and Paimon first meet Nahida in the Sabzeruz Festival samsara, she was an elusive and secretive individual. She voluntarily left ruling the city to the sages, though like in cases with the samsara, she would intervene as best she could if they stepped out of line. She also suffered from very low self-esteem as a result of the way the sages treated her. However after the downfall of the sages and the cleansing of Irminsul, many of these traits have minimized or vanished. She now openly wanders around the city, when she has time, and interacts with her people and has an overall far more genuinely cheerful view of herself.

Despite her previously difficult circumstances, when she spoke to people she rarely revealed her sadness. She almost always maintains a gentle and kind demeanour when she speaks to others, and treats everyone as equals. However, she admits that her social skills and understanding of human interaction needs work, and she's prone to slightly eccentric speech and behaviour as a result. She also professes a fondness for analogies and frequently makes use of them when attempting to explain things to others. Like many in Sumeru, she believes in helping people come to answers on their own, particularly regarding heavier truths, rather than providing all the answers. As a result she's also prone to peppering her speech with a mixture of analogies and subtle clues about things she wants others to learn.

As the God of Wisdom, Nahida's most notable traits are her exceptional intelligence, knowledge, and planning. She's capable of creating extremely thorough, multi-layered plans and can even be a little manipulative if the situation calls for it. She's also capable of making plans in a pinch, as shown when she bartered with Dottore. Perhaps most of all, Nahida is skilled at realizing when her intelligence is required and when her kindness is required, or both.

==Appearance==

Nahida uses the [[:Category:Short Female Characters|short female]] model. She has fair skin, pointed ears, large green eyes, and white hair with {{Dendro}}-green tips that glow when she uses her Elemental Skill or her Elemental Burst.

{{Quote|One might say she pays too much attention or dotes on people too much... But while her actions can be flawed, I believe her sense of responsibility as Sumeru's deity to be a commendable thing. Ah, that the youngest of gods should be thus, while a certain other person, by contrast, should be so prone to hysterics...|Chief Justice [[Neuvillette]] of [[Fontaine]]}}
Lesser Lord Kusanali dwelt deep in the [[Sanctuary of Surasthana]]. She had never really been in the limelight, nor had she even been mentioned much.

Always learning something new, she constantly strove to become a worthy archon who could guide her people as soon as possible.

If the threat of forbidden knowledge were not pressing so near, would she not desire to take a short break and see Sumeru and those who live in it with her own eyes?

As things stood, she could only see the myriad, vibrant sights the world had to offer in dreams.

Within the meditative silence of her soul, she made companions of the sunlight and the breeze, struck up friendships with humans and animals, told stories, played, and sang songs she had only just learned...

She poured the loveliest of yearnings into her dreamscape, but no matter how bustling the nights, when day came, all things about her would return to silence once more.

She gradually arose. Even through her sleepiness, solitude struck like an icy tide, causing her to hug her shoulders tightly.

—That which fully awakened her was an inconspicuous yet abnormal noise that sounded within [[Akasha]].

"Ah. So it was a dream within a dream..."

==Character Stories==
Several of Nahida's Character Stories change after completing the [[Archon Quest]] ''[[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]]''. See the [[#Altered Character Stories|Altered Character Stories]] section for the alternate versions.

{{Character Story

              --><p>On the other hand, Lesser Lord Kusanali, who was whisked back by the sages to the Sanctuary of Surasthana following the former's fall, has been more of a symbol &mdash; one that signifies that the protection of divinity never ceased to exist on this land.</p><!--
              --><p>But the answers to who she is, how she descended, and what powers she has, are rarely known.</p><!--
              --><p>From the highest sage's vague response and evasive attitude toward people's inquiry about Lesser Lord Kusanali, the people in Sumeru deduced that they should no longer expect merciful wisdom to descend from on high as before.</p><!--
              --><p>The Akasha, the sublime legacy left by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, is just as handy and helpful as it has always been. What people are not aware of is that the Akasha today has become the ears and eyes of the newborn deity.</p><!--
              --><p>Through the Akasha, she has observed every bit of human emotions and attitudes. She is aware of their devotion to the old goddess, their disillusionment with their new deity, and the many comments that "The God of Wisdom will never come back."</p><!--
              --><p>She knows in her heart that she must keep learning and grow up as quickly as she can to stand up and face the threats from the most abysmal corners of the world. This is her inevitable duty.</p><!--
              --><p>Thus, whether she is misunderstood or underappreciated, Nahida makes no argument against it.</p>

|text2         = <p>The process of learning and growth is joyful, and knowledge concerning this world always satisfies Nahida's exuberant curiosity.</p><!--
              --><p>Gradually, Nahida came to grasp the principles of nature and the elements, understanding the ecology of the sky and the sea. She could even compose what she learned into fascinating dreams that are logical, yet beyond imagination.</p><!--
              --><p>Such dreams are, in essence, the same as Nahida's marvelous metaphors &mdash; they all lead to a dawning understanding of the similarities between two otherwise unrelated things.</p><!--
              --><p>But there are times when she meditates on things yet struggles to figure them out, and such incidents usually concern events related to people or society.</p><!--
              --><p>For example, when honesty and truth could exempt a person from punishment, some people might turn silent and deceitful; and when with their beloved ones, some people would hurt others with brutal words.</p><!--
              --><p>It feels as if the contradictions of the entire world are focused through and manifested by human beings, whose fickle emotions are perplexing to Nahida.</p><!--
              --><p>In such moments, her metaphors would not work. Nor could she find any system in this world as a reference for such chaos.</p><!--
              --><p>She could only explain it by the fact that the difference between every person's uniqueness creates diverse reactions when they undergo similar emotions.</p><!--
              --><p>But this was not a satisfactory answer to Nahida. To better know human beings, plain knowledge and dogma alone would never suffice.</p><!--
              --><p>Perhaps it was from that moment on that Nahida came to understand why "she" had to stand firmly by human beings' side and even made tremendous sacrifices for their sake.</p><!--
              --><p>For each and every one of "them" is a unique existence in this world.</p>

              --><p>The knowledge she learns through the Akasha during the day is presented vividly in her dreams at night. As she learns more knowledge, her dreams become even more intricate and full of life.</p><!--
              --><p>The dreams not only relax her mind, but also give her chances to examine her new knowledge to see if it goes against common sense or if she is missing any details.</p><!--
              --><p>When Dusk Birds first appeared in Nahida's dream, those birds soared through the sky in a standing posture with their wings folded.</p><!--
              --><p>It looked abnormal and caught Nahida's attention immediately. Nahida thus learned how wings worked, after which the Dusk Birds could fly freely in her dreams.</p><!--
              --><p>Next, she adopted similar methods to fix [[Shroomboar]]s that slept underwater, Radishes that grew on apple trees, and [[crystalfly|crystalflies]] with mismatched wing colors.</p><!--
              --><p>Knowledge shall not be a mere approach to justify things in this world, it could also be used to satisfy her need for pure innocent fun.</p><!--
              --><p>Technically, Shroomboars can only walk on the ground. Now that she understood how wings work, wouldn't Shroomboars with wings fly all the same?</p><!--
              --><p>And where there are flying Shroomboars, it is only natural to have crocodiles that walk on their hind legs and [[Harra Fruit]]s who speak human languages...</p><!--
              --><p>The way Nahida develops her knowledge system has subsequently created a little amusement park for her, free of disturbance. In her dreams, she is in the embrace of boundless happiness.</p>

              --><p>Hatred and frustration are thus melted away by the warmth in their hearts, and the children would gain an opportunity to make a change in their lives such that they can grow in confidence and gladness.</p><!--
              --><p>However, none of them could recognize to whom the gentle, warm voice belonged. Everyone knows, after all, that Greater Lord Rukkhadevata had departed a long time ago.</p><!--

              --><p>The sense of achievement from finishing making toys brought Nahida brief satisfaction, but she soon found this out:</p><!--
              --><p>She could not find an opponent for any battle-type games, and as the maker, she knew the solutions to all her puzzle games.</p><!--

===Etymology===
*"Nahida" is likely based on {{lang|Nahid|fa=ناهید|fa_rm=Nâhid}}, a Middle Persian variant spelling of {{w|Anahita}}, a Zoroastrian goddess. Anahita is the goddess of "the Waters" ({{w|Aban}}) and is associated with fertility, healing, and wisdom.
**In-game, both "Anahitian" and "Nahidad" are terms affiliated with the Dendro Archon(s), although the terms have only been used generically and have not been ascribed to refer to a specific Dendro Archon.
***[[Anahitian Blessing]] is described as the Dendro Archon's blessing.
***In [[Zandik's Legacy#Sohreh's Note|Sohreh's Note]], the eponymous [[Sohreh]] decides to name a new species of micro-scarab "Nahidad Scarabs," and proceeds to explain that the name means "The Dendro Archon's Boon."
*"Nahida" is also the name used for a {{w|Nahida|genus of butterflies}}.
