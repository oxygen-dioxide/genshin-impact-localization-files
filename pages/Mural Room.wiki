{{Location Intro|The '''Mural Room''' ''(unofficial name)''|description=<p>{{If Self|Mural Room|It|The Mural Room}} contains three large frescoes painted by the [[Princess of Sal Vindagnyr]], two of which are identical. It is locked behind a sealed door near the [[Entombed City - Ancient Palace]], which can be opened by completing the [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] "[[Dragonspine's Glacial Secret]]".</p>}}

==Overview==
The Mural Room is known for its namesake: two distinct murals which are related to the establishment and prosperity of the once-flourishing nation of [[Sal Vindagnyr]]. The [[Snow-Tombed Starsilver]], a [[claymore]] once wielded by the hero [[Imunlaukr]], can also be found stuck on the platform in the middle of the room.

Mural 1 can be divided into two halves:
*The right half depicts a large green mountain (likely Vindagnyr, the ancient name for the mountain of Dragonspine) with a crowned figure standing to the right of it, pointing up towards the sky. Above the mountain is a floating island, likely [[Celestia]], with the sun behind it and with clouds or wind surrounding it.
**To the right of Celestia are words written in the [[Latin Language]]. Reading from top to bottom, right to left, it reads ''Audi tace sei voltis vos discite'' (roughly "Listen and be silent, if you wish to learn")
*The left half depicts one large figure (the "angel") to the far left, with its hand outstretched and a shining symbol above its hand. Two smaller crowned figures stand to the right side, facing the angel with their arms outstretched, while three small, nondescript figures stand between the angel and the crowned figures, also facing the angel with their arms outstretched.
**Between the left and right halves of the mural are the words ''Fidelis angeli iuvant'' ("The angels help the faithful"), again written in the Latin Language.

Mural 2 depicts three green mountains, with the centermost mountain being the tallest and largest, as well as two uncolored mountains to either side of the three. The mountains are surrounded by imagery of wind. A structure, possibly a castle, sits on top of the centermost mountain, while a circle with a smaller golden circle in the middle is depicted above the structure.

The princess intended for the third mural to depict the thawing of the snow and ice on Dragonspine, but could not complete it, as she had forgotten what the blue sky and green grass looked like.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Princess' Box}}</ref> She also promised [[Imunlaukr]] that she would paint a fourth mural featuring his likeness, but perished before she could do so.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Snow-Tombed Starsilver}}</ref>
