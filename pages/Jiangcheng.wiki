{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Jiangcheng:''' *sigh* I haven't been out in the fields for a while now. I wonder how the harvest is going...
:'''Jiangcheng:''' Wife... Wife?
:{{DIcon}} Errr, hello?
::'''Jiangcheng:''' Ah, wife, you're here.
::'''Jiangcheng:''' You were just on my mind... You've been saying that our daughter is of marriageable age now, have you not?

:::'''Jiangcheng:''' If it was not so stormy that night... If I had come an hour earlier...
:::'''Jiangcheng:''' Then our daughter... and you, wife, we would be...
:{{DIcon}} ...Um, bye.
::'''Jiangcheng:''' Ah, sure. Wife... don't forget to look after our land...
