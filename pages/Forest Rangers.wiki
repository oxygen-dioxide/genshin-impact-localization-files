The '''Forest Rangers''', also known as '''Vanara''',<ref group="Note">In some languages of the {{Quest|For a Dream I Tarry}}, "Vanara" had associated {{w|ruby character}}s that explain the term as the synonym of the Forest Rangers.</ref> are a group of civil servants who protect the forests of Sumeru. The higher-ranking members are called '''Forest Watchers''', and wear lighter green-colored clothes compared to lower-ranked members. They are most active in [[Avidya Forest]], where their main outpost, [[Gandharva Ville]], is located.

They are responsible for helping travelers in need as well as preserving the ecosystem of Sumeru's rainforests, for example by suppressing [[Withering Zone]]s and monitoring beast populations. They also send regular reports about the state of Avidya Forest to the researchers of [[Pardis Dhyai]], who in turn provide them with various ecological support, such as seeds and nutrients.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Izad}}</ref>

==History==
Not much is known about the Forest Rangers' origins. According to [[Rana]], the earliest forest rangers were the forest king [[Viaghara]]'s royal guards.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Into the Woods}}</ref>
