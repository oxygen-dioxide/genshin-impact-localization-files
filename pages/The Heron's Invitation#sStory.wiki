:'''Customer:''' We can't talk about the art of the sword without bringing up Kamisato Art Tachi Jutsu!
:'''Customer:''' From what I've heard, Miss Kamisato Ayaka is skilled with both the pen and the sword!
----
:'''Customer:''' Sigh, my son sure know how to keep his old man worrying!
:'''Customer:''' When he was just starting to practice swordsmanship, he would do it half-heatedly and slack off. He didn't pay attention to his training at all!
:'''Customer:''' I would often tell him stories about how Miss Kamisato honed her skills in Tachi Jutsu. As long as you persevere and work hard, you can accomplish it even if you know nothing at the beginning!

:'''Customer:''' I heard the festival is taking place soon.
:'''Customer:''' I really hope I can meet Miss Kamisato this time. It's a same that Miss Kamisato usually only attends festivals for business matters like management and patrol. It seems like a tough job...
:'''Customer:''' I just hope that one day, she can join in on the fun at the festival.
----
:'''Customer:''' This tea set... Hmm, I still feel as though something is missing...
:'''Customer:''' I was lucky enough to have met Miss Kamisato Ayaka and chatted with her about things relating to tea ceremonies.
:'''Customer:''' As expected from the Shirasagi Himegimi, she has mastered the tea ceremony practices and is an eloquent conversationalist.
:'''Customer:''' I learned a lot from just chatting with her. So this time around, I must buy a better tea set based on what Miss Kamisato has taught me.

:'''Customer:''' Hmmm, this looks like the clothing store that Miss Kamisato patronizes!
:'''Customer:''' So, I come here often to see what new clothes they have.
:'''Customer:''' But, even in the same clothes as her, it's hard for ordinary people to match Miss Kamisato's beauty, hehe...
----
:'''Customer:''' I wonder if this shop can make something with a heron pattern...
:'''Customer:''' Yes, as in the symbol of Shirasagi Himegimi.
:'''Customer:''' My daughter really admires Miss Kamisato Ayaka and always wanted an outfit with a heron pattern. I want to get her one for her birthday.

:'''Customer:''' I should ask the owner what Miss Kamisato ordered!
----
:'''Customer:''' Are you here for a meal too?
:'''Customer:''' It's your lucky day, you have to try the Tuna Sushi!
:'''Customer:''' The tuna here used to be always out of stock because of the supply route.
:'''Customer:''' Later, Miss Kamisato heard about this issue and quickly helped to resolve it!
:'''Customer:''' Any dish that the Shirasagi Himegimi likes must be delicious!
