==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Baret:''' Ugh... I really screwed up...
:{{DIcon}} Oh? How so?
::'''Baret:''' Before I set off for Natlan, I was warned that the nation has a hot climate, and I should dress light.
::'''Baret:''' But who'd have thought it would be so hot over here at the People of the Springs that even my lightest dress is still not enough?
::{{DIcon}} Not going to buy new ones?
::'''Baret:''' Of course I'll get them! And I'll get as many as I want.
::'''Baret:''' I've already commissioned a swimsuit in the latest style, and I've bought some limited edition designer skateboards as well.
::'''Baret:''' Given it's tailored, though, the swimsuit will take some time to make, so I've got to wait a while. It's fine, though &mdash; chilling here and listening to music isn't a bad way to pass the time.
::'''Baret:''' Everything here from the people to the music are so laid-back and carefree. I think this suits me better than mainstream rock music.
:{{DIcon}} I wish you luck.
::'''Baret:''' Huh? Oh, it's fine. I've already pretty much solved the problem.
