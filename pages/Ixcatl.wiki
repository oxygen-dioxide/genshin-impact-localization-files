{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ixcatl:''' Ahh, I couldn't stop it! I let it get away! I knew I should have trained harder... Next time the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]] comes around, I'll have to do better than this!
:{{DIcon}} Get away?
::'''Ixcatl:''' That's right. I was on my way to train when I ran into a rampaging Tatankasaurus. I tried my best to stop it...
::'''Ixcatl:''' But take a look &mdash; it smashed right into this fence. In the end, it ran off up the mountain... I can see I need to train more!
:{{DIcon}} The Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame?
::'''Ixcatl:''' Huh? Are you a visitor from afar?
::'''Ixcatl:''' The Pilgrimage is a competition that represents the highest honor to us Natlanese. Only the mightiest warriors stand a chance of attaining ultimate victory!
::'''Ixcatl:''' Haha, I'm a little embarrassed to say this, but I didn't expect to be matched against Coach [[Iansan]] when I signed up.
::'''Ixcatl:''' Even [[Varesa]], the strongest wrestler on our team, was trounced by her &mdash; but that's Coach "Power" Iansan for you.
::'''Ixcatl:''' Still, I'm determined to train as hard as I can! That way, I won't lose to anyone &mdash; except the Coach, anyway!
:{{DIcon}} You've got this.
::'''Ixcatl:''' Thanks for the encouragement, friend! I hope your journey brings you nothing but victory!

===Dialogue Set #2===
Available after {{Cx}}<!-- probably after completing Incandescent Ode of Resurrection -->
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ixcatl:''' Ahh, I couldn't stop it! I let it get away! I knew I should have trained harder... I must do better than this the next time I encounter [[Abyss]]al creatures!
:{{DIcon}} Get away?
::'''Ixcatl:''' That's right. I was on my way to train when I ran into [[Pisasa|a rampaging Tatankasaurus]]. I tried my best to stop it...
::'''Ixcatl:''' But take a look &mdash; it smashed right into this fence. In the end, it ran off up the mountain... I can see I need to train more!
:{{DIcon}} About the battles that happened previously...
::'''Ixcatl:''' The Collective of Plenty wasn't the main focus of the Abyss's attacks this time and we made it through the battle relatively unscathed.
::'''Ixcatl:''' Nevertheless... Some of our warriors were still embraced by the peace of [[Night Kingdom|eternal night]].
::'''Ixcatl:''' They defended their glory with strength and safeguarded the freedom of others. That is the greatest ending for any warrior.
:{{DIcon}} Good luck.
::'''Ixcatl:''' Thanks for the encouragement, friend! I hope your journey brings you nothing but victory!
