The '''Four Shades''' are four [[god]]s who serve directly as envoys or emissaries under the [[Heavenly Principles]]. They were created by the Heavenly Principles after it descended to [[Teyvat]] and battled against the [[Seven Sovereigns]].<ref name="before sun and moon">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2|Before Sun and Moon}}</ref>

==Overview==
Though little is known about them, they are implied to be more powerful than the [[Seven Archons]], with Istaroth named as a "higher power" compared to the [[Makoto|late Electro Archon]].<ref name="RS">{{Ref/Quest|Radiant Sakura}}</ref> According to [[Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night]], the Shades do not like to be mentioned by name by any living being, even including by The Seven, and instead prefer to remain in the shadows as Shades.<ref name="BeneathTheSecretSource" />

===Istaroth===
{{Main|Istaroth}}
Istaroth is the Ruler of Time,<ref name="before sun and moon" /> also known by myriad names including the "thousand winds" and "Kairos." She was worshiped in [[Mondstadt]] alongside [[Barbatos]],<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Time and Wind}}</ref> and in [[Enkanomiya]]<ref name="before sun and moon" /> before the state religion of the [[Sunchildren]] was imposed. Time and Wind are known to be deeply connected, with variations of a similar saying arising in Mondstadt, "seeds of stories, brought by the wind and cultivated by time." Both are hinted to be connected to [[erosion]] in the description of [[Sacrificial Fragments]]. In the present day, Istaroth has been forgotten to have ever been a deity of Mondstadt.

When [[Enkanomiya]] fell into the depths of the ocean, [[Istaroth]] responded to the people's pleas for help. However, the Heavenly Principles and the other three Shades were unable to hear them.<ref name="before sun and moon" />

Istaroth was likely involved in Raiden Makoto's plan to create the [[Sacred Sakura]], which involved creating a stable time loop that planted the Sacred Sakura in the past while inside Makoto's [[realm of consciousness]], a place where "time was moving forward and backward at the same time."<ref name="RS" />

===Ronova===
{{Main|Ronova}}
Ronova is the Ruler of Death.<ref name="BeneathTheSecretSource" /> She helped [[Natlan]] establish its rules and gave guidance to the Lord of the Night, in creating the [[Night Kingdom]] out of an expression of love and act of reparation. However, these actions were considered to be overstepping her authority as a Shade and displeased the Heavenly Principles.<ref name="BeneathTheSecretSource" />

===Unnamed Shade===
One unnamed Shade had the duty to create life<ref name="Water Wings" /> and was responsible for helping the Heavenly Principles create animals, plants, and humans.<ref name="before sun and moon" /> She is described as the envoy of [[Celestia]].<ref name="Water Wings" /> Following the deposition of the [[Primordial Sea]]'s first heart, the [[Hydro Dragon]], she created [[Egeria]] to function as the Primordial Sea's new heart.<ref name="Water Wings" /></noinclude>

==Trivia==
* The Heavenly Principles and its Shades' attributes have been speculated to align with the five [[Artifact]] types: [[Flower of Life|life]] (the unnamed Shade), [[Plume of Death|death]] (Ronova), [[Sands of Eon|time]] (Istaroth), [[Goblet of Eonothem|void]],<ref group="Note">Based on the original Chinese name for Goblet of Eonothem, which is {{Zh|空之杯|tl=Cup of Emptiness.}}</ref> and [[Circlet of Logos|reason]].<ref group="Note">Based on the original Chinese name for Circlet of Logos, which is {{Zh|理之冠|tl=Crown of Reason.}}</ref>
** The [[unknown god]] has been theorized to be one of the four Shades, specifically the Ruler of Void ''(unofficial name)'', based on her self-introduction as the "sustainer of [[Heavenly Principles|heavenly principles]]" and her resemblance to the [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Herrscher of the Void|Herrscher of the Void]] from ''{{w|Honkai Impact 3rd}}'', another [[HoYoverse]] game.
