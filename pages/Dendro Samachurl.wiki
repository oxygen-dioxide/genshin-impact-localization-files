{{Description|A wizened, mumbling hilichurl, one that awakens the might of Dendro.<br />Hilichurls especially gifted in commanding the elements who often reach the zenith of their skill in their twilight years. A grudge stirs beneath that mask, and poison ivy sprouts as hateful whispers issue forth from it.|[[Archive]]}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Thorny Vines:''' Summons three thorny vines on the battlefield, blocking off a wide area and dealing extremely minor {{Color|Physical DMG}} to players that come in contact. The vines can be destroyed using {{Pyro}}.
*'''Dendro Field:''' Summons a green field around the player that applies the {{Dendro}} status to any player or enemy within it, but does not deal DMG.
*'''Smack:''' If the player is within melee range, swings its staff at the player, dealing '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} and knocking the player back. The Samachurl also falls in the process due to the staff's weight.
