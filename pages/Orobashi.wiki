As a result, most NPCs use {{Lang|"Orobaxi"|zh=奥罗巴斯|zh_rm=Àoluóbāsī}}, which is a Chinese phonetic spelling for the Japanese ''Orobashi'' reading. Because most other localizations translate {{Lang|mini=1|zh=远吕羽氏}} as ''Orobashi'', the reason for a phonetic spelling is lost; the Japanese localization does not even bother distinguishing the two names and translate them both as {{Lang|mini=1|ja=オロバシ}}.</ref> also referred to as the {{Lang|'''Watatsumi Omikami'''|ja=海祇大御神|ja_tl=(Great) God of the Oceans}},<ref name="Jade Coral" /> was an ancient dragon-like serpent [[god]] that was defeated by [[Ei]] at [[Yashiori Island]]. The [[Musoujin Gorge]] is the scar left by the god when she delivered a blow from her [[Musou no Hitotachi]], slaying the serpent.

The remnants of Orobashi can be seen throughout both [[Inazuma]] and [[Enkanomiya]], with its skull located at [[Serpent's Head]]. Its lingering power has resulted in the [[Tatarigami]], a phenomenon on the island that causes natural disasters and can drive people on the island mad.

The residents of [[Watatsumi Island]] and their leaders, the [[Sangonomiya Clan]], worship Orobashi, as it taught them how to farm and smelt after discovering them in the [[Dark Sea]]<ref name="Jade Coral" /> (referring to [[Enkanomiya]]). Therefore, the people of Watatsumi Island are very grateful towards Orobashi and worship it as their guardian deity.<ref name="Miyazaki Saburou">{{Ref/NPC|Miyazaki Saburou}}</ref>

==Appearance==
According to legends, Orobashi has a fluorescent body covered in myriad-colored coral.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Coral Branch of a Distant Sea}}</ref>

==Story==
===Early Archon War===
Orobashi was born some time before or during the [[Archon War]]. Unable to defeat either the "golden god" (possibly [[Morax]]) or [[Ei]] (representing the Raiden Shogun), and tired of "being shamed for blasphemy",<ref name="Oathsworn Eye">{{Ref/Weapon|Oathsworn Eye}}</ref> Orobashi fled from [[Teyvat]]<ref name="Prelim Study">{{Ref/Book|A Preliminary Study of Sangonomiya Folk Belief}}</ref><ref name="Serpent-Drakes">{{Ref/Book|The Serpent and Drakes of Tokoyokoku}}</ref> and eventually ended up beyond the seal that separated [[Enkanomiya]] from Teyvat.<ref name="Before Sun and Moon">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2|Before Sun and Moon}}</ref>

===In Enkanomiya===
Orobashi remained confined in a cavern for untold ages, until a child of Enkanomiya who was exploring beyond the region's three corners discovered it. The child asked it to become their god, and Orobashi agreed. Thus was the rule of the [[Sunchildren]] and their corrupt puppeteers ended, and the Bathysmal Vishaps became an even more reduced threat.<ref name="Oathsworn Eye" /><ref name="Prelim Study" /><ref name="Serpent-Drakes" /> The ancient people of Enkanomiya co-worshipped Orobashi, the coral serpent, with Ouroboros, the scaleless imaginary serpent.<ref name="Hydro Studies">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|3|Hydrological Studies in Byakuyakoku}}</ref> Its influence led to the end of the worship of the Dainichi Mikoshi and many of the corrupt practices established by the Sunchildren regime.

Orobashi brought with its newfound rule drastic changes to Enkanomiya society, including changing from the ancient Watatsumi language to the Narukami-style language.<ref name="Bath Vish Records">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|4|Bathysmal Vishap Experimental Records}}</ref> Following a certain prophecy, it prepared the people of Enkanomiya to return to the surface world and had them become acclimated with Narukami and Inazuman conventions.

However, in taking in these forgotten people and learning of their history, Orobashi came upon the book ''[[Before Sun and Moon]]'', which recorded a history of the world that [[Celestia]] wanted concealed: One that recorded the existence of an "old world" and the [[Seven Sovereigns]], the Sovereigns' defeat and the creation of a new world at the hands of the [[Primordial One]] and its four shining shades, and the war against the [[Second Who Came]] during which Enkanomiya sank into the depths of the ocean.<ref name="Before Sun and Moon" /> For this knowledge, both Orobashi and Watatsumi as a whole were found guilty of four counts of profanity and eight counts of deceiving living souls. Orobashi was allowed to take all of their transgressions on itself and sacrifice itself so its people would be spared and taken under the rule of Celestia once again.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent}}</ref>

At some point in time, presumably after reading ''Before Sun and Moon'', Orobashi personally led experiments on the [[Dragonheir of the Depths|Dragonheirs of the Depths]] to better understand their abilities as well as prevent the return of the Dragon of Water, one of the Seven Sovereigns.<ref name="Bath Vish Records" />

===Return to Teyvat and Death===
Under the guise of guiding its people back to the surface, Orobashi broke off the coral that grew from his body &mdash; a manifestation of its power &mdash; to create [[Watatsumi Island]] so the people of Enkanomiya had a new home.<ref name="Sangonomiya Chronicles">{{Ref/Book|Sangonomiya Chronicles}}</ref> There, Orobashi taught them how to farm and smelt, for which they were deeply grateful and worshipped it.<ref name="Miyazaki Saburou"/> It lived among its people for some time before finally going to its death towards the end of the Archon War 2,000 years ago.<ref>{{Ref/VP|Rift Valley, Yashiori Island}}</ref>

By that point, the Inazuma archipelagos were united under [[Makoto]]'s rule, with her twin sister [[Ei]] acting as her kagemusha (body double). All those who dwelt within Inazuma were content with their lot and did not seek to take what was not theirs, lest they be eradicated by the Raiden Shogun.<ref name="Sangonomiya Chronicles" /> When the [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual]] was developed, those performing the ritual were to beg forgiveness from both the Narukami and the Watatsumi shrines before beginning the ritual,<ref>{{Ref/Book|Sacred Sakura Cleansing Summary}}</ref> suggesting that Orobashi may have been worshipped by people from other islands for a time.

By the time of Orobashi's death, Watatsumi Island was already plagued with woes unrelated to their knowledge of forbidden history: the island was ill-suited for growing crops due to its geological structure, leading to starvation and disease. The Watatsumi people pleaded to conquer the more resource-rich [[Yashiori Island]] to make up for their own deficiencies, but Orobashi refused time and time again, knowing that the Raiden Shogun had slain the opposing gods in Inazuma over the course of the Archon War. However, between the cries of his people and the decree from Celestia, Orobashi was left with no other choice.<ref name="Prelim Study" />

Orobashi built up a navy, led by the shrine maiden [[Mouun]] and her twin sister [[Ayame]], and invaded Yashiori Island. They succeeded in conquering it, and Mouun's disciple Touzannou (later known as [[Akuou]]) was named the vassal ruler of the island.<ref name="Life of Mouun">{{Ref/Book|The Life of Mouun the Shrine Maiden}}</ref> After hearing word of the attack, Ei gathered her troops and waged a brutal war against Watatsumi. The war caused great suffering and many casualties on both sides, among them Ei's lieutenant [[Sasayuri]].<ref name="Sangonomiya Chronicles" />

Towards the end of the war, Orobashi was slain by Ei using her signature [[Musou no Hitotachi]] swordsmanship, dying with his gaze fixed upon the heavens. The killing blow created a great rift known as [[Musoujin Gorge]] that split the island in two, while Orobashi's remains still rest throughout the island.<ref>Official Genshin Impact Website, Inazuma Travel Highlights: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Musoujin Gorge]</ref> Touzannou was also slain by this slash,<ref>{{Ref/Book|Debates on the "Viceroy of the East"}}</ref> while Mouun was ambushed and slain by Sasayuri's troops as she attempted a retreat. Ayame went missing in action, with no consensus as to her ultimate fate.<ref name="Life of Mouun" />

===Legacy===
With Orobashi's death, its lingering power became the [[Tatarigami]], which the Shogunate later utilized to create the [[Mikage Furnace]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Tatara Tales (Quest)}}</ref> The main shrine on Watatsumi Island was subsequently abandoned, with a new shrine being built elsewhere, and the Divine Priestess took leadership over the island. While the true reason for Orobashi's death was to be kept secret, rumors that Celestia ordered it to go to its death still exist. However, the most commonly accepted theory is that Orobashi attacked Yashiori Island for its resources.<ref name="Prelim Study" />

According to [[Sangonomiya Chronicles]], a text written by Shogunate historian [[Kujou Michizane]], the people of Sangonomiya have recognized the Inazuma Shogunate as the rightful ruler following the death of the Great Serpent. However, while recognizing the Raiden Shogun's authority, the Sangonomiya have continued to worship Orobashi instead of the Raiden Shogun despite its death at her hands.<ref>Official Genshin Impact Website, Inazuma Travel Highlights: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Kujou Encampment]<br />''There will always be an irreconcilable conflict between the people of Narukami who believe in the Raiden Shogun and the people of Sangonomiya who believe in Watatsumi Omikami. The strife between both parties has only worsened since the Vision Hunt Decree was enforced.''</ref> According to [[the Shogun]], the people of Watatsumi were allowed to continue worshipping Orobashi so that it may continue receiving their prayers.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Raiden Shogun|About Sangonomiya Kokomi}}</ref>

When the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] was enacted, the [[Sangonomiya Clan]] declared war on the [[Inazuma Shogunate]], leading to mass skirmishes between the [[Watatsumi Army]] and the [[Tenryou Commission]]. While the Decree was the main motivator for the war, the preexisting tensions between the Shogunate and Watatsumi Island affected the actions of several members of the Watatsumi Army during the war. A radical faction within the resistance, at [[Nathan]]'s suggestion, sought to revive Orobashi by destroying the [[Narukami Pillar]]s on Yashiori Island.<ref>Interactable: [[Serpent's Head#Waterlogged Note|Waterlogged Note]]</ref> Unbeknownst to them, Nathan was a [[Fatui]] mole sent to sabotage the war effort by releasing the Tatarigami and hindering the resistance's chances at a quick victory.

Following the revelation of the Fatui conspiracy and the end of the [[Vision Hunt Decree]], most of the Fatui withdrew from the island, save for a few who wished to get payback for [[Signora]]'s death. Nonetheless, some Watatsumi residents find it hard to accept peace with the Shogunate, believing that doing so would mean that Orobashi's sacrifice was in vain.

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* Following the theme of gods in Genshin Impact being named after demons in the Ars Goetia, Orobashi may be named after the demon {{w|Orobas}}, one of the Great Princes of Hell.
** The Chinese version of Orobaxi, {{Lang|mini=1|zh=奥罗巴斯|zh_rm=Àoluóbāsī}}, can be read as Orobas, although most Chinese translations of the demon name use {{Lang|mini=1|zh=歐若博司|zh_rm=Ōuruòbósī}}.
** {{Lang|Orobashi|ja=オロバシ}}, is slightly different from Orobas' Japanese name, {{Lang|mini=1|ja=オロバス|ja_rm=Orobasu}}.
* Orobashi may also be modeled after {{w|Yamata no Orochi|Orochi}}, a legendary dragon/serpent in Japanese mythology who was slain by the storm god {{w|Susanoo-no-Mikoto|Susanoo}}.
* In the Japanese localization, the name "Orobashi no Mikoto" is written in {{w|katakana}} (phonetically) rather than {{w|kanji}}, a convention that is typically used for gods or foreign names.
** It is likely that {{Lang|"no Mikoto"|ja=ノミコト}} would be {{Lang|mini=1|ja=の{{wt|命||Noun 3}}}}, a title following a noun that is used for gods, emperors, and other high-ranking persons. It translates into English as "the honorable" or "the exalted."
