<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
Taj is a member of the [[Matra]] and had a single son, [[Murtada Radkani]]. They had a brief argument but were able to reconcile, before Murtada was enticed by someone to investigate the [[Court of Desolation]], which had been banned by the Akademiya due to the dangers tied to it. Taj arrested Murtada and threw him in jail, although he committed suicide shortly after arriving in prison, much to Taj's sorrow.

Taj worked with his junior partner, [[Cyno]], and taught him many things including polearm training, but retired from partaking in live missions due to personal reasons a year prior to the events of the quest, and instead relegated himself to administrative duties. When he learned that the organization that had killed his son had been researching the Court of Desolation, Taj investigated them and learned that they had many famous members in their ranks, including the Akademiya. He was approached by the organization himself, which attempted to lure him to their side by dangling the legend that the Court of Desolation could bring the dead back to life; he was momentarily tempted but stuck to his values. He instead pretended to have fallen from grace and worked with them while leaving behind a trail for Cyno to follow, although the [[Traveler]] would be the one to find it. Fortunately, the Traveler ran into Cyno, who was likewise investigating a surplus of smuggled Canned Knowledge which was an unintended result of Taj's actions.

He eventually found the Court of Desolation and began damaging its walls to allow quicksand to bury it, knowing that the organization could not be allowed to continue using it for its own gains. By the time the Traveler and Cyno learned that Taj was responsible for the leaks in the Akademiya, he had been waiting for their arrival. After a brief fight, Cyno realized that Taj had not gone astray, which he confirmed. Cyno also could sense that most of Taj's life force was gone, proving that opening the Court of Desolation costing the user's life was true. Hoping to see his son in the afterlife and needing to atone for the leaks, Taj explained everything and then bid his old partner farewell before willingly letting himself be buried by quicksand.

Over the next four days, Cyno would clear Taj's name, with the announcement of his sacrifice shocking his fellow Matra, who were riled up and arrested the traitors in the Akademiya from amongst the some 300 names on the list Taj complied. Some would escape the initial arrests, but they would all be caught by Cyno. While the Matra wanted to erect a memorial at the place where he died, Cyno did not reveal the location due to the circumstances involved.
