==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nantuck:''' A great black whale in the open seas... Yes, this will surely be a bestseller!
:{{DIcon|Fishing Supplies}} I'd like to buy some fishing supplies.
:;(After completing [[Exploding Population]])
::'''Nantuck:''' Well, I've got some of the Association's stock right here. Have a look and see if any of them meet your needs.
:;(Opens the [[Mondstadt Fishing Association]] shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Nantuck:''' My name is Nantuck, one of the people in charge of the [[Mondstadt Fishing Association]].
::'''Nantuck:''' Huh, from the looks of you, you appear to have recognized me for my other role. Ah, so this is the frightening power of fame, eh?
::'''Nantuck:''' Well then, there's no point pretending. That's right! The famed sea-life author Nantuck &mdash; that's me!
::'''Nantuck:''' ...Eh? You've never read anything I've ever written? Well, that's because I haven't published anything yet. But fret not! A great work by yours truly will soon sweep across the literary markets, that much I can guarantee.
::'''Nantuck:''' And if you'd like, I'd happily put you first in line when my first signing session comes up.
:{{DIcon}} What do you mean by "a giant black whale"?
::'''Nantuck:''' Shh! Softer, please! This is my magnum opus in progress we're talking about here!
::'''Nantuck:''' Well, since you seem interested, allow me to give you a sneak peek.
::'''Nantuck:''' Imagine this: an epic tale on the high seas, with a heroic fisherman pursuing a giant black whale! This'll be a bestseller for sure!
::'''Nantuck:''' But don't you breathe a word of this to anyone, you hear?
::'''Nantuck:''' Such glorious inspiration cannot be reclaimed, should they be lost to someone else.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Nantuck:''' See you. Haha, this idea will be popular, I'm sure of it!

==Trivia==
* Nantuck may be named after {{w|Nantucket}}, an island township in Massachusetts, USA. The island is a historical whaling hub and a setting of the classic American novel ''{{w|Moby-Dick}}''.
* Similarly, his "pitch-black whale" appears to parody the "great white whale" that ''Moby-Dick'' is named after.
