'''Inspiration Eruption''' is a subevent during [[Waterborne Poetry]].

==Tutorial==
{{Tutorial

|text1    = After the challenge begins, characters who defeat opponents within the Mythic Domains will obtain Inspiring Crystal stacks.<br>Inspiring Crystals will rupture once every {{color|help|40}}s. When they rupture, they will unleash a shockwave within a fixed AoE that deals {{color|help|immense}} DMG based on the number of Inspiring Crystal stacks the current on-field character has. The shockwave's DMG will {{color|help|decrease further from the epicenter}}.
|image2   = Tutorial Waterborne Poetry Inspiration Eruption 2.png
|text2    = While the Inspiring Crystals are waiting to rupture, {{color|help|Mythic Nexus}} will appear within the Domain. Such foes will be very tough and hard to defeat. Skilled use of Inspiring Crystals waiting to rupture may aid you in defeating these opponents with ease.
|image3   = Tutorial Waterborne Poetry Inspiration Eruption 3.png
|text3    = After Inspiring Crystals rupture, if the Mythic Nexus has already been defeated, they will once again start to stack. If the Mythic Nexus has not yet been defeated, then the Crystals will not begin to stack again, but the Nexus will be weakened and no other opponents will spawn until it is defeated. After that happens, Crystals will begin to stack again, and opponents of various kinds will spawn once more.
