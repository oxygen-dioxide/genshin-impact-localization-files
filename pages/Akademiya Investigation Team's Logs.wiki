==Akademiya Investigation Team's Logs (I)==
...After completing our investigation of the [[Ruin Golem]], we continued along the path it took until we arrived at a [[Nagarjunites|Nagarjunite]] camp. I heard they had also followed the same road here. However, when they learned of our intentions, they became rather unfriendly...

After negotiating with the Nagarjunites, we finally obtained permission to enter the [[Dahri]] ruins. But this permission comes with limits, and we must only proceed under their supervision...

...They sent a "ranger" named [[Klingsor]] to look after and supervise us. He claimed to be from the [[Dharma Forest|rainforest]], but based on his name, he doesn't seem to have been born in [[Sumeru]]...

...The people of Dahri held secrets beyond our wildest imaginations, and the answers to our questions may lie buried in these colossal ruins. The Nagarjunites' conservative policy towards such priceless artifacts is a travesty, a waste! Even the "ranger" sent to monitor us agrees on this point...

==Akademiya Investigation Team's Logs (II)==
...Incredibly, the devices within the ruins still operate normally even after such an [[Cataclysm|unimaginable disaster]]. Though this means we must be careful of defensive systems, the devices shall be of great benefit to our research...

...We found some traces left by [[Jakob|some]] [[Rene|people]] who came to inspect the ruins. It looks like others have been here long before us. However, their [[Rene's Investigation Notes|records]] are nothing more than gibberish and nonsense, and cannot teach us anything...

...Strangely, that "ranger" is even more interested in the documents we discovered than we were. Perhaps we can use this to induce him to relax his vigil...

==Akademiya Investigation Team's Logs (III)==
...Though defensive mechanisms prevented a thorough investigation of the previous underground ruins, we collected enough astounding information to basically meet the goals of this expedition...

...Due to unknown reasons, a disagreement within the investigative team arose as to whether we should investigate another ruin. Some team members mentioned that they had been disturbed by some kind of sound coming from under the ground...

...At the insistence of our team leader, we decided to continue onward...

...Klingsor has been completely captivated by the knowledge in the ruins, and no longer impedes the continued progress of our investigation in any way...

...By interpreting the records left behind by previous researchers, we have made some unexpected discoveries...

...It seems we can be certain that those [[Hilichurls|mindless races]] that suddenly appeared in the desert in great numbers, the creatures that the Desertfolk mistakenly call "Majuj," are in fact the innocent survivors of that ancient country, transformed somehow...

==Akademiya Investigation Team's Logs (IV)==
...We were attacked...

...The sudden rampage of the defense mechanisms from the previous set of ruins had already caused massive losses to our investigative team...

...Abyssal monsters that never should have been here appeared for some unknown reason... So many members of the team have vanished while trying to evacuate...

...Ever since the monsters appeared, we have lost track of Klingsor's whereabouts. Has he betrayed us? Or did we truly go too far? I don't know, but this may be my last entry...

...Regardless, if the results of this expedition cannot be brought back to the Akademiya, it will be a great loss for the entire world...
