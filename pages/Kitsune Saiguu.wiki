The {{Lang|'''Kitsune Saiguu'''|ja=狐斎宮}}, also known as the '''Hakushin Kitsune''', was a prominent historical figure in [[Inazuma]] who was worshipped as a [[kitsune]] [[god]]dess. She was a descendant of the [[Hakushin Clan]], was a close ally of [[Ei]], alongside the [[oni]] [[Chiyo]],<ref name="Hakushin Ring">{{Ref/Weapon|Hakushin Ring}}</ref> and served a mentor-like role towards a shrine maiden named [[Asase Hibiki]].<ref name="Shimenawa">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Shimenawa's Reminiscence}}</ref>

During a "dark disaster," likely the [[cataclysm]] five hundred years ago,<ref name="500 years">Interactable, [[Pirate's Diary]]: [[Pirate's Diary#Pirate's Diary #4|Pirate's Diary #4]]<br>''We shall be like Domeki 500 years ago.''</ref><ref group="Note">Based on [[Hamayumi]]'s description, many years after Takamine's disappearance (around which time the Kitsune Saiguu also disappeared), Hibiki lent Domeki her assistance. Based on current knowledge, Hibiki lived a normal human lifespan; thus, Saiguu's disappearance occurred within that general time frame as well.</ref> the Kitsune Saiguu was among those who disappeared.<ref name="Shimenawa" /><ref group="Note">Regarding the "dark disaster" and the cataclysm: When Hibiki recounts [[Takamine the Mistsplitter]]'s and the Kitsune Saiguu's disappearances in [[Shimenawa's Reminiscence#Shaft of Remembrance|Shaft of Remembrance]]'s description, she also mentions "Nagamasa joined the Shogunate to clear the Mikoshi name."<br>Through the descriptions of [[Katsuragikiri Nagamasa]] and [[Mask of the Kijin]], it is evident that Nagamasa's adoptive mother was Chiyo, who was "swallowed whole by a beast of sin" when she "fought against the abyss." Though she broke free and slew the beast, she was "stained by a deep sin" and "steeped in darkness as far as the eye could see," causing her to turn on Ei. Similar wording is used in regards to [[Tartaglia/Lore#Character Story 4|Tartaglia]], who wound up in the Abyss and, "within that darkness," learned his fighting techniques and underwent a drastic personality change.<br>Given that Chiyo's corruption (and by extension Saiguu's disappearance) and Domeki's rebellion happened within Hibiki's lifetime, this puts both events within the realm of 500 years ago. According to [[Chunk of Aerosiderite]], a surge of "endless dark monsters with alien, dark blood" occurred during the fall of [[Khaenri'ah]]. In [[We Will Be Reunited]], Dainsleif explains that Khaenri'ah fell 500 years ago, making it extremely likely that the "dark disaster" is another term for the cataclysm.</ref> She was consumed by a "dark will," and both her body and memories were broken down and turned into filth.<ref name="Hakushin Ring" /><ref name="Yougou Cleansing">{{Ref/Quest|Yougou Cleansing}}</ref>

The [[Hakushin Ring]] [[catalyst]] is narrated from her perspective and its blueprint is rewarded after completing the {{Quest|Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual}}, which is related to her.

==Profile==
The Kitsune Saiguu was one of [[Hakushin]]'s descendants and dwelt in the [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Subarea)|Grand Narukami Shrine]].<ref name="Hakushin Ring" /><ref name="Shimenawa" /> Like all kitsune, Saiguu had a longer lifespan than most humans, but it is unknown how long she lived before her death.

===Appearance===
The Kitsune Saiguu had white hair and fur.<ref name="Shimenawa" /><ref name="Tanuki-Bayashi">{{Ref/Quest|Tanuki-Bayashi in the Forest}}</ref> As shown in Raiden Shogun's character teaser, her wardrobe consists of the typical Miko priestess.

==Quests and Events==
{{Quests and Events|As Though Surrounded by Thunder=cinematic}}

==Story==
Little is currently known about the Kitsune Saiguu's early life. She was familiar with the oni [[Mikoshi Chiyo|Chiyo]], complimenting her beauty and her sword skills. At some point, she won a race against [[Reizenbou]], the Chieftain of the Yougou Tengu. Saiguu believed the Tengu was going easy on her, however, to her slight ire. Afterwards, Reizenbou opted to become her protector.<ref name="Hakushin Ring" /> 

She often competed with the [[bake-danuki]] [[Ioroi]], showing up to stop him from causing mischief. At one point, she tricked him into submitting to the [[Raiden Shogun]] by challenging Ioroi to pick a [[Naku Weed]] from the Tenshukaku garden, during which he was caught by Ei. She then tricked (convinced) Ei to spare Ioroi's life and take him under her command instead as the "Protector of the Grove."<ref name="Hakushin Ring" /><ref name="Ioroi">{{Ref/NPC|Ioroi}}</ref> She also secretly learned some of the bake-danuki's magic.<ref name="Tanuki-Bayashi" />

===500 Years Ago and Death===
{{Quote|Do not be blinded. Do not waver. Keep walking the path that you believe in.|The Kitsune Saiguu to the Raiden Shogun, before their final parting<ref name="Yougou Cleansing" />
}}
Around five hundred years ago,<ref name="500 years" /> the Kitsune Saiguu became familiar with a certain group of mortals whom she unexpectedly ended up befriending. Included among them were a "shrine maiden" (Asase Hibiki), an "easygoing young man" (possibly [[Kamuna Harunosuke]]),<ref group="Note">Ioroi's recollection of the onmyouji who sealed him gives the impression that the man had an easygoing personality; Hanachirusato later identifies him as Harunosuke. Hibiki reveals that sometime after Saiguu's disappearance and Ioroi's sealing, Harunosuke left Inazuma entirely.</ref> a "Kanjou" ([[Hiiragi Hiroshi]]), and a "clan who used ingenious techniques to make man-made meteors bloom in the skies" (the [[Naganohara Family]]). She doted heavily on the young [[Yae Miko]], who arrived at the Grand Narukami Shrine shortly before the [[cataclysm]]. She was also friends with the kitsune [[Urakusai]], author of the original ''[[New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune|Chronicles of the Six Kitsune]]'', due to his literary talents and tea expertise. However, he is said to have made a "mistake" which led the Kitsune Saiguu to banish him, and which possibly contributed to the cataclysm's effects in Inazuma. Afterwards, the Saiguu moved from the Grand Narukami Shrine to [[Tenshukaku]], warning that danger would soon come.<ref>{{Ref/Book|New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune|2}}</ref>

When the cataclysm occurred, both [[Makoto]] (the then Electro Archon) and Ei ended up leaving for [[Khaenri'ah]] (the latter some time after the former), while the Kitsune Saiguu stayed behind in Inazuma; this would be their final parting, and they were aware that tragedy would ensue.<ref name="Hakushin Ring" /> The Kitsune Saiguu and those remaining, including Reizenbou, worked tirelessly to protect the land. To protect Ioroi, the Kitsune Saiguu tricked him from staying involved by playing a game of hide-and-seek with him.<ref name="Hakushin Ring" /> Legends relay that during the disaster, the Kitsune Saiguu also guided human refugees to safety in the underground halls of [[Araumi]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Particularly Particular Author}}</ref> At some point presumably around then, Reizenbou and the Kitsune Saiguu also visited the [[Empty Boat of a Thousand Gates]]. While exploring the Araumi underground, Asase and Kamuna found traces of their presence.<ref>Interactable: [[Earth Kitsune Statue#Araumi|Earth Kitsune Statue]] (in front of the Empty Boat of a Thousand Gates)</ref> She also worked to protect the [[Sacred Sakura]] from Abyssal defilement, and set up barriers to protect the [[Thunder Sakura]] roots around Inazuma. She tasked the [[Konda Clan]] with protecting one such barrier.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Strange Story in Konda}}</ref>

Ultimately, after her final parting with the Raiden Shogun, the Kitsune Saiguu disappeared into the "deep darkness," never to be seen again.<ref name="Shimenawa" /> In her dying moments, Kitsune Saiguu asked the "dark will" that gnawed at her to spare her memories.<ref name="Hakushin Ring" /> As her body and mind were consumed, her memories were powerful enough that some of it remained unsullied as it settled into the earth as filth, thus creating [[Hanachirusato]].<ref name="Yougou Cleansing" />

===Legacy===
Around the same time the Kitsune Saiguu disappeared and died, Takamine the Mistsplitter disappeared during a battle against the dark forces,<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Mistsplitter Reforged}}</ref> while Chiyo was consumed by a "beast of sin" and was corrupted by it, drawing her blade against Ei only to be defeated and run away.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Mask of the Kijin}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Item|Narukami's Affection}}</ref> [[Iwakura Michihiro|Mikoshi Doukei]], Chiyo's biological son, secluded himself in [[Konda Village]] out of shame over his mother's betrayal,<ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Emblem of Severed Fate}}</ref> while her adoptive son [[Mikoshi Nagamasa]] joined the [[Shogunate]] to restore the [[Mikoshi Clan]]'s honor instead.<ref name="Shimenawa" /><ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Katsuragikiri Nagamasa}}</ref>

In the wake of their absences, the Mt. Yougou group went their separate ways. The Great Tengu went on a self-imposed exile over her failure to protect the Kitsune Saiguu, leaving [[Teruyo]] behind.<ref name="Shimenawa" /> Kamuna left for [[Liyue]] in the "fury of his mourning."<ref name="Shimenawa" /> The [[Earth Kitsune]] and the [[Sky Kitsune]] turned their forms to stone to await the Kitsune Saiguu's return. Some of these statues, such as the lit [[Earth Kitsune Statue]]s, can be interacted with using the [[Memento Lens]]. Hibiki took over as leader of the Narukami Shrine, awaiting Takamine's return.

Hanachirusato, who formed from the remnants of the Kitsune Saiguu's memories within the filth that contaminated the land, manifested in order to continue performing the Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual. Decades later, when Kamuna returned to Inazuma, she appeared before him and asked him to perform the ritual, initially causing him to mistake her for the real Kitsune Saiguu. Despite quickly realizing Hanachirusato's true nature, Kamuna performed the ritual, and spared her.<ref name="Sacrificial Offering">{{Ref/Quest|Sacrificial Offering}}</ref><ref group="Note">Harunosuke is highly likely the Mysterious Man seen in the memories revealed by the Memento Lens. The Kamuna bloodline utilized sacred words, and the Mysterious Man had to have been familiar with the Kitsune Saiguu to mistake Hanachirusato's presence as her return.</ref>

Ioroi, who had been deceived by the Saiguu, still believes their game of hide-and-seek has been going on to the current day. At some point following the cataclysm, he grew bored when she no longer appeared to play with him, and went out causing havoc to try and lure her out. This led to him and many other bake-danuki being sealed in stone by Kamuna Harunosuke.<ref name="Ioroi" />

==Trivia==
* The Saiguu was a big fan of fried tofu.
** This is most likely a reference to Inarizushi, a type of fried tofu that is said to be preferred by foxes.<ref>Wikipedia, {{w|Sushi#Inarizushi|Sushi § Inarizushi}}</ref>
** One of Saiguu's favorite quotes was "Bring forth the fried tofu!"<ref name="Sacrificial Offering" />
* The kitsune mentioned in [[Retracing Bolide]]'s [[Retracing Bolide#Summer Night's Waterballoon|Summer Night's Waterballoon]] piece was the Kitsune Saiguu.<ref name="Hakushin Ring" />

===Etymology===
* Her name in Japanese {{Lang|ja=狐斎宮}} means "Fox High Priestess."
* {{Lang|''{{w|Saiō|Saiguu}}''|ja=斎宮|ja_tl=purification shrine}}, also read as ''saikuu'', ''itsuki-no-miya'', or ''imimiya'', refers to the High Priestess of the {{w|Ise Grand Shrine}}, the most sacred Shinto shrine in Japan.<ref name="kotobank">Kotobank: [https://kotobank.jp/word/%E6%96%8E%E5%AE%AE-67778 {{ja|斎宮}}]</ref>
** Strictly speaking, ''saiguu'' originally refers to the residence of the high priestess, but it later became synonymous with the priestess herself.
** From the mythological era, ''saiguu'' had been chosen from unmarried imperial princesses. This tradition however ceased to exist in 1336 because of one of the most catastrophic civil wars of Japan (the {{w|Nanboku-chō period|Nanbokuchou War}}), which is coincidentally around 500 years before the fall of the last shogunate (which may have inspired the current upheavals of Inazuma).
* The Ise Grand Shrine enshrines the sun goddess {{w|Amaterasu}} (who is also the ruler of the pantheon and the ancestral goddess of the Imperial House) and the agriculture goddess {{w|Toyoukebime}}. The latter is often equated with another agriculture goddess Ukanomitama (better known as {{w|Inari Ōkami|Inari}}), whose divine messengers are {{Lang|foxes|ja=狐|ja_rm=kitsune}}.
