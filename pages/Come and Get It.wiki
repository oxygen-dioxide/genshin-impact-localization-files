==Trivia==
* The dish is likely a reference to {{Lang|{{w|poon choi}}|zh=盆菜|zh_rm=pén cài|zh_lit=basin dish}}, a traditional {{w|Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese dish}} that is served during festivals such as Chinese New Year.<ref>Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv10436309 {{zh|舌尖上的原神：来来菜、大碗茶、渔人吐司与满足沙拉}}]</ref> It is believed to be invented during the last days of the {{w|Song dynasty}}, when {{w|Zhao Bing|Emperor Bing}} of Song retreated from the attack of the Mongol Empire and reached {{w|Hong Kong}} (some say {{w|Dongguan}}) in 1278–1279, by the hands of the villagers who tried to welcome the emperor as much as they could do (therefore "basin" as an available pot).
* The dish appears in the [https://weibo.com/7072153506/M3RiRAn1u {{zh|【百味盈欢】}}] event of [https://tot.hoyoverse.com/en-us Tears of Themis], another miHoYo game. It can be seen on Luke Pearce's MR card.
