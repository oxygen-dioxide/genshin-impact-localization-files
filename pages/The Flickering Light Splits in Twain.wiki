;(Enter the [[Weary Inn]])
:;(The [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] sleep)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why is it so noisy outside? Paimon's still half-asleep...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well... Guess we should see what's going on.

;(Leave the Weary Inn)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Ah, you're already here. I was just about to come get you.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, you're up early! That's impressive, especially after all the drinking last night...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Let's... not bring up last night. I'm embarrassed about the whole thing.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Anyway, I was also woken up by the commotion. Looks like all the warriors from the Stadium are on the move.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 citlali 04.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I heard many areas have been attacked by the Abyss, including the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]]. I need to head back right away.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Abyss attacked again? Are you sure you can handle it on your own? Do you need our help?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 citlali 05.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I'll be fine. We also have the support of the warriors stationed at the various outposts. Given the quick response, things shouldn't get too serious.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 citlali 06.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' The Stadium could always use more manpower, so you should join the forces here.
:{{DIcon}} What about [[Ororon]]?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 citlali 07.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I'm done making excuses for him. He's not a child anymore. He needs to take responsibility for his actions.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 citlali 08.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I was the one who vouched for him, so I need to report back to the Speaker's Chamber. I'll accept however they choose to handle the situation.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 citlali 09.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' But, I should be able to convince them to let me go back to my tribe first to deal with the attack.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 citlali 10.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' As for the [[Ancient Name]]... Once we handle this crisis, I'll talk to [[Xilonen]] right away. Don't worry &mdash; I never forget a promise to a friend.
:{{DIcon}} Be careful.
:{{DIcon}} I'll keep an eye out for Ororon, as well.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 citlali 11.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Thank you. Alright, I need to start heading back!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She left in a hurry... The situation must be really serious.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like a lot of people are heading to the Stadium. Let's see what's going on.

;(Talk to [[Chanca]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq103 chanca 01.ogg}} '''Chanca:''' Probably won't see much business today, either... Maybe I should head back and help the tribe.

;(Talk to [[Tizoc]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq103 tizoc 01.ogg}} '''Tizoc:''' I'm worried about the situation back home. I'll write a letter to check...

;(Talk to [[Inna]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq103 inna 01.ogg}} '''Inna:''' Even the [[Saurian]]s are getting agitated... I'm feeling a little uneasy, myself.
----
;(Enter the central stadium area)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' {{Traveler}}! Over here! Perfect &mdash; our Star Outlander has appeared!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you're all here! But, uh... What's with the whole "Star Outlander" thing?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Just my way of saying how awesome you are! We've got a real emergency on our hands, so this is the perfect time for you to show off your skills.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, but can we get a quick run-down of the situation first?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' The Abyss suddenly attacked the [[Collective of Plenty]], the Masters of the Night-Wind, the Children of Echoes, and a number of our camps and outposts in the wild.
:{{DIcon}} All at once?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Yes, and the attacks are increasing in frequency.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 chuychu 01.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' The tribes have plenty of defenses, so they're safe for now. But, I can't say the same for the adventurers and merchants stuck in the wild.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 chuychu 02.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Chasca and I have been searching for survivors and treating the wounded. We just got back, but we need to head out again soon.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' I plan on heading back to the Collective of Plenty, just in case my tribe needs me.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What about you, Mualani? Where are you gonna go?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I'll go help the Children of Echoes. They're the closest, so I can start fighting right away.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' What about you guys? We could go together!
:{{DIcon}} I need to talk to the Pyro Archon first.
:{{DIcon}} I learned a few things from [[Capitano|The Captain]].
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yeah, that does sound important. No worries! Just leave the Children of Echoes to us!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hehe, who knows? Maybe yours truly will have the Abyss on the run by the time you're finished!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' That would be pretty great, actually. I hope my tribe gets through okay.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' It'll be fine! Your tribe doesn't do all that body-building for nothing!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Let's part ways here for now, and most importantly... Be careful, everyone.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 chuychu 03.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Oh, and some of us need to avoid getting contaminated by dangerous-looking substances. That will make my job a lot easier.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Chuychu, do we really have to do this now?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ha... haha, it's alright! She's just looking out for everyone.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, let's hurry up and talk to the Pyro Archon, so we can help the others!

;(Approach Mavuika)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Oh, it's you two. As you can see, things are not looking good right now. People across Natlan are in danger.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Look, I'm very interested in your recent adventures, but this is not a good time, so we'll have to keep our conversation short.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's alright! We're also in a hurry. We're gonna go help the Children of Echoes after this.
:{{DIcon}} We met The Captain.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' What?
:{{Black Screen|You tell Mavuika about your brief meeting with The Captain and Ororon.}}
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' So he thinks my plan is too risky. He thinks I'm being stubborn...
:{{DIcon}} Well, is it true?
:{{DIcon}} Can the [[Gnosis]] do what he said?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I shouldn't underestimate the [[Fatui]]'s ability to gather intelligence... The Gnosis does have that function, but there's more to the story.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I will answer you honestly, but you must help me keep this a secret.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I can use the power of the Gnosis to save Natlan, but it comes at a heavy price.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The Gnosis would drain all the souls and memories from the [[Night Kingdom]] and weave them into a giant net, which would surround the [[Ley Line]]s and protect them against Abyssal corrosion.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, you can use souls to weave a net? But, does that mean...?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Yes, it means sacrificing those souls in the process. Souls are just another form of life... The cruelty of this method is self-evident.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The Night Kingdom not only houses the souls of the dead, but also our memories and legends. Using the Gnosis means converting all three into material for the net, erasing our history and culture.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 11.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Even then, the net can still become corroded. If we cannot find a way to repair the damaged Ley Lines before that happens, then all those sacrifices are for nothing.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 12.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Given the enormity of the price, it's a solution I refuse to consider right now. I want us to win, but I also care about HOW we win, and what that means for us in the end.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 13.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Now, it's true, both plans comes at a risk, but, after weighing our options, this is our best bet.
:{{DIcon}} I'm surprised the Gnosis has this function...
:{{DIcon}} It doesn't sound like something an Archon would do.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 14.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Natlan is unique among the nations of Teyvat. Given the ever-looming threat of the Abyss, the [[Pyro Archon]]s had to account for the worst case scenario.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 15.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Having a contingency plan is our duty... not just to the people of Natlan, but to all who live on this continent.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 16.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Still, this has always been a well-kept secret. I'm very curious how The Captain learned this information...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, one more thing... The Captain said he found another way to solve the problem. Could be equally as extreme, though...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 17.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Without the Gnosis, he should have no other option. But, I see no reason for him to lie...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 18.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Seems like our only path forward is to track him down, so he can answer that question for us.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (The Pyro Archon just shared an important secret with us, and she seems sincere. Figuring out The Captain's supposed new way of saving Natlan is the key...)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 19.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Judging by your expression, you must have doubted me, even if just for a second...
:{{DIcon}} Maybe a little.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Not even a little! We would never... Wait, what are you talking about, {{Traveler}}!?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 20.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Haha, just as expected. I appreciate your sincerity.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 21.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Maybe it was out of caution, anxiety, or simple curiosity, but know this &mdash; no matter what, our goal remains the same. We both want to save the people of this land.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 22.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' So, now that you have your answer, do you still doubt me?
:{{DIcon}} Not at all.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew, you scared Paimon! You've really got a lot of guts, {{Traveler}}.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 23.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' That's a good thing. Oh, and feel free to call me Mavuika. It's what all my friends call me, and I like it that way.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 24.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' As for The Captain, the intelligence officers we assigned to the Fatui should be back soon. We'll get our answer then.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's great! Sounds like we just have to wait a little longer...
:{{DIcon}} Are the current attacks...
:{{DIcon}} The beginning of the real disaster?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 25.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Not just yet. Even though the Abyss is attacking several locations at once, I'm confident the warriors stationed in those areas can handle it.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 26.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Don't worry &mdash; I just need to finish coordinating our available manpower, then I'll take a small team to handle the difficult locations.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, you're going to fight in person? Didn't you give up your power?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 27.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' That's true. I'm far less powerful than a god in my current state, but don't forget &mdash; I was an experienced and powerful warrior before I ever became the Pyro Archon.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 28.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' No matter how you look at it, my duty is on the front lines.
:{{DIcon}} I'm sure you're an inspiration to all your warriors.
::{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 29a 1.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Haha, I just think there's strength in numbers. If the people feel emboldened, that's just a bonus.
:{{DIcon}} Sure you're not stretching yourself too thin?
::{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 29b 1.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Now, you doubt my strength? That hurts, Traveler. If we had time to spar, you might think otherwise.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 30.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Anyway, even if we respond to these threats in time, it's not a permanent solution in the long run.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 31.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I've considered moving my people to other nations, but given their close connection to the Night Kingdom, a forced evacuation would have devastating consequences.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 32.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I've told the chiefs of each tribe to strengthen their defenses and advise people against leaving their settlements.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 33.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Now, I just need to find the right time to disclose the true nature of the crisis to the people of Natlan.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's a little worried about how people will react...
:{{DIcon}} I think a lot of people will join the fight.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 34.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Yes, but that won't be the only response. In any case, that's for me to worry about. I'll let you know when we have more information on The Captain.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, we should head out! Maybe we can join up with Mualani? She can't be too far ahead.
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, let's go. Stay safe, Mavuika.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 3 mavuika 35.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Heh, no need to worry about me.

;(Approach the marked location in the [["Children of Echoes"]])

:{{A|vo ntaq103 4 kachina 02a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo ntaq103 4 kachina 02b.ogg}}--> '''Kachina:''' It's {{Traveler}} and Paimon! They're here!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's the situation?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 4 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' There's a trapped caravan that needs our help. We need to rescue them as soon as possible.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 4 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' We'll go together.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 4 kachina 03.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' I&mdash;I'm coming, too!

:{{A|vo ntaq103 6 todar 02.ogg}} '''Todar:''' I can't thank you enough.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 6 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Don't worry about it! We're just glad you're okay. Let's see... Your goods look fine, too. Guess the Abyss isn't after Mora!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 6 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' That should be the last Abyssal Pylon near the Children of Echoes.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 6 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Phew, that was scary, but... We did it!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 6 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' By the way, where's [[Citlali]]? I thought she would come with you.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Masters of the Night-Wind also got attacked, so she went back to help her tribe. She said we can deal with the Ancient Name later.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 6 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' That makes sense. The attacks are more urgent.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 6 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Alright, this isn't a good place to talk. Let's head back to the tribe.

;(Approach the "Children of Echoes")
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Looks like a few people were hurt after all... *sigh* I should have got here sooner.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' The Abyss threw a lot at us at once. I rushed out as soon as I heard the alarm, and there were already so many monsters.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Before long, Kachina brought over a whole group of warriors, and just like that, we destroyed several Pylons as a team.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' I wasn't in charge or anything. We just happened to be together...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 kachina 02.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Still, I think this proves that camping in the wild was a great idea! That's how we were able to respond so fast!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 kachina 03.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Sleeping on the wet grass was pretty uncomfortable, but it was worth it.
:{{DIcon}} I don't mean to be negative...
:{{DIcon}} But, the situation is not looking good.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' You mean the situation in Night Kingdom, right? I feel the same way. We've managed to keep it a secret all this time, but more and more people are realizing something's wrong.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' It's impossible not to feel anxious when things are getting worse by the second, and all we can do is to wait.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 kachina 04.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' And we still don't know when the final two heroes are going to appear...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' That just means we need to buy the Pyro Archon more time! Keep pushing, everyone. Every battle is worth something!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You really are an eternal optimist, Mualani! You always find a way to cheer people up.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Why thank you, hehe... I guess it's one of my better qualities.
:{{DIcon}} I learned a few things you should know.
:{{Black Screen|You share The Captain's intel.}}
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' ...So, specifics aside, the Pyro Archon confirmed that the Gnosis can resolve the crisis, but it comes at a huge price.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' And, somehow, The Captain finds out about it, goes to fight the Pyro Archon, and calls her out for having a solution but refusing to use it...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Honestly, if he has the same information as us, I can't really blame him...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 kachina 05.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' It's probably because our plan is so risky. We don't even know if the [[Heroes of Natlan|six heroes]] will reunite in time.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We talked to Mavuika before we left the Stadium. According to her, the cost of The Captain's plan is too high.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And, well, it makes sense... If that was truly the better choice, she would have picked it!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yeah, I trust the Pyro Archon. When I was upset about Kachina's disappearance, she was really sincere and patient with me.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Plus, she burned down all those precious mementos for Kachina. She's already proven how much she values even a single person's life.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' When it comes to Natlan's survival, there's no way she would hold back.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 xilonen 06.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I agree. Maybe The Captain weighed the costs and came to his own conclusion, but I'm sure we have different priorities.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 xilonen 07.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Life is important, but so are history and memory.
:{{DIcon}} I'm on Mavuika's side, too.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' As the Archon, she can't tell us everything, but it seemed like she wasn't holding anything back this time.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' The next question is... If The Captain found a new way to save Natlan, how come the Pyro Archon has never heard of it?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 kachina 06.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Yeah, and isn't he from [[Snezhnaya]]? Why would the Fatui want to save Natlan?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, this is all super confusing...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 xilonen 08.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 xilonen 09.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' We still don't have enough information. Once we figure out what the Fatui are doing, we'll have our answer.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's head back, then. Mavuika said her intelligence officers should return soon.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' With how many Fatui there are, someone's bound to give something away.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 xilonen 10.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Sounds good. I have a few theories of my own. With a bit more information, we just might get to the bottom of the whole thing.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 kachina 07.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Want to join our garrison, Mualani?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I was just about to ask! Count me in!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 mualani 11.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' If I was just a bit faster, we could have prevented a few people from getting hurt... people who could help us in the next battle. It's all a chain reaction!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 kachina 08.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Then, you should go register right away! It shouldn't take long. Everyone's looking for people!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 mualani 12.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Register? Nah, I'll just follow you around. Y'know, go where you go, do what you do...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 kachina 09.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' U&mdash;Um, okay, but then, you have to follow my orders...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 mualani 13.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hehe, you got it! I just don't wanna make the trip back. It's so far...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 mualani 14.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Alright, see you all later! Let's get together and celebrate once this is over!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you betcha!

:{{A|vo ntaq103 9 chuychu 01.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Were they attacked by the Abyss? No, wait... It looks like they're protecting a group of travelers. Over there! Do you see?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 9 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' You're right. That's a traveling group from Natlan. Could they be trading for something?

:{{A|vo ntaq103 9 tetisheri 01.ogg}} '''Tetisheri:''' But...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 9 baranov 04.ogg}} '''Baranov:''' We're not asking you to cover up our activities. We haven't done anything illegal. Our Captain simply wishes to remain undisturbed.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 9 baranov 05.ogg}} '''Baranov:''' Nonetheless, the decision remains yours. If we wanted to keep you quiet, we would have employed a harsher method.

:{{A|vo ntaq103 9 chuychu 02.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Did you hear that? They mentioned a "Captain." Isn't that who the Pyro Archon is looking for?

:{{A|vo ntaq103 9 chasca 05.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Still, there was no trade. They were just helping people in need... I didn't sense an ulterior motive.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 9 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I didn't believe The Captain when he said he wanted to save Natlan, but based on what we just saw... It's possible he was telling the truth.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 9 chuychu 03.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Maybe we've been wrong about the Fatui this whole time...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 9 chasca 07.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' It's too early to say. Let's follow them, and see what's really going on.

:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Look, I can use this terrain to my advantage. With [[Flower-Feather Clan|our tribe]]'s special way of getting around, I doubt they'll see me coming.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chuychu 03.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' We still can't see anything on the inside. What if you can't find cover? You won't have anyone to watch your back if you go in alone!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' The more heavily guarded the location, the more valuable the secrets. Even if The Captain isn't here, we can still figure out what the Fatui are planning.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' That intel is worth the risk.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chuychu 04.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' *sigh* Fine. You're not gonna listen to me anyway, so let me come with you.

:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chuychu 06.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Fine, don't believe me, but you can't honestly tell me infiltrating a heavily-guarded Fatui hide-out all on your own sounds more reasonable...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chuychu 07.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Y'know, growing up, even if I insisted on doing something, it never gave you any trouble. I'm not sure you can say the same...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chasca 08.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Alright, alright, if we start arguing, this will never end. We can't let this opportunity go to waste.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chuychu 08.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Hehe, guess that means I win. Don't worry, you're not the only capable young person from our tribe. I can handle this.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chasca 09.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Alright, same plan as usual, we split up, communicate with hand signals, make sure our blind spots are covered, and support each other once we strike.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chasca 10.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Got your ropes?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chuychu 09.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Yeah, let's go.
:;(Chasca begins making her way into the guarded area)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chasca 11.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' (The Fatui have eyes all over this place. I should wait for Chuychu's signal.)
----
;(Begin stealth section)
:;(The Fatui turn away from Chasca's location and Chuychu gives Chasca a thumbs up)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chasca 12.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' (Now!)
:{{DIcon}} Go.

;(If the option was not chosen within the time limit)
:;(The Fatui turn back and Chuychu signals not to proceed)
::{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chasca 13.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' (Missed my chance. I'll wait for the next one.)
:;(Continue from the beginning of the stealth section)

:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chasca 14.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' (Not sure how many chances I'm gonna get. I need to act.)
:{{DIcon}} Jump down.

;(If the option was not chosen within the time limit)
::{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chasca 15.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' (I've been spotted!)
:;(Return to "(The Fatui have eyes all over this place. I should wait for Chuychu's signal.)")

:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chasca 16.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' (Good, I made it without getting caught. I should get to that platform over there, but it's guarded by the Fatui.)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chasca 17.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' (Chuychu should have line of sight. I'll wait for her signal.)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chasca 18.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' (That's it. Now's my chance!)
:{{DIcon}} Quickly approach the area underneath the platform.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chuychu 10.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' (It's no use staying in one place. I should keep moving.)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chuychu 11.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' (Looks like Chasca is helping me keeping an eye on the Fatui movements. I'll wait for her signal.)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chuychu 12.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' (Time to move.)
:{{DIcon}} Go.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chuychu 13.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' (Phew, that was close! Almost got caught.)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chuychu 14.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' (Probably can't make it over in one go. I'll wait for my next chance.)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chuychu 15.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' (Now's my chance!)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chuychu 16.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' (Haha, I made it! That'll show my sister...)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chuychu 17.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' (Let's see... The Fatui's occupying all the best locations. If we could just get past them somehow... Wait, I've got it!)
:{{DIcon}} Toss out the mysterious sphere.
:;(It lands near a group of [[capybara]]s and emits yellow smoke)
:;(A capybara falls over unconscious, drawing the attention of the Fatui)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 golikov 01.ogg}} '''Golikov:''' Huh? What's that noise? Did something explode? Ugh, it stinks!
:;(The nearby [[Scions of the Canopy]] come over as well)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 direi 01.ogg}} '''Direi:''' *coughing* What the heck is that? What do you think you're doing?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 golikov 02.ogg}} '''Golikov:''' I could ask you the same thing!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chuychu 18.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' (Good, they're arguing. Looks like they just needed an excuse. They've probably had enough of this job already.)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chuychu 19.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' (The people on the hill over there left to help their comrades. This is our chance!)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chuychu 20.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' (Come get me, Chasca! I hope she gets this hand signal.)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chasca 19.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' (That's Chuychu's signal... Heh, smart idea. Alright, time to move.)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chasca 20.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Give me your hand, quick!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chuychu 21.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Coming!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 10 chuychu 22.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' I checked, and this way is completely clear. It should lead us to the deepest part of this place.
:;(Stealth section ends)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 12 chuychu 01.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Well? I was pretty helpful, right? You know, everyone usually jumps at the chance to work with me. Not my own sister, though... No, she avoids me like her life depends on it.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 12 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I was wrong, Chuychu. You've done well.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 12 chuychu 02.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Wait, you're just gonna admit it? Now I look like the mean one.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 12 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Let's focus on the task at hand. We're in the heart of enemy territory. The more time we waste, the more dangerous this becomes.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 12 chuychu 03.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Alright, alright. If you're not gonna take the bait, then I'll drop it.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 12 chuychu 04.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Looks like the Fatui are here to dig something up. I'm surprised they mobilized this many people... I doubt it's because they're interested in our culture and history.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 12 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' It seems like they're looking for a dragon relic called the "[[Source Mechanism]]."
:{{A|vo ntaq103 12 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' The device is ancient. Barely any information survives to this day, and even people from Natlan don't know how to use it... Why would this be the Fatui's target?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 12 yanovsky 01.ogg}} '''Yanovsky:''' Not bad &mdash; looks like it's in good shape. This should be what our lord is looking for.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 12 yanovsky 02.ogg}} '''Yanovsky:''' Took us long enough. Come on, let's get this thing back.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 12 chuychu 05.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Back? Back where? Should we keep following?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 12 chasca 05.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' You really want to keep going?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 12 chuychu 06.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Of course! We make a good team, don't you think? No reason to stop now!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 12 yanovsky 03.ogg}} '''Yanovsky:''' Hm? What was that sound?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 12 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Uh-oh, we've been spotted. Time to go!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 12 chuychu 07.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Falling rock incoming! Watch out for your gadget!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 12 yanovsky 04.ogg}} '''Yanovsky:''' What!?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 12 yanovsky 05.ogg}} '''Yanovsky:''' *scoff* You'll regret that... After them!
:;(Flashback ends)<!-- black screen transition -->
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Once we got them off our tail, we went back to observe some more. They'd collected several identical pieces of something.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' It looked like they were waiting, though, so we decided to come back.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' So... Chuychu got injured trying to get them off your tail?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 chuychu 01.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' ...Hehe.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' She pushed herself too hard and collapsed on the way back to the Stadium.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 chuychu 02.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Well, I didn't cause you any trouble while we were fighting, right? So, my perfect record remains!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' You've done very well. I could make a comment on knowing your limits, but it's not my place.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 chuychu 03.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' I know, I know... I'm already reflecting on my actions.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' So, our current intel suggests the Fatui is after the "Source Mechanism."
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' The device is a complete mystery, even to us. What does The Captain want with it?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I have no idea, but it's safe to assume the device could serve a similar purpose to the Gnosis.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Xilonen, I need you to gather every scholar in Natlan familiar with the [[Secret Source]].
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' I'll get right on it.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Thank you both for your hard work... Chuychu, it's time for you to get some rest. Oh, and there are gifts from your patients waiting at the Speaker's Chamber.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I've prepared a small gift of my own as a token of gratitude. I'll send it to your home along with the others.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 chuychu 04.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' My patients... That's so nice of them. Hehe, guess that means I'm doing something right.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' You don't need to give us anything, Archon. We were just doing our duty for Natlan. I should take Chuychu home now...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Haha, well if Chuychu doesn't want her favorite [[Saurus Crackers]], then...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 chuychu 05.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Ah, I accept! Thank you, Archon!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 chasca 05.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' *sigh* What am I going to do with you...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' There's some for the rest of you as well. They're one of my favorites, too, so don't be shy.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I'll start investigating the Source Mechanism right away. If I learn anything, you'll be the first to know.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 13 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, yummy snacks!

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's next for you two?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I'm taking Chuychu home. With our parents there to keep an eye on her, I can make sure she actually rests.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chuychu 01.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Hey, it's not like I'm some kind of prisoner! I'll be fine in a day or two. There's no need to go all the way home.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' That's what you always say. Everything's "no big deal" until you collapse.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' What if the Abyss attacks again? You're saying, if I let you rest in a hotel, you're not going to rush out the minute you hear the alarm?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chuychu 02.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' I won't! Triple promise I won't!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Mm-hmm.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chuychu 03.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Fine, on the off-chance something like that were to happen, I might...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chuychu 04.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' But, I'm a doctor. I have a duty to help people in need no matter how hard or tiring the work gets.
:{{DIcon}} We need you.
:{{DIcon}} So, you need to look after yourself, too.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chuychu 05.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' I guess you're right, but I don't have to like it...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, this reminds Paimon of when we first met. Except you were the one trying to stop Chasca from doing something dangerous.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chuychu 06.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' I'd do the same for anyone trying to put their life in danger. As a doctor, I don't want people to get hurt because of a rash decision.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chasca 05.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Then try to see things from my perspective. You clearly want to protect your patients, so can't you understand why your own sister would feel the same way about you?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The two of you are the same, you know.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I disagree. I understand the risks and costs of my decisions.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chuychu 07.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Who wants to be like her? Overconfident, always making excuses when things go wrong...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chasca 07.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' That's just not true.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chuychu 08.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' *scoff* You think I don't have proof?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, okay, don't get into another fight! Just pretend Paimon never said anything.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chasca 08.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Don't worry, Paimon. You didn't do anything wrong. Arguing is just how we communicate &mdash; neither of us really takes it to heart.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chuychu 09.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Plus, I guess we are similar in some ways... Maybe I rush into things without thinking, but I learned that from her.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chuychu 10.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' We're family... I can't help it if my older sister is a bad influence.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chasca 09.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Okay, you don't have to put it that way...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... you're all good now?
:{{DIcon}} This is probably normal for them.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chasca 10.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Neither of us are the type to back down, so we'll always have our differences. But still, we get along in our own way.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chuychu 11.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Plus, I know you'll wake up one day and realize I was right all along. I just need to wait.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chasca 11.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Be my guest. Come on, let's get you home.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chasca 12.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' See you later, Traveler and Paimon. I'll be back once everything's settled at home.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's no rush! At least grab a nice meal with your family.
:{{DIcon}} See you later.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 14 chuychu 12.ogg}} '''Chuychu:''' Bye, you two! Take care of yourselves out there!
:;(The Traveler and Paimon begin walking back to the Stadium)<!-- screen transition -->
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, those two will probably make up for real at some point, right?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, we've learned a lot. Let's go over everything that we know so far.
:{{Black Screen|You and Paimon try to analyze The Captain's goal. You feel like you're just one step away from the answer.}}
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Huh? Footsteps?)
:{{DIcon}} Citlali?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Ahem! Sorry for popping up out of nowhere again, hehe...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, why do you look so awkward? Is there something you need from us?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Okay, I won't beat around the bush. Oh, and I'm sorry for interrupting your rest. I'll treat you to some Charcoal Grilled Steak to make up for it.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Awesome! Just give us your orders!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Hey, friends don't order each other around. I'm just here to share some news. Remember what we talked about before parting ways?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, yeah! You mentioned how Ororon has always wanted to save Natlan, and something about his soul being fragmented.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon and {{Traveler}} discussed it after you left, and we think Ororon is probably back with The Captain. What do you think?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 04.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I agree with your hypothesis, and just now... I confirmed it myself.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 05.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Ororon came back. He helped the Masters of the Night-Wind defend our camp.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? He came back!?
:{{DIcon}} Did he say anything?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 06.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I told him to give up whatever he's doing, but he refused. He said they're just one step away from success, so there's no way he can back out now.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 07.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Apparently, he came back to fulfill his duty to our tribe. When he left, he said it was because he still has a duty to Natlan as a whole.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's surprised you let him go at all...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 08.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I had to prioritize my tribe. Besides, the situation was intense. I couldn't focus on outside and inside threats at the same time.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 09.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Plus, he was on guard. He knew I would try to go after him, so he made sure to keep his distance. I kept an eye out for a good opportunity, but it never came.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 10.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' *sigh* All these years of calling me "granny," and I couldn't do a single thing for him in the end...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't say that! Your tribe all raised him together, right? That couldn't have been easy.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 11.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' ...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 12.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' You're right. Seeing him come back reminded me of when he was little, running around the tribe, dropping by random houses right and left...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 13.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' He's not only a child of the Masters of the Night-Wind, but a child of Natlan. It's only natural for a child to want to do something for their family.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 14.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Besides, Ororon is my apprentice. He might have a few tricks up his sleeve, but I guarantee I know every single one.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, what are you saying?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 15.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Look.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 16.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Remember how I said Ororon's soul is fragmented? This is the talisman I created to keep it stable.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 17.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' And this gem is what makes the talisman work.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 18.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' It just so happens that Ororon is due for a gem replacement. Since I can't get close to him, I put the new gem in a supply bag, and asked [[Ifa]] to bring it to him.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 19.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' You guys know Ifa, right? No? Well, he's a pretty famous vet around these parts. He's always bringing me all sorts of things, and he happens to be very good friends with Ororon.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 20.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Ifa doesn't know what's going on, so he agreed no questions asked. Ororon would find the gem as soon as he opened the bag. He knows how important it is, so I knew he would make the switch.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 21.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' He probably suspected that I tampered with it, but here's the catch &mdash; the trick is on the bag. The moment he touched it, a portion of his memories were copied onto the old gem, which he no longer needed.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's amazing! You can do something like that?
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 22.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Most people can't, but I can.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 23.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' That trick he used to bring you to the Night Kingdom isn't anything special, by the way. My technique is much more subtle. He won't notice anything.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, in other words, we have a whole backup of Ororon's memories in this gem...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 24.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Hmph, the kid thinks he can take me on, like I wasn't the one who taught him everything he knows...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's amazing, Citlali! Let's take a look right away!
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 25.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Once we get to the bottom of this, we can finally track him down.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 26.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' ...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 27.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' ...I know he thinks of me as his grandma, but do you think he'll get mad at me for this? You can be honest...
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, that's a tough question. Paimon doesn't have a grandma, so she's not the best person to ask...
:{{DIcon}} ...It's possible. Families disagree sometimes.
:{{DIcon}} But, as his family, you have to do this.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 28.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' To be honest... I've always doubted my ability to look after him. I didn't stop the ceremony all those years ago, and now, I'm useless again.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 29.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' But if I stop here, it will haunt me until I'm five hundred years old. Every night, I'll wake up in a fit of anger...
:{{DIcon}} And then start crying...
::{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 30a 1.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Yeah, you're right. First anger, then tears... Wait! Who are you calling a crybaby?
::{{A|vo ntaq103 15 paimon 15a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're just making it worse, {{Traveler}}!
:{{DIcon}} And then start freaking out...
::{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 30b 1.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Hah, I don't scare that easy.
::{{A|vo ntaq103 15 citlali 30b 2.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Still, if I back away from this and something happens to Ororon, I would never forgive myself.

:{{A|vo ntaq103 20 olorun 16.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' I want to do something to change Natlan for the better, something that I can accomplish with my own two hands. You're stranger than anyone I've ever met, but maybe... just maybe, you can show me the way.

:{{A|vo ntaq103 20 thecaptain 16.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' That is not something you need to know.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 20 olorun 18.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Don't forget &mdash; I saved your life.
:{{A|vo ntaq103 20 thecaptain 17.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' Do you not believe the Fatui capable of betraying a debt?

:{{A|vo ntaq103 22 citlali 11.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Which means, The Captain has been honest from the very beginning. Ororon's memory proves that.
