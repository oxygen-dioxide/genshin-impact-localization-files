===During Equilibrium===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Zhenhai:''' Welcome to the Jade Chamber, how may I be of service?
:{{DIcon}} Hello, who are you?
::'''Zhenhai:''' I am Lady Ningguang's bodyguard. Traveler, what business brings you here?
::{{DIcon}} What can you tell me about Ningguang?
:::'''Zhenhai:''' Ah, so you're another one of those who wants to find out Lady Ningguang's secrets, are you? Unfortunately, I know no more than you do...
:::'''Zhenhai:''' Lady Ningguang has never been one to let her guards get too close. I'm only in this post in the first place thanks to my cousin.
:::'''Zhenhai:''' Baixiao pestered her about the idea constantly, and even then she only agreed to it reluctantly...
:::{{DIcon}} ...Your cousin?
:::'''Zhenhai:''' Ahem! Sorry, I don't know what you're talking about!
:::'''Zhenhai:''' ...Shh, keep it to yourself, okay? If anyone asks, you heard nothing, and especially not from me!
::{{DIcon}} About physical training...
:::'''Zhenhai:''' Oh, are you interested in training, too? Perhaps we should find a place to do some sparring on one of my days off.
:::'''Zhenhai:''' Although my role in the Millelith is mostly an administrative one, I still prefer to stay fighting fit when I can.
:::'''Zhenhai:''' That's why I often take odd jobs that involve physical labor. A little extra muscle mass where it counts does wonders for one's appearance, don't you think?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Zhenhai:''' Take care, dear guest.

===After Where the Heart Finds Rest===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Zhenhai:''' Welcome to the Jade Chamber, how may I be of service?
:{{DIcon}} Hello there.
::'''Zhenhai:''' I am Lady Ningguang's bodyguard.
::'''Zhenhai:''' Well, that's my title, anyway. In practice, this is a clerical job roughly half the time.
::'''Zhenhai:''' I was doing various odd jobs for a while, before being roped back in here to my old post once the Jade Chamber was restored.
::{{DIcon}} What can you tell me about Ningguang?
:::'''Zhenhai:''' Ah, so you're another one of those who wants to find out Lady Ningguang's secrets, are you? Unfortunately, I know no more than you do...
:::'''Zhenhai:''' Lady Ningguang has never been one to let her guards get too close. I'm only in this post in the first place thanks to my cousin.
