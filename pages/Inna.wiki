{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Inna:''' Hehe, so happy that Moo made a new friend...
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, who's Moo?
::'''Inna:''' He's a little Saurian from our tribe.
::'''Inna:''' Ahh, he's not around here. Probably back at home playing with his [[Manaia|new friend]].
::'''Inna:''' I think she's a kid from Fontaine. She's the wee small sort, and has a very cute nose...
::'''Inna:''' Hehe, she's not a human and can't understand a word of what Moo's saying, but she seems to be getting along with him just fine.
::'''Inna:''' I hope she stays a while to help Moo come out of his shell...
::{{DIcon}} You seem to care a lot about it.
::'''Inna:''' Yeah! After all, they're our companions who live and fight by our side. We can't just think about our health alone, right?
::'''Inna:''' Ah, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm a researcher, and I'm quite familiar with the way Saurians behave.
::'''Inna:''' Some people call me the "Saurian Whisperer," but I don't actually understand their language. I just have a knack for observing how they behave and figuring out if they're sick or unhappy.
::'''Inna:''' If you meet any Saurians that are behaving strangely, come find me. I'll do my best to help you pinpoint the problem and help find a solution.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Inna:''' Hehe... I hope you can make some Saurian friends too!
