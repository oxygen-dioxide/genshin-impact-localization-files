==Descriptions==
{{Description|According to the legend, [[Orobashi|the giant serpent]] that once ventured into the [[Enkanomiya|deep sea]] was finally slain on [[Yashiori Island]]. It is also said that when the sea breeze passes through the eyes and sharp fangs of the giant snake, sounds of a whistle will ring in the wind. That is the requiem it composed for itself. Now, this requiem also provides for those who have fallen or were displaced in the war.|Viewpoint, [[Overlooking Serpent Head]]}}
{{Description|Of the [[Orobashi|giant serpent]] that was defeated by the [[Raiden Ei|Electro Archon]] with the [[Musou no Hitotachi]], only its weather-bleached remains are left today. Although its skull still looks up at [[Celestia|the sky]] defiantly, the [[god]] is already dead, and so the name of "Watatsumi Omikami" is gradually being forgotten.<br>Even if the giant serpent is long dead, you can still clearly feel the traces of its power left behind. Under the influence of the [[Tatarigami]], Yashiori Island has been deserted by its inhabitants. What can be seen on the island are just endless rain and thunderstorms trying to wash away the remnants of the past.|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Exploration], Genshin Impact Official Site}}
