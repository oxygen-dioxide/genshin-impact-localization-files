{{Description|According to the legend, [[Orobashi|the giant serpent]] that once ventured into the deep sea was finally slain on Yashiori Island. It is also said that when the sea breeze passes through the eyes and sharp fangs of the giant snake, sounds of a whistle will ring in the wind. That is the requiem it composed for itself. Now, this requiem also provides for those who have fallen or were displaced in the war.|[[Archive]]}}
