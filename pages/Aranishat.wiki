{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Aranishat:''' Aralila! The next match, Aranishat will hide like raindrops in the river.
:'''Aranishat:''' Aralila can't find a raindrop in the river, so Aralila will lose!
:'''Aralila:''' Aranishat, silly. Raindrops don't always fall into rivers, they get stopped by leaves, and flowers.
:'''Aralila:''' Aranishat will hide like raindrops on the leaves, and Aralila will see Aranishat, easily.
:'''Aranishat:''' Well... Then Aranishat will hide like a seed in the soil.
:'''Aralila:''' Hmm... Aralila needs to think before searching, but Aranishat will lose!

:'''Aranishat:''' Lost to Golden Nara, but happy.
:'''Aranishat:''' But always losing, Aranishat doesn't want it. So Aranishat is training Ararakalari with little Nara... So that Aranishat won't be found.
:'''Aralila:''' Aranishat weak, little Nara don't want to play with Aranishat.
:'''Aranishat:''' Aralila lost to Golden Nara, Aralila weak, too.
:'''Aranishat:''' But Golden Nara enjoyed playing with weak Aralila.
:'''Aranishat:''' So little Nara will play with Aranishat and Aralila, too.
:'''Aralila:''' Well... Aranishat is right. Then, let's visit little Nara together.
:'''Aranishat:''' Yes, let's go together.

===Dialogue Set #3===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Aranishat:''' How many times did Aralila lose? Did Aranishat win?
:'''Aralila:''' So many matches. Who won? Who lost? Aralila doesn't know!
:'''Aranishat:''' Huh? Forget it! Happy Festival Utsava, more important than winning.
:'''Aralila:''' Aranishat... really has a point.
:'''Aranishat:''' Aranishat and Aralila both won, twice. All Aranara, and friends of Aranara, all won, for many times!

* One of the [[Mischievous Aranara]] mentions [[Aralila]] and Aranishat, saying they are better at hide-and-seek than it is.
