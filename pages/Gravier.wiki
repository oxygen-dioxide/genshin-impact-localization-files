==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Gravier:''' Will my career end before it could even begin...?
:{{DIcon}} Need help?
::'''Gravier:''' Uh, I'm fine... I mean, thanks for asking, but I suspect that only I can solve this problem of mine.
::'''Gravier:''' I'm a Gestionnaire, and I'm new here at the [[Palais Mermonia]]. I've been assigned to perform some simple legal work here.
::'''Gravier:''' That said, though, I'm a bit of an introvert. I'm not exactly used to a job like this, where I'll need to talk to lots of people.
::'''Gravier:''' Monsieur [[Neuvillette]] happened by me the other day, and seeing that I looked like I wasn't doing to well, he clapped a hand on my shoulder and gave me a few comforting words... But he just... made me even more nervous.
::{{DIcon}} Would you like to switch jobs?
::'''Gravier:''' Thanks for the suggestion. You're a good person, just like Monsieur Neuvillette.
::'''Gravier:''' I'm new here, and this is my first job, while my superior seems to have high expectations for me.
::'''Gravier:''' He hopes that I will bring some youthful vigor to the rather lifeless Palais Mermonia, and I don't see myself working up the courage to refuse.
::'''Gravier:''' *sigh* If only I had known, I would have switched jobs with [[Iaune]], who only recently joined as well... He seems like a much cheerier sort than I.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry to bother you...
::'''Gravier:''' Oh, don't worry, take care...
