==Strategy==
The Great Snowboar King's attacks are relatively easy to dodge, however they deal a ton of damage. Avoid getting hit by The Great Snowboar King at all costs.
*Characters that can generate [[shields]] with their abilities or constellations can be useful when dodging the Snowboar King's attacks is difficult.

During his Berserker Mode, which is when his eyes glow red and have eye trails, being hit by his icicle attacks will be fatal. They will inflict [[Cryo]] on the character, making it difficult to move, as well as interrupt the character and stagger momentarily. The player may not have enough time to escape the radius of the next icicle.
During his Berserker mode, stay away from The Great Snowboar King and attempt to hit him with ranged attacks. This will also be a good chance to alleviate the accumulated [[Sheer Cold]]. Head north from the battlefield, and within a short distance there will be a [[Ruin Brazier]].
*Do not go too far away from The Great Snowboar King when approaching the Ruin Brazier, for the battle may restart. However, in co-op with another player, the Snowboar King will not despawn; provided at least one of the players in [[Co-Op Mode]] remain close to him.
*In Co-Op mode with another player, the player can also equip the [[NRE (Menu 30)]] for quick healing.

Try to make him charge at the wall, for it will leave him in a stunned state. Take advantage of this time to deal as much damage as possible, because after hitting the wall three times, he will enter Berserker mode.
*While in Berserker mode, making him charge against the wall will no longer stun him.
*The Boar King will also be stunned when charging into certain [[Geo Constructs]] such as Zhongli's Stone Stele. After killing the last frozen boar, run up to the Boar King and create a Geo construct in front of him before he does his initial charge to quickly get him into the stunned state.

{{Description|Amidst the snow and ice dwells an ancient king waiting to be awakened by its ice-entombed brethren.<br />In the distant past beyond memory, a certain legend circulated among hunters out in the wild: when the land sealed by ice returns to life and when an uninvited guest disturbs the deep, frozen silence, the lord and leader of the snowboars unto greatness will awaken from slumber, shake off the ice that shackles it, and bring judgment upon those disrespectful interlopers.|[[Archive]]}}
