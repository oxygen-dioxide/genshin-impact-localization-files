==Strategy==
The Great Snowboar King's attacks are relatively easy to dodge, but deal a lot of damage. Try to avoid getting hit or utilize characters that can generate [[Shield]]s. 
* The [[NRE (Menu 30)]] is useful for quick healing, especially in [[Co-Op Mode]].
* Consume [[Goulash]] to slow the rate of accumulating [[Sheer Cold]].

Try to bait the Snowboar King into charging at the wall, as this will stun it. Take advantage of its stunned state to deal as much damage as possible, since it will enter its Berserker State after getting stunned three times.
*The Snowboar King will also be stunned after charging into certain [[Geo Constructs]], such as [[Zhongli]]'s Stone Stele.
**Before killing the last frozen Snowboar, run up to the Snowboar King's spawn point and create a Geo construct in front of it before its initial charge to quickly stun it.
*While in the Berserker State, the Snowboard King will no longer be stunned after a collision.

During the Snowboar King's Berserker State (when its eyes glow red), getting hit by its icicle attacks can be fatal. They will inflict [[Cryo]] on the character, making it difficult to move, as well as interrupt the character and stagger momentarily. The player may not have enough time to escape the radius of the next icicle.
* Stay away from the Snowboar King and attempt to hit it with ranged attacks. 
* This is also a good chance to alleviate Sheer Cold; there is a [[Ruin Brazier]] located just north of the battlefield.
**Do not stray too far from the Snowboar King, or the battle will restart. However, in [[Co-Op Mode]], this will not occur as long as one of the players remains close.
