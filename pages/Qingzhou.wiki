==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Qingzhou is a poet of some renown, as [[Linling]] brings him up while talking about famous poets in [[Liyue]], while [[Baiwen]] comments that his reputation is well-earned. However, it appears that he is to inherit the family business in three years' time, one which does not involve his artistic pursuits. As such, he is taking the time to make a pilgrimage around Liyue for poetic inspiration.

Qingzhou also has a good memory, remembering most of the contents of [[Meadow of Gems]] word-for-word and transcribing it for the [[Traveler]] on short notice when they were unable to find a copy of it.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Qingzhou:''' To fish, forever moor on the pampas sea... When will the next line come to me? *sigh* ...Oh, hello there!
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Qingzhou:''' My name is Qingzhou, my liege. I might add that I consider myself a poet, if I may be so bold.
::'''Qingzhou:''' In a few years' time I shall have to inherit the family business. I gave my word to meet my father back home in three years' time.
::'''Qingzhou:''' In the meantime, I am on something of a poetic pilgrimage in Liyue; I thought I would avail myself of the relative freedom one tends to be afforded in the years before fully fledged adulthood.
::'''Qingzhou:''' I merely wish for the chance to spread my poetic wings and see how far they carry me... before I either crash or get shot down, that is. Hahahaha.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about your pilgrimage.
::'''Qingzhou:''' I've been to all of the [[Zhongli|Lord of Geo]]'s sacred sites, which has already given me some inspiration to work with.
::'''Qingzhou:''' But all the true marvels to be beheld in terms of Liyue scenery take place in a semi-mystical realm. There is a saying about Liyue's name that captures this very idea: "As man hides Li in a box, so nature hides Yue between the clouds," Li being a precious ceramic ornament and Yue referring to the moon.
::'''Qingzhou:''' The next thing for me to do is to seek guidance from the adepti.
::'''Qingzhou:''' There are legends throughout Liyue of people becoming adepti and ascending to the celestial realm in broad daylight. They say that to take a single visit to the island in the clouds is to say goodbye to the world for many a year.
::'''Qingzhou:''' In other words... Once you set off down this path, you'll get lost in the clouds &mdash; and then who knows when you'll come back down to earth...
::'''Qingzhou:''' Hahahaha...
:{{DIcon}} Can you show me some of your work?
::'''Qingzhou:''' "The sole survivor of an endless war, plagued by anguish for eons more."
::'''Qingzhou:''' "His fleeting figure through Guyun soars, conquering demons in service of his Lord."
::'''Qingzhou''' This one is about an [[Xiao|adeptus]]. For some reason, it just seems so fitting reciting it here...
::'''Qingzhou:''' Hah, listen to me, I must sound like such a fool.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Qingzhou:''' Fare thee well! Though I shan't be accompanying you, I will be with you in spirit.
