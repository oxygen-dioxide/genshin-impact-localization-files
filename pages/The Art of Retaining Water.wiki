|description    = A potted plant that's said to be both "interesting and appropriately aggressive". The plant is a desert specialty with needles densely arranged across its succulent flesh. Thanks to the needles, the water-rich plant is kept safe from being eaten by wild animals.<br />The plant teaches a simple lesson: the importance of deploying armed guards at water sources. Whenever someone brings up the topic of reducing the budget for armed personnel — whether it be in a desert settlement or a division of the [[Eremites]] — the leaders of the guards will carry a thorny plant like this one and make those in the room see reason.
