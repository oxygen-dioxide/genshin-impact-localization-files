:'''Akeor:''' I'm not sure how I did it, but hey, at least we've made a lot of progress, right?
:{{DIcon}} Do you mean...
::'''Akeor:''' Ohh, I mean the wisdom of the ancients!
::'''Akeor:''' I've dug up a lot of treasures ever since I partnered up with this young lady from [[Sumeru]]. We're finding more and more useful tools.
::'''Akeor:''' Have you ever seen a storage device that can compress [[phlogiston]] with three times the usual efficiency? With it equipped, my [[Saurian]] can run as fast as the wind!
::'''Akeor:''' We haven't yet figured out how it works, but man, it feels great to use. Miss [[Tahmures]] has said that we don't have to get to the bottom of everything &mdash; that sometimes, science will work just like magic.
::'''Akeor:''' Still, at this rate, perhaps I'll even become strong enough to sign up for the Pilgrimage...
::'''Akeor:''' Ah well, the contract still takes priority, so I'd better finish the tasks that Miss Tahmures gave me first.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Good luck.
:::'''Akeor:''' Thank you. Thank you!
:::'''Akeor:''' I'd love to have found more useful treasure, but our present gains will fuel my research for a time.
:::'''Akeor:''' Ah, yes, Ms. Tahmures said that we shouldn't make too much of a fuss when the [[Akademiya]] folks show up, since we did leave early without authorization.
:::'''Akeor:''' Seems like research and tournaments both favor those who are prepared to start at any time.

:{{DIcon}} Congratulations.
::'''Akeor:''' Haha, thank you, thank you... Even though I still have no idea what's going on, hehehe...
