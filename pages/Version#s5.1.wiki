|description = "What is meant by offering kindling is the act of offering up a sacrifice before one obtains something."<br />Before setting foot on the battlefield, people often say "victory at all costs."<br />And when the stakes are laid out, there will always be those who have to make the hardest of choices.

* Other than the "Settings/Others" interface, you can now also set whether to "Auto-Lock 4-Star [[Weapon]]s" in the "[[Inventory]] > Weapons" interface.

;Spiral Abyss

* Adds the Spiral Abyss skip function. After the Spiral Abyss update on October 16:
** If you have completed Floor 11 in the previous Cycle of the Spiral Abyss at full stars, then after the Spiral Abyss update, you can claim the full star rewards for Floor 9 of the current Spiral Abyss.

** You can claim all Chamber Bounties for the skipped floors directly via the review pop-up. However, the [[Primogem]] rewards from Star's Bounty will still need to be claimed manually.

;Enhancement and Forging-related
* The "Source" for [[Character Ascension Material|character ascension materials]], [[Character and Weapon Enhancement Material|character and weapon enhancement materials]], [[Character Talent Material|character talent materials]], and [[Weapon Ascension Material|weapon ascension materials]] will now display the quantity that can be [[craft]]ed.

** After performing the relevant crafting operation, the refresh effect for the item list will no longer play.

;Other Systems

* Adjusts the default page of the "Adventurer Handbook": if you have completed the content on the "Experience" tab, while the "Commissions" or "Guide" tab still has incomplete content, the first time you log in and open the "Adventurer Handbook," it will open the "Commissions" or "Guide" page.
* "Character > [[Artifact]]" Interface Function Optimizations:
** Records the Artifact set filters and affixes sorting that you set for a specific character, and when entering the interface again, the Artifacts will be displayed based on the previous filter and sorting settings.
** Adds a new button at the bottom of the Artifacts list in this interface to switch between set filtering and non-set filtering states.

* Adjusts certain dialogue text in the [[Commission]] Quest "[[Tending to a Tepetlisaurus]]."

;Genius Invokation TCG Balance Adjustment
* Redesigns the Character Card "[[Eremite Scorching Loremaster (Character Card)|Eremite Scorching Loremaster]]" (Travelers can visit the official notice "Version 5.1 Genius Invokation TCG Update Details" or log into the game after the version update to see the changes).
* Adjusts the effects of the Character Card "[[Guardian of Apep's Oasis (Character Card)|Guardian of Apep's Oasis]]"'s Passive Skill: The number of Awaken, My Kindred generated at the start of the match has been reduced from 6 to 5; the shield generated after summoning 4 Proliferated Organisms has been reduced from 2 points to 1 point.
