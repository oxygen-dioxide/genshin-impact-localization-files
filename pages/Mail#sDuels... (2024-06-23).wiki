|text      = Recently, I gained a new power during duels, which made me even stronger than before. I thought this power would incite fear in others, but instead, the challengers have only increased... That's right, I'm talking about the newly released [[Genius Invokation TCG]] cards.

Quite some duelists have told me, "You know, you're not as much the solemn sort as I figured."

Well, that's because I wait for the most opportune moments to show-lemn what I've got.

Anyway, there will be a gathering as usual today, and there'll be more friends coming this year.

I'm looking forward to more duels between the two of us.
