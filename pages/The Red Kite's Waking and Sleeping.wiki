|description    = An Amur Maple with a lovely form. Its deep red, almost chocolate leaves each seem to resemble the silhouettes of birds.<br />The Amur Maple was once seen as a marker of the cold seasons, with the deepness of its leaves' colors corresponding to the harshness of the coming winter. However, though [[Inazuma]]'s climate has since stabilized, the leaves of these maple trees still retain their deep red coloration.
