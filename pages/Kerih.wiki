{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Kerih)
:'''Kerih:''' Well then! Are you interested in this strength training camp too?
:'''Kerih:''' Use the equipment as you will, but judging by those sticks you have for arms... Just don't injure yourself, y'hear?
:{{DIcon}} Hey now, I exercise a ton every day.
:{{DIcon}} I'll have you know I can send a [[hilichurl]] flying with one punch.
:'''Kerih:''' Really now? Why don't you go practice your bragging skills on that big square block next to you first?
:'''Kerih:''' {{color|buzzword|Attack}} it or {{color|buzzword|slam}} into it to score points based on your strength. Come on, I wanna see what you've got.

;(Talk to Kerih again, optional)
:'''Kerih:''' Recruiting new people isn't the hard part &mdash; that comes in some time later, when lots of them start finding excuses to take the day off, or just straight up stop coming in.
:'''Kerih:''' The coach has come up with all sorts of ideas to keep their motivation up, that block challenge being one of 'em.
:'''Kerih:''' But in the end, some people tried to boost their scores by ramming straight into the block, and wound up all black and blue for their trouble. That just added to the number of people applying to be excused...

;(Hit the [[Secret Source Dragon Cannon]] using a character's skills, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, that was even harder than Paimon imagined!
:'''Paimon:''' If only we were as strong as a [[saurian]].
:'''Paimon:''' Speaking of which... That [[Tatankasaurus]] over there seems to be practicing its ramming skills...

;(Check the nearby leaderboard, optional)
::First place: [[Varesa]]
::Second Place: [[Iansan]]
::Third Place: [[Sumac]]

;(Read the nearby bulletin board, optional)
::'''Training Ground Announcement:''' "Some trainees have recently been complaining that training on the machines is getting dull, so we've added a new challenge program."
::'''Training Ground Announcement:''' "Ram the '[[Secret Source Dragon Idol]]' to gain points. Whoever tops the rankings will win a prize."
::'''Trainee Message:''' "I get it, the key is explosivity! Ram into the idol and then charge forward forcefully, that's how you get the most points!"
::'''Trainee Message:''' "If you listen to the guy above, you're sure to end up with broken bones... I'm happy to keep lifting weights."

;(Talk to Kerih after completing the challenge)
:'''Kerih:''' ...Are you serious? You broke a corner of that block off?
:'''Kerih:''' The last person to do that was Varesa... Looks like you've got a gift for this, just like her!
:{{DIcon}} It took some effort, I'll give you that.
:{{DIcon}} Heh, easy-peasy.
:'''Kerih:''' I guess appearances really are deceiving. Y'know, I'd hire you on as a coach here if you'd let me.
:'''Kerih:''' Ah, yes. Try some of this "Fruits Aplenty." It's pretty popular amongst our trainees &mdash; word is that it can boost your athletic performance.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Fruits Aplenty|x=1}})
