'''Arlecchino''', also known by her codename "'''The Knave''',"<ref name="lazzo video description" /> is one of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]].<ref group="Note">Given that all other seats are known, Capitano and Arlecchino are likely the currently unidentified Fourth and Tenth seats, respectively, based on [[Tartaglia]]'s remark that he is too low-ranked for Capitano to notice him and Efim's desire to take advantage of Signora's death to raise Arlecchino's prestige. However, no official confirmation on their ranks have been given.</ref> She was first mentioned in the [[World Quest]] series ''[[The Very Special Fortune Slip]]'' in relation to the orphanage she runs, known as the [[House of the Hearth]].<ref name="replacement">{{Ref/Quest|The Replacement's Secret}}</ref>

She makes her first appearance during ''[https://youtu.be/TmaAOV4SJNQ Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo]'' alongside her fellow Harbingers.

==Profile==
{{Quote|Rosalyne died in a foreign land... But you heartless businessmen and dignitaries, always with a convenient excuse to remain in the comfort of your homeland... You couldn't hope to understand. So why don't you keep your mouths shut! We don't want to make the children cry...|Arlecchino|Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo}}
Little is known about Arlecchino beyond her role in running the House of the Hearth. She also deployed Fatui operatives who had grown up in the House of the Hearth to [[Inazuma]] for an infiltration mission.<ref name="replacement" /> It is unknown whether she has a hand in any of the other Fatui dealings that have involved former members of the House of the Hearth.

[[Tartaglia]] expresses a clear disdain of her lack of loyalty towards the [[Tsaritsa]], stating that she wouldn't hesitate to betray the Tsaritsa if it benefitted her and that there "isn't a sane bone in her body."<ref>{{Ref/VO|Tartaglia|About The Knave}}</ref> [[Wanderer]] also expresses a negative opinion of her, stating that she acts graceful and polite but is actually obsessed with holding power over others, and that those who see her darker side vanish without a trace.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Wanderer|About The Knave}}</ref>At [[La Signora|Signora's]] funeral, she expresses disdain for businessmen and dignitaries, including her fellow Harbingers [[Pantalone]] and [[Pulcinella]], deeming them too heartless to be able to understand what it was like for Signora to die in a foreign land, suggesting she felt sympathy for her fallen comrade.

==Story==
Some time ago, Arlecchino deployed some of her agents to Inazuma. [[Efim Snezhevich]], who was made responsible of the operation, decided to take advantage of [[Signora]]'s death to build Arlecchino's "prestige" to repay her kindness. To that end, he ordered Lyudochka to infiltrate the [[Shuumatsuban]] and, after she stalled on her mission upon realizing the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]]'s involvement, changed his plans to sabotaging peace talks between the [[Shogun's Army]] and the [[Watatsumi Army]] by poisoning Watatsumi's water supply.<ref name="replacement" /> However, Efim did not inform Arlecchino of this operation and was recalled to Snezhnaya before the operation could be carried out, giving the Traveler and [[Momoyo]] an opportunity to cut Lyudochka free from the Fatui.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Where the Dandelions Find Rest}}</ref>

Arlecchino also deployed some agents to [[Sumeru]] to unearth the [[The Orchard of Pairidaeza|Eternal Oasis]], along with helping [[Froderock Fronkonsteen]] find a "live subject" in the desert.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Make Bright the Arrows, Gather the Shields...}}</ref>

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* In ''{{w|commedia dell'arte}}'', a type of Italian theater, "{{w|Harlequin|Arlecchino}}" (Harlequin) is an astute servant, often acting to thwart the plans of his master and pursuing his own love interest, Columbina, with wit and resourcefulness, often competing with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot.
**This seems to match with Tartaglia's accusation of her, that she'd turn against the Tsaritsa (her master) in a heartbeat if it benefited her.
