==Profile==
{{Quote|Rosalyne died in a foreign land... But you heartless businessmen and dignitaries, always with a convenient excuse to remain in the comfort of your homeland... You couldn't hope to understand. So why don't you keep your mouths shut! We don't want to make the children cry...|Arlecchino|Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo}}
Little is known about Arlecchino beyond her role in running the House of the Hearth and her deployment of Fatui operatives to [[Inazuma]].

Orphans raised in the House of the Hearth are given the {{w|Eastern Slavic naming customs#Patronymics|patronymic}} "Snezhevich" or "Snezhevna" &mdash; meaning "Son of Snow" or "Daughter of Snow". The orphans are raised as members of the Fatui and are then sent on infiltration missions across [[Teyvat]].<ref name="replacement" /> Orphans raised there appear to be extremely close; several of [[Efim Snezhevich]]'s subordinates remark that he favored [[Lyudochka Snezhevna]] due to her shared history in the House of the Hearth,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Shuumatsuban Operations}}</ref> while [[Katarina|Katarina Snezhnevna]] refused to leave [[The Chasm]] in her futile search for her brother [[Nikolay|Nikolay Snezhevich]].<ref name="vanishing deep">{{Ref/Quest|A Company Vanishing Into the Deep}}</ref>

[[Tartaglia]] expresses a clear disdain of her, stating that she wouldn't hesitate to betray the Tsaritsa if it benefitted her.

==Story==
Some time ago, Arlecchino deployed some of her agents to Inazuma. Efim Snezhevich, who was made responsible of the operation, decided to take advantage of [[Signora]]'s death to build Arlecchino's "prestige" to repay her kindness. To that end, he ordered Lyudochka to infiltrate the [[Shuumatsuban]] and, after she stalled on her mission upon realizing the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]]'s involvement, changed his plans to sabotaging peace talks between the [[Shogun's Army]] and the [[Watatsumi Army]] by poisoning Watatsumi's water supply.<ref name="replacement" /> However, Efim did not inform Arlecchino of this operation and was recalled to Snezhnaya before the operation could be carried out, giving the Traveler and [[Momoyo]] an opportunity to cut Lyudochka free from the Fatui.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Where the Dandelions Find Rest}}</ref>

Katarina Snezhevna and Nikolay Snezhevich, both of whom were part of the Ninth Company dispatched to [[The Chasm]], were also orphans raised in the House of the Hearth.<ref name="vanishing deep" />
