'''Chitose'''{{Lang|ja=千世}}, formerly known by the alias '''Momoyo''' {{Lang|ja=百代}}, is an open-world [[NPC]] in [[Ritou]], [[Inazuma]] who appears after completing the {{Quest|The Very Special Fortune Slip}}. She is part of the [[Shuumatsuban]].

==Profile==
"Chitose" is the current codename of a ninja of the Shuumatsuban who previously posed as a shrine maiden at the [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Subarea)|Grand Narukami Shrine]] under the name "[[Gendou Ringo]]," an alias she picked for herself. She worked alongside [[Momoka]].

Momoka was presumably killed by the [[Fatui]] during one of her operations, but left behind her own secret code in an attempt to root out the Fatui trying to infiltrate the Shuumatsuban. As each ninja had their own special code, those who tried to use Momoka's would be immediately revealed as an imposter. The [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]], traveling around Inazuma, came across the code strip by chance while exploring [[Araumi]]. They brought the code to Gendou Ringo, who was surprised. Suspecting them of being Fatui spies, she sent them to defeat some Fatui agents to discern their intentions and tailed them. In the process, she was ambushed by other Fatui spies, although she was able to escape them by faking her death. [[Lyudochka Snezhevna]] took her place as "Gendou Ringo," who continued giving them missions in hopes of infiltrating the Shuumatsuban.

After the Traveler eliminated the "Demonbane Kin," the former Gendou Ringo left a note on the slip, which Paimon took out of curiosity. When they arrived, she knocked the Traveler out and took them to her safehouse, where she demanded to know how they came across Momoka's code. The Traveler explained the situation to her, which she believed, as they did not report to the Fatui after each mission. The following day, she had them rendezvous with her at the safehouse, where she believed that her imposter was trying to infiltrate the Shuumatsuban and tasked the Traveler with finding information on what the Fatui were up to. Here, she tells them to call her "Momoyo."

The Traveler learned that Momoyo's imposter, Lyudochka, was being given new orders regarding [[Watatsumi Island]]. Momoyo gave them some elemental powder so they could track Lyudochka, where they eavesdropped on a conversation between her and her superior [[Efim Snezhevich]] on the nature of the operation. After defeating Lyudochka, who expressed genuine remorse and did not want to proceed with the operation, the Traveler took pity on her and asked Momoyo if she could create a fake corpse of the former. Momoyo was surprised but accepted the request, "killing" Lyudochka and allowed herself to get captured by the Fatui to convince them that Lyudochka was dead. In the ensuing scuffle, a Fatuus shot the box of powder, some of which got into her eyes.

The Traveler soon discovered Momoyo through the trail of powder she had left behind and freed her from the Fatui safehouse. Due to the injuries she sustained, she lost sight in her left eye, but shook it off as a worthy trade for exposing the Fatui and remarked that she could now infiltrate a pirate group if needed. Momoyo returned to the shrine and contacted [[Sayu]], after which she departed from the shrine.

One of Efim's subordinates was captured by the Shuumatsuban and "persuaded" to give up information about his superiors. The Shuumatsuban learned that after the title of The Knave [[Arlecchino|changed hands]], Efim had broken off from the [[House of the Hearth]] with some unsuspecting subordinates and continued to pursue [[Crucabena|the previous Knave]]'s objectives. Some time later, Momoyo is given a new mission to find and remove any remaining operatives of Efim, and changes her alias to "Chitose."

;(After completing The Very Special Fortune Slip)
:'''Chitose:''' Tch. Nothing through the smuggling pipeline either, huh...
:'''Chitose:''' What can I do for you? If you're a tourist, go look for the [[Outlander Affairs Agency]].
:{{DIcon}} Momoyo?
::'''Chitose:''' Who? You've got the wrong person.
::{{DIcon}} Sorry, I must have mistaken you for someone else. See you.
:::'''Chitose:''' See you.
::{{DIcon}} Sorry about that. What are you going by nowadays?
:::'''Chitose:''' I don't know what you're talking about...
:::'''Chitose:''' ...
:::'''Chitose:''' *sigh* Alright. Looks like there's no hiding from you. Just call me "Chitose" for now.
:::{{DIcon}} New mission, Chitose?
::::'''Chitose:''' Fine. I can tell you &mdash; I do still owe you, after all. Hmph. Would make it easier for you to watch your own back, too. You've got Fatui enemies everywhere, after all.
::::'''Chitose:''' I'm still investigating that [[Efim Snezhevich|"Teacher"]] character. We captured one of his aides, and "persuaded" him to provide us with some interesting information.
::::'''Chitose:''' This "Teacher" was originally an instructor at the [[House of the Hearth]]. When the title of "The Knave" changed hands, he broke off with some unsuspecting subordinates and pursued the [[Crucabena|previous Knave]]'s directives.
::::{{DIcon}} Changes?
:::::'''Chitose:''' Several years ago, a serious clash appears to have occurred between the previous Knave and [[Arlecchino|a certain child]] at the House of the Hearth &mdash; this led to the latter replacing the former.
:::::'''Chitose:''' Of course, this assumes that our captive speaks the truth. Taking a Fatuus's words at face value would be the height of folly.
:::::{{DIcon}} I hope everything goes well for you.
:::::'''Chitose:''' Heh. Rather than wish me well, you'd best take care of yourself. You'll grieve people if you keep rushing into danger the way you have until now.
::::{{DIcon}} You don't know?
:::::'''Chitose:''' The "Teacher" appears to be using The Knave's name to keep a hold over his subordinates as they act across various nations &mdash; his goal and present affiliation, however, are unclear.
:::::'''Chitose:''' He has likely left some "tacks" within Inazuma. My goal is to find every last one &mdash; and pluck them out.
:::{{DIcon}} About Lyudochka...
::::'''Chitose:''' Lyudochka? I don't recall anyone by the name. Don't you mean "Gendou Ringo"?
::::'''Chitose:''' And those broken pieces of paper aren't giving her too much trouble, are they?
::::{{DIcon}} She's doing a great job at the shrine.
::::'''Chitose:''' Hmph. Good. She's more suited to that work than I.
::::'''Chitose:''' You should be taking care of yourself &mdash; you and your [[Paimon|floating white friend]]. Keep getting yourself in trouble like this, and you'll grieve "Gendou Ringo"'s poor heart.
:{{DIcon}} Alright. See you.
::'''Chitose:''' See you.
