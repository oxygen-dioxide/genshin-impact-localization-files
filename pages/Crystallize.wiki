==Overview==
Crystallize shards last on the field for 15 seconds, though there is a short delay before they can be picked up. If more than 3 shards are on the field, after about 2 seconds all shards except the 3 newest ones will disappear. The shields they grant last for 15 seconds. Only a single Crystallize shield can be active at any time; picking up another shard overwrites the old Crystallize shield. Crystallize shards cannot be picked up by enemies.

Crystallize can only be triggered once per second on the same target.

Note that [[Geovishap Hatchling]]s and the [[Pure Geo Hypostasis]] can create Geo Elemental Shards during combat, but these are different from the Elemental Shards generated by Crystallize. While the shards and the shield granted when picked up look similar aside from the color, the resulting Geo shield can coexist with regular Crystallize shields&mdash;it does not override them.

==Shield Health==
[[File:Crystallize Level Scaling Graph.png|alt=Crystallize level scaling graph|thumb|250px|Character Level vs. Crystallize Shield Base HP]]
A '''Crystallize''' shield's base health (damage absorption) is derived from the triggering Geo user's level, and is then increased by a certain percent depending on the Geo user's [[Attributes#Elemental Mastery|Elemental Mastery attribute]].

Like all other shields, these elemental shields absorb a set amount of damage before breaking and are 250% effective against their own element (meaning they only take 40% as much damage from said element compared to others<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/2rRFMgqpKKM Crystallize and Shields Explained]</ref>) and increase [[Interruption Resistance]] while active.

Crystallize shields can coexist with other shields, but each shield will take full damage at the same time (before accounting absorption efficiency).<ref>HoYoverse News: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/6085 Developers Discussion - 10/22]</ref>

A character's [[Attributes#Shield Strength|Shield Strength attribute]] reduces the damage taken by any shields they have while they are active, rather than increasing the HP of shields they create.<ref>Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/jkui1a/a_closer_look_at_the_crystallize_reaction A closer look at the Crystallize reaction]</ref><ref>NGA: [https://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=24582879&rand=866 <nowiki>[数据讨论]结晶反应护盾值计算相关</nowiki>]</ref>

For the base Shield HP of Crystallize per Level, see [[Elemental Reaction/Level Scaling]].

The percentage increase on Shield HP due to [[Elemental Mastery]] is given by:
::<math> 4.44 \times \frac{\text{EM}}{\text{EM} + 1400} \times 100 \%</math>

This formula can be closely approximated (in the EM range from 0 to 1000) by:

::<math>1.31676 + 0.285392 {\text{EM}} - 0.000103375 {\text{EM}}^2</math>

{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Elemental Trial Crystallize 1.png
|text1  = When {{Geo}} attacks come into contact with {{Hydro}}/{{Pyro}}/{{Cryo}}/{{Electro}}, Crystallize will be triggered. This reaction will create Elemental Shards of the corresponding element, which can provide characters with shielding of that element. Make good use of Crystallize to effectively decrease DMG taken in battle.

|text2  = Use {{Hydro}}, {{Pyro}}, {{Cryo}} and {{Electro}} attacks in battle to infuse opponents with the elements. Switch to a {{Geo}} character and use {{Geo}} attacks to trigger the Crystallize reaction and obtain a shield. Perhaps you may yet defeat your opponents without taking so much a scratch yourself...
