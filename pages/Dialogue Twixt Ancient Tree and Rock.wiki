|description    = This green-leafed tree and mountain rock aren't anything special.<br />A certain alley poet once claimed that everything in this world has an aura and that this tree and the rock were having a wordless conversation. Many others, influenced by her words, came to believe more and more that these words were quite fitting indeed.
