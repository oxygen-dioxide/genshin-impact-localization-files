'''Clear Adjudication''' is [[Neuvillette]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
Neuvillette wears a black ribbon with a blue underside and gold ornamentation fastening his hair. Two ornate gold hairclips fasten his hair above his left ear, with one bearing a feather-like blue attachment. He wears a white shirt with ruffled cuffs, with a ruffled white jabot at his collar. The jabot fades to blue at its tails, is darker blue around the neck, and is fastened in the center by an ornate gold brooch with an iridescent teardrop set in the center and a dangling blue teardrop gem. He has black gloves with gold rivets at the knuckles on both hands. Over the shirt is a long, navy-blue jacket with indigo patterns and gold details, including fleur-de-lis shaped closures on the folded cuffs. The sides of his jacket fade to brighter teal. Attached to the jacket is a dark blue capelet with wide notched lapels in gold and blue, with gold details and teal designs. From the two front ends of this capelet dangle two gold ornaments such that it resembles the scale of the [[Court of Fontaine]].   

He wears navy-colored pants, over which are thigh-high black spats with golden details. His shoes are black with gold details and blue soles bearing the designs of the scales of [[Fontaine]].
