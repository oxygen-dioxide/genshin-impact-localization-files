{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Eiko''': There has to be something wrong with the way the Guild rated this commission's difficulty...
:{{DIcon}} Not going back to the Guild yet?
::'''Eiko''': Oh, hey, it's you.
::'''Eiko''': [[Taisuke]]'s been really taken with that talking cat named [[Neko]]. He insists that we continue investigating for a while.
::'''Eiko''': I'm just here to make sure that he doesn't do anything idiotic in the process.
::'''Eiko''': And I'm also taking this opportunity to slack off for a bit.
::{{DIcon}} Do you not like Neko?
::'''Eiko''': I don't think I'd put it in those terms. I've just got no interest in her.
::'''Eiko''': I came to this island to get this commission done.
::'''Eiko''': I've never been very interested in much other than that.
::'''Eiko''': The way I see it, if you get too invested in things outside the remit of your commission while you're doing it, you'll veer off onto a branching path...
::'''Eiko''': And I wouldn't call that a good thing for a professional adventurer.
::{{DIcon}} Well, isn't the commission complete?
::'''Eiko''': Yes. Which is why I'm over here slacking off in the Guild's name, see?
::'''Eiko''': I wouldn't dare hang around here doing nothing otherwise.
::'''Eiko''': To tell you the truth, though, this place is still very concerning.
::'''Eiko''': "[[Asase Shrine]]," "[[Asase Hibiki|Hibiki]]"... and of course, "[[Ako Domeki|Domeki]]."
::'''Eiko''': I just feel that many heretofore undiscovered secrets still lie buried here on [[Seirai Island]].
::'''Eiko''': That said... Heh, I'm too lazy to figure them all out myself.
::'''Eiko''': Once we get back to the Guild, I'll settle those reports, and we'll leave it to them to figure out a larger schema for exploring Seirai Island.
::'''Eiko''': But before that... let me just slack here for a while more.
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Eiko''': Goodbye, and safe travels!
