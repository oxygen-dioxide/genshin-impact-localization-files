{{Location Intro|description=<p>Port Ormos is the largest port in Sumeru and serves as a hub for trading and travel. It is located beneath two giant trees, between which a river runs from [[Sumeru City]] to the port.</p><p>Though parts of Port Ormos are under the supervision of the Akademiya, smuggling and other illegal activity is more common at Port Ormos than in Sumeru City.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Shayan}}</ref> Prices also tend to be lower than in Sumeru City.<ref>{{Ref/BB|Port Ormos Bulletin Board|Shapur Hotel}}</ref> Most long-term residents in the port are traders and laborers who grew up in the area,<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Neriman}}</ref> but a number of [[Eremite]] merceneries from various factions can also be found there. Students often come to the port when academic life gets too stressful, and it is even considered good luck to some.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lost in Prosperity}}</ref></p>}}

{{Description|"Bah! The lectures of the sages are beyond boring. Why don't we get ourselves some fine wine garnished with floral honey and set out on a journey across the seven seas?"|Viewpoint, [[The Harbor Betwixt the Two Trees]]}}

==Lore==
According to the researcher [[Farahnaz]], Port Ormos was originally known as Orghana, the city of the Twenty-Nine Deys. These Deys were all leaders of pirate crews who created an alliance with each other to create a fair division of power and maintain peace and prosperity. However, infighting led to instability, and all of the Deys were eventually wiped out by an attack by a particularly powerful sea monster.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Farahnaz}}</ref>

An alternate account in ''[[The Shepherd and the Magic Bottle]]'' claims that the city of the Twenty-Nine Deys was called Orghana, and Port Ormos is mentioned separately in the same book. The book is set fifteen years after Port Ormos' construction, after a boy from the Gravelsong Dunes living near the city discovers a magic bottle containing a jinni, but the book's credibility is questioned in its description.

==Trivia==
*It is possible that Orghana is the original city which Port Ormos was later built over, and Farahnaz is retroactively calling the original city by its modern name. (See the Etymology section below for details.)

===Etymology===
*{{lang|''Ormos''|el={{wt|όρμος||Greek}}}} is a Greek word which means "cove" or "small bay."
*Port Ormos may also be a reference to the {{lang|{{w|Ormus|Kingdom of Ormus}} (or Hormuz)|fa=هرمز}}, which was located in southern Iran and controlled a major port city along the {{w|Strait of Hormuz}}, similar to Port Ormos' location in southern Sumeru. The etymology of Ormus/Hormuz has been debated, but the prevailing theory is that it comes from {{lang|Hormazd/Ohrmuzd|fa=اورمُزد}}, the Middle Persian name for the Zoroastrian creator deity and Lord of Wisdom, {{w|Ahura Mazda}}.
**{{w|Hormuz Island}}, which was named after the Kingdom of Ormus/Hormuz and was later the location of the kingdom itself, was known as {{lang|Organa|grc=Όργανα}} to the ancient Greeks. This is likely the etymological basis for "Orghana" in ''The Shepherd and the Magic Bottle''.
**The name Ormazd, likely derived from ''Ohrmuzd'' whom the real-life Kingdom of Ormus was named after, appears in ''[[The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin]]'' as the name of the third-to-last ruler of the ancient city of [[Gurabad]]. It remains to be seen whether any connection exists between ''Ormos'' and ''Ormazd'' in the world of Teyvat.
