{{Description|A raven feather pinned to a knight's cape. Countless bloodstains have dyed it pitch black.}}
'''Bloodstained Black Plume''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Bloodstained Chivalry]].

==Description==
One of the countless raven feathers stuck to the Bloodstained Knight.<br>For where there is blood, ravens shall follow.

In the end the [[Bloodstained Knight]] could no longer tell whether the blood that stained him was his own or that of his enemies.

Eventually, on his long journey filled with bloodshed, he came to a realization:<br>His path of so-called chivalry had turned him from the white knight he used to be into the monster he had now become.<br>His only followers were the ravens drawn to the bloodshed he left in his wake.
