'''Nanna''' is a quest-exclusive [[Yumkasaurus]] [[NPC]] that appears in the {{Quest|The Last Turnfire Night}}. She is the [[Saurian]] companion of [[Huni]] and her father [[Trinidad]].

==Profile==
Nanna is a [[Yumkasaurus]] belonging to Huni and her father Trinidad, and the mother of the three [[Yumkasaur Whelp]]s [[Pocchi]], [[Poggi]], and [[Ponini]]. She lived happily with her family until during a Turnfire Night she was attacked by the Mountain King [[Kongamato]] and was tainted by his [[Abyss|Abyssal]] energy. This would lead her to jump off a cliff making her family believe she was dead. 

In truth, she survived the fall due to landing on [[Enjou]], who became captivated by bungee jumping from the incident. He tended to her wounds before leaving to negotiate a deal with [[Kinich]], only to be caught in a trap meant to have the [[Traveler]] interrogate him for information. After fleeing from the two, Enjou returned to Nanna, discovering that her wounds had fully healed, but also realized that she missed her family.

After the Mountain King problem was resolved, Enjou returned Nanna to her family. 

===Appearance===
Nanna's design is similar to other adult Yumkasaurus, but she wears green goggles with orange lenses.
