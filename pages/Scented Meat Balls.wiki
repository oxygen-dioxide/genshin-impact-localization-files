|description     = A dish with ground meat as its base.
|desc_suspicious = One may find it hard to guess what's inside based on its dull appearance. If you try taking a small bite… Yep, there's wheat in there. It'll probably scrape your lips if you're not careful enough.
|desc_basic      = After crushing the wheat and cooking it over a fire, ground meat was added to form the outer layer. Onions and meat were then stir-fried to make the filling. Finally, the mixture was molded into balls and deep-fried until golden. Enjoying meat by the mouthful has never been this easy!
|desc_delicious  = The crunchy and chewy coating wraps around the savory filling, giving it a layered texture that's easily a cut above regular meatballs. Try eating one, and its irresistible aroma will leave you brimming with satisfaction.
