==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Okazaki Rikuto''': Youngster, are you hungry already? Come and try some of [[Okazaki Erika|Erika]]'s cooking!
:{{DIcon}} And who might you be?
::'''Okazaki Rikuto''': I'm the owner of this izakaya.
::'''Okazaki Rikuto''': Feel free to order anything. Just place your order with Erika. As far as I'm concerned, her cooking is one of the best in Inazuma City.
::{{DIcon}} You're the owner, and you're drinking?
::'''Okazaki Rikuto''': Why not? Sake in my hand, fine cuisine at my table... After a busy life like mine, I think I'm owed at least a drink or two.
::'''Okazaki Rikuto''': You keep up the good work yourself! And when you're the boss someday, you can live like me, too.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I still can't drink alcohol.
::'''Okazaki Rikuto''': That's because you are still young.
::'''Okazaki Rikuto''': There are also benefits to not drinking. You are still young, so there's no hurry.
::'''Okazaki Rikuto''': Let's have some barbecued skewers. They're delicious even without the drinks.
:;(Obtain [[Tri-Flavored Skewer]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} I've heard that you're a real big shot.
::'''Okazaki Rikuto''': Hmm? Who told you that?
::'''Okazaki Rikuto''': Haha, Erika must have been bragging about me again.
::'''Okazaki Rikuto''': To be honest, I did have a pretty stand-up reputation when I was at the [[Tenryou Commission]]. Though I'm retired now, [[Yoriki]] and [[Doushin]] still often come to me for advice.
::'''Okazaki Rikuto''': Recently, even some major figures from headquarters have visited our store... It seems like there's something afoot in Inazuma...
::{{DIcon}} Inazuma is currently...
::'''Okazaki Rikuto''': Ah, you're still young, dear customer. What do you care about politics in Inazuma?
::'''Okazaki Rikuto''': Well, it's understandable. You are a traveler from afar, after all. It would be troublesome if you got stuck in Inazuma.
::'''Okazaki Rikuto''': If I must shed some light on the matter... the Tenryou Commission believes in the power of our [[Raiden Shogun|Almighty Shogun]]. She definitely has her reasons for making her choices.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me more about Seishimaru. {{Verify}}
::'''Okazaki Rikuto''': Oh, so you're interested in this tale, are you, youngster?
::'''Okazaki Rikuto''': I shan't hide it from you, then. Seishimaru was once a relative of mine.
::'''Okazaki Rikuto''': His tale was the talk of the town back in the day &mdash; not that I'd expect any young people to know of it now, though.
::'''Okazaki Rikuto''': I've lived for several decades myself and seen my own fair share of things. In truth, real life is often more exciting than fiction, hehe.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Okazaki Rikuto''': Yeah, come back anytime.

==Event Dialogue==
===Hues of the Violet Garden===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Okazaki Rikuto:''' Hello there, youngster. Have you attended the festival that the Yashiro Commission and Yae Publishing House have organized in Ritou?
:'''Okazaki Rikuto:''' I've heard that it's very well done indeed and that it's been very popular amongst the youngsters. Even a store run by an old codger like myself got quite a lot of customers who came for the festival.
:'''Okazaki Rikuto:''' Everyone's all dressed up to nines and in high spirits, to boot.
:'''Okazaki Rikuto:''' Which is good, of course, very good! It feels like Inazuma itself is growing younger once more, haha!
