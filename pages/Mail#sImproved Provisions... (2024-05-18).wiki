Those alchemical potions we bought from you last time were just amazing! Everyone feels like they have a lot more energy while they work, and the cargo ship that carried them also brought way more goods than usual.

Speaking of goods... Though we all understand that relying solely on imports isn't practical in the long term, rushing things here won't do us any good. We still need to improve productivity on Watatsumi Island, one step at a time. In the meantime, instilling confidence and maintaining morale is equally important. So, after some deliberation with the soldiers, we decided to work together and use some really novel ingredients to make a celebratory cake!

You're the hero behind our success this time, so please be sure to have a taste of this "Morale Cake." And let's continue to work hard together in the days to come!
