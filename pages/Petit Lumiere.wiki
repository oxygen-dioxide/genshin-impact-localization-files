{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Petit Lumiere:''' How about it? Ready to try your hand at filming?
:{{DIcon}} Yep.
::'''Petit Lumiere:''' Excellent. I've already set up the scene, the actors are ready, and all is awaiting your arrival.
:{{DIcon}} About your older brother...
::'''Petit Lumiere:''' [[Lumiere]] is much older than I, but that poses no obstacle to us brothers working together.
::'''Petit Lumiere:''' We were not yet famous when we filmed "The Arrival of an Aquabus" and "Employees Leaving the Factory."
::'''Petit Lumiere:''' We two brothers have done everything together, because no one was willing to assist directors who were not yet famous, haha!
::'''Petit Lumiere:''' If you are interested, you can go see those two films.
:{{DIcon}} I'm not ready yet.
::'''Petit Lumiere:''' No problem, I understand. A quality product requires time to incubate and nurture.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
* Petit Lumiere and his mentioned older brother are based on the 19th century French filmmaker brothers {{w|Auguste and Louis Lumière}}, known for their short films and the invention of the {{w|Cinematograph}} motion picture film mechanism.
