'''Thunderstones''' are rocks within some [[Thunder Barrier]]s that inflict {{Color|True Electro DMG}} over time. They can be temporarily disabled by approaching them while being accompanied by an [[Electrograna]], which are needed to pass through their Thunder Barriers. Making contact with their Thunder Barriers without being accompanied by an Electrograna will result in the active character being knockbacked.

Some are permanently disabled from collecting the resources inside the Thunder Barrier, while some will reactivate the Thunder Barrier after a period of time.

Being inside an active Thunder Barrier will deal {{Color|Electro DMG}} to the active character every 0.5 seconds. This DMG will ignore the character's {{Color|Electro RES}}, [[Defense]] and [[Damage Reduction]]. This DMG will not go through [[Shields]], but will still apply Electro to the active character.
