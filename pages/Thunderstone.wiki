'''Thunderstones''' are rocks within some [[Thunder Barrier]]s that inflict {{Color|True Electro DMG}} over time. They can be temporarily disabled by approaching them with an [[Electrogranum]], which are also needed to pass through their Thunder Barriers.

Some can be permanently disabled by collecting the resources inside the Thunder Barrier, while others will reactivate the Thunder Barrier after a period of time.

Being inside an active Thunder Barrier will deal {{Color|Electro DMG}} to the active character every 0.5 seconds. This DMG will ignore the character's {{Color|Electro RES}}, [[Defense]], and [[Damage Reduction]]. This DMG will not go through [[Shields]], but will still apply {{Color|Electro}} to the active character. Holding an Electrogranum will negate both the damage and {{Color|Electro}} application.
