You immediately understood what I meant, right?

But I'm in such a delicate situation that I don't have the appetite for dinner. You see, I can't directly invite you as a guest, because you might think that I'm expecting a gift!

We just became friends, I don't want you to think that I'm someone who takes advantage of others' kindness.

Oh! How about this: you help me with this dilemma of wanting to see you but being afraid of offending you, and I'll help you with a puzzle you want to solve.

If one puzzle isn't enough for you... Let's say two puzzles, because I would like you to gain from this exchange.

Hey now, don't just look stunned after reading this! You know where to find me.
