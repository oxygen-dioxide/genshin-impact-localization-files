==Descriptions==
{{Description|A soft-bodied animal that emits a gentle light. Often found climbing the walls of buildings near the water or underwater.<br>Though the weak light they give off is often ignored by divers, these small soft-bodied animals have the remarkable ability to consume and degrade industrial waste present in the water. It is said that reseachers once wished to give the Lumitoile the title of "Honorary Ecological Engineer" but the proposal was rejected by the Senior Technician at the time (who also held the post of Honorary Marine Ecology Research Engineer).|[[Archive]]}}
