The '''Unknown God''' is the mysterious god responsible for separating the [[Traveler]] from their [[Traveler's Sibling|sibling]] at the start of ''[[Genshin Impact]]''.

She appears in the opening cutscene in which the Traveler tells [[Paimon]] how they ended up stranded in [[Teyvat]].

==Story==
When the Traveler and their sibling attempted to leave Teyvat, the unknown god blocked their path. Calling herself the "<!-- intentionally uncapitalized to match the only instance of this phrase in-game: during the quest Wanderer's Trail -->sustainer of [[Heavenly Principles|heavenly principles]]," she denounced the "arrogation of mankind," and engaged the twins in battle. She summons swarms of dark red cubes to attack them (similar to the dark red cubes that ravaged [[Khaenri'ah]]<ref name="WWBR">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/SO__VQZirJ4 Genshin Impact Story Teaser We Will Be Reunited (Contains spoilers)]</ref>), and upon trapping them, engulfs the twins individually within her cubes.

Upon being completely engulfed by her powers, the Traveler fell into a deep sleep and experienced countless nightmares.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Traveler|1}}</ref> Once they awoke five hundred years later, their powers had been sealed away and they found no trace of their sibling.

Unbeknownst to the Traveler, their sibling had also awoken from the Unknown God's imprisonment at some point and eventually became the leader of the [[Abyss Order]] shortly before the Traveler's arrival in Mondstadt.<ref name="WWBR" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Long Shot}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*The Unknown God bears a striking resemblance to [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Kiana Kaslana|Kiana Kaslana]] as the [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Herrscher of the Void|Herrscher of the Void]], who comes from another HoYoverse game, ''{{w|Honkai Impact 3rd}}''.
**The two also share the same Chinese and Japanese voice actresses.
**They both have the four-pointed symbol from the portal that The Unknown God uses.
** The connection between the Unknown God and Kiana Kaslana was hinted during a program held on March 18, 2020, for the second Closed Beta Test of ''Genshin Impact''.<ref>Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1i7411R7Rp  原神 再临测试 官方直播]</ref> The program was hosted by Wei Liu and combat designer Aquaria.<br /><br />'''Aquaria:''' {{Lang|zh=这位神明在我们看起来，米哈游的小伙伴们都会感受到一股亲切感。这位神明感觉会有种「似曾相识」的感觉。|zh_tl=[Players of miHoYo games] will feel as though this god is a familiar face, as though you've somehow met before.|mini=1}}<br />'''Wei Liu:''' {{Lang|zh=那她到底跟大家的心目中的「似曾相识」的角色之间有什么样的关系呢？那么，还请大家去我们这个《原神》里面亲自去感受。|zh_tl=As to the relationship that exists between her and the "character you've met before" everyone is thinking of, please experience it for yourself in ''Genshin Impact''.|mini=1}}<br />'''Aquaria:''' {{Lang|zh=这一点还是有劳我们的《原神》的粉丝和原学家们去挖掘了。|zh_tl= This point will be up to the ''Genshin Impact'' fans and lore enthusiasts to explore.|mini=1}}

*She appears to be spiteful towards mortals, mentioning "the arrogation of mankind." The word "{{wt|arrogation}}" means "unjust assumption of privileges," though what exactly she meant by this line is currently left ambiguous.
**In the original Chinese text, she says {{Lang|mini=1|zh=在此终结「人之子」的僭越|zh_tl=The overstepping (usurpation) by the 'Child(ren) of Human(s)' ends here}}. It is unclear whether she is referring to a single character or speaking about humanity in general, as the term {{Lang|mini=1|zh=人之子}} on its own does not specify singular or plural.
*The Unknown God shares voice actresses with multiple characters across the various voiceover languages:
** In Chinese, she shares a voice actress with [[Hu Tao]], Dian Tao.
** In English, [[Qiqi]] and the Unknown God are both voiced by Christie Cate.
*The Unknown God's portals are shaped like [[Symbols in Teyvat#Four-Pointed Star|four-pointed stars]], a common motif in ''Genshin Impact''.
