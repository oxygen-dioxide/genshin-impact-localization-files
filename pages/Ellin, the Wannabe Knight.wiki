'''Ellin, the Wannabe Knight''' is a repeatable daily [[commission]] in [[Mondstadt]].

This commission may be a follow-up of [[The Limitations of an Adventurer]]. If Herman received a broken dummy from the previous day, Ellin will reference it and her dummy will be the makeshift repaired one.

==Steps==
#Talk to [[Ellin]]
#Destroy all the training dummies in under 2 seconds
#Report back to Ellin

==Notes==
* This quest can come in four forms:
** 5 dummies in a line.
** 5 dummies in a large semi-circle, with a brazier in the middle.
** 5 dummies in a smaller semi-circle
** 6 dummies split into two groups.
* The two-second counter does not start until a dummy is destroyed.
* Strategies for defeating the dummies:
** Knock each dummy's HP low without defeating it, then use [[Elemental Reactions]] (like [[Overloaded]] or [[Swirl]]) or a [[Claymore]] character's spinning Charged Attack to defeat them all at once.
** Use the nearby [[Teleport Waypoint]] (on the tower) to do a plunging attack.
** For the brazier version, use [[Elements|Pyro]] to light the brazier, then hit it with any source of Electro. Overload will hit all the dummies at once, and can be repeated as needed.
** For the version with 6 dummies, there are several solutions.
*** Use [[Anemo Traveler]]'s [[Gust Surge]].
*** Use [[Xiangling]]'s [[Pyronado]].
*** Use two charges of [[Sucrose]]'s [[Astable Anemohypostasis Creation - 6308|Elemental Skill]] in immediate succession.
*** Drop [[Amber]]'s [[Explosive Puppet]] near one dummy group as a delayed attack, then use a different character to destroy the other group once the bunny explodes.
*** While standing at the center of one dummy group, use [[Ganyu]]'s Level 2 Charged Attack to destroy the opposite dummy group, immediately followed by her [[Trail of the Qilin|Elemental Skill]].
**Destroying a dummy starts the 2 second timer, so if all the dummies are damaged to about 1/10th of its HP, a plunging attack from the top of the tower, and aiming towards the middle will destroy all the dummies.
* If the player destroys the dummy next to Ellin, she will express anger at the player. (This does not affect the quest)
** The dummy only spawns if the commission "The Limitations of an Adventurer" was completed from the previous day.

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Ellin is working hard to become a knight, but her training doesn't seem to work out. She seems to need some guidance...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Ellin)
:'''Ellin:''' Ugh, what a headache... What am I supposed to do about this?
:{{DIcon|Quest}} What are you up to?
:'''Ellin:''' Practicing for the [[Knights of Favonius]]' tryouts!
:'''Ellin:''' *sigh* But I'm nowhere near as powerful as Jean.
:'''Ellin:''' I think it's better for me to focus on technique rather than power.
:'''Ellin:''' For example, I was thinking about how to break all these wooden dummies in one fell swoop...
:;(If the player retrieved an [[Intact Training Dummy]] during "The Limitations of an Adventurer")
::'''Ellin:''' They're a lot more robust than they look, this is no trivial task... I don't know where my father managed to get them from, but he must have gone to a lot of effort.
:;(If the player retrieved [[Materials for Training Dummy]] instead)
::'''Ellin:''' I know they don't look that robust, but they're what I've got. My father went to a lot of trouble to get them for me, so I shouldn't complain.
:;(Neither line will play if the player did not complete "The Limitations of an Adventurer" on the previous day.)
:'''Ellin:''' If you're at a loose end, fancy helping me think about how to tackle it?
:{{DIcon}}  I'll mull it over.
::'''Ellin:''' Sure, take your time. It's not like these dummies are going anywhere.
::'''Ellin:''' Nor is my life going anywhere while I'm stuck trying to sort this out, ugh...
:{{DIcon}} How about we give it a go together...
::'''Ellin:''' You like team combat, then? Alright for some... always someone to help you out.
::'''Ellin:''' For people like me, the best I can do is try and hold my own as a lone fighter.
; After either choice, Ellin gives a tip based on the training dummy layout{{colon}}
; (In the line layout or the layout with 2 groups)
:'''Ellin:''' At this distance, maybe the best solution would be for me to deal with one side and drop a bomb to deal with the other side.
:'''Ellin:''' Haha, just kidding. I have no idea where I would even get a bomb from anyway.
; (In the semi-circle layout with a brazier)
:'''Ellin:''' I've heard that the elements interact in special ways. I wonder if there's a way we can use the fire on this brazier to cause a little explosion...
:'''Ellin:''' But first there needs to actually be a fire in the brazier...
; (In the semi-circle layout without a brazier)
: '''Ellin:''' If only I had a bigger weapon, or some powerful elemental ability like Jean, breaking all these wooden dummies would probably be a piece of cake.

;(Talk to Ellin again)
:'''Ellin:''' How are you getting along? Had a eureka moment yet?
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Still thinking it over...
:'''Ellin:''' Huh. I've met a few other adventurers before. They were the same way.
:'''Ellin:''' They fight monsters like pros, but they're hopelessly lost when it comes to trying to break a few wooden sticks.
:'''Ellin:''' And they reinforce the wood like it's for building a storm shelter or something... Way overestimating their own strength.
:'''Ellin:''' If they want a challenge so desperately, why don't they just go off into the wilderness and pick a fight with the biggest monster they can find?

;(Dummies spawn)
:{{A|vo wdlq001 6 ellin 01.ogg}} '''Ellin''': How can I smash all these training dummies at once?

;(If you fail to defeat them all within 2 seconds)
:{{A|vo wdlq001 6 ellin 02.ogg}} '''Ellin''': Shame, didn't manage to smash them all in time. Well, if at first you don't succeed...
:;(Dummies respawn)

;(Upon successfully defeating them)
:{{A|vo wdlq001 6 ellin 03.ogg}} '''Ellin''': Huh, so THAT's how you do it. I'm impressed!

;(Talk to Ellin)
:'''Ellin:''' Nailed it!
:'''Ellin:''' Huh, I never even thought of trying that...
:'''Ellin:''' Thanks! I'm gonna try it myself now.
----
;(If the player destroys the dummy next to Ellin, then talks to her after completing the commission)
:'''Ellin:''' HEY! What are you DOING!? My dad gave that to me to practice with!
:'''Ellin:''' If I don't make it through the Knights of Favonius tryouts, YOU will be the one to blame!
