|text1    = A strange life form that shares nothing in common with any other land-dwelling creature. In battle, it will enter a stressed state and unleash a fierce Stonefall attack while under the protection of a {{Color|help|Geo}} shield. If the shield is broken during this period, it will cause the life form to fall into a paralyzed state. Aside from the usual methods of using {{Color|help|Elemental Reactions}}, attacks imbued with {{Color|help|ousia or pneuma}} can also efficiently pierce the defenses of the Breacher Primus.
