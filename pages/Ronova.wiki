'''Ronova''' is the Ruler of Death among the [[Four Shades]] of the [[Heavenly Principles]].<ref name="BtSS">{{Ref/Quest|Beneath the Secret Source}}</ref> 

Ronova was first mentioned in the {{Quest|Echoes of Life}} and later in <!--{{Quest|-->''[[As One We Watch the Setting Sun]]''<!--}}-->. She makes her first physical appearance in the {{Quest|When All Becomes a Monument}}.

==Profile==
Ronova helped [[Natlan]] establish the rules and gave guidance to [[Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night]], in creating the [[Night Kingdom]]. She had done this out of an expression of love and act of reparation, but these actions were considered to be overstepping her authorities as a Shade and it displeased the Heavenly Principles.<ref name="BtSS"/>

===Appearance===
Although Ronova's personal form remains unseen, some of her attributes can be discerned through the technique she employs to observe Teyvat.<ref name="When All Becomes a Monument">{{Ref/Quest|When All Becomes a Monument}}</ref> The Ruler of Death utilizes a crimson-red rift in the skies of Teyvat to gaze upon the world below. From this rift, Ronova manifests six eyes—two positioned to her right, three to her left, and a larger central eye. It can be reasonably assumed that the crimson energy forming this rift is a manifestation of Ronova's power.

==Story==
===History===
After the arrival of the first throne of the heavens, the Heavenly Principles appeared and fought against the [[Seven Sovereigns]] of the old world. To that end, it created Four Shades of itself, one of which was Ronova. 40 years after the Heavenly Principles's appearance, the Seven Sovereigns were vanquished and the seven nations submitted to its authority. Ronova may have contributed to the new world the Heavenly Principles made.<ref name="Before Sun and Moon">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2|Before Sun and Moon}}</ref>

Following the arrival of the [[Second Who Came]] and the ensuing catastrophe, Ronova presumably participated in the war on the Heavenly Principles's side against the Second Who Came and the ancient [[dragons]]. Amidst the widespread devastation that accompanied this conflict, the region that would later be known as [[Natlan]] suffered extensive ruin, with its [[Ley Lines]] sustaining severe damage. In the aftermath of the war, Ronova instructed the Lord of the Night with the task of reconstructing the Ley Lines, an endeavor realized through the establishment of the Night Kingdom. However, this would greatly displease the Heavenly Principles, who regarded it as an overreach of her authority. Confronted with their censure, Ronova "succumbed to self-pity," displaying increasing indifference to the fate of the land.<ref name="BtSS"/>

After [[Xbalanque]] ascended and became the first [[Pyro Archon]], he used the divine throne to borrow Ronova's powers and establish the rules of Natlan, a framework which allows ordinary humans to become Pyro Archons through the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]]. Those who ascend are then granted knowledge and memories of the land through the [[Sacred Flame]].<ref name=":0">{{Ref/Quest|Echoes of Life}}</ref> The two came to an agreement that those who used Ronova's powers would eventually die, and if the Heavenly Principles were to find out, she would simply deny involvement and claim that her powers were stolen. Xbalanque also asked to be given a chance to see Natlan's future should its people prevail over the Abyss, which she agreed to.

During the [[cataclysm]], the Ruler of Death cursed the full-blooded [[Khaenri'ahns]] with immortality, leaving them to rot and suffer. According to [[Capitano]], Ronova made no distinction in whom she cursed despite the fact that the [[Five Sinners of Khaenri'ah]] and the [[Irmin|Vinster King]] were the primary culprits responsible for the calamity.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|For the Same Land}}</ref><ref name="When All Becomes a Monument">{{Ref/Quest|When All Becomes a Monument}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Item|Wings of Fate's Course Intertwined}}</ref>

===Present Day===
{{Main|When All Becomes a Monument|Hearken, Ye Who Have Returned}}
After [[Mavuika]] used Ronova's powers to thwart [[Gosoythoth]]'s abyssal invasion, Ronova demanded Mavuika's life as payment to fulfill their pact. However, the Lord of the Night and The Captain had agreed to have Il Capitano offer his life instead, intending to exploit the Curse of Immortality imposed upon him by Ronova. This would create a paradox and allow him to obtain vengeance against Ronova for the suffering inflicted upon innocent Khaenri'ahns, including himself, by forcing Ronova to break one of her own rules. Ultimately, Ronova elected to continue upholding the Curse of Immortality, resulting in Yohualtecuhtin gaining eternal life as The Captain's life force was transferred to the Lord of the Night.<ref name="When All Becomes a Monument" />

Due to the Natlanese winning the war, Ronova honored her bet with Xbalanque and allowed him to see present-day Natlan. Xbalanque decided to stay for a single day in [[Mausau]]'s body, and offered Mavuika the rest of his life force that the Shade had given him as payment for their duel, to allow her to bring her loved ones back temporarily in his place &mdash; an offer she declined.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Hearken, Ye Who Have Returned}}</ref>

==Trivia==
<!--
* It is possible that Ronova is the same person as the "lady of the golden hall" referred to by the [["Boatman"]] in [["Boatman"'s Task]].
* It is possible that Ronova is the same female figure who gave [[Kapatcir]] her original name.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna}}</ref> This hypothesis aligns with the prominence of [[Plume of Death|feather symbolism]] both in Natlan and [[Tsurumi Island]].<ref>{{Ref/Item|Ancient Name}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Item|Peculiar Pinion}}</ref> Such a connection between Ronova and Kapatcir is further reinforced by what can be observed through the [[Ruler of Life]]'s creation of [[Egeria]], with both being symbolized by [[Flower of Life|flowers]], in addition to the visual correlations between [[Oceanid]]s and [[Thunder Manifestation]]s.
** In {{w|Kamuy|Ainu mythology}}, the god of thunder and lightning, Kanna Kamuy, is said to have descended from the heavens accompanied by a female goddess known as {{w|Kamuy-huci|Apemerukoyan-mat Unamerukoyan-mat}}, or Kamuy-huci (カムイフチ, ''Kamui Fuchi''). Kamuy-huci is the goddess of the hearth, where the hearth was particularly seen as the abode of the dead in Ainu traditions. This is noteworthy due to the significance of Ronova's involvement with the [[Pyro Archon]] and the [[Sacred Flame]]. The aforementioned details further support Ronova's connection to Kanna Kapatcir.
* As alluded to by [[Dainsleif]],<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/bpgZ5oDTztY?t=338 ''Collected Miscellany - "Arlecchino: Afterglow of Calamity"''] (Timestamp: 338s)<br>''"When a blood-red moon shines down from above, some see the face of death, while others see the roof over their heads."''</ref> Ronova may be behind the crimson Balemoon's eye seen by [[Perinheri]] and [[Arlecchino|Peruere]]. Perinheri sees this red eye only after declaring himself dead to the [[House of the Hearth]], and Arlecchino describes it as "filled with death."<ref>{{Ref/Companion|Arlecchino}}</ref>
* Furthermore, Ronova shares a number of visual and thematic motifs with Arlecchino: 
**Ronova and Arlecchino both display a burning crimson cross in their eyes—Arlecchino's pupils are cross-shaped, and a similar pattern appears in Ronova's "eye." Crossed eyes are commonly used to signify deceased individuals.
** During her attack "[[The Knave#Phase_2_2|Destruction Upon Destruction]]," [[The Knave]] transforms her spider appendages into six angelic wings, each with an eye, matching the six eyes Ronova uses to observe Teyvat. Similarly, Arlecchino's outfit, [[Moonglare]], features six ocular ornaments, which become six eyes on The Knave's appendages in Phase 2.
** Arlecchino's flames, seen in her talents and boss fight, resemble the effects in Ronova's eye. Her {{Pyro}} conversion during [[Invitation to a Beheading|Normal Attacks]], using these flames, is aptly named "Masque of the Red Death."
** Arlecchino ranks 4th among the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers|Fatui Harbingers]], a number considered unlucky in China due to its pronunciation being nearly identical to "death."<ref>Wikipedia: {{w|Chinese numerology#Four|Number 4 in Chinese numerology}}</ref>
** The feather motifs on Arlecchino's outfit and The Knave's item drop, [[Silken Feather]]'','' may link her to Ronova through the Plume of Death.

===Etymology===
* "Ronova" is likely derived from {{w|Ronove}}, a Marquis and Great Earl of Hell, ranked 27th in the {{w|The Lesser Key of Solomon#Ars Goetia|Ars Goetia}}. Ronove is described as a taker of old souls, who often comes to Earth to harvest souls of decrepit humans and animals near death.
