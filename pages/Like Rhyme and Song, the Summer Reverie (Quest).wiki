;(Approach the Fatui machine)
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, look! Isn't that the same guy we saw on our first day here?
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 persikov 01.ogg}} '''[[Persikov|Researcher]]:''' Ahaha... *hic* Everyone's gone crazy. Everyone should get out of here!
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 persikov 02.ogg}} '''Researcher:''' We'll... We'll never wake up... But I was right, my precious, you are invincible... hehe...
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 xinyan 01.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Precious? What's his precious?
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 persikov 03.ogg}} '''Researcher:''' A miracle machine... Definitely not... impossible... *hic*!
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 mona 01.ogg}} '''Mona:''' I think he's referring to that machine.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 fischl 01.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' What a drunkard, hmph.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 oz 01.ogg}} '''Oz:''' Oh goodness, the smell of alcohol... Mein Fräulein, please allow me to fan the fumes away with my wings.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 mona 02.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Excellent, please fan them away for me, too.
:{{DIcon}} Me as well.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 oz 02.ogg}} '''Oz:''' Certainly.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I've checked the surroundings, but there's no one else here.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Isn't that strange? The Fatui is a big organization, but he is the only one left at this camp. What's more, we didn't even see him the last time we were here.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 03.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Even the larger gentleman from the first time is missing. I think... they must be hiding somewhere.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 04.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' As for why they may be hiding, I'm afraid we'll have to ask him.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But he's as drunk as Tone-Deaf Bard... Should we wait for him to sober up?
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 fischl 02.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Cleanse him with the holy spring of punishment!
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 oz 03.ogg}} '''Oz:''' Mein Fräulein means to splash him with water.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds like a good idea. Let's try!
:{{Black Screen|Everyone takes out their water bottles and empties them over the collapsed Fatui researcher...}}
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, he opened his eyes!
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 persikov 04.ogg}} '''Researcher:''' Hm... Huh?
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 mona 03.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Hey, are you one of the Fatui? Can you tell us what happened here and what that machine is for?
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 persikov 05.ogg}} '''Researcher:''' ...F&mdash;Fatui...
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 persikov 06.ogg}} '''Researcher:''' ...Hah! Fatui!
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 persikov 07.ogg}} '''Researcher:''' Oh... those blockheads from the administration will regret it now! Haha! That's what you get for rejecting my research and forcing me to...
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 persikov 08.ogg}} '''Researcher:''' Forcing me to... to conduct my research on this deserted island... My precious! My precious... *sobs*
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why is he crying? Looks like he has a lot of pent-up emotions...
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 persikov 09.ogg}} '''Researcher:''' ...You mocked me... and my precious invention! You... you don't know anything about the future.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 persikov 10.ogg}} '''Researcher:''' Only my invention... can help us conquer the world! Haha... hahaha...
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 persikov 11.ogg}} '''Researcher:''' Idiots, such idiots, hahaha...
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 persikov 12.ogg}} '''Researcher:''' Ow! Don't hit me! I won't blow up the lab again... I'm sorry! I didn't mean to...
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 xinyan 02.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' This man's gone insane. There's no way we can communicate with him.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 05.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' He wasn't like this when we first met him. It looks like the effects have grown worse, to the point of driving him mad.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 persikov 13.ogg}} '''Researcher:''' *sobs*... My manuscript, my manuscript! Only that... can save... save... *sobs*
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 fischl 03.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Manuscript? Where is it?
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 persikov 14.ogg}} '''Researcher:''' Don't yell at me, don't yell at me... *sobs*
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Fischl, don't yell at him!
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 fischl 04.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Hmph! Then I'll...
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 mona 04.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Let me try.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 mona 05.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Kind sir, look at me. Now tell me, where did you hide your manuscript?
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 persikov 15.ogg}} '''Researcher:''' *sobs* No, no, don't force me to write a report... *sobs* Go away...
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, he's completely lost in his own imagination...
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 06.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Allow me.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 07.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 08.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Please excuse me!
:{{Black Screen|Kazuha stands quietly for a while, then throws the researcher over his shoulder and onto the ground.}}
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 09.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Haah!
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 persikov 16.ogg}} '''Researcher:''' *sobs* Ow! My butt... *sobs* My brain is finally starting to work again... It's not a mushy mess anymore...
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 10.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Can you tell me where you put the manuscript?
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 persikov 17.ogg}} '''Researcher:''' The manuscript... the manuscript... is in the crack over there...
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 xinyan 03.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Whew, finally! Otherwise, I was gonna have to blast some of my loudest rock 'n' roll in his ears.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kazuha hesitated for a long time before making a move. He's so nice.
:{{DIcon}} Yup. He's destined for greatness.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 1 kazuha 11.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Everyone, let's search the stone cracks nearby for the manuscript.

;(Talk to [[Persikov]])
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (The researcher came to his senses briefly after Kazuha's throw, but soon fell unconscious...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Did his mental state deteriorate, or did Kazuha knock him out...?)

;(Interact with the manuscript)
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 fischl 01.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Found it!
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 oz 01.ogg}} '''Oz:''' Congratulations! We've found the key to solving the problem!
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 mona 01.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Let me see... Hmm...
:{{Black Screen|Mona takes the manuscript and studies it carefully...}}
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 mona 02.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Just as I thought. This machinery named "Cognitive Mimicry" is capable of altering the state of people's brains. It was invented by the researcher we met earlier, his name is Persikov.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 mona 03.ogg}} '''Mona:''' According to the manuscript, the Fatui officials did not support Persikov's research. They believed he had taken the wrong path.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 mona 04.ogg}} '''Mona:''' But Persikov insisted on putting his machine to use. In order to achieve that, he disassembled the machine and used his connections to transport the parts to this deserted island.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How did they find this island? The Fatui's intelligence network's not to be underestimated.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 mona 05.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Persikov was dead set on carrying out his experiments on this island. Most of his subjects were junior Fatui soldiers who all signed a waiver before the experiment.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 mona 06.ogg}} '''Mona:''' ...It looks like they really thought this machine would benefit the Fatui.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' How does the machine work?
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 mona 07.ogg}} '''Mona:''' That's most likely top-secret. The manuscript didn't reveal any details, but Persikov did mention that the machine was modeled after the power of a god.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 mona 08.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Does that mean... there's a god connected to these dream-like mirages, and the Fatui found a way to research it?
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 fischl 02.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Clearly. Otherwise, they wouldn't have been able to reproduce the god's power.
:{{DIcon}} (Wait, so there's some sort of... Mirage Archon?)
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 mona 09.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Anyway, Persikov's experiment did not go as planned. The machine broke down just days after it was activated. They tried to fix it, but...
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 mona 10.ogg}} '''Mona:''' The technologically illiterate Fatui soldiers completely ruined the machine. Even its most important component of all &mdash; the crystalline cores &mdash; got ejected and disappeared.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 oz 02.ogg}} '''Oz:''' A testament to the importance of maintenance in all aspects of life. I believe we can all learn something from this.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 mona 11.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Persikov may be a mad scientist, but he didn't want to see his subordinates suffer. Besides, if he didn't solve the problem, he would end up going insane as well.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 mona 12.ogg}} '''Mona:''' As a last resort, Persikov went out on his own to look for the cores. But he was just a sickly researcher unfit for the task. He had to give up.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 mona 13.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Then, Persikov went searching for the soldiers who had gone mad and strayed from the group, and took them to a hidden cave.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I think that was where they were at the day we arrived on this island. Persikov was taking a strong Fatui soldier somewhere.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 mona 14.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Yes. It took Persikov all of his strength to get all the missing soldiers into the cave. He tried to snap them out of it with music and poetry...
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 mona 15.ogg}} '''Mona:''' But nothing worked.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 xinyan 01.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' We came here once but there was no one around. Come to think of it, that must've been the day Persikov was busy gathering the soldiers into the cave.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 mona 16.ogg}} '''Mona:''' There's good news and bad news written on the last few pages.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 mona 17.ogg}} '''Mona:''' The good news is, Persikov managed to figure out the location of the crystalline cores by piecing together the snippets of information he could get from the delirious soldiers...
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 mona 18.ogg}} '''Mona:''' The bad news is, Persikov failed to revive them, and eventually succumbed to the device's influence himself. The last few pages of the manuscript are just unintelligible drunken scribbles.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 fischl 03.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' It appears that the responsibility for this issue now falls to my retainers and I.
:{{DIcon}} Never thought we'd be saving the day on a vacation...
:{{DIcon}} I feel a sense of purpose.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 mona 19.ogg}} '''Mona:''' There's a map in the manuscript. The markings should indicate the locations of the crystalline cores.
;(Open [[Persikov's Manuscript]])
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've got no choice but to find the crystalline cores now!
;(Obtain {{Item|Persikov's Manuscript}})

{{Quest Description|update|To find out the truth, everyone returns to the location of the mysterious machine to investigate. There, they find Persikov's manuscript. Open your Inventory and check Persikov's manuscript to obtain the clues to finding the Crystalline Cores.}}

;(Obtaining the first core)
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This should be one of the crystalline cores mentioned in the manuscript!

;(Obtaining the second core)
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And here's the second one.

;(Obtaining the third core)
:{{A|vo yqeq114 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've found all the crystalline cores. Let's put them back into the machine!

----
{{Quest Description|update|To find out the truth, everyone returns to the location of the mysterious machine to investigate. There, they find Persikov's manuscript...}}

;(Insert the cores into the machines)
:{{A|vo yqeq114 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've inserted all the crystalline cores. Mona, is that all we needed to do?
:{{A|vo yqeq114 3 mona 01.ogg}} '''Mona:''' I think so. That's what the manuscript says anyway.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 3 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Let's give it some time. Hopefully, it'll return to normal.
:{{Black Screen|Everyone sits around the campfire, chatting and cooking barbecue.}}
:{{Black Screen|Once the machine is fixed, the situation seems to improve. Soon, you hear footsteps approaching...}}
:{{A|vo yqeq114 3 skirmishera 01.ogg}} '''Fatui Sergeant:''' Aah! Someone's in our camp!
:{{A|vo yqeq114 3 skirmisherb 01.ogg}} '''Fatui Recruit:''' Hey, who are you people!?
:{{A|vo yqeq114 3 skirmishera 02.ogg}} '''Fatui Sergeant:''' Hold on, look at the machine... is it fixed?
:{{A|vo yqeq114 3 skirmisherb 02.ogg}} '''Fatui Recruit:''' What? But Mr. Persikov is still lying on the ground over there.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're the ones who fixed the device. Yeah, you're welcome!
:{{A|vo yqeq114 3 mona 02.ogg}} '''Mona:''' We could have had a nice, relaxing vacation, if all of this hadn't ended up occupying so much of our time.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 3 fischl 01.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Hmph! Apologize to me and my retainers at once!
:{{A|vo yqeq114 3 skirmishera 03.ogg}} '''Fatui Sergeant:''' Huh!? Oh no, oh no, I&mdash;I'm outta here...
:{{A|vo yqeq114 3 skirmisherb 03.ogg}} '''Fatui Recruit:''' Hey, hey! Don't leave me here on my own... Mr. Persikov's still there, we need to save him!
:{{A|vo yqeq114 3 xinyan 01.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Haha, those two definitely seem a little more lucid now.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 3 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' It looks like we succeeded.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yay! Let's get outta here then. Paimon wants to spend the rest of this vacation back at our own camp.
:{{DIcon}} You mean Klee's camp.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! But it feels like our camp now, kinda like our temporary home, hehe.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 3 oz 01.ogg}} '''Oz:''' Then perhaps we should call it the Embassy of the Immernachtreich and Dodoland.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? No! That's too many words. Paimon would prefer something easy to remember.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Come on, let's go home now.

----
;(Return to the camp)
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *yawn* Whew! After coming home to a nice big meal then having a long lie down, Paimon's finally starting to feel relaxed.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 fischl 01.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Hehe, is the hospitality of the Immernachtreich to thy liking?
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's loving it!
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 oz 01.ogg}} '''Oz:''' Wonderful. Mein Fräulein invited you all here not only to witness the arrival of our Holy Land, but most importantly, she wished that you could all relax and enjoy the summer.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 xinyan 01.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Great! Well, I've come to the right place &mdash; I love it here!
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 fischl 02.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' May this place become an eternal paradise.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 oz 02.ogg}} '''Oz:''' Mein Fräulein says she hopes to go on more adventures with you here in the future.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 xinyan 02.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Of course! And you should come find me in Liyue when you get the time. I'll show you around.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 xinyan 03.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Oh, also, my friend runs the best restaurant in Liyue. I'm sure you'll love it.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 xinyan 04.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' If you're into opera, you should go see Yun Jin. She's the nicest person, and she likes making friends with new and interesting people. I'm sure the two of you will have plenty to talk about with your shared passion for theatrics.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 fischl 03.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Oh? If Lady Xinyan speaks so highly of it, then I must entertain the idea.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' {{Traveler}}, I have a suggestion.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' There is a snack called Roasted Lavender Melon in Inazuma, which goes rather well with fish. Why don't we roast some fruit and seafood for dinner tonight?
:{{DIcon}} Okie dokie!
::{{A|vo yqeq114 4 kazuha 03a.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Then it's decided. I'll go gather some more fruit. And for seasoning... Yup, that should do it.
:{{DIcon}} Roasted Lavender Melon sounds great. I've tried it before!
::{{A|vo yqeq114 4 kazuha 03b.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Oh? Did you try it in Inazuma?
::{{DIcon}} A few Inazuman friends made some for me.
::{{A|vo yqeq114 4 kazuha 03b 1.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Haha, that's great.
::{{A|vo yqeq114 4 kazuha 03b 2.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' You know, I want to follow your example and travel around the world. Hopefully, I can also make good friends along the way.
::{{DIcon}} Knowing you, that shouldn't be a problem.
::{{A|vo yqeq114 4 kazuha 03b 3.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' That means a lot coming from you, {{Traveler}}.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 mona 01.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Ah, you're all here.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 mona 02.ogg}} '''Mona:''' I've noticed an issue. Although we've fixed the machine, as you can see &mdash; the mirages on the islands have still not disappeared.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 kazuha 04.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I've noticed that, too. But considering it took some time for the mirages to appear, it may also take some time for them to disappear.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 mona 03.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Yes, that's definitely possible.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 mona 04.ogg}} '''Mona:''' In other news, my scryglass seems to be working fine now. The divination results are also looking about right, although...
:{{DIcon}} Although what?
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 mona 05.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Although there are some parts in the results that I don't quite understand... it's as if there is some sort of power surrounding us, and it's still watching us.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 kazuha 05.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Do you think it's caused by the machine, or perhaps Persikov?
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 mona 06.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Sorry, I'm also not sure. All I know is that the power is not hostile at the moment. Whatever it is, it doesn't seem to harbor any ill will toward us.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (That reminds me, there's one unanswered question on these islands. But the group is unaware.)
:{{DIcon}} I'll keep that in mind.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 mona 07.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Well, although there's nothing left to disturb us, and we can finally kick back and enjoy our vacation, we still ought to be cautious while we're on these islands.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 mona 08.ogg}} '''Mona:''' I will keep seeing what the stars say every day.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 kazuha 06.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I promised Fischl that I'd be her guard. I can help.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 mona 09.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Good, I'll be counting on you.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 mona 10.ogg}} '''Mona:''' ...*sigh* Goodness knows why those girls are so carefree about everything. I suppose it falls to me to be extra vigilant.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, come with me!
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, coming!
:{{DIcon}} Let's go over there.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohh, so we're gonna call the Tone-Deaf Bard, right?
:'''Dodocommunication Device:''' Dodoco! Dodoco!
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Well hello there, strangers! You finally called! I thought you were having so much fun that you'd completely forgotten about me.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nope! Tone-Deaf Bard, a whole bunch of really strange things happened!
:{{Black Screen|You tell Venti everything that has happened on the islands over the past few days...}}
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' A strange machine that can imitate the power of a God? Wow, haha, I didn't know the Fatui had plans like that. Their imaginations are truly running wild.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So judging from your tone, it sounds like you don't know any more about this than we do?
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Alas, I am but a humble bard who sings for his Mora in the tavern. Why would I know anything about it?
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, so annoying...
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' But, other than that, did you two have fun?
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We did! We ate a lot of yummy food and saw loads of amazing things. It was really cool!
:{{DIcon}} It was a great experience.
:{{DIcon}} Overall, I'd say it was pretty satisfying.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hehe, that's good.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' The point of traveling is to record any feelings stirred along the way. As long as you had an unforgettable experience, this journey has served its purpose.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 venti 07.ogg}} '''Venti:''' As for the mysterious voice, although we don't know who it was, not only did she not harm you, she also helped you to gain a better understanding of each other, right?
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 venti 08.ogg}} '''Venti:''' If you look at it that way, maybe she meant you well. I mean, if she was able to intercept Alice's communication tool, I'm sure she's also plenty capable of attacking you.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, Tone-Deaf Bard is right...
:{{DIcon}} ...
::{{DIcon}} I understand.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 venti 09.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hahaha, I'm glad to bring you some peace of mind. Just enjoy your vacation to the fullest, and don't forget to tell me all about the marvelous mirages when you get back.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 venti 10.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I want to record all these beautiful memories, and turn them into ballads. Every summer will become an unforgettable song.
:{{DIcon}} It's a deal.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 venti 11.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Then I'll just wait for your return, {{Traveler}}. Happy vacationing!
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If Tone-Deaf Bard thinks it's okay, then maybe there's nothing to worry about.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' After all, Tone-Deaf Bard is still a god. We should probably trust him.
:{{DIcon}} Indeed.
:{{DIcon}} Meh, maybe.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's head back, we don't wanna keep everyone waiting.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hold on, didn't Fischl say earlier that she's going to catch some crabs? Paimon wants to go too!

:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 nahida 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Now you have solved the mystery... doesn't it make you feel happy, satisfied?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (That voice...!)
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 nahida 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Don't worry, I won't hurt you. I'm just a little bird that sometimes flies by these islands, and am now watching you from far, far away.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 nahida 03.ogg}} '''???:''' I just so happened to sense a power here that has something to do with me. I was curious, so I landed on the beach to quietly watch everything that took place on these islands.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 nahida 04.ogg}} '''???:''' ...It was fascinating. The ones who came here to work were so busy, and yet I still saw genuine smiles on their faces from time to time.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 nahida 05.ogg}} '''???:''' And then all of you arrived later on, bringing your glorious dreamscapes and wonderful willpower.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 nahida 06.ogg}} '''???:''' Your dreams are like the pure and delicate bubbles floating on the water. The more beautiful the illusion, the more it fascinates me.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 nahida 07.ogg}} '''???:''' I'm not able to travel myself, but I do admire free spirits like yourself. So I helped them design a little something for you all. I hope you liked it.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 nahida 08.ogg}} '''???:''' As I said, I don't have an agenda. I'm just a little bird. I stopped here to admire your lives &mdash; joys, sorrows, and all.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 nahida 09.ogg}} '''???:''' You are a special person, with a unique and brilliant glow. I decided to communicate with you in this way because I'm really curious about you.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 nahida 10.ogg}} '''???:''' There is no need to wonder about my name. Maybe one day in the future, we will meet in another place.
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 nahida 11.ogg}} '''???:''' When that time comes, I think you'll be able to recognize me. Hehe.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (The voice has faded... Was she directly speaking into my mind?)
:{{A|vo yqeq114 4 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, what are you doing? The crabs don't catch themselves!
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (...What did she mean...)
;(A Dendro symbol briefly appears in front of Traveler)

;(Talk to Kazuha near the Bonsai on Pudding Isle)
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' The sound of nature is so relaxing. There's nothing more to worry about...
:{{DIcon}} Do you want to chat?
::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 02a.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Sure. What's on your mind?
::{{DIcon}} About drinking...
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03a 1.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Ahem...
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03a 2.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' That was days ago. I'm surprised you still remember...
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03a 3.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Fine drinks belong in the same space as poetry and elegance. To lose myself like that in the tavern... it was truly humiliating.
::{{DIcon}} About your past...
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03b 1.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Right, about that. After these events, I suppose I've bid a formal farewell to my past.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03b 2.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Don't worry, I feel just as fine as I did during the times before. I am burdened by neither grief nor regret.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03b 3.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I appreciate these twists of fate from the bottom of my heart.
:::{{DIcon}} You're always so chill...
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03b 4.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Thank you. Can I take it as a compliment?
:::{{DIcon}} Certainly.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03b 5.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I'm so happy to have a friend like you.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03b 6.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Let's shift our focus back to the scenery in front of us and take a good look at the clouds and waves before we leave.
::{{DIcon}} About this vacation...
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03c 1.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' It's had its ups and downs, but ultimately, it's been quite rewarding.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03c 2.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' If Beidou and the crew ask me about our experiences, I suppose I'll tell them about the squirrel and the ship spirit... as for stories about my new friends, I'll keep them to myself.
:::{{DIcon}} That's good.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03c 3.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' The end of every journey marks the beginning of a new adventure. I'm sure this is a feeling you are most familiar with, {{Traveler}}.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03c 4.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' ...Keep moving forwards. That's the important thing.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 03c 5.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Just like you, I have a lot of hope for the future.
:{{DIcon}} I won't disturb you.
::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 kazuha 02b.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' You must be tired from the past few days. Take a well-deserved rest.

;(Talk to Xinyan beside Frozen Soul's Petal on top of Broken Isle)
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 01.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' I've got some new inspiration for a song...
:{{DIcon}} Do you want to chat?
::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 02a.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Sure, I'd love to.
::{{DIcon}} About friends...
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03a 1.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' I am going to share this adventure with my friends when I get back. Who knows, it may even give [[Yun Jin]] some new ideas for her opera.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03a 2.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' As for [[Xiangling]], I'm sure she'll come up with a bunch of suggestions the minute that anything cooking-related comes up.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03a 3.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' You know her, a true professional, she knows everything... Like how to make a good stew without a pot. That's something I'd like to learn from her...
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03a 4.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' I need to learn some new dishes before my new friends come to visit. Oh, and Roasted Lavender Melons is definitely gonna be one of them!
::{{DIcon}} About music...
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03b 1.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Are you a little disappointed that I didn't play any rock music back in my mirage?
:::{{DIcon}} Not at all.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03b 2.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Whew, glad to hear it.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03b 3.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Rock 'n' roll is my first love, that'll never change.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03b 4.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' But music is also a vehicle for all kinds of emotions. Rather than only expressing my own feelings, I figured what I did was more suitable for the occasion.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03b 5.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Hehe, perhaps now, I can call you a kindred spirit in our understanding of music.
::{{DIcon}} About this vacation...
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03c 1.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' It's been action-packed and awesome fun!
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03c 2.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' I really have to thank you and that bard fella for the invitation.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03c 3.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' I wonder how his live performances have been going... I owe him big time. I'll have to find a way to thank that guy in the future.
:::{{DIcon}} Let's buy him a drink.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 03c 4.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Sure! It's a deal!
:{{DIcon}} I won't disturb you.
::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 xinyan 02b.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Okay, make sure to take it easy.

:{{DIcon}} Do you want to chat?
::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 fischl 02a.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Why, certainly. I bestow upon thee permission to ask any questions.
::{{DIcon}} About Nachtraben Theater...
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 fischl 03a 1.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Oh? You have witnessed the theater of the Holy Land?
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 fischl 03a 2.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Alright, out with it, be liberal with your words of praise. It is a singular achievement in all the world.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 oz 01a.ogg}} '''Oz:''' Mein Fräulein eagerly anticipates your comments.
::{{DIcon}} About "Hymn of the Holy Land"...
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 fischl 03b 1.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' It is the sacred scripture of the Immernachtreich. It must never be allowed to fall into disrepair from a lack of upkeep...
:::{{DIcon}} I'll take good care of it.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 fischl 03b 2.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Hmph, you'd better.
:::{{A|vo yqeq114 4 oz 01b.ogg}} '''Oz:''' In mein Fräulein's mind, it is a treasured memento of this journey. She is positively thrilled to know that you also see it as such.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 fischl 03b 3.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Oz, do not over-interpret my speech!
::{{DIcon}} About this vacation...
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 fischl 03c 1.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' One was most delighted to behold the grand ceremony and celebration with which one's official excursion to this blessed land was received.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 fischl 03c 2.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Alas, my journey through countless worlds has taught me that even the most splendid of things must come to an end.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 fischl 03c 3.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' This is why I have declared to my people that my excursion goes on, as there are still attendants from faraway lands who require the Prinzessin's royal assistance.
:::{{A|vo yqeq114 4 oz 01c.ogg}} '''Oz:''' Mein Fräulein cried when she bade farewell to everyone.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 fischl 03c 4.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' Oz! I told you, that was only because an insolent grain of sand rudely took refuge in my eyes!
:{{DIcon}} I won't disturb you.
::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 fischl 02b.ogg}} '''Fischl:''' O, thou whose fate doth intersect with mine own, please enjoy thyself fully in this paradise.

:{{DIcon}} Do you want to chat?
::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 mona 02a.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Sure, is there something you wanted to ask me?
::{{DIcon}} About your scryglass...
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 mona 03a 1.ogg}} '''Mona:''' *sigh* It's really quite frustrating. Lately, my scryglass has been acting up whenever something major occurs.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 mona 03a 2.ogg}} '''Mona:''' ...It's as if it's deliberately trying to stop me from seeing how things will end.
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 mona 03a 3.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Hold on... I hope you didn't bring that up just to poke fun at me?
::{{DIcon}} About the starry sky...
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 mona 03b 1.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Oh, I actually wanted to ask you as well. How did you feel when you saw that stretch of sky?
:::{{DIcon}} It was magnificent!
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 mona 03b 2.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Oh... oh really?
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 mona 03b 3.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Well, I&mdash;I am a genius astrologist, after all. Of course my mirage was going to be magnificent...
:::{{DIcon}} That's the Mona I know!
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 mona 03b 4.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Hmm... But I was so immersed in my thoughts at the time, I didn't realize how magnificent until I heard you speak...
:::{{DIcon}} It was so spellbinding!
:::{{A|vo dialog yqeq114 mona 03b 5.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Yes, I know... It was on purpose, wasn't it?
::{{DIcon}} About this vacation...

==Trivia==
* After the quest ends, Venti can be found on the northeastern part of the island with Klee's camp, around the location where the Traveler ended this quest. (The area will need to be loaded again following the end of this quest.) He cannot be spoken to there. After a certain period of time, he will disappear from the area.
** Venti can still be found and spoken to on the roof of the [[Cat's Tail]].
