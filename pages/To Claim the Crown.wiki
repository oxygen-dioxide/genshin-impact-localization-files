{{Quest Description|Time passes by. You're not sure if Aarav has completed his investigation behind the kidnapping case and uncovered the truth yet...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon just heard that the matra have arrested some Eremites who snuck into the city. Maybe they were the ones plotting to kidnap Sachin?
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go to the Akademiya and check with Aarav!

;(Talk to Aarav)
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 1 aarav 01.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' Ah, you're here. Sorry, I was just about to send someone to inform you. I only just finished interrogating the suspects.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What did you find out?
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 1 aarav 02.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' Well... Lots of unexpected details, let's put it that way.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 1 aarav 03.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' The mercs themselves were surprisingly easy to catch. We just had someone dress up as [[Sachin]], and they took the bait.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 1 aarav 04.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' But then it starts to get messy... During the interrogation, we learned that they were hired by Sachin's own child.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? Why would someone wanna kidnap their own father? What's up with that?
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 1 aarav 05.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' It's anybody's guess at this point... In any event, apparently the guys we caught are just the tip of the iceberg. Most of them are still snooping around outside the city.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 1 aarav 06.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' We're diverting manpower as we speak to try and round them all up. Would you like to come along?
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure. Let's go get to the bottom of all this.
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|Aarav captured some sneaking mercenaries and discovered new revelations. More unbelievably, the mastermind behind the conspiracy to kidnap Sachin is his own child. Everyone decided then to proceed toward the campsite outside the city to get more details...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the camp)
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aarav, are you sure this is the right place? Something feels off...
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 aarav 01.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' I'm positive. But I don't understand why they're all unconscious on the ground...
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|Upon arriving at the camp you realize the mercenaries here have already been beaten badly. What happened here?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the Eremites)
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 liwar 01.ogg}} '''Levi:''' Boss, we got more company...
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 mazaar 01.ogg}} '''Mazaar:''' Look, we were just doing what we were paid to do. You're punishing the wrong people here. You want the real culprit? It's this guy. He hired us to kidnap Sachin.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 siwani 01.ogg}} '''???:''' ...
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What happened? Who beat you all up?
;(Aarav walks off-screen)
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 mazaar 02.ogg}} '''Mazaar:''' ...Wait, you mean you aren't with them?
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' With who? Who did this?
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 mazaar 03.ogg}} '''Mazaar:''' First there was this [[Wanderer|flying brat]]. Didn't bother asking any questions, just started throwing punches. After that, [[Alhaitham|some guy wearing green]] came along and interrogated us for a bit.
:;(Aarav returns)
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 aarav 02.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' I've got the confirmation I needed. This is the one who masterminded this whole plot &mdash; [[Jiwani]], Sachin's son.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 aarav 03.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' If you have any questions for him, now's your chance to ask them. When you're done, I'm arresting them all and taking them back to the Akademiya for further interrogation.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, why did you hire people to kidnap Sachin?
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 siwani 02.ogg}} '''Jiwani:''' Hmph. Why do you think? Twenty years ago, he upped and left to go and live a carefree life, not giving a second thought for my welfare.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 siwani 03.ogg}} '''Jiwani:''' As if that's not bad enough already, he went and put his entire fortune in the care of the Akademiya, along with a contract saying that one day he'd pass it all on to a genius he admired.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 siwani 04.ogg}} '''Jiwani:''' That's my inheritance, by rights! You expect me to sit back and watch it go to someone else? If he won't give me what's mine, I'll just have to take it from him.
:{{DIcon}} Were you seriously planning to...
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 siwani 05.ogg}} '''Jiwani:''' Of course! Didn't he say he would be here somewhere, watching the Championship from the shadows?
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 siwani 06.ogg}} '''Jiwani:''' So I figured I get some people to nab him, then I make him change the contract. And if the Akademiya doesn't agree to hand over the goods, I make him publicly announce that I'm his chosen genius!
:{{DIcon}} So did you find him?
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 siwani 07.ogg}} '''Jiwani:''' No. The old fart knows how to stay hidden, I'll give him that. He's probably cooped up somewhere watching all this go on and laughing to himself.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 siwani 08.ogg}} '''Jiwani:''' I already thought he'd gone mad twenty years ago. And who knows what a madman is truly capable of...
:{{DIcon}} What do you know about the [[Diadem of Knowledge]]?
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 siwani 09.ogg}} '''Jiwani:''' Diadem of Knowledge? You mean that thing he donated to the Akademiya?
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 siwani 10.ogg}} '''Jiwani:''' Well, I can tell you that it's very expensive. He sold a lot of assets to purchase it back in the day.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 siwani 11.ogg}} '''Jiwani:''' Weird things started happening after he brought it home, too. For example, sometimes, we'd hear a high-pitched voice coming from the storage room.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 siwani 12.ogg}} '''Jiwani:''' Also, before donating it to the Akademiya, he once shut himself in that same store room and researched it non-stop for days.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 siwani 13.ogg}} '''Jiwani:''' Something was already seriously wrong with him by that point. Nothing he did shocked me.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What do you mean, something wrong with him?
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 siwani 14.ogg}} '''Jiwani:''' I only have a vague memory of it, since I was very young at the time. But I have the impression that he went out into the desert for research, and didn't return for many years.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 siwani 15.ogg}} '''Jiwani:''' When he finally did return, he was a changed person &mdash; he would mumble incomprehensibly and write essays day and night.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 siwani 16.ogg}} '''Jiwani:''' I asked if I could see what he'd written, but he chased me out of the room. Later, he went out somewhere and took his written essays with him. When he got back, he signed his contract with the Akademiya.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 siwani 17.ogg}} '''Jiwani:''' ...Part of me wonders whether he'd already stopped being my father by that point. Perhaps the man we called "Sachin" was a demon from the desert who was wearing his skin.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, you can stop now! You're creeping Paimon out!
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 siwani 18.ogg}} '''Jiwani:''' You can believe me or not, doesn't matter to me &mdash; I've told you all I know. But if you do see Sachin, tell him this for me.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 siwani 19.ogg}} '''Jiwani:''' Whatever it is that he's researching out there, he'll always be garbage in my eyes.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 aarav 04.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' You finished? In that case, come with us.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 aarav 05.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' Well, we finally caught the guy behind all this. Thanks for providing us with the critical information.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 aarav 06.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' Do you still have any lingering concerns?
:{{DIcon}} The "Diadem of Knowledge"...
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, Alhaitham's notes do mention that item...
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 aarav 07.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' ...Scribe Alhaitham looked into this matter?
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 aarav 08.ogg}} '''Aarav:''' Hmm... Understood. Well, if you believe there to be an issue with the diadem, I'd suggest contacting the organizers and getting them to pause the competitions while we investigate.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That makes sense! Okay then, let's get back to the venue! We need to tell Kareena what's going on!
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|After hearing the information Jiwani provided and combining it with the notes left by Alhaitham, you feel like there's something suspicious about the Diadem of Knowledge being used as a prize... You should inform a member of staff as soon as possible.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Kareena)<!-- No ASTK -->
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kareena!
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 3 kareena 01.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Whew... You're finally back.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 3 kareena 02.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Where have you been? I looked everywhere for you... The third round's already started.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We were out capturing some bad guys who wanted to kidnap Sachin...
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But that's not important right now! We think there might be something wrong with the Diadem of Knowledge, and we'd like to investigate it!
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 3 kareena 03.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' The Diadem? That seems unlikely.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 3 kareena 04.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' The Diadem of Knowledge has been used in every Extravaganza over the last two decades, always without incident... Why has this come up now?
:{{DIcon}} Some new information has come to light.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 3 kareena 05.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Hmm. This is pretty serious. Let me think...
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 3 kareena 06.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Okay, here's the situation: The diadem is currently in [[Mawtiyima Forest]]. We moved it there before the third round began.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 3 kareena 07.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' In the third round, contestants have to go into Mawtiyima Forest, find the diadem, bring it back, and place it on the stand. The first person to do this gets 4 points.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 3 kareena 08.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Considering how close the scores are between our contestants, whoever wins this round is very likely to be the winner of the whole competition.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 3 kareena 09.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' As such, I suspect competition to be very fierce. You might not make it in time...
:{{DIcon}} We have to give it a shot.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 3 kareena 10.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' I'll mark the diadem's location for you. Please head there immediately. Let's hope nothing happens...
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright. Let's go!

;(After the dialogue)
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's weird... The locator's stopped working. Is the forest interfering with it? Ugh, let's just go grab the diadem!

;(Talk to Kareena again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xyjeq004 kareena 01.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Why this year...
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|You find out from Kareena that the Diadem of Knowledge was something that was meant to be competed over in the third round. Considering the danger the diadem poses, it's best to claim it before anyone else does...}}

;(Talk to Alhaitham and Nilou northeast of the Lokapala Jungle [[Statue of The Seven]] on the path at ground level, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xyjeq004 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alhaitham, Nilou, have you seen any of the other contestants?
:{{A|vo dialog xyjeq004 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' No. No one's completed the task yet... Why, has something happened?
:{{A|vo dialog xyjeq004 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There might be a problem with the diadem... Oh, but Alhaitham, you must know something about it, right?
:{{A|vo dialog xyjeq004 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Whatever do you mean?
:{{A|vo dialog xyjeq004 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You...! Forget it! We'll go find it first. We'll ask you again later!

:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 01.ogg}} '''???:''' At long last... Someone to inherit my estate... and with it, my research.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Come, Kaveh. Come to me, my child...
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 kaveh 01.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...How do you know my name? Who are you?
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 03.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' I am Sachin. Well, to be precise, I am but a fragment of Sachin's mind.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 04.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' Fate is a curious thing... Seeing you reminds me of another I once met. But you are made of sterner stuff than he, more cognizant of the trials and tribulations of this world. It is you who are worthy to inherit all that I once owned.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 05.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' We meet for the first time, children. But what I mean to say now is of utmost importance. So please, pay attention and bear witness.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 06.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' You have all performed outstandingly in this Interdarshan Championship. The Akademiya has many rare talents among its ranks, and you are the creme of the creme.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 07.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' But if I were to choose a successor, I would choose you, Kaveh. Not only because you were victorious, but also due to our similarities in character.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 kaveh 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...Me? Similar to you?
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 08.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' Why, yes. Both of us have the misfortune to be idealists &mdash; and that is the source of our misery.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 09.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' Twenty-eight years ago, I came to the desert and lived there for eight full years. What do you think I saw there? Alas, endless strife and slaughter...
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 10.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' Conflict over water sources, robbing of merchant caravans, exploitation of the people... relentlessly, day after day. Beyond the Wall of Samiel lay a completely different world from the one I knew.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 11.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' The things I witnessed there tormented me greatly. I wished desperately to find a way to save them.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 kaveh 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...So? Did you find a way?
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 12.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' As a [[Vahumana]] scholar, I tried to use Vahumana knowledge to find the answer.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 13.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' I researched history and anthropology, performed countless experiments on human nature, and even sought out the scholars living deep in the desert who call themselves the "[[Order of Skeptics|Lost Darshan]]"...
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 14.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' But in the end, I found that the answer I sought simply did not exist.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 15.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' It was not possible to simply assign blame for these transgressions to any one party, for the sins are carved into humanity's very nature. Our nature begets conflict, and conflict begets destruction. This is the inexorable truth.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 16.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' The aim of my research was to draw lessons from history, but what I discovered was that history offers no such guidance... Things can only ever go from bad to worse!
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 17.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' After this realization, I could no longer see the meaning in anything that I had ever learned. Consumed by an overwhelming sense of emptiness, I could no longer bear to face life... and so I decided to bring my life to an end.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 18.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' But before I went through with it, a strange twist of fate led me to come into the possession of this diadem, which has the ability to preserve part of one's consciousness. Into it, I placed my experiences, before requesting that the Akademiya manage my estate.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' As I thought, the contract you signed with the Akademiya was, in essence, your will.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' But if you'd given up hope on this world, why did you feel the need to do this?
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 19.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' I mentioned that I had performed a great many experiments concerning human nature... You may regard this as the very last experiment of them all.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 20.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' The Akademiya has no shortage of genius talents, nurturing the brightest minds of every generation. And so, with a handsome reward to draw out the worthiest of individuals, my hope was that one day, I would find one who could untangle the mystery of human nature once and for all, and help to move the world onto a better path.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' I see, so you desired a successor who was not only a genius, but who also understood the suffering of ordinary people. Such a person would have a clearer understanding of humanity, society, and the world.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 kaveh 04.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' But did you ever consider that wealth numbs the human heart to the pain in the world? Even an idealist may be incapable of following through on your wishes after inheriting your wealth.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 21.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' You are highly intelligent... Yet you are not the sort of person who would understand my line of thinking. To me, this is also part of the experiment &mdash; part of my investigation into human nature.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 22.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' Whether my successor suffers as a consequence of my research or succumbs to an indulgence in pleasure-seeking, my research will have progressed.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 23.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' I grieve the fundamental sickness of the world, I regret the unbearable weight of its history, and I lament the research that I failed to complete.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 24.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' And this, Kaveh, my dear child... is why you will be of great utility to me.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 kaveh 05.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' You're... you're absolutely certain that you want to give me everything you owned, for me to do with as I please?
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 5 saqqain 25.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' I have faith in what I see in you. Now, wear the diadem, Kaveh, and complete the journey that I could not.
;(A cinematic begins)
::{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 cs saqqain 01.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' Will the verdict I reached cause you suffering?
::{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 cs saqqain 02.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' Or will this newfound wealth numb your heart?
::{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 cs saqqain 03.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' I look forward to your answer.
::{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 cs saqqain 04.ogg}} '''Sachin:''' All of my research materials are being stored at A&mdash;
:;(Kaveh throws the Diadem of Knowledge to the ground, breaking it into pieces)
::{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 cs kaveh 01.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I've heard enough.
::{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 cs kaveh 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' My life's enough of a mess already.
::{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 cs kaveh 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' The last thing I need is more suffering.
::{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 cs kaveh 04.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Keep your Mora, I don't need it.
::{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 cs kaveh 05.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Didn't you say that you saw a lot of people in pain?
::{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 cs kaveh 06.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Well if that's the case, then your wealth can go to them.

:{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 kaveh 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I'm... fine... Ugh...

:{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' As the champion, and Sachin's personally designated successor, Kaveh has obtained the rights to inherit the entirety of his estate.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' For the avoidance of doubt, can you confirm that it is your intention to donate all of Sachin's wealth?
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 kaveh 04.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Like I said... he thought that the world is a bad place. Well then, let's use what he left behind to change it for the better.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 kaveh 05.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Rejecting the world will achieve nothing. He and I... We're not the same.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 alhaitham 05.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Alright. As the scribe, I will make a record of this incident on file.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 alhaitham 06.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' The sages will contact you in person for details on how exactly Sachin's estate is to be used.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 kaveh 06.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...That sounds fine.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 kaveh 07.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I don't know if his research findings were right, nor would I know how to finish his research for him.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 kaveh 08.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' But what I do know is that by ending this here, no contestants will have to suffer.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 kaveh 09.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' We won't be the last. There will be more championships to come... and countless future scholars will follow in our footsteps.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 kaveh 10.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Sachin's words can only cause pain. But... not anymore. No one else has to hear them now.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 kaveh 11.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' We're all scholars here. I know full well that shutting down his views like this is autocratic and arrogant... Fine by me. I'll bear that responsibility.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 kaveh 12.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' It's the least I can do. And, well... it's the only thing I can do.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 alhaitham 07.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' ...
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 alhaitham 08.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Well said. What you've expressed is a sense of justice and idealism that many aspire to, but few dare follow through with.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 alhaitham 09.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' I say this despite the fact that, in my view, it's quite ridiculous. You have long been aware of what your flaws are, but your pride alone prevents you from admitting it.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 alhaitham 10.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Nevertheless, your perspective is well-suited to appearing in a victory speech. Contestant Kaveh, on behalf of the organizing committee, it is my honor to congratulate you on your victory.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 kaveh 13.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' What? Please. I don't need your insincere praise.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 kaveh 14.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Anyway, this isn't the time or place for debates. Keep your commentary focused on the competition, not my views.
:{{A|vo xyjeq004 6 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Congratulations, Kaveh! Also, you'll need to prepare for the award ceremony...
