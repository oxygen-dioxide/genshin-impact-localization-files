==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ahoeitu:''' Yeah, it's about time to replace some old equipment...
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Ahoeitu knows)
:::'''Ahoeitu:''' The guards have reported seeing some ores nearby. [[Condessence Crystal]]s, apparently, and no small amount of Magical Crystal Ore either... Not exactly headline news though.
:::'''Ahoeitu:''' If only we had someone from the Children of Echoes here, we could have consulted them about the quality... Though as I see it, they're all pretty much the same anyway. Every kind of material has its use, after all.
:::'''Ahoeitu:''' Anyway, if you're in need of ore, you can go mine some here.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Ahoeitu knows)
:::'''Ahoeitu:''' Let me think... The temperature of the hot spring should be pretty ideal right now. Fancy a dip?
:{{DIcon}} What sort of equipment?
::'''Ahoeitu:''' Ah, I'm talking about clothes and tools that can withstand very high temperatures. Our tribespeople need them to conduct regular inspections deep within the volcano.
::'''Ahoeitu:''' Koholasaurs are the only Saurians here that can traverse molten lava, so it falls on us to monitor the activities of the volcano.
::'''Ahoeitu:''' The volcano has always been known for accidents and mishaps, and remains a vulnerable spot for monster attacks. They could come in from both inside and out, so it's the least we can do to keep a close eye on it.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Ahoeitu:''' Take care!
