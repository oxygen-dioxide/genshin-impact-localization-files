'''Anemo Rings''' are white, glowing rings that accelerate the player upon gliding through them. They can sometimes be found in the open world, but are more commonly seen as temporary gimmicks created upon activating [[Anemo Pinwheel]]s, [[Anemo Monument]]s, or certain [[Time Trial Challenge]]s.

They can give a brief boost in movement speed in one of the two directions the ring is facing, whichever one is closest to the direction the player is already moving in. Usually, multiple rings are set up in such a way allowing the player to pass through several in a row, creating a consistent speed boost.

The rings can boost in the horizontal or vertical directions, but also at various angles in between.

[[Venti]]'s [[Elemental Skill]] is a fixed animation that does not count as gliding. Once the animation ends, or it is interrupted, he can glide and air rings will have their directional effect on him.

==Wind Breakers==
Wind Breakers are unusual Anemo Rings that were first introduced in the [[Gliding Challenge]] event. These orange glowing rings slow the player passing through it. The debuff can be immediately removed by passing through a normal Anemo Ring. Currently, Wind Breakers can only be found during certain challenges and events.
