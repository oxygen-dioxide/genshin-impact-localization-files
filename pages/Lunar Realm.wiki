'''Lunar Realm''' is a [[Fishing]] [[Event]] in [[Version 2.1]].

==Event Details==
===Duration===
* 2021/09/10 10:00:00 – 2021/09/20 03:59:59

===Requirements===
* [[Adventure Rank]] 30 or above
* Complete the [[Archon Quest]] "[[Ritou Escape Plan]]", unlock the [[Serenitea Pot]] System, and complete the "[[Exploding Population]]" quest given by Mondstadt's [[Nantuck]]

===Summary===
* "Lunar Realm" has a total of seven [[fishing]] missions and special fishing training. For the first seven days of the event, one quest or special training will be unlocked each day.

* When the [[Glowgrass Bait]] used to catch the event-exclusive fish is used up, you can obtain it repeatedly by talking to [[Kujirai Momiji]] in the [[Bait Resupply Plan]] Quest.
* During the event, after completing a series of missions and fishing training, you can obtain rewards such as the event-exclusive fishing rod "[[Moonstringer]]," [[Primogem]]s, Mysterious Fish Furnishing, [[Hero's Wit]], [[Sanctifying Unction]], [[Mystic Enhancement Ore]], and [[Mora]].
