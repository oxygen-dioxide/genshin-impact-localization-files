{{Description|A will that surpasses time itself finally caused her to step aside and allow Eternity to enter a new chapter.<br />But behold, that thrilling battle at Mt. Yougou has been revived in the form of memories.<br />Relive her test once more, and you might just learn something new...}}
'''End of the Oneiric Euthymia''' is a [[Trounce Domain]] unlocked after completing the [[Raiden Shogun]]'s [[Story Quest]], [[Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter]]: Act II - [[Transient Dreams]]. Players can relive their fight against [[The Shogun]] and receive bountiful rewards.

==Boss Description==
{{Description|This is the form of the puppet that inherited the Raiden Shogun's authority takes when she is opposing those who threaten Eternity.<br />As the Raiden Shogun's assistant in pursuing eternity, she has never doubted, never felt fear, never given anything less than her best, never been disturbed by idle thoughts.<br />She once heard about how Ei had shouldered a similar duty when Makoto was also present, suffering much agonizing loss in the process. When the two shadows overlapped once more, however, she could only see the countless fine fractures in what should have been "her" eternal will. Since fate is destined for cyclicality, she must fulfill her promise and declare war on "her".<br /><br />''Mine is the most supreme and noble form. Power over the realm has been vested within me, and I am the essence of all that is the "Raiden Shogun."<br />"Naturally, I have also inherited the pain of Ei's countless losses and her will to attain eternity.<br />"Resolve, valor, love, hate... They will all twist in the river of time.<br />"But the 'rules' will never change"''|[[Archive]]}}

==Rules==
{{Transclude|Domain|trouncerule|section=1}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
''Most attack names are unofficial.''

===Normal===
Upon starting the boss fight, the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto will be in one of two stances: The '''[[Musou Isshin]] Stance''' or the '''[[Engulfing Lightning]] Stance'''. Every time she uses '''Thunderbolt''' or '''Eyes of Stillness''', she will switch her stance.

====Stance-Independent====
{{Enemy Attacks
|enemy = Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto

|name_1 = Ominous Destiny
|desc_1 = The Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto will accumulate [[Fury|Ominous Destiny]]. Ominous Destiny has a max value of '''900'''. When Ominous Destiny reaches max, she will enter her Baleful Shadowlord state.
* Every 2 seconds, the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto gains '''20''' Ominous Destiny.
* When the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto hits the player, she gains '''40''' Ominous Destiny. This form of Ominous Destiny accumulation can be triggered once every 2 seconds.

|name_2 = Shield
|desc_2 = When attacked by the player using melee attacks, raises a shield around her that blocks all incoming melee DMG. After being attacked a certain amount of times in this state, drops her shield and performs a counterattack, dealing '''33.3% ATK''', '''8.3% ATK × 3''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} in the '''Musou Isshin Stance''' or '''16.6% ATK''', '''33.3% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} in the '''Engulfing Lightning Stance'''.
* The counterattack can only be triggered after she has successfully defended from '''4''' attacks while shielded.
* After she successfully defending from 4 attacks, any further attacks will have a probability to trigger the counter. This probability increases with every successful defense.
** The counterattack trigger probability is calculated as:<br /><math>\text{Probability} = 10 \% \times \text{Successful Defense Count While Shielded}</math>
* The defense count resets to zero '''1.25''' seconds after successfully shielding an attack if not followed up by another. Therefore, slow attacks are less likely to trigger the counterattack.

|name_13 = "The Final Calamity"
|desc_13 = Covers herself within her palms and blinks away, completely draining all party members' Energy and leaving Flowers of Remembrance in the form of an orb. Using elemental attacks on the orb will charge it, and {{Electro}} is significantly more effective than other elements. Once fully charged, a shield will be created at the orb's location. The Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto marks an unprotected player with the Eye of Stormy Judgement, then performs a massive horizontal slash that temporarily freezes players in place and triggers the [[death]] of the active character regardless of [[shield]] status or any defensive stats.
* 1 Electro attack charges the orb fully, and 1 non-Electro elemental attack charges the orb by {{Not a typo|'''26%'''}}, regardless of the amount of [[Elemental Gauge Theory|gauge units]] applied. The orb can only be charged by non-Electro attacks once every '''0.5s'''. Note that this cooldown is different from the standard elemental application [[Internal Cooldown|ICD]], which is not taken into account for charging the orb.
* Characters protected by the orb's shield will be dealt {{Color|1 True Electro DMG}}. This DMG can be negated using shields.
* In Co-Op Mode, only a single unprotected player will be targeted and be marked with the Eye of Stormy Judgment. If multiple players are unprotected by the orb's shield and a player is marked, only the marked player will die. Other players will take '''66.6% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
* Although [[Sprinting#Dash|dash]] [[Invincibility Frames|i-frames]] are ineffective against this attack, it can be dodged using [[Mona]]'s [[Mirror Reflection of Doom]] i-frames. It is also possible to use [[Elemental Burst]] i-frames if a character manages to recharge Energy to full after the Energy drain at the beginning of this attack.
* [[Hu Tao]]'s [[Butterfly's Embrace|6th Constellation]] and [[Kuki Shinobu]]'s [[To Ward Weakness|6th Constellation]] will activate and allow them to survive this attack.

==Soundtracks==
{{Soundtracks by Category Table|End of the Oneiric Euthymia Soundtracks|header=End of the Oneiric Euthymia}}

==Trivia==
* This domain introduced dynamic music to the game, where two versions of the same soundtrack flow seamlessly into each other when the Baleful Shadowlord phase starts or ends. Dynamic music is later used again in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]] and [[Vanarana]].
* The Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto's design is likely inspired by the [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Herrscher of Thunder|Herrscher of Thunder]].
* Defeating the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto while in her Baleful Shadowlord form will not trigger any defeat dialogue.
