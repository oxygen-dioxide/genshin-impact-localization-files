==Boss Description==
{{Description|This is the form of the puppet that inherited the Raiden Shogun's authority takes when she is opposing those who threaten Eternity.<br />As the Raiden Shogun's assistant in pursuing eternity, she has never doubted, never felt fear, never given anything less than her best, never been disturbed by idle thoughts.<br />She once heard about how Ei had shouldered a similar duty when Makoto was also present, suffering much agonizing loss in the process. When the two shadows overlapped once more, however, she could only see the countless fine fractures in what should have been "her" eternal will. Since fate is destined for cyclicality, she must fulfill her promise and declare war on "her".<br /><br />''Mine is the most supreme and noble form. Power over the realm has been vested within me, and I am the essence of all that is the "Raiden Shogun."<br />"Naturally, I have also inherited the pain of Ei's countless losses and her will to attain eternity.<br />"Resolve, valor, love, hate... They will all twist in the river of time.<br />"But the 'rules' will never change"''|[[Archive]]}}

''Names are unofficial''

===Normal===
Upon starting the boss fight, the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto will be in one of two stances: The '''[[Musou Isshin]] Stance''' or the '''[[Engulfing Lightning]] Stance'''. Every time she uses '''Thunderbolt''' or '''Eyes of Stillness''', she will switch her stance.

====Stance-Independent====
* '''Ominous Destiny:''' The Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto will accumulate [[Fury|Ominous Destiny]]. Ominous Destiny has a max value of '''900'''. When Ominous Destiny reaches max, she will enter her Baleful Shadowlord state.
** Every 2 seconds, the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto gains '''20''' Ominous Destiny.
** When the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto hits the player, she gains '''40''' Ominous Destiny. This form of Ominous Destiny accumulation can be triggered once every 2 seconds.

* '''Shield:''' When attacked by the player using melee attacks, raises a shield around her that blocks all incoming DMG. After being attacked a certain amount of times in this state, drops her shield and performs a counterattack, dealing '''100% ATK''', '''25% ATK * 3''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} in the '''Musou Isshin Stance''' or '''50% ATK''', '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} in the '''Engulfing Lightning Stance'''.

* '''Stun Recovery:''' When recovering from a stunned state, deals '''25% ATK''' {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} around her.

* '''Follow-Up:''' If the player is behind the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto shortly after she performs '''Slash Combo 1''', '''Slash Combo 3''', '''Cross-Slash''', '''Lightning Summon''', '''Lightning Blade''', or '''Stun Recovery''', swiftly turns around to perform an additional attack.
** In the '''Musou Isshin Stance''', performs a flurry of slashes, dealing '''150% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.
** In the '''Engulfing Lightning Stance''', performs a slash. Explosions will also occur on the ground along the slash's path. The slash and the explosion each deals '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.

====Stance Switch====
* '''Thunderbolt:''' Deals '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} in front of her and switches to the '''Musou Isshin Stance'''. Afterwards, periodically summons thunderbolts that strike the ground, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.

* '''Eyes of Stillness:''' Deals '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} in front of her and switches to the '''Engulfing Lightning Stance'''. Afterwards, periodically summons multiple eyes around the arena that unleash a flurry of slashes shortly after appearing, dealing '''17% ATK * 4''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.

====Musou Isshin Stance====
* '''Slash Combo 1:''' Performs five consecutive strikes, dealing '''25% ATK''', '''25% ATK''', '''50% ATK''', '''25% ATK''', '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.

* '''Slash Combo 2:''' Dashes at the player, performs a circular slash, and quickly repositions behind the player to perform another slash. The circular slash and the second slash deal '''25% ATK * 2''' and '''50% ATK''' respectively as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.

* '''Cross-Slash:''' Dashes towards the player and slashes twice in a cross pattern. The initial dash, the first slash and the second slash deal '''50% ATK''', '''25% ATK''', and '''175% ATK''' respectively as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.

* '''Unbending Lightning:''' Launches three discs followed by a horizontal blade at the player. The discs and the horizontal blade each deal '''100% ATK''' and '''150% ATK''' respectively as {{Color|Electro DMG}} on contact.

* '''Illusions:''' Separates herself into four illusions that periodically launch lightning blades at the player, dealing {{Color|Electro DMG}} on contact. Hitting an illusion three times will destroy it.
** One of the illusions will launch two lightning blades in a cross pattern at once, indicating that it is the special illusion. Destroying this illusion will temporarily stun the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto. When destroyed, an invisible explosion will hit players in close proximity. This explosion deals no DMG and applies no elemental status, but can trigger hit-related effects.
** The blades launched by the regular illusions and the special illusion deal '''25% ATK''' and '''50% ATK''' respectively as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
** Destroying a regular illusion will cause it to explode, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.

* '''Musou no Hitotachi:''' The Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto [[Vacuum Field|pushes]] nearby players away from her, while Electro seeds descend around the arena, each creating a field that deals '''37.5% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DoT}}. The Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto then unleashes a flurry of slashes that temporarily freezes players in place within its AoE, dealing '''50% ATK * 4''' and '''300% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.

====Engulfing Lightning Stance====
* '''Slash Combo 3:''' Performs three consecutive slashes around her. After the last slash, summons lightning in a large area around her. Each hit deals '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}. This attack is always used when the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto teleports to the player's left side.

* '''Slash Combo 4:''' Spins her polearm before dashing at the player and performing four consecutive strikes, dealing '''50% ATK''', '''25% ATK''', '''50% ATK''', '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}. The initial slash of this combo cannot be dodged using [[Sprinting#Dash|dash]] [[Invincibility Frames|i-frames]].

* '''Lightning Summon:''' Spins her polearm and summons lightning in a large area around her, dealing '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}. This attack cannot be dodged using [[Sprinting#Dash|dash]] [[Invincibility Frames|i-frames]]. This attack is always used when the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto teleports to the player's right side.

* '''Lightning Blade:''' Launches a fast vertical blade at the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} on contact. This attack is often used as a follow-up to '''Slash Combo 3''' but can also be used individually.

* '''Magatsu Electroculi:''' Summons a Magatsu Electroculus at the center of the arena. If not destroyed after a period of time, the Magatsu Electroculus explodes violently, dealing '''350% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}. Destroying the Magatsu Electroculus will temporarily stun the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto.
** '''Enhanced:''' Summons three Magatsu Electroculi around the arena while [[Vacuum Field|pushing]] nearby players away from her. If not destroyed after a period of time, the Magatsu Electroculi explode violently, dealing '''400% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}. If a player is within an area where multiple Electroculi's AoE overlap, they will be damaged multiple times.

===Baleful Shadowlord===
When '''Ominous Destiny''' reaches max, the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto enters the Baleful Shadowlord form, gaining stronger attacks as well as an {{Electro}} [[shield]] that greatly increases her [[RES]]. This shield will be drained by '''~0.83%''' every 10 seconds. This shield is weakest to {{Cryo}} and {{Pyro}}. Once the shield is depleted, the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto will exit the Baleful Shadowlord form, completely recharge all party members' [[Energy]] and become stunned for a period of time with lowered RES.

* '''Energy Drain:''' While the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto is in the Baleful Shadowlord form, active characters will lose 20 Energy every 5 seconds.

* '''Energy Generation:''' While the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto is in the Baleful Shadowlord form, triggering [[Elemental Reactions]] on her will generate 3 [[Energy|Non-Elemental Energy Particles]]. This generation has a cooldown of 1.5s.

* '''Slash Combo 1:''' If the player is in front of the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto, performs two horizontal slashes and shoots a bolt at the ground in front of her, dealing '''50% ATK''', '''75% ATK''', '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}. The bolt explodes after a short period of time, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.

* '''Slash Combo 2:''' If the player is behind the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto, swiftly turns and performs a slash. Following the slash, lightning strike the ground along the slash's path, and the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto shoots a bolt at the ground in front of her that explodes after a short period of time. The slash, the lightning strikes, the bolt's landing and the bolt's explosion deal '''200% ATK''', '''25% ATK''', '''50% ATK''', and '''100% ATK''' respectively as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.

* '''Downward Slash''' Marks a large area in front of her as she charges her blade, dealing '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DoT}} around her, before performing a downward slash, dealing '''350% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.

* '''Lightning Blade (Enhanced)''' Slashes twice, dealing '''75% ATK * 2''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} and launching forward five vertical lightning blades, and one horizontal blade at a slower speed. Each vertical and horizontal blade deals '''75% ATK''' and '''150% ATK''' respectively as {{Color|Electro DMG}} to players who come in contact.

* '''Single Slash:''' Readies her blade in a sheathed position, before performing a single slash that deals '''150% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} around her.

* '''Slash Flurry:''' If the player is far away, readies her blade in a sheathed position, before dashing at the player and performing a flurry of slashes in front of her, dealing '''50% ATK''', '''25% ATK * 2''', '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.

* '''Clap:''' Summons a pair of hands that follows the player before crushing in, dealing '''150% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.

* '''Puppet's Shadow:''' Launches a shadow that follows the player, dealing '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DoT}} on contact. After a period of time, the orb transforms into a hand that smashes down at the player, dealing '''50% ATK''' on appearance and '''100% ATK''' on landing as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.

* '''Baleful Vajra's Destructive Waves:''' Summons three totems at the center of the arena that deal '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} upon landing. The bolts that landed will periodically release waves of Electro energy that expand outwards. At the end of the bolts' duration, all three bolts will release a wave simultaneously. These waves deal '''150% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} to players upon contact.

* '''"The Final Calamity":''' Covers herself within her palms and blinks away, completely draining all party members' Energy and leaving Flowers of Remembrance in the form of an orb. Using elemental attacks on the orb will charge it, and {{Electro}} is significantly more effective than other elements. Once fully charged, a shield will be created at the orb's location. The Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto marks an unprotected player with the Eye of Stormy Judgement, then performs a massive horizontal slash that temporarily freezes players in place and triggers the [[death]] of the active character.
** 1 instance of Electro application charges the orb fully, and 1 instance of non-Electro elemental application charges the orb by {{Not a typo|'''26%'''}}, regardless of the amount of [[Gauge Unit Theory|gauges]] applied. There is a '''0.5s''' cooldown between each instance of elemental application, which is shared between all characters and all players in [[Co-Op Mode]]. Note that this cooldown is different from the standard elemental application [[Internal Cooldown|ICD]], which does not take effect here.
** This attack triggers death to the marked character regardless of [[shield]] status, [[DEF]], or [[RES]]. Effects that trigger on character death such as [[Butterfly's Embrace]] and [[To Ward Weakness]] still apply. A screen shatter effect precedes the death trigger.
** Characters protected by the orb's shield will be dealt {{Color|1 True Electro DMG}}. This DMG can be negated using shields. While the screen will still freeze, the shatter effect will only appear on the shielded area.
** Although [[Sprinting#Dash|dash]] [[Invincibility Frames|i-frames]] are ineffective against this attack, it can be dodged using [[Mona]]'s [[Mirror Reflection of Doom]] i-frames. It is also possible to use [[Elemental Burst]] i-frames if a character manages to recharge Energy to full after the Energy drain at the beginning of this attack.
** In Co-Op Mode, only a single unprotected player will be targeted and be marked with the Eye of Stormy Judgment. If multiple players are unprotected by the orb's shield and a player is marked, only the marked player will die. Other players will take '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.

==Strategy==
Due to the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto's high mobility, deployable abilities that cannot be repositioned are rendered less effective, and ranged characters are recommended. It is advisable to attempt to stun her in order to create a window of vulnerability, either by destroying the special '''Illusion''' or the '''Magatsu Electroculus'''. It is possible to defeat the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto without her entering the Baleful Shadowlord form.

If the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto performs the '''Musou no Hitotachi''' attack, the player can run to the border of the arena to completely avoid otherwise fatal damage.

While in her Baleful Shadowlord form, {{Pyro}} and {{Cryo}} are the most effective against the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto's {{Electro}} [[Shields|shield]]. Triggering [[Elemental Reactions]] on her will also generate elemental particles, which can be used to combat her ability to drain energy. In this phase, it is advisable to stay close to the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto, as her '''Slash Flurry''', which is only used at range, is impossible to dodge by [[Sprinting#Dash|dashing]].

If the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto performs '''"The Final Calamity"''', the player should immediately start attacking the Flowers of Remembrance with elemental attacks and stay under the protection of the shield, as failing to do so will result in the active character's guaranteed death.

Once the Baleful Shadowlord state ends, all party members' Energy will be instantly recharged to full, and the Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto will be stunned for a long period of time with lowered [[Resistance]]s. Use this opportunity to deal large amounts of damage upon her.

{{Soundtracks by Category Table|End of the Oneiric Euthymia Soundtracks}}

==Trivia==
* This domain introduced dynamic music to the game, where two versions of the same soundtrack flow seamlessly into each other when the Baleful Shadowlord phase starts or ends. Dynamic music is later used again in some areas of [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]].
* The Magatsu Mitake Narukami no Mikoto's design is likely inspired by the {{hi3rd|Herrscher of Thunder}}.
