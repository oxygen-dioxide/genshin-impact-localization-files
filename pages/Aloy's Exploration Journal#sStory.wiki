|There's a dandelion here. I hear that Mondstadt is known as the "Horizon of Dandelion."

|I found a damaged mechanical fragment here. There seems to be a branch-like appendage at the top. It was probably dropped by some kind of giant.

|There was a boar dead ahead, so I snuck up quietly and captured it.

|Another damaged piece of machinery, like the fragment I found earlier! Maybe they're related?

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Aloy:''' Sure enough, there are also giant mechanical monsters in Teyvat. If I'm correct, this must be what the locals call "Ruin Guard," and it looks like it has been around for a long time.
:'''Aloy:''' When taking this mechanical creature head on, I cannot take my eye off of it. Not even for a second.
:'''Aloy:''' Let's figure out where its weak spot is.
;Let's figure out where its weak spot is.
:{{DIcon}} Option A: Exposed cores in its head and back
::That's the one! Now that I know where the weak point is, this will be easy.
:{{DIcon}} Option B: Its arms
::No, that does not seem to be the weak point. Let's try again.
:'''Aloy:''' The exposed cores in its head and back ought to be the weak points of this mechanical monster, so I'll start from there.
;A sharp arrow flies forward and is about to hit its target, but the Ruin Guard manages to avoid it by spinning around.
:'''Aloy:''' This giant looks pretty heavy but its reflexes are quick, and it seems to know very clearly where to focus on protecting itself.
;Aloy continues to loose arrows from her bow. Gradually, the biting cold of Cryo began to form on the plumes of her arrows.
;The Ruin Guard swings its arms to counterattack, but Aloy dodges them. She continues to loose arrows at its cores. With each arrow resonating with ice, they hit their target one after another.
;The giant mechanical monster's body sways back and forth, losing its balance and falling to the ground after bearing {{sic|an}} relentless assault.
:'''Aloy:''' Phew, there we go.

|It is said that Dragonspine's geographical conditions are very unusual and the rare Starsilver Ore can only be found there.
|-

|There were traces of giant, neatly formed footprints in the snow. Judging by the shape, some kind of mechanical monster must have been here.
|-
|[[File:Aloy's Exploration Journal Discovery 7.png|100px]]
|I found some rare Chilled Meat. Since this kind of meat can only be preserved in the extreme climate of Dragonspine, this must be a rare find, indeed.

|There is something buried in the snow... It appears to be a discarded mechanical core, which looks slightly different from the previous one.

:'''Aloy:''' Dragonspine's landscape is unusual. This monster looks a little bigger than the others. This must be the Ruin Grader.
:'''Aloy:''' Nevertheless, its mobility and its reflexes do not seem to have slowed down at all.
:'''Aloy:''' Alright, same as before. Got to find its weak point.
:{{DIcon}} Option A: The cores in its head and feet
::That's the one! Now that I know where the weak point is, this will be easy.
:{{DIcon}} Option B: On its chest
::No, that does not seem to be the weak point. Let's try again.
:'''Aloy:''' The cores are located in its head and feet. Now I just got to find the right opportunity to attack.
;The Ruin Grader charges forth, the weight of its colossal body shaking the ground with each step.
;Aloy quickly lobs a Freeze Bomb aimed at the Ruin Grader's location.
;The Freeze Bomb hits its target with great precision and splits into smaller Chillwater Bomblets, releasing a large amount of Cryo.
;Aloy sees an opportunity to take advantage of the Ruin Grader in its stalled state, and throws a Cryo-infused Power Cell.
;She then looses an arrow from her bow, hitting the Power Cell perfectly with her shot, A breath of ice burst in the air, raining down on the Ruin Grader and covering its enormous body.
:'''Aloy:''' Enemy defeated.

|Translucent and elegant white flowers that only grow on the highest mountain peaks. These must be Liyue's famous Qingxin flowers.
|-

|A large shadow was cast from the sky above. Judging from its shape, it must be from a new kind of mechanical monster.
|-

|There were several pigeons right ahead. I quietly approached them and managed to catch one.

|This giant mechanical spike must be related to the giant that flew through the sky just now. Is it the monster's arm? Weapon? Maybe it's both.

===Battle===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Aloy:''' There it is! A flying mechanical monster, what the locals call a "Ruin Hunter."
:'''Aloy:''' It's harder to hit when it takes flight, so I'll have to aim faster and more accurately.
:'''Aloy:''' To be sure, it might be for the best to figure out where its weak point is.
:{{DIcon}} A: The exposed core in its head when it is hovering high in the air
::That's the one! Now that I know where the weak point is, this will be easy.
:{{DIcon}} B: Its mechanical claws
::No, that does not seem to be the weak point. Let's try again.
:'''Aloy:''' Sure enough, there's a core in its head, but it's only exposed when its hovering high in the air.
:'''Aloy:''' It appears that I must find the right moment to deal a fatal blow while it's flying.
;The Ruin Hunter sensed that there were intruders nearby, and quickly rose into the air, brandishing its arms for an attack.
;Before the mechanical arms attacked, they became sharp spikes, before thrusting forth with great speed.
;Aloy adjusts her position and skillfully dodges the attack.
;Moments later, the Ruin Hunter's massive body rose into the sky, as it takes aim at Aloy's position, and began an artillery barrage.
;Aloy gracefully dodges the barrage and waits for an opportune moment to strike.
;Finally, with the barrage abating, Aloy found her opportunity, and began loosing arrows at the Ruin Hunter's weak point.
;The mechanical body shook a few times, with sparks flying out of it, before crashing to the ground.
:'''Aloy:''' Well, that was easy.
