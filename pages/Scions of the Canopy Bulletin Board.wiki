===Safety Warning===
:'''Tribal Announcement:''' "The majority of our tribe's buildings are suspended on the cliffsides. We kindly ask all visitors to stay safe and avoid getting too close to the platform edges."
:'''Tribal Announcement:''' "Until you have undergone the proper training and passed all the basic tests, we advise against casually attempting extreme sports like the Scions of the Canopy."
:'''Tribal Announcement:''' "Even though you'd likely be rescued by one of our valiant Yumkasaurs, and thus avoid coming to any real harm, the impact and dizziness of coming to a sudden stop after a free-fall can still be somewhat overwhelming..."
:'''Tribal Announcement:''' "You might be left with your legs shaking, traumatized for weeks... So even though you came up the mountain on foot, you'll find yourself crawling back down on your knees."
