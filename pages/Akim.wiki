{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Before completing ???)
:'''Akim:''' You get what you pay for. Do you think the work I do is the same as everyone else's?
:'''Harim:''' Doing things differently from others doesn't mean your work is worth more.
:'''Harim:''' Besides, everyone can learn masonry from the [[Akasha]]. What makes you so different?
:'''Harim:''' If it weren't for the fact that we're old pals, I wouldn't be going out of my way to make sure you're getting business.
:'''Akim:''' The knowledge foundation might be the same, sure, but what gets built on it is different!
:'''Akim:''' Unlike other people, I'm an innovator! I've also tried more kinds of clay...
:'''Harim:''' Aha! Caught ya! And you said you weren't asking me for more money because you wanted to buy new materials!

;(After completing ???)
:'''Akim:''' You get what you pay for. Do you think the work I do is the same as everyone else's?
:'''Harim:''' Doing things differently from others doesn't mean your work is worth more.
:'''Harim:''' Besides, everyone can learn masonry from the Akasha. What makes you so different anyway?
:'''Akim:''' Hah! I wouldn't speak so soon. Akasha's been shut down... and anyway, everyone does things differently!
:'''Harim:''' Alright, alright! Let's just say that you win, and your unique craftsmanship is why I buy your goods! Sheesh. If it weren't for the fact that we're old pals, I wouldn't be going out of my way to make sure you're getting business.
:'''Akim:''' Hah. The foundational knowledge might be the same, sure, but what gets built upon it is different!
:'''Akim:''' Unlike the others, I'm an innovator! I've also tried more kinds of clay...
:'''Harim:''' Aha! Caught you, haven't I? Didn't you claim that you weren't asking me for more Mora because you wanted to buy new materials?
