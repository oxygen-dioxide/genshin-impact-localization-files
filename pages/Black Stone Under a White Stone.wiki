==Summary==
;A Decision

After spending a short time with the [[People of the Springs]], [[Paimon]] remarks on their hospitality and how the two days felt like a vacation to them. Just then, [[Mualani]] and then [[Tonina]] arrives, and tells them that the group from the Night Warden Wars had returned. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the inexperienced [[Kachina]] had fallen in battle but because the group was victorious, the Ode of Resurrection would bring her back to life. However, she should keep her head held high, as it was an honor. Mualani then explains to the Traveler that the [[Abyss]] was not as simple as it was believed to be; during the [[cataclysm]], when the nations of [[Teyvat]] were attacked by it, the Abyss appeared to have specifically crafted each disaster for every tribe. Due to the actions of the then-[[Pyro Archon]] and the people, they were slowly able to repel the Abyss, but took massive casualties in the process and the damage dealt was reversed extremely slow. 

Returning to the city, they meet up with [[Kinich]], who had just finished a [[commission]] that took longer than anticipated. Heading to the stadium, the crowd sings the Ode of Resurrection as Archon [[Mavuika]] enters the [[Sacred Flame]] to retrieve Kachina, but then exits it alone, announcing that she could not find Kachina or her [[Ancient Name]], shocking the crowd. [[Tepexpan]] and [[Tamuin]], also present in the crowd, begin to heckle over Kachina's failure, despite [[Chasca]]'s insistence that they successfully completed their mission and enraging Mualani. Mavuika puts a stop to their heckling, proclaiming that she herself is not even sure as to why Kachina had failed to return, and thus decides to suspend the pilgrimage until further notice. She states that doubt should be a motivation to seek truth, not a weapon to use against others, and challenges the stammering Tepexpan and Tamuin to ask her directly about their doubts about Kachina's heroism. When the pair's bravado crumbles in embarrassment and declines to ask, Mavuika points out that she hadn't stated anything to change their minds and exposes that their motivation was not to find the truth after all. Mualani asks Mavuika about the investigation, but as the Archon knows nothing further at the moment, she invites Mualani to join the investigation and meet with her in the [[Speaker's Chamber]]. Mavuika also asks the Traveler to come along so she can speak with them as well.

In the chamber, Mavuika theorizes that the Abyss may have found a way to undermine the "rules" of the pilgrimage, threatening the Sacred Flame. Combined with the attack on the Meztli tribe, she either had to continue the pilgrimage with further casualties, or stop it at the cost of the Abyss increasing their attacks on the nation. Kinich states that the first option was less dangerous, but Mavuika believes that both options were just as bad, as it was an attempt to undermine faith in the pilgrimage, which would divide the tribes. Mavuika then states that with the help from the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]], she could find Kachina's [[Ancient Name]] and pinpoint her location, though a group would be needed to physically enter the Night Kingdom and find her directly. Mualani and the Traveler volunteer to rescue Kachina, as they still have many promises to uphold. Chasca also volunteers, to atone for what she considers her failure to protect Kachina during the mission.

Iansan further speculates that Mavuika had further reasons to suspend the pilgrimage, which she confirms; despite hosting the pilgrimage frequently, the production of Contending Fire was far from sufficient and that they were now at their breaking point. The suspension would also serve to keep each tribe strong to defend against the Abyss. To keep the Sacred Flame going, Mavuika decides to sacrifice her power to do so, while Kinich believes they should focus on finding the other Ancient Name bearers. Mavuika tells him that they should let time pass, as the [[Wayob]] had chosen them and it was up to them to determine how the story would end.

Suddenly, a person enters the stadium to warn the Archon that the [[Fatui]] were present. Two [[Fatui Skirmisher]]s arrive, before another person does, revealed to be [[Capitano]] &mdash; the first of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]]. Capitano accuses Mavuika of failing to fulfill the oath made 500 years ago and proclaims that he will usher in a new era and rules for Natlan, but first by eliminating the old. Mavuika and Capitano clash, the former managing to land a searing wound on his chest before someone from the Masters of the Night-Wind emits a fog that allows Capitano to escape. Mavuika managed to sense the presence and orders Kinich to ask [[Citlali]] who the person could be, while back in the chamber, Paimon wonders what had happened.

;To Reclaim an Ancient Name

In order to physically enter the Night Kingdom, a [[Spiritspeaker Stone]] is required for the process. The group heads to the [[Huitztlan]] tribe and Chasca asks [[Wayna]] for the stone. Wayna is surprised to hear why they need it and complies upon hearing their reason. He further refers them to [[Vichama]], who is experienced enough to navigate the Night Kingdom. They approach Vichama, who agrees to help as long as they help him find his friend [[Mallko]] afterwards and asks them to fetch him some materials to begin the process; some rope and obsidian. The group acquire both items at the market and learn why Vichama was depressed; during one pilgrimage, he had injured himself on the eve of battle when the Abyss attacked his tribe. Fearing that he would be a burden to the group with his injury, he and his group spoke to the Pyro Archon for an exception. While the request was granted, unfortunately, the group was beset by a larger than anticipated horde of Abyssal monsters and overwhelmed. Vichama felt that his skills would have helped to avoid the situation had he been present.

Vichama begins the ritual and is attacked by monsters, which the group manages to repel. He manages to acquire Kachina's name, but while the Traveler siphons away and purifies massive amounts of Abyssal energy from Vichama so he can push further in, he fails to find Mallko's despite being in excruciating pain. When the group discovers that they can't break the link between the Spiritspeaker Stone and Vichama to end the ritual, this forces Chasca to destroy the stone with her bow to protect everyone, and the Traveler manages to find Mallko's final memory. While Vichama is glad to have heard his voice again, he knew that the smile and tone was forced and laments his decision to stay behind. Chasca informs him that he was now contaminated with Abyssal energy though his exposure was made brief thanks to the Traveler, but advises him that he'll be fine as long as he controls his symptoms. They return to Wayna, finding Chasca's younger sister, [[Chuychu]]. Wayna explains Chasca's past of being adopted by Chuychu's family to the group, while the sisters argue off to the side over Chasca's decision to venture into the Night Kingdom. Ultimately, Chuychu agrees to support her older sister, while they inform Wayna that the stone had broken. He fears that Citlali would be angered, though he agrees to explain what happened to her later and prays for their success.

;Echoes of Life

With Kachina's Ancient Name recovered, the group returns to the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]], where they learn that Mavuika had clashed with Capitano and her sacrifice. She leads them to another chamber where they discover a large amount of mementos the Pyro Archons had kept over the years, of which some are more familiar than others. Mavuika then explains that during the cataclysm, after [[Tenoch]] had united the tribes and saved Natlan, the first Pyro Archon laid a foundation of rules that were followed in the current day before Paimon notices a family portrait of Mavuika and her family. Just as they finish talking about it, the powder settles and the group initiates the ritual.

Kachina appears before the group, initially believing them to be an Abyss trick until she's reassured that they aren't. She informs them that during her "death", she was attacked by some Abyssal entity trying to kill her, but [[Wayob]] helped her to flee and hide. She had investigated the Night Kingdom and discovered that the Abyss was affecting the Wayob, and surmised that this was thus preventing her from coming back. She is scared of what will happen and initially tells them to leave her to not risk others, but Mualani refuses and encourages her to hang on until they can find her before losing contact. Mavuika then directs them to an entrance to the Night Kingdom and Iansan volunteers to go with them to increase the chances of success. 

When they arrive at the ruins, Paimon remarks on how advanced Natlan civilization was back then, before Chasca and Iansan correct her by stating that it was actually the civilization of the [[Seven Sovereigns|elemental sovereigns]]. Due to the presence of the Abyss, various devices in the formerly-abandoned ruins were now activating and they fight their way through various [[hilichurls]] and Saurian manifestations before arriving at the rift leading to the Night Kingdom.
----
;Into Eternal Night

Stepping into the rift, the group is sent tumbling down a seemingly long drop but are unscathed. Now in the Abyss-corrupted Night Kingdom, Chasca warns the group to be on guard as many strange black entities float in the distance. An unknown entity informs them that they're manifestations of Abyssal power before introducing itself as Mallko, who they recognize as Vichama's friend. Mallko explains that after his death, he was lost to the realm until he felt a strange power calling to him, but even now he can feel his concentrated form slowly dissipating. Learning that they were here for Kachina, he offers to help them while he still can and protects them from the manifestations. They find Kachina being attacked by several [[riftwolf|riftwolves]] and kill them. Kachina is relieved to see her friends again and asks them to accompany her to the Wayob. The group agrees as Mallko explains how the Wayob's consciousness works in the Night Kingdom, and they might be able to draw out the monster responsible for the problem.

Arriving at the totem, the group begins to purify it when an [[Abyss Lector: Fathomless Flames|Abyss Lector]] called Comonqui arrives, having eliminated Mallko's spirit. Comonqui is a spectator who wishes to see the opportunity of destruction caused by the Abyss' power and claims that the Pyro Archon refuses to share the "primordial" power with the people and that the concepts she promotes are meaningless. Kachina is initially distraught by its words, but Mualani perks her back up and the two drive away the Lector after a brief battle. Due to Mualani's actions, a spectral entity called [[Tupac]] appears and congratulates her for acknowledging her true self and embodying the aspects of the tribe's Wayob. On making contact with Tupac, Mualani is flooded with memories of the past and realizes that the plan to save Natlan had begun during the cataclysm. 

The totem is likewise purified and the Wayob speaks with Kachina, pleased with her growth before telling her to leave as an earthquake shakes the area. The group race to escape through the beam of light shining through the closing rift, but are a moment too late to reach it. Just as everything seems hopeless, Mavuika appears and shatters the ceiling of the Night Realm, allowing them to return to reality. The others are initially confused as to how she managed to do it (being a projection of her consciousness) and they decide to ask her herself, though it appears that Iansan had a good idea of what happened and is quietly upset.

;Past and Future

Returning to the Speaker's Chamber, Chuychu treats the Natlanese for Abyssal contamination and is fascinated by the Traveler's apparent Abyss immunity, while Paimon is surprised to note that she herself is also completely fine. Mavuika states that they will play an important part in saving Natlan and explains that after the cataclysm, the tribes and their Wayob were weakened and needed to be strengthened again. When the Wayob picked their name bearer, it would be an indication that the tribe was back at fighting strength. By the time the Traveler had arrived, three of the tribes had prepared their heroes; Kinich, Iansan and [[Xilonen]], though they now have a fourth with Mualani. However, parts of the plan failed to reach some of the tribes, and they only have less than a year to find the remaining two people before the nation would be destroyed. She advises patience to find the other two heroes, as pressuring them beforehand could be detrimental to the plan. Mavuika reveals that the keepsakes she had shown them before had traces of Contending Flame in them from their previous owners, which she had sacrificed by burning the entire lot to give herself the emergency boost needed to save them from the Night Kingdom. Having hoped that the Archon wouldn't have to resort to that Iansan feels regret at the loss, but Mavuika states that the items' owners had given them to the Pyro Archons in hopes that they could contribute to Natlan's survival. Had they known the collection would save heroes like themselves in the future, they wouldn't have mourned their destruction. Nonetheless, with Kachina safely returned, the group heads to the inn to celebrate.

At the [[Weary Inn]], Pacal and the others celebrate Kachina's return. During the festivities, Mavuika speaks with the Traveler, and asks them to assist in saving Natlan. Mavuika promises to lend them her support and even forge them an Ancient Name of their own if they accept, which, while stating that such a motivation was not necessary, they naturally oblige with. With their agreement, she prepares to place an order with Xilonen to make one for them. As she is highly skilled, Mavuika is confident Xilonen can find a way to forge an Ancient Name for a non-Natlanese.

In the wilds of Natlan, [[Rezanov]] informs Capitano that the Pyro Archon had lost much of her power and asks if they should take the [[Gnosis]]. Capitano refuses, having acknowledged and respected her win against him and thus refuses to resort to dishonorable means. An unknown person then tells him that Mavuika had decided not to dispel the fog they had created to escape and asks what his next plan of action is. Capitano acknowledges their usefulness before asking them if they had heard something from "here."
