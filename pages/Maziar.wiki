{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Maziar:''' Nice. I'll call it a day and report back to my [[Maryam|aunt]].
:{{DIcon}} Huh?
::'''Maziar:''' My aunt runs a hotel. There's only one hotel in Caravan Ribat, so it should be easy to find.
::'''Maziar:''' I used to live in the city with my parents, but I really didn't have a thing for school, and it was annoying to be pushed by them every day. So I came here to work with my aunt.
::'''Maziar:''' I learned a lot with her, and am getting more skilled at bargaining with vendors than ever.
::'''Maziar:''' This is something you'll never learn from the [[Akasha Terminal]].
::{{DIcon}} Are you heading back?
::'''Maziar:''' Hmm, not now. I just passed a camp of the Eremites, and [[Nasir|he]] was not there. Maybe he went to the hotel looking for me for a drink.
::'''Maziar:''' To be honest, most Sumeru people like to drink, but I'm not used to alcohol. I would feel dizzy after just half a glass.
::'''Maziar:''' But it'd be a lack of decorum to refuse an Eremite. He often comes to invite me for a drink, and I should care about his feelings.
::'''Maziar:''' I'll just stay out of his sight for now.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Maziar:''' Goodbye.
{{Dialogue end}}
<!--
:{{DIcon}} Your aunt, you say?
::'''Maziar:''' Yes, she runs a hotel. There's only one in Caravan Ribat, so it should be pretty easy to find.
::'''Maziar:''' I used to live in the city with my parents, but I really didn't have a thing for school, and it was annoying to be pushed by them every day. So I came here to work with my aunt.
::'''Maziar:''' I learned a lot with her and I'm getting more skilled at bargaining with vendors than ever.
::'''Maziar:''' Even if the Akasha Terminals were still around, that wasn't something they could've taught you.
