'''Downtown:''' Funds provided by [[Childe]]. The sense of stability one gets from its weight also makes one unwilling to part with the money... The face value of each of these gold coins is very large, but they can be redeemed for smaller change at the Northland Bank.

'''A Huge Bag of Mora''' is a Quest Item used in multiple quests. The icon and name are identical, but the descriptions differ.

==Notes==
* The Huge Bag of Mora given by [[Childe]] during the Archon Quest ''[[Downtown]]'' initially contains 50,000 Mora.
** If leftover funds are available at the end of the quest, they can be exchanged for Mora with [[Ekaterina]] at the [[Northland Bank]]. The same can be done with [[Childe and Teucer's Mora Pouch]], from the Story Quest ''[[Teucer's Terrific Tour]]''.
