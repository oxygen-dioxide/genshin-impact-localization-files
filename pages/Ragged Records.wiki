==Dialogue==
===Ragged Records #1===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ragged Records:''' "The records suggest there used to be a prison here. In which case, it actually suits me well."
:'''Ragged Records:''' "I have to admit, it was my own carelessness that led me to getting slashed to pieces by him... 'That's the chosen ones for you' is, I suppose, what should I say? I could feel the {{Color|buzzword|elemental energy}} burning in his blood."
:'''Ragged Records:''' "Next, I guess I'll stick to the plan and {{Color|buzzword|follow the waterway north}}. I have to stick it out until I get to the spot where I hid my supplies."
{{Dialogue end}}

===Ragged Records #2===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ragged Records:''' "The blizzard has died down, which is lucky. Hopefully it's a good sign."
:'''Ragged Records:''' "Finally took [[Ingbert]] out. Wasn't able to deal with [[Luther]] under the circumstances, but with that wound, it shouldn't be a problem."
:'''Ragged Records:''' "Next I'll head {{Color|buzzword|east to where the mountain meets the sea}}. If I can make it that far, I have a chance for survival..."
{{Dialogue end}}

===Ragged Records #3===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ragged Records:''' "Both the boat and the supplies are untouched. I could not have been more fortunate."
:'''Ragged Records:''' "The agreement was that if the news makes it to Mondstadt, [[Priscilla]] should light a torch at Stormbearer Point to warn me."
:'''Ragged Records:''' "I hope it all goes smoothly. If this succeeds, the power to change the way things are will be mine for the taking..."
