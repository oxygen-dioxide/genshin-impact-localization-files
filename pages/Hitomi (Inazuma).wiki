====Dialogue Set #1====
''Available between completing [[As Though Caught in a Dream]] and [[As Though Beholding Illusions]]''
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Hitomi near the "A Little Fox's Daydream" booth)
:'''Hitomi:''' It has been a while, conquerors of the Test of Courage &mdash; or should I call you "{{Traveler}} and Paimon"?
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, you're that... Shrine Maiden from the Test of Courage! The one who likes saying all sorts of weird stuff! So what brings you to the [[Yae Publishing House]]'s stall?
:'''Hitomi:''' Hehe... O'er the land, a darkness falls, and only those our Guuji call, may search the waves of blackest night, and find within a thread of light...
:{{DIcon}} Can I request a translation?
:{{DIcon}} [[Miko]] sent you here again, didn't she?
:'''Hitomi:''' Heh. Our Lady Guuji said that a brave &mdash; and relatively idle &mdash; shrine maiden was needed to guard this place, so I volunteered.
:'''Paimon:''' Heh. Guess your "boldness" does mean that you fit the bill! You did experience that Test with us, after all.
:'''Hitomi:''' And more importantly, my hands have indeed been quite idle since then.
{{Dialogue End}}

====Dialogue Set #2====
''Available after completing [[As Though Beholding Illusions]]''
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Hitomi near the "A Little Fox's Daydream" booth)
:'''Hitomi:''' Our Lady Guuji has instructed us to prepare for the ritual. Let us scatter this dark haze &mdash; for a bright future lies ahead!
:'''Hitomi:''' Conquerers of the Test of Courage, the Mikawa Flower Festival's representative and the representative's representative... For all our sakes, may you emerge victorious once more.
