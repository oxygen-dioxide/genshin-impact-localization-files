==Descriptions==
{{Description|A spicy plant native to Liyue. Merely smelling it makes one hot and thirsty. Despite "Jueyun" being a part of its name, it does not usually grow in Jueyun Karst. The name seems to originate from its spiciness, which makes people want to run to the highest peaks of Jueyun and cool their mouths with chilly air.}}

==Trivia==
* {{Mail Attachments by Category List}}
* [[Manie]] claims that Jueyun Chilies are named that way because they grow exclusively in [[Jueyun Karst]].
** Actual gameplay and the item's description in the [[Archive]] both contradict this: while the majority of Jueyun Chilies are in fact found there, some can also be found near [[Qingce Village]] and [[Stone Gate]].
* Eating them gives [[Bennett]] diarrhea.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Bennett|Least Favorite Food}}</ref> [[Chongyun]] actively avoids them as well because of the adverse effects on him.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Chongyun|Least Favorite Food}}</ref>
* [[Parvaneh]] and [[Xudong]] refer to the Jueyun Chili as the "Jueyun Chilili", and Xudong says that the extra "li" is to highlight its spiciness.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Gourmet Supremos: On the Road}}</ref>
* In the real-life recipe for [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/11473 Wanmin Restaurant's Boiled Fish], red bell peppers are used as a visual substitute for Jueyun chili, even though bell peppers lack spiciness of any kind. The dish's spiciness is derived from a combination of ''{{w|er jing tiao}}'' chilis and {{w|Sichuan pepper}}s.
