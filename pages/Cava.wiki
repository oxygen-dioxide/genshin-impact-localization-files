==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Cava:''' What shall we do later? Should we try racing to see who can get from the town to the big boat faster?
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Cava knows)
:::'''Cava:''' Oh wait! I did see loads of strange, glittering rocks when I went out to play earlier! They were really pretty! Some were dark blue, and others, light blue.
:::'''Cava:''' But... When I came back to grab some tools, [[Yvette|Granny Yvette]] stopped me. Said I was too young to be playing with pickaxes...
:::'''Cava:''' I think it was somewhere hereabouts. Wanna take a look?
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]] marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Cava knows)
:::'''Cava:''' Uh, what do you mean? I haven't seen anything odd...
:{{DIcon}} I haven't got time for that at the moment...
::'''Cava:''' Oh, I get it, you're one of those "people with things to do," like my dad and mom.
::'''Cava:''' [[Sandino|Grandpa]] says that you shouldn't trouble people like that, so I won't bother you anymore. I'll play by myself.
::'''Cava:''' I'm very good at that &mdash; even playing by myself can be a super fun thing!
::'''Cava:''' Well, I guess it's Super Fun Thing Number 2. Number 1 is when [[Navia]] comes around!
:;(Becomes available after {{cx}}{{Verify}})
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Do you need me to tell her?
:::'''Cava:''' You know Navia? Awesome!
:::'''Cava:''' Hmm... Let me think... No, it's okay. Navia is one of those who "have things to do." If I disturb Navia, Grandpa would lecture me again.
:::'''Cava:''' But since you're Navia's friend, you're my friend, too! Have this! I won't take no for an answer!
::;(Obtain {{Item|Pate de Fruit|x=3}})
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about Big Sis Navia...
:::'''Cava:''' She's the one the adults call the Boss.
:::'''Cava:''' But that sounds super serious. Makes her sound like some old guy smacking tables and yelling at people &mdash; that doesn't seem like Navia at all!
:::'''Cava:''' Whenever she's around, the town's a super lively place. Even the grown-ups laugh and are happy.
:::'''Cava:''' Sometimes she even brings some amazing clockwork toys back for Granny Yvette to look at.
:::'''Cava:''' The look on Granny's face when she sees them &mdash; y'know, the kind people have when they want to say something but hold back? It's pretty funny.
;(Available after completing ''[[Masquerade of the Guilty]]'')
:{{DIcon}} About the flood...
::'''Cava:''' Frankly, I was terrified when the water level started rising! But I didn't even have time to react before [[Archenoul]] rushed over and took me away.
::'''Cava:''' Once everything settled down, I thanked her three times, just like grandpa taught me!
::'''Cava:''' I guess only the strong can become a hero like Archenoul, huh?
::'''Cava:''' I have to work hard! I'll run! I'll jump! And I'll swim!
:{{DIcon}} Do your best.
::'''Cava:''' Huh? You don't wanna race me? Alright then.
