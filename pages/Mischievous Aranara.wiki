'''Mischievous Aranara''' are part of the [[Aranara]] located in various areas of [[Dharma Forest]], [[Sumeru]].

There is a total of 8 Mischievous Aranara. They can be spotted with [[Seed Mirror]]s which have been activated using [[Electro]]. If the hiding Aranara is found while the Seed Mirror is still affected by Electro, it will relocate nearby and can be interacted with. After being spoken to, they will not give any reward directly, but instead leave behind two one-time investigation points.

Finding Mischievous Aranara does not require completing the ''Aranyaka'' World Quest series or activating a Sumeru [[Statue of The Seven]], which is a requirement for starting ''Aranyaka'' (the Traveler encounters Aranara for the first time after unlocking any Statue of The Seven in Dharma Forest).
