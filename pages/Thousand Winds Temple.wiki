==Descriptions==
{{Description|The ruins of an ancient amphitheater. A thousand melodius winds gather here, bringing with them countless tales, and carrying those tales far and wide.|Viewpoint, [[Viewpoint/Ancient Thousand Winds Temple|Ancient Thousand Winds Temple]]}}
{{Description|A collection of temple ruins that sits northeast of Mondstadt.<br />According to local legend, millennia ago this area was a temple for worshipping the Anemo God. Though it has been left to waste for centuries, leaving the ruins you see today. If you look closely at some of the stone pillars, you can still faintly make out some elegant carvings.<br />This long-forgotten symbol of commemoration is engraved with the maxim: "Wind brings the seeds of tales, time allows them to take root."|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Exploration], Genshin Impact Official Site}}

==Lore==
According to [[Henry Morton]]'s notes found in the [[Ragged Notebook (Time and Wind)|Ragged Notebook]] (during the quest ''[[Time and Wind]]'')  the temple was associated with not only the worship of the God of Wind (Anemo Archon), but also the [[God of Time]].

The [[Sacrificial Series]] of weapons were once used as props used in ceremonies at the temple, and their lore confirms Henry Morton's belief.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Sacrificial Bow}}</ref>

The temple was built by people seeking divine intervention from the harsh blizzards caused by the conflict between the [[Decarabian]], Lord of Storms; and [[Andrius]], the Great Wolf King of the North.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Sacrificial Fragments}}</ref>
