{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = Ward
|desc_1      = Possesses a non-elemental Ward that shields it from all damage. Attacks by the player's Saurian companion can effectively damage the Ward. When the Ward is destroyed, the Primeval Source Dragon Mech will be paralyzed for a period of time before regaining the Ward.
|caption_1   = Ward Broken

|name_2      = Bombardment
|desc_2      = Charges before releasing a barrage of scorching beams across the arena, dealing '''60% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}.

|name_3      = Claw Combo
|desc_3      = Swipes one of its claws, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}, then slams down the other, dealing '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. Afterwards, there is a chance where the Primeval Source Dragon will shoot fireballs from its other hand, each dealing '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}.<br><br>The player can command their Saurian companion to block the second strike. In this case, the Saurian comapnion will generate a dome barrier and hold up the hand, and the follow-up fireballs are guaranteed to trigger. The player can enter the dome to avoid DMG from the fireballs. While the barrier is active, repeatedly attacking the blocked hand will immediately break the Primeval Source Dragon Mech's Ward. When the barrier's duration ends, the blocked hand will smash down, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}.
