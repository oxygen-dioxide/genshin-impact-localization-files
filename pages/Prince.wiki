'''Prince''' is a [[Wildlife#Cats|Black Cat]] owned by [[Margaret]].

==Profile==
Prince enjoys eating fish, and playing with balls of string. Margaret describes him as a "mischievous little rascal," despite often spoiling him. He also has very keen senses, being able to quickly escape if the Traveler fails to capture him.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Margaret's Longing}}</ref>

In ''[[Margaret's Longing]]'', Prince steals [[Venti]]'s lyre strings and runs off. The Traveler is then tasked to retrieve and return the cat and strings, by coaxing it with fish.
