{{Description|The poster-kitty of [[The Cat's Tail]], this cat may often be found seated atop the bar counter. Its slick fur is jet black, while the hat it wears gives it real character. However, the tale you heard from [[Shuyun]], a [[Liyue]] player, of it being the Duel Saint of Cats must be some other matter altogether...|Description in [[The Cat's Tail]]'s map}}

==Profile==
Prince enjoys eating fish, and playing with balls of string. Margaret describes him as a "mischievous little rascal," despite often spoiling him. He also has very keen senses, being able to quickly escape if the Traveler fails to capture him.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Margaret's Longing}}</ref>

In ''[[Margaret's Longing]]'', Prince steals [[Venti]]'s lyre strings and runs off. The Traveler is then tasked to retrieve and return the cat and strings, by coaxing it with fish.

After [[Genius Invokation TCG]] became popular at the Cat's Tail, Prince began offering assistance to patrons who were there to play the game, assisted by [[Shuyun]].
