==Description==
"I was once a wounded wolf, betrayed by the whole world,"<br />
"But we shall create a new world, one in which no one shall ever be forsaken."

"Dressed in flawless garments as radiant as the midday,"<br />
"We came to the land of silver snow,"<br />
"And sounded the clarion of [[Tsaritsa|Her Majesty]]'s greatness."

"Oft have we walked in the moonless night."<br />
"Oft have we trudged through the gilded sands."<br />
"Oft have we felt piercing enmity in the dark,"<br />
"And oft have we dreamed of lovers in distant hometowns."<br />
"But the pale flame yet burns in our breasts."<br />
"O [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers|Harbingers]], scintillating as polar stars,"<br />
"Guide us ever onward, tireless."

"If your dreams find no acceptance, if you nurse wounds that will not fade,"<br />
"If you end each day discontent, if you burn with fury against false promises,"<br />
"Lift up your eyes to the white, glimmering stars, for that is our banner."<br />
"Join [[Fatui|our ranks]]! Let our marching boots shake the earth like thunder!"<br />
"You who will march with us towards the polestar of the white night, come! We shall never abandon you."<br />
"You who will walk with us into the land of darkness, come! We shall create a new world together."

"Know that the destruction of all precedes the birth of a new order."<br />
"At devastation's end, we will greet a stainless dawn."

==Trivia==
*The characters for Ashen Nightstar {{Lang|ja=白夜極星}} roughly mean "White Night Polar Star" with {{Lang|mini=1|ja=白夜}} referring to the night under the midnight sun.
*As of Version 2.2, Tartaglia wields Polar Star as a [[Trial Character]] during his Story Quest, [[Mighty Cyclops' Adventure!]]
