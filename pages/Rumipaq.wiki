{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Rumipaq:''' So, mountains like this exist in [[Teyvat]]... Living to see victory is such a blessing!
:{{DIcon}} A lover of climbing, I see?
::'''Rumipaq:''' Of course. The mountains are my playground, and the mountaintops are my laurels of victory!
::'''Rumipaq:''' Victories against who, I hear you ask? Why, my former self, of course!
::'''Rumipaq:''' Victory is when the mountains you climb today are higher than those you climbed the day before.
::'''Rumipaq:''' My apologies, this is just how we are in Natlan.
::'''Rumipaq:''' Or should I say, this is how most of us Scions of the Canopy think. If you were talking to the [[Children of Echoes]], they'd probably tell you about heading deep into the mountains, rather than climbing them.
::{{DIcon}} Be careful not to disturb anyone while you're up there.
::'''Rumipaq:''' I know, I know. I was already warned by a young girl out gathering herbs.
::'''Rumipaq:''' Huh. You look surprised. Did you think I didn't know how this place is home to the [[adepti]] of Liyue? Or are you just shocked that I'm making friends with the locals?
::'''Rumipaq:''' To be fair, I'm a little surprised by that last one myself.
::'''Rumipaq:''' That kid was so small she could hardly form a proper sentence, but she climbed all the way up here. Are all people from Liyue born naturally good at extreme sports?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Rumipaq:''' Goodbye, my friend. May all your battles end in victory!
