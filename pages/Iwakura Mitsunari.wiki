{{Lang|'''Iwakura Mitsunari'''|ja=岩蔵光造}}  is an [[NPC]] located in [[Kujou Encampment]], [[Inazuma]], where he can be found on a nearby cliff.

Mitsunari was formerly the Soushu, or clan head, of the [[Iwakura Clan]] and went by the swordsman name {{Lang|'''Kouin'''|ja=光胤}}. He wielded the [[Hakuen Michimitsu Amenoma]], an heirloom blade passed down through the school.

==Profile==
As a member of the Iwakura Clan, he was presumably at the Menkyo Kaiden rank before he succeeded [[Eiin]] as the Soushu of the Iwakura Clan. At some point in his life, he also gained a Vision.<ref group="Note">The description for his blade, Hakuen Michimitsu Amenoma, contradicts this; see the [[#Trivia|Trivia]] section for details.</ref> He continued training the Iwakura Art disciples up until the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] was enacted.

Mitsunari's Vision was among those seized, leading him to lose his ambition and even some of his memories. When [[Okazaki Toraemon]] and [[Yanagiha Arashi]] argued with him about the injustice of Inazuma's new policies, Mitsunari expelled them.<ref group="Note">[[Okazaki Toraemon#Dialogue|Toraemon and Arashi's dialogue]] is a bit confusing in the English version, as they first refer to Eiin as "Master Eiin," before speaking about their expulsion by "Master." The Chinese and Japanese versions are clearer that the two instances of "Master" are different titles.</ref> After war broke out between the [[Shogun's Army]] and the [[Watatsumi Army]], Mitsunari chose to disband the school and serve the Shogun's Army as a [[Kujou Clan]] sword instructor for reasons unknown even to himself. The other disciples also deserted him and became ronin, much to his confusion and sadness.

While venturing through Inazuma, the [[Traveler]] encounters and kills the rogue disciples in self-defense. After meeting Mitsunari, they inform him of his disciples' fates. Aggrieved by their deaths, and ashamed by their inability to defeat a self-taught swordsperson, Mitsunari challenges the Traveler to a duel to the death to avenge his disciples and restore the clan's reputation. He is ultimately slain himself, and his corpse is presumably found and buried by Okazaki and Yanagiha. However, the clan's heirloom blade "Hakuen Michimitsu Amenoma," which had been in Mitsunari's possession, mysteriously disappeared between his defeat and his burial; the Traveler later finds it in [[Enkanomiya]], although how it ended up there is a mystery.

While the Vision Hunt Decree is repealed after the events of ''[[Omnipresence Over Mortals]]'' and people's Visions are returned to them, this does not affect Mitsunari's dialogue or fate due to his role in the Hidden Exploration Objective [[Iwakura Art's Downfall]].

===Personality===
''(To be added.)''

===Appearance===
Iwakura Mitsunari wears a lavender ''shitagi'', indigo ''kobakama'', and he is barefoot in ''waraji'' sandals. His eggplant-colored armor with dark gold accents consists of ''dou'' (breastplate) with the [[Inazuma Shogunate]]'s crest, ''han-kote'' (half-armored sleeves), ''haidate'' (thigh guards), and ''sune-ate'' (greaves). He is also wearing a ''kabuto'' (helmet) with the Shogunate's crest and ''sode'' (shoulder armor) on his left shoulder. <!--Iwakura carries a ''katana'' at his hips on the left side with the blade facing down. (missing?)-->

==Quests and Events==
===Hidden Exploration Objectives===
* [[Iwakura Art's Downfall]]

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before defeating all Iwakura Disciples)
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' Why did I leave the dojo to become [[Kujou Takayuki|Lord Kujou]]'s instructor...
:'''Iwakura Mitsunari:''' [[Yanagiha Arashi|Yanagiha]] and [[Okazaki Kunihiko|Okazaki]], as well as [[Mifune Satoshi|Mifune]]... why did they all leave me...
:{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
*In his dialogue for Iwakura Art's Downfall, Mitsunari states that he once had a Vision but gave it up after the Vision Hunt Decree was enacted. However, the description for Hakuen Michimitsu Amenoma claims that none in the Iwakura Succession (of which Mitsunari was one) had a Vision.

===Etymology===
*Mitsunari's swordsman name, Kouin, is based on the original romanization of his name, which was Kouzou. When the English localization revised it to Mitsunari, his swordsman name was left untouched.
