==Profile==
This particular Yumkasaurus decided to appoint itself as the Saurian companion of a tribesman from the [[Scions of the Canopy]], who was a deceitful courier who fled his tribe after fearing punishment. Knowing that the Saurian had befriended him, he decided to make it guard a [[chest]] that only had a note revealing why he had decided to put it there in the hopes that someone would feed it. It did not know of his motives and simply stood guard faithfully, hoping for him to return.

The plan paid off, as the [[Traveler]] eventually stumbled upon the Yumkasaurus and managed to acquire the chest it was guarding by placating it with food, after which they saw the note and informed [[Wayna]]. Wayna did not reveal its owner's name, believing him to be despicable, but took pity on the Yumkasaurus and would send people to feed it from time to time.
