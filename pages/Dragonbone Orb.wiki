==Lore==
The soothing effects of the Dragonbone Orb can sometimes lead to bad outcomes. In one case, after the leader of the resistance against the [[Sunchildren]], [[Supada no Hiko|Spartacus]], was captured, his organization fell apart. To drum up the funds to reorganize, the remaining members began selling Dragonbone Orbs, which fetched a high price for their calming effects. They quickly saw financial success, but the Dragonbone Orbs' effects also drained the resistance members' will to fight, which lead to the resistance's ultimate disbandment.
