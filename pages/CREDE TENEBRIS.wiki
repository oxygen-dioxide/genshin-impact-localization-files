'''CREDE TENEBRIS''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Wonders of the World]]''. To complete this achievement, the player needs to complete the hidden exploration objective ''[[Locked Gate in the Nameless Ruins]]''.

==Trivia==
<ul>
<li>At the end of the hidden exploration objective for this achievement, the player will find a [[Mysterious Letter]] which has text adapted from {{w|Catullus 58b}}, a poem written by the Roman poet {{w|Catullus}} in regards to his search of his missing friend Camerius. Catullus 58b is believed by some scholars to be part of Catullus 55, which is also about the search for Camerius. In Catullus 55, the next lines after the inclusion of Catullus 58b are:<br />
::tanto te in fastu negas, amice.<br />
::dic nobis ubi sis futurus, ede<br />
::audacter, committe, '''crede luci'''.<br />
''Crede luci'', with ''luci'' meaning "light," is the opposite of ''crede tenebris''. Thus, it may be the case that the achievement's name references this line from the full Catullus 55 poem.<ref>Twitter: [https://twitter.com/monoceroxcaeli/status/1511573517132869632 A detailed analysis and look into the mysterious letter found in the chasm]</ref></li>
