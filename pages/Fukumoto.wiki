;(After completing [[The Strange Tale of Suikou's Tipsy Tincture]])
:'''Fukumoto:''' Welcome, this is the [[Yae Publishing House]] stall that sells children's books specifically.
:'''Fukumoto:''' We've got all manner of [[youkai]] tales here in Inazuma, and tales that feature [[kitsune]], [[tanuki]], or [[tengu]] as the main characters are very popular indeed. We've even received a significant amount of overseas orders.
