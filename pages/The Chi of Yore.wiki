==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|It seems Mt. Qingce is hiding some secrets...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Yan'er)
:'''Yan'er:''' Agh, what terrible luck...
:{{DIcon}} What happened?
:'''Yan'er:''' Oh, Traveler. You've come at the right time. I was just doing some, uh, research.
:'''Yan'er:''' You know the name of this place, right? [[Qingce Village]]?
:'''Yan'er:''' So, how do I say this... Do you understand what "Qingce" means?
:{{DIcon}} Understand... what?
::'''Yan'er:''' Well, its origin and hidden meaning, of course. Should have known you weren't the cultured sort...
:{{DIcon}} It's pretty unique.
::'''Yan'er:''' That's it? "It's pretty unique"? So uncultured...
:'''Yan'er:''' Do you know about the [[Chi]]? According to legend, the Chi was a dragon-like monster that once forcibly occupied this place.
:'''Yan'er:''' When [[Rex Lapis]] &mdash; or, Morax &mdash;defeated it, the Chi's body twisted into rock, its blood turned into water, and its scales became the terraced fields.
:'''Yan'er:''' And in times long past, the word "Chi" also used to mean "Qingce."
:'''Yan'er:''' And, through my long, earnest and rigorous research...
:'''Yan'er:''' I believe that the Chi's corpse may still be on this mountain.
:{{DIcon}} That logic didn't add up...
::'''Yan'er:''' Hmph, don't be so dismissive. Haven't you noticed the giant trees growing in this area? Don't you think that they're a lot larger and sturdier than elsewhere?
::'''Yan'er:''' The locals call these Blood-Fed Trees. They believe that these trees grew by absorbing the Chi's blood, and that the area where they grew are the Chi's eyes.
::'''Yan'er:''' And indeed, the growth of these trees is abnormal.
::'''Yan'er:''' Even if it were not truly the corpse of that monster, there must be something incredible underground...
:{{DIcon}} And what would the corpse be used for?
::'''Yan'er:''' Uses? For a monster's corpse? Do you even have any idea...
::'''Yan'er:''' Ahem! Do you even know how valuable it is for research?
:{{DIcon}} This is your research?
:'''Yan'er:''' Of course! How could I give up on something so... researchable?
:'''Yan'er:''' I say that, but the truth is that I don't have a lot of leads.
:'''Yan'er:''' It is, after all, an antediluvian legend. It's likely that barely anyone even remembers the legend anymore.
:'''Yan'er:''' After all the effort I put into finding these ruins, thinking that I might be able to find something in here...
:'''Yan'er:''' ...It turned out that there's a {{Color|buzzword|Ruin Hunter}} standing guard inside. That's why I said that my luck was terrible.
:'''Yan'er:''' I'd really like to go in and have a look, but it's far too dangerous. I'll probably wait until it leave before giving this a go.
:'''Yan'er:''' Are you looking to go inside and explore, by any chance? Not that I'd stop you, no, but...
:'''Yan'er:''' Please be mindful of your safety. This might be the clue to some treasure, but it's just a legend in the end. Don't pay it too much mind.

;(Talk to Yan'er again, optional)
:'''Yan'er:''' This way, I can... Whoa! Y&mdash;You're still here?
:'''Yan'er:''' I'm going to rest for a while, and then... then I'll be going.
:'''Yan'er:''' Take care of yourself now, and don't push yourself too much. For all we know, it really is just a legend.
----
;(Interact with a Geo Statue prior to starting the quest, optional){{verify}}
:'''Paimon:''' What's this? Did someone put this up here?

;(Approach the Ruin Hunter, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' Yikes! It's a Ruin Hunter!
:'''Paimon:''' Guess we're gonna have to go through this guy if we wanna search in this area.

;(Interact with the "Incomplete writing", optional)
:'''Incomplete writing:''' "With the evil serpent gone from Qingce, the [[Hidden Palace of Zhou Formula|magic formula]] that subdued it was no longer in effect. ..."
:'''Incomplete writing:''' "...But the serpent did not perish, and its foul blood congealed within the earth and formed stone, poisoning the world..."
:'''Incomplete writing:''' "...Thus three statues were used to subdue it..."
:'''Paimon:''' ...Just three lines and Paimon's head is hurting. Why are all Liyue's stories written like this?
:'''Paimon:''' But anyway, that bit that goes {{Color|buzzword|"foul blood something something formed stone"}}... does that mean there's {{Color|buzzword|strange stone}} around here?
:'''Paimon:''' Let's take a look around at the {{Color|buzzword|stones}} around here and see if we can find some leads.

;(Open the Precious Chest after solving the puzzle)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow... Paimon can't make any sense of this at all.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon can't tell if it's supposed to be a drawing, or writing, or... some other kind of thing.
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe the locals will have an idea.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's ask around in Qingce Village.
----
<!-- interacting with any one of these NPCs will progress the quest -->
;(Talk to [[Little Liu]])
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Look at this fragment!
:'''Little Liu:''' Ah! You scared me! ...What fragment?
:'''Little Liu:''' What is it? ...You don't know? Go ask Granny Ruoxin, she knows everything.

;(Talk to [[Little Xing]])
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Excuse me, know anything about fragments?
:'''Little Xing:''' Fragments? Mm... I don't know.
:'''Little Xing:''' You should go ask Granny Ruoxin, she might know.

;(Talk to [[Little You]])
:{{DIcon|Quest}} What do you make of this fragment?
:'''Little You:''' A fragment? Uh...
:'''Little You:''' Lemme see... Wow. I have no idea. I've never seen one of these before.
:'''Little You:''' Why don't you go ask Granny Ruoxin?

;(Talk to [[Little Zuo]])
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Can you read this fragment?
:'''Little Zuo:''' A fragment? Hmm... No, I can't read it.
:'''Little Zuo:''' As a matter of fact, I've never seen one in my life.
:'''Little Zuo:''' You should go ask Granny Ruoxin, she might know something about it.

;(Talk to [[Master Lu]])
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Take a look at this fragment?
:'''Master Lu:''' Fragment? What fragment, is it from some toy that was broken?
:'''Master Lu:''' I have never encountered a fragment of this kind before.
:'''Master Lu:''' Perhaps you should ask the village chief. Perhaps she might know something.

;(Talk to [[Pops Kai]])
:{{DIcon|Quest}} I have this fragment...
:'''Pops Kai:''' A fragment, you say? Show me.
:'''Pops Kai:''' This writing... or maybe it's not writing at all. I can't read it, anyway.
:'''Pops Kai:''' Ask the village chief, she's gotta know something.

;(Talk to [[Zhi]])
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Can you read this fragment?
:'''Zhi:''' A fragment? Hmm... No, I can't read it.
:'''Zhi:''' As a matter of fact, I've never seen one in my life.
:'''Zhi:''' You should go ask Granny Ruoxin, she might know something about it.
----
;(Talk to [[Granny Ruoxin]])
:{{DIcon|Quest}} I have this fragment...
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' A fragment of...? Found something curious, have you? Let me see...
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Heh... No wonder you can't make head or tail of it. This isn't writing on here &mdash; it's a drawing.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Long, long ago, before writing was invented, people recorded events with pictures.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Look, this symbol here depicts the Chi &mdash; a legendary beast. It looks like the full symbol must have been very large and complex, this is only part of it. But it's enough for me to recognize it by.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' My guess is that this depicts the battle between the Geo Lord and the Chi. But it's hard to be more specific from just this one piece.
:{{DIcon|Quest}} If you had all the pieces, could you make sense of it?
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Oh, I don't know about that. No guarantee.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' But what I can guarantee is that without all the pieces, I certainly can't make sense of it.
:{{DIcon}} Watch me, I'll find the rest in no time.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Hehe... So much enthusiasm. I like that about young people.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Given what this fragment is showing, I'd say that if you really want to find the other fragments, here's what you should do...
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' According to the legend of the Geo Lord and the Chi, the battle took place at a {{Color|buzzword|great height}}. So you could try your luck on the mountaintops around here.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Beyond that, there are many traces of the battle in this area. {{Color|buzzword|Ruins}} would be a sensible place to look.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' In every conflict there is a losing side. The legend tells that after defeating the Chi, the Geo Lord instructed our forebears to erect {{Color|buzzword|Geo Statues}} to crush the Chi's remaining power.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' I'd guess you would have a higher chance of finding things to do with the Chi in places with lots of {{Color|buzzword|Geo Statues}}.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' For example, there are many {{Color|buzzword|Geo Statues}} erected {{Color|buzzword|west}} of Qingce Village. It's said that's the very spot where the Geo Lord crushed the Chi... Maybe you'll strike lucky over that way.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Once you've found all the fragments, bring them to me. I'll be waiting right here.
----
{{Quest Description|update|You received some clues regarding the mysterious fragments from Granny Ruoxin. One fragment is in "the highest point" in Qingce Village, another is in a nearby "ruin," and the clue to yet another may be found in the Geo Statue to the west of Qingce Village.}}

;(Talk to Granny Ruoxin again, optional)
:{{DIcon}} Remind me about the fragments?
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Forgotten already? Well, I do have a habit of rambling on and on I suppose...
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' If you're looking for fragments connected to the great war, you may have more luck searching in high-altitude places.
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Also, you should head west and take a close look nearby the Geo Statues.
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Finally, it can't hurt to check the ruins in this area.
:{{DIcon}} What makes you so sure?
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Hahaha... I never said I was sure, now, did I?
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Let's just say that at my age, you sometimes find yourself remembering things that most people have forgotten.
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' When I was a child, everybody knew the tale of the Geo Lord Suppressing the Chi.
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' But some people say that even the Geo Lord himself couldn't wipe out the Chi completely, and so Geo Statues were used to press it down, slowly crushing it to death over time.
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Haha. But of course, it's just an old story. If there was really a chance the Chi is still alive, we would hardly feel safe living here in Qingce Village.
----
;(Interact with the "incomplete writing" near the Geo Statues, optional)
:'''Incomplete writing:''' "...Rex Lapis overcame the Chi, but the Chi could not perish in its entirety. Thus did Rex Lapis conquer each of its facets in turn: its spirit was bound in the {{Color|buzzword|north}}, its bones were pinned in the {{Color|buzzword|south-east}}, its flesh was incarcerated in the {{Color|buzzword|north-west}}, its soul was fettered in the {{Color|buzzword|north-east}}, and its form was crushed in the {{Color|buzzword|south-west}}..."

;(If the statues are activated in the wrong order)
:'''Paimon:''' All the lights went out... Did we do it in the wrong order?
----
;(Interact with the "incomplete writing" at the highest point of Qingce Village, optional)
:'''Incomplete writing:''' "...Its bones pierced, its spirit faded, its form and soul both decimated... still did its flesh survive..."
:'''Incomplete writing:''' Here stands this statue, to {{Color|buzzword|watch in each direction}}: the {{Color|buzzword|[[Stormterror's Lair|wind-swept ruin]]}}, the {{Color|buzzword|[[Dragonspine|snow-capped peak]]}}, the {{Color|buzzword|[[Mt. Aocang|adepti's abode]]}}, and the {{Color|buzzword|[[Liyue Harbor|city of Liyue]]}}...

;(If the statues are activated in the wrong order)
:'''Paimon:''' All the lights went out! Did we light up the wrong Geo Statue? ...There's so many, how do we find the right one?

;(Upon obtaining all 3 fragments)
:'''Paimon:''' That makes three fragments we've found. And it looks like they match up...
:'''Paimon:''' So we just need to put them together, and... Nope. Still makes no sense to Paimon.
:'''Paimon:''' Guess we do need to ask the locals after all, huh...
----
{{Quest Description|update|You found the three fragments after searching the area around Qingce Village. These three fragments seem to combine to form a complete picture... but you may need to find someone to decipher the picture if you want to understand its hidden meaning.}}

;(Talk to Granny Ruoxin)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} I have some fragments...
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Let's see now... Why, these fragments all fit together.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' See here, this is the symbol for a Chi, and this Chi was defeated in a major battle.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Afterward, it was pinned down in a deep place.
:{{DIcon}} What's a Chi?
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' In the legends, the Chi was a dragon-like monster, and Mt. Qingce was once its lair.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' <!--"Thanks to Rex Lapis defeating it" <- the dialogue in the previous edit. The dialogue in-game isn't like this, did the quest change, or was this added wrongly?-->When Rex Lapis &mdash; or, Morax &mdash;defeated{{sic}} it, the Chi's body twisted into rock, its blood turned into water, and its scales became the terraced fields.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Do you see those sturdy trees near Qingce Village? Those are Blood-Fed Trees, said to have been nourished by the blood of the Chi.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' But a legend is a legend. After all, who would be able to find traces of the Chi today?
:{{DIcon}} What happened after that?
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' After that... in order to seal the corpse of the Chi and prevent it from endangering the world again, water was used to seal its corpse, and treasures were used to pin it in the center of the vault...
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Hmm, the rest of it is illegible.
:{{DIcon}} Does the Chi's corpse still exist?
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' I'm afraid that other than Rex Lapis, no one else knows the answer to that question.
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' So, young one, do you think that the things recorded on these three fragments are true?
:{{DIcon}} Vaults... Treasure!
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Haha, young one... you can't resist the thought of treasure, can you?
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' So, do you think that the things recorded on these three fragments are true?
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Well, it's not a bad thing for a young person to bumble around a bit.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' But if you really want to pursue your search according to the content of these fragments, then I say that the place you're looking for must have something to do with {{Color|buzzword|water}}.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Not only that, but it must also be {{Color|buzzword|water}} whose {{Color|buzzword|entrance}} can be blocked.
:{{DIcon}} Is it... a waterfall?
:{{DIcon}} Is it a pool...?
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Let me think... Come to think of it, there is a sizable waterfall northwest of Qingce Village. I wonder if it has something to do with that vault...
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Well, that's all I know. As for the rest, you'll have to mull it over yourself.

;(Talk to Granny Ruoxin again, optional)
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' The Chi remains a shadow that haunts us. To think that someone would have designs on its corpse!
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' ...Well, I can only hope that it's just that bunch of two-bit crooks. But if there truly is something down there...
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' ...ah, Geo Lord, protect us...
----
{{Quest Description|update|According to Granny Ruoxin, if Qingce Village really houses treasure, a clue for that may be found near the waterfall north of the village...}}

;(Approach the gate)
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, there's some kind of indent in the door...
:'''Paimon:''' Is something supposed to go in there?

;(Interact with the gate)
:'''The Hidden Gate of Qingce:''' (The stone gates are tightly shut, and there are three strange grooves on its surface. Perhaps they are the key to opening the gate...)

;(Enter the vault)
:'''Paimon:''' Is this... That place in the fragment? The one where the Chi's corpse is?
:'''Paimon:''' Wh–What's that? It looks dangerous... Feels like if we don't tread carefully, we'll set something off...

;(Approach the mechanism)
:'''Paimon:''' Uh-oh, behind you! It's the Treasure Hoarders!
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh. We seem to run into these guys every single time there's treasure involved...

;(After completing the Qingce Cache challenge)
:'''Paimon:''' ...So that's it? Aw, but what about our monster corpse? And our treasure?
:'''Paimon:''' Surely a place this big can't be completely empty? And think of all the effort we've put into this...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Shall we give it another once-over, just to be sure?
<!-- camera pans towards room at the back of the cave -->
----
{{Quest Description|update|The gates of the vault have opened. Who knows what treasures lie in wait within...}}

;(Talk to Granny Ruoxin)
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' You're back. So, did you find anything?
:{{DIcon}} Not a thing.
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Hahaha. It's alright, not to worry, there is nothing wrong with a bit of extra running around while you're young enough to handle it.
:{{DIcon}} We found a whole bunch of Treasure Hoarders outside.
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Treasure Hoarders? Did you chase them off?
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Those low-down, no-good crooks, always skulking about. They're so annoying. It's high time someone taught them a lesson.
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' And there was... nothing inside? Hahaha, no matter, no matter at all. {{sic|there}} is nothing wrong with a bit of extra running around while you're young enough to handle it.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Here, these are for you. You've been out and about all day. Go buy something nice to eat, and rest your legs a bit.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' So there was nothing inside... That's good, that's good...
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
* The Qingce Cache challenge can be repeated freely after completing this quest, but there are no additional rewards.
* Before Version 1.6, the quest was named "The Chi of Guyun," erroneously giving the impression that the quest was related to [[Guyun Stone Forest]], which is located on the other end of Liyue. However, the Chinese quest name uses {{zh|古云|rm=Gǔyún|tl=ancient tales, sayings,}} whereas Guyun Stone Forest uses {{zh|孤云|rm=Gūyún|tl=lone cloud}}; they are two different terms and shouldn't be conflated. The quest was renamed in English to "The Chi of Yore" to correct this.
** In Version 1.6, the Traditional Chinese version of the game also updated the quest name to use {{zh|t=古云|tl=ancient tales}} instead of {{zh|t=古雲|tl=ancient cloud.}} While Traditional Chinese distinguishes between {{zh|t=雲|rm=yún|tl=cloud}} and {{zh|t=云|rm=yún|tl=to talk, to say,}} Simplified Chinese &mdash; which is the game's original language &mdash; uses {{zh|云}} for both definitions. The Traditional Chinese translation interpreted the name to use the more common definition, "cloud," but chose incorrectly and corrected it in Version 1.6.
