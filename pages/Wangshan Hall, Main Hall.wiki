{{Quests by Category List|Wangshan Hall Quests&World Quests|not=}}

==Interactables==
==="Manuscript of Martial Ways: Way of the Rain Cutter"===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''"Manuscript of Martial Ways: Way of the Rain Cutter":''' "When the sword is unsheathed, raindrops unite and float like drifting blossoms. That is key to the Way of the Rain Cutter..."
:'''Annotations in Free-Spirited Handwriting:''' "I get it now! I must let the rain accumulate on the blade! That means that I must train on rainy days!"
:'''Annotations in Crooked Handwriting:''' "In my humble opinion, there are quite a few problems with this..."
:'''"Manuscript of Martial Ways: Way of the Rain Cutter":''' "Those who perform Rain Cutter unleash this technique's power with their hearts and eyes, not merely with the sword they wield. A true master of the technique carries an imposing aura without relying on any formidable weapon. When they unsheathe their swords, what catches the eye is not the blade-edge's glint but a rainbow piercing through the sunlight."
:'''Annotations in Free-Spirited Handwriting:''' "I've got it! I've got the hang of it! I mastered the way of wielding Rain Cutter with my heart and eyes. Haha, I did it!"
:'''Annotations in Crooked Handwriting:''' "After many experiments, I have discovered that this training method is problematic... Do not try..."

==="Record of the Guhua Masters"===
:'''"Record of the Guhua Masters":''' "All who are admitted should learn from the story of Grand Master Guhua and delve into Life Ender, the fusion of spear and the sword, and defend the roads by eliminating evil during their travels. These records are kept to encourage the newly admitted students..."
:'''"Record of the Guhua Masters":''' "Grand Master Guhua... Master of Spear and Sword..."
:'''"Record of the Guhua Masters":''' "The 3rd Master... with a profound understanding of martial knowledge... wrote the Manuscript of Martial Ways..."
:'''"Record of the Guhua Masters":''' (The tome is really old, and most of the writing cannot be discerned.)

==="Compendium of the Hundred Arts"===
:'''"Compendium of the Hundred Arts":''' (This ancient tome contains over a hundred training methods for esoteric acrobatic techniques, such as swallowing swords, breathing fire, and jumping over or weaving between sharp blades.)
:'''"Compendium of the Hundred Arts":''' "The Guhua collection holds chivalry to be our spirit, martial knowledge our bones. These esoteric techniques are simple, small tricks. Those who read this text must be careful not to lose sight of the big picture."

==="Nine Swords of Xuanlian"===
:'''"Nine Swords of Xuanlian":''' (A novel of martial chivalry with an aged cover and lots of annotations written between the lines.)
:'''"Nine Swords of Xuanlian":''' (The book described how Wufeng, the main character, fell off a cliff while gathering herbs, but ended up learning incredible techniques and becoming a hero of their time through a twist of fate.)
:'''Annotations in Childish Handwriting:''' "An unexpected twist... The rusty sword bought from a roadside vendor turned out to be an extremely powerful blade! Huh. Maybe I should go to the market more often myself."
:'''Annotations in Neat Handwriting:''' "Falling off a cliff, only to find a secret tome full of techniques? The beggar in the village was actually a grandmaster in hiding? Too cliche. This wouldn't fly with modern readers."
:'''Annotations in Crooked Handwriting:''' "Hmm... But the part where the invading fiends were driven back by the main character, who had been living in solitude there... That wasn't half bad."

==="Key to Martial Principles"===
:'''"Key to Martial Principles":''' I... Guhua... Aloof... Spear.
:'''Paimon:''' Um, is this... Some kind of talisman? No, there are some words faintly written on this...
:{{DIcon}} The handwriting looks like cursive script...
::'''Paimon:''' No, this is beyond cursive! Paimon can't read any of this!
:{{DIcon}} At least talismans have legible writing on them!
::'''Paimon:''' Well, yeah...

==="The Three Snacks You Absolutely Must Try in Yilong Wharf"===
:'''"The Three Snacks You Absolutely Must Try in Yilong Wharf":''' (The colorful pamphlet describes the three most famous snacks in Yilong Wharf in great detail with pictures and words.)
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's getting a little hungry looking at these. {{Traveler}}, do you want to try them out later?
:'''Paimon:''' ...Wait, why is this in the Arcane Archive?

==="Guhua Notes"===
:'''"Guhua Notes":''' ...Practicing the Light Piercer technique. Destroyed all the dummies by mistake... No money or resources... I've got an idea. I'll tie straws together to make my own...
:'''"Guhua Notes":''' Gathering straw.
:'''"Guhua Notes":''' Tying straw. Exhausting.
:'''"Guhua Notes":''' ...Practicing the Light Piercer technique. Destroyed all the dummies by mistake... I might as well train with the sword first.
:{{DIcon}} Continue reading.
::'''"Guhua Notes":''' ...Bored. As I sat before the courtyard, I felt slightly hungry... I pondered on what I saw the other day, and I suddenly felt enlightened. If I use the sword... (indiscernible) I'll call it Rain Cutter. I'll try it another day.
::'''"Guhua Notes":''' ...I accidentally fell while practicing Rain Cutter. Luckily, it's nothing serious... I thought of an idea. Why not dig a deep pond below the piles? Not only will it prevent injuries from falls, but I can raise fish for food...
::'''"Guhua Notes":''' ...I went to a fisherman and bought dozens of fish... I tried to cook them. Their deliciousness was unrivaled...
::'''"Guhua Notes":''' (The next ten or so pages are dedicated to detailed records of cooking methods for fish, and some are even paired with illustrations.)
::'''"Guhua Notes":''' ...Accidentally fell while practicing Rain Cutter.
::'''"Guhua Notes":''' ...Success.
::{{DIcon}} Continue reading.
:::'''"Guhua Notes":''' ...The spear and sword must be wielded with the same mastery as... (Indiscernible. There is a comment from the 3rd Master beside it: second nature.) ... And that, is the truth... Yet there is none... How shall it be granted? How shall it be revealed?
:::'''"Guhua Notes":''' ...Renovate the library. Design... within, and...
:::'''"Guhua Notes":''' ...Look with the {{Color|buzzword|eyes}}, and combine {{Color|buzzword|scrolls of knowledge from all places}} with {{Color|buzzword|chambers of all corners}}, then...
:::'''"Guhua Notes":''' (The next few pages are smudged and unintelligible. There is a comment from the 3rd Master at the side: This advises future generations to read extensively.)
:::{{DIcon}} Continue reading.
::::'''"Guhua Notes":''' ...Recovered from injury. The little Bai kid visited with mutton and fish. Plump, delicious, and without any pungent smells. I asked for the recipe... Passed down the Life Ender technique... Recorded here.
::::'''"Guhua Notes":''' (The following pages contain detailed records of various methods of cooking mutton.)
:::{{DIcon}} I've had enough. It's such a mess...
::{{DIcon}} I've had enough. The training process isn't recorded at all...
:{{DIcon}} I've had enough of this nonsense...
