;(Follow the path)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' It looks like no one's set foot on this road for quite some time...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I agree. And the further we get, the more I feel like this place is a whole lot bigger than we imagined.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, there's something strange up ahead... Let's check it out!

;(Approach the sphere of water suspended in a branch)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, it's a big ball of water...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 klee 01.ogg}} '''Klee:''' I wonder what it feels like? Can I touch it?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's so big that we could probably pass straight through it!
:{{DIcon}} And that was the last we ever heard from Paimon...
:{{DIcon}} Watch out, you might get gobbled up by the water-ball monster...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wah, that's so scary! Stop giving Paimon the heebie-jeebies!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Let's not touch it for now. We still don't know enough about our environment.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But we can't just do nothing at all, because then... nothing at all will happen.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hmm... I have a feeling that this could be the core that sustains this entire bottle-domain.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' In which case the moment we touch it, this place will instantly revert to its original size... with all of us still inside.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Yikes...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, okay, Paimon won't touch it, geez!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Kaeya... Are we really gonna get squished inside a bottle?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Of course not, Klee. I'm sure the real core of this domain is hidden away in a very safe place.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Somewhere like... over there, for example.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' (Ah! I was so nervous that I didn't notice that big wheel at all!)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Wait! Who goes there!
:'''???:''' Gurgle!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's... It's the waterball monster! Ah, the waterball monster is real!
:'''???:''' Gurgle...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' It doesn't seem hostile... In fact, don't you think it looks happy to see us?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' R&mdash;Really? Uh, you're sure it's not gonna gobble up Paimon whole?
:'''???:''' Gurgle...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' I don't think it's hungry! Are you, Water Droplet?
:'''Water Droplet:''' Gurgle...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Oh dear. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm not understanding a word of this.
:;(The water droplet teleports away)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 klee 04.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Wait, don't go! Wait for us!
:;(It stops on a lower platform)
:'''Water Droplet:''' Gurgle...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Why'd it stop?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 collei 06.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Maybe it can understand us after all?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Oh, I get it now! It's leading the way for us &mdash; just like the cats in Mondstadt!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 collei 07.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Like the cats...? How so?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 kaeya 06.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' When you're walking around in Mondstadt city, sometimes a cat will show up on the side of the road.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 kaeya 07.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' It'll walk ahead of you for a while, and if you're curious enough to follow it, you'll soon find yourself in front of a fine establishment called:
:{{DIcon}} The Cat's Tail!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 1 kaeya 08.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Exactly. So let's see where this Water Droplet takes us. It could be interesting.

;(Approach the Water Droplet)
:;(The water droplet teleports again)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It went this way, right? Hope we haven't lost it...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did the Water Droplet go into that cave?

;(Approach the Water Droplet)
:'''Water Droplet:''' Gurgle.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, another strange contraption... And there's a weird-looking wall over there.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' This kinda looks like that ball of water we saw earlier...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Did the Water Droplet bring us here because it wants our help with something?
:'''Water Droplet:''' Gurgle...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 klee 01.ogg}} '''Klee:''' What? Your friend is trapped in the wall!?
:'''Water Droplet:''' Gurgle...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Don't be sad, Water Droplet! We're here now, we'll save your friend!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You bet! But, how're we gonna save them? Do we have to break down this wall somehow?
:'''Water Droplet:''' Gurgle!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Nope, we can't do that! No breaking the wall.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hmm... Do we need to find a key of some sort, then?
:'''Water Droplet:''' Gurgle!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh no! Where'd it go?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Look, the device has lit up. And it's projecting images onto the wall.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' A two-dimensional space... with objects of the same composition as the device nested inside...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 klee 04.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yep! What Kaeya said! And that's where its friend is.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' But how exactly do we enter the image on the wall?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Maybe... we just copy what the Water Droplet did?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Umm... But what does that mean?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hold on, I think Klee's onto something.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Since the Water Droplet appears to be the key that activated the mechanism, we may be able to follow it inside simply by touching the device.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' The principle is no different than how we entered this bottle domain.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Fair enough... Okay, deep breath, then head in!

;(Approach the top of the stairs within the Preprint)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, you really entered the wall.

;(Approach the obstructing crate)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, there's a box blocking your way... Wait, is it a reflection of this box in front of the wall? {{Traveler}}, come back out for a second.

;(Move the box outside of the Preprint)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aha, the box on the wall moved, too!

;(Open the lower chest)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 klee 06.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Wow, another Water Droplet just came out from the wall...

;(Finish the Preprint puzzle)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It was flat as a pancake in there, but as soon as it came out, it turned all plump and round...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, guess it makes sense that the Water Droplet's friend is also a Water Droplet.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Aw, and they both do the same thing to show they're happy.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, Water Droplet number two ran off...
:'''Water Droplet:''' Gurgle!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 klee 07a.ogg}} {{A|vo yqeq202 2 klee 07b.ogg}} '''Klee:''' It's saying thank you, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} Honorary Knight, that was a huuuuge help.
:{{DIcon}} It was nothing!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' {{Traveler}}, how do you feel after entering that two-dimensional space? Any... physical side effects?
:{{DIcon}} No, I feel the same as ever...
::{{A|vo yqeq202 2 paimon 13a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You sure seem fine to Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} Ah, the pain! I've been squished flat like a Traveler pizza!
::{{A|vo yqeq202 2 paimon 13b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmph, quit while you're behind. You're clearly fine.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Well, I'm just glad that you're okay.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good thing Eula's here to look out for everyone... Can't say the same for you though, Kaeya. You were pretty quick to send the Traveler inside...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 kaeya 06.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hey now, I only suggested that because I was confident that {{Traveler}} would be fine.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 klee 08.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Water Droplet, is there anyone else here besides you and your friend?
:'''Water Droplet:''' Gurgle?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 klee 09.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yep, y'know, anyone who looks like me or my friends.
:'''Water Droplet:''' Gurgle!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, it ran off again... Hopefully this is a good sign.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 2 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Amazing... C'mon, let's follow it!
----
;(Approach the town)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' It looks like there might be a town up ahead.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Huh, maybe more people live in this domain than we thought...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 01.ogg}} '''Klee:''' And maybe that's where Aunty Desert lives!

;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Idyia, the situation is now critical. Our window of opportunity to fix this is rapidly closing.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''???:''' I'm sure you've noticed just how much things have deteriorated in recent days.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 01.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' B&mdash;But, even so...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''???:''' This is your home. Are you really going to let everything fall to pieces?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 02.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' I... Well, I live here, but it doesn't actually belong to me...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Paimon knows that voice...
:{{DIcon}} Definitely sounds like someone we know.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kokomi 04.ogg}} '''???:''' Anyone else who comes into this domain in the future will take one look at the ruins before them and conclude that this place was abandoned years ago.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kokomi 05.ogg}} '''???:''' But just imagine how different things could be if you maintained this domain in perfect condition. Whoever sets foot inside would witness a magical wonderland...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kokomi 06.ogg}} '''???:''' How miraculous it would feel to them to find such unimaginable beauty in the middle of a lifeless desert.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 03.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' *sigh* You're right, General, truly, but&mdash;
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kokomi 07.ogg}} '''General Sangonomiya?:''' Act now, while you still can. You have to stand up to this, and break free from your despair.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kokomi 08.ogg}} '''General Sangonomiya?:''' The most important thing is to have no regrets in the end.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 04.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Huh... Heh, well... No one CHOOSES to have regrets, do they...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 05.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' But I take your point... I'll try my best to stop running away.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 06.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' But the question remains of where to begin...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon's figured out who it is.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 02a.ogg}} {{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 02b.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Is it {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} Honorary Knight's friend from a faraway land?
:{{DIcon}} She's a Divine Priestess...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' A divine priestess? What's that? Is it a kind of mage?
:'''Water Droplet:''' Gurgle...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 07.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' What are you doing here? Huh...? We have new visitors?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 08.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Greetings, everyone. This is the Veluriyam Mirage, and I'm the caretaker, Idyia...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 09.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' I'm so sorry that you have to see this domain in its current state of disarray. We are actively working on repairs, and everything will be back to normal shortly! Um, I hope...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kokomi 09.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Greetings, everyone. I guess I should introduce myself, too&mdash;
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 10.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' It's all right, just leave the introductions to me.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kokomi 10.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' (Hmm? I kinda wanted to say hello in my own way... But no harm done, I guess I'll let her do the honors.)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 11.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' This lady is a visitor to the domain, just like yourselves. She is a formidable military general.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 12.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Have any of you heard of Inazuma's "Onmyou Chamber"?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' The... what chamber?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 13.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Onmyou chamber. It's an elite training academy for gifted students of [[Onmyoudou]]. Practitioners are divided into four classes, A through D, and assigned the power of shikigami based on their mastery of the art...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kokomi 11.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Ah... Wait...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 14.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' This lady famously led the class D underdogs to victory against the class A favorites in the final mock-campaign before graduation, an astonishing feat that few in the history of the academy have ever achieved. Hence, "formidable general" is no exaggeration!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 15.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Isn't that right, General? Uh... What's wrong?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kokomi 12.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Wait, so the favorites were beaten by the... classy underdogs...? Paimon's not completely following...
:{{DIcon}} ...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Those all sound like tropes from some Inazuman light novels!)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 04a.ogg}} {{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 04b.ogg}} '''Klee:''' That doesn't sound like the "Divine Priestess" {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} Honorary Knight was talking about.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' (Uh-oh, did she just get caught lying in front of someone she was trying to impress? Or... maybe she uses a different identity in her private life, and this is the first time her friends are learning about it...)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' (Seems... kind of embarrassing, but also kinda cool... I guess having someone else to introduce you is a good way to make an impression...)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 collei 06.ogg}} '''Collei:''' (Hmm, maybe I'd fit in better with everyone if I had a title, too?)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kokomi 13.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Ahem... Some people call me a general, but it's just their way of showing respect. My actual name is Sangonomiya Kokomi.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 16.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Huh? Oh no... Sorry, my mistake, General... Uh, I mean... Miss Sangonomiya?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kokomi 14.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Call me whatever you like, Idyia. The only important thing about names is knowing who's who.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Oh, I get it now! It's like that story that Mom told me that time!
:'''Water Droplet:''' Gurgle?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 06.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Klee can explain! So basically, in the story, a big group of people go on an adventure to Bottleland. One of them's called the "king," and some of them are called "knights"!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 07.ogg}} '''Klee:''' So Miss Sangonomiya must be the super smart one who solves all the problems in the story... Um... What's that one called again?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Perhaps a "sage"?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Indeed, wisdom is an important attribute found in military generals.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 08.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Okay, well I'll just call you that! Hehe, Miss General it is!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kokomi 15.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Fine by me. It sounds really cute, coming from you.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kokomi 16.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' (At least... cuter than my pen name, that's for sure...)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kokomi 17.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Well then, how should I address the rest of you?
:{{DIcon}} Old friend for me... I hope!
:{{DIcon}} Comrade-in-arms... unless you've forgotten!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kokomi 18.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Hehe, how could I ever forget you? But what about these esteemed ladies and gentlemen accompanying you? I'd be delighted if you could introduce me to them, too.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 09.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Wait, Klee wants a title, too! Hmm... okay, got it. Klee wants to be a Mage! The kind that flies around everywhere. Da-da-da! WHOOSH!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 10a.ogg}} {{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 10b.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Kaeya can be the "Master Thief," {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} Honorary Knight can be, uh... the "Knight." And Paimon will be the "Fairy" who follows the Knight everywhere.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Master Thief, huh? I did like playing pirates as a child, so I suppose this is an apt role for me. And I must admit, the "Master" part is a nice touch.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Hold on a second! Are you saying the position of "Knight" is now filled?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 11.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Eula can be the "Swordmaster," who can cut through anything and also gets to wear a super sparkly cape!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Hmph. That's more like it.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 12.ogg}} '''Klee:''' And Collei can be, umm... the "Healer."
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 collei 07.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} ...If you wanna be the Knight, we can swap.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 collei 08.ogg}} '''Collei:''' No no, I don't mind, Healer is a great role! I just don't know if I'm qualified to be one...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 collei 09.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Whenever I'm thinking of titles for myself, I usually imagine myself as an "adventurer" or "musician." I never thought I could be a Healer... I mean, it feels like it should be Master Tighnari's role, if anyone's...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 13.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Don't worry, Collei, you'll be the bestest healer ever! You don't talk much, but you're very kind. Just like the Healers in Mom's stories!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' You'll do fine. I heard you're good with bandages. You can patch up a wound, can't you?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 collei 10.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Uhh... I can pitch a tent? Maybe you heard wrong... But I'll do my best! It's my first day filling in for Master Tighnari, but hopefully it's the first of many!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 17.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' This is a great idea... Once a new visitor arrives, they can assume a new identity... then add in some role-playing...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 14.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Oh, we can't leave you out, Miss Idyia! Hmm... There are lots of characters in Mom's stories, but you don't remind me of any of them...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 18.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' That's perfectly okay! I already have a role here anyway, remember? I'm the caretaker.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 15.ogg}} '''Klee:''' I got it, I got it! This wasn't in any of the stories, but you can be the "Mascot!"
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 19.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Mascot...?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Klee, maybe you could think up an even better role for Miss Idyia?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 20.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' A mascot, you say... Isn't that a character that doesn't have to actually do anything, and sits around letting everyone else do all the important work? Incredible, you've seen right through me...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 collei 11.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Sounds like the idea of being lazy is pretty exciting to her...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kokomi 19.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' The Mascot serves to maintain troop morale, Idyia. Don't underestimate your role.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 21.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Ah, alright. I'll be the Mascot, then.
:'''Water Droplet:''' Gurgle?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 22.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' That's right. Thank you for bringing these new friends here safely. You can go off and play now.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 16.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Thanks, Water Droplet! See ya!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 23.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Hmm, Water Droplet? Is that your pet name for it? Haha, I suppose it's as accurate a nickname as any.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' We keep getting sidetracked... but I believe you were saying something about being in a difficult predicament. Is something wrong with the Veluriyam Mirage?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 24.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Ah yes, about that... I'm afraid the entire domain has recently sustained some significant damage...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 25.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' It was as if... the whole world was suddenly flipped upside down. A few components went missing from the core, which sustains the domain, and the impact cascaded out from there.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 26.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Needless to say, many things in the Veluriyam Mirage have now stopped working...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 27.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Just days after I agreed to let my friend's daughter come and visit, too. When she gets here, and sees the state this place is in&mdash;
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 17.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Oh, so you're Mom's friend? Hi, Aunty Desert, I'm Klee! Here, I brought the Magic Invite &mdash; see?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 28.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Huh? Wait, so you're... you're...!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Look how dilated her pupils are... She must be very surprised.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 collei 12.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Yeah, and not in a good way...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 18.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Mom's the one who sent me here! She's the strongest mage ever. She said that her friend lives in the desert &mdash; you live in the desert, so that must be you! Right, Aunty Desert?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 kokomi 20.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Ah, I see. So being a mage runs in the family.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 29.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Aaaah!!!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 30.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' You're... you're Alice's daughter!? Oh, I just want the ground to swallow me up right now... Wait, that's it! I'll hide myself away in the core of the domain! Hide there until this all blows over. See you all in a hundred years!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 collei 13.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Idyia's really going through it! She's like a shriveled little forest fungus, hanging its head in shame!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 eula 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' ...Collei? That's a harsh analogy, where'd all that come from?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 klee 19.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Don't worry, Aunty Desert, Klee's here to help you! And all my friends will help, too! Just take a deep breath, then another deep breath, and all your worries will fly away!
:{{DIcon}} Klee's right. Many hands make light work...
:{{DIcon}} As a Knight, it shall be my honor to render my assistance...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 paimon 04a.ogg}} {{A|vo yqeq202 3 paimon 04b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, don't you worry &mdash; {{MC|m=Sir|f=Lady}} Fixalot over here has a good track record with this kind of thing!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 31.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Well, I'm useless... but it looks like that won't matter with all you capable people around. Fantastic!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't put yourself down, Idyia, you're great too!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 32.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Thanks for your encouragement... Anyway, for the time being, please talk amongst yourselves.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 3 idyia 33.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' That'll give me some time to think things through, and maybe make a start on... um, delegating...

;(Talk to Klee or Kokomi)
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 klee 01a.ogg}} {{A|vo dialog yqeq202 klee 01b.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Hi Miss General! {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} Honorary Knight says that you're from Watatsumi Island...
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' What's it like there? There must be loooads of fish, right?
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Wait! You look kinda like a mermaid. Are there fish in your family?
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Oh, uh... Sorry to disappoint you, Miss Mage, but I'm just an ordinary human.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I have lots of great stories about Watatsumi Island, though. C'mon, let's enjoy the scenery while I tell you all about it.

;(Talk to Kaeya or Collei)
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Feeling nervous, Collei? It's your first time as a guide, after all.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Hmm? Oh no, not at all. I'm just... still settling into the role, so I was thinking about how to talk more like Master Tighnari...
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Well, the easiest way to imitate someone is to start with their most common turns of phrase.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh, okay. In that case... Ahem! "Put that mushroom down! Now! It's highly poisonous."
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' There you go. With just a few simple words, you've captured your master's personality perfectly.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Anyway, what about your role? Don't you mind being the "Master Thief"? It doesn't sound like you're one of the good guys...
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Maybe not &mdash; until you factor in that I only steal from the enemy. I think that's enough to make me one of the good guys... don't you?
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh, uh... fair point, fair point...

;(Talk to Eula or Idyia)
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 idyia 01.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Hmm? Who else has visited the Veluriyam Mirage recently? There was [[Kaveh|someone]] from the Akademiya who came not long ago... a Kshahrewar scholar. Blond hair, architect, I think?
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 idyia 02.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' He was a huge help, and redesigned many of the buildings here. Although he was always grumbling to himself, he was extremely diligent in his work. Ah... What a kind person...
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 idyia 03.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' I could tell that was a sensitive soul, a lot like me... Ah! Sorry, please pretend you didn't hear that... Ahem! I'm of course a very strong and resilient person.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 idyia 04.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' After him, an [[Lessig|aristocrat from Mondstadt]] showed up, then the Gen&mdash; I mean, Miss Sangonomiya.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 idyia 05.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Unfortunately, everything here suddenly started changing before I'd had the chance to be a good host and show them around.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Do you know where the Mondstadt aristocrat is now?
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 idyia 06.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' ...If I remember correctly, he headed north after the incident.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 idyia 07.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' It's a pity we're having all these issues... *sigh* If we could get everything working normally again, I could probably locate him in an instant.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 idyia 08.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Still, not to worry. There's nothing dangerous here.
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Mm...

;(After talking to everyone)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey Idyia, you got an update for us? We've all caught up with each other.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 idyia 01.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Very well. Then please allow me, Idyia, your Mascot, to explain exactly what's happened here...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (She's pretty happy with this Mascot role, huh...)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 idyia 02.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Basically, this entire domain is powered by a device called the Central Hub, which you all saw earlier.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 idyia 03.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' But following a major incident, several key components from the Central Hub came loose and went flying.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 idyia 04.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' ...Four components, I believe, which has caused the Central Hub to stop turning.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 klee 01.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Ohhh, so that thing's supposed to spin?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 idyia 05.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Yes! It definitely shouldn't be frozen still like it is now!&nbsp;...At least, that's not how it was when I first got here? Ugh, I've done such a terrible job of taking care of it, it's so embarrassing...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, everything's gonna be okay. So, we need to fix the big wheel up there, and to do that we need to find the missing parts.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 idyia 06.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Right... I do know where one of the parts is. It landed not too far away.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 idyia 07.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' But the rest all landed in different areas. I'm afraid you'll have to go and look for those...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 idyia 08.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Ahem! Now, as the caretaker and your mascot, I shall announce your respective adventure duties!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Umm... You can just be yourself if you want, no need to force the whole roleplaying thing...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 idyia 09.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' ...Oh, I see... Um, okay, so I was thinking that maybe Swordmaster Eula and Healer Collei could investigate the northern zone, if that's okay?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Fine by me. I was going to be looking for my cousin there anyway.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I'll be your backup, Eula. I know you usually team up with Amber, so I'll try my best to fill her shoes.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Oh? Well this'll be fun. Let's see if a forest ranger can outperform an outrider.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 idyia 10.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Master Thief Kaeya and Mage Klee, if you could earmark some time in your busy schedules to search the west zone...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Earmark? What does that mean?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' It just means we mustn't forget to do it. Don't worry, we can handle that.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 idyia 11.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Finally, we have our General, Miss Sangonomiya, and our Knight, {{Traveler}}. If there's no objections, please come with me to retrieve the first component.
:{{DIcon}} Understood.
:{{DIcon}} You have my sword!
::{{A|vo yqeq202 5 idyia 12b 1.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Wow... Spoken like a true knight.
::{{A|vo yqeq202 5 kokomi 01b 1.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Hehe... Then for my part, my strategic mind is at your service.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 idyia 13.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Alright. Well, if anyone finds anything, come back here and we'll regroup.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 idyia 14.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Please take care while you're out on the road, and look after each other... especially our little mage here.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' You got it! I'll take extra-special care of Kaeya.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' I'll be on my best behavior.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 idyia 15.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 idyia 16.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Okay, we'll leave it there for now. You two, please follow me.

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 idyia 17.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' I remember seeing it just behind the Central Hub...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' ...So how come you didn't bring it back when you first saw it?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 idyia 18.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' I'd have been more than happy to, if this one component was enough to fix the whole domain.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 idyia 19.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' But with three other components to find... I suddenly felt overwhelmed by how much work needed doing...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon kinda gets that... Taking the first step is always the hardest part.

;(Approach the bridge on the floating rock)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, so Paimon's been meaning to ask, what brought you here, Kokomi?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Oh, um... Well, things have quieted down in Watatsumi Island for now, so I thought I'd take the chance to get out and see more of the world.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You've traveled a pretty long way... Why Sumeru?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 kokomi 04.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' ...I figured that I needed to venture farther than usual to really broaden my horizons.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 5 kokomi 05.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Well, that's one reason, anyway... I can explain in more detail another time.

;(Approach the [[Streaming Projector]])
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 idyia 01.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Okay, this is the spot.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 idyia 02.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Now, I'm sure you're both wondering: "But where's the component?"
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 idyia 03.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' "There's nothing here! Oh, where could it be..."
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, it's that lamp thingy, right? Water Droplet showed us how that works already.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 idyia 04.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Uh... yes, that's the one... There goes my big introduction.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 idyia 05.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Showing people the ropes is supposed to be my job... I can't believe I'm being shown up by a Hydro Eidolon...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Cheer up, Idyia. The Hydro Eidolon can give a basic demonstration of how to use things, but beyond that, it can't communicate...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' That's where you come in. Your descriptions can explain everything in full, vivid detail.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon forgot how persuasive Kokomi can be when she really wants to... Sometimes having a genius strategist around really comes in handy.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Now I see how an eloquent speaker can persuade others to not only agree with them, but do things for them...)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 idyia 06.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Oh, if you put it that way... Well then, just pretend like you've never seen it before, and I'll tell you all about it!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 idyia 07.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' This is called the Streaming Projector. Everything here in the Veluriyam Mirage was made using this device...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 idyia 08.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' All you need to do is place an item in the Projector, and you can construct a corresponding item based on the shape of the original and your imagination.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 idyia 09.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' ...At least, I think that's what it used to do. With the domain in its current state, only its most basic functions are still operable.
:{{DIcon}} Basic functions... like shining light?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 idyia 10.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Okay, not quite that basic... At the moment, it's only able to show two-dimensional objects. I call them "preprints."
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 idyia 11.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Think of it like a sort of draft or blueprint, or something.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' So you're saying, the component fell into the preprints?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 idyia 12.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Yes, exactly. I'll leave you to go in and physically retrieve it, while I... Uh, I'll be out here rooting for you by... by doing a motivational dance!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 idyia 13.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' ...No. Sorry. I feel like I have two left feet when I try to dance. I guess I'll just... find a place nearby to sit and wait patiently for you...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, come on, cheer up. We'll handle everything from here!

;(Talk to Idyia again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 idyia 09.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' All you need to do is touch the Streaming Projector and you'll enter the world of preprints...
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq202 idyia 10.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Don't worry. It's not dangerous.

;(Open the first chest in the Prerint)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 idyia 14.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Doesn't look like the component is in here...

;(Open the rightmost chest in the Prerint)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 6 idyia 15.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Yes, that's the one! Now you just need to bring it back out.

;(Leave the preprint after collecting the gear)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What is this thing, anyway? Some kind of gear?
:[[File:Secret Summer Paradise Gear.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo yqeq202 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And why's it so small? It doesn't look like it belongs in that huge wheel...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 7 idyia 01.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' It's hard to explain, but I assure you that it's definitely one of the components.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 7 idyia 02.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' So that leaves three more components missing...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 7 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Every journey begins with a first step. I think we're off to a good start, and things should keep going smoothly from here.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 7 idyia 03.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Y&mdash;You really think so?
:{{DIcon}} Of course, trust the General!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 7 idyia 04.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' I suppose you're right... she did manage to defeat class A at the Onmyou chamber, after all...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 7 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Um... You, uh, don't need to keep bringing that up!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 7 idyia 05.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' Anyway, thank you for all your help.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 7 idyia 06.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' I'll take this and start trying to repair the Central Hub. You two may as well head back to town.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 7 idyia 07.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' *sigh* Why am I so clumsy? Once again, I was no help at all... The least I can do is try and handle the actual repairs.
----
;(Approach the marked location in the Silver Bottle Courtyard)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's wrong, Kokomi?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I'm just a little confused... You mentioned that the Water Droplet showed you how to use the projector?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Can you tell me a little bit more about that? I'm so curious to know what happened.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, sure!
:{{Black Screen|You tell Kokomi everything that happened earlier with Water Droplet.}}
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 kokomi 04.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I see...
:;(The ground shakes)
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, look! The wheel is spinning now.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aww, and now it's stopped again. Well, that didn't last long...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 kokomi 05.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' It also wasn't spinning at the right speed. Before the incident, it spun much faster than that.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so you saw it back when it was still working?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 kokomi 06.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Yes. I arrived here a little earlier than the rest of you. But the incident took place not long after I entered.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 kokomi 07.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Like Idyia said, it felt like the world was "flipped upside down"... I don't know how else to describe it... and I certainly don't want to experience it again.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 idyia 01.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' *sigh* It's no use... Seems it won't run until all the missing components are returned.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 idyia 02.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' For a moment there, when it started turning, I got excited... I thought that maybe the hub can work just fine without the other three...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 kokomi 08.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Wishful thinking is only going to lead to disappointment, Idyia. Let's stick to the plan, we'll get there.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 klee 01a.ogg}} {{A|vo yqeq202 8 klee 01b.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Hey, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} Honorary Knight and Miss General are here! Oh, and our mascot!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' You beat us! I was sure we were gonna be the first ones back!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hey. How'd it go?
:{{DIcon}} Mission complete!
:{{DIcon}} Where a knight's sword goes, victory soon follows!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Haha. Impressive. I doubt you'd find many other knights of such caliber even among the Knights of Favonius.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 idyia 03.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' How about our Master Thief and Mage? Did you find anything?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' You bet! We made a huuuge discovery!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 klee 04.ogg}} '''Klee:''' The place we were trying to get to was blocked off. We couldn't see anything past it, and there was no way around.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' But then, just now, a huge canyon appeared outta nowhere... so we hurried back here!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 kokomi 09.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' It appeared just now?
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 kokomi 10.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 klee 06a.ogg}} {{A|vo yqeq202 8 klee 06b.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Come and see, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} Honorary Knight! Let's go on a canyon adventure!
:{{DIcon}} To the canyon!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 idyia 04.ogg}} '''Idyia:''' I'll sit this one out. I'm beat after trying to make those repairs... I need to take a break.
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 klee 07.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Miss General, you should come, too! You can hide behind me and give me smart advice while I protect you!
:{{A|vo yqeq202 8 kokomi 11.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Wonderful. It would be an honor to serve as adviser for our young mage.
