==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Shitou:''' You there, you're looking radiant today, clearly it must be your lucky day!
:'''Shitou:''' How about it, wanna try your luck betting on jade?
:{{DIcon|Shop}} Do you have anything besides uncut rocks for sale?
::'''Shitou:''' Sure, have a look! These were all cut from raw stone. Although these aren't exactly rare jade, maybe you'll find something that strikes your fancy.
:;(Opens [[Jade Mystery]] menu)
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Shitou/The Stone Tells Ancient Tales|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Shitou:''' Hehe. It seems that you have to keep trying. Come again next time!
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Shitou:''' Not bad, customer. I didn't think you'd be able to pick me apart that easily. Impressive.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Duel
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Shitou/Duel: Shitou|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Shitou:''' Customer, I guess your luck isn't in the cards today. Normally, one'd open an Uncut Stone when they lose. How about one?
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Shitou:''' Customer, you're pretty lucky. Today is definitely going to be a lucky day. Why don't you buy an Uncut Stone when you're done playing?
:{{DIcon}} About Rex Lapis' death...
:;(Unlocks after [[The Fond Farewell]])
::'''Shitou:''' Alas... I wish him all the best...
::'''Shitou:''' But feelings are feelings. We must keep on living, yes?
::'''Shitou:''' Now, I've been thinking &mdash; perhaps I should rename that type of Noctilucous Jade used in the Rite of Parting, as a manner of remembering Rex Lapis by.
::'''Shitou:''' Which do you think sounds better, "Parting Jade" or "Ascending Jade?" I feel like they're about equal...
:{{DIcon}} Betting on jade?
::'''Shitou:''' Oh? This is your first time at The Jade Mystery?
::'''Shitou:''' Here at The Jade Mystery we pride ourselves in our generations of expertise in crafting jade finery. We have quite a reputation in Liyue, even if I do say so myself.
::'''Shitou:''' Though the industry hasn't been as booming recently. The Ministry of Civil Affairs has shut down the Chasm, cutting off supplies.
::'''Shitou:''' As such, the raw materials are worth more than the finished goods these days... So I figured, why not sell the uncut rocks off? Betting on them is exciting, and who knows, perhaps I might just make some money.
::'''Shitou:''' Now all my old card game buddies come here to bet on jade. Business is better than a few other places around here, that's for sure...
:{{DIcon}} Tell me more about this jade.
::'''Shitou:''' Never played before, huh? That's rare.
::'''Shitou:''' These stones were all dug out of the mines. They're generally of better quality. Pick out one that you like and buy it.
::'''Shitou:''' "He who knows the jade, gets paid."
::'''Shitou:''' Don't worry about picking a dud one, there's another saying in the industry &mdash;
::'''Shitou:''' "If your luck doesn't come today, it's waiting for you tomorrow!"
::{{DIcon|Reward}} What's the actual probability of finding jade?
:::'''Shitou:''' Well, that's the million Mora question isn't it? But seriously, it would ruin the game if I knew the probability in every case. A game of probability is nowhere near as exciting as a game of chance!
:::'''Shitou:''' And hey &mdash; even if there's no jade inside, who's to say you won't find something else instead?
:::'''Shitou:''' I kid you not, just the other day a big business owner comes in here, opens a stone, and sure, no jade, but there's a good few chunks of ore in there. Not good enough for him of course, he gives them right back to me without a second look. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the generosity, I've just got nowhere to store them.
:::'''Shitou:''' So how about you take them? My investment in your future, shall we say &mdash; and if you ever want to return the favor, you know where to find my store... hahaha...
::;(Obtain [[Enhancement Ore]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} Gotta go.
::'''Shitou:''' Leaving just like that? You never know what luck you might be giving up.
