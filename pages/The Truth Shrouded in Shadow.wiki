==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|The appointed day has come. You and Paimon go to the Production Zone once more. Lyney will be waiting for you there.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...!
:{{Color|menu|Paimon shakes her head, indicating to Lyney that you should go elsewhere to speak.}}
:{{A|vo fdaq106 1 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...
:{{Color|menu|Lyney catches on, and follows you to the side.}}
:{{A|vo fdaq106 1 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Did you two run into any trouble over the past few days?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, we just worked our shifts according to the schedule. Nothing weird happened.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 1 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Mmm, that's good. That means you didn't raise any suspicions when you infiltrated the infirmary.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 1 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' We've taken a look at the slip you've sent. Freminet successfully left the grounds via the pipes two days ago, and as of last night, [[Lynette]] has also infiltrated the infirmary after faking an illness.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, why is she getting involved as well?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 1 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You already went above and beyond when you scoped out the infirmary. To put it more bluntly, even if we were to view that as something you did in exchange for Freminet's help, you've already done more than enough.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 1 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Infiltrating a guarded stronghold is a different kind of job from a one-off investigation. We want to avoid using the same faces over and over, and reduce the amount of suspicion that will fall on any given person.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 1 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Lynette also felt like you have already taken the first step for us, so she should be the one to finish the job.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's what Lynette thinks... Paimon hopes everything's going well for her.
:{{DIcon}} ...Yeah.
:{{DIcon}} ...I'm not opposed to helping you.
::{{A|vo fdaq106 1 lyney 08b 1.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Perhaps that's true. You are both very good people, and we've come to appreciate that more than anyone else. Unfortunately, there's still one thing that could get between us, lest you've forgotten... The matter of our respective loyalties.
::{{A|vo fdaq106 1 lyney 08b 2.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You've mentioned before that you've had some run-ins with the [[Fatui]]. I can understand that feeling, so I assume you're just helping us out of the kindness of your hearts?
::{{A|vo fdaq106 1 paimon 05b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, everyone could use some more friends! We'll be counting on you to help us in the future too.
::{{A|vo fdaq106 1 lyney 08b 3.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Mhm. Since I see you as friends, then it's even more important for us to protect you from any peril. Freminet and Lynette feel the same way.
::{{DIcon}} ...I get it now.
::{{A|vo fdaq106 1 lyney 08b 4.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Glad to hear it.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 1 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Then... Let's go check on Lynette before Freminet returns. If everything went well, then she should be wrapping up her investigation right about now.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is now really a good time to go over?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 1 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' According to my observations, [[Sigewinne]] always spends around half an hour away from the infirmary right before lunch. Lynette knows this as well, so this should be a good time to meet up with her.
:{{DIcon}} Oh yeah, we heard about that too.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 1 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Also, I'm her brother, remember? It's only natural for an older brother to care about his younger sister's well-being.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, then let's head over right away!
----
;(Approach the infirmary)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 2 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Lynette should be here right now...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 2 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 2 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Strange... Lynette?
:{{Color|menu|Lyney looks around, but doesn't see any sign of Lynette.}}
:{{A|vo fdaq106 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' As expected, Sigewinne isn't here, but... why isn't Lynette here?
:{{DIcon}} Could she have found a lead...
:{{DIcon}} And left to follow it?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 2 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...No, Lynette rarely deviates from the plan. We agreed that if she were to make changes on the fly, she'd find a way to let me know.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 2 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Unless...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's see if there are any clues around here, we can look while we wait for her. Who knows, maybe she'll be back soon!
:{{A|vo fdaq106 2 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Okay.

;(Investigate the medical records)
:{{Color|menu|You find some books and documents on the table...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq106 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There are some books here, and a few files... They all look like medical records.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... "Advanced Nursing," "How to Raise the Spirits of Your Patients," "A Quick Guide to the Psychology of Emotions," and "The Meaning of Laughter"...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' These sure are some interesting books... Who knew Sigewinne would be interested in these kinds of things...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She even has books on understanding people's motivations and feelings... Is it because she's a Melusine? Or does she have a need to understand her patients' emotional state?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 3 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Seems quite normal to me. These are skills that would come in handy for a nurse from time to time.

;(Investigate the hatch)
:{{Color|menu|You find the hidden barrier...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq106 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, this is it, we saw it before!
:{{A|vo fdaq106 4 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Wait, this thing...? It doesn't look like it's been disguised that well.
:{{Black Screen|Lyney leans down to get close to the movable hatch, and starts tapping at several different points on it...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq106 4 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' The space behind it is empty. From its size, I don't think it's an entrance that is meant to be taken apart. There's probably a mechanism around here somewhere.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 4 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Could Lynette have tried to get inside? But if that's the case, she would have contacted me for sure...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 4 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 4 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Let's look around here some more for clues... Don't panic, just.. take another look.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (The look on Lyney's face... He's definitely beginning to panic. "Don't panic"... He probably said that subconsciously more for himself than anything else.)

;(Investigate the beds)
:{{Color|menu|You investigate the sickbeds...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq106 5 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' None of the beds have any signs of having been slept in... except that one over there.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's the one Lynette must have used, right? You said she was pretending to be sick.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 5 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Mhm. She would have said her migraine was having a particularly bad flare-up. Generally speaking, the head nurse would then ask her to lie down and rest, while she left to retrieve the medication.
:{{DIcon}} ...But this bed is still unmade...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 5 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Which means, either the head nurse didn't return the entire time from when Lynette lay down up until she left the bed, or... the nurse intentionally left it this way.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Oh no... That's not a good sign...)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 5 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...
----
;(After investigating the three objects)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, you guys, there's a slip of paper over here!
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' A slip of paper?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's right over here, and there's a bunch written on it, too... It reads...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Out of respect for your usual practices, I'll use a piece of paper or card as the medium to pass on my message. You may consider this as me giving you my best regards."
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' This is...!
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is... Is that all?
:{{DIcon}} Is there anything on the back?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The back... aaah! This... This is...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Show me! NOW!
:{{Color|menu|Lyney runs over to look at the paper...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...!
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Th&mdash;That look on your face... P&mdash;Paimon's reading it now...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Would you care to guess where Miss Lynette of the Fatui could be right now?"
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...No... Could she have... Is she already...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...[[Wriothesley]]... Did he deliberately leave the infirmary unguarded to use it as bait?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, you mean... He was aware of our goals from the very beginning? But why? We didn't run into any trouble last time, and he also never reached out to us since...
:{{DIcon}} Why would he choose to act during our second infiltration attempt instead of the first?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...Yes, that is a crucial question. Wriothesley... He doesn't do anything without a clear goal or reason. So, this means he had no concerns about your activities from the very beginning.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' {{Traveler}}, you are not from the same camp as us &mdash; you were sent down here by Neuvillette, so you have no conflict of interest with Wriothesley. We're a completely different story, though...
:{{DIcon}} Why did he only go after Lynette?
:{{DIcon}} Why didn't he go after you as well?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I'd like to know that, too. Why did he only go after her?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Don't panic, just think everything over... I have to stay calm... This is not like what happened last time, the situation's different now...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' {{Traveler}}, wait, you're right... Wait... But that means...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 lyney 12.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...The fact that Freminet was able to leave the grounds... Could Wriothesley have let him go as well?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But what does he gain by letting Freminet leave like that?
:{{DIcon}} ...I get it now.
::{{DIcon}} He deliberately made them both disappear.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 lyney 13.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...So he's challenging me and trying to provoke me. I'm sure of it.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 lyney 14.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Ugh, we never should have sent out Freminet! We had to go through all that trouble to find an opening to sneak him around the guards and into the pipe, and we even thought luck was on our side...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 lyney 15.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' If Wriothesley let him leave on purpose... Then he's probably in a terrible spot now as well...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lyney's getting more and more panicked... We have to calm him down!
:{{DIcon}} Lyney, calm down!
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't be like this, Lyney. Freminet wouldn't have left if we hadn't told you about Childe... That was our fault...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 lyney 16.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' No, I'm the leader of this operation, and I‘m the one responsible for this team... I was the one who failed to protect them.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 lyney 17.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...I'll go talk to Wriothesley.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, don't be too reckless! {{Traveler}}, please talk some sense into him!
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 lyney 18.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I simply cannot allow Lynette to be abducted again...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 lyney 19.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I have to go, I'll find a way to get them back!
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He's rushed out the door! After him!
:{{Color|menu|Lyney charges out of the infirmary. As you closely {{sic|fallow}}, you fail to keep an eye on the rear...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 sigewinne 01.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' ...
:{{Color|menu|Nine days before, while you and Paimon were planning to infiltrate the infirmary...}}
:;(A flashback begins)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 lourvine 01.ogg}} '''Lourvine:''' Right, I feel like we still have some room to make changes on these details.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 jurieu 01.ogg}} '''Jurieu:''' ...It's not impossible, but it'll require extensive testing.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 sigewinne 02.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Is that so... Very well, then please be mindful of the time.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 sigewinne 03.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' ...!
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 lourvine 02.ogg}} '''Lourvine:''' Is someone...?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 sigewinne 04.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Pack everything up.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 sigewinne 05.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' ...Whoever's outside is eavesdropping. They'll probably come in once we stop talking.
:{{Color|menu|The three clean up, pretending that nothing happened...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 paimon 15a.ogg}} {{A|vo fdaq106 6 paimon 15b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Someone, please help! {{MC|m=He|f=She}}... {{MC|m=He|f=She}}'s sick!
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 jurieu 02.ogg}} '''Jurieu:''' Whoa, are you okay?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 sigewinne 06a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo fdaq106 6 sigewinne 06b.ogg}}--> '''Sigewinne:''' (Ah, these two. As expected, they've already found this place. They're quite sharp.)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 sigewinne 07.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' What a delightful turn of events. I like smart people, but I also like playing dumb. I like the feeling of "being trusted."
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 sigewinne 08.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Oh my! What's wrong, little one? There's no need to panic &mdash; take a deep breath before you begin.
:;(The flashback ends)
:{{Color|menu|Looking in the direction of your departure, Sigewinne finishes her recollection...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 sigewinne 09.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Being able to read human expressions is quite the useful skill.

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lyneyyyy! Waaaaaait!
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's no use, we have to catch up to him!

;(Leave the infirmary hallway)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 6 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He's already out of sight, how is he so fast... Let's go head him off at Wriothesley's office!
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|The appointed day has come. You and Paimon go to the production zone once more. Your cooperation with Lyney continues, but as you enter the Infirmary, you realize that things aren't quite so simple. The Fortress still seems to conceal certain secrets...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Enter the Wriothesley's office)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Come out and face me, Wriothesley!
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 01.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Mmm, aren't we at an administrative office space? Why don't you at least try to follow even a couple rules from the Fortress' Indoor Management Regulations?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' What did you do to my sister!?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 02.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I ran into the young miss at the infirmary. I had heard that she was suffering from quite the migraine, so I decided to invite her over for a cup of tea. I do have some teas in my collection that can work wonders against such an illness.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Stop joking around! Where did you take my siblings!?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 03.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I have also heard that your performances are quite the spectacle. Miss Lynette would sometimes enter a box filled with water, only to emerge the next second from another place altogether.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 04.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Maybe she'll appear behind you right now if you were to turn your head?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' (Is he trying to trick me into turning my head? No, he's probably not looking to attack me right now, all of the hostages are in his hands, and he's even in the mood for small talk. That means Lynette is probably still alive.)

:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 05.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' As for Freminet... No, you probably didn't even interfere with Childe's escape. You let him go, so you could purge the Fatui members that we had planted into your ranks.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 06.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' There was no need to do so. The Fortress of Meropide is a pretty pleasant place. Most people enjoy their lives here &mdash; the only ones who act differently are those with personal agendas. It was quite easy to identify your colleagues.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You removed our original members, and spread the news of Childe's escape, so "[[The Knave|Father]]" would assign our team to come down and investigate. Freminet has also fallen into your hands, right? If you're oh so omnipotent and so in control, why would you need hostages?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 07.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' One correction. Lynette is in my hands right now, but Freminet is not.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' He's not?&nbsp;...What do you really want?
:{{Color|menu|You and Paimon follow closely...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lyney!
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 08.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Oh, wonderful! Everyone is here, so I'll only need to say this once: thank you so much for cooperating with me.
:{{DIcon}} Where are Lynette and Freminet?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 09.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Eager and to the point, {{Traveler}}, I see. Alas, only Miss Lynette is currently having a cup of the Fortress' finest tea.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 10.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Although as per your original plan, Mr. Freminet should also have returned to the Fortress by now. But he has neither shown up within my gates, nor has he been taken into any kind of custody. So where do you think he may be right now...?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Wait, you can't mean...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You locked him outside in the sea!?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 11.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I closed the Fortress' gate to the outside world, that's all.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Freminet's a star diver, so he should be fine, right?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' No, we're still here, so he'd definitely try to find a way to come back for us... So we can't assume that he might have made a break for the surface.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 12.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' But why would I do this, you may be asking? To have an audience with you, of course. My intel tells me that Mr. Lyney is a great magician, so it's only natural for me to want to have some cards of my own when it comes to negotiating.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 13.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Besides, I do recall you mentioning to Miss Lynette that you've always wanted to have a face-to-face meeting with the lord of the Fortress of Meropide, regardless of whether it was in a personal or a professional capacity. Well you got your wish.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 lyney 12.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' So... You've been keeping tabs on us before we even set foot in the Fortress...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 14.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Some of my folks just happened to hear a thing or two, that's all. In any case, I'll be straight with you.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 15.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I was willing to play dumb and turn a blind eye, so we had a pleasant few days playing games together here. But once you started focusing on the "forbidden zone," all of that changed.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 16.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Mr. Lyney, the cards are stacked against you right now. Miss Lynette is in my hands, and Mr. Freminet is still slowly being pickled out there in the brine. You know just as well as I that he cannot last out there forever.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 17.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' You need do but one thing to guarantee their safety. I would like you to contact your superior, and ideally invite her over for a cup of tea with me.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 lyney 13.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You want to see "Father"? Ha, but why should she bother giving you an audience?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 18.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Well, if she cares for the well-being of her dearest children, she should have plenty of motivation to join me for a parents' evening.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 19.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I've heard that the bonds between the members of the House of the Hearth are like the bonds of family. I don't see why she would refuse.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 lyney 14.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Why did you think "Father" sent us to handle the Fortress of Meropide? This place is basically a no man's land. It wouldn't be fitting for anyone as important as a [[Harbinger]] like "Father" to come here in person.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 20.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Oh, I see, so it's because she doesn't care for my place here. That's such a shame, after all, I've amassed quite the tea collection, and was looking forward to sharing it with her. Both Monsieur [[Neuvillette]] and Lady [[Furina]] have already received many samples as gifts.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 lyney 15.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...Was this the extent of your master plan to get to "Father"? No matter how much pressure you may put on me, I won't allow you to use us to blackmail her.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 21.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Your people really are difficult to get along with. All I'm asking for is a face-to-face conversation. Does she truly have no interest in the Fortress' secret?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 22.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Mr. Lyney, you have one last chance to invite your "Father" here. If you refuse...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 lyney 16.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lyney...
:{{DIcon}} Why do you have to do this?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 23.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Instead of asking why I'm doing this, why don't you try to see things from my perspective for a second? From the very beginning, the Fatui has been actively infiltrating my Fortress.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 24.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I gave you a warning by cutting off the first few operatives I found, but that only caused you to double down. Had you given up on the Fortress then and there, I'd have no reason to want a talk.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 25.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Mr. Freminet left the Fortress on his own, and Miss Lynette tried to pry out my secrets right in front of me. No matter how you look at it, the responsibility for this falls on you.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 lyney 17.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I... I shouldn't ask "Father" to do anything because of us...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 26.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Six, five...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 lyney 18.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Wait, I...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 27.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' ...Two, one.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 28.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Time's up. It's really a shame, Mr. Lyney.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wriothesley！
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 29.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Negotiations have broken down. Please leave, ladies and gentlemen. It's time for my afternoon tea.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 lyney 19.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Please wait! Can we really not talk about this some more?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, listen to {{Traveler}}! If you can't talk to Lyney, can you at least talk to us?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 30.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' You do realize that I'm only letting you go because of Neuvillette, yes? You're here helping him out, and I've already done my best to stay out of your way.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 31.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' But that doesn't mean you can just do whatever you want. The Fortress may be small and remote, but it still has its own set of laws.
:{{DIcon}} Please spare Freminet and Lynette.
:{{DIcon}} I want to save Freminet and Lynette, too.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 32.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 33.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Then how about this? Those who are capable deserve respect. You've spent quite some time investigating my home turf by now, so why don't you tell me a thing or two about what you've found?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 7 wriothesley 34.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I'll ask you three questions. Answer all of them correctly, and I'll agree to your request.

:{{Color|menu|Clorinde and Wriothesley are having a discussion...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq106 9 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' What's that look on your face? I thought I made good time on the way back.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 9 wriothesley 01.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Oh, I'm just admiring your punctuality. Had you arrived just a few minutes later, Sigewinne may have been forced to shoot Mr. Lyney again.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 9 wriothesley 02.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' How's the situation out there?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 9 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' The water has changed. It's pretty much as expected. The concentration of Primordial Seawater has increased significantly.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 9 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I was only out there a short time, so it wasn't too bad. But if one were to stay for any significant amount of time... Well, you can see how that boy is doing.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 9 wriothesley 03.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Where was he when you found him?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 9 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' The abandoned zone at the end of the pipes. A good distance into the water.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 9 wriothesley 04.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Closer than I thought. He must have recognized it early on, and tried desperately to swim back.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 9 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Locking the door was necessary. I don't think we could have saved two.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 9 wriothesley 05.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Well, I did try to convince them that I had my reasons... Never seems to work, though.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 9 clorinde 06.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' It would probably work on Neuvillette. He has a knack for picking out who had good intentions even when the outcomes were all terrible.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 9 wriothesley 06.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Eh... It's a bad sign if you're having to plead your case to Neuvillette.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 9 wriothesley 07.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Want some tea?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 9 clorinde 07.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Not particularly. If you want to drink some that badly, just say so.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 9 wriothesley 08.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Fine, I'd like to get some tea. Want me to get you a cup too, since I've already made it?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 9 clorinde 08.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Eh, might as well then, I suppose. Actually, do you have a towel? I would like to dry my hair.

;(Talk to Wriothesley or Clorinde again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq106 wriothesley 01.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Could I tempt you with some sugar for your tea?
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq106 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' No need.

;(Talk to Lyney or Sigewinne)
:{{Color|menu|Sigewinne checks on Freminet...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq106 8 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Lyney's expression looks disgusted... It seems like he'd rather not have Sigewinne touch Freminet. Still, he didn't stop her, since it's obvious that Freminet does require urgent medical care.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Sigewinne's examining Freminet carefully. She doesn't look too upset, which is a good sign. I hope Freminet will be okay.)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 8 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...How is he?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 8 sigewinne 01.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' These symptoms are probably caused by an acute ingestion of a large amount of Primordial Seawater. Still, his condition is not critical.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 8 sigewinne 02.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Of course, it would still be best if he stayed for further observation. Let's leave him here for now, and move him to the infirmary once he's recovered a bit more.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 8 sigewinne 03.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' ...Sorry, I am aware that the infirmary may not be your favorite place in the world at the moment. We do only have a single clinic in the fortress, however.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 8 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 8 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...Why would he ingest a large amount of Primordial Seawater after leaving the Fortress? How could that possibly happen...?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 8 sigewinne 04.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Please look after Mr. Freminet for the moment. I'll go fetch some medicine and a respirator. I'll bring Miss Lynette back with me.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 8 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Where is she!? How is she right now!?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 8 sigewinne 05.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Oh, she just took a nap in an empty room after I tranquilized her. If my calculations are correct, she should also be waking up right around now. You might not believe me, but His Grace and I actually made some snacks and tea for her.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Lyney has finally begun to stop tensing the muscles on his face. It seems that he trusts what Sigewinne just said.)

;(Talk to Lyney again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq106 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...

;(After talking to both parties)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lyney, are you okay...?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 10 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...I'll be fine. They're all here now. Don't worry about me.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you sure? You don't look alright...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 10 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' My hands and feet are still a bit weak, but that's probably just the residual effects of the tranquilizer shot.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 10 sigewinne 01.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' I'm back, everyone.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 10 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Lyney! Oh! {{Traveler}}, Paimon, you're here too!
:{{Color|menu|Lynette notices the unconscious Freminet...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq106 10 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' ...Freminet? Is he...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 10 sigewinne 02.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' He'll be fine. But for now, please help me lift him up.
:{{Black Screen|Lyney and Lynette immediately come to lift Freminet up. With their help, Freminet also manages to swallow a dose of Sigewinne's medicine.}}
:{{A|vo fdaq106 10 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' ...Ugh...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 10 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' His breathing's beginning to slow down.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 10 sigewinne 03.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Give me a hand and help me get him to the infirmary.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 10 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Yeah, I'll take him from this side. Lynette? Together?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 10 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' On it.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 10 sigewinne 04.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' {{Traveler}}, you seem pretty worried about him. Want to come with us?
:{{DIcon}} Very well.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Duke and Clorinde are gone...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 10 sigewinne 05.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' They probably went to get some tea. The Duke will explain the truth in just a bit. Miss Clorinde will need a break, since she only just returned from rescuing Freminet out of the sea.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Clorinde saved Freminet from the sea... Just what happened there?)
----
;(Enter the infirmanry)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 11 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' ...Pff...*cough*
:{{A|vo fdaq106 11 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' He's awake. Freminet, how do you feel?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 11 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Lyney... Lynette...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 11 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' We're all here.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 11 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Where... am I...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 11 sigewinne 01.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' The infirmary at the Fortress of Meropide, Mr. Freminet, and you are no longer in any danger.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How do you feel? Don't push yourself if you're not feeling up to it!
:{{A|vo fdaq106 11 freminet 04.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon... It's been so long.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 11 freminet 05.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' ...The sea! There's something wrong with the seawater!
:{{A|vo fdaq106 11 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Shh, it's okay. We can talk about it after you've recovered.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 11 freminet 06.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' No, listen to me, this is really serious! There's Primordial Seawater mixed into the regular seawater. I don't know why it's there, but no one should touch it!
:{{DIcon}} What happened after you snuck into the pipes?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 11 freminet 07.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' ...Pipes...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 11 freminet 08.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' ...Right, the pipes. It's all coming back to me now...
----
:{{Color|menu|Freminet begins to describe what happened after he entered the pipes...}}
;(The player is now seeing Freminet's memories in his perspective)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 12 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' ...I'm in. Hmm... Seems like this pipe hasn't been used in a long time. It looks abandoned.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 12 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Where could Master Childe be...

;(Enter the large room)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 23 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' This mechanism looks like it's been tampered with... Could he have done it?

;(Rotate the platform while it is in the upper position)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 23 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Hmm, it's getting stuck on something. Seems like I'll have to avoid those obstacles while I turn it...

;(Approach the water)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 13 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' This is where the water starts... Okay.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 13 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' (Master Childe probably dived into the water... I'll go take a look as well.)

;(Proceed further into the tunnel)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 14 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' (The vegetation here is a bit more sparse... These traces aren't natural, a person must have left them, and recently. I should be going in the right direction.)

;(Approach the corner)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 14 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' (There are traces here, too. I need to keep going.)

;(Approach the end of the tunnel)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 14 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' (Eh? The traces are gone? But I don't see where he could have gone from here...)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 14 freminet 04.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' (Wait, what the... Argh! Urgh...)
:{{Color|menu|Freminet senses that the seawater is abnormal...}}
:{{A|vo fdaq106 14 freminet 05.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' (My heart is racing, and it's getting harder and harder to breathe. What's going on?)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 14 freminet 06.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' (No good, I have to get back, they still don't know anything about what's going on! If I turn back right now, I should still be able to make it...)

;(Approach the marker)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 15 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' (I can't... die here... Ugh...)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 15 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' (This is... This is bad... I'm feeling worse and worse... And I'm still underwater...)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 15 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' (I... I have to push on...)
:;(Freminet sees Clorinde swimming towards him as he passes out)
:{{Color|menu|Freminet falls unconscious...}}
----
:;(In the present)
:{{A|vo fdaq106 16 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...So, in other words, the trail you were following vanished, and you had no idea where Master Childe could have gone, but there was also no obvious place for him to have disappeared to...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 16 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' That's right. I tried my best to swim back, but I had already put some distance between myself and the fortress, and I just couldn't find the strength to keep going... I probably passed out sometime after that, and you know the rest.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 16 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Miss Clorinde brought you back, but we also don't know why she just suddenly appeared at the Fortress, or why she went out to save you...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 16 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Miss Clorinde, you say... I must go thank her in person.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 16 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' You're still too weak, Freminet. You can go after you've had some more rest.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 16 sigewinne 01.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Miss Lynette is right. I believe Miss Clorinde will stay here as a guest for another few days, so there's no need to hurry.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 16 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' A guest... Then I can assume Wriothesley was the one who invited her to come down here?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 16 sigewinne 02.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' You should ask His Grace about that. He'll be able to explain better than me.
:{{DIcon}} Got it, I'll go talk to him.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 16 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, it's about time he actually told us what's going on! Wanna come with us, Lyney?
:{{A|vo fdaq106 16 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 16 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' No, please go on without me, {{Traveler}}. I don't want to leave just yet.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 16 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Lyney...
:{{A|vo fdaq106 16 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...The logical part of my brain is aware that we are safe right now, but I still can't bring myself to leave. Both of you were just in danger.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 16 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Understood. Then let's just sit together for a while.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 16 sigewinne 03.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' In that case, I'll leave the infirmary to you. {{Traveler}} and I are going to head out for now &mdash; as long as you stay in here, I don't think you'll be disturbed.
:{{A|vo fdaq106 16 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Thank you.

;(Talk to Freminet, Lynette, or Lyney again, optional)
:{{A|vo fdaq107 1 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I&mdash;I'm so sorry, Lyney...
:{{A|vo fdaq107 1 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I'm also really sorry, Lyney. I should have been more careful.
:{{A|vo fdaq107 1 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Don't say that. It was all my fault... I was the one who should have been more careful. You two were nearly...
:{{A|vo fdaq107 1 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' If I was stronger... Maybe I would have already found Master Childe...
:{{A|vo fdaq107 1 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' No, how can you say that?
:{{A|vo fdaq107 1 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Hmm?
:{{A|vo fdaq107 1 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...I'm sorry...
:{{A|vo fdaq107 1 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' What I'm hearing is, we all dropped the ball at some point during the mission, so the responsibility falls on all of us. Isn't that right?
:{{A|vo fdaq107 1 freminet 04.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Yeah, that's right. It's on all of us.
:{{A|vo fdaq107 1 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq107 1 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Lyney, we understand that you're worried about us, but we're worried about you as well. Please don't blame yourself... We want you to keep your spirits up.
:{{A|vo fdaq107 1 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...Yeah.
