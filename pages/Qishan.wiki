:'''Qishan:''' Welcome, I hope you'll have a wonderful day!
:{{DIcon}} You're not from around here, are you?
::'''Qishan:''' You have a sharp eye. I'm from [[Liyue]], and currently working here part-time while I prepare for an exam.
::'''Qishan:''' Ever since I was a kid, I've loved watching the ships come in and out of [[Liyue Harbor]] and seeing how they dock and load and unload their cargo...
::'''Qishan:''' Over time, I grew fascinated with all sorts of ships. I'm hoping I can go to the [[Akademiya]] for further technical training.
::'''Qishan:''' When I'm not working, I'll discuss questions I have about ships with the researches and students I've met at work.
::'''Qishan:''' At first, I felt bad about bothering them during their free time. I didn't realize how much the Akademiya students enjoyed talking with me!
::'''Qishan:''' There's an old expression in Liyue that says it best: Where there's a will, there's a way. I'll definitely pass the Akademiya exam!
:{{DIcon}} See you.

==Trivia==
* Given Qishan's pronounced interest in shipbuilding, it may be assumed that she is aiming to enter [[Kshahrewar]], as it is the [[Darshan]] most focused on mechanics and technology.
