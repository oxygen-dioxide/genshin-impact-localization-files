===Daytime===
:'''Sayid:''' Hello, my friend. You want to talk?
:{{DIcon}} About [[Dvalin|Stormterror]]...
:;(After completing [[A Long Shot]])
::'''Sayid:''' Stormterror's story... Or should I say, Dvalin's, is a topic with great research value.
::'''Sayid:''' I never expected to encounter such a cataclysmic event on my trip to Mondstadt. For me, it's quite fortunate.
::'''Sayid:''' Anyway, I will record everything I have seen and heard. I should like for my compatriots in Sumeru to learn of these historical events...
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Sayid:''' Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Sayid, a visiting scholar from Sumeru.
::'''Sayid:''' Mondstadt is a pleasant place. I have been here for some time now, and I am reluctant to leave... It has definitely brought out my more, ahem, leisurely side...
::'''Sayid:''' In all seriousness though, a leisurely lifestyle just means doing whatever makes you happy, doesn't it? A fitting ethos for the City of Freedom...
::'''Sayid:''' And it seems that I've become a total convert without anyone having to preach it from the rooftops... Hah. The remarkable wisdom of the gods.
::'''Sayid:''' Anemo Archon Barbatos, my respect to you.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about Sumeru.
::'''Sayid:''' It's my homeland, though I haven't been back in a long while.
::'''Sayid:''' Sumeru is known all over the world as a center of learning. As a traveler, I'm sure you must have heard of the [[Sumeru Akademiya]]?
::'''Sayid:''' Ms. [[Lisa]] of the [[Knights of Favonius]] studied there. My teacher mentioned her once &mdash; allegedly, Lisa was the best student they'd seen in two hundred years...
::'''Sayid:''' I am exceptionally curious as to the real reason that she wound up working here as a librarian...
:{{DIcon|Reward}} Made any discoveries?
::'''Sayid:''' I was reading up on some of Mondstadt's historical myths previously. Fortunately, the library has a wealth of resources for reference.
::'''Sayid:''' Of all the myths and legends in Mondstadt, the one I'm most fascinated by has to be The Legend of Vennessa.
::'''Sayid:''' The spirit of freedom prized by Mondstadt must have been modeled after her courage in standing up to injustice and oppressive rulers. Even as an outsider, I am deeply moved.
::'''Sayid:''' My focus has shifted to the songs of Mondstadt of late, so I'm done with this book now. Just remember to return it to the library once you've finished reading it...
:;(Obtain [[The Legend of Vennessa (II)]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
:'''Sayid:''' Farewell, may you forever grow in wisdom.

===Nighttime===
:'''Sayid:''' ...Oh, my apologies. Did my musings disturb you?
:{{DIcon}} What are you looking at?
::'''Sayid:''' I'm currently reading the works of some bards.
::'''Sayid:''' They weave their ideas, thoughts, and truths into romantic poetry, not at all like the unwieldy tomes of Sumeru...
::'''Sayid:''' Perhaps this romanticism is an expression of great wisdom.
::'''Sayid:''' Yes, this is excellent. Excellent material, indeed.
:{{DIcon}} Farewell.
::'''Sayid:''' Farewell. May you grow in wisdom.

Stories brought on the wind will bloom into legends in due time.'' However, his version omits the references to the [[God of Time]].
*{{Lang|{{w|Sayyid_(name)|Sayid}}|ar=سيد|ar_rm=Syid}} is a name of Arabian origin that refers to those of the Progeny of the Prophet of Islam, Mohammed (saws). It also means "Lord" or "Master".
