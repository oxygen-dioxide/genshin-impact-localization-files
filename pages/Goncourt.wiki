==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing ''[[Both Brains and Brawn]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Goncourt:''' Got questions? If you do, don't ask me. I'm not a guard. Go find... go find [[Estienne]]! He seems like he's got all the time in the world.
:{{DIcon}} You're not a guard?
::'''Goncourt:''' Ha, no. I just play one on stage. See this uniform? Take a closer look, the quality is much worse than an actual uniform.
::'''Goncourt:''' If it wasn't for the tragically tiny budget the Tri-Coupon Troupe has, I would have a proper costume. A genuine top-quality guard's uniform...
::{{DIcon}} I don't think that's the best use of your resources.
:::'''Goncourt:''' I must disagree with your opinion. You have to understand that props and costumes are crucial to any performance.
:::'''Goncourt:''' Oh, or do you mean that the script is even more important? Well, if that's the case then I would have no choice but to agree!
::{{DIcon}} The Tri-Coupon Troupe?
:::'''Goncourt:''' An incredible organization, dedicated to enriching lives through theater... or at least I'd like to be able to say that.
:::'''Goncourt:''' At the moment, we're more amateur hobbyists... Or a support group. Oh, if only we had more of a budget...
:{{DIcon}} Very well. Goodbye.
::'''Goncourt:''' Good luck.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''Both Brains and Brawn''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Goncourt:''' Hello. We meet again.
:{{DIcon}} About your outfit...
::'''Goncourt:''' Haha. looks real enough, right? But look, the quality is much worse than an actual uniform.
::'''Goncourt:''' If it wasn't for the tragically tiny budget the Tri-Coupon Troupe has, I would have a proper costume. A genuine top-quality guard's uniform...
:{{DIcon}} About the Tri-Coupon Troupe...
::'''Goncourt:''' An incredible organization, dedicated to enriching lives through theater... or at least I'd like to be able to say that.
::'''Goncourt:''' At the moment, we're more amateur hobbyists... Or a support group. Oh, if only we had more of a budget...
::'''Goncourt:''' [[Fourmon]] and [[Meilhat]] have been doing all the work lately. And it does seem the two of them alone can already put on a decent performance...
::{{DIcon}} Looks like you're out.
::'''Goncourt:''' Oh, I'm injured.
::'''Goncourt:''' Hey, didn't you say you'd tell me some amazing stories when you got the chance? Did you think of any?
::{{DIcon}} (Share an unforgettable experience.)
:::'''Goncourt:''' That's awesome! But it'd be a waste for me to turn it into a script. We can only put on cheap little skits here...
:::'''Goncourt:''' That's a story that deserves to be performed on the stage of the [[Opera Epiclese]]!
:::'''Goncourt:''' But were there the opportunity to tell such a grand story under those shining {{sic|light}}... well, it's not like I'd get a chance to write the script, now would I?
::{{DIcon}} (Tell about an ordinary experience.)
:::'''Goncourt:''' Hmm, that's a good story. But to make it work on stage... I think the story would be almost unrecognizable.
:::'''Goncourt:''' Personally, I like that kind of story. Ordinary events can tell us a lot about a person's character... Some might disagree, of course, but that doesn't matter.
:::'''Goncourt:''' Perhaps the most important thing is that audiences expect conflict and twists! And, unfortunately, this probably does not meet those expectations. Such a shame.
::{{DIcon}} I'm kinda busy right now. Maybe another time.
:::'''Goncourt:''' A rain check it is.
:{{DIcon}} About "The Fourth"...
::'''Goncourt:''' Haha. You've heard the moniker? Did [[Lanoire]] tell you? She's the only person here who calls me that.
::'''Goncourt:''' That was my stage name when I fought in the [[Pankration Ring]]. Goncourt the Fourth. But everyone complained it was too long so they just called me Goncourt.
::'''Goncourt:''' But Lanoire just calls me "The Fourth," even when I'm not in the arena.
::'''Goncourt:''' Perhaps I'm some kind of storybook character to her? That actually suits me just fine.
:{{DIcon}} I need to go. Let's talk again later.
::'''Goncourt:''' Don't let me keep you!
