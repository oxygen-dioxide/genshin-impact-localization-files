{{Quest Description|'''On the Evil Spirits' Trail:''' [[Dalong]] leaves after having been given half the popsicles, feeling quite pleased. After this small interlude, you and [[Chongyun]] continue discussing evil spirits. Chongyun hopes to tap on your abundant experience as an adventurer to adjudge the truth or falsehood of information concerning evil spirits. To that end, you had to [[Wanwen Bookhouse]] together.<br><br>'''The Rumored Heretical Ground:''' After determining the truth or falsehood of the information you have, you and Chongyun decide on a more valuable lead to pursue.}}
===On the Evil Spirits' Trail===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the [[Wanwen Bookhouse]])
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' This is a note I received from a friend. It has many clues about evil spirits on it.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' If we check the books here at Wanwen Bookhouse according to the respective clues on the note, we'll be able to find the complete details of each clue.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Since you're here to help, I'll just read the clues to you, and you can help me judge if they're credible or not based on your experience.
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Alright, here are the first clues.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 05.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' "At the foot of [[Qingce Village|Mt. Qingce]] is a [[Violetgrass]] that has turned into a gigantic, man-eating monster."
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 06.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Also, "There's a ghostly shadow skulking about Feiyun Slope at night. It's suspected to be a vengeful spirit."
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 07.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' And finally, "Lurking in [[Liyue Harbor]] is a massive demon that was transformed from a popsicle."
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 08.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Huh? I've never encountered any such things before.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 09.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Anyway, could you pick the one that seems most plausible and likely to be the work of evil spirits?
:{{DIcon}} "Lurking in [[Liyue Harbor]] is a massive demon that was transformed from a popsicle."
:;(&minus;2 Hearts)
::{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 12.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Popsicles can't turn into demons! Besides, I always keep a close eye on my stock of popsicles.
:{{DIcon}} "At the foot of Mt. Qingce is a Violetgrass that has turned into a gigantic, man-eating monster."
:;(&minus;2 Hearts)
::{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 10.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' ...This one seems unlikely. If such a thing did exist, there would be many witnesses in Qingce Village, but nobody has yet to see it.
:{{DIcon}} "There's a ghostly shadow skulking about Feiyun Slope at night. It's suspected to be a vengeful spirit."
::{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 11.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Hmm, this is possible, but it sounds too similar to previous rumors. Many people often pass through Feiyun Slope, so perhaps it's just some sort of misunderstanding.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 13.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Hmm, how about these clues?
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 14.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' "Deep in the [[Sea of Clouds]], a marauding demon has been raiding commercial fishing boats and building a luxurious palace."
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 15.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Or, "In [[Jueyun Karst]], there's a piece of thousand-year-old [[Amber Rock|amber]] that has gained consciousness and now roams about causing trouble."
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 16.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' And lastly, "It's said that people often see a demon who loves eating [[Jueyun Chili|chilis]] in [[Wanmin Restaurant]]."
:{{DIcon}} "Deep in the Sea of Clouds, a marauding demon has been raiding commercial fishing boats and building a luxurious palace."
::{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 17.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' This one does seem possible, but it also sounds like a tale from unverifiable sources. Plus, we don't have any means of investigating the deep sea, either.
:{{DIcon}} "In Jueyun Karst, there's a piece of thousand-year-old amber that has gained consciousness and now roams about causing trouble."
:;(&minus;2 Hearts)
::{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 18.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Jueyun Karst is the territory of the [[Adepti]]. If there were such a thing, the Adepti would certainly take action...
:{{DIcon}} "It's said that people often see a demon who loves eating chilis in Wanmin Restaurant."
:;(&minus;2 Hearts)
::{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 19.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Even I can tell that this is talking about [[Xiangling]]'s little [[Guoba]], not some demon...
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 20.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Okay, here are a few more clues.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 21.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' "A strange man wearing a mask and wielding a pole was once seen in the distance around [[Guili Plains]]. There's something eerie about his presence."
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 22.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Or, "Someone saw an exorcist with blue hair who is actually a transformed demon." Wait, what?
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 23.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' And finally, "There is a vigilant demon adept at concealing itself in mist. Recently, people have found traces of it in [[Mingyun Village]], Guili Plains, and [[Yaoguang Shoal]]."
:{{DIcon}} "A strange man wearing a mask and wielding a pole was once seen in the distance around Guili Plains. There's something eerie about his presence."
:;(&minus;2 Hearts)
::{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 24.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Oh! That must be the [[Xiao|Vigilant Yaksha]]. Don't worry, he's not an enemy.
:{{DIcon}} "Someone saw an exorcist with blue hair who is actually a transformed demon."
:;(&minus;2 Hearts)
::{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 25.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Hey! Not funny...
:{{DIcon}} "There is a vigilant demon adept at concealing itself in mist. Recently, people have found traces of it in Mingyun Village, Guili Plains, and Yaoguang Shoal."
::{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 26.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Now that you mention it, I may have heard of this one. I've been trying to track it, but the spirit's so cautious that I don't think we'll ever have a chance of catching it unless it decides to show itself.

;(If at least 1 Heart remains)
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 27.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' It appears most of these clues are either not reliable or nearly impossible to investigate.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 28.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' *sigh* It seems there is little here that we can actually use...
:{{DIcon}} Out of curiosity, who gave you these clues?
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 29.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Oh, many of these are from my friend, [[Xingqiu]]. He's well-read and very knowledgeable.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 30.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Not to mention he's always willing to extend a helping hand. He always provides me with lots of reliable information.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 31.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' If it weren't for my pure-yang spirit, I would have already vanquished numerous demons because of him, I'm sure of it.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 32.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I should find a chance to thank him personally.
:{{DIcon}} Such... enviable friendship.
::{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 33.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Yes, he always goes out of his way for me, but he never seems to mind and helps me all the same. Also, he often has something interesting to say. I'm quite glad that I get along with him.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe you should change your source of information.
::{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 34.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Do... do you mean that I shouldn't trouble him anymore?
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 35.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Sorry, I digress. I've found another snippet of information here. There aren't many details, but it clearly mentions [[Wuwang Hill]].
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 36.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' If we include the Test of Courage rumor from before, there are already two clues pointing there.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 37.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I've also noticed that the weather in Wuwang Hill has been very abnormal recently. Let's go and have a look. We might just find something useful.
:{{DIcon}} I hope we can find something there.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902301 chongyun 38.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Alright, let's head out and see what we can find!

;(If no Hearts remain)
:'''Hangout Event Ended:''' Seeing that the Traveler is also unable to make anything more out of the clues, Chongyun bids farewell and leaves in disappointment.
{{Dialogue End}}

===The Rumored Heretical Ground===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the designated spot at Wuwang Hill)
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' This place seems quite... ordinary.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' So ordinary that I don't even feel that it's worth investigating.
:{{DIcon}} Same feeling here.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Wuwang Hill's unusual weather and peculiar surroundings are a source of constant rumors, most of which are untraceable and can never be proven.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' So, I suppose this could only be expected...
:{{DIcon}} It seems you seldom have anything to show for all your efforts. Is that also due to your pure-yang spirit?
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 05.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I guess so. Like I mentioned before, my yang energy tends to just scare away evil spirits.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 06.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' You may think it's beneficial for me to have such a condition, and therefore there's no real need for me to practice thaumaturgy.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 07.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' But if I renounced my practice my thaumaturgy, and one day met an evil spirit that didn't fear my yang energy, then I may not be able to exorcise it.
:{{DIcon}} No wonder you're so persistent.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 08.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' If I merely spend my time training without actually putting it into practice, then how would I ever know the fruits of my labor, or what skills I need to improve?
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 09.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' But to this very day, despite the many exorcisms I have performed, I have yet to see a single demon, not to mention one that I needed to defeat using thaumaturgy.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 10.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' *sigh* Sorry, I&mdash;I shouldn't rant like that. I'm fine, I've gotten used to such feelings...
:{{DIcon}} Don't give up, Chongyun.
::{{A|vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 11.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' *sigh* ...You're right. It's a shame to say that I've grown accustomed to such things. You shouldn't have to comfort me.
:{{cx}}
:{{DIcon}} Not all rumors are not necessarily fake. Let's have a look around.
::{{A|vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 12.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' You're right. I just need to stay disciplined.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902302 chongyun 13.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Since we're already here, let's go check the two locations mentioned in the clue.
----
;(Interact with the Strange Smoke)
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' What's this...?
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I know this mist. It was left by some kind of evil spirit.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' It's very thick and never disperses. The evil spirit may have been here recently.
:{{DIcon}} So it seems the clue was real.
:{{DIcon}} Great, our efforts have finally paid off!
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Yes, it was not all in vain.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 05.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' But we mustn't act rashly. If this mist remains here, it can easily contaminate the area.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 06.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Once it contaminates monsters such as hilichurls, it could even make them more aggressive and dangerous to anyone nearby.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 07.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Or if it happens to contaminate any adventurers passing by, the consequences would be unimaginable.
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave this to you.
:{{DIcon}} It's your time to shine, Exorcist.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 08.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' My pleasure.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 09.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Let's inspect the surrounding area to see if there's any more mist like this. Once we've cleaned up this mess, we'll continue forward.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 10.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Remember, there might be danger ahead. We should be prepared for a fight.
:{{DIcon}} You're very calm.
:{{DIcon}} You're very thorough.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 11.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' It's second nature to me... Exorcism is a solemn and serious matter.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 12.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' It's on me if you or anyone else gets hurt due to my negligence.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 13.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' There's no time to lose. Let's go.
;(After the cutscene ends)
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 14.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' It appears that there are evil spirits here, and not the weak variety.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902303 chongyun 15.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Let's keep going.
----
;(Upon interacting with the Strange Smoke, "contaminated" hilichurls appear)
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902304 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' I suspected that there would be hilichurls here.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902304 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Let's deal with them all. We mustn't let a single one escape.

;(After defeating the hilichurls)
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' These tracks are still fresh. It seems the evil spirit is on the move.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' The path ends here, as well as the tracks... It'll be difficult to follow it any further.
:{{DIcon}} I didn't think your pure-yang spirit could be so powerful.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' It must have sensed me as a threat from a long way off. That's why it ran with such haste.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' It seems that this is still not the kind of spirit that can overcome my abundant yang energy and fight me head-on.
:{{DIcon}} But if we don't deal with it, it'll just go somewhere else and harm people, right?
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 05.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' *sigh* Don't worry. I'll continue tracking it for a few days. It won't dare show its face around here again.
:{{DIcon}} But you still won't ever see it, right?
::{{A|vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 06.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Most likely, yes. I'm afraid the best I can do is just scare it away.
:{{DIcon}} It's a shame that we can't take care of it for good.
::{{A|vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 07.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Yes, defeating it once and for all would certainly make all this worth our efforts.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 08.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Hm? Why do you seem so disappointed?
:{{DIcon}} I can't help but feel like this was a waste of our time.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 09.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' No, quite the contrary. Not only did we clean up the traces of an evil spirit, but we also took care of those monsters. We've done our jobs as exorcists.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 10.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' My only regret is that I didn't get to drive it away using my thaumaturgy.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 11.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' But I'm already prepared to spend my life chasing this goal, so I do not regret such disappointments.
:{{DIcon}} Hmm, I guess you're right.
::{{A|vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 12.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Yes, so please cheer up.
:{{DIcon}} Now you're comforting me?
::{{A|vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 13.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Of course. I'd never wish for you to be in low spirits on my account.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 14.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Actually, I also wanted to thank you for not leaving me, even with my special condition, and for helping chase the evil spirit to the very end.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 15.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Even if we'd ended up running into an incredibly strong demon, I would've felt much safer with an experienced adventurer like you by my side.
:{{DIcon}} I'm just doing my duty.
:{{DIcon}} Your persistence made it hard for me to leave...
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 16.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Well, I appreciate it. Oh, it seems the weather is starting to clear up over there. Let's go have a look.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 17.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Hmm, perhaps there's nothing to worry about after all. Even though I didn't come face to face with that evil spirit, at least I met you.
:{{DIcon}} I'm not an evil spirit.
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 18.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Oh, no &mdash; that came out wrong. What I'm trying to say is...
:{{A|vo cycop001 1902305 chongyun 19.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' We shouldn't focus only on the gains and losses of our journey. The things you see and the events you encounter along the way are equally important rewards.
