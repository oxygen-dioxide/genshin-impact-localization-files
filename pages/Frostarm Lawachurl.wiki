|caption_8 = Large Cryo Slime
|file_8_2 = Cryo Lawachurl Slime Throw 2
|caption_8_2 = Cryo Slimes
}}

==Strategy==
The Frostarm Lawachurl's attacks are quite similar to its Geo counterpart, the [[Stonehide Lawachurl]]. It can throw a large Cryo slime in front of it, and create Cryo infused armor that greatly improves both its damage and defense. The shield is best removed with [[Pyro]].

Unlike the Geo blasts from Stonehide Lawachurl, the Frostarm Lawachurl does not have any long range attacks. To compensate, it aggressively charges towards players to deal devastating melee damage. With its charging attack, it instead leaves behind ice crystals that act as landmines for a short period of time, dealing {{Color|Cryo DMG}} to any player who comes into contact with them. While shielded with its Cryo infused armor, its devastating jump attack can sometimes even knock out characters in a single blow.

Its jump attack also creates an ice floor at where the Frostarm Lawachurl lands, dealing continuous damage over time to players who stay within its area of effect. It is capable of using any of these unique abilities with or without its Cryo enhancement.

The Frostarm Lawachurl's Frosty Berserker is especially devastating if not avoided properly. Be on the look out for when it roars during its Cryo Infused State.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A mysterious "lord" of hilichurls that stalks the snow and fog.<br>This huge hilichurl is referred to as a "lawa" by its brethren. Its body, honed to the very limit, almost seems to blend into its Cryo-filled environment, and its stoic nobility is like that of the frozen northland rivers.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* Frostarm Lawachurls have the least amount of overworld spawns compared to the other Lawachurls, with a total of three, all in [[Dragonspine]], currently making them the only Lawachurls not found in any other nation.
** The two Frostarm Lawachurls located in the south and in the west of Dragonspine have the title "Ice-Sealed Lawachurl."
** The one west of the [[Peak of Vindagnyr]] [[Domain]] is titled [[Ukko]].
