{{Description|A mysterious "lord" of hilichurls that stalks the snow and fog.<br />This huge hilichurl is referred to as a "lawa" by its brethren. Its body, honed to the very limit, almost seems to blend into its Cryo-filled environment, and its stoic nobility is like that of the frozen northland rivers.|[[Archive]]}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
* '''Punches:''' Roars and performs a punch with its left arm. It occasionally combos with both arms and slams the ground, dealing '''75% ATK''' and '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}}. This attack is only performed when the Frostarm Lawachurl is <u>not</u> in the '''Frozen Enhanced State'''.

* '''Frozen Enhanced State:''' The Frostarm Lawachurl can generate an {{Color|Cryo|[[Frozen#Frozen Element|Frozen]]}} shield, enabling it to use more powerful attacks. This shield will degrade over 90 seconds and can be further damaged using [[Elemental Reactions]] and [[Poise Damage]]. {{Pyro}} is most effective against the shield.
** When the Frostarm Lawachurl is in its '''Frozen Enhanced State''', it gains a '''80%''' [[Damage Reduction]], which reduces the [[Damage Bonus]] of incoming attacks by 80%.

* '''Dash:''' The Frostarm Lawachurl quickly charges at its target after a roar, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} and leaving 6 ice shards on the ground. Ice shards explode when a player is in close proximity, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. This attack is only performed when the Frostarm Lawachurl is in the '''Frozen Enhanced State'''.

* '''Shockwave:''' Roars and slams both hands into the ground, causing sharp ice to spike from the ground, dealing '''100% ATK''' and '''125% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}}. This attack is only performed when the Frostarm Lawachurl is in the '''Frozen Enhanced State'''.

* '''Jumping Slam:''' Roars and jumps into the air, slamming down at the player's position, dealing '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}} and freezing the ground around the landing position, which deals '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DoT}} to characters who step on it. This attack is only performed when the Frostarm Lawachurl is in the '''Frozen Enhanced State'''.

* '''Slime Throw:''' If the player is at a higher elevation or too far away, the Lawachurl will roar and grab a [[Large Cryo Slime]] from the ground, throwing it at the player to deal '''125% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}. This attack is only performed when the Frostarm Lawachurl is in the '''Frozen Enhanced State'''.

==Strategy==
The Frostarm Lawachurl's attacks are quite similar to its Geo counterpart, the [[Stonehide Lawachurl]]. It can throw a large Cryo slime in front of it, and create Cryo infused armor that greatly improves both its damage and defense. The shield is best removed with [[Pyro]].

Unlike the Geo blasts from Stonehide Lawachurl, the Frostarm Lawachurl does not have any long range attacks. To compensate, it aggressively charges towards players to deal devastating melee damage. With its charging attack, it instead leaves behind ice crystals that act as landmines for a short period of time, dealing {{Color|Cryo DMG}} to any player who comes into contact with them. While shielded with its Cryo infused armor, its devastating jump attack can sometimes even knock out characters in a single blow.

Its jump attack also creates an ice floor at where the Frostarm Lawachurl lands, dealing continuous damage over time to players who stay within its area of effect. It is capable of using any of these unique abilities with or without its Cryo enhancement.

==Trivia==
*Frostarm Lawachurls have the least amount of overworld spawns compared to the other Lawachurls, with a total of three, all in Dragonspine. Unlike their other Lawachurl brethren, all three of these Lawachurls have titles when fought.
**The two Frostarm Lawachurls, located south-west of the southern central [[Teleport Waypoints|Teleport Waypoint]] and the one to the west have the title "Ice-Sealed Lawachurl".
**The one west of the [[Peak of Vindagnyr]] [[Domain]] is interestingly called [[Ukko]].
