{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Peixiu:''' Oh, there are a few places to verify over here too... All of them are hidden paths that can't be seen by just looking at the shape of the mountains...
:'''Peixiu:''' Well, {{Traveler}}, is everything going smoothly?
:{{DIcon}} About mapping...
::'''Peixiu:''' Hmm, it's tiring work, but verifying and updating maps is extremely important to people who rely on them to travel.
::'''Peixiu:''' And it'll help them identify potentially dangerous areas, so they can plan ahead and avoid them.
::'''Peixiu:''' As expected, the deserted areas which had to be surveyed seem to have been occupied by various monsters and fungi...
:{{DIcon}} About the surveying team...
::'''Peixiu:''' Of course, the more people we have, the better. It's not just because places with difficult terrain are inherently dangerous, but we may even run into all sorts of strange monsters...
::'''Peixiu:''' N-Next time, I should ask Lan to send a few more people.
:{{DIcon}} I'd say it's going well.
::'''Peixiu:''' That's such a relief! But do let me know if you encounter any trouble, and I'll mark it on the map...
