==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Paimon:''' Traveler, wake up! (shake vigorously...)
:'''Traveler:''' Did I fall asleep?
:'''???:''' You're awake. Do you remember who I am?
:{{DIcon}} Of course I remember. You're our friend [[Shiki Taishou]].
::'''Shiki Taishou:''' Okay, okay, you're awake. you were sound asleep, have you been working yourself to exhaustion lately?
::'''Traveler:''' Perhaps.
:{{DIcon}} Of course I remember, you're that... paper figure!
::'''Shiki Taishou:''' Paper figure? What's that? I am Shiki Taishou, a shikigami, and the overseer of the [[Mystic Onmyou Chamber]].
::'''Shiki Taishou:''' I fell into a deep slumber for too long and the mirror monsters used for training in the Mystic Onmyou Chamber had escaped. When I woke up, I temporarily lost the memory and powers that I once had.
::'''Shiki Taishou:''' With your help, I recovered my memory and restored the Mystic Onmyou Chamber to its original state. We are life-long allies!
::'''Traveler:''' You're right. Sorry, I was sound asleep and I feel a little dazed.
:'''Traveler:''' When I woke up after my nap, the sky was already dark...Ahem&mdash; Three, two, one, one, two, three, ahhhh, ahhhh...
:'''Paimon:''' The incident with the Mystic Onmyou Chamber has just come to an end, a little sleep won't hurt.
:'''Paimon:''' But we did agree to help Shiki Taishou recreate the grilled fish from his memories, we should get going! Tartaglia and Xinyan will help~
:'''Tartaglia:''' I'll do the fishing, pal! I am quite an expert at fishing.
:'''Xinyan:''' I can light a fire with some passionate rock music!
:'''Paimon:''' Then you are in charge of grilling the fish, you are the master chef! And... Paimon will be responsible for taste tasting, hehe~

===Main Menu Dialogue===
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' Paimon, what kind of grilled fish do you like?
:'''Paimon:''' As long as the Traveler made it, Paimon likes them all!
:'''Paimon:''' But for tonight... Paimon wants a grilled fish on the crispier side~
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' Grilled fish with crispy skin... indeed! Just thinking about it has got my appetite going!
----
:'''Paimon:''' Shiki Taishou, what does the grilled fish in your memories taste like?
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' It's been too long, I can't seem to recall...
:'''Paimon:''' Don't worry, the Traveler is a great cook!
:'''Paimon:''' The Traveler can definitely create the flavor you dream of!
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' With such high compliments, I look forward to it!
:'''Paimon:''' No worries, the Traveler is a master chef!
:'''Paimon:''' Next time, you should try grilled slime!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks it would be delicious!
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' Grilled... slime... do you really think it would be tasty?
----
:'''Paimon:''' [[Childe]] is certainly a great fisherman.
:'''Paimon:''' Although he may be a dangerous person, he definitely has many reliable survival skills!
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' He has experienced many things in his past, right?
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' Not only is he skilled, he is able to move me with his profound words.
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' He looks so young...
:'''Paimon:''' And so gentle to friends and family~
:'''Paimon:''' Stick to the principles in your heart and protect the things you cherish.
:'''Paimon:''' Exactly! That's why we are able to grill fish together by the campfire~
----
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' Rock music seems to have originated in [[Fontaine]].
:'''Paimon:''' That's right! Maybe in the future, we will travel there.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon wonders what rock 'n' roll is like over there?
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' I've got high hopes!
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' However, for me, the rock 'n' roll
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' that Xinyan played when we first met is the most special to me.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon agrees! Xinyan's music is just like her, passionate and direct.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon heard that when she performed in Liyue, she was often too enthusiastic,
:'''Paimon:''' and accidentally set a stage on fire!
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' Quiet down now...
----
:'''Paimon:''' Shiki Taishou, what did you use to do with your friends in the past?
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' Most of the time, we practiced martial arts.
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' But occasionally, we would grill fish around the campfire just like we are doing now.
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' And share interesting things we have heard or seen with each other.
:'''Paimon:''' When we were in Mondstadt and Liyue, there were many interesting things that happened to us as well!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon will tell you all about them when we eat the grilled fish together!
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' Sounds good. I have never set foot outside of Inazuma.
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' Please take [[Shiki Koshou]] with you along in your journey. He is connected to my consciousness.
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' Let him take my place and experience the different sceneries of Teyvat.
:'''Paimon:''' No problem!
----
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' I heared there's something called a [[Vision]] which allows its users to harness the power of the elements?
:'''Paimon:''' That's right! But the Traveler is a special case! The Traveler doesn't have a Vision, but can use elemental energy.
:'''Paimon:''' A Vision, must be the kind of power people wish for.
:'''Paimon:''' The power in a wish... is very strong.
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' The power of wishes... I wonder if [[Kamuna Harunosuke|Harunosuke]]'s wish has come true?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon believes that one of his wishes must be:
:'''Paimon:''' That his best friend, Shiki Taishou,
:'''Paimon:''' will find his way and march firmly towards his destiny.
----
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' Paimon, why are you two on this journey?
:'''Paimon:''' To find the [[Traveler's Sibling|Traveler's sibling]].
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' What happens when you find them?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Paimon didn't think that far ahead!
:'''Paimon:''' But even if we find the Traveler's sibling,
:'''Paimon:''' our journey won't end there!
----
:'''Paimon:''' By the way, have you noticed,
:'''Paimon:''' there's a [[Mirror Maiden]] and [[Fatui Pyro Agent|Agent]]
:'''Paimon:''' admiring the sea together~
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' Indeed, they seem to have a good relationship.
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' But let's not get too close to them!
----
:'''Paimon:''' Shiki Taishou, have you seen an [[Oni]] before?
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' Yes, before I fell into a slumber. Why?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon often sees the name [[Arataki Itto|Arataki "The Strongest" Itto]] on the bulletin boards in [[Inazuma City]].
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon heard he's an Oni.
:'''Paimon:''' He doesn't seem very reliable!
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' From what I remember, the Oni Clan values their principles and pride very much.
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' I think you might meet him in your future travels.
----
:'''Paimon:''' Shiki Taishou, let's play the grilled fish game!
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' Grilled fish game... What's that?
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, everyone prepares different seasonings and side dishes, and puts them on the grilled fish.
:'''Paimon:''' Then we take it in turns to close our eyes, pick an ingredient out of the plate,
:'''Paimon:''' taste it, and guess whose ingredient it was.
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' That sounds very interesting.
:'''Paimon:''' Right! I knew you'd get it! Hmm, what should Paimon put in?
:'''Paimon:''' [[Mist Flower Corolla]], [[Lizard Tail]], [[Tricolor Dango]]...
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' ???
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' Are you sure that's edible!?
----
:'''Paimon:''' Wow! This Explosive and Overloaded Grilled Fish tastes really fiery!
:'''Paimon:''' It makes Paimon want to run a few rounds in [[Dragonspine]]!
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' Dragonspine... Isn't it really cold?
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' I'm just a piece of paper. I don't know how it feels to be cold.
:'''Paimon:''' Dragonspine's climate is really cold! Hey, then you are ready for an adventure there!
:'''Paimon:''' In the past, when the Traveler and Paimon scoured Dragonspine looking for treasure chests and [[Chilled Meat]],
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon was so cold and tired!
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' But the look on your face shows that you had a good time.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe~
----
:'''Paimon:''' Shiki Taishou, have you seen the [[Unusual Hilichurl]]?
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' No... Is this hilichurl very special?
:'''Paimon:''' Mm-hmm, it seems to like to enjoy the scenery at various places in Teyvat.
:'''Paimon:''' When we get close to it, it will not attack us actively.
:'''Paimon:''' We even took a photo with it secretly!
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' Well, it seems very gentle.
:'''Paimon:''' That's right! However, it will hit you with [[cabbage]] or a strange stone if it gets frustrated!
----
:'''Paimon:''' Let's get the Traveler to make us some desserts after eating the grilled fish!
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' Paimon, you have such a good appetite.
:'''Paimon:''' I want some [[Rice Pudding]] and [[Almond Tofu]]!
:'''Paimon:''' Try them too! These are desserts that even the Liyue [[adepti]] like!
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' The Liyue adepti like these cuisine?
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' I always thought they were rather otherworldly.
:'''Paimon:''' The Liyue adepti each have their own quirks~
:'''Paimon:''' [[Zhongli|Some]] are knowledgeable but always don't have Mora with them.
:'''Paimon:''' [[Guoba|Some]] will secretly eat [[Golden Shrimp Balls]] when no one's paying attention.
:'''Paimon:''' [[Xiao|Some]] are not very tall but is super powerful and reliable.
:'''Paimon:''' [[Ganyu|Some]] of them work long hours every day and suffer from insomnia, while [[Yanfei|some]] look aloof but is actually really passionate.
:'''Paimon:''' But all of them have a similarity. That is, they love Liyue and its people~
----
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' I just saw the Traveler put a lot of other kinds of meat beside the grilled fish.
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' There's [[Crab]], [[Raw Meat]], [[Ham]], and even Lizard Tail!
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' This is the first time I have seen grilled fish with meat as side dishes.
:'''Paimon:''' Wow! The hilichurls from the Meaty Tribe would love this!
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' Meaty Tribe?
:'''Paimon:''' In the truest sense of the word, the hilichurls from the [[Hilichurls#Meaty Tribe|Meaty Tribe]] love meat!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon can already imagine them dancing happily around this dish!
:'''Paimon:''' And then they will chant "Mosi mita" gleefully!
:'''Shiki Taishou:''' Mosi mita!
