==Description==
The image of the Windblume has been lost amidst the flowing winds of time,<br> 
In times of peace, it has become synonymous with love and gladness. <br>
Sometimes, even the forged weapons that are to be wielded for conquest and victory, <br>
Are adorned with such flowers following the commissioner's or forger's wish. <br>
It seems that this blade was custom-made by someone for their beloved. 
<br><br>
"Iron blades fail to slash it, neither can imprisonment of stones confine it."<br>
"The wind has no fear of future, only constantly flowing in its direction."<br>
The nameless shepherd who belonged not to the church silently told of stories of the wind, <br>
And presented the "flowers" to them in whose eyes the light yet shone. 
<br><br>
If the noble descendants had all but forgotten their original oath, if the conceited silence rose to popularity, <br>
Or if the principle of the blood stood against the flowing wind, the legend of trees and flowers would be forbidden. <br>
In that era, numerous flowers blossomed in places not favored by people. <br>
The flowers were swept away by the wind, yet left an instant of glorious charm in the bleak world. 
<br><br>
"In the shadow cast by the tower of the past, in the alleys and streets of today,"<br>
"In the smallest corners, the flowers are still blooming with the faintest glow." <br>
The nameless shepherd who did not hail from the palace silently told of the flowers' stories. 
<br><br>
He said: "Today, Ludi Harpastum has been taken away by the noble." <br>
But did you know that, in the ruins where mighty winds once swept, there used to be blooming wild flowers over hill and dale?<br>
Those flowers were not the common kind. The stronger the wind blew, the sturdier those flowers' root would grow, and the more they flourished. <br>
The day when the kingdom was dotted with those flowers would be the day when the tower finally fell down.
