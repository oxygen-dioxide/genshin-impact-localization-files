==Description==
The image of the Windblume has been lost amidst the flowing winds of time,<br><!--
-->In times of peace, it has become synonymous with love and gladness.<br><!--
-->Sometimes, even the forged weapons that are to be wielded for conquest and victory,<br><!--
-->Are adorned with such flowers following the commissioner's or forger's wish.<br><!--
-->It seems that this blade was custom-made by someone for their beloved.<br><br><!--
-->"Iron blades fail to slash it, neither can imprisonment of stones confine it."<br><!--
-->"The wind has no fear of future, only constantly flowing in its direction."<br><!--
-->The nameless shepherd who belonged not to the church silently told of stories of the wind,<br><!--
-->And presented the "flowers" to them in whose eyes the light yet shone.<br><br><!--
-->If the noble descendants had all but forgotten their original oath, if the conceited silence rose to popularity,<br><!--
-->Or if the principle of the blood stood against the flowing wind, the legend of trees and flowers would be forbidden.<br><!--
-->In that era, numerous flowers blossomed in places not favored by people.<br><!--
-->The flowers were swept away by the wind, yet left an instant of glorious charm in the bleak world.<br><br><!--
-->"In the shadow cast by the tower of the past, in the alleys and streets of today,"<br><!--
-->"In the smallest corners, the flowers are still blooming with the faintest glow."<br><!--
-->The nameless shepherd who did not hail from the palace silently told of the flowers' stories.<br><br><!--
-->He said: "Today, Ludi Harpastum has been taken away by the noble."<br><!--
-->But did you know that, in the ruins where mighty winds once swept, there used to be blooming wild flowers over hill and dale?<br><!--
-->Those flowers were not the common kind. The stronger the wind blew, the sturdier those flowers' root would grow, and the more they flourished.<br><!--
-->The day when the kingdom was dotted with those flowers would be the day when the tower finally fell down.
