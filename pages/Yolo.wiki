==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yolo:''' Okay, this piece is really gonna pop, like nothing that's been seen before!
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Yolo:''' Hey, a new face! Welcome to the [[Graffiti Alliance]]'s gallery!
::'''Yolo:''' See those paintings on the walls? They're all works done by our very own artists &mdash; each one imbued with its very own soul.
::{{DIcon}} ...Soul?
::'''Yolo:''' That's right! Every piece of graffiti has a soul, just like how every woven scroll contains its own legend.
::'''Yolo:''' You should know, in the distant past, this was more than just a metaphor &mdash; there was once a group of mystics who could infuse shades and hues with the power of the [[Wayob]]. They used graffiti to protect [[Natlan]] from great calamities.
::'''Yolo:''' We might not have that sort of power anymore, but all art possesses an intrinsic soul.
::'''Yolo:''' Different minerals, petals, and even [[saurian]] scales lend unique colors to the pigments they create &mdash; this is the "soul" of graffiti.
::'''Yolo:''' Why don't you try it out for yourself? Don't worry about getting it on your clothes. This is graffiti, the whole point is to have fun!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Yolo:''' Alright, you stay cool now.
