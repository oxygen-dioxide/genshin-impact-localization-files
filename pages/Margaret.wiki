'''Margaret''' is an [[NPC]] in the [[City of Mondstadt]]. She is the proud owner of the [[Cat's Tail]] tavern. Margaret can be found wandering around the fountain plaza at daytime.

Following a certain dialogue branch for the first time gives the player four [[Mondstadt Grilled Fish]].

==Profile==
Margaret is the owner of Cat's Tail, which has recently seen a business boom after hiring [[Diona]]. Margaret's reason for hiring Diona was simple: she is cute, regardless of the fact that she is clearly not old enough to drink alcohol herself.

Despite being a bit simplistic at times, Margaret has a knack for writing witty promotional responses to the messages on the [[Cat's Tail Message Board]], turning it into something of an advice board as people share their troubles on it. She also cottons on to the fact that [[Diluc]] left a message on her board, giving a sympathetic response to his wistfulness for the past and welcoming him to come to Cat's Tail despite being her business rival.

She owns several cats, amongst others are [[Prince]] and [[Butterfly]].

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before completing Master's Day Off)
:'''Margaret:''' Finally, I have the chance to stop you. I've had my eye on your <!--in-game typo--> for a while now &mdash; an outlander wandering the plaza is quite easy to spot.
;(After completing Master's Day Off)
:'''Margaret:''' So, you couldn't resist stopping by again, huh?
:'''Margaret:''' Hehe, that's alright. Thanks again for your help with my little Princey.
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror...
:;(Unlocked after completing "[[A Long Shot]]")
::'''Margaret:''' I must admit that though I'm glad we're all finally safe, I do feel just a bit unsatisfied.
::'''Margaret:''' The [[Angel's Share]] was seriously affected by the dragon attacks as many of its popular drinks had their supplies cut.
::'''Margaret:''' Here at Cat's Tail, we even had an ongoing discount to take further advantage...
::'''Margaret:''' ...But in the end, our sales were still a little less than theirs.
::'''Margaret:''' Still, there's not much I can do about that. It is supplied directly by the Dawn Winery, after all, which gives it an overwhelming advantage in terms of where they get their wine...
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Margaret:''' I'm waiting for someone to invite me for a drink at the tavern. Would that be you?
::'''Margaret:''' Just kidding! Loosen up a little! Mondstadt is a city of romance~!
::{{DIcon}} Well... ahh... Tell me about yourself.
:::'''Margaret:''' Me? I'm just a simple tavern owner.
:::'''Margaret:''' I'm sure you'd noticed my tavern, Cat's Tail, on your way here.
::{{DIcon}} Just how are the taverns around here?
:::'''Margaret:''' I don't like to admit it but the best tavern in the city is Angel's Share.
:::'''Margaret:''' However, ever since I hired Diona as my bartender, business has been looking up.
:::'''Margaret:''' Doesn't matter whether they came for the wine or for her... Money is flooding in now.
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} Tell me, has there been anything happening as of recent?
:::'''Margaret:''' There have. Recently, the Angel's Share has been giving out complimentary Chicken-Mushroom Skewers, and we've been running a promotion response.
:::'''Margaret:''' Since we're the Cat's Tail, our main appetizer has to be Mondstadt Grilled Fish!
:::'''Margaret:''' Anyway, take these, and remember to swing by some time if you're free!
::;(Obtain [[Mondstadt Grilled Fish]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Margaret:''' Leaving already? Don't forget to come see me when you come to Cat's Tail for a night out.

==Event Dialogue==
===Invitation of Windblume===
:'''Margaret:''' Since it's the Windblume Festival, would you like to come to The Cat's Tail and have a few drinks?
:'''Margaret:''' I might even give you some flowers... Hehe.
:{{DIcon}} About the Windblume Festival...
::'''Margaret:''' The Windblume Festival had a very solemn meaning once...
::'''Margaret:''' But nowadays, many people believe that it's just a time when they send flowers to others and get their feelings across.
::'''Margaret:''' Oh? Have someone you'd like to send flowers to, do you? Let me guess... is it me, by any chance?
::'''Margaret:''' ...Haha, don't be so nervous. I was just joking.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
:;(Dialogue options and responses are the same as normal)
:{{DIcon}} Thanks, no need...
::'''Margaret:''' Aww, don't be shy.
