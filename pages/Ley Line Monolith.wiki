'''Ley Line Monoliths''' are objects that appears in certain [[Domains]], [[Quests]], and floors of the [[Spiral Abyss]]. Brimming with energy, these monoliths are known to attract monsters and spectral beings to them. For reasons unknown, monsters generally attack the monoliths.

Normally they are activated as part of a challenge, and the objective is to protect the monolith from [[enemies]]. The monolith will have a certain amount of HP, and if it is destroyed by the enemies, the challenge will end in failure. If all the enemies are defeated while the monolith is still intact or has a certain percent of HP remaining, the challenge will be successfully completed.

[[File:Ley Line Monolith Completion Text.png|thumb|Completion text]]
* Upon completing a Ley Line Monolith challenge, text from the [[Latin-Based Language]] appears, which reads: ''Abyssos'', ''SOL dromus'', ''Pronoea'', ''Fortuna''. In versions prior to [[Version 1.2]], the text instead said "miHoYo," "switch," "weekly," and "dungeon."
