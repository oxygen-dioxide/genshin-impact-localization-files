|description    = Humanity's best friend!<br>These originate from a canine species from the far north and have a body of thick gray-white fur. They are quite hardy against the cold and are of an honest and lively character.<br>However, the temperate climate of the Realm Within tends to lend to their lazy side. Be sure to play with them more to keep them from getting too fat!
