They say that yumekui-baku can devour all nightmares, and that their soothing melodies help people drift into a peaceful slumber. Perhaps placing this in your bedroom will bring you sweet dreams too.<br>Don't stare at the spinning yumekui-baku for too long, though &mdash; you'll probably end up feeling rather dizzy!
