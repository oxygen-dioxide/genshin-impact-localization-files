===AI Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
