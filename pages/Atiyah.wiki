:'''Atiyah:''' Friend! A moment, please! You look like someone of skill. Would you be interested in joining [[the Eremites]]?
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Atiyah/Unseen Peril|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Atiyah:''' Oh, wow. I think I got lucky there, so don't worry about it.
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Atiyah:''' Ow, ow, ow. You're really strong, huh... Bet you'd do real well as an Eremite...
:{{DIcon}} Does it come with benefits?
::'''Atiyah:''' Oh, lots!
::'''Atiyah:''' First, this is one of the few ways you can get out of Aaru Village.
::'''Atiyah:''' Get out of this desolate dump, and the world will be your oyster! Every young and ambitious soul longs to see the world, no?
::'''Atiyah:''' And we might all be people of the desert, sure, but you can bet that we know how to wrangle Mora off those tree-dwellers!
::'''Atiyah:''' Those from the Akademiya have the fattest wallets. They never quibble over prices or delay payments.
::'''Atiyah:''' You just need to take one of their commissions, and you'll be set!
::'''Atiyah:''' You won't find a better Mora-making venture anywhere else!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I'll give that some thought.
:::'''Atiyah:''' ...Well, other than the stuff I mentioned earlier, our food is just the best! If you don't believe me, just try this!
:::'''Atiyah:''' The way we treat our people is beyond reproach. That much I can guarantee!
::;(Obtain {{Item|Shawarma Wrap|20|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to do at the moment.
::'''Atiyah:''' Oh? Are you sure there are better things to do than being a mercenary?
::'''Atiyah:''' Well, that's a right shame, but you can always come back to me if you change your mind!
