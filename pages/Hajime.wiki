==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Hajime:''' Sorry, I have a lot on my plate right now. I can only talk to you while I work. Would you like to buy a weapon? Or do you have a forging request?
----
;(If nothing has been forged)
:{{DIcon|Forging}} I want you to forge something for me...
::'''Hajime:''' Bring me the materials, and I will get to work right away.
;(If something has been forged but not collected yet)
:{{DIcon|Forging}} I'd like something made.
::'''Hajime:''' The previous job you asked me to do has been completed. See if it's to your satisfaction or not. By the way, do you have anything else for me?
----
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'm looking for a handy weapon.
::'''Hajime:''' These are all works of the Amenoma Art that have been approved by my master. Take a gander.
:{{DIcon|!}} Do you have any information about Inazuman ores?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Hajime knows; Version 1)
:::'''Hajime:''' Ah, are you asking about locations where you can find our locally-produced ores? Well, I do have some intel. It's just that my work here as an apprentice at Amenoma Smithy keeps me ever so occupied...
:::'''Hajime:''' Speaking of which, my master gave me some Magical Crystal Ore lately. It's quite different from the usual materials I work with, and I'm not as familiar as I could be just yet.
:::'''Hajime:''' Let's do it like this: I'll mark the locations of the Magical Crystal Ores on your map, and you can mine them and have a look. If you figure out a way to work with them, it would be great if you could tell me.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Hajime knows; Version 2)
:::'''Hajime:''' Ah, are you asking about locations where you can find our locally-produced ores? Well, I do have some intel. It's just that my work here as an apprentice at Amenoma Smithy keeps me ever so occupied...
:::'''Hajime:''' How about this, then? I'll mark these ore locations on your map. Bring them back to me, and I'll see what I can do about them.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Hajime knows)
:::'''Hajime:''' I'm sorry, but the nearby veins have all been mined, and I don't have any new information on hand, either. Best you come back again later.
:{{DIcon}} About yourself...
::'''Hajime:''' Me? I'm just a regular apprentice swordsmith. I do whatever my master tells me to do.
::'''Hajime:''' As you can see, I practice forging every day, earn a meager salary, and listen to my master's endless lectures...
::'''Hajime:''' Although I'm the senior disciple, I'm not sure if the master's really counting on me to take over the Amenoma Art.
::'''Hajime:''' ...Well, whatever. It's not a bad idea, as long as I get paid more.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} It's tough being a disciple.
:::'''Hajime:''' *sigh* You said it... It'd be bad if my master hears me complaining. If he overhears, he'll lecture me for the entire day.
:::'''Hajime:''' Thank you for your concern. Seeing as you are a Traveler on the move, I'll give these ores to you. If something is wrong with your weapon, they might be of use to you.
::;(Obtain [[Crystal Chunk]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Hajime:''' Okay, I'll see you whenever you've got another job for me.
