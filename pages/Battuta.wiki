===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing [[The Rainbow Destined to Burn]]''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Battuta:''' W&mdash;Wait a moment, time out! This is way too much exercise for a scholar like me...
:'''Nzinga:''' What, for real? But you've only done a tiny bit more since our last outing. Training load's gotta go up sometime.
:'''Nzinga:''' Can't start teaching you how to wrestle properly until your basic fitness is up to snuff.
:'''Nzinga:''' Aren't you looking forward to the day when you'll unleash your inner beast for the whole world to see?
:'''Battuta:''' Well, not like I'm going pro, is it... I just wanted to get a little &mdash; emphasis on "a little" &mdash; exercise...
:'''Nzinga:''' I see... Shame. You're quite the looker, you know? The crowds would love you.
:'''Battuta:''' Huh!? Wh&mdash;What kind of marketing tactic is that?
:'''Nzinga:''' Hmm? I think you might've gotten the wrong end of the stick &mdash; I wasn't planning on charging you. I have to exercise myself, so helping someone else out in the meantime's no sweat off my back.
:'''Battuta:''' Okay, I... I guess I'll give this another shot, then?
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing [[The Rainbow Destined to Burn]]''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Battuta:''' Am I... really up to it?
:{{DIcon}} Is something the matter?
::'''Battuta:''' *panting*... I... Should be fine. My fitness coach left me some daily exercises to get on with, so I'm doing my best to finish them.
::'''Battuta:''' But to be honest, though I've certainly gotten somewhat fitter after all this time, I still find this back-to-back stair-climbing quite challenging...
::'''Battuta:''' When the [[Abyss]] invaded, my coach went back to her tribe to help out. I have no idea when she'll be back.
::'''Battuta:''' But I don't want to trouble the couriers with such a trivial matter, especially as my stamina's still lacking...
::'''Battuta:''' I'm still quite a way from reaching the goals she set for me, so I guess I'd better just grit my teeth and keep chugging on for now.
:{{DIcon}} You've got this.
::'''Battuta:''' Eh? ...O&mdash;Okay then!
