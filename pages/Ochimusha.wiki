{{Lang|'''Ochimusha'''|ja=落武者|ja_rm=Ochimusha}} are [[Common Enemies]] found during the [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual]] [[World Quest]] series and in the [[Three Realms Gateway Offering]]. They appear as ghostly versions of the [[Kairagi]].

They are creatures created by the coalescence of filth that appear as samurai. Their forms are often swayed by the thought and memories of the times.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Yougou Cleansing}}</ref>

They are infused with either {{Color|Pyro}} ([[Ochimusha: Cankered Flame|Cankered Flame]]) or {{Color|Electro}} ([[Ochimusha: Ensorcelled Thunder|Ensorcelled Thunder]]).

==Appearances==
* [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual]]: All parts
** [[A Strange Story in Konda]], [[Konda Village]] well: an Ochimusha appears with the epithet "Phantom Warrior Beneath the Konda Village Well"
** [[Sacrificial Offering]]: a Mysterious Samurai appears with the epithet "Phantom Warrior of the Abandoned Shrine"
** [[Cleansing Defilement]]: the Ochimusha appear with the epithet "Filth Forced From the Thunder Sakura's Roots"
* Ochimusha may also appear in some [[Time Trial Challenge]]s and [[Sword Hilt]] puzzles
* [[Three Realms Gateway Offering]]

==Strategy==
Ochimusha are the same as Kairagi and are dealt with the same way. With the exception of one Sword Hilt puzzle, all Ochimusha are fought alone, although the one in [[Higi Village]] also has a [[Kairagi: Dancing Thunder]] at the spot.

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* An {{Lang|{{w|ochimusha}}|ja={{Rubi|落|おち|武|む|者|しゃ}}|ja_rm=ochimusha|ja_tl=fallen warrior}} was a samurai of a defeated army who survived and fled the battlefield, and in some cases sought refuge in villages in the mountains.<ref>Japanese Wiki Corpus: [https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ochimusha.html Ochimusha]</ref>
