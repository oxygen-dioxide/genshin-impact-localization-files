==Messages==
{{Dialogue Start}}
===Introduction===
<!-- The below dialogue is presented differently from the intro message in [[Mondstadt General Goods Order Board]] where it precedes all other messages. Here it's treated like a regular messaged displayed at random. Therefore it should be put under its own section. -->
:'''Diwan Bulletin Board:''' This Bulletin Board is set up by Vizier to publicize important matters in [[Sumeru City]]. Questions or doubts regarding the notices on the Bulletin Board can be posted here as well.

===Magic Bottle===
:'''Message:''' "Magic bottles for sale. Magic bottles that can harness the power of spirits. Please leave your payment here. Grants any wish, only one [[Mora]]."
:'''Message:''' "Magic bottles for sale. Magic bottles that grant any wishes. The price is only one Mora."
:'''Message:''' "I'm a [[Jinni]]. Just give me one Mora and I'll grant any wish of yours."
:'''Citadel of Regzar Announcement:''' "The [[Citadel of Regzar]] is investigating the recent string of scams. Please do not panic."
:'''Citadel of Regzar Announcement:''' "Any victims who have further questions may seek consultation for just one Mora."

===Unsigned Poem===
:'''Unsigned Poem:''' "The [[Sumeru City|city of wisdom]] is ours, as is the [[Avidya Forest|forest of ignorance]]. Atop the [[Divine Tree|tree]] lies the remnants of the kingdom of lost dreams."

===Mushroom===
:'''Forest Watcher Announcement:''' "If you see dancing fairies after consuming mushrooms, please do not be alarmed. It is a normal reaction."
:'''Forest Watcher Announcement:''' "But if the plants around you are starting to speak, please seek help from the nearest [[Forest Ranger]] immediately."

===The Withering===
:'''Forest Watcher Announcement:''' "Due to unknown reasons, [[The Withering]] has been showing signs of expansion in both quantity and size throughout the forest."
:'''Forest Watcher Announcement:''' "Not only does the Withering cause vegetation in the area to wilt, it may also be lethal to wildlife and even humans. The Forest Watchers have set up Contamination Zones to mark the area under the influence of The Withering. Please stay away from such areas."
:'''Forest Watcher Announcement:''' "If you notice a new patch of The Withering in the forest, please contact a nearby [[Forest Ranger]] to have it handled professionally."

===Nilou===
:'''Message:''' "I've been to many nations and watched countless performances. There isn't a shred of doubt in me that [[Nilou]] is the best dancer in [[Teyvat]]. But not only were the pedants from the [[Akademiya]] unable to appreciate her performance, they even complained about it! What an insult to art!"
:'''Message:''' "Based on my experience in [[Mondstadt]], we should organize a fan club for Nilou. Then those people who don't know anything about art wouldn't dare to insult her again."
:'''Reply:''' "A fan club... Is that a part of Mondstadt's culture? Anyway... A perfect performance is a joint effort of everyone in the troupe. Placing all the attention on a single person is just not fair."
:'''Reply:''' "Moreover, [[Nilou|I]] believe that art itself is a bond that brings people together. I'm very happy that you enjoyed Nilou's performance."
:'''Message:''' "Based on that elegant handwriting, you must be a young lady, right? It's so good to know that there's someone who enjoys watching dance performance. May I ask if you would like to have a cup of coffee together sometime?"
:'''Reply:''' "Sorry, I'm very busy. Please speak to my [[Sheikh Zubayr|manager]] if you need any help."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "Looks like this guy got rejected. The final message is clearly written by a tough man... he's probably the [[Dehya|bodyguard]] of a [[Dunyarzad|rich lady]] or something."

===Forest Watcher===
:'''Message:''' "Ever since I became a [[Forest Watcher]], I spent all my time in the forest. If this keeps up, I'm gonna start talking to [[Dusk Bird]]s."
:'''Message:''' "If only I could understand them... I wouldn't be as bored as I am now."

===Satyavada Life===
:'''Mahamata Announcement:''' If you encounter anyone with a blank gaze or muttering to themselves in the forest, they are researchers in Satyavada Life. Please do not disturb them.
:'''Mahamata Announcement:''' If they cause any concern, please report it to the [[Mahamata]] for proper handling of the matter.

===Diwan and Vizier===
:'''Message:''' "I heard that Diwan used to be an organization that spoke out for us downtown commoners, but now it just obeys whatever the [[Mahamata]] say."
:'''Message:''' "[[Vizier]] too. That man never keeps his word. He's only there when the Mahamata tries to shed responsibility."
;(Before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
::'''Mahamata Announcement:''' The Akademiya's guidance to all administrative bodies is based on the guidance of [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]]. Please refrain from slander.
;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
::'''Mahamata Announcement:''' The Akademiya's role is to provide guidance to all administrative bodies. Please refrain from slander.

===Rishboland Raja===
:'''Vandalized Bulletin:''' "Notice: We are looking for experts to deal with [[Rishboland Tiger]]s"
:'''Vandalized Bulletin:''' The message of the notice is blotted with a paintbrush. Besides it is a sentence in slanting, childish handwriting...
:'''Vandalized Bulletin:''' "Rishboland Raja just wanted to play with people!"

===Canned Knowledge===
:'''Matra Announcement:''' The [[matra]] have discovered multiple cases of illegal [[Canned Knowledge]] trade during recent inspections in local bazaars.
:'''Matra Announcement:''' Trading of Canned Knowledge is prohibited by the Akademiya and will be severely punished upon discovery.
:'''Matra Announcement:''' The [[Akademiya]] will not be held responsible for any consequences of illegal usage of Canned Knowledge.

===Lord Sangemah Bay===
:'''[[Dori|Lord Sangemah Bay]]:''' "My friend, are you troubled by anything? Look no further! The Almighty Lord Sangemah Bay is here to give you all the answers you seek."
:'''Lord Sangemah Bay:''' "All it costs is a little Mora, and all your problems will be resolved in no time."
:'''Lord Sangemah Bay:''' "Take action before it's too late! Contact information..."
:'''Diwan Notice:''' This Bulletin Board is set up by Sir [[Vizier]] to regulate market transactions. Please do not post any advertisements here.

===Sabzeruz Festival===
:'''Message:''' "The annual [[Sabzeruz Festival]] is just around the corner. A grand festival will be held in the [[Grand Bazaar]] same as last year."
:'''Message:''' "To heat up the festival ambiance, our lady has prepared a special subsidy for all participating merchants."
:'''Message:''' "Let's celebrate [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]]'s birthday together!"

===Al-Ahmar===
:'''Message:''' "He's back! My Lord, [[Al-Ahmar]], is back!"
:'''Message:''' "The day he returns will be the day of retribution for all you leaf-heads!"
:'''[[Matra]] Announcement:''' This is fake news, and we are currently investigating its source. All matters in Sumeru are posted regularly in the [[Akasha]]. Please do not trust any rumors.

===Missing Person Poster===
:'''Missing Person Poster:''' "[[Dunyarzad|Our lady]] left home and still hasn't returned. If you see a young girl with brown hair wearing a blue and purple dress, please contact the [[Homayani Family|Homayani family]]. You will be duly thanked for your help!"
:'''Missing Person Poster:''' "If our lady herself sees this poster, please contact us immediately. Your parents are very worried about you."

===Flame-Mane===
:'''Message:''' "I hired a pretty decent mercenary a while ago. I think she's called [[Dehya|Flame-Mane]] or something..."
:'''Message:''' "I brought her along with me each time I went out to the sea for business. Doesn't matter if it's [[Treasure Hoarders]] or the [[Millelith]] &mdash; with her by my side, there was nothing to fear. I made a fortune all thanks to her."
:'''Message:''' "But I don't think I've seen her accepting any commissions lately, and I heard monsters have increased in number on the path to [[Liyue]]... I may have to put my money in the [[Kalimi Exchange]] if this goes on."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "You don't sound like someone who does legit business... But if it's the Flame-Mane, I heard that she's been hired by the [[Homayani family]]. You're gonna have to wait quite a while before she's available again."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "And a word of advice, your money will be better spent buying 100 carpets than investing in the Kalimi Exchange!"
:'''[[Sulaykha]] Carpets:''' "You're absolutely right! Please visit our shop to buy some carpets! I can even explain in detail about how you can use each of them!"

===Storyteller===
:'''Message:''' "Does anyone know where to find an excellent storyteller? It has to be someone who can tell a story exactly as it is."
:'''Message:''' "I'm being haunted by a terrifying [[Jinni]]. It's threatening to kill me if I don't tell it the exact same story every day. It's been a month now, and my brain is turning to mush from this torture..."
:'''Another Person's Message:''' "What a strange experience. But I've heard of a storyteller called [[Maddah]] in [[Puspa Café]]. He might be able to help you."
