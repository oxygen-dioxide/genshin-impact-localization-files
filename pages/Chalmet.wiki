:'''Chalmet:''' Phew... That's another batch of files organized. I'm making good progress!
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Chalmet:''' Honorary Senior Researcher, how wonderful to see you. I'm organizing these files and folders in accordance with Monsieur Raimondo's instructions.
::'''Chalmet:''' This part of the archive wasn't so badly hit by the explosion and is still structurally sound, so the files are in good shape.
::'''Chalmet:''' Although I'm not sure how useful they are now... But we should at least get them properly filed first.
::{{DIcon}} Have you found anything of value?
::'''Chalmet:''' A lot of it is old and out of date. Reports, memos, progress updates, things like that.
::'''Chalmet:''' But I found also some data from projects which were halted before completion, and even some detailed descriptions of their work.
::'''Chalmet:''' And those could be useful, as the Institute is planning to restart its research projects.
::'''Chalmet:''' So overall, everything is moving in the right direction. How wonderful.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Chalmet:''' Yeah. I'll keep on organizing the documents.
