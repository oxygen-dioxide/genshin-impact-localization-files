'''Bubbles''' are objects that can arise from [[Ley Line Disorders]], [[Auras]], or from attacks from certain enemies ([[Large Hydro Slime]], [[Hydro Abyss Mage]], [[Hydro Hypostasis]], [[Floating Hydro Fungus]], [[Hydro Hilichurl Rogue]]). [[Sigewinne]] is also capable of using bubbles.

Bubbles deal {{Color|Physical DMG}} or {{Color|Hydro DMG}} on impact and will trap the player inside, depending on the bubble and its location, causing the same [[displacement|immobilizing]] effect as [[Mona]]'s [[Stellaris Phantasm]]. These bubbles can also trap small enemies as well as apply the {{Color|Wet}} status to any enemies on contact.

Bubbles can be popped prematurely when hit by any player attack, or if they hit a construct or enemy in their path.

Some bubbles have {{Hydro}} applied to them, and attacking them with {{Dendro}} will cause [[Bloom]] and spawn a Dendro Core.

==Getting Trapped==
If the player gets trapped in a bubble, they will be unable to attack or switch to other characters and a red üîó button will appear on the right half of the screen. Players can repeatedly press this button (mobile devices), the {{Key|ps-x}} button (PlayStation), the {{Key|xb-a}} button (Xbox), or {{Key|Space}} (PC) to break free from it.
