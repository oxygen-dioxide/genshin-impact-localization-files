|description    = Humanity's best friend!<br>These were domesticated and bred to be the partners of hunters in the mountains and forests. They are docile with acute senses and can still serve as the guardians of house and home.<br>Though life in the Realm Within is perfectly safe, they still keep vigilant watch near the door, allowing their master to feel completely at ease.
