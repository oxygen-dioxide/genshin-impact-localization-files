==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach [[The Chasm]] for the first time)
:'''Tie Hong:''' Halt! The Chasm is sealed off. If you're an outsider, please... Oh, it's you!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh no, run!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, come on now.
:{{DIcon}} You know me?
:{{DIcon}} We've been recognized! Time to scoot!
:'''Tie Hong:''' Hahaha! Sorry for scaring you. Of course I remember you. How could I forget the person who saved my life?
:'''Tie Hong:''' I was only recently transferred here myself... Didn't think I'd meet you here. Guess I'm a lucky guy, eh?
:'''Paimon:''' We saved you? Did we do that?
:'''Tie Hong:''' Oh, come now! I was at the [[Jade Chamber]] when we fought that sea monster together. I was lightly injured and only returned to my post recently...
:'''Tie Hong:''' You might not remember me, but I'll never forget you. All our comrades who fought that day witnessed what you did for Liyue.
:{{DIcon}} Could you tell me a bit about The Chasm?
:'''Tie Hong:''' Two years ago, an unknown incident occurred deep within the caverns and the [[Qixing]] gave the order to close the place. The miners were largely evacuated to safety.
:'''Tie Hong:''' It's just a shame that such a huge mine ceased production, just like that. The workers took their compensation and went their separate ways... Once such a gathering of people is dispersed, I fear it may be difficult to get them back together again.
:'''Tie Hong:''' ...Um, sorry, got a bit off-topic there. I believe that you must be here on important business, so I won't bother you any further. If you have any questions, just ask [[Muning]] directly. He should be at the campsite at the mine entrance.
:'''Tie Hong:''' Also, uh, it's not that I don't trust you or anything, but it's my job to remind you not to do anything that breaks the law!
:'''Paimon:''' Don't worry, you can trust us, come on!

;(Talk to Tie Hong again)
:'''Tie Hong:''' I apologize, but it is my duty to guard this path. If you are not here on important business, please do not remain here for too long.
