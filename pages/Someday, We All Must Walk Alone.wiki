==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Your little Saurian companion seems to have something to tell you...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After completing all requisite requirements)
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm? What's wrong, {{Little One}}? Is there something you wanna tell us?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Wroooh...
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe he's tired, we should take a break... Hmm, Paimon has an idea, why don't we relax at the place where we first met?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Alrighty! {{Traveler}}, let's go!

;(Enter the [[Rest Area Entrance|rest area]])
:'''Paimon:''' {{Little One}}...? Where'd he get this Kamera?

;(Talk to {{Little One}})
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, {{Little One}}, where'd you get this Kamera from?
:'''Paimon:''' Did you sneak up on someone and... No way!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrooo!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Mrrraa... Rawr! Rawr! Groooah...
:{{DIcon}} That move looks familiar...
::'''Paimon:''' Oho! Isn't that the "Mighty Meaty Fireball"?
:{{DIcon}} It's the "Mighty Meaty Fireball"!
::'''Paimon:''' Now that you mention it, Paimon sorta remembers...
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, back in the [[Children of Echoes]], wasn't there this [[Akatanga|guy]] who wanted to be a director, but used his Kamera the wrong way round... Ah! Is that where you got your Kamera?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Ehrr... Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' You wanna take a picture with us, right? Hehe, Paimon gets you!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah... we've been adventuring for so long, but haven't taken any pictures together! Now that the little one's curse has been lifted, he can finally grow up big and strong!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon isn't sure how long it takes for [[Tepetlisaur]]s to grow up... If {{Little One}} turns into an adult tomorrow, we won't get to see him as a baby anymore!
:{{DIcon}} ...
::'''Paimon:''' Come on, hehe, let's take that picture!
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, let's take it!
:'''Paimon:''' Master Photographer Paimon's set everything up, this should be just right! And the Kamera's definitely facing us!
:'''Paimon:''' Everyone, say "Mighty Meaty Fireball" in three, two, one!
:{{DIcon}} "Mighty Meaty Fireball"!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Raaawr!

:'''Paimon:''' There we go. Wow, {{Little One}} is really striking an impressive pose!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! 
:{{Black Screen|{{Little One}} takes one of the photographs, turns around, and carefully tucks it away beneath the hard shell on his back.}}
:'''Paimon:''' But why did {{Little One}} suddenly want to take a picture?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Groooah...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Wroooh...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Wroooh... Roooah...
:'''Paimon:''' What's wrong, {{Little One}}? Are you feeling unwell? Hmm... He doesn't look very happy...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Raaawr!
:{{DIcon}} {{Little One}}...
::{{DIcon}} You want to set off on your own adventure...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Your... own adventure? Don't you wanna keep traveling with us? Uh oh, did Paimon do something to make you mad...?
:'''Paimon:''' P&mdash;Paimon won't call you greedy again! Please, d&mdash;don't leave us!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Wroooh...
:{{DIcon}} ...Paimon.
:'''Paimon:''' *sniff* P&mdash;Paimon knows... Everyone's gotta grow up someday... and *sob* everyone has places they wanna go...
:'''Paimon:''' But... Paimon doesn't want to say goodbye... Not all of a sudden like this...
:{{DIcon}} Don't cry. We'll meet again someday...
:'''Paimon:''' Really? Wh&mdash;When we need help in the future, you'd better come find us right away, {{Little One}}!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' And... if you run into trouble on your adventures, {{Little One}}, you can come find us then too! Don't try to act tough!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' ...Don't eat too much, and don't pick fights you can't win. Paimon said not to eat too much, but you should still eat plenty of meat stew...
:'''Paimon:''' A&mdash;A&mdash;And...! Th&mdash;The most important thing of all... is that you should...
:{{DIcon}} Grow up happy and healthy...
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah! Happy and healthy and big! Till you're the size of at least three mountains!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Rawr! Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Y&mdash;Yup! Th&mdash;That's the spirit! *sob* D&mdash;Don't you dare forget about us!
:{{Black Screen|Lastly... you linger briefly on [[Kukulkan|the one who communicates in strange golden script]]...<br>As Paimon puts it, "He was just using us! He never even showed his face."<br>It makes you think back to the complex mix of emotions reflected in the eyes of your young saurian companion at the foot of the Sacred Mountain.<br>...Although he is still small, he will surely grow up to become a mighty saurian indeed.}}
:{{Black Screen|In the very, very end, he presses his horn against Paimon's forehead, before nuzzling tenderly at your outstretched palm.<br>Then, after a long pause, in which he seems to be mustering up the courage...}}
:{{Black Screen|The young saurian resolutely turns around and plods off into the distance.}}
:'''Paimon:''' Go on...
:'''Paimon:''' *sob* Have an awesome adventure!
{{Dialogue End}}
