|text      = For the past few days, quite some students from the [[Akademiya]] have been approaching me to say, "Happy birthday, Madam Faruzan." Regardless of their academic prowess, they certainly exhibit a commendable attitude towards their elders. Indeed, I am quite pleased.

Ah, seeing these well-behaved young people naturally reminds me of you. Have you recently tackled any new mechanisms or puzzles? Oh, and are you heading to [[Natlan]] soon? Wherever you go, remember you have my personal endorsement. Your skills and talents are rather exceptional, so I have great confidence in you!

However, much like in research, planning ahead in your adventures is always beneficial. I recall there are many ancient texts that document the "Remnants of the Secret Source" in Natlan, so I have compiled the key points into this book for you. Take a look, and feel free to ask me if you have any questions.

Just address me as "Madam Faruzan" and I will be more than happy to provide you with an exposition, ahem.
