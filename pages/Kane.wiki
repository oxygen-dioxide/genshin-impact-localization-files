{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kane:''' I'm heading east. Don't you come with, you hear?
:'''Kanaloa:''' Hehe, I had no idea you were so worried about me. Funnily enough, I worry about you too &mdash; that once you're out there in the east, you'll end up getting yourself trapped down some dead end.
:'''Kane:''' And you're just gonna follow me right into it? Sounds like a great plan.
:'''Kanaloa:''' Whatever, you think I actually buy your story? I'm telling you, I'm about to head west. What are the chances that we'll end up bumping into each other over there, huh?
:'''Kane:''' ...Ugh, you're so annoying. Why d'you have to make a simple treasure hunt so complicated... Can't we just work together for once?
:'''Kane:''' If we end up fighting like we did last time, our kid brother's gonna go looking for [[Chasca]] again.
:'''Kanaloa:''' Hmm, when you put it like that, I guess we would be better off working together...
:'''Kanaloa:''' It would be kind of embarrassing if we had to get The Peacemaker involved for something so small.
