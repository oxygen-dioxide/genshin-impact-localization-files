:{{DIcon|Idle}} More or less the same.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Semaine:''' Work is about the same no matter where you go &mdash; being here is best.
:{{DIcon}} And why is that?
::'''Semaine:''' Because my workplace is closer to where I live.
::'''Semaine:''' My previous work was related to the courts, so I had to shuttle between the [[Palais Mermonia]] and the [[Opera Epiclese|opera house]]. This location, on the other hand, is far more convenient.
::'''Semaine:''' Sometimes, I head over there to watch a performance &mdash; and what do you know, I do sometimes miss my previous workplaces when I see them.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Semaine:''' Take care.
