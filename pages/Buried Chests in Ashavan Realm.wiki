==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Open the first Exquisite Chest)
:'''Paimon:''' What's with this chest? Hmm... Bah, no luck...

;(Open the second Exquisite Chest)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? This again? Prank chests like these really tick Paimon off!

;(Open the third Exquisite Chest)
:'''Paimon:''' B&mdash;But... They do say that "third time's the charm," so this has got to be the last time!

;(Open the fourth Exquisite Chest)
:'''Paimon:''' Gah! That saying is absolutely wrong! This is the fourth time we've encountered these weird chests!

;(Open the fifth Exquisite Chest)
:'''Paimon:''' Argh, our streak of bad luck hasn't ended yet... Yet another chest with nothing good in it...

;(Open the sixth Exquisite Chest)
:'''Paimon:''' Why is this happening? (Traveler), how many times have we encountered this type of weird chest? Do you remember?

;(Open the seventh Exquisite Chest)
:'''Paimon:''' Urgh... There's nothing good in these chests! Can they even be called treasure chests at this point...?

;(Open the eighth Exquisite Chest)
:'''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What? More!? There's no end to this!

;(Open the ninth Exquisite Chest)
:'''Paimon:''' Is this... a treasure map? Did someone leave all those weird treasure chests behind on purpose?
:'''Paimon:''' Come on, now! How could someone play such a stupid prank? But y'know what, let's go check out the place marked on the map when we get the chance anyway...
:'''Paimon:''' This person went through a lot of trouble to prepare these weird treasure chests... Paimon wonders whether this quest will go down as a surprise or a scare...
;(Obtain [[Treasure Map in a Box]])

;(Open the first Precious Chest)
:'''Paimon:''' Why's there a note under the chest? Was it left by the same person who left the treasure map?

;(Investigate the note under the first Precious Chest)
:'''Note at the Bottom of the Chest:''' "Congratulations! Whoever this is!"
:'''Note at the Bottom of the Chest:''' "Haha, not that that idiot will be able to find this chest."
:'''Note at the Bottom of the Chest:''' "To whomsoever is reading this note, here's another piece of good news for you."
:'''Note at the Bottom of the Chest:''' "That glass house... the one near that [[Pardis Dhyai|Para some Dhya]] thing, the one with the [[Nilotpala Lotus]] pond? There's some other good stuff there."
:'''Note at the Bottom of the Chest:''' "It's so close by but that dummy's head is full of research and academic papers. Totally clueless! Hehe!"
:'''Paimon:''' ...So, what did this person prepare so many weird chests for?
:'''Paimon:''' If it's to make the "dummy" in question angry, but the person in question knows nothing about all this, aren't all these preparations pointless in the end?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Paimon {{sic|don't}} get it. Looks like there are a lot of incomprehensible {{sic|weirdo}} in this world who do all kinds of strange things!

;(Dig up the second Precious Chest)
:'''Paimon:''' Woah, what a {{sic|luxurious chest|hide=1}}! But we still don't know who this "dummy" is...
:'''Paimon:''' Well, we got the chest, and the weird person achieved their goal. The "dummy" knows nothing about this and remains completely unbothered.
:'''Paimon:''' Sooo, this can be considered a "win-win-win," right? Something to celebrate for sure!
