==Trivia==
===Etymology===
*The English name, Gandharva Ville, combines the Sanskrit {{lang|''{{w|gandharva}}''|sa=गन्धर्व}} with the French word {{lang|mini=1|fr=''{{wt|ville||French}}''|fr_tl=city}}, making the name mean "Gandharva City." This is a reference to {{lang|''Gandharvanagara''|sa=गन्धर्वनगर|sa_tl=city of the Gandharvas}}, an illusory city that appears as a mirage but does not actually exist.<ref>Wisdom Library: [https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/gandharvanagara ''gandharvanagara'']</ref> (See the below explanation of the original Chinese location name for additional context.)
*The {{zh|化城|rm=Huàchéng}} in the Chinese name is derived from part of the seventh chapter in the {{w|Lotus Sutra}}, which sometimes translated into English as the {{lang|''Parable of the Phantom City''|zh=化城喻}} or ''The Apparitional City''. In it, the leader of a treasure-seeking group conjures an illusory city for the others to rest in when they become too tired and afraid to continue on their journey. After seeing they were well-rested, he dispels the illusion and urges them to continue towards their true destination.<ref>Wisdom Library: [https://www.wisdomlib.org/buddhism/book/the-lotus-sutra/d/doc61726.html The Lotus Sutra: Chapter VII - The Apparitional City]</ref>
