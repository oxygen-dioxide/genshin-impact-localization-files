'''Rezki''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in the [[World Quest]] ''[[For Her Judgment Reaches to the Skies...]]''. 

==Profile==
Rezki was one of [[Babel]]'s assassins. The Matriarch sent him and [[Nayram]] to kill the [[Traveler]] in order to secure possession of [[Liloupar]] as part of her plan to occupy [[The Orchard of Pairidaeza]]. Nayram and Rezki failed in their mission, being defeated by [[Jeht]] and the Traveler.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|For Her Judgment Reaches to the Skies...}}</ref>

===Personality===
Rezki is an experienced and senior Falcon, initially letting Nayram, a younger and weaker Falcon, take the Traveler and Jeht alone. He does appear to show some concern for her, as he joins in the fight when she's critically wounded. Despite being confident in his abilities, Rezki eventually regretted taking on Babel's offer, complaining that he shouldn't have taken the job as his final words.

===Appearance===
Rezki takes on the appearance of an [[Eremite Sunfrost]].
