==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|After arriving at the [[Guizhong Ballista]] on [[Mt. Tianheng]], you are surprised to meet another member of the [[Qixing]] there. Her name is [[Keqing]], and she gives you detailed instructions on how to ascend to the [[Jade Chamber]]. [[Paimon]], however, is preoccupied with another detail that Keqing mentioned: the custom of bringing a greeting gift.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Bu'yun at Yuehai Pavilion, before preparing the gift)
:'''Bu'yun:''' Though clouds may darken and light turn to gloam, still the moon over the Chamber roams...
:'''Bu'yun:''' May I help you?
:{{DIcon}} Could you take us up to the Jade Chamber?
:: '''Bu'yun:''' You perceive the mansion, but not the moon, and it is not in my power to bring them to you. Please await another opportunity.
:{{DIcon}} It's nothing.
::{{A|vo dialog lyaq202 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, (Traveler), we haven't prepared our gift yet. We're not ready to go to the Jade Chamber!
::{{A|vo dialog lyaq202 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're sorry, it's nothing. See you around!
{{Dialogue end}}

===Gathering Ingredients===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the southern spot)
:{{A|vo lyaq202 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh! Look at that [[Slimes|slime]]! It looks crystal clear... and very delicious!
:{{A|vo lyaq202 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's the one!
;(After defeating the slime)
:;(Obtain [[Tasty Slime Condensate]] ×1)
----
;(Approach the northern spot)
:{{A|vo lyaq202 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Is it just Paimon, or is there a sweet fragrance in the air...?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... Did you hear that?
:{{DIcon}} It sounded like someone calling out for help.
::{{A|vo lyaq202 1 paimon 05a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It seemed like it came from those ruins over there...
:{{DIcon}} It sounded like someone was singing.
::{{A|vo lyaq202 1 paimon 05b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, no! That was definitely someone in trouble! It came from those ruins over there.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh oh, it looks like the [[Treasure Hoarders]] have locked someone inside.

;(While Meng Dan is in the cage)
:{{A|vo lyaq202 1 mengdan 01.ogg}} '''Meng Dan:''' Help! Help me!

;(Talk to Meng Dan after defeating the Treasure Hoarders)
:{{A|vo lyaq202 1 mengdan 02.ogg}} '''Meng Dan:''' Phew... Thank you for you help, kind travelers. If you hadn't come to my aid, I surely would have rotted in this cell! Those Treasure Hoarders... when their mood was good, they'd rearrange those pots of [[Sweet Flower]]s. But when they were in a bad mood, they'd rearrange my face...
:{{A|vo lyaq202 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, it was nothing. No need to thank us all at once or anything!
:{{A|vo lyaq202 1 mengdan 03.ogg}} '''Meng Dan:''' Haha, I understand. Don't worry, I will compensate you both.
:{{DIcon}} There's really no need.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 1 mengdan 04.ogg}} '''Meng Dan:''' Don't say that! I only escaped this predicament because of you.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 1 mengdan 05.ogg}} '''Meng Dan:''' I'm Meng Dan, a supplier for Mingxing Jewelry in [[Liyue Harbor]]. I often walk around these mountains in search of antiques.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 1 mengdan 06.ogg}} '''Meng Dan:''' I never expected that those Treasure Hoarders would have their eyes on the same ruins that I had. Before I knew it, they'd caught and imprisoned me.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 1 mengdan 07.ogg}} '''Meng Dan:''' Is there anything that you lack? Antiques, treasures, various knick-knacks, you name it! Well, as long as you want what I have to offer, of course.
:{{DIcon}} Your goodwill is good enough for me.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait a moment! Actually, we are looking for something!
:{{A|vo lyaq202 1 mengdan 08.ogg}} '''Meng Dan:''' Oh? And what might that be?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you have a box that can store presents? We'd like a pretty one... the kind that you can use to store snacks.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 1 mengdan 09.ogg}} '''Meng Dan:''' Of course we do &mdash; how can one sell antiques without gift boxes? At {{Color|buzzword|Mingxing Jewelry}}, we have the best gift-wrapping service in the seven nations.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 1 mengdan 10.ogg}} '''Meng Dan:''' Now, just give me a moment, and I'll let the boss know. You can go see her whenever you require that box.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! Paimon's Sugar-Frosted Slime now comes in a beautiful package!
----
;(Talk to Xingxi at Mingxing Jewelry)
:{{A|vo lyaq202 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey there! A guy called Meng Dan told us that we could get a nice and shiny box from your store...
:{{A|vo lyaq202 4 xingxi 01.ogg}} '''Xingxi:''' Uncle Meng already told me about it. Thank you both for saving him.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 4 xingxi 02.ogg}} '''Xingxi:''' Many of the best goods in our store were found by Uncle Meng. If anything were to happen to him, it would be impossible for us to continue doing business.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 4 xingxi 03.ogg}} '''Xingxi:''' Here, this container is itself an antique, with at least 140 years of history. It's already been cleaned... Will it do?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yup-yup-yup! It's great!
:{{A|vo lyaq202 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hang on a moment. Could we borrow one other thing?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 4 xingxi 04.ogg}} '''Xingxi:''' Sure, please help yourselves &mdash; as long as it's on our shelves.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Traveler), this clay pot looks really awesome!
:{{A|vo lyaq202 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If we use an antique as our mixing bowl, we should be able to make a great snack!
:{{A|vo lyaq202 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's done! The one and only Sugar-Frosted Slime! Carefully now. Into the box it goes, and dust it over with a bit more powdered sugar...
:{{A|vo lyaq202 4 xingxi 05.ogg}} '''Xingxi:''' Oh yes. You might want to use these two freshly-picked flowers as decorations too.

:[[File:Item Sugar-Frosted Slime.png|50px]]
:Sugar-Frosted Slime

;(Obtain [[Sugar-Frosted Slime]])
:{{A|vo lyaq202 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Woohoo! It looks beautiful!
:{{DIcon}} (I'm still not sold on this gift idea...)
:{{A|vo lyaq202 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! Now that we've put all that we've got into this box, let's go to the Jade Chamber to see Ningguang!

;(Talk to Xingxi again)
:{{A|vo dialog lyaq202 xingxi 01.ogg}} '''Xingxi:''' Thanks for saving Uncle Meng. Please take care.
:{{A|vo dialog lyaq202 xingxi 02.ogg}} '''Xingxi:''' Well, now... time to clean that pot...
{{Dialogue end}}

===To the Jade Chamber===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to [[Bu'yun]] at Yuehai Pavilion)
:{{A|vo lyaq202 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (According to Keqing, this is what we should say...)
:{{A|vo lyaq202 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Excuse me, do you sell the moon here?<!--pause-->
:{{A|vo lyaq202 5 buyun 01.ogg}} '''Bu'yun:''' Yes. How many would you like?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It is not convenient to speak of numbers here.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 5 buyun 02.ogg}} '''Bu'yun:''' Ah, well said. Please use this to ascend to the Chamber... Ah, yes. Speaking of which &mdash; are you two the guests that Lady Ningguang has arranged to meet with today?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yup!
:{{A|vo lyaq202 5 buyun 03.ogg}} '''Bu'yun:''' (And yet the code they used was not the one for the guests, but for the Yuheng. What's going on here...)

;(Talk to Bu'yun again)
:{{A|vo dialog lyaq202 buyun 01.ogg}} '''Bu'yun:''' Hello. Is there anything I can...
:{{A|vo dialog lyaq202 buyun 02.ogg}} '''Bu'yun:''' Huh?
----
;(Cutscene starts)
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 01.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I've been waiting for you, returnee from Jueyun Karst.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, it's Ningguang!
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Since this is our first meeting, um, we've prepared a gift! Hope you like it?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 02.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Oh, for me? You have my thanks. It seems that I have made things difficult for you, considering that you were supposed to be my guests.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe... Oh no, it's nothing.
:{{DIcon}} Nice place, this Jade Chamber.
::{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 03a.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Haha. I'm glad you like it too.
:{{DIcon}} It's my first time coming to a place this high up...
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 03b.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' This palace floats in the skies, higher than the peak of any mountain. From this vantage point, one may survey all of Liyue.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 04.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I have been gathering the funds necessary to build it from the time I began learning the merchant's craft. And since becoming the Tianquan, I have spared no effort in hiring the best craftsmen to constantly extend it...
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 05.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' At first, it was but the size of one room. Now, it is large enough to blot out the moon in the skies above Liyue.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 06.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' One day, I believe it will overshadow all seven nations.
:{{DIcon}} (This Tianquan does not lack for ambition...)
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 07.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Not many from outside of Liyue earn the right to ascent to the Jade Chamber. But I have been in correspondence with the [[Jean|Acting Grand Master]] of the [[Knights of Favonius]], who spoke highly of you.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 08.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' As such, I have been putting eyes and ears out ever since you reached Liyue...
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 09.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' And I finally got wind of your movements when you were on the way to [[Wangshu Inn]].
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Wait. Was [[Verr Goldet]] one of your people!?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 10.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Just Verr Goldet? ...No.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 11.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Everyone at Wangshu Inn is one of ours.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' @&%*!
:{{DIcon}} We also ran into the Yuheng not long ago...
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 12.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' At the Guizhong Ballista, yes?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... you weren't peeking on us from the skies the whole time... were you!?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 13.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Haha... I fear that peeking would have been a little difficult from this altitude.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 14.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Our eyes and ears are more than sufficient. You two are very interesting people, after all. It would be natural to take an interest..
:{{DIcon}} Keqing said that the Qixing would not wish ill on [[Rex Lapis]].
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 15.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Well, I wouldn't expect you to trust us, considering that you have had far more interactions with the [[adepti]]. The reason I invited you here was to clear up some misunderstandings.
----
;(Talk to Ningguang)
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 16.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I believe that you've heard of the [[Archon War]]?
:{{DIcon}} Umm... Rings a bell.
:{{DIcon}} Only in the broadest of strokes.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 17.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Many gods used to walk this earth, and many long wars were fought between them that did not abate until 2,000 years ago. Much blood was shed, and many lives were lost.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 18.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' In the end, only seven victors remained standing in [[Teyvat]]. They build cities and nations on the corpses of the vanquished, and thus began the era of [[The Seven]].
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 19.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' You can see Guyun Stone Forest from here, I trust? It is no natural rock formation &mdash; those are giant spears of rock, hurled by Rex Lapis during the war.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 20.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Beneath the spears lie those cast down by Rex Lapis in those days: gods that failed to seize the title of Archon.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 21.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Not only is it true that gods may die, but so too has the membership of the Seven changed over the last two millennia. Rex Lapis' passing is an unimaginable disaster for Liyue, but the order of The Seven will not collapse simply because of that.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 22.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Another Lord of Geo will arise sooner or later, yet how are we to forget Rex Lapis? When that time comes, the relationship between the people of Liyue and the gods and adepti will surely be different from before.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 23.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Even in the new era, the [[Liyue Qixing]] remain Rex Lapis' former subjects... Do you really think us capable of having played a part in his demise? Of lacking the foresight to see the certain repercussions?
:{{DIcon}} Why hide the Exuvia, then?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 24.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Heh...
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 25.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' That day at Yujing Terrace &mdash; it was all so very sudden. Even I was caught completely off guard. You were there, you no doubt saw.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 26.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' But our enemy has long lain hidden within the harbor. If we do not act against them now, they will surely gain the upper hand.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 27.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Hiding the Exuvia was a necessary maneuver to take the initiative back, to play the spider while our foes scurry about.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who's this "[[Tartaglia|enemy]]" you're talking about?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 28.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' What do you think, Traveler?
:{{DIcon}} Is it "him"?
:{{DIcon}} It's "him," isn't it?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh? What are you two talking about?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 29.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Well answered.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Huh!?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 6 ningguang 30.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Hah... The scenery out here is fine indeed, but the wind is a little strong. Our preparations to receive guests within are complete &mdash; so please, this way.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Inside the Jade Chamber===
{{Dialogue start}}
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wowee! What a huge hall! Paimon's never seen such a fancy place before...
;(Talk to Ningguang)
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 ningguang 01.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Be at ease, you two. Make yourselves at home if you wish.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Can we really!?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 ningguang 02.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I have invited you two here as friends. And when friends come over to play, our enjoyment comes first, naturally.
:{{DIcon}} Is that what I think it is...?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh! Isn't this that legendary wall?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 ningguang 03.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Why, you've kept your ear to the ground, I see.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's because even the storytellers are talking about it... Everyone's after a piece of paper from that wall. It's super famous!
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 ningguang 04.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' That's because that wall records Liyue's secrets. Merchants have always been attracted to secrets.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 ningguang 05.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' But the secrets of the mercantile world are of no interest to you, are they, Traveler? You're rather special, really &mdash; and I think you're quite aware of that.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 ningguang 06.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' If possible, I'd like to have your trust.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 ningguang 07.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' But if you were to choose the more trustworthy person between myself and Keqing...
:{{DIcon}} Well, between your orthodoxy and her heterodoxy...
:{{DIcon}} I'd go with Keqing and her skepticism of the divine.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 ningguang 08.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Haha... You'd pick Keqing? I had a feeling.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 ningguang 09.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I originally thought her a bit too... hard-headed. With someone of her character on the Qixing, I've had some extra messes to clean up behind the scenes.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 ningguang 10.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' But after she said those words: "The time of the adepti has long passed. If even the Liyue Qixing don't want to face that truth, then what future is there for Liyue..."
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 ningguang 11.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Well, I must say that quite a few of my doubts have been dispelled.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 ningguang 12.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I won't deny that Rex Lapis' passing seems advantageous to us. But for Liyue's sake, we cannot allow ourselves to be shackled by rumors of our usurpation of power.
:{{DIcon}} I surmise that the [[Fatui]] has a hand in these rumors?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 ningguang 13.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Indeed... It seems that you understood what I meant to say from the very beginning.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 ningguang 14.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I called for the gag order and for the Exuvia to be hidden to temporarily stabilize the situation, and also to prevent something similar to the incident in Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 ningguang 15.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' With Rex Lapis' death, the Fatui have busied themselves with many clandestine actions beyond their diplomatic remit. As the Tianquan, one responsible for Liyue, I cannot be too concerned with appearances when opposing them.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 ningguang 16.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Allowing the [[Rite of Parting]] to take place was also meant to buy some time for us to take control of Liyue's administration...
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh... It's exactly as Zhongli said. The Qixing only provided the venue for the rite so they could use us for their own ends.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, that's right! Speaking of ends... Could Paimon say one other thing?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 ningguang 17.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Of course.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's heard that anyone who sends a greeting gift gets a little something in return... So, does that include us?
:{{DIcon}} Seriously, Paimon? Seriously?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 ningguang 18.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Hmm-hmm, It's quite alright. I like direct people.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 ningguang 19.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Well, we have made quite a bit of trouble for you recently. How about this? You can pick any one object here as you please, and you may take it with you.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yay! Paimon was just waiting for you to say that! Let's see, what should we get...
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' One of those {{Color|buzzword|sheets}} on that wall!
:{{DIcon}} ???
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't look at Paimon like that! One of these sheets of paper will sell for crazy prices, even if it's only as large as Paimon's fingernail!
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just imagine... how much Mora a whole, untorn sheet would sell for!
----
:{{A|vo lyaq202 7 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's grab one! The biggest one!
;(Grabbing a "paper snow")
:{{A|vo lyaq202 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Well that was an easy search. The biggest sheet is right up there in the most obvious spot. Let's go with that one!
:{{A|vo lyaq202 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' La la-la la-la... Let's see what's written on it.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? There's a place marked with a circle on here. Ooh, could it be treasure!? Whatever it is, it better make us filthy rich! Let's see what's written over here...
:{{A|vo lyaq202 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Sigil"..."of Permission"... Mm-hmm and... "Fatui"... "research"..."copy"... Huh?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, that doesn't sound like treasure at all.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This piece of paper shows that a Qixing spy discovered traces of classified Fatui research on the {{Color|buzzword|[[Sigil of Permission]]}}.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Ningguang did say that the Fatui have been up to all kinds of mischief in the shadows of Liyue... Spreading rumors, wanting to get their hands on the archon's body, and what not.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 8 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But research on the Sigil of Permission? Paimon wonders what they're up to.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 8 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Speaking of which, there's also some connection between you and the Sigil of Permission, (Traveler). Seems there's still more for us to find out.
:{{DIcon}} It's all unfolding a little too perfectly.
:{{DIcon}} Ningguang is clearly trying to steer us there.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 8 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? You really think so?
:{{A|vo lyaq202 8 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well... should we not go, then?
:{{DIcon}} No, what I mean is...
:{{A|vo lyaq202 8 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so you're saying that it's precisely because we can't completely trust Ningguang that we should confirm the truth of what she says for ourselves.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 8 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... That's way out of Paimon's league. Paimon thinks she's been nothing but good to us.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 8 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, we'll see if you're on to something.
:{{A|vo lyaq202 8 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, before we look for [[Zhongli]] at [[Dihua Marsh]], let's go to the place marked out on these papers and see if the Fatui really are up to no good there.

;(If you talk to Ningguang)
:{{A|vo dialog lyaq202 ningguang 01.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' So, have you made your choice?
:{{A|vo dialog lyaq202 ningguang 02.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' You don't have to confirm it with me. Just choose one and take it.
:{{A|vo dialog lyaq202 ningguang 03.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Afterwards, why not sit down for a while in the Jade Chamber, or have a short stroll? Rest is also an integral part of any journey.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you for your hospitality.
::{{A|vo dialog lyaq202 ningguang 04.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Come now, there's no need to stand on ceremony. Loosen up a little.
:{{DIcon}} It's time we made a move. See you...
::{{A|vo dialog lyaq202 ningguang 05.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Alright then, I hope the next time we meet, you will either have already done the right thing... or, will be about to make the right call.
