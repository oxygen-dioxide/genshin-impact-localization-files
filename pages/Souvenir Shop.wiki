===Toy Shop - Liyue Harbor===
{{Quote|The toy shop run by Granny Shan. No matter the time or situation, people always want to enjoy themselves. Perhaps it is this sentiment that has led her to continue manning this nameless little store year after year. Apart from spinning tops, wooden swords, kites, and other knick-knacks, you can also sometimes find some rarer toys here...|World Map description}}

===Netsuke no Gen Crafts - Inazuma City===
{{Quote|Part of a new wave of artisan stores in Inazuma. Other than netsuke, this shop also makes some other artworks of obtaining all manner of trading curios for [[Electro Sigil]]s from adventurers. While the boss has a good relationship with the neighbors, they don't seem to be an ordinary civilian. Perhaps there is some unknown secret to be had there...|World Map description}}
