==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Hirohiko:''' Hey there, is there anything I can help you with?
:{{DIcon}} Are you worried about something?
::'''Hirohiko:''' I'm a guard sent from the Yashiro Commission here to look after the event venue. Naturally, I'm worried about the safety of this place.
::'''Hirohiko:''' Festivals and Fireworks Shows here are always popular and packed with people, but that means that problems and incidents can also arise quite easily.
::'''Hirohiko:''' The Yashiro Commission needs to keep an eye on all sorts of things, from venue maintenance to fire hazard prevention with regard to flammable items.
::'''Hirohiko:''' Erm... It's not that I don't like these types of events. I enjoy beautiful fireworks as well! It's just that it's very hard to manage events where there are so many people.
::'''Hirohiko:''' It would honestly be a huge headache for the Yashiro Commission if our manager's wish came true and everyone in Teyvat came to Inazuma to watch the fireworks...
::'''Hirohiko:''' All in all, though fun is important in any event, safety should still be our top priority.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Hirohiko:''' Take care now.
