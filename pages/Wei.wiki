==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Wei:''' Mr. Qiang! I wish to purchase a weapon for self-defense, as I shall be embarking on a journey within the foreseeable future! What would you advise for someone of my stature?
:'''Mr. Qiang:''' Let's see... A feeble gait, spindly legs, zero core strength, no fighting instinct, lily-livered; hopeless at offense and useless in defense...
:'''Mr. Qiang:''' I would strongly advise you against buying a weapon from here, because of the disgrace you would surely bring to my store's reputation if you ever did have the misfortune of being set upon by bandits.
:'''Wei:''' ...
:'''Mr. Qiang:''' Ugh. Okay, well look. A good-quality sword would be wasted on you, so I would strongly advise you to invest in a crossbow instead.
:'''Wei:''' What I'm hearing you say is... I have a natural gift for archery. Is that...?
:'''Mr. Qiang:''' Look lad, you're vastly overestimating your ability level here. My six-year-old grandson took this crossbow with him when we went hunting in the hills the other day, and he took down a half-decent-sized boar with it.
:'''Mr. Qiang:''' Now. I admit you might not have his burly physique or martial prowess, and we have to factor in that you're a clumsy one, too. But if you were attacking from behind, with the element of surprise, I think that even you would have a one-in-ten chance of hitting your target armed with this thing.
:'''Wei:''' ...That was incredibly painful to hear.
:'''Mr. Qiang:''' Don't like what I have to say? I'm afraid if you want to be a fighter, you have to pull yourself up by your bootstraps, boy! Don't expect your confidence to come from other people fawning over you...
:'''Wei:''' But... I don't want to be a fighter or anything, it's just for self-defense...

===Nighttime===
''Note: This dialogue can be accessed when interacting with Wei right before he despawns at 19:00.''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Wei:''' Hello, are you a fellow fan of the opera?
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the opera.
::'''Wei:''' You're not from around here are you? Lots of the people at the [[Heyu Tea House]] have come specially to watch the opera there. Especially when the renowned house actress [[Yun Jin]] is performing!
::'''Wei:''' She has an immaculate physique and spellbinding presence... Her voice is so powerful and every movement she makes just seems effortless...
::'''Wei:''' It's a shame I'm going on a trip soon as it'll be a long time before I get to see her perform again. *sigh*
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Wei:''' Hey! You can't leave halfway through, it's poor etiquette...
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
*Wei has an unused voice-over about [[Yun Jin]]: {{A|VO Wei 02.ogg}} "Yun Jin's performing again!"
