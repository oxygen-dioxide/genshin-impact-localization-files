|description  = A large fish said to be the descendant of dragons.<br>This is a variant species of Koi, and is sometimes termed the "awakened dragon" amongst them. In stark contrast to its rather shabby appearance, the Rusty Koi has shed its opulent gold tabard in exchange for a hard armor of rusty bronze. Very strong-willed, it will fight any interloper that dares to steal its food or enter its territory. In terms of pure fighting capability, it is even a match for smaller sea monsters and has thus been given the nickname "Ironbone Dragon" in honor of its strength, which is considered the backbone of its species' future revitalization.

==Trivia==
* The Rusty Koi does not resemble the real-life {{w|koi}}, but resembles an Eastern dragon instead.
** The Chinese, Japanese, and Korean names of the Rusty Koi all relate the fish to a dragon instead.
** Carp, which the Japanese call Koi, are said to transform into dragons after leaping the {{w|Longmen (mythology)|Longmen}}, a waterfall of the Yellow River in China. One Chinese name for Carp is therefore "false dragon", as this fish is named.
