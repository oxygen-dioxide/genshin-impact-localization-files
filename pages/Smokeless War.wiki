;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo vrslq005 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're back! And we found a bunch of stuff to use!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 1 acatl 01.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Great! We're almost done with the preparations on our side, too.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 1 atolli 01.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' I've managed to get these [[Iron Chunk|iron chunks]] red-hot. We should be good to go.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 1 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Yeah, and since we need really high temperatures, I brought the best stove I could find!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 1 xoctli 01.ogg}} '''Xoctli:''' And I've got a bunch of buckets of lava on standby if we need more fuel, hahaha.
:{{DIcon}} It's like we're gearing up for a fight, not cooking a few mushrooms...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, but the things we brought aren't your typical cooking utensils either...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 1 acatl 02.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Well, that mushroom started it, right everyone? Disrespecting Varesa and our guest of honor...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 1 camotli 01.ogg}} '''Camotli:''' Yeah! We'll see what sort of excuses it can come up with this time!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 1 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Thanks for the help, everyone. It really means a lot.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 1 atolli 02.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' Alright, let's see what we have here... Huh? The armor of a [[Furnace Shell Mountain Weasel]]? Don't tell me, you went into the [[Great Volcano of Tollan|volcano]]!?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No no, it erupted out of nowhere, and the weasel appeared, and then... Well, anyway, we got this in the end.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 1 atolli 03.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' Either way, this is something special. Back when I was training to be a chef, I studied the effects of temperature on different ingredients.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 1 atolli 04.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' This kind of armor produces intense localized heat. It's great for fish because you can get a nice sear on one side without overcooking the other.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 1 atolli 05.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' Anyway, let's get started! The mushrooms are all ready to go.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 1 xoctli 02.ogg}} '''Xoctli:''' Alright, let's go!
:;([[Atolli]] prepares the mushrooms)
:{{A|vo vrslq005 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, the fragrance is so much more intense... And, what's with this weird mist?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, no... Something's not right...
:;(The Traveler, Paimon, and Varesa are teleported to a mushroom-filled cave)

<!--special screen transition-->
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Where are we? Where did everyone go!?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' I have no idea. We just showed up here... I can't see the others anymore...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 acatl 01.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Huh? Is something wrong?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Th&mdash;That's [[Acatl]]... Chief! We don't know where we are!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 acatl 02.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' What? I know it's hard to see through this mist, but aren't you here at the tribe with the rest of us?
:{{DIcon}} So, you didn't feel anything strange?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 acatl 03.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' No... What are you feeling?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (This must be the Sage-Lord's trick, but it's only affecting the three of us.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (But... Why us and not the others?)
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 bifrons 01.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Because you are the only worthy devotees, of course.
:;(A giant Fungus jumps down from above)
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Evil jerk of a mushroom! So, this is what you look like!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Huh... He does look a bit more evil than the other mushrooms we met.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 bifrons 02.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' I am no longer concerned with your insolence. On the contrary, I am satisfied with your performance. So, as promised, you shall have the answers you seek.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 bifrons 03.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Of course, I have a goal of my own. Let me reiterate once more: the great Sage-Lord of Fungi &mdash; that would be me &mdash; is extending you the honor of becoming my subjects.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmph, the only way anyone's serving you is on a platter!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 bifrons 04.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Now, now, don't be hasty. It's inadvisable to speak in absolutes. You refuse only because you have yet to witness my miracles.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 bifrons 05.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Cherish this opportunity. It may not come again.
:;(The Sage-Lord creates visions as he tells his story)
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 bifrons 06.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' As you know, [[Teyvat]] is not a peaceful place. The gods wage war against one another, monsters roam the land, humans live in squalor...
:;(A little boy, [[Soletl]], faces a [[Whirling Electro Fungus]] and a [[Whirling Pyro Fungus]])
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 bifrons 07.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' But, then, humanity discovered me and learned that I could grant them unlimited power to fell even the most fearsome of enemies.
:;(Soletl comes across a green mushroom)
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 soletl 01.ogg}} '''Soletl:'''  If we wanna become strong, we just have to eat this!
:;(Soletl eats the green mushroom and transforms into an adult man, Teoxoletl)
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 teoxoletl 01.ogg}} '''Teoxoletl:''' Woohoo!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 teoxoletl 02.ogg}} '''Teoxoletl:''' Those monsters are no match for me!
:;(Teoxoletl defeats the Fungi in a single hit)
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 bifrons 08.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' And, so, the humans worshiped me as their savior, and in return, I revealed my identity as the Sage-Lord of Fungi.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You really expect us to believe that? Besides... As far as enemies go, a few puny Fungi aren't all that "fearsome"...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 bifrons 09.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Such arrogance! Take that back and apologize before I lose my temper!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Heh, you wish!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' I mean, those monsters really don't look that scary &mdash; not the kind you need a "miracle" to defeat, anyway...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 2 bifrons 10.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' You insignificant mortals boast of strength? Very well, then prove it!

;(Defeat the fungi)
:{{A|vo vrslq005 3 bifrons 01.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' W&mdash;Well fought. You see? You ate a fair amount of my clones, and now look at what you can do! Hmph, my eye for subjects is as discerning as ever.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, weren't we "insignificant mortals" just a second ago? Weird...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 3 bifrons 02.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' I'll admit, you're not entirely useless, but my miracles are even greater than you can imagine.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, don't just&mdash; Ugh, another cryptic one-liner and another disappearing act. It's gotta be a mushroom thing at this point...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, what should we do? Follow him?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 3 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Yeah, let's go. I think he's trying to tell us a story, although I'm not sure if I like the plot...

;(Approach the marked location)
:;(The Sage-Lord again creates visions as he tells his story)
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 bifrons 01.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' I soon became humanity's faith and, with my power, created countless clones with which I could bestow upon them an endless source of sustenance.
;(A group of people are shown kneeling in front of a statue resembling the Sage-Lord)
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 bifrons 02.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Food is a scarce resource. A faith that provides for the needs of the flesh is the most practical and noble of all!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 bifrons 03.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' And as my subjects gave themselves in service, either as civilians or warriors, I rewarded them with mushrooms in proportion to their contribution. The most exceptional among them could receive as many as twenty mushrooms a day!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's it?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 bifrons 04.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' What are you insinuating? Are mushrooms not enough?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Well, it's possible people couldn't afford to be picky back then...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, but now, even [[saurian]]s have more options than that...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 bifrons 05.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Sustenance and strength... Such are the pillars of faith. So, what do you think? A pretty enticing offer, wouldn't you agree?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 bifrons 06.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Once you become my subjects, all you have to do is build a civilization dedicated to the mushrooms, and then&mdash;
:{{DIcon}} Hold on...
:{{DIcon}} I want to know what happened next.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 bifrons 07.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' What do you mean, "what happened next"?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Right! If the humans dedicated themselves in service to you, then shouldn't you have your own tribe at this point? Or even your own nation?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' But, I've read a lot of woven scrolls about the heroes of [[Natlan]], and I've never come across anything about some kind of mushroom savior.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 bifrons 08.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Of course not! I was in a different nation at the time. I don't suppose you know their history, too...
:{{DIcon}} We've been to [[Sumeru]].
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! And we didn't hear anything about a mushroom civilization.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 bifrons 09.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' I never said it was Sumeru! I have no idea where that assumption is coming from...
:{{DIcon}} Because Fungi are creatures from Sumeru.
:{{DIcon}} The buildings from your visions support that, too.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 bifrons 10.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' A... A trivial detail! You know what? You don't deserve to know what happened next!
:{{DIcon}} Then you don't deserve our faith, either.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! If you want us to respect you, stop being so secretive!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 varesa 04.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' True, if we don't know how the story ends, it doesn't hold much weight, now does it...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 bifrons 11.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' *frustrated grumble*
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 bifrons 12.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Alright, fine. Same rules as before &mdash; if you want to know the truth, you'll have to use your wits to earn it!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 bifrons 13.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' If you fail to prove your worth, good luck getting another detail out of me!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, he ran off! C'mon, after him!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 varesa 05.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, uh-huh... Right!
:;(They chase after the Sage-Lord, who jumps into a well)
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He jumped down from here! So, it looks like we just need to&mdash;
:{{DIcon}} Hold on.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Something wrong, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} There's something off about his motive.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Off... how?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 varesa 06.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' That's how I feel, too... Based on his personality, if he won't tell us how things turned out in the end, it must be because it's not something he can brag about.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 varesa 07.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Besides, how did he even get from Sumeru to Natlan? Seems like he's avoiding that subject, too...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 varesa 08.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' And, through it all, he still hasn't given up on recruiting us... Even though he's in for a rude awakening.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah... He seemed pretty annoyed with our questions. Why not just kick us to the curb?
:{{DIcon}} He must be in dire need of subjects.
:{{DIcon}} And it has to be the three of us.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 varesa 09.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' But... why?
:{{DIcon}} Let's go after him.
:{{DIcon}} And keep an eye out for clues along the way.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, sounds like a plan! Let's go!

:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 bifrons 07.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Phew, my power is all but spent, but it was still enough to control [[Chatraka|a single human]], at least...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 bifrons 08.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Now, all of Sumeru knows how scrumptious my mushrooms are, so if I want to grow... I must relocate.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 bifrons 09.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' And, if I want it to happen fast, I need suitable environmental conditions.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 bifrons 10.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' You! Take me somewhere hot! The hotter, the better!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 chatraka 01.ogg}} '''Chatraka:''' Yes, my lord!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 bifrons 11.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Is this the place, human?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 chatraka 02.ogg}} '''Chatraka:''' Yes, this is a volcano in a land far to the west. The temperatures here get very high. It should be a most suitable location for your lordship to regain his strength.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 chatraka 03.ogg}} '''Chatraka:''' I shall now find a good place to plant you, my lord, so that your mycelial majesty may take root in this fertile land.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 bifrons 12.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Yes, proceed.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 bifrons 13.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Huh? An earthquake?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 bifrons 14.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' No, a volcanic eruption!? Aaaargh!
:;(The memory ends)
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, that's how it ended. No wonder he tried to hide it from us, that's... pretty embarrassing.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' I thought he said people formed communities around this mushroom and used it as their main source of food...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, but it looks like his following got too big, and he couldn't keep up with the demand.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 varesa 04.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Huh, he used the mushrooms as his main recruitment tactic, but then the situation got out of control...
:{{DIcon}} And, it seems like his power is proportional to the number of clones he has.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Which means, the more mushrooms the humans ate, the less powerful he became, right?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 varesa 05.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Wow, so his following didn't last long.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nope, which explains why there aren't any records about some kind of mushroom civilization.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' In the end, he mind-controlled a human to bring him to Natlan and then got buried under a pile of volcanic rocks...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 varesa 06.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Yeah... For who knows how long...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 varesa 07.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' When we were talking to him earlier, he seemed kind of... out of touch, y'know?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, he has been living under a rock, so... that checks out.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, clearing out this area for [[Varesa's Orchard|your orchard]] finally allowed him to start regaining his power.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 varesa 08.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Yeah, that sounds right. My parents always thought it was so weird that mushrooms kept popping up around the orchard no matter what we did... Now it makes sense.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 varesa 09.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Wait, but... If everything we saw is true, that means this mushroom has mind control powers or something? That's a recipe for disaster.
:{{DIcon}} Hmm...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hold on, do you remember what he showed us? A group of humans worshipping a giant mushroom... It just doesn't make sense! They must have been mind-controlled!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, when he started running out of power, he couldn't keep it up!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 varesa 10.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, yeah! Maybe that's why he doesn't seem to be able to control us, either.
:{{DIcon}} I understand now...
:{{DIcon}} Why it has to be us.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? Why?
:{{DIcon}} I'll explain on the way.
:{{DIcon}} I need to catch him to confirm my theory.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 6 varesa 11.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Alright, then let's find this mushroom!

:{{A|vo vrslq005 7 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Let's keep looking. He can't hide forever...

;(Defeat the Fungi)
:{{A|vo vrslq005 7 bifrons 01.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Hm, so you made it this far... Impressive. In that case...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' H&mdash;He hid himself in the statue! What should we do?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 7 paimon 03.ogg}}'''Paimon:''' Actually... Eh, that checks out. We're just gonna smash it, right? Cool...

:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've got you this time, nasty mushroom! We know all your schemes!
:{{DIcon}} Maybe try hiding them a bit better next time.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' We thought you were just a mushroom that happened to taste good. But, now we know how dangerous you are, so we have to stop you!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 01.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Hm, it would seem you're not completely devoid of intelligence &mdash; fitting for my future subjects. Still, you're overlooking a very important detail.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 02.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Did you think I was running away because I was scared? This is a world of my creation. My will rules supreme!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 03.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' My "schemes" have been exposed you say? No matter. My goal has already been achieved.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' What!?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 04.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Hmph, although I prefer to call myself the Sage-Lord of Fungi, in the human tongue, I am known by another name.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 05.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' You now behold the god, Bifrons! The sole protagonist in this endless carnage!
:{{DIcon}} So, you're a [[god]].
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 06.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' Indeed! Foolish, shallow, and ungrateful humans, have you forgotten your savior during this time of war? I am the god who's protecting countless of your kind during this [[Archon War]]!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 07.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' You have no food with which to satiate your hunger, no means with which to counter the hoards of monsters. And the gods loom overhead, capable of reducing you to ashes with a simple snap of their fingers.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 08.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' Just one word, and you could have had my protection. But, now, that opportunity is lost forever, and you only have your own stupidity and arrogance to blame!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 09.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' No matter. My plan has already succeeded.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 10.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' What you saw when you cooked the mushrooms was not mist, but spores... set to sprout into green mushrooms very soon.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 11.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' And that's where their true power lies... Because, given a bit of time to grow, green mushrooms will multiply exponentially.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 12.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' You see, considering my current level of power, I had no way to create a large number of clones... Unless, of course, I had access to a source of extreme heat.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 13.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' And you delivered one to me on a silver platter! That was my plan all along.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, you kept running away from us because... you needed to buy time?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 14.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' Precisely. Before long, the green mushrooms will multiply at an unstoppable rate, allowing me to return to the peak of my power.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 15.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' Then, I shall reclaim my dignity and status as a god, achieve victory in the Archon War, and take revenge on Sumeru!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You have no concept of time, do you... News flash, the Archon War is old news, buddy.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 16.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' Nonsense! Is that not the source of your suffering?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 17.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' All I hear in this land is "war" this and "war" that. If you fear the Archon War, all the more reason to cower behind the protection of a god!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Pretty sure they're talking about the war against the [[Abyss]]...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 18.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' The Archon War... I guess I've heard about that once or twice, but only from outlanders.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 19.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' Hah! I see what's going on here. You're using lies and trickery to befuddle me!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 20.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' You know, my original plan was to imprison you here until the end of time, but now, I have a better idea...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 21.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' Once nothing is left of this land but an endless field of mushrooms, I'll set you free &mdash; you get the honor of witnessing that despair in person.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 22.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' Now, I was going to offer you a glimmer of hope by allowing you to pledge yourselves to me and take on the burden of managing my kingdom...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 23.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' But now, the deal is off!
:{{DIcon}} It was an empty deal from the start.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 24.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' What did you say?
:{{DIcon}} We weren't chosen because you saw something in us.
:{{DIcon}} We were your only option.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 varesa 04a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo vrslq005 8 varesa 04b.ogg}}--> '''Varesa:''' The Traveler explained everything. The only reason I could hear you is because I've eaten so many mushrooms over the years.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, and Paimon ate a whole bunch during the competition! Paimon's small, so it didn't take as many mushrooms for her to be affected!
:{{DIcon}} And I happen to have a special constitution.
:{{DIcon}} Which made it easy to hear your voice.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Point being, most people would have to eat a monstrous amount of mushrooms to even hear you over the buzz of a mosquito!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, you latched onto us, a group of people who could actually hear your voice. In other words...
:{{DIcon}} You're too weak.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 varesa 05.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' You said your mushrooms need time to grow. Which means... You don't have enough power to keep us here.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 25.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' I may not have my former strength, but keeping a few humans right where I want them is a small task. Unless you think you can take on a creature as vicious and powerful as the [[Jadeplume Terrorshroom]]!?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 26.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' Because you definitely can't... right?
:{{DIcon}} Forget about him.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's get out of here.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 varesa 06.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Yeah, if he was telling the truth, we need to get back to the tribe as soon as possible.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 bifrons 27.ogg}} '''Bifrons:''' No, no, no, you must be bluffing. A few measly humans couldn't possibly be that powerful... And what's this about a war against the Abyss? Hey! I want answers!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 8 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* Paimon's not gonna waste one more word on this guy. Let's go.

::'''Acatl:''' Atolli!

::'''Varesa:''' More please!

::'''Bifrons:''' Stop this at once!
:;(A [[Tatankasaur Whelp]] appears behind Bifrons and takes a bite out of his stem)
:;(Cinematic ends)
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Ahhhhhh~ What a great meal! Thanks, everyone! I feel like a whole new me!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 acatl 01.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' And, with that, we took care of all the green mushrooms!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 acatl 02.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Now, care to tell me what happened earlier? It was lights out for all three of you...
:{{Black Screen|You tell the chief everything that happened.}}
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 acatl 03.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Someone... planted a god in Varesa's orchard, and she's been eating it ever since?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah. We know not every god that's still around is super strong, but this one reached a whole new low.
:{{DIcon}} I can't imagine the bar getting any lower than that.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Also, didn't he have his facts all wrong? He kept going on about some kind of... "Archon War"?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 acatl 04.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Ah, well... Natlan was never part of the Archon War, so it rarely comes up around these parts. It makes sense that you don't know much about it, Varesa.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on! Are you serious?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 acatl 05.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Of course! The in-fighting between the [[dragon]]s pretty much took over everything, so there was no room for the [[god]]s to join in.
:{{DIcon}} Makes sense.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, that checks out. Living under a rock all those years, mushroom-god wakes up, thinking it's still the Archon War and tries to use that to convince people to worship him...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Hehe, little did he know, our lives are much better now than in the ages of the dragons!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, what do we do now? It can't be easy to slay a god...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 varesa 04.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' I guess it's back to business as usual. As long as we keep picking the green mushrooms, that god is just a tasty mushroom at the end of the day.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 varesa 05.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Actually, um, {{Traveler}}... Can I borrow you for a minute?
:{{DIcon}} Sure thing.
:;(Varesa brings the Traveler aside)
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 varesa 06.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Alright, here's good. So, um, it's not anything super important. I just wanted to thank you... from the bottom of my heart.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 varesa 07.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Your encouragement gave me the courage to investigate the green mushrooms and helped me resolve a threat to my tribe.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 varesa 08.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' And, maybe this sounds weird, considering everything... But, it was a really awesome adventure! I had fun!
:{{DIcon}} Me too.
::{{DIcon}} It's an adventure I'll remember for a long time.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 varesa 09.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh? Why's that?
:{{DIcon}} You got the chance to shine as a hero.
:{{DIcon}} And it was all you, through and through.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 varesa 10.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' You're right!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 varesa 11.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' I never thought my appetite would save the day... It's pretty surreal.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 varesa 12.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' But, it's like you said &mdash; all it takes is a little patience and perseverance, and my time will come!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 varesa 13.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' If I start to doubt myself in the future, all I need to do is think of this experience and everything I've learned along the way.
:{{DIcon}} Yep! You got this!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, you two!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Acatl was saying that, since a scholar from Sumeru warned the tribe about the mushrooms, someone there must know about the mushroom god.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Should we go check it out? Couldn't hurt to get more information...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 varesa 14.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, good point! But, if we're heading to the [[Akademiya]], I need to get permission from Uncle Acatl first.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right, and it's not a quick trip. We have to cross the whole desert.
:{{DIcon}} Why don't we just ask the [[Adventurers' Guild]]?
:{{DIcon}} Who knows, maybe there's a Sumeru scholar in Natlan right now.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 9 varesa 15.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Good idea! Let's check it out!

;(Talk to [[Katheryne]] at the Stadium)
:{{Black Screen|After hearing your story, Katheryne heads to the Speaker's Chamber to check if there are any scholars in the area...}}
:{{A|vo vrslq005 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Katheryne's back! And... isn't that [[Tighnari]]!?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 10 katheryne 01.ogg}} '''Katheryne:''' Word from the [[Speaker's Chamber]] was that an [[Amurta]] scholar happened to be conducting research in the area. So, they helped me get in touch.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 10 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' It's been a while, you two. So, you're the ones looking into the Sage-Lord of Fungi...
:{{A|vo vrslq005 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep! You're an expert, so you must know all about him, right?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 10 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Of course. To those in the Amurta darshan, his case is a well-known part of ecological history.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 10 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' His power is tied to his number of clones, so at one point, he possessed a truly fearsome form. But, as his clones diminished in number, he got smaller and smaller, until he couldn't hold {{sic|onto|expected=onto a}} physical form at all.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 10 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' And so, he became impossible to track. Scholars could only keep tabs on him by monitoring what remains of his clones. Now, I'm learning his true form fled to Natlan...?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 10 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Yeah, the mushrooms started popping up in our orchard not too long ago.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 10 tighnari 05.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Well, from what I've heard, he has very few clones right now, so there's nothing to worry about. Feel free to use the mushrooms as you see fit &mdash; they really are delicious.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 10 tighnari 06.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Of course, in the interest of research, I would prefer to send a few scholars from my darshan to monitor the situation every so often. What do you say?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 10 tighnari 07.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I wanted to get your permission before submitting a formal request to the Speaker's Chamber.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 10 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Of course! You're welcome any time, hehe. That's a huge help, actually.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 10 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' I wanted to ask, though... You said "what remains of his clones"... Does that mean there are clones outside of Natlan? Even now?
:{{A|vo vrslq005 10 tighnari 08.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Oh, yes. There's a huge one beneath [[The Chasm]].
;(If ''[[Dimming Mushroom's Call for Help]]'' has been completed){{verify|Or started?}}
::{{A|vo vrslq005 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[Xamaran]]!?
::{{A|vo vrslq005 10 varesa 04.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Y&mdash;You know that name?
::{{A|vo vrslq005 10 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, Paimon calls it "Sheeshroom"... It's absolutely huge! Way more impressive than the puny Sage-Lord.
;(If ''Dimming Mushroom's Call for Help'' has not been completed)
::{{A|vo vrslq005 10 tighnari 09.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Xamaran is its name. Its mycelium structure is stunning, and it's capable of human speech.
::{{A|vo vrslq005 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, that sounds amazing!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 10 tighnari 10.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' It took a long time for Xamaran to grow into this form. Luckily, Xamaran isn't a green-cap mushroom so there's no danger to us.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 10 tighnari 11.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' And, I believe its mind has been separated from the mushroom god for a very long time. I doubt there's a connection between them anymore.
:{{A|vo vrslq005 10 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We should go see Xamaran one of these days!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 10 varesa 05.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Ooh, I'll come! It'll be nice to interact with a friendly mushroom for once!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 10 tighnari 12.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Hehe, "friendly" is right, so this one is definitely not for eating!
:{{A|vo vrslq005 10 varesa 06.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' I would never!
