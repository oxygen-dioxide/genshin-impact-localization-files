'''''Charge Forward! Go, Go, Go!''''' is a [[World Quest]] in {{Location|Tezcatepetonco Range}}. 

It is one of the three prerequisite quests for the {{Quest|Every Aspect of a Warrior}}. After completing all three, the floating balloon house turns into a regular balloon platform.

==Start Location==
Start the quest by landing on the floating balloon house, southwest of the southernmost [[Teleport Waypoint]] in Tezcatepetonco Range. Blowing the horns on the ground in the correct order (left, right, left, right) will summon [[Wind Current]]s that can be utilized to reach the house.

{{Quest Description|"[[Xueyoni|Dad]], heroes are so tall and strong. I wish I could be one some day."<br>"It's true that many heroes are tall and strong by nature, but there are others who &mdash; though they may be lacking in height and strength &mdash; are just as capable as any of the taller ones I've trained."}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Upon approaching the stable, camera pans up to the floating balloon house)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, did you see that?
:'''Paimon:''' There's a flying house right above us... Oh? And a person there, too. Let's find a way to go up and have a look!

;(Read the "Eye-Catching Slogan" sign, optional)
:'''Eye-Catching Slogan:''' The Soaring Saurian is open all day! If you wish to join Matahga's special training, then come lift off from the Soaring Saurian! Note:{{sic}}
:'''Eye-Catching Slogan:''' Up with serious, rigorous training! Down with sloth and slacking!
:'''Eye-Catching Slogan:''' Laze about today, and be as trash tomorrow!
:'''Eye-Catching Slogan:''' Only those who push forward boldly shall truly know greatness as Saurian riders!

;(Read the sign by the two horns, optional)
:'''Matahga! Remember!!!:''' The code is: Blow the left horn first, then the right one, then the left again, and finally the right... but blow 'em at your own peril!
:'''Matahga! Remember!!!:''' Feeding a Saurian some Fowl is the best way to keep one in a good mood and avoid getting pecked!
:'''Matahga! Remember!!!:''' (Seems like a reminder that someone called Matahga left for themselves. You can feel the intensity of the emotion in their words.)
:'''Matahga! Remember!!!:''' (But surely putting exclamation marks at the end of every reminder is the same as putting none... Isn't it?)

;(Blow a blast on the leftside horn)
:'''Horn:''' *long blast*&mdash;&mdash;

;(Blow a blast on the rightside horn)
:'''Horn:''' *short blast*&mdash;

;(Approach the floating balloon house)
:'''???:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Hello?
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
:'''???:''' Hahahahaha!
:'''Paimon:''' Eek, you almost scared Paimon to death!
:'''???:''' I take it you're here for the special training too!?
:'''???:''' I knew it, I just knew it! Be they human or [[Saurian]], ambitious warriors are always drawn to one another!
:'''???:''' Well then, without any further ado, let's dive straight into the special training!
:{{DIcon}} So they have that here too, huh...
:{{DIcon}} What do you mean by "special training"?
:'''Paimon:''' We haven't even said a word! What makes you think we're here for your special training?
:'''Paimon:''' But the way you say it... You're not some kind of Master Trainer, are you?
:'''???:''' Not just anyone can become a Master Trainer, you know. I'm not that gifted...
:'''Matahga:''' But wait, you mean... You didn't fly all the way up here to get special warrior training from me, Matahga!?
:{{DIcon}} We're just passing through.
:{{DIcon}} Never underestimate an adventurer's curiosity.
:'''Matahga:''' Flying atop a Saurian mount shows that you've got the basics down, but such a lack of ambition... What a waste!
:'''Matahga:''' I thought you were a like-minded warrior... Such a pity!
:'''Matahga:''' Looks like I misjudged you... Honestly, how could I!
:'''Paimon:''' Should Paimon be saying that Natlan truly is a nation of heroes, or that its people are just overly hot-blooded? Even the kids are so fired up!
:{{DIcon}} Kids? Surely not...
:{{DIcon}} That's a bit extreme, kid.
:'''Matahga:''' It's the exact opposite! Laziness is no excuse once you've decided to become a warrior! Those who lack courage, determination, and ambition will never succeed!
:'''Matahga:''' And I'm twelve now! I stopped being a kid the moment I hit double digits... But I forgive you.
:'''Matahga:''' Sure, my height hasn't budged, no matter how much milk I've drunk, but my willpower? It's unbreakable, and strong enough to smash through any obstacle in my way!
:'''Matahga:''' Besides, I'm still growing, and it's not like you two are that tall either!
:'''Paimon:''' S&mdash;Such energy! But why did you drag us into this?
:'''Matahga:''' Hmph! I admit that a person's physical strength depends on their physique, but a true warrior would never let that become a limitation!
:'''Matahga:''' It's mind over matter, any day of the week... And that takes faith and belief in your own dreams and ambition!
:'''Matahga:''' Even adventurers should be able to grasp such simple truths!
:'''Paimon:''' What he said makes sense, but... It almost sounded to Paimon like he was... having a go at us?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah.
:{{DIcon}} Why are you having a go at us?
:'''Matahga:''' I was explaining the necessity of ambition for lazybones like you. You'll never be a real hero if you're always so laid back!
:'''Matahga:''' As a warrior... No, as a person... Without ambition and hard work on the training grounds, you're nothing but a failure!
:'''Matahga:''' If you can't soar through the skies like a hero, or receive the Master Trainers' recognition, then you're nothing but a failure!
:'''Matahga:''' So you must train hard! Capiche!?
:'''Paimon:''' C&mdash;Capiche! Uhh... What do we do now? He's so loud, and everything he says is so reasonable, that it's impossible for Paimon to argue back!
:'''Matahga:''' Good! If you're ready to hone your skills, come see me for some special training! Your goal is to fly your Saurian at full speed along the course and score as highly as you can.
:'''Matahga:''' During training, I will observe and score performances at every checkpoint. The final results will be divided into four tiers based on these scores.
:'''Matahga:''' Fly as fast as you can! Even if you can't make the highest tier, at the very least, you must reach the second highest!
:'''Matahga:''' Now, it's time to fire yourselves up, and try not to let my shadow leave you biting the dust! Go, go, go!
:'''Matahga:''' ...
:'''Matahga:''' Warrior, I await your reply!
:{{DIcon}} C&mdash;Capiche!
::'''Matahga:''' I can't hear you, you'll have to SPEAK UP!
::{{DIcon}} CAPICHE!!!
::'''Matahga:''' This is where aspiring warriors come to hone their skills. Now, show me your resolve, and never stop pushing your limits!
::'''Matahga:''' Come see me for some training when you're ready!
:{{DIcon}} Capiche! But I'd rather not!
::'''Matahga:''' What? You still refuse to shake off your laziness!?
::'''Matahga:''' What a sorry state of affairs! But no matter. A day will come when you will no longer be able to tolerate your failures!
::'''Matahga:''' Endless shirking and constant cowering will get you nowhere, and leave you with nothing! Only by pushing forward can you hope to stand tall and make the world resound with your booming laugh!
::'''Matahga:''' Hmph, mark my words! But even when that time comes, it won't be too late to come hone yourselves here.

;(Talk to Matahga again, optional)
:'''Matahga:''' I will become a warrior! No, a hero! Just you wait and see.

;(Try to take any of the food on the floating balloon house, optional)
;(First time)
:'''Matahga:''' This is my [[Qucusaurus]]'s food stash, so don't touch it &mdash; my companion's got quite the warrior's temper!
;(Second time)
:'''Matahga:''' Hey, hey, what gives? I told you not to touch, and you took it anyway? A warrior should be able to accommodate both other humans and Saurians alike.
;(Third time)
:'''Matahga:''' Warriors are slow to show their anger, but neither will they hesitate to vent it should it boil over, so scram, now!
;(The food is despawned and the player is teleported onto the ground below the floating house)

;(During the challenge)<!-- this dialogue appears as speech bubbles on the left side of the screen -->
:'''???:''' Hey, Matahga, what's your problem? 
:'''???:''' How many times do we have to tell you? You can practice, sure, but stop buzzing around our doorstep!
:'''???:''' Didn't your daddy ever tell you about basic venue guidelines when he was training you?
:'''???:''' I'll have to go look for your dad later, you hear...

:'''Matahga:''' There will always be doubting voices on your path to becoming a great warrior! 
:'''Matahga:''' No matter, we shall pay them no heed!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, is it a good idea to fly over someone's roof, though?

;(Talk to Matahga again if the challenge was failed, exited, or scored below an S, optional)
:'''Matahga:''' You weren't bad, so keep it up. I know you can do it...
:'''Matahga:''' Pah, you didn't really think those were the words I would leave you with, did you? No! Being "not bad" and "making do" isn't the warrior's way!
:'''Matahga:''' You should only strive to be the best! Anyone who falls to do so is a failure, pure and simple!
:'''Matahga:''' As long as you still have the courage, then keep trying! Train until you can surpass me!
----
;(After scoring an S or higher on the challenge, if this quest was not completed last)
:'''Matahga:''' Wonderful, outstanding! You've surpassed me, outdone me!
:'''Matahga:''' I've been keeping up with my special training, all by myself, in the hope that I would one day succeed at breaking my own record. Unfortunately, that's something I still haven't managed to do.
:'''Matahga:''' But you did it! You've proven to me that I should leave this place, as there must be many more warriors out there in the world whose deeds eclipse my own!
:'''Matahga:''' I'll surely be able to improve myself by sparring and exchanging pointers with them. Some day, my father and sister will acknowledge my accomplishments &mdash; just you wait!
:'''Matahga:''' [[Acomitl]] aside, of course. That layabout has zero ambition. I'm ashamed to call him my brother.
:{{DIcon}} Acomitl...?
:'''Matahga:''' Uh, never mind. That's enough chit-chat.
:'''Matahga:''' Warrior, hear me now! Never stop honing your skills!
:'''Matahga:''' If you want to become a legend, you must charge forward with all your might! Forward, hear me, forward! These words are my parting gift to you.

;(After scoring an S or higher on the challenge, if this quest was completed last)
:'''Matahga:''' Warrior! How is your training on this course?
:{{DIcon}} I'm making progress.
::'''Matahga:''' Pah, weak! If you're not taking a step forward, then it's a step back!
:{{DIcon}} I haven't had time to train lately.
::'''Matahga:''' Such indolence! Don't tell me, you've been wasting your life on meaningless wandering?
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, how should Paimon put this... It seems like "forward" and its synonyms are the only words in Matahga's dictionary.
:'''Matahga:''' Indeed, I am more focused than others! Know why? Because hard work is the only thing I acknowledge.
:'''Matahga:''' You need training, and so do I. Training to work with Saurians alone won't make me an all-round warrior!
:'''Matahga:''' I must seek a larger stage to hone myself! And that means I'll be leaving for some time.
:'''Matahga:''' Don't worry! I'll keep the course here intact, but I'll be dismantling this cabin and taking it with me.
:{{DIcon}} Where will you go?
::'''Matahga:''' Oh... To see my father and sister.
:{{DIcon}} How do you plan to train?
::'''Matahga:''' Hmm... I may ask for their opinions before deciding.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Matahga doesn't sound as confident as before.
:'''Matahga:''' What's wrong with that? Loving and respecting your family is a virtue that every warrior should uphold! Don't be so narrow-minded!
:'''Matahga:''' My father's the most professional Master Trainer in the whole of the Flower-Feather Clan, and my sister's the best Saurian rider! I'm proud of them!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, c'mon! Paimon didn't mean to question their judgment.
:{{DIcon}} I see. Good luck then.
:'''Matahga:''' Good luck to you too, Warrior! The words I shall leave you with this time are...
:'''Matahga:''' Let me think... Never give up! Become a hero, no matter the cost!

==Trivia==
* If Matahga kicks the player out for touching his Qucusaur's food, the food will be gone when the player returns. However, it reappears after beating Matahga's flying challenge score.
