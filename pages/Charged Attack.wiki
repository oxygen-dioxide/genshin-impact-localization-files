'''Charged Attacks''' are performed by holding the [[Normal Attack]] button. These attacks are usually stronger, but take slightly longer to perform and typically consume [[Stamina]]. [[Bow]] characters are an exception; Stamina is not consumed in Aimed Shot mode and charging up an attack is only needed to make it deal [[Elemental]] Damage.

A single Charged Attack typically consumes 20 Stamina for [[:Category:Sword Characters|Sword users]], 25 Stamina for [[:Category:Polearm Characters|Polearm users]], 50 Stamina for [[:Category:Catalyst Characters|Catalyst users]], and 40 Stamina per second for [[:Category:Claymore Characters|Claymore users]], with exceptions.

Sword users and Polearm users must always perform at least one Normal Attack before performing their Charged Attack.

==Charged Attack Modification==
===Talents===
These Talents grant modifications or additional effects to Charged Attacks (besides [[Elemental Infusion]]s, which also infuse Charged Attacks). For example, Ganyu has a second charged level for her Liutian Archery, and Hu Tao applies the special Blood Blossom [[status]] with her Charged Attacks when in her Paramita Papilio state (and this is an additional effect besides her infusion). Other abilities can heal (Barbara), do additional damage (Yanfei), or have reduced stamina cost (Diluc).
