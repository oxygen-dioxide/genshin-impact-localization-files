'''Noelle''' is a playable {{Geo}} [[character]] in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''.

Extremely strong and reliable, Noelle is considered to be "the maid of all maids" in the [[Knights of Favonius]], with many thinking she has the ability to be everywhere all at once. She is stubborn, however, and willing to unnecessarily endanger her life at any moment to help someone. She has tried many times to join the ranks of the Knights of Favonius to accomplish her dream of becoming a full-fledged knight, but has fallen short every time so far.
