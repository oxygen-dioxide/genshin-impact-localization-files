|text    = Recently, I have been very interested in fishing, but I couldn't catch anything even after sitting by the pond for days. In hindsight, I think it's because I lacked an assistant.

When it comes to fishing, I immediately thought of you, my dear friend! You're the perfect person to count on. You travel the world and fished all over the world &mdash; You are the master of masters in fishing! Come and help me out. Are the fish here too full? Or maybe they don't like my bait?

Though I failed in fishing, I plunged into the water and successfully caught quite a couple of nice fish! Tender fish slices go perfectly with Yang Chun Noodles &mdash; aromatic and fresh, a perfect combination of stillness and movement. Such a dish is simply food for the soul, I mustn't have it all for myself!

A grain of rice on the ground, a bird flying in the sky.

With me, Hu Tao around, you'll be so happy you could die.

Come quick! I'll be right here waiting for you!
