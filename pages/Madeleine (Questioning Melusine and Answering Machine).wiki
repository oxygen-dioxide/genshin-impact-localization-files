==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
Madeleine is the wife of [[Baulande]], having a child named [[Kevin]] with him. Both were members of the Fatui, though Madeleine took the time to help raise Kevin.

When [[Sir Arthur]] was stolen from [[The Steambird]], the [[Traveler]], [[Paimon]], [[Talochard]] and [["Curve"]] were directed to [[Rocher]], though Rocher's dog [[Baulande! Lombroso!]] instead directed them to Madeleine and Kevin. Further investigation reveals that Bauland was helping the Fatui with finding [[Mosso Lombroso]]'s workshop in the hopes of an early retirement if he was successful in his mission. She took their arrival as a bad sign and wants Bauland to abort the mission to hide and live peacefully, though he was initially insistent on completing it. Eventually, she convinces him to abandon it, and as a result of directly disobeying a [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers|Lord Harbinger's]] orders, the three went into hiding.
