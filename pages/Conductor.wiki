The '''Conductor''' was the leader of the [[Wanderer's Troupe (Faction)|Wanderer's Troupe]] who lived a thousand years ago, during the twilight of the [[Mondstadt Aristocracy]].<ref name="widsith">{{Ref/Weapon|The Widsith}}</ref>

==Story==
The Conductor first met with the [[Sojourner]], and later the [[Dawnlight Swordswoman]] and [[Kreuzlied]], with whom he formed the Wanderer's Troupe.<ref name="goblet">{{Ref/Arti|Goblet of the Sojourner}}</ref> The group members were adept at both music and combat. Together they traveled across [[Teyvat]], and though they owned no sheet music, they would record their experiences within the book known as [[The Widsith]].<ref name="tophat">{{Ref/Arti|Conductor's Top Hat}}</ref>

The troupe eventually arrived in [[Mondstadt]], and their final act was to storm the [[City of Mondstadt]] in an attempt to overthrow the corrupt aristocracy.<ref name="widsith"/> However, their uprising failed and the Conductor died in battle. The Conductor held onto The Widsith in his last moments, and even after his death, was still holding onto it tightly.<ref name="tophat"/>
