The '''Conductor''' was the leader of the [[Wanderer's Troupe (Faction)|Wanderer's Troupe]] who lived a thousand years ago, during the twilight of [[Mondstadt]]'s [[Timeline|Aristocratic period]]. He came from [[Teyvat]], but his nationality is unknown.

==Story==
The Conductor first met with the [[Sojourner]], and later the [[Dawnlight Swordswoman]] and [[Kreuzlied]], with whom he formed the Wanderer's Troupe.

As a group they both performed music and fought against the oppressive Aristocracy. As part of the Troupe, the Conductor wielded [[The Widsith]]. Their final act was to storm the [[City of Mondstadt]] in an attempt to overthrow the Aristocracy. They failed, however, and the Conductor died in battle.
