==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Etsuko:''' There has to be something wrong with the way the Guild rated this commission's difficulty...
:{{DIcon}} Not going back to the Guild yet?
::'''Etsuko:''' Oh, hey, it's you.
::'''Etsuko:''' [[Taisuke]]'s been really taken with that talking cat named [[Neko]]. He insists that we continue investigating for a while.
::'''Etsuko:''' I'm just here to make sure that he doesn't do anything idiotic in the process.
::'''Etsuko:''' And I'm also taking this opportunity to slack off for a bit.
::{{DIcon}} Do you not like Neko?
::'''Etsuko:''' I don't think I'd put it in those terms. I've just got no interest in her.
::'''Etsuko:''' I came to this island to get this commission done.
::'''Etsuko:''' I've never been very interested in much other than that.
::'''Etsuko:''' The way I see it, if you get too invested in things outside the remit of your commission while you're doing it, you'll veer off onto a branching path...
::'''Etsuko:''' And I wouldn't call that a good thing for a professional adventurer.
::{{DIcon}} Well, isn't the commission complete?
::'''Etsuko:''' Yes. Which is why I'm over here slacking off in the Guild's name, see?
::'''Etsuko:''' I wouldn't dare hang around here doing nothing otherwise.
::'''Etsuko:''' To tell you the truth, though, this place is still very concerning.
::'''Etsuko:''' "[[Asase Shrine]]," "[[Asase Hibiki|Hibiki]]"... and of course, "[[Ako Domeki|Domeki]]."
::'''Etsuko:''' I just feel that many heretofore undiscovered secrets still lie buried here on [[Seirai Island]].
::'''Etsuko:''' That said... Heh, I'm too lazy to figure them all out myself.
::'''Etsuko:''' Once we get back to the Guild, I'll settle those reports, and we'll leave it to them to figure out a larger schema for exploring Seirai Island.
::'''Etsuko:''' But before that... let me just slack here for a while more.
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Etsuko:''' Goodbye, and safe travels!
