==Profile==
Draff, [[Diona]]'s father and a distant descendant of [[Olaf]], is the head hunter for the village of Springvale. He is a firm believer in sustainability and a capable hunter and leader. However, he is an alcoholic and a known member of the [[Four Drunkards]]. His egocentrism and lack of inhibition under the influence of alcohol is remarked on by several other NPCs, and is the reason why Diona despises alcohol so much. There was a point in time, however, when even Draff (at least temporarily) gave up drinking &mdash; after [[Timmie]]'s father, his friend, had his son and decided to become a better role model for him.

===Personality===
''(To be added.)''

===Appearance===
Draff is part of the [[Kätzlein Bloodline]]. He has brown hair, cat ears, a beard and a moustache. He carries a bow and an arrow. Draff also has bandages and he is wearing yellowish boots.

;(Before completing [[Mondstadt Gastronomy Trip]])
:'''Draff:''' Traveler? What do you want?
;(After completing Mondstadt Gastronomy Trip)
:'''Draff:''' Traveler, I remember you. I see you've been getting more familiar with our town here.
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Draff knows; Version 1)
:::'''Draff:''' During our hunt, Allan reported to me that he'd sighted ores nearby that resembled Crystal Ores...
:::'''Draff:''' Just that they had a different color, and were rarer. You'll have to ask [[Wagner]] for the specifics, he probably knows far more than me...
:::'''Draff:''' While Crystal Ores don't fall within the purview of our hunts, I did record their positions. They were somewhere around...
:::'''Draff:''' Mm. I've marked them down on your map. Perhaps that will be of some help to you.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s nearby marked on the map)
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Draff knows; Version 2)
:::'''Draff:''' I remember that while we were out hunting, Allan reported that he'd seen ores nearby that looked like Crystal Ore.
:::'''Draff:''' While Crystal Ores don't fall within the purview of our hunts, I did record their positions. They were somewhere around...
:::'''Draff:''' Mm. I've marked them down on your map. Perhaps that will be of some help to you.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s nearby marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Draff knows)
:::'''Draff:''' To a hunter, nothing is more worth noting than the prey. I can't say if anything has made an impression on me otherwise.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} Could you sell me some game you hunted?
::'''Draff:''' Depends on how much you want... I can sell some of it to you. Anything you get from us directly is going to be fresher than anything you find in the shops.
:;(Opens Shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
:;(Only available prior to completing [[Mondstadt Gastronomy Trip]])
::'''Draff:''' I am Draff, you can think of me as the head of the hunters. The best hunter in the town.
::'''Draff:''' Most of meat from our hunts goes straight to the [[Good Hunter]], a restaurant in the city.
::'''Draff:''' If you're here to make a bulk order of meat, I'm afraid we don't have the capacity to take it on.
:{{DIcon}} How are things lately?
:;(After completing [[Mondstadt Gastronomy Trip]])
::'''Draff:''' Well, what can I say? The last Springvale Cookoff was crowded with nearly the whole town discussing every topic under the sun. The better the conversations, the more meat they eat, you know.
::'''Draff:''' As head of all the hunters in this town, I guess you could say I'm also the brains behind 'em all too, haha.
::'''Draff:''' As for my great ancestor, Olaf, his relatives have all succumbed to the grip of time. What a pity...
::'''Draff:''' When hunting season's over, I should show my respect for my ancestors by going out and drinking with him. It always feels kind of weird to say that...
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about your family.
::'''Draff:''' Stay away from my daughter, Diona.
::'''Draff:''' She will learn the hunting trade from me and take over as leader of this town.
::'''Draff:''' But right now she's at that rebellious age, and she's gone off to work in the city as a bartender or something...
::'''Draff:''' *sigh* Never mind, I just need to be patient. She's my daughter after all, and if she's got her heart set on doing something she'll not go back on it easily.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Draff:''' Bye.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Draff:''' Aha, traveler!
:'''Draff:''' When the hunt is over, it's time to drink to your heart's content! Here, come on...
:{{DIcon}} Is there anything of note nearby?
::'''Draff:''' With such fine wine before me, what would I care about what's nearby or anything...
::'''Draff:''' Oh, don't look so uptight. How about joining me for a mug or two?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
:;(Only available prior to completing [[Mondstadt Gastronomy Trip]])
::'''Draff:''' Put it like this &mdash; every time you eat meat in the city, you're eating something caught by a Springvale hunter.
::'''Draff:''' And I am the head of those hunters!
::'''Draff:''' You could say I'm the man of the house of this whole darn town! Hahaha...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} How's the haul?
::'''Draff:''' Envious? Well, it's fine. I'm in a good mood right now. There's some leftover meat from our daytime delivery. Take it, take it!
::'''Draff:''' It's on me, don't worry &mdash; but remember, the best meat has to go with the best wine!
::;(Obtain [[Raw Meat]] ×6)
:{{DIcon}} You seem to be very happy.
:;(After completing [[Mondstadt Gastronomy Trip]])
::'''Draff:''' Of course! Let me put it this way &mdash; every time you eat meat in the city, you're eating something caught by a Springvale hunter.
::'''Draff:''' And I am the head of those hunters!
::'''Draff:''' You could say I'm the man of the house of this whole darn town! Hahaha...
::'''Draff:''' Huh? Now where's that great ancestor of mine gone to? Things get a bit fuzzy after drinking so much...
:{{DIcon}} You seem like you've drunk a lot...
::'''Draff:''' No good hunting session is complete without a good drinking session afterwards!
::'''Draff:''' What's more, my daughter Diona is one of the top bartenders in Mondstadt...
::'''Draff:''' That hasn't changed how much she nags me about my drinking, mind you...
::{{DIcon}} How long is the hunt over for?
::'''Draff:''' Until the next hunt, of course! Is that a trick question or something?
:{{DIcon}} Uh, bye.
::'''Draff:''' Goodbye! Come early enough next time and there might still be a few drinks left for you! Hahaha!
