|desc_suspicious = The dull outer skin has a rather sticky mouthfeel which, when combined with the dry stuffing within, makes this dish a torment best ended sooner.
|desc_basic      = The stuffing is taken from whole fresh shrimp, and the glistening quality of the flour can be guessed at from the translucence of the outer skin. Has a springy, tasty chew.
|desc_delicious  = The outer skin is as clear as its crystal namesake, and when it enters the mouth, one's tongue could be forgiven for thinking that the fresh shrimp within is still alive. Those who eat it can only lament that four pieces per serving is far, far too few.
