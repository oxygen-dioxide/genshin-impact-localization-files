==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Iradj:''' Tell me, where can I find a [[claymore]] that's both elegant and easy to use?
:{{DIcon}} You like using Claymores?
::'''Iradj:''' Ahaha... I'm not that skilled. I only dabble with scimitars.
::'''Iradj:''' Anyway, it's not for me. I was hoping to find a handy weapon for [[Dehya|Flame-Mane]], a fellow [[The Eremites|Eremite]].
::'''Iradj:''' She wields greatswords the best among us. Seeing her in action is always a glorious sight to behold...
::'''Iradj:''' If I can find the best greatsword in all of [[Sumeru]], then I must get it for her! I only hope she won't refuse it when I do...
:{{DIcon}} Why don't you go ask [[Ahangar|the blacksmith]]?
::'''Iradj:''' The blacksmith, huh... I'd better not.
::'''Iradj:''' The boss there is my adoptive father. He's always talking about wanting us to come back and take over the family business.
::'''Iradj:''' He's been a great father to us, so we always feel bad whenever we have to turn him down...
::'''Iradj:''' So, it's best that I don't bother him with this sword matter.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry...
::'''Iradj:''' You don't know either, huh...? It's fine.
