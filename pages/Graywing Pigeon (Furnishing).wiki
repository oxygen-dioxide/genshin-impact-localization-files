|description    = A common avian species in [[Teyvat]]. Plump and meaty, but can also be trained to deliver messages.<br>An ordinary pigeon that takes its name from its gray feathers. This pigeon's feathers become gradually greener along the neck, which unfortunately led the normally not-so-observant [[Paimon]] into believing that they're the exact same color as [[Chubby]]'s. In truth, the greater similarity between the two lies in them both serving as punctual messengers.
