'''Coagulation Pearls''' are an exploration mechanic in [[Natlan]]. They can temporarily convert [[liquid Phlogiston]] into [[solid Phlogiston]].

Coagulation Pearls can be grabbed (and launched) by [[Yumkasaur]]s and [[Scions of the Canopy]] characters. While carrying a Coagulation Pearl, any liquid Phlogiston within a certain range of the player will automatically turn solid. Hidden solid Phlogiston walls and platforms may also be revealed. As soon as the solidified Phlogiston leaves the player's AoE, it will revert to its original form.

Coagulation Pearls can be placed in '''Coagulated Pedestals'''. Any liquid Phlogiston near an activated Coagulated Pedestal will remain solid until it is deactivated. If a pedestal's Coagulation Pearl is removed and lost (i.e., not held or placed in another Coagulated Pedestal), it will generate a new one within a few seconds.
