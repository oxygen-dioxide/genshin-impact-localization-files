But it's no biggie, all that hyperactive energy makes for a more exciting wushou dance. Also, I feel like watching Man Chai has helped me get a better handle on how suanni look in action.

I always try to rinse off the molten lava sauce before each bite, but I'm still like "ss, ah, ss, ah" trying to cool my mouth down, hahaha!

She's the one who spearheaded the crackdown on all that. ...You think my job's at risk, huh? Haha, they ain't gonna get rid of me that easily.

Once, she saw that my Wushou head was looking a little worse for wear, and instantly said she could make, like, ten more for me, all twice my size. She was pretty insistent &mdash; it took me forever to talk her down to just remodeling the one I already had... And boy, is this an improvement! It looks way more impressive, it's much lighter, and the lion blanket constantly rustles in the air like there's an adeptal wind making it dance. I couldn't be happier with it!

There's even a place where you can bring your own ingredients. Just tell her Gaming told you about it, and she'll know the one.

Best-case scenario, you might fall off a high pole during a wushou dance and be bedridden for a couple of weeks. Worst-case scenario, you run into bandits on a delivery run and you can't fight 'em off. Definitely lose the cargo, probably your life too... Scary thought, huh?
