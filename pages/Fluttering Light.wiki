|description    = A street lamp made from [[Adhigama Wood]] protected by a ring-shaped structure, often seen on the south border of [[Caravan Ribat]]. These lamps require little maintenance even when placed in the windy desert and are thus extremely practical. The lamp itself has an elegant appearance, and the extent of its swaying can be used to determine wind speed. In an emergency, stronger mercenaries may even be able to wrench it out from the ground and use it as a weapon against the many dangerous creatures from the desert. When it's used for fighting against enemies, the unique shape of the lamp also comes in handy...
