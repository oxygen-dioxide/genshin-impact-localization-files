:'''Netsuke no Gen Crafts Advertisement Board:''' Our shop specializes in netsuke handed down through the generations. They can be quite pricey, and the owner is not very talkative, so we do not accept bargaining. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience caused!
:'''Netsuke no Gen Crafts Advertisement Board:''' Other than netsuke, we also make custom paper umbrellas, Shogi sets, Go sets, masks, daruma and household pottery. Prices are reasonable, and quality is guaranteed!
:'''Netsuke no Gen Crafts Advertisement Board:''' We also buy Electro Sigils all year long. Customers can use Electro Sigils to redeem their desired merchandise in our store.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|Part of a new wave of artisan stores in Inazuma. Other than netsuke, this shop also makes some other artworks, and even engages in the business of obtaining all manner of trading interesting curios for Electro Sigils from adventurers. While the boss has a good relationship with the neighbors, they don't seem to be an ordinary civilian. Perhaps there is some unknown family secret to be had there...|[[Map]] description}}

==Trivia==
* According to Genichirou, {{Lang|the "Gen" part of the name|ja=源|ja_rm=gen|ja_tl=source}} is taken directly from {{Lang|his own name|ja=源一郎|ja_rm=Gen'ichirou}}.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Mikoshi Genichirou|quote=As for the "Gen" part of the name... Well, it's my name, actually.}}</ref>
*The "unknown family secret" may relate to Genichirou's [[Mikoshi Clan]] lineage, which was a clan with [[oni]] heritage. Three members of the clan played a prominent role in the events of the [[cataclysm]] five hundred years ago: [[Chiyo]], [[Iwakura Michihiro]] (who would later go on to establish the [[Iwakura Clan]]), and [[Mikoshi Nagamasa]].
