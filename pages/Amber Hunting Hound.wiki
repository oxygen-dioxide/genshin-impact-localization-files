|description = Humanity's best friend!<br>These dogs have dark gold fur, and of [[Fontaine]]'s hunting hounds their blood is the purest. Loyal, possessed of acute noses, and agile, these aid humans in chasing game and criminals alike.<br>It is even said that they do well in the water, though few have ever witnessed them swimming &mdash; most nowadays take this saying to be a curious invention of [[The Steambird]].
