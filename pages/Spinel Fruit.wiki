==Descriptions==
{{Description|The crystalline trees that grow widely in areas with Liquid Phlogiston produce these gem-shaped fruits after absorbing phlogiston.<br>In [[Records of Hanan Pacha|some ancient woven scrolls]], especially in some versions of stories relating to [[Waxaklahun Ubah Kan]], Spinel Fruit were often disguised as gems in a plot to deceive the dragon that had made its lair within the [[Great Volcano of Tollan|sacred mountain]]. Blinded by greed, it is said to have surrendered the flaming seed of [[phlogiston]] in exchange for these deceptive fruits. By the time the dragon realized it had been duped, Waxaklahun Ubah Kan was, of course, already long gone. Stories related to Spinel Fruit have generally followed a similar pattern.|[[Archive]]}}
