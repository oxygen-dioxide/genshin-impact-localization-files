==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Soltani:''' Hello, would you like to let me show you the way?
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Soltani:''' I'm a servant of this house at your service.
::'''Soltani:''' Seeing as how you've been wandering aimlessly. Please pardon me... Is the butler giving random directions again?
::'''Soltani:''' *sigh* If you had the "privilege" to speak to the butler, then please don't take him seriously.
::'''Soltani:''' This place may seem grand and magnificent, but it's still quite remote and isolated compared to the city. The Lord prefers a life of tranquility and reclusiveness, so our household staff is limited in numbers.
::'''Soltani:''' I suggest you pay attention to your surroundings when going while in the vicinity, especially when you're not within the range of this property.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Thanks for the reminder.
:::'''Soltani:''' It's nothing. I was just speaking from experience.
:::'''Soltani:''' It is hard to meet someone as sensible and open to suggestions as you are.
::;(Obtain [[Hero's Wit]] ×2)
:{{DIcon}} I'll quit bothering you then.
::'''Soltani:''' Have a nice day.
