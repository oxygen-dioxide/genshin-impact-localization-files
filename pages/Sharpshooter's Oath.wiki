==Description==
A long time ago, in a place far, far away... Tragedy struck.<br />
Brothers took to arms against one another.<br />
One among them was a great archer. After suffering a humiliating defeat, he made a vow:<br />
"Until I have brought down my enemies,"<br />
"Until I have pierced their throats and their blood has run dry, I shall not clean my feet."<br />
And so, the great archer fell prey to a foot infection.
