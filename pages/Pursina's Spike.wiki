'''Pursina's Spikes''' are mechanisms invented by [[Pursina]] featured in the [[Shadow of the Ancients]] and [[A Muddy Bizarre Adventure]] events. According to [[Hosseini]], in theory, they can be used to disrupt the flow of ley line energies.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Journey to Tsurumi}}</ref>

|text1  = When the challenge starts, you will have to use Electro attacks to activate Pursina's Spikes and continue charging them.
|image2 = Tutorial Shadow of the Ancients Sampling 2.png
|text2  = Activated Pursina's Spikes will convert Electro energy into motive force to recharge itself.<br />The recharge rate of Pursina's Spikes is dependent on the levels of Electro energy provided. When the Electro energy provided is low, its recharge rate will be slowed. If its Electro levels drop to their lowest point, the Spikes will stop charging altogether.
|image3 = Tutorial Shadow of the Ancients Sampling 3.png
|text3  = Before an activated Pursina's Spike is fully charged, it will attract nearby opponents to come and attack it.<br />Defeat these opponents to prevent the Pursina's Spikes' integrity from dropping. If one Spike's integrity drops fully, the challenge will fail.

===Circulation Theory===
In [[A Muddy Bizarre Adventure#Circulation Theory|Circulation Theory]], the Pursina's Spike will release a shockwave every '''5''' seconds, dealing {{Color|AoE True Physical DMG}}. This DMG is considered a [[Blunt Attack]] and can trigger [[Shatter]]. Enemies hit by the shockwave will have their [[Resistance]]s reduced by '''20%''' for '''6''' seconds.
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial A Muddy Bizarre Adventure 5.png
|text1  = As you defeat all opponents within the time limit, the Pursina's Spike in operation will release shockwaves at intervals that will deal DMG to opponents they hit and dispel the buffs that those opponents possess.
|image2 = Tutorial A Muddy Bizarre Adventure 6.png
|text2  = The arena will constantly brim over with dark mud. Once this mud covers the Pursina's Spike, it will cause a fault that prevents the Spike from unleashing shockwaves. Use Blooming Light to destroy Oozing Concretions to maintain the Spike's operation such that it may continue to aid you.
