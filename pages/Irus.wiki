==Profile==
Irus, along with her comrades [[Kaykaus]] and [[Kaykubad]], were hired by [[Jakob]] to acquire paintings from [[Mamere]] the [[Melusine]] as part of his plan to revive the great beast [[Elynas (NPC)|Elynas]]. While meeting with her, the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] stumbled onto the meeting, believing that Mamere was being bullied. Instead, they were at an impasse because they were offering [[Mora]] as payment, causing Mamere to refuse the payment, as she was not interested in it and had nothing else to offer in return. After being driven off by the Traveler, Irus and her comrades later attempt to steal Mamere's paintings with Jakob's assistance, but were forced to retreat again after another beating.

Jakob later had the group mine red rocks and began a summoning incantation, considering Irus and her group useless and refusing to pay them (though it is likely he had no Mora at all). Irus sought revenge, but had to flee when monsters began appearing. After the ground starts to shake again, Irus and her group fight with the Traveler against the monsters before surrendering to [[Virda]]. Kaykaus and Kaykubad are considered accessories to the crime and are released after paying a fine, while Irus is sent to the Fortress of Meropide to serve out her sentence. The Traveler can find her in the Production Zone, where she wonders what the Traveler was sent for, only to learn they were allowed to come in and out. She considers the prison to be decent, finding the guards friendly and pleased that she was fed daily. She also hopes that Kaykaus and Kaykubad would be able to find reliable employers and honest work in her absence.

===Appearance===
{{tx|Missing description of appearance during dialogue}}. During combat, she uses the [[Eremite Axe Vanguard]] model.

:'''Irus:''' I didn't expect to see you here. What're you in for?
:{{DIcon}} I haven't committed any crimes...
::'''Irus:''' What a pity.
::{{DIcon}} A pity?
:::'''Irus:''' Oh, I didn't mean anything by it. Actually, this place isn't half bad.
:::'''Irus:''' The guards here are pretty friendly. And as long as you work, you get [[Credit Coupons]]. Heck, they even feed you on a daily basis. If nothing else, it's certainly more stable than being a mercenary.
::{{DIcon}} What about your companions?
:::'''Irus:''' As for [[Kaykaus]] and [[Kaykubad]], they were only considered accessories, so they were free to go after paying a fine.
:::'''Irus:''' I hope they can find more reliable employers and do some honest work for once.
:{{DIcon}} See you later.
::'''Irus:''' Take care! I gotta say, saying "See you later" in a place like this feels quite strange.
