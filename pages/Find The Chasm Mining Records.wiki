==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Read the Chasm Mining Archive)
:'''The Chasm Mining Archive:''' "...The elemental reactions within The Chasm have, over its long history, turned the soil a wondrous violet-red..."
:'''The Chasm Mining Archive:''' "...The Glazed Sand Crystal that can be gathered and processed from within has an almost unearthly, lovely luster to it..."
:'''The Chasm Mining Archive:''' "...The tradition of processing Glazed Sand Crystal has played a massive part in the fame that Liyue's porcelain goods have won..."

;(Read the Chasm Mining Report)
:'''The Chasm Mining Report:''' "...The areas in which Lumenstone growths appear are still expanding. It's almost like it is spreading. The raw Lumenspar itself is not harmful, but as it is being formed, it will absorb valuable ore nearby and cause the ore to undergo changes..."
:'''The Chasm Mining Report:''' "...At this rate, this ore will seriously devalue and affect the production of all the others. We urge Huishan Hall to dispatch specialists to investigate the properties and function of this ore and fashion a long-term plan..."

;(Read the Chasm Spiritstone Investigation Report)
:'''The Chasm Spiritstone Investigation Report:''' "The 'Spiritstones' and 'Wishstones' that the miners whisper about are legends derived from a mysterious crystal that grows in the depths of The Chasm."
:'''The Chasm Spiritstone Investigation Report:''' "The samples we have retrieved are very clearly different from most ore that can be found in Teyvat. They seem to be capable of changing the material structure of their surroundings. Perhaps this has to do with the ancient legend of the 'heavenly star' that plunged into The Chasm..."
:'''The Chasm Spiritstone Investigation Report:''' "...Or perhaps that same 'heavenly star' that sleeps in The Chasm might still be deeper within the earth, awaiting discovery...?"
