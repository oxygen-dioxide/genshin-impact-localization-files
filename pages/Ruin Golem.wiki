'''Ruin Golems''' are massive [[Khaenri'ah]]n mechanical constructs. In the local lexicon of Khaenri'ah, they are known as '''Mechanical Wardens'''.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Vimana Agama: First Chapter}}</ref> Three Ruin Golems are currently known: one in [[Sumeru]]'s [[Avidya Forest]] at [[Devantaka Mountain]] and two in the [[Great Red Sand]] at the [[Valley of Dahri]] and [[Desert of Hadramaveth]], respectively.

Unlike their [[Automatons]], Khaenri'ah's Ruin Golems were manned by a crew of people. The [[Schwanenritter]] were in charge of the Ruin Golem at Devantaka Mountain, but were all slain either due to infighting or at the hands of the [[Abyss]]al dark beasts that invaded [[Teyvat]] after Khaenri'ah fell.
