==Description==
"Must my life wither like fresh flowers?"<br><!--
-->"Will all my blazing glory burn out into grey ash in the end?"<br><!--
-->"Will even my illustrious name eventually fade into shadow?"<br><!--
-->"Even if it is as brilliant as a blooming flower, and light as a song."<br><br><!--
-->[[Sakkuk|She]] knew not how many times she had crossed the mountain's spine, just as she could no longer recall how many winters she had endured.<br><!--
-->Every year, before the [[Embercore Flower]]s bloomed, the mistress of the mountain mines would come alone to the wilds of [[Tequemecan Valley]],<br><!--
-->Following ancient tradition, she offered dew-kissed flowers to those friends who could not witness the coming of dawn.<br><!--
-->The heart that was once cold and hard as obsidian had been eroded and softened by time,<br><!--
-->But anyone who could receive that warmth, no matter who, had already long since returned to the [[Sacred Flame]].<br><br><!--
-->Until the rumbling of the mines and the song of the artisans working shook her awake from her bitter memories,<br><!--
-->The representative of the Chiefs suddenly realized that the echoes of the [[Nanatzcayan]] had already reached this place.<br><!--
-->The once deserted, lonely mountains now resounded with echoes of laughter and peals of joy like ringing bells.<br><!--
-->It was what the young once dreamed of during the years when they were still hidden from those around them,<br><!--
-->Belonging to countless beings who struggled to overthrow the [[Och-Kan|usurpers]], and it belonged to the future, the quickening of civilization.<br><br><!--
-->And so the representative, who was by no means still young, began to laugh, and though in those days she had written it off as a mere prank,<br><!--
-->She sang the song [[Scarlet-Eyed Youth|he]] had once taught her, but that she had been too embarrassed to ever sing to him.<br><!--
-->Like a tambourine adorned with flowers, a tale ornamented with tears, responding to the melody echoing amidst the mountains,<br><!--
-->[[Ancient Name|Like stone engraved and echoing peaks, as though tempered by the fires of the forge, gave their blessings to all beings,<br><!--
-->Converge, disperse, in ashes be reborn, for flames born anew, and the blazing dawn.]]<br><br><!--
-->In the thousands of years after authority was returned to the tribes, countless stories were scattered in the moonlight,<br><!--
-->The ballads once kept by "Peace-Reforger" Sakkuk now long lost.<br><!--
-->Yet that resolute, sharp rhythm that has been passed down to this day with every stroke of hammer on chisel,<br><!--
-->After all, that burning rhythm is the blood that has flowed through the mines since ancient times,<br><!--
-->And the sparks showering forth from the hammer's blows are the song dedicated to those who resist, a melody that will never wither.<br><br><!--
-->"Must my life wither like fresh flowers?"<br><!--
-->"When all is quiet chaos, whither will my heart go?"<br><!--
-->"None stay forever in this world, we but briefly pass through."<br><!--
-->"But here, there were once flowers &mdash; here, there was once song."
