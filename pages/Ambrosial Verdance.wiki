'''Ambrosial Verdance''' is [[Emilie]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
On her head, Emilie wears a dark-green fascinator hat lined by black lace at the front with a light green bow, which has a gold bell-like ornament from which three white tear-shaped gems hang from it, as well as a loose black ribbon fading to a dark-nightshade at the back.

She wears dark-nightshade leotard, as well as detached puffy sleeves with gold details held by multiple metal straps. Over this, she wears a white collar with a gold chain that holds a purple bell-like ornament fading to blue, two tails in front that extend down to her chest, white ruffles on the shoulders, and a black ribbon with a yellow flower. She wears a black underbust bodice with lace-up sides and a front lined by gold, held by gold embellishments at the top, as well as two knee-length tails at the back with gold vine and flower designs and three dark-green stripes. Her {{Pneuma}}-aligned {{Dendro}} [[Vision]] hangs from a gold chain on the left side of the bodice. Extending from her bodice is a dark-green skirt stopping just below her knees, with gold details, ends that resemble flower petals, and a full-length slit on the right side that's lined by layered white and light-green fabric.

On her feet she wears low pale-green heels with dark-green bows at the back, white vine-like details on the sides, and a white bell-like design on the front.
