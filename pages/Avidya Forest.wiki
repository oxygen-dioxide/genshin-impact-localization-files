{{Location Intro|description=<p>Avidya Forest is a lush, green forest located in eastern [[Sumeru]]. It is the main area and most populous section of Sumeru apart from Ardravi Valley. The forest is also home to [[Sumeru City]] which houses [[The Akademiya]], and [[Gandharva Ville]], which is the base of the [[Forest Watchers]]. The Forest Watchers have guarded the forest for many years in order to ensure the forest's survival.</p><!--

--><p>Many unique flora and fauna grow in the Avidya Forest, such as [[Padisarah]]s, [[Nilotpala Lotus|Nilopata Lotuses]] or [[Rukkhashava Mushrooms]]. Apart from Flowers, there are also different species and breeds of animals found, like [[Shroomboar]]s. In the forest, you wil also find many, many special breeds of [[Fungi|Shroomkin]] out in the wild.</p>}}

The Avidya Forest is also the first [[area]] in [[Sumeru]] that the [[Traveler]] enters.

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* {{lang|{{w|Avidyā (Buddhism)|''Avidyā''}}|sa=अविद्या}} is a Vedic Sanskrit word used in {{w|Dharma|Dharmic religions}}, often translated as "ignorance," but more literally means "unwisdom" and is the antithesis of {{w|Vidya (philosophy)|''Vidya''}}. ''Avidyā'' is the main cause of suffering and leads to rebirth (also called reincarnation); the primary goal in most Dharmic religions is to eliminate avidyā through wisdom and attain liberation from rebirth and suffering.
* In Avidya Forest's Chinese name, the term {{zh|道成|rm=Dàochéng}} is used in the Christian concept of {{lang|{{w|Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation}}|zh={{w|zh:道成肉身|'''道成'''肉身}}}}, which is the belief that Jesus was both fully God and fully human.
