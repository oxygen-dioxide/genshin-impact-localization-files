===Etymology===
*{{lang|{{w|Avidyā (Buddhism)|''Avidyā''}}|sa=अविद्या}} is a Vedic Sanskrit word used in {{w|Dharma|Dharmic religions}}, often translated as "ignorance," but more literally means "unwisdom" and is the antithesis of {{w|Vidya (philosophy)|''Vidya''}}. ''Avidyā'' is the main cause of suffering and leads to rebirth (also called reincarnation); the primary goal in most Dharmic religions is to eliminate avidyā through wisdom and attain liberation from rebirth and suffering.
*In Avidya Forest's Chinese name, the term {{lang|mini=1|zh=道成|zh_rm=Dàochéng}} is used in the Christian concept of {{lang|{{w|Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation}}|zh={{w|zh:道成肉身|'''道成'''肉身}}}}, which is the belief that Jesus was both fully God and fully human.
