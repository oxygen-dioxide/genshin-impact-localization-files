{{Description|A large opera house situated in Erinnyes that also serves as the symbol of trials and judgment. The true and the fantastical, the comedic and tragic find a stage here equally. Perhaps it truly is as an ancient Fontainian playwright once said &mdash; "All the world's a stage, and all of us merely players."}}
{{Location Intro|description=<p>{{If Self|Opera Epiclese|It|Opera Epiclese}} is an opera house designed to function as the main courthouse of Fontaine, located on the island of [[Erinnyes]]. Besides trials, the building hosts a variety of other performances, such as [[Lyney]]'s magic shows.</p><p>Behind the opera house, the [[Fortress of Meropide]] can be accessed using a lift which descends to [[River Talionis]]. This lift is unlocked during {{Quest|A Tea Party Most Thorny}}.</p>}}

The [[Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale]] resides inside the opera house at the back of the stage, below the seat from which [[Neuvillette]] presides as judge during trials.

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* {{fr|Épiclèse}} is the francized form of {{Lang|{{w|epiclesis}}|grc=ἐπίκλησις|grc_rm=épíklesis|"epiclesis"}}, meaning "surname" or "invocation." In Ancient Greek religion, the word was used as an epithet during religious invocations. It was later adapted into Christian tradition, with the invocation in question becoming that of the Holy Spirit into the Eucharist.
