|vo_05_01_tx         = I always have to put on an act around other people, because they see me only as the second son of the Feiyun Commerce Guild. It's a relief that I can just be myself around you. I think it's because you don't see me in the same way.

|vo_07_03_tx         = Must-see places in [[Liyue]]? That's a tough question. Hmm... The place I would miss the most if it disappeared would be Wanwen Bookhouse, first and foremost. The Guhua Sect would be in the top ten, too.

|vo_07_04_tx         = I used to like rabbits, but I'm more a fan of stags now. To me, the saying "May my final stand be a monument to chivalry" is about abandoning worldly possessions and reaching enlightenment. But the stag's final resting place represents the hope for life anew. Oh, how I'd love to see it again.<ref group="TN â€¢">The phrase "But the stag's final resting place represents the hope for life anew" is a mistranslation; it is better translated as "But the stag represents the hope of being unexpectedly rescued from a desperate situation."</ref>

|vo_08_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Chongyun.ogg
|vo_08_03_tx         = Ah, dear Chongyun. Though he understands me quite well, one has to exercise caution when teaming up with him to go on a quest. He is making good progress in the martial arts, but I would say he hasn't quite internalized the chivalric code yet... He needs more practice. Especially at eating spicy food.

|vo_08_05_actual     = Ah yes, the young lady who is now the {{Highlight|master}} of the [[Wangsheng Funeral Parlor]]. If you're asking what I think about her as a person...

|vo_08_07_tx         = When you first spot Xiangling out and about, the first thing you should do is check the look on her face. Especially when she's just coming back from collecting new ingredients &mdash; the more excited she looks, the more dangerous it is to approach. Because if she sees you, she'll force you to taste-test her latest concoction... I usually get Chongyun to handle these situations, hehe...
|vo_08_07_mention    = Chongyun,Xiangling
|vo_08_08_title      = About [[Xinyan]]

|vo_08_08_tx         = Where does Xinyan perform? Anywhere from Chihu Rock to Yujing Terrace &mdash; no spot is untouched by her disruptive presence... A quiet day when I can curl up with a good book is a rare treasure indeed.

|vo_08_10_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Zhongli.ogg
|vo_08_10_tx         = My father and brother entertained that gentleman as a guest once. From the way they were acting, he must be a very high-profile figure indeed. I also heard that he directs funerals for [[adepti]], so he must surely have some inside information. We should do some digging and see what we can find out about him!
|vo_08_10_mention    = Zhongli

|vo_08_12_tx         = Have you heard the expression "same person, different face"? Ms. Yelan gives me precisely this feeling. When she came to visit my family, my father and brother treated her with respect, and she was pleasant and polite in return. She seemed like a kind and mature young lady to me. But when I saw her elsewhere, she gave a completely different impression.

It's not appropriate to discuss it out loud. There's no point in bringing it up anyway.<ref group="TN â€¢">Based on his original Chinese line, "There's no point in bringing it up anyway" is better translated as "If we talk about it openly, then there's no point in it," referring to Xingqiu's interest becoming a hero like the ones in the martial arts novels he reads.</ref>

Oh&mdash;no no no, it's not about my status or anything like that. I don't care for that kind of thing. I think my brother is something of a simpleton and I would probably end up having to do most of his job for him...
