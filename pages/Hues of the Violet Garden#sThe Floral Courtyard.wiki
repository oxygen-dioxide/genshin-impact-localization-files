| '''The purple sakura lies sparse, the clear sand is fragrant'''<br /><br />Following tradition, florists use violet branches as a floral scene and combine it with five or more Inazuma flowers. Beneath them both lies a base of pure white sand, which adds a touch of perfection to the potted courtyard.

| '''Silken and sturdy, the lotus in the pond'''<br /><br />They say that "sturdy rockeries make an ideal background." As for flowers from the harbor of stone, they came all the way from the other side of the ocean and enjoy unmatched fame amongst florists - a prized choice for the main flowers. The arrangement of such flowers should also follow the "rule of three." Combine them with a base featuring the crystal-clear pond to create a quaint scene.

|'''The jade leaves do repose, the flowers are born in the wind'''

It is said that people in the neighboring land of freedom have never reached a consensus on what a "Windblume" is, but what remains indisputable is the color - green leaves in the background and green grass on the gardening soil, which correspond to the floral scene and base in Inazuma's floral arts, respectively.

|'''The branches, curved like rainbows, are dyed in myriad colors.'''

Rarest of all floral scenes, branches curved like rainbows carry a special meaning. Flowers shipped from different countries bloom harmoniously in the same floral courtyard &mdash; that is the ultimate pursuit of a florist: to compose a symphony of various flowers' beauty like an artist does with colorful paints.
