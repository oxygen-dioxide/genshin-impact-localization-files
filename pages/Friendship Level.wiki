'''Friendship Level''' is the progression of a [[character]]'s bond with the [[Traveler]]. This progress bar is raised by obtaining [[Companionship EXP]]. All Characters in the Party gain the shown amount equally; removing or adding Characters to the Party does not give the other Characters more or less EXP.

Friendship Levels are primarily used to unlock character stories, [[:Category:Character Voice-Overs|voice-overs]], and character [[namecard]]s.

==Friendship Levels==
# Starting Friendship Level. "Character Details" and some [[Voice-Overs]] are already unlocked.
# Unlocks the character's Story 1 (found in their Profile) and their second expression in [[Photo Mode]]. Their "More About (Character) - I" voice-over line is also usually unlocked if it wasn't already unlocked.
# Unlocks Story 2 and the "More About (Character) - II" voice-over.
# Unlocks Story 3, their third expression in [[Photo Mode]], a new dialogue option when the character is placed in the [[Housing|Serenitea Pot]], and many voice-over lines, including most voice-over lines about other characters. May unlock the character's item story (the one with a unique title).
# Unlocks Story 4 and the "More About (Character) - IV" voice-over.
# Unlocks all remaining Character Stories (Story 5, Vision, and possibly the item story) and all remaining voice-over lines that are tied to Friendship Level.
# Unlocks an additional dialogue option when character is placed in the Serenitea Pot.
# No additional unlocks
# No additional unlocks
# Unlocks a [[Namecard#Character Namecards|Namecard]] for that character and progresses the [[Hitherto Unknown]] achievement.
Note that some stories and voice-over lines have additional unlock requirements, such as completion of certain quests. Also note that some voice-over lines cannot be unlocked with increased Friendship Levels, such as the lines related to ascension.
