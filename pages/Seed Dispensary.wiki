==Notes==
* When equipping this gadget, the UI in the open world will no longer show the plant name when you are nearby and will instead show the seed name. However, you will receive both the plant and the seed upon picking it.
** [[Whopperflower]]s disguised as plants will keep the plant's name and their usual &nbsp;{{DIcon}}&nbsp; icon.
* Plants harvested in the Serenitea Pot will not yield seeds.
* [[Radish]]es and [[Carrot]]s dropped by destructible items or [[Investigation]] points will not yield seeds.
* Seeds can be harvested using [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] talent.
