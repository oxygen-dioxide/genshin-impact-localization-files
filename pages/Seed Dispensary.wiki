The '''Seed Dispensary''' is a gadget received from [[Madame Ping]] and used to obtain seeds for the [[Gardening]] System in the [[Serenitea Pot]].

==Usage==
Equip the gadget to collect seeds while gathering plants in the open world.<br />
A maximum of 20 seeds of each plant can be held at a time. If the player attempts to gather more, they will get this notice: "<Plant> Seed exceeds amount limit"; the plant will still be harvested, but will not drop any seed.

==Notes==
*When equipping this gadget, the UI in the open world will no longer show the plant name when you are nearby and will instead show the seed name. However, you will receive both the plant and the seed upon picking it.
** [[Whopperflower]]s disguised as plants keep the plant's name and their usual &nbsp;{{DIcon}}&nbsp; icon.
*Plants harvested in the Serenitea Pot will not yield seeds.
*[[Radish]]es and [[Carrot]]s dropped by destructible items or [[Investigation]] points will not yield seeds.
