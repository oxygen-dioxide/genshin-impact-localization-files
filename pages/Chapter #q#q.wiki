{{Quote|In the perpetual meantime of a sheltered eternity, most are content to live, and not to dream. But in the hidden corners where the gods' gaze does not fall, there are those who dream of dreaming. Some say a few are chosen and the rest are dregs, but I say we humans have our humanity. We will defy this world with a power from beyond.|[[Dainsleif]]|[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail|Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview]]<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/TAlKhARUcoY Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview]</ref>}}
