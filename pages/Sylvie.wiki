==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sylvie:''' Hello there. Do tell &mdash; what can I do for you?
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the [[Court of Fontaine]].
::'''Sylvie:''' Is this your first time here? If it is, let me recommend some hot spots to you.
::'''Sylvie:''' If you're interested in the news and want to know more about Fontaine, I recommend you head in the direction of [[The Steambird]].
::'''Sylvie:''' If you wish, you can purchase a copy of The Steambird along the way, and if you're lucky, you might even stumble upon the scene of a journalist conducting an interview.
::'''Sylvie:''' If you're interested in the latest fashion, you can check out [[Damoville Purveyor]] in [[Court of Fontaine: Quartier Narbonnais]].
::'''Sylvie:''' Perfume and clothing stores that push the times and tides here in Fontaine can be found there, too. Many tourists fresh off the boat make Narbonnais their first stop, in fact.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the aquabuses...
::'''Sylvie:''' The Callas Line heads northward, toward the [[Fontaine Research Institute]]. The Navia Line heads to Erinnyes in the east, and the Clementine Line, the Romaritime Harbor in the south.
::'''Sylvie:''' The [[Melusine]] tour guides on board will introduce you to the unique sights of our land, so stay tuned.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Sylvie:''' It was my pleasure to serve you. May we meet again!

==Trivia==
* Sylvie states in her dialogue that Damoville Purveyor is located in Quartier Narbonnais, which contradicts the in-game [[subarea]] pop-up text that indicates the shop's location as being in [[Court of Fontaine: Vasari Passage]].
