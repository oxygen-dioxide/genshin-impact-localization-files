|text      = I was supposed to report the progress of the project to my supervisor today. However, considering that today is my birthday, my tutor extended the deadline and gave me a day off.

I'm really happy that I can put my project aside temporarily and rest for a bit.

I am going to take advantage of this rare break to walk around Port Ormos. Would you like to join me?

For me, there is nothing more satisfying than a leisurely stroll through the streets of the Port Ormos. Of course, it's even better when I'm with a close friend or two.

I'll see you later if you're free!
