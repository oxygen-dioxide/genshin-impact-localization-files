==Profile==
Koharu introduces herself as one of the house servants of the [[Kamisato Clan]]. In reality, she is implied by [[Furuta]] to be a member of the [[Shuumatsuban]] and a rookie under Furuta's training in Ninjutsu. Furuta also describes her as someone who lacks composure.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|"Outlander Brigade!"}}</ref>

According to the ''Puppy Union Admission Details'' that [[Heizou]] had given to the Traveler during the event [[Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness]], it was revealed that Koharu was one of the many people who were rescued from the warzone, with her codename being ''General Crab No. 3''. She was 25 years old during the events of that war.<ref>Event [[Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness/Story]]</ref> This implies that after the [[Yashiro Commission]] helped her to safety under the banner of the Puppy Union, they recruited her into the Shuumatsuban, while giving her the cover of a house servant of the Kamisato Clan.

In the quest [["Outlander Brigade!"]], Furuta says that [[Kamisato Ayato]] himself assigned Koharu as an actor in [[Xavier]]'s film, though Furuta doesn't really understand why. It is possible that Ayato, as head of the Shuumatsuban, believed that playing a role in the film would be a risk-free way for Koharu to experience something akin to undercover work.

===Appearance===
Koharu has black hair, black eyes, and wears a light green uniform with a red belt and heels.
