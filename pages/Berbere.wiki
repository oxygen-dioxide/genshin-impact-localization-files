==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Berbere:''' If I had the money, I would buy all the spices in Sumeru, haha!
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Berbere:''' Merchants like me who come from the desert actually rarely trade in spices.
::'''Berbere:''' Since we can go in and out of the desert, selling specialty goods is a no-brainer for us.
::'''Berbere:''' But I really like the spices of Sumeru. Different combinations and proportions create a new delicacy every time!
::'''Berbere:''' You can't find this sort of exquisite flavor outside of Sumeru, can you?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Berbere:''' Bye, hope you find your scent of Sumeru soon!
{{Dialogue End}}

==Event Dialogue==
===Chromatic Ode of Candies and Roses===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Berbere:''' Friend, have you heard the legend of the Dance of Sabzeruz? Would you like to feel the breath of the Goddess of Flowers?
:'''Berbere:''' If you think that the Goddess of Flowers can bring only the fragrance of Padisarah, then you're practically blind. The spices of Sumeru are hardly so one-note!
:'''Berbere:''' Such complex and mysterious scents can only be felt here!
