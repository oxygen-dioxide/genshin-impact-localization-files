{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Berbere:''' If I had the money, I would buy all the spices in Sumeru, haha!
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Berbere:''' Merchants like me who come from the desert actually rarely trade in spices.
::'''Berbere:''' Since we can go in and out of the desert, selling specialty goods is a no-brainer for us.
::'''Berbere:''' But I really like the spices of Sumeru. Different combinations and proportions create a new delicacy every time!
::'''Berbere:''' You can't find this sort of exquisite flavor outside of Sumeru, can you?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Berbere:''' Bye, hope you find your scent of Sumeru soon!
