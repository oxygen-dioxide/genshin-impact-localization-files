'''Treasure Compasses''' are gadgets that can be used to find nearby [[Chests]]. There are currently three compasses: one for [[Mondstadt]], one for [[Liyue]] and one for [[Inazuma]]. Their [[Diagrams]] are all obtainable from [[Reputation]] rewards in their respective nations: at reputation level 6 for Mondstadt and Liyue and at reputation level 9 for Inazuma.

<section begin="compassdesc1"/>After forging a compass, equipping it from the inventory and accessing it from its shortcut, an elemental stream will briefly appear directing you towards the nearest chest in the vicinity, entering a 30s cooldown if successful and 5s cooldown if unsuccessful. Head towards the given direction to find the chest. Unlike Oculi Resonance Stones, chest compasses have unlimited uses.<section end="compassdesc1"/>

==Notes==
*Each compass can only be used in the regions they were designed for.
**Occasionally, it can find chests located in neighboring regions if the player is still in the region when the Compass is used but the closest detectable chest is in another region.
*Treasure Compasses cannot be used in climate-affected regions like [[Dragonspine]].
<section begin="compassdesc2" />*If there are no chests in the vicinity, the gadget will enter cooldown for 5 seconds after use. If a chest is found, the gadget will enter cooldown for 30 seconds after use.
*This Gadget cannot be used during combat, while gliding or climbing, while using an alternate sprint (such as [[Mona]]'s [[Illusory Torrent]]), or in domains.
*This Gadget ''cannot'' track chests that spawn from:
**Guiding [[Seelie]] to their Seelie Courts
**Completing [[Time Trial Challenge]]s
**Completing puzzles (such as lighting up [[Elemental Monument]]s and killing enemies that cause a chest to spawn afterwards), unless the chest is visible
**Investigating [[Bloatty Floatty|Bloatty Floatties]] and popping their balloons
**Digging out buried chests
*This Gadget ''can'' track chests that are:
**Hidden behind [[Rock Pile]]s
**Encased in stone
**Wrapped in brambles
**Locked inside [[Shrines of Depths]]
**A [[Bake-Danuki]] in disguise
*The gadget range is not the entire range of the minimap; it is a sphere that has a fixed radius of detection. The radius of detection possibly changes depending on the rarity of the chest.
