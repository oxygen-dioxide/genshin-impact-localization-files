{{Description|"Every building style includes the architect's unique worldview, and from this angle, one can say that the buildings themselves are coalescences of human memories."}}
'''Painted Dome''' is [[Kaveh]]'s [[Elemental Burst]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* DMG dealt by a Dendro Core that prematurely burst due to this skill is calculated in the same way as it would if the Dendro Core had burst normally, i. e. it respects the [[Elemental Mastery]] and % Reaction Bonus (from e. g. the 4-piece set bonus of the [[Flower of Paradise Lost]] [[Artifact]] set) of the character, enemy or environment that triggered the Bloom reaction that created the Dendro Core, which is not necessarily Kaveh himself.
