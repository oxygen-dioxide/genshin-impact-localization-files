==Dialogue==
===Shrine #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Shrine:''' (It looks like an ordinary shrine &mdash; there is a distinct lack of any strange elemental traces.)
:{{DIcon}} Investigate
:'''Shrine:''' (This shrine seems to be in good condition, and appears to have been maintained quite carefully in recent days. The person who did this must be conscientious indeed.)
:'''Shrine:''' (Otherwise, there are no traces of someone having been here.)
:'''Paimon:''' How strange... seems like someone's been here before.

===Shrine #2===
:'''Paimon:''' There's another shrine over there. Let's take a look, shall we?
:'''Shrine:''' (It looks like an ordinary shrine &mdash; there is a distinct lack of any strange elemental traces.)
:{{DIcon}} Investigate
:'''Shrine:''' (This shrine is clean and tidy, and gives off the faint fragrance of the [[Sacred Sakura]]. Someone has prayed here recently.)
:'''Shrine:''' (Otherwise, there are no newer traces.)
:'''Paimon:''' This scent is... the Sacred Sakura's! [[Chouji]]'s mom might have come by this place!
:'''Paimon:''' Pretty recently, too!

===Shrine #3===
:'''Paimon:''' This shrine looks super new! Let's take a closer look at it!
:'''Shrine:''' (It looks like an ordinary shrine &mdash; there is a distinct lack of any strange elemental traces.)
:{{DIcon}} Investigate
:'''Shrine:''' (The wood of this shrine is somewhat old, but skilled maintenance has made it seem less dilapidated in its age and more charming instead.)
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like someone often comes to take care of this shrine.

===Shrine #4===
:'''Paimon:''' There are shrines here too, looks familiar!
:'''Shrine:''' (It looks like an ordinary shrine &mdash; there is a distinct lack of any strange elemental traces.)
:{{DIcon}} Investigate
:'''Shrine:''' (This shrine looks pretty dilapidated. The wooden facade has become pitted and faded, revealing traces of dangerous dark red lines underneath.)
:'''Paimon:''' This shrine is super creepy... Paimon's getting goosebumps...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's get out of here!

===Shrine #5===
:'''Paimon:''' This is probably the shrine that Chouji mentioned, huh?
:'''Shrine:''' (It looks like an ordinary shrine &mdash; there is a distinct lack of any strange elemental traces.)
:{{DIcon}} Investigate
:'''Shrine:''' (The shrine is simple but elegant. Its wood shimmers slightly, greeting guests and their offerings with solemn silence.)
:'''Shrine:''' (Many Sacred Sakura petals lie scattered around this shrine, though it is not a natural scene. Instead, it seems more like someone intentionally scattered the [[Sakura Bloom]]s here.)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh... There aren't any traces here, either.
:{{DIcon}} Look, Sakura Blooms...
:{{DIcon}} It's Chouji's mother's offering...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh right. Chouji mentioned that his mom would present this offering to the shrine!
:'''Paimon:''' There are so many petals here, too... This can't be a coincidence.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go back and tell him!

==Trivia==
* The dialogue of Shrine #5 refers to [[Chouji]] and his [[Chouji's Mother|mother]] even if you haven't talked to him before.
