{{Quest Description|The highlight of Lantern Rite is the release of the giant Mingxiao Lantern into the sky, and this year's Mingxiao Lantern is supposed to be a sight well worth the wait. The Plaustrite that will lift the lantern into the air is the largest in twenty years! For this special occasion, the merchants of Liyue have set up the Xiao Market to help gather the materials needed to build the lantern. When you arrive at the Xiao Market, one of the event organizers, [[Wang'ya]] seems to have something to say to you...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Wang'ya)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hello again, Wang'ya! How's the Mingxiao Lantern construction coming along?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 1 wangya 01.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' Good to see you two! The Mingxiao Lantern is coming along smoothly, thank you. We're almost done collecting the required [[Plaustrite Shard|Plaustrite]].
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 1 wangya 02.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' The project should be completed in a few days... You'll have to come by when it's done!
:{{DIcon}} Plaustrite?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 1 wangya 03.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' Mm-hmm, plaustrite is the main component of any Mingxiao Lantern. Most of the donations we get from the city folk are either Mora or Plaustrite.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 1 wangya 04.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' A lot of them carve their heart's desires onto the Plaustrite they donate, as a prayer for good fortune and other blessings.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon wants some good fortune too! Let's find some Plaustrite and make a wish, {{Traveler}}.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 1 wangya 05.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' Hm, since you seem so eager to donate, how about you keep your eyes open for less common varieties of Plaustrite? Those are the ones we lack the most at the moment.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 1 wangya 06.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' One is called {{Color|buzzword|[[Azurite]]}}. It is occasionally found in the northern part of Mt. Tianheng.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 1 wangya 07.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' When Azurite gets caught in the roots of ordinary vegetation, it sometimes produces {{Color|buzzword|Bloatty Floatties}}, which have floating seeds.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 1 wangya 08.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' The other one is called {{Color|buzzword|[[Vermillionite]]}}, which is extremely dangerous as far as most people are concerned...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 1 wangya 09.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' In Guili Plains, old {{Color|buzzword|Ruin Hunters}} who have lost the power of flight use {{Color|buzzword|Vermillionite}} to keep themselves airborne.
:{{DIcon}} We'll head out to look for those then.
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 1 wangya 10a.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' It's a tall order, but I'm sure you can manage.
:{{DIcon}} What makes them so special?
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 1 wangya 10b_1.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' Well... they're just more stylish, I suppose.
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 1 wangya 10b_2.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' (Actually, they're just blue and red varieties of Plaustrite... Gemstone merchants only gave them fancy names to try and impress their customers...)
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 1 wangya 10b_3.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' Uh, the difference in their features compared to regular Plaustrite might be minuscule... but the difference in price is astonishing.
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 1 wangya 10b_4.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' No, no, never mind that. Just bring some {{Color|buzzword|Azurite}} and {{Color|buzzword|Vermillionite}} back to me. I'm counting on you!

;(Talk to Wang'ya again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj002 wangya 01.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' {{Color|buzzword|Azurite}} is occasionally found in the northern part of Mt. Tianheng.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj002 wangya 02.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' It is said that when Azurite gets caught in the roots of ordinary vegetation, it sometimes produces {{Color|buzzword|Bloatty Floatties}}, which have floating seeds.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj002 wangya 03.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' Perhaps you can start by tracking down {{Color|buzzword|Bloatty Floatties}}. They might lead you to {{Color|buzzword|Azurite}} deposits.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj002 wangya 04.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' And then you can check out Guili Plains, where old {{Color|buzzword|Ruin Hunters}} who have lost the power of flight use {{Color|buzzword|Vermillionite}} to keep themselves airborne.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj002 wangya 05.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' Don't go looking for Ruin Hunters unprepared though, they can be quite deadly.

;(Report back to Wang'ya)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wang'ya, we're back with a fresh supply of Azurite and Vermillionite!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 2 wangya 01.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' I knew I could count on you! Let me see... Hmm... Yep! Without a doubt, these are Azurite and Vermillionite.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 2 wangya 02.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' But don't you want to make your wishes? You brought back just enough materials for both of you. Come on, get carving!
:{{Black Screen|''The Traveler and Paimon carve their wishes on the Azurite and Vermillionite...''}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Done! Paimon prays for a bottomless stomach to eat more delicacies with!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And you? Let Paimon see... Huh? Well, that doesn't sound like something you'd wish for...
:{{DIcon}} That's my {{MC|sister's|brother's|mc=1}} deepest desire.
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 2 paimon 04b_1a.ogg}} {{A|vo eqhdj002 2 paimon 04b_1b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... so you put your {{MC|sister's|brother's|mc=1}} wish rather than your own...
:{{DIcon}} I really hope {{MC|her|his|mc=1}} wish will come true.
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 2 paimon 04a_1a.ogg}} {{A|vo eqhdj002 2 paimon 04a_1b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you made a wish for {{MC|her|him|mc=1}} instead...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 2 paimon 05a.ogg}} {{A|vo eqhdj002 2 paimon 05b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't you worry, Paimon will help you find {{MC|her|him|mc=1}}, and we'll spend the next Lantern Rite together.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then, we'll release a gazillion [[Xiao Lantern]]s to make up for all those wishes you've never had a chance to make!
:{{DIcon}} We sure will.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 2 wangya 03.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' If you're done with your carvings, you can hand over your Azurite and Vermillionite to me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 2 changchang 01.ogg}} '''Changchang:''' Ms. Wang'ya...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 2 wangya 04.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' Well hello, Changchang! What's up, little missy? Can't find your granddad?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 2 changchang 02.ogg}} '''Changchang:''' Granddad said he's busy and I should go play on my own.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 2 changchang 03.ogg}} '''Changchang:''' I wanna make a Xiao Lantern, but I don't know how...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 2 changchang 04.ogg}} '''Changchang:''' Ms. Wang'ya, could you help me make a Xiao Lantern?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 2 wangya 05.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' Sure thing! But promise me that you'll go back home as soon as we're done playing. With so many people at the festival, your granddad will be worried sick if you stay out too long.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 2 changchang 05.ogg}} '''Changchang:''' Hehe. Thank you Ms. Wang'ya! I'll be a good girl, I promise!
:{{DIcon}} So, you know how to make Xiao Lanterns too?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 2 wangya 06.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' I certainly do! That's how I made my first Mora, helping visitors make Xiao Lanterns by the docks. Ah... Good times, hehe!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 2 wangya 07.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' I should really stay here to keep an eye on the girl &mdash; hey, could I bother you to go to the {{Color|buzzword|construction site}} at {{Color|buzzword|the dock}}, and gather some building materials?
:{{DIcon}} Happy to help.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 2 wangya 08.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' Great, thanks. I appreciate it.

;(Talk to Wang'ya or Changchang again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj002 changchang 01.ogg}} '''Changchang:''' Why does it have to be so hard? I'll never learn how to make a Xiao Lantern...
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj002 wangya 06.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' All in good time. Don't give up, practice makes perfect.

;(Approach construction site)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Look over there, That guy's acting very suspicious, don't you think?
;(Talk to the suspicious person)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 3 stupidthief 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Hey, whatcha doin'?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 3 stupidthief 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Whatcha staring at me like that for? Get gone!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 3 stupidthief 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Wha&mdash; Huh?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 3 stupidthief 04.ogg}} '''???:''' ...Alright, if you all won't get gone, I'm just gonna get gone myself I guess...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow. Paimon thought he might be a shady character, then he opened his mouth and now Paimon's sure of it!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He must have been up to something when he was crouching down on the ground. Because as soon as he saw us approaching, he stood up and acted all innocent...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon has a bad feeling about this...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What could he be up to? Let's investigate!
;(Investigate the first item)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This area is full of construction supplies for the Mingxiao Lantern: paper, oil, wood...
;(Investigate the second item)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *gasp* ...All highly flammable materials!
;(Investigate the last item)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' On the final day of the Lantern Rite festival, huge crowds come out to watch the Mingxiao Lantern being released.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It can't be a good sign if there's a suspicious character lurking around somewhere so dangerous.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If he's been tampering with the stockpile of lantern supplies...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's get the materials we came for first. We can tell Wang'ya about the situation when we get back.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, you're taking this very seriously. Why?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Because... Because... Everyone in Liyue has worked really hard for this! No one should be allowed to spoil it, period!
:{{DIcon}} ...What's the real reason?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, fine... There's so many delicacies in Liyue Harbor! Matsutake Meat Rolls, Mora Meat, Almond Tofu...
:{{DIcon}} Are you reading those off a menu?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehehe...
;(Collect the materials)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That should be enough. Let's get back to {{Color|buzzword|Wang'ya}}!
----
;(Talk to Wang'ya)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 7 wangya 01.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' Did you get the materials?
:{{DIcon}} Sure did.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 7 wangya 02.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' Ah, yes! These will do. Let me make a Xiao Lantern for Changchang.
:{{DIcon}} There's more...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We saw a shady character skulking around the highly flammable materials at the construction site!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He looked like he was up to no good...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 7 wangya 03.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' I see... Okay, please inform the {{Color|buzzword|Ministry of Civil Affairs}} about what you saw. I'll talk to Jingming.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 7 wangya 04.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' With so many people visiting for the Lantern Rite, we can't afford to ignore something like this.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj002 changchang 02.ogg}} '''Changchang:''' Miss Wang'ya, is something bad gonna happen at the Lantern Rite?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj002 wangya 07.ogg}} '''Wang'ya:''' Not to a darling little angel like you, Changchang! Come on now, good girl, head back to your granddad and don't get distracted along the way. We don't want to make him worry.

;(Talk to Wang'ya or Changchang again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj002 changchang 02.ogg}} '''Changchang:''' Miss Wang'ya, is something bad gonna happen at the Lantern Rite?

;(Talk to Jiayi)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 8 jiayi 01.ogg}} '''Jiayi:''' Hold up! This is the Liyue Ministry of Civil Affairs.
:{{DIcon}} We are here to report a suspicious individual.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, we saw a shady-looking guy snooping around near the stockpile of highly flammable Mingxiao Lantern supplies!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We must defend the Grilled Tiger Fish food stall at all costs!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 8 jiayi 02.ogg}} '''Jiayi:''' Hmm, goodness! This is a serious matter indeed.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Exactly what Paimon thought! Liyue Harbor's cuisine is the heart and soul of the city&mdash;
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 8 jiayi 03.ogg}} '''Jiayi:''' ...It seems we disagree on where the seriousness of the matter lies. But you're not wrong, my little friend.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 8 jiayi 04.ogg}} '''Jiayi:''' Rest easy, the Ministry of Civil Affairs has assigned a specialist to keep the Lantern Rite safe.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 8 jiayi 05.ogg}} '''Jiayi:''' I will inform him of this matter and order him to step up vigilance in due course.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "In due course"? This is serious, why not get your butt over there and tell him straight away?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 8 jiayi 06.ogg}} '''Jiayi:''' I wish I could, but he's yet to return. He's taken a small team to {{Color|buzzword|Guili Plains}}.
:{{DIcon}} I'll go to Guili Plains and tell them.
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 8 jiayi 07a_1.ogg}} '''Jiayi:''' Huh? Uh... But you're a traveler, aren't you? You've come all this way for the Lantern rite, and yet you're willing to lend a hand...?
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 8 paimon 05a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Our pleasure! We're experts in this kinda stuff. We lend hands all the time, like the time we&mdash;
::{{DIcon}} Ahem, leave it to us.
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 8 jiayi 07a_2.ogg}} '''Jiayi:''' R&mdash;Really? Then we are indebted to you. Travelers are so kind these days...
:{{DIcon}} Another day, another commission...
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 8 jiayi 07b_1.ogg}} '''Jiayi:''' What commission...? Oh, is this your way of offering to go to {{Color|buzzword|Guili Plains}} and pass on the message for me?
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 8 jiayi 07b_2.ogg}} '''Jiayi:''' But you're a traveler, aren't you? You've come all this way for the Lantern Rite, and yet you're willing to lend a hand...
::{{DIcon}} The food stalls must be protected!
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 8 paimon 05b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! We must defend the food stalls! Let nobody touch them!
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 8 jiayi 07b_3.ogg}} '''Jiayi:''' Uh &mdash; absolutely! Haha... I can't thank you enough.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 8 jiayi 08.ogg}} '''Jiayi:''' Ah yes, no commission should go unpaid...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 8 jiayi 09.ogg}} '''Jiayi:''' I will take care of the compensation. Again, thank you both.

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's a hilichurl blockade, there's so many of them.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why would they gather together like this...?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We can't let them get away with being a menace to the people here. Let's show 'em what we've got!

;(After clearing the obstacles)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 xinghuo 01.ogg}} '''Xinghuo:''' Wh&mdash;Who are you?
:{{DIcon}} Jiayi sent us.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 xinghuo 02.ogg}} '''Xinghuo:''' Oh... Thank you. If it weren't for your help, today may have ended quite differently.
:{{DIcon}} What is it you're doing here?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 xinghuo 03.ogg}} '''Xinghuo:''' I'm in charge of keeping the Lantern Rite safe. A lot comes out of the woodwork at this time of the year, there are thieves around every corner.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 xinghuo 04.ogg}} '''Xinghuo:''' I encountered one during my patrol just now, so I called a few men and we pursued them out here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 xinghuo 05.ogg}} '''Xinghuo:''' Once we got here, we decided to split up. I was searching this area.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 xinghuo 06.ogg}} '''Xinghuo:''' The thief seems to have made a clean getaway, and I sure didn't bank on these monsters being here...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 xinghuo 07.ogg}} '''Xinghuo:''' I was just assessing whether it would be better to send for reinforcements, or find another way to disperse them... And that's when you showed up and dealt with them.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 xinghuo 08.ogg}} '''Xinghuo:''' *sigh* And thank goodness. I don't know how long it would have taken for the others to get here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 xinghuo 09.ogg}} '''Xinghuo:''' Well, I need to get back for looking for the thief... But thanks for your help. Until next time...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait a second! We're not done here!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 xinghuo 10.ogg}} '''Xinghuo:''' Oh? is there something else?
:{{DIcon}} There's a suspicious character down at the harbor...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 xinghuo 11.ogg}} '''Xinghuo:''' Ugh, another one? *sigh* It's interminable...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 xinghuo 12.ogg}} '''Xinghuo:''' Right, when I get back, I'll get the other troops to be extra vigilant in the area.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 xinghuo 13.ogg}} '''Xinghuo:''' *sigh* In the middle of the festival too. What are they up to...
;(Xinghuo leaves)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you get the feeling...
:{{DIcon}} That the Ministry of Civil Affairs isn't up to the task?
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 paimon 03a_1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks so too!
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 paimon 03a_2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The locals must take all their tasty treats for granted by now.
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 paimon 03a_3.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But for a poor traveler, all alone out in the wilderness, often forced to survive on nothing but the most mysterious of mushrooms...
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 paimon 03a_4.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' For you, the Lantern Rite is the most important of all festivals!
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps we should take this into our own hands.
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 paimon 03b_1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks so too!
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 paimon 03b_2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' With our wealth of experience adventuring far and wide, we should be able to get to the bottom of this.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So let's go back to the place where we {{Color|buzzword|witnessed the shady-looking guy}}.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon hears from patrol officers that criminals love to go back for another look at the crime scene after the event. Eh, it's a psychological thing, apparently.
:{{DIcon}} But the crime hasn't even happened yet...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 11 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's why there's no time to lose! When there's highly flammable materials involved, once the crime happens it'll be too late!

:{{A|vo eqhdj002 12 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I have no interest in Lantern Rite.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 12 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I sensed a malign influence here. I'm here to investigate.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 12 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' When a shackle is loosened in the realms of deities and demons, I take full responsibility.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 12 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' But this time, the threat comes from the mortal world &mdash; your world. Thus you shall take full responsibility, mortal traveler.

:{{A|vo eqhdj002 12 xiao 07.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I do not wish for the tassel of the polearm that has slaughtered countless demons to become stained with mortal blood.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 12 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's this?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 12 xiao 08.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' A symbol that your suspected evildoer left behind.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, do you recognize it?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 12 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Doesn't look familiar to Paimon.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 12 xiao 09.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Well, you will have to show me how much you can accomplish on your own strength.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 12 xiao 10.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Because if I become involved, there is a possibility that the streets of Liyue Harbor will be painted red this Lantern Rite.
:{{DIcon}} Then it's up to me to avoid that...
:{{DIcon}} Actually, quite a festive color in this part of the world...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 12 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That sounds terrible!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 12 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh, let's not be impulsive. Why don't we figure out the origins of this symbol first?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 12 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The one the suspected criminal left behind...Oh!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 12 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon has a sneaking suspicion that Kaeya will know something about it...

;(Talk to Kaeya)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Well, well, long time no see, {{Traveler}}!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kaeya, we went to the Lantern Rite in Liyue!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Ah. Well, how was it? Fun?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Delicious!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Well then, you ought to be looking forward to Mondstadt's [[Ludi Harpastum]]. I'm sure it will be to your liking.
:{{DIcon}} Get to the point, Paimon.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right, right! Kaeya, there's something we need to tell you about.
:{{Black Screen|''The Traveler relates what they have seen...''}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hmm... Lantern supplies... Stockpile of wood, paper, and oil... At the very least, it sounds like an accident waiting to happen.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Haha, how very amusing. What makes you think I would recognize this symbol?
:{{DIcon}} You're amazing at everything and we trust you.
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 paimon 04a_1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that about sums it up!
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 kaeya 06a_1.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hah. I'm flattered, but don't you think you might be overestimating me?
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 paimon 04a_2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There it is! At last, Kaeya displays the knightly virtue of modesty, perfectly articulated and masterfully delivered.
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 kaeya 06a_2.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' My goodness, your stay in Liyue seems to have sharpened your wit and broadened your vocabulary.
:{{DIcon}} You flirt with the dark side, so you would know.
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 paimon 04b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Exactly!
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 kaeya 06b_1.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Uh-ah! You should watch what you say, Honorary Knight.
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 kaeya 06b_2.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' What do you mean, flirt with the dark side? The Knights of Favonius certainly does not have dealings with its enemies.
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 kaeya 06b_3.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' That has to do with a certain knightly virtue called "integrity."
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 kaeya 07.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Anyway, I digress. This is the symbol of the cross-border criminal organization you know as the Treasure Hoarders.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 kaeya 08.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' If you are curious to know more, I can put you in touch with an informant on the inside.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh, didn't you just say the Knights of Favonius don't have dealings with their enemies!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 kaeya 09.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' ...This is my own personal informant. Nothing to do with the Knights of Favonius.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 kaeya 10.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' A little later, make your way over to Windrise. I'll arrange for the informant to meet you there.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thanks, Kaeya.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 kaeya 11.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Oh, and remember: "wine begets wisdom."
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 13 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?

;(Talk to Nimrod)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 nimrod 01.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' Huh...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! You're the guy, right? Kaeya's informant?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 nimrod 02.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' Informant? Not me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But... This is the place we agreed upon... and you're the only one here, so...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 nimrod 03.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' "Place we agreed upon"? Heh, I know nothing.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, stop being so annoying!
:{{DIcon}} Wine begets wisdom.
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 nimrod 04a.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' Okay. Yeah, it's me.
:{{DIcon}} Something about... wine?
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 nimrod 04b_1.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' Uh...
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 paimon 04b_1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 nimrod 04b_2.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' Okay... technically the wrong password, but... yes, it's something about wine, and assuming that something is the thing about it begetting wisdom, then...
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 nimrod 04b_3.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' Yeah, close enough. It's me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 paimon 04a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How was any of that even slightly necessary!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 nimrod 05.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' What do you want to know about?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* Here's the situation...
:{{Black Screen|''The Traveler and Paimon start to question Nimrod...''}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 nimrod 06.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' Okay. I see.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So? What can you tell us as an insider?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 nimrod 07.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' I do not think this is the work of the Treasure Hoarders.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 nimrod 08.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' The reason the Treasure Hoarders are able to sustain a giant cross-border operation is because they are able to abide by one fundamental principle:
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 nimrod 09.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' Caution. Softly softly catchee monkey is the name of the game for them. By contrast, the idea of taking huge risks to try and make a fortune is utter folly in their eyes.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 nimrod 10.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' Liyue has the adepti looking after it, doesn't it? And they're especially active during the Lantern Rite...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 nimrod 11.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' There's just no way that we... sorry, "they"! Slip of the tongue &mdash; when you've been undercover as long as I have, heh, where was I... Oh, yes &mdash; There's just no way that they &mdash; the Treasure Hoarders &mdash; would dare make a move during the Lantern Rite.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 nimrod 12.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' Also, the Treasure Hoarders' organization in Liyue recently received an anonymous letter.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why would someone send them an anonymous letter? Trying to frame them, perhaps?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 nimrod 13.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' Nobody knows. But what I can tell you is which branch of the Treasure Hoarders has the letter in their possession.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 nimrod 14.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' ...There. I've marked their location on the map for you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great. Well, Paimon thinks this was productive! {{Traveler}}, this is our only solid lead. Let's not waste it!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 14 nimrod 15.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' If there's nothing more, I should get back to treasure hoarding. ...I mean, get back to those treasure-hoarding lowlifes. To spy on them, Heh.

;(Talk to Bei'er)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 15 beier 01.ogg}} '''Bei'er:''' Sorry mate, wrong way. Wherever you think you're going, it's that way.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 15 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But isn't that the way to Liyue Harbor?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 15 beier 02.ogg}} '''Bei'er:''' Right. Here is nowhere. So the other way is Liyue Harbor.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 15 crafty 01.ogg}} '''Crafty:''' If you're looking for somewhere to stay, I suggest you go to the Wangshu Inn. Fair prices, great customer service, and a wonderful view.
:{{DIcon}} Show us the anonymous letter.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 15 beier 03.ogg}} '''Bei'er:''' ...How do you know about the letter?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 15 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Uh, one of Liyue's adepti told us about it!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 15 beier 04.ogg}} '''Bei'er:''' Did they now? I somehow doubt that.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 15 xiao 01.ogg}} '''???:''' You should not doubt it. It was I who sent them to investigate.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 15 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Any further questioning, you may direct to me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 15 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Argh! Did you just appear out of thin air!?
:{{DIcon}} That's an adeptus for you...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 15 beier 05.ogg}} '''Bei'er:''' ...You're the Vigilant Yaksha!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 15 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, watch your tone of voice! Or do you seriously wanna pick a fight with an adeptus?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 15 crafty 02.ogg}} '''Crafty:''' Uh, okay. It's not that we don't believe you're an adeptus, it's just... Everyone needs to look at the bigger picture here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 15 beier 06.ogg}} '''Bei'er:''' As you well know, we Treasure Hoarders are no serious threat to anyone. We're petty criminals, that's all.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 15 crafty 03.ogg}} '''Crafty:''' So if you are truly an adeptus, please... Show us some mercy, would you?
:;(They draw their swords)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 15 beier 07.ogg}} '''Bei'er:''' Of course, if it turns out you're not a real adeptus...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 15 crafty 04.ogg}} '''Crafty:''' Then please, don't blame our weapons for treating everyone equally...

;(After defeating them)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 beier 01.ogg}} '''Bei'er:''' Please, oh great one! Heroic Yaksha of Liyue! Divine Adeptus and friend of the people! Have mercy!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 crafty 01.ogg}} '''Crafty:''' The letter is drivel anyway! It's not worth an armed conflict... Just take it!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How about that &mdash; Paimon knew it all along!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's see what they wrote.

:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I see. Then let us send these two to the meeting.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' The sender may be plotting something truly diabolic for the Lantern Rite. It seems they want to burn down the entire city.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 beier 02.ogg}} '''Bei'er:''' Great, everyone's happy. You're good, we're good. However...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 crafty 02.ogg}} '''Crafty:''' These two... They don't look anything like us.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It'll be fine. When we're in disguise, no-one will be the wiser.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 beier 03.ogg}} '''Bei'er:''' It still seems like a long shot to me, but... with the help of an adeptus, hopefully everything will turn out fine...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 crafty 03.ogg}} '''Crafty:''' Well, the safety of Liyue is in your hands now. Good luck &mdash; even the Treasure Hoarders don't want to see the city burned to the ground.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Then it is settled.
:{{DIcon}} Wait!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' *sigh* What is it?
:{{DIcon}} Next time we meet...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Huh?
:{{DIcon}} Let's make it somewhere with a view of the Mingxiao Lantern.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...I am not partial to crowded areas. Especially at this time of the year.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 xiao 07.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' When this matter is resolved... come to Wangshu Inn.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 xiao 08.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' In previous years, the Mingxiao Lantern has been visible even from there.
:;(Xiao vanishes)
:{{DIcon}} Huh!? Wait...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He's... vanished. Did he go back to Wangshu Inn already...?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But the time mentioned in the letter, that's today, isn't it?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Come on, let's go to the {{Color|buzzword|meeting place}}.

;(After cutscene)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon wonders what the sender of the letter is planning...
----
;(Approach the sender)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 stupidthief 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Alright, you folks from the Treasure Hoarders, yeah? I thought I insinuated in my letter there that you should have done like I done and put on a mask and a costume and so forth...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 stupidthief 02.ogg}} '''???:''' ...But seems you didn't all get the memo. Hehehe... it's pretty cool though... gutsy.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmph! Well guess what? We don't need to go sneaking around everywhere wearing disguises! Because unlike you, we would never do anything so shameful that we would need to wear masks while doing it!
:;(Camera pans to the Traveler wearing a mask)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really!? I was in the middle of my speech and everything!
:{{DIcon}} I think he just enjoys dressing up...
:{{DIcon}} This get up is pretty cool, though...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 16 stupidthief 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Wait a second now... You folks ain't no Treasure Hoarders! What game are you two playing!?

;(After defeating the suspicious person)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Tell us your diabolical plan, now! It's over, buster!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 stupidthief 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Okay! I give up!

:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 stupidthief 02.ogg}} '''???:''' I, uh... I'm just a lowly apprentice thief who really looks up to the Treasure Hoarders...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' An apprentice thief!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 stupidthief 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Yeah... For a greenhorn like me, 'specially working on my own an' all... The Treasure Hoarders? Man, they're my heroes...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait a second, so&mdash;
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 stupidthief 04.ogg}} '''???:''' ...So, I thought I'd try and set up some sorta lucrative opportunity, then submit my pledge of loyalty...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait a second! None of this is making any sense!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon was expecting a serial arsonist to be someone more... sinister! Evil-looking! But instead... We get you!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 stupidthief 05.ogg}} '''???:''' ...Arson? What the heck are you talking about?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't pretend! Paimon's seen you, loitering around piles of highly flammable materials!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 stupidthief 06.ogg}} '''???:''' Oh... Oh yeah, yeah, I know what you're talkin' about. But I was only checking the place out.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 stupidthief 07.ogg}} '''???:''' My plan ain't got nothing to do with those lantern construction materials.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Are you serious!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 stupidthief 08.ogg}} '''???:''' I just wanted to nab me the biggest chunk of Plaustrite in twenty years is all...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 stupidthief 09.ogg}} '''???:''' I was gonna wait till nightfall, chop of half the tethers, float it out to sea...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 stupidthief 10.ogg}} '''???:''' Then all I'd have to do is find some way or another of bringing it down, so I could hide it underwater in the shallows. The perfect crime!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh, for a perfect crime, it sure has a lot of holes... For example, how exactly were you planning to bring down the Plaustrite once it was airborne?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 stupidthief 11.ogg}} '''???:''' I was still in the process of figuring out the details, hence why I hadn't made my move yet.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This guy is an imbecile!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, {{Traveler}}, let's teach him a lesson.
:{{Black Screen|''The Traveler hands the stupid thief over to the Millelith...''}}

;(Talk to Jiayi)
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 jiayi 01.ogg}} '''Jiayi:''' Traveler, word spreads fast! We will keep watch over the thief, thanks for your help.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 jiayi 02.ogg}} '''Jiayi:''' Looks like the Mingxiao Lantern will be ready soon. A critical juncture, we can not afford the slightest influence.
:{{DIcon}} On the topic of keeping Lantern Rite safe...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 jiayi 03.ogg}} '''Jiayi:''' Rest easy, word was passed up the chain. Another group of very capable troops has been brought in.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 jiayi 04.ogg}} '''Jiayi:''' They're dressed as ordinary citizens, you wouldn't notice them in the crowd. If anyone dares to make a move, they'll be on them in an instant.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 jiayi 05.ogg}} '''Jiayi:''' That's sorted then. You two get some rest, we'll take it from here. Enjoy Lantern Rite in peace!
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... Paimon supposes that's taken care of, then.
:{{DIcon}} If only Xiao were here to see the Mingxiao Lantern.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* Paimon wishes so too, guess he won't make it this time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, do you remember what the inspiration for the Mingxiao lantern was?
:{{DIcon}} An adeptus...
::{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 paimon 18a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, with a name like... Skybracer, or something.
:{{DIcon}} Skybracer sounds right...
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So if it's modeled on an adeptus, maybe Xiao would be interested this time?
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' On the day the Mingxiao lantern is ready, we can meet him at {{Color|buzzword|Wangshu Inn}} like he suggested, then try to persuade him.
:{{A|vo eqhdj002 17 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Even though he said you can see the Mingxiao Lantern from Wangshu Inn... We should get up close if we wanna get that festival atmosphere.
