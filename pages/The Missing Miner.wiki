==Steps==
Start this quest by interacting with the "Work Handbook" inside a tree log in the [[Underground Waterway]].
# Collect "mushroom meat" together with [[Uncle He]]
# Defeat the Floating Fungi
# Bring Uncle He back to camp to meet [[Jinwu]]

==Gameplay Notes==
* Talking to Uncle He after reading the Work Handbook grants the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement ''[[Not for Long-Term Consumption]]''.
* Talking to Jinwu before Khedive shows up in the camp will cause the quest to end prematurely. See dialogue section for details.

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Uncle He refuses to leave without his mushroom meat. Well, guess you've got to help him collect some if you want to bring him back to the campsite...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Read the Work Handbook)
:'''Work Handbook:''' (A miner's log, with the name "He" on its cover &mdash; probably the name of the owner.)
:'''Work Handbook:''' (On the first few pages, it reads:)
:'''Work Handbook:''' "[[Qi Ding|Qi Ding's]] been looking for his [[Qi Nan|daughter's]] toy, but it's nowhere to be found. Lemme go deeper into the mine and see if I can find it for him..."
:'''Work Handbook:''' "...There's an itching in my ears..."
:'''Work Handbook:''' "...It's so itchy, like bugs in my ears... Ugh, it just won't give me a rest. I'm gonna run out of food soon. According to that voice, I... Huh. But is this mushroom really edible?"
:'''Work Handbook:''' On the following pages, it reads: "I can hear it. Hee-hee, mushroom meat... hee-hee... mushroom meat. So delicious... Hahaha, mushroom meat..."

:'''You suddenly hear whispering coming from behind you:<br />"Hee-hee... mushroom meat... Hee-hee..."'''

:'''???:''' You... Hee-hee, what are you doing here?
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! This guy looks terrible!
:'''Paimon:''' And he just popped up without making a single noise, (Traveler)...
:'''Paimon:''' Could he be...
:{{DIcon}} Probably not.
:'''???:''' Hee-hee, wh&mdash;why are you here?
:'''???:''' Have you run out of food as well?
:{{DIcon}} Are you Uncle He?
:'''???:''' Huh... Huh? Youngster, what are you saying? I can't hear you.
:'''Paimon:''' I'm asking if you are Uncle He!
:'''Uncle He:''' Oooh, yes. Hee-hee, that's me-hee-hee.
:'''Uncle He:''' Are you also trapped here like me? Did you run out of food too? *sigh* ... How unlucky.
:'''Uncle He:''' Hee-hee, but no worries. I've got some food here... You must be famished... Hee-hee...
:'''Paimon:''' Now that topic's making Paimon's tummy grumble.
:{{DIcon}} This "mushroom meat" stuff looks very suspicious!
:{{DIcon}} Don't just chow on whatever suspicious stuff you find!
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... You're right. He seems a bit cooked in the head, and what's with that strange complexion? Paimon bets it has to do with the mushroom meat!
:'''Uncle He:''' Mushroom meat? Hee-hee, yes, it's delicious!
:'''Uncle He:''' Here, would you like some?
:'''Uncle He:''' Hahaha, how do you like it? Mm... What&mdash;
:'''Paimon:''' What's the matter?
:'''Uncle He:''' The mushroom meat is gone!
:'''Paimon:''' ...Y'know what? Forget it, let's go back to the camp now!
:'''Uncle He:''' I'm not going! I've run out of mushroom meat!
:'''Uncle He:''' Without it, I won't even have the strength to walk. I'm not going anywhere... No mushroom meat... and no food anywhere else.
:'''Uncle He:''' But with mushroom meat, I can go anywhere!
:'''Paimon:''' Then, where can we find you some?
:'''Uncle He:''' Mushroom meat... Oh, hee-hee, I know where it is. Lemme find some for us. Let's fill our tummies and then we'll have the strength to work!
:'''Uncle He:''' It should be around here...
:'''Paimon:''' Well, (Traveler), Paimon guesses we can only do as he says.
:{{DIcon}} This does seem to be the only option now.
:'''Uncle He:''' Mushroom meat... Hee-hee... big mushroom meat...

;(After picking up a starshroom)
:'''Uncle He:''' Ye, yes, these are the mushrooms we want... Take a few more, yes! Hehe...

;(After picking up 4 starshrooms)
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? What happened? Why are there so many mushroom creatures around us?
:'''Uncle He:''' Hehehe, mushroom creatures, mushroom meat! Delicious! Hehehe...
:'''Paimon:''' How does this count as mushroom meat!?

;(After defeating several Floating Fungi, more keep coming)
:'''Paimon:''' This is bad. There's no end to these Floating Fungi...
:'''Uncle He:''' Mushroom creatures... Hehe, wonderful!

;(After defeating the Floating Fungi)
:'''Paimon:''' He took them all out in a whoosh!
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! So strong!
:'''Uncle He:''' Hee-hee... Mushroom meat, mushroom meat...
:'''Uncle He:''' Ever since I started eating mushroom meat, my lower back pain left me and I got more strength. Hee-hee, it's like I've grown a few years younger!
:'''Uncle He:''' And mushroom creatures are more delicious than mushroom meat! The bigger, the tastier... Hee-hee...
:'''Paimon:''' Could it be that Uncle He got so strong from eating mushroom meat?
:'''Paimon:''' (Traveler), since it might grant us more power, why don't we give it a whirl?
:{{DIcon}} You sure it's "more power" that you're after, huh?
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon just wants to see how it tastes!
:{{DIcon}} Please be less creative with your diet!
::'''Paimon:''' Oh, alright, Paimon gets it...
:'''Paimon:''' But back on topic, Uncle He should be fine with following us back now, right?
:'''Uncle He:''' Mushroom meat... Hee-hee, yummy!
:'''Paimon:''' Uncle He, let's go back to the camp together!
:'''Uncle He:''' Huh? "Together"? Sure, let's have the mushroom meat together. Hee-hee, air-dried mushroom meat can be stored for a long, long time...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon means we're going back to the camp together!
:'''Uncle He:''' The "damp"? What got damp? Oh, what does it matter? I'm fine with it... Hee-hee, now that I've eaten mushroom meat, damp or dry, I can go anywhere!
:'''Paimon:''' *sigh*
:'''Paimon:''' (Traveler), let's bring Uncle He back to see Jinwu.
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|Now that he has had his mushroom meat, Uncle He is satisfied. Time to bring him back to camp...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Jinwu)
:'''Uncle He:''' Mushroom meat... Hee-hee... A mushroom meal in my tummy, small mushrooms, mushroom creatures, big mushrooms... Hee-hee...
:'''Jinwu:''' Uncle He? What's happened to your face?
:'''Jinwu:''' *sigh*... I knew you were alive! To think that your family even invited me to your funeral! I refused to go, you know. Told them that nothing was certain yet without a body.
:'''Jinwu:''' Look at your face. It must've been tough for you, being trapped in the mine like that. But anyway, I'm glad that you're still alive!
:'''Uncle He:''' Being alive is good, yes! Living, breathing mushrooms are delicious! Hee-hee...
:'''Jinwu:''' Uncle He?
:'''Paimon:''' He was like this when we found him.
:'''Paimon:''' He wasn't quite all there... and he kept saying that he wanted to eat mushrooms.
:'''Jinwu:''' Mushrooms...
:'''Jinwu:''' The Chasm is a dangerous place for ordinary people. Plants and fungi growing here could also be harmful to the human body. That's why [[Huishan Hall]] has set strict rules against eating these things.
:'''Jinwu:''' But Uncle He's been trapped down here all these years with nothing else to eat.
:'''Jinwu:''' How am I supposed to face his family with him in this state?
:{{DIcon}} Speaking of mushrooms...
:{{DIcon}} Do you know anyone who does research on mushrooms?
:'''Jinwu:''' Now that you mention it, Khedive might be able to help. After all, he's a scholar from Sumeru. He must've conducted some research on mushrooms.
;(If Khedive is at the surface camp)
::{{DIcon}} About Khedive...
::'''Jinwu:''' He's still in the camp above. He said he wanted to organize his research materials and bring them down here...
::'''Jinwu:''' We'll just have to wait till then to ask him about the situation.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon hopes that Uncle He will recover.
::'''Jinwu:''' He's a veteran miner, and an agile one, too. He took very good care of youngsters who were new in the mine.
::'''Jinwu:''' When he went missing a few years back, everyone wondered why Rex Lapis didn't protect him. A good man's life shouldn't have ended that way, they said.
::'''Jinwu:''' I'm sure everyone'll be elated to see him recover and return.
::'''Jinwu:''' (Traveler), you have my thanks. Once [[Khedive]] is done checking on Uncle He, I'll get him out of The Chasm &mdash; I will, whatever happens.
::'''Jinwu:''' Thank you so much. I really don't know how I can repay you.
:;(Quest ends)
:'''Jinwu:''' Please wait here. I'll bring him over to check up on Uncle He.
;(Jinwu goes to get Khedive)
:'''Uncle He:''' Mushroom meat... mushroom meat...
:'''Paimon:''' *sigh* With how messed up Uncle He is, Paimon's really not sure if he can recover.
:'''Paimon:''' If he goes back to his family like this, they'll still be pretty saddened...
;(Jinwu returns with Khedive)
:'''Khedive:''' You can't just kidnap me here while I was halfway through my report, Jinwu! I know you're in charge of the team's safety, but you can't just disturb my research like that...
:'''Khedive:''' I'm seriously considering cutting your budget as they proposed.
:'''Jinwu:''' Never mind the budget.
:'''Jinwu:''' Please check on this man here...
:'''Uncle He:''' It's itchy inside my earsies... Hee-hee...
:'''Khedive:''' Huh? Who is he? And why does he look like that?
:'''Khedive:''' Did you find him, (Traveler)? ...Seriously, how are you always able to stumble upon such peculiar events...
:'''Khedive:''' Then... How was he like when you found him?

:'''You tell Khedive what happened to Uncle He...<br />Khedive performs a careful examination on him.'''

:'''Khedive:''' He's fine. It's not a big deal.
:'''Khedive:''' You know how he always complains about the itchiness in his ears? That's because the spores of the fungi have entered his ears.
:'''Khedive:''' Although long-term consumption of this type of fungus &mdash; I mean, mushroom &mdash; does impair one's sanity, it doesn't hurt the body.
:'''Jinwu:''' So you're saying he can recover?
:'''Khedive:''' I've already cleared his body of the fungi and made some medicine to treat his neurological disorder.
:'''Khedive:''' He's very likely to recover if given ample rest.
:'''Jinwu:''' I see. Then, about the cost of the medicine...
:'''Khedive:''' None of the ingredients are expensive &mdash; they're only worth a month's meals at [[Xinyue Kiosk]]. It's not a big deal.
:'''Jinwu:''' Uh... I&mdash;I'll figure out some way to repay you...
:'''Khedive:''' No need to repay me &mdash; as a matter of fact, this incident gives me something new to write in my report.
:'''Khedive:''' Ever since I came across these peculiar mushrooms in The Chasm, I've been curious about the long-term consequences of eating them, but I haven't found a willing assistant yet.
:{{DIcon}} An assistant?
::'''Khedive:''' I mean, someone whose responsibility is to eat the mushrooms. Everyone seems to have reservations. Although they know that no great harm will come to them, they just don't dare  to eat the things.
:{{DIcon}} "Test subject" is more the word, don't you think?
::'''Khedive:''' You can say that, but we've studied these mushrooms and come to the conclusion that they won't cause any irreversible damage to either the body or the mind.
:'''Khedive:''' But... given how peculiar The Chasm is, the environment here could be another reason for his symptoms. Anyway, just have him take the medicine and get some rest. He's very likely to recover, even now.
:'''Jinwu:''' What a relief... I'll bring him up to the surface later.
:'''Jinwu:''' Once he's recovered, I'll bring him home and inform his friends as well.
:'''Jinwu:''' He's a veteran miner, and an agile one, too. He took very good care of youngsters who were new in the mine.
:'''Jinwu:''' When he went missing a few years back, everyone wondered why Rex Lapis didn't protect him. A good man's life shouldn't have ended that way, they said.
:'''Jinwu:''' I'm sure his friends will be much comforted by the news that he's back.
;(Quest ends)

;(Talk to Uncle He again)
:'''Uncle He:''' My ears aren't itchy anymore... But...
:'''Uncle He:''' Mushroom meat, *sigh*, where can I find more?

;(Talk to Uncle He and Tang Wuchou at [[Cinnabar Cliff]])
:'''Uncle He:''' You Treasure Hoarder dreg... *pants* If I wasn't so exhausted from lacking any... mushrooms to eat lately...
:'''Uncle He:''' I would have beaten you black and blue already!
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' You old thief! How dare you call my Glaze L... I mean, Qingxin! How dare you call them mushrooms and just... pick and eat them!
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' *cough* By what right do you get to do that?
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, why are you two fighting?
:'''Uncle He:''' I-I was looking for mushroom-meat! Haha, yes, mushroom-meat! But they wouldn't let me back into the mines, no! So I-I came here looking for some.
:'''Uncle He:''' And after searching and searching, I finally found that there were mushrooms here! But just as I was reaching for them, this cad attacked me out of nowhere!
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' Hah! A cad? He's the one who violated our Guhua training grounds! And what's more, these flowers belong to me... and the heroic (Traveler)...
:'''Paimon:''' And the heroic Paimon!
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' Yes, and the heroic Paimon! Other than the three of us, none may touch these sacred grounds!
:'''Uncle He:''' Treasure hoarder dreg!
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' Scandalous old crook!
:'''Paimon:''' Okay, okay Uncle He, Tang Wuchou has stopped being a Treasure Hoarder already. Also, the stuff he planted are flowers, not mushrooms.
:'''Uncle He:''' Eh? Is that so?
:'''Paimon:''' C'mon, have a closer look. These are Qingxin for sure!
:'''Uncle He:''' Ah! Indeed, they are Qingxin! It appers that I'm still a little dizzy...
:'''Paimon:''' And you, Tang Wuchou, are you seriously still dreaming of growing that "great Glaze Lily garden" of yours?
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' Well, it would be a most beautiful sight to see, wouldn't you say?
:'''Paimon:''' Whatever the problem is, stop fighting!
:'''Uncle He:''' *sigh* No mushrooms. Goodbye, I go.
:'''Claims to be "Tang Wuchou":''' Now that that troublesome old geezer is gone, I can finally look into planting some flowers...
