==Lore==
Chenyu Vale is a place includes many mountains and streams. It's also famous for its tea products.

The name of Chenyu Vale may comes from a famous story happened in this area : a priceless gem was thrown and sunk into the water in order to stop it from felling into the hands of a demon.

A very long time ago, there was no ford across a river in Chenyu Vale, only a misty hillside. Someone planted a tea tree when the owner of the mountain had yet to decide what to plan here. At first, the owner of the mountain complained. After a long time, she returned, but she lost her fingers.

Later, the tree's branches were grafted to the other side of the river. Chenyu Vale's tea traveled to [[Liyue Harbor]]. Then, it traveled to many more places.

A legend says that this sort of tea tree only grows lushly in Chenyu Vale, no matter the waters, soil, or sunlight.
