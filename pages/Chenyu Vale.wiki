Chenyu Vale refers to the area surrounding Mt. Yaojun,<ref name="Baizhu5">{{Ref/CS|Baizhu|Character Story 5}}</ref> a sacred mountain which was once under the dominion of an [[adeptus]] known as the "[[Herblord]]," who once took the form of a young lady.<ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Echoes of an Offering|quote='''Soulscent Bloom:''' This one left behind the ambiguous name of "Herblord," as well as many foggy and fragmented legends. [...]<br>There is even a story that goes like this&mdash;<br>The young lady grasped at the hooded hat on the ground as she struggled ashore, placing it on her head haphazardly.<br>'''Jade Leaf:''' But though the young lady who was master of this mountain complained, she too could imagine the tea's fragrance.}}</ref> While Chenyu Vale is described as having "many mountains [and] rivers" in [[Flowing Rings]]' description, [[Jade Leaf]]'s description only mentions a single river; regardless, this water source is likely the reason why Chenyu Vale's climate is "relatively humid" compared to the [[Hills of Barsom]].<ref name="AAD">{{Ref/Quest|An Artist Adrift (Part 1)}}</ref>

According to legend, the Herblord's friend, another adeptus, planted a particular tea tree here. When the tree was still a sapling, someone tied a jade ornament to it; later on, when the Herblord returned to the mountains in a changed form, she no longer had the fingers to untie this ornament, while her friend had sunk to the bottom of the ocean.<ref name="Baizhu5" /> Many years after, the tree's branches were grafted to the "other side of the river" by people who lived on the mountain, and its tea leaves became famous in [[Liyue Harbor]] and other areas. However, this type of tea tree is said to only grow well in Chenyu Vale because it remembers the promise between two friends.<ref name="Jade Leaf">{{Ref/Arti|Jade Leaf}}</ref>

There is another legend that claims the Herblord's adeptal form turned into the branches of an ancient tea tree, and one in which the Herblord ascended to an "adeptal mountain."<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Soulscent Bloom}}</ref> These legends currently cannot be verified, although the former appears to be a more fantastical interpretation of the tea tree legend mentioned in the previous paragraph.

In reality, during the [[Archon War]], an unnamed goddess ruled over Chenyu Vale and was at war with [[Morax]]; the Herblord and the other adeptus, known as [[Fujin]], served under her. The war was incredibly bloody, as the [[Bishui River]] was crimson red from all the fighting between the two factions. The people who lived there at the time did not participate in the war, so to protect them, Fujin and the Herblord created sanctuaries to protect them from the god's other followers. Near the end of the war, in a final attempt to defeat Morax, the goddess planned to flood the Bishui River, which would've also destroyed the vale and its people. Seeing this, the Herblord and Fujin rebelled against her, taking on the forms of a giant white snake and carp. The Herblord fought the god, [[Lingyuan]] evacuated the people and Fujin threw the Votive Rainjade into the waters, creating the [[Jademouth]] in the process. The Herblord was greatly diminished after fighting the god, while Fujin lost many of her powers and "sank into the sea," losing much of her strength.

Various interpretations and stories exist regarding a famous Chenyu Vale legend involving a slab of jade located on a sacred mountain, which was capable of summoning "sweet rains" and became coveted by demons, after which it was thrown into the river and sank underwater<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Flowing Rings}}</ref> &mdash; which likely led to the name "Chenyu," meaning "Jade-Sinking." In other tales, the Herblord split the jade into several ornaments and hid them in various places, including underwater, in the mountains, and in shrines. These ornaments are believed to carry the blessings from a pact with a deity, and a particular priest inherited a jade loop which had been passed down from their ancestors who had made that pact; artisans at Yilong Port also make jade ornaments to this day because of these legends.<ref name="Symbol of Felicitation">{{Ref/Arti|Symbol of Felicitation}}</ref>

Many present-day inhabitants of Chenyu Vale are the descendants of refugees who fled the Chasm during the events of the cataclysm. [[Yelan]] and [[Lan Yan]]'s ancestors are among them.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Qimen Arts and the Rite of Homa, the Spirits are Calmed and Life Restored}}</ref> 

In the present, Lingyuan, yearning for the days of old, began to tamper with the vale's spirit lines, causing the soil and water to become "tainted", contaminating [[Qiaoying Village]]'s tea supply with an inferior quality. This also caused [[miasma]] to erupt across several places around the vale, which was an unintended consequence. Fujin, learning of the taint, discovers the [[Traveler]] when they stepped foot in the vale and asks them to assist in restoring the balance. During the investigation, they discover Lingyuan responsible for the damage and manage to bring her back to her senses after a short fight. Fujin then expends more of her power to undo the damage dealt, though she is unable to revert any remaining miasma in the vale. This causes her to revert to her original form as a carp and unable to return to her human form, but the vale is saved.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|An Ancient Sacrifice of Sacred Brocade}}</ref>
