'''Ancient Rimes''', colloquially known as Rimed Ice, are chunks of odd, glowing ice that cannot be melted using {{Pyro}}. To break them, the player must use the imbuement effect of [[Scarlet Quartz]]. When broken, Ancient Rimes may reveal [[Chests]], [[Crimson Agate]]s, or other objects or items. They are typically found in [[Dragonspine]].

The Ice Shards featured in Dragonspine quests are more powerful Ancient Rimes, requiring three attacks using different Scarlet Quartz to destroy them.
