A '''zombie''' is an individual who has been resurrected from the dead. Currently, [[Qiqi]] is the only known zombie, resurrected after being imbued with a large amount of [[Adeptus|adeptal]] energy.

==Overview==
Because Qiqi is the only frame of reference for how zombies are made, whether her situation applies for every other zombie is unclear. However, Qiqi was turned into a zombie after being imbued with enough adeptal energy to keep her in suspended animation and continue empowering her in the present. She wears an adepti talisman on her hat, which is what keeps her "alive."

Zombies normally take orders from the person who awakened them, who then becomes their master. Qiqi, however, was never awakened by anyone &mdash; she woke up on her own after being dislodged from the amber that trapped her &mdash; and is thus her own master, operating by giving herself orders.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Qiqi|Character Story 3}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Guizhong (Archon Quest)}}</ref>

Although they may appear to be a regular, living human at first glance, zombies have cold and stiff bodies due to the onset of {{w|rigor mortis}}. As a result, they are usually forced to move around by hopping. Qiqi circumvents this by performing calisthenics on a daily basis,<ref name="Qiqi1">{{Ref/CS|Qiqi|Character Story 1}}</ref> but reverts to her undead state in combat, which gives her inhuman strength.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Qiqi|Character Story 2}}</ref> She also lost her sense of taste after becoming a zombie,<ref>{{Ref/Item|No Tomorrow}}</ref> but can still distinguish texture.

Due to her undead nature, Qiqi has an incredibly poor memory; she will forget a person within three days if she does not regularly reinforce her memories of them, and admits to forgetting [[Baizhu]]'s face regularly. To commit important information to memory, she writes down important information in a notebook.<ref name="Qiqi1" /> She also speaks monotonously and displays few expressions. However, her wit is not as diminished as it may appear; she has long realized that Baizhu has underlying motives for taking her in,<ref>{{Ref/CS|Qiqi|Character Story 5}}</ref> and learned how to hide from [[Hu Tao]] as to avoid being buried.

==Trivia==
*Zombies in Liyue are specifically {{w|jiangshi}}, a type of undead creature from Chinese folklore.
**Qiqi's appearance is modelled after typical depictions of jiangshi; such as the style of her hat which resembles a Qing dynasty {{w|Qing official headwear|Guanmao}}, and the paper {{w|Fulu|talisman}} hanging off her forehead.
