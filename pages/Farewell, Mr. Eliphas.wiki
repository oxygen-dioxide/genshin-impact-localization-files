'''''Farewell, Mr. Eliphas''''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Wonders of the World]]''. To complete this achievement, the player needs to use the airship spawning during the {{Quest|In the Wake of Narcissus}} after the [[Tower of Ipsissimus]] sink, then fight "Eliphas" (a [[Tainted Hydro Phantasm]] with ordinary HP compared to [[Local Legend]]s) on an invisible platform.

==Trivia==
* "Mr. Eliphas" is known to be one of the former members of the [[Narzissenkreuz Ordo]].
* As the player ascends, it will start raining which will highlight the invisible path leading towards the boss. It will immediately stop raining once Eliphas is defeated.
