==Lore==
After the creation of the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]], the people of Enkanomiya began to observe some special phenomena &mdash; the mirages during [[Whitenight]] and the [[Sinshades]] during [[Evernight]] &mdash; which they indiscriminately referred to both as "Eidolons." It was not until the arrival of [[Orobashi]] that they were able to understand them and named the mirages "Sunfire Phantasms" and the Sinshades "[[Ghostfire Phantasms]]".<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|5}}</ref>
