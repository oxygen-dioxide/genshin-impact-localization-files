'''Sunfire Phantasms''' are an exploration mechanic in [[Enkanomiya]].

They are a [[Ley Line]] phenomenon that occurs when the land phases between [[Whitenight]] and [[Evernight]], causing energy to gather and disperse. This can cause objects to be hidden or become visible.<ref name="STDS">{{Ref/Quest|The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent}}</ref>

During Whitenight, Sunfire Phantasms manifest as distortions in the air. These distortions typically indicate the location of an interactable object, which the player must switch to Evernight to reveal. Interactable objects that may be hidden by Sunfire Phantasms include [[Key Sigil]] seals and [[Elemental Monument]]s.

==Lore==
After the creation of the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]], the people of Enkanomiya began to observe some special phenomena &mdash; the mirages during [[Whitenight]] and the [[Sinshades]] during [[Evernight]] &mdash; which they indiscriminately referred to both as "Eidolons." It was not until the arrival of [[Orobashi]] that they were able to understand them and named the mirages "Sunfire Phantasms" and the Sinshades "Ghostfire Phantasms."<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|5}}</ref> In time, they learned to manipulate the Sunfire Phantasms and would use them to purposefully hide things, such as secret entrances.<ref name="STDS" />

==Trivia==
*The [[Achievement]] unlocked by completing the World Quest [[The Entrance to Tokoyo]] is called "''[[Flowing Sunfire, Also Known as Marishi]]''."

===Etymology===
*{{lang|''Marishi''|zh=摩利支}} is derived from {{w|Marici (Buddhism)|Marici}}, a Buddhist deity associated with light and the Sun who rides on a fiery chariot.
