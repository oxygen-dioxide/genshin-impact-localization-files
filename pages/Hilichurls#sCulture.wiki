{{Stub|merge [[Hilichurl Structures]] into this section?}}
Hilichurls have been observed building structures for daily use, including for storage and guard duties. Some structures are built using "long-lost techniques."<ref name="spiral watchtower" />

Hilichurlian structures are primarily made of wood and stone, along with metal and cloth as needed or desired. A long, pole-like white material that tapers to a point at one end is often used in hilichurlian structures. It is not known what this material is, but it appears to be flexible enough to be shaped yet rigid enough to be supports for completed structures. This material is always covered with decorative designs.

Aside from the unknown material, structures may have decorative designs on cloth or etched or drawn on stone.

Hilichurlian structures largely appear simple and crude but may be remarkably sturdy.<ref name="spiral watchtower">{{Ref/Furnishing|Hilichurl Spiral Watchtower}}</ref><ref> {{Ref/Furnishing|Hilichurl Chieftain Hall}}</ref><ref name="totam fence">{{Ref/Furnishing|Hilichurl Totem Fence}}</ref> They may even be specially treated, although how they are treated and who treats them is unknown.<ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|Wooden Hilichurl Fence}}</ref>

Hilichurlian [[furnishing]]s include [[Building/Hilichurl Style|Hilichurl Style Buildings]] as well as [[Hilichurl Spiral Watchtower]], [[Hilichurl Straw Hut]], [[Hilichurl Archery Target]], [[Hilichurl Horned Pot]], [[Wooden Hilichurl Fence]], and [[Hilichurl Totem Fence]].

===Activities===
Hilichurls have been observed patrolling, standing guard, practicing combat, dancing, staring into the distance at the edge of cliffs, staring at items of interest such as [[Flaming Flower]]s, relaxing, napping, and watching other hilichurls. They may do so alone, in pairs, or in groups.

====Dancing====
Hilichurls may dance when they are happy.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Language Exchange}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Poetry Exchange}}</ref> They may also dance around items of interest, such as the broken sundial near the [[Thousand Winds Temple]]<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Crisis of Shields}}</ref> and food.<ref name="lavender melon egg dance" group="Note" /> Hilichurls may also appear to watch fellow hilichurls who dance.<ref>Event: [[Energy Amplifier Fruition]] Part 2 (Point of Interest)</ref> Hilichurls can also be observed dancing as conducted by an abyss mage.

===Food===
Hilichurls eat a large midday meal and likely also eat another meal before sleeping.<ref name="HHH" />

Hilichurls enjoy meat so much that the phrase ''mosi mita'', literally "eat meat," is also an expression of happiness in [[Hilichurlian]].

Hilichurls have been observed keeping [[Forest Boar]]s in fenced-off areas, suggesting that they may practice raising livestock.

Hilichurls do not enjoy eating vegetables, fruits, and other plants, to the point that the phrase ''mosi gusha'', literally "eat grass," is also an expression of sadness in Hilichurlian.

Hilichurls have not been observed practicing agriculture, but they value seeds.<ref name="HHH">{{Ref/Book|Handy Handbook of Hilichurlian}}</ref> Hilichurls have also been observed dancing around [[Bird Egg]]s and [[Lavender Melon]]s.<ref name="lavender melon egg dance" group="Note">Respawning Hilichurls in [[Tatarasuna]], west of [[Kannazuka]]'s [[Statue of The Seven]]</ref>

Hilichurls have been observed boiling water<ref>Event [[Wishful Drops]] Area II: [[Wishful Drops/Story#Area II: Wavering Waterweeds|Wavering Waterweeds]]</ref> using [[Flaming Flower]]s.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Moonfinger}}</ref>

===Social Relations===
Hilichurlian social structure is mostly understood through [[Jacob Musk]]'s books, [[Hilichurl Cultural Customs]] and [[Hilichurl Ballad Selection]].

Hilichurls live in tribes. The [[Meaty Tribe]], [[Sleepy Tribe]], and [[Eclipse Tribe]] in [[Dadaupa Gorge]] are three notable tribes, but hilichurl tribes can be found everywhere.

The hilichurls with the most social status are [[Samachurl]]s, who are the oldest, and [[Lawachurl]]s (literally Chief-churl in hilichurlian), who are the strongest. Lawachurls prefer to be alone, although they may be followed by admirers. Samachurls lead tribes and may be ousted by [[Mitachurl]]s (Literally good/meaty-churls), who are stronger and more aggressive. Mitachurls may also cause infighting.<ref name="totam fence" />

Hilichurls communicate with other tribes, and they also have long-distance communication.<ref name="mutual exchange">{{Ref/Quest|Mutual Exchange}}</ref><ref name="hilichurl justice">{{Ref/Quest|Hilichurl Justice}}</ref>

The vast majority of hilichurls are wary of humans and attack on sight, but [[Ella Musk]], the Traveler, and Paimon have encountered some hilichurls who were willing to talk to them without attacking.

==Technology==
===Slimes===
Hilichurls use various types of [[Slimes]] for various things. Cryo, Pyro and Dendro Slimes can be used to manufacture Exploding Barrels. Cryo Slimes have the additional use of being able to keep food fresh, and large Anemo Slimes can be used to make vehicles for transporting food.<ref name="cryo hilichurl grenadier">{{Ref/Enemy|Cryo Hilichurl Grenadier}}</ref>

===Weapons===
Hilichurls have been observed using a wide variety of weapons from wooden clubs and crossbows, to the Mitachurls' axes and Samachurls' staves. By the use of axes and crossbows, it suggests that Hilichurls possess at least a basic level of smithing prowess amongst their kind as the axes wielded by the Mitachurls are far too large for any other intelligent species to wield and crossbows have not been seen in use by any of those species either. They also appear to have advanced knowledge on imbuing weapons with elemental energy as their crossbows are able to discharge elemental energy despite the fact that the Hilichurl Shooters do not appear to possess any elemental affinity themselves, this is in stark contrast to humans who require a [[Vision]] in order to imbue their attacks with elemental energy.

==Language==
{{Main|Hilichurlian}}
Hilichurls communicate in Hilichurlian. There are no known cases of hilichurls who do not know Hilichurlian, and there are also no known cases of hilichurls who communicate in another language.

Hilichurlian is an oral language with no observed native writing system. The {{w|Latin alphabet}} is used by non-native speakers to write Hilichurlian.

==Politics==
There is one known case of a hilichurl treating [[Abyss Mage]]s and hilichurls as enemies. A Cautious Hilichurl encountered by [[Ella Musk]], the Traveler, and Paimon in [[Starfell Valley]] requested help defeating enemies, who turned out to be Abyss Mages and Hilichurl Shooters. The Cautious Hilichurl was the only hilichurl encountered whose "enemy" included Abyss Mages or hilichurls, and the Cautious Hilichurl was also seemingly more aggressive than the other hilichurls that Ella, the Traveler, and Paimon helped.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Hilichurl Justice|note=Cautious Hilichurl in Starfell Valley}}</ref> It is therefore likely that no one was mistaken and the Cautious Hilichurl truly thought of the Abyss Mages and hilichurls as enemies. This may indicate that there is tension among hilichurls over the Abyss Order's actions and the Abyss Order's influence on hilichurls.
