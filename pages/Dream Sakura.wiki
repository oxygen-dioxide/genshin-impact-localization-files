|description  = You held a single sakura petal in your hand before leaving [[Raiden Makoto]]'s [[Realm of Consciousness|realm of consciousness]].<br>Its existence is a mystery. It appears no different from ordinary sakura petals, and there it silently sits in your storage just like any of the others. But you can no longer touch it, nor can you feel its weight or warmth. When an object loses any of the attributes that one would normally ascribe to it, how can its "existence" be proven for sure?<br>As you think back on the many sights the petal must have witnessed in the past, a certain guess comes to mind: that which sustains this sakura petal's existence must be someone's will.<br>But as to who this person is, and whether they are intentionally or unintentionally keeping this petal in existence, neither can be known. Nor can you prove whether that willpower is one derived from yearning, trust, or gratitude.<br>Perhaps, when "that person's will" changes, so too will this sakura petal disappear.<br>Just to be safe, it might be best to check back from time to time and see if it still exists.
