==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Sea Drake:''' Ah, perhaps this is a helmsman's fate...
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Sea Drake:''' I'm the helmsman of this ship. I never leave my post on voyage.
::'''Sea Drake:''' If we have sudden encounters with reefs or whirlpools, I must be able to act swiftly. I can't afford to slacken my watch.
::'''Sea Drake:''' It's not an easy job, but it's always been my dream to do this.
::{{DIcon}} Your dream?
::'''Sea Drake:''' Well, I wanted to go on adventures all over the world at the helm of a large ship, sailing freely wherever I pleased. That's why I became a helmsman.
::'''Sea Drake:''' Now that I'm the helmsman of the Alcor, half my dream has been realized. The other half may never be fulfilled, though, which is a shame.
::'''Sea Drake:''' Though I'm the helmsman, where we're headed, what route we're taking... I still need to take orders from the [[Beidou|Captain]] and our [[Huixing|navigator]] on those matters.
::'''Sea Drake:''' Honestly, it was a bit disappointing at first, but I think I got over it as time went by.
::'''Sea Drake:''' Most peoples' lives are like that, anyway. Those who can control their own path will always {{sic|been}} few and far between...
::'''Sea Drake:''' I mean, at least I've met a leader who I can fully trust, you know? Captain Beidou will never lead us wrong.
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it, then.
::'''Sea Drake:''' Let's talk again when you're free.
