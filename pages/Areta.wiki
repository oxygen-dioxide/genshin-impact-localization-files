==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Areta:''' A little sun's good for your health.
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Areta:''' I'm a doctor &mdash; the legitimate kind. I've got the relevant certification, and a graduation cert from the Akademiya to boot.
::{{DIcon}} Why are you practicing medicine here?
::'''Areta:''' I used to be very poor, and I had no money to support my studies or travel overseas. It was the [[Spina di Rosula]] that sponsored me.
::'''Areta:''' Of course, they did so on the condition that I consider returning here to work as a doctor after finishing my studies. I'd be salaried as is standard, of course &mdash; with the Spina being my employer.
::'''Areta:''' I thought it was a good deal, and I understood what they wanted out of it. So I only ask for the most basic fees when I practice here.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} You're needed here.
::'''Areta:''' No, sunshine is needed here.
::'''Areta:''' But the people in Fleuve Cendre have already gotten used to such a lifestyle. We don't go up there unless it is absolutely necessary.
::'''Areta:''' *sigh* Enough about that. Same goes for you. Stay in the sunlight more often and eat more vegetables and fruits. It's good for your health.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Bulle Fruit|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Areta:''' See you. May you remain in good health.
