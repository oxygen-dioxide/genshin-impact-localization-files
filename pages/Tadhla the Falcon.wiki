{{Quest Description|Tadhla, Masseira's "Falcon," has been on a mission for a long time and has not returned. Thus Masseira asks you to find his "Falcon"...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Masseira:''' Ah, {{Traveler}}, esteemed Master of the Jinni. To what do I owe the pleasure?
:'''Liloupar:''' Splendid. Another desert-spawn. My master, I&mdash; *sigh* Never mind. I trust your judgment.
:'''Masseira:''' Could you spare a minute for me? I've been looking forward to seeing you as I've been to seeing the moon and rain.
:'''Liloupar:''' Don't let us doubt your intent. Just cut to the chase.
:'''Masseira:''' Very well, Master of the Jinni, I do have a request...
:'''Masseira:''' Haha, nothing serious. It's just my Falcon, Tadhla. I think she's in danger.
:'''Masseira:''' *sigh* If it weren't for my weak legs, I wouldn't be troubling you for this...
:'''Paimon:''' Correct Paimon if she's wrong. You want us to rescue her before thanking us profusely, paying us a large sum of Mora, and treating us to a big meal for our triumph, right?
:'''Masseira:''' Uh... Yes, yes.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, if that's the case, we'll do it!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon always gets extra logical when it comes to such situations...
:'''Liloupar:''' *sigh* Alright, let's do it for Paimon's big meal.
:'''Masseira:''' Thank you so much. I'm counting on you.
:'''Masseira:''' Let me mark out her last known location.
:'''Masseira:''' The person you need to look for, Tadhla, is tall, tanned, with light-colored long hair, and uses a long bow. Yes, this should be enough information about her.
:'''Masseira:''' Did you get it all?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... A tall, tanned girl with light-colored long hair and holds a long bow! Hehe, Paimon has an excellent memory!
:'''Masseira:''' May the wind guide you through sandstorms and away from danger.
:'''Paimon:''' Thank you. We'll see you soon!

;(Talk to Masseira again, optional)
:'''Masseira:''' Did you find her?
:'''Masseira:''' I see, you still need some time.
:'''Masseira:''' Please find her as soon as possible. Time is not on our side.

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Masseira, optional)
:'''Masseira:''' (...Maybe she underestimated the little ones...)

----
;(Approach the marked area)
:'''Paimon:''' Tadhla isn't here. Should we keep looking?
:'''Liloupar:''' Cast your gaze here... There are a great many footprints. It appears the fellows that once dwelt within the delves of this cave were an active and... careless lot.
:'''Paimon:''' That makes sense. Let's go in and investigate!

;(Approach the marked area)
:'''Paimon:''' Shh... See? There's someone over there!
:'''Liloupar:''' Hmm... My master, be those the people whom you mentioned? The "Fooltui"?
:{{DIcon}} It's the "Fatui."
:'''Liloupar:''' That name makes them sound no wiser.
:'''Paimon:''' Shh! Keep it down! If they see us...
:'''Liloupar:''' Be placid. They hear nothing of my words. Here, bear witness...
:'''Liloupar:''' Ahoy! You! Corpulent one! Over here! Time to eat!
:'''Fatui Skirmisher No. 1:''' Hmm? Did you hear anything?
:'''Fatui Skirmisher No. 2:''' No, why?
:'''Fatui Skirmisher No. 1:''' Hmm... I thought I heard someone saying time to eat.
:'''Liloupar:''' Hehe, see?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon didn't know Liloupar has a childlike side! Hehe, it's adorable.
:'''Paimon:''' Look! Over there! Is that Tadhla they got locked up?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Tall, tanned, light-colored long hair... That should be her.
:'''Liloupar:''' Well done, little one. The task is upon us, my master.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, {{Traveler}}, let's do this!

;(Approach the Fatui)
:'''Fatui Skirmisher No. 1:''' Who are you? Keep your eyes on the girl, let's go!
:'''Fatui Skirmisher No. 1:''' It's the guests of that tribe woman. Ugh! What is Babel up to?

;(After defeating the Fatui)
:'''Fatui Skirmisher No. 1:''' This position is lost! Fall back! Fall back!
:'''Liloupar:''' They ran away... Why must you bestow so much mercy on the undeserving, my master?

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Tadhla, optional)
:'''Tadhla:''' (...Blast, it doesn't work...)

;(Talk to Tadhla)
:'''Tadhla:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Um... Are you Tadhla? We are here to get you out!
:'''Tadhla:''' Yes...? Oh, yes.
:'''Tadhla:''' You let them go.
:{{DIcon}} They are no longer a threat.
:{{DIcon}} We don't need to kill them.
:'''Tadhla:''' ...They will flee and send warning to their comrades. Soon, they will all know that we are here.
:'''Liloupar:''' The wise are joined of thought. I like this girl.
:'''Paimon:''' It doesn't matter. If they come back for us, we'll just kick their butts again! Although... you're injured. Do you need help?
:'''Tadhla:''' I'm okay. I can still walk and find myself a decent place to die in peace.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, that's a relief, she can still walk and find herself a decent place to&mdash; Hey! That's not what Paimon expected to hear!
:'''Tadhla:''' Just kidding.
:'''Liloupar:''' Hahaha.
:'''Liloupar:''' I like this girl's humor... Her vagaries are most amusing.
:'''Tadhla:''' Thank you. Let's return to the tribe.
:{{DIcon}} Is it difficult to walk?
::'''Tadhla:''' It is, but I don't need any help.
:{{DIcon}} You don't even need any rest?
::'''Tadhla:''' Rest? No. I barely know you.
::'''Liloupar:''' Then, perhaps we should get more acquainted. What say you?
::'''Tadhla:''' Thank you, but maybe later.
:'''Liloupar:''' So, you are Masseira's daughter?
:'''Tadhla:''' ...
:'''Liloupar:''' A creature sparse of speech, are you?
:'''Paimon:''' Daughter? But as Paimon recalls, Masseira said Tadhla is his Falcon.
:'''Liloupar:''' Bah... She is a child of obvious human flesh. How can a human be judged to be a falcon? Comedy!
:'''Tadhla:''' ...
----
;(Talk to Masseira)
:'''Masseira:''' Ah, here's my little Falcon! Thank you so much!
:'''Tadhla:''' Sorry, I was ambushed. It was all thanks to them that I can return and see you again.
:'''Masseira:''' "Them"? Your "them" is our esteemed Master of the Jinni!
:'''Tadhla:''' I'm sorry...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh come on, it's okay! Tadhla is injured, be nice to her!
:'''Tadhla:''' ...
:'''Masseira:''' You're injured?
:'''Tadhla:''' I'm sorry.
:'''Masseira:''' By what? Animal, or human?
:'''Tadhla:''' It was the northerners. They ambushed me after realizing they were being followed.
:'''Masseira:''' You should've been the ambusher.
:'''Masseira:''' Being attacked by the prey. What a shame for a Falcon.
:'''Tadhla:''' ...
:'''Masseira:''' Go rest. I'll tend to your wound later.
:{{Black Screen|Tadhla silently nods and slowly treads away in pain.}}
:'''Paimon:''' Masseira sure is a bit too strict with Tadhla...
:{{DIcon}} Are you two not getting along?
::'''Masseira:''' Hmm? No, that would be nonsense. She's my favorite Falcon. I love her, but I don't spoil her. How do you feed a Falcon if the Falcon comes back empty-handed?
::'''Liloupar:''' Ah, so such is the case... An ugly end awaits this girl.
:{{DIcon}} Please don't be too harsh to her.
::'''Masseira:''' Harsh? No, instead I've been too kind to her. That's why she has become so... sloppy. All I'm doing is educating her. She's an outstanding Falcon. How could I ever hurt her?
::'''Liloupar:''' So, then, what stands as the most common fate to grace a Falcon...
:'''Masseira:''' Please accept this. You have my gratitude, esteemed Master of the Jinni.
:'''Liloupar:''' Ahem. Aren't you forgetting something? There are still two of us besides your Master of the Jinni.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon doubts both of us are qualified to accept the reward...
:'''Liloupar:''' Ah... Yes, of course. The fact that this floating fairy is technically not a person has eluded me till thus, but perhaps the rest of us people may receive due thanks?
:'''Paimon:''' Hey!
:'''Masseira:''' Haha, my apologies. Please take this as an extra payment.
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, extra payment!
:'''Liloupar:''' ...Still more paltry than my expectations... But I suppose I will accept this if you should not object, my master.
:'''Masseira:''' Very well. If you are available in the future, please come back one more time. I think my Falcon will need your help by then.
