|description    = Legends say that this kind of stone used to only appear in arid regions such as the deserts of [[Sumeru]], but it can now easily be found all over [[Liyue]].<br />Considering nobody would have manually transported it to Liyue from so far away, some otherwise-serious scholars came up with the rather audacious theory of "[[ley line]] shift," simply for everyone's amusement. The theory was inspired by the situation with [[Chasm's Doorstep]].
