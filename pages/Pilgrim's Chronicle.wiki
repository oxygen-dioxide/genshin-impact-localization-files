Obtained from the [[Lord of the Night]], this material plays a key role in the creation of [[Ancient Name]]s. Its essence is "memory," for [[Natlan]]'s [[Ley Line]]s do not record the adventures of outsiders, and so, a special "vessel" is needed here.<br>Memory flows within this receptacle, and if you focus on its surface, it will display the vital footprints you have left in Natlan.<br>From what you've heard, [[Xilonen]] and [[Citlali]] had a rather easy time obtaining this material. This, you presume, is thanks to the Lord of the Night's gentleness and generosity.

'''Pilgrim's Chronicle''' is a [[Quest Item]] obtained during the {{Quest|As One We Watch the Setting Sun}}. It can be used from the [[Inventory]] to open a menu listing the various notable accomplishments of the [[Traveler]] in [[Natlan]].

Initially, the menu design within the Pilgrim's Chronicle displays entries for unlocked Chronicled Deeds in the form of icons representing the associated characters, and these icons can be interacted with to show their respective description. After completing the {{Quest|When All Becomes a Monument}}, the menu design within the Pilgrim's Chronicle changes to a large graffiti, with images of the associated characters taking the place of the icons for each unlocked Chronicled Deeds entry. The description for each entry is also changed to represent each character's iconic quote addressed to the Traveler.

For the initial menu design prior to completing ''When All Becomes a Monument'', 11 out of the 14 visible entries can be unlocked. The final menu after ''When All Becomes a Monument'' has 13 character images; completing all images will award the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement ''[[Ode to Tumaini]].'' <!-- Determine if there is an additional portrait for the completion of An Omen of Annihilation and the Final Entreaty in the initial menu design, so as to explain the disparity between the number of original entries (14) and the final character images (13) since Little One changes into an adult Tepetlisaur in the final menu after the completion of said quest -->
