{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Wood:''' Welcome to the Knights of Favonius. How may I help?
:{{DIcon}} Where is this?
::'''Wood:''' This is the main hall on the ground floor of the Knights of Favonius Headquarters. On this floor you can find the library and the Grand Master's Office.
::'''Wood:''' It you have any questions, feel free to ask me at any time.
::{{DIcon}} One of these doors is locked.
::'''Wood:''' Ah, that room's not open to outsiders.
::'''Wood:''' Well, it doesn't involve some internal secret of the Knights of Favonius or anything. That room is actually solitary confinement.
::'''Wood:''' To be honest, this room has more or less become [[Klee]]'s private property...
::'''Wood:''' Every time she's locked in there, you can hear some crackling noises, like she's researching new explosives in there...
::'''Wood:''' I'm sure that she won't ignite any of her bombs in here, but if she ever slips up...
::'''Wood:''' *sigh* It just worries me.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Wood:''' I hope you find what you need here.
