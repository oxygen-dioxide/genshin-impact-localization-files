==Profile==
Sturdy Wu is the guard for Gentry Maocai's residence. In {{Quest|Know Thyself, Know Thy Enemy}}, [[Paimon]] and the [[Traveler]] demand Sturdy Wu for Gentry Maocai's whereabouts. Despite the two not being on the VIP list and his boss stressing disclosure of his location, they both get the better of Sturdy Wu by throwing around bluffs.

Sturdy Wu is a muscular man with short black hair with a V-shaped hairline. His eyes are black and framed by thick eyebrows. He wears a dark teal shirt, with a white vest patterned with gray stripes and baby blue borders. His dark blue pants, held together by a black belt are loose and cut off just above his ankles, with white leggings underneath. He wears dark blue cuffs on him, lining up below his elbows. His hazel shoes are low with a short toebox.
