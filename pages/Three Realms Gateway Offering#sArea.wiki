'''Three Realms Gateway Offering''' is a limited time area and the setting of the ''[[Three Realms Gateway Offering]]'' event. It uses the [[Enkanomiya]] map, excluding [[The Serpent's Bowels]]. It was accessible between February 18, 2022 and March 30, 2022.

It is unlocked by the Event Quest ''[[Three Realms Gateway Offering: The Eve]]'' and has its own [[Map]] Tab.

==Notable Features==
===The Encroaching Dark===
{{Main|The Encroaching Dark}}
[[File:Climate The Encroaching Dark.png|200px|left]] The entire Three Realms Gateway Offering map is affected by The Encroaching Dark, a [[climate]] condition that interacts with the [[Bokuso Box]]. Different areas of the map have different levels of Corrosion Intensity. When the Corrosion Intensity of the area the player is in is lower than the Corrosion Resistance of their Bokuso Box, the player's party will accumulate Corrosion. (This is different from the [[Corrosion]] game mechanic.)

==Trivia==
* [[Portable Waypoint]]s cannot be placed in this map.
* This map has [[Whitenight]]'s lighting, but structures that only appear during [[Evernight]] are also present.
* The [[Dainichi Mikoshi/Mechanism|Dainichi Mikoshi mechanism]] cannot be used.
* The [[Vishap Research Lab]] still exists in this map. While the Phase Gate that leads to the area is not available, it is still accessible by gliding from the very top of the Dainichi Mikoshi. However, it is empty of anything of interest.
*[[The Serpent's Bowels]] in this map can be reached though disconnecting the internet. It is empty of anything of interest, too.
**The great gate in The Serpent's Bowels doesn't have a light effect.
