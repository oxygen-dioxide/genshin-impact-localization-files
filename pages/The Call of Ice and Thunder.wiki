The event version of the Coral Defenders can use most of their regular attacks, but with some notable differences:
* Both vishaps can use the '''Spike Field''' attack.
* '''Critical Assist''' is disabled.

{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Sentou Area
|desc_1 = A bright circular area will move slowly across the arena. While within this area, the [[Bokuso Box]] will continuously gain energy.

|name_2 = Berserk State
|desc_2 = Several concentrations of darkness spawn periodically across the arena in the form of orbs, which can be cleared using the Bokuso Box. The Vishaps may consume concentrations of darkness to gain full [[Fury]] and enter the Berserk State. While in the Berserk State, the Vishaps will periodically release large shockwaves around themselves, dealing {{Color|True AoE Physical DMG}}. Using the Bokuso Box next to a Vishap will reduce their Fury by 20%, and the Berserk State will end early if Fury is reduced to 0.

|name_3 = Revival
|desc_3 = A visible link connects the two Vishaps. If one Vishap's HP reaches 0 and the other Vishap is not defeated within the next 10 seconds, the defeated Vishap will be revived with 40% of its Max HP.
|file_3 = Bathysmal Vishap Herd Soul Link
