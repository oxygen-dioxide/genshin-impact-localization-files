{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ahangar:''' What do you need?
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'd like to buy a weapon.
::'''Ahangar:''' Pattern-welded steel weapons need to be ordered in advance. These are all that I have readily available.
:{{DIcon|Forging}} I'd like something made...
:;(If nothing has been forged)
:::'''Ahangar:''' Sure.
:;(If something has been forged but not collected yet)
:::'''Ahangar:''' Your order from last time is ready. Are you here to collect it, or to place a new order?

:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Ahangar:''' You're good, but I'm better.
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Ahangar:''' Victory is yours. I've got to say, you're pretty good.
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Ahangar:''' I'm a blacksmith who's been crafting weapons for [[the Eremites]]. Sometimes I make tools, accessories, and furniture pieces for other people, too.
:;(Before finishing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
:::'''Ahangar:''' Sumeru worships Dendro, and most of the researchers aren't in the habit of arming themselves and believe in [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]]. So, most seem to find the idea of metallic weapons off-putting.
:;(After finishing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
:::'''Ahangar:''' Sumeru worships Dendro, and most of the researchers aren't in the habit of arming themselves, their belief in the Dendro Archon besides. In fact, most seem to find the idea of metallic weapons off-putting.
::'''Ahangar:''' I can make wooden weapons, too. But the majority of the orders I get in are for the pattern-welded steel weapons required by the mercenaries.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I'm alright.
:::'''Ahangar:''' Seems like you are pretty confident in your abilities.
:::'''Ahangar:''' But as they say, people with umbrellas are most easily damped on rainy days. You'd better be careful.
:::'''Ahangar:''' Regular maintenance of handy weapons will help you better deal with crisis.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Mystic Enhancement Ore|20|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Ahangar:''' Bye.
