{{Lang|'''Raiden Ei'''|ja=雷電影}}, also known by her Archon name '''Beelzebul''', is the '''God of Eternity''' and the current [[Electro]] Archon who presides over [[Inazuma]]. She is a member of [[The Seven]]. She currently functions as the [[Raiden Shogun]] of Inazuma.

Ei's older twin sister [[Makoto]], or Baal, died 500 years ago in the [[cataclysm]]. Since then, Ei has assumed the [[Shogunate]] and continued to rule under the name '''Baal'''.

Since Ei cloistered herself to meditate in the [[Plane of Euthymia]], her [[The Shogun|puppet]] has been in charge of Inazuman civil affairs. Since the events of Act II of the [[Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter]], she has decided to relinquish her original idiosyncrasies and work with the puppet, which has its own consciousness, to further Inazuma with a more forward-thinking governance.

==Profile==
===Introduction===
{{Quote|This body is the noblest and most eminent of all in this world.<br />It should hold absolute control over this world.<br />It once promised its people a dream: the never-changing "eternity."|Ei<ref>{{Ref/Item|Vajrada Amethyst Gemstone}}</ref>
}}
[[Makoto]] and Ei were twin gods who won the [[Archon War]] together. When Makoto established the [[Shogunate]], Ei became her {{Lang|{{w|Political decoy|''kagemusha''}}|ja=影武者|ja_tl=shadow warrior}}, or body double. As far as the world was aware, there was only one god named Baal, the Raiden Shogun of [[Inazuma]].<ref name="Wishes">{{Ref/Quest|Wishes (Quest)}}</ref>

After Makoto's death, Ei kept herself inside the [[Plane of Euthymia]] and let her puppet, [[the Shogun]], control the daily affairs of Inazuma.

===Personality===
{{Quote|Seven ideals for seven gods, and of these, Eternity is nearest unto the Heavenly Principles.|Beelzebul, as quoted by Zhongli<ref name="FondFarewell">{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref>}}

Based on various descriptions of her, Ei is portrayed as rather self-centered and boastful: she claims that her ideal is "nearest unto Heaven," calls her body the "noblest and most eminent of all in this world," and sees her reign as eternal. She is honorable in her conduct, but due to the losses she suffered during the [[Cataclysm]] and fearful of the erosion that would occur, she chose to move herself to the Plane of Euthymia to meditate, reflect, and keep the "eternity" she always remembered. While she slowly accepts that change is inevitable, she also possesses a curious mind over life in the present day. She is shown to be relatively slow in catching trends.

A year prior to the events of the game, Ei came to see [[Vision]]s as divine blessings, believing that they should be under the exclusive dominion of a deity and that those not controlled by her are a threat to her "eternal" rule. Being deceived by the [[Fatui]], she initiated the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] to seize most, if not all Visions in her domain and give them to the [[Statue of the Omnipresent God|Statue of the Thousand-Armed, Hundred-Eyed God]].<ref name="FondFarewell" />

As of the game's current events, it has been a full year since an [[Electro]] Vision has appeared in Teyvat.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Endless Research}}</ref> In a conversation between Ei and [[Yae Miko]] in the Plane of Euthymia, it was said that this was because Ei believed that humans pursuing their dreams and aspirations would give them more suffering and loss.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Omnipresent God}}</ref> However, when asked about this by the Traveler, Ei explains that the Archons actually have no control over Visions appearing, and in fact, she too was surprised by this fact.

===Appearance===
Ei's modern appearance is of a woman with dark purple hair tied into a long braid. She has bright purple eyes, much like the Electro element, and has a beauty mark under her right eye. She wears red eyeliner as well. She shares the same appearance as the Shogun puppet.

During the [[Chapter II Prologue]], she is depicted as a tachi-wielding woman with long violet-colored hair that was worn down. She wore a kimono which is similar to the one she wears in the present day.

==Story==
===History===
Little is known about the history of the twin gods [[Makoto]] and Ei. The two gods won the [[Archon War]] together, before deciding to "split" &mdash; Makoto would serve as the actual ruler of [[Inazuma]], while Ei served as her ''kagemusha'', or body double. They governed Inazuma together; Ei was close friends with [[Sasayuri]], [[Mikoshi Chiyo]], [[Kitsune Saiguu]], and [[Yae Miko]]. She also met [[Morax]] and [[Barbatos]] while accompanying Makoto to one of [[The Seven]]'s occasional reunions in [[Liyue]].

All those who dwelled in the nation lived in peace as long as the [[Shogunate]]'s borders were not threatened. At some point after creating [[Watatsumi Island]], the god [[Orobashi]] attacked [[Yashiori Island]] with his followers due to having been sentenced to death by [[Celestia]] for reading the book ''[[Before Sun and Moon]]'', which recorded history that they wanted hidden. Ei rallied the Shogunate forces against the god and his followers. In the ensuing war, Sasayuri was killed and Ei killed Orobashi with the [[Musou no Hitotachi]] on the island with such force that it created the [[Musoujin Gorge]]. Neither Ei nor Makoto were aware of the true motive behind Orobashi's attack.

During the [[Cataclysm]], the threat of the [[Abyss]] prompted Ei to take up arms once more alongside Makoto, Chiyo, and Saiguu. Chiyo was swallowed by a "beast of sin"; while she broke out, she was corrupted by its taint and drew her sword against Ei. In the ensuing fight, Ei sliced off Chiyo's horns and her sword-arm, but did not chase after the corrupted [[oni]]. When Ei learned that Makoto had gone to [[Khaenri'ah]] alone, she pursued her sister, tasking Saiguu with defending Inazuma. By the time she had arrived, Makoto was already dying, much to Ei's horror, although she was able to preserve some of her consciousness. After returning from Khaenri'ah, Ei assumed her sister's position in both the Shogunate and a member of The Seven. She used the powers of the [[Sacred Sakura]] to eliminate all of the monsters plaguing Inazuma, bringing peace back once more. The incident left her deeply scarred from "erosion".

At some point after the Cataclysm, Ei created an experimental puppet as a proof of concept to see if she could "escape" erosion, who later called himself [[Scaramouche|Kunikuzushi]]. She had wished to use him to store her [[Gnosis]], but Kunikuzushi shed tears upon creation, causing Ei to believe him to be too gentle for the task. Taking apparent pity on him, she decided to seal his powers and put him in a slumber in the Narukami Shrine.<ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Husk of Opulent Dreams}}</ref> Later, he arose from that slumber and roamed the Inazuman countryside where he would eventually be discovered by the [[Fatui]] and took on the name Scaramouche. She soon had a [[The Shogun|puppet version of herself]] created, making sure that it followed her ideals. Satisfied with her work, she gave her Gnosis to Miko before removing her consciousness into the [[Musou Isshin]] after she made sure she had a way to get out if it was ever required.

A year before the game's current events, Ei was deceived by the Fatui and enacted both the [[Vision Hunt Decree|Vision Hunt]] and [[Sakoku Decree]]s, shuttering her nation off from the rest of [[Teyvat]]. According to [[Zhongli]], the mortal vessel of Morax, she had ordered the Inazuma Shogunate to collect all of the [[Vision]]s in the country, where they were laid into the [[Statue of the Omnipresent God]] for reasons unknown. No one, including her people, has since been granted an [[Electro]] Vision.

===Present Day===
{{Main|Raiden Shogun/Lore|Chapter II}}

During the Rite of Descension, Morax faked his death to see if Liyue could survive without him. He guessed that Ei would learn of his "death", which would cause her to accelerate her plans. Ei appeared to be aware that Morax was still alive and that his story was not over yet.

During the [[Vision Hunt Ceremony]], the Shogun dragged the [[Traveler]] into the Plane of Euthymia, where they met Ei. In this encounter, she defeated them, but the Traveler managed to escape thanks to [[Thoma]]'s intervention. While aiding the [[Watatsumi Army]], they are rescued by Miko from Scaramouche, who revealed that the Electro Archon is Ei, who they had encountered inside the plane; the other was the Shogun puppet she created. She believed that Ei had taken an interest in them and assisted them in reaching her again for a rematch, believing that if they managed to defeat her, she would rescind the Vision Hunt Decree. The Traveler meets Ei again on the steps of [[Tenshukaku]] after attacking the Shogun before she could attack the Watatsumi Army. Drawing on the powers of the seized Visions with Miko's help, they were able to defeat Ei, who conceded and agreed to rescind the Vision Hunt Decree, returning all the seized Visions as long as their owners could be found.

After learning of the full extent of the damage dealt to the nation, Ei immediately ordered the arrest of both the [[Hiiragi Shinsuke|Kanjou]] and [[Kujou Takayuki|Tenryou Commissioners]] for their deception and started making changes to the Shogun's protocols to fit her new notions of Eternity. However, she had made little progress in doing so as the Shogun was never intended to be changed and that it had begun to see her as an enemy of eternity following her defeat,<ref>{{Ref/CS|Raiden Shogun|5}}</ref> resulting in it rebelling against her to maintain the eternity she originally sought. Ei managed to prove her newfound resolve to the Shogun in a duel. As part of a new agreement and seeing that her views had been flawed from the start, Ei had the Shogun serve as her ''kagemusha'' as she began to play a more active role in Inazuma's policies to honor their wishes, first by abolishing the Sakoku Decree to the delight of many.

==Character Mentions==
{{See also|Raiden Shogun/Lore#Character Mentions}}
{{Character Mentions|alias=Baal}}

==Trivia==
* The pinnacle of Ei's swordsmanship is the {{Lang|[[Musou no Hitotachi]]|ja=無想の一太刀|ja_rm=Musou no Hito-tachi|ja_tl=One Slash of No Conception}}, the symbol of ultimate power.<ref name="Follow the Wind Cutschene">{{Ref/Quest|Follow the Wind|note=Cutscene}}</ref> The sword skill is said to be only witnessed during "divine punishment."<ref name="Follow the Wind Cutschene" />
* According to the in-game [[archive]] description for [[Shiba]]s, Ei was once allegedly quite fond of the dog breed.
* Several aspects regarding Makoto, Ei, and the Raiden Shogun's identities were hinted at before the Archon Quests revealed it:
** The Raiden Shogun's character teaser and character demo heavily emphasized the imagery of two Raiden Shoguns, which are meant to be Makoto and Ei.
** The English name for [[Vajrada Amethyst Gemstone]] hinted that the Raiden Shogun seen in Inazuma is a puppet. The real Ei is inside her weapon: At the time of the reveal, it was the only gemstone that did not derive its name from a Hindu god. Instead, its name comes from Vajra, the weapon wielded by {{w|Indra}}, the Hindu god of rain and thunder.
* [[The Shogun]] Puppet and Ei have recited multiple poems in the character demo and other media. (See [[Raiden Shogun/Lore#Haiku & Waka|Raiden Shogun/Lore]])

===Etymology===
* In Shinto mythology, {{Lang|Raiden|ja=雷電|ja_rm=Raiden}} is another name for {{w|Raijin}}, a god of lightning, thunder, and storms. Raiden also means "thunder and lightning" in both Japanese and Chinese.
* Ei is loosely based on [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Raiden Mei|Raiden Mei]], a character from ''Houkai Gakuen 2'' and ''{{w|Honkai Impact 3rd}}'', other games created by [[miHoYo]]. Raiden Mei, Makoto, and Ei are strikingly similar to each other:
** Raiden Mei, Makoto, and Ei all have purple eyes and long purple hair.
** Raiden Mei, Makoto, and Ei all harness the power of lightning (Electro).
** Raiden Mei is the 3rd Herrscher (the Herrscher of Thunder), while Baal is the third among the Seven Archons to appear.
** ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' also has an official manga titled "Escape from Nagazora." It has a chapter called "[https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/book/1015/3 The Wrath of Baal]", which showcases Mei's first appearance as the Herrscher of Thunder.
** Raiden Mei, Makoto, and Ei are all voiced by the same voice actress in Japanese, Miyuki Sawashiro (沢城みゆき) and the same voice actress in Chinese, Juhuahua (菊花花).
** Both characters have fought an elite member of a powerful organization. Said members are also associated with {{w|Lepidoptera}} (butterflies/moths). With the Raiden Shogun's case, she fought [[Signora]] whose surname (Lohefalter) means "blazing butterfly". While with Raiden Mei's case, she fought a simulation of [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Aponia|Aponia]]. {{w|Aponia (moth)|Aponia}} is also a genus of moths from the family {{w|Crambidae}}.
* {{w|Beelzebub}} (also spelled ''Beelzebul'') was the name of a Philistine deity and is known in Demonology as one of the Seven Princes of Hell. Many Christian theological sources recognise the name Beelzebub as another name for Satan.
** The source for the name Beelzebub comes from the Book of Kings in the Hebrew Bible, written as בַּעַל זְבוּב‎, ''Baʿal Zəvûv''. As such, Ba'al was a title and honorific meaning "owner" or "lord" in antiquity.
** So far, Beelzebul is the only Archon name that does not appear in the {{w|The Lesser Key of Solomon|Ars Goetia}}.
* Beelzebul as a shogun is most likely inspired by {{w|Tokugawa Ieyasu}} (1543–1616), the founder and first shogun of the Tokugawa Shogunate (1603–1868).
** The Japanese name of her constellation is {{Lang|Tenkabito-za|ja=天下人座|ja_tl=Seat of the Person under the Heaven}}. ''Tenkabito'' means a person who virtually holds the reins of the nation and usually refers to three powerful warlords: {{w|Oda Nobunaga}}, {{w|Toyotomi Hideyoshi}}, and Tokugawa Ieyasu, of which the last is the only ''tenkabito'' who became a shogun.
** Although the official decree of Sakoku was issued under the reign of his grandson, there were several precursors of the Sakoku decree during Ieyasu's reign.
** Like Ei, Ieyasu was skilled in swordsmanship. He is said to have mastered the {{Lang|Ichi no Tachi|ja=一之太刀|ja_rm=Slash of One}} in his later years, the ultimate sword art of the {{w|Kashima Shintō-ryū|Kashima Shintou school}} that only a chosen few were allowed to learn,<ref>Kotobank: [https://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%A1%9A%E5%8E%9F%E5%8D%9C%E4%BC%9D-99062 塚原卜伝]</ref> which may have inspired the {{Lang|"Hitotachi"|ja=一太刀|ja_rm=One Slash}} part of the Musou no Hitotachi (see later part for "Musou").
** Ieyasu also patronized two swordsmen and their schools: {{w|Yagyū Munenori|Yagyuu Munenori}} of the Yagyuu-Shinkage school and {{w|Mikogami Tenzen|Ono Tadaaki}} of the Ittou school. The former school may have inspired the swordsman [[Iwakura Doukei]] in the game (see the article for details). The latter school is known for the semi-legendary sword art {{Lang|Musouken|ja=夢想剣|ja_rm=Sword of the Dream}}, which may have inspired the name of {{Lang|Musou Shinsetsu|ja=夢想真説|ja_rm=True Teachings of the Dream}}, the Elemental Burst of the playable Raiden Shougun (but not "Musou" in the Musou no Hitotachi during the story and in past legends, which has a different kanji).
** There is a conspiracy theory that Ieyasu had a kagemusha (body double) and the kagemusha took the place of real Ieyasu at some point in the history.<ref>Japanese Wikipedia: [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%BE%B3%E5%B7%9D%E5%AE%B6%E5%BA%B7%E3%81%AE%E5%BD%B1%E6%AD%A6%E8%80%85%E8%AA%AC 徳川家康の影武者説] (Kagemusha Theory of Tokugawa Ieyasu)</ref> It is not taken a serious consideration by historians but is a popular theme in Japanese historical fictions. This theory may have inspired the in-game lore that Ei was originally a kagemusha of Makoto.
* Ei as the God of Eternity is likely inspired by the shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu's faith in {{w|Pure Land Buddhism}}.
** Her title "Plane of Euthymia" is called {{Lang|"Pure Land of One Mind"|ja=一心浄土|ja_rm=Isshin Joudo}} in the East Asian versions, which refers to the realm of perfect purity and quietude in one's mind, namely a Buddhist version of {{w|idealism}} that all beings arise from mind and thus buddhas and their meditation realms (Pure Land) also reside in one's own mind.<ref>Grand Dictionary of Joudo-Shuu: [http://jodoshuzensho.jp/daijiten/index.php/%E5%B7%B1%E5%BF%83%E3%81%AE%E5%BC%A5%E9%99%80%E3%83%BB%E5%94%AF%E5%BF%83%E3%81%AE%E6%B5%84%E5%9C%9F 己心の弥陀・唯心の浄土]</ref> Historically, Ieyasu was an avid follower and patron of the {{Lang|{{w|Jōdo-shū|Pure Land School}}|ja=浄土宗|ja_rm=Joudo-shuu}}, and he adopted the school's slogan {{Lang|"Abhor the Impure Land, Aspire to the Pure Land"|ja=厭離穢土 欣求浄土|ja_rm=Enri-Edo Gongu-Joudo}} as his banner sign.<ref name="gongu-joudo">Grand Dictionary of Joudo-Shuu: [http://jodoshuzensho.jp/daijiten/index.php/%E5%8E%AD%E9%9B%A2%E7%A9%A2%E5%9C%9F%E6%AC%A3%E6%B1%82%E6%B5%84%E5%9C%9F 新纂浄土宗大辞典：厭離穢土欣求浄土]</ref>
** Unlike other schools of Buddhism (which are generally anti-dogmatic and embrace impermanence), Pure Land Buddhism emphasizes a strong faith in {{Lang|{{w|Amitābha|Amida}}|ja=阿弥陀}}, the Buddha of Infinity. The name Amida comes from the Chinese name {{Lang|Ēmítuó|zh=阿弥陀}}, which in turn is the combination of two Sanskrit names: {{Lang|Amitābha|sa=अमिताभ}} meaning "Infinite Light" and {{Lang|Amitāyus|sa=अमितायुस्}} meaning "Infinite Longevity." Both properties of Amida match Ei's orientation to eternity (especially eternal longevity).
** After the cataclysm, Ei claimed her body was the most eminent in the world and promised never-changing eternity to her people. Similarly, Ieyasu was posthumously deified as a ''dai-gongen'', or a great manifestation of a buddha as a Shinto god, because he claimed he wanted to be a guardian of the nation even after his mortal life ended.<ref>Tokyo Museum Collection: [https://museumcollection.tokyo/en/works/6279645/ Portrait of Tokugawa Ieyasu]</ref> In addition, Ieyasu's slogan "Abhor the Impure Land, Aspire to the Pure Land" is alleged to represent his determination to end the cataclysm of the {{w|Sengoku period}} (Warring States period) and build a pure land in this world by bringing peace.<ref name="gongu-joudo" />
** The [[Statue of the Omnipresent God|Statue of the Thousand-Armed, Hundred-Eyed God]] is most likely a reference to {{Lang|Senju-Kan'non|ja=千手観音|ja_tl=Thousand-Armed Avalokiteśvara}}, a manifestation of the bodhisattva {{Lang|{{w|Avalokiteśvara|Kan'non}}|sa=अवलोकितेश्वर|sa_rm=Avalokiteśvara|ja=観音}}, one of the two main assistants of Amida.
** In her realm, Ei meditates in the sitting position of {{Lang|''hanka fumisage''|ja=半跏踏下|ja_tl=half-lotus pendant}}, a variant of the {{w|Lotus position|half-lotus position}} (but not necessarily a foot has to be placed on a thigh). In Buddhist art in Japan, this position is commonly used to depict the bodhisattva {{Lang|{{w|Maitreya|Miroku}}|sa=मैत्रेय|sa_rm=Maitreya|ja=弥勒}}, an object of worship in Pure Land Buddhism that predates worship for Amida. Miroku is said to confine himself in his realm of Pure Land for meditation to achieve enlightenment and bring salvation to all sentient beings. Until the expected achievement of his enlightenment, he is believed to send his avatars to help this world on behalf of him. Beelzebul's self-confinement in her realm of Euthymia ("Pure Land" in the East Asian versions) and her use of a puppet for the mundane world may be inspired by this belief.
* Ei's ultimate sword skill [[Musou no Hitotachi]] is most likely a reference to the {{Lang|Munen-Musou no Uchi|ja=無念無想の打|ja_tl=Strike of No Design, No Conception}}, created by the swordsman {{w|Miyamoto Musashi}}, who is often called a "sword saint."
** Musou is short for {{Lang|Munen-Musou|ja=無念無想|ja_tl=No Design, No Conception}}. According to Victor Harris, a former Keeper of Japanese Antiquities at the British Museum in London, ''munen-musou'' in Japanese swordsmanship means "the ability to act calmly and naturally even in the face of danger. It is the highest accord with existence when a man's word and his actions are spontaneously the same."<ref name="Book of Five Rings" /> (some spelling changes from the original text of Harris)
** According to Musashi's ''{{w|The Book of Five Rings}}'' (translated by Victor Harris), "In this method, when the enemy attacks and you decide to attack, hit with your body, and hit with your spirit, and hit from the Void with your hands, accelerating strongly. This is the "No Design, No Conception" cut. This is the most important method of hitting. It is often used. You must train hard to understand it."<ref name="Book of Five Rings">Miyamoto Musashi: [https://archive.org/details/MiyamotoMusashi-BookOfFiveRingsgoRinNoSho/page/n23/mode/2up Book of Five Rings - The Water Book]</ref>
* Ei's (alleged) past fondness for Shiba dogs is most likely a reference to {{w|Tokugawa Tsunayoshi}}, the fifth shogun of the Edo Bakufu (Tokugawa Shogunate). He was nicknamed as {{Lang|the Dog Shogun|ja=犬公方|ja_rm=Inu-Kubou}} because of his eagerness to enact animal protection laws.
