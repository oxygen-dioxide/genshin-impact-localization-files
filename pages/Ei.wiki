She assumed the [[Shogunate]] after the previous Electro Archon, her older twin sister [[Makoto]], died in the [[cataclysm]].

Fearing erosion, she abandoned her body and transferred her consciousness into the [[Musou Isshin]], which is now stored in [[the Shogun|the Shogun puppet]].

Following the events of {{Quest|Transient Dreams|showType=0}}, she works to further Inazuma with a more forward-thinking governance.

Ei and [[Makoto]] were twin gods who won the [[Archon War]] together. When Makoto established the [[Shogunate]], Ei became her {{Lang|{{w|Political decoy|''kagemusha''}}|ja=影武者|ja_tl=shadow warrior}}, or body double. As far as the world was aware, there was only one god named Baal, the Raiden Shogun of [[Inazuma]].<ref name="Wishes">{{Ref/Quest|Wishes (Quest)}}</ref>

After Makoto's death, Ei continued to rule under the name Baal.<ref name="Wishes"/> She kept her consciousness inside the [[Plane of Euthymia]], leaving her puppet, [[the Shogun]], to control the daily affairs of Inazuma.

===Appearance===

==Story==
===History===
Raiden Ei and [[Raiden Makoto]] were identical twin gods who lived during the time of the [[Archon War]]. While Ei was a far more formidable warrior than the peaceful Makoto, Ei believed Makoto to be a better ruler for humanity. After Ei prevailing and slaying all her rivals, Ei willingly sacrificed her body so that Makoto could ascend to [[Celestia]] instead of her and become one of [[The Seven]].<ref name="Treasured Tales"/> After becoming the first [[Electro]] Archon, Makoto recreated Ei's body and made Ei her {{Lang|''kagemusha''|ja=影武者|ja_tl=shadow warrior}}, or body double.<ref name="Treasured Tales"/> As far as the world was aware, there were not two, but one. They complemented each other, and they ruled [[Inazuma]] jointly; therefore, there was no need for the public to know the truth. The name "Baal" and the title of Raiden Shogun were understood to refer to both of them.<ref name="Wishes"/>

All those who dwelled in the nation lived in peace as long as the [[Shogunate]]'s borders were not threatened. At some point after creating [[Watatsumi Island]], the god [[Orobashi]] attacked [[Yashiori Island]] with his followers due to having been sentenced to death by [[Celestia]] for reading the book ''[[Before Sun and Moon]]'', which recorded history that they wanted hidden, as well as paying for Enkanomiya's transgressions.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent}}</ref> Ei rallied the Shogunate forces against the god and his followers. In the ensuing war, [[Sasayuri]] was killed and Ei killed Orobashi with the [[Musou no Hitotachi]] on the island with such force that it created the [[Musoujin Gorge]]. Neither Ei nor Makoto were aware of the true motive behind Orobashi's attack.<ref name="Sangonomiya Chronicles">{{Ref/Book|Sangonomiya Chronicles}}</ref>

After the official end of the Archon War 2,000 years ago, Ei met [[Morax]]<ref name="Morax">{{Ref/VO|Raiden Shogun|Morax}}</ref> and [[Barbatos]]<ref>{{Ref/VO|Raiden Shogun|Venti}}</ref> while accompanying Makoto to one of [[The Seven]]'s occasional reunions in [[Liyue]].

At some point, [[Kapatcir]] begins to wreak havoc on [[Seirai Island]]. Being a threat to its inhabitants, Ei pursued and killed her.<ref name="Thundering Fury">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Thundering Fury}}</ref><ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/hQ5GEOlwLUQ Story Teaser: Promise of a People's Dream]</ref> As a result, the island was left in ruins, and the remnants of her power were suppressed by the protections of the [[Asase Shrine]], where a [[Thunder Manifestation|coagulation of regret]] formed.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Seirai Stormchasers}}</ref>

During the cataclysm, the threat of the [[Abyss]] prompted Ei to take up arms once more alongside Makoto, [[Mikoshi Chiyo]], and [[Kitsune Saiguu]]. When Ei learned that Makoto had gone to [[Khaenri'ah]] alone, she pursued her sister, tasking Saiguu with defending Inazuma.<ref name="Cleansing Light">{{Ref/Quest|Cleansing Light}}</ref> By the time she had arrived, Makoto was already dying, much to Ei's horror, although the former archon was able to preserve some of her consciousness.<ref name="Cleansing Light"/> After returning from Khaenri'ah, Ei assumed her sister's position in both the Shogunate and a member of The Seven.<ref name="Cleansing Light"/> Chiyo was swallowed by a "beast of sin";<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Magnificent Tsuba}}</ref> while she broke out, she was corrupted by its taint and drew her sword against Ei.<ref name="Mask of the Kijin">{{Ref/Item|Mask of the Kijin}}</ref> In the ensuing fight, Ei sliced off Chiyo's horns and her sword-arm, but did not chase after the corrupted [[oni]].<ref name="Mask of the Kijin"/> She used the powers of the [[Sacred Sakura]] to eliminate all of the monsters plaguing Inazuma, bringing peace back once more, though Saiguu had died in the process.<ref name="Cleansing Light"/> The incident left her deeply scarred from "erosion."

At some point after the cataclysm, through unknown means and with the help of Khaenri'ahn techniques, Ei created an experimental puppet as a proof of concept to see if she could "escape" erosion, who later called himself [[Kunikuzushi]]. She had wished to use him to store her [[Gnosis]], but Kunikuzushi shed tears upon creation, causing Ei to believe him to be too gentle for the task. Taking apparent pity on him, she decided to seal his powers and leave him in a slumber in the Narukami Shrine.<ref name="Husk" /> Later, he arose from that slumber and roamed the Inazuman countryside where he would eventually be discovered by the [[Fatui]] and took on the name Scaramouche.<ref name="Wishes"/>

About 400 years ago,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call}}</ref> she created a [[The Shogun|puppet version of herself]], making sure that it followed her ideals. Satisfied with her work, she gave her Gnosis to Miko before removing her consciousness from her body into the [[Musou Isshin]].

This way, her people wouldn't be in danger of transgressing the [[Heavenly Principles]] and be punished for it, like Khaenri'ah did, and she herself would survive as their permanent god by preserving her consciousness free of erosion and keeping an indestructible artificial body, so that her people wouldn't suffer the loss she herself experienced when Makoto died.<ref name="The Omnipresent God"/>

A year before the game's current events, the Shogun puppet was deceived by the Fatui and allowed the corrupt members of the Tri-Commission, headed by Kujou Takayuki, to enact both the [[Vision Hunt Decree|Vision Hunt]] and [[Sakoku Decree]]s with Ei's tacit approval, shuttering her nation off from the rest of [[Teyvat]]. According to [[Zhongli]], the mortal vessel of Morax, she had ordered the Inazuma Shogunate to collect all of the [[Vision]]s in the country, where they were laid into the [[Statue of the Omnipresent God]] for reasons unknown. No one, including her people, has since been granted an [[Electro]] Vision.<ref name="The Fond Farewell"/>

===Present Day===
{{Main|Raiden Shogun/Lore|Chapter II}}

During the Rite of Descension, Morax faked his death to see if Liyue could survive without him. He guessed that Ei would learn of his "death" and retirement, which would cause her to accelerate her plans.<ref name="The Fond Farewell"/> Ei, for her part, believed that his story was not over yet.<ref name="Morax"/>

When the Traveler arrived on Inazuma to speak with Ei, they were instead roped by the resistance to help abolish the Vision Hunt Decree, first encountering her in the [[Plane of Euthymia]] when they attempted to intervene after the Shogun apprehended [[Thoma]] to take his Vision.<ref name="Amidst Stormy Judgment">{{Ref/Quest|Amidst Stormy Judgment}}</ref> In this encounter, she defeated them, but the Traveler managed to escape thanks to Thoma's intervention.<ref name="Amidst Stormy Judgment"/> While aiding the [[Watatsumi Army]], they are rescued by Miko from Scaramouche,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Delusion}}</ref> who revealed that the Electro Archon is Ei, who they encountered in the plane; the one in the real world was actually her puppet.<ref name="The Servant's Path">{{Ref/Quest|The Servant's Path}}</ref> She believed that Ei had taken an interest in them and assisted them in reaching her again for a rematch, believing that if they managed to defeat her, she would rescind the Vision Hunt Decree.<ref name="The Servant's Path"/> The Traveler met Ei again on the steps of [[Tenshukaku]] when the Shogun attempted to attack the Watatsumi Army, who had arrived to confront her. Drawing on the powers of the seized Visions with Miko's help, they were able to convince Ei to rescind the Vision Hunt Decree, returning all the seized Visions as long as their owners could be found.<ref name="The Omnipresent God"/>

After learning of the full extent of the damage dealt to the nation, Ei immediately ordered the arrest of both the [[Hiiragi Shinsuke|Kanjou]] and [[Kujou Takayuki|Tenryou Commissioners]] for their deception and started making changes to the Shogun's protocols to fit her new notions of Eternity.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Lonesome Euthymia}}</ref> However, she had made little progress in doing so as the Shogun was never intended to be changed and that it had begun to see her as an enemy of eternity following her change of mind<ref>{{Ref/CS|Raiden Shogun|5}}</ref> resulting in it rebelling against her to maintain the eternity she originally sought.

Ei managed to prove that her newfound resolve wasn't a product of erosion to the Shogun in a duel. As part of a new agreement, Ei would no longer rule the nation on the basis of fear of the Heavenly Principles, honoring past sacrifices instead of trying to prevent further loss by overprotecting Inazuma from the dangers of its progress.<ref name="Radiant Sakura">{{Ref/Quest|Radiant Sakura}}</ref>

Though the Shogun becomes her ''kagemusha'', Ei vows not to regard her as a mere tool of eternity, just like her sister did with herself, as she began to play a more active role in Inazuma's policies while the people of the nation began to know her as an individual instead of holding onto their unrealistic notion of a permanent and omnipresent god. The Sakoku Decree was also abolished, to the delight of many.<ref name="Radiant Sakura"/>

{{Character Mentions|alias=Baal}}

==Trivia==
* The pinnacle of Ei's swordsmanship is the {{Lang|[[Musou no Hitotachi]]|ja=無想の一太刀|ja_rm=Musou no Hito-tachi|ja_tl=One Slash of No Conception}}, the symbol of ultimate power.<ref name="Follow the Wind Cutscene">{{Ref/Quest|Follow the Wind|note=Cutscene}}</ref> The sword skill is said to be only witnessed during "divine punishment."<ref name="Follow the Wind Cutscene" />
* The true identities of Ei, Makoto, and the puppet were hinted at before the release of the Raiden Shogun in [[Version 2.1]]:
** The Raiden Shogun's [[:File:Character Teaser - "Raiden Shogun- Nightmare" - Genshin Impact|Character Teaser]] depicts a second individual bearing the likeness of Ei, who is later understood to be Makoto.
** Her [[:File:Character Demo - "Raiden Shogun- Judgment of Euthymia" - Genshin Impact|Character Demo]] heavily emphasized the imagery of two Raiden Shoguns, which symbolizes Ei and the puppet sharing the same body.
** The English name for [[Vajrada Amethyst Gemstone]] hinted that the Raiden Shogun seen in Inazuma is a puppet. The real Ei is inside her weapon: At the time of the reveal, it was the only gemstone that did not derive its name from a Hindu god. Instead, its name comes from Vajra, the weapon wielded by {{w|Indra}}, the Hindu god of rain and thunder.
* Ei is also known by these aliases or additional terms of address:
** Almighty Raiden Shogun<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Blind Loyalty, Reckless Courage}}</ref>
** Almighty Raiden Ogosho<ref name="Sangonomiya Chronicles"/>
** Her Excellency
** Her Highness<ref>{{Ref/VP|Tenryou, Inazuma City}}</ref>
** Great Narukami<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Sakura Arborism}}</ref>

===Etymology===
* In Shinto mythology, {{Lang|Raiden|ja=雷電|ja_rm=Raiden}} is another name for {{w|Raijin}}, the ''kami'', or god of lightning, thunder, and storms. Raiden also means "thunder and lightning" in both Japanese and Chinese.
* {{Lang|"Ei"|ja=影}} literally means "shadow". This is an allusion to her role as a body double for her sister Makoto, as {{Lang|"Makoto"|ja=真}} literally means "real" or "true".
* Ei is loosely based on [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Raiden Mei|Raiden Mei]], a character from ''Houkai Gakuen 2'' and ''{{w|Honkai Impact 3rd}}'', other games created by [[miHoYo]]. Raiden Mei, Makoto, and Ei are strikingly similar to each other:
** Raiden Mei, Makoto, and Ei all have purple eyes and long purple hair.
** Raiden Mei, Makoto, and Ei all harness the power of lightning (Electro).
** Raiden Mei is the 3rd Herrscher (the Herrscher of Thunder), while Baal is the third among the Seven Archons to appear.
** ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' also has an official manga titled "Escape from Nagazora." It has a chapter called "[https://manga.honkaiimpact3.com/book/1015/3 The Wrath of Baal]," which showcases Mei's first appearance as the Herrscher of Thunder.
** Raiden Mei, Makoto, and Ei are all voiced by the same voice actress in Japanese, Miyuki Sawashiro ({{ja|沢城 みゆき}}) and the same voice actress in Chinese, Juhuahua ({{zh|菊花花}}).
** Both characters have fought an elite member of a powerful organization. Said members are also associated with {{w|Lepidoptera}} (butterflies/moths). The Raiden Shogun fought [[Signora]], whose surname (Lohefalter) means "blazing butterfly," while Raiden Mei fought a simulation of [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Aponia|Aponia]]. {{w|Aponia (moth)|Aponia}} is also a genus of moths from the family {{w|Crambidae}}.
* {{w|Beelzebub}} (also spelled ''Beelzebul'') was the name of a Philistine deity and is known in Demonology as one of the Seven Princes of Hell. Many Christian theological sources recognize the name Beelzebub as another name for Satan.
** The source for the name Beelzebub comes from the Book of Kings in the Hebrew Bible, written as {{Lang|mini=1|he=בַּעַל זְבוּב|he_rm=Baʿal Zəvûv}}. As such, Ba'al was a title and honorific meaning "owner" or "lord" in antiquity.
** So far, Beelzebul is the only Archon name that does not appear in the ''{{w|The Lesser Key of Solomon|Ars Goetia}}''.
* Beelzebul as a shogun is most likely inspired by {{w|Tokugawa Ieyasu}} (1543–1616), the founder and first shogun of the Tokugawa Shogunate (1603–1868).
** The Japanese name of her constellation is {{ja|天下人座|rm=Tenkabito-za|tl=Seat of the Person under the Heaven}}. {{ja|天下人|rm=Tenkabito}} means a person who virtually holds the reins of the nation and usually refers to three powerful warlords: {{w|Oda Nobunaga}}, {{w|Toyotomi Hideyoshi}}, and Tokugawa Ieyasu, of which the last is the only {{ja|天下人|rm=tenkabito}} who became a shogun.
** Although the official decree of Sakoku was issued under the reign of his grandson, there were several precursors of the Sakoku decree during Ieyasu's reign.
** Like Ei, Ieyasu was skilled in swordsmanship. He is said to have mastered the {{Lang|''Ichi no Tachi''|ja=一之太刀|ja_rm=Slash of One}} in his later years, the ultimate sword art of the {{w|Kashima Shintō-ryū|Kashima Shintou school}} that only a chosen few were allowed to learn,<ref>Kotobank: [https://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%A1%9A%E5%8E%9F%E5%8D%9C%E4%BC%9D-99062 {{ja|塚原卜伝}}]</ref> which may have inspired the {{Lang|"Hitotachi"|ja=一太刀|ja_rm=One Slash}} part of the Musou no Hitotachi (see later part for "Musou").
** Ieyasu also patronized two swordsmen and their schools: {{w|Yagyū Munenori|Yagyuu Munenori}} of the Yagyuu-Shinkage school and {{w|Mikogami Tenzen|Ono Tadaaki}} of the Ittou school. The former school may have inspired the swordsman [[Iwakura Michihiro]] in the game (see the article for details). The latter school is known for the semi-legendary sword art {{Lang|Musouken|ja=夢想剣|ja_rm=Sword of the Dream}}, which may have inspired the name of {{Lang|Musou Shinsetsu|ja=夢想真説|ja_rm=True Teachings of the Dream}}, the Elemental Burst of the playable Raiden Shougun (but not "Musou" in the Musou no Hitotachi during the story and in past legends, which has a different kanji).
** There is a conspiracy theory that Ieyasu had a ''kagemusha'' (body double) and the kagemusha took the place of real Ieyasu at some point in the history.<ref>Japanese Wikipedia: [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/{{subst:#urldecode:%E5%BE%B3%E5%B7%9D%E5%AE%B6%E5%BA%B7%E3%81%AE%E5%BD%B1%E6%AD%A6%E8%80%85%E8%AA%AC}} {{ja|徳川家康の影武者説|tl=Kagemusha Theory of Tokugawa Ieyasu}}]</ref> It is not taken a serious consideration by historians but is a popular theme in Japanese historical fictions. This theory may have inspired the in-game lore that Ei was originally a ''kagemusha'' of Makoto.
* Ei as the God of Eternity is likely inspired by the shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu's faith in {{w|Pure Land Buddhism}}.
** Her title "Plane of Euthymia" is called {{Lang|"Pure Land of One Mind"|ja=一心浄土|ja_rm=Isshin Joudo}} in the East Asian versions, which refers to the realm of perfect purity and quietude in one's mind, namely a Buddhist version of {{w|idealism}} that all beings arise from mind and thus buddhas and their meditation realms (Pure Land) also reside in one's own mind.<ref>Grand Dictionary of Joudo-Shuu: [http://jodoshuzensho.jp/daijiten/index.php/己心の弥陀・唯心の浄土 {{ja|己心の弥陀・唯心の浄土}}]</ref> Historically, Ieyasu was an avid follower and patron of the {{Lang|{{w|Jōdo-shū|Pure Land School}}|ja=浄土宗|ja_rm=Joudo-shuu}}, and he adopted the school's slogan {{Lang|"Abhor the Impure Land, Aspire to the Pure Land"|ja=厭離穢土 欣求浄土|ja_rm=Enri-Edo Gongu-Joudo}} as his banner sign.<ref name="gongu-joudo">Grand Dictionary of Joudo-Shuu: [http://jodoshuzensho.jp/daijiten/index.php/厭離穢土欣求浄土 {{ja|新纂浄土宗大辞典：厭離穢土欣求浄土}}]</ref>
** Unlike other schools of Buddhism (which are generally anti-dogmatic and embrace impermanence), Pure Land Buddhism emphasizes a strong faith in {{Lang|{{w|Amitābha|''Amida''}}|ja=阿弥陀}}, the Buddha of Infinity. The name Amida comes from the Chinese name {{Lang|''Ēmítuó''|zh=阿弥陀}}, which in turn is the combination of two Sanskrit names: {{Lang|''Amitābha''|sa=अमिताभ}} meaning "Infinite Light" and {{Lang|''Amitāyus''|sa=अमितायुस्}} meaning "Infinite Longevity." Both properties of Amida match Ei's orientation to eternity (especially eternal longevity).
** After the cataclysm, Ei claimed her body was the most eminent in the world and promised never-changing eternity to her people. Similarly, Ieyasu was posthumously deified as a ''dai-gongen'', or a great manifestation of a buddha as a Shinto god, because he claimed he wanted to be a guardian of the nation even after his mortal life ended.<ref>Tokyo Museum Collection: [https://museumcollection.tokyo/en/works/6279645/ Portrait of Tokugawa Ieyasu]</ref> In addition, Ieyasu's slogan "Abhor the Impure Land, Aspire to the Pure Land" is alleged to represent his determination to end the cataclysm of the {{w|Sengoku period}} (Warring States period) and build a pure land in this world by bringing peace.<ref name="gongu-joudo" />
** The [[Statue of the Omnipresent God|Statue of the Thousand-Armed, Hundred-Eyed God]] is most likely a reference to {{Lang|Senju-Kan'non|ja=千手観音|ja_tl=Thousand-Armed Avalokiteśvara}}, a manifestation of the bodhisattva {{Lang|{{w|Avalokiteśvara|Kan'non}}|sa=अवलोकितेश्वर|sa_rm=Avalokiteśvara|ja=観音}}, one of the two main assistants of Amida.
** In her realm, Ei meditates in the sitting position of {{Lang|''hanka fumisage''|ja=半跏踏下|ja_tl=half-lotus pendant}}, a variant of the {{w|Lotus position|half-lotus position}} (but not necessarily a foot has to be placed on a thigh). In Buddhist art in Japan, this position is commonly used to depict the bodhisattva {{Lang|{{w|Maitreya|Miroku}}|sa=मैत्रेय|sa_rm=Maitreya|ja=弥勒}}, an object of worship in Pure Land Buddhism that predates worship for Amida. Miroku is said to confine himself in his realm of Pure Land for meditation to achieve enlightenment and bring salvation to all sentient beings. Until the expected achievement of his enlightenment, he is believed to send his avatars to help this world on behalf of him. Beelzebul's self-confinement in her realm of Euthymia ("Pure Land" in the East Asian versions) and her use of a puppet for the mundane world may be inspired by this belief.
* Ei's ultimate sword skill [[Musou no Hitotachi]] is most likely a reference to the {{Lang|Munen-Musou no Uchi|ja=無念無想の打|ja_tl=Strike of No Design, No Conception}}, created by the swordsman {{w|Miyamoto Musashi}}, who is often called a "sword saint."
** Musou is short for {{Lang|Munen-Musou|ja=無念無想|ja_tl=No Design, No Conception}}. According to Victor Harris, a former Keeper of Japanese Antiquities at the British Museum in London, ''munen-musou'' in Japanese swordsmanship means "the ability to act calmly and naturally even in the face of danger. It is the highest accord with existence when a man's word and his actions are spontaneously the same."<ref name="Book of Five Rings">Miyamoto Musashi: [https://archive.org/details/MiyamotoMusashi-BookOfFiveRingsgoRinNoSho/page/n23/mode/2up Book of Five Rings - The Water Book]</ref>
** According to Musashi's ''{{w|The Book of Five Rings}}'' (translated by Victor Harris), "In this method, when the enemy attacks and you decide to attack, hit with your body, and hit with your spirit, and hit from the Void with your hands, accelerating strongly. This is the "No Design, No Conception" cut. This is the most important method of hitting. It is often used. You must train hard to understand it."<ref name="Book of Five Rings" />
* Ei's (alleged) past fondness for Shiba dogs is most likely a reference to {{w|Tokugawa Tsunayoshi}}, the fifth shogun of the Edo Bakufu (Tokugawa Shogunate). He was nicknamed as {{Lang|the Dog Shogun|ja=犬公方|ja_rm=Inu-Kubou}} because of his eagerness to enact animal protection laws.
