:'''Lanoire:''' I don't know what sort of cake Cater likes...
:{{DIcon}} Cake?
::'''Lanoire:''' Oh, I was just wondering what flavor of cake I should make for Cater's birthday!
::'''Lanoire:''' ...Because now that I think about it, Cater always gives me food, but I don't know what he likes to eat.
::'''Lanoire:''' Does he like Bulle Fruit? Or Sunsettia? Actually, since he's that color, maybe he likes Mint?
::'''Lanoire:''' But, more importantly, I've gotta find Cater. Wait for me to grow up, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, and we'll go look for him together.
