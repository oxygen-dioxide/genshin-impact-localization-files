:'''Changsheng:''' Well, you got your work cut out for you today seeing how you sent Herbalist Gui off to get some rest.
:'''Baizhu:''' There were far too many patients in the days before. Poor Herbalist Gui was running himself ragged to help me accommodate them.
:'''Baizhu:''' Keeping yourself healthy will let you help more people. Even if he says he doesn't want to rest, I won't accept it.
:'''Changsheng:''' You're one to talk. What about you?
:'''Baizhu:''' Ah. It's of no worry. The medicine I need to prepare is of a manageable amount. We can't keep patients waiting.
:'''Baizhu:''' That said, Bubu Pharmacy should indeed recruit some new apprentices. I wonder what Qiqi made of our fliers.
