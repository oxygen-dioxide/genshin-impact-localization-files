:'''Thurel:''' My, oh my. How many years have I been retired again?
:{{DIcon}} What were you working as before?
::'''Thurel:''' I was previously with the [[Garde]]s, and later, my technique with a gun saw me join the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol for a time.
::'''Thurel:''' Still later, I switched departments several times. I no longer remember what happened exactly.
::'''Thurel:''' *sigh* The older I get, the less able I am to remember things that happened recently...
::'''Thurel:''' The thing that left the deepest impression, surprisingly, was the job I was at the shortest &mdash; that happened when I was sent underwater as a guard by the [[Palais Mermonia]].
::{{DIcon}} By underwater, you {{sic|mean.}}
::'''Thurel:''' Yes, I refer to the [[Fortress of Meropide]].
::'''Thurel:''' Well, it is true that those who have never been there would never use such terms as "above water" or "underwater" in that fashion. Few guards sent down there last very long.
::'''Thurel:''' The environment there really cannot be called good, and there are conflicts between gangs of criminals, too, so we don't integrate well.
::'''Thurel:''' I've heard that a new manager was appointed who laid down a great number of new rules that have made the guards' jobs much easier.
::'''Thurel:''' But I'd long transferred out by then &mdash; Guess you could say that the timings didn't match up.
:{{DIcon}} Do you need help counting?
::'''Thurel:''' Haha, no, no, I'm just reflecting on certain realities, that's all. Thank you.
