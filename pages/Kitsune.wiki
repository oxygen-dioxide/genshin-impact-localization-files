'''Kitsune''' is a type of fox in [[Inazuma]] which can be found both as [[Wildlife]] and as a pet for the [[Serenitea Pot]].

Outdoor creatures, as the name implies, can only be placed in outdoor spaces within the Serenitea Pot.

==Drops==
Unlike other foxes in [[Teyvat]], kitsunes cannot be killed. They are passive to the player and will bark then run away and disappear if the player attempts to hurt them, behaving much like dogs.

Just like cats and dogs, approaching one for the first time will add this creature's entry into your in-game [[archive]].

==Powers and Abilities==
Kitsune possess mythical abilities such as shapeshifting.

==History==
According to [[Toki Alley Tales]], the kitsune came to the archipelago of [[Inazuma]] from mainland Teyvat, fighting a war against the island's native [[tanuki]] for the land. Although the war is claimed to have ended in a draw, the tanuki had to cede the [[Sacred Sakura]] and [[Mt. Yougou]] to the kitsune.

A prominent kitsune clan was the [[Hakushin Clan]], named after its matriarch [[Hakushin]]. She dwelt on Mt. Yougou and had six apprentices, the eldest of whom was the troublemaking "Black Fox" Itaru.<ref>{{Ref/Book|New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune|2}}</ref> The [[Kitsune Saiguu]], who was worshipped as a kitsune goddess, was a member of the Hakushin Clan. She was [[Ei]]'s companion for a time, up until she was absorbed and killed by the dark forces during the [[cataclysm]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Hakushin Ring}}</ref> The unsullied parts of her memories coalesced into [[Hanachirusato]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Yougou Cleansing}}</ref>

==Classification==
According to Yae Miko, the kitsunes are divided in grades, the highest being the Sky Kitsunes (such as herself), while two grades lower than them there are the Yakan kitsunes.<ref>{{Ref/Talent|Yakan Evocation: Sesshou Sakura}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*{{Lang|''Kitsune''|ja=狐}} is Japanese for "fox," or more specifically, the {{w|red fox}} (binomen: ''Vulpes vulpes''). Since the Japanese folklore has a variety of fox legends, the English word "{{w|kitsune}}" mainly refers to Japanese fox spirits to emphasize this aspect, although the original Japanese word ''kitsune'' does not have such a connotation.
*The original Chinese version uses a word that simply means "fox," as well as Japanese and Korean versions. Thus in Teyvat, the most common sense of "fox" may be the kitsune (rather than the [[Crimson Fox|crimson fox]]), just as in the real world, the word "fox" usually refers to the red fox.
