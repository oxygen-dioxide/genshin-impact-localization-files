|description = A sly, prideful creature that has incredible intelligence and a long-lasting memory &mdash; or so the urban legends say.<br>They pay no attention when someone approaches, seemingly used to living alongside mankind.<br>The kitsune have a long history in Inazuman culture. Some legends say that they were family to the [[Kitsune Saiguu]] in ages past. After she disappeared, the mightier [[Sky Kitsune Statue|Sky Kitsune]] and [[Earth Kitsune Statue|Earth Kitsune]] turned into stone statues to await her return. As their kind slowly dwindled, the Kitsune lost their mystical might, and now no longer speak.

'''Kitsune''' is a type of fox that can be found in [[Inazuma]]. They cannot be killed, but approaching one for the first time will add this creature's entry to the in-game [[archive]].

==Locations==
Kitsune can be found at [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Subarea)|Grand Narukami Shrine]] and just outside of [[Inazuma City]].

See the [https://act.hoyolab.com/ys/app/interactive-map/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=287 Official Interactive Map] for specific locations.

==Trivia==
* {{Lang|''Kitsune''|ja=狐}} is Japanese for "fox," or more specifically, the {{w|red fox}} (binomen: ''Vulpes vulpes''). Since the Japanese folklore has a variety of fox legends, the English word "{{w|kitsune}}" mainly refers to Japanese fox spirits to emphasize this aspect, although the original Japanese word ''kitsune'' does not have such a connotation.
* The original Chinese version uses a word that simply means "fox," as well as Japanese and Korean versions. Thus in Teyvat, the most common sense of "fox" may be the kitsune (rather than the [[Crimson Fox|crimson fox]]), just as in the real world, the word "fox" usually refers to the red fox.
