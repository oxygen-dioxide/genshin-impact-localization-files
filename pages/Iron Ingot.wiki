'''Iron Ingot''' {{Lang|zh=铁块儿|zh_rm=Tiě Kuài'er}} is an [[NPC]] in [[Liyue]]. He is a miner, but due to the mine at [[the Chasm]] being sealed off, he has some free time. He can be found at nighttime in [[Dunyu Ruins]], near to the [[Statue of the Seven]] statue, "studying" astronomy with [[Ziwei]].

Following a certain dialogue branch for the first time gives the player five [[Enhancement Ore]]s.

{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Iron Ingot:''' Hello, how are you?
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
:;(Before completing ???)
:::'''Iron Ingot:''' Actually the mine at [[the Chasm]] has been sealed off. I have nothing to do at the moment.
:;(After completing ???)
:::'''Iron Ingot:''' Actually, the mine at the Chasm hasn't been fully reopened yet, so I have nothing to do at the moment.
::'''Iron Ingot:''' So I came here to study some astronomy from this nice lady. Learn something new, you know.
::'''Iron Ingot:''' Take a look... Doesn't it look amazing from this angle...
::{{DIcon}} You like star gazing too?
::'''Iron Ingot:''' I sure do! Just because I'm a miner with not much education doesn't mean I'm any less curious about the night sky than you!
::'''Iron Ingot:''' Look at this one... So exquisitely composed, so graceful and lovely... Awesome.
:::{{DIcon}} Are you talking about the constellations?
::::'''Iron Ingot:''' Nah, who's looking at the constellations...
::::'''Iron Ingot:''' I mean, yes! That's right, the constellations!
::::'''Iron Ingot:''' Look at that constellation, Mysterious Adeptus of the Highest Heaven Soaring Across the Skies. Don't you think it looks like... Y'know?
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} You're not talking about the constellations, are you?
::::'''Iron Ingot:''' Hey, cut that out! Can't you see I'm watching the... uh, stars, very intently!?
::::'''Iron Ingot:''' Or would you like to follow... I mean, would you like to learn about astronomy from [[Ziwei|this lady]]?
::::'''Iron Ingot:''' Shoo, shoo! First come, first served, don't you get it? Now take these ores and scram, and stop disturbing our star-gazing!
:::;(Obtain [[Enhancement Ore]] ×5)
:{{DIcon}} ...Bye.
::'''Iron Ingot:''' Goodbye, take care now!
::'''Iron Ingot:''' It's so beautiful...
