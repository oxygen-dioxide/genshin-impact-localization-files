|description  = A puppet joint obtained from the [[Plane of Euthymia]]. The gesture here symbolizes the concept that "one sees and one does."<br />Even now that "she" has become a calamitous deity, she can still utilize such transcendent gestures, her sword flashing forth as swiftly as her eyes may see.<br />And yet, as the countless disasters ground on for far too long, the fierce general's shell had to embrace a new spring.
