==Personality==
{{Quote|Every citizen of Mondstadt adores Barbara. However, she learned the word "idol" from a magazine.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
The Deaconess of the [[Church of Favonius]], [[Barbara]]. She's hardworking, bright, charismatic, and optimistic, yet may be clumsy sometimes. The sight of the Idol of [[Mondstadt]] makes everyone have something of a "second wind" and become motivated.

Even after being a successful figure in Mondstadt, she feels doubt and feels disillusioned whenever thinking of the duration of one's smile on other's faces after hearing her song. Her desire for fame and recognition changed into the desire to help others in times of need. Though depressed, she cheers herself back up, not letting herself be down or depressed for 30 seconds.

She feels inferior to her "big sister" [[Jean]], thinking everything she's done is of inferior nature to the Acting Grand Master and strives to do something that surpasses Jean's deeds at least once. She's the deaconess of the church, meaning she safeguards religious artifacts and worships [[Barbatos]], although obliviously unaware that she has met [[Venti|him]].

"The best magic is diligence."

<nowiki>===============================</nowiki>

Barbara, the Deaconess of the Knights of Favonius, is a shining starlet beloved by the people of Mondstadt.

Her Hydro power is the best remedy for a wound, just like her soothing singing and dancing is solace to a weary heart.

The people of Mondstadt all think Barbara has some kind of magical power that can heal both the wounds and the heart, but only Barbara herself knows that the secret of such magic is diligence.

"Read this, it contains everything you will need to know."</p><p>"Idol Magazine" was the name of the assigned reading material. Barbara had no idea what world this magazine had come from, but by reading it she found out that there was indeed such thing as an "idol," and that it mainly involved working hard at getting everyone to like you.</p><p>She also discovered that an outstanding idol is capable of not just bringing joy to themselves, but also bringing spiritual healing to others through the power of song and dance.</p><p>Barbara set about learning one new song after another, dancing to the beat as she went. Finally, she found happiness, and she found it in the smiling faces of others.</p><p>Some time later, when Alice anxiously relayed to Barbara that plans for "Teyvat Idols!" were falling through, Barbara was starting to make a name for herself through her performances in Mondstadt.</p><p>"Hmm... Well, if I'm the only one left... I guess you can leave it to me to define what it really means to be an idol!"</p><p>Driven by this ever so slightly selfish ambition to spread joy and healing to others, Barbara is slyly swotting up on new tunes behind the scenes to this very day.</p>

After quickly realizing that she barely knew any of the words, she had to resort to humming the tune instead.</p><p>Nevertheless, her voice began to soothe the child, and so she kept singing. She sang the same song, over and over again, until her throat was dry and her voice was hoarse. Finally, the boy fell asleep. Exhausted, Barbara lay down by the wall and fell straight asleep herself.</p><p>Early the next morning, Barbara awoke to discover that the boy's fever had come down. Perhaps it was because she had sung for him, or perhaps it had something to do with the Vision which had mysteriously appeared next to her hand at some point during the night.</p><p>Barbara was not preoccupied with the Vision, however. It was the sight of the boy smiling once again that filled her heart with joy.</p><p>Barbara received her Vision for the simple but beautiful wish that took hold in her heart that night: A dream of healing the sick through the power of song.</p>

==Trivia==
* The tune that Barbara hums in her idle in English, Chinese, and Japanese appears in other media pertaining to her. (The Korean version has a different tune entirely.) All appearances so far, including in Barbara's idles, appear to be in C major.
** The tune appears on the music staff on [[Barbara/Media#In-Game Assets|Barbara's wish art]]. However, the lowest note is likely missing a {{w|ledger line}}. In addition, the highest note (C-flat, the {{w|enharmonic equivalent}} of B) does not appear in any other version of the tune; all other versions use B-flat or C. Due to the presence of the flat, it is likely that the highest note on the staff is intended to be B-flat.
*** The assets for the staff and the notes, including the joined sixteenth and eighth notes and the highest note with a flat, are reused in all three parts of [[Barbara: Flow]], but without denoting any tune.
** The tune is featured throughout the [https://youtu.be/vv_JnSwFp0A Version 1.4 "Invitation of Windblume" Trailer] as well as the music when Barbara is shown in the final cinematic of [[Invitation of Windblume]], [https://youtu.be/HRksKER0Ies?t=52 "Floral Breeze" - Scenes from Windblume Festival] (0:52 to 0:59).
*** Notably, the tune in the trailer and cinematic has a {{w|minor seventh}} between the last two notes like in the Chinese version of Barbara's idle, instead of an octave like in the English version of Barbara's idle, with the exception of the final tune at the end of the first half of the trailer, which ends with an octave like the English version. (The Japanese version of Barbara's idle does not finish the tune.)
*** The rhythm in the trailer and cinematic has {{w|Swing_(jazz_performance_style)|swung notes}} like in the English version of Barbara's idle, instead of straight notes like in the Chinese version of Barbara's idle.
* Barbara is currently the only four-star character that has a close-up cut-in when using her Elemental Burst, much like five-star characters.
* Barbara's favorite food is spicy dried fish, while her least favorite foods are anything bitter.
** Barbara's love for spicy food is renowned throughout Mondstadt &mdash; though, according to [[Vile]], [[Jueyun Chili]]s from [[Liyue]] would be spicy enough to make even her cry.
* Barbara shares her English voice actress, Laura Stahl, with [[Xinyan]].
** Other similarities they share are a love for spicy food, as well as being musicians who have amassed their own fanbases despite performing songs that defied their countries' traditional forms of music.
* Barbara was one of the first two characters to get a themed outfit, the other being [[Jean]].
