'''Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo''' was a video released by official ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' media on July 11, 2022. It teased the storyline of the [[Archon Quests]] and marked the first in-person appearances of the eight remaining [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]] who had not yet been seen in-game at the time of the video's release.

The video depicts a gathering of the remaining Eleven Fatui Harbingers, minus [[Scaramouche]], to mourn the passing of the eighth Fatui Harbinger [[La Signora]] (real name Rosalyne-Kruzchka Lohefalter).

==Trivia==
* The soundtrack featured in the video is [[Elogia Cinerosa]] from the album ''[[The Shimmering Voyage Vol. 2]]''.
* The character designs and voice actors for most of the Fatui Harbingers were released in this video, excluding Signora, Tartaglia, and Scaramouche, who were already met in-game.
** While Dottore appeared in the [[manga]], which is set before the game's events, both his appearance and manner of speaking are extremely different from his previous appearance.
** Columbina was the only Harbinger who was never mentioned in any official ''Genshin Impact'' media before ''Lazzo'' was released: Arlecchino, Capitano, Dottore, Pantalone, and Pierro were all mentioned through in-game dialogue and [[Pale Flame]]'s artifact descriptions; Sandrone was mentioned in the video description of Tartaglia's [[Character Teaser]]; Pulcinella was the featured character for Snezhnaya's chapter preview in ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]''; and Signora, Tartaglia, and Scaramouche were introduced in-game during [[Version 1.0]] and [[Version 1.1]].
* Pierro's first lines in the video, "The sages think themselves to be all-knowing, but we alone are wise to the virtue in those acts of folly," was first used in a [https://bbs.mihoyo.com/ys/article/2494569 Chinese-exclusive blog post] posted on November 2, 2020, which revealed the icons related to the Harbingers. (The image was also used as the background for Tartaglia's Character Card and later, for [[Lyney]]'s, [[Lynette]]'s and [[Freminet]]'s Character Card in their reintroduction as Fatui.)
* The chessboard that Pierro was playing on may depict a position from {{w|Deep_Blue_versus_Kasparov,_1996,_Game_1|a real chess game}} between {{w|Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue}} and {{w|Garry Kasparov}}.<ref>Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/vwkrsc/what_if_i_told_you_that_this_is_not_the_queen/ WHAT IF I told you... that this is not the Queen?]</ref>
