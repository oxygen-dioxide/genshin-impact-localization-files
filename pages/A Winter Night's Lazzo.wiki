'''Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo''' was a video released by official ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' media on July 11, 2022. It teased the storyline of the [[Archon Quests]] and marked the first in-person appearances of the eight remaining [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]] as of the start of the game's events.

The video depicts a gathering of the remaining Eleven Fatui Harbingers, minus [[Scaramouche]], to mourn the passing of the eighth Fatui Harbinger [[La Signora]] (real name Rosalyne-Kruzchka Lohefalter).

==Description==
No one knows how long it has been since all the Fatui Harbingers last gathered.<br />
On this winter night, people donning masks who had just been singing and squabbling, fell silent in mournful meditation.<br />
Only then did the hall join the winter sky in infinite silence.

Meanwhile, in distant [[Sumeru]], [[Collei]] who has not had dreams for a long time, saw strange visions during her midday nap...

==Transcript==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Pierro:''' The sages think themselves to be all-knowing
:'''Pierro:''' But we alone are wise to the virtue in those acts of folly
:'''Pierro:''' In this war, not even a single pawn may be spared...
:'''Pierro:''' Because on this chessboard, "checkmate" is not where the game ends
:'''Pulcinella:''' We are gathered here today to remember our dear comrade
:'''Pulcinella:''' In honor of her sacrifice, all work should halt for half a day as the nation mourns her passing
:'''Pantalone:''' Hehe, merely half a day...
:'''Pantalone:''' People say the [[Northland Bank]]'s true currencies are blood and tears...
:'''Pantalone:''' But Mayor, even speaking as a banker, that sounds a little unconscionable
:'''Arlecchino:''' Rosalyne died in a foreign land...
:'''Arlecchino:''' But you heartless businessmen and dignitaries
:'''Arlecchino:''' Always with a convenient excuse to remain in the comfort of your homeland...
:'''Arlecchino:''' You couldn't hope to understand
:'''Arlecchino:''' So why don't you keep your mouths shut!
:'''Arlecchino:''' We don't want to make the children cry...
:'''Tartaglia:''' Hey, c'mon now, even I don't think this is the right time or place for a fight
:'''Sandrone:''' Utterly risible!
:'''Capitano:''' Though her methods tarnished her honor, Lohefalter's sacrifice is a great pity
:'''Capitano:''' Her loss shall not hinder our progress. But Dottore...
:'''Capitano:''' What of Scaramouche and the Gnosis from [[Inazuma]]?
:'''Dottore:''' Conventional wisdom holds that Divine Knowledge cannot be rationally comprehended
:'''Dottore:''' After conquering the Divine Gaze, he will make his next move
:'''Pierro:''' It's time to end tonight's foolish theatrics. Right now, you have no captive audience
:'''Pierro:''' Let every worthy sacrifice be carved in ice, and with this nation endure for all time
:'''Pierro:''' In the name of Her Majesty, the [[Tsaritsa]], we will seize authority from the gods...
:'''Pierro:''' Absolute peace
:'''Pierro:''' Such is the gift from the Tsaritsa, such is Her Majesty's benevolence
:'''Pierro:''' Now you rest in this coffin, encased in layer upon layer of ice
:'''Pierro:''' But, Rosalyne, I promise you...
:'''Pierro:''' Your final resting place will be the entirety of the "Old World"...
;(Scene fades to black)
:'''Columbina:''' I must say, you're looking very young today, Doctor
:'''Dottore:''' You know very well that I do not take that as a compliment
:'''Columbina:''' So, where's the Segment in the prime of his life, then?
;(Scene transitions from black screen to another Dottore standing before a burning tree)
:'''Dottore:''' Heh, he's busy with... a little experiment in "blasphemy"
;(Collei wakes up, distressed)
:'''Tighnari:''' Collei, time to head out on patrol
:'''Collei:''' Ah, okay, Master Tighnari!
:'''Collei:''' What was that...

==Trivia==
* The character designs and voice actors for most of the Fatui Harbingers were released in this video, excluding Signora, Tartaglia, and Scaramouche, who were already met in-game.
** While Dottore appeared in the [[manga]], which is set before the game's events, both his appearance and manner of speaking are extremely different from his previous appearance.
** Columbina was the only Harbinger who was never mentioned in any official ''Genshin Impact'' media before ''Lazzo'' was released: Arlecchino, Capitano, Dottore, Pantalone, and Pierro were all mentioned through in-game dialogue and [[Pale Flame]]'s artifact descriptions; Sandrone was mentioned in the video description of Tartaglia's [[Character Teaser]]; Pulcinella was the featured character for Snezhnaya's chapter preview in ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]''; and Signora, Tartaglia, and Scaramouche were introduced in-game during [[Version 1.0]] and [[Version 1.1]].
* Pierro's first lines in the video, "The sages think themselves to be all-knowing, but we alone are wise to the virtue in those acts of folly," was first used in a [https://bbs.mihoyo.com/ys/article/2494569 Chinese-exclusive blog post] posted on November 2, 2020, which revealed the icons related to the Harbingers. (The image was also used as the background for Tartaglia's Character Card.)
* The chessboard that Pierro was playing on may depict a position from {{w|Deep_Blue_versus_Kasparov,_1996,_Game_1|a real chess game}} between {{w|Deep Blue}} and {{w|Garry Kasparov}}.<ref>Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/vwkrsc/what_if_i_told_you_that_this_is_not_the_queen/ WHAT IF I told you... that this is not the Queen?]</ref>

===Etymology===
* ''{{w|Lazzi}}'', singular term ''lazzo'', are stock comedic routines that are associated with ''commedia dell'arte''. The Harbingers are named after stock characters in ''commedia dell'arte''.
