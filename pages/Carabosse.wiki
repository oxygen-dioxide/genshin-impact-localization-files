{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Carabosse:''' Hehe. It seems that the [["Hey, This Isn't Pumpkin Soup..."|Truesight Potion]] has been marvelously successful. I think that quite a few [[Enhanced "Truesight Potion"|enhanced formulas]] can be made, too... Vere can decide their exact proportions, I suppose.
:'''Carabosse:''' Hmm? What is it? Would you like any potions made by yours truly?
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about potion-making...
::'''Carabosse:''' Well now, to think that you'd be interested in such. I suppose you're also one enthralled by "possibility." Good, good.
::'''Carabosse:''' You see, in potion-making...
::'''Carabosse:''' You process ingredients that don't have any effects on their own, mix them together, and they'll turn into potions that can work in lots of different ways!
::'''Carabosse:''' It is a deed akin to using the impression things have given you in your memories, and combining them with flashes of inspiration to create new "realities."
::'''Carabosse:''' Even I do not know what the potioning possibilities are! This is the excitement of being a potioneer.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about your assistant...
::'''Carabosse:''' Oh, you mean Vere. She's an earnest girl, and she's been a great help to me in measuring potion proportions and conducting experiments.
::'''Carabosse:''' She's the only one who can help me complete said experiments...
::'''Carabosse:''' Ah, yes &mdash; she also names some of the products, the Truesight Potion being amongst them.
::'''Carabosse:''' That said, I do think that she's too straight-laced in her naming sense. I think something like my "Coasty-Toasty Potion" is cutesier...
:{{DIcon}} No, I'm just passing through.
::'''Carabosse:''' Ah, and here I thought you were going to test the potions. Oh well... Err, I mean, you're always welcome to drop by!

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* Carabosse is a staple name for wicked fairies and evil witches in fairytales.
** The name Carabosse first appeared in {{w|Madame d'Aulnoy}}'s 1697 fairytale ''{{w|The Princess Mayblossom}}'', where Carabosse is an ugly and old wicked fairy who curses a newborn princess, who is called Verenata in some versions of the tale.
** Incidentally, there is another Melusine called [[Verenata]], who serves as the "Master Potioneer" Carabosse's assistant.
