{{Lang|'''Bonanus'''|zh=伐难|zh_rm=Fánàn}}, also known as {{lang|'''General Chizapus'''|zh=螺卷大将|zh_lit=General Curled Snail}}, was an [[adeptus]] and one of the five foremost [[Yaksha]]s.

==Profile==
Like the other yakshas, Bonanus answered [[Morax]]'s summons to fight the demons that spawned from the remains of defeated gods during and after the [[Archon War]]. Of the many yakshas, Bonanus was one of the five strongest alongside [[Bosacius]], [[Indarias]], [[Menogias]], and [[Xiao|Alatus]].<ref>{{Ref/Book|Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti}}</ref>

Like most of the other yakshas, Bonanus eventually succumbed to the karmic debt accrued from endless slaughter. She and Menogias are implied to have killed each other in a battle.
