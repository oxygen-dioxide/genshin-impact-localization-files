'''Bonanus''', also known as '''General Chizapus''', was an [[adeptus]] and one of the five foremost [[Yaksha]]s.

==Profile==
Like the other yakshas, Bonanus answered [[Morax]]'s summons to fight the demons that spawned from the remains of defeated gods during and after the [[Archon War]]. Of the many yakshas, Bonanus was one of the five strongest alongside [[Bosacius]], [[Indarias]], [[Menogias]], and [[Xiao|Alatus]].<ref>{{Ref/Book|Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti}}</ref>

Like most of the other yakshas, Bonanus eventually succumbed to the karmic debt accrued from endless slaughter. She and Menogias are implied to have killed each other in a battle.

==Trivia==
* All other voice actors of the yakshas with uncertain identities have confirmed their credited yakshas and their corresponding elements on Twitter,<ref>Twitter: [https://twitter.com/11tonsama/status/1532567284946186240 Indarias' VA]</ref><ref>Twitter: [https://twitter.com/shu1_qz/status/1532479290809659392 Menogias' VA]</ref> leaving Bonanus as the Hydro Yaksha.

===Etymology===
* Her Chinese title {{Lang|zh=螺卷大将}} literally means "General Curled Sea Snail."
