'''Bonanus''', also known as '''General Chizapus''', was an [[adeptus]] and one of the five foremost [[Yaksha]]s.

==Profile==
Along with the other yakshas, Bonanus answered [[Morax]]'s summons to fight the demons that spawned from the remains of defeated gods during and after the [[Archon War]]. Of the many yakshas, Bonanus was one of the five strongest alongside [[Bosacius]], [[Indarias]], [[Menogias]], and [[Xiao|Alatus]].<ref>{{Ref/Book|Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti}}</ref>

It is said by [[Xianyun]] that Menogias once made her a dress for one of many meetings with other adepti, which she secretly complained about due to how it would hinder her in battle due to how long it was.<ref>Event [[Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze]] Quest: Part 3: ''[[A Cloud-Sea Appeal, a Brilliance Revealed (Quest)|A Cloud-Sea Appeal, a Brilliance Revealed]]''</ref>

Like most of her fellow yakshas, Bonanus eventually succumbed to karmic debt. It is implied that she and Menogias killed each other in a battle.
