{{Lang|'''Zapolyarny Palace'''|ru=Заполярный дворец|ru_rm=Zapolyarnyy dvorets|ru_tl=Outpolar Palace}} is a palace in [[Snezhnaya]] from which the [[Tsaritsa]], the current [[Cryo]] [[Archon]] and ruler of Snezhnaya, reigns.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref> The [[Fatui]] diplomats hail from Zapolyarny Palace and were sent from there by the Tsaritsa to enact her will throughout [[Teyvat]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Tales of Winter}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* When [[Venti]] mentions the palace during [[Ending Note]], the English language subtitles refer to it as Zapolyarny Palace, while in the audio he calls it the "Winter Palace." The {{w|Winter Palace}} is a palace in Russia that served as the official residence of the Tsar/Tsaritsa until the fall of imperial rule.
