|description    = A modestly tall plant.<br />Allegedly, Outriders can make camouflage from the branches of this plant and use them to conceal their movements when approaching monsters, hence its name "Concealing Leaves."<br />When asked about this, however, the [[Amber|current Outrider]] said that she had never heard of this before.
