==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You and Paimon meet two old friends at Port Ormos. They seem to be preparing for a game of some sort...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach [[Haniyyah]] and [[Balfour]]'s stall)
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Look, {{Traveler}}, there's a new stall over there!
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go take a look at it, shall we?

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Haniyyah, optional)
:'''Haniyyah:''' (After we finish with the work here, we also have to make haste and place our orders to purchase the materials we need to expand our camp, along with new bedding and a small dining table for our fungal friends, and a climbing frame for them to play with...)

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Balfour, optional)
:'''Balfour:''' (When we officially begin promoting Fungus Mechanicus, we will need to set up more advertisements...)

;(Talk to Haniyyah or Balfour)
:'''Haniyyah:''' Golden Comet and Silver Companion... We meet again.
:'''Haniyyah:''' As spirited as ever, I see!
:{{DIcon}} You look quite spry yourself.
::'''Paimon:''' H&mdash;Haniyyah! And Balfour, too!
::'''Paimon:''' Fancy running into both of you here!
:{{DIcon}} Who are you again?
::'''Paimon:''' Oh, come on, {{Traveler}}, what are you on about?
::'''Paimon:''' We took part in the [[Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament]], didn't we? It was great fun hanging out with our shroom buddies!
::'''Paimon:''' We met Haniyyah then, and Balfour was the previous event's most responsible staff member.
::'''Paimon:''' Wait, have you forgotten [[Bongo-Head]] and [[Twirly-Whirly]] too?
::{{DIcon}} Ooh, I remember now!
::{{DIcon}} Heh, I was just pullin' your leg.
::'''Paimon:''' What? C'mon! Paimon was about to fetch a doctor or something!
:'''Paimon:''' Well, back to the point, then. What are the two of you doing here? If Paimon still remembers correctly, this was where we could get those Floral Jellies...
:'''Balfour:''' Ah, out two great heroes! Your voices alone swell my confidence greatly.
:'''Balfour:''' Well then, I shall proceed to give my report on the results of our work.
:'''Balfour:''' Previously, the two of you declared that the [[Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament]] should be suspended for a time while the [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]] improves the design of the [[Wisdom Orb]].
:'''Balfour:''' I believe the two of you are still waiting for notice concerning that?
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, that's right! [[Layla]], [[Cyno]], or the researchers responsible should inform us if there's any progress, right?
:{{DIcon}} Not that you'd understand their technical jargon much.
:{{DIcon}} Not that I'd have a lot of suggestions for them.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, that's kinda how it is. We wouldn't be much help. We'd probably hinder them, really...
:'''Balfour:''' Ah, how meticulous, how forbearing of you. I, for one, practically brim over with excitement when I consider the grand scenes from the previous tournament...
:'''Balfour:''' So, I attempted to ask some of the related Akademiya staff recently to get some details&mdash;
:'''Balfour:''' At present, improvements to the Wisdom Orb are still being put through their theoretical stages. In other words, any practical production will takes some time yet.
:'''Balfour:''' However, the once-heated discussions around the first iteration of the event are decreasing by the day, and the tournament itself is being forgotten, even if slowly. We cannot allow the influence of the previous event to be wasted.
:'''Balfour:''' As such, I've teamed up with Ms. Haniyyah here to organize a "thematic event."
:{{DIcon}} What does "thematic event" mean, exactly?
:'''Paimon:''' Is that what these Fungus-shaped pieces on the table are for?
:'''Haniyyah:''' That's right.
:'''Haniyyah:''' Mr. Balfour has been looking for sponsors as part of organizing the next tournament, and he has even sought to learn some marketing skills from [[Liyue]].
:'''Haniyyah:''' While doing that, he encountered a certain game known as [[Theater Mechanicus]].
:'''Haniyyah:''' Subsequently, he bought the [[Sumeru]] franchising rights for that game, and put together an all-new game with me as a consultant.
:'''Haniyyah:''' We call it "Fungus Mechanicus."
:'''Paimon:''' Fungus Mechanicus, huh?
:'''Paimon:''' Let Paimon guess... So are we gonna take command of various shrooms to duke it out with some machines?
:'''Balfour:''' Haha! You are indeed insightful, Silver Companion. Got it in one!
:'''Balfour:''' It is my belief that this game is easy to understand and promote, and has great potential that is worth exploring.
:'''Balfour:''' If we can successfully market it as a spin-off to the Beast Tamers Tournament, we can allow the latter to stick in people's minds in the long term.
:'''Balfour:''' That way, the next tournament we hold will attract a larger audience and a larger pool of contestants.
:'''Balfour:''' Of course, this can only go ahead with your permission. After all, you have the final say on how the tournament will be organized.
:{{DIcon}} I think it's worth a shot.
:{{DIcon}} You've really worked hard on this, haven't you?
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, well, neither {{Traveler}} nor Paimon really know all that much about doing business, but Paimon thinks you've got a good point there, Balfour!
:'''Paimon:''' You and Haniyyah have been working on this together, and Paimon believes in the two of you, so go right ahead!
:'''Paimon:''' We haven't played the game yet, but Paimon bets that loads of people will love it!
:'''Balfour:''' Wonderful! Since the two of you have agreed, I can go ahead and promote Fungus Mechanicus.
:'''Balfour:''' The game is in its testing stages at the moment, so we still need to invite people to play-test it and collect their feedback so that we can make further improvements.
:'''Balfour:''' And I'm sure that you, who've surely encountered all manner of popular games throughout Teyvat, will come up with the best suggestions of them all!
:'''Paimon:''' Let's do it, {{Traveler}}! This is one of your strongest points, after all!
:{{DIcon}} Why do I get the feeling that you're commanding me to...
:{{DIcon}} Alright! Golden Comet's about to strike!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe! But before that, Paimon's got a question for you, Haniyyah...
:'''Haniyyah:''' Do you mean to ask about Bongo-Head and the others?
:'''Paimon:''' That's right! Paimon misses our shroom buddies. How are they doing?
:'''Haniyyah:''' Don't you worry, they're going great &mdash; and living carefree as can be, too.
:'''Haniyyah:''' Twirly-Whirly and [[Blitzara]] are currently staying at my {{Color|buzzword|temporary residence in northern Port Ormos}}. One of the previous contestants is taking care of them.
:'''Haniyyah:''' Bongo-Head and [[Kindlejoy]] are nearby. If you'd like, Silver Companion, you can go play with them.
:'''Paimon:''' Nearby, you say! Well then, {{Traveler}}, Paimon will go look for Bongo-Head while you play-test later, alright?
:{{DIcon}} Off you go, off you go!
:{{DIcon}} I'll join you shortly.
:'''Balfour:''' Well then, let's not lose any time. Come, Golden Comet, the early test build of Fungus Mechanicus is ready for you!
:;(Opens Fungus Mechanicus Menu)

;(Talk to Balfour again before completing the first stage)
:'''Balfour:''' Well then, let's not lose any time. Come, Golden Comet, the internal test build of Fungus Mechanicus is ready for you!
:;(Opens Fungus Mechanicus Menu)

;(Talk to Kindlejoy or Bongo-Head before completing the first stage and talking to Haniyyah and Balfour)<!--i.e., completing first stage + before talking to Haniyyah and Balfour = still this dialogue-->
:'''Paimon:''' Hey there, Bongo-Head, Kindlejoy! What shall we play today?
:'''Bongo-Head:''' ♪~
:'''Kindlejoy:''' ♫~
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, hang on, hang on, let Paimon try to guess what you're trying to say!
----
;(Talk to Balfour or Haniyyah after completing the first stage)
:'''Balfour:''' How was it, Golden Comet? How did your first taste of Fungus Mechanicus gameplay go?
:'''Haniyyah:''' Judging by your expression, I suppose you haven't come to a conclusion yet.
:{{DIcon}} I only went for one round, after all.
:{{DIcon}} I'll need to conduct further testing.
:'''Balfour:''' That is true. With this little test content, it is indeed rather difficult to judge the strengths and flaws of Fungus Mechanicus.
:'''Balfour:''' Don't you worry. Ms. Haniyyah and I will be here for a while, and we'll have one new Mechanicus stage for you every day &mdash; seven in total.
:'''Balfour:''' Come over whenever you have the time, and you'll get the opportunity to test those stages!
:'''Balfour:''' Although you are the overall overseer in these matters, this game was something that Ms. Haniyyah and I came up with of our own accord &mdash; so this is an expenditure of time that lies outside your plans.
:'''Balfour:''' As such, a fee will be provided to you for services rendered!
:{{DIcon}} Haha, well, I won't say no to that.
:{{DIcon}} You'll see that Mora back next time we run this tournament!
:'''Balfour:''' Haha, very straightforward! I like it!
:'''Haniyyah:''' I've applied for the two Fungi to be furnished with sufficient residence privileges, so they'll be here in Port Ormos throughout Fungus Mechanicus's testing phase.
:'''Haniyyah:''' Your Silver Companion can spend more time with Bongo-Head, too.
:{{DIcon}} Good for Paimon!
:{{DIcon}} I can't wait either!
:'''Haniyyah:''' Hehe, yes, you should go see Bongo-Head as well. It misses you, you know?
:'''Haniyyah:''' Bring this with you. You can feed Bongo-Head and Kindlejoy with it &mdash; it's their favorite.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Haniyyah's Gift of Marvelous Jellies}})

;(Talk to Haniyyah or Balfour again)
:'''Haniyyah:''' You should go see Bongo-Head as well. It misses you, you know?
----
;(Talk to [[Bongo-Head]] or [[Kindlejoy]])
:'''Paimon:''' C'mon, Bongo-Head, let's play a clapping game!
:'''Paimon:''' C'mon, Kindlejoy, let's dance with Bongo-Head!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... We've gotten pretty familiar with Kindlejoy, but we still can't quite communicate as well with it as we can with Bongo-Head...
:{{DIcon}} You're a real happy bean, eh, Paimon?
:{{DIcon}} I'm enjoying this, too.
:'''Paimon:''' You're here, {{Traveler}}!
:'''Paimon:''' How are things going with the Fungus Mechanicus trials?
:{{DIcon}} The test period will still be on for a while yet.
:{{DIcon}} We can play with them every day before it concludes.
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, so Haniyyah and our shroom buddies will be here for a while, huh? That's great!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon was planning to ask you to stay here for a day more so that we could spend more quality time with the Fungi.
:'''Paimon:''' But it looks like we can hit two birds with one stone &mdash; testing Fungus Mechanicus and playing with our shroom buddies at the same time!
:{{Black Screen|You have a good, carefree time with Paimon, Bongo-Head, and Kindlejoy, and feed the Marvelous Jellies to them.<br>Paimon and your shroom buddies enjoy themselves very much.}}
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, that was great, like Paimon's worries have all flown away!
:'''Paimon:''' Well, Bongo-Head, Kindlejoy... See you tomorrow!
:'''Bongo-Head:''' ♪~
:'''Kindlejoy:''' ?

;(Talk to Bongo-Head or Kindlejoy again)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey there, Bongo-Head, Kindlejoy! We're here to play with you!
:'''Paimon:''' What shall we do together with our shroom buddies, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} Let's feed them, shall we?
::'''Paimon:''' Sure! We had so much fun last time that we didn't notice the many Marvelous Jelly flavors available. Let's pay a bit more attention to the ones the shrooms prefer, shall we?
::{{DIcon}} Use the Valberry-flavored jellies.
:::'''Bongo-Head:''' ♪~
:::'''Kindlejoy:''' ?
:::'''Paimon:''' Ooh, so Bongo-Head likes the Valberry-flavored ones, huh?
:::'''Paimon:''' Maybe we can squeeze lots of Valberry juice and let Bongo-Head soak in them next time...
:::'''Paimon:''' On the other hand, it seems like Kindlejoy isn't that keen... Maybe it doesn't like sweet stuff &mdash; that sure fits its personality!
::{{DIcon}} Use the Mint-flavored jellies.
:::'''Bongo-Head:''' ♪~
:::'''Kindlejoy:''' ?
:::'''Paimon:''' Hey, looks like Bongo-Head loves minty-fresh flavors!
:::'''Paimon:''' Do you think it'll have tons of fun in a Mint field?
:::'''Paimon:''' Hmm... But it looks like Kindlejoy's not loving the cool flavors much.
::{{DIcon}} Use the Crab Roe-flavored jellies.
:::'''Paimon:''' Um, is this flavor really a thing? Haniyyah sure gets some... interesting ideas...
:::'''Bongo-Head:''' ♪~
:::'''Kindlejoy:''' ♫~
:::'''Paimon:''' Huh, looks like Bongo-Head doesn't mind the flavor of Crab Roe at all!
:::'''Paimon:''' Kindlejoy seems pleased too. Looks like Crab Roe's the happy medium!
:::'''Paimon:''' It is kinda time-consuming to make Crab Roe, but it's a small sacrifice to make for our buddies, eh? Let's make some for them later!
:::'''Paimon:''' Once we know how to make Marvelous Jellies, we can whip up a great feast for them!
::'''Paimon:''' What shall we do together with our shroom buddies, {{Traveler}}?
:;(Return to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} Let's make some gestures at them, shall we?
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm? That's true, it seems some people can use simple hand gestures to make animals understand what they mean.
::'''Paimon:''' Let's give it a go &mdash; with our bond with our Fungi friends, we should have no problem!
::{{DIcon}} Give your Fungi friends a thumbs-up.
:::'''Paimon:''' Right, Paimon'll do it too. Thumbs up for good ol' Bongo-Head and the handsome Kindlejoy!
:::'''Bongo-Head:''' ♪~
:::'''Kindlejoy:''' ♫~
:::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, looks like they're both mighty pleased. Let's give them more encouragement in the future!
::{{DIcon}} Waggle your index finger around in a circle.
:::'''Paimon:''' Are you asking them to turn around? Isn't that a bit complicated?
:::'''Bongo-Head:''' ♪~
:::'''Kindlejoy:''' ♫~
:::'''Paimon:''' Hahaha, look at them go! They're so smart!
:::'''Paimon:''' It's almost like they're dancing. Maybe if Paimon danced too, Bongo-Head would be willing to be Paimon's dance partner!
::{{DIcon}} Point at Paimon with the right hand, left hand at your head.
:::'''Bongo-Head:''' ♪~
:::'''Paimon:''' Whoa, looks like Bongo-Head's coming over to let Paimon pat it!
:::'''Paimon:''' But, uh, Kindlejoy is...
:::'''Kindlejoy:''' ♫~
:::'''Paimon:''' Wait! Stop, stop! Kindlejoy looks like it's about to jump on Paimon's head!
::'''Paimon:''' What shall we do together with our shroom buddies, {{Traveler}}?
:;(Return to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} Let's use different sounds to call out to them, shall we?
::'''Paimon:''' Do you mean that we should try imitating other animals to see what sort of reaction we'll get from them?
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon wants to try that too!
::{{DIcon}} *roar*
:::'''Paimon:''' What kinda sound was that? Were you trying to imitate a Sumpter Beast? Paimon's never heard that one before, though...
:::'''Bongo-Head:''' ♪~
:::'''Kindlejoy:''' ♫~
:::'''Paimon:''' Huh, looks like they're coming over...
:::'''Paimon:''' Do Fungi also stick to Sumpter Beasts for warmth when they feel cold?
::{{DIcon}} Meow~
:::'''Paimon:''' Haha, so you're a cat, huh? Alright, Paimon's joining in!
:::'''Bongo-Head:''' ?
:::'''Kindlejoy:''' ?
:::'''Paimon:''' Huh, they seem kinda curious. Have they never seen a cat before?
:::'''Paimon:''' Well, guess that just means we should introduce them to some in the future and help them make some new friends!
:::'''Paimon:''' Speaking of which, would we call a cat that lives in the rainforest a Forest Cat?
:::'''Paimon:''' And if it makes friends with a Fungus, that makes it a Shroomcat!
::{{DIcon}} Ya!
:::'''Paimon:''' Hey, hey, that's not an animal you're imitating! You're gonna make our shroom buddies nervous!
:::'''Bongo-Head:''' !
:::'''Kindlejoy:''' !
:::'''Paimon:''' See? They've been alerted now!
:::'''Paimon:''' Don't worry, don't worry, there are no hilichurls around. {{Traveler}}'s just joking.
:::'''Paimon:''' Hmm, guess this means that the shrooms can help us keep watch while we're asleep. They're pretty reliable, huh?
::'''Paimon:''' What shall we do together with our shroom buddies, {{Traveler}}?
:;(Return to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} We'll come back later and play with them.
::'''Paimon:''' Huh, do we have something else to do? Well then, let's get to it quickly &mdash; then we can get back and continue playing with Bongo-Head and Kindlejoy!

;(Talk to Haniyyah)
:'''Haniyyah:''' Judging by your faces, it seems like you two still have some questions, yes?
:'''Haniyyah:''' Don't worry, you can be more casual with me. You've both helped me a great deal, so I'll tell you all I know.
:{{DIcon}} So, about keeping the Fungi...
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, that's what we wanted to ask about.
::'''Paimon:''' We didn't take Bongo-Head with us previously for fairness's sake, so it wouldn't look like we were making ourselves the exception to the final decision.
::'''Paimon:''' It's been some time since the tournament, though, so if we're able to communicate with our shroom buddies without having to rely on Wisdom Orbs...
::'''Paimon:''' We can keep Bongo-Head with us, can't we?
::'''Haniyyah:''' I have considered that as well, yes.
::'''Haniyyah:''' Supposing that you could find a place devoid of other residents or animals, this would be fine &mdash; in theory.
::'''Haniyyah:''' Although our Fungi friends are quite well-behaved, they might be angered if challenged by animals like Forest Boars.
::{{DIcon}} We have the Serenitea Pot.
::{{DIcon}} The Realm Within is quite spacious.
::'''Paimon:''' But we do have guests and animals in there at times, don't we?
::'''Paimon:''' Tubby would be really troubled if the Fungi were to get into fights with the other animals...
::'''Paimon:''' Perhaps we should ask Tubby first. Maybe she'd have some ideas!
::'''Haniyyah:''' I'm also looking for new security measures, such as road signs or fences that have special spores on them that will cause Fungi to automatically remain within a specific area.
::'''Haniyyah:''' Perhaps we might be able to separate the living areas of the Fungi from that of other animals, thus preventing conflict.
::'''Haniyyah:''' If something looks particularly promising, I'll inform you right away.
::{{DIcon}} Alright then, let's all do our best!
::'''Paimon:''' Thanks, Haniyyah!
:{{DIcon}} Tell me more about the Marvelous Jellies...
::'''Haniyyah:''' Not to worry, I commissioned Ms. Najah from the Amurta to make these, and they serve as rations for the Fungi.
::'''Haniyyah:''' The Jellies don't contain any medicinal components, only nutritional ones.
::'''Haniyyah:''' We can use these Jellies to avoid the Fungi absorbing too many nutrients from the soil, which will prevent them from spoiling rainforest ecosystems.
::'''Haniyyah:''' We can also add components to the Jellies according to the personalities of each Fungus to improve their mood.
::'''Paimon:''' Ooh, so you can do that too, huh? We can try to figure out Bongo-Head's favorite flavor, then?
::{{DIcon}} Do you want to give it a go, Paimon?
::{{DIcon}} I'd like to hear your review once you're done eating it...
::'''Paimon:''' Nah! Floral Jellies and Marvelous Jellies all look pretty delicious, but Paimon's not so hard up that she'd need to eat food meant for Fungi!
::'''Paimon:''' Well, let's feed Bongo-Head and Kindlejoy some Marvelous Jellies later, shall we?
:{{DIcon}} So, about your funding...
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon's got the same concerns, Haniyyah. Have you encountered any lack of Mora while taking care of the Fungi all this time?
::'''Haniyyah:''' Please do not worry.
::'''Haniyyah:''' I can secure food via fishing and hunting in the rainforest, and our shroom buddies can get the nutrients they need from the soil.
::'''Haniyyah:''' Other than clothes, daily necessities, and the funds required to make Marvelous Jellies, I don't really have many expenses to worry about.
::'''Haniyyah:''' I still have quite a large amount of savings left over from my work training Sumpter Beasts for merchant caravans. I've got enough for decades, even.
::'''Paimon:''' W&mdash;Wow... So that's what it's like to be a professional beast tamer!
::{{DIcon}} If you need anything, just let us know.
::{{DIcon}} We'll do our best to support you.
::'''Haniyyah:''' I appreciate the sentiment. I promised to take good care of our shroom friends. As long as nothing goes awry, I won't add to your burdens.
::'''Paimon:''' Huh, y'know what? That's kinda reassuring. When the opportunity comes around, let's treat Haniyyah to a nice meal plus some improved rations for our Fungi friends!
:{{DIcon}} We'll see you later.
::'''Haniyyah:''' No problem. I'll be here, and you're free to drop by any time.

;(Talk to Balfour)
:'''Balfour:''' O great heroes, please, feel free to play Fungus Mechanicus to your heart's content!
:'''Balfour:''' Is there anything else I can do for you, by the way? Name it, and I shall do my best to answer the call!
:{{DIcon|Fungus Mechanicus}} Play Fungus Mechanicus
:{{DIcon}} About the next tournament...
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, speaking of that, we've been waiting for news about the Wisdom Orbs all this time, but we haven't really thought the arrangements of the next tournament through.
::'''Paimon:''' Well, Paimon's sure {{Traveler}}'ll come up with a whole bunch of ideas when the time comes, so there's probably nothing to worry about.
::'''Balfour:''' Indeed. And in any case, I have prepared a great many contingencies, which I hope will meet your expectations.
::'''Balfour:''' When the time comes, just use your judgment, and should you encounter any troublesome trivialities, leave them to me!
::{{DIcon}} I'll do some research myself should I get the chance.
::{{DIcon}} Paimon and I will be the best organizers, just you wait.
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, in that case, Paimon's gonna think about how to make the matches more exciting for the shrooms!
:{{DIcon}} Tell me more about the promotion of Fungus Mechanicus...
::'''Balfour:''' Oh, you can rest assured about that!
::'''Balfour:''' Though the game is in its early test stages, it is open to all, and anyone who wants to can try it and make suggestions.
::'''Balfour:''' I even extended invitations to some chess enthusiasts, Akademiya students, and Eremite mercenaries to test the game &mdash; we're going for the widest possible clientele coverage.
::'''Balfour:''' Of course, your feedback shall be foremost amongst them, and we will put priority on making changes according to any suggestions you may make.
::'''Balfour:''' The relevant people have been informed, so when the time comes, I will put the word out and increase the intensity of our advertising.
::'''Paimon:''' Wow, this is so professional, Paimon's starting to get confused...
::'''Paimon:''' Well, we'll just keep playing the game and give you our feedback so it can be the best it can be!
::'''Paimon:''' And then with this game, we'll get everyone hyped up for the next Beast Tamers Tournament...
::'''Paimon:''' Looks like we've got lots of work to do, {{Traveler}}!
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for your hard work. Bye for now.
::'''Balfour:''' Don't mention it. See you later, then!

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Souka, optional)
:'''Souka:''' (Yes... adding half a chapter filled with mundane content before the second key interval. Then we introduce the suspense for the next chapter. Yes, this might just be an effective method to break apart the chapters...)

;(Talk to Souka at a campsite north of Port Ormos, optional)
:'''Souka:''' Hmm? Fancy meeting you here, "Twin Stars of Brilliant Valor"!
::{{DIcon}} That's a pretty nice nickname!
:::'''Paimon:''' It's been a while, Souka!
:::'''Paimon:''' And there you go with the nicknames again... But Paimon likes this one &mdash; it's cool, and it also emphasizes our super-awesome partnership!
:::'''Souka:''' Ah, it's good that you like it.
::{{DIcon}} Sorry, uh, who are you again...
:::'''Paimon:''' Have you not been resting well these last few days, {{Traveler}}? Do you need a refresher or something?
:::'''Paimon:''' Souka's one of Yae Publishing House's new writers. She came with Miko to take part in the tournament previously!
:::'''Paimon:''' We did beat her in the second round, but uh... Ahem, Let's {{sic}} not dwell on that too much...
:::'''Paimon:''' After that, Souka wrote us into her light novel. We're pretty important characters, so Paimon's really looking forward to reading it!
:::{{DIcon}} Aha, yes, now I remember!
:::{{DIcon}} Yes, yes, that did happen...
:::'''Paimon:''' Right? You're not that forgetful!
::'''Paimon:''' So the contestant Haniyyah mentioned was you, huh? Why're you here in Sumeru by yourself?
::'''Souka:''' Well, I was looking to regain the mindset I previously had during the tournament...
::'''Souka:''' I'm about one-third of the way through writing my new book, but I feel like some of the parts I've written after that aren't quite right...
::'''Souka:''' As time passed I found that the inspiration that I got and the feelings that I held toward our Fungi partners began to fade and cool.
::'''Paimon:''' Well, no matter how good your memory is, you won't quite be able to capture the joy of traveling together if you're apart from your companions for too long.
::'''Souka:''' Exactly! So I asked Lady Yae to allow me to come to Sumeru for a long-term attachment, and she gladly agreed &mdash; she event sent me here with a letter of recommendation!
::'''Souka:''' I searched in the rainforest for some time before finally finding Haniyyah's campsite. It was really well hidden, and didn't startle any of the surrounding animals at all!
::'''Souka:''' She is very capable, and she takes great care of the Fungi, but I can at least help her share her burden.
::'''Souka:''' When she hear why I'd come, she agreed to my request. She then taught me quite a few survival lesson, and tutored me on how to take care of Fungi.
::'''Souka:''' I mean, I already enjoyed living together with them, so every day has been quite fulfilling.
::'''Souka:''' Inspiration's also close at hand, so I believe that the rest of this book will be a cinch!
::{{DIcon}} A perfect decision!
::{{DIcon}} Good for you!
::'''Paimon:''' That's great! You get endless inspiration for your new book, and Haniyyah gets to take some of the load off her back!
::'''Paimon:''' Still, we haven't seen your partner anywhere.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks it was... Stormstress?
::'''Souka:''' Stormstress has been helping us set up a new hut, so it's resting at our campsite right now. That's why it didn't come along to Port Ormos.
::'''Souka:''' The other contestants' Fungi partners are accompanying Stormstress. If the opportunity comes along, I can take you to our campsite to meet them all!
::'''Souka:''' Look, Lady Yae's Blitzara and Layla's Twirly-Whirly are just over there. They'd love to play with you.
::'''Paimon:''' Nice! Let's go meet up with our shroom friend later, then!
:{{DIcon}} We'll talk again later!
::'''Souka:''' Indeed, it seem you bear the expectations of many, and are most busy indeed...
::'''Souka:''' I hope to see you both again soon!

;(Talk to Twirly-Whirly or Blitzara)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey there, Twirly-Whirly! Hey there, Blitzara! Still remember us?
:'''Paimon:''' Hahaha, no hesitation at all! They look so happy!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, what should we do will we're hanging out?
:;(After obtaining Haniyyah's Gift of Marvelous Jellies)
:{{DIcon}} Let's feed them, shall we?
::'''Paimon:''' Alright, let's see what flavors they like!
::{{DIcon}} Use the Berry-flavored jellies.
:::'''Twirly-Whirly:''' ♩~
:::'''Blitzara:''' ♬~
:::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, looks like they both love the flavor of Berries!
:::'''Paimon:''' Berries are pretty easy to find &mdash; we snag loads just by walking around. Guess we can leave some for our shroom friends, eh?
::{{DIcon}} Use the Lavender Melon-flavored jellies.
:::'''Paimon:''' Wow this flavor's really unexpected! Haniyyah's really good at this &mdash; Paimon didn't think she'd use ingredients from other nations in her Marvelous Jellies.
:::'''Twirly-Whirly:''' ...
:::'''Blitzara:''' ♬~
:::'''Paimon:''' Twirly-Whirly doesn't seem to understand the flavor of Lavender Melon. Maybe it's wondering whether they're fruits or vegetables.
:::'''Paimon:''' Well, Bitzara's having no problems, though. Maybe it's thinking about something happy.
::{{DIcon}} Use the Onion-flavored jellies.
:::'''Paimon:''' ?
:::'''Twirly-Whirly:''' ?
:::'''Blitzara:''' ?
:::'''Paimon:''' Is this flavor really a thing? Haniyyah's thought processes sure are interesting...
:::'''Twirly-Whirly:''' ...♩~
:::'''Paimon:''' Eh? Looks like Twirly-Whirly's come around... and it seems to like that!
:::'''Paimon:''' Is there anything special about onions? Let Paimon think...
:::'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Does it have invigorating effects?
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm, what should we do while we're hanging out?
:;(Return to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} Let's use different sounds to communicate with them, shall we?
::'''Paimon:''' Ooh, so you're going to imitate animals? Sure Paimon would like to know how Twirly-Whirly and Bitzara relate to other animals too!
::'''Paimon:''' C'mon, let's give it a try!
::{{DIcon}} Cuckoo!
:::'''Twirly-Whirly:''' ?
:::'''Blitzara:''' ?
:::'''Paimon:''' Hmm, Sumeru doesn't really have pigeons, so our Fungi friends didn't really understand you at all.
:::'''Paimon:''' Maybe you can try imitating Dusk Birds instead?
:::'''Paimon:''' Chachacha, cha~chacha, chacha~ cha!
:::'''Paimon:''' Um... Hmm, this is kinda difficult. Paimon can't match their rhythm at all. That might've just confused our shroom buddies more...
::{{DIcon}} Rawr!
:::'''Paimon:''' What? What were you trying to imitate? Wait. Was that you trying to sound like a Rishboland Tiger?
:::'''Paimon:''' You'll scare them!
:::'''Twirly-Whirly:''' ♪~
:::'''Blitzara:''' ♫~
:::'''Paimon:''' Wait, what? They seem pretty excited...
:::'''Paimon:''' Have they made friends with Rishboland Tigers and fought alongside them before?
:::'''Paimon:''' That's a bit difficult to imagine... Maybe we should observe Fungi out in the wild more carefully next time.
::{{DIcon}} Gang~ gang~ woo!
:::'''Paimon:''' Wait, why are you copying the Abyss Mages now? Well, you're not very convincing, sure, but you might still frighten them!
:::'''Twirly-Whirly:''' !
:::'''Blitzara:''' !
:::'''Paimon:''' Um, Twirly-Whirly and Bitzara both look kinda scared!
:::'''Paimon:''' It's okay, {{Traveler}}'s just playing a prank on you two. There's no Abyss Mage nearby.
:::'''Paimon:''' Still, do Abyss Mages go around bullying Fungi, with hilichurls in town and all?
:::'''Paimon:''' Grr, that makes Paimon kinda mad. If we encounter Fungi getting bullied out in the wild next time, there's no way we'd just stand by and let it happen!
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm, what should we do while we're hanging out?
:;(Return to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} We'll come back later and play with them then.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, there's still some stuff we need to do. Well, let's get it done quick, then come back and hang out with Twirly-Whirly and Bitzara, shall we?

;(Read Inazuman Mail From Afar beside Souka)
::To "Souka, the Resolute Hero, Whose Pen is Her Sword,"
::Like your new title, Souka? It was coined by the new hires [[Aratani]] brought in.
::They've heard all about it, you know &mdash; how a senior writer crossed the treacherous waves and ventured deep into the rainforests of a foreign land to live with monster friends she met prior.
::Some even think that you must be a writer of the oldest school, so fastidious in your standards for material inspiration that you're willing to brave great dangers just to produce the greatest possible work.
::Some think that you might be the sort to make such declarations as:
::"The pen alone will not write a story worth acclaim." They think that thus did you raise your sword against monsters and prove victorious, only to find a few sweet-tempered ones with whom you could strike up friendships, a process that ultimately birthed your manuscripts.
::Of course, the title of "hero" is one celebrated by all &mdash; after all, some of our half-a-month-at-a-time shut-in authors find your trip abroad to seek writing material quite the grand accomplishment. One worthy of praise, certainly.
::Although these things do not really have much to do with the theme of beast-taming, they can still be &mdash; with some adjustments &mdash; tucked away as material to be used at a later date.
::Now then, to the main matter at hand. The manuscript you sent previously was quite good indeed. The details were well executed, as were the emotional motivations. I'd say that you've made a lot of improvements.
::Perhaps you might want to ride that momentum and change thirty percent of your previous scripts to match your current style?
::You did say before that the previous companion character wasn't all that special and wanted to change the base design of that companion to that of Blitzara &mdash; I think that's a workable idea.
::Electro characters are not very common to start with. Few light novels use such settings &mdash; with the exception being that particular chestnut about "reincarnation," I suppose.
::Taking visual effects into consideration, light novels tend to often use gold, white, or red, while characters in purple are relatively rare, so one such character should stand out. It'll make for striking new illustrations, for sure.
::Of course, I believe I need not say that purple has a... special familiarity to Inazuman readers. I believe you need only exercise your memory a little to know what I speak of.
::So, I'd like you to take care of Blitzara a little more during this time and observe its habits.
::You mentioned before that you were looking for some flavorings with which to further tune and refine the Marvelous Jellies. I have enclosed with this letter some regional specialties from Inazuma based on my own understanding of Blitzara. I believe it'll quite enjoy what you get when you combine the Jellies with them.
::Oh, and do try to avoid eating them first, will you?
::I look forward to your next manuscript submission~

;(Read Missive From Sumeru beside Souka)
::Dear Haniyyah,
::Thank you for your and Souka's help during this time!
::The last time Souka took me to see my Fungi friend, I noticed that though Twirly-Whirly's appearance hadn't changed much at first glance, I could feel that its skin was much more smooth and elastic, and its strength undoubtedly greater. Perhaps after a short while more, it will even be able to float with me atop it. I'm rather looking forward to it, I must say!
::The Marvelous Jellies' effects really are amazing. They can allow our shroom friends to grow more healthily, they save time and effort, and they even keep the Fungi from leaching the fertility of the rainforest soil.
::Perhaps, if I were to explain the effects of the Jellies to the Mahamata, they would no longer have to worry about our Fungi friends fighting for nutrients with the plants within the city, and any further residence applications on their behalf should go more smoothly.
::Najah is busy with some of the business that comes with becoming a researcher, and things have been a bit tight with my thesis &mdash; meaning that we're both a little pressed for time at the moment &mdash; but don't worry, I'll find a suitable opportunity to speak to the Mahamata about this.
::Najah has been very earnest in repeatedly emphasizing that she "will most certainly cleanse the stain that Kautilya has left on the field of Fungus Studies." I'm confident that she'll be able to convince all the administrators. Once she finishes the improvements to the Wisdom Orbs, I believe that our fungal friends will definitely be able to claim a place in our lives alongside cats, dogs, and Sumpter Beasts alike.
::There are still a few other interesting things I want to tell you, but I'll leave them for the next time we meet.
::Once you finalize plans for the next tournament, do tell me &mdash; I'll do my best to help you out!
