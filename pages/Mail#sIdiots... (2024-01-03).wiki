|text      = Lately, there's always been a gaggle of students sneaking around and gossiping behind my back. One glare, and they'd scatter and hide.

And would you believe it? Just when I was hiding out in the wild, seeking some peace and quiet, they jumped out of some bushes holding a cake that anyone could see was sickeningly sweet. It's so incredibly ridiculous that I had to laugh. Just how many people on this planet would be happy about my "birth"?

But their little joke did remind me that on this day, there is someone I need to give a gift to.

Since I'm the one picking the gift, I'll choose it based on my own preferences. If you've got any opinions, you'd best tell me in person.

Hmm... Though just how did they find me? Next time I'll need to find a more secluded spot.
