{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Arlecchino and Tartaglia)
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's The Knave! And... Childe!?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, aren't you supposed to be in Snezhnaya recuperating? What are you still doing in Fontaine?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 01.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Oh, it's you two. I didn't expect to run into you here... *coughing*
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 02.ogg}} '''Childe:''' I was unconscious for quite a while after the fight in the Primordial Sea. After I woke up, I realized I was being taken back to Snezhnaya, and well...
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 03.ogg}} '''Childe:''' I couldn't have that, now could I? Not when I've still got unfinished business here in Fontaine. So, I mustered up all my strength and made the journey back on my own.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What sort of unfinished business are we talking here?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 04.ogg}} '''Childe:''' It has to do with Skirk... My master. I really wanted to meet up with her... But, by the time I got back, she had already left.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 05.ogg}} '''Childe:''' I still have so many questions for her. Without any other leads... all I could do was ask The Knave to help me track her down. She must have left behind some traces from her time in Fontaine.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, okay... So, have you found any clues?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 01.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Unfortunately, no. While the House of the Hearth is adept at collecting all manner of intelligence, certain existences... can still manage to escape our purview.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 06.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Basically, unless Master feels there's a need to meet with me, she's not going to be found.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 07.ogg}} '''Childe:''' But, that problem has an easy fix. I just need to become stronger, and then... *coughing*
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Paimon thinks you should focus on getting better first.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 08.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Haha, the worst of it is over.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 09.ogg}} '''Childe:''' It's all thanks to that one kid from the House of the Hearth... [[Heloir]] I think her name was. She gave me a bunch of random potions to drink. They didn't go down easy, let me tell you &mdash; pain and chills all over. But, they really did help speed up my recovery.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 10.ogg}} '''Childe:''' And that's good, because it looks like I really do have to head back this time. The [[Pulcinella|old man]]'s been putting the pressure on me. He sent someone to tell me I'm needed for some sort of project...
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 02.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' "Project Stuzha"?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 11.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Yeah, that's the one. *sigh* I heard [[Regrator]]'s involved too. I'm not looking forward to having to listen to all his monologuing, that's for sure. Hey, maybe you could think of a way for me to stay in Fontaine for a little longer?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 12.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Helping Lyney and the others brush up on their fighting skills would be far more interesting. If you and I could spar &mdash; that would be even better. I've been waiting for the chance to see you go all out.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 03.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' And what a sweet, little daydream that is. But, I also have a role to play in all this. I'll be leaving Fontaine shortly as well.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 04.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Besides, considering how little they see fit to step outside the homeland, being called on to return to Snezhnaya by such illustrious dignitaries... What a great "honor," wouldn't you agree?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 13.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Haha... One I could do without, I'd say.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is it just Paimon? Or, does it kinda seem like they're...
:{{DIcon}} Just casually trash-talking their colleagues behind their backs...?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 05.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' So, dear guests of the House of the Hearth, to what do I owe the visit?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... Well, we just, uh...
:{{DIcon}} Wanted to learn more about you.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right! We're super close to Lyney and the others, but we still don't know much about you!
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 06.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Is that so? Introductions have already been made, have they not?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, well, you see... There's only so much you can learn about someone from a short introduction! At least tell us something a little extra, like... Why do you call yourself "Father"?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 14.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Ooh, good question! I'd also like to know.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 07.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' The fact that you have to ask tells me our intelligence work has been quite successful. Telling you the answer to that question would only serve to undermine that success, and we can't have that, now can we?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 15.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Spoken like a true diplomat. That was some expert sidestepping right there.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 08.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Well, if there's nothing else, I think I'll take my leave. I still have a small matter to resolve at home.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Wait! Don't go!
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (If The Knave leaves right now, she's sure to run into Lyney and Clervie...!)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Should I release the bird Lyney gave us? No, we should try to get her talking about something else first.)
:{{DIcon}} About the House of the Hearth...
:{{DIcon}} What does the organization mean to you?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 16.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Oho, I'd also like to hear the answer to this.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 17.ogg}} '''Childe:''' I've met some of the members of your organization, and they all seemed like really good kids. They actually reminded me of [[Tonia]] and [[Teucer]].
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 18.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Which, by the way, if you ever betray them, I'm just letting you know &mdash; I won't let you off easy.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 09.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' And why would I betray them?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 19.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Well, you've already betrayed the House of the Hearth once, haven't you? At least... that's what I heard.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 10.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' ...
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 20.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Okay, okay. I admit, that's just what the old man told me... [[Pulcinella|The Rooster]], I mean.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (The Knave betrayed the House of the Hearth... So, does that mean what Clervie said was true? Does The Knave really treat her children like test subjects?)
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' W&mdash;Wait... did you really do something bad to those kids?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 11.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Never mind what I've done, I'm more curious as to what the mighty Rooster had to say. Care to enlighten me?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 21.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Ah, well, nothing much... Just some stuff about you taking out many other members of the House of the Hearth, and even going so far to attack your own "family."
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 12.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Hmm... I see.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 22.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Based on your reaction, I'm guessing it's all a bunch of lies?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 13.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Hardly. I don't appreciate his particular turns of phrase, but I suppose he didn't say anything untrue.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 14.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Although, it would be more accurate to say that there is a certain level of prejudice involved... But, I don't intend to clear that up just yet. Prejudice has a funny way of concealing the real truth behind certain things &mdash; an attribute that I find to be quite advantageous.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 15.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Call yourself a Fontainian, for example, and people will assume all sorts of things, when the real truth... is that this is simply the land where I was raised.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? You're not actually from Fontaine!? But then, why did you try to help out with the prophecy and everything?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 16.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' I was trying to protect the children born in Fontaine. Claiming that I, myself, was a Fontainian simply made it easier to operate. People would hardly suspect a fellow Fontainian of having any ulterior motives. Who wouldn't want to save their homeland, after all?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 17.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' The Primordial Sea wouldn't have any effect on me, but it would have caused great harm to the House of the Hearth... Well, you wanted "extra information," didn't you? There you go. I hope that satisfied your curiosity.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (So much for learning anything else about her "betrayal." She probably only revealed that other secret in order to change the subject. It seems like she's trying to avoid talking about her past...)
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 23.ogg}} '''Childe:''' So, you stayed in Fontaine for the kids... I guess I was wrong to believe you'd betray them. Apologies. Looks like I was holding on to some prejudices myself.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 18.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Good. Like I said &mdash; I like it when others have misconceptions of me.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 24.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Actually, while I was recuperating at the House of the Hearth, there was something else that really caught my attention.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 25.ogg}} '''Childe:''' I heard that members always resolve disputes and arguments with a friendly spar, and the loser has to back down. Seems pretty cool, if you ask me. Would also give them plenty of opportunities to hone their skills.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 19.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Well, that's only a recent development. In the past, such spars weren't nearly so... friendly. The losing party would lose everything, including their life.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' They were that high stakes!? Phew, at least that's not a thing anymore!
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 26.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Well, the current atmosphere's not half bad. I'm a bit jealous, actually. You've got so many family members around you, and you even get to live with them.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 20.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Having a lot of family around means dealing with a considerable amount of bickering and scheming. Once Tonia and Teucer enter their rebellious phase, I'm sure you'll understand.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 21.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Just imagine... Teucer becomes obsessed with plucking out strands from the Rooster's mustache, or Tonia decides to dye her hair 42 different colors...
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 27.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Okay, okay! I get the picture.
:{{Black Screen|As the conversation shifts to the topic of Tonia and Teucer, Childe begins to share story after story about his siblings.}}
:{{Black Screen|It's the type of conversation that would usually leave you falling asleep, but you find yourself grateful to Childe for buying you more time.}}
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 28.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Ah, well, would you look at the time. I should probably get going.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 29.ogg}} '''Childe:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, I'm not sure where our paths will cross next, but the next time we run into each other, we should definitely try and find some time to spar... *coughing*
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Again, maybe this is a conversation we can have when you look less like you're gonna keel over...
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 30.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Alright, alright... Well, thanks for everything, Arlecchino.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 22.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' No thanks necessary. You also played a part in obtaining the Gnosis. I would say we can call ourselves even.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 tartaglia 31.ogg}} '''Childe:''' Hah, I like the sound of that... Well, I'm off. See you all some other time.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We should probably get going too... Do you wanna head back with us?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 23.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Oh? You want me to leave so soon?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, uh... Well, you see, um...
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 24.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' I'm rather enjoying the evening breeze. If you don't mind, I think I'll stick around for a bit. I have some things to think about.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 arlecchino 25.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Apologies for not attending to you like a proper host. Please, forgive the slight. I do hope you'll have a pleasant stay.
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew... We managed to keep her distracted until nightfall. Good thing Childe was there to keep the conversation going. You don't think she suspected anything, do you?
:{{A|vo arlq002 1 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wonder if Lyney ran into any issues... Let's hurry back and see how everything went.

;(Talk to Arlecchino, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog arlq002 arlecchino 01.ogg}} '''The Knave:''' Oh? You decided to stay a little longer? Let's take in the ocean view together then.
----
{{Quest Description|update|You manage to stall until night time with some help from Childe. You wonder how things are going over on Lyney's end...}}
;(Approach Freminet, Lynette, and Lyney)
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lyney! How'd everything go?
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well, long story short, we ran into a small issue &mdash; Clervie can't go into the sunlight.
:{{DIcon}} What do you mean?
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Everything was fine at first. She followed me up to the surface, just like I told her.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But as I led her out of the shadows and into the sunlight, she vanished.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I turned around, and there she was &mdash; standing at the edge of the shadows, silently watching me.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Maybe she's afraid of sunlight, or... No, it wouldn't be her wish if that were the case.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, we could always try... pushing her into it?
:{{DIcon}} Not sure "pushing" works on a non-corporeal being...
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, true...
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I've pretty much tried it all already. Nothing worked. Eventually, the sun went down, so all I could do was bring her back here.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' How did it go with you, Lynette?
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Good. I've got the list. It's right here.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Well, what are we waiting for? Let's take a look!
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Woah, that's a lot of pages! It's gonna take forever to get through it all!
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' We can each take a section. Here.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[Lapouyade]]... [[Landois]]... [[Jeambel]]... [[Horrer]]...
;(Open Execution List)
::'''Execution List'''
::'''Page 1/4'''
::[[File:Execution List Photo 1.png|200px|link=]]

:{{A|vo arlq002 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yikes, that Horrer guy has a huge scar on his face. He's kinda giving Paimon the creeps.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Ah, I've met him before. The scar is from an injury he received during a mission. I still remember him joking with me about it. He said any future lover would take one look at him and then lose all interest.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did he say anything else?
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well, I asked if there was someone he was interested in. He said no, and that's where our conversation ended.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' It was only later that I learned he really did have someone he liked. He risked everything to escape so he could be with her, but it didn't work. One day, "Father" asked to see him, and well... I never saw him again after that.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, so that means, The Knave, she...
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' It may seem cruel, but it's just one of the rules of the House.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 12.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Betrayal is not to be taken lightly. We know too many secrets to come and go as we please. So, if you do try to leave, you pay with your life.
:{{Black Screen|A solemn atmosphere descends over the group as you look through the list of names. However, Clervie's name does not seem to be among them.}}
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 13.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Her name's not here, huh... Well, that's not too surprising. It doesn't seem like this list is complete. It only contains records dating back around five years.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 14.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Let's shift our attention, then. Freminet, were you able to find anything out?
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 freminet 01.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' ...
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 15.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Freminet?
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 freminet 02.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Ah sorry, I was thinking about something.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 freminet 03.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I managed to talk to quite a few people, but I couldn't help but notice that the atmosphere in the House was a little... strange.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Strange?
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 freminet 04.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Yeah. I mean, I know there have been arguments in the past, times when people haven't gotten along. [[Chapleau]] and [[Filliol]] are a good example of that...
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, those are two of the people we met while delivering supplies! Paimon can see how they might not get along. They had very different vibes, and their, um... "interests" seemed to be pretty different as well...
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 16.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That's to be expected, actually. "Father" brought us all here, shared her knowledge with us, taught us how to fight &mdash; that's one thing we all share. But, that's also where the similarities end. Not all of us feel the same desire to stay here.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 17.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' As members of the House of the Hearth, we're also considered part of the Fatui. And to a lot of people, that's an identity they never asked for.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 18.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Certain members get older and realize they want something else for themselves. But, considering the rules of the House... most people would never say that out loud.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 19.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' People like Chapleau and [[Foltz]] are loyal to "Father" and her vision. They're proud to be part of the Fatui. Filliol and [[Nanteuil]] on the other hand... Well, they aren't quite as enthusiastic.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' These kinds of conflicts have always been there. It's not like "Father" is in the dark about any of this.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 freminet 05.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' Well, that's true, but it just feels like things have gotten worse lately. Filliol and the others... It seemed like they were meeting in secret to talk about something.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 freminet 06.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' I can't say for sure, but I think they've met Clervie.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 20.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You think she's been inciting them to act out?
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 freminet 07.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' No, not exactly... But, I wouldn't be surprised if she said something to them about "the darkness in the House" and how deep it runs.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 freminet 08.ogg}} '''Freminet:''' She's told me about it before... experiments being run on children, people being used as pawns on the battlefield without so much as the strength to survive...
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 21.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' And they just believed all that? Without any evidence?
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Clervie's words probably gave them the excuse they were looking for. Whether they actually believe them to be true is secondary.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 22.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' *sigh*... This is all because of "Project Stuzha," isn't it?
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Woah, woah, woah. Hold on a second!
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's this "Project Stuzha" all about, huh? This is the second time it's come up now!
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 23.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Sorry, but I'm not sure of the details either.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 24.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I only know what "Father" has told us, which is that it's something The Rooster and Regrator have been working on together. Apparently, it has to do with the Fatui's strategic plan for the future.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 25.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Because the House of the Hearth was so successful in obtaining the Gnosis, we now have the honor of playing a key role in Project Stuzha.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait... but isn't that a good thing?
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 26.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' "Key" role is just another way of saying "dangerous" role. To us, the whole thing is an inconvenience.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 27.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' "Father" thinks so too, but she's in no position to refuse. Their plan isn't exactly unreasonable, and they've been funneling the House a lot of funding.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 28.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' It's just that... We'll lose a lot of members in the process. Participating in the plan... It's an honor in name only. What they're really trying to do is subdue us. The existence of an intelligence organization outside their control makes them feel uneasy.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Looks like the Fatui are plotting something big, but given how little Lyney and the others seem to know about it, I probably won't be able to learn much.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (I should keep a sharp eye out during any future dealings with the Fatui to see what I can learn.)
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, super complicated, top-secret Fatui business aside... What does all this have to do with the conflicts you were talking about earlier? Paimon doesn't get the connection...
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 29.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' External pressure has a way of exacerbating internal strife. You can't overlook the power of fear, either. People are afraid of dying, and that fear is often the impetus for a lot of stupid decisions.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 30.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I thought resolving the Clervie situation would make everything go back to normal.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 31.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But it looks like things are more complicated than I thought. If we leave Filliol and the others to their own devices, sooner or later, "Father" will be forced to take action.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lynette 05.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' We can only focus on one situation at a time, Brother.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 32.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You're right. Even if we confront Filliol and the others, it won't do any good. It might even make matters worse. We should focus on Clervie for now.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 33.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well, it's getting late. We should head back and get some rest. We'll try again first thing tomorrow.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 34.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Lynette, you stick with me this time. Freminet, keep a close eye on Filliol and the others. Make sure they don't do anything they'll regret.
:{{A|vo arlq002 2 lyney 35.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Good work today, everyone. Have a good night, and I'll see you tomorrow.

;(Enter the house)
:{{Black Screen|Your mind races with all sorts of thoughts. You try to rest, but you just can't seem to fall asleep.}}
:{{A|vo arlq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *yawn*... Paimon was looking forward to an early night, but she can't sleep at all...
:{{A|vo arlq002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, you don't think The Knave will be too angry with Lyney and everyone if she finds out about all this, do you?
:{{A|vo arlq002 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She's even scary when she smiles. If she were to actually get angry... *shudder* You have to protect Paimon if that happens, okay {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} I'm also afraid of her...
::{{A|vo arlq002 3 paimon 04a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, in that case, we should just plan on... running away! We'll grab Lyney and the others and, we can make a break for it as fast as we can!
:{{DIcon}} You can just hide behind me.
::{{A|vo arlq002 3 paimon 04b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Trusty as ever, {{Traveler}}!
:{{A|vo arlq002 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{A|vo arlq002 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look! Look, over there!
:{{DIcon}} Clervie?
:{{DIcon}} What's she doing over there!?
:{{A|vo arlq002 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Quick, let's catch up with her before anyone sees!
{{Quest Description|update|Leaving the temporary accomodations at night, you unexpectedly bump into Clervie. Follow her and see what happens.}}
;(While following Clervie)
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Over there!
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Where's she going? *sigh* If someone sees her, we're toast...
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, look! She stopped!

;(Talk to Clervie)
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Clervie!
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 creirve 01.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Shh!
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 creirve 02.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' I opened the window while no one was looking.
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 creirve 03.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Look how pretty the outside is...
:{{DIcon}} Window?
:{{DIcon}} There's nothing here...
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 creirve 04.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' If only I could have more than this.
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 creirve 05.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' You probably think I'm being silly, huh? All this hopeless resisting... It's better to dream of what I could have than try to make it a reality, right?
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Please help us get on the same page here, Clervie. We need you to tell us what you know. Can you do that?
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 creirve 06.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Sure! Although... after you hear all this, I think you might regret that decision.
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 creirve 07.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Everyone in this family is nothing more than a tool, something to be used and exploited. We're all expendable... including me.
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 creirve 08.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' As long as you're useful, you get to stick around. Lose your value... and you're handed over to [[The Doctor]], experimented on, and given a fate worse than death. I've seen it happen again and again, and I've had enough.
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're saying The Knave did all that?
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's just... That doesn't seem like something she would do. She's scary and all, but it seems like even she has lines she wouldn't cross.
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 creirve 09.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Heh, I knew you wouldn't believe me.
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 creirve 10.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Everyone thinks she's a good person. They all think of her like a real "Mother"...
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Mother"?
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 creirve 11.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' But she doesn't deserve that title. She's disgraced it and tarnished it... and if I had things my way, I'd never see her again.
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 creirve 12.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' If only [[Perrie]] were here. She'd understand...
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Perrie... There's that name again.
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Also, Paimon's getting a strange feeling...
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It almost feels like she's not really "here" with us. Paimon can't tell if she's actually talking to us, or if she's mistaken us for someone else...
:{{DIcon}} I'm not sure either.
:{{DIcon}} She's a spirit. It could be anything.
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... Well, in any case, it seems like she really needs someone to talk to. We should keep her company for a little longer.
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She looks so young, but it seems like she's been through a lot.
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 creirve 13.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' It's getting windy. I should close the window...
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 creirve 14.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Ooh, look at the moon! Isn't it pretty? ...Hey, wanna hear a secret? I heard that if you look up at the night sky in Snezhnaya, you can see the aurora. It's supposed to be super pretty... even prettier than the moon tonight.
:{{DIcon}} I'd love to see it.
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 creirve 15.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' Perrie and I promised each other, that once we're older, we're gonna go see it together.
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 creirve 16.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' But I can't find her. I'm worried she's also been... No, that wouldn't happen to her. She's special. Mother likes her a lot.
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 creirve 17.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' I should really go talk to Mother, but we just fought. She doesn't want to see me, and I'm too scared to face her.
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 creirve 18.ogg}} '''Clervie:''' What should I do...
:{{Color|menu|Clervie appears lost in thought. She stands there silently and doesn't say another word.}}
:{{Black Screen|After some time, Clervie seems to come back to herself. She gives a weak smile and leaves on her own.}}
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh*... Paimon really doesn't understand what's going on with her.
:{{A|vo arlq002 4 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, let's head back. We've got an early morning tomorrow!
