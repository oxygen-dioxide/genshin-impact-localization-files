==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Pops Zhou:''' Welcome! Please take a seat!
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'd like to have some tea, please.
::'''Pops Zhou:''' I don't carry any famous teas, but the flavor of what I do have is quite good if I must say so myself. Go ahead, have a sip!
:;(Opens Pop's Teas menu)
:{{DIcon}} Where's this?
::'''Pops Zhou:''' This is Stone Gate. Keep heading south from here and you'll reach Liyue.
::'''Pops Zhou:''' Can I get you a cup of tea?
:{{DIcon}} You are...?
::'''Pops Zhou:''' I am the owner of this tea booth. It's not a lucrative business, but you do get to hear a lot of stories.
::'''Pops Zhou:''' Hehehe... Honestly, the thing I love most about running this booth is watching all the travelers come and go, and listening to all the stories they have to tell.
::{{DIcon}} Stories?
::'''Pops Zhou:''' Look at me, traveler, I'm just an old bag of bones.
::'''Pops Zhou:''' I've never had to weather any great storms in my life, it's been smooth sailing all the way through.
::'''Pops Zhou:''' But when I got old, I started feeling as if I was missing out.
::'''Pops Zhou:''' So I packed a few things and left Mt. Qingce behind...
::'''Pops Zhou:''' Once I left [[Qingce Village]], I decided that this was where I was going to set up a booth. I don't do anything here except chat to people; listen to their stories, tell them mine... And I'm thoroughly enjoying it!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Pops Zhou:''' Bye then, take it easy!
::'''Pops Zhou:''' In the end, you only regret the chances you didn't take!
