{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Continues from previous quest)
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Okay, this should be far enough. Sorry for making you walk all this way. I am Natlan's current leader and Pyro Archon, Mavuika.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Lord Xbalanque. I, um... I said I was inviting you for a chat, but to be perfectly honest, this is also my first time doing something like this, so... I don't even know where to begin.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 01.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Oh?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Oh no... He doesn't sound too impressed...)
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 02.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' You mean you've never hosted a long-dead guy on his first trip home before? No worries, it's a first for me too.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' ...I didn't realize you also had a sense of humor.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 03.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Wait, really? Hang on, I think I just realized something.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 04.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' &mdash;You're telling me that neither you nor your companions know that I, Xbalanque, was totally hilarious?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' All the woven scrolls regarding your life depict you as a wise and upright person. According to legends, you also used the divine throne to negotiate with the [[Ronova|Ruler of Death]], establishing the set of rules unique to Natlan.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' As for your sense of humor... no sources ever touched upon it. Maybe it's better to say that we know even less about you than we expected.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 05.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' I see... In that case, allow me to re-introduce myself. I am the first Pyro Archon, Xbalanque. You may call me "Dear Beloved Sun," or just "Lanque" for short.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, talk about being overly familiar...
:{{DIcon}} Keep your voice down! Are you looking to get smacked...?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 06.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' And these two are?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Allow me to introduce {{Traveler}} and Paimon. They are important friends of Natlan, and our companions, great heroes who helped us defeat the [[Abyss]] for good.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 07.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Ah, I see. I was about to say, why did a child follow us all the way here... Ha! Though you could say the same for me. And judging by your expression, that's exactly what you're saying.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 08.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' And there's where you'd be wrong. This body belongs to [[Mausau|a child]] of present-day Natlan. I'm only possessing it temporarily.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I see. Your physical body couldn't be revived, so you had to borrow someone else's... But what about the original owner? Is he... okay?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 09.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' No need to worry. My existence has not affected this child in any way. This body's original occupant is currently experiencing a fantastic dream.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 10.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' I have my own plans. And as for my reasoning, you'll find out soon enough.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 11.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Alas, this borrowed body is a bit lacking when it comes to exercise, and hasn't really trained any aspect. I tried my best at the tournament, but could only get so far given my physical limitations.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that explains why you couldn't make a deep run... You're not used to this body, are you?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 12.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' I wish that was the only problem! I'm simply unable to do a lot of larger movements. Oh, and my usual climbing and jumping motions aren't exactly suited for him, either.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 13.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Also, you've got to be twice as careful in a borrowed body. If I pushed him too hard and got him hurt, I'd be no better than a criminal! I could never do anything like that.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Indeed. Still, the great shaman [[Citlali]] learned about your impending resurrection from the [[Wayob]], but we still don't know why you've returned.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 14.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Oh? Is it time to get serious, then? Alright, serious mode activated!
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 15.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Ahem. In any case, you've already touched on the topic.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 16.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' I did indeed strike a deal with the Ruler of Death. She once asked me why I prayed for her power as a mere mortal, and why I yearned to save a nation in peril.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 17.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' I convinced her with the promise of perpetual existence and the everlasting flame of life. So she shared her strength with me, and allowed Natlan to operate under brand new rules.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 18.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' I told her that the plan would be a grand, long-term one. One in which victory would not come for some time &mdash; certainly not within a mortal lifespan. Still, I knew that someone else would bring it home.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 19.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' She assented to my request, and became an observer of our tale. Seeing her interest, I also asked that I, as the one who laid the foundation, be granted an opportunity to see the new world with my own eyes if we actually did manage to triumph in the far future.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' So, your return is a special favor granted by the Ruler of Death.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 20.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' More like a bet I made with her. Even gods have things that pique their interest. I bet correctly on the outcome of this war, so this trip is my reward.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' How do you feel about the Natlan of today? Does it meet your expectations?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 21.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Oh, I like it a lot. Could you tell me more, by the way? I'd love to know how you managed to win the war.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 11.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' ...As you know, ours was an exceedingly grand, long-term plan.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 12.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I will skip over the most ancient parts, and start with what I know &mdash; the [[Cataclysm|battle]] from five hundred years ago.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 13.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The disaster struck suddenly, and Natlan was engulfed in darkness. Our land and faith were both shattered, and everyone believed that our nation's end was nigh.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 14.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' But even when thrust into battle against the Abyss, fate, and the passage of time, our heroes did not give up hope of victory. We each shouldered our heavy duty using the power that you left behind.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 15.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' All the Pyro Archons in the last five hundred years have devoted their lives to banishing the Abyss, rebuilding our tribes and faith, and uniting the people as one.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 16.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' As for me, I decided to head five hundred years into the future &mdash; that is, the present &mdash; so I might finally bring together our people's resolve, which has stood firm for thousands of years, and fight for our final victory.

:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 17.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Of course, I had prepared for the worst. That I would awaken to naught but monsters, corpses, and ruins where our nation once stood.

:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 20.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I've always believed you to be shrewd. Surely, such a quality was needed to bargain with the Ruler of Death, and win so much for us in the process.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 21.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Natlan was only able to overcome this crisis with your help.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 22.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' ...All these millennia later, and the people of Natlan have finally achieved victory over fate.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 23.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' If future generations will call me the one who created the rules and initiated the plan, then you are the one who inherited those rules, the final executor of the plan, the one who created a miracle.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 24.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Beginnings and endings, creation and change... Mavuika, you truly are a remarkable leader. It is my honor to have met you.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 22.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Please, you're too modest. Rather, it is our honor to welcome you back to this world.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 25.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Ah, and that's the perfect segue to something that you should know.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 26.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' You see... Uh, you don't have to worry too much about my second life, since I'll only be here for a single day. Like... from sunrise to sunset.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 23.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' A single day!?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What!?
:{{DIcon}} But the day... is almost over!
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 27.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Haha, that's why I said you won't have to worry too much about the boy this body actually belongs to. I'll be long gone by this time tomorrow!
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 28.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Besides, no one ever said I was actually going to return and stick around for years and years, right? This is just a short little outing back home, so I can see some of my compatriots again.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 29.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Still, I've gotta say, it has not been an easy trip. After being resurrected, I woke up in the home of a normal boy, and wanted to take a quick dip to relax, only to have my trouser leg snagged by a fishing line that came outta nowhere...
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 30.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' And once I finally made it to shore, I decided to take a stroll and see the sights, only to step into a trap along the way! Beats me who'd put a trap out there, and there wasn't even anybody around to check it!
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 31.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Thankfully, the bottom was pretty soft, so I lay down and took a nap before getting up to continue on my merry way.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (This is so embarrassing...)
:{{DIcon}} (I swear, with friends like these...)
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 32.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' After countless trials and tribulations, I finally managed to sign up for the tournament, but then I ran into [[Iansan|a girl]] who claimed to be a fitness coach. She insisted that my muscles weren't up to snuff and made me do twice as many warm-up exercises as everyone else...
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 33.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' *sigh* You guys in the future sure have it rough.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 24.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' ...
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 25.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Well, then... What's next for you?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 34.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Aw, what a great question. I was just about to get to that. You're a pretty considerate gal!
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 35.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' So, I do have a small wish that I haven't been able to fulfill.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 36.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' I managed to participate in the [[Pilgrimage]], but alas, my potential is restricted by this form. It sure would be nice if I could show everyone what I can actually do...
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Why is he stealing glances at us like that...
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 37.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Well, now that I've said it, care to help an old man out, hero?
:{{DIcon}} Huh? Okay... So, uh, what are you capable of?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 38.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Ahem! See, I was also quite the formidable warrior in my time &mdash; surely, a match for Mavuika. I mean, I was the first Pyro Archon, after all. I could shake the cliffs with a single punch, scale mountains with a single leap.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 26.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Very formidable indeed. So, you'd like to spar with me?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 39.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Yes.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 27.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Using your current body? Will he be able to handle it?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 40.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Don't worry, I'll find a suitable location for our duel, and a way to keep this body safe.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 41.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' The first sun... the ardent sun. This star is a flame, burning with a passion that will consume all.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 42.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' From the moment I first saw you, I knew you to be a true warrior, just like me.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 43.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Surely, you shall not refuse me this battle &mdash; O inheritor of my Ancient Name, the burning sun, "{{Rubi|Kiongozi|Leader}}" Mavuika.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 mavuika 28.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I accept.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 1 kidfighter 44.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Brilliant. In that case, let us free ourselves from mortal shape. Let the ancient souls guide you to the true arena of duels!

;(Enter the Temple of the Spirit)
:{{A|vo mwklq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What... is this place?
:{{DIcon}} I've never been here before...
:{{DIcon}} ...Such powerful pressure.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 2 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' ...Is this a temple of the spirit?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 2 kidfighter 01.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' This is the land of the sun, created by my soul. Only the sun and those blessed by it can survive here.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 2 kidfighter 02.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Me, you, you, and you. The sun, the other sun, Blessed One-One, and Blessed One-Two.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've been... blessed by the sun?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 2 kidfighter 03.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' The sun will remember the most virtuous stars. You are hope itself &mdash; the most radiant, most important friends we could have.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 2 kidfighter 04.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' We have invited you here, so you may witness the clash of suns.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 2 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I see... We've manifested in an almost fully spiritual, consciousness-like form, removing the limits of our flesh.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 2 kidfighter 05.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' That's right.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 2 kidfighter 06.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' As I said, I knew you to be a born warrior the moment I laid eyes on you. But there are two forms of human strength: that of the body, and of the spirit.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 2 kidfighter 07.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' The great Xbalanque, impressed upon a child's body, found less than a third of his original strength available to him. In that form, I'd lost my strength of body.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 2 kidfighter 08.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' But here, we meet as our true spiritual selves. In this place, even a child may shake heaven and earth due to the great soul within.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 2 kidfighter 09.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' What makes a true hero? Someone strong of body? Or strong of mind? Or... must one be strong in both to surpass human limits?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 2 kidfighter 10.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Which of these are you, Mavuika?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 2 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Ha. Well said, Xbalanque. Let us prove our mastery of both strengths through this battle &mdash; to Natlan, to each other, and to the rest of the world.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 2 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' You and I both know we'll never meet a better-matched opponent.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 2 kidfighter 11.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Indeed. That's exactly what I've always wanted.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 2 kidfighter 12.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' As a citizen of Natlan, as the Pyro Archon, as an opponent from across the millennia and a friend whom you never had the chance to meet...
:{{A|vo mwklq003 2 kidfighter 13.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Let us have a fair and honorable duel!
:{{Cutscene Description|Setting a time limit of a single brazier's flame, Mavuika and Xbalanque unleash their strength and hurl themselves into battle. In a few mere moments, you vaguely witness the battles that Mavuika has been through. Once upon a time, she fought and slew on the field, supported others and was supported by them, and bade friends a reluctant farewell. Did she not ever grow weary? You cannot understand this, but even as you seemingly mutter to yourself, you somehow receive her answer. The battle continues to heat up as the two exchange blows, each unwilling to give a single step, yet neither being defeated before the flame can be extinguished.}}

:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 mavuika 12.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' It was a great fight.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 01.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' That was an exhilarating battle, Mavuika. Haha, looks like this old man's still got some fuel left in the tank after all.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' You jest, Lord Xbalanque. Your spirit is as strong and youthful as ever.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 02.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Hmph... Come now, can't you tell I was making excuses for coming up just a hair short? Not by much, just the slimmest of margins...
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 03.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' ...Yet still, you actually won. I've always seen myself as the strongest warrior, but it would seem that the inheritance of Ancient Names has proven its worth after all.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 04.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' I bear the name, "{{Rubi|Kiongozi|Leader}}" &mdash; the "leader" of our people. After countless generations, this name came to you, and you used the power it accumulated over the years to defeat everything in your path.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 05.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' This battle has been most meaningful. Beyond the facts of victory and defeat, I've also learned a lot about you.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 06.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Take, for example, your strength. It is at once ruthless and gentle, both tenacious and sharp.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 07.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' You neither overwhelm your opponent with sheer power, nor defy them with only your strength of will. You possess a great understanding of your own might, and will convert all of it into fuel, so you may climb to even greater heights.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 08.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' It is thanks to heroes like you that this war was won. I'd never have been able to return to the mortal realm otherwise.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 09.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Your victory granted me this chance at a second life. Even if it is just for one day, the sun has risen again, to drive away the darkness.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 10.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Even the darkness of death, that once enveloped me, has been dispersed by your flames. Mavuika, you are the newborn sun, greater and more radiant.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 11.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Allow me to give you a present, to celebrate your victory.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, there's a prize, too? Paimon wants to know what it is! Coming from you, it must be super awesome.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 12.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' My journey is complete, and I have no more need for my remaining time. Mavuika, I would like to give you all my remaining life force, which I obtained from the Ruler of Death.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 13.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Use it to awaken those you wish to see the most. Surely, there must be at least one person that you'd like to meet.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!? So it's a blank check... to bring anyone back for a time?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 14.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Though Natlan possesses incredibly unique [[Ley Line]]s, it is still extremely difficult to meet the dead outside of the [[Night Kingdom]]. Now, take it.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 15.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Though we both became Pyro Archons in life, we were still born into this world as ordinary humans. There's no need to hesitate &mdash; just do what you think is best.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Thank you for the offer, but I don't think I'll be needing it.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The past lives on in my memories, and will always remain my treasure.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Meeting someone we can no longer see again will only lead to more longing. Rather than cling to the past, we should enshrine it in memory, ever loved and never forgotten.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mavuika...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (There's no hesitation in her gaze. She means what she just said.)
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 16.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' ...Haha, they were right. That's exactly the sort of person you are.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' "They"?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 17.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Your [[Haumia|parents]], [[Hine|sister]], comrades, and friends.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 18.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Those who walked with you, and those who left you behind. Those who crossed blades with you, and those who prayed for your safe return...
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 19.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' ...Each and every one. Mavuika, as one granted the special privilege to return, I can sense them calling for you and watching over you from within the distant winds.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 20.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' "Dear Mavuika, our esteemed [[Archon]], leader of our people. How have you been doing? We all miss you so."
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 together 01.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' "There are so many things we want to say to you, but if we really were to say them, they'd just be those simple, heartfelt words."
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 together 02.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' "The war is over, Mavuika. All our efforts had meaning, and all our struggles bore fruit. This is the fairest and most precious thing in the entire world."
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 together 03.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' "May you be happy in this era of peace. May you eat well, sleep well, always be full of energy, and never forget that we will always love you."
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' These are all words spoken by the people from the past... Their voices are echoing through this temple of souls.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Xbalanque... He knew from the start that Mavuika wouldn't accept his gift, but he proposed it all the same.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Was it so that he could pass on these words? He has long sensed the prayers from all the souls in the Night Kingdom. That must be why he created this special space, to bring their voices here...)
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 21.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Thank you. Those who have gone before will never forget you, even as you keep all their names deep within your heart.
;(Xbalanque's voice suddenly deepens, dropping into an adult register)
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 xbalanque 01.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Mavuika, my dear child. Though we have ascended to Archonhood, never forget that we are still human. Live as you please, in this age of peace you've forged with your own two hands.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' ...
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Why so formal all of a sudden? Seriously...
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Mavuika, where are you going?
;(Xbalanque's voice returns to normal)
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 22.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Oho, leaving already? Now you're the one acting all impatient!
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Since we're done with all the serious stuff, it's time to follow me.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Xbalanque. Doubt you've ever ridden a flamestrider in your current body, right?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 kidfighter 23.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Never even heard of such a thing, to be honest.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh! Are you gonna take him out for a ride?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' You're coming too.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 3 mavuika 11.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Come on. It's time for us to "live as we please."

:{{A|vo mwklq003 4 kidfighter 01.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Is this a board you can use to ride on the water? And you can stick it to the back of vehicles, too! Genius!
:{{A|vo mwklq003 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This is Mavuika's flamestrider! Oh, we call that board a "surfboard"!
:{{A|vo mwklq003 4 kidfighter 02.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Haha, you learn something new all the time!

;(While riding the [[spiritway]])
:{{A|vo mwklq003 4 kidfighter 03.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Playing with this stuff is part of everyday life, then?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! We're livin' good!
:{{A|vo mwklq003 4 kidfighter 04.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Ah, I wonder if I would've ever become Pyro Archon if we had had these gadgets around back then. I might've had too a bit much fun with them...
:{{A|vo mwklq003 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!? That would be terrible!
:{{A|vo mwklq003 4 kidfighter 05.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Agreed! Good thing they were only invented after I died, huh?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 4 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Hahaha, looks like I really am better after all, for becoming Pyro Archon even with all this temptation around.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Point Mavuika!
:{{A|vo mwklq003 4 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The hands of our friends at the [[Children of Echoes]] are as skilled as ever. They were already famed in your era, right? This bike was built by [[Xilonen|their most talented artisan]] in this age.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 4 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Speaking of which, we just passed them by.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 4 kidfighter 06.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Sweet!
;(Teleport to the outskirts of Ochkanatlan)
:{{A|vo mwklq003 5 kidfighter 01.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Is that [[Ochkanatlan]]? Ahh... Sure brings back memories.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh yeah! That was built in your time, right?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 5 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' It's long become a landmark. Very popular with tourists, so I hear &mdash; they think it's a lovely place.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 5 kidfighter 02.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Is that so? So that's how you all see it.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks so too! It's especially stunning if you look at it from a Spiritway.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 5 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The stories of the past become things people aspire to in the future. It's just like what they say &mdash; the apex reached by those who came before will become the everyday goals of those who come after. Everything is constantly changing for the better.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 5 kidfighter 03.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' That's good. That's how it should be. I'll bring those words back to the Night Kingdom, and share them with everyone there.
;(Teleport to the outskirts of "People of the Springs")
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' You can see the [[People of the Springs]] from here.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 kidfighter 01.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' They seem to be enjoying life. Haha, just like the people of Natlan back then.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 kidfighter 02.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' All kinds of things might happen during the day, but as the sun sets, you can always count on the People of the Springs to relax by the water, playing their instruments and dancing their worries away.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Because that's their way of life!
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 kidfighter 03.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Precisely. And so it is for every tribe.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 kidfighter 04.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' No matter how many years have passed, for the people who live here, some things will never change.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Well, you're the one most qualified to say something like that.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' So, what do you think? Satisfied with what you saw?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 kidfighter 05.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Very much so. Speeding across the water, the warm breeze against my face... It makes me very happy.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 kidfighter 06.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' I really do adore this world, just like a plant adores the sun.

;(Reach the end of the spiritway)
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We made it! Woohoo!
:{{DIcon}} Woohoo!
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 kidfighter 07.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Woo! Woohoo!
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 kidfighter 08.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Thank you, Mavuika. This has been a wonderful trip.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Lovely things are meant to be shared, after all. It's the least we could do for our friend.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 kidfighter 09.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Hahaha, I'll admit, I didn't expect people several thousand years in the future to see me as a friend.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 kidfighter 10.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Not that I'm complaining. This old man's had a great day today. Thank you, dear friends.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 kidfighter 11.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' I can still remember how nervous you looked when you saw me for the first time, Mavuika... I'll cherish that memory.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Oh. Is it almost time?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 kidfighter 12.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Yes, it is.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Thank you for coming back to see us. This meeting means a lot to me as well.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 kidfighter 13.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Mhm-hmm.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 kidfighter 14.ogg}} '''Xbalanque:''' Well, time to go. Don't forget to lead a happy life.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, already? Paimon's gonna miss you. See ya later, Xbalanque!

:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, he closed his eyes... Did he fall asleep?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Mhm. I can no longer sense Xbalanque's soul.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Well, it's gotten quite late, hasn't it?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Thank you for accompanying me this whole time. Let's hurry back, you must be starving.
:{{DIcon}} There'll be a victory feast tonight, right?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Yes. After the end of the Pilgrimage, we hold a banquet to congratulate the champion of the tournament.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 6 mavuika 11.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' There will be good food and plenty of it &mdash; You guys are gonna love it. [[Mausau]] should be there, too &mdash; I'll bring him over.

;(The scene transitions to a road near the stadium)
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you think there'll still be any food left over for us? It's kinda late and all...
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I'm sure the feast has already started, but don't worry, I'm sure [[Iansan]] will save some for us.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' She's very reliable. Leaving the tournament planning to her was a smart move.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, so she probably figured that we'd be gone a long time...
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Yeah, I told her as much too.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Ah, seems like they've prepared the thing.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What thing?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' See that row of braziers over there?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so that's what they are! They haven't been lit, so Paimon totally thought they were something else.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Here, watch this.
:{{Color|menu|Mavuika snaps her fingers, and the brazier is lit.}}
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! They're beautiful...
:{{DIcon}} Were they left for the three of us?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' This particular kind of brazier is called a "signal flame," and is reserved for those coming back late at night. The others set up an entire path using these signal flames to await our return.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Those returning to the tribes must light them with their own hands. The flames will illuminate the path ahead, and show the tribe that the person has made it back.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' "Even if you're surrounded by darkness, never forget &mdash; your friends wait for you in the distant light." Remember that feeling when the exhaustion of your journey creeps up on you.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Ah, you're back.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Archon, {{Traveler}}, Paimon! You were really gone a long time. We've already started grilling the meat.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' We had a long talk with Lord Xbalanque. It was pretty time-consuming.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Did it all go well?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 11.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' More than well. Xbalanque... He is a very good man. He far surpassed even my expectations.
:{{Black Screen|The people at the feast all gather around you, Paimon, and Mavuika. Mavuika gestures for everyone to move over and sit down at the drinking table, before beginning to tell the story...}}
:{{Black Screen|She reveals everything without reservation, holding nothing back and hiding no secrets. As a part of the deal made millennia ago, the ancient sun could only rise again for one day. Still it was enough time for her to recount all the people's achievements and hard work to him.}}
:{{Black Screen|As night fell, the sun disappeared once more. She returned with joy in her heart, and a child of the tribes on her back.}}
:{{Black Screen|The sun arose in that child's dream, and quietly set in his deep sleep.}}
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' So the only reason Lord Xbalanque didn't win the tournament is because he was limited by the physical body he was in...
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 12.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' That's right, but don't feel disappointed on his behalf &mdash; he himself was not upset about that turn of events.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 13.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' He had many revelations during this journey. And as he said, strength of mind is as important as the strength of the body. He realized that after failing to make it to the final 32.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No matter how many times Paimon hears it, it's still so funny to think that Xbalanque didn't even make it that far...
:{{DIcon}} You'd have never expected to hear those words next to each other.

:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 15.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Kinich, you've proven yourself a true warrior and athlete. Congratulations on your triumph in the Pilgrimage!

:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mausau 04.ogg}} '''Mausau:''' I feel like I dreamed a very long dream. I was super strong in that dream, too... I could jump up onto the roof with one leap, and I could climb, fly, and glide...
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 18.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' It wasn't a dream. Your body did go through all the motions of the tournament. You are already an outstanding contestant.

:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mausau 06.ogg}} '''Mausau:''' You know, Mom and Dad always say that my health isn't the best, and I might not be able to do all the things everyone else can... But right now, I feel like I can fly!

:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yeah! As long as you put in the work, you'll do great, I know it! That's how it is for all of us.

:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Vegetable...
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mausau 08.ogg}} '''Mausau:''' Yeah, I will!
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mausau 09.ogg}} '''Mausau:''' Oh, but the Pilgrimage was only half of the dream. I think, after that... I somehow got into a fight...

:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mausau 10.ogg}} '''Mausau:''' ...Ah... Uhh...
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mausau 11.ogg}} '''Mausau:''' I think it was... our Archon.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 19.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' That wasn't a dream, either. I did have a duel with Xbalanque.

:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 20.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Haha, I was hoping to save this until later, but since we're already on this topic, I've got another piece of good news to share.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 21.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Namely, that we crowned another champion today. Lord Xbalanque and I engaged in an all-out duel, as worthy rivals from across the millennia.

:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 27.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Of course.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh right, Mavuika, {{Traveler}} said there was something to ask you.
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 28.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Hmm?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 hero 03.ogg}} {{A|vo mwklq003 7 heroine 03.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' I was just thinking... You were fighting Xbalanque for such a long time...
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 hero 04.ogg}} {{A|vo mwklq003 7 heroine 04.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' Did you ever falter, or wonder if you might lose to him, even for a second?
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 29.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' ...
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 30.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' No. In battle, there is no time for that. So, it never crossed my mind.
:'''{{Traveler}}''' (Huh? That's the same answer as last time...)
:'''{{Traveler}}''' (...How come she knew what I was thinking?)
:{{A|vo mwklq003 7 mavuika 31.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The night is still young. Cheers.

===Mausau, Ororon, and Iansan===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Mausau, [[Ororon]], or Iansan)
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 mausau 01.ogg}} '''Mausau:''' Say, what kind of vegetable do you think I'll become? A red one, or... a green one?
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' You? I have a feeling... that you might turn into an onion.
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 mausau 02.ogg}} '''Mausau:''' An onion?
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 olorun 02.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Someone who looks ordinary, but who can make anyone who attacks you break down and weep.
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 mausau 03.ogg}} '''Mausau:''' Really? That sounds super strong...
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' What are those two even talking about...
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 olorun 03.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Onions are super powerful. One of my friends happened to be cutting onions when I came over to his house. He began to cry, and the [[Saurian]]s also began to cry, and eventually, nearly every living creature in the room was crying.
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' What about you? Did you cry too?
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 olorun 04.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' I was also in the room, but I shielded my eyes with my cloak just in time. [[Cacucu]] and [[Ifa]] couldn't see my face, so they thought I cried too.
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 mausau 04.ogg}} '''Mausau:''' I'd like to become an onion-man, and make people cry too!
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 olorun 05.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Sure, no problem.
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' I really want to interrupt you, but I have no clue what to say to derail this line of conversation...
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 olorun 06.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Well, Iansan, you're a tiny... mushroom. Yes.
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' No one asked you!
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 iansan 05.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Still, a mushroom, yeah? Not bad. They're tough, strong, and full of life. I like 'em.<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "Although... mushrooms are pretty resilient, I guess? Okay, I approve."</ref>
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 mausau 05.ogg}} '''Mausau:''' Then you must be full of life too, right, Miss?
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 olorun 07.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Yes she is.
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 iansan 06.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Yeah... Sure, why not?

===Mualani, Kinich, Ajaw, Kachina, and Citlali===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to [[Mualani]], Kinich, [[Ajaw]], [[Kachina]], or [[Citlali]])
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Whoa, our Archon really is amazing! And super brave, too. She even went toe to toe with Lord Xbalanque!
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Don't be so modest. You'd have done the same.
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 ajaw 01.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Hah, like any of us wouldn't! I'd have jumped at the chance! What about you?
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' I... I wouldn't dare!
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Fighting is in a warrior's nature. If the opportunity was presented to you, I'm sure your instincts would make that choice for you.
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' *sigh* I swear, you're all just brimming with energy over here... This is Lord Xbalanque we're talking about. Our greatest ancestor! Are you really that into sparring with your elders?
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Granny Citlali! Let's spar sometime, too!
:{{A|vo dialog mwklq003 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' No, no, we're absolutely not doing that.
