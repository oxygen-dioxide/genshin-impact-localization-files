|vo_01_01_tx         = You want me to introduce myself? I've gone by many names and titles during my journey. Although each one is more eminent than any ordinary mortal could imagine, they're all just water under the bridge to me now.<br />Call me whatever you like. Go ahead, let me see what you can come up with. Don't disappoint me.

<!-- Chats -->

|vo_02_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} Chat - The Wind.ogg

|vo_06_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About {character} - Heart.ogg
|vo_06_02_tx         = I'll leave that kind of thing to fate. Obsessing over something that's destined to be ever out of one's reach is just a waste of time. I have more important things to attend to at the moment.

|vo_06_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Us - Collaborators.ogg
|vo_06_04_tx         = I'll never be one of the good guys. I'm just here to pay my dues after what you've done for me.<br />But what about you? Shouldn't you come up with some excuse for our meetings? If one of your friends mistakes you for collaborating with the enemy, you're on your own.

|vo_07_01_tx         = Although the idea of "divine favor" makes me a little ill, I'm not going to be picky about a new source of power. You think there's some kind of meaning behind the element of [[Anemo]]? Hah, why did that thought even occur to you? The gods aren't guided by any kind of rationality or moral compass. Haven't I shown that to you already?

|vo_07_02_title      = Something to Share
|vo_07_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share.ogg
|vo_07_02_tx         = I've got nothing. Ask me anything if you want. If a question is interesting enough, I may give you an answer.

|vo_07_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Interesting Things.ogg
|vo_07_03_tx         = Look. The birds are showing off their plumage, the squirrels are busy hoarding food, and humans are laboring for their livelihoods. Truly, simple animals don't need anything complicated to be fulfilled.

<!-- About Others -->

|vo_08_01_tx         = While I still had value as a pawn, she might have had other reasons to keep me alive. It's certainly possible that it was because she's wise or benevolent, or happened to see a hint of loneliness within me... You think I'm trying to think the worst of her? Hah, did you really expect anything else? In case you've forgotten, I'm no saint.
|vo_08_01_mention    = Lesser Lord Kusanali

|vo_08_02_title      = About the [[Raiden Shogun]]
|vo_08_02_friendship = 4
|vo_08_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About the Raiden Shogun.ogg
|vo_08_02_tx         = She completely neglected her own creation, and to add insult to injury, she said it was because she "couldn't bring herself to intervene" in my fate...

|vo_08_03_title      = About the [[Tsaritsa]]
|vo_08_03_friendship = 4
|vo_08_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} About the Tsaritsa.ogg
|vo_08_03_tx         = Everyone praises her for her kindness and benevolence, but they forget that love is also a form of sin. What if she's just trying to compensate for something?
|vo_08_03_mention    = Tsaritsa

|vo_08_04_title      = About [[Pierro|The Jester]]
|vo_08_04_friendship = 4
|vo_08_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} About The Jester.ogg
|vo_08_04_tx         = The Jester is a survivor of [[Khaenri'ah]]. Besides that singular fact, I know very little about him, and never had any kind of close association with him. He seems to want something from me, though. In the past, he assigned to me many important tasks, including a number of trips to the [[Abyss]].
|vo_08_04_mention    = Pierro

|vo_08_05_title      = About [[Il Capitano|The Captain]]

|vo_08_05_tx         = "The ever-righteous Captain," "the brave and fearless Captain," "the nigh-invincible Captain"... Even my mechanical ears demand maintenance after listening to so many compliments from the members of the [[Fatui]]. Don't you think that possessing absolute righteousness is actually a latent danger? And that's without taking his great personal strength into account.
|vo_08_05_mention    = Il Capitano

|vo_08_06_title      = About [[Il Dottore|The Doctor]]
|vo_08_06_friendship = 4

|vo_08_06_tx         = It's a pity that Lesser Lord Kusanali already forced him to erase so many of his segments. The joy I would have derived from slicing them apart one by one...
|vo_08_06_mention    = Il Dottore,Lesser Lord Kusanali

|vo_08_07_title      = About [[Columbina|Damselette]]
|vo_08_07_friendship = 4
|vo_08_07_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Damselette.ogg
|vo_08_07_tx         = Let me ask: what should you do if you were to encounter a "damsel" who is oblivious and innocent at any given time, and unconcerned and unfeeling in any given situation? If it were me, I could at least challenge her to a fight. But if it were you... with your conscience, I would stay away from her.
|vo_08_07_mention    = Columbina

|vo_08_08_title      = About [[Arlecchino|The Knave]]

|vo_08_08_tx         = A wolf in sheep's clothing. To exert a higher level of control over people, she puts on a graceful and cordial front. Most of those who have seen her true, crazy self... have gone poof.

|vo_08_09_tx         = Only someone as dense as Childe would think The Rooster is looking after him and his family out of the goodness of his heart. Although the mayor has indeed done a number of things for their benefit, anyone with a brain would be able to tell that the underlying meaning is "your entire family is in my hands."
|vo_08_09_mention    = Pulcinella,Tartaglia

|vo_08_10_title      = About [[Sandrone|Marionette]]
|vo_08_10_friendship = 4
|vo_08_10_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Marionette.ogg
|vo_08_10_tx         = She has a terrible personality and cares for nothing outside of her own research. But even with that amount of dedication, she still produced a copious amount of garbage, and could only secure a ranking that's still one whole place beneath my own. How pitiful.
|vo_08_10_mention    = Sandrone

|vo_08_11_title      = About [[Pantalone|Regrator]]

|vo_08_11_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Regrator.ogg
|vo_08_11_tx         = Oh, the ninth-ranked guy. He's obsessed with the idea of "fair exchange," to the point of wanting to overthrow the natural imbalance between gods and humans. But, I guess it's just how ordinary mortals are like &mdash; it's easy for them to come up with pointless delusions. Honestly, it's nothing worth writing home about, just like how there's also nothing impressive about his abilities or choice of partner. Hmph. Anyone who chooses to work closely with The Doctor is sure to meet a nasty end.
|vo_08_11_mention    = Pantalone,Il Dottore

|vo_08_12_title      = About [[Tartaglia|Childe]]

|vo_08_12_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Childe.ogg
|vo_08_12_tx         = He's simple of mind and not that strong of body. Naming him to the lowest-ranked seat lowered the [[Harbinger]]s' collective prestige. Thankfully, I'm no longer part of that group.
|vo_08_12_mention    = Tartaglia

|vo_08_13_title      = About [[La Signora|The Fair Lady]]

|vo_09_03_tx         = I once thought that deification would allow me to get rid of all of my pointless emotions, but I've since abandoned that view. Anger, whether it be from others or myself, is too convenient and useful as a tool.<br />How can some people just never become angry? I find that impossible to even imagine.
