|description = Humanity's best friend!<br>They say that these are the descendants of the favored, specially-bred hunting hounds of Old Mondstadt's [[Mondstadt Aristocracy|aristocracy]]. They now have their own fair share of sub-breeds throughout the seven nations. Though they have high ancestry, the Black-Back Hounds of today are known far and wide for being both dependable and approachable. Perhaps something similar may be said for the arrogant, domineering nobles of yesteryear being supplanted by the warm-hearted and humble [[Knights of Favonius]] today.
