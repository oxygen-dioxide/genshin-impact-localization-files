In the ancient past, she used to be an [[Angel]], the same race that Seelies devolved from.<ref name="Quest">{{Ref/Quest|Beneath the Secret Source}}</ref> She created the Night Kingdom and gave the tribes of [[Natlan]] guidance in ancient history, leading to the foundation of modern Natlan. 

==Profile==
===Appearance===
The Lord of the Night has yet to be shown with a physical or humanoid appearance, only appearing as a mystical swirl of smoke-like Ley Line energy.

However, based on depictions of angels found in Dragonspine's [[Mural Room]] and during the [[World Quest]] ''[[Revelations from the Past]]'', it can be surmised that like her sisters, the Lord of the Night once had a winged humanoid form with a long crest, horns, or headdress extending behind her head. It is also possible that she stood several times taller than a human, though this may have simply been artistic license.

==Story==
Under the guidance of [[Ronova]], the Lord of the Night created the Night Kingdom after the original [[Ley Line]]s of Natlan were severely damaged during the battle between the [[Heavenly Principles]] and the [[dragon]]s. To aid the people of Natlan, she used the fragments of the old Ley Lines to reconstruct a similar network, forming the Night Kingdom, which would later be strengthened by [[Xbalanque]].<ref name="Quest"/>

In ancient Natlan, the human [[Chaac]] was the first to make contact with the Night Kingdom, later leading to the creation of the [[Wayob]] and a permanent relationship between the tribes of Natlan and the Lord of the Night.<ref name="Myths of the Night Realm"/> The tribes communicated with the Lord of the Night through the mediums of both obsidian<ref>{{Ref/Quest|To the Night, What is the Night's}}</ref> and living human sacrifices (often prisoners of war), and she gave them guidance in turn. The Lord of the Night instructed the tribes to spread the "Essence of Sacrifice" over Natlan's sterile soil, a practice which closely resembles the [[Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri]] practiced by [[Watatsumi Island]], to make the land habitable for humans at the ancient dragons' expense.<ref name="Damaged Stone Tablet"/>

Due to [[Abyssal Corrosion]] in the Night Kingdom, the Lord of the Night was severely weakened and fell into a deep slumber until [[Capitano]] awakened her with the Secret Source mechanism in an attempt to rewrite Natlan's Ley Lines. She initially agreed to sacrifice herself for the sake of the nation, but [[Mavuika]] denied the attempt, and thus she decided to watch over them. She gave [[Citlali]] and [[Xilonen]] a [[Pilgrim's Chronicle]] to allow the [[Traveler]]'s deeds to be recorded in Natlan. After the Abyss was repelled from Natlan, Capitano approached the Lord of the Night, wanting to help save the souls of the dead by substituting his own death for Mavuika's, as a death was required as payment for Mavuika's use of Ronova's powers.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Fuel Named "Fate"}}</ref>

Having agreed to this plan, when the time came for Mavuika to offer her life as payment, the Lord of Night ultimately absorbed Capitano's life force instead, making her essentially immortal. The Lord of the Night thanked Mavuika, the Traveler, Citlali, and [[Ororon]] for their role in saving the nation before returning to the Night Kingdom.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|When All Becomes a Monument}}</ref>

===Etymology===
* In {{W|Mesoamerica|Mesoamerican}} mythology, the ''Yohualtecuhtin'', meaning "{{w|Lords of the Night}}" in Nahuatl, were deities who each ruled over one night in a nine-night cycle. Each lord represented a different omen, which applied to their respective night.
