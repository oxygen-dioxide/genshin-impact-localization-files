===Etymology===
* Concerto dal Cielo is Italian for "Concerto from the Sky."
** To be precise, ''concerto'' is a common word for "concert" in Italian and does not necessarily mean "{{w|concerto}}," a certain style of classical music. However, the latter interpretation is more in line with a term used in the Chinese version, {{lang|''xiézòu''|zh=协奏|zh_tl=concerto}}. The same argument also applies to Spanish and Portuguese versions, where both a concert and a concerto are expressed by the same word.
** "Cielo" literally means "Sky" but is also used to indicate Heaven as well (generally from kids: ex. When talking to children about someone that died/went to heaven, they'll be told that they went to the sky).
* A concert (not necessarily of concertos) by angels is a popular theme in religious paintings, including ''{{w|Concert of Angels}}'' (1608) by {{w|El Greco}}, a prominent Greek painter of the Spanish Renaissance.
