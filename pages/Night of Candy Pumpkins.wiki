# Travelers are allowed multiple submissions for this event but only one prize can be won per Traveler. The prizes cannot be stacked.
# The event is held on multiple platforms, and winning submissions will be selected from across all platforms. The above rewards are the total rewards for all platforms. There is no amount of prizes set aside for each platform and region.
# If the same entry wins on multiple platforms, the prize will be issued according to the platform it was first posted on after final verification (only one prize will be issued).
# After the list of winners is announced, if Travelers have any objection to the prize-winning works, they can give feedback through the customer support email or in-game customer support. If a prize-winning work is suspected of violating the event rules, we will revoke the prize and this user's account will be permanently banned from participating in any future community events.
# By participating in this event, you agree to have your game UID published on the event platform. Game UIDs will only be used to issue Primogem rewards to winning players and will be protected in accordance with the legal and policy provisions of local privacy protection laws.
# If the issuance of rewards fails due to the player providing the wrong game UID, the official team will not re-issue the reward.
# Primogem rewards will be delivered within 30 business days after the results are announced.
