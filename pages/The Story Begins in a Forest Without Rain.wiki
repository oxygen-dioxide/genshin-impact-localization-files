;(Upon obtaining quest)
:{{A|vo yqeq301 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Seems like we were just sent a strange book. It does have a really nice cover, though...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's really curious... Let's read it and see what it's about!

;(Interact with the book)
:{{A|vo yqeq301 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Wake up! Heyyy~!
:{{DIcon}} (...)
:{{A|vo yqeq301 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, you're finally awake! Paimon was worried sick!
:{{DIcon}} What happened...?
:{{DIcon}} Where are we...?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No idea... Paimon just woke up, and then we were here... Paimon's head is all dizzy...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The scenery here looks different, too... *whimper* What should we do, {{Traveler}}? Please don't tell Paimon someone abducted us and brought us to some strange place that we can never leave...
:{{DIcon}} Calm down, Paimon...
:{{DIcon}} Let's take a look around first...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...You're right. Better to think of this as... the beginning of a new adventure!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew... Thank goodness you're still here. If Paimon woke up alone, she probably would be trembling in a tree hollow...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's follow this path for now. We might be able to meet someone and figure out what this place is all about!

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo yqeq301 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, did those plants by the road look weird to you? It almost looked like... they were made of paper!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And those two frogs over there... Yeah, they look like pieces of origami!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 3 frogb 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Oh! By the shade of a lotus leaf, [[Stream]], don't tell me you forgot how to jump!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 3 froga 01.ogg}} '''Stream:''' I... I didn't forget, [[Firecracker]]. I'm just... not sure if what I remember is correct.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 3 frogb 02.ogg}} '''Firecracker:''' Hah, next thing you know you'll have forgotten how to sing, much less notate a score. You still remember why we call you Stream, don't you?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 3 froga 02.ogg}} '''Stream:''' Yeah, because I've got a great singing voice. Although, these days, the name seems more ironic than anything...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 3 frogb 03.ogg}} '''Firecracker:''' Not just a great voice, one that evokes the gentleness of early morning dewdrops flowing into a spring! So, cheer up, and make the jump over! If you're still unsure, just use that roll of magic thread. I won't laugh, I promise. Now, don't tell me you've forgotten how to use that as well...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 3 froga 03.ogg}} '''Stream:''' I haven't forgotten everything, Firecracker. Your name, for instance &mdash; it's kinda hard to forget that you're named after your fiery temper. Now do me a favor, and pipe down for a second. I'll be right over.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Y&mdash;You saw that too, right!? Paimon's not seeing things, is she?
:{{DIcon}} I saw some talking paper frogs...
:{{DIcon}} The paper frogs jumped away...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This place is getting more confusing by the second...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, uh... Why don't we go after those two frogs? They didn't look evil or anything. Plus, they might be able to help us out!

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess we're not catching up to those frogs... They were so fast, Paimon couldn't even tell where they hopped off to in the end...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Excuse me, honored travelers... Did you come from the [[Cliff of Prophecy]] perchance?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh! The... The chubby paper hamster just talked!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Chubby... Who are you calling chubby? I've just got a slightly thicker layer of paper on me, that's all!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 03.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Ahem... Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Almond, and I'm an elder of the [[Forest of Blessings]]. I've been waiting here for the Hero of Prophecy to arrive.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}... Could you pinch Paimon just to make sure she's not still dreaming?
:{{DIcon}} I think I need pinching as well...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 04.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Pinching, you say? I can help with that... although you'll have to get a little closer, my arms are rather short.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' T&mdash;That's alright... We just need a minute to collect ourselves. Okay... Let's think things through...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We know for sure this isn't the world we're familiar with. The talking paper animals and all the paper trees and plants make that pretty clear.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 05.ogg}} '''Almond:''' "The Hero from another world, supported by their companions, shall restore peace to this world..." That is what the prophecy says.
:{{DIcon}} The prophecy...
:{{DIcon}} "This world"...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 06.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Oh, dearie me &mdash; I completely forgot to introduce you to this world, didn't I? And here I am, getting all excited by the arrival of the Hero... You'll have to excuse me, this old brain isn't what it once was... all shell and no nuts.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 07.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Perhaps my once-glossy paper has faded past the point of no return...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's okay, really! You can just tell us all about this world now.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 08.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Let me think... Where should I even begin? I've pretty much forgotten everything that happened in the past...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 09.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Ah, right, I believe the story circulating along the pulp of this forest goes as follows...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 10.ogg}} '''Almond:''' A long, long time ago, three goddesses created this world, and named it "Simulanka."
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 11.ogg}} '''Almond:''' The [[Goddess of Creation]], who presides over matter and magic, created the mountains and rivers, and gave us life. Her powers also paved the way for Simulanka to exist in numerous worlds.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 12.ogg}} '''Almond:''' After the Goddess of Creation came the [[Goddess of Prophecy]], with dominion over the stars and the course of fate itself. She induced the sky to spin, and the earth to move. Even to this day, her statue still stands tall at the highest point of [[Constellation Metropole]].
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 13.ogg}} '''Almond:''' The final Goddess was the [[Goddess of Fate]], she who reigns over all treasured tales and dearest wishes. She bestowed upon us the fierce and everlasting feelings of love and hate, and showed us the meaning of death and hope.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, they all seem super impressive! Sounds like they really did a lot.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 14.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Of course. All new residents of Simulanka come to the Forest to thank the Goddess of Creation for founding this world, and travel to Constellation Metropole to witness the divinations of the Goddess of Prophecy's numerous oracles.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 15.ogg}} '''Almond:''' After that, they make their way to the end of the world, and tell the Goddess of Fate about their most cherished dreams. *sigh* At least, that's how it used to be.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... "How it used to be"? Did something bad happen?
:{{DIcon}} You mentioned something about "restoring peace to this world"...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, yeah! That has to do with the Hero you're waiting for, right?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 16.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Yes... This old brain of mine may have forgotten many things, but I will never forget the day the evil dragon descended upon our Forest...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 17.ogg}} '''Almond:''' It came down from the skies in an ominous black mist and ravaged our homeland... its gigantic footprints can still be seen in the Kingdom of Breezes and Bells. We're incredibly fortunate that no one was hurt...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds terrifying...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 18.ogg}} '''Almond:''' The terror doesn't stop there, I'm afraid... Ever since the attack, the Calligraphy Tavern in the forest has been closed. No one knows why, but it is a catastrophe of the highest order for us forest-dwellers.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? A catastrophe of the highest order... all because a Tavern closed? If we were talking about Mondstadt, here, Paimon might understand, but is it really all that serious?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 19.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Good Goddess of Creation above, we'd take even the greatest flood over the closure of the Tavern!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 20.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Wet paper will dry out with time, fallen trees can be restored... But the Calligraphy Tavern is the only source of the {{Color|buzzword|Magic Tonic}} that sustains all creatures in the forest!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Magic... what?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 21.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Magic Tonic. It was gifted to the forest by the Goddess of Creation herself &mdash; a special potion that helps us maintain our vitality.
:{{DIcon}} What happens if you stop drinking it?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 22.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Well... Our bodies will gradually crumple and become brittle, until they eventually disintegrate entirely. Our {{Color|buzzword|colors will fade}}, and we'll start to lose our memory, until we can't even remember our own names...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? But wait, Grandpa Almond, does that mean you've already...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 23.ogg}} '''Almond:''' I'm afraid so... The color has all but completely faded from my paper. To be honest, all I really remember is that I'm supposed to wait here for the Hero of Prophecy. But, I've already forgotten who gave me that order to begin with...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then, we've got to act fast! How can we help?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 24.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Oh, brave pixie, may the Goddess of Fate reward you and your friend for your kindness.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 25.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Could it be... you're the Heroes I've been waiting for all along?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... Not sure how we'd know that. Plus, we can't even remember how we got here. So, it's not looking too promising...
:{{DIcon}} We were just following the road, and then ended up here...
:{{DIcon}} We're trying to find a way back to our world...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 26.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Well... this is turning out to be quite the conundrum for old almond-brain here. The prophecy never mentioned anything like that...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 27.ogg}} '''Almond:''' For now, why don't you come with me to the Hut of Blessings? Our Forest Fairy lives there. Maybe she'll know what to do.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, a Forest Fairy? Like, one that knows magic?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 almond 28.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Oh, you betcha. She's prophesized to join the Hero on their journey.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 4 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well then, she sounds like exactly the kind of person we need! Please lead the way, Grandpa Almond!

;(Approach the Hut of Blessings Teleport Waypoint)
:{{A|vo yqeq301 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... That meadow over there looks pretty strange.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 5 almond 01.ogg}} '''Almond:''' That's what the Calligraphy Tavern looks like, now it's lost all of its color...
----
;(Approach the Hut of Blessings)
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 almond 01.ogg}} '''Almond:''' This is the place. If you could just wait a moment, the Fairy should be&mdash;
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 01.ogg}} '''???:''' ...! {{Traveler}}, Paimon!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Paimon knows that voice...

:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' ...It's really you! I'm so happy to see you!
:{{DIcon}} Yep... Same here...
:{{DIcon}} Maybe... calm down a bit first...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Ah! Sorry, sorry...
:{{Introductory Note|Nilou}}
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So Nilou is the Forest Fairy? Well, you certainly look the part!
:{{DIcon}} Your outfit is lovely.
:{{DIcon}} It's perfect for you.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Hehe, thank you! But to be honest, I'm still getting used to it...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 05.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' It's the weirdest thing. I remember I was reading a book at the [[Grand Bazaar]], and then I guess I must have fallen asleep at some point, because... well, then I woke up dressed like this...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 06.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' And, in my dream, someone spoke to me. They said: "You are the Fairy of the Forest of Blessings. Now go, save the forest with your magic."
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 07.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' At first, I thought this whole world was just part of the dream, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't seem to wake up. I couldn't find anyone I knew from the real world, either...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds similar to what happened with us! We also have no idea how we got here...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 08.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Anyway, sorry for my reaction back there... I got a bit too excited when I saw you two...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's okay, we totally understand! We were looking for a way out, too. At least we know we're not alone!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 almond 02.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Oh, blessed be the Goddess of Fate above, you're already friends with the Fairy of the Forest!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 09a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 09b.ogg}}--> '''Nilou:''' Grandpa Almond, thank you so much for bringing my friends here. Could you let the others know I'm coming? I'll head over right away.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 almond 03.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Of course, leave it to me!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 almond 04.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Hey-ho, pistachio! Today truly is a blessed day.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, Nilou, looks like you made short work of getting to know the locals!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 10.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Well... when I arrived here yesterday, Grandpa Almond told me all about the state of this world. Since they think of me as their Forest Fairy, I just felt like I had to try to help them.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohh! So, you mean like... using some kind of Forest magic to repair the Tavern?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 11.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Unfortunately, I don't know how to use the "magic" of this world. I've tried using my Vision, but it doesn't seem to work here...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 12.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' If the books stored in this hut are anything to go by, this seems to be the place where the Goddess of Creation first made the townspeople of this Forest.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 13.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' She folded the pages of books into small origami animals, gave them life with her magic, and with time, that's how the Forest of Blessings took shape.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... Maybe one of the books here could teach us how to use magic?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 14.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' I read them all, but only found one reference to magic&mdash;
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 15.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' "The incantation, 'Abracadabra,' means 'to create what I say.' This is a world made of words, where fantastical powers can be wielded by all."
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okaayy... So, basically, everyone in this world can use magic? That's nice, but still kinda vague...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 16.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Yeah, from the other books I read, it seems like this goddess really likes to play fast and loose with the details.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... what should we do now? Um, didn't you say you were going somewhere, Nilou?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 17.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Oh, yes. I was going to help some of the other residents of the Forest. They've been busy making preparations to reopen the Tavern, so I thought I could help out.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Got it! Guess we should just focus on what we can do for now.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 18.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' This whole thing is making me pretty nervous, actually... It's like I've been pushed on stage without being taught the choreography!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 19.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Since I'm already wearing the costume, though, I might as well try to play the part. It's what a professional dancer would do.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 20.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' And, who knows, maybe I'll find my own magic along the way! All I can do is try, right?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' At least you're optimistic!
:{{DIcon}} We'll be there to cheer you on, too.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 6 nilou 21.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Thank you! Then, let's go.

:{{A|vo yqeq301 7 mousea 01.ogg}} '''Chestnut:''' Look, the Forest Fairy is here! And she brought her companions! Grandpa Almond was right, they do look promising!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 7 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Hello there, everyone. I heard you were working on the piping for the Calligraphy Tavern. Is there anything we can do to help?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 7 mousea 02.ogg}} '''Chestnut:''' Ah, we wouldn't dream of troubling you with our petty problems, my lady! Don't you worry, we have it all under control.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You sure about that? Because from where Paimon's floating, the piping is looking pretty chaotic...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 7 mousea 03.ogg}} '''Chestnut:''' Ah, yes... we have my careless friend to thank for that. He promised we could leave the pipe-connecting to him, and... well, the results speak for themselves.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 7 mouseb 01.ogg}} '''Ginkgo:''' Hey...! I just wanted to inspect each pipe! This is the network the Magic Tonic has to flow through. I was just trying to be thorough! So, I... I disassembled the whole thing...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 7 mousea 04.ogg}} '''Chestnut:''' Yeah, and now you've forgotten how to put the thing back together! *sigh* Have you been eating too many nuts again? 'Cause you are what you eat...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 7 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Please, don't fight. I know everyone wants the Tavern to reopen as soon as possible so that the Forest can return to normal.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 7 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' So, why don't you let us help out?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, we're here anyway, so we might as well be helpful! We just need to reassemble these pipes, right?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 7 mousea 05.ogg}} '''Chestnut:''' Well, if you're offering... Basically, the pipes need to be connected properly to allow the Magic Tonic to {{Color|buzzword|flow through}}. If you put the wrong pipe in the wrong place, the Tonic will get stuck halfway...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 7 mouseb 02.ogg}} '''Ginkgo:''' Attention to detail is key.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 7 mousea 06.ogg}} '''Chestnut:''' Says the guy who messed the whole thing up in the first place!

;(After the cutscene)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Chestnut:''' Sure, let me know when it's connected!
:{{DIcon}} Let the Magic Tonic flow!
<!--

;(After starting the flow with the pipes incorrectly connected for the first time)
:{{A|vo yqeq301 8 mousea 01.ogg}} '''Chestnut:''' Something doesn't seem quite right... The Tonic is stuck...

;(After solving the puzzle)
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 mouseb 01.ogg}} '''Ginkgo:''' Amazing! You did it!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Now, the Tonic will flow into everyone's cups without getting stuck, right?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Gotta say, though, Paimon is starting to get pretty curious about this Magic Tonic... Um, could she have a teeny tiny sip? Just a little taste! Please!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon...
:{{DIcon}} Stop being greedy...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's not greed! It's curiosity!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 mousea 01.ogg}} '''Chestnut:''' Well... if it's really just one sip, I guess that would be fine...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 mouseb 02.ogg}} '''Ginkgo:''' Just... Be careful! This is one of the last cups left in the entire Forest! We're supposed to save it for our research!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just a sip, promise! Okay, here goes... Hmm...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Ugh! What was that? It's sticking to Paimon's tongue! Wait, is this just regular {{Color|buzzword|ink}}?
:{{DIcon}} "Ink" and "paper," huh...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Wait, does that mean... What the legend says is true?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' "The Goddess of Fate used ink to compose her stories on paper, and the Goddess of Creation used her power to bring those tales to life."
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No wonder the Tavern is so important to the Forest...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Maybe the Fading Disorder occurs when the ink within the body dries up... That would explain why the beings here are forgetting their own stories...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 mousea 02.ogg}} '''Chestnut:''' I'm not sure I can really wrap my head around this conversation, but there's no need to get all worked up on our behalf, my lady. With the pipe installed, I'm sure the Tavern will be up and running in no time.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 mouseb 03.ogg}} '''Ginkgo:''' What do you mean, can't wrap your head around it? The Fairy is recounting the story of how the Goddesses gave us life. In fact, I've seen the Goddess of Creation with my own eyes!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 nilou 05.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Really?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 mousea 03.ogg}} '''Chestnut:''' Don't be ridiculous, there's no way you're old enough to have met her! We're the same age &mdash; and I think I would know, considering we went to tell our wishes to the Goddess of Fate together! So stop talking a load of paper mache.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 mouseb 04.ogg}} '''Ginkgo:''' Fine... It was my grandfather, alright? He was the one that saw her.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 mouseb 05.ogg}} '''Ginkgo:''' He said that one day, after he finished work, he saw the Goddess of Creation grant us life with his own eyes.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 mouseb 06.ogg}} '''Ginkgo:''' In her hands, she held the very paper used to form our bodies. She whispered something into the pages... And then, suddenly, a paper frog was born, ready to leap into the world! Oh, it was spectacular!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 mousea 04.ogg}} '''Chestnut:''' Cut the theatrics, will you? You weren't even there...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, so... That's it? Paimon thought creation magic would have a little bit more... pizzazz.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 mouseb 07.ogg}} '''Ginkgo:''' Oh! So, in your world, the creation of life is a much showier affair? I'm learning something new every day!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... Well, that's not exactly what Paimon was trying to say...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 nilou 06.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Magic... doesn't have to be spectacular...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 mousea 05.ogg}} '''Chestnut:''' That's enough out of you. All your boasting is confusing our kind Fairy!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 nilou 07.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Oh, no, it's alright. I actually think I understand the magic of this world a bit better now. Thank you.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 9 mouseb 08.ogg}} '''Ginkgo:''' The honor was all ours, my lady.

;(After the cutscene)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Gingko:''' I told you, I saw her!

;(Approach Firecracker and Stream)
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 frogb 01.ogg}} '''Firecracker:''' Stream! Your rhythm is off again! At this rate, it doesn't even matter if the Tavern reopens. The band's not going to even get any gigs.

:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Uh, hello there... I hope we aren't interrupting your rehearsal.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, these are the two frogs we saw on the road a little while ago!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 frogb 02.ogg}} '''Firecracker:''' Ah, the Forest Fairy is here! For the love of lotus leaves and dewdrops, Stream, you've really gotta put in some effort now!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 froga 02.ogg}} '''Stream:''' But... I...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Oh, don't pressure yourselves on my account! Are you rehearsing for a show?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 frogb 03.ogg}} '''Firecracker:''' Sure are! You see, our group regularly performs for guests at the Tavern.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 frogb 04.ogg}} '''Firecracker:''' We've been out of work for quite some time, with the closure and all. But, after hearing of the Fairy's arrival yesterday, we figured we needed to get in performance shape right away!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Hehe, I understand how you feel! Back at the Grand Bazaar, [[Zubayr Theater]]'s always busy with rehearsals too.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 frogb 05.ogg}} '''Firecracker:''' The Grand Bazaar? Do people there sing on lotus leaves as well?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Yeah, they do, and it's a reaaaaaally big one! You're the conductor of your group, aren't you? You remind me of [[Sheikh Zubayr|Mr. Zubayr]]!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 frogb 06.ogg}} '''Firecracker:''' Ah, then he must be an ambitious director, one who would do anything to avoid disappointing a single member of the audience. It's just...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 froga 03.ogg}} '''Stream:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 nilou 05.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Is there anything we can do to help you, Mr. Stream?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 froga 04.ogg}} '''Stream:''' Oh, no, no, my problems are... mine and mine alone...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 froga 05.ogg}} '''Stream:''' It's just... after the Tavern closed, I somehow forgot how to sing... I'm always a few beats behind everyone else, and I keep singing out of key...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 frogb 07.ogg}} '''Firecracker:''' You were our trump card, our best singer by a mile...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 froga 06.ogg}} '''Stream:''' I know, I know... But... *sigh*
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So he is a victim of the Fading Disorder, too...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 nilou 06.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Don't be sad, Mr. Stream! Whenever I've forgotten important dance steps in the past, my friends at the Grand Bazaar always stick by my side to encourage me!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 nilou 07.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' They smile, and patiently tell me everything's going to be okay. Then they play the melody for me over and over, until the steps finally come back to me... Now, it's our turn to help you.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We just need to help you remember how to sing, right? {{Traveler}}'s got a great sense of rhythm. We can help keep you in time!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 frogb 08.ogg}} '''Firecracker:''' Well, what do you say, Stream? I think it's a great idea. Just focus on the lyrics, and the Fairy's friends will help you stay on beat.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 froga 07.ogg}} '''Stream:''' Are... Are you sure? This is... really asking a lot...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 11 nilou 08.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Don't worry about it, Mr. Stream. It'll all be worth it when the Tavern reopens and we finally have the chance to hear your marvelous singing voice.

;(Approach Almond and Citrus)
:{{A|vo yqeq301 16 almond 01.ogg}} '''Almond:''' My dear Citrus, please tell me you're joking. We can't have you out of commission with the Tavern about to reopen!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 16 alpaca 01.ogg}} '''Citrus:''' I'm sorry, Grandpa Almond, it's the truth. I was just too excited for the reopening, and must've fallen asleep in an awkward position.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 16 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Grandpa Almond! We're here to help!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 16 almond 02.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Oh, hazelnuts on high, you could not have come at a better time! Please, allow me to introduce you. This is the bartender of the Calligraphy Tavern, Miss Citrus.
:{{DIcon}} She's so tall...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 16 almond 03.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Miss Citrus is supposed to add all kinds of delicious fruits to the Magic Tonic. Her additions are what turn it into the finest brew in the land. She's indispensable to the operation of the Tavern!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 16 alpaca 02.ogg}} '''Citrus:''' I appreciate the kind words, Grandpa Almond, but... Owww... My neck...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 16 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Are you alright?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 16 alpaca 03.ogg}} '''Citrus:''' Ah, terrible timing... getting a kink in my neck at a time like this...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 16 alpaca 04.ogg}} '''Citrus:''' Could you give my tail a little twist? That should help free up the movement in my neck. I would do it myself, but I can't reach on my own, and Grandpa Almond is too old, and as light as a feather...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 16 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The neck and tail... are connected?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 16 alpaca 05.ogg}} '''Citrus:''' Of course they're connected! Just like how you can't have a rainbow without rain. Anyway, you just need to position me {{Color|buzzword|at the right height}} to pick the fruits, and then put them {{Color|buzzword|in the barrel over there}}.

;(After picking up or placing the Bulle Fruit incorrectly)
:{{A|vo yqeq301 17 alpaca 01.ogg}} '''Citrus:''' Hmm, this doesn't seem quite right...

;(Approach the Hut of Blessings)
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, since we've taken care of most of the tasks, all we need to do now is reopen the Tavern!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' But, we still don't know how to use the magic of this world. We don't even know why the Tavern closed in the first place...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... Oh! What about the method that one hamster mentioned? You should try it, Nilou!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' You mean, the creation magic his grandfather saw outside the Hut of Blessings? Hmm, I wonder... How exactly did the Goddess of Creation give them life...?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Maybe... you don't need to understand it, just give it a try! Everyone here calls you the Forest Fairy. Maybe you have the magic powers already, and you just don't know it!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' In other words... this Forest is a stage, and all I need to do is... step out into the spotlight? Hehe, sounds just like a fairytale!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, we are surrounded by talking origami animals and magic potions, after all... Almost seems like anything's possible in this place.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' You're right, Paimon. We won't know anything unless we try. In that case... Let's see...
:{{Black Screen|Nilou takes out a page from a book, and folds it into the shape of a hamster...}}

:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 nilou 06.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' I once saw one of our prop people make something similar. It looked really cool, so I took some time during my break to learn the basics. It's not a bad way to stave off sleepiness, either!

:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 nilou 13.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Nice to meet you, Padisarah. I'm Nilou, the Fairy of this Forest. From this day forward, this place is now your home.

:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 nilou 14.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' I hope you'll grow up happily in this Forest.

:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 almond 02.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Hahaha, you can leave the little one with old Almond for now. Oho, this sure brings back memories... It's been such a long time since we last held a welcome ceremony.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 almond 03.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Here, Padisarah. Come to Grandpa Almond.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, now that Nilou has mastered the Goddess' magic, we should be able to reopen the Tavern, right?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 nilou 15.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Hmm... Grandpa Almond, could you send a few people to check the underground space beneath the Tavern?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 almond 04.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Oh, of course! May I ask why?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 nilou 16.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' The moment I used magic, I sensed something... strange down there. I have a feeling it's connected to why the Tavern had to close down.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 almond 05.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Of course, we'll look into it right away.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 nilou 17.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Make sure you listen to Grandpa Almond, Padisarah. Don't go running off on your own!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 mousec 06.ogg}} '''Padisarah:''' Padisarah... listen... running!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 almond 06.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Hey, come back here, you! Wait!!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yup, that's Nilou's creation all right. She's got so much energy... Anyway, how did you manage it, Nilou?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 nilou 18.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Well... All I did was say my wishes for her out loud. Maybe the magic is in the words, themselves, just like the book said!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This place is seeming more like a fairytale by the second.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 nilou 19.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' I mean... we're somewhere called the Forest of Blessings, so it kind of makes sense.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, anyway, Paimon thinks this magic suits you perfectly, Nilou!
:{{DIcon}} What about the space under the Tavern...
:{{DIcon}} What had you so concerned?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 nilou 20.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' ...When I brought Padisarah to life just now, I was able to sense the magic flowing through the Forest &mdash; in the flowers and trees, and inside the creatures that live here...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 nilou 21.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' But for some reason, there's a hollowed-out space beneath the Tavern where I couldn't sense anything at all...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 almond 07.ogg}} '''Almond:''' We're back, my lady!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That was fast!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 almond 08.ogg}} '''Almond:''' You were right, there was something under the Tavern that I've never seen before! It looked transparent, and gave off a... clinking sound when I knocked on it.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 nilou 22.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Transparent and clinking... Oh! I've got it!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, already!?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 nilou 23.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Haha, you've got to use fairytale logic, Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} ...Is it an "ink bottle"?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 nilou 24.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' That's right! {{Color|buzzword|An empty ink bottle}}, to be exact. Still remember the taste of the "Magic Tonic" you took a sip of, Paimon?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, it was... ink! Oh, Paimon gets it now.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 nilou 25.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, will you come gather some ingredients with me? I learned what we need to make the Magic Tonic back in the Hut of Blessings.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure thing! What do we need to get?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 nilou 26.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Hmmm... "A setting sun that never sets," "a dragon that cannot fly," and "a moon that only shines at night."
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? Where are we supposed to find crazy things like that?
:{{DIcon}} She means sunsettias, snapdragons, and Nilotpala Lotuses.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? How did you get that so fast?
:{{DIcon}} "Fairytale logic," Paimon.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 19 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Logic, huh? Lucky guess, more like...

;(Paper frogs nearby)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''<!--Faded Green -->Paper Frog:''' L&mdash;Look! The moon's been stolen!

;(After defeating the fungi, optional)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''<!--Faded Green -->Paper Frog:''' Thank you, Miss Fairy!

;(After collecting all ingredients)
:{{A|vo yqeq301 20 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That should be everything, right? What should we do now?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 20 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Hmm... Let's go back to the Hut of Blessings.
----
;(Approach the Hut of Blessings)
:{{A|vo yqeq301 21 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Give me just a second. I'm gonna go fetch an ink bottle from the other room.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 21 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't get it... All the ingredients are super tasty, but, somehow, the final product turns into ink...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 21 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, anyway, Paimon's not going anywhere near the stuff this time, not even if you bribed her...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 21 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Sorry to keep you waiting.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 21 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Let's see... According to the book, first you do this... then this... and then...
:;(Nilou adds three Sunsettias, followed by three Snapdragons, and finally, three Nilotpala Lotuses)
:{{A|vo yqeq301 21 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' ...It's done!
:[[File:Item Magic Tonic.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo yqeq301 21 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, magic sure makes everything super convenient!
:;(Obtain {{Item|Magic Tonic}})

;(Submit the Magic Tonic to Almond)
:;(Almond drinks some of the tonic and regains his color)
:{{A|vo yqeq301 21 almond 01.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Yes, this is it... This is exactly the Magic Tonic we need!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 21 nilou 05.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Grandpa Almond, could you take the concoction to the room underneath the Tavern and place it next to the transparent bottle you found? I'll handle the rest.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 21 almond 02.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Of course! As you command, so it shall be done!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 21 nilou 06.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Phew... I still get nervous at times like this. It's just like when you step on stage, and you can tell that every single person's gaze is fixed right on you.
:{{DIcon}} Relax, Nilou.
:{{DIcon}} We're right here with you!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 21 nilou 07.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Hehe, thanks, you two! I can't tell you how great it is to have you by my side. Almost makes me feel like I've been blessed by the Goddess of Fate, too!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 21 nilou 08.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Let's go. We shouldn't keep everyone waiting.
----
;(Talk to Almond or Padisarah, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq301 almond 02.ogg}} '''Almond:''' I've placed the bottle where you requested. The rest is up to you, my lady.

;(Talk to Firecracker or Stream, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq301 frogb 02.ogg}} '''Firecracker:''' For the sake of the Forest Fairy, Stream, please give me your best performance when we take the stage!
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq301 froga 02.ogg}} '''Stream:''' Rest easy, Firecracker. I've been waiting for this day for a very long time.

;(Talk to Chestnut or Ginkgo, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq301 mouseb 02.ogg}} '''Ginkgo:''' ...See, I was right! That's exactly what the Goddess of Creation did all those years ago!
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq301 mousea 02.ogg}} '''Chestnut:''' Ugh, brag away. But, don't think you're getting out of carrying all those pipes with me later.

;(Talk to Citrus, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog yqeq301 alpaca 02.ogg}} '''Citrus:''' What flavor of Magic Tonic should I whip up first?

;(Approach the Calligraphy Tavern)
:{{A|vo yqeq301 22 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' ...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 22 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Phew...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 22 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Forest... Please heed my words, and accept my blessings...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 22 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' May your spring of wondrous magic never run dry, and may all who call you their home lead happy, fulfilling lives...
;(A cinematic plays)
:;(Nilou uses her "magic" to restore the Calligraphy Tavern)
:;(The Tavern opens up like a pop-up book and paper plants begin to sprout)
:;(Color is restored to the area and the paper animals within)
:;(The cinematic ends)
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 mousec 01.ogg}} '''Padisarah:''' Fairy Nilou is amazing!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, it's so pretty! What a beautiful Tavern!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' It matches the scenery of the Forest perfectly. I was so surprised when it suddenly opened up like that... Just like a pop-up book!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 almond 01.ogg}} '''Almond:''' ...I remember now. I remember everything!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 almond 02.ogg}} '''Almond:''' ...It was me. I was the one who went to the top of {{Color|buzzword|Constellation Metropole}}, and witnessed the Goddess's prophecy!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 almond 03.ogg}} '''Almond:''' "The Hero who shall save this world will descend upon the Cliff of Prophecy. The Hero, supported by their companions, shall restore peace to this world."
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So the prophecy really did have all the answers, you just forgot the first half...
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 almond 04.ogg}} '''Almond:''' That's why I was waiting near the Cliff of Prophecy... Haha, wonderful, simply wonderful! There's still some hope left for old Almond after all!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is the Cliff of Prophecy that place with the huge mural? 'Cause that is where we woke up, but we don't remember anything about how we got there. Also, we didn't get a change of clothes like Nilou... Are we definitely the Heroes?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 almond 05.ogg}} '''Almond:''' If not you, then who else? You've already helped the Fairy revitalize our Forest. To us, that makes you heroes, prophesized or not.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright! Either way, we're going to keep adventuring, even if just to figure out how we can get back to our world.
:{{DIcon}} We can also help resolve any crises along the way.
::{{A|vo yqeq301 23 paimon 05a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, that's exactly right! Helping people we meet on the road is kind of our thing!
:{{DIcon}} We can also help resolve your dragon problem along the way.
::{{A|vo yqeq301 23 paimon 05b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep! We've beaten up plenty of dragons already, so what's one more?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 almond 06.ogg}} '''Almond:''' As expected, the words of the Goddess of Prophecy always come true.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' I'll come with you. It can't hurt to have a magical Fairy tag along, right?
:{{DIcon}} Thought you'd never ask!
:{{DIcon}} It would be our honor, my lady.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Heroes and fairies, dragons and new adventures... Heh, this is sounding more and more like a fairytale by the second!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 almond 07.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Hmm, I would say your next stop should be Constellation Metropole. It's Simulanka's most prosperous city, just across the sea.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 almond 08.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Once you've arrived at the Astral Garden at the highest point in the city, maybe you can try seeking divine counsel from the Goddess of Prophecy herself.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 mousec 02.ogg}} '''Padisarah:''' ...Are you leaving, Fairy Nilou?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' I'm afraid so. There are still other people who need my help. I won't go far, though, and I'll come back to visit the minute I have time to spare.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' So, be a good girl, Padisarah, and help out Grandpa Almond whenever you can, alright?
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 mousec 03.ogg}} '''Padisarah:''' Mhm! Got it! Padisarah will wait here for you!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 almond 09.ogg}} '''Almond:''' Hahaha, that's a good girl, Padisarah. Ah, I almost forgot &mdash; if Constellation Metropole is where you're heading, you'll need to take the [[Maritime Express]].
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 almond 10.ogg}} '''Almond:''' I'll head to the station first thing tomorrow morning and wake up that lazy station master for you. Why don't you take a break for the rest of the day? You should savor the beautiful scenery of the Forest before you go.
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds great! Paimon definitely feels tired after being on the go for so long. There's a spot in the Tavern with Paimon's name on it!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 alpaca 01.ogg}} '''Citrus:''' Oh? Sounds like someone is ready to order!
:{{A|vo yqeq301 23 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oooh, well, if you're offering... Paimon will take a glass of Bulle Fruit Tonic! ...Um, but hold the Tonic, hehe!
