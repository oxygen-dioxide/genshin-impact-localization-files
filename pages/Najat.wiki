{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Najat:''' Let me see... As for the stuff we put in storage today... Yup, the numbers are correct.
:{{DIcon}} Hey. Are you...
::'''Najat:''' Ah, sorry, sorry. I didn't mean to ignore you &mdash; I was just doing a mental tally of some goods.
::'''Najat:''' This is where we store necessities for the rest of the village. We have to check the number of goods here every day to ensure that nothing is missing.
::'''Najat:''' Not to worry, though. [[Habachi]] may be a little strict, but we do not simply grill everyone who passes by for no good reason.
::{{DIcon}} Seems like this warehouse is a big deal.
::'''Najat:''' That's right. Everyone can see that as well, so there's no real point intentionally hiding it.
::'''Najat:''' If the village were ever to be in peril, we will immediately stop the White Lift, cut the suspension bridge, and defend the warehouse at all costs.
:{{DIcon}} Well, see you around.
::'''Najat:''' ...Eh? Ah, right, see you!
