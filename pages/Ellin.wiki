==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ellin:''' Do you need something? Sorry, I'm all sweaty.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Ellin/Increasing Danger|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Ellin:''' This game is mine to lose!
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Ellin:''' S&mdash;So it's possible to win this way... Hmm...
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror...
:;(After completing ''[[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]]'')
:::'''Ellin:''' It's very scary, but I'm actually not all that worried.
:::'''Ellin:''' I believe that Master Jean will protect us, and all of Mondstadt!
:::'''Ellin:''' *sigh* If only I too were a member of the Knights. I do wish that I could fight alongside Master Jean...
:;(After completing ''[[A Long Shot]]'')
:::'''Ellin:''' It's just as I thought. Even Stormterror couldn't stand against Master Jean!
:::'''Ellin:''' Even though Jean said that that traveler was a big help to her, I'm sure she was just being modest. She must've done the lion's share of the work!
:::'''Ellin:''' If only I could have fought alongside Master Jean! We would have vanquished Stormterror together, and then, at the award ceremony, she would have looked at me with a smile on her lips...
:::'''Ellin:''' Just thinking about it makes my heart soar...
:::'''Ellin:''' Yes, I must take this chance and train hard before the next crisis comes...
:{{DIcon}} What sword style is that?
::'''Ellin:''' Oh... I'm copying Master Jean's technique.
::'''Ellin:''' Every time she wields her sword... You just know it's a Grand Master at work.
::'''Ellin:''' Only those of great character can use a sword fighting style like that, right?
::'''Ellin:''' It seems like I can't just focus on power training. I need to start building character, too!
:{{DIcon}} So you're with the Knights of Favonius?
::'''Ellin:''' Who, me? You think I have what it takes? Really!?
::'''Ellin:''' Yay, woohoo! My training must really be working after all.
::'''Ellin:''' Actually I'm not a knight yet, but I'm confident I will make it through the tryouts.
::'''Ellin:''' Then I'm gonna climb the ranks to captain, then get promoted to Master Jean's second-in-command, and when Jean gets to retirement age, she will shake my hand and say...
::'''Ellin:''' ...Whoops, I'm getting ahead of myself! Anyway, watch this space 'cause I'm gonna outdo my feckless father by a long way, that's for sure!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I hope you succeed.
:::'''Ellin:''' Thank you. I will definitely make it, just like the Dawn Knight from Ballads of the Squire...
:::'''Ellin:''' Have you read this book? I've finished it so many times! If you've got the time, you should definitely give it a read.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Ballads of the Squire|text=Ballads of the Squire (I)|20|type=Book}})
:{{DIcon}} Sorry for bothering you.
::'''Ellin:''' Oh it's no problem. I'm going to carry on with sword practice now, so keep your distance.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
* Ellin's imaginary friend is [[Jean]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Child's Secret}}</ref>
* On [[Twinning Isle/2.8|Twinning Isle]] during the [[Summertime Odyssey]] event, a Night Raven Statue named Raven Squire seems to be the "Immernachtreich" counterpart of Ellin as it also wants to be a knight like Sir Oz and wants the player to demonstrate how to destroy the dummies in one fell swoop.
