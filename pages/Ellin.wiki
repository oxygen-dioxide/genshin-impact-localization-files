==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ellin:''' Do you need something? Sorry, I'm all sweaty.
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror...
:;(After completing [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]])
::'''Ellin:''' It's very scary, but I'm actually not all that worried.
::'''Ellin:''' I believe that Master Jean will protect us, and all of Mondstadt!
::'''Ellin:''' *sigh* lf only I too were a member of the Knights. I do wish that I could fight alongside Master Jean...

:;(After completing [[A Long Shot]])
::'''Ellin:''' It's just as I thought. Even Stormterror couldn't stand against Master Jean!
::'''Ellin:''' Even though Jean said that that traveler was a big help to her, I'm sure she was just being modest. She must've done the lion's share of the work!
::'''Ellin:''' If only I could have fought alongside Master Jean! We would have vanquished Stormterror together, and then, at the award ceremony, she would have looked at me with a smile on her lips...
::'''Ellin:''' Just thinking about it makes my heart soar...
::'''Ellin:''' Yes, I must take this chance and train hard before the next crisis comes...

:{{DIcon}} What sword style is that?
::'''Ellin:''' Oh... I'm copying Master Jean's technique.
::'''Ellin:''' Every time she wields her sword... You just know it's a Grand Master at work.
::'''Ellin:''' Only those of great character can use a sword fighting style like that, right?
::'''Ellin:''' It seems like I can't just focus on power training. I need to start building character, too!
:{{DIcon}} So you're with the Knights of Favonius?
::'''Ellin:''' Who, me? You think I have what it takes? Really!?
::'''Ellin:''' Yay, woohoo! My training must really be working after all.
::'''Ellin:''' Actually I'm not a knight yet, but I'm confident I will make it through the tryouts.
::'''Ellin:''' Then I'm gonna climb the ranks to captain, then get promoted to Master Jean's second-in-command, and when Jean gets to retirement age, she will shake my hand and say...
::'''Ellin:''' ...Whoops, I'm getting ahead of myself! Anyway, watch this space 'cause I'm gonna outdo my feckless father by a long way, that's for sure!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I hope you succeed.
::'''Ellin:''' Thank you. I will definitely make it, just like the Dawn Knight from Ballads of the Squire...
::'''Ellin:''' Have you read this book? I've finished it so many times! If you've got the time, you should definitely give it a read.
:;(Obtain [[Ballads of the Squire|Ballads of the Squire (I)]])
:{{DIcon}} Sorry for bothering you.
::'''Ellin:''' Oh it's no problem. I'm going to carry on with sword practice now, so keep your distance.

==Trivia==
* Ellin's imaginary friend is [[Jean]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Child's Secret}}</ref>
* On [[Twinning Isle/2.8|Twinning Isle]] during the [[Summertime Odyssey]] event, a Night Raven Statue named Raven Squire seems to be the "Immernachtreich's" counterpart of Ellin as it also wants to be a knight like Sir Oz and wants the player to demonstrate how to destroy the dummies in one fell swoop.
