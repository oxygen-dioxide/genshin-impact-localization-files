==Life in Fontaine==
===Music===
Rock 'N' Roll music originated from Fontaine.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Xinyan|About Xinyan: Rock 'N' Roll}}</ref>

===Technology===
Fontaine's people are particularly savvy with technology, although not as much compared to [[Snezhnaya]] - the [[Mikage Furnace]] was developed in [[Inazuma]] by several experts, including [[Xavier]]. When the core went critical and threatened to leak [[Tatarigami]] energy, Xavier was able to develop a containment barrier in an instant, and later on made a less-than-optimal device to purify it.

The [[Kamera]] originated from Fontaine, allowing people to take pictures.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Snapshots}}</ref> Another variant, the Film Kamera, allows people to create videos, which can be used for a variety of purposes.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Tatara Tales (Quest)}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|"The Seventh Samurai"}}</ref>

According to Santon, the air in Fontaine is toxic implying that it is an industrious nation comparable to Snezhnaya,

==Economy==
[[The Steambird]] is a newspaper that hails from Fontaine. They have readers and writers all over [[Teyvat]]. Currently, there are two known columns affiliated the newspaper; "All Things Astrological", overseen by [[Mona]],<ref>{{Ref/CS|Mona|All Things Astrological}}</ref> and "[[The Steambird#Teyvat Food Notes|Teyvat Food Notes]]", overseen by [[Traveler|Long Erjun]].

==Festivals and Holidays==
The Iridescence Tour is described as a famous music festival that originates from Fontaine and run by several organizers.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Tricky Situation}}</ref>

==Languages==
In the Inazuma World Quest [[Tatara Tales]], Xavier states that people in Fontaine use the phrase "c'est la vie", which is French for "That's life" or "That's just life."

==Politics==
According to [[Yanfei]], Fontaine has a notoriously complex law system in place.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Yanfei|About Us: Relationships}}</ref> This is in part due to the current Hydro Archon, the [[God of Justice]], who lives for the [[Court of Fontaine|spectacle of the courtroom]], seeking to judge the other gods, but knows not to make an enemy of the [[Celestia|divine]]. Individuals from Fontaine appear to be judged by the court for their responsibilities when performing tasks. According to [[Patrice]], the tiniest infractions are considered crimes that can come with severe punishments if not handled properly. For example, academic researchers from Fontaine have to be mindful with their fund and resource spending, as "wasting public funds" and "misappropriating academic resources" can be punishable by bankruptcy at best.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Vibro-Crystal Projections}}</ref>

The God of Justice is not the one of the original [[The Seven|Seven]]. The previous Hydro Archon, now deceased, sent the [[Lochfolk]] across Teyvat to spy on the people to connect them to the world. After her passing, the Lochfolk refused to acknowledge the God of Justice as the Hydro Archon and continue on with their former master's request.
