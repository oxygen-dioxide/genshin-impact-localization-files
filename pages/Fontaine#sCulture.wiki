==Life in Fontaine==
When [[Liben]] visited Fontaine, he states that the locals are quite antsy, and they believe that some type of "judgement" is soon to come.<ref>Event NPC Dialogue: [[Liben]] &mdash; [[Marvelous Merchandise/2022-11-28/Story|Marvelous Merchandise (2022-11-28)]]</ref> This could be related to [[Prophecy of Fontaine|the prophecy]] which states that the people of Fontaine, excluding the [[Hydro Archon]], will eventually dissipate into water.<ref name=specialprogram>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/2E73BKNtOXI Version 4.0 Special Program]</ref> After the prophecy passed, people do not worry about it any longer and continue on with their daily lives.

Like in other nations, humans make up the majority of the population, but there are also other species, anthropomorphic beings such as the [[Melusine]]s, and once upon a time, the [[Oceanid]]s.

Diving is a popular activity in Fontaine, with some even using it for their daily livelihoods. Non-Vision holders have to use a large, bulky diving suit to go underwater, while Vision holders regardless of each nation can simply go in without any issue.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|page=Fiction and Reality Inside and Outside the Frame}}</ref>

Though the nation itself appears to be in relative calm, there are plenty of criminal activities hidden from public view; banditry by the [[Treasure Hoarders/Enemy Group|Treasure Hoarders]] are a commonplace outside of the [[Court of Fontaine]], and there are many criminal organizations, ranging from syndicates like the [[Borja Family]] to more dysfunctional groups like the Elegant Tableware Confrerie. The upper classes of Fontainian society also appear to engage in child trafficking by exploiting loopholes in the law, as shown with [[Lyney]], [[Lynette]] and [[Wriothesley]] in their youth.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lies Cast Shadows Under Gathered Lights}}</ref>

In the [[Fortress of Meropide]], the prisoners have their own set of lives as they are not under the jurisdiction of the Court of Fontaine despite being their ''de facto'' prison. The prison's inhabitants make use of the terms '''overworld''' (the surface) and '''underworld''' (the prison). As the prison has a very notorious reputation among the law-abiding, people who are sentenced there and finish their sentences are generally ostracized even after release. Wriothesley, the current Administrator, sees the prison as a land of "rebirth" and his relaxed policies, coupled with the potential ostracization upon returning to society, has resulted in some people deciding to stay even after their sentences are finished.

===Technology===
Fontaine's people are particularly technologically savvy, although not as much as in [[Snezhnaya]]. [[Alain Guillotin]] was a pioneer of Fontainian technology in the times after the cataclysm, inventing kinetic cores, the [[Arkhe]] energy system, clockwork mechanisms (and the subsequent [[Clockwork Meka]]), and establishing the still-operational [[Fontaine Research Institute]].<ref name="VCR">{{Ref/Quest|Vibro-Crystal Reharmonization}}</ref> Like Snezhnaya, some Fontanians use guns, though not as widespread.

The [[Mikage Furnace]] was developed in [[Inazuma]] by several experts from Fontaine, one of them being [[Xavier]]. When the core went critical and threatened to leak [[Tatarigami]] energy, Xavier was able to develop a containment barrier, and later on made a device to eventually purify it.<ref name="Ref/Quest|Tatara Tales Quest">{{Ref/Quest|Tatara Tales (Quest)}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Tatara Tales: Process Is Everything}}</ref>

The [[Kamera]] originated from Fontaine.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Snapshots}}</ref> There also exists a video variant, the Film Kamera.<ref name="Ref/Quest|Tatara Tales Quest" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|"The Seventh Samurai"}}</ref>

[[Garcia]], a Fontainian, is in the process of inventing a "Numbering Machine," a device that can perform rapid calculations. It is implied that the natural progression of his research will be the modern computer.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Garcia's Paean}}</ref>

With Fontaine's most advance technologies, it is possible to create a four-sided aquarium using just one piece of glass.<ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|Shaded Clarity}}</ref>

According to [[Santon]], the air in Fontaine is "practically toxic fumes" compared to the forests of Sumeru, suggesting a degree of air pollution.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Ref/Quest|Where Are the Fierce Creatures?}}</ref>

Clockwork Meka are a series of [[automatons]] built by the people of Fontaine, which utilizes Arkhe, an energy system unique to the region which is divided into two categories; Pneuma and Ousia, while combining both results in Annihilation energy. While the Clockwork Meka can be used for menial labor and entertainment, they can also be modified for combat purposes, such as the [[Icewind Suite]]<ref name="specialprogram" /> and [[Gardemek]]s. Other powered Clockwork Meka include the [[Maintenance Meks|Mekafish]], meant to help maintain Fontaine's waters, though issues had arose such as them eliminating all nearby sources of life to do so. The process of making Pneumousia is unknown, though Neuvillette is states that he has full control over it after regaining his powers.

The other energy source used was Indemnitium. It is generated from the process of "judgment" by the [[Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale]], a machine created by [[Focalors]] that "harvests the people's belief in justice" and converts it into energy.<ref name="specialprogram" /> According to Focalors, the amount of Indemnitium the Oratrice stored would be enough to power Fontaine for millennia were it not used for her own execution. 

===Cuisine===
Fontaine's cuisine is usually refined and elegant. Afternoon tea is fairly popular among the upper classes, and is often served with some of Fontaine's many desserts, such as [[Rainbow Macarons|macarons]], [[Coffee Bavarois|coffee custard]], [[Fontinalia Mousse|mousse]], and [[Fruity Trio|fruit tarts]]. There is a large number of foods offered, from casual options such as [[Fish and Chips]], to lavish dishes such as [[Fontainian Foie Gras]]. [[Fonta]] is a popular drink in the nation, which is usually sweet and colorful, though attempts have been made to branch out into other flavors.

Similarly to the people of [[Mondstadt]], Fontainians are generally not fond of spicy food.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Receiver of Friends From Afar: Part I}}</ref>

Due to how Melusines perceive differently compared to humans, their form of cuisine, similarly to the [[Aranara]], is usually considered unfit by humans for consumption.

===Language of Flowers===
Fontaine has their own flowers, which have hidden meanings behind them; gifting a [[Rainbow Rose]] signifies attachment and romance,<ref>{{Ref/Item|Rainbow Rose|note=Description}}</ref> a [[Romaritime Flower]] loyalty and unswerving oaths,<ref>{{Ref/Item|Romaritime Flower|note=Description}}</ref> a [[Lumidouce Bell]] separation and a desire to return.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Lumidouce Bell|note=Description}}</ref> There are alternate meanings for some flowers, however these are less used and usually for special purposes.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Leroy: Queen of the Night's Aria}}</ref>

===The Arts===
Fontaine is well known for its love of the arts, particularly the performing arts &mdash; music, theatre, and opera.

====Performing Arts====
In Fontaine, theater is an essential part of ordinary life &mdash; it is said that "to say that you grew up watching the theater is no different from claiming that you were raised drinking water."<ref>{{Ref/CS|Navia|1}}</ref> Most shows are held at the [[Opera Epiclese]]. Under [[Furina]], the citizens even treated their judicial trials like performances.

Theater has been a component of Fontainian culture since at least 500 years ago, in the time of the famed playwright [[Coppelius]]. His plays are still performed today, and have likely influenced Fontaine's penchant for romantic themes. The [[Icewind Suite]] was intended to be a live art piece based on his final work, "Clockwork Coppelia."

Fontaine also holds annual music and film festivals. Its largest music festival, the [[Iridescence Tour]], is trying to branch out into other regions.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Thousand Miles for an Enigmatic Tune}}</ref> The recent [[Fontinalia Festival#Fontinalia Film Festival|Fontinalia Film Festival]] was organized by the Fontaine Film Association to introduce more people to the art form, implying future iterations.<ref name="Muskets">{{Ref/Quest|The Crack of Muskets Breaking the Silence}}</ref>

According to Xinyan, Rock 'N' Roll music was brought to Liyue from Fontaine<ref>{{Ref/VO|Xinyan|About Xinyan: Rock 'N' Roll}}</ref> (though it is unclear whether Fontaine was its place of origin).<!--Thematically, it would make more sense for it to have spread from Natlan to Liyue through Fontaine-->

====Mystery Novels====
Mystery novels, such as "Great Detective Hurlock" and "The Case Files of Miss Orith," are very popular in Fontaine.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Angelique}}</ref>

==Designs, Motifs, and Symbols==
The overall shape of Fontaine Character Cards is a large circle with a darker ridge pattern covering the circle's inner edge. To either side of the circle's center are circles with symbols nestled in the troughs of the ridges, presumably. At the top of each Character Card is the character's Vision showing their [[Arkhe]] attribute: either Pneuma or Ousia.

In clockwise order:

* Top right appears to be two back-to-back [[Melusine]] with fish tails. It is the emblem of the [[Garde]]s.
* Center right is an anchor being wrapped by a vine with two roses and thorns, the emblem of [[Spina di Rosula]].
* Bottom right is an emblem representing the [[Pneumousia]] gears of [[Clockwork Meka]], possibly representing the [[Fontaine Research Institute]].
* Bottom left is the emblem of [[The Steambird]], depicting their mascot [[Sir Arthur]], a clockwork bird wearing a top hat, within a gear.
* Center left is a three-headed wolf-shaped emblem, the emblem of the [[Fortress of Meropide]].
* Top left are stylized scales, the insignia of [[Furina]], the former Hydro Archon before her abdication following the events of [[Masquerade of the Guilty]].

==Economy==
[[The Steambird]] is a newspaper that hails from Fontaine. They have readers and writers all over [[Teyvat]]. Currently, there are two known columns affiliated the newspaper; "All Things Astrological," overseen by [[Mona]],<ref>{{Ref/CS|Mona|All Things Astrological}}</ref> and "[[Teyvat Food Notes]]," overseen by [[Traveler|Long Erjun]]. Besides the columnists, [[Charlotte]] is a reporter covering the news.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Commence! A Suspect Genesis}}</ref>

Fontaine also exports their technology to other nations. Due to the intense mechanical nature of Fontaine's products, there appears to be a lack of organic items, which are in high demand.

[[Lumidouce Harbor]] primarily handle's the nation's exports and imports;<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Cassigneul}}</ref> while some ships are present in [[Romaritime Harbor]] and even has an Aquabus line dedicated to it, to the south is the [[Girdle of the Sands]], a vast desert with few travelers and many dangers.

==Fashion==
There seems to be a clear divide in clothing styles between the [[Court of Fontaine Region]], which has more formal and decorated clothing, and the more simple and practical wear of [[Court of Fontaine: Fleuve Cendre|Fleuve Cendre]] and other areas outside of the city.

Most non-uniform clothing — both men's and women's — come in a variety of color schemes. These tend to feature various shades of blue, purple, yellow, green, red, and brown. In some cases, outfit recolors slightly change the pattern of certain aspects of the outfit (see [[Aurele]] vs. [[Cava]] or [[Antila]] vs. [[Eloffe]]).

===Men's Fashion===

</gallery>

Boys' clothing seems to be inspired by the kind popular in Europe between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The first and second versions of adult men's attire, however, are more similar to those from the mid-to-late 19th century, as that was when that style of cravat/bow-tie and waistcoat were most popular. The third version is closest in style to the late 18th to early 19th century, due to the {{w|Jabot (neckwear)|jabot}} and longer coat being hallmarks of the period.

===Women's Fashion===
<!--Would prefer red variation for Women's attire, version 1 because it parallels the pre-4.0 Fontainian male outfit. Red version is seen on [[Jacquetta]] and [[Angelique]]. Would like image without arms crossed.-->

NPC Bracari.png|Elderly women's attire, version 1 ([[Bracari]])
NPC Yvette.png|Elderly women's attire, version 2 ([[Yvette]])
</gallery>

The second and fourth versions of women's attire seem to be inspired by the fashion of the {{w|Belle Époque}}, which is characterized by decorated hats, lace blouses, and straight falling skirts. The first, third, and sixth, in contrast, are less based directly on historical dress and more on modern subcultures that take inspiration from history, such as {{w|Steampunk fashion|steampunk}} and {{w|Lolita fashion|lolita}}.

Additionally, maid outfits in Fontaine ([[Argalia]]) are identical to those in [[Mondstadt]] ([[Hillie]]). This makes Fontaine the only other region where this style of maid outfit is considered standard.

==Festivals and Holidays==
The Iridescence Tour is described as a famous music festival that originates from Fontaine and run by several organizers.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Tricky Situation}}</ref>

The [[Fontinalia Festival]] is a festival to commemorate the [[Lochknight]]s' search for the [[Oceanid]]s and welcoming of [[Egeria]] to Fontaine as its Hydro Archon. The Fontinalia Film Festival, which was added to the festivities, was organized by the Fontaine Film Association to introduce the art of cinematography to the public. People may submit films to be evaluated, and the entry with the highest score will be given the "Furina Award" by the Fontaine Film Association, although nobody changed the award's name following the events of ''[[Masquerade of the Guilty]]''.<ref name="Muskets" />

[[Fontaine Fashion Week]] is also a recurring event. [[Chiori]] implies that it draws large crowds.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Where the Roses Bloom (Quest)}}</ref>

Furina's birthday is a public holiday in Fontaine; although no longer the ruling Hydro Archon, her birthday remains a holiday.<ref>{{Ref/Mail|page=Mail/Merusea Village... (2023-12-18)}}</ref>

==Languages==
In the Inazuma {{Quest|Tatara Tales}}, Xavier states that people in Fontaine use the phrase {{fr|c'est la vie}}, which is French for "That's life." From the precedent set by other regions, it is fair to assume that Fontainians speak and write in a French-inspired language.

==Politics==
<!-- Add stuff about Fleuve Cendre (class stratification, Spina di Rosula) -->
According to [[Yanfei]], Fontaine has a notoriously complex law system in place.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Yanfei|About Us: Relationships}}</ref> This was partially in part due to the Hydro Archon [[Furina]] prior to her abdication, who lived for the [[Opera Epiclese|spectacle of the courtroom]]: seeking to judge the other gods, but knowing not to make an enemy of the [[Celestia|divine]]. Individuals from Fontaine appear to be judged by the court for their responsibilities when performing tasks. According to [[Patrice]], the tiniest infractions are considered crimes that can come with severe punishment, even if it may seem trivial in other nations. For example, it is illegal to eat ketchup on its own, as it must always be served as a condiment,<ref>{{Ref/VO|Neuvillette|Something to Share: Laws}}</ref> and even eating cake meant for the Archon can be punishable with jail time.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Tea Party Most Thorny}}</ref> Poaching is considered a serious crime, punishable by death.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> However, the death sentence was supposedly a myth as it has never been carried on; only one instance of it had occurred since the creation of the Oratrice, where it was used against the throne of the Hydro Archon.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Apocalypse}}</ref>

The [[Maison Gestion]] handles administrative work, such as archiving cases and processing papers. Many of their workers are generally overworked to the point that they are prone to fainting from exhaustion.

Before a trial begins, the accused are given the option to face a [[Champion Duelist]] instead to maintain their honor. However, the Champion Duelists are some of the strongest fighters in the nation, and thus it is very rare for one to prevail over them. The duel lasts until the accused gives up, though as many tend to maintain their honor to the very end; this option is usually the equivalent to the death sentence. The court is maintained by [[Neuvillette]], who originally used the [[Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale]] to assist him in his judgement, though he no longer does so following its deactivation.

The [[Fortress of Meropide]] is where the sentenced are held after a trial, and while it has a notorious reputation among the law-abiding, the prison itself is actually an independent entity outside of the Court of Fontaine's jurisdiction with its own rules and regulations, with [[Wriothesley]] serving as its administrator.

The God of Justice is not the one of the original [[The Seven|Seven]]. The [[Egeria|previous Hydro Archon]], now deceased, sent the Oceanids across Teyvat to spy on the people to connect them to the world. After her passing, the Oceanids refused to acknowledge the God of Justice as the Hydro Archon and continue on with their former master's request.

Following the death of [[Focalors]], the throne of the Hydro Archon, and the disabling of the Oratrice, all related duties to the position are now handled by Neuvillette, the Hydro Dragon Sovereign.

===Military===
Around the time of the [[cataclysm]], the [[Narzissenkreuz Institute]] seems to have taken part in protecting the people of Fontaine and/or the whole of Teyvat, with its Director and Vice Director dying while joining the fight to stop the cataclysm.<ref name="OF">{{Ref/Arti|Odyssean Flower}}</ref> After their deaths, some of the surviving members decided to "protect the realm" by joining the [[Marechaussee Phantom]] or the [[Special Security and Surveillance Patrol]].<ref name="OF" />

Apart from the Gardes&mdash;human law enforcement officials&mdash;the Clockwork Meka also serve as the primary force to minimize human casualties, known as [[Gardemek]]s. Clockwork Meka can also be bought by the rich and/or influential, though many others have fallen into the hands of criminals and others violently malfunctioning.

During the [[cataclysm]], Fontaine also had an active navy known as the Fontaine Armada that also protected the nation; it is not known if a navy exists in the present day. The Fontaine Armada was pursuing [[Elynas (NPC)|Elynas]], a great beast that had appeared during this time and caused severe pollution to the land and sea. The armada was tasked with stopping Elynas, following its path while attracting many abyssal sea creatures along the way, which sank several ships. By the time they reached Elynas, what was left of the fleet was likely destroyed. It is mentioned that a fleet still exists, though it has yet to appear in-game.<ref>[[Wish-Fulfilling Treasure Hunt]]</ref>
