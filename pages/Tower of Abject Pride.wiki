|description  = It is said that the [[Great Red Sand|deserts]] were once home to three sage-kings, [[Hermanubis|one of whom]] remained lovely and wise till the very end. They parted ways eventually for the sake of the paradise they sought in their hearts. This place is called a "tower," but in truth was the temporary residence of one of these people when they were building that earthly paradise. If one stretches the past back even further, it was once a small shrine built to avoid the wind and the sand.
