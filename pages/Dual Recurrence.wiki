{{Description|The path of redemption is set for [[Collei]]. As she is about to start a new life, a mysterious [[Barnabas|foe]] from her past appears before her.}}
'''Dual Recurrence''' is Chapter 13 of the ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' [[manga]].

==Summary==
The next morning, Barnabas of the [[Fatui]], visits the [[Knights of Favonius]] and interrogates [[Kaeya]] on the black fire incident and the search of the culprit. With his arrogant smile, the knight simply assures him that the organization is doing everything they can to complete the task. 

Afterwards. Kaeya leads a team to search for the culprit until they suddenly notice a figure of black fire and chase him. Arriving in the woods, they encounter the [[Diluc|Darknight Hero]], who is wielding a [[Delusion#Crepus' Delusion|Delusion]]. He attacks the knights as Kaeya creates walls of ice to shield his allies before disappearing.

At [[Starsnatch Cliff]], [[Cyno]] helps perform a ritual to seal away Collei's Archon Residue. The process is a success as Cyno leaves. [[Amber]] and Collei celebrate until Barnabas appears.

==Trivia==
* During the meeting Barnabas had with Kaeya, he is shown without the Fatui emblem on his left hand in the English version of the manga. However, he is shown with the Fatui emblem on his left hand in the Simplified Chinese version of the manga.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|13|pg=6|zh=1}}</ref>
* The translation of Cyno's ritual from [[Latin-Based Language|Abyss Language]] is "YHVH, ADNI, AHIH, AGLA, ABOVE MY HEAD, THE PRESENCE OF GOD."<ref>{{Ref/Manga|13|pg=13}}</ref>
** The first line "YHVH, ADNI, AHIH, AGLA" are all references to the Hebrew god used in the formulation of the pentagrams in the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_ritual_of_the_pentagram#Procedure Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram].
