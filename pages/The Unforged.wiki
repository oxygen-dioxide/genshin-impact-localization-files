==Gameplay Notes==
* Any [[Normal Attack]], [[Charged Attack]], [[Plunging Attack]], [[Elemental Skill]] and [[Elemental Burst]] can be used to trigger the on-hit effect, even if no damage is dealt.
* Only one stack is gained even if multiple enemies are hit at once.
* Gaining a stack will refresh the duration of all existing stacks. In other words, the effect persists for 8 seconds after the last hit, regardless of the number of stacks.
* Stacks cannot be gained if the character equipped with this weapon is not on the field.
* If the character equipped with this weapon is switched out of the field, any existing stacks will last for its usual 8 seconds.

==Description==
A long time ago, a [[Azhdaha|dragon]] there was to be found in Liyue.<br />
Not a dragon that soared the skies, but one whose abode was the mountains.<br />
Indeed, this ancient dragon of stone was as large as the very mountains it called home.

The legends say that it slumbered in [[Nantianmen]], seeming not at all unlike the surrounding hills.<br />
But when it awakened, even the tiniest movement, or the slightest stretch...<br />
That would cause the earth to tremble and shake.<br />
Then, [[Rex Lapis]] came before the dragon, seeking to stop the earth's quailing.

They say that for a long while, the land knew peace,<br />
And that Rex Lapis gained another comrade by his side.

But in the end, the union of dragons, gods and men was perhaps not to be...

The dragon was sealed in the bowels of the earth. Fearing the ire of the [[god]]s and the [[adepti]],<br />
The [[Geovishaps]], who once heeded the trembling of the rock and wrought havoc alongside the dragon,<br />
Fled into the roots of the mountains. But as millennia passed, the dragon began to stir once again...

The legends hold that those who triumphed over the dragon stabbed this sword into the ground next to the [[Dragon-Queller|giant tree]] that subdued the ancient dragon.<br />
As one of the seals, monsters and malevolent mortals would be unable to touch it.<br />
Indeed, if the legends are true, only those with hearts as pure as clear mirrors could even come near it.<br />
Yet, if those legends are true, how did this sword come to be lost?

==Trivia==
*The dragon discussed in this weapon's lore refers to [[Azhdaha]].
===Etymology===
*Its description {{Lang|"edgeless"|zh=无锋|zh_rm=wú fēng}} and its Chinese name {{Lang|"Sword of No Skill"|zh=无工之剑|zh_rm=Wúgōng zhī Jiàn}} likely refer to the Chinese idiom {{Lang|"heavy sword is edgeless, great technique is to be skilled in nothing"|zh=重剑无锋，大巧不工|zh_rm=zhòngjiàn wúfēng, dàqiǎo bùgōng}}.
**It means that one should not rely on extravagant tools and showy skills, and instead they should focus on cultivating a simple and natural state of power and mind. The idiom originates from the Chinese {{w|wuxia}} novel ''{{w|The Return of the Condor Heroes}}'' written by {{w|Jin Yong}} in 1959, but the idea itself ultimately comes from the Taoist philosophy (''{{w|wu wei}}'' or "no action") in ancient China, notably ''{{w|Tao Te Ching}}'' by {{w|Laozi}}.<ref>Baidu Encylopedia: [https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E9%87%8D%E5%89%91%E6%97%A0%E9%94%8B%EF%BC%8C%E5%A4%A7%E5%B7%A7%E4%B8%8D%E5%B7%A5/16167204 {{Zh|重剑无锋，大巧不工}}]</ref>
**In Jin Yong's novels, it was a sword wielded by {{w|Dugu Qiubai}} (the strongest character in the series) in his 30s. Later he mastered a technique that allowed him to use anything as his sword (including grass, trees, bamboos, and rocks), and finally he reached a godly state that he was able to perform his sword arts with no physical swords. Considering Morax is the very greatest warrior of Liyue, by analogy, the line "Yet, if those legends are true, how did this sword come to be lost?" may indicate that he later mastered power to seal Azhdaha without this sword.
**[[Dugu Shuo]], a boy in [[Liyue Harbor]], may be related to this reference, as he has the same surname as Dugu Qiubai and is obsessed with powerful swords.
*The same Taoist theme is found in the lore of the bow [[Rust]], where a famed archer realized that the ultimate shot is no shot.
