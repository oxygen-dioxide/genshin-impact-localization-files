|text    = So, some bearded merchant from Shumeru or [[Sumeru]] or whatever asked [[Shinobu]] for a bit of a legal help, and whaddya know, in the end they ended up sending a ton of their local specialties! Check it out! there are even some golden [[Onikabuto]]! Awesome, huh? I've raised them to be huge and poweful, and now, during this annual celebration of the birth of the one and only King Arataki, I'm giving 'em all to you! How stoked are you?

Oh, but that's not all! There's [[Seagrass]] from [[Shimura's]], and [[Naku Weed]] from [[Tsukumomono Groceries]] too. I brought the gang down and worked for them for three whole days to score this haul. But hey, no biggie, what I earned, I'm giving to you! No reason, really, I just want my compadre on this crazy ride called life to be just like me on this special day &mdash; the world's happiest Oni! Er, no, human!
