The '''Login Menu''' is the menu that appears after launching the game and after the {{w|photosensitive epilepsy}} warning and [[HoYoverse]] logos.

The actions the player can do in the Login Menu include log into or switch their [[account]], switch regions (servers), change some basic [[#Settings|settings]], verify the files of their installation, access [[notices]] (with limited announcements), initiate [[preinstallation]] (mobile only), and exit the game.

Within the game, players can return to the login screen via the [[Paimon Menu]] by selecting the "Quit Game" option. The background of the menu changes depending on the system time of the player's device, the visuals representing four times of the day: dawn, day, dusk, and night. The music also changes to reflect this.

==Trivia==
* The area shown in the login menu features notable [[Celestia]] motifs and themes in its design.
** It resembles the place shown in ''Genshin Impact'''s opening [https://youtu.be/B8197NUQ0LE cutscene] where the Traveler and their sibling encounter the [[Unknown God]], who is assumed to be associated with Celestia.
** The design of the pillars is similar to Dragonspine's [[Skyfrost Nail]], the [[Statues of The Seven]], and parts of [[Paimon]]'s clothing.
** The door is similar to the entrance of Celestia shown in the official ''Genshin Impact'' [[manga]], page 72 of the Prologue.
