'''Benben''' is a quest-exclusive NPC that appears in the [[Golden Slumber]] World Quest series.

==Profile==
While finding a way out of a pitfall, the [[Traveler]], [[Paimon]], [[Jeht]], [[Jebrael]] and [[Tirzad]] discovered the unusual construct. It did not attack or flee from them, instead befriended Jeht and accompanied them through the course of their journey to discover [[Khaj-Nisut]].

Benben accompanied Jeht to the [[Tanit Camps]], upon which it had lost significant power and was in a dormant state to conserve energy. [[Aderfi]] negotiated with the [[Fatui]] to acquire some [[Energy Transformation Capacitor]]s, but he had fled the tribe upon being discovered as a traitor. The Traveler instead found the Fatui camp carrying them and seized it, giving it to Benben, who returned to its normal state. 

After Jeht and the Traveler destroyed the Tanit for attempting to kill them, Benben emerged from Jeht's tent to quickly catch up with her, walking down their own path.

===Personality===
Tirzad surmises that Benben is a special type of [[Primal Construct]], as it is incapable of attacking and can understand human speech. Benben appears to be friendly, as it quickly befriended Jeht and agreed to leave the ruins to travel with her.

===Appearance===
Benben's model is the "generic" core seen on Primal Constructs, without the additional triangular frame or combat accessories surrounding them.

==Trivia==
* In Ancient Egyptian creation myths, {{w|Benben}} was a pyramid-shaped mound which was the first thing to emerge out of {{w|Nu (mythology)|Nu}}, a term that referred both to the primordial waters of creation and the deity that personified it. Ancient Egyptians conceptualized the mortal plane of life as a bubble or sphere surrounded by the primordial oceanic-abyss Nu.<ref>Daniel R. McBride, 2003, ''The Oxford Essential Guide to Egyptian Mythology'', Berkley, [[Special:Booksources/0-425-19096-X|ISBN 0-425-19096-X]]</ref>
* In architecture, the uppermost piece or capstone of an Egyptian pyramid or obelisk might be referred to as a "pyramidion" or "benben stone" (the latter referencing the pyramid-shaped primordial mound of Ancient Egyptian mythology). In Ancient Egyptian language, pyramidia were called "benbenet."<ref>Ermann, Grapow, ''Wörterbuch der ägyptischen Sprache'' 1, 459.13-14</ref>
