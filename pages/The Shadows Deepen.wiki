:{{A|vo eqxs103 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The time has come! Let's go meet Albedo at the camp!

;(Approach the campsite)
:{{A|vo eqxs103 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Albedo, we're here!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 1 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Traveler, Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} How is your investigation going?
:{{A|vo eqxs103 1 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' ...Your faces say that, perhaps, you haven't turned up anything?
:{{A|vo eqxs103 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We investigated all over the mountain, actually. But we didn't see anyone that looked like you, or hear of anyone else meeting you...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 1 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' This is not unexpected. I haven't made much progress, either. He appears to know that we are looking for him, and has opted to lie low for the time being.
:'''(Traveler):''' (Or maybe he has always operated discreetly.)
:{{A|vo eqxs103 1 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Still, there is one thing I found. I discovered footprints on some parts of the mountain, and although they were a little covered by the snow, I could tell they had been left by someone of a similar size to myself.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 1 albedo 05.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' The footprints were quite numerous, so I believe my next step will be to rule out each of the adventurers active on Dragonspine one by one...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We can help with that. We have plenty of contact with the adventurers.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So now we...
;(Some noise occurs in the background)
:{{A|vo eqxs103 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aaaah! What was that!?
:{{A|vo eqxs103 1 albedo 06.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' It came from that direction.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Could it be the impostor?
:{{DIcon}} Let's go check it out.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yes, let's hurry!
----
;(Approach the source of the voice)
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Rocks? Ah! And what are these boars also doing here!?

;(Approach the rock pile)
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, did you see that? Did those rocks shake just now?
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Phew. That was most unfortunate.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What are you guys doing here!?
:{{DIcon}} I'd assume it was some sort of bad luck.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' I have to agree. We've been wandering this area for days...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 bennett 01.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' We ran into Pallad earlier. You know, the, uh... kind of a reckless sort of guy? You know the one? Anyway, he said he was unlucky, so I gave him some adventuring survival tips...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' After that, he disappeared to rejoin the training camp.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, wait, wait... are you saying that after all this time, you still haven't made it back to the base camp?
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Haha... Well, as you can see...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 bennett 02.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' It was nothing, really. We just hit a few landslides and snowdrifts, and took a few downhill tumbles, you know the deal.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' They sound like unforgettable life events to me.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Anyway... You're correct, we haven't made it to the base camp yet. We have had extraordinarily poor luck over the last few days, almost as if a sinister force has been trying to thwart our every move.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 eula 07.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Fortunately, I made advance arrangements for Gerald to remain in a safe location and conduct some basic physical training exercises.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 bennett 03.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' I'm sorry... I'm the one to blame for all this. I've always had bad luck and it always rubs off on everyone around me...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 bennett 04.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Sorry to create so much extra trouble for everyone... *sigh*.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 bennett 05.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' I don't know what to say... Maybe this is the awesome power of fate &mdash; the scary kind, I mean.
:{{DIcon}} Don't say that.
:{{DIcon}} It has nothing to do with fate.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I agree.
:{{DIcon}} I am not scared to be around you.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, we're just used to it now! Besides, it's not like we have the most amazing luck ourselves...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 bennett 06.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Really? I think you guys have way better luck than I do!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well... what can we do about that? Oh, Paimon knows, how about Paimon shares some of her luck with you!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' You're welcome to a bit of mine, too! Although, if the last few days are anything to go by, it seems in pretty short supply at the moment...
:{{DIcon}} Take some of mine, too.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 bennett 07.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' ...You guys...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 bennett 08.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Aww... Thanks. With a little luck from everyone combined, we'll make it down this mountain for sure!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 ambor 04.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Yeah, you bet!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 bennett 09.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Let me flip a Treasure Hoarder Insignia to test it out... Alright! It's tails, the opposite of what I guessed!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you can predict your fortune this way? But why are you so happy that you got it wrong?
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 bennett 10.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' It has two sides, so there is a 50-50 chance of me getting it correct.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 bennett 11.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Luck all comes down to probability, too. So as long as I use up all the bad luck, everything else will go smoothly!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 bennett 12.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Guessing wrong when I flip an insignia is one way to use up some of the bad luck. So the probability of having some good luck in the near future just got a little higher.
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, he's making no sense at all... why aren't you calling him out!?
:{{DIcon}} Come on, he isn't you.
:{{DIcon}} I'm actually polite to most people.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 bennett 13.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Guys, I guessed wrong in my insignia flip, which means we should be able to make it back to camp!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's not sure that's how it works.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 bennett 14.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Lemme try. It's this way, right?
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 bennett 15.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Whoa!!! Ouch... Ow, my butt!... What is this shard of ice doing here!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' How truly miraculous... This is a miracle of misfortune.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I don't usually believe in luck, but Bennett makes the best case for it I've ever seen.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Amber, if you are ever required to partner with Bennett in your future work and you encounter anything like this again, do not take any rash action. Wait for me and I will come to support you.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 ambor 05.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Huh? Y&mdash;Yes, of course...
:{{DIcon}} Everyone must be exhausted...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 ambor 06.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Now that you mention it, I do feel a little tired... Trekking in the mountains has a way of wearing you out.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Since everyone is tired, why not take a rest in my camp?
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's so sleepy... A nice bowl of hot soup and a good sleep would sure be welcome right now...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 ambor 07.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Yawn... Suddenly I'm kinda sleepy, too...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 2 eula 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Amber will fall asleep in the snow if we keep going much longer... Come on, let's move! We shall head to Albedo's camp and get some rest, take stock of our supplies, and decide how to get off this mountain.
----
;(Return to Albedo's camp)
:{{A|vo eqxs103 3 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Here we are. Make yourselves comfortable.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 3 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Oh... I forgot, I don't have that many chairs. Please wait a moment.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What's he doing? Painting?
:{{A|vo eqxs103 3 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' He is!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 3 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' He is painting a chair... Wait, alchemy can turn paintings into objects!? How is this possible?
:{{A|vo eqxs103 3 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' My paintings are like blueprints &mdash; alchemy simply enables me to omit the manufacturing part of the process. It's an elementary-level technique.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 3 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' With enough research and experimentation, this same technique can even be used to create living beings.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 3 bennett 01.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Whoa... Well, since you can magically produce chairs, can I have one with a backrest?
:{{DIcon}} I'll have a stool.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 3 albedo 05.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' No problem. How many of you want backrests?
:{{A|vo eqxs103 3 bennett 02.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Me!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 3 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Me! Me!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 3 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' ...I'll also take one with a backrest, if you please.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Can Paimon have a chair that comes with a juicer?
:{{DIcon}} A whole chair is way too big for you, surely?
:{{A|vo eqxs103 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Still beats squeezing onto a stool with you! Hmph!

:'''In a moment, Albedo quickly creates five chairs for everyone to use...'''

:{{A|vo eqxs103 3 bennett 03.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Cool, we have chairs now! Haha, this is so comfortable! Makes me want to stay the night here!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 3 albedo 06.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' You're very welcome to stay overnight, if you wish.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 3 albedo 07.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' There's still some time before dinner. Get some rest, everyone. I'll tend the stove.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 3 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Hey now, we can't be letting you do all the work! I can help, please, put me to work!

;(Talk to Albedo)
:{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Pace yourself, dinner could be a while... I still have a few things to prepare.
:;(Talk to Albedo between 18<nowiki>:</nowiki>00 and 06<nowiki>:</nowiki>00 the next day)
::{{DIcon|Quest}} When will dinner be?
:::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 albedo 02e.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' It's almost ready now. Traveler, please light the campfire and gather everyone for dinner.
::;(Continue to next section)
:{{DIcon}} About the paint...
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 albedo 02a 1.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I hadn't expected you to be so interested in paint.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 albedo 02a 2.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I once tried grinding Mist Flowers into powder and mixing it with white paint to replicate the sparkle of snowflakes.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 albedo 02a 3.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' The end result was quite satisfactory. But works that use this kind of paint need to be stored carefully.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 albedo 02a 4.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' If you want to try it for yourself, I can help you.
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About Dragonspine...
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 albedo 02b 1.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Even now, I don't believe I have fully grasped the nature of the threat that Dragonspine poses.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 albedo 02b 2.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' But I will endeavor to keep you safe. That much you can trust in.
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} How are you holding up?
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 albedo 02c 1.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Hah. I wish I could simply respond with, "I'm fine."
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 albedo 02c 2.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' But you are a true friend to me, so I should be honest with you.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 albedo 02c 3.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Recently, certain questions have been occupying my mind... questions about the nature of life, and creation.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 albedo 02c 4.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' However, I feel that rushing into a discussion with you on these topics before my ideas on them are fully formulated will bring you far more confusion than clarity.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 albedo 02c 5.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' So I will wait till my thoughts are clear in my own head before I share them with you. Until then, please forgive me.
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About what happened today...
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 albedo 02d 1.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Don't worry about it. A chance like this to gather around the fire and chat into the night is a rare and precious one for me.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 albedo 02d 2.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I won't participate in the conversation much. It's just a habit of mine.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 albedo 02d 3.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' But please know that I am enjoying the atmosphere all the same.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 albedo 02d 4.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Of course, I'm happy to continue chatting with you if you'd like.
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you in peace.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' This is my camp, but let's not get bogged down in technicalities. I want you to be able to relax and make yourself at home here.

;(Talk to Bennett)
:{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 bennett 01.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' I wonder if there's anything I can do to help out... ?
:{{DIcon}} About the rookie...
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 bennett 02a 1.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Oh, you mean Gerald? I heard that Eula developed a whole training program for him.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 bennett 02a 2.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' He might be new, but I bet he'll improve pretty quickly with a mentor like that.
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About Dragonspine...
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 bennett 02b 1.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' *sigh* I feel bad, it's hard knowing that I've been causing so much trouble for everyone.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 bennett 02b 2.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Being a little unlucky is usually no big deal for me. But in a place like this, it makes me worry that something really bad might come of it...
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 bennett 02b 3.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' No, wait, I shouldn't have said that. I might have actually jinxed it now.
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} How are you holding up?
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 bennett 02c 1.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Haha, you know me, same old Bennett... unlucky as ever.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 bennett 02c 2.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' But as long as bad luck doesn't break me, I'll always get back up again.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 bennett 02c 3.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Especially on a cool adventure like this one. I gotta make the most of it!
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About what happened today...
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 bennett 02d 1.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Hehe, sorry for dragging you guys into another situation.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 bennett 02d 2.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' I didn't use to know any of these knights very well, but after spending some time with them on this trip, it's really opened my eyes to my own shortcomings.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 bennett 02d 3.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' They're all so talented and kind. I have a lot to learn from them.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 bennett 02d 4.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Oh yeah &mdash; you gotta tell me sometime how you managed to make friends with so many talented people!
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you in peace.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 bennett 03.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Okay, cool. Make sure you eat plenty when dinner's ready.

;(Talk to Amber)
:{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' It's so nice and warm here...
:{{DIcon}} About Joel...
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 ambor 02a 1.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Joel's been doing pretty good. Having people to play with has put him in a good mood.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 ambor 02a 2.ogg}} '''Amber:''' I'll tell you what though, he seems to have even more stamina than me!
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 ambor 02a 3.ogg}} '''Amber:''' So long as they're playing, kids always seem to have endless amounts of energy.
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About Dragonspine...
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 ambor 02b 1.ogg}} '''Amber:''' It's more dangerous up here than I thought.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 ambor 02b 2.ogg}} '''Amber:''' In a hostile environment like this, even a knight of Favonius has to keep their eyes open and keep their wits about them at all times.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 ambor 02b 3.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Still, this has been a pretty unique adventure for me. It's definitely been worth it.
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} How are you holding up?
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 ambor 02c 1.ogg}} '''Amber:''' You know, when I was keeping Joel company, I started missing my grandfather really bad...
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 ambor 02c 2.ogg}} '''Amber:''' After he disappeared, I never saw him again. I have no idea how he's doing.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 ambor 02c 3.ogg}} '''Amber:''' But at least what I can do is focus on being a great Outrider! If I can do that well, I know he'd be proud.
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About what happened today...
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 ambor 02d 1.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Oh, all that? Ah, don't worry about it.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 ambor 02d 2.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Eula is a good person. She might not show it, but she'd never let that kind of stuff get to her.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 ambor 02d 3.ogg}} '''Amber:''' As for Bennett, he seems like the kind of guy who can keep his spirits up when things aren't going well.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 ambor 02d 4.ogg}} '''Amber:''' I feel bad for having to ask so much of Albedo, though...
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 ambor 02d 5.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Still, it's kinda nice to have everyone together like this, so... yay for silver linings.

:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you in peace.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Sure thing. Bet you're tired as well? You should get some rest, too.

;(Talk to Eula)
:{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' This is quite cozy... for Dragonspine, I'm pleasantly surprised.
:{{DIcon}} About the snowman...
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 eula 02a 1.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I gave it a try, and I actually quite enjoyed it.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 eula 02a 2.ogg}} '''Eula:''' ...
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 eula 02a 3.ogg}} '''Eula:''' But Amber said the snowman I made was too artistic... apparently, the conventional style is more rotund in appearance.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 eula 02a 4.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I couldn't tell if she was complimenting me or mocking me. Either way, I'm not about to let it go.

:{{DIcon}} About Dragonspine...
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 eula 02b 1.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I'm quite familiar with Dragonspine by now.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 eula 02b 2.ogg}} '''Eula:''' But this time, I have a newcomer to worry about, and I am traveling in a group with Amber and the others. Not things I'm terribly well accustomed to.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 eula 02b 3.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Still, I've taken the job, so of course I'll do what's asked of me to the fullest of my ability. I'll settle this score once this is all over.
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} How are you holding up?
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 eula 02c 1.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Me? I'm coping perfectly well. I don't need looking after.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 eula 02c 2.ogg}} '''Eula:''' You should talk to Amber and Bennett. They're not as well acquainted with Dragonspine as I am.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 eula 02c 3.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Seeing how much you can find to talk about even with Albedo, you must be quite the conversationalist. So put that skill to good use &mdash; teach them all how to survive on Dragonspine. I'm sure this is well within your capability, no?
:;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About what happened today...
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 eula 02d 1.ogg}} '''Eula:''' If you're talking about Bennett's situation, I think I'm used to it now. It's hardly the end of the world.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 eula 02d 2.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Don't ruminate on it. Take this chance to get some proper rest. The nights are long on Dragonspine.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 eula 02d 3.ogg}} '''Eula:''' ...
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 eula 02d 4.ogg}} '''Eula:''' *sigh* A glass of ice-cold wine would not go amiss right now.

:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yay, dinner's ready!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Food's ready, everyone! Come on, let's eat!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I made a few dishes based on some popular Mondstadt recipes. This is no Good Hunter, but there should be enough to go around.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Please, help yourselves.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 bennett 01.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Wow, smells great! Don't mind if I do!

:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah... Paimon's full. What a great meal!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 bennett 02.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Albedo, you're too modest. These dishes are as good as anything you'd find in a top restaurant. Are all alchemists so good at cooking?
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' You may be onto something there.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right? Paimon thinks so, too! It's his lab manner that gives it away &mdash; the kind of guy who holds a potion bottle as steady as a rock isn't the kind of guy who's gonna be slapdash with his salt and pepper.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Actually, that makes a lot of sense!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 bennett 03.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' I'm so sleepy after all that food... zzz...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Did Bennett fall asleep sitting up? He must be totally wiped out.
:{{DIcon}} It's been a tough few days.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' The way he's sleeping is so... alert. I'm impressed.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 bennett 04.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Zzz... zzz...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He seems to be in a deep sleep. Paimon wonders if he sleep talks?
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 bennett 05.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Ugh... Ugh, no dad, no apples for me... I want Sticky Honey Roast and Fisherman's Toast...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Sticky Honey Roast... That's your favorite, isn't it, Amber?
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Hmm, sure is! Give me a Sticky Honey Roast from Good Hunter any day!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 ambor 04.ogg}} '''Amber:''' I used to take Eula to Good Hunter a lot back when we first met. Before long, Sara would start cooking our usual orders as soon as she saw us coming.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 ambor 05.ogg}} '''Amber:''' She said we ordered the same things so often that it was practically muscle memory by that point! Haha.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 ambor 06.ogg}} '''Amber:''' She also said that if everyone in Mondstadt ordered like we do, her job would be so much easier. All she'd have to do is to memorize everyone's favorites...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Ahem!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Always eating together... Aw, it's nice that you two are so close.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Traveler) and Paimon always eat together, too. It's a sure sign of true friendship!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 eula 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Two people simply sharing a meal says nothing either way about the relationship between them.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' That depends if it's a one-off meal or a regular occurrence.
:{{DIcon}} He's not wrong.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aha! Paimon just noticed something! Whenever Eula doesn't want to admit to something, she raises her chin or puts her hands on her hips.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 eula 07.ogg}} '''Eula:''' ...Hmph.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 ambor 07.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Ah, you've all picked up on that. Didn't know Eula's tells were so easy to spot.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 eula 08.ogg}} '''Eula:''' We are done here, yes? I am free to go, am I not?
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 eula 09.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Please excuse me. I have a frozen lake I need to be at.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 ambor 08.ogg}} '''Amber:''' You're going for an ice bath at this time of the night? W&mdash;Wait up, don't go without me!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 eula 10.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I thought you wanted to get some sleep? So maybe you should stay here and rest.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 ambor 09.ogg}} '''Amber:''' No, I should come with you. It's late, and it's dark, and you're not good with directions like I am. Come on, let's go together.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' An ice bath...? Whew, rather them than Paimon.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 bennett 06.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Zzz... so much... roast meat... zzz...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 bennett 07.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Oh... hey dad... I'm doing alright... I'm the leader of my own adventure team now... Zzz...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, Bennett really is a sleep talker.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, looks like we got some downtime now!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Alright you two, time to paint.
:{{DIcon}} Prepare to be amazed.
:{{DIcon}} Time for me to show what I can do.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 albedo 05.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Have you decided what to paint?
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Heh, like you even need to ask! It's obviously going to be Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} ...Okay. Paimon it is.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 albedo 06.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Sure. But we should move elsewhere. We're likely to disturb Bennett's sleep if we stay here, so let's go outside.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 9 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okie-dokie! Alright, grab your easel, paper, brushes, and paints, don't leave anything behind!

;(Talk to sleeping Bennett)
:{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 bennett 04.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Zzz... zzz...
:{{DIcon}} Observe Bennett.
:: '''Observe Bennett.:''' Bennett is sleeping soundly with his eyes tightly shut...
:{{DIcon}} Listen to Bennett's sleep talking.
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 bennett 05b 1.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Huh... Hey! Paimon, no, don't touch that!
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 paimon 01b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...What the heck?
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 bennett 05b 2.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Don't touch that mechanism! Or you'll... fall down... ugh, oh well, never mind...
::{{DIcon}} ...
::{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 paimon 01b 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahhhh! What the heck is this guy dreaming about!
----
;(Approach the painting spot)
:{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Let's paint here.
:{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Allow Paimon to adopt an elegant pose for your artistic reference!
:{{DIcon}} Huh?
:{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! What's that look for? Cut the attitude and start putting your perfect Paimon down on the page! You'd better take this seriously, 'cause this is going on Paimon's wall!
:{{DIcon}} Alright then.
:{{DIcon}} I'll humor Paimon.
:{{A|vo dialog eqxs103 albedo 05.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Confidence is a good thing. Those to whom it is endowed do well to flaunt it. I'm looking forward to the finished piece.

;(Start painting)
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright. Let's start with the head! Now, (Traveler), in your mind's eye, what is written on Paimon's face?
:{{DIcon}} "Paimon's all out of brain juice"...
:{{DIcon}} "Paimon's peeved"...
:{{DIcon}} Dopey but adorable...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Is that how Paimon really looks to you? Huh...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay forget it, we can come back to that. Let's move onto the body! C'mon! Paint what you see when you look at Paimon!
:{{DIcon}} Top-quality emergency food...
:{{DIcon}} A top-tier flying pet...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh... Paimon's starting to feel like this is not going to turn out so great... Now Paimon's getting nervous...
:{{DIcon}} Done.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lemme see, let Paimon see...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aah! What is this!?
:{{DIcon}} Not bad, right? I'm pretty happy with it.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why, you... how could... Huh. Paimon is lost for words! The brushwork is smooth and the composition seems professional-quality &mdash; you had no problems there, so what the heck happened with the face, huh!? Explain that stupid expression! Explain it!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' ...Smooth... Professional-quality...?
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And those eyes! Those boring, lifeless eyes! Where is the soul!!!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Traveler, have you previously received any education in the fine arts?
:{{DIcon}} ...Very, very little...
::{{A|vo eqxs103 11 paimon 09a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, really? So it's just a hobby then? Well that sure explains a lot! There's no way you would have made Paimon look like this if you'd had any amount of formal training.
::{{DIcon}} I was just trying to convey how special you are.
:{{DIcon}} No, but... art comes from the heart, so...
::{{A|vo eqxs103 11 paimon 09b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? You pour your heart on the page, and THIS is what comes out!?
::{{DIcon}} I just wanted to convey how special you are.
::{{A|vo eqxs103 11 paimon 09b 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Special"? Huh... You seriously think "special" is supposed to look this ugly? Paimon's not convinced... but Paimon is struggling to come up with a {{sic|come back}}.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Fascinating.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Paimon, if this is not to your liking, I can make a few amendments. Traveler, what do you think?
:{{DIcon}} Please. And thank you.

:'''Albedo makes some improvements to the artwork...'''

:'''Albedo:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 albedo 05.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Alright then.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 albedo 06.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Paimon, is this better?
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's... It's...
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's a total ground-up overhaul, that's what it is! It's soooo pretty... is that really what Paimon looks like...?
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 albedo 07.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Adding flourish to the finished piece is an essential component of what makes art, art.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 albedo 08.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' This is not to say that you differ from the painting on a fundamental level. Rather, that the real you and the you in the painting present two different styles of beauty.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 albedo 09.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' You remain the core reference point for the painting. So, Paimon, you can put your misgivings aside and hang this painting wherever you like.
:{{DIcon}} Now I see the gap in our painting talents.
:{{DIcon}} This was my trial by fire as an artist.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow... Thanks, Albedo!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 albedo 10.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I merely added a flourish here and there. You should be thanking the Traveler.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 albedo 11.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' (In truth, "ground-up overhaul" is more or less an accurate description.)
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The more Paimon looks at it, the more she likes it... Hehe, great! Paimon has a portrait painting!
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's gonna show this off to everyone!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon looks so happy. Thank you.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 albedo 12.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' It's nothing. I can paint you next time, if you'd like. You can hang it in your home as a souvenir.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 albedo 13.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I rarely entertain so many guests at my camp. It's lively &mdash; a little noisy, even. But I don't dislike it.
:{{A|vo eqxs103 11 albedo 14.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Liveliness is a rare thing here on Dragonspine.

:'''Everyone rests at the camp until morning...'''
----
:{{A|vo eqxs104 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's a new day. Let's go meet up with everyone.

;(Examine Paimon's portrait)
:'''You examine the picture...:''' (This artwork is, to the last stroke, one made with extreme aesthetic sense. Paimon looks elegant and dignified, and she wears an enigmatic but romantic smile, her upturned lips displaying a vast brilliance beyond human ken. Very pretty, of course, but this isn't the Paimon you know at all...)

;(Approach the group)
:{{A|vo eqxs104 1 bennett 01.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Hey! Good morning!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 1 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' I slept great last night! How about you guys? All rested up?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 1 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I'm fine, as usual.
:{{DIcon}} I slept pretty well, too.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 1 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' The path down the mountain is easier to follow in the daylight. Let's take this chance to head down to the base camp.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go! If we make good time, maybe we can all get lunch together.

;(A cutscene plays)
::{{A|vo eqxs104 cs bennett 01.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' I flipped another insignia just outside the camp. Wrong again!
::{{A|vo eqxs104 cs ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' So your bad luck is all used up. We'll be down the mountain in no time!
::{{A|vo eqxs104 cs bennett 02.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Yeah! My thoughts exactly, today's the day!
:;(A rock lands at Albedo's feet, Albedo looks up to see a snowslide.)
::{{A|vo eqxs104 cs albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Oh no!
::{{A|vo eqxs104 cs albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Avalanche!
::{{A|vo eqxs104 cs bennett 03.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Look out!
:;(Bennett gestures to Amber to get away, who is then pulled to safety by Eula. Bennett falls off the wooden bridge and Albedo jumps after him.
:;The avalanche covers the bridge, while Amber, Eula, Paimon, and the Traveler retreat.)
;(Cutscene ends)

:{{A|vo eqxs104 2 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Traveler, Paimon! Are you alright? Are you hurt?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, Paimon's fine...
:{{DIcon}} I'm okay. You?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 2 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Phew... That's good... My arm got a little scratched up, but it's nothing serious.
:{{DIcon}} Eula, how about you?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 2 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I'm okay. But I don't see the other two. I'm afraid... the avalanche may have pushed them off the cliff.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' They fell down!? Th&mdash;They'll be okay, though, right...?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 2 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I think they're both robust enough to survive the fall. But if the falling debris knocked them unconscious, and they're lying there in the freezing cold...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 2 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' We have to get down there and rescue them, immediately.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 2 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Okay, let's move!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hang in there, guys...

----
;(Approach the bottom of the cliff)
:{{A|vo eqxs104 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Bennett!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 3 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Bennett, are you okay!? Shout if you can hear me! Bennett!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 3 bennett 01.ogg}} '''???:''' ...Ugh...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 3 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' A voice &mdash; over there!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Bennett, is that you!?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 3 bennett 02.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Guys... I'm over here...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you alright? Are you hurt?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 3 bennett 03.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' I&mdash;I... lemme check...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 3 bennett 04.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Hmm... I'm a little dizzy, but I'm not in any pain... I don't think I'm injured.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 3 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Thank goodness... scared the life out of me.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 3 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' If you're dizzy, sit and rest for a while.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 3 bennett 05.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Ah, it's fine, really. This kind of thing happens all the time, I'll be fine. Thank you.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 3 bennett 06.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Oh, wait, where's Albedo? Isn't he with you guys?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We thought he fell off the cliff with you... He still hasn't shown up...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 3 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' We've found Bennett here, so Albedo can't be far away. Keep searching this area.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 3 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Got it!

;(Break one rock pile)
:{{A|vo eqxs104 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Albedo!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... no response. Are we definitely looking in the right place?

;(Break the other rock pile)
:{{A|vo eqxs104 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He's not here either. Hmm... Let's check in with the others.

;(Approach the group)
:{{A|vo eqxs104 5 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Well? Any sign of him?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 5 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Not a trace.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 5 bennett 01.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Nothing from me, either.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Strange, we didn't have any luck, either... Where could he have gone...?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 5 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' ...Everyone.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! Albedo!? Are... are you okay?
:{{DIcon}} You're not hurt?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 5 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Nothing serious.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 5 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Okay. Everyone accounted for.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 5 bennett 02.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Guys, I&mdash;I think... it's gotta be because of me. The avalanche only happened because I'm here.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 5 bennett 03.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' I guess flipping a Treasure Hoarder Insignia isn't gonna change my luck after all... No wonder no one wants to go adventuring with me. *sigh*
:{{A|vo eqxs104 5 bennett 04.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' I'm so sorry!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 5 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Don't say that. I'm hardly the lucky type myself, so I'm not about to go blaming every little thing that goes wrong on you.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 5 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Exactly! Besides, Dragonspine is a dangerous place. Avalanches literally come with the territory. Bad luck has nothing to do with it, okay?
:{{DIcon}} (...Was that really an accident?)
:{{A|vo eqxs104 5 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Traveler, what's wrong?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Your face looks... *gasp* Oh no! Did you get hit on the head!?
:{{DIcon}} No, I'm fine.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 5 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Everyone, the incident is behind us now. We should keep moving.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 5 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Why do I feel that Dragonspine has become more dangerous than it used to be... I hope it's just my imagination...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 5 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Our top priority now is to get off the mountain and regroup with the adventurers. Whatever further dangers this mountain has to throw at us, we must face them together.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 5 ambor 04.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Agreed. Guys, keep your eyes peeled and watch your step. Careful does it.

;(Approach the base of the mountain)
:{{A|vo eqxs104 6 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Whew! We've been heading in the right direction for a good length of time now &mdash; we must be getting close, I can feel it!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Victory is in sight, hooray!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' As soon as we get to base camp, Paimon wants a bowl of hot soup and some barbecued meat!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 6 bennett 01.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' I hope we can all get there safely. No more incidents, please...
:'''(Traveler):''' (...)
:'''(Traveler):''' (Weird things have been happening this whole trip... Something feels wrong, but what is it...?)
:{{A|vo eqxs104 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, (Traveler), what's on your mind? You seem a little distracted.
:{{DIcon}} Nothing, it's just...
:{{DIcon}} With some things, I don't know where to begin.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Something's up, isn't it? Uhh... are you hungry? Cold? Shall Paimon hug your head to warm you up?
:{{DIcon}} Thanks, but I'm alright, Paimon.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 6 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' I don't think I've spent so much time on Dragonspine before. It sure is cold, but the view is amazing! Isn't it, Eula?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 6 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 6 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Eula?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 6 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Sorry, I wasn't listening. What did you say?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 6 ambor 04.ogg}} '''Amber:''' I was just thinking &mdash; whenever I've met up with you at Dragonspine in the past, we always stick to the same few spots. It's much more vast and beautiful here than I realized.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 6 ambor 05.ogg}} '''Amber:''' If it were a little warmer and a little safer, I bet this place would be bustling with visitors.
:'''(Traveler):''' (Something seemed to grab Eula's attention. Does she sense that something's off, too?)
:{{A|vo eqxs104 6 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I agree... People are put off by the cold and have an aversion to danger. They don't realize that there is much to explore beneath the icy exterior, if you are willing to spend the time and energy.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 6 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Albedo, is this the way down?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 6 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Yes.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 6 bennett 02.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' I think there are several routes in this area, hmm, does the path fork off here? It looks like it does... hmm, but maybe it doesn't... my head's still a little fuzzy from the impact...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 6 ambor 06.ogg}} '''Amber:''' I'm kind of dizzy, too. I keep thinking things are swaying a little... Maybe I'm just hungry?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 6 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Either path will work for us. The smaller trail is less worn and harder to see, but it's also shorter. Since everyone is weary, I suggest we take the shortcut.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 6 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Follow me.
:{{DIcon}} ...

:'''Everyone follows Albedo onward...'''

:{{A|vo eqxs104 7 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Wait.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 7 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Bennett and Amber don't look well. Can we take a break? We can continue once their conditions have improved.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 7 bennett 01.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Ugh... Now that you mention it...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 7 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Huh? I...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 7 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' You hit your head earlier, didn't you?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 7 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Oh, y&mdash;you noticed. Hehe... Are you sure it's worth holding everyone up over a little thing like this?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No problem at all, health and safety always come first!
:{{DIcon}} Take a break, both of you.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 7 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Okay... Sorry for this. Thank you.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 7 bennett 02.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Yeah... thank you.

;(Talk to Bennett and Amber)
:{{A|vo eqxs104 8 bennett 01.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Drinking some water can help with the dizziness! Oh, and uh, lying flat on your back helps too.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 8 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Thank you, Bennett. Seems like you really know your stuff!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 8 bennett 02.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Haha... Well, when life gives you lemons...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 8 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Bennett, weren't you feeling dizzy too? Stop pushing yourselves, both of you. Get some rest, we'll continue when you've gathered your energy.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 8 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Pfft...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 8 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Eula might come off as a little frosty, but she takes caring for her friends super seriously, more than anyone else I know. Every time I see that look on her face, I'm just like... Aah! Stop staring at me!

;(Talk to Eula)
:{{A|vo eqxs104 9 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Traveler, I know what that look means. What's on your mind?
:{{DIcon}} ...I have a bad feeling about this.
:{{DIcon}} It's like something bad's about to happen.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 9 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Maybe seasoned veterans have an instinct for it.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 9 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I sense it too. Something seems to have changed, but I can't confirm for sure... it could be difficult to verify.
:'''(Traveler):''' (What could it be...)
:{{A|vo eqxs104 9 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' It might be... imprudent to speculate out loud. But I believe you know what I am referring to.
:'''(Traveler):''' (...)
:{{A|vo eqxs104 9 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 9 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Traveler, I think...
:'''(Traveler):''' (...!?)
:{{A|vo eqxs104 9 eula 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' You...
:{{DIcon}} Watch out!

;(A cutscene plays)
:;(Albedo charges at Eula and the Traveler with an ice sword. The Traveler fends off the attack and Eula rejoins the fight.
:;Albedo ascends into the sky and fires ice shards at them. Eula blocks with her greatsword, while Amber and Bennett notice the commotion.
:;Eula and the Traveler continues the skirmish. Amber fires a charged arrow which Albedo evades and counterattacks with ice spears from the ground. Bennett rushes in with his Elemental Burst.
:;Albedo attempts to create a Cryo Solar Isotoma and smirks, but gets stabbed through the chest.
:;The Traveler moves into a defensive position. The assailant is revealed to be another Albedo.)
::'''Paimon:''' Albedo!? What's...
::'''Albedo:''' It's not over yet
:;(The stabbed Albedo shows itself to be a Fellflower.)
;(Cutscene ends)

:{{A|vo eqxs104 10 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Brace yourselves. This will be a challenge.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 10 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Stay back. I'm going to cut this weed down to size!

;(Defeat the [[Fellflower]])
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' ...Hmph.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What in the world was that thing!? One moment it was human, the next it was a plant...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Is everyone alright?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' We're fine. But can you please tell us what's going on? I&mdash;I don't understand...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I take it this monster is whom I had the pleasure of meeting last time.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Correct.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' As you might have guessed, this is a mutated whopperflower. An extremely rare kind.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But can whopperflowers turn into humans?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 05.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Not typically. But conditions on Dragonspine are far from typical.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 06.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Perhaps the dragon's blood seeped into the land, then was passed to the monsters via the ley lines, accelerating their rate of mutation.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 bennett 01.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' How could that happen!?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 07.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' This mountain is home to the remains of Durin, the venomous dragon. If there is anywhere in the world one might expect life to do unfathomable things, it would most likely be here.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 08.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Durin was an artificially created life form. Its existence is nothing short of a miracle, and proof of countless possibilities.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 09.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' In other words, this mountain we stand on is a cradle of life's profoundest mysteries... A vast and terrifying hotbed of possibilities.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' The avalanche... it must have been the work of this impostor.
:{{DIcon}} I think so, too.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 10.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Agreed. All the other troubles you faced on the way down could also have been its handiwork. My guess is that it was targeting everyone that I've had contact with.
:{{DIcon}} Did this whopperflower steal your alchemy notes, too?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Right! I forgot all about that!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 11.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' It's not inconceivable.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' But... what was its purpose? Was it just trying to get rid of us?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 12.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 13.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I have a preliminary hypothesis on this.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 14.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Whopperflowers are masters of mimicry, and those we encounter in the wild often appear in the vicinity of the plants they impersonate.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 15.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' In other words, the whopperflower likely has an instinct to "replicate and replace."
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 16.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' As a plant, it will disguise itself as another plant and infiltrate the group, hiding among them for cover. The plant being imitated has no way to detect or fight back against this behavior.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 17.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' But when it disguises itself as a human...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It wanted to replace you and infiltrate our group?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 18.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Yes. Maybe it created the avalanche to get rid of us. I predicted this eventuality, so I availed myself of the avalanche to hide and lure it out.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 19.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' It was watching us the whole time, and when it saw that I had disappeared, its instinct was to take my place. At that point, its disguise was complete and its next move was to hunt its prey.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 ambor 04.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Yes, that's exactly how whopperflowers operate.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' So when it approached and attacked Joel... what was that? A trial run?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 20.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Perhaps... Or maybe it enjoyed posing as a human and wanted to experience what it felt like to be human.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' We're fortunate to have discovered it in time. I think the Traveler was the first person other than Albedo to notice something was wrong.
:{{DIcon}} Eula, you were very perceptive too.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 21.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Traveler, how could you tell the real me and my impostor apart?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 bennett 02.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' I wanna know, too! I had no idea the other guy was an impostor... They looked exactly the same to me.
:{{DIcon}} The impostor didn't have a star-shaped mark on its neck.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 22.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I see...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 23.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' It goes to show how difficult it is to impersonate a human. This mutant whopperflower tried its best to replicate the original exactly, but still managed to miss some details.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 ambor 05.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Unbelievable... to think that Dragonspine creates such terrifying possibilities...
:'''(Traveler):''' (A whopperflower... it adds up, but a piece of the puzzle is still missing...)
:'''(Traveler):''' (...Was this the same one we met on the day we were chasing the thief? It didn't feel quite the same... Could the whopperflower's mutation be unstable?)
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 bennett 03.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Anyway, at least we won in the end. It looks like my method did work after all &mdash; I used up all the bad luck, and the good luck finally came through!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 24.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' About that...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 25.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' If you're referring to having fallen down the mountain and avoided injury, well, that's because I was secretly protecting you.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 bennett 04.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Huh? Uhh... well that still counts as good luck to me!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 26.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Haha, yes, that's not an unreasonable way of looking at it.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 27.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Okay. We've been delayed long enough. Time to move on.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, let's go!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 11 albedo 28.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' ...
----
;(Approach the camp)
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 bennett 01.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Woohoo! I'm back!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Cyrus doesn't seem to be here... He must have headed up the mountain. Let's wait for him here.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Amber, are you feeling better?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Yep! All good now. Nothing to worry about.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 bennett 02.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' I don't know what I'd do without you guys... if not for you, I'd probably still be locked up in that cage...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 bennett 03.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' I really wanna thank you all properly, but I can't think how at the moment...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? You must be pretty used to being on the receiving end of people's kindness by now, though, surely? You probably need it often enough given your... situation, hehe.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 bennett 04.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' *sigh* ...Come on, don't put it like that.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 bennett 05.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Sure, plenty of people have shown me kindness before. But that doesn't mean I will ever take it for granted. No matter how many times people help me out in life, I will never forget any of them.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Well, instead of repaying those who helped you, perhaps you could help others yourself? Everyone meets others in need from time to time. By choosing to be there for them, you're passing the kindness you received onto others.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 bennett 06.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Yep, you're right. That's what I've always tried to do and will always continue to do.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 bennett 07.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Hahaha, right! And when Cyrus gets back, I'll find some way to help him out, too!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Phew... This has been quite an eventful day.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Yeah, it has! It's really hit me how tired I am now that I've started to relax...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I need to rest. Everyone, please excuse me for a while.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 ambor 04.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Yeah, I need to get some water and maybe a piece of fruit. Once I'm rested up, I need to get back to being an instructor again...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew, well it looks like the curse of the mountaineers who couldn't get off the mountain is finally broken.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Feels like an action-packed chapter has come to a close. Shall we find somewhere to rest and chat, too?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Why not. Then, please come with me.
:{{DIcon}} (Knew he had something to say to me...)
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' You sensed something too, didn't you? Then let's go.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Are you going back to your camp again? Paimon thought maybe we could talk here?
:{{DIcon}} Come on, Paimon.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, okay... might as well come with you...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 12 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Good. Shall we set off right away?
:{{DIcon}} Sure.

:'''You follow Albedo to a campsite in the mountains...'''

:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Sorry for bringing you back here once again. Some topics are best discussed in private.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is this about the impostor?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' That's right.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I have to say, Traveler... I'm very surprised you noticed the difference between me and the impostor.
:{{DIcon}} Do you mean the mark on your neck...?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Yes. This mark... perhaps it's where it all began.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh! Sounds like the beginning of a big story, keep going!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 05.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Well, I can't deny that what I'm about to say does sound like something from a children's storybook.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 06.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' So, what do you think this diamond-shaped mark means?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... A tattoo? A crest? ...Something else?
:{{DIcon}} A scar?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 07.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' No. Consider it... a birthmark.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 08.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Have you ever seen an intricate glass ornament and wondered how it was made? Well, one method for crafting with glass is a technique known as "glassblowing."
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 09.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Glassblowing is not a widely known art in Teyvat. For this reason, glassware made in this way is usually very expensive.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 10.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' As the name implies, glassblowing involves blowing air into a hole, much like blowing up a balloon.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 11.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' This type of glassware is known for having a "pontil mark" at the point where the blowpipe was inserted, where the hole was sealed at the very end. This mark is a sign that the item was crafted by a human hand.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds kind of amazing.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 12.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' It is a wondrous and beautiful art form. Alice says that these marks are seen as proof of the maker's fine handiwork, the only flaw in an otherwise perfect work of art.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 13.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' My mark is something similar to this.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 14.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' The difference between synthetic and natural life lies in the directional flow of the life force.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 15.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' The energy of a natural life form flows out from within. That's why flower buds bloom and curled leaves unfold. It is the very reason we watch in wonder at blossoming flowers.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 16.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Creating life artificially, on the other hand, involves &mdash; to a certain extent &mdash; the introduction of an external source of energy into the embryonic life form. When the hole where the life force was infused is sealed at the end, it leaves a mark not dissimilar to the pontil mark in blown glass wares.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 17.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' The alchemical substance drips and spreads out in all directions, resulting in this rather ingenious diamond shape.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, so that's where it came from...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 18.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' This mark is a sign of my artificial origins, and proof of my imperfection as a human.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 19.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I presume that the impostor intentionally avoided replicating this mark, so as not to become less than perfect himself.
:{{DIcon}} ...
::{{DIcon}} Should you be telling me all this?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 20.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' You are fundamentally different from other people. I have few qualms about sharing my secrets with you.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 21.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Just as Paimon said, it all sounds like a story. Even if you were to tell anyone else, they would regard it as nothing more than a tall tale.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 22.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' The transcendent and miraculous are not the only things to which human beings aspire. They pursue the everyday, the ordinary, to a far greater extent than I would have ever imagined.
:{{DIcon}} Hence the notion of "otherness."
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 23.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' People like to believe that those who are thoroughly different from themselves could only ever exist in stories. It makes things much easier.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 24.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Or in other words, all the unfathomable things we have seen recently would make good material for a novel.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 25.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I have friends who write novels. If they wrote this story, it would probably be even more complex.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Making up stories is easy. Even Paimon can do that!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 26.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Oh? I didn't know you had that kind of talent.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehehe, Paimon's the best guide in Teyvat. Making up stories is a piece of cake.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 27.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' In that case, how about we have a storytelling contest?
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 28.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' We can base our stories on the events of the last few days.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds great! But we still have to help out the Adventurers' Guild...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 29.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I understand. Creativity is something that cannot be rushed. Take your time, and come back when you have found some inspiration.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 30.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' We'll see whose story is more compelling.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Deal!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, we'll regroup with the Adventurers' Guild for now!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 13 albedo 31.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Sure.

===After the Quest===
;(Talk to Amber, Eula, and Joel at the Adventurer Camp)
:{{A|vo eqxs104 14 ambor 01.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Hahaha, it's been ages since I've built a snowman &mdash; it's so fun! Still a little cold, though... Brrr... My fingers are numb...
:{{A|vo eqxs104 14 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Amber, if the cold is getting to you, there's always hot soup back at the camp. Take a rest if you need one. Don't put too much pressure on yourself.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 14 joel 01.ogg}} '''Joel:''' So Amber really feels the cold, huh... but Aunty Eula, it doesn't seem to affect you at all.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 14 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Maybe it's because of our different capabilities. Elemental energy is... Ahem, sorry, not something you need to know about in any great detail. Simply put, it's because we have different abilities.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 14 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Yeah, harnessing the cold is definitely her specialty. In fact &mdash; in summertime, just standing next to her cools me down!
:{{A|vo eqxs104 14 joel 02.ogg}} '''Joel:''' Huh... c&mdash;capability? I didn't really get it, but... never mind. I like snowmen too.
:{{A|vo eqxs104 14 joel 03.ogg}} '''Joel:''' I, uh... really wish my dad could see them...
