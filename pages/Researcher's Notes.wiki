'''Researcher's Notes''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] involving several interactable items found around [[Watatsumi Island]] as well as a sudoku-like puzzle. Interacting with all five gives the {{Achievement|The Stranding of the Beagle}}; there is no order that needs to be followed. Solving all 3 puzzles will reward 2 exquisite chest and 1 precious chest.

:'''Researcher's Notes:''' "...The architecture of this ruin is quite similar to that which appears on structures dating back to the Archon War, but we will need to investigate further..."
:'''Researcher's Notes:''' "...It's just a shame that my current topic of study does not permit me to stay here for too long..."

===Location 2===
*West of the northernmost [[Teleport Waypoint]] on Watatsumi Island, on the top of a hill. There are two [[Nobushi: Hitsukeban]] present.

;(Upon finding the puzzle)
:'''Paimon:''' This mechanism looks super complicated &mdash; but Paimon's sure you'll be fine. Right?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's leaving this to you then, {{Traveler}}!

:'''Researcher's Notes:''' "This is a very interesting Ruin mechanism indeed..."
:'''Researcher's Notes:''' "...I shall assign a number to each of these cubes' positions. One shall be north, east shall be two. South three, and West, four..."
:'''Researcher's Notes:''' "...Adding on another four for those cubes with floating stone slates on them gives us five through eight..."
:'''Researcher's Notes:''' "...The sole empty position shall be nine, thus making up our nine-slotted puzzle..."
:'''Researcher's Notes:''' "...The lights on the stones don't seem to mean much. In that case..."
:'''Researcher's Notes:''' "Now then, let's try to make the sum of the numbers along the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines the same..."
:'''Researcher's Notes:''' "And eureka, I've solved it! Well, that's another entry for my thesis..."
:'''Researcher's Notes:''' "I should continue west and see if there are any other ruins."

;(After solving the first puzzle)
:'''Paimon:''' Woohoo, you got it! Paimon knew you would!
:'''Paimon:''' So little stuff? But the mechanism was so tough! ... Should we try it again?

;(First change)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, the mechanism looks different now! Does that mean... new treasure?
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, this looks even worse than before! Paimon's out of brain-juice again, {{Traveler}}!

;(After solving the second puzzle)
:'''Paimon:''' Is it just Paimon, or is this thing really stingy? The puzzle's not going to change again, is it?

;(Second change)
:'''Paimon:''' Ahh! It changed again! Well, you're up, {{Traveler}}!

;(After solving the third puzzle)
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, that's a huge treasure chest!
:'''Paimon:''' Easy-peasy, Paimon-squeezy, eh?

====Solving the Puzzles====
The notes provides several hints to solve the puzzle by creating a 3×3 matrix

# ''"...I shall assign a number to each of these cubes' positions. One shall be north, east shall be two. South three, and West, four..."''
#* "Positions" can be more accurately read as "orientation".
#* A cube that faces North will have a value of 1, a cube that faces East will have a value of 2, and so on.
#* Non-interacting cubes cannot be rotated, so their values will be fixed.
#* However, cubes that can be rotated will have values range from 1 to 4 based on where they face.
# ''"...Adding on another four for those cubes with floating stone slates on them gives us five through eight..."''
#* A value of 4 is added to all the cubes with a stone slate on top.
#* Again, non-rotating cubes have fixed values, while rotating cubes will have values range from 5 to 8 based on where they face.
# ''"...The sole empty position shall be nine, thus making up our nine-slotted puzzle..."''
#* The missing cube position has a fixed value of 9.
# ''"...The lights on the stones don't seem to mean much. In that case..."''
#* The lights on the stones can be ignored, and are only used to indicate cube orientation.
# ''"Now then, let's try to make the sum of the numbers along the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines the same..."''
#* The sum of values of the cubes should be the same for each row, column, and diagonal.
#* To solve the puzzle, algebraic manipulation or other methods can be performed. In short, because the value of each cube is actually unique from 1 to 9, this forms a {{w|Magic Square}} and the values should add up to 15 in each row, column, and diagonal.
