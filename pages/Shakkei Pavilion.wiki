==Trivia==
* Prior to [[Version 3.3]], the domain's description was "This magnificent mansion was built by an ancient ascetic warrior in the depths of the earth using scenery borrowed from the outside world. In latter days, a deeply disheartened eccentric would be discovered within."
** "A deeply disheartened eccentric" refers to [[Scaramouche]].
*** The original Chinese equivalent says {{zh|如同白纸一般失心的倾奇者|tl="a ''kabukimono'' who [was] disheartened like a blank sheet of paper."}}
*** {{lang|''{{w|Kabukimono}}''|zh=倾奇者|ja=傾奇者|ja_lit=crazy one|sort=ja,zh}} refers to a type of eccentric samurai or retainer who was active around 1600, from whose culture the style of {{lang|{{w|kabuki}}|ja=歌舞伎}} was developed. ''Kabukimono'' was also localized with similar terms in the [[Rather Aged Notes]] ("wandering eccentric") and [[Husk of Opulent Dreams#Plume of Luxury|Plume of Luxury]] ({{lang|"long-wandering eccentric"|zh=流浪多年的倾奇者|zh_tl=long-wandering ''kabukimono''}}).
*** {{Quest|Inversion of Genesis}} reveals that Scaramouche was called a ''kabukimono'' while he was in Tatarasuna and that he was found in Shakkei Pavilion by [[Katsuragi]] after being placed there by [[Ei]].
*** [[Husk of Opulent Dreams#Bloom Times|Bloom Times]] makes the same analogy using the word {{zh|白紙}} ("blank sheet of paper"): {{lang|"young man in the distant past, who was akin to a blank sheet of paper"|zh=遥远往昔那白纸一般的少年}}.
*** {{lang|"Disheartened"|zh=失心|zh_lit=lose heart}} is possibly used here in its literal sense (or as a pun for its literal sense), namely, the fact he was not chosen as a vessel for a [[Gnosis]], whose Chinese name {{zh|神之心}} means "Heart of God."
** Considering the above lore, the "ancient ascetic warrior" who built this mansion may be [[Ei]].
