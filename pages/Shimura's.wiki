==Descriptions==
{{Description|They say that this is one of the most popular food stores in the shopping district. The boss is a poor samurai and a self-made man. Though he was never able to make it big despite a lifetime of work, he was at last able to gain a little fief of his own here in the shopping district. If you haven't the time to stay for some tea, then at least get some food to go!|[[Map]] description}}
