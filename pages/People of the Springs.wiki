The '''People of the Springs''', or '''Meztli''', is one of the six tribes in [[Natlan]]. They can be found at the [["People of the Springs"]] along the shores of the [[Toyac Springs]].<ref name="Mualani Intro">HoYoLab: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/31079191 Swellrider of Perennial Springs]</ref> Their current chief is [[Amina]].

==Overview==
It is said that the man who would become the first chief of the People of the Springs went on an adventure in search of the legendary mysterious island. With the help and trust of his band of companions, he reached the destination. However, when faced with the final peril, he chose to abandon the "outcome" to save his companions. Upon returning empty-handed, he realized that he had already found the treasure and with his companions, they established Meztli.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Mysterious Island's Truth}}</ref>

The People of the Springs have a long history of serving as guides and cartographers.<ref name="Mualani Intro" /> They live alongside the [[Koholasaurus]] and like to bathe in the hot springs with them. The tribe utilizes both natural and artificial springs; the former are for locals and those vetted to use them, while the latter are for foreigners who are unable to tolerate the temperature of natural springs. In addition, the People of the Springs often come together to go fishing, listen to music, or just relax. It's also said that the region the People of the Springs live in is an awesome vacation spot.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/3kU5vRFr2Tg Stop Motion Animation: "Natlan Tribe Introductions"].</ref> Their current chief is [[Amina]].

===Former===
* [[Atea]] (poisoned by the [[Abyssal Corruption]])<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Home of the Hot Springs|quote='''Mualani:''' (...) During battle, she was impaled in the abdomen by an Abyssal monster. The doctors managed to save her life, but they made it clear that she could never bathe in the hot springs again. Abyssal power still exists within her body. Immersing herself in hot water would accelerate the corrosion of her internal organs and the progression of her illness.}}</ref><ref group="Note" name="Atea">In {{Quest|Past and Future}}, she, along with past Natlanese, appears before [[Mavuika]], suggesting that she has passed away.<br>Also after completing {{Quest|Past and Future}}, NPC dialogue becomes available<!-- Atea remains alive talking with Anaa and Niu throughout Act II of Chapter V --> in which Atea is mentioned; this also strongly hints that she has since passed away. <br>Later after completing {{Quest|The Rainbow Destined to Burn}}, when talking to [[Amina]], she mentions that people were killed and hopes that "they all went to the same place as Auntie Atea", confirming that Atea has passed away.</ref>
