|text1    = This ancient aggregation of machinery hails from the desert and has quirks that modern-day civilizations cannot comprehend. In battle, the [[Algorithm of Semi-Intransient Matrix of Overseer Network]] will fire its components out while its core enters an "invisible" state that hides it and increases its RES. {{Color|help|Use Catalyze reactions to strike this core, or use Electro attacks on it during such times as the fired components have been destroyed and need to recover}} to cancel this invisibility and cause the core to be immobilized due to overclocking. If you fail to cancel the core's invisibility for too long, the Algorithm of Semi-Intransient Matrix of Overseer Network will begin to display its power by using a mighty overclocked attack...
