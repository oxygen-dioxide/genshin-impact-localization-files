;(Talk to Kazuha)
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 2 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Greetings, {{Traveler}} and Paimon. I heard there would be guides for the [[Irodori Festival]], but I didn't expect it would be you two.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, we didn't expect to see you either! Returning as a guest for the Irodori Festival, no doubt!
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 2 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I was a little surprised myself when I received the invitation. But after wandering the outside world for so long, it is good to have an opportunity to return to my homeland and pay respects to my old friends.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kazuha, when we saw you in the distance just now, you seemed to be looking for something. What happened?
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 2 kazuha 03.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Ah yes, you see, when I came off the boat with everyone just now, I suddenly heard light footsteps around me.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 2 kazuha 04.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I could tell they were not footsteps of a regular passenger, but by the time I turned around, the person had already disappeared. I only heard a splash come from below the pier.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 2 kazuha 05.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Even though I didn't manage to catch a glimpse of them, I found this strange piece of paper by my feet.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, does the paper happen to have a poem written on it?
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 2 kazuha 06.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Huh, how did you know?
:{{Black Screen|You tell Kazuha all that's happened over the last few days...}}
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 2 kazuha 07.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Fascinating. It's almost hard to believe such things could happen.
:{{DIcon}} Kazuha, can you show us that piece of paper?
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 2 kazuha 08.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Sure, here it is. Please, have a look.
;(Open [[The Five Kasen's Splendor: Akahito]])
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Last time, Aoi no Okina's poem ended with a reference to Akahito. And sure enough, this is a story about him.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The story this time basically says that Akahito got his name from his love of red seals. However, the Shogun discovered that he had committed plagiarism, and he was soon exiled...
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, if Paimon were to rate today's story, it sounds pretty unfortunate!
:{{DIcon}} Well, the other stories weren't much better either...
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 2 kazuha 09.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I don't think there's anything particularly wrong with this story. I, too, was once wanted as a criminal by the Shogunate, so I'm not all that different from Akahito mentioned in this story.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But according to the story, Akahito was exiled by the shogun because of his wrongdoings. You did nothing wrong, Kazuha.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Traveler, what are you thinking about?
:{{DIcon}} The seal mentioned in the story...
:{{DIcon}} Maybe it can help Xingqiu?
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 2 kazuha 10.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Ah, by the way, you mentioned that your friend has been struggling because he's unable to sign his name quickly, right?
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 2 kazuha 11.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' In Liyue and Inazuma, there is a saying: "that which has been stamped has also been signed." Perhaps using a seal could be a feasible solution.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 2 kazuha 12.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' While sailing at sea, I sometimes carve things to pass the time. If you wish to create a stamp for his seal, I might be able to help.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, that's an idea! Quick, let's go tell Albedo.

;(Talk to Albedo)
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Albedo, we've figured out a way to help Xingqiu!
:{{Black Screen|You tell Albedo everything that happened with Kazuha...}}
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 3 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Interesting... A story of The Five Kasen appears again, and with a timely solution.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 3 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' A stamped seal, huh? Hmm, let me think.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 3 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Indeed, it is an efficient solution. If we use a stamp, then Xingqiu won't have to struggle with his handwriting anymore. However...
:{{DIcon}} However?
:{{DIcon}} Is there another problem?
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 3 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Since Xingqiu's signature has been previously revealed to the readers, it would seem insincere if he only used a stamped seal for his new books.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 3 albedo 05.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' But, I have another idea. Using a seal is a part of it, of course. Let's go to Uyuu Restaurant now to discuss my idea with everyone.
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|Albedo seems to have figured out a way to help Xingqiu. Go look for Xingqiu in Uyuu Restaurant together with him.}}

;(Approach Xingqiu and the editors behind the desk on the second floor)
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 hirayama 01.ogg}} '''Hirayama:''' Yes, that's it, Zhenyu! Your writing has greatly improved today, which means yesterday's intensive training was effective!
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' My apologies, but I simply can't do it anymore. My hands are so sore that I can't even move them anymore... *sigh* I should've known better than to read novels during calligraphy class.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 hirayama 02.ogg}} '''Hirayama:''' You just had a ten-minute break. C'mon, you can do this!
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 onodera 01.ogg}} '''Onodera:''' When it comes to pushing a deadline, there is no one more brutal than Mr. Hirayama.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 murata 01.ogg}} '''Murata:''' No wonder Lady Yae would always send the editorial director to handle troublesome authors...
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, this is getting scary! It hasn't even been that long and Xingqiu's already zombified.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Mr. Hirayama, we found a solution that might just solve our dilemma.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' In both Liyue and Inazuma, seals are widely used as the equivalent of a signature. If we use a stamp to leave the author's seal on the books, then we could make the signature process a lot easier.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Of course, a seal on its own is not enough. So, I propose that each signature consists of two parts.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' First, we'll use a personalized seal. We can simply carve one using Zhenyu's signature as the design.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 albedo 05.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' In addition, I'll also design a simple but elegant pattern that's easy for Zhenyu to write. That way, he will only need to draw a simple pattern on each book.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 hirayama 03.ogg}} '''Hirayama:''' Hmm, let me think...
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 hirayama 04.ogg}} '''Hirayama:''' Alright, I think that would work! Not only does it still involve the author's own handwriting, but the result should be very beautiful as well.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' So what you mean to say is, I've been saved from this predicament?
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 onodera 02.ogg}} '''Onodera:''' Mr. Hirayama, it suddenly occurred to me that the reason we gave up on live book signings previously was because it would take too long for the author to sign each book.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 onodera 03.ogg}} '''Onodera:''' But if we adopt Calx's proposed method, we might have enough time to do signatures at the live event.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 onodera 04.ogg}} '''Onodera:''' And if all the authors signed their books in the same fashion, then Zhenyu's signature wouldn't look out of place.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 albedo 06.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' If you think it's feasible, I would certainly be happy to design signatures for the other authors as well.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Yes, and you may leave carving the stamps to me.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 hirayama 05.ogg}} '''Hirayama:''' In that case, I shall contact the other two authors participating in the new release event.
:{{Black Screen|Shortly after, the two other authors arrive...}}
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 satomi 01.ogg}} '''Satomi:''' It is a great honor to use a signature designed by Calx.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 kadenokojikenzaburou 01.ogg}} '''Kadenokouji Kenzaburou:''' My pen name is quite complicated and isn't suitable for signing events. However, if we implement this new format, then it'll be a dream come true for me as well.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! Looks like everyone's on board with the idea.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 hirayama 06.ogg}} '''Hirayama:''' I'm sorry to have kept you busy for so long, Zhenyu. Please, take the next few days to have a good rest. We'll handle everything from here.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 hirayama 07.ogg}} '''Hirayama:''' The books that Zhenyu already signed can be used as special prizes in future events held by the Yae Publishing House.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 onodera 05.ogg}} '''Onodera:''' Phew... we did it, the event is saved!
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 xingqiu 03.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Thanks to everyone's efforts, Onodera and I are finally free of that mess.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, that's right! You're finally free, Xingqiu. Maybe you should step outside for some fresh air.

;(Talk to Onodera, Murata, and Hirayama again)
:{{A|vo dialog rcjeq004 hirayama 01.ogg}} '''Hirayama:''' Onodera, please inform Lady Yae of the changes in the event planning when you have a moment. She will surely like to hear about our new idea.
:{{A|vo dialog rcjeq004 hirayama 02.ogg}} '''Hirayama:''' You're a quick thinker, Onodera. As long as you exercise a little prudence, you'll be able to achieve great things in the future.
:{{A|vo dialog rcjeq004 onodera 01.ogg}} '''Onodera:''' Uh, got it. Thank you very much, Mr. Hirayama.

:{{A|vo rcjeq004 5 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I was just going to the festival venue to prepare the ikebana lesson, when I found a strange piece of paper on a flower stand.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 5 ayaka 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' This bard just happened to be close by at the time. He informed me that you've also found similar papers recently. As such, we came together to find you two.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 5 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' But the paper she found isn't quite the same as the ones we found before.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 5 ayaka 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Here's the paper. Please, have a look.
;(Open [[The Five Kasen's Splendor: Sumizome]])
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, all the poems we found before were roughly the same length, but this one is only two lines!
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 5 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' And even though there are only two short sentences, neither of them are next to the title or centered on the page.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 5 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Hmm, the position of the writing seems to indicate that there is other content written on this paper besides these two lines.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 5 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' If we take the poem literally, it reads, "Dip this paper in water, and see the truth naturally appear."
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 5 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Speaking of which, I have an ancient text at home, specializing in ancient and exotic stories. It mentions a special ink that will show itself when wet, and disappear when it's dry.

;(Approach the pond)
:{{Black Screen|You carefully dip the paper into the water...}}
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, look! It's really working, more words have appeared on the paper!
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let Paimon see what it says!
;(Open [[The Five Kasen's Splendor: Sumizome]])
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, the story says that after Sumizome got the collection of poems from Akahito and put them into a stream of water...
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The plagiarized words in the poem became blurry... Huh, why would that happen?
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 6 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' You see, Paimon, in the past, when printing was not yet well-developed, handwritten text could easily become smudged in books when exposed to moisture.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 6 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' To ensure the text lasted longer, they'd either write using a special ink or coat the paper's surface with a waterproof coating once the writing was finished.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 6 ayaka 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Such special inks are time-consuming and laborious to produce, and the waterproof coating could also prove just as difficult.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 6 ayaka 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' However, since Akahito's poetry collection was an important gift to be presented to the Shogun, surely one of those two methods was used to protect it.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 6 ayaka 05.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' But as for the plagiarized poems, not only would they lack Akahito's seal, but the words would also react differently when exposed to liquid.
:{{DIcon}} So this poem wasn't written by Akahito.
:{{DIcon}} It was added later by someone else.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *gasp* Which means Akahito didn't plagiarize his work! He was set up!
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 6 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Yes, it appears that this is the truth that Sumizome's story is trying to convey.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 6 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Although the story is saddening, I've decided on the subjects to use for Akahito and Sumizome's portraits.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 6 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Kazuha, Ayaka, would you be willing to be the models for my paintings?
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 6 ayaka 06.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I would be delighted.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 6 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Yes, as would I.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There you go! The next two portraits should be ready in no time!
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 6 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Yes, and now that all four stories have all been collected, the story of The Five Kasen is now fully completed.

::'''Yae Miko:''' Long ago, Inazuma had five legendary poets
::'''Yae Miko:''' People bestowed upon them the title of The Five Kasen
::'''Venti:''' One Year
::'''Venti:''' The poet Suikou made his way to the Tenshukashu
::'''Venti:''' And presented the Kasen's work for the Shogun's perusal
::'''Venti:''' But a page from the works of Aoi no Okina had been torn out
::'''Venti:''' And Suikou was questioned regarding the matter
::'''Venti:''' Suikou pleaded guilty
::'''Venti:''' He admitted to drinking at the tavern the night before
::'''Venti:''' And vaguely recalled a mysterious figure approaching while he was intoxicated
::'''Xingqiu:''' That figure was none other than Aoi no Okina himself
::'''Xingqiu:''' This turn of events had begun with an unnamed individual
::'''Xingqiu:''' Under whose coercion Aoi no Okina was forced
::'''Xingqiu:''' To take drastic measures to retrieve a page of poetry
::'''Xingqiu:''' He knew nothing
::'''Xingqiu:''' Of this individual's true intentions
::'''Xingqiu:''' All he knew was that
::'''Xingqiu:''' The poem had to do with an old acquaintance, Akahito
::'''Kaedahara Kazuha:''' Akahito had once belonged to the Five Kasen
::'''Kaedahara Kazuha:''' Each poem he composed, he marked with a scarlet red seal
::'''Kaedahara Kazuha:''' Hence the "Aka" in his name

::'''Kamisato Ayaka:''' And noticed that the plagiarized poem lacked his seal
::'''Kamisato Ayaka:''' She immersed his poetry in a stream nearby
::'''Kamisato Ayaka:''' And only on the plagiarized poem
::'''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Did the ink run
::'''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Aoi no Okina passed by
::'''Kamisato Ayaka:''' And witnessed Sumizome's doing

:{{DIcon}} Paimon, what's wrong?
:{{DIcon}} You seem upset, Paimon.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah... Ever since we completed the story of The Five Kasen, there's still one thing Paimon hasn't been able to figure out.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' One of The Five Kasen is called Kuronushi, right?
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's just that... How could the story of The Five Kasen finish without him appearing at all?
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Oh, hahaha! Have you really not noticed?
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Not noticed what? Ugh, this is no time to be playing games, Tone-Deaf Bard!
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' What he means is that the story of Kuronushi was already embedded within the four poems.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, really?
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' That's right. The key lies in the poem that Aoi no Okina wrote after seeing Sumizome rinsing the poetry collection.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' An average person could never understand the scene of a young girl washing Akahito's poetry collection in a stream.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Even Aoi no Okina couldn't figure out the meaning behind Sumizome's actions. He was simply reminiscing and thinking about his old acquaintances.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' However, for the perpetrator who framed Akahito, it was completely obvious.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' He was worried that if this poem was seen by the Shogun, then the Shogun could discover the truth behind the plagiarism incident. If that happened, then he'd be finished.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 venti 07.ogg}} '''Venti:''' So in desperation, he threatened Aoi no Okina to make him tear out this poem.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Which means... the one who threatened Aoi no Okina is the same person that framed Akahito!
:{{DIcon}} The culprit is none other than Kuronushi.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What, Kuronushi!?
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 venti 08.ogg}} '''Venti:''' That's right. Though there are only four poems, they still manage to tell the complete story of all five kasen.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 venti 09.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Since the Shogun mentioned in the poems is certainly not one of The Five Kasen, the only character left is the mysterious one with an unknown identity.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohh, okay... Paimon is finally starting to get it now.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' However, this also brings something else to mind.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' The story of The Five Kasen has more or less reflected everything that has been happening around us lately.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Which begs the question... Is there a Kuronushi in our world as well?
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A Kuronushi... In our world?
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 7 venti 10.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Speaking of which, I wonder if our dear Kazuha has come up with anything.

:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Kazuha! Are you okay? You've been standing in front of this blank canvas for a while... and you don't look so good.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Apologies for making a wild assumption, but has the story of The Five Kasen reminded you of anything?
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 kazuha 01.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Yes, a few things did come to mind, actually. However, they were nothing more than some past incidents regarding my family.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 kazuha 02.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I don't mind sharing the stories, but I'd prefer not to bring you any more trouble.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, we're all friends here, Kazuha. You can always tell us whatever's on your mind.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Kaedehara, please forgive my assumption, but perhaps you are thinking of the [[Raiden Gokaden]]?
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The "Raiden Gokaden"? What's that?
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 kazuha 03.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' It appears that Miss Kamisato and I were thinking of the same thing.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 kazuha 04.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' But it also has much to do with the [[Yashiro Commission]]. It would be improper to speak of it here without the consent of Miss Kamisato.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' It's fine. Those of us here are all trustworthy, so there isn't any harm in it.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 ayaka 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' However, this matter is somewhat complicated and may be difficult to explain. Let me start with the Raiden Gokaden.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 ayaka 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' As you all know, the Yashiro Commission's primary purpose is managing ceremonial and cultural affairs, and Inazuma's art of forging swords is a very important part of our culture.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 ayaka 05.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' The Raiden Gokaden were once the top five schools of the forging art in Inazuma. Although these families were swordsmiths by craft, they also held many important positions in the Yashiro Commission.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 ayaka 06.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Unfortunately, of the five, only the [[Amenoma Art]] still maintains its artisan lineage. The descendants of the [[Raiden Gokaden#Isshin Art|Isshin Art]] are also still alive, but the craft has been lost to time.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 ayaka 07.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' The descendants of the Isshin Art are none other than the [[Kaedehara Clan|Kaedehara family]].
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! We knew Kazuha came from a noble family, but we had no idea about his connection to the Yashiro Commission and sword making.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 kazuha 05.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Yes, but that's all part of the past now. The Isshin Art was lost with my great grandfather's generation.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 kazuha 06.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' My grandfather was dissatisfied with my great-grandfather's lack of effort. When he was young, my grandfather traveled all over Teyvat to find a way to revive the family business, but it was to no avail.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 kazuha 07.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' And in my generation, our last remaining family property was lost as well.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 ayaka 08.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I heard my elder brother mention that the decline of the Raiden Gokaden happened very rapidly. In a span of a few decades, three of the families suffered various misfortunes and disappeared completely.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 ayaka 09.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Later, there was speculation that all of these misfortunes stemmed from some background machinations, meaning that someone wanted to wipe out the Raiden Gokaden.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 ayaka 10.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' However, since not every family of the Raiden Gokaden came to ruin, such explanations were treated as nothing more than a conspiracy theory.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 kazuha 08.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Indeed, I've also believed such ideas were just theories and rumors.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 kazuha 09.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' However, I know that a major incident happened to my great-grandfather when he was young.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 kazuha 10.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Not only did it affect the Kaedehara Clan, but it nearly jeopardized the Kamisato Clan's position in the Yashiro Commission as well.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 kazuha 11.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' After reading the story of The Five Kasen, I can't help but feel like it's pointing me toward the truth behind that incident.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What exactly happened to your great-grandfather, Kazuha?
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 kazuha 12.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I still can't say, I need to speak with someone to verify the details. Let's meet here again at noon tomorrow.
:{{A|vo rcjeq004 8 kazuha 13.ogg}} '''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I will tell you everything I know then.

;(Examine Akahito's Likeness)
:'''Akahito's Likeness:''' (This is Akahito's likeness, as done by Albedo.)
:'''Akahito's Likeness:''' (Kazuha was the model for this picture, and it shows Akahito, his garments red in his trademark style, kneeling before the throne as he is being punished by the Shogun.)
:'''Akahito's Likeness:''' ("Won't this image bring ill luck?" Someone asked, but neither the artist nor the model thought that this was a problem.)

;(Examine Sumizome's Likeness)
:'''Sumizome's Likeness:''' (This is Sumizome's likeness, as done by Albedo.)
:'''Sumizome's Likeness:''' (Ayaka was the model for this picture, and it depicts Sumizome rinsing the poetry collection in water, with a little extra flair, of course.)
:'''Sumizome's Likeness:''' ("You know, the Sumizome drawn here really looks like the Shirasagi Himegimi," so most of the guests have said. This portrait has also proved the most popular in terms of photos taken with it.)

;(Examine Portrait Canvas)
:'''Portrait Canvas:''' (A blank canvas which will soon be used to draw a lovely picture of one of the Five Kasen.)
