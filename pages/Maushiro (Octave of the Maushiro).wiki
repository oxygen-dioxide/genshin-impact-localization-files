'''Maushiro''' is a [[Quest Item]] obtained during the {{Quest|Octave of the Maushiro}} and then given to [[Sumida]].

It belonged to the ancestor of [[Kama]], who intended to give it to [["Sayo"|Sayo]] before she had left [[Tsurumi Island]], but he did not have the courage to present it to her. According to Kama, the giving of a personally-made Maushiro to someone was considered a marriage proposal, so this was likely "Kama"'s intention.
