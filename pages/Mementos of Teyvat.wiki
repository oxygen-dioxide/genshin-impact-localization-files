{{Description|Your footprints can be seen in every corner of the land, and wherever you've been, your memories linger in the air. Sometimes those who walk too long a road are prone to forget the incredible things they saw along the way, so it's important to capture moments of the past to look back on. This is one reason why [[Paimon]] constantly pesters you to take photos. The other is that, seeing as the pair of you went to the trouble of buying a photobook, wouldn't it be a waste not to use it?}}

After passing Wangshu Inn atop its giant tree and the shallows of the Guili Plains, we arrived at Liyue Harbor. We had an acquaintance in Liyue &mdash; Xiangling, head chef of the Wanmin Restaurant. No matter how far we've come, we always return to Liyue for the Lantern Rite each year, sampling our old favorites at the Wanmin Restaurant and spending the holidays with our friends.

Inazuma, the nation of lightning, is far away across the sea, and can only be reached by boat. We met Kazuha, a native Inazuman traveling with a fleet who'd been wandering the world just like us, and together discussed many things concerning Inazuma. We heard about the Grand Narukami Shrine's Fortune Slips, and how popular they are among believers. We sometimes go draw a slip or two ourselves &mdash; when we're feeling lucky, of course!
