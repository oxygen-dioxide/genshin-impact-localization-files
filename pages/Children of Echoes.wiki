The '''Children of Echoes''', or '''Nanatzcayan''', is one of the six tribes in [[Natlan]]. They can be found at the [["Children of Echoes"]] inside the gorge in [[Tequemecan Valley]]. Their current chief is [[Pacal]].

==Overview==
This tribe was founded prior to the formation of the [[Grand Alliance]]. The first known use of the name "Nanatzcayan" was in reference to [[Ixquieh]]'s time as chief.<ref name="Yaxche">{{Ref/Weapon|Ring of Yaxche}}</ref>

According to [[Ranjit]], the Children of Echoes are fine miners, excavators, and skilled appraisers of gems who live in the mines in eastern Natlan.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Ranjit}}</ref> They have 19 mining teams, and their [[Tepetlisaur]] companions help them by mining and finding the best ores.

The Children of Echoes value gemstones very highly; they consider "stone" one of their symbols<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Natlan! A New Adventure|quote='''Kachina:''' Hahaha, don't worry! Our tribe works closely with stone. That's one of our symbols, actually.}}</ref> and some even describe them like a second layer of skin.<ref name="Avilix">{{Ref/NPC|Avilix}}</ref> Tribe members will often decorate their tools, weapons, and accessories with gems, which some see as an indicator of skill or status.<ref name="Cheven">{{Ref/NPC|Cheven}}</ref> According to [[Vichama]], the Nanatzcayan are the sole producer of obsidian,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|To Reclaim an Ancient Name}}</ref> a very important ceremonial material in Natlan.

According to [[Avilix]], it is sometimes difficult to get enough sunlight because the tribe has "dug too deep into the mountains," but the rowdy spirit of the tribespeople makes up for it.<ref name="Avilix" /> The Nanatzcayan enjoy rhythmic music<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Batz}}</ref> and dancing, particularly {{w|breakdancing}}.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/3kU5vRFr2Tg Stop Motion Animation: "Natlan Tribe Introductions"]</ref> They hold regular dance competitions, such as the "Drillbit Dance Dance-Off," which has occurred daily for over 350 years.<ref>{{Ref/BB|Children of Echoes Bulletin Board}}</ref><ref group=Note>The Drillbit Dance Dance-Off is stated to be on its 127751st iteration, which gives ~350 when divided by 365.</ref>

==Trivia==
* Many members of the Children of Echoes have {{W|Mayan languages|Mayan}} names, mainly deriving from the names of deities and historical figures.
** Some members also have {{W|Nahuatl}} words as names. 
* According to [[Siyah]], he was told to man the [[Saurian Relics Association]] stand at [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame: Chuwen Fair|Chuwen Fair]] because "Children of Echoes have a knack for business." However, it may be the case that his colleagues simply didn't want the job.

===Etymology===
* Nanatzcayan in Nahuatl means "the place where it clashes."
* Like the other known tribes, Nanatzcayan is likely derived from Ilhuicatl-Nanatzcayan, the heaven of storms from the {{w|Thirteen Heavens}} in Aztec mythology.
** In the name of the Aztec heaven (also known as Ilhuicatl-Itzapan-Nanatzcayan "the sky where obsidian stones clash in water"), the "clashing" alludes to the noise preceding hailstorms.
** The name Children of Echoes could allude to the Aztec god {{w|Tepēyōllōtl}} (Nahuatl: Tepetl "Mountain"; Yolotl "Heart") meaning "heart of the mountains." He was a god related to echoes, mountains, caves, earthquakes and the ocelotl.
