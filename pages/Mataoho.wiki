{{Dialogue End}}

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Mataoho:''' There are many kinds of hot springs here. Don't wander off into the wrong one!
:{{DIcon}} What's the difference between them?
::'''Mataoho:''' Ah, the main difference is the temperature. The artificial hot springs we built for the tourists are usually quite a bit cooler, so it won't be a problem even if you were to soak in there for a whole day.
::'''Mataoho:''' Compared to that, there are far less ways to control the temperature of the natural pools. Usually, you'll only find the heat-loving [[Koholasaur]]s playing in there.
::'''Mataoho:''' Of course, there are always those who love the top temps, or just want to challenge themselves. You can sometimes find those "experts" swimming with the [[Saurian]]s.
::'''Mataoho:''' I have a lot of respect for them, but what they do is not for the faint of heart... and definitely not for outlanders.
::{{DIcon}} Do many outlanders come to take a dip?
::'''Mataoho:''' Hmm, I'd say a lot? Most tourists enjoy their time here, and since they're already here, might as well enjoy a dip in the hot springs.
::'''Mataoho:''' I remember [[Aikawa Susumu|a gentleman who came here from Inazuma]]. He would have spent every hour of every day in the hot springs if he could... It always took me a lot of effort to drag him out of the pool.
::'''Mataoho:''' He even wrote me a letter after going back home. He said he'd opened a [[Aisa Bathhouse|hot spring hotel]] in Inazuma, and even invited me to come.
::'''Mataoho:''' Unfortunately, I can't just leave Natlan willy-nilly... Otherwise, I'd have loved to check out what he's done.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} A tingling feeling, perhaps.
::'''Mataoho:''' Hmm? You mean something more stimulating for the skin and muscles? Can't quite imagine that...
::'''Mataoho:''' But based on your description, you might need to eat something to restore stamina after soaking in that.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Chocolate|20|x=2}})
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for the reminder.
::'''Mataoho:''' You're welcome.
