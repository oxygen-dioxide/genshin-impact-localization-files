:'''Master of Stars:''' Hmm? You speak to Starsnatcher, Celestial Lord...
:'''Master of Stars:''' ...Well, a follower of his, at any rate. What is it?
:{{DIcon}} Your mask...
::'''Master of Stars:''' Familiar, isn't it? I picked it up below the inn. I suppose that it must be the one that Lord Starsnatcher always wore.
::'''Master of Stars:''' But this has to be a spare. I can't imagine that Lord Starsnatcher would just leave his mask behind...
::'''Master of Stars:''' What sin must we have committed for us to be abandoned by Lord Starsnatcher? Come to think of it, I have not seen His Lordship in many days...
:{{DIcon}} He's a fake, you know.
::'''Master of Stars:''' Preposterous! Preposterous!
::'''Master of Stars:''' How dare you slander Lord Starsnatcher in the presence of his followers? You, you...
::'''Master of Stars:''' ...Hmph. A follow of an adeptus must not swear. What's more, I am wearing His Lordship's mask.
::'''Master of Stars:''' Leave. Leave now. I do not wish to speak to you. Aye, you must be a fake yourself, you fake!
:{{DIcon}} Nothing, see you around.
::'''Master of Stars:''' Oh, are you a follower of Lord Starsnatcher as well? If you should ever have the good fortune to see him again, please tell me.
