'''Critical Hits''' refers to the random occurrence of an attack dealing increased [[damage]] to an opponent.

If the attack is a Critical Hit, the CRIT DMG multiplier is applied:
:<math>\text{DMG}_\text{CRIT} = \text{DMG} \times (1 + \%\text{CRIT DMG})</math>

The base [[CRIT Rate]] for most characters is 5%, while the base [[CRIT DMG]] is 50%. These attributes can be increased by:
*[[Elemental Resonance]]s
*[[Talents]]
*[[Constellations]]
*[[Artifacts]]
*[[Weapons]]
*[[Food]]
*[[Character]] Ascension Bonuses

Note that [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]]'s CRIT Rate is decreased by 100% via [[Flawless Strategy]], which means her base CRIT Rate will start negative. A negative CRIT Rate means that attacks will never CRIT.

Critical Hits cannot trigger on enemies that are immune to the type of damage dealt or during enemy [[Invincibility Frames#Enemies|i-frames]].

Critical Hits appear as larger-[[font]] numbers on the screen compared to non-crit hits. Another way to tell if you scored a critical hit is to watch the DMG dealt; a critical hit will have damage multiplied.

==CRIT Optimization==
{{Main|Attribute Optimization}}<!--using <math>r</math> makes the variable appear thin and awkward in-text (at least on desktop), unless this is fixed, r will be used in instead-->
There is a general rule to maximize the product of CRIT DMG and CRIT Rate to maximize the expected DMG.

Let r be the CRIT Rate probability (<math>r\le 1</math>) and d be the CRIT DMG (<math>d \ge 0</math>) in decimal form (for example, 150% CRIT DMG would be <math>d=1.5</math>).

Suppose the DMG is x without CRIT. The '''expected damage''' is therefore:
:<math>E(\text{DMG}) = (1-r)x + r(1+d)x = x(1 + rd)</math>

In general, the goal is to maximize this product by making r and d as large as possible. However, by introducing a constraint on the relation between r and d, it is possible to calculate an optimal ratio between the two. The rule of thumb is to aim for a 2:1 ratio between CRIT DMG and CRIT Rate. See [[Attribute Optimization]] for full derivations of these results.

==Guaranteed CRIT Hits==
===General===
* Having 100% or more CRIT Rate means that attacks will always critically hit.
* Aimed Shots on an enemy's weak point guarantees a CRIT Hit.
* On [[Ruin Machines]], this is on the exposed cores.
* On most [[Mystical Beasts]] and most humanoid enemies ([[Kairagi]], [[Nobushi]], [[Treasure Hoarders]], [[Fatui (Enemies)|Fatui]], etc.), this is directly on the head.
* On certain enemies, the weak point may be protected until the enemy performs certain actions.

==Domains==
* Certain [[Ley Line Disorders]] increase the CRIT Rate or CRIT Damage of players:
** Spiral Abyss Floors [[Spiral Abyss/Floors#Floor 7|7]] and [[Spiral Abyss/Floors#Floor 8| 8]]
* Certain [[Spiral Abyss/Benediction of the Abyss|Benedictions of the Abyss]] increase the CRIT Rate or CRIT Damage of players:
**  Character CRIT Rate +8%, CRIT DMG +15%
