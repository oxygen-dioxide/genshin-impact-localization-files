{{Description|Hailing from a dark world, this ruler of the black wolves has the power to call upon its followers, its hidden claws, to dissolve space itself and forge a rift through which it may enter.<br />The Wolflord has no name, for it was but one of "[[Gold]]"'s unintentional creations, and that is precisely why it is obsessed with invading worlds that do not belong to it and making a name for itself.<br />That said, the wolf pack is far from unintelligent. After suffering a defeat in its previous invasion, a deserted island where no humans or protectors dwell has been selected for them to prepare for their lord's descent.|[[Archive]]}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
* '''Corrosion:''' As with all Riftwolves, the Golden Wolflord is capable of inflicting stacks of [[Corrosion]] with its attacks.
* '''Tornado:''' The Golden Wolflord generates a massive tornado that moves around the arena, randomly and rapidly dealing '''50% ATK''', '''12.5% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}. The Golden Wolflord will be stunned after this attack.
* '''Laser Beam:''' The Golden Wolflord fires a laser beam from its mouth, raking across the arena, randomly and rapidly dealing '''50% ATK''', '''12.5% ATK''', '''5% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} to players caught in the beam.
* '''Ramming Attack:''' The Golden Wolflord rams the player with its mass, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} on hit. The Golden Wolflord will be stunned after this attack.
* '''Skull Strike:''' The Golden Wolflord sends its skulls to attack the player in sets of three, one at a time, each dealing '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}} on impact.
* '''Sweep:''' Sweeps the surrounding area with its tail, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}.
* '''Rifthound Skulls:''' Upon reaching '''70%''' HP, the Golden Wolflord generates a shield, [[Vacuum Field|pushes]] nearby players away, and summons 3 Rifthound Skulls.<ref group="Note">Zach Aguilar calls these "Rifthound Alphas" in the [https://youtu.be/sgAvJlOL0Gg Version 2.3 Special Program]. The ''English (United States)'' closed captioning corrects this at ~23:14.<br />"It will summon *Rifthound Skulls to provide it with shields."</ref> When the Golden Wolflord is protected by a shield, it is fully immune to damage. The Rifthound Skulls will periodically shoot projectiles that home towards the player, dealing '''12.5% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}} on hit. Each Rifthound Skull can be fully charged by 3 [[Gauge Unit Theory|gauges]] of {{Geo}} application (affected by [[Internal Cooldown|ICD]]), or 38 instances of non-Geo elemental DMG (unaffected by gauge units or ICD). Once at max charge, they will launch themselves towards the Golden Wolflord and deal damage to its shield. Once its shield is destroyed, the Golden Wolflord will be stunned. Upon waking up, it will deal {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}} without triggering corrosion if the player is too close. This phase can be skipped if the Golden Wolflord is defeated before it can generate its shield.
* '''Earthshaking Dive:''' Flies up and dives into the ground with great force, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}} in a massive area covering the majority of the arena. After it resurfaces, 8 massive explosions will follow that again cover the majority of the arena, each dealing '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}. This attack is only performed during and after the Golden Wolflord's shielded phase, not before.
* '''Elemental Devourer:''' Upon starting the shielded phase, the Golden Wolflord empowers itself &mdash; increasing its ATK by '''30%''', but decreasing its {{Color|Geo RES}} in the process.

==Strategy==
Ranged characters wielding a [[Bow]] or a [[Catalyst]] are especially valuable against the Golden Wolflord as it spends most of its time flying in the air, where melee characters struggle to reach. The only time it can be attacked by melee characters is after performing its tornado, laser beam or ramming attack; even then, the window is somewhat small.

Upon reaching ~66% of its health while flying, the Wolflord will generate a shield and deploy three blue Rifthound skulls around the arena. These skulls will periodically launch projectiles at the player. In order to destroy the Wolflord's shield, the player has to destroy these skulls. These skulls can be charged using any elemental attacks, but {{Geo}} is especially effective. As such, it is advisable to bring Geo characters who have easy access to elemental application.

Once fully charged, the skulls will launch themselves at the Golden Wolflord and damage its shield. When the last blue skull is destroyed, the Wolflord collapses in the middle of the arena for a significantly long amount of time. Quickly dispatch of it before it can recover.

During and after its shielded phase, the Golden Wolflord can utilize a devastating AoE attack that covers the majority of the arena. It is advisable to stay near the edge of the arena in order to evade it with relative ease.

==Beastly Rift==
{{Description|On an island on which no humans dwell, a golden king of beasts has commanded its pack of followers to pave the way through space for it.<br />One can only wonder: what dreams might be woven from the sharp claws and fangs of these hidden beasts? And what impulses drive them to invade this world?}}
