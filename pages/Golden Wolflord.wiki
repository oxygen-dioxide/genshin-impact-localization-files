{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Corrosion
|desc_1 = As with all Riftwolves, the Golden Wolflord is capable of inflicting stacks of [[Corrosion]] with its attacks.

|name_2 = Tornado
|desc_2 = The Golden Wolflord generates a massive tornado that moves around the arena, randomly and rapidly dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}. Repeated hits will have their DMG reduced according to its [[Damage Sequence]]. The Golden Wolflord will be stunned after this attack is used.

|name_3 = Laser Beam
|desc_3 = The Golden Wolflord fires a laser beam from its mouth, raking across the arena, randomly and rapidly dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} to players caught in the beam. Repeated hits will have their DMG reduced according to its [[Damage Sequence]].

|name_4 = Ramming Attack
|desc_4 = The Golden Wolflord rams the player with its mass, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} on hit. The Golden Wolflord will be stunned after this attack.

|name_5 = Skull Strike
|desc_5 = The Golden Wolflord sends its skulls to attack the player in sets of three, one at a time, each dealing '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} on impact.

|name_6 = Sweep
|desc_6 = Sweeps the surrounding area with its tail, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}.

|name_7 = Rifthound Skulls + Elemental Devourer
|desc_7 = Upon reaching '''70%''' HP, the Golden Wolflord enters the Elemental Devourer state and generates a shield, [[Vacuum Field|pushing]] nearby players away, and summoning 3 Rifthound Skulls to the edges of the arena that deal '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} on landing.<ref group="Note">Zach Aguilar calls these "Rifthound Alphas" in the [https://youtu.be/sgAvJlOL0Gg Version 2.3 Special Program]. The ''English (United States)'' closed captioning corrects this at ~23:14.<br>"It will summon *Rifthound Skulls to provide it with shields."</ref> Until it is defeated, the Golden Wolflord will gain '''30%''' increased ATK, but will also possess '''45%''' less {{Color|Geo RES}}. When the Golden Wolflord is protected by a shield, it is fully immune to damage, and the shield itself also cannot be damaged by normal means. The Rifthound Skulls will periodically shoot projectiles that home towards the player, dealing '''12.5% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on hit. Each Rifthound Skull can be fully charged by 3 [[Elemental Gauge Theory|gauges]] of {{Geo}} application (affected by [[Internal Cooldown|ICD]]), or 38 instances of non-Geo elemental DMG (unaffected by gauge units or ICD). Once at max charge, they will launch themselves towards the Golden Wolflord and cause the shield to lose '''1/3''' of its durability. Once its shield is destroyed, the Golden Wolflord will be stunned for an extended period of time. Upon waking up, it will deal '''10% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} to players close to it without applying Corrosion to them. This phase can be skipped if the Golden Wolflord is defeated before it can generate its shield.

|name_8 = Earthshaking Dive
|desc_8 = Flies up and dives into the ground with great force, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} in a massive area covering the majority of the arena. After it resurfaces, 9 massive explosions will follow that again cover the majority of the arena, each dealing '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}. This attack is only performed while the Wolflord is in the Elemental Devourer state.

==Strategy==
Ranged characters wielding a [[Bow]] or a [[Catalyst]] are especially valuable against the Golden Wolflord as it spends most of its time flying in the air, where melee characters struggle to reach. The only time it can be attacked by melee characters is after performing its tornado, laser beam or ramming attack; even then, the window is somewhat small.

Upon reaching 70% of its health while flying, the Wolflord will generate a shield and deploy three blue Rifthound skulls around the arena. These skulls will periodically launch projectiles at the player. In order to destroy the Wolflord's shield, the player has to destroy these skulls. These skulls can be charged using any elemental attacks, but {{Geo}} is especially effective. As such, it is advisable to bring Geo characters who have easy access to elemental application.

Once fully charged, the skulls will launch themselves at the Golden Wolflord and damage its shield. When the last blue skull is destroyed, the Wolflord collapses in the middle of the arena for a significantly long amount of time. Quickly dispatch of it before it can recover.

During and after its shielded phase, the Golden Wolflord can utilize a devastating AoE attack that covers the majority of the arena. It is advisable to stay near the edge of the arena in order to evade it with relative ease.
