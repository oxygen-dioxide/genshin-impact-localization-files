The '''Chasm Nail''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a large nail-like crystal in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]]. In the World Quest ''[[Wherefore Did the Spiritstone Descend?]]'', the [[Traveler]] purifies the large crystal to summon a [[Ruin Serpent|creature]] from the depths. A mysterious [[Yelan|woman]] shoots the nail to drop it to the ground to destroy the creature, impacting the platform below and changing the nail's elevation.

The design resembles that of the [[Skyfrost Nail]], suggesting that it may have destroyed the ancient civilization there like [[Sal Vindagnyr]].
