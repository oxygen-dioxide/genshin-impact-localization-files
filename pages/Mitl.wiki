{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to [[Muisa]] or [[Mitl]])
:'''Muisa:''' Hey, do you... believe in fate?
:'''Mitl:''' Wh&mdash;What do you mean by that?
:'''Muisa:''' I'm saying, you're here at the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]] to have your fortune told as well, right?
:'''Mitl:''' Oh, you mean that! Yeah, of course.
:'''Mitl:''' I'm planning to start farming on a new field near my place. There's two plots of land there that, to my eye, look the same, so I'm not sure...
:'''Muisa:''' Ah, planting, I see... I mean, you should be able to get something good either way.
:'''Mitl:''' *sigh* Now that you mention it...
:'''Mitl:''' But speaking of that, what sorta fortune are you trying to have told?
:'''Muisa:''' Flying practice. I've been training for a good long time &mdash; just wanna know when's the best take-off time for an easy pass!
:'''Mitl:''' Uh, don't you think that depends more on wind direction and your skill?
:'''Muisa:''' *sigh* Now that you mention it...
