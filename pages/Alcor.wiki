The '''''Alcor''''' is a warship anchored south of [[Guyun Stone Forest]]. It is the flagship of [[The Crux]] and, while it is normally helmed by Captain [[Beidou]], she has returned to [[Liyue Harbor]] for business and left the ship to her men.

Climbing aboard the ''Alcor'' for the first time automatically triggers the [[World Quest]] ''[[A Lone Ship In Guyun]]''. After visiting the Alcor for the first time, the map icon will appear, which acts as a permanent [[Teleport Waypoint]].

{{Description|The Alcor is the flagship of The Crux.<br />Under the direction of its leader, Beidou, it traverses the oceans and can even penetrate the tempestuous storms. When at rest, it is anchored at Guyun Stone Forest.|[[Map]] description}}

==Trivia==
* The name "''Alcor''" is derived from a {{w|Alcor (star)|star by the same name}}, which is one of the two stars that make up the handle of the {{w|Big Dipper}} constellation, tying into Beidou's name being the Chinese name for the Big Dipper.
** In [[Life on the High Seas]], Beidou mentions that the ''Alcor'' is considered an omen of death. In Japanese mythology, the Alcor is known as the lifespan star, or {{ja|寿命星|jumyouboshi}}, as it was believed that one who could not see this star would pass away by year's end.<ref>Wikipedia: {{w|Mizar and Alcor#Test of eyesight|Mizar and Alcor}}</ref> The Chinese name, {{zh|死兆星}}, means death omen.
