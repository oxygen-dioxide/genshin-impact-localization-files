==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing ''Canticles of Harmony''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Foscari:''' Oh, it's you, friend!
:{{DIcon}} And you are?
::'''Foscari:''' Ah, have you forgotten my name? Faustus of the Mercatores Exquisiti, on a mission from our merciful God King!
::'''Foscari:''' Thanks to you rescuing me, I was able to send the spices from the south here in time.
::'''Foscari:''' Ah, [[Remus|God King]] be praised! May his glory ever shine!
::{{DIcon}} Mercatores Exquisiti?
:::'''Foscari:''' That's right, my friend! We Mercatores Exquisiti are our God King's most loyal!
:::'''Foscari:''' And it was for this fealty that he gave us trade permits, allowing us to conduct business with nations beyond our high sea.
:::'''Foscari:''' Of course, that is not the full extent of our special privileges.
:::'''Foscari:''' We also have the right to bypass any Vicarius, and to make slaves free citizens. We even have the right to make contact with barbarians...
:::'''Foscari:''' As long as it aligns with the Golden Symphony's interests, any deed is permissible.
::{{DIcon}} What do you sell here?
:::'''Foscari:''' We mainly import rare goods from the southern nations, such as henna satin, spices, and even some [[Jinn]] devices...
:::'''Foscari:''' It is some manner of desert-folk spellcraft. More cunning and clever by far than those barbarian slaves.
:::'''Foscari:''' That said, I'm all out of my present batch of goods. Should you be interested, you can wait till the next shipment comes in.
:{{DIcon}} A route towards the south?
::'''Foscari:''' That's right. As long as you follow the aqueducts newly built by our God King, a ship can sail beneath the high sea and reach the desert to the south.
::'''Foscari:''' The previous trade route followed the northern border and was susceptible to barbarian harassment, the best efforts of our patrolling troops notwithstanding.
::'''Foscari:''' Ah, by the great Golden Symphony! With the new aqueduct, commercial activity is at last secure! This, surely, is a manifestation of our God King's boundless grace.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Foscari:''' Alright. Safe travels, friend.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''Canticles of Harmony''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Foscari:''' With new routes shall come new opportunities. I'm going to push for this, for sure!
:{{DIcon}} And you are?
::'''Foscari:''' Hello there, friend. I'm Foscari, assistant to [[Tiepolo|His Excellency the Doge]]. I'm preparing to construct a new navigation route. 
::{{DIcon}} New sea routes?
::'''Foscari:''' There are always people saying that we should consider everyone's happiness, that we shouldn't ruin the peace of our little town...
::'''Foscari:''' Hmph! They've just deluded themselves into thinking that they are happy. You won't find more idiotic people in the entire world!
::'''Foscari:''' The only reason they're so self-satisfied is that they've never seen the outside world at all. Those with a brain have long ceased to entertain such folly.
::'''Foscari:''' Everyone has the right to pursue their own happiness. Petrichor is not some ancient hamlet to be forgotten by all.
::'''Foscari:''' I wish to establish links with the [[Spina di Rosula]], cooperate with them &mdash; I want our town to become an important junction on shipping routes. That'll breathe new life into our home...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Foscari:''' See you. I hope you have a pleasant time. After all, I imagine a town with too many talkers and too few thinkers could be a bit much.
{{Dialogue End}} 

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* The name Foscari is a reference to the Venetian patrician family {{w|Foscari}}, powerful enough to get important offices granted, which explains the choice of naming the NPC assisting the Doge after them.
