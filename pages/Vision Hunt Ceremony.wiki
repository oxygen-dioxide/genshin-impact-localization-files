The '''Vision Hunt Ceremony''' was an event led by the [[Ei|Electro Archon]] during {{Quest|Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow}} to mark the 100th [[Vision]] taken under her [[Vision Hunt Decree]]. She intended to take [[Thoma]]'s [[Pyro]] Vision during the ceremony, but was interrupted by the [[Traveler]], who retrieved Thoma's Vision and escaped after a fight with the Shogun.

The events of this ceremony caused the [[Tenryou Commission]] to add the Traveler to their wanted list. After the ceremony, Thoma decided to hide in the [[Komore Teahouse]] and the Traveler joined the [[Watatsumi Army]].
