|description    = A building with an exceedingly ordinary appearance and the most common residential building in the [[Court of Fontaine]]. Its well-divided internal space can provide long-term accommodation for five to six single residents. Although its appearance is extremely plain, this building was actually one of the first to use the mature form of slag cement in its construction.<br>According to legend, the craftspeople of [[Fontaine]] attempted to promote Tearstone construction throughout Fontaine after the completion of the [[Opera Epiclese]]. Unfortunately, the extremely high costs that came with Tearstone were beyond the means of most Fontainians.<br>So, they found a project team at the Fontaine Research Institute and requested the development of a construction material with similar strength to Tearstone that would be affordable for the general public. The researchers traveled in search of inspiration and finally found it in the process of smelting. They set out to design a "stone" that solidifies from a liquid form, and after decades of trial and error, they finally invented a cheap and resource-efficient material &mdash; slag cement.
