The '''Aranyaka''' is a [[gadget]] that can be used to record the [[Traveler]]'s adventures with the [[Aranara]]. Despite its gadget categorization, it is found in the [[Quest Items|Quest]] section of the [[Inventory]], cannot be equipped, and is read like [[Books]].

It is obtained during the {{Quest|The World of Aranara}}.

===I: Woodland Encounter===
[[FIle:Aranyaka Forest Adventure Journal 1.png|200px|thumb|right]]
''This chapter is marked as completed after obtaining the [[Tattered Paper (Alphonso)|Tattered Paper]] at the end of the Hidden Exploration Objective [[The Bad Guy in Vimara Village]].''

Received this Aranyaka from [[Arama]]. I can jot down my recent adventures in the forest here.<br>
Though I'm curious as to what this "[[Traveler's Sibling|Nara Varuna]]" person once recorded in it, [[Araja]] says that those stories have been lost.

Might as well record some [[Aranara Language|Aranara terminology]] here.<br>
The [[Aranara]] refer to humans as "Nara," and add "Nara" to their names when addressing them. This may function on a similar principle to how the Aranara themselves are named (and their names are rather difficult), with an "Ara" prefix.<br>
"Mahavanaranapna" refers to the [[Vanarana (Subarea)|Vanarana]] as seen in dreams, while "[[Silapna]]" refers to the stone with runes on it.<br>
"Vanagni" refers to [[Whopperflower]]s. From how Arama behaved, Aranara may find these creatures to be very frightening. This may confirm, albeit obliquely, that the Aranara really are "plantlike."<br>
"Ararakalari" seems to refer to Aranara abilities.<br>
"Apshvaana" seems to mean [[Spinocrocodile]]s (not dogs).<br>
"Valuka" seems to mean sand or desert. With that noted,<br>
"Nara Valuka" could mean the desert folk or [[the Eremites]] in a figurative sense? (Speaking of which, the children of [[Vimara Village]] have also used the word "Valuka.")

I came to Vanarana to get a [[Bija]] for [[Rana]].<br>
Some other things have also been on my mind: Why did the children of Vimara Village go missing? What is the [[Fatui]]'s role in it? Perhaps I might find answers during this adventure.

Things will turn out fine now that I've obtained the Bija.<br>
Next, I need to get rid of the bad guys hidden in Vimara Village so that Rana and Arana can travel without needing to worry about anything.

[[The Bad Guy in Vimara Village|The problem has been solved.]]

===II: Dream Nursery===
[[FIle:Aranyaka Forest Adventure Journal 2.png|200px|thumb|right]]
''This chapter is marked as completed after completing the [[Aranyaka]] World Quest Series.''

Arama and I helped a few Aranara, which allowed me smooth access to the true Vanarana and allowed me to meet Araja.<br>
There are some things I must do first to obtain the [[Bija]].<br>
1. Organize [[Festival Utsava]].<br>
2. Look for and help a few Aranara in the forests. Some of them may be found in the following areas: [[Apam Woods]], [[Gandha Hill]], and [[Devantaka Mountain]].<br>
3. Obtain 3 [[Vasoma Fruit]]s from the [[Vasara Trees]] in [[Ashvattha's Concourse]]s.<br>
4. Find [[Arapacati]]'s brothers, who are doing culinary training. (Do Aranara understand the concepts of gender or family? Do they need to eat?)

After some twists and turns, I found Arapacati's brothers and the answers to my questions. Aranara do not have families or clans in the Nara sense, nor do they need to eat. They acquired these ideas from someone they met.<br>
Whatever the case, their culinary skills are not to be trusted.

I found the hidden songs alongside Arama, [[Arayasa]], [[Aradasa]], and [[Arasudraka]], and used the powers of these songs to obtain 3 Vasoma Fruits.<br>
I also learned about Aranara customs along the way.<br>
They seem to value songs and stories very much. For instance, "Song Gatherers," Aranara who collect songs, will even gather human songs. According to their legends, there exists a Sourcesong (the origin of all songs), and one can behold its true form by gathering every song in the world.

Following various adventures with the Aranara in the forests, I've now made ample preparations for Festival Utsava.

Rana is safe for now. I promised her that we would punish the bad guys in Vimara Village.<br>
I spent some wonderful time with the Aranara in Vanarana and received many flowers from them. I acquired some new knowledge &mdash; among them the realization that food that might be tasty by human standards may not necessarily be so if other species were to judge.<br>
Singing with Aranara is a unique experience.

Next, I shall set out to obtain the Bija.<br>
Arama weaved a garland with the flowers he gathered. It carries the blessings from Aranara and seems to be able to ward off nightmares. I hope that it will aid me in my adventures ahead.<br>
I did not obtain the Bija as planned due to the corrosion of the Ashvattha Tree by The Withering.<br>
Arama sounds very different now. Our next goal is to destroy Marana's Avatar and plant the new Ashvattha Tree.<br>
Thus, the Bija shall grow again.

Three seals have been cast upon Marana (four if the barrier of vines in the [[Fane of Ashvattha]] is also considered one).<br>
3 Inscriptions of Remembrance are needed to remove the first seal. They are listed below:<br>
1. May the new dreams never experience Marana's corruption, and may the old stories be forgotten alongside it.<br>
2. May the green fields and mountains never wither. May the streams stay clear and the flowers remain in bloom.<br>
3. Friends will stroll through the forest again. That which is good will return, and the painful memories will vanish. Just like a stream purifying itself or a withered tree sprouting once more.

I kept going and ran into some trouble at bottom of the tree hollow. But Arama helped me deal with it without too much of a fuss.<br>
Arama's memories may have been affected with the use of power. My current objective is to remove the seal in this area.<br>
It looks tike the seal contains the powers of many Aranara and that its key component is a Stone Lock.

After removing the seal, I moved on. Along the way, I ran into Ruin Graders that could continuously restore their energy. There were also many broken ruin machines.<br>
Considering the monsters we met and the time of the event, the cataclysm that happened here might have been even worse than Arama said.

The third seal has been removed.<br>
[[Marana's Avatar|The final enemy]] is up ahead.<br>
Hopefully, everything will be fine.

Everything is over.<br>
The forest will remember<br>
We shall meet in Sarva.

===III: Varuna Gatha===
[[FIle:Aranyaka Forest Adventure Journal 3.png|200px|thumb|right]]
''This chapter is marked as completed after completing the World Quest [[Giving Flowers]].''

I found [[Arapandu]] in the Apam Woods. According to him, the [[Varuna Contraption]] (a giant pillar of water?) has caused abnormal climate phenomena in this area.<br>
The name seems to indicate that the device is connected with the Nara Varuna that the other Aranara have mentioned.<br>
I then asked around at Festival Utsava and was told that the unknown Nara earned the name "Nara Varuna" for repairing the Varuna Contraption.

Although Arapandu spoke in a rather abstract fashion, I was able to surmise that several Aranara in the vicinity were also trying to repair the Varuna Contraption. I heard a few names and locations: [[Aranakula]] at the [[Yasna Monument]], [[Arabalika]] in the [[Ruins of Dahri]], and [[Arakunti]] in the [[Grove of Dreams]].<br>
I noticed another thing: The Varuna Contraption was seemingly designed to change the weather. As such, the device might have something to do with the forming of Sumeru's dense forests.

I found Aranakula, who mentioned the "Memory of Stone" (which refers to the monument erected by the Aranara).<br>
Aranakula is very afraid of the Fungi. To bring the frightened poor thing there, I might need to tap into my "[[Venti's New Plan|Lyre-Borrowing]]" experience from Mondstadt {{sic}}

Judging from the spores in the air, the presence of [[Fungi|fungal beasts]], and the mushrooms that have not yet &mdash; but are certainly ready to &mdash; pop out of the monument, the abnormal state of the Varuna Contraption might have something to do with fungal activity. The humid, ill-lit, and nutrient-rich environment makes an ideal habitat for Fungi.<br>
Fingers crossed that inhaling the spores won't cause any harm.

Arabalika seems to possess the power to defeat [[ruin machine]]s. Looks like the Aranara aren't all powerless after all.

What Arakunti says is always difficult to understand. This is perhaps due to his love of songs.<br>
After talking to Arayasa and the others, it is safe to say that most of the music-loving Aranara probably speak differently than their kin.

I've rendezvoused with Arapandu, Aranakula, Arabalika, and Arakunti.<br>
Next up, we should enter the giant pillar of water mentioned above. Looks like the "Varunastra" refers  to this pillar, and its control center is the "Varuna
Contraption."

My guess was right. The spores and Fungi are indeed the source of the problem. Having realized that, I then cleared the underground space of spores and defeated the Fungal Beast. It baffles me, however, that the beast managed to resist for so long. Perhaps that was also due to this peculiar environment?<br>
Either way, the Varuna Contraption has been repaired.<br>
Moreover. I learned the music that can modify the weather in this area by controlling the Varuna Contraption.

Aranakula said that he would look after the nursery after returning to Vanarana. I suppose we could visit him during down time later?

I found Aranakula in a well-hidden nursery. To grow the Viparyas, I should look for nurseries in the wilds.

(In reality) The nursery is teeming with Sweet Flowers. It seems that the full bloom of the Viparyas has somehow affected nurseries in the real world.<br>
With that in mind, it might be wise to consider dreams to be a part of Sumeru's ecosystem.

I met Varsha, who seems reluctant to return to where she used to live for some reason. So I brought her to the nursery of the Aranara.<br>
She seems very fond of this place. Perhaps she will make good friends with Aranakula and Arakara.

===IV: Agnihotra Sutra===
[[FIle:Aranyaka Forest Adventure Journal 4.png|200px|thumb|right]]
''This chapter is marked as completed after completing the Hidden Exploration Objective [[Khayyam's Final Words]].''

I met a group of mercenaries led by a woman named [[Lunja]] on [[Gandha Hill]]. They called themselves "the [[Farrokhzadan]]." Something felt off about them. It's best not to let my guard down. Later, I met [[Aranakin]] and agreed to help look for the [[Zohrah Mushroom]].

I obtained the Zohrah Mushroom together with Aranakin, but we were attacked by Lunja and her gang. To avoid repeating long-winded names, I reckon we should just call the "Zohrah Mushroom" "mushroom."<br>
Aranakin didn't like the mercenaries and called them "bad sand grains," but {{sic|I suppose turned out|expected = I suppose it turned out}} to be at least somewhat accurate after I got to know more about them.<br>
Anyway, I eventually obtained the "mushroom" &mdash; albeit after some twists and turns.<br>
I met an Aranara named [[Aragaru]] near [[Chatrakam Cave]].<br>
According to Aragaru, I will need to create [[Arahaoma]] to stop [[The Withering]]. To that end, I must seek out the [[Barsam Flower]]... which I have decided to call a "flower" for simplicity's sake.<br>
There is a humungous deal of fungal activity in the Chatrakam Cave &mdash; though I could probably have guessed that from the name.<br>
I got carried off by the current, but I did get the "flower" without any trouble.

I'm somewhat concerned about the idea that this "flower" can dream. If Aragaru speaks truly, then the waters were originally sustained by the power of dreams.<br>
It seems that this "Aranyaka" will indeed not take water damage easily.

The [["Kusava"|Kusava seed]] does indeed have mysterious abilities and has proved most useful in my adventures. Its only flaw is that these powers only work at specific times.<br>
(Does this have something to do with the [[Ley Lines]]? Or something to do with this "mushroom" and "flower" business? Judging from the hanging pool, these Fungi and plants may yet have powers that I do not understand.)

Apart from the "mushroom" and the "flower," the Arahaoma also requires "[[Yajna Grass]]" (which I am, again, shortening to "grass.") Next up, time to head to the [[Mawtiyima Forest]] and look for [[Aranaga]].

Aranaga mentioned "[[Mawtiyima]]" (the meaning of which is presently unclear), and I am following him to search for "grass." He mentioned that its meaning is "to fall away" &mdash; that is to say, a "death" that is also "fulfillment."<br>
I heard mention of "Jamikayomars." Is that some kind of place?

I met up with Aranakin, Aragaru and Aranaga at Jamikayomars, created the Arahaoma successfully, and received flowers as gifts from them.<br>
"The pomegranate sings, the apples clap!" Hmm, haven't I heard [[Amadhiah]] mention these lyrics before?

It seems that the making of this special medicine has something to do with Aranara memories. This worries me for some reason...

I have resolved the problem with Mawtiyima.

I met an old man named [[Khayyam]], who seems to have once been very close with the Aranara. I gave Aranaga the dried flower.

We met Aranakin by chance and became friends once again. Paimon appears to have grasped the Aranara vocabulary in some measure.<br>
I went to visit the home that Aranakin's now-forgotten friend used to use. According to the diary found within, there were once three friends: Irfan, Siman, and Khayyam.

I crossed paths with both the Farrokhzadan and Aragaru once more. Aragaru seemed to sense the flower that he gave me.<br>
I used certain means to figure out who hired these mercenaries. Their objective seems to be the capture of Aranara.<br>
I discovered a dried flower within the orders that the mercenaries were given by their employer.

Khayyam has also arrived at Jamikayomars.<br>
The shared memories of adventure shall not be utterly lost.

===V: Vimana Agama===
[[FIle:Aranyaka Forest Adventure Journal 5.png|200px|thumb|right]]
''This chapter is marked as completed after completing the World Quest [[Until Vana is Healed]].''

Arama mentions that there is an Aranara at Devantaka Mountain. They may know about the bad guys active in Vimara Village.

I met [[Ararycan]] at Devantaka Mountain. According to Ararycan, the nearby forest is "sick" (this seems to mean that it has been contaminated by something.)<br>
I'm not very sure just yet, but this sickness must have something to do with The Withering and its "dirty stuff."<br>
Whatever the case, I have agreed to help Ararycan cure the forest's "illness."

Ararycan seems to be able to hear (sense?) the voice of the forest.<br>
It seems that the Aranara have a very close relationship with the forest and forest life.

Something that concerns me more is how Ararycan mentioned that there is a suspicious person who looks like "Nara Marana" in the "sick" area. I wonder if this has anything to do with the people who wish Vimara Village ill.

...It seems that Ararycan misunderstood. The suspicious person is in fact [[Jazari]], a researcher from the [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]].<br>
It seems that I'll have to approach finding the villains from a different angle.<br>
The forest's sickness seems to have something to do with the core sealed beneath the earth. It seems that I must go to this underground ruin to figure this whole business with "sickness" and "Marana's Avatar" out.<br>
It is for this purpose that I must obtain the Amiti Device, which is the key to unlocking the Ruin Golem.

I spent a good sum of Mora purchasing a Ruin Guard's core...

I followed [[Royinjan]] to a "secret base" in Vimara Village to obtain the Amiti Device. The entrance here seems to have been sealed by [[Vamadha]] (some kind of green ball with lots of openings all over it?). Ararycan imparted a song with which the Vamadha can be controlled.<br>
This is said to have been the place where the children of Vimara Village used to play. However, Ararycan also seems to be very familiar with this place.<br>
A very long time ago (or so it appears), Ararycan used to play here with the children. However, it seems that Ararycan has forgotten all about this for some reason.

I heard Amadhiah tell the story of himself, Royinjan, the other children, and their many past adventures. It seems that the children of Vimara Village could see the Aranara &mdash; and that this trend started at least as early as Amadhiah's and Royinjan's time.<br>
I gave the dried flower that I got from Amadhiah to Ararycan.

I successfully completed the Amiti Device. Now then, it is finally time to enter the Ruin Golem.<br>
Yes, there were some accidents along the way, but I was still able to unlock and enter the underground ruins.

Hah! I knew that the [[Abyss Order]] was involved. The sickness that the forest suffered from was also due to their destruction of the seal over the core.<br>
I chased the Abyss Order members off. Though the matter of "Marana's Avatar" remains a mystery to me, the forest has been cured nonetheless.<br>
Ararycan mentions that he will wait for the forest to heal completely. I suppose we can go see him if there is time.

I met Ararycan once more. However, he did not seem very well.<br>
The Abyss Order appears to still covet the power of the core. If this problem is not solved, the forest will never be free of this illness.<br>
I heard from Ararycan that there is a certain Aranara named [[Aralohita]] who once traveled together with [[Pir Kavikavus]] (I've heard Jazari refer to this character as a "great researcher"). Perhaps Aralohita knows how to solve this problem.

Aralohita has left a riddle behind. I shall record it here. "Ran across it the day before yesterday, yesterday, and today..."<br>
However, the Aranara do not have the same sense of time that we do. Considering that, Aralohita must have known Pir Kavikavus for a very long time

I found the clues left by Aralohita.<br>
With Jazari's help, the core has been sealed for good.

===VI: Someone's Message===
''This chapter is unlocked and immediately marked as completed after completing the World Quest [[Static Views, Part 2]].''

...said too much to them, but I couldn't help it. Arapacati and Araji might have picked up a thing or two...

I hope that what I said won't cause trouble if they should meet one day.<br>
Come to think of it, it might be fun if my {{MC|brother|sister|mc=1}} meets...

...to be remembered as a Nara friend. But one day, things will eventually...

...escaped. I hope they won't hate me... But I know the Aranara well enough to understand they aren't capable of understanding hatred...

...When the time comes, I will have so many things to say to {{MC|him|her|mc=1}}. Just as the Aranara say, "We shall meet in Sarva."

I hope things can still be salvaged then.

(I stumbled upon this page as I wrote. It was not torn off like the rest were and has somehow survived the passage of time and rain. Perhaps these words were left behind by this notebook's former owner.)

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* Aranyaka {{Lang|{{w|Ap (water)|''Apam''}}|sa=अप्}} comes from the Sanskrit root word, aranya, meaning "forest." This is because they were intended as texts to be read and studied by ascetics, or rishis, who had retreated to the solitude of the forest to deepen their contemplation and meditative practices.
