==Dialogue==
...The good news is, we have found the campsite of the previous investigation party. There was no one there, though &mdash; I'd wager they've all become [[Wenut]] food, heh...<br>
...And the bad news is... we're also trapped here. We tried to use a new route to get deeper into this sand dune, but to no avail. We had to fall back before we lost our way for good...<br>
...The omnipresent pipes here resemble nothing so much like a net. It makes me shudder just to think about them...<br>
...Iqan refused to continue onward and started babbling nonsensically about [[Babel|Matriarch Babel]] wanting to become the [[Nabu Malikata|Goddess of Flowers]]' prophetess, thus needing to get rid of us adherents of [[King Deshret]]. We disposed of him, which has improved our food situation somewhat...<br>
...<br>
...This place is truly bizarre. It is our turn to be sacrifices to King Deshret...<br>
...Unlucky us. Guess we'll end up becoming Wenut food very soon...<br>
...You know what, Iqan had a point there. Babel definitely had something nasty in mind for us, sending us to this godforsaken place...<br>
...Perhaps we should pick up our weapons and fight our way back to [[Tanit]]...
