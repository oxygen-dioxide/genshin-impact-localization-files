==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Lambad:''' Hello, friend! What'll you be having today? If you can't decide, just order the [[Lambad Fish Roll]]!
:'''Lambad:''' The tableware in the tavern has just been replaced, too! They're all brand new! That will be sure to cheer you up!
:{{DIcon|Restaurant}} Can I see the menu?
::'''Lambad:''' Sure, here you go. It's all delicious, so have whatever you'd like!
:;(Opens the Lambad's Tavern Shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about yourself...
::'''Lambad:''' Yesterday I was a sailor, today I'm the owner of this tavern.
::'''Lambad:''' So, you'll be able to taste the chill of the ocean in my tavern's wine. And you won't find fresher seafood anywhere else!
::{{DIcon}} You built this tavern overnight? Impressive!
::'''Lambad:''' Hahahaha! You're making me blush.
::'''Lambad:''' I was exaggerating when I said that, but I wasn't kidding about being a great sailor in the past.
::'''Lambad:''' I've passed through vast thunderstorms more wrathful than the [[Raiden Shogun]], and I've pierced through glaciers steelier than the [[Tsaritsa]]'s heart.
::'''Lambad:''' But that was nothing...
::'''Lambad:''' ...Nothing compared to being able to return safely to [[Sumeru]] and open this lively tavern! Hahaha!
:{{DIcon}} About the Lambad Fish Roll...
::'''Lambad:''' It's a recipe I came up with on an adventure in my youth. The flavor of the finished product far exceeded my expectations, so I bestowed it with the great name of "Lambad"!
::'''Lambad:''' When I was traveling around then, I had delicious grilled fish in [[Mondstadt]], [[Liyue]], and [[Inazuma]]. So, it got me thinking that the aroma of grilled fish in the air was just what Sumeru needed, too!
::'''Lambad:''' And that's how my famous Lambad Fish Roll was born. And it's not just grilled fish &mdash; I combined it with Sumeru's specialty pitas to create a fish roll that can be eaten with ease, even on the choppiest of seas.
::'''Lambad:''' Such a genius invention is naturally worthy of the resounding name of "Lambad."
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Is this for sampling?
::'''Lambad:''' Of course! The fish was fresh from the water and the pitas just popped out of the oven. Here. Be careful, it's hot!
:;(Obtain [[Delicious Lambad Fish Roll]] ×3)
:{{DIcon}} New tableware?
::'''Lambad:''' Yep, there was some small accident in the tavern a few days ago, so the original tableware can't be used anymore.
::'''Lambad:''' It turned out to be a blessing in disguise. The tableware we have now is made by craftspeople commissioned by {{Rubi|Kshahrewar|Technology}} researchers, with the patterns designed by {{Rubi|Haravatat|Semiotics}} researchers.
::'''Lambad:''' There is no other establishment in Sumeru City with such a luxurious setup.
::'''Lambad:''' So you see, little accidents in life aren't necessarily all bad, hahaha!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Lambad:''' Come back any time!
