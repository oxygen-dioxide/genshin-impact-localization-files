{{Lang|'''Futsu Hiroyoshi'''|ja=経津弘芳|ja_rm=Futsu Hiroyoshi}} was a historical figure in [[Inazuma]] and the fourth-generation master of the [[Futsu School]], one of the five swordsmithing schools in the [[Raiden Gokaden]].

==Profile==
Despite being the fourth-generation master of the Futsu School, Hiroyoshi's skill never reached the height of his mother, [[Futsu Minori]]'s, or his sworn brother, [[Futsu Masayoshi]]'s. This nearly led to a succession crisis after Minori's death, as Masayoshi had reforged her famous blade and created [[Haran Geppaku Futsu]]. To avoid this, Masayoshi taught Hiroyoshi his mother's techniques and, once Hiroyoshi could support the school on his own, left the Futsu School.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Haran Geppaku Futsu}}</ref>
