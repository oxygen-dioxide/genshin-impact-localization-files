;(Start the event)
:'''Kirara:''' Oh, Traveler! I didn't expect you to be the one to receive my commission &mdash; this is amazing! So basically, Komaniya Express has recently set up temporary locations elsewhere to expand our business, and as a result, our orders have gone through the roof. I'm absolutely swamped!
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, so business must be going pretty well for your company!
:'''Kirara:''' Hehe! Well, I'm just a bit worried that some of our packages might be delayed, which will affect our customers. Traveler, could you help deliver these packages?
:'''Paimon:''' No problem. Leave it to us!
:'''Traveler:''' We'll make sure everyone's packages get delivered on time.
