==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Amenoma Tougo:''' Hello.
:'''Amenoma Tougo:''' About forging commissions, I've left those to my apprentice [[Hajime]]. Go talk to him about any such matters.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me more about Amenoma Smithy.
::'''Amenoma Tougo:''' [[Amenoma Smithy]] is a place for Amenoma Art followers to forge, smelt, and sell weapons.
::'''Amenoma Tougo:''' ...
::'''Amenoma Tougo:''' Is there anything else I can help you with?
::{{DIcon}} Tell me more about the Amenoma Art...
::'''Amenoma Tougo:''' Among the swordsmiths in Inazuma, some speak of the [[Raiden Gokaden]].
::'''Amenoma Tougo:''' It is said that in ancient times, a ronin passed the process of forging down to five of his disciples. Each of the five different techniques has its own secrets.
::'''Amenoma Tougo:''' Amenoma Art is one of them.
::{{DIcon}} Can I ask about swords and blades in Inazuma?
:::'''Amenoma Tougo:''' Oh, are you also interested in the Inazuman weapons? Seems like you're something of a master of the sword yourself.
:::'''Amenoma Tougo:''' We Inazuman artisans use a special material called [[Jade Steel]], which is produced from [[Tatarasuna]], when forging weapons. It makes the sword tougher and sharper. That's the reason why Inazuman weapons are some of the best in the world.
:::'''Amenoma Tougo:''' Naturally, we have also inherited the techniques of forging weapons using Jade Steel. The key to that is using our perseverance to bring out the strength of the steel.
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} The blades aren't exactly the same as the ones in Liyue.
:::'''Amenoma Tougo:''' Yeah, the materials and methods used to forge the weapons aren't the same, so the resulting weapons would be of a different style as well.
:::'''Amenoma Tougo:''' I heard that Liyue's Archon, [[Rex Lapis]], was skilled at the forging of weapons. Previously, I was curious about what the blades made in Liyue were like.
:::'''Amenoma Tougo:''' So a while ago, I requested someone from the [[Crux Fleet]] to bring a weapon made in Liyue to me. I learned a lot after studying that weapon.
:::'''Amenoma Tougo:''' Now, I have fully grasped the techniques that were used to forge that weapon. Seeing as you have deep connections with Liyue, I'll gift this weapon to you.
::;(Obtain 3{{star}} [[Fillet Blade]] ×1)
::{{DIcon}} Got any tricks of the trade to share?
:::'''Amenoma Tougo:''' If you want to learn about some special forging trick, then you've come to the wrong place.
:::'''Amenoma Tougo:''' Amenoma Art is different from the others. We don't have any secret forging tricks to offer. The only thing we can tell you is that you will need patience and the willpower to give everything you have.
:::'''Amenoma Tougo:''' Everyone who visits Amenoma Smithy has witnessed our skill in forging weapons. However, only very few have enough perseverance to carry on the spirit of the Amenoma Art.
:::'''Amenoma Tougo:''' Only by creating a superior piece of work with relentless persistence and patience can you inherit the Amenoma name.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Amenoma Tougo:''' Farewell. Weapons can be dangerous. Take care of yourself on the journey.
