|description     = Pickled vegetables.
|desc_suspicious = That's what they say, obviously, but the result should probably not have such a sour smell. The tender texture is good and all, yes, but... Yeah, this is just way too sour. Maybe a Samachurl might appreciate this?
|desc_basic      = A round of fermentation makes food richer and also allows it to keep for longer. There were originally only four "treasures," but for auspiciousness' sake, the four vegetables were mixed and plated up with one additional "treasure" added in, hence the name "Five Pickled Treasures."
|desc_delicious  = The fermentation process has added a layer of flavor to the natural sweetness of the ingredients. The crispy texture is a real highlight, and it spices up rice and wine alike exceptionally. A treasure indeed!
