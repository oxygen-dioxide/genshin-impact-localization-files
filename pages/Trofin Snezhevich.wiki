'''Trofin Snezhevich''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] in [[Vimara Village]], [[Sumeru]]. Before completing the [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] ''[[The Bad Guy in Vimara Village]]'', he goes by the name '''Alphonso'''.

He plays a minor role in the first act of the ''[[Aranyaka]]'' World Quest series.

His dialogue changes with the player's progress through ''Aranyaka''.

After completing ''The Bad Guy in Vimara Village'', he either leaves Vimara Village permanently or dies upon the completion of the Hidden Exploration Objective.

==Profile==
Trofin Snezhevich was an orphan taken in by the [[House of the Hearth]], raised to become an agent of the [[Fatui]]. After growing up, he was deemed as "having potential" and was sent to Vimara Village, where he was tasked by the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers|Harbinger]] "[[Il Dottore]]" to capture an [[Aranara]], which could only be seen by children.<ref name="Bad Guy">{{Ref/HEO|The Bad Guy in Vimara Village}}</ref>

For his mission, he adopted the name "Alphonso," claiming to be an apprentice from [[Fontaine]]. He lived in Vimara Village for several years and became close to the Forest Ranger [[Rana]] and the children [[Iotham]], [[Sudabeh]], and [[Kavus]]. However, he grappled with the guilt of having to forsake his Vimara Village "family" for the Fatui's goals, as he was unable to forsake his duty or his ties to his House of the Hearth "family." To lure the Aranara out, Trofin helped the Fatui kidnap the children by tricking them into going into the forest alone. However, the Aranara were capable of rescuing the children from under the Fatui's noses, while wiping the children's memories of their capture and rescue to prevent them from becoming accustomed to violence.<ref name="Bad Guy" />

Trofin is implied to have also kidnapped [[Varsha]], an orphaned girl who had run away from [[Gandharva Ville]]. An Aranara rescued her as well, but deposited her in a cave sealed by a [[Claustroflora]] and did not wipe her memories of the incident like [[Arana]] had with the Vimara Village children.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Giving Flowers}}</ref>

As part of the intelligence he received from the Fatui, Trofin learned about the [[Traveler]], including their name. This detail &mdash; which is something Rana had not mentioned in front of him &mdash; is eventually what leads the Traveler to conclude that he is the "bad guy" hiding in the village, and they can choose to confront him over his involvement in the children's disappearances. During the confrontation, the player may choose to spare or kill him.<ref name="Bad Guy" />

If spared, he agrees to leave; never to return to either Vimara Village or the Fatui, since he had shamed his former "family" on his failure and discovery. His [[Tattered Paper (Alphonso)|Tattered Paper]] can be found abandoned in [[Old Vanarana]], suggesting he may have died there. If the player chooses to kill him, he puts up a fight despite knowing that he would most certainly lose, and his last words are dedicated to Iotham. His Tattered Paper is automatically obtained on his death.

::'''Alphonso:''' [[Kavus]], [[Sudabeh]], and [[Iotham]] are very good kids. They are so full of energy.
