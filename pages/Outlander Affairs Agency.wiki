{{Location Intro|The '''Outlander Affairs Agency'''|description=<p>As its name implies, it is the agency run by the [[Kanjou Commission]] for handling documents and requests from non-Inazuman visitors.</p><!--

--><p>Because the [[Sakoku Decree]] has left outsiders stranded on Ritou, the Kanjou Commission has taken advantage of the situation to fleece people out of their money. For example, [[Yurika]] initially charged the [[Traveler]] 2 million [[Mora]] for entrance, and although [[Thoma]] was able to negotiate it down to 600, he says that this is a common practice within the agency. There is little that outlanders can do about it due to their social and economic position.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Confessions of an Outlander}}</ref></p>}}

==NPCs==
