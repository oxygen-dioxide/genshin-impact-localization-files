===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing ''The Case of the Crafting Bench''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Pampa:''' Is it worth getting that angry over? Honestly...
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
::'''Pampa:''' *sigh* You'll really listen? That means a lot. Our little group broke up, you know? And it'd actually been a while, but then suddenly an old friend came knocking...
::'''Pampa:''' Why else would someone suddenly connect out of the blue, unless they needed to borrow some money? Anyway, since we were once pretty tight buds, I gotta lend him at least a little, yeah? But oh no, this guy, not only did he not say thanks, he even told me off for not giving him enough!
::'''Pampa:''' He even said something about how after the Hawkwings won back their rightful place he'd give me back double, blah blah.... *sigh* Not sure if he's just pigheaded or... Anyway, I'm an adult and generous to boot, so I decided to help as much as I could.
::'''Pampa:''' I practically wanna give myself a medal!
:{{DIcon}} Sorry for disturbing you.
::'''Pampa:''' Huh? Leaving already, just like that? Alrighty, then...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''The Case of the Crafting Bench''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Pampa:''' Yo, you've got time to come here?
:{{DIcon}} Do we know you?
::'''Pampa:''' We've met, we've talked, so we're friends! Besides, weren't we on the same side during that thing? Don't say you've forgotten already!
::{{DIcon}} I'm on my own side.
::'''Pampa:''' *sigh* Fine, you're right, you're right. I heard even Mr. Tenehua really admires you. Being your friend is a great honor!
:{{DIcon}} I should get going.
::'''Pampa:''' Don't let me keep you!
