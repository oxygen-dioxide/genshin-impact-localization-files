'''A Glimpse Into Arcanum''' is [[Qiqi]]'s [[4th Ascension Passive]].

==Gameplay Notes==
*The attack hit that applies the mark does not trigger the healing.
*The healing rules follow [[Adeptus Art: Preserver of Fortune]].
<!--**Overwritten by the burst duration if applied together.
** PENDING TEST: If burst applied first and duration left is lower than 6 seconds left, the passive will be used and prolong the talisman duration to 6 seconds. Otherwise, the passive is not used.
ALT: May also still used and just wasted.-->
*As with Adeptus Art: Preserver of Fortune, duration is extended by hitlag. But cooldown appears to be also extended as well:
**If Qiqi applies talisman and stops attacking, a new one can be applied almost as soon as 30s have passed.
**If Qiqi keeps attacking after the application and is affected by hitlag, the cooldown is extended and next talisman may appear as late as 40s after the previous one if she attacks for this whole time while waiting for cooldown.

==Trivia==
*In Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the name of this talent mentions a jade slip {{Lang|zh=玉签|zh_rm=yùqiān}}, which is likely a reference to the classic Taoist book "[[wikisource:zh:玉匣記|Jade Box Records {{Lang|zh=玉匣记|zh_rm=Yùxiá Jì}}]]." The book consists of an exhaustive list of auspicious dates, and is commonly used in Chinese folk divination in order to avoid misfortune or disaster while planning important life events.
**This jade slip is also mentioned in one of [[Qiqi/Voice-Overs/Chinese#Elemental Burst|Qiqi's Elemental Burst Voice-Overs]]: "Jade slip, Box-Opening Adepti Arts {{Lang|zh=玉签，仙法开匣|zh_rm=Yùqiān, Xiānfǎ Kāi Xiá}}."
