==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available prior to completing ''[[Masquerade of the Guilty]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Moniotte:''' I wonder where I might purchase an ornament similar to Lady Furina's watch...?
:{{DIcon}} What sort of watch is that?
::'''Moniotte:''' The famous Lady of the Lake's Tear, of course!
::'''Moniotte:''' It's exquisite and small enough to be set upon a ring. That is why it was given that name by Lady Furina herself.
::'''Moniotte:''' As her most ardent follower, perhaps I might shorten the distance between myself and my god by finding an accessory as much like it as possible.
::'''Moniotte:''' Ah, our beautiful Hydro Archon... her superb makeup, her gentle voice, her agile dance steps... Are they not worthy of a greater, more luxurious stage...?
:{{DIcon}} I'm not very sure where you'd find one...
::'''Moniotte:''' Not to worry. This was never going to be easy anyway &mdash; but I shall not give up!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''[["The Little Oceanid"]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Moniotte:''' Have you heard? Lady Furina performed again! It's wonderful... I thought I'd never get the chance to see my beloved Archon again...
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about Lady Furina...
::'''Moniotte:''' Although many have stopped referring to her as a deity, to me, Lady Furina will always be divine whenever she takes the stage.
::'''Moniotte:''' Oh, when I heard that Lady Furina was to leave the opera house forever, I was so sad I shut myself away and never wanted to leave the house again...
::'''Moniotte:''' But I knew that she, who will always be divine in my heart, would not be defeated by such a trivial setback! Ah, our beautiful Lady Furina... I can finally see you on the stage once more!
::'''Moniotte:''' Her superb makeup, her gentle voice, her agile dance steps... Are they not worthy of a greater, more luxurious stage...?
:{{DIcon}} I'm happy for you.
::'''Moniotte:''' No, be happy for Lady Furina! And do not fail to support her new undertaking!
