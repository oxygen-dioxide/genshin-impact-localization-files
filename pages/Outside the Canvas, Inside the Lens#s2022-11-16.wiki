|"The author is writing a novel about a strange disease."<br /><!--
-->"The protagonist, though afflicted with the disease, has also gained a peculiar power as a result..."<br /><!--
-->"Later on, he will embark on a journey to battle the illness, and along the way, the man will defeat countless enemies with the power bestowed upon him. In the end, he manages to cure himself and bring down the villain behind all the schemes."<br /><!--
-->"I've heard that the author used to be a doctor, which explains their elaborate description of the symptoms."<br /><!--
-->"But to be honest, the novel is so authentic &mdash; unnervingly realistic if I do so say."

'''Completed'''<br />
"Is this Gandharva Ville? Mmm, it's a bit different from what I've imagined..."<br /><!--

|"Do you remember Luhua Pool near Liyue Harbor? It's the place with two giant statues."<br /><!--
-->"An author wanted to write an absurdist novel based on them."<br /><!--
-->"I remember parts of the plot &mdash; the two statues each had only one eye on their heads. These eyes could not be seen clearly while in their vicinity, but could be observed from far away."<br /><!--
-->"Upon hearing this tale, a painter went to Luhua Pool to sketch them."<br /><!--
-->"But after he finished the work, he started having eerie nightmares."<br /><!--
-->"In those dreams, he kneels in front of the statues, carving something onto gemstone..."<br /><!--
-->"Whoa, stop it... You're giving me goosebumps..."
----
'''Completed'''<br />
"The two statues are so huge! Just as I expected!"<br /><!--
-->"This place should be the eye of the statue, right?"<br /><!--
-->"Oh, wait. You could also consider what I'm doing 'sketching the statues,' couldn't you?"<br /><!--
-->"Haha... Hahaha... It's okay. There's nothing to fear."<br />"It's just a novel. It's pure fiction... Yeah, that's all it is..."

|"Although the author only asked me to draw something about ports..."<br /><!--
-->"The novel seems to be about fleets and stuff. The author said the inspiration comes from caravans sailing across the oceans, and the story features a scholar with business acumen. That's why the first few chapters are set in Sumeru."<br /><!--
-->"*sigh* What's the best way to convey the story with my illustration?"
----
'''Completed'''<br />
"Wow, this port is so lively! How I wish I could go there myself."<br /><!--
-->"Hmph, I'll definitely go on a journey together with Miss Moriko once I feel better."

|"Wow! This author's a famous folklore novelist. He's created many stories based on Inazuma's folktales."<br /><!--
-->"While other authors have been trying new themes and styles lately, he still gathers inspiration the old way and sticks to the most traditional writing methods."<br /><!--
-->"But Mr. Kuroda says that his novels' sales numbers have been going down. I wonder if people have lost interest in traditional novels, or if other stories are just way more attractive..."<br /><!--
-->"His novel this time tells a story of people who have been spirited away. I heard that he's added quite a lot of popular elements, too. For instance, his protagonists are teenage students, and the villains are based on monsters from Inazuman myths. He's even given the book a long-winded name, too..."<br /><!--
-->"Anyway, I do hope his novel becomes a huge hit."

'''Completed'''<br />
"Nice angle here! And the composition and the colors of this photo are good, too..."<br /><!--

|"This author suddenly announced that they'll be publishing a new work."<br /><!--
-->"Now, it might just be me, but I'm sure this series concluded several times already... so why is it still being updated?"<br /><!--
-->"And the new volume even contains factions and characters that were never mentioned in the previous trilogy, too!"<br /><!--
-->"But then again, should we really be surprised, considering how long this light novel has been around? Perhaps this author's ability to churn out new plots truly is far beyond that of the average mortal..."
----
'''Completed'''<br />
"Anyway, since there will be new factions and new characters, the series is not going to end soon."<br /><!--

'''Completed'''<br />
"So, what's a mushroom's daily life like?"<br /><!--

-->"It's rich in detail, and the author has done solid research."<br /><!--
-->"It's a good piece of work indeed, but not one that sells, because no one would read it."<br /><!--
-->"That's why the editor came to us for help."<br /><!--
