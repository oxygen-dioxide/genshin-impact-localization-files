{{Location Intro|description=<p>It is a forest made of enormous fluorescent mushrooms.</p><p>Mawtiyima is described as "an energy form created by the ancient dreams and memories of the forest." This energy fights against [[The Withering]] to ensure the health of the forest, and even seems to be able to communicate with the [[Aranara]]. In an ancient tongue, the name once meant "human death."<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Mawtiyima}}</ref></p>}}

;(Enter Mawtiyima Forest)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? The grass here... is glowing...
:'''Paimon:''' It almost feels as if this place is aware of our arrival.

;(Approach a [[Poisonous Mushroom]] surrounded by 3 [[Pyro Slime]]s)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, it's one of those strange plants again. Why are those Pyro Slimes gathering around it?
;(Defeat enemies after activating the mechanism)
:'''Paimon:''' Great! The drawing lit up! It seems to be pointing at a certain direction...
