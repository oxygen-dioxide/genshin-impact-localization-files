'''Waverider Waypoints''' are structures found scattered across the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]], [[Inazuma]], and [[Sumeru]].

Each of the four Golden Apple islands has one [[Teleport Waypoint]] and a corresponding Waverider Waypoint. See the '''[https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/5?shown_types=190 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for locations.

==Description==
The Waverider Waypoints themselves only have one known purpose. They can be activated to summon the [[Waverider]] to the player's location. The structure itself resembles a [[Symbols in Teyvat|Four-Pointed Star]] surrounded by a wheel. Much like [[Teleport Waypoints]], the Waverider Waypoints glow red when unactivated and blue when activated.

Since they can't be used for teleportation, and the player needs to be close to them to use them, whether they are activated or not makes no functional difference whatsoever, other than the [[Primogem]]s awarded on their activation.

Waverider Waypoints can't be activated when they are too far from water.

==World Map Description==

===Temporary Guyun Stone Forest Waypoints===
Four temporary Waverider Waypoints were placed in [[Guyun Stone Forest]] during the [[Fleeting Colors in Flight]] [[event]]. Their descriptions read the following:
{{Description|Waverider Waypoints have been set up in an ad-hoc manner to help [[Beidou]] with her salvaging of flotsam from the [[Jade Chamber]]. These devices have almost exactly the same capabilities as ordinary ones. The only difference is that they have a limit to the duration they can {{sic|remain operation}}...<br />These mysterious devices are typically located near the water.<br />They can be used to summon a Waverider to your side. It can be regarded, from a certain point of view, as a "Teleport Waypoint for Waveriders only"...<br />Only available during the Fleeting Colors in Flight event.}}
