{{Description|The nation of oaths situated in the western regions of Teyvat.<br>Guided by the flame, you pass through lengthy gorges and valleys to reach the land where the torches blaze, where all fires converge. Upon the blazing fields where Saurians roam, witness the end of the ancient war alongside the valiant warriors who resist the darkness.|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Genshin Impact Official Website]}}
'''Natlan''' is one of the seven regions of [[Teyvat]]. It is the nation led by [[Mavuika]], the [[Pyro Archon]] and God of War.

[[Archon Quest]] [[Chapter V]] takes place in this region.

==Description==
{{Description|The warriors of the mountains lead the path unto flowers splendorous, and the swimming Saurians of the springs bring news all night. On the far shore from sand and sea, the blazing epic hymn echoes through the land where the Sacred Flame blazes eternal.<br>Beyond the fiery altars and the mysterious realm of night, an unprecedented adventure is about to unfold in the land where humans and Saurians dwell together.|Land of Vibrant Stone and Flaming Springs: New Area Unlocked}}
Natlan is located beyond the west side of [[Sumeru]]'s desert region, the [[Great Red Sand]], from the [[Desert of Hadramaveth]]. It is also home to natural hot springs created from volcanic activity.<ref name="Mikawa Akane">{{Ref/NPC|Mikawa Akane}}</ref><ref name="Aikawa Susumu">{{Ref/NPC|Aikawa Susumu}}</ref> Its people are grouped into six tribes, all of whom are united behind the [[Pyro Archon]] against the [[Abyss]]. People in Natlan live alongside [[dragon]]s known as [[saurian]]s, descendants of Natlan's ancient dragons who come in many shapes and sizes.

According to [[Ranjit]], people in Natlan have a lot of reservations about leaving their homeland, but he doesn't feel comfortable talking about it as a foreigner. He does not believe it is due to a fear of unfamiliar environments.<ref name=":02">{{Ref/NPC|Ranjit}}</ref> On this, [[Mavuika]] clarifies that the reason is due to the people's survival being tied with the [[Wayob]] against the [[Abyss]]; even if left with no choice, those departing Natlan must seek their tribal chief's approval with the Wayob in order to grant them leave.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|page=Past and Future|quote=
'''Mavuika:''' Ah, that also comes down to the longstanding effects of the Abyss. Our people's survival is inextricably tied to the Wayob.<br>'''Mavuika:''' But, their power has its limits. They cannot offer our people the same degree of protection outside our borders. In fact, people who do decide to leave often suffer from memory loss and emotional issues.<br>'''Mavuika:''' Everyone in Natlan understands this. That's why our people never leave without a good cause. Even if someone is left with no choice, the chief of their tribe must seek approval with the Wayob to grant them leave.<br>'''Mavuika:''' The Wayob have always been very strict about granting that approval, since extending protection beyond our borders means consuming power reserved for our fight against the Abyss.}}</ref> After the Abyss was purged from the Night Kingdom, the rule no longer applies and Natlanese are able to leave the nation as they wish without consequences. Though [[Mualani]] mentions that one still needs to ask their chief for permission, this is likely more of a fresh formality stemming from when it was a necessity and may fade away as the years go by.

==Notable Features==
Natlan features many unique mechanics and environmental hazards:

===Saurian Indwelling===
When approaching a Spiritsconce or adult Saurian enemies, the player can tap a button to temporarily "[[Saurian Indwelling|indwell]]" a Saurian. This allows the player to use the Saurian's special abilities which are useful for interacting with various exploration mechanics in Natlan. These abilities can also be performed by using the [[Elemental Skill]]s of playable characters from the Saurian's associated tribe. Trainers found throughout Natlan can conduct [[Warrior's Challenge]]s to test the player's skills in using these abilities.

The Saurians and their associated tribes are listed below, with their corresponding abilities:

* [[Koholasaur]]/[[People of the Springs]]
** Swim rapidly in water or [[Liquid Phlogiston]] without harm
** Perform high leaps at [[Jet-Set Eddies]]
** Ride [[Spiritway]]s
** Collect [[Tutorial/Phlogiston Engravings and Unveiling Scripts|Unveiling Scripts]]
* [[Tepetlisaur]]/[[Children of Echoes]]
** Move along most surfaces while burrowing
** Discover certain buried objects
** Ascend Phlogiston crystals
** Enter [[Molten Fissure]]s
* [[Yumkasaur]]/[[Scions of the Canopy]]
** Grab and shoot [[Relay Ball]]s, [[Coagulation Pearl]]s, [[Flamegranate]]s, or [[Phlogiston Explosive Barrel]]s (the latter two causing explosions that can damage enemies or destroy certain objects such as [[Tutorial/Cracked rocks...|cracked rocks]])
** Grapple objects and [[Coilgrass Sigil]]s
** Pull [[Tutorial/Removable grappling hooks|grappling hooks]]
* [[Qucusaur]]s/[[Flower-Feather Clan]]
** Fly and glide in the air (consuming Phlogiston to climb higher or fly faster)
** Fly through [[Tutorial/Recon Rings and Recon Targets|Recon Rings]] and attack [[Tutorial/Recon Rings and Recon Targets|Recon Targets]] to restore Phlogiston
** Unharmed by [[Gaseous Phlogiston]] and can ride [[Gaseous Phlogiston#Tutorial|Phlogiston Wind Tunnels]]
** Gain max Phlogiston and consume no Phlogiston for a short time by touching a [[Gaseous Phlogiston#Tutorial|Scorchwind Conflux]]
* [[Iktomisaur]]/[[Masters of the Night-Wind]]
** Use a special form of [[Elemental Sight]] to see invisible objects and highlight objects that can be activated with their elemental skill
** Enter the Spiritseeker State absorb phlogiston from objects remotely or activate effects from [[Ancient Inscribed Ring]]s, [[Nightspirit Graffiti]], [[Nightspirit Sigil]]s, or [[Phlogiston Engraving]]s
** Leap high in the air and float down slowly
** Use their ability in mid-air, momentarily suspending their fall
* [[Tatankasaur]]s/[[Collective of Plenty]]
** Stomp to collapse [[Geothermal Vent]]s, triggering various effects
** Consume Phlogiston to sprint at a normal speed
** Enter Spirited state to charge at a faster speed by passing through a [[Ring of Speed]] or tapping the skill button when hitting an obstacle during the regular sprint, then sprinting again (remaining abilities below require Spirited state)
** Run over water or Liquid Phlogiston
** Perform flying leaps
** Destroy [[Pulverite]] and volcanic boulders
** Shut down [[Secret Source Dragon Cannon]]s
** Stop Matador [[Monetoo]]

[[Mavuika]] has a combination of special abilities from multiple tribes, including driving over water or Liquid Phlogiston, riding Spiritways, entering Molten Fissures, gliding, and immunity to Gaseous Phlogiston.

===Monetoo===
[[Monetoo]] are similar to [[Seelie]]s: following them back to ancient graffiti earns a reward. Aside from regular Monetoo, there are three variants:

* Hued Monetoo can be tossed onto [[Tutorial/Painted Stones|Painted Stones]] or special graffiti to change their color. They come in red, yellow, and blue colors, and any two of them can be mixed to produce new colors. Unlike other Monetoo, they are not lead back to ancient graffiti.
* Naughty Monetoo run away from the player rather than return to the ancient graffiti. Generating a [[Wind Current]] under one causes it to be lifted into the air, after which the player can interact with it to capture it. It will then turn into a normal Monetoo.
* Matador Monetoo taunt nearby Tatankasauri with their capes, and put up a shield when the player comes near. Repeatedly bashing them with a Tatankasaur in Spirited state will overcome the shield and force them back to the ancient graffiti, though they still taunt the player. One more attack with a Tatankasaur will trigger the reward.

===Nightsoul Abilities===
* Natlanese characters can enter the [[Nightsoul's Blessing]] state by using their [[Elemental Skill]]s, which increases their movement and combat abilities. Using these abilities consumes Nightsoul Points; once they are exhausted, [[Phlogiston]] is used instead. The abilities of indwelled [[Saurian]]s behave in a similar fashion, as mentioned above.
** [[Void Ward]]s act as shields that protect enemies until it is destroyed by [[Element]]al attacks. Attacks delivered while in the Nightsoul's Blessing state are particularly effective. [[Cocouik]]'s [[Tutorial/"Cocouik"'s Rings of Light|Rings of Light]] also rapidly deplete Void Wards.
* Having a Natlanese character in the player's party causes a [[Nightsoul Burst]] to be triggered when any character in the party deals [[Element]]al [[DMG]] to an [[enemy]]. Nightsoul Bursts may enhance character abilities through certain [[Talent]]s or [[Artifact]]s.
* Within Natlan, during certain movement modes (sprinting, climbing, swimming, jumping), the player can seamlessly switch to another Natlanese character without having to exit the movement mode in question. This technique is called Nightsoul Transmission. The availability of this Nightsoul Transmission ability is indicated by the character's on-screen avatar lighting up.

===Phlogiston===
[[Phlogiston]] is an advanced form of {{Pyro}} unique to Natlan. It can be collected by a variety of means throughout the nation, and can be used to power Nightsoul's Blessing and Saurian abilities. The amount of Phlogiston the player has available is displayed as a meter above the [[HP]] meter. Certain devices require the expenditure of Phlogiston to activate.

Phlogiston is also found in various forms in the world:

* [[Solid Phlogiston]] is found in the form of large crystals or uniform orange blocks. These structures are not climbable by normal means, but can be ascended using the abilities of Tepetlisaurs or playable characters from the Children of Echoes. Certain large solid phlogiston deposits can be broken with simultaneous attacks on structural weak points.
* [[Liquid Phlogiston]] is a hazard that rapidly depletes the player's [[HP]]. It can be traversed safely by Koholasaurs, Mavuika or characters from the People of the Springs (while using their Elemental Skill), or Tatankasaurs in Spirited state. Liquid Phlogiston can also be solidified by a nearby [[Coagulation Pearl]] that is inserted into a Coagulated Pedestal or is held by an indwelled Yumkasaur, which allows the player to stand on it safely.
* [[Gaseous Phlogiston]] acts similarly to a [[Wind Current]], except that it also restores the player's phlogiston and depletes their HP while inside it. Qucusaurs, Mavuika, and characters from the Flower-Feather Clan can ride in the current without harm. Gaseous Phlogiston also fills [[Tutorial/Hot Phlogiston Balloon|Hot Phlogiston Balloons]], which restore phlogiston to the player when they are burst.
* [[Tutorial/Unstable Phlogiston Crystals...|Unstable Phlogiston Crystals]] explode after a short delay when the player gets close. Some of them are located underground and can only be sensed by the special abilities of Tepetlisaurs or playable characters from the Children of Echoes.
* [[Pulverite]] is a Phlogiston-laced stone that can be found in large chunks in [[Atocpan]]. It can be destroyed by the Spirited state of a Tatankasaur or character from the Collective of Plenty.

===Other===
* [[Abyssal Blight]] and [[Abyssal Blight#Tutorial|Abyssal Vortices]] that block access to objects and areas can be melted away with Cocouik's Rings of Light, or by lighting up a nearby [[Abyssal Blight#Tutorial|Radiant Pillar]]. This is required to cleanse the [[Core of Chu'ulel]] during the {{Quest|Palace of the Vision Serpent}}.
* When collected, the [[Tutorial/All-purifying Sacred Flame...|All-purifying Sacred Flame]] can ignite certain braziers in Natlan.
* [[Tutorial/Crackling Mysterious Firestone|Crackling Mysterious Firestones]] can be collected and delivered to the [[Altar of Primal Flame]] on the [[Legendary Tonatiuh]] to obtain the [[Golden Entreaty (Moment of Awakening)|second Golden Entreaty]]. The player will have to operate the sky-ship's [[Tutorial/Ancient Mechanisms on the Tonatiuh|Ancient Mechanisms]] to retrieve them during the {{Quest|The Other Side of the Sky}}.
* [[Dark Mud]] similar to that found in [[The Chasm]] is found within the [[Ancient Sacred Mountain]]. It slows the player's movement and continuously drains [[HP]].
* The [[Great Volcano of Tollan]] periodically erupts, spewing fireballs in many areas of [[Atocpan]]. In certain locations, giant boulders will roll downhill, which can be destroyed by Tatankasaurs or characters from the Collective of Plenty in Spirited state.
* [[Iridescent Beam]]s periodically fire on the player until they are touched.
* The player meets [[Little One]] upon first entering Natlan. He will spontaneously appear from time to time to guide the player to locations of interest. The {{Quest|Revelations from the Past}} allows the player to [[Tutorial/Humans and Saurians, one heart and one mind!|take control]] of Little One to help solve some puzzles. He cooperates with the player to defeat the [[Primeval Source Dragon Mech]] in {{Quest|An Omen of Annihilation and the Final Entreaty}}.
* [[Nightsoul Totem]]s lead to locations in the [[Night Kingdom]] to face trials against [[Local Legend]]s.
* Certain areas are affected by [[Pale Mist]], causing all color within them to be washed out. Hued Monetoos become inactive within the Mist and cannot paint. Certain stone statues purify the Mist within a certain radius after being activated, and can be moved along a track with attacks, causing the purified area to move with them. The player can permanently dispel the Mist from an area by correctly painting a nearby stone monument, then interacting with it.
* [[Pyro Sigil]]s can be collected and [[Offering System|offered]] at the [[Tablet of Tona]] for rewards.
* {{Item|Pyroculus|text=Pyroculi}} can be offered at [[Statues of the Seven]] in Natlan for rewards.
* [[Tutorial/Sealed Flamecrystals|Sealed Flamecrystals]] block passageways and bind [[Ix Uxul Tz'ib Bolon Ch'ule-L]]'s consciousness during the {{Quest|Open Your Heart to Me}}. They can be broken with attacks.
* [[Secret Source Sentinel]]s can move objects when activated, or can act as enemies guarding certain areas.
* [[Tutorial/Spores of Repose|Spores of Repose]] can be used to create a temporary Leaf of Repose in mid-air to stand on, similar to the ones created when grappling Coilgrass Sigils.
* [[Tutorial/Strange Mechanism Components...|Strange Mechanism Components]] can be used to activate some Ruin Mechanisms during {{Quest|Open Your Heart to Me}}. They must be oriented correctly, then inserted into the corresponding hole.
* The [[Tutorial/"Super Awesomesauce Laser"|"Super Awesomesauce Laser"]] is [[Paimon]]'s name for an ability Cocouik obtains to fire a strong beam of energy during the {{Quest|Vaulting the Wall of Morning Mist}}. It is used to ground the [[Dragon of the City of Flowing Ash]] so that it may be defeated.
* [[Tribal Secret Space]]s can be unlocked using [[Obsidian Ring]]s which are assembled from fragments found in [[Precious Chest|Precious]] and [[Luxurious Chest]]s in Natlan. Each tribe's space requires a separate ring in a unique color: [[Azure Obsidian Ring|azure]], [[Crimson Obsidian Ring|crimson]], [[Green Obsidian Ring|green]], [[Purple Obsidian Ring|purple]], [[Yellow Obsidian Ring|yellow]], and [[Sunset-Blue Obsidian Ring|sunset-blue]].
* Many enemies unique to Natlan (including [[Saurian]]s) that become aware of the player's presence do not immediately become [[Aggravation|aggravated]]. Indwelling a Saurian allows the player to approach other Saurians without aggravating them at all unless the player attacks, or aggravates a nearby non-Saurian.

==Trivia ==
[[File:Natlan Latin "Motto".png|150px|thumb|Screenshot from [[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]]]
* In the trailer ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]'', under the title of the quest ''[[Incandescent Ode of Resurrection]]'', there is a line written in Teyvat's [[Latin-Based Language|Latin script]]. It reads "''Surge vir fortis i natam victoriam''" roughly meaning "Rise, O strong man, and go to your destined victory."
* Natlan is the last of the seven regions to be directly mentioned in-game and the only region that does not have any NPCs from the nation prior to its version of release. It was first mentioned by name in [[Version 2.0]] through [[Tingting]], [[Aikawa Susumu]], and [[Mikawa Akane]]'s dialogues.
** All other nations have some of their NPCs revealed in [[Version 1.0]].
* Two bathhouse NPCs in [[Inazuma]], [[Mikawa Akane]] in [[Tenshukaku]] and [[Aikawa Susumu]] in [[Tenryou]], mention that Natlan contains hot-springs created from volcanic activity. As Inazuma does not have natural volcanic hot springs, [[Snezhnaya]] lent the Royal Bath Commission a device which would create artificial ones.
* [[Shousen]] mentions that the people of Natlan practice {{W|shadowboxing}}.
* A sailor in [[Romaritime Harbor]], [[Lectoure]], mentions that there are a few different tribes with different rules in Natlan.
* [[Adel]], an NPC located in the [[Bayda Harbor]], speaks very highly of the place, stating that its population is energetic and that "their souls are forged for battle from birth", that they love street graffiti, showing off and comparing fashionable trinkets. He also states it's a "contradictory, charming and colorful" place.
* Ranjit mentions that the people there, especially the warriors, dress in imitation of their Saurians.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Search Chronicle: Burning Up!}}</ref>
* The [[:File:Natlan Preview Teaser - Need a Hand? - Genshin Impact -Natlan -Preview -Teaser -Genshin Impact|Natlan Preview Teaser]] video was the first regional preview teaser not to reveal the new characters' names. [[Kachina]], [[Mualani]] and [[Kinich]] appeared, but were not named until [[:File:Ignition Teaser- A Name Forged in Flames - Genshin Impact -Ignition -Teaser -GenshinImpact|''Ignition Teaser: A Name Forged in Flames'']].
** Fauna unique to Natlan was also shown in the Natlan Preview Teaser. A cervid or deer-like animal, as well as a sauropod-like animal were briefly shown.

===Etymology===
* Natlan's name likely derives from {{W|Aztlán}}, the legendary homeland of the {{W|Aztecs}}.
* Natlan's name is likely structured of the noun "Na" and the suffix ''-tlan'' which is a locative suffix to denote adjacency, distance below or to describe abundance in Classical {{W|Nahuatl}}.
** The "Na" in Natlan could possibly be taken from the word Nahuatl.
** Alternatively, while both {{w|Quechuan languages|Quechua}} and Nahuatl are unrelated, "Na" could be taken from ''Nina'' meaning "fire" in Quechua. 

===Cultural References===
* Natlan appears to be inspired by several indigenous cultures, primarily those of {{w|Pre-Columbian Americas}}, {{w|Sub-Saharan Africa}}, and {{w|Oceania}}. It also draws from cultures of {{w|Southeast Asia}}, modern Latin America, and modern North America (particularly African-American culture).
** The names of Natlan's tribes derive from the {{w|Thirteen Heavens}} of {{w|Nahua}} cosmology.
** The names of [[Tenoch]]'s fighting companions, as mentioned in the [[Talking Stick]] lore, are of {{w|Kenya}}n, {{w|Ethiopia}}n, {{w|Amazigh}}, {{w|Burkina Faso|Burkinese}}, {{w|Mali Empire|Malian}} and {{w|Inca Empire|Inca}} origin, respectively.
** The names of characters from ''[[:File:Ignition Teaser- A Name Forged in Flames - Genshin Impact -Ignition -Teaser -GenshinImpact|Ignition Teaser: A Name Forged in Flames]]'' also come from the languages and cultures of {{w|Hopi}} ({{w|Pueblo}}), {{w|Yucatecan languages|Yucatec}} ({{w|Maya peoples|Maya}}), {{w|Culture of the Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian}}, {{w|Yoruba people|Yoruba}}, {{w|Nahua}}, and {{w|Māori people|Māori}}.
** A book titled [https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/an-environmental-history-of-latin-america/71718C2B24898A497F2C7DC085FB2680 ''An Environmental History of Latin America''] can be seen on a developer's desk during the 4.4 Special Program.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/abZdO3rWoVc Version 4.4 Special Program].</ref>
** The music in the ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]'' includes guitar and {{w|castanets}}, which are often heard in traditional Latin music.
** The music in the first preview teaser includes {{w|balafon}} and {{W|Tambin|fula flutes}}, which are often heard in {{W|West Africa#Culture|West African}} music.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/74e8YSME9zI Natlan Preview Teaser - Saurian Wanderings].</ref>
** The music in the second preview teaser included a {{W|didgeridoo}}, a well-known traditional Aboriginal instrument from Australia.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/XOK1F9TLEH8 Natlan Preview Teaser - Need a Hand?]</ref>
** The people of Natlan, particularly the [[Children of Echoes]], enjoy {{w|breakdancing}}, {{w|hip-hop}}, and {{w|rapping|rap}}, all of which have their roots in African-American culture.
** {{w|Graffiti}} is a popular art form in Natlan. For the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]], it also plays a role in spiritual traditions (e.g., as [[Nightspirit Graffiti]]). Many pieces imitate the art style of modern American graffiti.
** Some visuals in Natlan utilize the "classic" American comic book art style of the mid-20th century, which features techniques like {{w|half-tone dots}}.
* The terrain of Natlan is modeled after landscapes such as {{w|horst and graben}}s and {{w|mesa}}s. These are similar to various African and South American canyons and landscapes, such as the {{w|Chapada Diamantina}}, {{w|Monte Roraima}}, and {{W|Blyde River Canyon|the Blyde River Canyon}}.
** The local flora resembles plants of the {{w|savannah}}, such as {{w|baobab}} and {{w|acacia}} trees.
