==Trivia==
* Natlan seems to be inspired by {{w|Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian}} or {{w|Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous America}} with additional influences from {{w|Spain|Spanish}} and {{w|West Africa#African traditional|West African}} cultures.
** The music in the ''Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail''<ref name="tcsp"/> includes guitar and {{w|castanets}}, which are often heard in traditional Spanish music.
**Natlan's name likely derives from the Aztekah homeland, and the US breakaway state called "Aztlan". 
** Natlan can mean "place near where there is abundance (of) Na" in Nahuatl.
** [[Iansan]]'s name may have been a reference to the {{w|Ọya|orisha Ọya-Iyansan}} (in Yoruba), who is also called Iansã in Latin America where derivatives of the Yoruba religion also exist.
*** The Iansã orisha is commonly associated with the image of a warrior and two colors that are associated with Orisha are purple and black which can be found in Iansan's clothing.
* In the trailer ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]'', under the title of the quest ''Incandescent Ode of Resurrection'', there is a line written in Teyvat's [[Latin-Based Language|Latin script]]. It reads "''Surge vir fortis i natam victoriam''," roughly meaning "Rise, O strong man, and go to your destined victory."
* Natlan was the last of the seven regions to be directly mentioned in-game, and is still the only region that does not have any NPCs. It was first mentioned by name in [[Version 2.0]] through [[Tingting]], [[Aikawa Susumu]], and [[Mikawa Akane]]'s dialogues.
* Two bathhouse NPCs in [[Inazuma]], [[Mikawa Akane]] in [[Tenshukaku]] and [[Aikawa Susumu]] in [[Tenryou]], mention that Natlan contains hot-springs created from volcanic activity. As Inazuma does not have natural volcanic hot springs, [[Snezhnaya]] lent the Royal Bath Commission a device which would create artificial ones. As Natlan is the region of [[Pyro]], it is possible that Natlan is the only region with natural hot-springs.
* [[Shousen]] mentions that the people of Natlan practice shadowboxing.
