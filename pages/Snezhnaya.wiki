{{Lang|'''Snezhnaya'''|ru=Снежная|ru_rm=Snezhnaya}} is one of the seven regions of [[Teyvat]]. It is the nation that worships the [[Tsaritsa]], the [[Cryo]] [[Archon]]. The [[Fatui]], a military force under her control, is particularly notorious for their diehard devotion and their unscrupulous methods in enacting her will.

[[Archon Quest]] [[Chapter VI]] takes place in this region.

==Description==
Snezhnaya is a region of perpetual winter storms; [[Nadia]] states that blizzards can last for a month straight and despite being in the midst of danger, its people look up to the sky and are just happy to be alive. [[Tartaglia|Childe]] claims that people would literally freeze to death if they didn't keep moving outside. At night, the Snezhnayan sky can see a beautiful aurora of dancing light.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/tN5JACOEJFM "The Song Burning in the Embers" Full Animated Short | Genshin Impact] (1:46)</ref>

Technologically, Snezhnaya is much more advanced than the other regions on Teyvat. [[Venti]] states that the Fatui are the strongest out of the seven regions' military, which is supported by the fact that all of their known fighting members utilize elemental attacks. The description for [[Agent's Sacrificial Knife]] calls it a "weapon made with superior Snezhnayan technology." The [[Fatui Skirmishers]] wear mechanical suits of varying degrees, and some of its members use guns and cannons in battle. [[Alice]], who has visited Snezhnaya, recalls seeing massive factories, which she wrote down in her [[Teyvat Travel Guide]], and [[Il Dottore]] built a factory in [[Liyue]] to conduct [[Ruin Guard]] research which is fully automated.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Defender of Childhood Dreams}}</ref>

Snezhnaya is stated to be considered the same status as [[Mondstadt]], as in independent and not belonging to any other nation, according to [[Jean]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Shadow Over Mondstadt}}</ref>

The [[Adventurers' Guild]] originates from Snezhnaya;<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Lan|quote=[...]word came from the headquarters in Snezhnaya[...]}}</ref> while this fact doesn't seem to be a secret, few people comment on it and the Guild doesn't face the same apprehension that people regard the Fatui with. It was also hinted that [[Katheryne]], the receptionist(s) for the Adventurers' Guild, are a series of androids created for the role: the Katherynes in all regions so far are identical, and have "Error..." and "Rebooting..." idle quotes. This is further emphasized by the Katheryne stationed in Liyue, as she side-steps the Traveler questioning about her identity. Katheryne's identity as a "bionic Snezhnayan puppet" was confirmed by [[Nahida]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Dawn (Quest)}}</ref>

==Trivia==
[[File:Snezhnaya Latin "Motto".png|150px|thumb|Screenshot from [[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]]]
* In the trailer ''[[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]]'', under the title of the quest ''[[Everwinter Without Mercy]]'', there is a line written in Teyvat's [[Latin-Based Language|Latin script]]. It reads "''Ducam regina mea gloria haud pluribus impar''" roughly meaning "I, nigh unmatched Queen by my glory, shall be guide."
** The last part of the sentence is likely modified from {{w|nec pluribus impar}} a Latin motto adopted by Louis XIV of France.
*** The motto and its meaning are obscure and almost untranslatable.
** It is by far the longest of the seven phrases written in the Latin script in the video.
* Tartaglia's flashback in his character demo shows Dragonspine rather than Snezhnaya, likely because Snezhnaya has not been modeled yet.
** When the trailer was released, Dragonspine was not accessible yet.
* Official art was released with [[Tartaglia]] and [[Teucer]] for the Eastern Slavic holiday {{w|Maslenitsa}} (also known as Butter Lady, Butter Week, Crepe Week, or Cheesefare Week). It is possible that a holiday inspired by it is celebrated in Snezhnaya.

===Etymology===
* {{Lang|"Snezhnaya"|ru=Снежная|auto_rm=1|ru_tl=Snowy}} is a Russian adjective for "snowy," expecting a feminine noun to follow (most likely {{ru|Страна}} or {{ru|Земля}} &mdash; Russian words for "country" or "land" respectively, both of which are feminine and are permitted to be omitted for a synecdoche in such a context). The game's voiceover places the accent on the second syllable (Snezh-'''na'''-ya); however, in the original word, it's on the first ('''Snezh'''-na-ya).
** During the first Closed Beta Test, Snezhnaya was instead named "Prekrasnaya" ({{ru|Прекрасная|tl=Beautiful}}).<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/w_StUH0Uot0?t=18451 Genshin Impact - CBT Special Episode 3] by Crosus (Timestamp: 5:07:31)</ref>
** Snezhnaya's Chinese name, {{zh|至冬|Zhìdōng}}, is an anagram of the Chinese term for {{w|winter solstice}} ({{zh|冬至|Dōngzhì}}).
* {{Lang|"Zapolyarny"|auto_rm=1|ru=Заполярный|ru_tl=Polar}} roughly translates to "beyond the arctic circle" or "inside the polar region."
* {{Lang|"Morepesok"|auto_rm=1|ru=Морепесок|ru_tl=Sea-Sand}} is a compound of the words for {{ru|море|tl=sea}} and {{ru|песок|tl=sand,}} itself referring to a beach or coastline as a sort of kenning.
* {{Lang|"Tsaritsa"|auto_rm=1|ru=Царица|ru_tl=Empress}}, used to refer to their Archon, is the feminine form of {{w|Tsar}}, which ultimately derives from Caesar, a title of Roman emperors. So far, no one has called her by her true name; Snezhnayans call her by her title, while [[Venti]] and [[Zhongli]] call her "the Cryo Archon."

===Cultural References===
* Snezhnaya seems to be inspired by a mix of Tsarist and Soviet Russia (primarily Siberia in regards to landscape), and often uses Russian words for names. However, it also draws from other European nations as well, such as using Italian {{it|{{w|commedia dell'arte}}}} stock characters' names for the Harbingers.
* Snezhnaya's affiliation with brutal winters parallels Russia's climate, which has famously contributed to the failures of the ''many'' military campaigns made against it.
* [[Tartaglia]] addresses the Traveler as "comrade" in his [[Tartaglia/Voice-Overs|voice-overs]], the usual translation of {{Lang|"tovarishch"|ru=товарищ|auto_rm=1}} used in Soviet/Bolshevik Russia.
** In the Japanese version of Childe's Character Miscellany, he starts off his letter ("Dearest sister...") in Russian.<ref>Twitter: [https://twitter.com/Genshin_7/status/1327175428356800512 {{ja|キャラクター実戦紹介}}]</ref>
* {{Lang|Fire-Water|ru=огненная вода|ru_tl=fiery water|auto_rm=1}}, which [[Angel's Share]] bartender [[Charles]] deems the strongest wine he knows of, originates from Snezhnaya. It is a reference to the liquor {{w|vodka}}, a drink commonly associated with Russia. In real life Russian Vodka is normally 45-55% Ethanol and some Vodkas are more than 80% Ethanol, making Vodka one of the most alcoholic drinks in the world.
