{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Xudi:''' Why, hello, dear guest! Come and give this Fantastical Fabricator a twist.
:{{DIcon}} About these "Paper Models"...
::'''Xudi:''' Oh! These paper model designs are based on my friends, who graciously agreed to my requests.
::'''Xudi:''' See here? This squirrel is modeled after [[Clanche]], who's always nagging me to try flying... And I have! I just, you know, spend more time on the ground than in the air.
::'''Xudi:''' This toy soldier model is based on [[Devitt]], who loves traveling and making toy models... but loves his hats even more.
::'''Xudi:''' Last I met him, he was still in [[Constellation Metropole]], tinkering with those hats of his.
::'''Xudi:''' Ah, and look at this serious, solemn clockwork guard. That's based on [[Alof]].
::'''Xudi:''' Not the talking type, him, but ever loyal and dutiful. If I remember right, he's been busy training &mdash; not that he ever isn't.
::'''Xudi:''' Ah, my apologies, I'm talking too much, aren't I? Well, activate the Fabricator, if you would.
::'''Xudi:''' Dewdrops willing, a fine gift you shall receive, and with it the gift of a fine mood.
:{{DIcon}} About the story of the "Good Shelf"...
::'''Xudi:''' Oh, you'd like to hear the tale, then? Sure. Allow me to briefly introduce this widely-told tale, then.
::'''Xudi:''' It is said that there was once a kingdom constructed of shelves of many colors.
::'''Xudi:''' Each shelf had its own duty and objects that they would hold, but there came to be one, newly crafted shelf that was dissatisfied.
::'''Xudi:''' "Why does that shelf get to hold jewelry, and that other hold paintings, while I am consigned to carry expired fruit?"
::'''Xudi:''' "Enough! I've had enough. I'm leaving this place. I'm going to carry things that truly show my worth!"
::{{DIcon}} (Keep listening.)
:::'''Xudi:''' After that, this shelf embarked on its journey, During this time, he was once the custodian of a wealthy figure's trove of gems and pearls, filling him full, and he also preserved the priceless pieces made by a prominent painter.
:::'''Xudi:''' But when the rich patron passed of an illness, his previous friends did an about-face, seizing all that jewelry for themselves, leaving not a brass bauble behind.
:::'''Xudi:''' And as the artist's inspiration faded and drew great masterworks no longer, his once-vaunted reputation was tarnished.
:::'''Xudi:''' People pilloried him as incompetent, and at last, the agonized artist accomplished arson against all his art, vowing never to paint again.
:::{{DIcon}} (Keep listening.)
::::'''Xudi:''' This shelf once had all it dreamed of, yet lost it all as well. He was exhausted... Once brand new and beautiful, he was now old and weathered, and missing a few of his boards to boot.
::::'''Xudi:''' Once the shelf of the wealthy, and of an artist... But now that these things that once filled his life were gone, who was he?
::::'''Xudi:''' Finally, the shelf returned to the kingdom, sequestering himself in the corner of a library, and there lived alone.
::::'''Xudi:''' "I'm a useless shelf," he thought sadly. "Bereft of those jewels and paintings, I am of no worth."
::::{{DIcon}} (Keep listening.)
:::::'''Xudi:''' But just as the solitude and sorrow were soon to squash his soul, a girl holding books happened by.
:::::'''Xudi:''' "Oh my, an empty shelf! What a lifesaver!" So she cried happily. "Dear shelf, could I place these books in your care?"
:::::'''Xudi:''' "Of course you may &mdash; yet I am a worthless shelf. I do not know if I can even be of help to you," the shelf said sorrowfully.
:::::'''Xudi:''' "But... Your frame is large, your boards flat and sturdy." The girl continued, surprised. "No matter how you look at it, you're a good shelf, and you can hold a whole bunch of books."
:::::{{DIcon}} (Keep listening.)
::::::'''Xudi:''' And so the shelf told the girl his story, of how he had once been a guardian of wealth and glory, but that loss and betrayal, too, had come to fill him.
::::::'''Xudi:''' And now, he had nothing. He was a valuable shelf no longer.
::::::'''Xudi:''' "Dear shelf, why does this matter trouble you so?" The girl laughed. "You've always done your duty, neatly carrying all the things given to you."
::::::'''Xudi:''' "Those things are lost, broken, changed, but that has nothing to do with you. You've always been a good shelf."
::::::'''Xudi:''' "Taking good care of those things is where your value lies. How could the things you kept define whether you are good or bad?"
::::::'''Xudi:''' "So, please, I ask you to do your duty again. Help me take care of these books."
::::::'''Xudi:''' "I'll come and sort them every day, and we can discuss this topic more then."
::::::{{DIcon}} (Keep listening.)
:::::::'''Xudi:''' From that day onward, all the shelves of the kingdom heard that in a certain library, there was a smart, steady, incomparably sound shelf.
:::::::'''Xudi:''' He would never be happy or anxious because of the value of the things he carried, treasuring everything earnestly.
:::::::'''Xudi:''' Newly-made shelves would visit him and ask him all manner of questions.
:::::::'''Xudi:''' And when mentioning him, the new shelves would never fail to address him so&mdash;
:::::::'''Xudi:''' "Ah, you mean that 'Good Shelf'!"
::::::{{DIcon}} (Stop listening...)
:::::{{DIcon}} (Stop listening...)
::::{{DIcon}} (Stop listening...)
:::{{DIcon}} (Stop listening...)
::{{DIcon}} (Stop listening...)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Xudi:''' See you next time. May the dewdrops defend you.
