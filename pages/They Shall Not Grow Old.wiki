==Trivia==
* ''{{w|They Shall Not Grow Old}}'' is the name of a 2018 documentary film covering the experiences of soldiers during World War I. The title of the documentary is a variation of one of the most well-known lines of the Ode of Remembrance, which originated from {{w|For the Fallen|"For the Fallen"}}, a poem published in 1914 and written by Laurence Binyon in response to the outbreak of World War I.
