==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Flora:''' Welcome to Floral Whisper. Do you need anything?
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'd like to buy some flowers.
::'''Flora:''' Certainly. We have a fine selection, whether you're looking to give a bouquet to someone or even do some gardening yourself.
:;(Opens the [[Floral Whisper#Shop|Floral Whisper shop]].)
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror...
:;(After completing [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]])
::'''Flora:''' I was honestly more frightened by the storm that surrounded Mondstadt than Stormterror.
::'''Flora:''' Everyone's been focused on the losses to people and property, but I'm still more concerned about the plants and flowers.
::'''Flora:''' I'll protect them, just like how Lord Barbatos protects us.
:;(After completing [[A Long Shot]])
::'''Flora:''' It's great that I don't have to worry about the flowers in my store being blown away by the wind.
::'''Flora:''' That said, the [[Dandelion Seed]]s have also been blown all across the region of Mondstadt by this storm. Who knows, perhaps they will bloom throughout the land.
::'''Flora:''' When I think about it like that, the storm doesn't seem so scary anymore, haha.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about your flowers.
::'''Flora:''' We carry a large variety of flowers. Are you looking for anything in particular?
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about Dandelions.
:::'''Flora:''' Dandelions are so very feathery. They are my personal favorite.
:::'''Flora:''' The [[Jean|Acting Grand Master]] of the Knights is also known as the Dandelion Knight, as I recall.
:::'''Flora:''' She probably learned the power of Anemo from the dandelions, hehe.
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} Why do you like Dandelions so much?
::::'''Flora:''' Hehe, I wonder... Maybe it's because I've been reading The Fox in the Dandelion Sea.
::::'''Flora:''' Here, take it. Maybe you'll like dandelions too once you finish reading it, hehe.
:::;(Obtain [[The Fox in the Dandelion Sea|The Fox in the Dandelion Sea (I)]] ×1)
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about [[Sweet Flower]]s.
:::'''Flora:''' Sweet Flowers, you say?
:::'''Flora:''' They look nice, but most people just use them for cooking.
:::'''Flora:''' If you see people having Sweet Flowers in their gardens...
:::'''Flora:''' They are probably used to get sugar.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about [[Cecilia]]s.
:::'''Flora:''' Cecilias! You've got good taste.
:::'''Flora:''' They grow in cold and windy places. Legend has it that they only bloom when it's quiet.
:::'''Flora:''' If you wish to cultivate them...
:::'''Flora:''' You'll probably have better luck with [[Mist Flower Corolla|Mist Flowers]]!
:{{DIcon}} Sorry for bothering you.
::'''Flora:''' You need to go?
::'''Flora:''' I'll tell you more about flowers next time if you like.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Touch the Flowers===
After completing the World Quest ''[[Flighty Flora... and Flora]]'', approaching the flowers at Floral Whisper prompts the option to Touch them. Doing so, however, results in a scolding from Flora during the daytime.

{{dialogue start}}
:'''Flora:''' Hey! Those flowers are for display only! If you want to buy flowers, come look over here.
{{dialogue end}}

==Event Dialogue==
===Invitation of Windblume===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Flora:''' Welcome to Floral Whisper. Are you looking to get someone a bouquet? It's the Windblume Festival, after all.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'd like to buy some flowers.
:;(Same as normal)
:{{DIcon}} About the Windblume Festival...
::'''Flora:''' The Windblume Festival is an ancient tradition of Mondstadt's. A day of freedom and romance.
::'''Flora:''' When we speak of Windblume Festival tradition, I suppose it's about giving the "Windblume" in your heart to the person who's the most important to you, hehe.
::'''Flora:''' As to what flower the Windblume actually is, everyone's got their own opinions.
::'''Flora:''' Well, that's freedom for you, hehe.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about your flowers.
:;(Same as normal)
:{{DIcon}} I've got to go.
::'''Flora:''' I hope you'll enjoy yourself during the Windblume festivities.

==Trivia==
*{{w|Flora (mythology)|Flora}} is the Roman goddess of spring and flowers, as well as the goddess of youth. Her Greek counterpart is {{w|Chloris (nymph)|Chloris}}, whom [[Chloris|Flora's sister]] shares the same name with.
*Flora was originally modeled as an adult, and [[Ulfr]]'s previous dialogue had him wishing to confess his love to Flora someday on a dandelion boat, a piece of dialogue that was retained for a period of time even after Flora's model was changed to that of a child's. This was eventually updated, and now his new dialogue has him seeing her as his little sister which he never had.
*Flora was mentioned in [[Lisa/Lore#Character Story 3|Lisa's Story 3]].
*Flora is mentioned in the description of the Furnishing item ''[["Crystalfly's Perch"]]''.
