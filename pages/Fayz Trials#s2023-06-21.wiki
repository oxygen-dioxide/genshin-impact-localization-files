===Tutorial===
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Fayz Trials Hypothesis 1.png
|text1  = Defeating opponents in combat will grant Fayz Tinctures that will accumulate up to a certain point where they can be used to enter Time Dilation mode. You can accumulate up to 3 uses of the Fayz Potion at any one time.
|image2 = Tutorial Fayz Trials Hypothesis 2.png
|text2  = Use the Fayz Potion to enter Time Dilation mode. In this mode, you can {{Color|help|zoom and adjust your camera angle}} to adjust your field of vision.<br>In Time Dilation mode, you can {{Color|help|save the onscreen image}} into your screenshots.<br>Use your Viewfinder to {{Color|help|capture your opponents' Weaknesses}} and use the Supersense Skill. When you have captured over 8 such Weaknesses, you can unleash a buffed Supersense Skill.
|image3 = Tutorial Fayz Trials Hypothesis 3.png
|text3  = Different opponents will have different numbers of Weaknesses. You will find golden Critical Weaknesses in some opponents. Spotting 1 such Critical Weakness is equal to spotting 2 ordinary Weaknesses. The former allows you to obtain a buffed Supersense Skill more efficiently. If you leave Time Dilation mode without spotting any Weaknesses, you will not expend any Fayz Potions."
