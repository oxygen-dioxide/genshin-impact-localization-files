===Invitation of Windblume===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Lizzie:''' Hey there! Having fun this Windblume Festival?
:{{DIcon}} What do you do here?
::'''Lizzie:''' I'm in charge of welcoming guests, and of organizing all sorts of fun activities for everyone during the Windblume Festival.
::'''Lizzie:''' A lot of the events are being held outdoors due to the large area needed, so without a guide to tell them where things are happening, lots of people are going to miss out!
::'''Lizzie:''' And I, Lizzie, am glad to step up to that plate!
::{{DIcon}} So what's going on, then?
:::'''Lizzie:''' There are three events taking place during the festival: "Bullseye Balloons," "Floral Freefall," and "Ballads of Breeze".
:::'''Lizzie:''' As for the details... As opposed to having me explain, I think it might be easier if you try them out yourself.
:::'''Lizzie:''' As long as the preparations for the activity have already been made, I can tell you where they're being held.
:::'''Lizzie:''' May you have a happy Windblume Festival!
::{{DIcon}} Are there any other interesting things to do?
:::'''Lizzie:''' I've heard that the Adventurers' Guild has something special up their sleeve for the Windblume Festival.
:::'''Lizzie:''' If you're interested, I'd advise you to look for an adventurer named [[Plauen]]. He'll tell you all about it!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Lizzie:''' See you. Happy Windblume Festival!

===Windblume's Breath===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Before the event started)
:'''Lizzie:''' Ah, I hope this event will go smoothly this time too...
:{{DIcon}} What are you working on?
:'''Lizzie:''' I'm preparing to welcome guests here. We've got all sorts of fun activities lined up for the Windblume Festival.
:'''Lizzie:''' But some of the events are being held outside the city due to the large areas needed, so without a guide to tell people where things are happening, some of them are going to miss out!
:'''Lizzie:''' That's why I've been stationed here and put in charge of introducing the festival's activities to everyone.
:{{DIcon}} Well, tell me all about it.
:{{DIcon}} What activities have we got lined up?
:'''Lizzie:''' There are three events taking place during the festival: "Ballads of Breeze," "Floral Pursuit," and "Breezy Snapshots."
:'''Lizzie:''' The activity I'm in charge of, specifically, is "Ballads of Breeze." The other two representatives should also be at their stations and making some final preparations.
:'''Lizzie:''' Everyone's pretty excited, so here's to the smooth running of this year's Windblume Festival.
:'''Lizzie:''' May you have a happy time as well!

;(During the event)
:'''Lizzie:''' Would you like to play a song? As long as you do your best to keep up with the rhythm and beat, you'll be able to strum up a storm with ease.
:'''Lizzie:''' Focus only on the wind around you and the lovely song you wish to play, and all your troubles will surely fade away.
:{{DIcon|Drumalong}} I'll give it a go now.
::'''Lizzie:''' No problem. The scores are over here and ready for your perusal.
:{{DIcon}} I've got something else to do right now...
::'''Lizzie:''' Oh, that's fine... You're welcome back any time, though!
