{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Lizzie:''' Hey there! Having fun this Windblume Festival?
:{{DIcon}} What do you do here?
::'''Lizzie:''' I'm in charge of welcoming guests, and of organizing all sorts of fun activities for everyone during the Windblume Festival.
::'''Lizzie:''' A lot of the events are being held outdoors due to the large area needed, so without a guide to tell them where things are happening, lots of people are going to miss out!
::'''Lizzie:''' And I, Lizzie, am glad to step up to that plate!
::{{DIcon}} So what's going on, then?
:::'''Lizzie:''' There are three events taking place during the festival: "Bullseye Balloons," "Floral Freefall," and "Ballads of Breeze".
:::'''Lizzie:''' As for the details... As opposed to having me explain, I think it might be easier if you try them out yourself.
:::'''Lizzie:''' As long as the preparations for the activity have already been made, I can tell you where they're being held.
:::'''Lizzie:''' May you have a happy Windblume Festival!
::{{DIcon}} Are there any other interesting things to do?
:::'''Lizzie:''' I've heard that the Adventurers' Guild has something special up their sleeve for the Windblume Festival.
:::'''Lizzie:''' If you're interested, I'd advise you to look for an adventurer named [[Plauen]]. He'll tell you all about it!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Lizzie:''' See you. Happy Windblume Festival!
