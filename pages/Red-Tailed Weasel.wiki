|description = Prank-prone rascals with a slim and agile form.<br>These weasels are red from head to toe and are highly proficient in hunting bugs and lizards. Red-Tailed Weasels are very visible, but many predators who fear fire keep their distance due to the similarity between the weasels' coloration and the flames of Pyro.

'''Red-Tailed Weasel''' is a type of weasel that can be found in the wild.

==Drops==
{{Card|Raw Meat|1}}

Killing one for the first time will add this creature's entry into your in-game [[archive]].

==Strategy==
Red-Tailed Weasels encased in the [[Amber Rock]]s of [[Mt. Hulao]] will run away and disappear if not killed quickly. It is recommended to use an [[AoE]] skill or attack to kill it. Alternatively, a spinning [[Charged Attack]] of a [[Claymore]] [[Character]] when destroying the Amber Rock can increase the odds of hitting the weasel as soon as it is freed.

==Locations==
Red-Tailed Weasels can be found on Mt. Hulao in [[Liyue]], on [[Mt. Lingmeng]] in [[Chenyu Vale]], at the [[Kujou Encampment]] and [[Seirai Island]] in [[Inazuma]], and in the ruins near [[Fort Charybdis Ruins|Fort Charybdis]] in [[Fontaine]].

See the [https://act.hoyolab.com/ys/app/interactive-map/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=286 Official Interactive Map] for specific locations.
