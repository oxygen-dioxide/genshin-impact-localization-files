These weasels are red from head to toe and are highly proficient in hunting bugs and lizards. Red-Tailed Weasels are very visible, but many predators who fear fire keep their distance due to the similarity between the weasels' coloration and the flames of Pyro.|[[Archive]] Description}}
'''Red-Tailed Weasel''' is a type of beast which can be found both as [[Wildlife]] and as a pet for the [[Serenitea Pot]].

Outdoor creatures, as the name implies, can only be placed in outdoor spaces within the Serenitea Pot.

==Drops==
{{Card|Raw Meat|1}}

Killing one for the first time will add this creature's entry into your in-game [[archive]].

==Strategy==
Red-Tailed Weasels encased in the [[Amber Rock]]s of [[Mt. Hulao]] will run away and disappear if not killed quickly. It is recommended to use an [[AoE]] skill or attack to kill it. Alternatively, a spinning [[Charged Attack]] of a [[Claymore]] [[Character]] when destroying the Amber Rock can increase the odds of hitting the weasel as soon as it is freed.
