'''Candlecap Mushroom''' is a [[food]] item that the player obtains by foraging in the wild.

Candlecap Mushroom restores 300 HP to the target character. Like most foods, this can not target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]]; this can only target characters of the player's party. When collected in the wild, it generates 1 [[Phlogiston]] Particle, partially refilling the player's Phlogiston meter.

==How to Obtain==
See the '''[https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=619 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for specific locations.

==Description==
{{Description|A fungus that grows on cliff faces or at the foot of mountains, and which shines like a little lamp. You can feel a hint of warmth when your hand draws close.<br>According to some storytellers, these Candlecap Mushrooms are tended by mysterious spirits known as "[[Monetoo]]." It is said that these particular spirits hide beneath the Candlecap Mushroom on rainy days, and that when the mushrooms start to grow dim, they are responsible for lighting them back up again.}}
