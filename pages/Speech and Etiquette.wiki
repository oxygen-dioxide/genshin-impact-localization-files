;(Approach Eula in the plaza)
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Ah, you've finally arrived. There's no time to spare, so we'll begin with our first lesson...
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, hold on! There's something we need to clear up first, otherwise it'll keep bugging us!
:{{DIcon}} About all that "vengeance" stuff...
:{{DIcon}} You won't really take revenge, will you?
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' *sigh* So that's still on your mind, huh? Maybe you're the ones who can't let things go.
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Don't worry, there's a time and place for exacting vengeance. Besides, I'm not in the mood for any right now, best save it for later.
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... you need to be in the right "mood" for vengeance?
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I already have a long list of vengeance to exact. Even if I wanted to begin now, I'd have to start in the right order.
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Who knows how long it will be before I get to you.
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, well... if you have so much to take care of, wouldn't it just be easier to give us a clean slate?
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Absolutely not! Stealing my targets, calling me a "ruthless ruler," and suspecting my uncle... all worthy of vengeance in my eyes!
:{{DIcon}} She's definitely counting...
:{{DIcon}} She wasn't kidding.
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 07.ogg}} '''Eula:''' But you needn't worry, at least, not whilst we're investigating this matter. I'm sure you're familiar with the phrase: "A man of moral integrity fears no slanderous attack."
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 08.ogg}} '''Eula:''' If Uncle Schubert didn't commit any wrongdoing, then any such investigation will prove fruitless.
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 09.ogg}} '''Eula:''' But if he did commit a wrongful act, then he should bear the full punishment.
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 10.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I'm sure you understand.
:{{DIcon}} I think I'm starting to see what you mean.
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 11.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Good. Now, there are two key points that aristocrats attach great importance to &mdash; your manner of speech, and your bearing.
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 12.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Let's begin with your manner of speech. Aristocrats have a very unique way of carrying conversation, even with mundane daily topics.
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Paimon's already learned some unique conversation!
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Mark my words, vengeance will be mine!"
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 13.ogg}} '''Eula:''' ...
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 14.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Not even close. And besides, it sounds strange.
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Paimon learned it from you! And didn't you say not to call others "strange"!?
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It seems you don't respect the rules of your own clan!
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 15.ogg}} '''Eula:''' No, I've no need to trouble myself with such frivolous formalities. Here, allow me to demonstrate.
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 16.ogg}} '''Eula:''' For example, when greeting a friend, you could say: "As the morning dew greets the coming dawn, so do I greet you, my dear friend."
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... As the morning dew does what now?
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 17.ogg}} '''Eula:''' However, such a phrase may only be used during the morning hours. Also, the party with whom you're speaking must be of approximately the same status as you.
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 18.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Morning dew is not uncommon, so it expresses that friendship should not be measured by value, yet also suggests that friendship between aristocrats is pure like water.
:{{DIcon}} Seems like a lot of work just to greet a good friend.
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 19.ogg}} '''Eula:''' No no no, you must be prudent with your words. Calling someone a "good friend" could easily offend them.
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... But didn't you just say my "dear friend" in your example? Paimon's confused...
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 20.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Yes, I did. But you must know, in the Lawrence family, "dear friend" is a set phrase that can only be used towards certain friends with whom one is acquainted, but not particularly close.
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 21.ogg}} '''Eula:''' It sounds much more pleasant to call an acquaintance a "dear friend." So another thing to remember &mdash; aristocrats are concerned with face and being polite.
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 22.ogg}} '''Eula:''' However, if you were to use "dear friend" to address an intimate friend, the recipient would think that you were deliberately trying to estrange them.
:{{DIcon}} This is getting complicated!
:{{DIcon}} You mean you always have to talk this way!?
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 23.ogg}} '''Eula:''' This is only the first step in making a greeting. After addressing one another, you then exchange courtesies.
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, wait! This is all too abstract...
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... Perhaps it would be better if you... gave some real-life demonstrations.
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 24.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Ah...
:{{A|vo ellq002 1 eula 25.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Very well. Come with me, we'll choose some bystanders to converse with.

----

;(Talk to [[Norman]])
:{{A|vo ellq002 2 norman 01.ogg}} '''Norman:''' Oh... you're Eula of the Lawrence Clan, right? This can't be good...
:{{A|vo ellq002 2 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Ahem! You there, lowly laborer. You stand in the presence of a member of the illustrious Lawrence Clan. I have words for you.
:{{A|vo ellq002 2 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Please acknowledge the glory bestowed upon thee by the nobility, uhh... what comes next...? Oh, right! By solemnly kneeling to the ground with utmost sincerity.
:{{A|vo ellq002 2 norman 02.ogg}} '''Norman:''' Huh? I can't make heads or tails of anything you're saying!
:{{A|vo ellq002 2 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' *sigh* Hold on, what did they always teach me...?
:{{A|vo ellq002 2 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' "Whenever a dispute arises, protection of your family's prestige and dignity always takes precedence."
:{{A|vo ellq002 2 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Got it. Ahem! As a lowly commoner, you shall maintain absolute reverence when speaking with those under which you graciously toil. How dare you speak in such a manner?
:{{A|vo ellq002 2 norman 03.ogg}} '''[[Norman]]:''' Ugh, is everyone from the Lawrence Clan so strange?
:{{A|vo ellq002 2 norman 04.ogg}} '''Norman:''' The days of the Lawrence Clan's tyranny have long passed. I don't care what you're trying to do, just beat it.
:{{DIcon}} I think you misunderstood her...
:{{DIcon}} She's just giving us a demonstration, that's all.
:{{A|vo ellq002 2 norman 05.ogg}} '''Norman:''' Like I said, I don't care what you're doing. I have nothing to say to any member of the Lawrence Clan.
:{{A|vo ellq002 2 norman 06.ogg}} '''Norman:''' And here's a word of advice... I wouldn't be caught dead walking too closely with any one of their like in Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo ellq002 2 norman 07.ogg}} '''Norman:''' If that's all, I'll be going. I'm afraid I won't be able to control myself if we talk any longer.
:{{A|vo ellq002 2 eula 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Hey &mdash; hey! Don't leave! Halt! Ugh, mark my words, vengeance will be mine!
:{{A|vo ellq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow... the Lawrence name really does carry a terrible reputation.
:{{A|vo ellq002 2 eula 07.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Never mind him, I could have predicted as much. Let's find someone else.

----

;(Talk to [[Leno]])
:{{A|vo ellq002 3 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Ahem! You there, lowly toiler. You stand in the presence of a member of the illustrious Lawrence Clan. I have words for you.
:{{A|vo ellq002 3 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Please acknowledge the glory bestowed upon thee by the nobility, and solemnly kneel to the ground with utmost sincerity.
:{{A|vo ellq002 3 leno 01.ogg}} '''[[Leno]]:''' ...
:{{A|vo ellq002 3 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Huh? Why don't you respond? According to the custom, I must wait until you kneel completely before I can say the next words.
:{{A|vo ellq002 3 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Ah, right! I musn't look at you too long, or I'll be drawing more attention to our differences in status... Oh dear, I've already stared at you for quite a while.
:{{A|vo ellq002 3 leno 02.ogg}} '''Leno:''' ...
:{{A|vo ellq002 3 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Fine, you may spare yourself the formality of kneeling, as it may be a little inconvenient. I shall continue... Oh, wait, I think there's a line for people with rude attitudes in this situation...
:{{A|vo ellq002 3 leno 03.ogg}} '''Leno:''' Hey! Stop bothering me, or else I might say something you wouldn't like to hear!
:{{A|vo ellq002 3 leno 04.ogg}} '''Leno:''' Then again, I've got no words for anyone from the Lawrence Clan.
:{{A|vo ellq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Again? What's with this attitude?
:{{DIcon}} That escalated fast.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe we should stop for now.
:{{A|vo ellq002 3 eula 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Yes, I don't think his attitude will change. If I keep grandstanding like this, the outcome won't be good. Let's try to find someone else to talk to.
:{{A|vo ellq002 3 eula 07.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Hmph! I'll remember your unwillingness to comply! Mark my words, vengeance will be mine!

;(Talk to Leno again)
:{{A|vo dialog ellq002 leno 01.ogg}} '''Leno:''' Listen, I have no idea what she's trying to do... But trust me, you two should just keep away from her.

----

;(Talk to [[Randall]])
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' You there, lowly worker, I&mdash;
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 randall 01.ogg}} '''[[Randall]]:''' Yeah, I've already heard it all before. Look, just spare me the time, our answer is always the same. We've got nothing to say to the likes of you.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 randall 02.ogg}} '''Randall:''' I mean, seriously, can't you just take a hint?
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Please calm down, we don't want to cause any trouble.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 randall 03.ogg}} '''Randall:''' *sigh* I know she's a Knight of Favonius, and that the Knights wouldn't misplace their trust, but the name Lawrence carries too much weight with it.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 randall 04.ogg}} '''Randall:''' Even to this very day, the descendants of the Lawrence Clan are still scheming to reclaim Mondstadt and reinstate their aristocratic rule.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 randall 05.ogg}} '''Randall:''' And if that wasn't enough, here you are purposefully using their awkward way of speaking just to put on an act? Don't you care for the feelings of us ordinary folk?
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' You have a point.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' But mark my words, this transgression will not go unnoticed!
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 randall 06.ogg}} '''Randall:''' H&mdash;Huh? You wanna fight? Listen here, I might be no match for you, but I'll be sure to lodge a complaint with the Knights of Favonius!
:{{DIcon}} Maybe we should just call it a day now.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe everyone should just take a step back.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 randall 07.ogg}} '''Randall:''' I'm sorry but... I want her to understand that I'm serious!
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 randall 08.ogg}} '''Randall:''' Listen here, if you don't want things to get more unpleasant, then you'd better just stop.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Forget it, there's no point in quarreling any further. Let's go.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 randall 09.ogg}} '''Randall:''' *sigh*...
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' It's alright, this happens quite often. Let's find someone else to talk to.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, Paimon thinks we've seen enough now. Let's just stop.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Actually, Paimon thinks we should apologize for asking you to demonstrate for us. We had no idea the feelings between the Lawrence Clan and the people of Mondstadt were so bitter.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 eula 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Haha, what can we do? The Lawrence name is already a dirty word among every household in Mondstadt. Even three-year-olds know the story. I see this kind of attitude all the time.
:{{DIcon}} And somehow you still manage to brush it off with a laugh?
:{{DIcon}} I'm starting to sympathize with you.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 eula 07.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Don't worry, what with me being a Knight of Favonius, they're usually willing to speak a few words with me.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 eula 08.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Perhaps my aristocratic manner of speech provoked them today. Believe me, it's not a big issue.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So this is the way things are normally for you? There's no need for them to direct their anger at you personally.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 eula 09.ogg}} '''Eula:''' That's the way things are. Perhaps it's just fate for those who've made mistakes. Accepting punishment is only fair, right? But when your family has committed atrocities, I'm afraid there's no easy path to reconciliation.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 eula 10.ogg}} '''Eula:''' As memories are carried in the city breeze, the faults of such grievances are passed on from one generation to the next. It is now my turn to bear this burden.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 eula 11.ogg}} '''Eula:''' At least I have a means of living a relatively normal life compared to the elders of my family. I have nothing to be discontented about.
:{{DIcon}} So you knew all along that we'd encounter these kinds of problems?
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, why were you so willing to try and demonstrate for us?
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 eula 12.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Oh, that reminds me... that last person will not escape my vengeance either...
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 eula 13.ogg}} '''Eula:''' *sigh* Let's leave it at that. Just think of it as something I like to do.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 eula 14.ogg}} '''Eula:''' But unfortunately, you probably didn't learn much from those conversations. It seems we have no other choice but to find more people to talk to.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 paimon 06a.ogg}} {{A|vo ellq002 4 paimon 06b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, n&mdash;no need! Besides, the Traveler's pretty sharp, and nothing gets in our way on an adventure. Paimon thinks we've got the gist of it now.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right? RIGHT!?
:{{DIcon}} Uh... Yeah, I think I've got it.
:{{DIcon}} I'm still not too sure I can do this.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We'll just have to roll with it for now.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's just keep Eula from getting anyone else riled up.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 eula 15.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Well then, I'm glad you learned something. You're already halfway toward mastering aristocratic conduct.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 eula 16.ogg}} '''Eula:''' A proper manner of speech is more aesthetic than anything else &mdash; it stems from their taste for refinement.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 eula 17.ogg}} '''Eula:''' But we must also practice your bearing.
:{{A|vo ellq002 4 eula 18.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I have a very effective way of training for this. Come with me to Dragonspine.

;(Talk to Randall again)
:{{A|vo dialog ellq002 randall 01.ogg}} '''Randall:''' So it seems you've finally given up on the idea of finding more people to talk to.
:{{A|vo dialog ellq002 randall 02.ogg}} '''Randall:''' Believe me, that's in everyone's best interest.

----

;(Approach Eula in Dragonspine)
:{{A|vo ellq002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's s&mdash;so c&mdash;cold... Does aristocrat training really need to be done here?
:{{A|vo ellq002 5 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' If you wish to truly achieve the dignified conduct of an aristocrat, you must learn to remain composed and elegant even amidst harsh conditions.
:{{A|vo ellq002 5 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' For example, you can see that part of the path up ahead is quite difficult to traverse.
:{{A|vo ellq002 5 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' But a well-trained aristocrat would not only effortlessly proceed forward, but do so without a stain on their garment and their elegance fully intact.
:{{A|vo ellq002 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks we've let the realm of aristocrats and entered the realm of adventuring.
:{{A|vo ellq002 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Compared to what we've already seen, (Traveler), this should be a piece of cake.
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, I'm used to this kind of challenge.
::{{A|vo ellq002 5 paimon 04a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh-huh, this is where you can finally apply some of your adventuring knowledge.
:{{DIcon}} Should be way easier than making conversation, at least.
::{{A|vo ellq002 5 paimon 04b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks so too... But you've got this in the bag!
:{{A|vo ellq002 5 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Haha, you look pretty confident this time.
:{{A|vo ellq002 5 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Alright, let's get started. Remember, you must be graceful and elegant. Don't get knocked or launched into the air, that would be most unsightly.

;(Talk to Eula again)
:{{A|vo dialog ellq002 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Good luck! Just remember, don't get knocked or launched into the air. That would be most inelegant.

;(Upon taking damage)
:{{A|vo ellq002 5 eula 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' That won't do! You've exposed your shortcomings.
:{{A|vo ellq002 5 eula 07.ogg}} '''Eula:''' No need to worry. Head back to the starting point and try again.

:{{A|vo ellq002 6 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' It'll be difficult at first, but the key is to remain patient. Let's try again.
:{{A|vo ellq002 6 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Remember, you must be elegant... Don't get knocked or launched into the air.

;(After completing the challenge)
:{{A|vo ellq002 7 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Not bad. A lot better than I had anticipated, at least.
:{{A|vo ellq002 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *panting* Paimon almost didn't make it through! Whew, good thing we didn't get stuck.
:{{A|vo ellq002 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... so... are we "aristocrats" now?
:{{A|vo ellq002 7 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Don't flatter yourselves. We've only just begun.
:{{A|vo ellq002 7 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' This scenario was relatively simple. In the face of a real battle, one would seldom have a chance to stop and evaluate the situation.
:{{A|vo ellq002 7 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' There's a [[Ley Line Monolith]] just up ahead that will attract nearby monsters.
:{{A|vo ellq002 7 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' True elegance is the ability to calmly yet swiftly make decisions in the heat of the battle.
:{{DIcon}} Is this how you normally train?
:{{DIcon}} No wonder you are so skilled...
:{{A|vo ellq002 7 eula 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' My family set only the highest expectations for me, even as a child.
:{{A|vo ellq002 7 eula 07.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Let's proceed, shall we?

----

;(Approach the Ley Line Monolith)
:{{A|vo ellq002 7 eula 08.ogg}} '''Eula:''' This is the Ley Line Monolith. Go ahead, activate it.
:{{A|vo ellq002 7 eula 09.ogg}} '''Eula:''' But be careful not to get launched into the air or frozen while fighting. That would be most unsightly.

;(Upon getting frozen)
:{{A|vo ellq002 7 eula 10.ogg}} '''Eula:''' You failed this time, what a shame.
:{{A|vo ellq002 7 eula 11.ogg}} '''Eula:''' But not to worry, it's just training after all. Let's try again.

;(After completing the challenge)
:{{A|vo ellq002 8 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Well done. Your performance was most impressive.
:{{A|vo ellq002 8 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' And you managed to remain calm even in these grueling Dragonspine surroundings, haha. I'm starting to wonder if even I could have done the same.
:{{A|vo ellq002 8 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Given such an outstanding performance, it seems there is little left for me to teach you.
:{{A|vo ellq002 8 paimon 01a.ogg}} {{A|vo ellq002 8 paimon 01b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Like Paimon said, adventuring is our specialty!
:{{A|vo ellq002 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe... So that's it for our training, right? Then let's get out of Dragonspine before Paimon turns into a popsicle! *shivers*
:{{A|vo ellq002 8 eula 04a.ogg}} {{A|vo ellq002 8 eula 04b.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Hold on. I was commending (Traveler)'s performance just now. You, on the other hand, seem to have made no progress at all!
:{{A|vo ellq002 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? You mean, Paimon was also part of the training!?
:{{A|vo ellq002 8 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Yes, of course. You were frantically flying and dashing about throughout the entire thing. Not an elegant sight at all.
:{{A|vo ellq002 8 eula 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Did you even listen to anything I was trying to teach you?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe the weather is just too cold here.
::{{A|vo ellq002 8 paimon 04a a.ogg}} {{A|vo ellq002 8 paimon 04a b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, that's it, it's too cold here. B&mdash;Besides, Paimon was paying attention to the Traveler.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe that's just Paimon's style?
::{{A|vo ellq002 8 paimon 04b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, that's not true! Paimon was just focusing on you the whole time!
:{{A|vo ellq002 8 eula 07.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Whatever the reason, not heeding my instructions... a cause for vengeance, perhaps...
:{{A|vo ellq002 8 eula 08.ogg}} '''Eula:''' *sigh* Now, drink this.
:{{A|vo ellq002 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What is it? *gasp* Are you trying to poison Paimon!?
:{{A|vo ellq002 8 eula 09.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Certainly not. It's warm milk.
:{{A|vo ellq002 8 eula 10.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Didn't you say you were freezing? Drink it and it'll help warm you up.
:{{A|vo ellq002 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh... uh... thank you! Um, are you... still planning on the whole vengeance thing?
:{{A|vo ellq002 8 eula 11.ogg}} '''Eula:''' If I wasn't, then why would I care about you being cold? If you turned into a Paimon popsicle, that would ruin my plans for vengeance now, wouldn't it...
:{{A|vo ellq002 8 eula 12.ogg}} '''Eula:''' So, "dear friend"... don't die on me out here.
:{{A|vo ellq002 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh! Paimon knew something was off!
:{{DIcon}} Thank you for looking after Paimon.
::{{A|vo ellq002 8 eula 13a.ogg}} '''Eula:''' All in the name of vengeance, no need to thank me.
:{{DIcon}} You're... strange.
::{{A|vo ellq002 8 eula 13b.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Hehe, vengeance should know no bounds, you know...
:{{A|vo ellq002 8 eula 14.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Now then, given that your training is complete, it's time we return to Mondstadt. Our last step will be preparing a cordial gift to present to my uncle when you meet him.
:{{A|vo ellq002 8 eula 15.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I already have something in mind. Let's pay Sara a visit at Good Hunter.

;(Approach Good Hunter)
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 ambor 01.ogg}} '''[[Amber]]:''' Oh, hey Eula! I see you've met the Honorary Knight!
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We meet again, Amber! Seems we're just bound to run into you these days.
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Well, I just got back and was thinking about grabbing a bite at Good Hunter. But now that you're here, why don't we all eat together?
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Very well. It's been some time since we've last shared a meal together.
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Come, take a seat. We can discuss my uncle's gift while we eat.

:'''''Accepting Amber's invitation, you and Eula sit at the table.'''''

:{{A|vo ellq002 9 sara 01.ogg}} '''[[Sara]]:''' Yes, is there something else you'd like to order?
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Could you please prepare a serving of my uncle's favorite, Gebratenes Fleisch mit Sauerkraut? We'll take it as a gift to him later.
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 sara 02.ogg}} '''Sara:''' Coming right up! It'll take some time to prepare, I'll have it here at the counter once it's ready.
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 eula 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Hold on a moment. Is this [[Satisfying Salad]] also something that Amber ordered?
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 sara 03.ogg}} '''Sara:''' No, she didn't order it. But because she didn't order any vegetables, I thought I'd throw in a salad on the house. You know, to contrast all the meat dishes.
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 eula 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' So... we clearly didn't order this, yet you prepared it without authorization... Hmph! Mark my words, this transgression will not go unnoticed!
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... you're gonna take revenge on her giving us a free salad!?
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 sara 04.ogg}} '''Sara:''' Hmph, you should know me by now, that's the kind of villainous character I am!
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 sara 05.ogg}} '''Sara:''' Well then... please wait a moment while I get the dish for your uncle started.
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 eula 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Hmph, delicious unauthorized delicacies... Sara will pay for this.
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why would you choose Gebratenes Fleisch mit Sauerkraut as a gift for your uncle? Paimon's never even heard of that dish before...
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 eula 07.ogg}} '''Eula:''' This dish isn't actually on Good Hunter's menu. Only longstanding patrons such as my uncle would know about the dish. The old aristocrats seem to take a liking to it.
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Because of the sour flavor of the sauerkraut, not too many people are fond of it these days. I guess it's become less popular over time.
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 ambor 04.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Eula treated me to the dish once, and I couldn't even finish a bite. I've nicknamed it "Gebratenes Fleisch mit Vengeance" ever since. Yuck!
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 eula 08.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I never expected us to have such completely different tastes in food... If I weren't in such a good mood, I'd say that constitutes grounds for transgression...
:{{DIcon}} Huh, so even Amber doesn't escape your vengeance?
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 eula 09.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Of course not! It's hard to find someone in Mondstadt that attracts contempt as much as she does.
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 ambor 05.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Haha, it's fine when you're just joking between us, but I'm afraid our Honorary Knight might misunderstand you.
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 ambor 06.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Eula's always talking about vengeance, but that's just how she is. It's nothing you should take too seriously.
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 eula 10.ogg}} '''Eula:''' But I am serious! And I'll remember every transgression committed against me! Ugh, it's no wonder so many people dislike you!
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's starting to realize that Eula is actually a very good person.
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's no need to be so awkward when you want to say something nice.
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 eula 11.ogg}} '''Eula:''' *sigh* Listen, you've never been labeled as a social pariah, have you?
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What... well... no...?
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 eula 12.ogg}} '''Eula:''' So that's why you wouldn't understand how hard it is for a bad person to try to be good. It's impossible for me, and I have no intention of acting like a good person.
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 eula 13.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Alright, no need to look so sullen... I'm just kidding. Come on, let's eat. The food is getting cold.

:'''''After an awkward pause, everyone resumes cheerfully chatting and enjoys the meal.'''''

:{{A|vo ellq002 9 ambor 07.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Ooh, I'm stuffed. I'll see Sara about the bill.
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 eula 14.ogg}} '''Eula:''' No need, I've left the Mora under the plate. If you try to settle it with her in person, she won't accept payment for the salad.
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 eula 15.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Don't underestimate my ability to exact revenge. Hah! Sara won't get the upper hand this time!
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 eula 16.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Alright, next you should pay my uncle a visit. He has a small camp at the top of the mountain near [[Springvale]]. He usually whiles his time away there when there's nothing else to do.
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Aren't you coming with us, Eula?
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 eula 17.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I'm afraid that wouldn't be very convenient for me. It'd be better if you two went alone.
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 eula 18.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Ah yes, please do remember to pick up the dish from Sara.
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 ambor 08.ogg}} '''Amber:''' I still have more recon to do in the wilderness. Well, until next time!
:{{A|vo ellq002 9 eula 19.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Let's meet again. What an interesting bunch you are.

;(Talk to Sara)
:{{A|vo ellq002 10 sara 01.ogg}} '''Sara:''' Here, the Gebratenes Fleisch mit Sauerkraut is ready to go! Be sure to eat it while it's hot, otherwise the flavor will be spoiled.
:{{A|vo ellq002 10 sara 02.ogg}} '''Sara:''' And by the way, don't worry too much when Eula says strange things. She's actually a very good person.
:{{A|vo ellq002 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's been meaning to ask... No one could stand the sight of Eula when she was trying to speak with the others in Mondstadt earlier.
:{{A|vo ellq002 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But she seemed to get alone fine with you and Amber just now... what's up with that?
:{{A|vo ellq002 10 sara 03.ogg}} '''Sara:''' The people of Mondstadt don't take kindly to anyone bearing the Lawrence name.
:{{A|vo ellq002 10 sara 04.ogg}} '''Sara:''' They are unable to see past her family, therefore they don't really see Eula for herself.
:{{A|vo ellq002 10 sara 05.ogg}} '''Sara:''' So no matter what Eula tries to do, it's seen as a wrongdoing. It essentially strips the meaning of anything she tries to accomplish.
:{{DIcon}} I think I understand now.
:{{DIcon}} So that's what she meant when she said it was hard for "a bad person to try to be good."
:{{A|vo ellq002 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How come you're able to see Eula differently then?
:{{A|vo ellq002 10 sara 06.ogg}} '''Sara:''' Well, when she joined the Knights of Favonius, it caused quite an uproar.
:{{A|vo ellq002 10 sara 07.ogg}} '''Sara:''' Many people signed a petition, demanding that the Knights reverse their decision.
:{{A|vo ellq002 10 sara 08.ogg}} '''Sara:''' At the same time, numerous members of the Lawrence Clan crowded the entrance of the Knights of Favonius Headquarters, clamoring for Eula to give an explanation.
:{{A|vo ellq002 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa... so both sides were unhappy.
:{{A|vo ellq002 10 sara 09.ogg}} '''Sara:''' That's right. So, you can imagine how determined Eula must have been under such circumstances.
:{{A|vo ellq002 10 sara 10.ogg}} '''Sara:''' But thanks to Grand Master [[Varka]] and the unwavering attitudes of others in the Knights of Favonius, they were able to quell the unrest. Tensions still remain beneath the surface, I'm afraid.
:{{A|vo ellq002 10 sara 11.ogg}} '''Sara:''' In the eyes of the people, she's a stain on the Knights of Favonius... and in the eyes of the Lawrence Clan, she's a disgrace to her family.
:{{A|vo ellq002 10 sara 12.ogg}} '''Sara:''' But she simply fulfills her duty as a Knight, silently helping one person after another, myself included.
:{{A|vo ellq002 10 sara 13.ogg}} '''Sara:''' People like Eula should be approached with care and understanding. She could stand to be treated a little more fairly.
:{{DIcon}} It's good that you're able to understand her.
:{{DIcon}} If only there were more people like you.
:{{A|vo ellq002 10 sara 14.ogg}} '''Sara:''' I believe a day will come when things will get better.
:{{A|vo ellq002 10 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Once everything's settled, we should go talk to Eula again. Paimon thinks we know how to communicate with her now.
:{{A|vo ellq002 10 sara 15.ogg}} '''Sara:''' I'm glad. I think that would make her very happy, though she might not ever admit it.
:{{A|vo ellq002 10 sara 16.ogg}} '''Sara:''' Take care. Please come again!
:;(Obtain [[Well-Packaged Gebratenes Fleisch mit Sauerkraut]] ×1)

;(Talk to Sara again)
:{{A|vo dialog ellq002 sara 01.ogg}} '''Sara:''' Please don't tell Eula a word of what I've said.
:{{A|vo dialog ellq002 sara 02.ogg}} '''Sara:''' She might think I'm being too nosy.
{{Dialogue end}}
