==Summary==
; A Tea Party Most Thorny

Walking around the [[Court of Fontaine]], [[Paimon]] suggests to the [[Traveler]] that they take a rest at the [[Spina di Rosula]] base underneath the city. A few days pass before [[Isadora]] arrives, telling the two that [[Neuvillette]] wishes to speak with them at [[Palais Mermonia]]. Neuvillette tells them that he has a situation on his hands, but allows the Traveler to decide whether or not they wish to help him in the matter.

Earlier, Neuvillette asks Furina that [[The Knave]] requested a meeting with her, which he recommends to decline due to the [[As Light Rain Falls Without Reason|recent events]] resulting in [[Tartaglia|Childe]]'s apprehension and detainment into the [[Fortress of Meropide]]. However, Furina decides to entertain the Knave's request as she believes that they needed to explain their actions and expresses confidence in Neuvillette's assistance, though Neuvillette points out that it could make the matters worse; nonetheless, he agrees to help.

Furina accepts the request and has the Knave arrive, who thanks her for her service to the [[House of the Hearth]] in part due to making the children's' lives better. However, she came specifically for Childe and requests his custody, though Neuvillette denies it since the trial had already concluded. She then suggests entering the Fortress of Meropide to check on his condition, though Neuvillette tells her that the prison operates outside of the court's jurisdiction but instead offer a proposal to her.

Back in the present, Neuvillette informs the two that Childe had also disappeared from the prison, though he is not sure as to where he went since there were no reports of him being seen outside the prison either. His proposal to the Knave was to have someone else investigate on her behalf, which she accepted with some hesitation. To enter the prison, he offers to press false charges on them, which they accept.

Arriving at [[Café Lutece]], Paimon stuffs herself in anticipation of poor food in the prison when the two run into [[Charlotte]]. Paimon accidentally mentions the prison, causing Charlotte to ask what they did. The Traveler manages to bluff their way out, though Charlotte asks them to help gather information about [[Wriothesley]] for a new story, as he was given the rare title of "Duke" and that there's virtually no information about him.

Neuvillette accompanies them to the prison's entrance, where he hands them off to the guards; the charges against the Traveler and Paimon are eating cake meant for Furina (which he had offered them earlier) and that they are to spend 45 days in prison as punishment.

;Fortress of Meropide

Inside the fortress, the Traveler and Paimon are escorted by [[Deakin]], who explains about life in the prison, mostly the [[Credit Coupons]] which serve as the prison's currency. When they arrive at the actual entrance, the three are greeted by a large number of [[Gardemek]]s and Wriothesley himself, who takes over the rest of the prison tour. During the tour, they run into [[Lyney]], though he pretends to brush them off as an illusion. Finally, they head to the infirmary and meet [[Sigewinne]], concluding the tour.

As the two are led to the dormitory, the Traveler and Paimon talk about Lyney's presence, thus concluding that they too are also investigating the prison and resolve to meet with him the next day. After doing some work, they meet up with Lyney and [[Lynette]], who threw themselves in prison with a small "theft" performance to do so. Lyney, not wanting to hide any more secrets following his [[Prelude of Blancheur and Noirceur|previous experience with them]], reveals that the prison hides a secret and that "Father" was able to confirm that Furina did not have the {{Hydro}} [[Gnosis]]. Therefore, they should focus on learning about the "forbidden zone". As they have their meal, [[Vidoc]] heads to them, telling them not to break any "hidden rules" and that they should speak to him when they get more coupons.

Once their meal is finished, the two return to the dorms and sleep, while the Traveler has a flashback of Childe's time in the prison.

;The Proscribed, Hidden in Plain Sight

The next day, the Traveler informs Paimon of the dream they had of Childe. They decide to learn about the "rules", exploring the facilities that the prison has to offer. During their investigation, they learn two of the "rules"; working for three days straight would result in being served mystery meat and that it was not allowed to bet on two fighters in a match. After acquiring all they could for the day, the Traveler realizes that they aren't related to Childe and take a rest.

;Lost in Deep Seas

Having acquired enough coupons, the Traveler and Paimon approach Vidoc and ask him about the "hidden rules". He tells them to avoid the pipes late in the night, as there are rumors of cannibals preying on victims and turning them into other "forms". They prepare to investigate the new rule after lunch, where they discover Vidoc missing, but other people nearby. They ask them, but are refused, leaving them suspicious.

Needing another angle, they instead approach [[Fielding]] and tell him that they have trouble sleeping at night due to strange sounds. He confirms this, having heard rumors from his colleagues that they happen during pipe-cleaning days they have every month, with one of them happening tonight. They then return to the dormitory and sleep, where the Traveler gets a vision of Childe and realize that he used the pipes to escape.

Following the pipes, they find the three people from before, who admit that the "hidden rules" were a farce to protect Childe. They had originally viewed him with disdain, but he proved them wrong with his strength and decided to follow him. One day, he told them he had to leave as he heard that "voice" again, escaping through the pipes, though he had not returned for some time. They approach the entrance to where he left, but find it completely flooded.

With this new information, the Traveler decides to have Lyney ask [[Freminet]] to help in the task. Paimon is puzzled as to Childe's behavior, but is confident that they'll get to the bottom of the situation in no time.
