'''Swords''' are one of the five [[weapon]] types that [[characters]] can use in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''.

==Normal Attacks==
A Sword user's Normal Attack chain typically consists of 3-5 fast melee attacks with relatively short reach.

==Charged Attacks==
A Sword user's Charged Attack has a small windup before performing 2 fast, arcing attacks in front of them with high [[knockback]] and wide AoE. There are three notable exceptions to this pattern: [[Jean]]'s upward thrust ([[Favonius Bladework]]), [[Ayaka]]'s AoE scan attack ([[Kamisato Art: Kabuki]]) and [[Ayato]]'s forward lunge ([[Kamisato Art: Marobashi]]).

Most Sword users move forward during their Charged Attacks. However, exceptions are [[Keqing]], [[Kaeya]], and [[Albedo]] who move backward, as well as [[Ayaka]] and [[Nilou]] who do not move.

Sword Charged Attacks typically cost 20 Stamina. Keqing's Charged Attack however, costs 25 Stamina.

==Plunging Attacks==
Sword Plunging Attacks are considered [[Blunt Attack]]s. All Sword users have similar animations when plunging, which involves them striking downward with their sword.
