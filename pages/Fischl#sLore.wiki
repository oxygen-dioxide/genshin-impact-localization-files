==Personality==
{{Quote|A mysterious girl who calls herself "Prinzessin der Verurteilung" and travels with a night raven named Oz.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
Due to her upbringing as a child, Fischl is obsessed with fantasy stories and roleplays as a benevolent princess. She speaks in a polite and formal manner to all, which greatly confuses those who interact with her. For this purpose, Oz ends up translating most of her speech if they are confused. She is so used to speaking this way that breaking character ends up confusing the people she talks to just as much as staying in character. Fischl has a knack for investigating in part due to her own theories and Oz, which has allowed her to quickly climb up the ranks of the Adventurers' Guild. Even when her ideas sound outlandish, such as claiming a meteor shower to be the result of a curse, Oz is quick to ask others not to underestimate her intuition, as her instincts are very keen.

Outside of guild duties, many people view her strangely due to her her antics and roleplay, while this sometimes bothers her, she continues roleplaying regardless because it's her passion. She has very few friends and appreciates those who are willing to go along with her despite her eccentricities.

Outside of roleplaying, she is a kind and well-behaved yet bashful girl. She gets along well with her parents, even if she doesn't spend much time with them or they disagree with some of her decisions. Lisa, who generally gets in a bad mood when people neglect the books they borrow from the library, states that Fischl always keeps the books she borrows in good condition and returns them early. She cares about her friends and peers, even if not particularly close, showing concern about the well-being of her "retinue" (Fellow Adventurers' Guild members). When she unintentionally breaks character or reveals something about herself, she often gets flustered. She tends not to dwell too much on the past, trying to see herself as Fischl, not as her true identity, who she considers a different person, as thinking of her past brings her sadness. Deep down, she can also be quite self-deprecating and insecure, having a hard time taking setbacks well, this can cause her to cling to the escapism and comfort of her persona.

{{Quote|Face this false world with pride, my daughter. Enact the 'truth' within your heart.|[[Flowers for Princess Fischl]] - Final Chapter: Princess Tears and Sinful Saints}}

Fischl, {{tt|Prinzessin der Verurteilung|German for "Princess of Condemnation"}} of the outer realm [[Immernachtreich]], and her kin, the night-bringing raven. Answering the call of destiny, we have descended upon [[Teyvat]].

Fischl introduces herself to every member of the [[Adventurers' Guild]] in this way.

Due to her shared vision with the raven Oz, Fischl was able to join the Adventurers' Guild and become an investigator with ease.

Initially, it gave members of the Guild great difficulty to comprehend what Fischl was saying. But thanks to her tireless toil, and Oz's industrious interpretation, everyone was finally able to understand her.

Though eccentric in word and deed, this investigator's reconnaissance is swift and her intelligence accurate, traits that allowed her to gradually win everyone's trust.

It helps that Fischl is also a very kind person.

"[[Oz]], my familiar... spread your wings that eclipse the sun, and keep watch over the one to whom ill fate clings like a shroud."

"Yes, {{tt|mein Fr√§ulein|German for "my Lady"}}."

Today, Fischl shall also show concern for the masses of the Adventurers' Guild in her own manner.

That chap could eat me for breakfast! Well, I'm so puny I probably wouldn't even get caught between his teeth, but... Anyway, I don't want to die!"</p><p>"Hmph! You are supposed to be my familiar. Not everyone gets to be the Prinzessin der Verurteilung's familiar, do you understand? Consider it your honor to dedicate your life to serving me!"</p><p>Fischl is able to see through Oz's eyes.

She only landed the coveted position of Investigator at age fourteen in the first place because her parents managed to persuade the [[Cyrus|guild master]].</p><p>Then again, would they really have had to do much persuading?

As you have requested, prepare to receive the great wisdom of the prinzessin" would be "I'll look into that and let you know ASAP";</p><p>"Rejoice! O, ye servants who long for the blessing of the prinzessin; venture now deep into the battlefield with hearts of the tiger" means that the initial investigative work has been completed;</p><p>"All has been written in this tome of dark prophecies" simply means that her journal has been updated with the latest reports.</p><p>However, the "Fischl Dictionary" is actually just an in-joke, not a real book.</p><p>Those who are familiar with Fischl concentrate on what she means to say, not the way in which she says it; she notices this and takes it as a sign of true respect.</p><p>"Aha! So you do understand. Then fate does indeed bring kindred spirits together."</p><p>Those who manage to adopt her speech mannerisms when they respond to her will find she is both delighted and bashful, and praises their language-learning ability.</p><p>"A prinzessin should always give praise where praise is due...

==Trivia==
* Fischl is one of the characters with ornaments that glow.
** {{Transclude|Dunkelnacht Sakrament|Glowing Ornaments}}
** {{Transclude|Ein Immernachtstraum|Glowing Ornaments}}
* Fischl's eyepatch and raven familiar are most likely inspired by the Norse god, Odin.
* Her chosen name in full is Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort. It is mentioned in her fourth character story, a cutscene during the [[Unreconciled Stars]] event, and her [[Mail/Day of Destiny... (2021-05-27)|2021 birthday mail]].
* Despite Fischl taking on Oz's form when using her [[Midnight Phantasmagoria|Elemental Burst]], her [[Genius Invokation TCG]] [[Fischl (Character Card)|Character Card]]'s unique Dynamic Skin animation (only seen when using her Elemental Burst) shows her shooting Oz from her bow, before returning to her usual pose.
* While Fischl's behavior and mannerisms are currently ascribed to roleplaying, there are suggestions that her claims have some credibility, or that the "Flowers for Princess Fischl" series from which she derives her persona is less fictional than believed:
** Fischl is one of the few currently playable characters who acknowledges (or even seems aware) that the Traveler is from another world.
** Fischl's favorite food is "Mitternachtsbrot des Sommernachtgartens" (Midnight Bread of the Summer Night Garden). The Sommernachtgarten is an actual place in Mondstadt, now known as [[Midsummer Courtyard]], which was buried underground with the fall of the ancient civilization.
* [[Lisa]] and Fischl share the same Korean voice actress, Park GoWoon.
* Fischl, along with [[Keqing]], was introduced to a [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Fischl|crossover event]] in ''{{w|Honkai Impact 3rd}}'' v4.9.<ref>Twitter: [https://twitter.com/HonkaiImpact3rd/status/1395351097846505474 Honkai Impact 3rd x Genshin Impact Crossover Event]</ref>
* Fischl is one of the four playable characters in the game to wear an eyepatch, the other three being [[Kaeya]], [[Beidou]], and [[Chevreuse]].
** The description of the [[Blooming Hedge]] furniture item indirectly mentions Fischl, and also implies that she frequently snaps her eyepatches.
* According to [[Alfry]], Fischl is an excellent investigator.
* Fischl is known by these aliases or titles:
** Ruler of the Ashen Darkness
** Mein Fr√§ulein (by Oz)
** Your Highness/Her Highness (by Mona and Traveler)
* {{Furnishing Mentions|Fischl}}

===Etymology===
* Fischl's name derives from the German word {{de|Fisch|fish}} plus the diminutive suffix {{de|-el}}. Thus, her name means "little fish."
* In the English version, Fischl uses many German phrases:
** Fischl's title, "{{de|Prinzessin der Verurteilung}}," is German for "Princess of Condemnation."
*** Her title is likely derived from the name of the Divine Halberd made by the God King in the book ''[[Legend of the Shattered Halberd (VI)]]''. As an avid reader, she may have read the whole series and taken the title for herself.
** Her full name, Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort, translates to "Fischl of the Sky Castle Narfidort."
*** "{{de|Luftschloss}}" is a German phrase for "pipe dream" or an imaginary place. Her name also indicates her royal status since {{de|von}} is usually only used in names of noble families.
** {{de|Immernachtreich}}, the realm where Fischl allegedly comes from, means "Realm of Eternal Night."
** "End Time {{de|Zersetzung}}," the title of the first volume of "Flowers for Princess Fischl," means "End Time Decomposition."<ref>Wiktionary, {{wt|Zersetzung}}</ref>
** She calls her Vision "{{de|Edelstein der Dunkelheit}}," which translates to "Gem of Darkness."
** Her left eye is her "Eye of Judgement" ("{{de|Auge der Verurteilung}}")<ref name="newchar">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/YPuUdLQdcxQ New Character Announcement - "Fischl can't lose just yet!"] (Official English subtitles)</ref>
* Her constellation, Corvus, is Latin for "The Raven."<ref>Wiktionary, {{wt|corvus||Latin}}</ref>
** In taxonomy, ''Corvus'' is the genus of the family ''Corvidae'', which covers the various species of crows. The binomial name for a raven is ''Corvus corax''.
* In the demonology grimoire ''{{w|The Lesser Key of Solomon}}'', "Amy" is a Great President of Hell in the ''Ars Goetia''.
