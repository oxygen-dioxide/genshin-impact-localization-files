::'''Clue Board:''' About the "flower that is not of this world"...
::{{DIcon}} Read Tighnari's letter
::::After our conversation the other day, I went over the prophecy's wording carefully. "A flower that is not of this world" sounds more like a logical paradox. Think about it: If a flower is not of this world, its existence cannot be perceived. However, if it can be perceived, it will not fit the description of the prophecy. As such, my view is that the riddle's answer doesn't have to be a real plant. However, I must also note, with all due respect, that the person who came up with this riddle may not know all the plants in the world (and I'd daresay that no one could make such a claim). From this perspective, you could even think of some rare plants as potential candidates for the answer.<br /><br />
::::Attached is a list of rare plant species. I've added a short description to each entry, and I hope you can find your answer within them.<br /><br />
::::Best wishes to you.<br /><br />
::::[[Tighnari]]
::;(Return to letter selection)
::{{DIcon}} Read Albedo's letter
::::"A flower that is not of this world" doesn't sound like an existing species or something created through specialized cultivation techniques. With that noted, I believe we should think out of the box. After reviewing what I've learned over the years, I have now reached a conclusion. Sucrose also came to discuss her thoughts with me. She hasn't yet decided on an answer at the moment of me writing this letter, so I won't be revealing my own conclusion right now. We can discuss it in detail when we meet, and I hope everyone else will bring their respective answers, too.<br /><br />
::::I'll see you then.<br /><br />
::::[[Albedo]]
::;(Return to letter selection)
::{{DIcon}} Read Sucrose's letter
::::It feels strange to insert a letter into the mailbox that I made myself, but I did find my answer.<br /><br />
::::At first, I thought that a flower created using alchemy would constitute one "that is not of this world" according to the prophecy. But after giving it some more thought, I realized that instead of creating an actual plant, a flower-shaped mechanism made of alchemical products might fit the description better.
::::So I arrived at my conclusion &mdash; a clock in the shape of a flower.<br /><br />
::::The long passage of life brushes past the timepiece, leaving fluttering petals in its wake. The elapsing years stir up the leaves, pushing the needle of time forward.<br /><br />

::::No one can confidently say that they will never get lost, but as long as their wish to guide and help others does not waver, they will become a ship that can traverse the waves eternally.<br /><br />
::::I didn't perform any divination before writing this letter, but I have a feeling that I will witness the truth behind the prophecy together with you all.<br /><br />

::::I've been thinking about this for a long time. Before you came to me with this prophecy, it never even crossed my mind that I could be a part of this. Well... as you all know, I'm probably the last person you'd think of when it comes to guiding others. I still have a long way to go, and I'm still trying to figure out how to peacefully coexist with everything in this world.<br /><br />
::::But if you're asking me about who can be of help, my friend Fischl and her friend Mona the astrologist are both very knowledgeable and brave. I'd say they're probably the ones you're looking for.<br /><br />
::::And that's my answer! Wishing you all good luck!<br /><br />

::::"Guide" is too grand a title for me, but I'd love to be everyone's friend. It's something I think I'm good at, and I'm an attentive listener, so do let me know when you feel lost! To use an analogy, I'm like a torch out in the wild that will help illuminate everyone's path so long as it continues to burn bright.<br /><br />
::::(Everything written below is not meant for Collei! Dear Collei, if you're reading this, please turn away!)<br /><br />
::::I've been worried about Collei lately. She's recovered from the illness, but she still doesn't look all that cheerful. It feels like... she still has things she can't let go of.<br /><br />
::::Allow me to write down my wish here: I hope that Collei can uncover the secret behind the prophecy and find her happiness. Wherever she is and whoever she becomes, I'll always be her friend no matter what.<br /><br />

::::I didn't expect to be asked such a question, which caused quite a headache at first... I only know how to guide people in the geological sense, but on the journey of life, I'm still the lost kid who needs the guidance of others.<br /><br />
::::But upon seeing your question, I immediately knew what I can help with. I tried drawing a map showing vegetation distribution for Mr. Tighnari and Ms. Collei, as well as a dragon-spotting calendar for Mr. Cyno. Both are attached below.<br /><br />
::::In the next few days, I will need to patrol with the Captain and draw maps for Ms. Lisa, so I can only support you with my well-wishes. My apologies! Please forgive me!<br /><br />

::{{DIcon}} Read Cyno's letter
::::You are correct to assume that I seldom lie. This has to do with my upbringing. As a desert-dweller who has been living within the Akademiya since my childhood, my unusual identity makes it hard for others to trust me &mdash; and it would have been harder still if I was not honest. As a result, I learned to talk less and speak no more than what is necessary.<br /><br />

::{{DIcon}} Read Rosaria's letter
::::I must make one thing clear first: I am not someone who would never lie.<br /><br />
::::After hearing your question, I thought about many things in the past in earnest and recalled many occasions upon which I lied.<br /><br />
::::I often make up excuses to avoid choir practice. I also tell white lies, too, sometimes to make myself happy, and other times, to allow myself to give up on some struggles.<br /><br />
::::The nicest lie I've ever come up with is the one I told Varka: That I didn't want to stay in Mondstadt. Varka responded with another lie &mdash; and that was his advice to me: "Your current abilities are not suited to life beyond Mondstadt's borders."<br /><br />
::::I can't be the answer to this question, but I suggest that you consider what "never lying" actually means.<br /><br />
::::Does it mean to never deceive, or to never lie with ill intent?<br /><br />
::::It's a pity that I'm not the one you're looking for, but I believe that someone who meets the requirements will turn up. Good luck.<br /><br />

;(Talk to Sucrose)
:{{A|vo eqfh103 3 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Let me quickly summarize what we've found out about "a flower that is not of this world."
:{{A|vo eqfh103 3 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Tighnari believes that on closer examination, it might be logically paradoxal, while Albedo says that his answer would be better discussed at length in person...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 3 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' As for my answer... I think a clock in the shape of a flower would constitute one "that is not of this world."
:{{A|vo eqfh103 3 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Here's what we've gathered regarding "a guide who will never get lost."
:{{A|vo eqfh103 3 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Mona said that she'd like to join us in uncovering the secret behind the prophecy, while Bennett suggests Fischl, Mona, or (Traveler) as potential candidates.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 3 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Mika didn't submit much, but he did draw a vegetation map for Master Tighnari and wrote up a dragon-spotting calendar for Cyno...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 3 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Amber also wrote in... She said that she sees herself as nobody's guide, but everybody's friend.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 3 sucrose 04.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' As for "one who would never lie"... Rosaria removed herself from consideration, but both Razor and Cyno are willing to support us in our search.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 3 sucrose 05.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Timaeus seems to have forgotten to write to us...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 3 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' And finally, this is what we've gathered on "a legend that never ends." Klee said that her mom has a number of friends who like to write storybooks...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 3 collei 06.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Lisa believes that legends live forever in people's hearts. I think that for a legend to be never-ending, it has to be filled with hopes and dreams, and actively passed from one person to the next.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... what're the answers to the four riddles then?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 3 collei 07.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Uhh... you're really smart, Paimon! I bet you can figure it all out in no time!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 3 sucrose 06.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Or... let's all share our thoughts on what we think the answers might be.
<!-- black screen transition -->
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 01.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Wait! *panting* ...Wait for me!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Oh, Timaeus! What brings you here?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 02.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' I'm sorry, I really am... the time just got away from me, and I didn't get around to writing that letter. However! I'm happy to announce that I think I can be the "one who would never lie"!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? This is kinda sudden!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Not that we don't trust you, Timaeus, but um... Could you elaborate a little? After you catch your breath...?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 03.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Of course, of course... Phew.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 04.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Do you still remember the time I, uh, ahem, collaborated with a certain Miss Ying'er?
:{{DIcon}} Rings a bell.
:{{DIcon}} Remind me.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 05.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Well basically, she helped me out a lot with my research into potion-making once, and we've stayed in touch through letters ever since...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, so Ying'er is the girl from Liyue that Sucrose mentioned earlier?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We always assumed you were hard at work every time we saw you at the Crafting Bench... So you've just been writing letters to Ying'er the whole time!?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 06.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' No! I mean, not ALL the time. I've done some work, too... And anyway, our correspondence covers a lot of serious topics! Like perfumes, potions, alchemy...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 07.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Anyway! A few months ago, I made a vow to the heavens that I will be true to myself and never utter an insincere word until the day that I've managed to win Miss Ying'er's heart!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... at Starsnatch Cliff, you were picking Cecilias as a gift for Ying'er?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 08.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' That's right! The Cecilia flower is said to represent a once-wayward heart transformed by the power of love. I couldn't think of a better flower to give than that.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 09.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' I know full well that Miss Ying'er is far more knowledgeable than I in both the ways of the world and the ways of our craft... But I thought I should make the effort for once, and put myself out there.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 10.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Ahem. Which brings me to the subject of the last few days, and the Windblume Festival... I thought it was time for me to invite Miss Ying'er to Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 11.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' But yesterday, Albedo told me that Sucrose has been working hard to help another girl achieve her dream...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 12.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' And when I went to take a look at our roster, I saw that she'd done my remaining work for me...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 13.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' I feel... incredibly guilty.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 14.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' I've been spending all of my time in my own fantasy world while everyone else has been bending over backwards to help other people. How could I ever hope to be worthy of Miss Ying'er's love if I'm so selfish?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Oh, Timaeus...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 15.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' And that's why I've decided to join you!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' But, then what about Ying'er...?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Yeah, haven't you been planning this for over a month now? You said you were gonna invite her to Mondstadt...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 16.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Yes... I did mention in my letters that I'd like her to visit. Which is why I just sent her another gift with my handpicked Windblumes, along with a handwritten letter.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 17.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' I explained that a matter of great importance has presented itself to which I must devote my full attention for the time being. As soon as it's resolved, I'll make haste to Liyue to pick her up in person.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 18.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' I made sure to package the gift and letter with the greatest care. All I can do now is hope that she'll understand...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 19.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' ...Point being, please know that I sincerely want to support you in this endeavor! Plus, I think I'm an honest person... As far as I recall, I don't think I've told a single lie in my life...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, you certainly convinced Paimon with that speech! Don't worry, Timaeus, we won't let your determination go to waste!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 sucrose 04.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' ...Thank you, Timaeus.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 20.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Ahh, thank you, everyone! I promise to do everything I can to help!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Okay, so it looks like we've found our "one who would never lie."
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! Let's keep it up, on to the other three!

:'''After some discussion, the group decides on a final pick for each part of the prophecy. Everyone gathers in front of the Crafting Bench.'''

:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, Paimon will do the honors! *clears throat*
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We have with us here the flower, the guide, the legend... and Timaeus.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 klee 01.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Huh? Why did you only say Timaeus's name? You should say my name, too!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, alright! We also have Klee.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' That's me! Hehehe~
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 mona 01.ogg}} '''Mona:''' With Klee here, this all somehow feels like we're getting ready for a field trip...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' There's nothing wrong with a more relaxed atmosphere, is there?
:{{DIcon}} Albedo, have you figured out your answer?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Of course. We will soon see if my hypothesis has any merit.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Actually... I'm still feeling a little nervous.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 21.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Me too...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But weren't you all fired up just a moment ago?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 timaeus 22.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Uh, yeah, you're right... Okay, let's do this!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 sucrose 05.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Actually, I'm a little worried too... Deep breaths... deep breaths!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I know what you're feeling... Saying anything becomes so much harder when there are so many people watching...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 mona 02.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Well, does anyone know the exact location of where we're headed? Or should I do a reading on my scryglass?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 collei 06.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Hmm, according to the prophecy, once we've figured out the answer, we should test it at the Lantern of Utmost Joy... Wait, but where is this lantern?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, we know something about that!
:{{DIcon}} I've already found out where it is.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 together 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose & Collei:''' What!?

:'''You make up a story about how you discovered the location by divining the wind...'''

:{{A|vo eqfh103 4 sucrose 07.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Wow, that's amazing! You really know how to do everything under the sun...

:{{A|vo eqfh103 6 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Hmm, now that I think about it, the prophecy didn't say anything about what the Lantern of Utmost Joy actually looks like, right? Maybe we've overlooked something?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 6 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' (Traveler), are you trying to figure out something else from the paper?
:{{DIcon}} Exactly.
:'''(Traveler):''' (Venti's note here says we should look up and seek the answer from the sky.)
:{{A|vo eqfh103 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's reading too... Huh, it says to look up?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But... But there's nothing above us! The wind didn't trick us, did it?

:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' So we just need to do as it says, right?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Wait a second.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What is it, Albedo?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' We'd better make sure this place is safe before taking our seats. Everyone, please stay clear for a moment.

:'''Everyone vigilantly watches as Albedo conducts a thorough investigation of the space...'''

:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, all our questions and doubts aside, the scenery here is pretty amazing! It'd be impossible to feel stressed here.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' How is everything, Albedo?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Hmm, everything seems to be fine. I didn't find any traps or suspicious mechanisms.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' But, I also couldn't find any overt destructive devices...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Huh? What do you mean...?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 albedo 05.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Well, it seems that wrong answers won't have any catastrophic consequences. Looks like we'll have to sit on these chairs and fulfill the prophecy.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 albedo 06.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Everyone, I would like to suggest that we try some risky answers on our first attempt. Let's reserve our most confident answers for the second round.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That sounds kind of smart... But why?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 timaeus 02.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Ah, I get what he means! If we do as he says, then we may be able to figure out how the puzzle works.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I see! That makes a lot of sense.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 mona 04.ogg}} '''Mona:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mona, is there something wrong? You're not looking too good.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 klee 02.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Oh, are you hungry? I brought some snacks...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 mona 05.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Thank you for offering, Klee, but that's not quite it!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 mona 06.ogg}} '''Mona:''' While Albedo was checking just now, I gave my scryglass a spin, hoping to find some information...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 mona 07.ogg}} '''Mona:''' But there's a strange aura to this place. It's almost as if someone has been staring at me as soon as we stepped foot in here.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 mona 08.ogg}} '''Mona:''' But if nothing here has actually been physically tampered with, then... No... Could that person be...
:'''(Traveler):''' (Mona just shivered... Did she sense some kind of great power?)
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 klee 03.ogg}} '''Klee:''' What do you mean, Mona? Who could it be?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 mona 09.ogg}} '''Mona:''' ...Ugh, never mind. It's not like I've got any proof.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! Don't leave us on the edge like this, Mona!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 klee 04.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Hmm... I'll just do what Albedo said!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 albedo 07.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Yes, let's test the hypothesis together, Klee.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Mhm! C'mon, join us, Mona!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 mona 10.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Oh... Alright.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Okay... Then I'll answer the first question. If someone were to ask me to find "a flower that is not of this world"...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' You can do it, Sucrose!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Umm...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 sucrose 04.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Then I would fetch a Tetratanic Sweet Flower!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 collei 06.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Alright, I'm up next... My part of the prophecy is to find "a guide who will never get lost."
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 sucrose 05.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' (Collei... I hope you found your answer...)
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 collei 07.ogg}} '''Collei:''' *sigh*...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 collei 08.ogg}} '''Collei:''' My answer is... that I will be that guide.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 collei 09.ogg}} '''Collei:''' For a long time, I have been guided by others. It's taken me a while, but I've finally made it to where I am today.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 collei 10.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Although I still haven't made a name for myself, and I'm still quite immature, I... I would still like to put my name forward, because I would like to become a guide that can help others.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 collei 11.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I want to help others the same way Amber, Master Tighnari, Cyno, and everyone else helped me. Now it's my turn to pass on the gift that I've been given.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 timaeus 03.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Alright, it's up to me to answer the third part. I&mdash;I'll submit myself as "one who would never lie."
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 timaeus 04.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Although I've never really had any other virtues or talents, I'm confident that I've always been an honest person.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 timaeus 05.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' I&mdash;I'd like to thank everyone, too, for giving me this opportunity to validate myself.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 mona 11.ogg}} '''Mona:''' And last but not least, I will answer the final part of the prophecy.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 mona 12.ogg}} '''Mona:''' There's no tale more befitting the title of "a legend that never ends" than our fates as human beings.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, the Lantern just lit up!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, all four sides of the Lantern are glowing!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 collei 12.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Huh? But...
:{{DIcon}} But all we did was submit a batch of test answers...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 albedo 08.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Collei, could I ask you to stand up for a second?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 collei 13.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh, a&mdash;alright...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 albedo 09.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? What's going on?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why is it lighting up regardless of who's sitting in the chair? Didn't it say we have to answer all the questions correctly?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 albedo 10.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' It's pretty clear now, isn't it? We've just proven that there is no "right answer" for this prophecy.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 sucrose 06.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' No right answer? But how could that be...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 albedo 11.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Although the instructions had come from an old and enigmatic prophecy, it is in fact nothing like the ancient mechanism that we had all imagined it to be. I believe the lantern only serves as a simple signal...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Ah, and to think, I never expected you to actually find this place...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 timaeus 06.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' What!? There's someone else here?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 02.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' We meet again, Traveler.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey... you're that outlander we met the other day at Good Hunter.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 03.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' It's all thanks to you that I was able to find this place. Good thing that you were too preoccupied with the prophecy to notice someone tailing you from the shadows.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 albedo 12.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Oh, is that so? Then why do I spy yet another person following in your shadow?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 04.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' ...Wait, really!?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 rosaria 01.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 rosaria 02.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' There's no need for pleasantries. You should know I'm here for you.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 05.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' Is it just because I'm a visitor from abroad?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 rosaria 03.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' I was there when you snuck your way into Marjorie's place.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 06.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' Heh, so you had your eyes on me even then, huh? That was two whole weeks ago, you know.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 rosaria 04.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' It's hard not to notice you when I'm on duty every day.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 07.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' Alright, in that case, I'll admit it. I was the person who slipped this prophecy into the storybook.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 collei 14.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Huh? But why? Then... does that mean... this wasn't a real prophecy after all?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 08.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' Don't worry. Even though you probably have plenty of reservations about me, you can be sure that the prophecy is genuine.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 09.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' In fact, many of you here today may have heard the codename of the one who left the prophecy to me.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 10.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' She hailed from an ancient assembly of powerful women, each of whom used a single letter to signify themselves.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 mona 13.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Who would've guessed... It seems that power was indeed left behind by the old hag after all...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 11.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' Ah, so you're B's student. It's an honor to meet you. I am Scarlett, the successor of J.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 sucrose 07.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Wh&mdash;What are you talking about?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 12.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' It's a long story, but I'm not quite sure that I'm the best person to tell it.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 13.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' Since you've all spent so much time and energy trying to decipher this prophecy, you must also be very interested in the secret behind this lantern, no?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 14.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' The lantern has already been lit. Now then... "Please allow me to disturb your happy peace."
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 01.ogg}} '''???:''' ...Huh? Why did this little thing just light up? How strange...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 15.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' Hello? On the other side of the lantern... can you hear me over there?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 klee 06.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Mom?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Hmm? Oh, I hear many youthful voices...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 16.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' Madam, I am Scarlett, the successor of J.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Oh, ahem! Since we've last gathered, J's successor has already become so reckless and bold. Unbelievable...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 mona 14.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Wait wait wait, why are you talking just like the old hag!?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 04.ogg}} '''???:''' Old hag? Who would dare say that... Is that Mona?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 mona 15.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Who are you! Who dares imitate my master!?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 05.ogg}} '''???:''' Ahem... Hmph, and what of imitation and mimicry? It has always been a fool's errand to mimic and learn from humanity...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 albedo 13.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Aunt Alice. I'm here too.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 klee 07.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Moooom! Why are you trying to talk like other people?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 06.ogg}} '''???:''' Hehehe... so I see everyone's here. Well then, my warmest greetings, everyone!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 mona 16.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Miss Alice, why would you...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 07.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Well, it's been many years since this Lantern last lit up! You can't blame me for thinking that one of the old friends from my youth may have decided to catch up again...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, why's she sound so coy all of a sudden...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 08.ogg}} '''Alice:''' And if I recall correctly, we left this lantern in the care of the Anemo Archon, Barbatos... Hmm, you must be commended for uncovering an artifact entrusted to the God of Wind himself.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 09.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Tell me, are you sitting around my beloved tea party table?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 klee 08.ogg}} '''Klee:''' It's a reeeeeeeally long table!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 10.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Oho, so you are... I suppose this means even the Anemo Archon has granted you entry to this place. Was all of this Scarlett's doing?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait wait, Paimon's completely lost now... So what was this "assembly" you were talking about earlier?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 17.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' Miss Alice, would it be alright to leave the explanation of that to you?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 11.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Hehe, well, you should be rewarded for making it all the way up here and activating the lantern. Now then, let me tell you a long and ancient story...
;(A cinematic plays)
::'''Alice:''' Ever heard of the Hexenzirkel? As the spooky name suggests, it's a secret society
::'''Alice:''' Once upon a time, it even challenged the Anemo Archon himself. But he replied:
::'''Alice:''' "Let us make music, not war, and resolve our conflicts through song"
::'''Alice:''' From then on, the mages would only ever convene
::'''Alice:''' In the woods, in the skies, or on the edges of cliffs
::'''Alice:''' At these tea parties, they discussed their stories and secrets and resolved their differences
::'''Alice:''' As the tea and cakes bore witness to their pledge never to fight amongst themselves
::'''[[I. Ivanovna N.]]:''' Yesterday, I snuffed out the life of my beloved
::'''I. Ivanovna N.:''' He had grown old and was extremely sick
::'''I. Ivanovna N.:''' He loved me dearly, so I took his fate in my hands, and ended his pain
::'''[[Rhinedottir]]:''' I'm raising a son
::'''Rhinedottir:''' Of all the children I had, he's the only one left
::'''Rhinedottir:''' But I suppose that still makes me a mother?
::'''[[Andersdotter]]:''' My lifespan is nothing compared to yours
::'''Andersdotter:''' So I wish to leave you with my storybook
::'''Andersdotter:''' Actually, maybe you can pass it on to your children one day
::'''[[Barbeloth]]:''' Ooh, this looks interesting. Let me scry!
::'''Alice:''' My dear sisters, we mustn't let prophecies threaten our bonds of friendship
::'''Alice:''' Even the most frightening witch was once a little girl
::'''Alice:''' And growing up can be so tough...
::'''Alice:''' Sometimes, we all need to vent our troubles to the wind
::'''Alice:''' Even if the nations go to war
::'''Alice:''' Or the sky falls down
::'''Alice:''' The mages' tea parties shall forever be held around this table
:;(Cinematic ends)
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, so this is where the legendary mages held their meetings.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 12.ogg}} '''Alice:''' That's right! We often met here to chat and have tea.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 collei 15.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Th&mdash;Then what about the part saying that if we light the lantern of utmost joy, we'd receive a supreme blessing?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 13.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Ah, about that... Ehehe, I never expected anyone other than J to actually read the full contents of that prophecy. It's a little embarrassing...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 14.ogg}} '''Alice:''' The truth is, that prophecy was actually just a letter that we sent to J as a group the day before her wedding.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 albedo 14.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Hmm, so it was indeed written by all of you.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 15.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Hehe, I must thank you for resisting the urge to immediately reveal the truth to everybody, Albedo. Knowing you, you probably figured out everything the moment you laid eyes on the message.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 albedo 15.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' No, it took me a little longer than that.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 16.ogg}} '''Alice:''' "A flower that is not of this world"... "A guide who will never get lost"... "One who would never lie"... And "a legend that never ends." These four descriptions signify four individual mages.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 17.ogg}} '''Alice:''' When a member of the organization had to leave the group to spend the rest of her days with her beloved, the other mages would write down this prophecy and send it to her to invite her for a final get-together.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 18.ogg}} '''Alice:''' "A flower that is not of this world" signifies, of course, flowers that do not naturally exist in this world. This is the signature of R, full name Rhinedottir, also known as "Gold."
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 19.ogg}} '''Alice:''' If there's anyone in this world who could create a flower species that does not yet exist, it would be her.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 20.ogg}} '''Alice:''' The "guide who will never get lost" is N, otherwise known as Nicole. You may have not encountered her yet, but she is a truly extraordinary woman who has made this world's direction and order her subject of study.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 21.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Some of you may be fortunate enough to have already heard her voice. Like a prophetess, she will only speak to guide people toward the truth when a change has occurred in the world.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 22.ogg}} '''Alice:''' She has a tendency to... suddenly speak in someone's mind without any warning.
;(If Inversion of Genesis was completed)
::'''(Traveler):''' (Huh! Could she have been the one who spoke to me while we were investigating (Wanderer)...?)
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 23.ogg}} '''Alice:''' If one day, you would be unfortunate enough to run into a truly dangerous situation, she may use her voice to guide the way forward for you.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 mona 17.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Who would have guessed that there are so many mysterious women in this world, and that they would all know each other...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 24.ogg}} '''Alice:''' The "one who would never lie" is... me. I hope no one would take offense &mdash; it's just that I, Alice, or "A" for short, have always had a soft spot for those with sincerity and candor.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 25.ogg}} '''Alice:''' As for "a legend that never ends"... You may not know M in person, but you've likely encountered one of her works. Have any of you ever read "The Boar Princess"?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 sucrose 08.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Huh? I'm pretty sure every child in Mondstadt has read that book.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 26.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Hehe, it's also one of my favorite stories. M was an exceptional human writer who used her prose to teach me the meaning of grief.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 27.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Don't you think such a person would deserve a seat at the mages' table?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's getting more and more lost...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 18.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' It may sound hard to believe, but I can attest to everything that Alice has said. J was also a mortal who aged and passed on, leaving her title to her students and followers.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 19.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' Alice... You've never acknowledged any of J's successors. It's now been centuries since the first of us took on her mantle. I've always wanted to meet you.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 28.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Do you also want to become a mage?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 20.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' Title aside, I think I'm more interested in the meaning and purpose of the Hexenzirkel.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 21.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' I used to think that the Hexenzirkel was a group of women who could control the very fate of this world. But now... I've seen for myself that besides J, many other ordinary people were also among you.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 29.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Do you think less of us now?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 22.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' No, not at all. My interest has been piqued, and I'm now even more drawn towards the idea of becoming a mage.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 30.ogg}} '''Alice:''' You're right, I've never acknowledged any of J's successors, but you are different. You are much more fascinating than any of your predecessors.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 albedo 16.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Oh, has someone finally piqued Aunt Alice's interest?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 31.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Now is not a good time, Scarlett, but as soon as I am able, I will seek you out for a meeting. I want you to tell me all about J's married life back in her hometown.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, the mage who received the prophecy letter from all of you was J? She left the Hexenzirkel after getting married?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 32.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Precisely. There was only one way the letter could have been interpreted. She would have known what we meant as soon as she saw the message. We were just asking one thing of her...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 33.ogg}} '''Alice:''' "Please come to see us again. Before you go and settle forever with your happiness, please come share some of it with your best friends and sisters."
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 collei 16.ogg}} '''Collei:''' So, the "supreme blessing" actually meant...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 34.ogg}} '''Alice:''' All journeys are fleeting, and will eventually come to an end. What will give us the most fulfillment and happiness in the end are those who will greet us at our journey's destination.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 35.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Dear child, I believe you can also understand what I am talking about. We women will always have many troubles, and encounter pains and frustrations that will keep us up at night.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 36.ogg}} '''Alice:''' But no matter how hard things may become, we will cross mountains and oceans to see our best friends again... Regardless of how many years have passed, or how far the distance may be...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 37.ogg}} '''Alice:''' As long as we can be with our beloved friends, our hearts will be filled with joy. To us mages, that's what being "supremely blessed" is all about.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 collei 17.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 klee 09.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Uh, I still don't really get it, but I do know that all the mages are Mom's best friends!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 38.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Hehehe... If you ask how I see it, the Hexenzirkel is just a group of ladies that I spent my youth with.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 39.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Anyway, I'll introduce some of the other members to you all later. I still have a few things to attend to, so this will have to do for today.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 klee 10.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Bye, Mom! Dodoco says bye too!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 40.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Goodbye, darling! And farewell to all of our other friends as well. I'm sure we'll see each other again.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 41.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Ah, now that I think of it, isn't it getting close to... that time of year?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 mona 18.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Yes, it's Windblume again, Alice.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 scarlett 23.ogg}} '''Scarlett:''' It's also a special anniversary date. I'm sure you still remember...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 42.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Yes, I do remember now. It was on this day, many, many years ago, that J tied the knot.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 8 alice 43.ogg}} '''Alice:''' Ah, just in time for the festival of love and freedom. Everyone, please enjoy this year's Windblume festival to the fullest.

:'''Alice's voice fades, and the lantern grows dim. It is once again just a regular piece of decor.'''

:'''For a moment, everyone looks lost in thought, but soon, chatter begins to fill the space again. Before long, everyone spreads their gliders to return to Mondstadt.'''

:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 timaeus 02.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm just... a little glidersick, that's all.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' You may want to look into getting your own gliding license when you have the time. It might prove helpful to you.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 timaeus 03.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Ah, okay... sure thing...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' It sounds like you've still got something on your mind... Why don't you tell us, we're all happy to listen!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 timaeus 04.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' *sigh* It's nothing, really, it's just... Well, Alice's story WAS really interesting and romantic, I won't argue about that.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 timaeus 05.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' But still... the whole thing wasn't quite what I was hoping for.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 timaeus 06.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Of course, I didn't actually expect the supreme blessing to be real, but... *sigh*
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Ah, don't say that! None of this was your fault, Timaeus. Honestly, it's more on me for having agreed to be the Windblume Festival Special Ambassador. Had I not asked for everyone's help...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' If anything, it should be my fault for finding that prophecy...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 timaeus 07.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' No no no, I didn't mean to blame the two of you either! I just feel like... this whole adventure didn't really end on a high note, and we also didn't really get anything out of it.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Hmm... But I'd say we still learned something new.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 03.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Well, that aside, Timaeus... You still need to go to Liyue to apologize to Ying'er, right? Do you want Collei and I to accompany you?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 timaeus 08.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Oh, Miss Ying'er... Well... I mean, I just really don't want her to get mad at me! Now that I've come back to my senses, I really don't know what I should do...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Hey, you three... You may want to look over there.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 timaeus 09.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Hmm?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 timaeus 10.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' M&mdash;Miss Ying'er!?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 04.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Oh, so that's Miss Ying'er!? I've never met her before...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, that's her! And she actually came all the way to Mondstadt...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 timaeus 11.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Ah, I'm so sorry, Miss Ying'er... But how did you... I mean...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 yinger 01.ogg}} '''Ying'er:''' Hehe, are you so happy just to see me?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 timaeus 12.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' I, uh... of course I am! I'm so happy that... I don't, uh... Sorry, I don't know what to say...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 yinger 02.ogg}} '''Ying'er:''' I was ready to give you a harsh scolding, but now that I've seen you like this, I suppose I could let you off the hook this time.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 yinger 03.ogg}} '''Ying'er:''' You said you couldn't come to pick me up because of a very important matter, right? Well then, of course I had to come and find you instead.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe... should we go see how they're doing?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 mona 01.ogg}} '''Mona:''' I wouldn't. You'll get hit by a forest boar if you interrupt a couple's romantic conversation.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh really? Uh, we'll just leave them alone then.
:'''(Traveler):''' (They look quite happy... Maybe that's what Windblume's all about.)

:'''Their adventure has come to an end. Everyone bids farewell, and soon, only a few people are left standing by the crafting bench...'''

:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 05.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I am so glad to see Timaeus find his happiness...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 04.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I have to say, I'm even more envious of you, Sucrose...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 05.ogg}} '''Collei:''' You can be happy just to see others happy, and you gave me so much help without any expectations in return... Even though you said that we're very much alike, I still feel like you have a much bigger heart than I do.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 06.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' But if you say that, then I'd say I'm also nowhere near as brave or tenacious as you. I guess we have the same amount of positive qualities... they're just spread over different parts of our personalities.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 07.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I've never visited Sumeru, or made many friends from outside of Mondstadt. I'm happy just to have met and become your friend.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 08.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Maybe I'll get shy and flustered when I meet other people I don't know in the future... But that's okay, too.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 09.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Since we are so alike, you probably get what I'm trying to say. You just need to believe that all of your "issues" aren't really issues at all!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 06.ogg}} '''Collei:''' But... Isn't it too late now for me to learn to accept myself?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 10.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Uh, well... Hmm, do you know anything about the blooming cycles of Cecilias?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 07.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Umm... I may have read about that in a book before.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 11.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' That's a topic that my parents used to talk about back when they were still dating. Surprising, right? To think that people would talk about that while on a date.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 12.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' My mom brought it up at dinner one time last month. She called my dad the most boring man she knew, and said that he even turned up late to a date once... all with a smile on her face.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 13.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' But she also said that learning is just another part of life. It's never too late to start something as long as you recognize that it's something good for you to do.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 08.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 14.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Why don't you give it a try, Collei?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 09.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...Okay! I'll try my best.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' They're really having a great conversation... Paimon can't even find a moment to join in.
:{{DIcon}} Well, isn't it great that they're getting along so well?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 15.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Ah, I nearly forgot! This is for you.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 10.ogg}} '''Collei:''' This texture... Are these seeds?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 16.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Yep! I believe I mentioned my Sweet Flower research to you before. These are the seeds of the Sweet Flower cultivars that I have worked on.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 17.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' It's nothing too special, but they're the best cultivars that I've made! So... I really hope that you'll like them...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 18.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' They're super sweet, and easy to grow and keep!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 19.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I'm also submitting them as my Windblumes for this year. I wish that the Anemo Archon could also see how lovely they are...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 11.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Thank you! I'll plant them in the Avidya Forest, and take good care of them.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Collei, please take these notes with you.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' I've heard that you've been working hard on your studies, so I've prepared some study materials for you at Sucrose's request. Feel free to look through them whenever you can find the time. Mondstadt's doors will always remain open to you.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 12.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Ah... Thank you so much... Really... I...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 13.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 14.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I don't know what to say. I... I'm just really happy.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah! Sucrose! Now's your chance! Didn't you want to collect a "Breath of Joy"?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 20.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Ahhh, you're right, I almost forgot! Collei, can you exhale once into this test tube? I will save this breath of joy, and use it in my research.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 15.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh, really? May I?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 21.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Of course!

:'''Collei exhales into Sucrose's test tube, and the fluid turns a deep violet...'''

:'''A small sparkling cloud then puffs out of the test tube and rises into the air like a marshmallow before it's taken away by the wind.'''

:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 22.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Huh...? What... what was that?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 16.ogg}} '''Collei:''' It was like a little cloud of happiness, but now it flew away...
::[[File:Windblume's Breath Test Tube Filled.png|100px]]
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 23.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Well, luckily there's still some breath left in the test tube... I'll seal it up for now.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 24.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I'll keep working on it and let you know as soon as I have any breakthroughs in my research!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 17.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Yeah, you can write to me! I'll be sure to respond as soon as I receive your letter.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Oh, it looks like you've found a new pen pal?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 18.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Master Tighnari! Cyno!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' If your friendship was forged in a test tube, does that make you "test friends forever"?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' That's it... I think you've ruined Sumeru's reputation in Mondstadt beyond all hope of repair.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' All that matters is that I've enjoyed Mondstadt immensely. The dragon here possesses a majestic form.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 albedo 05.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Ah, that reminds me. (Traveler), this card back is for you.
:{{DIcon}} Wait, for me?
:{{DIcon}} Didn't Cyno commission this?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 albedo 06.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Cyno wanted you to have one for yourself. If I had to guess, I'd say he probably wants you to use it if you challenge him to a duel.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I'm a master of the game. Do you dare challenge me?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Can you believe this guy!? Let's knock him off his high horse!
:{{DIcon}} It's time to duel!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 19.ogg}} '''Collei:''' W&mdash;Wait, I've got something to give you, too...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, Collei has a gift for us?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 20.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Yeah. I... figured I should follow local Mondstadt customs, and prepared a few small things themed after the Windblume Festival.
::[[File:Windblume's Breath Bookmark.png|100px]]
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 21.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I made these bookmarks from Sumeru Roses at the hotel... I want to give them to Amber, Master Tighnari, and Cyno.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 22.ogg}} '''Collei:''' During Windblume, Mondstadters offer flowers to the people most important to them... you three are family to me.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' But Tighnari said that we're not anything like an academic family. He wouldn't write joint papers with us...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Well, in this case, we can consider ourselves as regular siblings, and that should be just fine.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 23.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Hehe, I agree!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 24.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Oh, and here are some Padisarah seeds as well... These are for (Traveler), Paimon, and everyone else from Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! Are these really for us?
:{{DIcon}} Thank you. We really appreciate it.
:{{DIcon}} Score!
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 25.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' So, are these your chosen Windblumes?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 25.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Mhm, one of them! Both Padisarahs and Sumeru Roses are my Windblumes.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 26.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Although they're not native to Mondstadt, they are the flowers that can best express my feelings.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 27.ogg}} '''Collei:''' I want to give them to the people I feel thankful for, to those who... I wish to accompany as we greet more seasons and future Windblumes together.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 28.ogg}} '''Collei:''' The real blessing in life is when you are surrounded by people who you'd miss day and night, and who you'd want to see even if that meant crossing mountains and oceans to do so.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 26.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Hehe! I'm so happy to hear you say that.
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 29.ogg}} '''Collei:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 30.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Sucrose, do you see that cloud over there?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 sucrose 27.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Hmm?
:{{A|vo eqfh103 9 collei 31.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Doesn't it look... just like your test tube?

===Timaeus and Ying'er===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Timaeus and Ying'er near the Mondstadt crafting bench)
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 timaeus 01.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Am I... Am I dreaming? Miss Ying'er, you really came all the way to Mondstadt to see me...
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 timaeus 02.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Wh&mdash;Why were you willing to make the trip? I still can't believe it...
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 yinger 01.ogg}} '''Ying'er:''' Hehe, why wouldn't I want to come see you, hmm? It's not like a quick trip from Liyue to Mondstadt is completely unheard-of or anything.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 yinger 02.ogg}} '''Ying'er:''' Also, isn't it time for you to drop the "Miss," and just call me Ying'er?
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 timaeus 03.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Ying'er...
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 yinger 03.ogg}} '''Ying'er:''' Mm-hmm.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 timaeus 04.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' Ying'er... Heh, I... I think I still need some time to get used to calling you that...
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 yinger 04.ogg}} '''Ying'er:''' Hehe, look at you, already so flustered. And we're just getting started!
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 timaeus 05.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' No no, I, uh... I... *sigh*
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 timaeus 06.ogg}} '''Timaeus:''' I'm just overwhelmed with happiness. Thank you so, so much for coming to see me for Windblume...

===Albedo===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Albedo on the balcony on the second floor of [[Good Hunter]])
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 albedo 01.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' You liked the card back from Cyno, right? I must admit, I also spent a good amount of effort coming up with the design.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 albedo 02.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' His request was quite interesting. He wanted a dragon, a cool pose, and a design that would stand out and awe his opponents.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 albedo 03.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Although the commission was for himself, he wanted the back to be flashy enough to draw the attention of the opposing player. Perhaps, there's something that can be said about how when it comes to Genius Invokation TCG, friendship is more important than competition.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 albedo 04.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' He also said that such an impressive card back should be shared with friends. Since he gave it to you, this must mean he considers you to be a close friend.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 albedo 05.ogg}} '''Albedo:''' Oh, and speaking of, to repay my efforts, he also gifted me the card back as well. Hmm... maybe I'll also give the game a try.

:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 collei 01.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Really? Sounds great!
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 sucrose 01.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' I&mdash;I must point out a small issue about your cooking! You have a tendency to put a little too much flavoring in your dishes...
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 ambor 02.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Ahahaha, sorry! I guess I've been a little heavy-handed with the seasonings lately...
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 collei 02.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Are you feeling stressed recently? Do you want to find someone to play cards with? It really helps with stress, I promise!
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 eula 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Oh, that sounds like a good idea. If I recall, both you and Sucrose are pretty good players, right?
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 sucrose 02.ogg}} '''Sucrose:''' Oh yeah, we are! We've been playing together, and we were actually talking about this just a few days ago...
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 eula 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Since you are already familiar... would you mind also showing me the rules sometime?
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 ambor 03.ogg}} '''Amber:''' Yeah, Collei seems to be a natural at the game... Maybe she's already the best player out of all of us!
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 collei 03.ogg}} '''Collei:''' Huh!? Me!?
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 eula 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' That's right, you've been all the talk at the tavern. "That little girl from Sumeru is really good at the game... If I can find the chance, I would love to test my skills against her."

::{{DIcon}} I'm sorry, I don't know how to play.
::{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Huh, really... I suppose you've been too busy with other things to pick up the game?
::{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I'd suggest you visit The Cat's Tail. There's a teacher there who's quite proficient with introducing beginners to the game. You can learn the basics from her.
::{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' The sooner you learn, the sooner we can duel.

===Mika and Tighnari===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Mika or Tighnari on a ledge north of the [[Dawn Winery]] [[Statue of The Seven]])
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 mika 01.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Thank you so much for your surveying tips! I had no idea that the Sumeru Forest Watchers would also have expertise in this area... You really do know just about everything!
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' It's only natural that Forest Watchers and surveyors would have some similar skills. We're both constantly outdoors and on the move, after all.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Anyway, I'm glad I could help.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 mika 02.ogg}} '''Mika:''' If I can find the chance, I'd love to pay a visit to Sumeru as well! I've heard that the terrain is quite complicated there, and it'd be a treat to see it for myself.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Yes, "complicated" is indeed one way to put it. Visitors often get lost when they visit Sumeru for the first time, and they have a tendency to pick all kinds of mushrooms and fruits in the rainforest without discretion.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 mika 03.ogg}} '''Mika:''' Ah, we get a lot of people here picking Philanemo Mushrooms as well...
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Actually, have you ever tried adding them to a recipe? They are quite bland by themselves, but perhaps, the taste can be improved if they're cooked together with other ingredients...
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 mika 04.ogg}} '''Mika:''' I've never tried that myself... But now that you mention it, I do want to give it a try...
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 tighnari 05.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I'm quite curious, too. Would you like to pick some together later?

:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 mona 01.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Huh? Is it for me? Thank you, Klee!

:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 mona 05.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Klee, you're super adorable, and your hat and backpack are the cutest! Did your mom get them for you?
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 klee 04.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Yep! Mom said that she picked them out with Dodoco, and Dodoco really loves this backpack, too! Which is why Dodoco's always hanging from the side!
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 klee 05.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Mom also said that someone else was also helping her pick out the gifts that day... Hmm, what was the name again ...
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 klee 06.ogg}} '''Klee:''' Ah, if Klee remembers correctly, people would call her... the old hag.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 mona 06.ogg}} '''Mona:''' Wait, the old hag!? ...Huh, okay, now that you mention it, the old hag does have a fondness for picking out hats...

:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Well, what do you think? I trust you've enjoyed this year's Windblume Festival?
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I'm happy to see you find the time amidst your busy adventures to return to Mondstadt and celebrate the winds of freedom with us.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' And if you have a moment now, would you care to hear a new love poem I wrote this year?
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Ahem! Allow me to recite it for you.
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' This world has never seen such vibrant color / it bestows upon everyone a brilliant hue
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh103 venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' A shade more ethereal than white / yet more radiant still than gold / it eases into your eyes / and restores to light a solitary soul
