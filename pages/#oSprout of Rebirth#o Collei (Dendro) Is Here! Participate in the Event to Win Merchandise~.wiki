'''"Sprout of Rebirth" Collei (Dendro) Is Here! Participate in the Event to Win Merchandise~''' is a Web [[Event]] in [[Version 2.8]].

Olah! Hello, Travelers~<br>
The friend we are introducing today is a trainee ranger active in Avidya Forest, [[Collei]]!<br>
We've got the latest scoop on a new character, let's take a look~

[https://www.hoyolab.com/article/7113904 >>Learn More About Collei<<]

"Helpful," "bright and sunny," "friendly and passionate"... Just ask around Gandharva Ville, and you'll hear this Trainee Forest Ranger praised to the skies in such terms.<br>
As long as her body allows, no matter how busy school gets, Collei will never slack off when it comes to her forest patrol work, and is always willing to lend a warm helping hand to whoever is in trouble, regardless of what walk of life they are from.<br>
Forest Ranger seems like a very cool profession, I'm really curious about what they do on a regular basis!
