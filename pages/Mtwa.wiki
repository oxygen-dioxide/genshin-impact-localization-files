:'''Mtwa:''' How strange... It's like they can only be seen from inside [[Natlan]]...
:{{DIcon}} You mean...
::'''Mtwa:''' Yes, I speak of the [[False Sky|unknown fragments]] that appeared in the sky during the battle against the [[Abyss]].
::'''Mtwa:''' At first, we thought they were Abyssal weapons, poised to descend upon us and bring destruction in their wake. But then, they just hung there doing nothing...
::'''Mtwa:''' Later, someone said they resembled ancient relics from our western mountains. I went to see for myself, and they were indeed remarkably similar.
::'''Mtwa:''' Oh dear, where are my manners? I haven't even told you who I am! I'm from the Natlan Saurian Relics Association and I'm out here doing fieldwork. Don't think for a second this is a holiday!
::{{DIcon}} How's the research coming along?
::'''Mtwa:''' Poorly, I'm afraid. It seems the more I look into it, the more questions I have. Why is it that as soon as one leaves Natlan, the fragments seem to disappear?
::'''Mtwa:''' On the road here, I asked many an outlander, but all they gave me were funny looks. None of them seemed to know what I was talking about.
::'''Mtwa:''' Then again, if I ran into a strange traveler from another land who was raving about a hole in the sky that I couldn't see, I'd probably think it was my odd myself...
::'''Mtwa:''' Well, not that I'm a traveler, obviously, I'm a researcher... That was just a hypothetical statement.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Mtwa:''' Take care. And don't worry so much about the sky, it's far more important where you're putting your feet.
