''Available before completing ''[[Pursuit (Part 2)|Pursuit]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Canotila:''' Since memories can be made into books, if we reverse the logic, books can also be written directly into memories...
:'''Canotila:''' Hmm... What is it? Is there something you'd like to ask?
:{{DIcon}} About the Book of Revealing...
::'''Canotila:''' Hmm. No matter how I think about this, converting memories into books is quite the incredible deed...
::'''Canotila:''' The creator of this book must've only been able to do this because they viewed the emotions in their memories as the most precious thing in the world.
::'''Canotila:''' That doesn't change how difficult its contents are to parse, though...
:{{DIcon}} I've got a new page with me...
::'''Canotila:''' Ooh, if you've found one or more new pages, just put them inside the book. Let's see what happens!
;(After Step 3 of ''[[There Will Come Soft Rains]]'')
:{{DIcon}} About the earthquake just a while ago...
::'''Canotila:''' Earthquake? Oh, you mean that bit a moment ago where everything was swaying? Well, I was thinking about other things, so I didn't pay much attention...
:{{DIcon}} Not really.
::'''Canotila:''' Alright... Oh, yes. If you ever feel sad, come over here &mdash; let's meditate together. Maybe that'll help cheer you up.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''[[Pursuit (Part 2)|Pursuit]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Canotila:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} About the Book of Revealing...
::'''Canotila:''' ...So scary! Terrifying! If it wasn't for {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, I don't know what would've happened to me.
::'''Canotila:''' But why? Why would monsters appear in such a beautiful place? Is it really that...
::'''Canotila:''' Nope! Not gonna keep thinking about that. It wasn't easy for me to forge a life for myself here.
::'''Canotila:''' If you find another page, or want to meditate... The book hasn't moved. But please, be careful.
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
::'''Canotila:''' Thank you. If it wasn't for you, I might never have made it back.
::'''Canotila:''' Merusea Village is beautiful, and everyone is really nice. I should treasure life here a little more, and the "world" around me.
::'''Canotila:''' Perhaps, the world of "meditation" is not as wonderful as I once thought?
:{{DIcon}} Take care.
::'''Canotila:''' Yes. Thank you.
