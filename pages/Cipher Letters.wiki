The '''Cipher Letters''' are a set of six interactable notes found in the [[Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering Region]], [[Fontaine]]. They can only be read while operating an [[Energy Transfer Terminal]]. 

Interacting with all of them gives the {{Achievement|The Calendar of the Future Is Longer Than the Diary of the Past}}.

According to Cipher Letter (II), this system was invented by Monsieur Butor, a former associate of the [[Fontaine Research Institute]].

==Dialogue==
===Cipher Letter (I)===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:This is a test text for cipher letters.

:I haven't thought of any suitable scenarios where this tech can be applied.
:Considering that the energy transfer terminals and their receiving terminals aren't widespread in [[Fontaine]], the use of encrypted images will be limited to within the [[Fontaine Research Institute]].
:[[Teilhard]] just loves coming up with such useless inventions. I've already warned him not to vandalize the place.
:The encrypted images use a special paint that requires an equally special solvent to remove. The formula for the solvent needed to remove the encrypted messages is recorded below.
:(The text below has been removed.)

===Cipher Letter (II)===

:This is a test text for cipher letters.

:This is not a test text for cipher letters.
:Huh, looks like I can add and remove text.
:[[Butor]]'s invention is interesting indeed, and not a useless one. Unfortunately, there are too many blockheads in the Institute now. Apart from a few intriguing individuals, the rest of them only know how to follow what's tried and tested.
:These few exceptions are buried in their own fascinating experiments, and care little for others' projects.
:But I believe that one day, cipher letters will be applicable in our lives. Just like my system-wide prototype, which has tons of development potential!

===Cipher Letter (III)===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:None of those pompous geezers will ever find this place, but I'm sure [[Maillardet]] will!
:Strange things happened in succession at my previous presentation: my system-wide prototype somehow got destroyed, along with a batch of valuable [[Plaustrite Shard]]s...
:Most frustrating of all, was that this happened when the [[Icewind Suite|artificed dancers]] were giving their curtain call! My prototype exploded in a shower of fireworks, but the audience thought it was all part of the performance, and broke out in rapturous applause...
:Maillardet's smile was brighter than usual too... Ugh, I can't stand it. Although he was present the whole time, but I'm sure that my prototype breaking down had something to do with him. I just haven't found the evidence to prove it.
:But I'm no longer concerned about the evidence now. I've decided to start from scratch, and create a clockwork meka that is ten times&mdash; no, a hundred times better than his artificed dancer. A clockwork meka that would impress even him.
:And when the time comes, everyone will have to admit that traditional clockwork meka still have a place in the Institute...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Cipher Letter (IV)===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:Teilhard scribbled cipher letters all over the place... Why am I not surprised? He even erased the formula for the purifying solvent Butor left behind.
:Thanks to him, all of our project funding requests have been rejected. Guess it's time to kiss my bright future goodbye.
:Not only is there no place for traditional clockwork meka research in the Fontaine Research Institute, there's no place for me as well.
:I probably should try to secure a job at the [[Fortress of Meropide]] &mdash; I'm sure they need engineers there.
:...I'm just kidding, there's no way I'm going there. I heard there aren't even windows there.
:I've decided to do something out of the goodness of my heart.
:Although Butor is no longer here, I've recreated the formula for the purifying solvent based on the information he left behind.
:I'll record the formula here, so anyone who sees this is able to use it to create the solvent, and erase the nonsense that Teilhard wrote.
:The formula is as follows:
:(The text below has been removed.)
{{Dialogue End}}

===Cipher Letter (V)===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:All that once stood fast has been destroyed. The stone walls are as weak as flesh and blood.
:The time has come for me to leave, and I shall not return.
:But I won't give up. I see the path leading towards my future. I will endeavor towards it, even if it's a path of solitude.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Cipher Letter (VI)===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:Life is like a dark comedy, and the wise always take orders from fools...
:I am but an amateur actor who is no longer able to play a part on the stage anymore.
:Cipher letters are a useless invention, just like Initial Skill Sample No. 2.
