==Dialogue==
===Day 1===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Upon approaching for the first time)
:'''Washizu:''' ...?
:{{DIcon}} Hello?
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
:'''Washizu:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Are you listening to me?
:'''Washizu:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Hello?
:{{DIcon}} Nod your head if you can speak.
:'''Washizu:''' ...Please do not disturb me anymore.
:'''Washizu:''' "He" is unhappy. "He" is displeased with the disturbance caused by "words of the tongue", which drown out the wisdom of the "words of the heart."
:{{DIcon}} "Words of the tongue"...?
:'''Washizu:''' The "words of the tongue" are like pouring rain. They shake the eardrums and disrupt the heart.
:'''Washizu:''' The "words of the heart" are like fog. They seep in naturally, enshrouding...
:'''Washizu:''' Shh...! "He is listening. "He" is speaking.
:'''Washizu:''' Do not use your tongue. Do not use your ears. Listen with your heart...
:'''Washizu:''' Come here. Worship. Pray. And listen.
:'''Washizu:''' Remember, worship three times. Three times.
:{{DIcon}} (Give it a try.)
:{{DIcon}} I think I'll pass...

;(Interacting with the Outsider Shrine)
:'''Outsider Shrine:''' (It looks like an ordinary shrine &mdash; there is a distinct lack of any strange elemental traces.)
:{{DIcon}} Pay respects at the shrine (First pray)
:'''Outsider Shrine:''' (The moist sea breeze brushes against your cheek, and a sea bird sings in the distance as it merges into the lonely clouds. You try to listen, but nothing happens.)
:{{DIcon}} Continue to pay respects (Second pray)
:'''Outsider Shrine:''' (The faint sound of a whale comes from a distant sea, drowned out by the sound of the grass swaying in the wind. You try to listen, but nothing happens.)
:{{DIcon}} Continue to pay respects (Third pray)
:'''Outsider Shrine:''' (You can hear fireflies buzzing not far away. The little creatures crackle soothingly. You try to listen, but nothing happens.)

;(After praying to the Outsider Shrine three times)
:'''Washizu:''' How is it? Were you fortunate enough to hear "his" teachings?
:{{DIcon}} I heard nothing.
:{{DIcon}} I have not had the fortune to hear anything.
:'''Washizu:''' Ah, it is alright. It is alright. "He" sees. "He" hears.
:'''Washizu:''' "He" is comforted, and those who delight in "him" shall be rewarded.
:'''Washizu:''' "His" reward is not on yonder shore. It is tomorrow.
:{{DIcon}} Do you know what you're talking about?
:{{DIcon}} Excuse my shallowness, but I do not understand you.
:'''Washizu:''' Next time you're here, you can see for yourself.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Day 2===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before praying)
:'''Washizu:''' Compared with "his" great blessings, this is but a small reward.
:'''Washizu:''' Pray. Worship. Listen to "him," and let "him" listen to you!
:'''Washizu:''' Then, like me, you will hear "his" words coming from your heart.
:'''Washizu:''' Then "he" will lead you out of suffering and grant you a great reward.
:{{DIcon}} Well...
:{{DIcon}} Whatever you say.
:'''Washizu:''' Remember. Worship three times a day and you will be rewarded.
:'''Washizu:''' Remember, remember.

;(Interacting with the Outsider Shrine)
:'''Outsider Shrine:''' (It looks like an ordinary shrine &mdash; there is a distinct lack of any strange elemental traces.)
:{{DIcon}} Pay respects at the shrine (First pray)
:'''Outsider Shrine:''' (The fragrance of unnamed wildflowers drifts in from nearby. It seems that there is a fox hiding in the bushes, making a rustling sound. You try to listen, but nothing happens.)
:{{DIcon}} Continue to pay respects (Second pray)
:'''Outsider Shrine:''' (Yashiori Island has withered away due to the war, and it is a sad sight. But here, the empty tranquility lends vitality to nature. You try to listen, but nothing happens.)
:{{DIcon}} Continue to pay respects (Third pray)
:'''Outsider Shrine:''' (You can hear lizards running, and you can see the tiny, bamboo leaf-like footprints they leave, elegant yet transient. You try to listen, but nothing happens.)

;(After praying to the Outsider Shrine three times)
:'''Washizu:''' Worship, listen...
:'''Washizu:''' "He" is strong because "he" listens. "He" sees and hears everything because "he" is strong. Thus "he" sees all there is. Hears all there is.
:'''Washizu:''' Neither the fools in Sangonomiya nor the madmen of Narukami Island understand it, feel it. So all they know is to fight each other and let the blood blind their eyes...
:'''Washizu:''' But you must understand that.
:{{DIcon}} This logic's a mess...
:{{DIcon}} I get it, more or less.
:'''Washizu:''' The answer lies in worship.
:'''Washizu:''' Remember. Worship three times a day and you shall be rewarded.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Day 3===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before praying)
:'''Washizu:''' "He" is coming! Don't stop worshiping! We must not stop worshiping!
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright...?
:{{DIcon}} Oh, "he" is coming!
:'''Washizu:''' "He" is sullen. "His" anger shall soon burst forth!
:{{DIcon}} What?
:{{DIcon}} Oh yes, it shall soon burst forth!
:'''Washizu:''' And why? Why, because of [[Chouji's Mother|that woman]]! The one who refuses to pay tribute! The evil one!
:{{DIcon}} A woman...?
:{{DIcon}} Oh yes, darn her, am I right?
:'''Washizu:''' She flees even now, but how can she escape him? Eighteen pairs of blood-red eyes! Thousands of sharp, venomous fangs! Countless mouths and numberless tongues, ever thirsting after blood!
:'''Washizu:''' She can't hide, she can't hide!
:'''Washizu:''' Ah, the [[Sumeru|desert nation of arid sentiment]]! And you, the foolish beggar who hides in the forest, claiming to be wise &mdash; none of you can protect her!
:{{DIcon}} Please calm down!
:{{DIcon}} Oh yes, well said, good sir!
:'''Washizu:''' You have the blessing! Go and worship! Go and worship!

;(Interacting with the Outsider Shrine)
:'''Outsider Shrine:''' (It looks like an ordinary shrine &mdash; there is a distinct lack of any strange elemental traces.)
:{{DIcon}} Pay respects at the shrine (First pray)
:'''Outsider Shrine:''' (Washizu struggles to calm his restless mind, breathing heavily. He is obviously in a state of passion and seems to be expecting something. You try to listen, but nothing happens.)
:{{DIcon}} Continue to pay respects (Second pray)
:'''Outsider Shrine:''' (Washizu is not completely insane. He obviously desires something, but what is this desire? Thinking only invites more questions. You try to listen, but nothing happens.)
:{{DIcon}} Continue to pay respects (Third pray)
:'''Outsider Shrine:''' (You hear the sound of the waves crashing against the rocks, and that cascading sound leads people to gaze out at the place where sea and sky meet. You try to listen, but nothing happens.)

;(After praying to the Outsider Shrine three times)
:'''Washizu:''' "He" must be calmed. "His" anger must be soothed...
:'''Washizu:''' You've done well! You've done very well!
:'''Washizu:''' Remember, some will try to cheat you with masks, but "he" will help you. "He" will always help you.
:{{DIcon}} Hmm...
:{{DIcon}} Sure, I guess...?
:'''Washizu:''' That woman is like the kitsune demons of legend. I let her go. "He" is very angry.
:'''Washizu:''' "He" is angry again... This is my sin.
:'''Washizu:''' Please forgive me... I will sacrifice again. I will find a sacrifice for the "returning"...
:'''Washizu:''' Please forgive me, please forgive me...
:'''Washizu:''' Please forgive me, please forgive me...<!--intended duplicate line-->
{{Dialogue end}}

===Day 4===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before praying)
:'''Washizu:''' You are here.
:{{DIcon}} How are you doing?
:'''Washizu:''' Thank you for forgiving my sins. Please let me return to you...
:{{DIcon}} Are you talking to me?
:'''Washizu:''' What... But why...
:'''Washizu:''' I presided over every sacrifice, and I accepted every one of your blessings!
:'''Washizu:''' But she, branded by you, established by your hand, has fled from your blessings. She has betrayed us!
:{{DIcon}} What are you talking about...
:'''Washizu:''' Ah! Uh, sorry... Sorry...
:'''Washizu:''' I should not doubt "his" choice. Continue to endure, continue to worship...
:{{DIcon}} Can you hear me?
:'''Washizu:''' Continue to endure... Continue to worship...
:'''Washizu:''' Continue to endure... Continue to worship...<!--intended duplicate line-->

;(Interacting with the Outsider Shrine)
:'''Outsider Shrine:''' (This looks like a common shrine with no special features. Seeing Washizu in this state, do you still want to keep paying respects at this shrine?)
:{{DIcon}} Pay respects at the shrine (First pray)
:'''Outsider Shrine:''' (Washizu is still muttering to himself by the side, and he doesn't look well at all. The shrine is still and unresponsive. Perhaps this is all a scam? You try to listen, but nothing happens.)
:{{DIcon}} Continue to pay respects (Second pray)
:'''Outsider Shrine:''' (You hear the wind whistling through the great serpent's bones, but the ancient corpse remains still. It seems to have been weathered by the sea into an instrument &mdash; the most mournful instrument in the ocean. You try to listen, but nothing happens.)
:{{DIcon}} Continue to pay respects (Third pray)
:'''Outsider Shrine:''' (Washizu is still muttering to himself by the side, and he doesn't look well. The shrine is still and unresponsive. Perhaps this is all a scam? You try to listen, but nothing happens.)
:'''Outsider Shrine:''' "Watch out behind you..."
:'''Outsider Shrine:''' (Footsteps come from behind, clearly trying to remain unheard.)
:'''Outsider Shrine:''' "Watch out!"

;(Washizu goes mad)
:'''Maddened Samurai:''' The time has come... for sacrifice...
:'''Maddened Samurai:''' O ye who accommodates all things... accept me... consume me... save me...

;(Defeat Washizu)
;(Obtain [[Incomplete Notes]] and [[Tattered Paper]])
{{Dialogue end}}
