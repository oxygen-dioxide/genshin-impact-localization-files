'''Vehicles''' are means of transport that allow for faster movement with less stamina consumption. There is currently only one vehicle in the game, and that is the [[Waverider]].

{{Main|Waverider}}
The Waverider is a water transport vehicle that can navigate between different islands. It is currently only available in the limited-time area [[Golden Apple Archipelago/1.6|Golden Apple Archipelago]], in [[Inazuma]], and in [[Sumeru]].

==Functions==
While inside a vehicle, W and S will move the vehicle forward and backwards, and A and D will steer the vehicle left and right. Holding shift will consume [[stamina]] and propel the vehicle forward at a faster rate. On a console, the left joystick performs both of these functions. <!-- Does gyroscope on mobile steer? or what? --> The Normal Attack will fire its on-board weapon. The Elemental Skill will perform a Charged Attack with its on-board weapon instead. This has a much longer cooldown. The Elemental Burst is not used. Holding the jump button will dismount or eject the player from the vehicle.

Vehicles can be summoned at their appropriate waypoints. This will move it to the current location on water or on land. Each vehicle has a set HP and level that determines the strength of attacks as well as HP. If a vehicle's HP reaches 0, the player will be automatically ejected. This can be avoided by performing repairs with the appropriate repair toolbox.
