The '''Map''' is a [[Game System]] that display that represents the world. It can be accessed by pressing the Minimap in the top left of the screen, opening from [[Paimon Menu]] > Map, or pressing {{Key|M}} on PC. [[Teleport Waypoint]]s, [[Statues of the Seven]], and [[Domain]]s can be teleported to by selecting them on the Map and pressing "Teleport".

Pressing the "Domains only" toggle at the bottom left of the screen shows the Domain names and their category. [[Quest Domain]]s do not show up on the Map. [[Instance]]s do not show up on the Map unless they have a special marker.

[[Subareas]] are labeled on the Map. The current [[area]] and its Exploration Progress is labeled at the bottom right of the Map. When fully zoomed out, Domains and areas (with their Exploration Progress percentage) are labeled on the Map. The Exploration Progress percentage is only visible after the map is revealed (i.e. the [[Statue of the Seven]] or [[Inscribed Map]] have been touched).

Other information available on the Map Menu include Notifications, Tabs, [[Spiral Abyss]] progress, and [[Original Resin]] count.

==Map Area==
[[File:Map Before The Outlander Who Caught the Wind.png|thumb|200px|right|Available map area before completion of [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]]]]
While the player can move the Map around and view inaccessible areas, the player cannot venture into [[Out of Bounds]] areas.

Upon beginning the game, the Map is initially limited to about half of [[Starfell Valley]] plus, roughly, [[Windrise]], [[Falcon Coast]], and [[Springvale]]. The [[Statue of The Seven]] in [[Windwail Highland]] cannot be accessed.

Upon completion of [[Prologue]]: Act I - [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]], the rest of the map becomes available.

Unlocking a Statue of The Seven lights up that Statue's [[area]] on the Map. Touching the [[Inscribed Map]] unlocks [[Enkanomiya]]'s Map, and progressing through [[The Chasm Delvers]] quest series unlocks the Map for [[The Chasm/Underground Mines]]. After fully lighting up a region's map, players will earn [[:Category:Achievements Related to Map|an achievement]].{{clr}}

==Tabs==
Tabs can be access by clicking on the icon at the bottom right of the map screen. Tabs can be used to switch between different Maps and also to quickly switch between different regions of the Teyvat Map. Each tab can optionally have an icon on it if there are any Map Notifications or Quest Objectives in that Map or Region.

==Trivia==
* When in Domains, opening the Teyvat map shows the "Teyvat" at the bottom right.
* The [[Golden Apple Archipelago]] does not have exploration progress, so the map name "Golden Apple Archipelago" is at the bottom right.
* During the [[Nilou]] step of the {{Quest|Jnagarbha Day}}, the player can open the Map but cannot see any markers.
