{{Description|A hat once worn by the witch who dreamt of burning away all the demons in the world. The large brim blocked her sight.}}
'''Witch's Scorching Hat''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Crimson Witch of Flames]].

==Description==
A traditional witch's pointed hat with a large brim.<br>It grants a witch the reverence and fear which she commands.

To the [[Crimson Witch of Flame]], this large hat shielded her from surrounding distractions.<br>It was how she was able to hone her Pyro skills when she was still an apprentice.

In combat, she needed not pay attention to monsters disintegrating in flames.<br>Nor did she need to look at her own burnt face in the water's reflection.<br>And so the Crimson Witch continued to burn, blind to the extent of her devastation.
