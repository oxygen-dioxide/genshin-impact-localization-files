{{Description|A hat once worn by the witch who dreamt of burning away all the demons in the world. The large brim blocked her sight.}}
'''Witch's Scorching Hat''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Crimson Witch of Flames]].

==Description==
A traditional witch's pointed hat with a large brim.<br />It grants a witch the reverence and fear which she commands.

To the Crimson Witch of Flame, this large hat shielded her from surrounding distractions.<br />It was how she was able to hone her Pyro skills when she was still an apprentice.

In combat, she needed not pay attention to monsters disintegrating in flames.<br />Nor did she need to look at her own burnt face in the water's reflection.<br />And so the Crimson Witch continued to burn, blind to the extent of her devastation.
