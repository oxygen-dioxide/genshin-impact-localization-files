'''Il Capitano''', also known by his codename "'''The Captain''',"<ref name="lazzo video description" /> is one of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]].<ref group="Note">Given that all other seats are known, Capitano and Arlecchino are likely the currently unidentified Fourth and Tenth seats, respectively, based on [[Tartaglia]]'s remark that he is too low-ranked for Capitano to notice him and Efim's desire to take advantage of Signora's death to raise Arlecchino's prestige. However, no official confirmation on their ranks have been given. With Pierro being the Director and not the First, Capitano could also be the First seat.</ref>

He makes his first appearance during ''[https://youtu.be/TmaAOV4SJNQ Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo]'' alongside his fellow Harbingers.

==Profile==
Capitano enjoys a high reputation amongst the Fatui, with [[Viktor]] stating that if he had the choice, he would rather work under Capitano.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Tales of Winter}}</ref> He is known for his great strength and unwavering sense of justice; [[Tartaglia]] hopes to one day be noticed by, and get a chance to fight against, the senior Harbinger,<ref>{{Ref/VO|Tartaglia|About The Captain}}</ref> and Capitano criticizes Signora's methods as having "tarnished her honor" at her funeral.

[[Wanderer]], however, sees these attributes as a negative combination and points out that holding "absolute righteousness" is a potential hazard.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Wanderer|About The Captain}}</ref>

==Story==
After Signora's death at the hands of the [[Raiden Shogun]], a funeral for her was held in [[Snezhnaya]]. Capitano, along with the other Harbingers barring [[Scaramouche]], was in attendance, where he questioned [[Il Dottore]] on the situation with Scaramouche and the [[Gnosis|Electro Gnosis]].

===In-Game===
During the event of ''[[Of Ballads and Brews]]'', [[Varka]]'s letter to the [[Knights of Favonius]] revealed that he and his expedition encountered Il Capitano. Despite the Fatui's previous transgressions against Mondstadt during the events of the [[Archon Quest]] [[Prologue]], the two sides remained cordial to each other. At the time Varka wrote his letter, Capitano had just left for [[Natlan]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Sounds From Afar}}</ref>
