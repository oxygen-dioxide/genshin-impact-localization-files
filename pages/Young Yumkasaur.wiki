==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
The young Yumkasaur lived with a group of people before the [[Abyss]] invaded Natlan. They were making their way to the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]] when they were attacked by Abyssal monsters, and the Saurians quickly attempted to defend their human companions. In part due to its young age, it did not participate in the fighting. 

If the [[Traveler]] helped [[Haronga]]'s group, the Yumkasaur would accompany the rest of his group to the stadium, where it could be seen looking out towards the plains.

If the Traveler did not help out Haronga's group, by the time they arrived, the entire group was killed by the monsters. After eliminating them, they heard a voice coming from a nearby watchtower and discovered the Yumkasaur, who had fled to the watchtower platform to avoid being killed by the monsters. [[Paimon]] understood its grief, but told it that it had to head to the Stadium of Sacred Flame for safety, which it did.
