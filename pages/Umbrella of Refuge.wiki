|description    = A plant that grows in the silent rainforest. Its round, umbrella-shaped leaves and its vivid green coloration really reflect its vitality.<br />Its leaves are relatively thicker compared to other plants of its kind. The leaves rarely sway from side to side even during a downpour, making it a perfect shelter for small animals to hide in.
