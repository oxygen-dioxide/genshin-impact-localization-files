{{Description|A tiny seed that rides on the wind. Even without its feathered wings, it still holds the hope from afar within. In a sense, the dandelion represents the romantic spirit of love and freedom. In the land of the wind, where dandelions are found in abundance, people use dandelions in wine making. Experts in local folklore believe that in ancient times, wine brewed from dandelions had a strong symbolic meaning.}}
