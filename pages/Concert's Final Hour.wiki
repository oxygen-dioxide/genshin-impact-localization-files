{{Description|An hourglass used to keep time during a band performance. It once made a crisp sound, but their performance has since ended.}}
'''Concert's Final Hour''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Wanderer's Troupe]].

==Description==
The troupe's hourglass, which is also a harp.<br />The tune becomes deeper with the passage of time.

When the performance was coming to an end, the troupe would play this harp.<br />As time passed, the tune of the harp became deeper.<br />The sound of the harp dying down marked the end of the show.

Everything has an end, and the troupe was no exception.<br />One by one, each member of the troupe met their fate and their instruments were buried deep in the dust.<br />As the harp fell silent, the final sound heard from the musical troupe was the faint trickle of sand as it slid down the hourglass one final time.
