==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Allan:''' Hi. If you're looking for a hunting partner, you'd be better off picking someone else...
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Allan:''' Oh, I'm Allan. I'm a hunter... in the making.
::'''Allan:''' I'm trying my best to learn the tricks of the trade from [[Draff]].
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Could you tell us about hunting techniques?
:::'''Allan:''' [[Draff]] is very experienced, and he's taught me a lot, like how to read the wind direction to prevent our prey from catching our scent.
:::'''Allan:''' He could even tell at a glance that the bow I had been using was no longer suited to my current skills. He then crafted a new one for me with his own hands...
:::'''Allan:''' Thanks for chatting with me. Allow me to give you my old bow, since I longer use it.
::;(Obtain [[Seasoned Hunter's Bow]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} You seem a bit worse for wear.
::'''Allan:''' Oh I'm fine.. It's just, I got a bit lost yesterday when I was out hunting...
::'''Allan:''' I almost wound up in a hilichurl camp. Fortunately I managed to escape...
::{{DIcon}} Sounds dangerous.
:::'''Allan:''' I'm lucky made it back safe and sound. But once again, I came back empty-handed...
:::'''Allan:''' But... *sigh* Never mind. It is what it is.
::{{DIcon}} Sounds rough.
:::'''Allan:''' I'm alright, really. I just always end up getting rescued by Outrider [[Amber]]...
:::'''Allan:''' It's so embarrassing.
:::'''Allan:''' She's quite the capable one. Well, she is a Vision bearer after all.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Allan:''' See you.

:'''Allan:''' I can't thank you enough for all of your help dealing with the meteorites.
:'''Allan:''' But I still can't stop wondering... Where did they come from?

===Invitation of Windblume===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Allan:''' Foxes really are too difficult to catch. Just how exactly did the elders manage it...
:{{DIcon}} About the foxes...
::'''Allan:''' Oh! As Springvale hunters, this is one of our customs.
::'''Allan:''' Every Windblume festival, young hunters like me go to Wolvendom to catch foxes.
::'''Allan:''' When we catch one, we place a wreath of flowers on its head and release it. It's a prayer for finding love in the year ahead...
::'''Allan:''' Of course, only eligible young hunters like myself participate. Hunters that have already tied the knot, like Draff for example, they're not allowed to take part.
::{{DIcon}} Did you catch a fox?
:::'''Allan:''' *sigh* Not even close. Foxes are so hard to catch.
:::'''Allan:''' I didn't catch one last Windblume Festival either. In fact, I nearly injured myself. I remember swearing that this time would be different...
:::'''Allan:''' ...and yet, low and behold, I've been outfoxed again. All I caught were a couple of squirrels.
:::'''Allan:''' That said... I wonder if Miss [[Sucrose]] could use her bio-alchemy to change squirrels into foxes?
:::'''Allan:''' I bet she could, haha...
::{{DIcon}} So everyone that catches a fox will find love?
:::'''Allan:''' Uh... if you always participate, your chances will increase exponentially...
:::'''Allan:''' ...in that sense, you're bound to bump into the right person eventually...
:::'''Allan:''' ...ahem. Anyway, that's what Draff's always telling us.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
:;(Dialogue responses are the same as normal)
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Allan:''' Indeed, see you.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Of Ballads and Brews===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Allan:''' I don't know if it's because his [[Diona|daughter]] is on break or what, but Draff has been extra jolly these days and is drinking even harder after work...
:'''Allan:''' It's a good thing that [[Razor|young one]] has been helping out lately, or I wouldn't be able to stand up if I had to hunt all by myself.
:;(Dialogue options and responses are the same as normal)
