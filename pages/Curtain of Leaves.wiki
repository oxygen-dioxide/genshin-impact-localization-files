{{Description|The Forest Ranger from [[Sumeru]], [[Collei]], seems to be in a bit of a pickle...<br />Somewhere deep in the rainforest, a reckless researcher from the [[Akademiya]] has activated a secretly-developed machine to break into a huge, spiraling set of ruins.<br />Collei, investigating nearby, wound up being caught up in the incident, and has lost contact with the outside world.<br />Though her skills and her survival techniques should allow her to escape on her own, her [[Tighnari|master]] and friends are worried for her safety nonetheless. So please, would you take a quick gander in there to search for her?}}
