|description    = A wall decoration comprised of a shield and two ceremonial swords engraved with the devices of the Knights of Favonius.<br />Both the sword and shield are trimmed with precious metals and are of good quality. They are not legendary weapons, for sure, but they are certainly no worse than high-quality equipment one can find on the market.<br />Some knights once found the following clause within an old edition of the rulebooks &mdash; "Feel free to use these weapons in case of an emergency."<br />However, these arms have incredible proportions and weight, and ordinary knights cannot use them at all, with some reckless young people almost causing alarmingly dangerous incidents.<br />As such, the new rulebooks now contain no such clause.
