|description    = A refined and luxurious indigo rug adorned with ornate and intricate patterns, of the same design as the rugs found in the Faded Castle. Woven of dense fabric, it remains as sturdy as it ever was even after hundreds of years, with no signs of structural damage. Though the turning of the ages has faded their color, enough remains to catch a glimpse of the afterglow of that ancient civilization...
