==Trivia==
*The term {{Lang|''byakko''|ja=白狐|ja_tl=white fox}} refers to divine fox spirits who serve Japanese deities such as {{w|Inari Ōkami|Inari Ookami}} in Shinto and their counterpart {{w|Dakini}} in Japanese Buddhism,<ref>Japanese Wikipedia: [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/{{subst:#urldecode:%E9%9C%8A%E7%8B%90}} {{ja|霊狐}}]</ref> who likely inspired the goddess-like kitsune [[Hakushin]] in the game. It suggests that this plain is probably named after the [[Hakushin Clan]], to which the [[Kitsune Saiguu]] and [[Yae Miko]] belong.
**It is also the homophone with the {{Lang|{{w|White Tiger (mythology)|Byakko}}|ja=白虎|ja_tl=White Tiger,}} one of the {{w|Four Symbols}} of the Chinese constellations, who is usually known as the {{Lang|White Tiger|zh=白虎}} of the West, having autumn as the season it represents.
