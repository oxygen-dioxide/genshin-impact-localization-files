==Profile==
When many of Paran's relatives were expelled from the [[Flower-Feather Clan]] for "doing something terrible,"<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Beat the Clock: 24 Hours}}</ref> he was allowed to remain. Many who were exiled still keep in touch with him, occasionally sending him messages.<ref name="Paran">{{Ref/NPC|Paran}}</ref>

One of the exiled family members, his uncle [[Hawka]], became a prominent [[Saurian]] trafficker, and has since been trying to persuade Paran to join his operation.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Farewell, Final Saurus Cracker}}</ref> It is unclear whether he does this out of care or for ulterior motives, but Paran believes that it is the latter.<ref name="Paran" />

In ''[[From One Case to Another]]'', Hawka attempts to coerce Paran into joining him. He has [[Quilla]] frame Paran for the kidnapping of a [[Qucusaur]] in order to paint him as a Saurian trafficker, hoping that this would ruin his reputation and force him to turn to Hawka for help. However, the plot ultimately fails.

Paran, for his part, says that he prefers his current life and just wants his uncle to stop bothering him.<ref name="Paran" />

===Appearance===
Paran has a thin build, with greyish eyes and blond hair that sweeps to the side at the front. He wears the typical male outfit of the Flower-Feather Clan; a red-and-white coat with a fur-lined hood, navy pants, an ornate necklace, and [[Qucusaur]] riding gear.

;(Talk to Paran and [[Quilla]] prior to completing ''From One Case to Another'')
:'''Paran:''' Sorry, Ms. Quilla. Carrewoof didn't hurt you, did he? He isn't usually nearly that enthusiastic towards strangers.
:'''Quilla:''' Haha, I'm fine. I love interacting with animals. If anything, the affection makes me happy.
:'''Quilla:''' By the way, Hawka misses you a lot. When he heard that I would be coming here soon, he had me ask about how you've been doing.
:'''Paran:''' ...Uncle Hawka? Why would be{{sic}} care about me? Ugh, I'm sorry, we've had some clashes, but they aren't worth mentioning...

;(Talk to Paran after completing ''From One Case to Another'')
:'''Paran:''' Ah, it's you. Welcome.
:{{DIcon}} How have you been?
::'''Paran:''' Not much has changed. I've got as much work to do as before... but that's fine. Better to have something to do rather than nothing.
::'''Paran:''' *sigh* Were I to go wandering around, I fear people would start talking again, *sigh*...
:{{DIcon}} About Quilla...
::'''Paran:''' I never imagined that Uncle Hawka had commissioned her to frame me and drag me down into the mud...
::'''Paran:''' I'm sure you've heard the talk about how quite a few family members of mine have been expelled from the tribe. Yet here I remain.
::'''Paran:''' Those who've headed out from the tribe to the rest of [[Natlan]] sometimes send messages to me, and Uncle Hawka once did just that, saying he could help me find work at the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]]...
::'''Paran:''' How could I agree to that? I prefer my current life, so I hope they just give up and quit bothering me &mdash; and the sooner, the better.
::'''Paran:''' Speaking of which, the [[Saurus Crackers]] they've supplied have been of really good quality, apart from that last batch... If only we could get our hands on them someplace else.
:{{DIcon}} I shan't disturb you any longer.
::'''Paran:''' Have a safe journey.
