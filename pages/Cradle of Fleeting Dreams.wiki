{{Dialogue Start}}
:...Couldn't take it. [[Liriwu|I]] threw up every last drop of the Grainfruit Soup I'd drunk this morning while no one was looking. Still can't stop my hands from shaking.
:&nbsp;
:Why were these (...) ever permitted to exist? If there really was a secret treasure that could destroy the [[Abyss]], then why are those things still moving?
:&nbsp;
:At least... at least they can now find peace. Their souls may have been ripped to shreds oh so long ago, but at least... They no longer need to exist in that state...

:Uncle [[Copan]] tried to comfort me by saying that they can be freed so long as we find the [[Och-Kan|Python King]]'s treasure. But were that the case, why did the Python King die in the Abyss?
:&nbsp;
:No. I must not fear. I must not waver. If even the Spiritcaller from the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]] were to falter...
:&nbsp;
:I must... For everyone...
