{{Description|They boldly venture "up to the stars, down to the abyss," or so their motto would have you believe. In truth, they take on jobs ranging from finding kittens to exploring domains. Well, you cannot afford to gaze at the stars or the abyss without an honest job.|World Map description}}

The '''Adventurers' Guild''', indicated by {{DIcon|AdvGuild}} icon on the map, is an organization that serves as an adventurer-for-hire service for the people and other organizations in the seven nations of [[Teyvat]]. The Guild collates all the complex word-of-mouth information it receives and redistributes it in the form of quests and adventures assigned to adventurers.

Each adventurer is issued an Adventure Handbook, which is presumably, at the least, used to record their completed commissions and part of the system the Guild uses to pay out commission rewards. Once a Handbook is full, the adventurer can get a new one. Each Adventure Handbook has a unique serial number, which is also recorded when issued to an adventurer. It is unknown if old Handbooks are kept by the Guild, but their serial numbers become part of the adventurer's file.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Fontaine Research Institute Chronicles}}</ref>

A commissioner can choose to leave a designated commission with the Guild, which is only offered to the adventurer/adventurers listed on it by name.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Festive Elegance}}</ref>

While the identity of the commission submiter is usually learned by the adventurer in the process of carrying out a commission (such as whom to turn it in to, or asking a person involved of the details), if it's not necessary to know their identity, the Guild is obligated to keep that confidential. If, however, the adventurer is able to figure that out from a tidbit of information about the submitter that is not related to the commission itself, that is not any of the Guild's business.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Hymn of Tir Yazad (Part 2)}}</ref>

Little is known about the origins of the Adventurers' Guild. However, based on [[Lan]]'s dialogue, the guild's main headquarters is based in [[Snezhnaya]].

==Organization==
{{Quote
|Ad astra abyssosque!
|Adventurers' guild motto
}}
The guild has several branches throughout [[Teyvat]], one for each of the major regions. Each branch has a branch master who is in charge of formulating entrance exams for new adventurers.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Adventurer's Entrance Exam}}</ref>

Branch masters can provide newly-arrived adventures to their region information and recommendations on where to go or not to go. Branch masters also seem to keep an eye out for ways that can keep adventurers safer when exploring ruins, and the more available and applicable the information can be to all adventurers anywhere, the better. An example would be a highly visual-based guidebook as many adventures are illiterate, or wooden models of machines and contraptions often found within ancient ruins kept at a guild branch for demonstration purposes, which is normally only learned about through word-of-mouth from other adventurers.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Early Learning Mechanism#A Failed Reference Book...?}}</ref>

The guild has two known departments, which are:
* Intelligence Department
* Recruitment Department

===Intelligence Department===
The Intelligence department of the Adventurers' Guild typically does not undertake commissions. Instead, they provide adventurers with vital information that they can use to complete their commissions. This department is split into two groups: the investigators and the organizers. The investigators are in the field and handle the collection of information, while the organizers take all of the information gathered by the investigators and organize it before providing it to adventurers.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Alfry}}</ref>

The organizers ranks the commissions based on difficulty (from Rank S to, presumably, Rank D) to help new adventurers adjust to the adventurer lifestyle, while also supporting veteran adventurers and allowing them to adventure more freely.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Adventurous Acquaintance}}</ref>

The adventurers handle the commissions taken to the guild.

==Branches==
====Mondstadt Branch====
The Mondstadt Branch of the Adventurers' Guild, led by [[Cyrus (Mondstadt)|Cyrus]], has a severe need for members. The message board in the [[Angel's Share]] is filled with recruitment ads from the guild. Cyrus even uses stories of dangerous adventures and bravery as a recruitment tactic towards the youth.

== Trivia==
*Although based in Snezhnaya, [[Fatui/Enemies|Fatui]] members are listed in the Adventurer Handbook as enemies.
**Furthermore, the fact that some of the commissions they hand out lists Fatui as targets suggests that the Adventurers' Guild is completely independent from them.
*[[Doolan]] finds the Adventurers' Guild uniforms boring.
*The [[Traveler]], [[Fischl]], [[Bennett]], [[Dr. Livingstone]], and [[Katheryne]] do not wear the standard uniform of the Adventurers' Guild despite being members of the guild.
*While she is no longer adventuring, [[Valerina]] still wears the uniform of the Adventurers' Guild.
*The motto "Ad Astra Abyssosque" is Latin for "To the Stars and the Abyss."
*The eight-pointed star can be seen at the front and back of the standard uniform of the Adventurers' Guild.
