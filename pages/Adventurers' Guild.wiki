{{Description|They boldly venture "up to the stars, down to the abyss," or so their motto would have you believe. In truth, the take on jobs ranging from finding kittens to exploring domains. Well, you cannot afford to gaze at the stars or the abyss without an honest joy|World Map description
}}

The '''Adventurers' Guild''', indicated by {{DIcon|AdvGuild}} icon on the map, is an organization that serves as an adventurer-for-hire service for the people and other organizations in the seven nations of [[Teyvat]]. The Guild collates all the complex word-of-mouth information it receives and redistributes it in the form of quests and adventures assigned to adventurers.

Little is known about the origins of the Adventurers' Guild. However, based on [[Lan]]'s dialogue, the guild's main headquarters is based in [[Snezhnaya]].

By speaking to [[Katheryne]], the player can:
#Claim Bonus Daily [[Commission]] Rewards
#Claim [[Adventure Rank]] Rewards
#Dispatch Characters on [[Expeditions]]

==Organization==
{{Quote
|Ad astra abyssosque!
|Adventurers' guild motto
}}
The guild has several branches throughout [[Teyvat]], one for each of the major regions. Each branch has a branch master who is in charge of formulating entrance exams for new adventurers.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Adventurer's Entrance Exam}}</ref>

The guild has two known departments, which are:
* Intelligence Department 
* Recruitment Department

===Intelligence Department===
The Intelligence department of the Adventurers' Guild typically does not undertake commissions. Instead, they provide adventurers with vital information that they can use to complete their commissions. This department is split into two groups: the investigators and the organizers. The investigators are in the field and handle the collection of information, while the organizers take all of the information gathered by the investigators and organize it before providing it to adventurers.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Alfry}}</ref>

The organizers ranks the commissions based on difficulty (from Rank S to, presumably, Rank D) to help new adventurers adjust to the adventurer lifestyle, while also supporting veteran adventurers and allowing them to adventure more freely.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Adventurous Acquaintance}}</ref>

The adventurers handle the commissions taken to the guild.

==Branches==
====Mondstadt Branch====
The Mondstadt Branch of the Adventurers' Guild, led by [[Cyrus]], has a severe need for members. The message board in the [[Angel's Share]] is filled with recruitment ads from the guild. [[Cyrus]] even uses stories of dangerous adventures and bravery as a recruitment tactic towards the youth.

==Trivia==
* Although based in Snezhnaya, [[Fatui/Enemies|Fatui]] members are listed in the Adventurer Handbook as enemies.
** Furthermore, the fact that some of the commissions they hand out lists Fatui as targets suggests that the Adventurers' Guild is completely independent from them.
* [[Doolan]] finds the Adventurers' Guild uniforms as boring.
* [[Fischl]], [[Bennett]], [[Dr. Livingstone]], and [[Katheryne]] do not wear the guilds standard uniform despite being members of the guild.
* The motto "Ad Astra Abyssosque" is Latin for "To the Stars and the Abyss."
* The eight-pointed star can be seen at the front and back of the standard uniform of the Adventurers' Guild.
