==Description==
Legend has it that a hero who fell into the abyss left this strange bow behind, the body of which shines brightly like pearls and secret silver.<br>
The tint of the string is like the blackest seas or the lightless void, and it is as silent as empty vacuum.

In the grand days of old, [[Praetorian Golem|golems]] formed an army and fought against the dragons in the [[Sea of Bygone Eras|depths of the sea]].<br>
The dragons, born of the [[Primordial Sea|sea]], were a brutal race ruled by a King named [[Scylla]],<br>
At that time, the Dragon King Scylla recruited a horde of [[Fontaine|barbarians]] and [[Bathysmal Vishap|vishaps]], driving them toward the threshold of the [[Remuria|ancient nation]],<br>
And the bow-wielding army moved forward to intercept and resist them, until the great [[Boethius|Harmost]] sealed away Scylla's power...

Afterwards, the once-glorious kingdom became nothing more than a bed of ruins scattered across the seafloor,<br>
But the remnants of the golem army continued fighting the descendants of the dragons in places the sunlight couldn't reach...<br>
The still deeps had never been perturbed by bloody battle, but its petrified heart gradually began to collapse.<br>
The last archer and the lone descendant of the dragon eventually reached a peace agreement.

The endless clash of tooth and nail had grown vexing,<br>
And so sword and bow would no longer draw any gaze in the lightless abyss.<br>
The knights of the lost nation and the vishap warriors could not help but burst out laughing,<br>
Discarding their burdensome weapons, as if finally freed from a meaningless blood-feud...

As for what later happened in the stillness beneath the ocean depths, it was interpreted and re-interpreted by countless operas, far into the future.<br>
Some say that both betrayed each of their homelands, and built new settlements for exiles...<br>
Like this ancient, magnificent bow, many stories eventually sink into the still, silent deeps, becoming naught but fanciful legends.<br>
"Savagery" at last had mastery over the former lands of the kingdom, and many stories and songs are now little more than harmless, fictional dramas...
