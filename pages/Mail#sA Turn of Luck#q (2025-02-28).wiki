|text      = Uh, this is the third letter I've written today. The first one got soaked halfway through by spilled tea... The second one was swept away by the wind the moment I stepped outside. I guess... it was in a hurry to get its Gliding License?

Haha, no worries though &mdash; this one will definitely make it to you!

Now, back to the point. Yesterday, while I was out adventuring, I got hit on the head by a random rock. Normally, that kind of thing happens all the time, but this time, it left a huge bump! I thought the rock seemed special, and sure enough, when I brought it back, my dads said it was excellent [[Forging Materials|forging material]]. I've included it with the letter. Hope you can put it to good use!

I'll be taking it easy these next few days to heal up, so don't worry about me. Besides, finding such a great rock feels like a sign that my luck is turning around!

Here's to the [[Benny's Adventure Team]] heading to even greater places in the new year &mdash; let's go!
