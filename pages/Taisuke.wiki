==Profile==
Taisuke is an adventurer with the Inazuma's Adventurers' Guild. During the events of [[Seirai Stormchasers]], he and [[Eiko]] were sent to investigate a way to calm the storm on Seirai Island.

He loves cats<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Neko Is a Cat: Cat and Stone}}</ref> and is very enthusiastic about [[Neko]], willingly wanting to go above and beyond to help her whenever he finds out she requires assistance in the [[World Quest]] series [[Neko Is a Cat]]. When he had found out Neko was a talking cat during Seirai Stormchasers, he wanted to seal the [[The Warding Stones of Seirai|Warding Stones]] quickly just so he could meet her more quickly. Despite this, he is thoughtful and seems to have proper manners and etiquette, wanting to get a greeting gift before meeting Neko.

He seems quite knowledgeable about birds, as after defeating the [[Thunder Manifestation]] in Seirai Stormchasers where the Traveler picks up a [[Peculiar Pinion (Quest Item)|Peculiar Pinion]], he was able to analyze the feather's pattern, texture, dimensions and ratio to figure out the bird's size.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Seirai Stormchasers: Part IV}}</ref>

He has a lot of respect for his fellow adventurer Eiko, stating that she is skilled and has sound judgement as an adventurer.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Seirai Stormchasers: Part I}}</ref>

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Taisuke:''' I have to bring a gift for Lady [[Neko]]...
:{{DIcon}} Lady... Neko?
::'''Taisuke:''' Of course! She's the provisional head priestess of this [[Asase Shrine]], you know? She's a very distinguished cat indeed!
::'''Taisuke:''' Going to see her empty-handed would just be rude &mdash; so I must prepare some sort of greeting gift.
::'''Taisuke:''' I originally wanted to go to [[Narukami Island]] to prepare some gifts, but if we went back there, I'm sure that Miss [[Eiko]] would drag me off to the Guild...
::'''Taisuke:''' If that happened, I might never get another chance to come to [[Seirai Island]]...
::{{DIcon}} You could just make some yourself.
::'''Taisuke:''' Exactly! That's exactly what I was thinking too! Seirai Island is dotted by a great number of shallows, so I decided to make some tools and go over there later to catch a few fish!
::'''Taisuke:''' Once that's done, we can make some grilled fish, some smoked fish, some dried fish, some fish soup...
::'''Taisuke:''' Oh, I do hope Lady Neko will like them!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Taisuke:''' Goodbye. Safe travels.
