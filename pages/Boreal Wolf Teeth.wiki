==Lore==
The gods used to have the responsibility to love all people, but Boreas was an odd case.<ref name="Milk Tooth"/> He considered humans a disappointment, but he still accepted wanderers<ref name="Milk Tooth"/> and adopted babies, which he believed were innocent.<ref name="Cracked Tooth">{{Ref/Item|Boreal Wolf's Cracked Tooth}}</ref> If the adopted children and wolf pack chose each other, then they would become a Lupical, or fated family.<ref name="Cracked Tooth"/>
Boreas, believing that he hated humans, assumed he was unable to envision a happy life for humanity, and thus was unworthy to become Anemo Archon.<ref name="Bor Nostalgia">{{Ref/Item|Boreal Wolf's Nostalgia}}</ref> He decided to remove that option for himself, but in truth he looked kindly upon those abandoned by the world.<ref name="Bor Nostalgia"/>
