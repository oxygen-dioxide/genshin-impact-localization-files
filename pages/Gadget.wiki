'''Gadgets''' are utility items that can be used by the player for various purposes. It is the sixth tab in the [[Inventory]].

Some gadgets can be equipped into the Quick-Use slot, allowing them to be repeatedly used with ease, while others can only be used or placed from the inventory.

Non-consumable gadgets have a cooldown after they are used. Unlike combat-related cooldowns, gadget cooldowns will continue to decrease even while the game is paused.

==How to Obtain==
Gadgets can be obtained from a variety of locations, most commonly during [[World Quests]] and [[Events]]. Some Gadgets require the player to [[Craft]] or [[Forge]] them after obtaining and using the corresponding [[Instructions]] or [[Diagram]] to learn how to make it. These Instructions and Diagrams can be obtained from increasing the [[Reputation]] level in various nations and the [[Frostbearing Tree's Gratitude]].
