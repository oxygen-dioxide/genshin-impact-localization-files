|vo_01_01_tx         = With the flames to guide us across time, we took a land shrouded in darkness, and used our own blood and tears to forge it into a home. Now, our journey continues, and a new chapter awaits. As the current [[Pyro Archon]], allow me, Mavuika, to light your way forward.

|vo_05_01_tx         = Oh, my hair? Don't worry, these are friendly flames &mdash; they won't burn you or incinerate anything. Although, I think our enemies will find that it's a bad idea to play with fire, if you know what I mean.

|vo_05_02_tx         = Every Pyro Archon throughout Natlan's history has left behind important knowledge and memories within the [[Sacred Flame]], for the benefit of future successors. When inherited, the sheer amount of information can impact your sense of self. So, I chose to leave behind this phrase, "Before you become one with flame, be proud of who you are now."

|vo_06_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Us - Fighting Side By Side.ogg
|vo_06_01_tx         = A plan is a reliable guide, but it's not an unchangeable or divine decree. Five hundred years ago, I could never have anticipated your arrival. But, after meeting you, I knew factoring you into my plan would be worth it. Judging from the outcome, choosing to fight by your side was unequivocally the right choice.

|vo_06_02_title      = About Us: [[Ancient Name]]s
|vo_06_02_quest      = Incandescent Ode of Resurrection
|vo_06_02_friendship = 6
|vo_06_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Us - Ancient Names.ogg
|vo_06_02_tx         = You may not have realized this, but your ancient name, Tumaini, will have a significant impact on Natlan for years to come. When future generations speak this name, they will think about this battle and the efforts of all our heroes. Our names &mdash; Tumaini and Kiongozi &mdash; are now linked and will live on in perpetuity.

<!-- Miscellany I -->
|vo_07_01_title      = About the [[Vision]]
|vo_07_01_friendship = 4
|vo_07_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About the Vision.ogg
|vo_07_01_tx         = For humans, Visions and Ancient Names are both gifts from the gods, where the former bestows [[Element]]al power and the latter spiritual inspiration. However, I have always believed that no external factor is a condition for greatness &mdash; heroism comes from within.

|vo_07_02_title      = Something to Share
|vo_07_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share.ogg
|vo_07_02_tx         = When I was little, my father told me that a barrel can only hold as much water as the shortest plank. If you want to reach your full potential, you need to be willing to become the weakest link, to acknowledge your shortcomings and learn from others. That doesn't make you a failure, it pushes you to succeed.

|vo_07_03_title      = Interesting Things
|vo_07_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} Interesting Things.ogg
|vo_07_03_tx         = [[Yumkasaur Whelp|Baby Yumkasaurs]] are incredibly cute, and my [[Saurian]] companion, [[Hitata]], was especially clingy. He used to jump into my arms the minute he saw me, even from quite a distance. My sister, [[Hine]], would get so jealous &mdash; whenever she saw Hitata run towards me, she would do the same. Before I knew it, I would have an armful of baby Saurian and baby sister at the same time, haha.
|vo_07_03_mention    = Hine

<!-- About Others -->
|vo_08_01_title      = About [[Xilonen]]
|vo_08_01_friendship = 4
|vo_08_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Xilonen.ogg
|vo_08_01_tx         = Xilonen is one of the best craftsmen in Natlan. She has the ability to forge Ancient Names and is well-versed in [[Secret Source]] technology. Not to mention, she never backs away from a challenge, even when it's completely uncharted territory. The process isn't without twists and turns &mdash; like design changes and other modifications &mdash; but the results speak for themselves.
|vo_08_01_mention    = Xilonen

|vo_08_02_title      = About [[Citlali]]
|vo_08_02_quest      = The Rainbow Destined to Burn
|vo_08_02_friendship = 4
|vo_08_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Citlali.ogg
|vo_08_02_tx         = Many people find her strange or difficult to get along with. But, this is how I see it &mdash; Citlali doesn't concern herself with trivial matters, but she's always there when it counts. I'm sure you've seen that for yourself. She's someone who can easily tunnel vision and get herself embroiled in trouble, so I try to keep certain things from her. But, she can see right through me... She's too sharp.
|vo_08_02_mention    = Citlali

|vo_08_03_title      = About [[Chasca]]
|vo_08_03_quest      = Incandescent Ode of Resurrection
|vo_08_03_friendship = 4
|vo_08_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Chasca.ogg
|vo_08_03_tx         = Being able to survive under the influence of [[Abyss]]al corrosion was already a miracle, but thanks to the people and Saurians of this land, she even found a reason not just to survive, but to live. I have every faith in her fortitude, but I will still do what I can to make this land a "gentler" place &mdash; even the strongest among us need a break sometimes.
|vo_08_03_mention    = Chasca

|vo_08_04_title      = About [[Ororon]]
|vo_08_04_quest      = The Rainbow Destined to Burn
|vo_08_04_friendship = 4
|vo_08_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Ororon.ogg
|vo_08_04_tx         = In my opinion, Ororon's true personality is very different from what he projects on the outside &mdash; like lava covered in ice. [[Masters of the Night-Wind|His tribe]] and his friends bring him peace, but his drive to protect them and his need to become a hero leave him restless. It's inadvisable to act on impulse, but these are precious qualities all the same.
|vo_08_04_mention    = Ororon

|vo_08_05_title      = About [[Iansan]]: Being Targeted
|vo_08_05_friendship = 4
|vo_08_05_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Iansan - Being Targeted.ogg
|vo_08_05_tx         = A lot of people underestimated Iansan during her first few [[Pilgrimage]]s after receiving her Ancient Name, and singled her out during the team stage as an easy target. Even though she never lost, the constant challengers drained her stamina and affected her ranking, which only made people more likely to target her...
|vo_08_05_mention    = Iansan

|vo_08_06_title      = About Iansan: Proving Yourself
|vo_08_06_friendship = 4
|vo_08_06_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Iansan - Proving Yourself.ogg
|vo_08_06_tx         = My advice to her was this &mdash; people are less likely to mess with someone whose strength is undeniable, so all she needed to do was to prove it. Well, she decided to do just that... by challenging me in the arena, hahaha. Yeah, I definitely didn't see that coming! In the end, she put up quite the fight, and no one underestimated her again.
|vo_08_06_mention    = Iansan

|vo_08_07_title      = About [[Mualani]]
|vo_08_07_quest      = Black Stone Under a White Stone
|vo_08_07_friendship = 4
|vo_08_07_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Mualani.ogg
|vo_08_07_tx         = In terms of personality, Mualani and [[Tupac]] are completely different, and yet both inherited the name, Umoja. Unity lies not in a particular action, but in a state of mind &mdash; a willingness to give your all for your nation, family and friends. But, I doubt Mualani was thinking about any of that back then. She knew one thing to be true &mdash; that [[Kachina]]'s life was worth any risk to her own.
|vo_08_07_mention    = Mualani,Tupac,Kachina

|vo_08_08_title      = About [[Kinich]]
|vo_08_08_quest      = Black Stone Under a White Stone
|vo_08_08_friendship = 4
|vo_08_08_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Kinich.ogg
|vo_08_08_tx         = In addition to the [[Turnfire]], Malipo has another meaning, "cost" or "price." It may seem less overtly heroic compared to the other Ancient Names, but in truth, Malipo teaches us to be calm and analytical &mdash; to ask the questions people may not want to hear. Without people who possess these qualities, it's just too easy for the rest of us to act on impulse and emotion, and make decisions we'll come to regret.
|vo_08_08_mention    = Kinich

|vo_08_09_title      = About [[Kachina]]
|vo_08_09_quest      = Black Stone Under a White Stone
|vo_08_09_friendship = 4
|vo_08_09_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Kachina.ogg
|vo_08_09_tx         = After you rescued Kachina from the [[Night Kingdom]], I visited her family with Chief [[Pacal]], and brought a few gifts to once again apologize for what happened. Kachina's time in the Night Kingdom left her with many scars she will have to carry into the future &mdash; scars she should never have had to bear... And for that, the fault is mine.
|vo_08_09_mention    = Kachina,Pacal

|vo_08_10_title      = About [[Varesa]]
|vo_08_10_friendship = 4
|vo_08_10_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Varesa.ogg
|vo_08_10_tx         = During the Pilgrimage, I cover all the expenses at the [[Weary Inn]], and without fail, there's always an order for a party tray for eighty. I used to assume it was someone ordering for a large group of friends, but as it turns out... Varesa ordered it all for herself.
|vo_08_10_mention    = Varesa

|vo_08_11_title      = About [[Ifa]]
|vo_08_11_friendship = 4
|vo_08_11_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Ifa.ogg
|vo_08_11_tx         = The truly great doctors often possess vast medical knowledge as well as great communication skills. And, when the patient and the doctor do not speak the same language, observation and empathy become even more important. That's why Ifa can make friends with just about anyone.<br>Suffice it to say, if someone is on bad terms with Ifa &mdash; human or saurian &mdash; I doubt the problem lies with him, haha.
|vo_08_11_mention    = Ifa

|vo_08_12_title      = About [[The Captain]]
|vo_08_12_quest      = Incandescent Ode of Resurrection
|vo_08_12_friendship = 4
|vo_08_12_file       = VO_{language}{character} About The Captain.ogg
|vo_08_12_tx         = For him, I suspect the past five hundred years felt endless. When someone is deprived of death, life becomes a journey with no end, and the human spirit easily grows weary. And yet, he managed to seize the only chance of victory to arrive at the end he sought all along. I have great respect for warriors like him.
|vo_08_12_mention    = Capitano

|vo_08_13_title      = About [[The Seven]]
|vo_08_13_quest      = Incandescent Ode of Resurrection
|vo_08_13_friendship = 4
|vo_08_13_file       = VO_{language}{character} About The Seven.ogg
|vo_08_13_tx         = To be quite honest, you likely know them better than me. However, their nations continue to survive and thrive to this day, and that would be impossible without strong leadership. Once this chapter of Natlan's history comes to a close, I plan on strengthening our relationship with other nations so that Natlan can continue to grow.

|vo_08_14_title      = About [[Yumemizuki Mizuki]]
|vo_08_14_friendship = 4
|vo_08_14_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Yumemizuki Mizuki.ogg
|vo_08_14_tx         = Ah, she left a very positive impression. When she first arrived in Natlan, I heard that she had a great deal of interest in our hot springs and spent quite some time studying their properties. But, it wasn't for profit. She was interested in their role in improving mental health. Such a pure cause deserved our support and respect.<br>Speaking of which... Is it true that the [[Ei|current Archon]] of [[Inazuma]] enjoys hot springs as well? If that's the case, I believe I've found a good starting point for our next conversation.

|vo_09_03_tx         = Of course, I also have many regrets. Thanks to my knowledge and strength, I'm an effective problem-solver, but most of the time, all people really need is companionship... I've disappointed many people in that regard, but duty stops for no one. Questioning my path will only bring more pain &mdash; I owe it to myself to stick to my convictions.

As I rose up into the air, I could feel the passion of our warriors, the determination of our people, and the pain of our fallen... It's a scene I've witnessed once before.

|vo_09_05_tx         = With our triumph over the Abyss, my most important duty as Pyro Archon came to an end. Five hundred years ago, I chose to fight for a future that likely wouldn't include me &mdash; so I was prepared for that result. So, when that future actually arrived, I was at a loss... But, you've inspired me. Exploration, curiosity, and dedication to others &mdash; that's the path forward.
