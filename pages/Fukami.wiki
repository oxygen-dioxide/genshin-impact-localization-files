{{Lang|'''Fukami'''|ja=深見|ja_rm=Fukami}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in {{Quest|Transient Dreams}}.

==Profile==
Fukami was a yoriki of the [[Inazuma Shogunate]] who likely perished during the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago alongside [[Fujiki]] and another yoriki samurai. He was a wielder of an [[Electro]] [[Vision]].

When the [[Traveler]] and [[Ei]] were investigating [[rifthounds]] attacking the roots of the [[Sacred Sakura]], they were led to a cave underneath the [[Araumi]] area. When [[The Shogun]] began to resist Ei's control over their body, Fujiki, Fukami and the unnamed yoriki manifested. Seeing their Archon in danger, the three quickly sprung into action and defended her from the rifthounds. After telling the Traveler to bring the Shogun back to [[Inazuma City]], they passed on peacefully.

===Appearance===
Fukami wears a lavender ''shitagi'', indigo ''kobakama'', and he is barefoot in ''waraji'' sandals. His eggplant-colored armor with dark gold accents consists of ''dou'' (breastplate) with the Inazuma Shogunate's crest, ''han-kote'' (half-armored sleeves), ''haidate'' (thigh guards), and ''sune-ate'' (greaves). He is also wearing ''sode'' (shoulder armor) on his left shoulder. Fukami carries a katana at his hips on the left side with the blade facing down and his [[Vision]] on the right side.
