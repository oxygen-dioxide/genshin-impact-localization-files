|description = A glaze crystal produced in the depths of [[The Chasm: Underground Mines|The Chasm]], this special Glaze Sand Crystal ore was one of many scattered about during the battle against the giant ruin machine. Glaze Sand Crystal ore is a regional specialty of The Chasm, but this one is different from the rest.<br>Under the radiance of the blue crystal and the power of the Abyss, a strange spiral pattern has emerged within this stone, and it is cold, almost chilling to the touch.<br>This once smooth crystal has been transformed into this shape by the great might that descended from the heavens and the miasma that arose from the earth's depths &mdash; and perhaps the form it has taken is itself a warning unto mortals.<br>If the interaction of these forces alone could twist stone and metal thus, if that ordinary heroine was truly able to witness the end of the pitch-dark path, how would she have faced the discovery she would make?
