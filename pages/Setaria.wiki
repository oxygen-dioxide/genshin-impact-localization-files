==Profile==
Setaria hails from the [[Great Red Sand]]. At some point, she became a scholar and joined the [[Sumeru Akademiya]], eventually serving as [[Azar]]'s entourage. She became involved with the sages' plan to create a new god out of [[Scaramouche]], despite her misgivings.

She was initially seen accompanying him to confront the [[Zubayr Theater]] over their celebration of the [[Sabzeruz Festival]], although she was later replaced with a copy due to the sages creating a dream samsara to harvest the energy of the inhabitants to power Scaramouche's ascension.

Despite the sages' efforts, the dream samsara was broken, although they appeared to have gotten the desired result nonetheless. [[Nahida]], possessing the puppet [[Katheryne]], suggested using Setaria's connections to her homeland as a means to convince her to join their cause. She managed to convince her after manipulating several others into declaring themselves followers of the [[Scarlet King]], although unbeknownst to her, the sages had planted a listening device on her. Setaria attempted to acquire incriminating papers from the Akademiya, but was caught and detained.

Setaria's meeting with Nahida made her realize her that she should become a teacher and bring knowledge to her people. Like the meaning of her name, she wants become a star for the people and share knowledge to her people who were deprived from learning. So, she resolved to return to the desert and proceeded to muster the courage to tell Azar, but when she arrived at his office, he was nowhere to be seen and [[Cyno]] informed her that he was removed. She later accompanied him to meet with [[Rahman]] at [[Aaru Village]], where they were discussing ways to increase the quality of life for the people of the desert, as they had been severely neglected by the former Akademiya.

==Trivia==
*Based on [[Kulsoom]]'s dialogue, Setaria may hail from [[Aaru Village]].
*''[[The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin (I)]]'' mentions the "dancers of Setaria," which suggests that there was an ancient city-state or group of people in the desert also named Setaria. Setaria shares this trait with [[Tighnari]], whose name is shared with the people of [[Tulaytullah]], who were known as the Tighnarians.

===Etymology===
*The name Setaria is most likely derived from the word {{lang|''Sitara''|sa=सितारा}} meaning "star."
