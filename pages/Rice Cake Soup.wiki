==Trivia==
*The Japanese name of the dish translates to {{Lang|Everyday-Life Oden|ja=市井おでん|ja_rm=Shisei Oden}} and refers to ''{{w|oden}}'', a type of Japanese one-pot dishes.
*The original Chinese version uses the name {{Lang|Everyday-Life Zazhu|zh=市井杂煮|zh_rm=Shìjǐng Zázhǔ}}, where ''zazhu'' (杂煮) means "mixed boiled dishes," including Japanese ''oden''.<ref>Zhihu: [https://www.zhihu.com/question/21856189 日本正宗传统的关东煮是什么样子，味道和做法又和国内经常吃到的有什么不一样？]</ref> However, in terms of characters, the hanzi 杂煮 in Simplified Chinese corresponds to the kanji 雑煮 in Japanese. In Japan, 雑煮 is read as ''{{w|zōni|zouni}}'' and refers to a soup containing Japanese rice cakes (''{{w|mochi}}''), which is typically served in the New Year. This is likely why the English version translated the name as "Rice Cake Soup."
*They are [[Thoma]]'s favorite food.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Thoma|Favorite Food}}</ref>
