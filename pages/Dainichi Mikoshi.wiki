The {{Lang|'''Dainichi Mikoshi'''|ja=大日御輿|ja_tl=Great Sun Mikoshi}} is a subarea in [[Enkanomiya]], [[Inazuma]]. It is an artificial sun that was created by [[Aberaku no Mikoto]] in order to protect Byakuyakoku from the [[Bathysmal Vishaps]]. It can be toggled on and off to control Enkanomiya's day and night, respectively called '''Whitenight''' and '''Evernight'''. The subarea contains the Dainichi Mikoshi structure itself and the surrounding area.

Before the establishment of the Inazuman Watatsumi culture it was known as '''Hyperion''' (or '''Byakuya no Hikari''').<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent}}</ref> Aberaku also called it the '''Helios'''.<ref>World Quest Series: [[Hyperion's Dirge]]</ref>

==Lore==
{{See also|Enkanomiya#Lore}}
The Dainichi Mikoshi is an artificial sun that was created in the depths of [[Byakuyakoku]] by [[Aberaku]]. When Byakuyakoku fell into the ocean, it was terrorized by the [[Dragonheirs of the Depths]], which are now called [[Bathysmal Vishaps]]. The people of Byakuyakoku pleaded to be saved from the Dragonheirs, but the [[Primordial One]] and three of its four shining shades did not answer. Only [[Istaroth]], one of the other shining shades, heard and taught Aberaku enough knowledge such that he could create Dainichi Mikoshi, which he called "Helios, the divine chariot of the sun." The light of Helios drove away the Dragonheirs and so Whitenight came and Evernight was banished, ushering in the first year of Sun and Moon.<ref name="tokoyokoku">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|1|The Serpent and Drakes of Tokoyokoku}}</ref>

After Aberaku built the Dainichi Mikoshi and staved off the threat of the Dragonheirs, peace was established in Byakuyakoku. But in the second year of Sun and Moon, a cabal of corrupt nobles<ref name="tokoyokoku" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lotus Eater}}</ref> would manipulate the people into worshipping the Dainichi Mikoshi as a god, and chose a child to be their puppet ruler, called the [[Sunchild]], and rule over the land.<ref name="dirge">{{Ref/Quest|Hyperion's Dirge (Quest)}}</ref> Aberaku opposed this, so the Sunchild accused Aberaku of high treason and imprisoned him.<ref name="dirge" /> On the tenth year of Sun and Moon, Aberaku died in prison and his clothes and body were enshrined in various places in acknowledgement of his achievements for creating the Helios. However, this had the effect of splitting apart his soul into fragments, rendering him unable to rest for many years.<ref name="dirge" />

Eventually, a Byakuyakoku child would discover [[Orobashi]], who was hiding in a cave due to having escaped from the [[Archon War]]. The child would ask Orobashi to become their god, and it agreed, overthrowing the Sunchildren's rule and becoming Byakuyakoku's ruler.<ref name="tokoyokoku" /> After his arrival, Orobashi used its powers to bolster the Dainichi Mikoshi's power, enabling Enkanomiya to have a day and night cycle that could be toggled manually.<ref name="PS2021-12-26">PlayStation Blog: [https://blog.playstation.com/2021/12/26/genshin-impact-version-2-4-brings-grand-celebrations-and-a-mysterious-new-area-to-teyvat/ Genshin Impact version 2.4 brings grand celebrations and a mysterious new area to Teyvat]</ref>

==Trivia==
* There are floating rocks above the Dainichi Mikoshi from which players can glide to [[Yachimatahiko's Locus]], [[Yachimatahime's Locus]], and [[Kunado's Locus]] without falling into the depths. However, some of these rocks are unclimbable and can only be stood upon, so players will need to use [[Traveler (Geo)]]'s [[Starfell Sword]] and may need to use an additional height booster such as [[Venti]]'s [[Skyward Sonnet]] or [[Kazuha]]'s [[Chihayaburu]] to reach the top.
** Gliding to all three loci with 240 Max [[Stamina]] is possible with various combinations of Stamina restoration, decreases in gliding Stamina consumption, increases in gliding movement speed, and Talents that can be used in mid-air to gain distance or height.
* Although [[Albedo]]'s Level 3 Constellation [[Grace of Helios]] also mentions the name Helios, it is perhaps merely coincidental, since its original Chinese name {{lang|zh=太阳之华}} means the "Brilliance of the Sun" and does not make a direct reference to this Greek deity name.

===Etymology===
* The term {{ja|大日}} refers to {{Lang|{{w|Vairocana}}|ja={{Rubi|大|だい|日|にち|如|にょ|来|らい}}|ja_rm=Dainichi Nyorai}}, the sun Buddha of the {{w|Five Tathāgatas}} (Five Great Buddhas).
* {{Lang|{{w|Mikoshi}}|ja=御輿|ja_rm=Mikoshi}} refers to a sacred religious palanquin used in {{w|Shinto}}.
