===Dialogue Set #1===
''Before completing ''[[Masquerade of the Guilty]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sedene:''' Hello there. If you're lost, please turn back, Some of the rooms here are restricted access only.
:{{DIcon}} What rooms are there in here?
::'''Sedene:''' If I were to tell you, you'd get curious, so it might be best if I simply don't.
::'''Sedene:''' Monsieur [[Neuvillette]]'s office is just over by the side — this much everyone knows.
::'''Sedene:''' And, well... Lady [[Furina]] lives on the top floor. She's a real celebrity, so she really doesn't have any time slots free.
::'''Sedene:''' But not to worry, the [[Maison Gardiennage]] and the [[Marechaussee Phantom]] are also upstairs, so anyone with ill intent will not be getting very far regardless.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about Neuvillette...
:::'''Sedene:''' Monsieur Neuvillette's time slots... No, his schedule, is also very full. He can't always be found in his office, in any case.
:::'''Sedene:''' If you have a matter to put before him, please submit an application to the corresponding Gestionnaire, according to the matter at hand.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about Lady Furina...
:::'''Sedene:''' There is a special entrance that leads to her suite which isn't accessible from here. If you really wanted to get there, you can try jumping off the roof.
:::'''Sedene:''' Someone did once try to do this. Fortunately, his life didn't wind up in any danger — he is presently hard at work at the [[Fortress of Meropide]].
:{{DIcon}} Well, I'll be heading back now...
::'''Sedene:''' Alright. Don't get any ideas, now.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''After completing ''Masquerade of the Guilty''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Sedene:''' Hello there. If you're lost, please turn back, Some of the rooms here are restricted access only.
:{{DIcon}} What rooms are there in here?
::'''Sedene:''' If I were to tell you, you'd get curious, so it might be best if I simply don't.
::'''Sedene:''' Monsieur [[Neuvillette]]'s office is just over by the side — this much everyone knows.
::'''Sedene:''' What else? The [[Maison Gardiennage]] and the [[Marechaussee Phantom]] are also upstairs, so anyone with ill intent will not be getting very far regardless.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about Neuvillette...
::;(Same as before)
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about Lady Furina...
:::'''Sedene:''' Are you asking where Lady Furina Lives?
:::'''Sedene:''' She used to have an apartment on the top floor. I remember someone did once try to get in there by jumping off the roof.
:::'''Sedene:''' Fortunately, his life didn't wind up in any danger — he is presently hard at work at the [[Fortress of Meropide]].
:::'''Sedene:''' Anyway, that kind of thing won't happen again. Lady Furina left her official post to pursue a life closer to her desires.
:::'''Sedene:''' She seemed a lot more relaxed last time I saw her, so I don't think you need to worry about her.
:{{DIcon}} Well, I'll be heading back now...
:;(Same as before)
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* "Sedene" may be based on {{W|Sedna (mythology)|Sedna}}, the ocean goddess in Inuit mythology. She is often depicted as a half-woman, half-fish (or half-seal) figure, similar to the {{W|Melusine}} in European folklore.
