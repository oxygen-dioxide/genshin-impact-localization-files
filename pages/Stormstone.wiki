'''Stormstones''' are stone carvings can be lit by {{Electro}} to forge a path through thick [[fog]].

They can be found in [[Tsurumi Island]]. Before unlocking their tutorial, Paimon may say the following dialogue:
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Paimon:''' Yikes, the fog's real thick here...
:'''Paimon:''' If only there were some landmarks or lights along the way...
{{Dialogue End}}

==Overview==
A Stormstone will be permanently activated when hit by an {{Electro}} attack.

Activated Stormstones will halt the [[fog]] gauge accumulation of nearby players and reduce their accumulated fog at a rate of '''25%''' per '''0.2''' seconds. Stormstones' effects have a horizontal range of '''12m''' and a vertical range of '''10m'''.
