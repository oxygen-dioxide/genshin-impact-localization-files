==Trivia==
* The original Chinese achievement name references a line from the Chinese translation of the 1984 novel ''{{W|Dictionary of the Khazars}}'': {{Zh|死亡与睡梦同姓，只是我们不知道它们姓什么|tl=Death is the surname of sleep, but that surname is unknown to us.}} This is an allusion to Greek mythology, in which Hypnos (''sleep'') and Thanatos (''death'') are twin brothers.
