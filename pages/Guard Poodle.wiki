|description = Humanity's best friend!<br>These Fontainian pet dogs have had their fur meticulously groomed and are adorned with custom-made apparel. Parts of their body are guarded by metallic protections, granting them a bearing akin to soldiers. To most of your typical animals, or even the common bandit, this dog poses an intimidation equal to that of a human bodyguard. As such, some rich merchants have taken a special interest in owning this breed of pet, adding both novelty and security to their lives.
