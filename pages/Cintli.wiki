==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Cintli:''' Next time, I'll grow the biggest one ever, bigger than all the ones I've grown before!
:{{DIcon|Shop}} What are you selling?
::'''Cintli:''' The fruit and vegetables we grow in the [[Collective of Plenty]] of course. They're the best in the whole of Natlan!
:{{DIcon}} Bigger whats... exactly?
::'''Cintli:''' Grainfruit, [[Tomato]]es, [[Sunsettia]]s, [[Onion]]s... You name it, we grow it.
::'''Cintli:''' Did you know that I'm currently the producer of [[Natlan]]'s biggest Grainfruit?
::'''Cintli:''' But I haven't reached my limit yet, not by a long shot. I'm certain that my land has far more potential.
::'''Cintli:''' I've decided that once I've grown even bigger fruits, I'll display them in [[Yantasar]]'s store for all to see.
::'''Cintli:''' As people taste the delicious drinks she makes from the fruit and veg I grow, they'll be able to see how big and beautiful they are with their own two eyes.
::'''Cintli:''' Then my store's reputation will start booming too, haha!
::{{DIcon}} You seem very confident.
::'''Cintli:''' Of course.
::'''Cintli:''' But it's not just down to my efforts alone. Our Collective of Plenty is situated right by a volcano, where the soil was already rich and fertile to begin with.
::'''Cintli:''' And cultivating land like this is much easier thanks to the fact that we can draw upon the awesome power of the Tatankasaurs.
::'''Cintli:''' So when I said that the fruit and vegetables we grow in the Collective of Plenty are the best in the whole of Natlan, I wasn't just bragging. That's something everyone knows.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I don't believe it.
:::'''Cintli:''' Haha, is that an attempt to goad me?
:::'''Cintli:''' It's fine. Every first-time customer here receives a greeting gift, regardless of whether they buy something or not.
:::'''Cintli:''' Once you've had some, you'll know {{sic|the I}} speak only the truth.
:::;(Obtain {{Item|Grainfruit|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Cintli:''' Goodbye, and wish me the best of luck!
