==Trivia==
* The achievement's name is a reference to {{w|Daisy_Bell#In_technology_and_culture|''Daisy Bell''}}, the first song a computer "sang." The context of the achievement also makes it a reference to the 1968 film ''{{w|2001: A Space Odyssey}}'', in which the main antagonist, an AI, sings "Daisy Bell" as it is shut down.
