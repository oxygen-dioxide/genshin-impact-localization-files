'''Exorcists''' are people in [[Liyue]] who have sworn an oath to cleanse the land by hunting down members of the [[Abyss Order]], which they refer to as "evil spirits", or "demons". They are highly adept in combat and with the use of magic, which they use to track down and exorcise (neutralize) Abyss monsters that are causing problems in the surrounding areas.

A currently unnamed clan in Liyue has a high number of exorcists within its ranks. Two members within it are [[Chongyun]], and his aunt, [[Shenhe]]. Their techniques for exorcism involve [[Cryo]]-based thaumaturgy, and are highly similar.
