'''Exorcists''' are people in [[Liyue]] who have sworn an oath to cleanse the land by hunting down ghosts, spirits and demons. They are highly adept in combat, magic, and martial arts.<ref name="Chongyun Details">{{Ref/CS|Chongyun|Character Details}}</ref>

===Overview===
{{Quote|Heart be pure, evil be erased. Mind be purged, world be saved.|Mantra<ref>{{Ref/VO|Chongyun|Chat: Mantras}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/VO|Shenhe|Chat: Motto}}</ref>}}
The Tianheng Thaumaturges, an exorcism clan in Liyue, has a high number of exorcists within its ranks. [[Chongyun]]'s family is from the clan,<ref name="My Family Say">{{Ref/Mail|Mail/My Family Say... (2022-09-07)}}</ref> and his aunt, [[Shenhe]], was from a branch family.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Shenhe|Character Details}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Bygones Times Like Dust Passing|q='''Yun Jin:''' I came to Mt. Tianheng once with my father as a child. [...] No wonder the legend of "The Divine Damsel of Devastation" is said to have taken place here.}}</ref> Their techniques for exorcism involve [[Cryo]]-based thaumaturgy, and are highly similar.{{Cite}} The clan keeps books passed down through the generations which record the evil spirits they have defeated.<ref name="Field Guide">{{Ref/CS|Chongyun|Field Guide to Demons and Beasts}}</ref>

Despite his training as an exorcist, Chongyun has never personally met a spirit due to his abundance of yang energy, which banishes demons around him.<ref name="Chongyun Details" /> However, he does not allow this to stop him on his way to becoming a master exorcist, though it does hinder the accuracy of the drawings in his clan's book.<ref name="Field Guide" />

Shenhe was never trained as an exorcist by her parents,<ref>{{Ref/CS|Shenhe|Vision}}</ref> as her father was insane and her mother died when she was only five. However, Chongyun recognizes her as an adept exorcist upon witnessing her abilities.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/piiSGbsxMRQ Character Demo - "Shenhe: Crane in the Wild"]</ref> It is possible that she learned adeptal arts similar to exorcism from [[Cloud Retainer]] after becoming her disciple.

Chongyun and Shenhe's mother both used weapons to assist them in exorcism. Chongyun has a sword made of ice,<ref>{{Ref/Item|Chongyun: Spirit Blade}}</ref> and Shenhe's mother had a dagger that later ended up in Shenhe's possession.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Shenhe|Character Story 3}}</ref>

On [[Birthday/Chongyun|Chongyun's birthday]], he performed prayer rituals with the elders of the clan on Mt. Tianheng.<ref name="My Family Say" />
