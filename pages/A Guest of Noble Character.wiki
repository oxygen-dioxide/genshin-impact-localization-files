|description    = An elegantly shaped vase crafted using the unique techniques of skilled craftsmen. Its surface is as smooth as a mirror, delicate as jade, and resistant to wear and tear. It is said that it took as long as six months to make the vase. Vibrant and fragrant plum blossoms are planted inside this vase. Both the plum blossoms and the vase are highly valuable, but more important is the symbolic meaning of this gift: wealth and moral character — both indispensable in equal measure.
