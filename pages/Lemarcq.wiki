{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Lemarcq:''' Boss, I think we need to play it safe from now on...
:{{DIcon}} How have you been?
::'''Lemarcq:''' Hi. Recently... Well, I can't say that everything's going smoothly, just that things are calm.
::'''Lemarcq:''' At least the Boss doesn't have sneaky people with their own agenda around him now. He can safely do whatever he wants.
::'''Lemarcq:''' Of course, seeing that we don't have much Mora at the moment, all the things the Boss wants to do are stuck in the planning stages.
::{{DIcon}} About that device...
::'''Lemarcq:''' You mean the Pneumousia Ray Self-Defense Device?
::'''Lemarcq:''' Well, when I offered to return it to Miss [[Fusilier]], she immediately wanted to chuck it into the sea.
::'''Lemarcq:''' It took some persuading, but she reluctantly agreed to let me use it for the time being. Though she also reiterated that she never wanted to lay eyes on it ever again.
::'''Lemarcq:''' ...In any case, I'm very grateful for Miss Fusilier's kindness.
:{{DIcon}} Bye.
::'''Lemarcq:''' Goodbye. I wish you well.
