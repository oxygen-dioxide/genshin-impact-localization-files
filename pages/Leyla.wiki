'''Leyla''' is an event-exclusive [[NPC]] who appeared in ''[[Iktomi Spiritseeking Scrolls]]''.

==Profile==
Leyla is a "spirit-duffer," a person with no spiritual sensitivity and thereby cannot use any spells from the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]]. Tired of being useless due to his condition, he was persuaded by [[Kokuchuu]] to increase his sensitivity with brute-force clairvoyance, and was given a shard of [[Sanhaj]]'s [[Chain Breaker|bow]] to use as a medium for the spell. Though he succeeded in casting the clairvoyance spell, his spirit got lost and he was unable to return to his body.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Night-Wind Letter}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Vision of Ashen Desolation}}</ref>

With the help of [[Ororon]] and the [[Traveler]], [[Citlali]] retrieved Leyla's spirit and brought him back in a ceremony. He was very grateful and repentant of his previous actions, promising to never put himself in danger like that again. After getting a checkup from [[Matla]], to Leyla's surprise, he was able to see through the illusion spell Citlali cast, which affirmed that the experience had indeed increased his spiritual sensitivity. He resolved to learn as much as he could from Ororon's teaching and become useful to the tribe.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Spirit of Ah K'ulbatil}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Leyla has short brown hair and light violet eyes. He wears light blue clothing typical to his tribe.
