'''Tulaytullah''', the City of Sapphire, was an ancient city-state in the [[Hypostyle Desert]], [[Great Red Sand]], [[Sumeru]]. Like most of the other city-states in the desert, it arose after the fall of [[King Deshret]]'s civilization.

It was located at what is now the [[Garden of Endless Pillars]].

==History==
Thousands of years ago, after King Deshret died and [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] used her power to seal away forbidden knowledge, King Deshret's civilization fell and splintered into many smaller, human-led city-states.<ref name="Key">{{Ref/Weapon|Key of Khaj-Nisut}}</ref><ref name="Xiphos Moon">{{Ref/Weapon|Xiphos' Moonlight}}</ref><ref group="Note">Between various weapon descriptions, including Key of Khaj-Nisut, Xiphos' Moonlight, and Wandering Evenstar, it is suggested that Rukkhadevata's suppression of forbidden knowledge and Deshret's sacrifice occurred thousands of years ago. The Vaguely-Readable Inscriptions unlocked by restoring [[Primal Obelisk]]s corroborate that the city-states' history occurred after Deshret's death. However, the book ''[[The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin (I)]]'' states that the city-states rose and fell after the fall of the original Ay-Khanoum (during which the [[Goddess of Flowers]] died) and before Deshret and Rukkhadevata regathered the people, which would ostensibly place it before Deshret's death.</ref> Among them was Tulaytullah, which was renowned as a city of wisdom and played host to the "wise Tighnarians."<ref name="Xiphos Moon" /><ref>{{Ref/Item|The Shepherd and the Magic Bottle}}</ref> However, nothing is currently known about the Tighnarians aside from their association with Tulaytullah.

An unknown number of years after the fall of the city-state of [[Gurabad]], a man known as Shah Ramshahr built seven towers in seven areas, and the cities around them were known as the Cities of the Seven Towers. Tulaytullah, which was led by King Humayun during that time, was one of the seven cities.<ref name="Underground">Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, [[Primal Obelisk#Mausoleum of King Deshret, East (Underground)|Mausoleum of King Deshret, East (Underground)]]</ref><ref group="Note">Considering that two of the other known Cities of the Seven Towers, Gurabad and Ay-Khanoum, predated Ramshahr, it is likely &mdash; but unconfirmed &mdash; that Tulaytullah already existed before Ramshahr's rise.</ref> After Ramshahr's death, Humayun took Ramshahr's princess as his wife and became known as Humayun {{w|Gürkan|Gurkan}}. Some years later, however, Humayun himself was decapitated at the city of [[Saleh]] during an event known as the Jinn Uprising. Tulaytullah's leadership following Humayun's death is unknown, but the city was stable enough that refugees from Garshāsp's city (after abandoning Gurabad) flocked to Tulaytullah after Garshāsp's death.<ref>Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, [[Primal Obelisk#Mausoleum of King Deshret (Beneath)|Mausoleum of King Deshret (Beneath)]]</ref>

King [[Saleb Dowleh]], originally known as Goudarz, was somehow involved with Tulaytullah before his rise as king, although he later left the city to take up residence in Gurabad. Saleb Dowleh made an alliance with the [[Dharma Forest]] port city of Orghana (now known as [[Port Ormos]]),<ref>Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, [[Primal Obelisk#Mausoleum of King Deshret, East|Mausoleum of King Deshret, East]]</ref> although one of its Deys, [[Muzaffar]], would later turn his back on both sides, killing Saleb Dowleh and his entire bloodline and deciding to permanently reside in the desert instead of returning to Orghana.<ref name="Underground" />

Muzaffar's descendant, Badanah,<ref group="Note">The Vaguely-Readable Inscriptions at Valley of Dahri and Sobek Oasis appear to contradict each other on Badanah's exact relation to Muzaffar. A literal reading of Valley of Dahri's inscription &mdash; which states that Badanah is one of the fifty sons of "Verdant Lord" Zumurud, Muzaffar's son &mdash; makes Badanah Muzaffar's grandson. Sobek Oasis' description says that "[Badanah's] father is most beloved of the Verdant Lord," which indicates that Badanah is not Zumurud's son and leaves Badanah's direct relationship to Muzaffar unclear.</ref> eventually united ninety-nine city-states under his rule, including Tulaytullah.<ref>Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, [[Primal Obelisk#Sobek Oasis|Sobek Oasis]]</ref> [[Faramarz]] and [[Makhaira]], Badanah's son and concubine respectively, successfully enacted a plot to assassinate the king by luring him into a structurally unstable tower, which collapsed while Badanah was hunting with his falcon.<ref name="Makhqua">{{Ref/Weapon|Makhaira Aquamarine}}</ref><ref name="LotL">{{Ref/Arti|Lamp of the Lost}}</ref> In the wake of his death, the tower was dismantled while his hunting falcons were all killed and buried alongside him.<ref name="VRI Khaj">Interactable: Vaguely-Readable Inscription, [[Primal Obelisk#Khaj-Nisut|Khaj-Nisut]]</ref>

===Faramarz's Reigns===
With Badanah dead, Faramarz took the throne. However, due to his relatively young age, Makhaira became queen-regent and gathered their retainers. Faramarz abdicated in favor of his uncle and minister, Balash, who was the master of Tulaytullah, and moved to the Emerald Palace. Later, one of Faramarz's other uncles, Goraz, raised an army to restore Faramarz's reign and succeeded in doing so, killing Balash. While Faramarz became king again, Goraz and Makhaira became co-regents and Goraz eventually took over the throne for himself, taking Makhaira as his queen and exiling Faramarz.<ref name="VRI Khaj" />

The people of Tulaytullah rebelled in the wake of Balash's death. Goraz was killed in the ensuing conflict, and Makhaira gave his head to the rebels to appease them. Faramarz returned once again to the throne, only for the city of Saleh to rebel to gain independence and re-establish their Khaganate. Once again, Makhaira handled the situation. However, this led to many other challengers for the throne, leading to a prolonged war which ravaged the land. While the war eventually came to an end and Faramarz reclaimed the throne for a fourth time, he assassinated Makhaira due to her shifting loyalties. A conspiracy between the slave-warriors and city dwellers led Faramarz to be ousted one final time, after which he was exiled to Dharma Forest.<ref name="LotL" /><ref name="VRI Khaj" /> One of their retainers, who currently has not been named, was blinded and became a commoner.<ref name="Makhqua" />

===Xiphos and the End of Tulaytullah===
Tulaytullah remained prosperous after Faramarz's exile. One prince of a fallen kingdom, [[Xiphos]], was spared from the carnage of war by being disguised as a servant. He retained the [[Key of Khaj-Nisut]] and eventually became an apprentice to the old blind retainer, who realized Xiphos' lineage from his story. The retainer encouraged Xiphos to continue on his journey and return King Deshret's glory to the world.<ref name="Key" />

Wielding [[Xiphos' Moonlight|a certain blade indwelt by a Jinni]], Xiphos became Tulaytullah's protector and resided there for a while. However, he eventually became entangled in battle against another wandering mercenary who fell from the throne, who had accepted commissions from rival city-states that bore grudges against Tulaytullah and Xiphos. The mercenary emerged victorious, Xiphos perished in battle, and Tulaytullah withered without the wandering prince's protection.<ref name="Key" /><ref name="Xiphos Moon" />

===Legacy===
All that remains of Tulaytullah in the present is its garden, which is preserved in the Garden of Endless Pillars.
