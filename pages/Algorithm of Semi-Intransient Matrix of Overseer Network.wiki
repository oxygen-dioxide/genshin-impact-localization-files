{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = Laser Zone
|desc_1      = Marks a large area, within which it fires countless lasers, each dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. After the laser zone dissipates, sweeps forwards with two more lasers that rapidly deal '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} to players touching them. This attack is always used at the beginning of the fight, and will only be used once per fight.

|name_2      = Invisible State
|desc_2      = <ul><!--
--><li>Leaves 2 types of parts on the field and becomes invisible, gaining '''+200%''' All [[RES]]. The parts will attack the player and can be damaged.<ul><!--
--><li>'''Repulsor Parts:''' Chases the player and deals '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on contact.</li><!--
--><li>'''Reshaper Parts:''' Deals '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on landing. When two Repulsor parts are present, an energized beam will form between them, dealing '''20% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} to players that come in contact.</li><!--
--><li>'''Prospector Parts:''' Periodically fires an energy beam at the player, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}.</li><!--
--></ul></li><!--
--><li>Destroying a part will force the Matrix into a recovery state, where it attempts to repair its broken parts and then reveals itself. Hitting the parts using {{Electro}} during this recovery state will immediately end the invisible state and paralyze the Matrix for a period of time. While being repaired, the parts are infused with {{Dendro}}, allowing [[Bloom]] or [[Burning]] to be triggered.</li><!--
--><li>The parts have HP equal to '''10%''' of the Matrix's Max HP. They also slowly lose health and will be destroyed after 60s without taking DMG from an external source.</li><!--
--><li>When destroyed, a part will generate 4 [[Energy]] orbs that restore a total of '''24''' base Energy for the player. This Energy restoration is affected by [[Energy Recharge]].</li><!--
--><li>Directly inflicting a [[Quicken]] reaction on the invisible Matrix will also paralyze it.</li><!--
--><li>In the [[Spiral Abyss]], this ability is highly prioritized.</li><!--
--><li>After becoming invisible, the Matrix will immediately teleport a few meters forward in the direction that it is facing. After some time, it will start to slowly move around and periodically stop near its parts.</li><!--
--></ul>

|file_2_5    = Algorithm of Semi-Intransient Matrix of Overseer Network Invisible State Paralyzed Quicken
|caption_2_5 = Paralyzed by Inflicting Quicken
|strat_2     = It is possible to locate the invisible Matrix using certain abilities that target automatically, such as [[Fischl]]'s [[Nightrider]] and [[Yae Miko]]'s [[Yakan Evocation: Sesshou Sakura]]. Alternatively, one can apply a debuff to the Matrix, and the debuff indicator will remain visible. Locating the invisible Matrix is especially helpful in teams capable of triggering [[Quicken]], as it removes the need to destroy the parts entirely.

|name_3      = Repulse
|desc_3      = Generates a force shield that pushes the player away, dealing '''40% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on hit. This attack is used after recovering from a paralyzed state.

|name_4      = Reshape
|desc_4      = Fires a bolt that strikes down at the player's location and drills into the ground, dealing '''50% ATK''', '''70% ATK''' as as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. This attack is used after recovering from a paralyzed state.

|name_5      = Prospect
|desc_5      = Fires out a large energy beam at the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. This attack is used after recovering from a paralyzed state.

|name_6      = Tracking Laser
|desc_6      = Locks onto the player and fires a large tracking laser beam at the player, dealing '''70% ATK''' as as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. This attack is used if the player destroys a part but fails to hit it with Electro during the recovery state.

|name_7      = Laser Barrage
|desc_7      = Fires many lasers at the ground in front of it, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. This attack is used if the player destroys a part but fails to hit it with Electro during the recovery state.

|name_8      = Missile Blast
|desc_8      = Fires a large missile at the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. This attack is used if the player destroys a part but fails to hit it with Electro during the recovery state.

|name_9      = Overclocked Attack
|desc_9      = If the Matrix stays in its invisible state for too long, gathers all of its parts and draws energy before releasing a large shockwave that expands outwards covering the entire arena, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}, then becomes paralyzed for a period of time. Hitting the parts using {{Electro}} while this attack is charging immediately paralyze the Matrix. While this attack is charging, the parts are infused with {{Dendro}}, allowing [[Bloom]] or [[Burning]] to be triggered.

==Trivia==
* The Algorithm appears as a stage boss in the following quests:
** During the {{Quest|Dual Evidence}}, one appears with the name "Field Annihilation Array" and the epithet "The Evincing Shadow."
** During the {{Quest|The Temple Where Sand Flows Like Tears}}, one appears with the name "Anoushbord" and the epithet "Forgotten Mechanical Guardian." Anoushbord or "Castle of Oblivion" was the name of the Sasanian political prison in what is now Khuzestan, Iran.
* The Algorithm is the first boss to appear as a generic enemy during the {{Quest|Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part III}}, since the main enemy is [[Ferigees, Guardian of the Eternal Oasis]], who herself has her own title and health bar.
* Similarly to most other [[automatons|automaton]] bosses, the Algorithm drops elemental gems not related to its natural affinity.
* Players often abbreviate this boss's long name in English and other languages as ASIMON. This abbreviation was added in-game during [[Version 4.0]] with the Spanish localization of the achievement ''[[Ever So Slightly Inferior]]'', ''¿ASIMON?'' This is not a translation of the original Chinese name of the achievement, and it is the only place the abbreviation shows up in official media.
