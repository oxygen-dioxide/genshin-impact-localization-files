{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = Laser Zone
|desc_1      = Marks a large area, within which it fires countless lasers, each dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. This attack is always used at the beginning of the fight, and will only be used once per fight.

|name_2      = Invisible State
|desc_2      = <ul>
<li>Leaves 2 types of parts on the field and becomes invisible, gaining '''+200%''' All [[RES]]. The parts will attack the player and can be damaged.<ul>
<li>'''Repulsor Parts:''' Chases the player and deals '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on contact.</li>
<li>'''Reshaper Parts:''' Deals '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}} on landing. When two Repulsor parts are present, an energized beam will form between them, dealing '''20% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} to players that come in contact.</li>
<li>'''Prospector Parts:''' Periodically fires an energy beam at the player, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Destroying a part will force the Matrix into a recovery state, where it attempts to repair its broken parts and then reveals itself. Hitting the parts using {{Electro}} during this recovery state will immediately end the invisible state and paralyze the Matrix for a period of time. While being repaired, the parts are infused with {{Dendro}}, allowing [[Bloom]] or [[Burning]] to be triggered.</li>
<li>The parts have HP equal to '''10%''' of the Matrix's Max HP. They also slowly lose health and will be destroyed after 60s without taking DMG from an external source.</li>
<li>When destroyed, a part will generate 4 [[Energy]] orbs that restore a total of '''24''' base Energy for the player. This Energy restoration is affected by [[Energy Recharge]].</li>
<li>Directly inflicting a [[Quicken]] reaction on the invisible Matrix will also paralyze it.</li>
<li>In the [[Spiral Abyss]], this ability is highly prioritized.</li>
<li>After becoming invisible, the Matrix will immediately teleport a few meters forward in the direction that it is facing. After some time, it will start to slowly move around and periodically stop near its parts.</li>
</ul>

|file_2_5    = Algorithm of Semi-Intransient Matrix of Overseer Network Invisible State Paralyzed Quicken
|caption_2_5 = Paralyzed by Inflicting Quicken
|strat_2     = It is possible to locate the invisible Matrix using certain abilities that target automatically, such as [[Fischl]]'s [[Nightrider]] and [[Yae Miko]]'s [[Yakan Evocation: Sesshou Sakura]]. Alternatively, one can apply a debuff to the Matrix, and the debuff indicator will remain visible. Locating the invisible Matrix is especially helpful in teams capable of triggering [[Quicken]], as it removes the need to destroy the parts entirely.

|name_3      = Repulse
|desc_3      = Generates a force shield that pushes the player away, dealing '''40% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on hit. This attack is used after recovering from a paralyzed state.

|name_4      = Reshape
|desc_4      = Fires a bolt that strikes down at the player's location and drills into the ground, dealing '''50% ATK''', '''70% ATK''' as as {{Color|AoE Physical DMG}}. This attack is used after recovering from a paralyzed state.

|name_5      = Prospect
|desc_5      = Fires out a large energy beam at the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. This attack is used after recovering from a paralyzed state.

|name_6      = Tracking Laser
|desc_6      = Locks onto the player and fires a large tracking laser beam at the player, dealing '''70% ATK''' as as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. This attack is used if the player destroys a part but fails to hit it with Electro during the recovery state.

|name_7      = Laser Barrage
|desc_7      = Fires many lasers at the ground in front of it, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. This attack is used if the player destroys a part but fails to hit it with Electro during the recovery state.

|name_8      = Missile Blast
|desc_8      = Fires a large missile at the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. This attack is used if the player destroys a part but fails to hit it with Electro during the recovery state.

|name_9      = Overclocked Attack
|desc_9      = If the Matrix stays in its invisible state for too long, gathers all of its parts and draws energy before releasing a large shockwave that expands outwards covering the entire arena, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}, then becomes paralyzed for a period of time. Hitting the parts using {{Electro}} while this attack is charging immediately paralyze the Matrix. While this attack is charging, the parts are infused with {{Dendro}}, allowing [[Bloom]] or [[Burning]] to be triggered.

{{Description|A perpetual motion machine that rules over the many constructs scattered throughout the desert. It seems that the lonely ruler's will still indwells this device.<br />Perhaps due to a friend's teachings in a dream or perhaps because he coveted the power of the holy ones in the skies, the king created mysterious devices that should not exist in this world before founding his realm in these lands.<br />Amidst the ruins of the city of a thousand pillars, the ancient crystals still reflect the glory of the golden paradise, though none now live who remember the king's dreams.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
*The Overseer is the first boss to appear as a generic enemy during the [[World Quest]] [[Dune-Entombed Fecundity: Part III]], since the main enemy is [[Ferigees, Guardian of the Eternal Oasis]], who herself has her own title and health bar.
