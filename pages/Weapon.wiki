'''Weapons''' in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' are equipment that assists the player in fighting to deal more damage. It is the first tab in the [[Inventory]].

There are currently five different types of weapons in ''Genshin Impact''. Each [[character]] is only able to wield one weapon type. Visit each weapon type's page ([[Bows]], [[Catalysts]], [[Claymores]], [[Polearms]], or [[Swords]]) for a list of all weapons of the respective type. See [[Weapon/List]] for a list of all weapons.

Weapon level can be increased with [[Weapon EXP]], which is generated by other weapons or [[Weapon Enhancement Materials]].

==Weapon Types==
{| class="article-table sortable"
!Icon!!Type!!class="unsortable"|Info
|-
|[[File:Icon Sword.png|64px|link=Swords]]
|[[Swords]]
|Sword attacks are the middle ground of melee weapons. The damage and speed of their attacks are comparable to those of Polearms, though with a shorter reach.
|-
|[[File:Icon Claymore.png|64px|link=Claymores]]
|[[Claymores]]
|Claymores attacks hit slower than melee weapons like [[Swords]] and [[Polearms]], but deal much more damage per swing. Due to being considered [[Blunt Attack]]s, Claymore attacks deal increased damage to [[Geo]] objects, such as monsters' shields.
|-
|[[File:Icon Polearm.png|64px|link=Polearms]]
|[[Polearms]]
|Polearms have fast attacks, long forward reach, and deal moderate damage per hit.
|-
|[[File:Icon Catalyst.png|64px|link=Catalysts]]
|[[Catalysts]]
|Due to their magical nature, all Normal and Charged Attacks performed with a Catalyst are considered elemental damage. The element of the damage depends on the wielder's natural element/vision.
|-
|[[File:Icon Bow.png|64px|link=Bows]]
|[[Bows]]
|Bows boast long-ranged attacks, with Charged Attacks that are capable of hitting monsters as far as the eye can see with the proper aim. A fully-Charged Attack deals elemental damage.
|}

==Rarity==
All weapons have a rarity ranging from 1-star to 5-stars. Weapons with higher rarity/stars have higher scaling on their stats than weapons of lesser rarity but are more difficult to obtain, and also require more [[Weapon EXP]] to level up.
* Example: Even if [[Debate Club]] (3* Claymore) and [[Wolf's Gravestone]] (5* Claymore) are both Lv.20, the Debate Club will have only 87 Base ATK and an additional 9.8% Base ATK as a 2nd stat, while the Wolf's Gravestone will have 160 Base ATK and an additional 15.1% Base ATK as a 2nd stat.

==Progression==
===Leveling===
{{Main|Weapon EXP}}
Like Characters, weapons can gain experience and increase their level by consuming other weapons or [[Weapon Enhancement Materials]].

===Ascensions===
Like Characters, weapons can be ascended to their next Phase once they reach their current max level up to 6 times (Lv.90). Weapon ascension requires [[Weapon Ascension Materials]].

A weapon's appearance will change permanently upon reaching 2nd Ascension.

==Stats==
===Secondary Stat===
Weapons that have a rarity of 3-stars or higher have a secondary stat that provides the wielder with a bonus that scales with the weapon's level, just like its Base ATK. One of the following secondary stats can be given, depending on the weapon:
*[[:Category:ATK Substat Weapons|ATK Weapons]]
*[[:Category:DEF Substat Weapons|DEF Weapons]]
*[[:Category:HP Substat Weapons|HP Weapons]]
*[[:Category:CRIT DMG Substat Weapons|CRIT DMG Weapons]]
*[[:Category:CRIT Rate Substat Weapons|CRIT Rate Weapons]]
*[[:Category:Elemental Mastery Substat Weapons|Elemental Mastery Weapons]]
*[[:Category:Energy Recharge Substat Weapons|Energy Recharge Weapons]]
*[[:Category:Physical DMG Bonus Substat Weapons|Physical DMG Bonus Weapons]]

===Base Attack Scaling===
{{Main|Weapons/Base Attack Scaling}}

===Secondary Stat Scaling===
{{Main|Weapons/Secondary Stat Scaling}}

==Passive==
Weapons that have a rarity of 3-stars or higher have a passive along with their secondary stat. These passives can range from something simple - buffs like [[Raven Bow]]'s "Bane of Flame and Water" passive that gives an increase in damage dealt to enemies affected by Hydro or Pyro - to something more complex like [[The Widsith]]'s "Debut" passive which provides one of 3 random buffs when you switch to the character that has it equipped.

===Refining===
Weapons' passive effect can be increased by refining. It will be increased with every rank, up to a maximum of rank 5. Every weapon that has a passive effect can be refined by consuming an identical weapon.

If you have two copies of a refinement rank 2 weapon and refine them together, you will end up with a refinement rank 4 weapon. This holds true for all refinement ranks. However, you cannot exceed refinement rank 5 by doing this. Please note that your enhancement materials will '''not''' be refunded by doing this, if any were used.

Refining [[Event-Only Weapons]] (as well as {{Item|"The Catch"|30|type=Weapon}} and {{Item|End of the Line|30|type=Weapon}}) will require specific refining material which is only available during the event. (Example: The refinement material for [[Dodoco Tales]] was in the [[Midsummer Island Adventure]] event shop. Buying all available 4 refinement materials from the shop allows the player to refine their Dodoco Tales to refinement 5.)

==Trivia==
* Besides the 5 playable weapon classes, there are numerous classes of weapons used solely by NPCs and enemies, ranging from axes and daggers, to crossbows and firearms.
*[[Event-Only Weapons]] have been given with [[Refinement Materials]] to reach Refinement Rank 5 in every other [[Version Event]]<!--With one patch update gap in between-->. Only one copy of each weapon can be obtained.<!--
