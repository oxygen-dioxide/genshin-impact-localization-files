'''Weapons''' in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' are equipment that assists the player in fighting to deal more damage. It is the first tab in the [[Inventory]].

There are currently five different types of weapons in ''Genshin Impact''. Each [[character]] is only able to wield one weapon type. Visit each weapon type's page ([[Bows]], [[Catalysts]], [[Claymores]], [[Polearms]], or [[Swords]]) for a list of all weapons of the respective type. See [[Weapon/List]] for a list of all weapons.

Weapon level can be increased with [[Weapon EXP]], which is generated by other weapons or [[Weapon Enhancement Materials]].

==Weapon Types==
{| class="article-table sortable"
!Icon!!Type!!class="unsortable"|Info
|-
|[[File:Icon Sword.png|64px|link=Swords]]
|[[Swords]]
|Sword attacks are the middle ground of melee weapons. The damage and speed of their attacks are comparable to those of Polearms, though with a shorter reach.
|-
|[[File:Icon Claymore.png|64px|link=Claymores]]
|[[Claymores]]
|Claymores attacks hit slower than melee weapons like [[Swords]] and [[Polearms]], but deal much more damage per swing. Due to being considered [[Blunt Attack]]s, Claymore attacks deal increased damage to [[Geo]] objects, such as monsters' shields.
|-
|[[File:Icon Polearm.png|64px|link=Polearms]]
|[[Polearms]]
|Polearms have fast attacks, long forward reach, and deal moderate damage per hit.
|-
|[[File:Icon Catalyst.png|64px|link=Catalysts]]
|[[Catalysts]]
|Due to their magical nature, all [[Normal Attack|Normal]] and [[Charged Attack]]s performed with a Catalyst are considered [[element]]al damage. The element of the damage depends on the wielder's natural element/vision.
|-
|[[File:Icon Bow.png|64px|link=Bows]]
|[[Bows]]
|Bows boast long-ranged attacks, with Charged Attacks that are capable of hitting monsters as far as the eye can see with proper aim. A fully-Charged Attack deals elemental damage.
|}

==Quality==
All weapons have a quality ranging from 1-star to 5-stars. Weapons with higher quality/stars have higher scaling on their attributes than weapons of lesser quality but are more difficult to obtain, and also require more [[Weapon EXP]] to level up.
* Example: Even if [[Debate Club]] (3* Claymore) and [[Wolf's Gravestone]] (5* Claymore) are both Lv.20, the Debate Club will have only 87 Base ATK and an additional 9.8% Base ATK as a Secondary Attribute, while the Wolf's Gravestone will have 160 Base ATK and an additional 15.1% Base ATK as a Secondary Attribute.

==Progression==
===Leveling===
{{Main|Weapon EXP}}
Like Characters, weapons can gain experience and increase their level by consuming other weapons or [[Weapon Enhancement Materials]].

===Ascensions===
Like Characters, weapons can be ascended to their next Phase once they reach their current max level up to 6 times (Lv.90). Weapon ascension requires [[Weapon Ascension Materials]].

A weapon's appearance will change permanently upon reaching 2nd Ascension.

==Attributes==
===Secondary Attribute===
Weapons of 3-star quality or higher have a Secondary Attribute that provides the wielder with a bonus that scales with the weapon's level, just like its Base ATK. One of the following attributes can be given, depending on the weapon:
* [[ATK#Secondary Attribute|ATK Weapons]]
* [[DEF#Secondary Attribute|DEF Weapons]]
* [[HP#Secondary Attribute|HP Weapons]]
* [[CRIT DMG#Secondary Attribute|CRIT DMG Weapons]]
* [[CRIT Rate#Secondary Attribute|CRIT Rate Weapons]]
* [[Elemental Mastery#Secondary Attribute|Elemental Mastery Weapons]]
* [[Energy Recharge#Secondary Attribute|Energy Recharge Weapons]]
* [[Physical DMG#Secondary Attribute|Physical DMG Bonus Weapons]]

===Base Attack Scaling===
{{Main|Weapon/Base Attack Scaling}}

===Secondary Attribute Scaling===
{{Main|Weapon/Secondary Attribute Scaling}}

==Passive==
Weapons of 3-star quality or higher have a passive along with their Secondary Attribute. These passives can range from something simple - buffs like [[Raven Bow]]'s "Bane of Flame and Water" passive that gives an increase in damage dealt to enemies affected by Hydro or Pyro - to something more complex like [[The Widsith]]'s "Debut" passive which provides one of 3 random buffs when you switch to the character that has it equipped.

===Refining===
Weapons' passive effect can be increased by refining. It will be increased with every rank, up to a maximum of rank 5. Every weapon that has a passive effect can be refined by consuming an identical weapon.

If you have two copies of a refinement rank 2 weapon and refine them together, you will end up with a refinement rank 4 weapon. This holds true for all refinement ranks. However, you cannot exceed refinement rank 5 by doing this. Please note that your enhancement materials will '''not''' be refunded by doing this, if any were used.

Refining [[Flagship Event-Exclusive Weapons]] and [[Fishing Association-Exclusive Weapons]] will require specific refining material which is only available during the event. (Example: The refinement material for [[Dodoco Tales]] was in the [[Midsummer Island Adventure]] event shop. Buying all available 4 refinement materials from the shop allows the player to refine their Dodoco Tales to refinement 5.)

==Trivia==
* Besides the 5 playable weapon classes, there are numerous other classes of weapons used solely by enemies or by playable characters as part of certain [[Talent]]s.
* [[Flagship Event-Exclusive Weapons]] have been given with [[Refinement Material]]s to reach Refinement Rank 5 in every other [[Version Event]]<!--With one patch update gap in between-->. Only one copy of each weapon can be obtained.<!--

* A number of other weapons are only available in limited quantities.
** {{Item|Traveler's Handy Sword|30|type=Weapon}}, {{Item|Fillet Blade|30|type=Weapon}}, {{Item|White Iron Greatsword|30|type=Weapon}}, {{Item|Skyrider Greatsword|30|type=Weapon}}, {{Item|White Tassel|30|type=Weapon}}, {{Item|Halberd|30|type=Weapon}}, {{Item|Otherworldly Story|30|type=Weapon}}, {{Item|Twin Nephrite|30|type=Weapon}}, {{Item|Recurve Bow|30|type=Weapon}}, and {{Item|Messenger|30|type=Weapon}} are only available through exploration, quests, and dialogue branches.
** Only two copies of {{Item|Dark Iron Sword|30|type=Weapon}} can be obtained.
*** One copy can be obtained by following [[Chen the Sharp]]'s dialogue branch for the first time.
*** Another copy can be obtained by opening a specific chest in [[Wangshan Hall]] in [[Chenyu Vale: Upper Vale]].
** Weapons from the [[Outlander Series]] can be obtained through [[Mail]] once.
** A single copy of {{Item|"The Catch"|30|type=Weapon}}, along with Refinement Materials to reach Refinement Rank 5, can be purchased from the [[Inazuma Fishing Association]].
** A single copy of {{Item|Kagotsurube Isshin|30|type=Weapon}} can be obtained after completing {{Quest|A Strange and Friendless Road}}.
** A single copy of {{Item|End of the Line|30|type=Weapon}}, along with Refinement Materials to reach Refinement Rank 5, can be purchased from the [[Sumeru Fishing Association]].
** A single copy of {{Item|Fleuve Cendre Ferryman|30|type=Weapon}}, along with Refinement Materials to reach Refinement Rank 5, can be purchased from the [[Fontaine Fishing Association]].
** A single copy of {{Item|Sword of Narzissenkreuz|30|type=Weapon}} can be obtained from the World Quest series ''[[In the Wake of Narcissus]]''. Its Refinement Materials are obtained from [[Fontaine]] exploration.
* There are some weapons that are exclusive to quests.
** {{Item|Prized Isshin Blade (Awakened)|30|type=Weapon}} and {{Item|Prized Isshin Blade (Shattered)|30|type=Weapon}} appear during {{Quest|A Strange and Friendless Road}}.
** {{Item|Sword of Narzissenkreuz (Quest)|name=Sword of Narzissenkreuz|30|type=Weapon}} appears during {{Quest|In the Wake of Narcissus}}.
* Fontainian weapons emit Pneuma or Ousia when equipped by a character who has [[Arkhe]].
* Many talents, but not all, will summon the character's weapon in their hands, or by their side in the case of Catalysts. Light attacks while the character is idle may also cause the character to arm themselves with their weapon and take a combative stance. When a character has idled in combat stance long enough, they will put away their weapon, which will reappear behind their back for some more time before disappearing fully. If the weapon has already been put away as part of a character's Talent animations, it will reappear behind their back as soon as the character's attack animations end.
** After putting their weapon away, a large majority of characters have it appear behind the center of their back, vertically or at a slight angle. Notable exceptions include [[Kamisato Ayaka]], [[Kirara]], [[Furina]] and [[Chiori]], whose Swords appear at a near-horizontal angle, and [[Wriothesley]], whose Catalyst appears significantly offset behind his right shoulder, behind almost entirely visible when seeing the character from the front.
