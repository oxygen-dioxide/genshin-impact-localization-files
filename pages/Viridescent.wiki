'''Viridescent''', also known as the '''Viridescent Venerer''' and the '''Queen of Hunters''', was a figure who lived five hundred years ago during the [[cataclysm]].<ref name="VV">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Viridescent Venerer}}</ref><ref name="VH">{{Ref/Weapon|The Viridescent Hunt}}</ref> She was the original wielder of [[The Viridescent Hunt]].

==Profile==
Viridescent, the Queen of Hunters, was among notable figures who fought during the cataclysm that resulted from the fall of [[Khaenri'ah]]. She was brought into the conflict after rescuing a blind, dying boy from a monster. Taking up his last request to enact revenge on the monsters in his place, she abandoned her former way of life and became a feared monster hunter.<ref name="VV" />

==Story==
Viridescent was orphaned at a young age and was raised in the woods by an unnamed Master who taught her how to live with nature and how to hunt. She killed solely for the sake of survival and believed that at the end of her life, as long as she abided by the natural order, she would one day arrive at an endless viridescent plain.<ref name="VH" />

However, Viridescent's way of life was interrupted by the cataclysm. The [[God of the Woods]] died during the disaster that befell Khaenri'ah, causing the grass and the trees to "never speak again," while monsters began to overrun [[Teyvat]]. A blind, dying boy escaped into the woods where she lived, and she came across him while tracking his trail of blood. She slew the monster attacking him and, after hearing his request, embarked on the path of vengeance against the monsters and the suffering they caused.

Having departed from the hunter's rule of killing only for the sake of survival and not for mortal reasons such as justice or revenge, Viridescent believed she would no longer be able to enter the endless plain at the end of her life. However, she remained undeterred and continued her path of vengeance, though she left behind her original bow, The Viridescent Hunt, so it would not be tainted by her quest.<ref name="VH" />

After having lived away from human society for so long, Viridescent no longer knew how to speak human language. Even after rejoining human society, none of her companions ever heard her speak. She became known as the Viridescent Venerer, feared by monsters all over.

It is presumed that, as a mortal, she died sometime between the cataclysm and the present. However, no details on her life after the cataclysm are known.
