The '''Mare Jivari''' is a location<!--deliberately not capitalized since it's unclear whether it's a domain or a Domain--><ref group="Note">There is much ambiguity as to the nature of Mare Jivari. In {{Quest|Adventurer's Entrance Exam}}, Cyrus calls the Mare Jivari a ''domain'' twice in English, while in Chinese, Cyrus says {{zh|秘境|tl=unexplored region; mysterious realm}} instead. However, {{wt|秘境}} is a free-standing term in modern Chinese; while ''Domains'' are usually translated as such in this game, it does not necessarily imply that Mare Jivari is a "Domain".</ref> in the westernmost area of [[Natlan]].<ref name="VoAD">{{Ref/Quest|Vision of Ashen Desolation}}</ref> It is an empty place,<ref>{{Ref/VO|Nahida|About Nahida: Knowledge}}</ref> described as a "sea of ashes where the wind does not blow,"<ref name="stan">{{Ref/Quest|The South Wind Brings Adventure}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Loading|Others|Mare Jivari}}</ref> and it contains a sea of fire.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Lavawalker's Resolution}}</ref> It vanished off the face of [[Teyvat]] twenty to thirty years prior to the game's events.<ref name="VoAD"/>

==Overview==
Around a thousand years ago, the [[Wanderer's Troupe (Faction)|Wanderer's Troupe]] set foot there while "performing" for their foes,<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Wanderer's String-Kettle}}</ref> though at this time it had not yet become a desolate wasteland.

[[Cataclysm|Five hundred years ago]],<ref>{{Ref/Quest|page=Echoes of Life|quote='''Mavuika:''' "Ah, that weapon belonged to Tenoch, a hero from five hundred years ago. Strictly speaking, he didn't belong to any single tribe."}}</ref> [[Tenoch]] and his six allies from [[Natlan Tribes|Natlan's major tribes]] went to war against a "[[Abyss|turbid black tide]]." According to legend, [[Sanhaj]], a renowned Border Master from the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]], summoned a miniature [[Night Kingdom]] and used it to destroy the encroaching calamity.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Night-Wind Letter}}</ref> The massive battle would result in the land turning into a wasteland, with the ashes of monsters and warriors alike covering the entire battlefield. It is said that bone-chilling cries could be heard from its depths, and at other times, the region would be engulfed in towering flames that drowned them out.<ref name="VoAD"/>

According to legend, a phoenix dwells within the Mare Jivari, which was worshipped by people as a totem, while kings saw it as a sign of nobility.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Lavawalker's Salvation}}</ref>

At an unknown point in time, a sage known as the [[Lavawalker]] created a circlet that could withstand the sea of fire within the Mare Jivari. Envious and fearful, his teacher and peers decried this as blasphemy, and ordered him to walk into the Mare Jivari while wearing it. He did so &mdash; and survived. He continued wandering in and out of the Mare Jivari for another one hundred years, until the sea of flames finally burned him to ash during his final journey.<ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Lavawalker}}</ref>

Around twenty to thirty years prior to the events of the game, people who visited the Mare Jivari began to claim that an enormous, dark creature the size of a mountain began roaming the Mare Jivari. Shortly after the monster's arrival, the whole region simply "disappeared." There has been a growing settlement in the place it used to be since its disappearance.<ref name="VoAD" />

Despite the dangers of the land, many adventurers enter the Mare Jivari to prove themselves, but many fell to the dangers within. Some time the game's events, a famous [[Mondstadt]] adventurer named [[Stanley (Historical)|Stanley]] traversed the Mare Jivari. However, he perished while saving a greenhorn adventurer named [[Hans Archibald]] from an evil beast. Afterwards, Hans took on the name "Stanley" and went on to recount the real Stanley's tales as though they were his own, to keep the man's memory alive.<ref name="stan" />

The [[Abyss Lector: Fathomless Flames|Abyss Lector]] [[Enjou]] is looking into the history behind the Mare Jivari. According to [[Kinich]], it is hard to access the Mare Jivari, and he has yet to take a commission regarding it.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Last Turnfire Night}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* [[Bennett]] makes a reference to Mare Jivari in his love poem for the [[Windblume Festival]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Realm of Fog and Wind|quote='''Venti:''' "You and the Mare Jivari / So close and yet so far / One at the edge of the world / The other in the center of my heart / Wolfhook and dandelion / My Windblume offering to you."}}</ref>
===Etymology===
* While the word "Mare" is Latin, meaning "sea," the etymology of "Jivari" is not clear.
**The word may be derived from the musical term {{w|Jivari}}, which means the overtone-rich "buzzing" sound characteristic of classical Indian string instruments.
** It may also be inspired by the {{w|Javary River|Rio Javari}}, a tributary of the Amazon River that flows along the boundary of Brazil and Peru. Javari means "Jaguar's River" in the {{W|Tupi people|Tupi-Guaraní}} language.
* The Chinese, Japanese, and Korean names for Mare Jivari translate to "Silent Sea of Ashes." This name is kept in other localizations through the [[Loading Screen/Others#Mare Jivari|Loading Screen]]'s description of Mare Jivari.
** In CBT1, the English localization translated Mare Jivari as the "Ashen Sea."<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/HA_XuipwXNs?t=14713 CBT Special Episode 2]</ref>
