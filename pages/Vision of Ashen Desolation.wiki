{{Quest Description|In order to help Leyla find his spirit, Citlali plans to get more info from within the tribe, but how successful was she...?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Ororon)
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Hey, everyone.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Ah, Granny. You're back.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' So... no good news for me, then?
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 olorun 02.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' You saw right through me. {{Traveler}} collected a lot of spirits, and I checked all of them one by one. None of them matches Leyla's description.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I figured. It was written all over your face. It's alright, I didn't exactly have high hopes for the needle-in-a-haystack approach anyway.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 olorun 03.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Leyla's condition is still stable, but we're not really getting anywhere.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 04.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Well, luckily I made some progress on my end. Leyla's parents told me that he made a new friend recently, and apparently, he's been out of the house for days at a time.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 05.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' On one occasion, they secretly followed him, and saw him and his friend tinkering around with something at a camp.
:{{DIcon}} They saw his friend?
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 06.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Yeah, some guy who goes by the name "[[Enjou|Kokuchuu]]." Dressed in what looked like [[Inazuma]]n attire.
;(A flashback begins)
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 leyla 01.ogg}} '''Leyla:''' Is this really all I'll need, Mr. Kokuchuu?
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 fuchikami 01.ogg}} '''Kokuchuu:''' Based on my studies of the ancient texts, hypersensitivity is usually treated with desensitization therapy. So, I figure there's no reason it shouldn't work in reverse.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 fuchikami 02.ogg}} '''Kokuchuu:''' Now, for a poor chap like yourself, with no sensitivity to spirits whatsoever, you'll have to completely immerse yourself in spiritually rich substances for this to be effective. I'm electing to name this approach "hypersensitization therapy"...
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 leyla 02.ogg}} '''Leyla:''' ...Is it risky?
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 fuchikami 03.ogg}} '''Kokuchuu:''' You're the spirit-duffer, not me. I'm sure you're more clued up than I am on the potential consequences of brute-force clairvoyance. Ultimately, it's your decision.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 leyla 03.ogg}} '''Leyla:''' Alright... But I do have one last question... What's in this for you?
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 leyla 04.ogg}} '''Leyla:''' People like me obviously don't have much clout in this tribe, so it's not like I can offer you much in return.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 fuchikami 04.ogg}} '''Kokuchuu:''' You think I'm looking for a reward? Oh, my good sir! Take a look at my face. Isn't the answer written here, clear as day?
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 leyla 05.ogg}} '''Leyla:''' Uh... What? What's written there...?
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 fuchikami 05.ogg}} '''Kokuchuu:''' "Just a friendly guy who's happy to help."
;(Flashback ends)
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? So... some random guy from Inazuma just felt like helping Leyla cure his... spirit-duffer... ness?
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 olorun 04.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Hypersensitization therapy, huh... What a novel idea. Could that really work?
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Not on Leyla, by the looks of things.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 07.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Hmph, it's anything but novel. Our tribe used to offer it as a treatment once upon a time, but it was so fraught with risks and had such an abysmal success rate that it was eventually outlawed.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 08.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' As for this Kokuchuu fellow... I'm sure he has his own agenda. He conveniently disappeared right after Leyla got into this mess.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 09.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Leyla's parents gave me the address of the camp, so I went and checked it out. There were clear traces of spiritual energy, and also... look what I found.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 olorun 05.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' What's this?
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 10.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' A broken shard... probably from a weapon or some sort of ceremonial implement.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 11.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' You feel that? It might look old, but it has extremely strong traces of spiritual energy.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 12.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Leyla must have used this as his medium. It would definitely explain how a spirit-duffer like him was able to trigger a clairvoyant experience.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 olorun 06.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Wait, there's something else... It feels so familiar... I think this is somehow connected to my [[Ancient Name|ancient name]]...
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Connected how? Is it, like, a shard of an ancient name?
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 olorun 07.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' No... More like, I think this item might have belonged to a previous bearer of my ancient name.
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps it was [[Sanhaj]]?
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 13.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Okay, that's it, Granny's getting itchy clairvoyance fingers. I'm going to try using this shard as a medium.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cool, same as last time? {{Traveler}} can use the spiritloom to record what you find on a woven scroll.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 14.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Nope, Ororon can do the recording this time.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 olorun 08.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Why?
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 15.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' It's a safety measure.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 16.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' You have a better understanding of the spirit domain than {{Traveler}}. If this really is a Sanhaj relic, you'll be better placed to deal with the fallout in the event that something goes wrong.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 olorun 09a.ogg}} {{A|vo tleq002 1 olorun 09b.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Ah... See, Paimon? Told you Granny has a soft spot for {{Traveler}}. Look at her not wanting to put {{MC|m=him|f=her}} in danger.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 olorun 10.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Meanwhile, I'm just a grandkid, so I'm expendable.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 17.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Hey! What are you blabbing on about?
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 olorun 11.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Sorry, Granny. I'm ready now.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 18.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Then let us begin.
:{{Black Screen|Citlali starts her second clairvoyance session with the mysterious shard as her medium.}}
:{{Black Screen|Ororon follows her lead, using the spiritloom to record the images she sees on a woven scroll.}}
:{{Black Screen|Soon, an image appears.}}

:{{A|vo tleq002 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright! What's on the scroll this time... Looks like a broken bow, covered in flames...
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 olorun 12.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Hey, don't you think one of the pieces looks just like this shard?
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're right! It seems to be from the body of the bow...
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 olorun 13.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' I saw a bow just like this in one of Granny's scrolls...
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 19.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' ...Yes, it's the weapon Sanhaj used in the [[Battle of the Mare Jivari]]. I guess that proves it &mdash; this shard is a bona fide Sanhaj relic.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 olorun 14.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Good old Sanhaj... The relic's spiritual energy was fluctuating very strongly, but I wasn't in any danger at all. {{Traveler}} probably would have been fine as well.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Now that's a true hero, huh? Generations later, and the stuff he used to own is helping to treat spirit-duffers.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 20.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I still think there's more to this story, though. Kokuchuu must have had his own motives beyond just treating Leyla's condition.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, well... Okay, we saw the full bow just now, right? Maybe he wanted to see it too, so he could track down the other pieces?
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 olorun 15.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' I don't know if he'd have anything to gain by doing that. Even if they're Sanhaj relics, I still doubt he'd have much use for a broken bow.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 21.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Also, why use a spirit-duffer in that case? You're basically setting yourself up for failure.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 leyla 06.ogg}} '''Leyla:''' ...
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Leyla's body is responding!
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 22.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Let me take a look. I can sense a spirit being drawn to the relic...
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 olorun 16.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Looks like Granny's plan is working. Leyla's spirit is being drawn to the bait.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 23.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' In that case, let me try again &mdash; this time using both Leyla's body and the shard as mediums.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 olorun 17.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' You can do it, Granny. I'm ready to go too.
:{{DIcon}} Actually, can I control the spiritloom this time?
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 24.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' You got the itch too, huh?
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Plus Ororon went last time. It's only fair to take it in turns.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 olorun 18.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Fine by me. We know it's safe now, so you shouldn't have any problems.
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 25.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo tleq002 1 citlali 26.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Alright, if you insist, be my guest. Just let me know when you're ready.

;(Talk to Ororon, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog tleq002 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Don't worry, I'm quite sure the shard is safe. There shouldn't be any danger.

;(Talk to Leyla, optional)
:'''Leyla:''' ...

;(Talk to Citlali)
:{{A|vo dialog tleq002 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' You ready?
:{{DIcon|Restoring Fragmented Records}} Let's begin.
::{{A|vo dialog tleq002 citlali 02a 1.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Alright, here goes.
:{{DIcon}} I need a little more time.
::{{A|vo dialog tleq002 citlali 02b 1.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Alright, I'll wait.<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "*Sigh* sure..."</ref>

Vision of Ashen Desolation Quest Still 2.png

:{{A|vo tleq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Another image has appeared! This one is... a map!
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' A map? Of where?
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Could it be... the [[Mare Jivari]]?
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Mare Jivari!?
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' The Mare Jivari was reduced to a desolate wasteland after [[Cataclysm|that big battle]]. Or rather, it became known as the Mare Jivari after what happened there.
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' The ashes of the monsters and warriors who fought there covered the entire battlefield. Sometimes, bone-chilling cries would be heard from the depths. Other times, the whole region would become engulfed in towering flames, drowning out the cries...
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 citlali 04.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' That place is full of untold dangers and mysteries. Over the centuries, the finest adventurers have tried to prove themselves by venturing in... Sadly, most ended up perishing there.
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 citlali 05.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' That lasted up until around twenty or thirty years ago, when strange things started happening. People started speaking of an enormous, dark creature the size of a mountain roaming inside the Mare Jivari...
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 citlali 06.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' And then, shortly after that, the whole region just completely disappeared. Nobody knows how, but that infamously ominous place just vanished from the face of the world.
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!? How the heck!?
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 citlali 07.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I know, right? Anyway, if I'm not mistaken, the place indicated on this map is where it used to be before it disappeared.
:{{DIcon}} And where is that?
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 citlali 08.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' At the westernmost part of Natlan. It's a very remote location, far away from any of the tribes. There never used to be a settlement there, but there's been more people since the Mare Jivari disappeared.
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 citlali 09.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Anyway, that's just what I've heard. I've never been there myself.
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 citlali 10.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' This is what age does to you. The older you get, the less adventurous you become.
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 olorun 02.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' That's just an excuse. Granny's too lazy to take a trip that far away...
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 citlali 11.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Hold on a second! There's a spirit approaching the shard and the woven scroll!
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 leyla 01.ogg}} '''Leyla:''' ...
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh! Leyla's body is responding again!
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 citlali 12.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Quite a strong reaction this time. Does this mean what he was really seeking was the Mare Jivari's location?
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 olorun 03.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' I sense it too... There's a soul nearby &mdash; almost a complete one.
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eek! This is creeping Paimon out...
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 citlali 13.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Seems like the plan is working.
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, um... can we just wake him up now?
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 citlali 14.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Not today. You might think bringing a spirit back into its body is like pouring water from one bottle into another, but it's far more complicated than that.
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 citlali 15.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' I need to borrow a ceremonial sword, and make some other preparations. It'll take me about two days.
:{{A|vo tleq002 4 citlali 16.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' But don't worry, now that his spirit's returned, there just one step left. Let's meet up again in two days.
:;(Quest completes)

;(Talk to Ororon)
:{{A|vo dialog tleq002 olorun 02.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Something about this still doesn't add up for me... If that Kokuchuu guy was really plotting something, why would he leave Sanhaj's relic at the scene?
:{{A|vo dialog tleq002 olorun 03.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Unless... That was also bait?
