{{Description|Once upon a time, these were knights of the realm and carriers of significant status. The long years and a curse seems to have robbed them of their reason and memory. Now, all that remains within that armor is the will to "fight for something, someone, and some matter."<br>Depending on how much wear and tear they have undergone, they are by turns known as "Shadowy Husks" or "Black Serpent Knights."|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}
'''The Black Serpents''' are an [[Elite Enemy|elite]] enemy group. Members of [[Khaenri'ah]]'s royal guard who once served under their captain, [[Dainsleif]], they have been since affected by the curse and have lost their memories and honor.

Outside of quests and the [[Spiral Abyss]], they are found in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]].

In combat, the Black Serpents are fairly durable enemies that use slow elemental attacks. When one of their attacks is fully absorbed by a player's [[Shield]], they will grant themselves and/or other nearby Black Serpents a buff at the cost of a percentage of their current [[HP]].

==Types==
The Black Serpents, while considered one group in the [[Adventurer Handbook]], have two subclasses: Shadowy Husks and Black Serpent Knights.

;Shadowy Husks
* {{Enemy|Shadowy Husk: Defender}} &mdash; Wields a bow and will create a shield that protects itself from attacks from the front and obtain a stackable [[ATK]] increase upon hitting a shielded player.
* {{Enemy|Shadowy Husk: Line Breaker}} &mdash; Wields a lance and will [[heal]] nearby Black Serpents upon hitting a shielded player.
* {{Enemy|Shadowy Husk: Standard Bearer}} &mdash; Wields a war banner and will create a {{Pyro}} [[shield]] for nearby Black Serpents upon hitting a shielded player.

;Black Serpent Knights
* {{Enemy|Black Serpent Knight: Rockbreaker Ax}} &mdash; Wields dual axes and will enter a rampage state where their damage is converted to {{Geo}} and gain a massive defensive improvement when hitting shielded players. Similarly to [[Fatui Skirmisher - Anemoboxer Vanguard|Fatui Anemoboxers]], they can dart to nearby Shadowy Husks and protect them with a shield.
* {{Enemy|Black Serpent Knight: Windcutter}} &mdash; Wields a greatsword and will obtain an ATK increase and the ability to blink away from the next attack upon hitting a shielded player.

==Lore==
These silent monsters were originally members of [[Khaenri'ah]]'s Royal Guard under their captain [[Dainsleif]] before the nation's fall. Ever since the [[cataclysm]], they have been suffering from their curse, losing most of their humanity in the process. Depending on their level of degradation, they're either referred to as Shadowy Husks or Black Serpent Knights.

At some point in time, a group of Black Serpent Knights led by [[Halfdan]] gathered in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines|the Chasm's mines]]. Although the group was suffering from the curse, they were still able to remember Dainsleif's order to protect the people of Khaenri'ah at all costs. Large groups of [[hilichurl]]s, former civilians of Khaenri'ah, were making their way to the underground depths of the present-day Chasm, somehow aware of a special fountain inside, which was able to remove some of the curse. The group was eventually discovered by the [[Traveler]] and Dainsleif, the former who was investigating hilichurl activity, while the latter had been pursuing an [[Abyss Herald]]. They stumbled upon some hilichurls, before a group of knights attacked them, believing them to be hostiles and were unable to recognize Dainsleif. However, Halfdan recognized him and ordered the knights to retreat, sending them away to various areas in the Chasm.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Grave of the Guarded}}</ref>

At the same time, the [[Abyss Order]], aware of the fountain's properties, attempted to use an amplification device in the hopes that they could restore the consciousness of those affected by the curse, despite being aware that the chances of success were low. The device instead caused pain to the knights and hilichurls, but Halfdan sacrificed his life to stop the device and passed on peacefully.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Black Serpent Knights' Glory}}</ref> The statuses of the remaining knights are not addressed, though in-game, they can be encountered and defeated in the Chasm.

In [[Sumeru]], one of the [[Schwanenritter]], Ynghildr, was presumably lost while fighting [[abyss]]al monsters during the cataclysm. She was corrupted into a Black Serpent Knight and eventually returns to the [[Ruin Golem]] in [[Devantaka Mountain]], guarding a control module of the semi-operational golem. The Traveler encounters her while activating various relays in the golem and defeats her.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Vimana Agama: Jazari's Chapter}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* Most of the names and titles given to the Black Serpent Knights in The Chasm are references to the 1999 film ''{{w|The 13th Warrior}}''.
