{{Description|Once upon a time, these were knights of the realm and carriers of significant status. The long years and a curse seems to have robbed them of their reason and memory. Now, all that remains within that armor is the will to "fight for something, someone, and some matter."<br />Depending on how much wear and tear they have undergone, they are by turns known as "Shadowy Husks" or "Black Serpent Knights."}}
'''The Black Serpents''' are an [[Elite Enemy|elite]] enemy group. They are primarily found in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]].

In combat, the Black Serpents are durable enemies that use slow elemental attacks. When one of their attacks is fully absorbed by a player's [[Shield]] (does not count if the shield breaks as a result of the attack), they will grant themselves and nearby Black Serpents a buff at the cost of a percentage of their current HP.

==Strategy==
Despite being armored monsters, the Black Serpents have low weight and are easy to [[Interruption Resistance|stagger]]. Their attacks have a very slow start-up time, making them very easy to dodge.

The player may want to avoid using [[shield]]s in order to prevent the Black Serpents from obtaining their buffs, although their slow attack speed means that players should not have any difficulty in dodging their attacks and preventing the buffs, even when shielded.

==Lore==
These silent monsters were originally members of [[Khaenri'ah]]'s Royal Guard under their captain [[Dainsleif]] before the nation's fall. Ever since the [[Cataclysm]], they have been suffering from their curse, losing most of their humanity in the process. Depending on how far they've degraded, they're either referred to as Shadowy Husks or Black Serpent Knights. Despite having lost most of their humanity, they continue to fulfill their duties by guarding the [[hilichurls]] (who were once the people of [[Khaenri'ah]]).
