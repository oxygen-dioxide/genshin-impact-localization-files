==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Shevirme:''' More wine and meat free you from worries!
:'''Shevirme:''' Of course, you can't drink too much, or you'll make a fool of yourself.
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Shevirme:''' I own a stall here selling drinks, snacks, and stuff like that.
::'''Shevirme:''' My food is reasonably priced. A popular choice for student meals, welcome parties, and team-building alike!
::'''Shevirme:''' And I even got the Mahamata among my clients, too! One bought a whole case of wine!
::{{DIcon}} Sounds like a heavy drinker.
::'''Shevirme:''' Haha, I actually have no idea what he does, but folks say he's a Mahamata.
::'''Shevirme:''' He was tall and looked like a guy who could hold his drink. But I couldn't tell if he bought the wine for himself or for someone else...
::'''Shevirme:''' I remember him murmuring something like "one case should be enough for an apology" as he carried the wine.
::'''Shevirme:''' ...Say, maybe he wanted to get someone drunk so that they'll forget his mistakes?
:{{DIcon}} Make a fool of myself?
::'''Shevirme:''' That's right. Now, don't tell anyone, but this happened a few days ago. Two groups of researchers were drinking the tavern and they ended up fighting.
::'''Shevirme:''' Y'know, those researchers are usually so reserved and polite, even eating roast meat with small bites. But they can also really go at it, huh?
::'''Shevirme:''' I think it was a fight over who is the best candidate for the [[Grand Conservator]] position. They started arguing, then fists flew. Soon, the matra came and took them all away.
::'''Shevirme:''' Looks like no matter how well-read you are, you still succumb to a few glasses of alcohol, eh?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Shevirme:''' See you around!

==Trivia==
* The Mahamata mentioned in Shevirme's dialogue is likely [[Alhaitham]], who is a member of the Mahamata due to his role as the Scribe. Part of the incessant feuding between Alhaitham and his roommate, [[Kaveh]], is over drinks, which Kaveh cannot afford due to his financial situation; it is also brought up on the [[Puspa Café Message Board#Kaveh and Alhaitham|Puspa Café Message Board]] and the [[Mahamata Bulletin Board#Lambad's Tavern Notice|Mahamata Bulletin Board]].
