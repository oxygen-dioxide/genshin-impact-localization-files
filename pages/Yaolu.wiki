;(Available before unlocking ''[[Springtime Charms/Immortal Combat|Immortal Combat]]'')
:'''Yaolu:''' Sorry! "Immortal Combat" isn't quite ready yet, so please come back later.

;(Available after unlocking ''Immortal Combat'')
:'''Yaolu:''' Hey there! Would you like to try your hand at "Immortal Combat"?
:{{DIcon|Immortal Combat}} Let's do it!
:{{DIcon}} What's "Immortal Combat"?
::'''Yaolu:''' Simply put, this is a game where rattan figures will engage in combat under our command. This is a game with quite the long history on our end.
::'''Yaolu:''' In the past, we would fashion our own little rattan figures, control them, and pit them in combat against one another.
::'''Yaolu:''' Some veteran players could even have them perform real swordplay.
::'''Yaolu:''' But later... Well, everyone found more fun things to play with, so this game fell to the wayside, with the rattan figures becoming purely commemorative items.
::'''Yaolu:''' But when I was little, I loved these little rattan figures. I would pester my family members to play with me, or help me make more figures.
::'''Yaolu:''' The ones my grandma made? Those were fantastic &mdash; she taught me everything I know about making them.
::'''Yaolu:''' Grandpa was skilled in crafts, and he'd use wood to carve all sorts of awesome weapons, arming my rattan figures to the teeth with them.
::'''Yaolu:''' My parents, too, would always find time to play with me no matter how busy they were...
::'''Yaolu:''' And who knows? Perhaps the rattan figures I'd always put on my desk came to the [[Ministry of Civil Affairs]]'s notice eventually...
::'''Yaolu:''' And that might be why they opened up a booth related to the figures... which is, of course, "Immortal Combat."
::'''Yaolu:''' You can be sure that I volunteered myself to take charge of it the moment I heard the news &mdash; and they agreed.
::'''Yaolu:''' So, would you like to give it a try? Trust me, it's great fun! Not to mention how each of them was fashioned by [[Lan Yan]] herself, and she's a real pro!
:{{DIcon}} I don't have time at the moment...
::'''Yaolu:''' Don't worry. Just go ahead and take care of whatever you need to, and come down to the booth whenever you feel like playing.
