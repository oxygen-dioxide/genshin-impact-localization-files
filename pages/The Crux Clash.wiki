'''The Crux Clash''' is a reoccurring martial arts tournament organized by [[Beidou]] of the [[Crux Fleet]] to uncover hidden talents in [[Liyue]].

The tournament is in a single-elimination format. While [[Beidou]] requires participants to be renowned and have no [[Vision]], most of them are generally show-offs who have little to no combat prowess.

During the [[Archon Quest]] [[Autumn Winds, Scarlet Leaves]], the grand prize of the tournament is a Masterless Vision provided by [[Kazuha]]. After speaking with the [[Traveler]] and learning of their desire to go to [[Inazuma]], Beidou changed the grand prize for them to a choice of the Masterless Vision or a ticket to Inazuma aboard the [[Alcor]].
