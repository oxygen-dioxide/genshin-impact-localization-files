The '''Emerald Maple Inn''' is an inn located west of the [[Statue of The Seven]] at the [[Sea of Clouds]], [[Liyue]], and overlooks [[Luhua Pool]]. Due to its relatively remote location, its proprietor, [[Mr. Zhu]], struggles to get patrons.

[[Mona]] used to frequent the inn before she moved into [[Mondstadt]] due to the inn's cheap prices.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Astrology and the 50-Year Pact}}</ref>
