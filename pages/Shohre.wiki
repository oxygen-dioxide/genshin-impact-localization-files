;(Before completing ???)
:'''Shohre:''' Hello, what do you need?
:{{DIcon}} Are you a matra?
::'''Shohre:''' Oh? So you don't exactly know what I do?
::'''Shohre:''' No worries. As a matter of fact, the fewer people who want my help the better, for it means that we have a good academic atmosphere here.
::'''Shohre:''' To be surrounded by books... That sounds rather nice to me. I'd say there's no simpler life than one whereby your only goal is to study.
::'''Shohre:''' Even I sometimes want to borrow a book or two while looking at the tidy shelves in the House of Daena.
::'''Shohre:''' But that's just a thought. I'm too impatient to read. I can apply for access to the general summary in the [[Akasha System|Akasha]] if I really want to know about something.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry to bother you... I think I should go.
::'''Shohre:''' Oh, see you.
