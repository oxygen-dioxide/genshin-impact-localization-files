==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Many people forget to return the library books they've borrowed, leaving Lisa no choice but to chase them and retrieve the books. [[Marjorie]] and [[Sara]] have agreed to return the books they borrowed as soon as possible, but [[Donna]]'s seems to have been stolen. You decide to track the missing book down by following the trail left by an elemental marking Lisa made on it.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Investigate the first elemental mark)
:{{A|vo lslq002 1 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' The elemental traces are strong here, but it seems our thief {{Color|buzzword|did not stay for long}}.
:{{A|vo lslq002 1 lisa 02.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' The trail keeps going. Let's keep looking.
;(Investigate the second elemental mark)
:{{A|vo lslq002 2 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Hmm, it's further than I thought. Quite the intrepid explorer, our little thief.
:{{A|vo lslq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Maybe we frightened the turtle back inside his shell?
;(Investigate the third elemental mark)
:{{A|vo lslq002 4 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' It must be nearby.
:{{A|vo lslq002 4 lisa 02.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' {{Color|buzzword|Using Elemental Sight}}, you can even detect {{Color|buzzword|magic}}.
:{{A|vo lslq002 4 lisa 03.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Follow the flow of {{Color|buzzword|magic}} to find the book.

;(Approach the ruins)
:{{A|vo lslq002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The thief lives inside {{Color|buzzword|ruins}}? Mondstadt people do have some strange quirks.
:{{A|vo lslq002 5 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Please do not jump to such a preposterous conclusion about the living habits of Mondstadt's residents.
:{{A|vo lslq002 5 lisa 02.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' This seems far more likely to be the work of some none-too-friendly troublemakers.
:{{DIcon}} [[Hilichurl]]s?
::{{A|vo lslq002 5 lisa 02a.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Stealing books is hardly the hilichurls' style.
::{{A|vo lslq002 5 lisa 02a 1.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' All they would use books for is to keep their campfire going anyway.
:{{DIcon}} The [[Abyss Order]]?
::{{A|vo lslq002 5 lisa 02b.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' It's like you can read my mind.
:{{DIcon}} The [[Adventurers' Guild]]?
::{{A|vo lslq002 5 lisa 02c.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' It's not unlike them, in the sense that they are known for darting around amongst underground ruins.
::{{A|vo lslq002 5 lisa 02c 1.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' But Adventurers do not typically take others' belongings... Well, not from the living, anyway.
:{{A|vo lslq002 5 lisa 03.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' This is more likely to be the {{Color|buzzword|Abyss Order's}} doing. They do seem to have a way of slipping in and out of places like ghosts, after all.
:{{A|vo lslq002 5 lisa 04.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Also... There is an elemental seal at the entrance. It looks like the result of an [[Abyss Mage]]'s magic.
:{{A|vo lslq002 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A seal? How are we gonna break it? Is this gonna turn into another huge ordeal?
:{{A|vo lslq002 5 lisa 05.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Not to worry. If you think a little magic can keep me out, think again!
:{{A|vo lslq002 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why is that?
:;(Lisa casts lightning, breaking the seal and opening an entrance to the ruins)
:{{A|vo lslq002 5 lisa 06.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Come on.
:{{A|vo lslq002 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa...
:{{A|vo lslq002 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So this is what Lisa's like when she's hard at work...
----
;(Inside the Abyss Mage Stronghold)
:{{A|vo lslq002 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's so much bigger in here than Paimon thought...
:{{A|vo lslq002 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Do we really have to go all the way inside?
:{{A|vo lslq002 6 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' If you borrow a book, you have to return it. There will be no exceptions.
----
;(At the end of the domain, after defeating the [[slime]]s)
:{{A|vo lslq002 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, look! It's an {{Color|buzzword|Abyss Mage}}! Lisa was spot on!
----
:;(After defeating the Abyss Mage)
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 abyss 01.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' How did you find this place!? It's... so well hidden!
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I have no interest in finding out where you little rascals hide yourselves away. But I do want my book back.
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 lisa 02.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Tell me, how is it that you have the time to conceal your stronghold and apply a magic seal &mdash; but not to sign out a library book in the proper manner?
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 lisa 03.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' You have no respect whatsoever for other people's work.
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 abyss 02.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' ...You&mdash; You just want... the book?
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 abyss 03.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' I was unaware that anyone in Mondstadt was concerned with unearthing the secret hidden inside this book...
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 abyss 04.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' Who... Who are you?
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 lisa 04.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' The librarian. Although, I believe that should be quite clear already.
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 lisa 05.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Return the book. This is an ultimatum.
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 abyss 05.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' Hmph. Since you insist on concealing your identity...
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 abyss 06.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' I have all the less reason to give you that book.
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 abyss 07.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' After all, it contains... the secret...
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 abyss 08.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' Huh!? Wh&mdash;What are you doing!? Such concentrated elemental power! P&mdash;Please don't&mdash;
:{{Black Screen|''After using up all of Lisa's patience, the Abyss Mage loses consciousness in the ensuing electrical current...''}}
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 abyss 09.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' *shrieking*
:{{DIcon}} Lisa is so strong...
:{{DIcon}} Lisa is so terrifying...
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 lisa 06.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Hmph. Naughty boys who don't do what they're told need a little punishment to keep them in line.
:{{DIcon}} You didn't let him finish speaking...
:{{DIcon}} A LITTLE punishment!?
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 lisa 07.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' *sigh* This is why I call it troublesome work.
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 lisa 08.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' We'll just need to find the book ourselves. It should be around here somewhere.
----
;(Upon opening the [[Precious Chest]] in the room underneath)
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's {{Color|buzzword|The Pale Princess and the Six Pygmies|link=1}}! Paimon remembers that name, is this the one you were looking for?
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 lisa 09.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' That's the one. It's a good thing it isn't damaged, otherwise...
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Otherwise what? Are you telling me you have even more crazy punishments up your sleeve!?
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 lisa 10.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Hehe. I would probably have needed to dish out a little taste of one of my potions in that case.
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah!
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 lisa 11.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Then again... As I said, it isn't from the restricted section. Which is the only reason I would let the average citizen borrow it in the first place.
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 lisa 12.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' And it doesn't appear to have any abnormal elemental properties, save for the markings I put on it.
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah... It seems like just an average storybook.
:{{DIcon}} So why did the Abyss Order...
:{{DIcon}} (How mysterious. I'm so curious...)
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 lisa 13.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' As far as my duties as a librarian go, my troublesome work is finished.
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 lisa 14.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Since this book has piqued your interest, why don't I let you borrow it?
:{{DIcon}} What's the, um, due date?
:{{DIcon}} Please don't punish me if I return it late...
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 lisa 15.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' There's no time limit for you. I will register you as "custodian" rather than "borrower."
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 lisa 16.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' This is an exclusive privilege reserved for trusted citizens only.
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Exclusive privilege? Why does Paimon feel this is just your sneaky way of offloading your troublesome work onto someone else?
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 lisa 17.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Excuse me? Are you in some way dissatisfied with my work?
:{{DIcon}} No ma'am!
:{{DIcon}} I will take extra special care of this book...
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 lisa 18.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Good. You are amendable to reason then. I do wish I could keep you by my side as my personal assistant...
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 lisa 19.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' My work here is done. I'm going back.
:{{A|vo lslq002 10 lisa 20.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Don't forget to register at the library when you have a spare moment.
----
;(Back at the library)
:{{A|vo lslq002 11 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Ah, you've returned. The paperwork is done  you are now the custodian of this book.
:{{A|vo lslq002 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thank you Miss Lisa!
:{{A|vo lslq002 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...But Paimon thinks we're forgetting something.
:{{DIcon}} The Teyvat Travel Guide!
:{{DIcon}} Remuneration!
::{{A|vo lslq002 11 lisa 02.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' You are a voracious one, aren't you?
:{{A|vo lslq002 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look, over there on the shelf! Isn't that the {{Color|buzzword|Teyvat Travel Guide}}?
:{{A|vo lslq002 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And look how many copies there are!
:{{A|vo lslq002 11 lisa 03.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Hehe... The {{Color|buzzword|Teyvat Travel Guide}} is a serial publication. It is not part of the library's formal collection.
:{{A|vo lslq002 11 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh...
:{{A|vo lslq002 11 lisa 04.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Take one. Consider it your compensation for being Lisa's little helper today.
:{{A|vo lslq002 11 lisa 05.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' With you by my side, my troublesome work was a little less dull than usual.
:{{A|vo lslq002 11 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmph! The Teyvat Travel Guide was just bait to get us to do a day's work!
:{{A|vo lslq002 11 lisa 06.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' I hadn't anticipated that a few routine returns inquiries would take us out of the city let alone down into some underground ruins.
:{{A|vo lslq002 11 lisa 07.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' As compensation for dragging you into all this bother, take these souvenirs.
:{{A|vo lslq002 11 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, Lisa went and bought us some special souvenirs!
:{{A|vo lslq002 11 lisa 08.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' In fact, they were intended for our next routing, but... Never mind, we can discuss next time's activity when the time comes. I hope you are looking forward to it.
:{{A|vo lslq002 11 lisa 09.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' *yawn*
