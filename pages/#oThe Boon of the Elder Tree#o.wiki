'''"The Boon of the Elder Tree"''' is a gadget obtained by reaching [[Reputation]] Level 3 in [[Sumeru]].

It is used to obtain [[Wood]] materials from nearby trees in a radius around the player.

==Gameplay Notes==
* After using it, the gadget enters a 15 second cooldown.
* It cannot be used during [[combat]].
* The normal [[Wood#Obtaining|tree refresh rules]] are followed; namely, wood can be obtained from the same tree after ten other trees have been harvested for wood, and wood cannot be obtained from trees that have not yet fully loaded.
* Attempting to use the gadget when there are no nearby trees that can be harvested for wood displays the message '''No tree in this area can respond to "the Boon of the Elder Tree"'''<!--yes, "the" is lowercase-->.
* [[Arataki Itto]]'s passive talent [[Woodchuck Chucked]] applies when using the gadget.
