'''"The Boon of the Elder Tree"''' is a [[Gadget]] obtained by reaching [[Reputation]] Level 3 in [[Sumeru]].

It collects all available [[Wood]] from nearby trees in a <!--if anyone has the actual size of the radius put it here-->radius around the player. After use, the gadget enters a '''5''' second [[Cooldown]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* Cannot be used while in [[Combat]].
* The normal [[Wood#Obtaining|tree refresh rules]] are followed; namely, wood can be obtained from the same tree after ten other trees have been harvested for wood, and wood cannot be obtained from trees that have not yet fully loaded.
* Using the gadget when there are no nearby trees that can be harvested for wood displays the message '''No tree in this area can respond to "the Boon of the Elder Tree"'''<!--yes, "the" is lowercase-->.
* [[Arataki Itto]]'s passive talent [[Woodchuck Chucked]] applies when using the gadget.
