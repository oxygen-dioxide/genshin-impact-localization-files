==Descriptions==
{{Description|An aquatic creature that hunts by firing watery projectiles.<br>The ability to fire water bombs is of course not uncommon among Fontemer Aberrants. But for your average careless diver, most of whom are tourists, a high-pressure water current of this kind can pose a significant threat. The thickness of diving equipment is therefore necessary for two reasons – firstly, to resist the pressure of the water itself, but secondly, to protect against the attacks of Fontemer Aberrants.|[[Archive]]}}
