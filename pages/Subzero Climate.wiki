'''Subzero Climate''' is a climate effect that appears in areas high in {{Cryo}} concentrations, such as [[Dragonspine]]. In Subzero Climate, grass does not burn, and players can gain the [[Sheer Cold]] gauge.

Although Subzero Climate is represented with a [[Cryo]] icon, the climate by itself never applies {{Cryo}} to the player or other targets. Targets will be affected by {{Cryo}} only from other sources, such as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}.
