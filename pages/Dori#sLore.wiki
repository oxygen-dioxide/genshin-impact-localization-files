==Personality==
{{Quote|An elusive merchant who has a fondness for glittering Mora.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
Dori is a merchant of high regard in Sumeru, considered the most resourceful merchant who's able to acquire quality goods through her mysterious supply chain (which also includes [[Alice]]). She is extremely wealthy and highly obsessed with [[Mora]], seeing everyone and everything as a way to make profit. Her obsession with Mora is due to the fact that her older sister had an illness which her family couldn't afford treatment for at the time. She uses her spontaneous appearance and words to sway customers into buying her goods despite her jaw-dropping prices.

Willing to make Mora off just about anything, Dori also partakes in the black market, which has also caught the [[Matra]]s' attention. Due to this, she implemented some protocols to vet all potential customers to prevent her, her employees and potential customers from being held liable.

<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3-4 sentences. Outfits should be described on the outfit pages. -->
Dori uses the [[:Category:Short Female Characters|short female]] model. She has fair skin, golden brown eyes, and short pink hair. She also wears a pair of small glasses with reddish lenses and gold diamond-shaped frames.

{{Quote|No matter how rare the experimental materials are, you can buy them from Dori. I don't know where she gets her goods from... Also, make sure you pay attention to the price when you buy from her. My heart aches every time I pay the bill.|Tighnari}}
The unpredictable and elusive Dori seems to have an uncountable number of treasures.

As the most "resourceful" merchant in [[Sumeru]], she has a way to get you anything you need, be it precious gems, rare herbs, and exotic items that no one has ever heard of.

Of course, this doesn't come at a small price. Dori always has a warm smile on her face when quoting you jaw-dropping prices.

Some people see her as rain after a long drought, one that brings timely relief, while others regard her as an unscrupulous merchant who takes advantage of the situation.

But all this chatter doesn't faze Dori in the slightest. The only thing that echoes in the [[Palace of Alcazarzaray]] has always been the crisp sound of [[Mora]] tinkling.

              --><p>Speaking of which, her wares are just as curious as her style: special travel kit, outdoor dryer machines, automatic snowball launchers... You can probably buy anything you can think of from Dori. The only question is: Do you have enough Mora to do so?</p>

              --><p>"Hold your horses, hotshot. You're not taking that route, are you? There's a huge pack of monsters lying in wait ahead that-a-ways. But see, I have some weapons here that you won't regret purchasing &mdash; you know, for self defense!"</p><!--

              --><p>Adventurers who "have just received Dori's help in their time of need" at the cost of "paying a large sum of Mora at once" often develop conflicted feelings toward her &mdash; somewhere in between gratitude and a grudge.</p><!--
              --><p>For Dori's part, she considerately ignores the conflicted look on their faces, putting the fresh Mora in her almost-bursting purse and bidding them adieu with a contented smile.</p><!--

              --><p>Unfortunately, the capacity of the usual merchant routes was too limited for the delivery of commodities in such a gigantic quantity.</p><!--
              --><p>Many members of Dori's merchant caravans suggested rejecting certain orders to dial down the scale of delivery and maintain a decent, stable profit &mdash; one that already seemed set to make them immensely wealthy, given time.</p><!--
              --><p>But Dori took a very bold step: She accepted all the orders while starting cooperation with the [[Kshahrewar]] to establish new trade routes in areas that were known to be dangerous.</p><!--
              --><p>She opened the new routes up to nearby merchant caravans, took the opportunity to found a commerce guild and put the relevant resources to good use, and finally eliminated the bottleneck that her business was stuck in.</p><!--
              --><p>Today, Dori's new, built-from-scratch merchant routes are seen all across Sumeru, and the good reputation of "Lord Sangemah Bay" has spread far and wide.</p><!--
              --><p>The words Dori said to her caravan members have also become common knowledge:</p><!--
              --><p>"I'm not some stupid toadstool. I don't cancel or reject any orders."</p><!--

              --><p>It was at that moment that a doctor passed by and told Dori this:</p><!--

              --><p>Dori tried it for a few days and it didn't work. However, she was inspired by the failed attempt, ordering a large custom-made hourglass.</p><!--

              --><p>For example, her merchant caravans use [[Shaggy Sumpter Beast|Sumpter Beasts]] to carry cargo, so Dori had an "amusement park" built for the Sumpter Beasts such that they might enjoy their downtime.</p><!--

              --><p>Sumpter Beasts playing together in the amusement park make for a fun scene, so Dori took the chance to open the amusement park to tourists and sold tickets, food, and souvenirs to them.

              --><p>Dori's love for Sumpter Beasts is genuine, and so is her intention to make Mora out of that love.</p><!--
              --><p>Perhaps the Jinni in Dori's lamp knows this better than everyone else. The spirit was tricked into entering Dori's lamp, but it has never left since.</p><!--
              --><p>Dori will summon it into combat, but she will also grant its wishes afterwards.</p><!--
              --><p>Sometimes the Jinni even thinks that the fairy tale might actually have gotten things reversed &mdash;</p><!--
