{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Pan Guan'er:''' Are you a traveler? ...Did you see my axe on your way here?
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Pan Guan'er knows; Version 1)
:::'''Pan Guan'er:''' You've come to the right person. My family was in the mining business in the past. As a result, I have the ability to discern the quality of ore with a single glance, which earned me the moniker "Pan Guan'er."
:::'''Pan Guan'er:''' I've discovered no small amount of Crystal Ores nearby in the past two days. They truly are splendid! I recall that I saw them around...
:::'''Pan Guan'er:''' I've marked the locations out on your map. If you check those spots out, you're bound to reap quite the harvest!
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s nearby marked on the map)
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Pan Guan'er knows; Version 2)
:::'''Pan Guan'er:''' You've come to the right man, my ancestors were in the mining business. As such, I can discern the quality of ore with but one look. That's why they call me "Pan Guan'er."
:::'''Pan Guan'er:''' I've heard that these Crystal Ores were formed under the influence of Ley Line energies. They are very hard to come by, and very few smiths know how to work them.
:::'''Pan Guan'er:''' In the past two days, I discovered Magical Crystal Ores nearby &mdash; true treasures, and no mistake!
:::'''Pan Guan'er:''' My father once told me that such ores were born from the influence of Ley Line energies, and are more valuable than Crystal Ores by far!
:::'''Pan Guan'er:''' I've marked the locations out on your map. If you check those spots out, you're bound to reap quite the harvest!
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s nearby marked on the map)
:;(If there are no [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]])
:::'''Pan Guan'er:''' I've searched this entire area up and down looking for my axe, but I haven't seen a thing...
:{{DIcon}} You lost something?
::'''Pan Guan'er:''' Yes. I'm a lumberjack, I work in this area. But I lost my axe &mdash; again.
::'''Pan Guan'er:''' Maybe I misplaced it when I stopped to take a break?
::'''Pan Guan'er:''' But if it's genuinely lost, then as the legend says, an [[Adepti|adeptus]] should bring it back to me...
::'''Pan Guan'er:''' If that's the case... Maybe it would be quicker if I went looking for the adeptus instead?
::{{DIcon|Reward}} So, have you found the adepti?
:::'''Pan Guan'er:''' Not yet. No adeptus has come to give me back my axe, either. How strange...
:::'''Pan Guan'er:''' I did in fact pick up a sword.
:::'''Pan Guan'er:''' But... I don't know how to use swords! Did the adeptus get something wrong?
:::'''Pan Guan'er:''' Well, whatever. Why don't you take this sword with you I still need to wait for my axe to come back...
::;(Obtain 3{{star}} [[Skyrider Sword]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} Haven't seen it, sorry.
::'''Pan Guan'er:''' *sigh* ...Okay, then.
