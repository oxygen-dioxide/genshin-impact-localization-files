}}
The '''Second Who Came''', also known as the '''second throne of the heavens''', appeared in the world of [[Teyvat]] an unknown amount of time after the creation of humanity at the hands of the [[Heavenly Principles]]. In the ensuing battle between the Heavenly Principles and the Second Who Came, the heavens and earth were ravaged, with the region of [[Enkanomiya]] sinking underwater and becoming [[Dark Sea|severed from the surface world]] of [[Teyvat]].<ref name="Before Sun and Moon">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2|Before Sun and Moon}}</ref>

==Profile==
{{Quote|The second throne of the heavens came, and war was rekindled, as it was in the world's creation. That day, the heavens collapsed and the earth was rent asunder. Our ancestors and their ancestral land fell into this place during that conflict.|A scribe of [[Istaroth]]|[[Before Sun and Moon]]}}

==Story==
Little is currently known about the identity of the Second Who Came other than their appearance and conflict occurring untold ages before even the [[Archon War]]. The only confirmed information is that they arrived while [[Enkanomiya]] was part of the single, unified human civilization that spanned the world; later on, they came in direct conflict with the Heavenly Principles.<ref name="Before Sun and Moon" /><ref name="3 Martial Trials">{{Ref/Quest|The Three Great Martial Trials}}</ref>

Due to severe damage they sustained during their conflict with the Second Who Came, the Heavenly Principles "could no longer use their absolute authority to suppress the original order of this world." This caused the Heavenly Principles to collaborate with "one who came after" and create the [[Gnoses]] to maintain order.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Neuvillette|Vision}}</ref>

===Enkanomiya Beliefs===
A year after the people of Enkanomiya built the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]], they attempted to find a way back home, believing that the war on the surface world was likely over by that point. However, they were unable to find one, as the "powers of prohibition" had sealed Enkanomiya from the surface.<ref name="3 Martial Trials" /> According to a scribe of Istaroth, this ban was placed by the Heavenly Principles and accordingly, the Heavenly Principles emerged victorious over the Second Who Came.<ref name="Before Sun and Moon" />

==Trivia==
* The Second Who Came is currently the likeliest candidate for the identity of the Second [[Descender]].
* ''Before Sun and Moon'''s account of the war with the Second Who Came corresponds well with what is known of the conflicts involving the [[voyager]] and the Dragon King [[Nibelung]]. However, no source currently acknowledges the simultaneous presence of both individuals within the same conflict, making it difficult to ascertain which of them if either the Second Who Came's identity may be related to.
** The voyager is described as an entity from beyond Teyvat who pledged a union with the [[First Angel]], witnessed by the [[Aria, Sonnet and Canon|three moon sisters]], and as having incited a rebellion against the Heavenly Principles.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Deep Gallery's Echoing Song}}</ref> The voyager and the first angel's rebellion eventually leads to the Heavenly Principles sending down the [[Celestial Nail]]s and cursing the [[Angels]] into Seelies.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Deep Gallery's Moment of Oblivion}}</ref>
*** The fall of the Seelies are recorded within common Teyvat legends, and the destructive scope of the disasters in the two legends are described similarly: in the war with the Second Who Came, "the heavens collapsed and the earth was rent asunder."<ref name="Before Sun and Moon" /> During the fall of the Seelie, "the world collapsed around them,"<ref name="RoJ4">{{Ref/Book|Records of Jueyun|4|Mountain Spirits}}</ref> while on the moon sisters' side, "disasters overturned the sovereign carriage and laid ruin to the halls of the stars."<ref>{{Ref/Book|Moonlit Bamboo Forest|3}}</ref>
** Nibelung is described by both [[Apep]] and [[Kukulkan]] as having acquired [[Abyss]]al power from beyond Teyvat, only to later return to wage war against the Heavenly Principles.<ref name="What Shape Does the Self Hold>{{Ref/Quest|What Shape Does the Self Hold}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|An Omen of Annihilation and the Final Entreaty}}</ref>
*** The ancient dragons' great war of vengeance matches the description for the Second's war, as both nearly destroyed the fabric of the world, later requiring the Celestial Nail to mend, took place some time after the Heavenly Principles' initial establishment of their order, and left the [[Seelie]] race in ruins.<ref name="Before Sun and Moon" /><ref name="What Shape Does the Self Hold/>
