A '''Gnosis''', plural '''Gnoses''', is an item used by [[The Seven]] to directly resonate with [[Celestia]], and is proof of an Archon's status as one of The Seven.<ref name="C0A3">{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref> They take on the appearance of chess pieces.<ref name="C2A3">{{Ref/Quest|Wishes (Quest)}}</ref>

It is implied that the Gnoses were rewarded to the [[god]]s who emerged victorious from the [[Archon War]].<ref name="C3A5">{{Ref/Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies}}</ref>

==Overview==
The Gnoses are the embodiments of the [[Heavenly Principles]]' control over [[Teyvat]] and of the "laws,"<ref name="C3A5" /> created using the remains of the [[Descender|Third Descender]].<ref name="Finale">{{Ref/Quest|Finale}}</ref> After [[Nibelung]]'s great war of vengeance left the Heavenly Principles gravely injured and unable to use its absolute authority to subdue the world's original order, the Heavenly Principles and "one who came after" created the Gnoses as part of a "new order."<ref name="Neuvision">{{Ref/CS|Neuvillette|Vision}}</ref> The gods were driven to fight each other over possession of the Gnoses, with seven victors ultimately being chosen to each possess one of the elemental Gnoses.<ref name="C3A5" />

Taking on a physical appearance reminiscent of a gleaming chess piece, Gnoses typically reside within an Archon's chest.<ref name="C0A3" /><ref name="C3A5" /> They can either be forcefully removed through the powers of another god (as with the powers bestowed upon the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]] by the [[Tsaritsa]]),<ref name="C0A3" /> or willfully materialized and given away by the Archon themselves.<ref name="C2A3" /><ref name="C1A3">{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref>

It is suggested that [[Vision]]s began appearing either around the same time as the Gnoses or after The Seven were established,<ref name="Neuvision" /> and [[Venti]] calls Visions "primitive" compared to the Gnoses.<ref name="C0A3" /> Like Visions, Gnoses can hold their users' ambitions and obsessions, and losing the Gnosis can take the former owner's ambitions away.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies|archive=1|quote=Having lost the Gnosis, which now houses all his strong obsessions, The Balladeer falls out of his giant mechanical shell in despair and drops to the ground.}}</ref> Just as Visions cannot be destroyed or tampered with via mundane human methods,<ref>{{Ref/CS|Sucrose|Vision}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/CS|Keqing|Vision}}</ref> [[Ei]] failed in her attempts to turn her Gnosis into an energy supply device,<ref name="RS Gnosis">{{Ref/CS|Raiden Shogun|Gnosis}}</ref> although others have succeeded in using Gnoses to empower other devices.

==Current Ownership==
The [[Tsaritsa]] seeks to collect the Gnoses for unknown reasons. As of {{Quest|Incandescent Ode of Resurrection}}, six of them are in the [[Fatui]]'s possession:
# The {{Cryo}} Gnosis, presumably still in the Tsaritsa's possession.
# The {{Anemo}} Gnosis, obtained by [[Signora|La Signora]] forcibly taking it from [[Barbatos]].<ref name="C0A3"/>
# The {{Geo}} Gnosis, obtained by La Signora after fulfilling the Tsaritsa's end of the contract with [[Rex Lapis]].<ref name="C1A3" />
# The {{Electro}} Gnosis, obtained by [[Il Dottore]] after agreeing to [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]]'s ultimatum that he erase his segments in exchange, lest she destroy the Gnosis and potentially awaken the Heavenly Principles. Lesser Lord Kusanali was also motivated not to keep the foreign Gnosis as it would only "lead to disaster" for Sumeru.<ref name="C3A5" />
#* Lesser Lord Kusanali obtained the Gnosis after defeating [[The Balladeer|Scaramouche]],<ref name="C3A5" /> with whom [[Yae Miko]] exchanged the Gnosis for the [[Traveler]]'s safety,<ref name="C2A3"/> which was originally entrusted to her by [[Ei]] after she no longer had any need for it.<ref name="RS Gnosis" />
# The {{Dendro}} Gnosis, obtained by Il Dottore in exchange for giving Lesser Lord Kusanali information about the rumored intel that [[False Sky|"the skies of Teyvat are fake."]]<ref name="C3A5" />
# The {{Hydro}} Gnosis, obtained by [[Arlecchino]] as [[Neuvillette]]'s "diplomatic gift" for her and [[Tartaglia]]'s assistance against the [[Prophecy of Fontaine|prophecy]].<ref name="Finale" />
#* Neuvillette obtained the Gnosis after [[Focalors]] executed herself via the [[Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale]].<ref name="Finale" />
# The {{Pyro}} Gnosis is still possessed by [[Mavuika|Haborym]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|When All Becomes a Monument}}</ref>

==Abilities==
Little is known about the Gnoses' purpose or abilities. So far, they are said to:
* Allow Archons to resonate with Celestia directly<ref name="C0A3" />
* Grant Archons the "divine ability" to defend their nation<ref>{{Ref/CS|Zhongli|Gnosis}}</ref>
* Allow the user to summon a mass of elemental power at their owner's disposal<ref>{{Ref/CS|Nahida|Gnosis}}</ref>

Unlike humans, Archons have innate elemental abilities and do not rely on the Gnoses to wield the elements, proven by the way Venti, [[Zhongli]], Ei, and [[Nahida]] use their elemental abilities in battle during their respective [[Story Quests]], after having already parted with their Gnoses. That being said, Gnoses seem to greatly enhance an Archon's abilities; Zhongli states that the "power of the Geo Archon" is required to create [[Mora]] and indicates that the [[Golden House]] would have to temporarily close since he can no longer do this.<ref name="C1A3" /> He also suggests that he lost a significant portion of his power after relinquishing the Gnosis,<ref>{{Ref/VO|Zhongli|Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion}}</ref> and [[Azhdaha]] could sense that Zhongli was no longer the Geo Archon.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved}}</ref>

A god can gather their own element's power using another element's Gnosis, as seen when Nahida uses the additional power of the Electro Gnosis to summon Dendro power and unlock [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]]'s [[realm of consciousness]]. However, it remains to be seen whether a god can use a Gnosis to control an entirely different element, and Il Dottore's dialogue with Nahida suggests that it is not possible.<ref name="C3A5" />

After being made into a god, Scaramouche uses the Electro Gnosis to control the weather at [[Pardis Dhyai]], striking many Fatui personnel and [[Tighnari]] with lightning.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As by a God's Side}}</ref> It is unknown if he had any elemental abilities or was capable of utilizing the Gnosis before his apotheosis.

===As a Power Source===
While Ei failed to either create a vessel capable of housing her Gnosis or modify her Gnosis into a power supply device, others have used Gnoses to empower other devices. The currently known devices are:
* The [[Akasha System]] in [[Sumeru]], created by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata to combat [[forbidden knowledge]] during the [[cataclysm]] by linking the minds of those who wear Akasha Terminals. It required the energy of the Dendro Gnosis to work, but has since become defunct after Lesser Lord Kusanali shut it down and the Gnosis went into the Fatui's possession.
* [[Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom|Shouki no Kami]], a mechanical shell used to turn Scaramouche into an artificial god, developed by [[Sumeru Akademiya]]'s sages in collaboration with Il Dottore and the Fatui. Following Scaramouche's defeat at the hands of Lesser Lord Kusanali and the [[Traveler]], it is now defunct.<ref name="C3A5" />
* The Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale in [[Fontaine]] contained the Hydro Gnosis after Focalors merged with it in order to generate and store enough Indemnitium to execute herself and destroy the Hydro Archon's throne. With Focalors' execution, the Oratrice has ceased to function.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur}}</ref>
* The [[Sacred Flame]] in [[Natlan]] was kept alive using the Pyro Gnosis during the Abyss' attack against Natlan.<ref>{{Quest|The Rainbow Destined to Burn}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* In a standard Western chess game, there are only six distinct pieces: pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen, and king, which would be one short for a complete set of all The Seven's Gnoses. However, each side starts with a total of seven {{W|Glossary of chess#Major piece|major}} (2 rook and 1 queen) and {{W|Glossary of chess#Minor piece|minor}} (2 knight and 2 bishop) pieces. Upon reaching the other side of the chessboard, a pawn can also promote to these pieces.
** The models of the Anemo and Geo Gnoses resemble the queen and rook, respectively. Queens and rooks are considered major pieces, or pieces that can checkmate the opponent with only their own king for support.
*** In [[A Winter Night's Lazzo]], the Anemo Gnosis is likely used as a king instead, as the board would then match a position from {{w|Deep_Blue_versus_Kasparov,_1996,_Game_1|a real chess game}} between {{w|Deep Blue (chess computer)|Deep Blue}} and {{w|Garry Kasparov}}, and if the Anemo Gnosis were used as a queen in that game instead, the resulting position would be unusual.<ref>Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/vwkrsc/what_if_i_told_you_that_this_is_not_the_queen/ WHAT IF I told you... that this is not the Queen?]</ref> The Geo Gnosis appears to be used as a rook in the same game.
** Unlike the Anemo and Geo Gnoses, the Electro Gnosis does not strongly resemble a single chess piece. The bishop and the pawn are often suggested as the models for the Electro Gnosis. A bishop is a minor piece that may be used to checkmate but requires other pieces besides the king.
** The Pyro Gnosis also does not strongly resemble a chess piece, and is decorated with motifs found throughout and relating to Natlan.
** The appearance of the Dendro, Hydro and Cryo Gnoses have not yet been revealed.
* It is currently uncertain how much the mortal people of Teyvat know about Gnoses. Venti states that his Gnosis "isn't something [he is] meant to discuss with ordinary people," while many of the rank-and-file members of the Fatui do not seem to know much about the Harbinger's operations on the Tsaritsa's behalf.
** Yae Miko is aware of the power of a Gnosis and its connection to Celestia, and was responsible for guarding the Electro Archon's Gnosis. Whether this is information known to the [[Kitsune (Species)|kitsune youkai]] or simply because Raiden Ei briefed her on its function beforehand remains to be determined.
** [[Beidou]] seems to have at least a basic understanding that the Gnoses belong to the Archons when the Traveler mentions their thefts during her [[Hangout Event]], [[When the Crux Shines Bright]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Life on the High Seas}}</ref> How much she knows about their power and nature beyond this is currently unknown.
** Though not explicitly mentioned, the [[sage]]s involved in the god creation plan likely knew about the Electro Gnosis due to its importance to their plan.
** [[Lyney]] and [[Lynette]] knew of Arlecchino's plan to use the Hydro Gnosis to break the [[prophecy]] before handing it over to the Tsaritsa.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lies Cast Shadows Under Gathered Lights}}</ref>
** Mavuika disclosed that the Harbingers were after the Gnoses to [[Kinich]] and [[Iansan]],<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Decision (Archon Quest)}}</ref> who are among the small group of people she has been working with to save Natlan.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Past and Future}}</ref>
** Before [[Ayizu]] died, he told [[Thrain]] (known later as the Fatui Harbinger "The Captain") about the secret of the Pyro Gnosis, which caused him to resent Mavuika for not fulfilling her oath and prolonging the inevitable.<ref name="Ayizu">{{Ref/Quest|As One We Watch the Setting Sun|quote=
'''"The Captain":''' Together, Ayizu and I fought many battles and overcame countless hardships. However, he was unable to escape his fate, and in his final moments, told me the secret of the Gnosis.<br>
 '''Mavuika:''' So, it was him... He recommended using the Gnosis on several occasions, even before the tragedy. But, I turned him down each time.}}</ref> Ayizu also repeatedly urged Mavuika, the Pyro Archon at that time, to use the Pyro Gnosis to defeat the [[Abyss|Abyssal force]], which she refused each time for her own reasons.<ref name="Ayizu"/>

===Etymology===
* In {{w|Gnosticism}}, {{w|gnosis}} is a term used for wisdom, knowledge, or insight into divine nature. Through Gnosis, one can transcend the material realms controlled by the seven archons and enter the supercelestial realm of {{w|Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|Ogdoad}}.
* The Chinese term for Gnosis, {{zh|神之心|rm=Shén zhī Xīn|tl=Heart of God,}} is similar to the term for {{Lang|Visions|zh=神之眼|zh_rm=Shén zhī Yǎn|zh_tl=Eye of God}}. Both of them are called {{zh|魔力器官|tl=magical organs,}} which was translated as "magical foci" in English.
** During ''[https://youtu.be/TmaAOV4SJNQ Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo]'', after [[Capitano]] inquires about Scaramouche and the Electro Gnosis, Il Dottore replies that "Divine Knowledge cannot be rationally comprehended." The Chinese equivalent for "Divine Knowledge" is {{zh|神之灵知|rm=Shén zhī Língzhī}}, where {{zh|灵知|rm=Língzhī}} is the Chinese term for the Gnostic concept of ''gnosis''.
