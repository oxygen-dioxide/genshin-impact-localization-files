A '''Gnosis''' (plural '''Gnoses''') is an item used by [[The Seven]] to directly resonate with [[Celestia]], and is proof of an archon's status as one of The Seven.<ref name="C0A3">{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref> They take on the appearance of a chess piece.<ref name="C2A3">{{Ref/Quest|Wishes (Quest)}}</ref>

It is unknown whether [[god]]s before The Seven possessed Gnoses.

==Overview==
Taking on a physical appearance reminiscent of a gleaming chess piece, Gnoses typically reside within the Archon's body. They can either be forcefully removed through the powers of another Archon (as with the powers bestowed upon the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]] by the [[Tsaritsa]])<ref name="C0A3" /> or willfully materialized and given away by the Archon themselves.<ref name="C2A3" /><ref name="C1A3">{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref>

The [[Tsaritsa]] seeks to collect the Gnoses of The Seven for unknown reasons. Currently, three of them are known to be in Fatui possession:

*The Tsaritsa's own Cryo Gnosis;
*[[Venti]]'s Anemo Gnosis, taken through force by [[La Signora]] and presumably delivered to the Tsaritsa;<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref>
*[[Zhongli]]'s Geo Gnosis, obtained peacefully by Signora on the Tsaritsa's behalf through a contract and presumably delivered to the Tsaritsa<ref name="C1A3" />

[[Raiden Shogun|Ei]]'s Electro Gnosis is currently in [[Scaramouche]]'s possession after [[Yae Miko]], who previously received it from Ei, exchanged it for the [[Traveler]]'s life.<ref name="C2A3" /> However, Scaramouche has not reported back to the Fatui since then, and they believe he may have gone rogue.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Away With Obsessions and Falsehood}}</ref>

==Abilities==
All that is currently known about the uses of a Gnosis is that it is used to resonate with Celestia directly<ref name="C0A3" /> and grants its respective archon the "divine ability" to defend their nation.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Zhongli|Gnosis}}</ref> [[Venti]] describes [[Visions]] as "primitive" compared to a Gnosis.<ref name="C0A3" />

Just as Visions are indestructible by ordinary methods,<ref>{{Ref/CS|Keqing|Vision}}</ref> Gnoses are likewise incapable of being modified through normal means.<ref name="RS Gnosis">{{Ref/CS|Raiden Shogun|Gnosis}}</ref>

===Empowerment===
Archons do not need Gnoses to control the elements, unlike mortals who can only manipulate elemental energy by harnessing a Vision. Venti, [[Zhongli]] and [[Ei]] use their elemental abilities in battle during their respective [[Story Quests]], all of which occur after they lost or forfeited their Gnoses during their respective Archon Quests. In Ei's case, she gave up her Gnosis centuries before the Inazuma Archon Quests,<ref name="RS Gnosis" /><ref group="Note"> During [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]], Yae Miko says she has not seen Ei since Ei entered the Plane of Euthymia centuries ago. Because Ei personally entrusted her with the Gnosis, this means Ei has not had it for centuries.</ref> yet was able to defeat the [[Traveler]] during their first battle and was only defeated in the second due to [[Yae Miko]]'s plan.

That said, Gnoses seem to enhance an Archon's abilities greatly; Zhongli states that the "power of the Geo Archon" is required to create [[Mora]] and indicates that the [[Golden House]] would have to temporarily close since he can no longer do this. He also suggests that he lost a significant portion of his power after relinquishing the Gnosis.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Zhongli|Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion}}</ref> The benevolent [[Azhdaha]] could sense that Zhongli was no longer the Geo Archon.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*In a standard (western) chess game, there are only six distinct pieces: pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen and king, which would be one short for a full set of all The Seven's Gnoses. However, each side starts with a total of seven {{w|Glossary of chess#Major piece|major}} (2 rook and 1 queen) and {{w|Glossary of chess#Minor piece|minor}} (2 knight and 2 bishop) pieces. These are also the pieces a pawn can promote to.
**The Anemo Gnosis and Geo Gnosis are modeled after the queen and rook pieces, respectively. Queens and rooks are considered major pieces, or pieces that can checkmate the opponent with only their own king for support.
* It is currently uncertain how much the mortal people of [[Teyvat]] know about Gnoses. The Anemo Archon states his Gnosis, "isn't something I'm meant to discuss with ordinary people", while many of the rank-and-file members of the Fatui do not seem to know much about the Harbinger's operations on the Tsaritsa's behalf.
**[[Yae Miko]] is aware of both the power of a Gnosis and its connection to Celestia, and was responsible for guarding the Electro Archon's Gnosis. Whether this is information known to the [[Kitsune]], or simply because Raiden Ei briefed her on its function, remains unclear.
** [[Beidou]] seems to have at least a basic understanding that the Gnoses belong to the Archons when the Traveler mentions their thefts during her [[When the Crux Shines Bright|Hangout quest]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Life on the High Seas}}</ref> How much she knows about their power and nature beyond this is currently unknown.

===Etymology===
*In {{w|Gnosticism}}, {{w|gnosis}} is a term used for wisdom, knowledge, or insight into divine nature. Through gnosis, one can transcend the material realms controlled by the seven archons and enter the supercelestial realm of {{w|Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|Ogdoad}}.
*The Chinese term for Gnosis, {{Lang|mini=1|zh=神之心|zh_rm=Shén zhī Xīn|zh_tl=Heart of God}}, is similar to the term for {{Lang|Visions|zh=神之眼|zh_rm=Shén zhī Yǎn|zh_tl=Eye of God}}. Both of them are called {{Lang|mini=1|zh=魔力器官|zh_tl=magical organs}}, which was translated as "magical foci" in English.
**During ''[https://youtu.be/TmaAOV4SJNQ Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo]'', after [[Capitano]] inquires about Scaramouche and Inazuma's Gnosis, [[Il Dottore]] replies that "Divine Knowledge cannot be rationally comprehended." The Chinese equivalent for "Divine Knowledge" is {{lang|mini=1|zh=神之灵知|zh_rm=Shén zhī Língzhī}}, where {{lang|mini=1|zh=灵知|zh_rm=Língzhī}} is the Chinese term for the Gnostic concept of ''gnosis''.
