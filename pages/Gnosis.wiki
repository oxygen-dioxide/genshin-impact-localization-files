A '''Gnosis''' (plural '''Gnoses''') is an item used by [[The Seven]] to directly resonate with [[Celestia]], and is proof of an archon's status as one of The Seven.<ref name="C0A3">{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref> They take on the appearance of a chess piece.<ref name="C2A3">{{Ref/Quest|Wishes (Quest)}}</ref>

It is implied that the Gnoses were rewarded to the [[god]]s who emerged victorious from the [[Archon War]].<ref name="C3A5">{{Ref/Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies}}</ref>

==Overview==
The Gnoses are the embodiments of the [[Heavenly Principles]]' control over Teyvat and of the "laws." [[Scaramouche]]'s remarks preceding his fight against the [[Traveler]] and [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] suggests that the [[Archon War]] was fought over possession of the seven Gnoses. It is possible, although without any known basis, that destroying a Gnosis may attract the attention of the Heavenly Principles.<ref name="C3A5" />

Taking on a physical appearance reminiscent of a gleaming chess piece, Gnoses typically reside within an Archon's chest.<ref name="C0A3" /><ref name="C3A5" /> They can either be forcefully removed through the powers of another god (as with the powers bestowed upon the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]] by the [[Tsaritsa]])<ref name="C0A3" /> or willfully materialized and given away by the Archon themselves.<ref name="C2A3" /><ref name="C1A3">{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref>

The [[Tsaritsa]] seeks to collect the Gnoses for unknown reasons. Currently, five of them are in Fatui possession:

#The Cryo Gnosis, possessed by the Tsaritsa.
#The Anemo Gnosis, forcefully taken from [[Barbatos]] by [[La Signora]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref>
#The Geo Gnosis, peacefully obtained from [[Morax]] by La Signora through a contract.<ref name="C1A3" />
#The Electro Gnosis, peacefully obtained from Lesser Lord Kusanali by [[Il Dottore]] after she extracted it from the defeated Scaramouche in exchange for Dottore erasing his segments.<ref name="C3A5" />
#*Scaramouche peacefully obtained the Gnosis after [[Yae Miko]], who was entrusted with it, exchanged it for the Traveler's life; however, he went missing afterwards,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Away With Obsessions and Falsehood}}</ref> joined the experiment conducted by the [[Sumeru Akademiya]] and Il Dottore and was eventually defeated by the Traveler and Lesser Lord Kusanali.<ref name="C3A5" />
#The Dendro Gnosis, peacefully obtained from Lesser Lord Kusanali by Il Dottore in exchange for information about the rumor that "the skies of Teyvat are fake."<ref name="C3A5" />

[[Pierro]] played chess with the Anemo and Geo Gnoses during the Fatui Harbingers' gathering to mourn the passing of La Signora.<ref>Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: [[A Winter Night's Lazzo]]</ref>

==Abilities==
Little is known about the full abilities of the Gnoses. So far, they are said to resonate with Celestia directly<ref name="C0A3" /> and grant their respective Archons the "divine ability" to defend their nation.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Zhongli|Gnosis}}</ref> Nahida's understanding of the Gnoses was limited to knowing that they could be used to summon a mass of elemental power at its owner's disposal.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Nahida|Gnosis}}</ref> A god can use another element's Gnosis to gather their own elemental power, such as when Nahida used the Electro Gnosis to summon Dendro power and unlock [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]]'s realm of consciousness. However, it remains to be seen whether a god can use a Gnosis to control an entirely different element; [[Il Dottore]] states that Nahida had no way to use the Electro Gnosis in battle.<ref name="C3A5" />

Gnoses share some similarities with [[Vision]]s, though Venti calls Visions "primitive" compared to the Gnoses.<ref name="C0A3" /> Like Visions, Gnoses can hold their users' ambitions and obsessions, and losing the Gnosis can take the former owner's ambitions away.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies|archive=1|quote=Having lost the Gnosis, which now houses all his strong obsessions, The Balladeer falls out of his giant mechanical shell in despair and drops to the ground.}}</ref> Just as Visions cannot be destroyed or tampered with via mundane human methods,<ref>{{Ref/CS|Sucrose|Vision}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/CS|Keqing|Vision}}</ref> Ei failed in her attempts to modify her Gnosis.<ref name="RS Gnosis">{{Ref/CS|Raiden Shogun|Gnosis}}</ref>

===Empowerment===
Archons do not need Gnoses to control the elements, unlike mortals who can only manipulate elemental energy by harnessing a Vision. Venti, [[Zhongli]] and [[Ei]] use their elemental abilities in battle during their respective [[Story Quests]], all of which occur after they lost or forfeited their Gnoses during their respective Archon Quests. In Ei's case, she gave up her Gnosis centuries before the Inazuma Archon Quests,<ref name="RS Gnosis" /><ref group="Note"> During [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]], Yae Miko says she has not seen Ei since Ei entered the Plane of Euthymia centuries ago. Because Ei personally entrusted her with the Gnosis, this means Ei has not had it for centuries.</ref> yet was able to defeat the [[Traveler]] during their first battle and was only defeated in the second due to [[Yae Miko]]'s plan.

That said, Gnoses seem to greatly enhance an Archon's abilities; Zhongli states that the "power of the Geo Archon" is required to create [[Mora]] and indicates that the [[Golden House]] would have to temporarily close since he can no longer do this.<ref name="C1A3" /> He also suggests that he lost a significant portion of his power after relinquishing the Gnosis.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Zhongli|Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion}}</ref> The benevolent [[Azhdaha]] could sense that Zhongli was no longer the Geo Archon.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved}}</ref>

After being made into a god, Scaramouche uses the Electro Gnosis to control the weather at [[Pardis Dhyai]], striking many Fatui personnel and [[Tighnari]] with lightning.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As by a God's Side}}</ref> It is unknown if he had any elemental abilities or was capable of utilizing the Gnosis prior to his deification.

Gnoses have also been shown to power a God's legacy posthumously. Sumeru's [[Akasha System]], which was created by [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] and required the energy of the Dendro Gnosis to work, remained in operation even after she perished in the cataclysm 500 years ago.

==Trivia==
* In a standard (western) chess game, there are only six distinct pieces: pawn, rook, knight, bishop, queen and king, which would be one short for a full set of all The Seven's Gnoses. However, each side starts with a total of seven {{w|Glossary of chess#Major piece|major}} (2 rook and 1 queen) and {{w|Glossary of chess#Minor piece|minor}} (2 knight and 2 bishop) pieces. These are also the pieces a pawn can promote to.
** The Anemo Gnosis and Geo Gnosis are modeled after the queen and rook pieces, respectively. Queens and rooks are considered major pieces, or pieces that can checkmate the opponent with only their own king for support.
* It is currently uncertain how much the mortal people of [[Teyvat]] know about Gnoses. Venti states that his Gnosis "isn't something [he is] meant to discuss with ordinary people," while many of the rank-and-file members of the Fatui do not seem to know much about the Harbinger's operations on the Tsaritsa's behalf.
** [[Yae Miko]] is aware of both the power of a Gnosis and its connection to Celestia, and was responsible for guarding the Electro Archon's Gnosis. Whether this is information known to the [[Kitsune]], or simply because Raiden Ei briefed her on its function, remains unclear.
** [[Beidou]] seems to have at least a basic understanding that the Gnoses belong to the Archons when the Traveler mentions their thefts during her [[When the Crux Shines Bright|Hangout quest]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Life on the High Seas}}</ref> How much she knows about their power and nature beyond this is currently unknown.

===Etymology===
* In {{w|Gnosticism}}, {{w|gnosis}} is a term used for wisdom, knowledge, or insight into divine nature. Through gnosis, one can transcend the material realms controlled by the seven archons and enter the supercelestial realm of {{w|Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|Ogdoad}}.
* The Chinese term for Gnosis, {{zh|神之心|rm=Shén zhī Xīn|tl=Heart of God}}, is similar to the term for {{Lang|Visions|zh=神之眼|zh_rm=Shén zhī Yǎn|zh_tl=Eye of God}}. Both of them are called {{zh|魔力器官|tl=magical organs}}, which was translated as "magical foci" in English.
** During ''[https://youtu.be/TmaAOV4SJNQ Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo]'', after [[Capitano]] inquires about Scaramouche and Inazuma's Gnosis, [[Il Dottore]] replies that "Divine Knowledge cannot be rationally comprehended." The Chinese equivalent for "Divine Knowledge" is {{zh|神之灵知|rm=Shén zhī Língzhī}}, where {{zh|灵知|rm=Língzhī}} is the Chinese term for the Gnostic concept of ''gnosis''.
