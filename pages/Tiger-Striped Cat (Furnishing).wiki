|description    = An agile and wise soul, endowed since birth with a well-maintained elegance and pride.<br>This cat is intelligent and combative, and has quite the aura of prestige to it. These cats are excellent at earning the favor of humans and are often able to get the upper hand when it comes to gathering food. As such, they tend to get fat quite quickly.<br>However, there is no shortage of food in the Realm Within, leading to a decline in their competitive nature. Given enough time, these kitties have the potential to become fat, round balls of fur. Thankfully, their unemployed fellow kin use their sense of duty as a means of encouraging them to stay fit.
