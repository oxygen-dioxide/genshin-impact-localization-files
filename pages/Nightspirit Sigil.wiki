'''Nightspirit Sigil''' is an exploration mechanic in [[Natlan]]. 

[[Iktomisaur]]s and [[Masters of the Night-Wind]] characters can use [[Spiritspeaking]] to scan these sigils. Different sigils yield different effects, including temporary [[Movement SPD]] and [[jump]] boosts, [[Energy]]/[[HP]] regeneration, and [[Investigation]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* Nightspirit Sigils that confer boosts will respawn about 4 seconds after being scanned, while sigils that trigger Energy/HP regeneration or Investigation only respawn after 24 hours.{{verify}}
* Boosts conferred by Nightspirit Sigils only apply to the character who scanned them. Thus, they can only be applied to Masters of the Night-Wind characters (and [[Saurian Indwelling|indwelled]] Iktomisaurs).
** Switching out the character will not remove the boost or affect its duration.
** If the sigil was scanned while indwelling an Iktomisaur, exiting the indwelling will remove the boost.
** Multiple characters within the same team can hold boosts simultaneously.
* Each boost lasts for about 8 seconds.
** Scanning the same type of sigil again will refresh the duration.
** The Nightspirit Sigil jump boost does not disappear after one jump, unlike the jump boost obtained by using Spiritspeaking to absorb [[Phlogiston]].
* Multiple types of boosts can be active simultaneously. Their durations will be counted separately.
** The jump boost obtained by absorbing Phlogiston can also be active at the same time. It is considered separate from the Nightspirit Sigil jump boost.
* Boosts are visually indicated by blue streams of light that rotate around the player character. Each boost adds 2 streams.
* The Nightspirit sigil jump boost only affects the special high jump performed by Masters of the Night-Wind characters and Iktomisaurs, not regular jumping.
* Unlike most Movement SPD buffs, the Nightspirit Sigil Movement SPD boost also affects [[Gliding]] speed.
* For Iktomisaurs, Energy/HP regeneration sigils will only restore HP.
