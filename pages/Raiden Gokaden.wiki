The {{Lang|'''Raiden Gokaden'''|ja=雷電五箇伝|ja_tl=Five Traditions of Raiden}} were five bladesmithing schools in [[Inazuma]]'s weaponsmithing scene, each specializing in their own unique forging art. According to legend, the Raiden Gokaden were developed when a ronin taught his five disciples the art of forging. Each art then developed their own techniques and secrets.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Amenoma Tougo}}</ref> The families in the Raiden Gokaden eventually also became key members of the [[Yashiro Commission]] due to the cultural importance swordsmithing held in Inazuma.<ref name="Hues3">{{Ref/Quest|A New Painting in Pale Scarlet (Quest)}}</ref>

Presently, only the [[Amenoma Art]] still thrives while the Isshin Art has been mostly lost following the Case of the Eccentric, which saw [[Kaedehara Yoshinori]] put an end to the practice to protect his family from [[Scaramouche]]. The other three schools and their forging arts were completely destroyed as a result of Scaramouche's machinations. 

==The Five Schools==
===Amenoma Art===
{{main|Amenoma Smithy}}
The {{lang|'''Amenoma Art'''|ja=天目伝}} is the only surviving school in the Raiden Gokaden that continues training new apprentices. Its current master is [[Amenoma Tougo]], with [[Hajime]] as his disciple.

===Isshin Art===
{{main|Isshin Art}}
The {{lang|'''Isshin Art'''|ja=一心伝}} only barely survives in the present. In the past, it was host to three master swordsmiths, also known as the ''Isshin Sansaku'': [[Kaedehara Kagemitsu]], [[Niwa Nagamitsu]], and [[Akame Mitsunaga]].<ref name="Haran">{{Ref/Weapon|Haran Geppaku Futsu|Lore}}</ref><ref group="Note">In the English localization of Haran Geppaku Futsu, the Isshin Sansaku are described as three works created by Kagemitsu, Nagamitsu, and Mitsunaga. While the phrase {{lang|''sansaku''|ja=三作}} literally translates to "three works," ''sansaku'' is also used as a collective title for the real-life swordsmiths Kagemitsu, Nagamitsu, and Sanenaga, three master swordsmiths of the Bizen Osafune School.</ref> The [[Kaedehara Clan]], [[Niwa Clan]], and [[Akame School]] were the three main families who followed the Isshin Art's practice up until the Case of the Eccentric.

===Futsu Art===
{{main|Futsu School}}
The {{lang|'''Futsu Art'''|ja=経津伝}} is a lost school. Its third-generation master, [[Futsu Minori]], forged the Hasui Geppaku Futsu, while her foster son [[Futsu Masayoshi]] forged the [[Haran Geppaku Futsu]]. While Masayoshi was more skilled in swordsmithing than his sworn brother [[Futsu Hiroyoshi]], Minori's son, Hiroyoshi eventually inherited the Futsu school while Masayoshi went on to mentor the swordsmiths who would later become the ''Isshin Sansaku''.

===Hyakume Art===
The {{lang|'''Hyakume Art'''|ja=百目伝}} is a lost school. No further information is known about them at the time.

===Senju Art===
The {{lang|'''Senju Art'''|ja=千手伝}} is a lost school. No further information is known about them at the time.

==History==
According to legend, the Raiden Gokaden were developed when a ronin taught his five disciples the art of forging. Each art then developed their own techniques and secrets.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Amenoma Tougo}}</ref> The families in the Raiden Gokaden eventually also became key members of the [[Yashiro Commission]] due to the cultural importance swordsmithing held in Inazuma.<ref name="Hues3">{{Ref/Quest|A New Painting in Pale Scarlet (Quest)}}</ref>

Sometime after the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago, [[Mikoshi Nagamasa]] became an Inspector for the [[Inazuma Shogunate]]. He developed an interest in weaponsmithing while in [[Tatarasuna]], authoring a book titled ''Anthology of Inazuman Blades'' which covered some of the notable blades forged by the Raiden Gokaden.<ref name="Haran" /> Nagamasa was also involved in a certain incident revolving around the Daitatara Nagamasa, a blade he forged at Tatarasuna. Around this time, his yoriki [[Katsuragi]] discovered a nameless "wandering eccentric" and took him in. This, however, would lead to tragedy: when the wanderer was pursued by Nagamasa's group, Katsuragi's "misconduct" made Nagamasa fly into a rage, slashing and killing his yoriki with the Daitatara Nagamasa before throwing the blade into the furnace.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Katsuragikiri Nagamasa|Lore}}</ref><ref>Interactible: [[Rather Aged Notes]]</ref> Nagamasa would later clash with the wanderer; the wanderer survived, while Nagamasa's fate is left unknown.

===Case of the Eccentric===
In order to take revenge an unspecified "bladesmith," the wanderer &mdash; adopting the name "Kunikuzushi" &mdash; masterminded the fall of the Raiden Gokaden. By the time of [[Kaedehara Yoshinori]]'s generation,<ref group="Note">Yoshinori is Kaedehara Kazuha's great-grandfather and was a young man by the time these events occurred. Assuming Kazuha is in his late teens to early twenties, and every generation spans roughly 20 to 40 years, the events that directly led to the Kaedehara Clan's collapse would have taken place around 60–120 years ago.</ref> the Futsu, Hyakume, and Senju schools had befallen strange mishaps and disappeared.<ref name="calabash">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Calabash of Awakening}}</ref>

When the Isshin Art was tasked with recreating a ''goshintou'' with a diagram from the [[Raiden Shogun]], their swordsmiths kept producing defective blades. Afraid of the punishment they would receive for failing to produce a successful blade by the due date, the swordsmiths fled, taking refuge with the [[Fatui]] and going on a self-imposed exile to [[Snezhnaya]].<ref name="KagoIsshin">{{Ref/Weapon|Kagotsurube Isshin}}</ref> Suspecting that the diagram had been tampered with to sabotage them, Yoshinori and the [[Kamisato Clan]] head at the time attempted to pursue them. They were intercepted and singlehandedly defeated by Kunikuzushi, who was the one responsible for tampering with the diagram. After realizing Yoshinori was from the Niwa family and raised by the Kaedehara family after his father disappeared, Kunikuzushi left Yoshinori and the Kamisato head alive with a vague message: "Tell her this. My name is Kunikuzushi."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Palace, Dyed in Black (Quest)}}</ref> He then left, having lost interest in his project.<ref name="calabash" /> This incident came to be known as the Case of the Eccentric.<ref name="KagoIsshin" />

Afraid of retaliation should they reveal the truth, Yoshinori and the Kamisato head agreed to cover up the events that had transpired. On account of his old age and the wounds he had sustained, the Kamisato head died shortly afterwards, leaving a vacancy in the clan and the commission. Furthermore, the failure to produce a successful blade or apprehend the fleeing swordsmiths was seen as a failing of the Yashiro Commission, which lost the Kamisato Clan its prestige and led to harassment by the Fatui.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Kamisato Ayaka|More About Kamisato Ayaka: II}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/VO|Kamisato Ayaka|More About Kamisato Ayaka: III}}</ref> The matter was taken before the Raiden Shogun, but before she could pronounce her judgement on the issue, [[Yae Miko]] intervened on the Kamisato Clan's behalf. The Shogun spared the clan from punishment, and the Kamisatos thereafter swore to serve the Shogun eternally out of gratitude.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Yae Miko|5}}</ref>

Kunikuzushi joined the Fatui at some point himself,<ref name="calabash" /> although whether that occurred before, during, or after this incident is currently unclear.

===Legacy===
The Amenoma Art is the only school among the Raiden Gokaden to continue its practice to this day, led by [[Amenoma Tougo]]. Kunikuzushi's attack on Yoshinori and the Kamisato head had lasting impacts on the Kaedehara and Kamisato Clans: Yoshinori ended the practice of the Isshin Art and his son, [[Kaedehara Kazuha]]'s grandfather, never discovered the truth and was unable to revive the family business. By the time Kazuha came of age, the Kaedehara Clan lost its fortunes and properties.<ref name="Hues3" /><ref>{{Ref/CS|Kaedehara Kazuha|2}}</ref> The Kamisato Clan failed to rebound from the repercussions of the event until [[Kamisato Ayato]] became the clan head.

Yoshinori wrote down the truth of what had occurred, but concealed it using ink that would only appear after coming into contact with water. The truth remained undiscovered up until Ayato, while investigating a Fatui spy who had searched through the confiscated Kaedehara Clan's possessions, came across the document and figured out the secret it held. Ayato then masterminded a plan to relay the truth he had uncovered to Kazuha over the course of the [[Irodori Festival]], using a fabricated legend of [[The Five Kasen]] as a metaphor.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Five Colors' True Form}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*The sword art schools are referred to as {{Lang|mini=1|ja=伝|ja_tn=Tradition/School,}} while the practices are referred to as {{Lang|mini=1|ja=流|ja_tn=Art.}}

===Etymology===
*The term {{lang|''gokaden''|ja=五箇伝|ja_tl=The Five Traditions}} is ascribed to five major swordsmithing schools in Japan, each named after the province where the school originated from. The Japanese ''gokaden'' are: the Yamashiro tradition ({{lang|mini=1|ja=山城伝}}), the Yamato tradition ({{lang|mini=1|ja=大和伝}}), the Bizen tradition ({{lang|mini=1|ja=備前伝}}), the Sōshū tradition ({{lang|mini=1|ja=相州伝}}), and the Mino tradition ({{lang|mini=1|ja=美濃伝}}).
**The Isshin Art appears to be somewhat analogous to the Bizen tradition: The Isshin Art's three masters (''sansaku''), Kagemitsu, Nagamitsu, and Sanenaga (Mitsunaga in the English localization) are directly named after the ''sansaku'' of the Bizen Osafune School.
