|description = A sly animal as elusive as a fairy that often appears in folk stories, symbolizing unusual cunning and ancient memories.<br>A small fox that hides in amongst the tree and thick grass, prudently avoiding the dangerous gaze and arrows of hunters. Folk legends across Teyvat all contain stories of foxes that have lived for many years and gathered a great deal of wisdom, and even stories of foxes turning into human form. The popular children's fable "[[The Fox in the Dandelion Sea]]" tells just such a tale.

==Trivia==
* This fox seems to be a fictional animal without a direct counterpart in the real world, considering its names in East Asian versions. While these versions use the terms that can refer to the {{w|red fox}}, whose binomen is ''Vulpes vulpes'', they are less common forms in their languages, not to mention the fact that the Teyvat counterpart of ''Vulpes vulpes'' is implemented as [[Kitsune]]. Therefore, it is more natural to interpret the names as the literal sense of the red fox (a ''Vulpes vulpes''-like animal whose color is red).
