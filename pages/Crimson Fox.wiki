==Trivia==
*This fox seems to be a fictional animal in Teyvat and have no direct counterpart in the real world, considering its names in East Asian versions. While these versions use the terms that can refer to the {{w|red fox}}, whose binomen is ''Vulpes vulpes'', they are less common forms in their languages, not to mention the fact that the Teyvat counterpart of ''Vulpes vulpes'' is implemented as [[Kitsune]]. Therefore, it is more natural to interpret the names as the literal sense of the red fox (a ''Vulpes vulpes''-like animal whose color is red).
