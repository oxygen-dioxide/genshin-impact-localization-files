|description    = A stone raised flower bed common throughout [[Fontaine]], adorned with bunches of brilliant lake-blue flowers.<br>According to legend, these kinds of flowers were once ordinary blue flowers. But centuries ago, researchers managed to extract precious royal purple pigments from their petals, and the price skyrocketed. As the methods of dye-making have matured, the symbolism of these flowers and association with being "royal" has faded into little more than a pretty name...
