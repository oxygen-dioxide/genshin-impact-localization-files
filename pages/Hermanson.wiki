:: {{A|VO Hermanson 01.ogg}} "Liyue's tea is certainly delicious. But it takes too much work to brew!"
{{Dialogue End}}

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hermanson:''' Liyue tea is great, but it's hard to brew, and that's a headache for those who just want a quick drink.
:{{DIcon}} Have any suggestions?
::'''Hermanson:''' Hah, I have an idea!
::'''Hermanson:''' We'll break the leaves up into smaller pieces, then put them in a cloth or paper bag.
::'''Hermanson:''' And when you want tea, you can just put the bag in a cup and add water.
::'''Hermanson:''' You can even separate the tea leaves and the tea immediately after making it. Not bad, right?
::'''Hermanson:''' Once I return to Fontaine after this deal, I'm going to put my invention into production right away.
::'''Hermanson:''' People in my line of work always have a lot of ideas, but I can't let them have this one.
::{{DIcon}} Does this count as drinking tea?
:::'''Hermanson:''' Frankly speaking, this may not be the best way for those who are serious about tea.
:::'''Hermanson:''' After all, the cloth and the paper bags will carry flavor all their own, which might affect the flavor of the tea in turn.
:::'''Hermanson:''' Grinding the tea leaves too finely might also have an impact on the flavor.
:::'''Hermanson:''' We'll just have to keep trying to improve the paper or the cloth bags to minimize the aforementioned influence they might have.
:{{DIcon}} Speed really isn't the goal when drinking tea, is it?
::'''Hermanson:''' I've been doing business in Yilong Wharf for a decade, and I realized something...
::'''Hermanson:''' Not everyone knows how to appreciate tea. Some aren't particular about the flavor.
::'''Hermanson:''' It's unrealistic to ask them to spend a ton of time studying how to properly make the stuff. They'd find the step you need to wash the residue troublesome alone, to say nothing of the whole process.
::'''Hermanson:''' My tea bags are only for those who're looking for a quick cup. The traditionalists can still make tea the old-fashioned way. No one will be hurt!
:{{DIcon}} Bye, and good luck.
::'''Hermanson:''' Farewell, you too!
