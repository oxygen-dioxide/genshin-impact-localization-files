{{Dialogue start}}
;(At the top of the elevator shaft)
:'''Old Maintenance Raven:''' Eh? nothing seems wrong with this particular elevator's functions... So why isn't it working?
:'''Old Maintenance Raven:''' Um, youngster, could you help me have a look? I'm afraid my limbs aren't what they used to be...

;(Approach the bottom of the shaft through the cave)
:'''Hidden Night Raven:''' Zzz... I must... train more... Zzz... So I can...
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, so there is a night raven dozing off while stepping on this platform. No wonder we couldn't activate the lift! Let's try waking it up...
:{{DIcon|Hand}} Tap Fence
:'''Hidden Night Raven:''' Eh!? There's someone here? Agh, I'm gonna be busted!

;(Take the elevator into the cellar)
:'''Cellar Guard Raven:''' Halt! This is a restricted area. I cannot simply let you through...
:{{DIcon}} There's a raven sleeping in the elevator...
::'''Cellar Guard Raven:''' Sleeping in the elevator? That cannot be true! I saw nothing of the sort...
:{{DIcon}} I've come to check the elevator...
::'''Cellar Guard Raven:''' Ah, that... Alright then. Check it and leave as soon as possible.

;(Talk to the Hidden Night Raven in the cellar)
:'''Hidden Night Raven:''' Ah! I—I'm busted, aren't I... Pl—Please don't tell anyone you saw me here.
:{{DIcon}} What's going on here?
:'''Hidden Night Raven:''' *sigh* Well, I'm just staying here for the time being. My elder brother is a guard here — yes, he's the one guarding the cellar door.
:'''Hidden Night Raven:''' I want to become a guard like him, but I'm not strong enough yet, so I'm learning in secret here...
:{{DIcon}} Why did you have to hide in the cellar?
:'''Hidden Night Raven:''' I'm not a Night Raven Guard, but I'm in the castle. If I were to be discovered by the other guards, my brother would be in for it...
:'''Hidden Night Raven:''' So please, don't tell anyone...
:{{DIcon}} Alright, you have my word.
:'''Hidden Night Raven:''' Thank you! You are a kind soul indeed!
:'''Hidden Night Raven:''' I will observe and learn as much as I can to become a Night Raven Guard worthy of the title!

;(Talk to the Cellar Guard Raven again)
:'''Cellar Guard Raven:''' There were no problems here, right? Well, then leave quickly!

;(Talk to the Trainee Cellar Guard Raven after returning to the cellar)
:'''Trainee Cellar Guard Raven:''' Hey, it's been a while, hasn't it? Remember me? I was the night raven you caught hiding in the cellar, sleeping in the elevator! I did it! I've become a guard!
:'''Trainee Cellar Guard Raven:''' Now I can join my brother in guarding the castle cellar... Ah, yes, this is just a small token of my appreciation for not telling on me. Again, thank you so much!

;(Talk to the Trainee Cellar Guard Raven again)
:'''Trainee Cellar Guard Raven:''' All my hard work paid off! I'm now a glorious member of the Night Raven Guards, just like my brother!

;(Talk to the Cellar Guard Raven after returning to the cellar)
:'''Cellar Guard Raven:''' I'm proud to have a brother who also entered the castle in service of our Prinzessin.
