|text1    = A Portable Waypoint is a man-made replica of a Teleport Waypoint. It can link to the world's ley lines to some degree, through which it can perform teleportation. When used, it sets a Teleport Waypoint at your current location. You can use this Pocket Waypoint through the map in the same manner as a normal Teleport Waypoint.

|text2    = The Portable Waypoint does have some limitations, however: it will vanish from its position after seven days, and only one can be placed at any one time. Placing a Portable Waypoint in a world that already has one will destroy the pre-existing Portable Waypoint.
