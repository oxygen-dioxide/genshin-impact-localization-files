'''Dusty Balloons''' are brown balloons found in certain [[gliding]]-related challenges. They can also be found in some quests. They are not commonly found in the open world.

If touched, they burst, creating a dust cloud that temporarily obstructs the player's vision. The dust cloud is similar to how [[Treasure Hoarder]] Gravediggers can obstruct vision.
