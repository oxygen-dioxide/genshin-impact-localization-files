'''Waltz of Earth, Wind and Thunder''' is a boss rush event [[Domain]] exclusive to the [[Hypostatic Symphony]] event. It contains the trio comprising of [[Pure Anemo Hypostasis]], [[Pure Electro Hypostasis]], and [[Pure Geo Hypostasis]]. Unlike what the name suggests, the order matches that of the description instead.

By default, you have 960 seconds (or 16 minutes) to defeat the three bosses (this limit can be decreased via variations).

==Strategy==
===Low Tier Route===
*Difficulty Level: Easy
*Total Score: 700
*Time Remaining: 193s

The lowest variations were taken as there was only leftover score to get. Regardless, here are some tips:
*General Tips
**The spawn order will go from [[Pure Anemo Hypostasis]], [[Pure Electro Hypostasis]] to [[Pure Geo Hypostasis]], spawning in succession when the previous is defeated.
**Expect to spend 100 seconds just on mechanics alone.
*[[Pure Anemo Hypostasis]]
**Unfortunately the Elemental Orbs generated by its tornado attack which it will use after its first death will not carry over to the next fight when it is defeated and will disappear, so be sure to collect them if wanted.
*[[Pure Electro Hypostasis]]
**Be sure to save {{Pyro}} and {{Cryo}} characters such as [[Amber]], [[Xiangling]], [[Klee]], [[Kaeya]] and their [[Elemental Burst]] for the last phase.
*[[Pure Geo Hypostasis]]
**Be sure to save {{Geo}} characters such as [[Noelle]] and their [[Elemental Burst]] for the last phase.
**If going for a one shot speed clear, use [[Bow]] characters like [[Amber]], [[Fischl]] and [[Ganyu]] to attack the Hypostasis as it floats on top of a Basalt Column.
