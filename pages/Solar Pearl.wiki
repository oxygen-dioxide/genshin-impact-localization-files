==Description==
Rumored to be a legendary orb of Liyue.<br>
It once absorbed all the light in the world, but was kept inside a wooden box for millennia afterwards.<br>
Even so, its power has not dissipated. Now released from its container, it shines evermore.<br>
In the hands of a truly knowledgeable sage, perhaps its extraordinary power would finally be unleashed after lying dormant for millennia.

A story that has long been popular with the jewelers of Liyue holds that the master craftsman [[Kunwu]] once took the light of the heavenly bodies and sealed it in a wooden box.<br>
Kunwu then buried that box deep inside a dark rocky chamber, where it remained in pitch blackness for forty-nine days and twenty hours, till finally the pearl within had absorbed the shine of the sun and moon.

A most bizarre tale indeed. And yet, to this day, many in Liyue hold steadfastly to their belief in the esoteric talents of the master craftsman Kunwu.<br>
Someone once plucked up the courage to ask the aging craftsman what his secret was. The eccentric old man laughed off the nonsensical notion of his mystical capabilities:<br>
"Pfft! 'Twas purely the product prolonged polishing!"

But his apprentice revealed a different story when asked about it in private: Just as Kunwu finished polishing the Solar Pearl, the splendor of the heavens shone down and a crimson moon filled the sky.<br>
But did this phenomenon mean that Kunwu had indeed received divine assistance in his craft? Or was it a measure of his own accomplishment that his lofty ambitions had sufficed to send waves through the firmament and even elicit a response from the heavenly bodies?
