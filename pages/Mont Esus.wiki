{{Description|Some foothills by the sea close to the [[Palais Mermonia]]. Visitors can feel the gentle breeze as they step onto the vast flower fields.<br>According to ancient records, a magnificent palace was once built here. Named after the flowers, it sought to sing praises of love and to nurture abandoned orphans above the countless waters. Though the high tower of old no longer graces this land, the flowers remain as fragrant as ever.|[[Expedition]] description}}
