===The Outlander Affairs Agency===
;(Talk to [[Kageyama]])
:{{A|vo dqaq002 1 kageyama 01.ogg}} '''Kageyama:''' Hello, please state your name, identity, and the purpose of your visit. Oh, except you, Thoma.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 1 kageyama 02.ogg}} '''Kageyama:''' You must be... new here.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Heh...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 1 kageyama 03.ogg}} '''Kageyama:''' Excuse me? Please provide the information requested, and also declare any goods you are carrying with you.
:{{DIcon}} We are here to... trade wine. And ore.
::{{A|vo dqaq002 1 kageyama 04a.ogg}} '''Kageyama:''' Currently, only members of the International Trade Association are authorized to engage in the import and export of goods. Do you have your trader's permits?
:{{DIcon}} We are here to find my {{MC|sister|brother|mc=1}}.
::{{A|vo dqaq002 1 kageyama 04b.ogg}} '''Kageyama:''' Oh? Well, I'm sorry. We cannot approve entry for purely personal reasons. So, unless you have a valid reason for visiting in accordance with the rules...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... uh... w&mdash;we&mdash;uh...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 1 kageyama 05.ogg}} '''Kageyama:''' My apologies, but I'll have to ask you to&mdash;
:{{A|vo dqaq002 1 thoma 01.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Here are their entry papers, for your kind perusal.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!? Ugh, take your time! No rush or anything!
:{{A|vo dqaq002 1 thoma 02.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Haha, I just wanted to see what you'd say... sorry about that.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 1 kageyama 06.ogg}} '''Kageyama:''' ...I see, okay. Your papers are all in order. Welcome to Ritou.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Pheeeew...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, where do we go next?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 1 thoma 03.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' The Outlander Affairs Agency.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 1 thoma 04.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' They only check entry permits here. If you want to remain on Ritou, there's a process you have to go through with them.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sheesh, so it is super strict, just like everyone says.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 1 thoma 05.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Well, let's not forget that to everyday folk in Inazuma, people from everywhere else are referred to as "outsiders."
:{{A|vo dqaq002 1 thoma 06.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' As the word suggests, outlanders aren't very welcome in Inazuma with the [[Sakoku Decree]] in force.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 1 thoma 07.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Not even on Ritou, where they've established an Outsider Settlement.
:{{DIcon}} Welcome or not, we don't have a choice.
:{{DIcon}} My journey must go on.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 1 thoma 08.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Hehe, I like how you think. I've got a feeling we're going to get along very well.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 1 thoma 09.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Now. Let's head over to the Outlander Affairs Agency.

;(While walking around)
:{{A|vo dqaq002 2 thoma 01.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Most of the current rules were put in place by the administration of Ritou &mdash; the Kanjou Commission.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Kanjou Commission?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 2 thoma 02.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Yes, one branch of the Tri-Commission of Inazuma. Responsible for growing and managing the nation's wealth. Um... you really haven't heard of it before?
----
;(Talk to [[Yurika]])
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 yurika 01.ogg}} '''Yurika:''' You've completed the entry procedures, yes? And now you want to apply for residency? Both of you?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yes, please!
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 yurika 02.ogg}} '''Yurika:''' Okay. The processing fee will be two million Mora.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' T&mdash;Two million! For a processing fee? Are you serious!?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 yurika 03.ogg}} '''Yurika:''' That's right, one million per applicant, which makes two million total. Don't worry, you can trust my math.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon wasn't so much questioning your math as... Ugh...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 01.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Hahaha... Ma'am, these two here are good friends of mine. I think you'll find I'm one face you recognize.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 yurika 04.ogg}} '''Yurika:''' Ah, Mr. Thoma, it's you. By way of courtesy, allow me to reduce it to 400,000 Mora total.
:{{DIcon}} That's still quite expensive...
:{{DIcon}} That is a major discount...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 02.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Thank you ever so much, Miss Yurika.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 03.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' But as this is just a processing fee... I think 600 Mora should cover it if I'm paying on their behalf? I'll treat you to dinner, too. How does that sound?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's not how you haggle! By all means, bargain the price down, but&mdash;
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 yurika 05.ogg}} '''Yurika:''' Alright then. As you wish, Mr. Thoma. I will make a record.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 04.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Hee-hee, much obliged.
:;(Yurika leads the three inside the building.)
:'''''The residency application is processed smoothly at the Outlander Affairs Agency'''''
:;(Thoma, Paimon, and the Traveler leave for the entrance to the Agency.)
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!? She went from two million down to 600? There's something seriously wrong with people's sense of finance around here!
:{{DIcon}} I think it's about more than the Mora.
:{{DIcon}} Reminds me of someone else's strange relationship with Mora...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 05.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Hehe, it's not as mind-boggling as you think. "Processing fee" is just a figure of speech.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 06.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' The way some here at the agency see it, the fees are easy money, so it becomes a question of how much they can make.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 07.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' So when the day comes that some poor merchant from overseas with more money than sense gets stuck here and needs to apply for residency...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then they'll milk them for all they're worth!
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 08.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Exactly. It's at times like this that having a local friend really comes in handy.
:{{DIcon}} That's blatant oppression against outlanders...
:{{DIcon}} Doesn't anyone push back?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 09.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Yes, but when you're an outlander in Inazuma, far from home, in this closed-nation era, there's very little that can be done about it.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 10.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' The most that overseas merchants can do to look after themselves is stick together.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 11.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' That's how the International Trade Association came about.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So it's a trade association built by and for outlanders?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 12.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Yep, and as well as advancing commercial interests, the association provides help, support, and structure for outlanders trying to survive on Ritou.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 13.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Essentially, it's an association devoted to both commercial excellence and survival skills.
:{{DIcon}} So how would an outlander ever get to meet...
:{{DIcon}} The Raiden Shogun feels further away than ever...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* Sounds like just stayin' alive is an achievement when you're an outlander in Inazuma...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 14.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' I see... so this is the real purpose of your trip. Yes, given that you are outlanders, it's certainly a lofty aspiration.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 15.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' After all, the Raiden Shogun is the most exalted and revered one in all of Inazuma. She is a deity who reigns on high, while all other life gazes up in awe.
:{{DIcon}} That may well be...
:{{DIcon}} I still have to find a way!
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 16.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' ...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 17.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' I was going to say, nothing is set in stone when it comes to who you will encounter in this world. Who's to say you won't happen to run into the Raiden Shogun one day after lunch...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh-huh... And is that likely...?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 18.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Okay, I'll give it to you straight. I know of a way to introduce you to the Raiden Shogun.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really!? Wow, the Ritou fixer is better connected than we thought!
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 19.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Ahem, hehe &mdash; I mean, it will take all the resources I have at my disposal, but it can be done. However, before we get there...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 20.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Connections come at a high price, you understand?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, not you too!
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 21.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Hahaha! No, no... In this instance, when I say price, I'm not talking about Mora.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 22.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' In fact, there's no real cost, as such. It's just that... if this is something you really want, you'll have to agree to help other people solve some of their problems first.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 23.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' I like to do things in a way that keeps everybody happy. It's my own personal rule for dealing with situations like this.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds very reasonable to Paimon! You're the man in the middle, so you have to trade favors to keep everyone indebted to you.
:{{DIcon}} The fixer works in mysterious ways...
:{{DIcon}} So, what's the job?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 24.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Heh... Why do I get the feeling you're making me out to be some sort of crook... Uh, never mind.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 25.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Here's the situation. As I touched upon earlier, the members of the International Trade Association are constantly struggling to survive.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 26.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Recently, things seem to have gotten more difficult than ever for them. So just go and check things out, see if there's any way you can help.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 3 thoma 27.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' The head of the association is called [[Kurisu]], and he's a good friend of mine. Go talk to him, I'll wait for you here.

;(Talk to Thoma again)
:{{A|vo dialog dqaq002 thoma 01.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Kurisu will reach his wits' end if things carry on like they are. Go see what you can do for him.

===The International Trade Association's Problems===
;(Talk to Kurisu)
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 01.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' Oh? Hello there, you must be seeking refuge with the International Trade Association. The Outlander Affairs Agency took you for all you're worth, I suppose.
:{{DIcon}} Very nearly...
:{{DIcon}} Luckily, we had a friend with us.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 02.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' Ah, good, that's a relief. *sigh* ...You need to be careful, or you'll find yourself losing your savings all at once.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We heard the association has been having some difficulties lately. Is that true?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 03.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' Yes... left, right, and center. Obstacles at every turn. But that's nothing new for us.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Sakoku Decree certainly makes things difficult for anyone who wants to come here from overseas.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 04.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' But it's not the root cause of our woes. The Sakoku Decree might restrict our scope of activity, but in and of itself it doesn't stop us from being able to enjoy a comfortable existence.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 05.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' No, what's really squeezing us outlander merchants dry is...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 06.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' ...those Mora-grubbers from the Kanjou Commission.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, of the three Commissions, that's the one that oversees everything on Ritou, isn't it?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 07.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' That's right. They impose astronomical tax rates, unbelievable regulations, and that's not the worst of it...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 08.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' They just issued a new Tax Decree recently that, for some reason, completely changes the way we pay our taxes. It used to be Mora, but now it's something called [[Crystal Marrow]].
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Crystal Marrow...? What's that?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 09.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' Something that most of us in the association had never heard of before either, until the new decree came along.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 10.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' Eventually, one of the older Liyue merchants recalled that he once shipped a batch of it to [[Snezhnaya]] in his youth.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 11.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' So in order to pay our taxes, we began an arduous search for this Crystal Marrow.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 12.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' But then we found we'd only managed to create a bigger problem for ourselves. The rising demand for Crystal Marrow drove the price higher and higher...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 13.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' Now, there's only one vendor who even has it in stock. We can't get hold of it anywhere else...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... isn't that what they call a monopoly?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 14.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' Exactly. So this vendor keeps pushing the price up, and we have no choice but to buy from them because the Tax Decree forces us to...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 15.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' It's a vicious cycle, the consequence of which is that our taxes will soon exceed our profits... and once that happens...
:{{DIcon}} This is absurd treatment.
:{{DIcon}} Can't you discuss the situation with the Kanjou Commission?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 16.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' We've tried communicating with the commission directly...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 17.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' But this is a nation where the cries of a few struggling merchants will never be heard over the ever-present roar of thunder...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 18.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' *sigh* [[Fontaine]], my dear homeland... I miss you an awful lot at the moment...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds awful, they're really bleeding them dry.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Traveler), what do you think we should do?
:{{DIcon}} Try our best to negotiate with the Kanjou Commission?
::{{A|vo dqaq002 5 paimon 08a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But Kurisu's the head of the association and even he hasn't had any luck. Not to mention, we're outlanders too...
::{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 19a.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' Right, and besides... I think this may well be the fate they've ordained for us.
::{{A|vo dqaq002 5 paimon 08a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, well we could try tackling the problem by going to the other party involved...
:{{DIcon}} The vendor does {{sic|sounds}} like a fishy character.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 19b.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' *sigh* That vendor...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 20.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' I've actually done business with him in the past, but after a point, he stopped contacting us. I have no idea where he sources the stuff...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... Well, it definitely sounds like he's being unfair. How do we find him? We could go talk to him and see if he lets anything slip.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 21.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' Hey, that's a pretty good idea! Since you're not affiliated with the association and you're new to Ritou, he may just let his guard down.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 kurisu 22.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' If I remember correctly, our usual meeting point with him is under a tree by the coast in the residential district. See if you can find him there.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 5 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Got it! We're on the case!

;(Talk to Kurisu again)
:{{A|vo dialog dqaq002 kurisu 01.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' I can't thank you enough for helping me out. If you've got no place to go, you're always welcome at the International Trade Association.
----
;(Talk to Werner)
:{{A|vo dqaq002 7 werner 01.ogg}} '''Werner:''' Hm? I don't think I recognize you, are you new arrivals?
:{{DIcon}} Yes, we just arrived.
:{{DIcon}} You don't recognize me? But I'm the fixer 'round these parts!
::{{A|vo dqaq002 7 werner 02b.ogg}} '''Werner:''' Haha, very funny. Real "Fixers" don't need to refer to themselves that way. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 7 werner 03.ogg}} '''Werner:''' So. What do you need with me?
:{{DIcon}} Where do you source your goods?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 7 werner 04.ogg}} '''Werner:''' The sheer nerve! You don't go around asking questions like that! If I gave you my sources, I might as well hand you the whole darn business!
:{{A|vo dqaq002 7 werner 05.ogg}} '''Werner:''' Trade secret, got it? You know what "trade" and "secret" mean, right? Tsk.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This guy's got a bad attitude...
:{{DIcon}} Can you... reduce your prices?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 7 werner 06.ogg}} '''Werner:''' Hah! Are you even buying!? ...Ohh, I see what's going on here. Kurisu and his associates sent you here to try and plead their case, didn't they?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 7 werner 07.ogg}} '''Werner:''' Heh, they're wasting their time. The price is non-negotiable, not by a single Mora.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, what's your problem!?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 7 werner 08.ogg}} '''Werner:''' Get out of here, go on. Tell them they're lucky to be buying from me in the first place, and they ought to be more grateful. If it weren't for me, they'd be in seriously hot water.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What are we gonna do? There's no talking to this guy...
:{{DIcon}} Time to get the real fixer on the case...
:{{DIcon}} Let's go talk to Thoma.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good idea. Let's check back in with him.

:(Talk to Werner again)
:{{A|vo dialog dqaq002 werner 01.ogg}} '''Werner:''' Hmph. I'm the only lifeline they've got. How dare they try and bargain with me!
----
;(Talk to Thoma)
:{{A|vo dqaq002 9 thoma 01.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Hm? That was quick... You resolved it already?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, actually we're having a little trouble...
:{{DIcon}} You're going to have to help us help you.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 9 thoma 02.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Oh? Well, by all means, tell me what you need. I'll help as much as I can.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 9 thoma 03.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Getting you to go fixing things when you've only just arrived is quite a demand.
:{{DIcon}} What do you know about Werner?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 9 thoma 04.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Oh, that guy? I'm familiar.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 9 thoma 05.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' He used to be a bit of a sorry sight, selling shells that he'd collect on the beach just to get by. But he seems to have suddenly shot up in the world recently.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 9 thoma 06.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' I can only assume he must have found himself a patron after leaving the International Trade Association.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? You're saying he used to be a member of the International Trade Association? So he's an outlander, too?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 9 thoma 07.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Yes... couldn't you tell when you spoke to him?
:{{DIcon}} Seemed like a Mondstadter to me.
:{{DIcon}} At least, I didn't get the impression he was a local.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 9 thoma 08.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' That's right, Werner was born in Mondstadt, then went into the shipping business, trading between Liyue and Inazuma.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 9 thoma 09.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' When Inazuma closed to the outside world, he was one of a group of outlanders that ended up stranded on Ritou.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, what a bummer...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 9 thoma 10.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' The International Trade Association was initially very generous to him, but over time, with decree after decree, the association members found it increasingly difficult to make ends meet...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, he left the association and turned his back on them!
:{{A|vo dqaq002 9 thoma 11.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Haha, I'm sure it's more nuanced than that. I believe even the most ungrateful and cold-hearted of people still have some amount of gratitude and warmth left in them somewhere.

:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 werner 01.ogg}} '''Werner:''' What are you doing back here? Just 'cause I got plenty of time on my hands doesn't mean I want to waste any of it talking to you.
:{{DIcon}} Time on your hands... Some would call that a form of freedom.
:{{DIcon}} It was the wind that led me back here to you.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 werner 02.ogg}} '''Werner:''' Huh? Where's this coming from...
:{{DIcon}} A Dandelion Wine would sure be nice on a day like this...

:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just close your eyes already!
:{{DIcon}} Listen closely... doesn't it sound familiar...?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 werner 09.ogg}} '''Werner:''' You mean... the sound of the ocean?

:{{DIcon}} May the flames of virtue spread to all...
:{{DIcon}} ...and never be extinguished!
:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 werner 11.ogg}} '''Werner:''' Xiao Lanterns! Haha, I'm right there, at the [[Lantern Rite Festival|Lantern Rite]]! Oh... look at them, floating up into the sky!

:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 werner 13.ogg}} '''Werner:''' Wait... Stop, that's enough... Don't make me relive it any more, my poor heart can't take it...
:{{DIcon}} A lot of people out there sympathize with the position you're in.
:{{DIcon}} A lot of people have supported you in the past.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 werner 14.ogg}} '''Werner:''' You mean... the folks from the International Trade Association... And I suppose they are far from home, just like me.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 werner 15.ogg}} '''Werner:''' Often, I'll sneak down to the shore at night and listen to the sound of the waves... I like to imagine it's the voice of my hometown, carried across the ocean.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 werner 16.ogg}} '''Werner:''' I've run into folks from the association more than a few times doing just that, but I always hide my face and slip away...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 werner 17.ogg}} '''Werner:''' *sigh* Don't you think I've wanted to talk things through with them, and free myself from this anguish?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... well, no one's stopping you, so...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 werner 18.ogg}} '''Werner:''' They're so resilient. None of them had anyone else to rely on, so they rallied together, committed to finding a way to survive... But I couldn't do it, I'm not strong enough...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 werner 19.ogg}} '''Werner:''' So... I caved... Those people, they'd make the smallest of promises, offer the most measly benefits, and I'd do whatever they asked of me... and make Mondstadters look like the worst people in the world...

:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 werner 20.ogg}} '''Werner:''' ...Alright, I'll tell you the whole story. It's eating me up inside and I can't take it anymore.

:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, come on, get it off your chest. What's the deal here?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 werner 22.ogg}} '''Werner:''' It's a scheme by the tax-collection ashigaru. [[Keijirou]] and his companions.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 werner 23.ogg}} '''Werner:''' They start by overtaxing the merchants, then take the extra Crystal Marrow they receive and stockpile it.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 werner 24.ogg}} '''Werner:''' Once the merchants run out of places to buy Crystal Marrow, they get me to sell that extra stock back to the merchants at an extortionate price, with the proceeds going to the tax-collection ashigaru.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's just... it's plain evil, gouging them like this.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 werner 25.ogg}} '''Werner:''' I'm their puppet, yes... but my cut is a tiny fraction of what we take in total. It's barely enough for me to live on.
:{{DIcon}} We need evidence.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 werner 26.ogg}} '''Werner:''' Evidence? Hmm... You're right, without conclusive evidence, he will never admit it.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 werner 27.ogg}} '''Werner:''' Now that I think about it, whenever I report back to him after a sale, he always heads to the same place. It's always made me suspicious...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 11 werner 28.ogg}} '''Werner:''' As it happens, I handed some Mora over to him not long ago. I can show you where he went if you want.

:{{A|vo dqaq002 13 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He was right there a moment ago... Seems he disappeared in the blink of an eye.

:{{A|vo dqaq002 15 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Boring... Paimon thought he'd hidden a big pile of Mora here.

:'''''Kurisu reads through each and every item in the ledger.'''''

:{{A|vo dqaq002 17 kurisu 05.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' So, Mr. Keijirou, it seems you have some explaining to do. How shall we settle this, hmm?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 17 keijirou 04.ogg}} '''Keijirou:''' Hmph! So you think you can use this against me do you? I&mdash;It's quite obvious that I'm merely trying to earn a modest living for myself, like anyone else...!
:{{A|vo dqaq002 17 kurisu 06.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' Word has it that samurai in the commission place great importance on reputation and prestige... Though, I'm sure commission members won't blame you once word gets out...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 17 keijirou 05.ogg}} '''Keijirou:''' Huh? Is that a threat? Are you threatening me!?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 17 kurisu 07.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' No, not at all. I'm simply stating that it would be quite a pity if an illustrious gentleman such as yourself were to have their reputation tarnished.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 17 keijirou 06.ogg}} '''Keijirou:''' Uhh... W&mdash;Well even if what you say is true, what do you suggest we do about it...?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 17 kurisu 08.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' I believe you still have a quantity of Crystal Marrow in your possession, correct?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 17 kurisu 09.ogg}} '''Kurisu:''' Perhaps that Crystal Marrow could be used as compensation for the recent tax hike, and us merchants could finally have some more breathing room.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 17 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is that it?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 17 keijirou 07.ogg}} '''Keijirou:''' Hmph, do you have any idea the hoops I had to jump through to get the Crystal Marrow and keep it hidden!? Ugh, fine! In that case, I'll send it over to you today.

;(Talk to Thoma)
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 01.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Corruption seems rife in the Kanjou Commission, they truly are rotten to the core... *sigh*
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 02.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Alright. Time for me to answer your questions. What would you like to know?
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Yashiro Commission.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Shirasagi Himegimi.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 03.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Haha, straight to the point. Let me re-introduce myself.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 04.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' I belong to the [[Kamisato Clan]] of the Yashiro Commission on [[Narukami Island]]. I'm an attendant of the Shirasagi Himegimi.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, you've been keeping your true identity a secret from us this whole time!
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, the Yashiro Commission. Guessing that's another branch of the Tri-Commission?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 05.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Correct. The Kamisato Clan is the head of the Yashiro Commission, who manage ceremonial and cultural affairs. I'd go into more detail on what exactly that covers, but I'm not even sure myself.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 06.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' I'm just someone who was fortunate enough to be taken in by the Kamisato Clan. My role is to take care of the daughter of the clan &mdash; [[Kamisato Ayaka]], also known as the Shirasagi Himegimi.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seems like she must be super-famous in Inazuma, given the reaction of those guys just now.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 07.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Hahaha... Oh, most definitely. She's graceful, dignified, and kind-hearted, too. The people of Inazuma quite adore Miss Kamisato.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 08.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Her fame even somewhat eclipses that of her older brother, Kamisato Ayato, despite the fact that he is the current head of the clan.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 09.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' I suppose those who treat others with compassion earn themselves the same treatment in return. Miss Kamisato's situation certainly seems to attest to that. Take me, for example &mdash; I'm just an attendant, and yet she treats me as an equal, as she would a friend.
:{{DIcon}} So where did this "fixer of Ritou" thing come from?
:{{DIcon}} So as her attendant... are we helping you or her...?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 10.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' You're asking the right questions. And to be honest, I don't want to keep you in the dark any more than is necessary.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 11.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Firstly, you should know that being a fixer is not something you can fake. I spent the better part of a month tirelessly building up a network of relationships on the island, and I got to know Captain Beidou during that time, too.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Still pretty good going for just a month's work!
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 12.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Haha, well, maybe I have a slight knack for schmoozery. But the main thing was, I had to make sure I'd be in time to receive you when you arrived.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 13.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Inazuma may have closed off to the outside world, but that hasn't stopped a lot of people from hearing about your feats in Mondstadt and Liyue.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 14.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' So, when Miss Kamisato heard of your intention to come to Inazuma, she began looking forward to your arrival with great anticipation. She's excited to find out whether the rumors are true...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 15.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' ...that is, that you have what it takes to change the tide of the times.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Change the tide of the times?
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 16.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' In the test that I gave you earlier, although there were a few hiccups at the end, it was you who found the way to turn the situation around.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 17.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Navigating powerful people, using their character flaws to your advantage... it's just what Miss Kamisato had hoped to see.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 18.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' With your help... even the Vision Hunt Decree&mdash;
:{{DIcon}} I never offered to help.
:{{DIcon}} I refuse.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 19.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' ...Ah.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 20.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Hmm, that's an unexpected development. Perhaps our sources were misleading...
:{{DIcon}} I have one goal here: to meet the Raiden Shogun.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 21.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' ...Yes, of course. I completely understand, and as agreed, I shall help set that up for you.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, Thoma sure didn't put up much of a fight...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 22.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Hah... Well, my work on Ritou is done, so I suppose this is goodbye for now.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 23.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Oh, one more thing &mdash; this Invitation Letter is for you... When you get to Narukami Island, you can find me at [[Komore Teahouse]], as per the letter.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 thoma 24.ogg}} '''Thoma:''' Good luck with everything. See you soon.
;(Thoma leaves)
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thoma's not such a bad guy, huh. We should get going.
:{{DIcon}} But...
:{{DIcon}} There is one problem...
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What's up?
:{{DIcon}} Outlanders are unable to leave Ritou.
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, right! Paimon forgot all about that!
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, so... did Thoma forget that, too?
:{{DIcon}} I think perhaps not...
:{{DIcon}} This must be the next part of his "test."
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Darn it! Grr, no wonder he was so matter-of-fact about the whole thing!
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' As soon as we get off Ritou, Paimon's going straight to Komore Teahouse to settle the score!
:{{A|vo dqaq002 20 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, well, guess we should give it a try. Let's head to the border and see how far we get.
