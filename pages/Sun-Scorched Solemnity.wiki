|description    = This plain, solemn-looking carpet with a darker "sun-bleached white" as its base color is also host to a large number of sharp and angular patterns. the style here is different from the styles that are more popular in [[Sumeru City]], using a thicker make common to the desert. The materials are also derived from that same sea of sand. The dye used comes from the roots of a common plant, while the fabric is taken from [[Sumpter Beast]]s or [[Desert Fox]]es that have died of natural causes. In the past, products made from fur tended to be quite expensive. Now, however, some desert settlements have adopted more efficient collection and management of animal pelts, leading to increased production of all kinds of furs, including this carpet. But since carpet-making is a slow, done-by-hand process, the price is still slightly higher than other woven rugs sold in Sumeru City.
