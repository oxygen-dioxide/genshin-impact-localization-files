==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Lovi:''' The [[Gardemek]]s are like huge clockwork toys! I wonder if I could open one up and have a look.
:{{DIcon}} Like clockwork toys, do we?
::'''Lovi:''' Yes. My father's a great scientist at the [[Fontaine Research Institute]], and he brings me lots of fun toys!
::'''Lovi:''' I love opening them up from the inside out and putting them back together bit by bit.
::'''Lovi:''' Well, that later bit doesn't work out sometimes, but other times, I can pull it off without a hitch!
:{{DIcon}} I don't think you can...
::'''Lovi:''' *sigh* You're not gonna make some story up to scare me off, are you?
::'''Lovi:''' "Oh, you can't touch this, or the [[Gardes]] will catch you!"
::'''Lovi:''' Adults are so boring. That [[Freminet|blonde guy]] I met at [[Leschots Clockwork Workshop|Leschots]]'s is way cooler.
::'''Lovi:''' He doesn't say much, but he lets me open his [[Pers|clockwork penguins]] up.
::'''Lovi:''' That penguin was super cute, and its internals were really interesting as well. I think he made it himself, actually! Oh, I'm so envious of him!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Lovi:''' Hmm... When will I own a clockwork toy of this kind?
