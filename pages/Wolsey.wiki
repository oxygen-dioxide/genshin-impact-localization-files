: {{DIcon|Idle}} Welfare Meal...
:: {{A|VO Wolsey 01.ogg}} "Grab yourself a welfare meal."
{{Dialogue End}}

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Wolsey:''' Claim Welfare Meals from [[Bran]]. Is there anything else you need?
:{{DIcon|Shop}} What do you sell here?
::'''Wolsey:''' Recipes and dishes, no surprises. Take a look.
:{{DIcon}} About Welfare Meals...
::'''Wolsey:''' They aren't just free. They also provide unexpected surprises to liven up our monotonous lives. Great, huh?
::'''Wolsey:''' Although according to feedback surveys, people have been asking for more variety, and to increase the ratio of delicious meals...
::'''Wolsey:''' And some people want a points system. Eat five bad meals in a row, get one good meal of your choice, that kind of thing...
::'''Wolsey:''' But behind every bad meal, there's a chef who made that meal. And I think we should give those chefs and their subpar cooking a chance.
::'''Wolsey:''' So as for those suggestions... I'll have to think on it a bit more.
:{{DIcon}} About the Fortune Slips...
::'''Wolsey:''' We ask everyone to help write the fortunes. Sometimes we all need a little pep talk and a little courage from people in the same circumstances as us.
::'''Wolsey:''' Although we have had problems with people trying to write inappropriate fortunes to stir up trouble... It's a real headache.
::'''Wolsey:''' I'm just trying to do something nice for everyone, but now I have to waste my time checking all the fortunes.
::'''Wolsey:''' Thankfully, none of them have caused any major problems... But if any fortunes end up causing me misfortune, then the cost will have exceeded the benefits.
:{{DIcon}} About Bran...
::'''Wolsey:''' It was broken even before work stopped at the [[Geode Mine Shaft]], so there was even less reason to fix it afterwards. As a result, it was just sitting there, broken, in the abandoned production zone, for who knows how long...
::'''Wolsey:''' After [[Camden]] started complaining about the strange sounds it was making disturbing his naps, I brought it back here to fix it up. Then I found a job for it.
::'''Wolsey:''' I'm quite the mechanic, you know. I bet I could teach those kids at the [[Fontaine Research Institute]] a thing or two.
:{{DIcon}} It's nothing. Sorry to bother you.
::'''Wolsey:''' Come back any time if you need something.
