|ja_note  = The word “格律” is borrowed directly from the Chinese title, where it denotes poetic meter. However, its meaning is entirely different in Japanese, where it refers instead to principles and maxims (especially as relating to Kantian philosophy), losing the lyrical/literary connotation of the original title.
