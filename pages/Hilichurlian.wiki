<section begin="Description" />'''Hilichurlian''' is one of the main languages of Teyvat spoken and is spoken predominantly by hilichurls.<section end="Description" />

==Overview==
Hilichurlian is the language spoken by [[Hilichurls|hilichurls.]] It is unknown if hilichurls have a writing system for their language.  

Hilichurlian isn't well understood in [[Teyvat]] as few people are interested in hilichurls; According to [[Ella Musk]], Hilichurlian Linguistics is an underdeveloped academic field. Due to the risk of humans interacting with hilichurls, its study is limited by the researcher's ability to complete field work.<ref name="ella musk">{{Ref/NPC|Ella Musk}}</ref> Due to this, the study of Hilichurlian Linguistics is predominantly driven by Ella Musk's ongoing research and that of her ancestor &mdash; most likely her grandfather &mdash; [[Jacob Musk]]. Jacob Musk was described as the "Poet Laureate" of Hilichurlian for his book, ''[[Hilichurl Ballad Selection]]'', an accolade he was not fond of.<ref name="hili ballads">{{Ref/Book|Hilichurl Ballad Selection}}</ref> Ella Musk introduces her self as a professor of Hilichurlian Linguistics specializing in "applied grammar for vernacular Hilichurlian."<ref name="ella musk" />

Materials on the language of the hilichurls are scarce and most are written by the same small group of scholars — Jacob Musk and Ella Musk. Additionally, as both were based in Mondstadt, much of their research has been only on the hilichurl tribes local to the region. Their attempts to understand Hilichulian language and customs has had mixed results. Ella Musk admits that without more field work, she is uncertain of the meaning behind several words.<ref name="ella musk" /> During Ella Musk's commissions, [[Traveler|the Traveler]] attempts to speak Hilichurlian with varying degrees of success depending on the player's choices. If the player selects the correct words, the hilichurls respond with dancing. If an incorrect word is selected, they grow aggressive leading immediately to a fight.<ref name="language exchange">{{Quest|Language Exchange}}</ref><ref name="poetry exchange">{{Quest|Poetry Exchange}}</ref> Before [[Mika]] joined the [[Knights of Favonius]] as a cartographer, he went with Ella Musk on one of her "language exchange" trips to get some expedition practice. While conversing with a hilichurl, Ella Musk made a mistake which ended in both of them getting beat up.<ref name="mika">{{Ref/CS|Mika|Character Story 2}}</ref>

[[Kaeya]] and [[Venti]] have been observed to hold some level of proficiency in Hilichulian, but it is unknown how or when they studied the language.<ref name="windblume">{{Quest|Missive of Cloud and Fog}}</ref> Venti claims to have learned it to help with his songwriting, but states he hasn't actually written any ballads in Hilichurlian.<ref name="Venti">{{Ref/VO|Venti|Something to Share}}</ref> The Traveler also exercises their Hilichurlian during ''[[Lionfang's Legacy|Lionfang's Legacy,]]'' the third part of Venti's Story Quest [[Carmen Dei Chapter]]: Act I - ''[[Should You Be Trapped in a Windless Land]].''

Hilichurls "across the continent" have been observed singing.<ref name="hili ballads" />

Abyss mages can speak Hilichurlian.  

===Translation===
Real world attempts to decipher the language of the Hilichurls have been made using a combination of sources including the official [[manga]], books such as [[Hilichurl Ballad Selection]], [[Hilichurl Cultural Customs]], and Ella Musk's commissions. Hilichurlian is the most understood distinct language of Teyvat. Unlike most other languages in Teyvat, which are real life languages such as English and Latin written with a custom alphabet, Hilichurlian is a {{w|constructed language}} and is therefore linguistically distinct, with distinct phonology, words, phrases, and grammar.

A key part of understanding the language comes from the second episode of the official Chinese livestream "Mondstadt Tea Party," which gives two translated phrases: ''Mosi mita'' and ''Mosi gusha'', which literally mean "eat meat" and "eat vegetables" respectively, and are used figuratively as expressions of happiness and sadness, respectively.<ref>Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/jyrzts/hilichurl_language_research_translation_from_cn/ Hilichurl Language Research] (Translation from CN)</ref><ref>NGA: [https://ngabbs.com/read.php?tid=23771103 本丘学家宣布已经基本破译了丘丘人语，并发现了丘丘人的神灵乌努]</ref>

A major source of information on Hilichurlian is the [[Handy Handbook of Hilichurlian]] (HHH), written by Ella Musk's grandfather. The HHH can be treated as generally correct as the Traveler will not run into issues when using the HHH as a guide. However, it may have dubious accuracy when it comes to the exact nuances of Hilichurlian due to Ella's own errors in the language as well as any errors in understanding that the original author had.

Hilichurlian is observed to have high allophonic variation. Some speakers may pronounce the graphemes ⟨a⟩ and ⟨e⟩ as both /æ/. Voiced consonants may sometimes be pronounced with tenuis consonants instead.

The mid central vowel, /ə/, although present in Hilichurlian, is not very common. It only appears as the rendition of the grapheme ⟨o⟩ in special cases. ⟨o⟩ is normally pronounced as /ʌ/. For example, the word ''movo'' is pronounced with /ə/ in the first ⟨o⟩ and the regular reading of /ʌ/ in the second ⟨o⟩.

|[[File:vo eqxs003 3 hilichurls 02.ogg]]
|}

Hilichurlian does not appear to have diphthongs. In words where vowels are adjacent to each other, such as ''biadam'', hiatus is employed instead and ⟨bi⟩ and ⟨a⟩ are considered separate morae.

==Morphosyntactic Alignment==
Hilichurlian is generally an '''ergative-absolutive''' language, however it does not purely abide by the rules of ergative-absolutive morphosyntactic alignment.

One main example is the interrogative mood of a transitive verb; in a classical ergative-absolutive language, the agent of a transitive verb is always the ergative, and never the absolutive. However, in Hilichurlian, when a transitive verb takes the interrogative ''dala'' as the object, the agent must be marked in absolutive case. For example, ''ye muhe dala?'' instead of ''yo muhe dala?''

The following table lists ergative-absolutive pairs.

|-
|First-person plural
|mimi

|-
|Second-person
|yo
|ye
|-
|Second-person plural
|yoyo
|yeye
|}

==Orthography==
Hilichurlian is written with the Latin alphabet, however it is unclear if the Hilichurls write Hilichurlian themselves or if the orthography was simply developed by humans such as [[Jacob Musk]] to transcribe the sounds of Hilichurlian.

Hilichurlian is observed to not use the letters ''f'', ''j'', ''q'', and ''x''. Therefore, the Hilichurlian alphabet contains 22 letters: 5 vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and 17 consonants.

</div></center>

==Pluralization==
In Hilichurlian, nouns and pronouns are abstractly pluralized through reduplication. The first-person singular pronoun ''mi'' is reduplicated to become the first-person plural pronoun ''mimi''.

==Verbs==
In Hilichurlian, verbs are not inflectionally distinguished from nouns or adjectives. A verb as a headword can be used as a noun and adjective too in some cases. They do not inflect or conjugate, but have some main constructions.

Hilichurlian is a subject-verb-object (SVO) language, like English and Chinese. The direct object is placed directly after the verb, and the subject precedes the verb.

Hilichurlian does not have definite or indefinite articles, much like Chinese or Japanese.

Hilichurlian has '''9 grammatical moods''' in a total of '''2 grammatical mood categories''':
*'''Realis''' (<span style="font-variant:small-caps">'''real'''</span>)
*# '''Declarative''' (<span style="font-variant:small-caps">'''decl'''</span>). This mood is used to declare that something is the case.
*#'''Negative''' (<span style="font-variant:small-caps">'''neg'''</span>). This mood is used to encode negative (non-affirmative) polarity into an utterance.
*#'''Immediate''' (<span style="font-variant:small-caps">'''imm'''</span>). This mood is used to signify that a verb is being performed in the immediate present.
*#'''Emphatic''' (<span style="font-variant:small-caps">'''emp'''</span>). This mood is used to stress and emphasize a verb.
*'''Irrealis''' (<span style="font-variant:small-caps">'''irr'''</span>)
**'''Deotonic''' (<span style="font-variant:small-caps">'''deo'''</span>)
**#'''Imperative''' (<span style="font-variant:small-caps">'''imp'''</span>). This mood is used to directly issue commands to a second party listener.
**#'''Optative''' (<span style="font-variant:small-caps">'''opt'''</span>). This mood is used to indicate a wish or hope to either the speaker themselves or a second party.
**#'''Desiderative''' (<span style="font-variant:small-caps">'''desi'''</span>). This mood is used to indicate a speaker's desire.
**# '''Jussive''' (<span style="font-variant:small-caps">'''jus'''</span>). This mood is used to issue commands to a third party.
** '''Epistemic''' (<span style="font-variant:small-caps">'''epi'''</span>)
**#'''Interrogative''' (<span style="font-variant:small-caps">'''int'''</span>). This mood is used to obtain information from a second party listener.

==Trivia==
*Based on the proposed translations, [[Ella Musk]] sometimes says something completely different from what she intends to, especially in dialogue lines available since before the event [[Mimi Tomo]].
*Some of the translations of Hilichurlian were based on the Chinese equivalents provided during an official voice actor livestream.<ref name="mondstadt tea party">Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1o5411j7hR {{zh|《原神》声优小剧场&mdash;&mdash;「蒙德茶会」第二期}}] (Timestamp: 6m 30s - 8m 30s)</ref>

*In the official voice actor livestream, Jean's voice actor says that their information comes from Ella Musk, who also approves of their plans to give Hilichurlian lessons.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/jd_-5k8IaJo?t=363 Mondstadt Tea Party 2] (Timestamp: 6m 3s - 6m 15s)</ref> It's unlikely that this interaction is canon since Jean's voice actor says this as herself, the voice actor in real life. However, it is still noteworthy that the information is presented as information from Ella Musk rather than from anyone in real life who worked on Hilichurlian.
*Non-Hilichurl characters who are known to, claim to, or are implied to know at least some Hilichurlian:
**[[Jacob Musk]], the author of the current major reference materials on Hilichurls and Hilichurlian, including [[Hilichurl Ballad Selection]] and [[Hilichurl Cultural Customs]]
