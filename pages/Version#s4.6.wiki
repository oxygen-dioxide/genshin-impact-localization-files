For Travelers who have already completed the corresponding World Quests before the version update, the corresponding avatars will be automatically unlocked after the version update.)
* [[Fountain of Lucine]]: Increase in the Level Cap of Fountain of Lucine to Level 50. After the Fountain of Lucine reaches its maximum level, [[Hydro Sigil]]s can be exchanged with [[Mequignon]] at [[Bertin's House of Curiosities]].
* Adds the "Focused Experience Mode" function: 
*# This function can be enabled for certain quests in the "[[Quest]]" menu. Once enabled, Travelers can prevent locations and characters involved in said quest from being occupied by other quests, which improves the experience of the current quest.
*# Function Access Unlock Criteria: Complete [[Archon Quest]] [[Prologue]]: Act III "[[Song of the Dragon and Freedom]]"
*# In Version 4.6, the "Focused Experience Mode" function will be available for Arlecchino's Story Quest - Ignis Purgatorius Chapter: Act I "When the Hearth-Flame Goes Out." The "Focused Experience Mode" function will gradually be made available for more quests in subsequent versions.

* Starting from the first time that the Lunar Phase refreshes after updating to Version 4.6, the three Lunar Phases will be as follows:
** Phase I: Flame-Fanning Moon

** Phase II: Valorous Moon
*** When a character receives healing, the character's ATK increases by 50% for 3s.
** Phase III: Tactical Moon
*** When a character's HP value increases or decreases, that character gains a 16% increased All Elemental and Physical DMG Bonus for 8s. This effect can stack up to 3 times, and the duration of each stack is counted independently.

==Adjustments & Optimizations==
;Exploration
* On the [[Tutorial]]s screen, adventure tutorials related to the current area will be displayed nearer to the top.
* Optimizes the performance of the [[Treasure Compass]] feature: Nearby treasure [[chest]]s will now be marked on the map after using the Treasure Compass, and opening treasure chests marked out on the map during the Treasure Compass's cooldown time will reset its cooldown.

;Map
* Combines the "[[Domain]]s only" and "[[Genius Invokation TCG|Search for Players]]" options under the "Map Settings" button on the [[map]] interface.
* Adds the "Custom Markers," "Controller > Cursor Sensitivity," and "Controller > Marker Sensitivity Range" settings under the "Map Settings" button on the map interface.
* Optimizes the design of the buttons for switching between different [[region]]s on the map interface.

;Quests

* When you are navigating to a quest objective, an icon for important quest items related to the current quest will now be displayed within the [[Inventory]].
* Updates the icon for [[Request]]s in the Quest Menu.

;Adventurer Handbook
* Adjusts the criteria for unlocking different chapters in "[[Adventurer Handbook]] > Experience": Simply reach a certain [[Adventure Rank]] to unlock the next chapter. You no longer need to complete the previous chapter.
* Adds missions for enhancing [[Prototype Rancour]] and [[Favonius Warbow]] to Lv. 60 in "Adventurer Handbook > Embattle."
* Adds missions related to enhancing [[Artifact]]s in "Adventurer Handbook > Embattle."

;Serenitea Pot
* Adds the "Quick Obtain" function on the [[Replica]] > Preview screen as well as the [[Furnishing Set]] screen in Editing Mode: You can use this function to quickly purchase the [[Furnishing]]s/[[Furnishing Blueprint]]s that you need from the Realm Depot, or add the Furnishings that need to be created to the "Queued List."
* Adds the "Queued List" function on the Create Furnishing > Creation Queue screen. This will record your Furnishing creation requests from using "Quick Obtain" and tell you which materials they require. It can also be used to quickly add Furnishings that are waiting to be made to the Creation Queue.
* Adds the "Obtain All" function on the Create Furnishing > Creation Queue screen. You can use this function to obtain all the Furnishings created in one go. After you click it, you can also choose to use [[Vials of Adeptal Speed]] to speed up production of all Furnishings that haven't been completed yet with a single click.
* Adjusts the upper limit of the Creation Queue in Create Furnishing from 5 to 10.
* Adds Filter and Search functions to the Furnishings and Furnishing Blueprints tabs of the [[Realm Depot]].
* Displays category-related information in the text descriptions for Furnishings and Furnishing Blueprints.
* Optimizes the layout of the [[Realm Music]] screen, adding serial numbers and no longer showing a second confirmation pop-up when unlocking tracks.
* After [[Trust Rank]] reaches Level 10, the purchase limit of all products in Realm Depot > Furnishings (except Vial of Adeptal Speed) will be raised from 6 to 20.
* Furnishings and Furnishing Blueprints introduced from [[Version 1.5]] to [[2.8]] will be permanently sold at a discount in the Realm Depot.

;Genius Invokation TCG
* Updates the icon of the Event Card "[[Falls and Fortune]]."
* Optimizes the text description for the Normal Attack of the Character Card "[[Neuvillette (Character Card)|Neuvillette]]" (the actual effect remains the same).

;Other
* Optimizes the "compiling shaders" loading time when logging in on an Android device for the first time after version update.
* Adds support for displaying [[friend]] nicknames on the [[Serenitea Pot]] > Create Furnishing > Guest Assistance screen, as well as on various screens related to [[Co-Op Mode]].
* Adjusts the position of the stone pillars on Floors 11 and 12 of the [[Spiral Abyss]]: Now, the stone pillars will be placed outside the barrier.
* After the version update, on some PC devices that use integrated graphics cards, the default "Graphics > Graphics Quality" setting will be adjusted to "Lowest" (only the correspondence between the options and the default values is changed, the actual settings remain unchanged).
* Due to the addition of new regions and [[Teleport Waypoint]]s, the number of Teleport Waypoints required to unlock the achievement "[[Forest Roamer]]" has been adjusted. The original total number of Teleport Waypoints that needed to be unlocked was 46, and this has now been adjusted to 47 (if the achievement has been completed, the completion status of the achievement remains unchanged).
* Increases the [[Inventory]]'s capacity for the [[Weapon Enhancement Material]]s "[[Mystic Enhancement Ore]]," "[[Fine Enhancement Ore]]," and "[[Enhancement Ore]]" from 9,999 to 99,999.

;Genius Invokation TCG Balance Adjustment
* Adjusts the effect of the status "Fiery Rebirth" of the Character Card "[[Abyss Lector: Fathomless Flames (Character Card)|Abyss Lector: Fathomless Flames]]": "When the character to which this is attached would be defeated: Remove this effect, ensure the character will not be defeated, and heal them to 4 HP. After this effect is triggered, this character deals +1 Pyro DMG."
* Adjusts the effect of "Aegis of Abyssal Flame" applied by the Talent Card "Embers Rekindled" of the Character Card "Abyss Lector: Fathomless Flames": "Provide 2 Shield points to the character to which this card is attached. After said Shield points are depleted: Deal 1 Piercing DMG to all opposing characters."
* Adjusts the casting logic of the Elemental Skills of the Character Cards "[[Candace (Character Card)|Candace]]" and "[[Beidou (Character Card)|Beidou]]": After the adjustment, the character that cast the Elemental Skill gains a shield and then prepares the skill (i.e. generating the shield and preparing the skill are split into two separate actions, so that if the shield is removed by certain effects, this will not result in the skill's preparation being canceled too).
* Adjusts the effect of the Support Card "[[Yayoi Nanatsuki (Support Card)|Yayoi Nanatsuki]]": "For each of your characters already equipped with an Artifact on the field, you spend 1 less Elemental Die (once per Round)." has been adjusted to "If two of your characters on the field already have an equipped Artifact, you additionally spend 1 less Elemental Die (once per Round)."
* Adjusts the trigger condition for the effect of the Support Card "[[Seed Dispensary (Support Card)|Seed Dispensary]]": The trigger condition "When you play an Equipment or Support Card with an original cost of 1 Elemental Die: ..." has been adjusted to "When you play a Support Card with an original cost of at least 2 Elemental Dice: ..."
* Adjusts the number of Elemental Dice required and effect of the Support Card "[[Jeht (Support Card)|Jeht]]": The Elemental Dice cost required has been adjusted from 2 Dice of any element to 1. The effect "If this card has recorded at least 5 Sophistication points, discard this card and generate Omni Element equal to the number of Sophistication points minus 2." has been adjusted to "If this card has recorded at least 6 Sophistication points, discard this card and attach Sand and Dreams to your active character." (The effect of "Sand and Dreams" is: "When you play a Talent card or a Character uses a Skill: Spend 3 less Elemental Dice.")
* Note: The effect of the Event Card "[[Nature and Wisdom]]" will not result in the deck being shuffled. All "draw a random card of any certain type from your deck" effects will also not result in the deck being shuffled, but instead will result in 1 random card of the corresponding type being drawn and added to your hand.

==Bug Fixes==
;Character
* Fixes an issue whereby, when certain [[Polearm]]-wielding characters performed [[Plunging Attack]]s, the position of the attack's special effect would be abnormal in certain situations (the actual DMG AoE works as intended).
* Fixes an issue whereby after [[Xianyun]]'s [[Aloof From the World|second Constellation]] was unlocked, the special effect on the tails of her outfit would abnormally disappear under certain circumstances.

;System
* Fixes an issue whereby there were errors with certain key names on the [[Settings]] > Key Bindings screen when playing on a PC in German or French.
* Fixes an issue whereby, after switching a character's [[outfit]] from the "[[Party Setup]]" menu, the corresponding character could not be switched to and deployed in certain situations.
* Fixes an issue whereby, when challenging the [[Millennial Pearl Seahorse]], the game camera couldn't be restored to the original angle after zooming out in certain situations.

;Genius Invokation TCG
* Fixes an issue whereby when "Fontemer Pearl" was attached to the Character Card "[[Millennial Pearl Seahorse (Character Card)|Millennial Pearl Seahorse]]," casting its [[Swirling School of Fish|Elemental Skill]] would abnormally reset the Fontemer Pearl's once-per-round effect ("Usage(s) will not be used when negating DMG from Summons").

;Audio
* Fixes an issue whereby there was a chance that the effect of [[Freminet]]'s skill voice line would be abnormal in certain situations.
* Fixes an issue whereby, when [[Chiori]] used her Elemental Skill to enter combat, there was a chance that the Elemental Skill sound effect would be abnormal.

;Other
* Fixes an issue whereby there was a small probability that the model of the currently controlled character would disappear abnormally under certain circumstances when playing through [[Checks & Cats|Lynette's Hangout Event]] on mobile devices.
* Fixes an issue whereby if a character unequipped and then re-equipped the weapon "[[Amenoma Kageuchi]]," after triggering the weapon's effect to obtain Succession Seeds, Succession Seeds' duration would be abnormal under certain circumstances.
* Fixes an issue whereby some buildings in [[Mondstadt]] were overlapping abnormally, which was preventing characters from climbing upwards.
* Fixes some text errors in certain languages and optimizes text. (Note: Related in-game functions have not changed. Travelers can view the changes in different languages by going to the Paimon Menu > Settings > Language and changing the Game Language.)<br>Text-related fixes and optimizations in English include:
** Optimizes certain English translations.

==Known Issues==
# There is an issue whereby there is a small probability that [[Arlecchino]]'s "Masque of the Red Death" state will have an abnormal effect on her Normal Attack DMG increase. This issue will be fixed in a future update. Please stay tuned for future notices.
# Other than the updates and fixes on April 26, there is still an issue whereby there is a small probability that [["All Reprisals and Arrears, Mine to Bear..."|C1 Arlecchino]]'s interruption resistance increase would be abnormal when she performs Normal or Charged Attacks while affected by the Masque of the Red Death under specific circumstances. The developers will implement a fix to this issue again in subsequent versions.
