|vo_01_01_tx         = Um... Hi! I'm Varesa from the [[Collective of Plenty]]! I'm a warrior, and I also manage an orchard... If you're into food, or if you wanna buy fresh fruit by the cartload, or... or if you like hero stories, then we should definitely hang out! I'll show you all the good food around here, give you the best-quality fruit in our whole tribe, and tell you all the coolest stories about the biggest heroes in history!

|vo_02_01_tx         = My parents always say, no matter how busy life gets, you should always sit down and enjoy a proper meal when you get hungry. What I like to do is stack my plate up high, then squash it all down, take a deep breath, and wolf it down in one go. That way, I get to eat my fill without wasting too much time!

|vo_04_04_tx         = Ahh... I haven't used up much energy today, but it's so late that I'm getting kinda sleepy... Why don't you find yourself a nice, soft pillow, and we'll call it a night? The best pillows are those ones made from dried Grainfruit leaves... Remind me to... make one for you... some time... zzz...

|vo_05_01_tx         = Theoretically speaking, the more you eat, the stronger you get &mdash; assuming you're also training hard and not just sitting around eating all day. But that rule seems kinda reversed in my case... I started out super strong, with the tradeoff being that I can never seem to get full. As soon as I started helping my parents out in the orchard, I'd be getting dizzy with hunger every few hours... So yeah, that's why I have to eat such huge portions, even if it might look a little, uh... over the top...

|vo_05_02_tx         = I've always loved hearing the tales of our heroes, ever since I was little. It's thanks to the battles they fought that I get to eat delicious food and sleep peacefully at night. One of the heroes from our tribe was called Fietena. She could run really fast, and had this awesome flying kick that could split mountains in two! Someone once said that my fighting style reminded them of her. That made me so happy, I was beaming with joy for the longest time...

|vo_06_01_tx         = My friends have told me all about your amazing past! You've defeated a ton of super strong enemies, and ended up with loads of cool-sounding titles! I think we should get one of those graffiti artists to make an artbook of you in different styles, with an epically cool look to match each title you have! Then, loads of kids will grow up reading stories about you, and they'll be inspired to become someone epic just like you!

|vo_06_02_tx         = Now, you are "Tumaini," the pride of all [[Natlan]], and the greatest hero of our age. It feels kind of surreal... but when I'm with you, I don't feel nervous at all, and I don't get that sense of... intimidation, you know what I mean? Like, I'm down here, and you're up there. I dunno, maybe it's because you're always so easygoing and sincere with me? Anyway, I just want to stay by your side, and offer you my strength whenever you need it. Like the warriors of old, who fought side-by-side with the heroes who made history!

|vo_07_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About the Vision.ogg
|vo_07_01_tx         = From the way that the woven scrolls describe it, a Vision appears at a pivotal moment in your life and slowly descends into your hand, glowing with a brilliant light that seems to say "This has been ordained by Fate"... But I guess I must have forgotten all of that stuff, because all I remember is... I was having this awful nightmare, where I was fighting off monsters at the entrance to my tribe for what felt like an eternity, and I nearly died... Then, when I woke up, there was a Vision just lying on my forehead. Maybe I was... blessed by a hero in my dream, or something?

|vo_07_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} Something to Share.ogg
|vo_07_02_tx         = I made this mask for myself, after visiting the [[Children of Echoes]] a few times and getting some of their craftspeople to teach me a few things. My intuition told me to base it on the mask that Fietena wore on her second time fighting in the [[Night Warden Wars]]. She wasn't yet "The Fearless Rock" that she'd go on to become, but in that battle she still managed to conquer her fears and defeat all the monsters who confronted her. I believed that that mask could become an endless source of courage for me, and based on my experience since, I was right!

|vo_07_03_tx         = I've heard that members of the [[Adventurers' Guild]] get to travel all over [[Teyvat]]. Imagine that... So instead of worrying about the business, or the shelf life of fresh fruit, or being confined to one place all the time, I could go anywhere in the world that I want, and try all of the food there? Hmm... But I can't be gone for too long, because I'll always need to help out at the orchard once in a while... Um, do you know if the guild takes part-time adventurers?

|vo_08_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Iansan - Coach and Commander.ogg
|vo_08_01_tx         = Iansan is my coach. I look up to her the most out of anyone! She helped me discover my true strength, taught me how to fight, and even got me a job in our tribe's [[Patrol Team]]. She's pretty well respected in the patrol team, so most of the time she gives me my orders, and I go join the fighting wherever I'm needed. I guess that makes her both my coach and my commander, too!
|vo_08_01_mention    = Iansan

|vo_08_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Iansan - Continued Training.ogg
|vo_08_02_tx         = Coach Iansan says that even though most of the monsters out there are a piece of cake for me now, I've still got a long way to go, because the most formidable foes are the ones that take a whole team of heroes working together as one. I'm making sure to follow her training plan every day, it's just... controlling my diet is part of the plan, so I can't really eat deep-fried food or anything full of cream and sugar when she's watching. She says that stuff's unhealthy, but it tastes so good, and I get cravings... So sometimes, when I can't resist it anymore, I go to my secret campsite for a snacking session... If you and I ever go for a big feast together, please make sure you keep it a secret!
|vo_08_02_mention    = Iansan

|vo_08_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Mavuika.ogg
|vo_08_03_tx         = I heard that the plates Mavuika uses on her barbell lifts are five times the weight of her flamestrider! And that she uses ten plates minimum just as a warmup... I also heard a rumor that she can lift a boulder the size of a [[Long-Necked Rhino]] with just two fingers! If anyone else was crazy strong like that, I'm sure I'd be too self-conscious to lift weights in front of them. But with Mavuika, it's different... I find the sound of her voice so reassuring, and the look in her eyes is so inspiring and encouraging. It makes me want to push myself as hard as I possibly can every single day. Sure, I may never catch up to her, but that's no excuse to give up. I'm gonna believe in myself, and be the best Varesa I can be!
|vo_08_03_mention    = Mavuika

|vo_08_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Mualani.ogg
|vo_08_04_tx         = There was this time when Coach Iansan noticed I'd overshot my target weight, and decided I needed a cutting phase. Since swimming's supposed to be good for fat-burning, she arranged for me to do an intensive program over at the [[People of the Springs]] territory. I'd be there swimming lengths, while Mualani was surfing around and towing Coach Iansan in a life preserver, so she could monitor my progress... Every day, she made me do pretty much the same distance as I do in my 30 thousand-step shuttle runs... *shudder*... Thank goodness Mualani was secretly slipping me some candy to keep my energy up. Otherwise, I don't know how I would have survived... I'm so grateful to her...

|vo_08_05_tx         = I haven't entered the [[Pilgrimage]] that many times, but once, I came up against Kinich during the group stage. That guy is so nimble... He was just dodging all of my moves until I completely exhausted myself, then he knocked me out cold with one hit... By the time I realized that maybe I should get my teammates to help me pin him down... he and the [[Sacred Flame]] were long gone.
|vo_08_05_mention    = Kinich

|vo_08_06_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Xilonen.ogg
|vo_08_06_tx         = When I was learning my crafting skills from the Children of Echoes, [[Muhuru's Gemporium]] is where I went to study. The craftspeople there talked about Xilonen all the time! I actually only saw her around once or twice, and I never got the chance to talk to her &mdash; but boy, did I get familiar with her music taste! She put together the playlist they have on in the shop, and all the tracks are super catchy. Really good beats &mdash; perfect for running, too. I swear, I can go for way longer on my shuttle runs when that stuff's playing!
|vo_08_06_mention    = Xilonen

|vo_08_07_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Citlali.ogg
|vo_08_07_tx         = Oh, I've seen her name in the readers' letters column of some comic books. Granny Itztli is extremely well respected &mdash; she's the most powerful hero from the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]]! But I gotta say, I always assumed she'd look way older... I didn't recognize her at all when I found her in the tavern in a drunken stupor. She didn't have a single [[Mora]] on her and she was mumbling to herself, but the only words I could make out were "Masters of the Night-Wind." So, I paid her bill, threw her over my shoulder, carried her over to the Masters of the Night-Wind, and started asking around for "Granny Itztli." But whenever people turned to look at this person slumped over my shoulder, a look of horror would creep over their face... And then it slowly started to dawn on me that something wasn't quite right...

|vo_08_08_tx         = Oh... Isn't she that... big boss lady who's surprisingly small... but still has infinitely deep pockets? Oof... she's a fierce haggler... Every time she comes to buy fruit from us, she manages to slash at least thirty to forty percent off the selling price, and that's on a good day! On the plus side, though, at least she buys huge amounts &mdash; multiple cartloads at a time. And she lets me pet her [[Shaggy Sumpter Beast]]. It's so fluffy, and such a big cutie...

|vo_08_09_tx         = Miss Escoffier has really strict standards... Every time her restaurant places a bulk order for my fruit, she picks out a few for... what's it called... yeah, "sample analysis." If the sweetness or flavor is even slightly off, she rejects the whole batch... But then again, her cooking? Out of this world. Sooo delicious... Hehehe... If only I could eat it every day! I guess I'd probably have to be a god to afford that.

They build the comfortable houses we live in, the nice furniture we use, all the delicious food we eat, and they make the amazing music and all the other fun stuff we enjoy... Even if I miscalculate the price when I'm selling fruit, my customers are usually kind enough to let me know rather than take advantage of it. At least, I've never met anyone terrible enough to make me really dislike them. Monsters, on the other hand... I don't know what their deal is, but they're the only ones I get seriously angry at... Especially the ones from the [[Abyss]]! They're cunning, and terrifying, and just all-round awful!

All my parents and I could do was hide away in a well-hidden cellar and barricade the door. I still remember the sound of the monsters trying to ram the door down... I was so scared, I didn't even dare to cry out loud... Thankfully, the Patrol Team got to us in time and saved us, but it got me thinking &mdash; even if the heroes of the past were immortal, there'd only be so much they could do. They couldn't be everywhere at once, and protect everyone and everything. But maybe, if I trained hard enough and learned how to fight, maybe next time instead of waiting to be rescued, I'd be strong enough to fight off the bad guys myself.

I told myself: I just need to drive the bad guys away, and then I can go back to living my happy life! Then I'd put on my mask, close my eyes, imagine that I was a hero from the stories I'd read, and charge at them... I always managed to plow into them and send them flying, even though I couldn't see where I was going. One time, I knocked a [[hilichurl]]'s club right out of his hand, and it went flying off and hit Coach Iansan square on the head. That was how she first noticed me, and she decided that I had talent, and took me under her wing...

The thing is, I've only ever thought of monsters as my enemies, so the idea of fighting against the nice people from my tribe, even friends who I'd sold fruit to before... it terrified me. I didn't know how to control my strength &mdash; what if I hit someone too hard and injured them? ...Obviously, that mindset meant I never made it very far in the competition. After a string of losses, I said I was too scared to try again... and by that point, people had stopped encouraging me to participate anyway.

And if I want to conquer that, I have to learn how to control my strength and fine-tune every movement, with the same care and attention as when I'm weighing fruit on a scale. Only then will I be able to fight with intent and precision... and fight as myself. Um, since we're on the topic... I mean, you have god-tier strength, but you seem to have it completely under control. Whatever the situation, you always use just the right amount of force &mdash; no less and no more than necessary. So... You're my hero. Can you teach me how to do what you do?

The birthday person gets to cheers everyone and drink as much as they want! Although... with you being so famous, I guess you'd end up having to down at least a thousand drinks... Which would be great fun, I'm sure, but probably not the best thing for your liver. And it could get exhausting, too... Hmm, how about something more low-key instead? Like... a private party at my secret campsite?
