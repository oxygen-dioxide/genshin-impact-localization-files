==Text==
[[File:Liam's Ballad Map.png|300px]]

[[Liam]] once wore bright clothes and laughed happily.<br>
Liam once wrote songs without fear of taboos and mocked the hypocrites.<br>
Liam will no longer sing out loud or act so proud.<br>
But Liam will not stoop to beg.<br>
And Liam will not bend or compromise.<br>
Liam and his music will travel far and fly high.<br>
And in a vast and empty land, Liam will continue to sing.

If you have heard this song, friend, will you, too, never give up?<br>
If you share those ideals, {{color|buzzword|please retrieve Liam's pride}},<br>
And he shall reward you.
