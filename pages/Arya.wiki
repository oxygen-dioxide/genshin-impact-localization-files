==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Arya:''' Hmph!
:{{DIcon}} Who made you so upset?
::'''Arya:''' [[Jayant|He]] idles days and days away, making all kinds of excuses for himself.
::'''Arya:''' We grew up together, so I know him very well.
::'''Arya:''' If you see someone who talks about "fated encounters" don't trust him!
::'''Arya:''' He's a real sweet talker, but all he's actually capable of is dilly-dallying on the street.
::'''Arya:''' I hope my [[Zai|little brother]] won't follow his example and turn out to be a layabout like him...
::{{DIcon}} Your little brother...
::'''Arya:''' Yeah, I have a young brother. He should be out playing with his friends at the moment.
::'''Arya:''' He has taken a great interest in Sumpter Beasts recently for some reason.
::'''Arya:''' His friend's family seems to have Sumpter Beasts at home, and he goes there at every opportunity.
::'''Arya:''' Every time a merchant delivered something to our house, he would fix his eyes on the Sumpter Beast carrying the goods.
::'''Arya:''' Well... I suppose it's not bad for him to learn about merchants' job in his early age. When he grows up, he can help with the family business.
:{{DIcon}} See you later.
::'''Arya:''' See you.
