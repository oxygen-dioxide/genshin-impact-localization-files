'''Triangular Mechanisms''' are an exploration mechanic found in [[Enkanomiya]]. 

Within a certain distance, attacks can be used to activate them, causing them to release a pulse of Whitenight or Evernight energy. These mechanisms will reset after a while. Intact mechanism can be used during [[Whitenight]], and broken mechanisms can be used during [[Evernight]] (or while carrying the power of a [[Place of Essence Worship|Mooncrux]]).
