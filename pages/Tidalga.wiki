==Descriptions==
{{Description|An algae floating with the tides and feeding on substances produced by other plants. Thought often mistaken for zooplankton, Tidalga falls under the category of phytoplankton by nature.<br>According to ancient records, philosophers of old once thought highly of Tidalga, calling it "the noblest life form in the mortal world," for it is "an animal of free will that feeds not on lives." Such praises later passed into oblivion with the advancement of biology.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* In the overworld, Tidalga come in two different colors - blue and purple. However, the two variants are treated as the same item once picked and put into the inventory.
** In the day 5 objective of the [[Graph Adversarial Technology Experiment Log]] event, only the purple variant will be registered, as per the requirement noted.
*Tidalga are apparently considered a food source by Melusines.
