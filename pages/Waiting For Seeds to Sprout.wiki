{{Quest Description|Your Saurian buddy digs up a strange seed...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the area with the holes)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, {{Little One}}, where are you off to?

;(Investigate the first hole)
:'''Paimon:''' What are you digging for? ...Hmm, doesn't look like there's anything here...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Umm...

;(Investigate the second hole)
:'''Paimon:''' Helllloooo, is there anyone down there? ...Ahem, though if there are monsters, feel free to ignore us...

;(Investigate the third hole)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow! You've actually managed to dig something up?
----
:'''Paimon:''' What's up, {{Little One}}? You were just digging about over there. Did you unearth something amazing?
:'''Paimon:''' Was it some sort of valuable treasure?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:[[File:Embercore Flower Seed.png|200px]]
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, let Paimon see... Is this some sorta seed? Huh. Didn't think we'd find something like that in this barren ground...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrrawr?
:'''Paimon:''' That said, this doesn't look all that valuable...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Roar...
:{{DIcon}} Seeds contain infinite possibilities...
:{{DIcon}} You never know, it might grow into something impressive!
:'''Paimon:''' Still, this place must have been abandoned for ages. The soil looks so hard, too... Could this seed really still be alive?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr...?
:'''Paimon:''' Are you upset? ... Well, sometimes it's hard to say &mdash; some seeds just won't sprout naturally...
:'''Paimon:''' But we could replant it and see what happens. Maybe it just hasn't sprouted yet? Maybe the hole wasn't well dug, or it didn't get enough nutrients.
:'''Paimon:''' So it might grow if we plant it properly! Hehe, what might grow from it? A giant [[Grainfruit]], maybe? Or... Y'know, a [[Cacahuatl]] with a super strong aroma might be awesome too!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:{{DIcon}} Or maybe a [[Whopperflower]]...
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, come on! Stop being a killjoy!
:'''Paimon:''' That said, what sort of nutrients do plants from Natlan need? ... Anyway, let's get this planted first!

;(Wait for {{Little One}} to dig the hole)
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, this depth should do it!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Let Paimon think... Hmm, if there was one way in which plants from Natlan might be different... It's gotta be Phlogiston! Maybe we can use that to fuel the seed? Let's give it a go!
----
;(Infuse the seed with Phlogiston)
:{{Black Screen|The seed infused with Phlogiston has attracted Phlogiston Aphids.}}
:'''Paimon:''' What on Teyvat's going on? Where did all these flying bugs suddenly come from? Is it because of the phlogiston from earlier?
:'''Paimon:''' Aaahh! We can't let them ruin the seed!

;(If the Phlogiston Aphid ruined the seed)
:'''Paimon:''' Agh, it looks like all the Phlogiston around the seed is gone... Guess we're gonna have to restock, huh?

;(After chasing away the Phlogiston Aphid)
:'''Paimon:''' Yay, all the flying bugs have been chased away! We successfully defended the seed!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, we just chased away those flying bugs... Why are there suddenly a ton of monsters too?
:'''Paimon:''' Are these monsters here to steal the phlogiston too?

;(After defeating the enemies)
:'''Paimon:''' Phew... Talk about tough going. If that had gone on much longer, this whole place would've been turned upside down...
----
;(After the cutscene)
:'''Paimon:''' C'mon out, little seed~
:'''Paimon:''' C'mon out, little flower~
:'''Paimon:''' ...Huh?
:{{DIcon}} Huh...
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, {{Traveler}}, the Phlogiston's energy has faded. It must've been absorbed by the seed, but... There was no reaction.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Errh?
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps it just needs time to grow.
::'''Paimon:''' You really think so? You might have a point...
::'''Paimon:''' [[Dandelion seed]]s go flying off like little umbrellas if you just blow lightly on 'em, [[Wolfhook]]s attach themselves to little wolves, and run off with them to faraway places...
::'''Paimon:''' Seeds are tenacious little things!
:{{DIcon}} Maybe the seed's got stage fright...
::'''Paimon:''' R&mdash;Really? Hmm, yeah, maybe Paimon's just being too impatient...
::'''Paimon:''' The seed got dug up by {{Little One}}, had its nutrients stolen by flying insects, and was even disturbed by some monsters barging in...
::'''Paimon:''' That fight must've sounded like a horrible thunderstorm to a seed &mdash; guess it's only natural that it would hide in the soil, not daring to move.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, in that case, let's leave it alone for now &mdash; there'll be time to come back later!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
;(Quest completes)
----
;(Return to the quest area after one daily reset)
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, what a pretty flower...
:{{DIcon}} Why does that look familiar?
:{{DIcon}} Is that the seed {{Little One}} planted...?
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, that was the seed we infused with Phlogiston back then. Paimon didn't realize it was an [[Embercore Flower]] seed. No wonder it didn't sprout before! There simply wasn't enough Phlogiston in it.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' See, {{Little One}}, this is the flower you planted. The seed didn't die. If anything, it's blooming super nicely!
:{{DIcon}} I'm surprised it wasn't a Whopperflower...
:'''Paimon:''' Stop being so hung up about that...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr... Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, you're real happy, huh, {{Little One}}?
:'''Paimon:''' Now you'd better make sure to become a big, strong, awesome Saurian, just like this seed became a flower, alright?
