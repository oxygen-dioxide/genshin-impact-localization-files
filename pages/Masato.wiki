==Profile==
Masato is a merchant who was transporting goods when he was ambushed on [[Nazuchi Beach]]. The vagrants, far more aggressive than usual, expressed an intent to kill him, but a [[Takuya|blue oni]] prevented them from doing so, despite the vagrants insisting he would seek help. After some arguing, Masato escaped and made his way to the [[Watatsumi Army]] camp on Yashiori Island.

[[Arataki Itto]] later contacted Masato as he had seen the oni up close and he explained his ordeal to them.

===Personality===
Masato cares deeply for his family and pleaded with the vagrants to spare him in return for his goods, but when they refused, he became terrified. He was surprised when an oni voiced that he should be spared and fled to the Watatsumi Army camp on the island, intending to remain there for his own safety. Due to the incident, he became slightly on edge when near [[oni]], believing them to be all the same. He was also worried of those who would tackle the vagrants, believing them to be far too dangerous for anyone to handle.
