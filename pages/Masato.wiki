==Profile==
Masato is a merchant who was transporting goods when he was ambushed on [[Nazuchi Beach]]. The vagrants, far more aggressive than usual, expressed an intent to kill him, but a [[Takuya|blue oni]] prevented them from doing so, despite the vagrants insisting he would seek help. After some arguing, Masato escaped and made his way to the [[Watatsumi Army]] camp on Yashiori Island.

[[Arataki Itto]] later contacted Masato as he had seen the oni up close and he explained his ordeal to them.
