|description    = Stones of this sort may be found often throughout the rainforests of [[Sumeru]], their unique appearance the result of years of erosion due to humidity and the vibrations caused by [[Sumpter Beast]] activity wearing their exteriors away. The green moss on their surfaces may contain the favored food of certain birds, and so some hunters will lay ambushes near such stones, attempting to grab some easy fowl for themselves...
