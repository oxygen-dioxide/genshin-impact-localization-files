===Etymology===
* {{lang|"Seven transformations for [[kitsune]], eight transformations for [[tanuki]]"|ja=狐七化け、狸は八化け|ja_rm=Kitsune nana-bake, tanuki wa hachi-bake}} is a common belief in the Japanese folklore, which at the same time is used as an idiom meaning "There is no limit to excellence" or "Even the best person meets their match."
** "Seven transformations" can also refer to the seven common disguises of a ninja.
* In traditional Japanese theatrical performances, {{lang|''nanabake''|ja=七化け}} refers to a kabuki dance in which the dancer quickly changes his clothes seven times. The Japanese name of the constellation may be also a reference to the {{lang|Act of Kitsune's Seven Transformations|ja=狐七化けの段|ja_rm=Kitsune Nanabake no Dan}}, a famous act from a play of {{w|Bunraku}} (puppet theater), which features the legendary nine-tail fox {{w|Tamamo-no-Mae}}.
