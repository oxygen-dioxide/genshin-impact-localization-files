This interactable is located in the middle of the Submerged Ruins: Central Region underground area, and was written by [[Alain Guillotin]].

{{Dialogue Start}}
:...
:The assigned [[Carter Scherbius|assistant]] doesn't seem very reliable.
:At the moment, it doesn't look like the power sources of those [[Ruin Machine|war machines]] can be used. Their cores are far too dangerous.
:I'll get them to seek out other such mysterious machines.

:...
:No progress worth reporting today.
:Went out with [[Mary-Ann|Ann]] under the watchful eyes of my [[Emanuel Guillotin|adoptive father]] to look for inspiration at sites where battles took place. Ran into [[Rene de Petrichor|Rene]] and [[Jakob]].

:...
:The assistant doesn't seem reliable. Caused some accidents. Just another obstacle to overcome.
:This kind of machine with the seemingly arbitrary external form is quite interesting. Research will focus on their power source.

:...
:Researched primenergy machines.
:Assistant took the day off.
:Asked Ann for help.
:Recommended Rene and Jakob to the [[Dwight Lasker|director]] of the [[Institute of Natural Philosophy|Institute]].

:...
:Researched primenergy machines.
:Assistant took the day off.
:Asked Ann for help. Suggested she join the Institute, but she wasn't interested.

:...
:Researched primenergy machines.
:My assistant still isn't back. I'll go pay a visit.
:Found Rene and Jakob's [[Karl Ingold|adoptive father]] with my own adoptive father's help.

:...
:The supplementary primenergy machines have arrived.
:Should be able to make progress now.
:Assistant seems to be in good spirits. Probably just a minor illness.

:...
:Researched primenergy machines.
:Rene and Jakob joined the Institute. They've been assigned to my project.

:...
:Field research today.
:Interesting machine statue.

:...
:Researched primenergy machines.

:...
:Researched primenergy machines.
:My adoptive father visited, but I was too busy to host him.
:Ann scolded me. I'll remember to apologize next time I see him.

:...
:Researched primenergy machines.
:Assistant took the day off.

:...
:On the threshold of a major breakthrough.
:Assistant took the day off. I was too busy to visit. Ann scolded me. I'll go tomorrow.

:...
:On the threshold of a major breakthrough.
:Forgot about the visit, am sorry. Will invite everyone to go with me.

:...
:Took the day off. Went to visit.
:An idea: a virtual neural network based on a vast quantity of thinking units instead of logic trees.
:A [[Kamera]]?

:...
:Researched primenergy machines.
:Assistant took the day off.

:...
:Researched primenergy machines.
:Assistant took the day off.

:...
:Researched primenergy machines.
:Rene and Jakob went to begin conducting their own research today.
:Assistant took the day off.

:...
:A breakthrough.
:Patent application is too annoying. Forget it.
:Assistant's condition seems okay. Still a little worried.
:Considering the gap in medical technology, advised assistant to go to [[Sumeru]].

:...
:Took the day off.
:Researching machine kinematics next.
:Must make a materials list.

:...
:Visit.

:...
:Visit.

:...
:Visit.
:They said a bigger lab has been prepared for the kinematic experiments.
:But I've decided not to move for now.

:...
:Visit.

:...
:Visit.

:...
:Visit.
:Been urged to move the lab several times.
:But if the lab is moved, my assistant might not be able to find it. A pain.

:...
:Visit.

:...
:Visit.

:...
:Visit.
:Moved my lab.

===Ancient Log #2===
This interactable is located in the middle of the Submerged Ruins: Central Region underground area and was written by [[Alain Guillotin]]'s assistant, [[Carter Scherbius]]. It acts as a counterpart to the Ancient Log above.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:...
:...I was assigned to the same lab. I was nervous at first, since everyone said that [[Alain Guillotin|he]] was a child prodigy. Since the disaster, such people are even more precious.
:I thought that since he's a star of the [[Institute of Natural Philosophy|Institute]] and was recommended by higher-ups, he'd be full of himself, but he's much better than I expected. He's just not especially nice or anything...
:No obvious symptoms.

:...
:...I made a huge mistake, and knocked over an [[Primal Construct|ancient geometry machine]] that took a lot of effort to bring back from the [[Great Red Sand|desert ruins]]. But then the machine came to life, and messed everything up...
:...Though he's a lot younger than me, he's really smart. I can't believe that's how he managed to tame the machine. Maybe taming isn't the right word? Maybe the other engineers will look down on me for using it. But it really did feel like taming... I know the current clockwork machines pretty well, so I can tell the huge technological gulf between the two. Ignoring structure, if we can't solve the power source problems, then it'll be difficult to make any meaningful progress...
:But I still have to be careful. I've never seen Alain angry, and I don't want to find out what he looks like when he gets angry.
:A few minor symptoms have appeared.

:...
:Took the day off.

:...
:I can hardly believe it! Alain came to visit me, and even brought his [[Mary-Ann|sister]]! She's cute and not afraid of strangers. I'm so happy...
:...We discussed the idea of a thinking machine based on gems and tape circuits. I used the word "discussed," but actually I just said things like "Oh!" or "That's really amazing" or "How will you do that?" whenever he paused, and didn't make any real contributions. He was really into it, though, and he behaved very differently than he usually does in the lab. His little sister is probably way smarter than me, a research assistant!
:...I guess it isn't that boring when it flares up, but I want to return to the Institute to help as soon as I can...

:...
:...The additional machines got here. The previous ones are no longer usable since they were completely dismantled... But it did clear up a lot of things, at least according to him. Something about it being driven by the [[element]]s in the [[ley line]]s, but we can't recreate it with our current level of industrial precision and material science. I helped with compiling the report, but there's so much I couldn't understand!
:...Apparently, lots of people are secretly unhappy that Alain has more research resources than them... But if you ask me, everyone's smarter than me, and they should all get along, that way we can make the world a better place.
:...His sister said that some of their friends are joining the Institute. I'm looking forward to meeting them...
:No obvious symptoms.

:...
:...joined the lab as new partners! But now I'm even more confused by their conversations! Why is it I can understand every word on its own, but once they string them all together, I can't make heads or tails of it? [[Jakob]] is really the only one even close to being on the same level as me... I feel ashamed just writing that, as an adult looking for reassurance from a child as young as Jakob, I feel like I've lost all the self-respect an adult should have...
:...Based on their research on Primenergy Machinery (seems like they decided to adopt this name), Alain and [[Rene]] are thinking about trying to use the characteristics of [[ousia]] and [[pneuma]] to construct a new kinetic core...
:A few minor symptoms.

:...
:...I may have made a contribution! Well, maybe? I went on a picnic with Alain, his sister, Rene, and Jakob. It was technically supposed to be field research, but the idea came from Alain's sister and me. We thought they didn't have any life at all outside of their research, so we asked the Institute's [[Dwight Lasker|director]] to arrange something...
:...[[Petrichor]]'s quite boring, but the scenery is quite nice, since you can see the great waterfall. I brought a [[Kamera]] from the Institute to take photos for them. I hope there are more outings like this one in the future so I can take more photos of his sister especially. After all, Alain is always working and can't be with his sister as she grows up, so these photos will come in handy later when he regrets not spending much time with her. Then he'll be able to see how she was at different times, and it won't sting so much! If only my family had enough money for a Kamera and things didn't go wrong, I'm sure my mom would have taken lots of photos of me... Rene and Jakob like Alain's sister a lot, too. When the four of them hang out, she sometimes acts like an older sister to them, despite being the youngest, it's a really interesting dynamic...
:...Seems to be interested in the ruins and the stone statues here. Rene also mentioned something about a [[Golden Troupe (Faction)|troupe]] and seals... Even though we went out there to have a bit of fun for once, they were still thinking about research...
:No obvious symptoms.

:...
:Took the day off.

:...
:...Alain's sister came to see me with Jakob. Alain and Rene couldn't make it, because their experiment is at a critical stage. They didn't have to tell me any of that though, after all, with my limited abilities, that I was able to help at all is already fulfilling!

:...
:I heard that Alain and the Institute's director came to see me (separately)! while I was unconscious. I feel bad that they came all this way for nothing, I wasn't even awake... Still taking take off, but I hope to go back and help them again soon.

:...
:...I found out that they were graduates from the [[Narzissenkreuz Institute]], and that made me really happy. They talked about the [[Lyris|director]] and the [[Basil Elton|vice director]], as well as their adventures, and it made me feel like a kid again. The only detail that didn't make sense was the cake the vice director made, because it felt like punishment when we had it...
:...After the disaster, I lost contact with pretty much all my friends. I'm so happy that they were able to find each other again. I wonder how my friends are doing. They're probably trying to rebuild the Narzissenkreuz Institute! Next time I'll go check it out...
:...Talked about the thinking machine again. I had an idea about making a thinking Kamera, so that it would take photos of those precious to him while he's busy. He thought it was kind of pointless, but that it had security and surveillance applications...

:...
:...They did it! The light bulb came on! I was lucky to have recovered in time to witness this historical moment... It's quite a pity, but I hope Rene and Jakob will make the breakthroughs of their own in their own research topics! Ah, I also hope they get better assistants than me!
:No clear symptoms.

:...
:Took the day off.

:...
:There were several visits while I was unconscious. It's a shame, all I could do is read the letters they left behind. Jakob left me a note, inviting me to his and Rene's lab. There's something they want to talk to me about.
:I hope I can get out of bed soon.

:...
:Ann brought flowers for me, but they had already wilted by the time I woke up.
:Took the day off.

:...
:I was able to get out of bed today.
:This is where I first met Alain. For a time afterwards, my first time standing here I documented the experimental procedures and phenomena based on his oral descriptions. He was trying to start up the machinery below in an ill-fitting lab coat. Rene and Jakob later entered through that door, and Alain would temporarily forget to act the young genius, and rush towards them like an energetic kid.
:I found myself witness to the first successful controlled annihilation reaction. The brilliant light cast a deep, dark shadow and I believe history was made in that moment. Can someone like me, so excited I knocked over the ink bottle, play a role in such a historical event?
:Behind the locked door on the other side is Rene and Jakob's lab. It seems access was limited due to the dangerous nature of their research. They are destined to become towering figures in history.
:I guess Alain moved to another lab. Based on his plan, once the energy problems was solved, he would study kinematics. I'll go greet him later. I wonder how Ann is doing now? I wonder what kind of beautiful woman she will grow up to be?
:I'll stop writing here. I don't have much time left.
:I hope everything goes well.

===Ancient Log #3===
This interactable is located at the end of the rightmost hallway of the Submerged Ruins: Central Region underground area. Its author is unknown, although possibly an ancestor of [[Livre]] and [[Caron]]'s based on the author's ending remarks.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:...
:...Following [[Alain Guillotin|Guillotin]]'s instructions, the research went well... We've created a [[clockwork meka]] that can release energy. To be honest, we no longer need to call it a clockwork machine as it doesn't rely on elastic potential... It'll be compelling to see what results he achieves next in kinematics. There's no way old-fashioned clockwork meka can withstand such power output. Even young geniuses must stumble now and then...

:...
:...The thought of using this sort of unstable [[Arkhe|energy source]] is impressive. Though we have long observed these unique energies in Fontaine's atmosphere, water, and organisms, it has always been regarded as a latent threat, rather than a potential resource...

:...
:...Aren't there a few young geniuses too many nowadays? The [[Dwight Lasker|director]] is pleased, sure, but won't someone spare a thought for us ordinary people? I mean, not all of us are as simpleminded as [[Carter Scherbius|Scherbius]]...

:...
:...It received a very high rating. If the patent were to be granted, the potential financial gain would be considerable. However, I decided to decline the opportunity, because the machine was practically all Guillotin's work, and I can take no credit there. My family was quite angry about it, but as an engineer, one must have at least a little dignity and self-awareness...
:...Still making improvements, and output efficiency has increased...

:...
:...Seems to have been specially recruited. That's good. Had he continued that line of research, who knows what horrors he might have unleashed...

:...
:...At this stage, we have to pull out. The director says everyone will be given a position and research resources after reconstruction, but I'm afraid if it were me, I would use this as an excuse for a major shake-up. People like me won't get recalled anyway. Never mind. I've been pretty happy these past few days, I guess I'll consider it my retirement. I'll go to the [[Court of Fontaine|city]] and open a small workshop, repairing watches for folks, [[Kamera]]s too. Right, I'll see if I can make a waterproof clock. With the way things are going, I might make a killing in the future.

===Ancient Log #4===
This interactable is located in the last room of the Submerged Ruins: Central Region underground area, on a table to the right of the [[Ruin Grader]].

{{Dialogue Start}}
:...
:...It seems the ordinary [[Khaenri'ah|Dahri]] machines can no longer satisfy him. As a result, the [[Dwight Lasker|director]] used national resources to obtain something truly horrifying. Rumor has it that someone was nearly killed! I hope this will help him achieve his research objectives... They even got him some rare Dahri mechanical parts being studied by [[Sumeru Akademiya|Sumeru researchers]] as part of the package...

:...
:...Things went out of control for a third time! [[Alain|Guillotin]] may be willing to risk his own life, but that doesn't mean the rest of us feel the same... I came up with an emergency damage control strategy, and I hope we won't need to use it before he finishes his kinematics research. However, given his personality, it seems unlikely that he'll ever truly complete that research...

:...
:...It seems that his experiments into machines were intended to create a [[Seymour|mechanical dog]] as proof of his accomplishments in kinematics and material science. It's actually a good idea and could be showcased in the city, and the creature is much more personable and likable compared to the [[Area Alert Mek|automated turret]] next door...

:...
:...At least he lived long enough to be poached by the [[Marechaussee Phantom|Marechaussee Hunters]]. It wasn't easy for us to survive this long either. But what will we do with this blasted [[Ruin Machine|crazy killing machine]] that can repair itself!? Whatever... That's a problem for future generations...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Ancient Log #5===
This interactable is located at the end of the southern hallway of the Submerged Ruins: Central Region underground area, and was written by [[Jakob Ingold]]. The area can be unlocked by using the [[Key to Some Place in the Institute]].

{{Dialogue Start}}
:...
:...Anyway, when it comes down to it, our research directions are different, so I applied for a new research lab with the director. But there's nothing for it anyway. [[Alain]] is incredibly intelligent, but he only trusts himself, and doesn't trust our observations or accomplishments unless he reaches the same conclusions through his own calculations. Well, it's okay, since Alain is making the world a better place in his own way. I trust him, because this is the world that [[Mary-Ann|Ann]] lives in...
:...Even though the Institute is full of people, I don't have many friends besides [[Carter Scherbius|Carter]]. It feels like everyone kinda dislikes us...
:...[[Rene]] managed to acquire something powerful to research. Apparently these appeared after the [[Cataclysm|disaster]], and are very dangerous for most people. But I feel okay, maybe my constitution really has gotten a lot better...

:...I helped Rene out!

:...When I visited him, I found out that he also attended [[Narzissenkreuz Institute]]. We didn't tell him about the [[Basil Elton|Vice Director]] abandoning us, or it would have made him sad... If only we could have helped him just like I was helped...

:...
:...After discussing it with Rene, he finally agreed to give it a try. He said since it's dangerous everything needs to be made clear to Carter and he must make the judgment himself as it concerns his own life. But, if it's successful, then he'll survive just like I did...
