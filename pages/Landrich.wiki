'''Landrich''' was a [[Mondstadt]] aristocrat who lived during the time of the [[Timeline#The Aristocratic Period|Aristocratic period]] one thousand years ago. Little is known about him besides the fact that [[Eberhart]] was his illegitimate heir, and [[Parsifal]] and [[Ingbert]] were his legitimate heirs.

==Story==
===Aristocratic Period===
Landrich was the head of his clan, though which clan he led is unknown. He organized the [[Dragonspine]] expedition party, including his illegitimate son Eberhart, though he did not take part himself. Though he planned on granting Eberhart legitimacy upon the party's successful return, he was unaware that Eberhart had plans of rebellion. Using traps, tricks, and his manipulative personality, Eberhart caused the deaths of the rest of his party, though he was grievously wounded during his attempt to kill Ingbert and the author of the [[Ancient Investigation Journal]]s, [[Luther]]. According to Luther, Landrich's original purpose for the expedition was to accomplish a great achievement in order to quell the arrogance of those wanting to rebel.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Ancient Investigation Journal: Part I}}</ref>

What happened to Eberhart is unknown, but regardless of his fate, Landrich was likely among the aristocrats exiled from Mondstadt following [[Vennessa]]'s rebellion.

==Trivia==
[[File:Miscellaneous Diluc Story Quest Hydro Abyss Mage.png|thumb|Abyss Mage Landrich interrogated]]
* During [[Diluc]]'s [[Story Quest]], [[Darknight Hero's Alibi]], the [[Hydro Abyss Mage]] defeated and interrogated by the party is named Landrich. They are likely unrelated as their names differ slightly across different languages.
