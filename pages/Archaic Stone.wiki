|description  = A rare ore mined from a deserted spot deep in the mountains.<br />This sort of ore can only be found in veins in the oldest mountains. Perhaps it is due to its extreme rarity, but many merchants haven't even so much as heard of this rock.<br />The ore itself has incredible clarity and its colors are dazzling, almost seeming to glow with an inner light that brings out its blue-violet beauty, which is like the distant and lovely sunset sky.<br />The few scholars who understand its value gave it a most straightforward name &mdash; "Archaic Stone."<br />If you intend to give it as a gift, it would be best to give it to one who recognizes what they're receiving.
