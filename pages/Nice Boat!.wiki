'''''Nice Boat!''''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Wonders of the World]]''. To complete this achievement, the player needs to switch [[Waverider]]s with another player.

==Trivia==
*The name of this achievement is a reference to a [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nice-boat meme] associated with the anime ''{{w|School Days (video game)#Anime|School Days}}''. In 2007, the anime's final episode was canceled due to its similarity to a real murder that had occurred the day before, and the airing instead showed scenery footage, including footage of a boat. An image of the boat was posted on {{w|4chan}} with the caption "Nice boat", and the phrase went viral.<ref>{{w|School Days (video game)#Delay of finale|School Days (video game) &mdash; Wikipedia}}</ref>
