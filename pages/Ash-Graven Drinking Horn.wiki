==Description==
Often do I hear people sing, hear them tell tales,<br><!--
-->At this joyous banquet, when they gather together.<br><!--
-->My heart spurs me on to recite a new song for you:<br><!--
-->I shall strum my strings, weave my melody,<br><!--
-->Start my song, begin my tale,<br><!--
-->Of an ancient ancestor, the valiant giant [[Tupac]].<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->The young, heroic [[Tenoch]] would be enraged to hear this,<br><!--
-->Like a fierce gator, a prideful stag.<br><!--
-->He would have raised his stick high and said to Tupac:<br><!--
-->Why did you come out to sea? Why did you cross the waves?<br><!--
-->Your ancestor [[Uenuku]] would not have been so audacious.<br><!--
-->If you dare oppose me, I shall make sure you end up as fish food!<br><br><!--
-->Tupac, built like a mountain, would have laughed upon hearing this,<br><!--
-->Like a fierce [[Long-Necked Rhino|rhino]], a majestic emu.<br><!--
-->Grasping his drinking horn tightly, he would have replied:<br><!--
-->How could a weakling like you harm me in the slightest?<br><!--
-->By right, this drinking horn belongs to me, to the kin of my homeland.<br><!--
-->If you dare to seize it from me, come wrestle me first!<br><br><!--
-->Tupac, built like a mountain, had always been a heroic figure:<br><!--
-->Once, in a fit of rage, he had broken mountains with his bare hands,<br><!--
-->Thrust rocks into the earth to make hot springs bubble up.<br><!--
-->(The hot springs that can now be seen in the southwest,<br><!--
-->Are his legacy, still visible to this day.)<br><!--
-->Alone he once set out to sea to battle a giant two-tailed whale,<br><!--
-->Tore off the fierce beast's teeth to carry with him.<br><!--
-->Like the springs of that era, his heart was fervent and untamed,<br><!--
-->How could the young, heroic Tenoch possibly hope to impress him?<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->Tupac, built like a mountain, recalled the events of decades past,<br><!--
-->When he contended with Tenoch for the drinking horn.<br><!--
-->And so he spoke before the [[Pyro Archon|lord of the blazing flames]],<br><!--
-->Tupac, built like a mountain, would offer up the drinking horn.<br><!--
-->He would present it, revealing his final hope,<br><!--
-->Revealing his final hope, thus holding the flame high,<br><!--
-->Thus holding the flame high, even till his final breath,<br><!--
-->Even till his final breath, he had not betrayed his oath.<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->This is where my story ends; may the youth remember well,<br><!--
-->Remember the words I spoke, the legends of the ancients.<br><!--
-->My father once sang, in a golden sea breeze,<br><!--
-->My mother taught me too, when I was young and naive.<br><!--
-->The [[Cataclysm|years of darkness]] have long passed, the calamities subsided.<br><!--
-->There is always singing above the flowing springs; always feasts when dusk begins to fall.<br><!--
-->But let the new generation remember, lest they forget this warning:<br><!--
-->Above all else, there are two things that must never be forsaken &mdash; [[Ancient Name|unity]] and promises.
