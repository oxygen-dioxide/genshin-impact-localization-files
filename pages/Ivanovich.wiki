==Profile==
Ivanovich considers himself a distributor, selling everyday items produced in Snezhnaya. He also procures [[Cor Lapis]] to send back to Snezhnaya for their yet-unknown purpose in their factories.

===Personality===
A businessman to the core, Ivanovich tends to go with the flow and seeks out business opportunities even in the midst of danger. He proves unruffled by [[Rex Lapis]]' assassination at the Rite of Descension despite being at the scene when it occurred, and he continues trying to find a way to repurpose meteorite fragments into jewelry even though he knew the meteorites sent people into deep sleep.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ivanovich:''' Good day, my friend! My apologies, but I am out of stock at the moment. Please try again next time.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you...?
::'''Ivanovich:''' I am Ivanovich, pleasure to meet you! I am a businessman from Snezhnaya. I am now waiting for my next delivery.
::'''Ivanovich:''' The people of Liyue are very wealthy! I import goods from Snezhnaya and everything sells out almost as soon as it arrives.
::'''Ivanovich:''' If I had known sooner, I would have opened my own store here so I could sell directly to consumers. That way I would not have to oversee the deliveries myself.
:{{DIcon}} What do you sell?
::'''Ivanovich:''' Technically I am a distributor, selling everyday items produced in Snezhnaya. As well as that, I also act as an agent for Cor Lapis merchants selling to Snezhnayan factories.
::'''Ivanovich:''' The [[Liyue Qixing|Qixing]] have been keeping a close eye on Snezhnaya's senior officials recently...
::'''Ivanovich:''' Some people say that the only reason we are able to buy Cor Lapis from Liyue merchants is because they were mediating behind the scenes...
::'''Ivanovich:''' But I am not privy to the details. So please excuse me from withholding judgment.
::'''Ivanovich:''' Although our goods are produced in high quantities, they are by no means cheap.
::'''Ivanovich:''' So I have a high opinion of Liyue consumers... Their spending always exceeds our projections.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Why's it so chilly here?
:::'''Ivanovich:''' You too? Aha, so it's not just me, after all...
:::'''Ivanovich:''' I'm wearing plenty of layers, but somehow I'm so cold that I can't stop shivering. Let me see what's going on...
:::'''Ivanovich:''' Aha! Turns out I had this stone in my pocket all along. Hmm, must have slipped in there somehow while I was back home...
:::'''Ivanovich:''' Hmm? Piqued your curiosity, has it? Well, it's not classed as ore, and I certainly can't sell it here... So, I may as well let you have it.
::;(Obtain [[Shivada Jade Fragment]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Ivanovich:''' Take care. Hope to see you again when we are fully stocked.

==Event Dialogue==
===Lantern Rite===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ivanovich:''' The glow of the Xiao Lanterns feels so warm...
:'''Ivanovich:''' Even as a stranger in this foreign city, seeing the brightly lit streets and Xiao Lanterns above in the night sky still brings some indescribable warmth to my heart.
:'''Ivanovich:''' Such a warm feeling reminds me of our "[[Krsnik Noc]]" in Snezhnaya.
:'''Ivanovich:''' If you ever have the chance, you must visit Snezhnaya and participate in one of our festivals.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Moonlight Merriment===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ivanovich:''' The Moonchase Festival really is a busy time. Looking at all the locals running about preparing food, I can't help but be tempted to try my hand at it myself.
:'''Ivanovich:''' Do you think some Snezhnayan fare and some grilled pies and such would sell well?
