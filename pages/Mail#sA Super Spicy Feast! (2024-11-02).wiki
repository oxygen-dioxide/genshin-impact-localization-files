|text      = Guoba shook me awake really early this morning... The sky was still dark, and he was standing there with a big basket of bright red Jueyun Chilis. Turns out, another year has flown by, and it's my birthday again!

I've heard all about your amazing deed in Natlan from other adventurers and I was super impressed! It also gave me loads of "fiery" inspiration, so it's time to whip up some new creative dishes! Maybe Guoba had just the same idea and went out to gather such top-notch ingredients overnight.

I'm planning to turn these into a super spicy feast, and you can keep the rest of these incredible ingredients.

I'll be the chef for this meal. Not only is it a birthday celebration for me, but it's also a victory feast for you! So come and enjoy it with us!
