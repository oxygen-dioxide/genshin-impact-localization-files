{{Lang|'''Lyudochka Snezhevna'''|ru=Людочка Снежневна|ru_rm=Lyudochka Snezhnevna}} is an [[NPC]] who left the [[Fatui]] and can be found working as [[Gendou Ringo]] in [[Grand Narukami Shrine]], [[Narukami Island]], [[Inazuma]], after completing the Day 1 objective of [[Gendou Ringo's Strange Fortune Slips]].

==Profile==
<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->
Lyudochka was an orphan raised in the [[House of the Hearth]], an orphanage run by "The Knave" [[Arlecchino]]. Due to her Inazuman heritage, Lyudochka studied Inazuman matters from a young age.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Replacement's Secret}}</ref> She was friends with [[Katarina Snezhevna]], who describes her as being "closer than a real sister."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lost in a Foreign Land: Seeking}}</ref> [[Efim Snezhevich]] also had some shared history with her, which was why he showed her favor compared to the other agents from the House of the Hearth who were assigned to Inazuma.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Shuumatsuban Operations}}</ref>

After the original "Gendou Ringo," [[Momoyo]], faked her death after the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] took on the [[Gendou Ringo's Strange Fortune Slips|strange fortune slips]] &mdash; which Momoyo had intended on using to lure out the Fatui &mdash; Lyudochka was assigned to replace Momoyo as "Gendou Ringo" and tasked with gaining the trust of two supposed [[Shuumatsuban]] members to infiltrate the organization: the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]]. Despite her efforts into the role, [[Yae Miko]] was already aware she was an imposter, although she did not confront her over it. Realizing that her task was impossible to complete and that she had begun to like life in Inazuma, Lyudochka unsuccessfully tried to stall and eventually received her [["Final Instructions"]] from her Teacher<!--Intentionally capitalized-->, [[Efim Snezhevich]]. Efim had begun to get fed up with her stalling, further agitated after fellow spy [[Tae]] informed him she found a light novel in her purse.

The Traveler, seeing that Lyudochka genuinely regretted her actions and did not want the plan to succeed, came up with a plan with Momoyo to fake her death so Efim would not pursue her for her failure. Afterwards, she initially wanted to leave Inazuma out of guilt, but was convinced by the Traveler and Paimon to stay in Inazuma and adopt the Gendou Ringo identity for good.

===Personality===
Originally a Fatuus, Lyudochka was a loyal member who completed her missions as ordered due to fear of failing her Teacher. When she was assigned to the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]], Lyudochka began enjoying life in Inazuma, began questioning her purpose and longed for a place to call home. As such, she began to intentionally stall the orders given to her. She is also soft-hearted, as she wavered when Efim ordered her to "poison" [[Watatsumi Island]] and did not want to orphan more people.

After the Traveler realized she had no ill intentions, they extended a helping hand to her. She initially took it with some hesitation but was guilt-ridden for the sins she committed under the Fatui and sought to leave and start a new life elsewhere. The Traveler helped her even further and she decided to start anew in Inazuma under her new identity after faking her death. She admits that she wished to become a shrine maiden and is very optimistic and cheerful while roleplaying as one, a stark contrast to how Momoyo acted as Gendou Ringo.

===Appearance===
Lyudochka has red eyes and black hair cut into a chin-length bob with her bangs cut straight across. In combat, she is a [[Fatui Electro Cicin Mage]].
