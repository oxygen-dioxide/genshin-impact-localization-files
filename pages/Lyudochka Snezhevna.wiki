{{Lang|'''Lyudochka Snezhevna'''|ru=Людочка Снежневна|ru_rm={{#invoke:ru-rm|main|Людочка Снежневна}}}} is an open-world [[NPC]] who can be found working as [[Gendou Ringo]] in [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Subarea)|Grand Narukami Shrine]], [[Narukami Island]], [[Inazuma]], after completing the Day 1 objective of [[Gendou Ringo's Strange Fortune Slips]]. A former [[Fatui]] spy, she has since left the organization for good to stay in Inazuma as a shrine maiden.

==Profile==
<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->
Lyudochka was an orphan raised in the [[House of the Hearth]], an orphanage run by "The Knave" [[Arlecchino]]. Due to her Inazuman heritage, Lyudochka studied Inazuman matters from a young age, and would wonder about the circumstances of how she was orphaned.<ref name="Secret">{{Ref/Quest|The Replacement's Secret}}</ref> She was friends with [[Katarina Snezhevna]], who describes her as being "closer than a real sister."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lost in a Foreign Land: Seeking}}</ref> [[Efim Snezhevich]] was her Teacher and apparently at least helped to raise her if not doing so himself, which was why he showed her more favor than the other agents from the House of the Hearth who were assigned to Inazuma.

For a time after arriving in Inazuma, Lyudochka worked at the [[Yae Publishing House]] as a proofreader for new novel releases and by accounts did well at the job, which she enjoyed.<ref name="Secret" /><ref name="Dandelions">{{Ref/Quest|Where the Dandelions Find Rest}}</ref> Despite Lyudochka's efforts in the role, [[Yae Miko]] had already known her true intentions but did not take any action seeing how she enjoyed her work.

After the original "Gendou Ringo," [[Momoyo]], faked her death after the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] took on the [[Gendou Ringo's Strange Fortune Slips|strange fortune slips]] &mdash; which Momoyo had intended on using to lure out the Fatui &mdash; Lyudochka, being Inazuman, was assigned to replace Momoyo as "Gendou Ringo" and tasked with gaining the trust of two supposed [[Shuumatsuban]] members to infiltrate the organization. However, she did not expect it would be the famous duo of the Traveler and Paimon.<ref name="Dandelions" /> Realizing that her task was impossible to complete, and now living her dream life in her ancestral homeland, Lyudochka unsuccessfully tried to stall and eventually received her [["Final Instructions"]] from her Teacher<!--Intentionally capitalized-->, Efim. He had begun to get fed up with her stalling, further agitated after fellow spy [[Tae]] informed him she found a novel in her purse, an unnecessary leisure.<ref name="Ops">{{Ref/Quest|Shuumatsuban Operations}}</ref><ref name="Secret" /> One of Efim's goals in changing the general mission was to break the ceasefire in Inazuma and create more orphans that could be brought into the House of the Hearth. Lyudochka considered this vile for Efim, a former orphan, to do along with the open question of whether she was also orphaned through a Fatui scheme.

The Traveler, seeing that Lyudochka genuinely regretted her actions and did not want the plan to succeed, came up with a plan with Momoyo to fake her death so Efim would not pursue her for her failure. Afterwards, she initially wanted to leave Inazuma out of guilt, but was convinced by the Traveler and Paimon to stay. Momoyo also passed on through the Traveler that as the Gendou Ringo identity was only meant to be used for this specific mission and she had no more use for it, Lyudochka might as well adopt it for good, and she resumed her work as a shrine maiden.

===Appearance===
Lyudochka has red eyes and black hair cut into a chin-length bob with her bangs cut straight across. In combat, she is a [[Fatui Electro Cicin Mage]].
