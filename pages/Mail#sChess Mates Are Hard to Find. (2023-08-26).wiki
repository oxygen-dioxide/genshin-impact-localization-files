|text      = Genius Invokation TCG has become quite fashionable in recent days, and many of my chess mates have become enamored. This has made it far more difficult than it once was to arrange a game of Liyue Millennial.

But perhaps it's not surprising. The rules of chess are many and complex, and just setting up the game takes considerable effort, so planning and playing itself require substantial commitments of time and energy. Many have petitioned me to simplify the rules and embrace new updates to reinvigorate the game.

But as I see it, a merchant should find the right market and customers for their goods. Should one blindly seek to simplify chess, it will simply become one ordinary game among many. I have heard that you possess some level of skill in the realm of games, and have learned much regarding how to make tradeoffs and balance the merits and drawbacks of different choices.

Should you have time, would you like to stop by the Jade Chamber? Fret not, the board has already been properly set up, and you may treat it as a meeting between friends bonded by chess.
