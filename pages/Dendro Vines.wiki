'''Dendro Vines''' ''(unofficial name)'' are objects found in [[Teyvat]]. They sometimes spawn around [[Ley Line Outcrops]]. When touched, they deal '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Dendro DMG}}. When hit by a {{Pyro}} attack, they will burn down.

Dendro Vines may also appear around [[Chests]], in which case they must be burned down in order for the chest to be opened. Even though these also appear thorny, touching this type of vines will not deal damage.

[[Dendro Samachurl]]s can also summon three Dendro Vines around the player. These vines can be burnt down with {{Color|Pyro}}, however they deal very low {{Color|Physical DMG}} on contact rather than {{Color|Dendro DMG}}.

While [[Elemental Sight]] is active, Dendro Vines will be Colored green. However, Dendro Vines summoned via Samachurl will not be Colored {{Color|Dendro|green}} while Elemental Sight is active.
