'''Elemental Ambers''', colloquially referred to as '''Elemental Eggs''', are egg-shaped items that, when broken, release their respective element into the surrounding area. Typically, these items spawn for certain quests and events, and are rarely found in regular exploration.

Currently, only {{Anemo}} and {{Hydro}} Ambers can be found.

Anemo Ambers create [[Wind Currents]] when broken. Hydro Ambers summon a localized rainshower when broken, making all characters and enemies within a certain radius {{Color|Hydro|Wet}}.
