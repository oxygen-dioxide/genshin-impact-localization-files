{{Quote|I refuse to back down before people who treat history, and its relics, like trash.|Soraya|[[The Lost Relic]]}}
Soraya is a researcher from the [[Sumeru Akademiya]] who holds a great interest in [[Liyue]]'s history and in particular, the legacy of [[Guizhong]], the Lord of Dust and one of the gods who once lived in the [[Guili Assembly]].<ref name="TLTF">{{Ref/Quest|Treasure Lost, Treasure Found (Part 1)}}</ref> She holds great respect for history and, as such, associates with people who have intimate knowledge of it. She holds the [[Treasure Hoarders]] in great disdain, seeing their plundering and looting of ancient relics for petty cash as sacrilegious. She believes that relics should be for scholars to study, for artists to take inspiration from and for people to admire in an exhibition, not used for earning cash, which is why she holds a low opinion of Treasure Hoarders.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Lost Relic}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Soraya wears a dark green-blue robe with a gold necklace and black sandals. She has brown hair tied in a bun and brown eyes, and wears a pair of black glasses.

==Story==
While traveling through [[Guili Plains]], the [[Traveler]] encounters Soraya amidst the ruins and learns about Guizhong, the Lord of Dust, from her. The Traveler explores the area and brings back transcriptions of writings found within the ruins, which Soraya then puzzles together to uncover Guizhong's Four Commandments.<ref name="TLTF" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Treasure Lost, Treasure Found (Part 2)}}</ref>

After encountering [[Alrani]], another student from Sumeru Akademiya, the Traveler learns that Soraya was one of Alrani's classmates and is held in high esteem by the other girl.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|And This Treasure Goes To...}}</ref> The antiques seller [[Linlang]] mentions asking her about the [[Nameless Treasure]]s, while an anonymous message on the [[Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board#Zhongli's Message|Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board]], likely [[Zhongli]]'s, refers to her as a "scholar friend from Sumeru," with whom the author spoke about a wide variety of topics at great length. Soraya has also discussed the past and present as well as her research with Zhongli.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Between Facades and Familiar Faces}}</ref> She has a pessimistic view that humanity will inevitably destroy itself, if not for the "wisdom and mercy" of the gods, whereas he is more optimistic about mortal capabilities and agency.<ref>[[Jadefall's Splendor]]</ref> 

In the Box of Gadgets version of ''[[The Lost Relic]]'', Soraya is attacked by Treasure Hoarders while protecting a jade plate which records a clash between two groups during the [[Archon War]], but is rescued by the Traveler. After hearing why they were in the area &mdash; to find a certain relic for [[Bao'er]] &mdash; Soraya concludes that the woman is actually a high-ranking Treasure Hoarder. She eventually verifies her conclusions and, in ''[[A Little Raid]]'', sends the Traveler to deal a little punishment on the Treasure Hoarders for disrupting the precious ruins, although Bao'er was not among them.

During the Traveler's first [[Lantern Rite Festival]], they accompany Soraya on a trip to investigate the legend of the adeptus [[Skybracer]], who was being commemorated in that year's Lantern Rite. After taking a look at the soil sample of Mt. Tianheng the Traveler brings her, she concludes that there is no evidence of Skybracer's antlers being present in the soil, which she believes would have been a logical finding if the legend was true.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|When Scholar and Legends Meet}}</ref>
