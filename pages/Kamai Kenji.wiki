{{Lang|'''Kamai Kenji'''|ja=鎌井顕治|ja_rm=Kamai Kenji}} was a historical [[youkai]] in [[Inazuma]].

He is mentioned as part of the [[Mikawa Flower Festival]] and the [[Akitsu Yuugei|Akitsu Haneasobi]] game during the [[Akitsu Kimodameshi]] event.

==Profile==
Kamai Kenji was a powerful youkai who resided in Inazuma hundreds of years ago. He met [[Yanagibashi Takuto]] &mdash; a samurai and founder of the [[Souran Isshin Art]] &mdash; during the Mikawa Flower Festival, after Takuto accidentally entered the magical barrier set up by the youkai and stumbled into it. They became good friends through playing Akitsu Haneasobi, and agreed to meet up and duel every 10 years.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Test of Courage (Event Quest)}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Kamai Kenji is a kamaitachi yokai wearing a standard pale-blue patterned kimono with a yellow obi.

==Story==
Kamai Kenji befriended the samurai and founder of the [[Souran Isshin Art]], [[Yanagibashi Takuto]], during the Mikawa Flower Festival, in which they promised to meet each other every ten years after to duel. In the following 20 years, the two met together twice, had fun, and dueled each other, with Kamai being narrowly defeated by Takuto in the second duel. The two became best friends in the process. However, the two would not meet each other ten years after as war had broken out in the South, and Yanagibashi had to defend the border. When they finally meet ten years after that, Yanagibashi had turned 65 years old, becoming too weak and old to wield a sword or play Akitsu Haneasobi. Kamai became saddened from Yanagibashi's condition, with the youkai [[Hanyuuda Chizuru]] witnessing how Kamai had regretted the relationship with Yanagibashi.

Kamai would later on befriend the third-generation heir of the Souran Isshin Art, [[Tominaga Masanari]]. They fought side-by-side five hundred years ago in their final moments, with Kamai having resolved his regret at that moment.

==Trivia==
* He is based on the {{w|kamaitachi}}, a weasel youkai.
