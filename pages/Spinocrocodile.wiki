{{Description|An ancient life form that dwells in the lake swamp. Ferocious by nature, it will attack from underwater.<br />Its evolutionary history in this land precedes even the advent of Sumeru's forest. In the age when gods with beast's faces still had dominion over the world, these creatures were worshiped as gods by humans. Even today, the desert dwellers see their spiny red crowns as relics of ancient deities.|[[Archive]]}}
'''Spinocrocodile''' is a [[Wildlife]].

In the wild, they lurk in the water and silently ambush their prey. After a fulfilling meal, they tend to rest on the shores of lakes to adjust their body temperature. Sometimes, they open their mouths wide to let birds pick out the food residue.

==Trivia==
* In the World Quest, ''[[The Children of Vimara Village]]'', the children refer to a Spinocrocodile by the name of Gator Raja. This named Spinocrocodile &mdash; Overgrown Gator &mdash; can be found in the small lake that is northwest of [[Gandha Hill]] and east of [[Sumeru City]]. Gator Raja is also involved in the hidden [[World Quest]], ''[[Where Are the Fierce Creatures?]]''. Notably, Gator Raja does not drop any Raw Meat when killed.
* During one of their idle animations, Spinocrocodiles open their mouth wide to let a bird peck food remnants in their teeth. This is inspired by the supposed symbiotic relationships observed between the {{w|Nile crocodile}} and {{w|Egyptian plover}} by {{w|Erodotus}} around 430 BCE. Given the author's tendency to include myths in his works to make them more appealing, it is likely a fabricated claim: there is no observed evidence of such behavior in the modern day as crocodiles constantly grow and shed teeth and therefore have no need to have their dentition cleaned by another organism.
