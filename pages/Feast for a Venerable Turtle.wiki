{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Read the Ancient Stone Tablet)
::{{Readable|title=Ancient Stone Tablet|text=<!--
   -->"In lofty flight doth Mandarin ducks soar, swimming 'neath the sun, their freedom they adore.<br><!--
   -->The turtles betwixt water columns doth glide, catfish in schools, together they bide.<br><!--
   -->The souls of the land, o'er mountain and swamp, creep through the bushes, their spirits to romp.<br><!--
   -->Bishui is wide and mighty, yet a tortoise it spans, crossing with ease, as one snapper can.<br><!--
   -->Surveying the world, inspiration doth unfold, sorrow yet smolders within, like tales of old.<br><!--
   -->The bridge still stands firm, as do boats on the wave, swaying in the wind, lonesome if brave.<br><!--
   -->Offerings of meat, a hopeful display, nourishing companions, as I wait and pray.<br><!--
   -->Freely I offer victuals, a feast to extend, friends partake, in providence, we blend."<!--

:'''Paimon:''' Huh, this stone tablet seems to say that...
:'''Paimon:''' As long as one throws Raw Meat into the river, we can summon old friends we haven't met in a while?
:{{DIcon}} Wait, you can read those inscriptions?
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, don't you underestimate Paimon... You can just decipher it using the stuff you can already read!
::'''Paimon:''' Like so &mdash; Paimon can only read the last two lines, so there's no way she's wrong about what it means!
:{{DIcon}} Uh, it's probably more about throwing the food to memorialize a friend...
::'''Paimon:''' Really? ...Well, Paimon thinks her interpretation is correct, too!
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, let's just toss the Raw Meat in. Maybe an adeptus really will show up!

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... How about we try throwing some meat into the river from that little slope over there?

;(Interact with the spot at the top of the slope)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Let's try tossing some Raw Meat in...)
:;(Submit {{Item|Shrimp Meat|x=3}}, {{Item|Fowl|x=3}}, {{Item|Fish|x=3}}, or {{Item|Raw Meat|x=3}})
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. Look, there's movement there in the water. Is the adeptus coming out?
:{{DIcon}} Seems like it's just a big fish...
:{{DIcon}} Can the adeptus dive and swim?
:'''Paimon:''' Shh... Look!
:;(A Venerable Jadestone Turtle approaches with {{Item|Clearwater Jade|25|x=6}} on its back)

;(Interact with the Venerable Jadestone Turtle's head)
:{{DIcon|Hand}} Try to touch
