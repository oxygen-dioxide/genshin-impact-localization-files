'''Remarkable Chests''' are special [[chests]] found on [[Tsurumi Island]] that give [[Furnishing Blueprint]]s.

Some Remarkable Chests only spawn upon progressing through the [[Through the Mists]] World Quest series. Additionally, some appear to spawn (after the daily [[reset]]) at places where previous chests had been opened.

The Remarkable Chests count towards the "[[Lost Treasure Hunter]]" achievement. Though there is no achievement directly related to Remarkable Chests, the total number of Remarkable Chests found can be checked on the [[HoYoLAB]] app under "Battle Chronicle."

==List of Furnishings==
===Furnishing Blueprints===
