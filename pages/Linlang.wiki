'''Linlang''' {{Lang|zh=琳琅|zh_rm=Línláng}} is a [[shop]] [[NPC]] in [[Liyue Harbor]], [[Liyue]]. She can be found perusing some stalls by the northern end of Liyue Harbor during daytime and tending her [[shop]], [[Xigu Antiques]], at nighttime (19:00 – 06:00). Her stock refreshes every 7 days.

Following a certain dialogue branch for the first time gives the player three [[Fine Enhancement Ore]]s.

She also exchanges the three [[Nameless Treasure]]s for 350 [[Adventure EXP]], 40 [[Primogem]]s, and 100,000 [[Mora]]. Optionally, the [[Dull Ring]] from "[[Nine Pillars of Peace]]" can be sold to her for 200,000 Mora. The player can also choose to sell her the [[Dragonbone Orb]] from [[Lotus Eater]] for 80,000 Mora and 5 servings of [[Bountiful Year]].

==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Linlang:''' Hello! Can I help you?
:{{DIcon}} About Rex Lapis' death...
::'''Linlang:''' Impressive, wasn't it? Even in death, the gods pass in glory, unlike the surreptitious departure of mortals... I'm glad I was able to witness an event of such magnificence.
::'''Linlang:''' It's just a shame that I couldn't have met him, or talked to him, about my dreams...
::'''Linlang:''' Ah, what I am saying? Sorry about that.
:{{DIcon}} You are...?
::'''Linlang:''' I am Linlang, the owner of Xigu Antiques.
::'''Linlang:''' I'm very sorry but the shop is not open yet. If you want to browse the shop, please find me at Xigu Antiques later.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about Xigu Antiques.
::'''Linlang:''' A fellow antique collector, are you?
::'''Linlang:''' In that case, I do hope you will come to the store tonight.
::'''Linlang:''' Right now, though, I am taking my post-breakfast walk. Apologies.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Linlang:''' Oh, I'm just taking a stroll nearby to relax. I'd like to admire the scenery one more time before the sun sets.
::'''Linlang:''' This land has remained at peace for a thousand years now. But sometimes, I wonder &mdash; how did the people who walked this land a thousand years ago feel?
::'''Linlang:''' I cannot know, yes, but our Lord certainly does &mdash; [[Rex Lapis]], who has gently watched over this land for a millennium...
::'''Linlang:''' ...I wonder, has there been anyone at all who has been privy to his feelings across this long period?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Linlang:''' Bye. It was a pleasure meeting you.
{{Dialogue end}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Linlang:''' Welcome to my humble shop! We have some new items in store, if you would be so kind as to take a look at them.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'd like to buy some antiques.
::'''Linlang:''' Yes, please browse as you like. You'll find that our antiques here are worth every Mora.
:;(Opens Xigu Antiques shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
::'''Linlang:''' Hello, I am Linlang, the owner of this store.
::'''Linlang:''' Do you see anything you like?
::'''Linlang:''' Please take as long as you need; there is plenty to see and no rush to choose.
::{{DIcon}} Anything you would recommend?
::'''Linlang:''' Take a look at this piece of flint. It is a shard from the tip of the Geo Lord's polearm. Notice the ancient symbols written on there, with the masterful brushwork following the lines that naturally appear on the material's surface.
::'''Linlang:''' Or this fossilized wood. It is a runner from a primordial tree, and legend says that this tree was so gigantic its root system spread throughout the entire world.
::'''Linlang:''' You might also consider this bottle, which contains the venomous blood of an evil dragon that once wrought havoc on a neighboring land. Due to exposure to the air, the blood has now dried and turned to dust...
::'''Linlang:''' ...However, the venom is so strong that one pinch of it would suffice to take out all the strongest men in a village. Heh.
::'''Linlang:''' Beyond these, there are many other qualities and oddities in store, too. Feel free to peruse them at your leisure.
::{{DIcon}} Sounds dubious to me...
::'''Linlang:''' Well, the value of an antique is whatever you make of it.
::'''Linlang:''' There is a saying, "An antique's credibility is borne of its owner's credulity." It is one's belief in an item as a historical relic that imbues it with meaning.
::'''Linlang:''' By contrast, when you believe than an antique is fake, your denial of the item's value does not change the item in any way.
::'''Linlang:''' The fact is, the items themselves hold no value for my customers. It is the stories attached to the items that hold the real value.
::'''Linlang:''' There's another saying, how does it go... "As long as you have a good story to tell, you'll always find a way forward"... The same principle applies to antiques.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Do you have anything else?
:::'''Linlang:''' Well, take this chunk of rock, for example. Looks perfectly ordinary, but in fact it came from a star.
:::'''Linlang:''' A very long time ago, a star fell from the sky. The force of the impact when it hit the ground is what turned it this color on the outside.
:::'''Linlang:''' Hmm? What do you mean, looks like a regular chunk of ore?
:::'''Linlang:''' ...Wait, no, you're right, sorry. I grabbed the wrong ore. This is just a regular chunk of ore.
:::'''Linlang:''' Ugh, must be the suppliers. They're always trying to sneak the odd dud into the mix... so frustrating...
:::'''Linlang:''' Please, take it off my hands would you? I never want to see it again.
::;(Obtain [[Fine Enhancement Ore]] ×3)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.

==Event Dialogue==
===Lantern Rite===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Linlang during daytime)
:'''Linlang:''' Hi, I'm Linlang. I run an antiques shop called Xigu Antiques... How may I help you?
:{{DIcon}} Please tell me about [[Lantern Rite Festival|the Lantern Rite]].
::'''Linlang:''' There's an abiding sense of nostalgia in the air during the Lantern Rite... Normally I only get that feeling in my shop; I love it, it makes me feel so at home.
::'''Linlang:''' Lantern Rite is much more ancient than any of the antiques in my shop, though.
::'''Linlang:''' Antiquity has real value. I should know, I make my living off that fact. So make the most of this very precious time of year.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Linlang:''' Please enjoy this special time filled with the splendor of antiquity.
{{Dialogue end}}
===Moonlight Merriment===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Linlang during daytime)
:'''Linlang:''' Welcoming the bright moonlight to illuminate the adeptal path &mdash; what a romantic scene!
:'''Linlang:''' I should really start collecting some antiques related to the festival...
{{Dialogue end}}

===The Exquisite Night Chimes===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Linlang during daytime)
:'''Linlang:''' Hi, I'm Linlang. I run an antiques shop called Xigu Antiques... How may I help you?
:{{DIcon}} About the Lantern Rite music festival...
::'''Linlang:''' There's usually a familiar sense of nostalgia in the air during the Lantern Rite, and it complements my store perfectly.
::'''Linlang:''' This year's Lantern Rite music festival, however, has brought along some new ideas.
::'''Linlang:''' People may become interested in music-related antiques, so I should probably read up on related legends too...
::'''Linlang:''' After all, every ancient object that has weathered the ages has a fascinating story to tell.
{{Dialogue end}}
==Trivia==
* While the dialogue branch "About Rex Lapis' death..." is unlocked after completing the Archon Quest [[Chapter I]] Act II: [[Rite of Descension]], which was available at the game's initial release, Linlang's dialogue branch was not added until [[Version 1.1]].
