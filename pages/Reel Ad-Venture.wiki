{{Description|An alchemical potion advertising commission from the [[Knights of Favonius]]. The client hopes to focus their marketing on the importance of choosing the right potion...}}

;Storyline Overview
Okay, my dear friend, the work of editing has officially begun! Our first commission comes from the Knights of Favonius. They want us to produce an advert for their [[Alchemy|alchemical]] [[potion]]s that utilizes boldly contrasting shots to emphasize the importance of choosing the right one.<br>According to my outline, we should first present the unsatisfactory results that arise from drinking ordinary potions, then use narration to tell everyone that this is an everyday occurrence. Finally, we can show the improved combat performance that results from drinking superior potions.<br>I recommend you follow this logic when editing your first cut, then see what it looks like and gather some client feedback. Of course, I back your artistic vision 110%, so feel free to edit the assets as you see fit. After all, this commission comes from the "[[Mondstadt City|City of Freedom]]," so free and unfettered editing may be blessed by fate to produce unexpected results.<br>Oh, and by the way, I hear that potions from [[Mondstadt]] can bestow inspiration. Do you think they can help me improve my filmmaking in the future?

;Synopses
* Synopsis (Shots 1 to 4):<br>Showcase {{Color|BP|Sucrose's}} concerns about the effectiveness of the {{Color|BP|ordinary potions}}, but at {{Color|BP|Noelle's}} insistence, she chooses them all the same. However, when {{Color|BP|faced with hilichurls}}, the potions prove unsatisfactory, failing to improve Noelle's terrible state and causing her to {{Color|BP|perform poorly}}.
* Synopsis (Shots 5 to 7):<br>{{Color|BP|Timaeus|link=1}} appears and explains that this is quite a {{Color|BP|common}} situation, suggesting that people {{Color|BP|select their potions carefully}}.
* Synopsis (Shots 8 to 11):<br>The same situation as before, but in the face of {{Color|BP|Sucrose's concerns}}, {{Color|BP|Noelle}} re-selects the {{Color|BP|best potions}}. This time, Noelle {{Color|BP|performs well}} when {{Color|BP|fighting the hilichurls}}.
* Synopsis (Shot 12):<br>Conclusion, recommending that everyone opts for {{Color|BP|Favonian-brand potions}}.

{{Description|An advertising commission from [[Wanmin Restaurant]]. The client hopes to emphasize the restaurant's quality food, reasonable prices, and lively atmosphere... The copy was written by an unnamed [[Liyue]] poet.}}

;Storyline Overview
Our second commission comes from Liyue's Wanmin Restaurant. It's another advert looking to cook up new customers.<br>To be honest, this one caused me a bit of a headache at first &mdash; I just don't know anything about Liyue cuisine &mdash; but as luck would have it, I ran into a kindhearted Liyue poet who helped me pen a very catchy script.<br>Now, my friend, might I trouble you to edit this one to match the logic of that script?<br>Though I must say, our good poet didn't seem too set in her ways, so I'm sure she wouldn't begrudge you a little editorial freedom. Anyway, the decision is yours, and I look forward to seeing the final cut.

;Synopses
* Synopsis (Shots 1 to 4):<br>Open with {{Color|BP|Guoba greeting customers out front}}, followed by {{Color|BP|Chef Mao's}} sales pitch, which promotes Wanmin Restaurant's {{Color|BP|location, mouthwateringly delicious dishes, and excellent service standards}}.
* Synopsis (Shots 5 to 7):<br>Focus on {{Color|BP|Shenhe's}} poetry to emphasize Wanmin Restaurant's budget-friendly prices, making it a go-to choice for everyday dining.
* Synopsis (Shots 8 to 11):<br>Open the scene with {{Color|BP|Xiangling's}} part of the pitch, emphasizing Wanmin Restaurant's fresh flavors and diverse menu, then wrap things up with a collective endorsement from the {{Color|BP|crowd}}.
* Synopsis (Shots 12 to 13):<br>Behind the scenes footage of {{Color|BP|Guoba secretly snacking off, then being caught by Xiangling}}.

;Storyline Overview
This next commission is... How should I put it...? It's a public service announcement, and definitely not an advertisement for new students. The purpose is to warn students to be careful when choosing an academic focus. Keep that in mind and try not to get distracted by a certain "lead actor."<br>Naturally, you can explore other creative directions, as long as you manage to leave a lasting impression on the students who watch it. As another actor said to me, "Sometimes to cut is to create."

;Synopses

* Synopsis (Shots 4 to 7):<br>The first {{Color|BP|two letters}} that Faruzan receives politely decline her mentorship proposals. Feeling dejected by the repeated mention of the word {{Color|BP|"focus"}} in the letters, she then opens {{Color|BP|a reply from Collei}}.
* Synopsis (Shots 8 to 10):<br>Faruzan's {{Color|BP|initial irritation}} gradually turns into acceptance as she {{Color|BP|reflects}} that it's a good thing for young people to have a focus of their own.
* Synopsis (Shot 11):<br>Conclusion, advising everyone to carefully weigh up their options when choosing a focus, so that they won't end up feeling {{Color|BP|regret}}.

{{Description|A recruitment commission from the Tabletop Troupe. The client hopes to recreate an exciting, professional tabletop adventure to attract more people to join their club.}}

;Storyline Overview
It's time for our final commission. This one's simple &mdash; a recruitment advert for the Tabletop Troupe. The client wants us to attract more hobbyists to their club by showcasing an exciting and well-run tabletop adventure.<br>For an editorial expert such as yourself, a commission like this should be child's play.<br>You know the drill by now &mdash; as long as you complete the basic requirements, you're free to work your creative magic.<br>That said, the cast seem a bit overqualified for a hobby club recruitment ad... A [[Clorinde|Champion Duelist]], the [[Navia|President]] of [[Spina di Rosula]], a world-famous magical duo, and even Lady [[Furina]] herself! I must admit, I was quite nervous after I found out who we'd be working with. You don't think this "Tabletop Troupe" is a cover for some sort of secret society, do you? Maybe there's a deeper meaning behind it all...

;Synopses
* Synopsis (Shots 1 to 6):<br>The scene revolves around members of the Tabletop Troupe taking part in an activity together. Guided by their Game Master, Clorinde, they encounter a {{Color|BP|merchant}}, a {{Color|BP|Sternshield Crab}} blocking their path, and a {{Color|BP|Cryo Regisvine}} guarding some treasure, in {{Color|BP|that order}}. Navia, who is playing an Adventurer, will attempt to use {{Color|BP|"Persuasion"}} in each encounter.
* Synopsis (Shots 7 to 9):<br>After {{Color|BP|Furina}} questions the idea that Persuasion can be used on plants, Navia responds by showing that she now has the {{Color|BP|"Speak with Plants"}} ability. She then goes on to roll a 20, successfully claiming the {{Color|BP|treasure}}.
* Synopsis (Shots 10 to 11):<br>One after the other, [[Lyney]] and [[Lynette]] recite {{Color|BP|slogans for the Tabletop Troupe}}.

;Reviews
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(If the hidden score is 780 points or higher)
:'''Furina:''' {{Color|BP|Rave review}}: Not bad! Both the narrative and execution were beyond fault. Even I struggled to find anything to criticize!

;(If the hidden score is 330 points or lower)
:'''Clorinde:''' Hmm... A narrative thrown into turmoil by the actions of the players, that's certainly an unmissable part of the Tabletop Troupe experience.

;(Otherwise, if no assets are reused and 0-1 shots are unfilled){{Verify}}
:'''Lyney:''' Hmm, a very good advert. It was dazzling &mdash; like watching a magic trick.

;(Otherwise, if either no assets are reused or any asset is used three times){{Verify}}
:'''Lynette:''' Huh? I didn't know you could activate repeat mode too...

;(Otherwise){{Verify}}
:'''Navia:''' You rolled to "Edit"... Success!
