==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
A young [[Oceanid]] from Fontaine, who greatly admired and left to find [[Rhodeia of Loch]]. She joins the Traveler and Paimon in resolving the issue of the water near [[Dawn Winery]] turning bitter.  She is first met after the Traveler defeats some oddly-behaving [[Hydro Slimes]]. Suffering from the bitter water, she is brought to [[Springvale]] to recuperate in the sweet waters of the spring. While there, she passes messages between [[Old Finch]] and [[Callirhoe]]. Though initially speaking in a halting and childlike manner and possessing very limited understanding, her speech and understanding rapidly evolve as she merges with each [[Hydro Mimic]]. Endora successfully communicates with Rhodeia, resolving a misunderstanding and quelling her ire, with Rhodeia then ceasing to make the waters bitter. Though initially planning to merge with Rhodeia, Endora ultimately decides to accompany the Traveler and Paimon in their travels.
