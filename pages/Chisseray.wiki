==Profile==
Chisseray, alongside fellow Junior Researchers [[Genevieve]], [[Maillardet]], and [[Sevigne]], were Bossuet's assistants at the Fontaine Research Institute (which, under Bossuet's reign, was renamed to the "Bossuet Research Institute"). She holds Bossuet in particularly low esteem after having worked under him for several years, leaving behind sarcastic and passive-aggressive remarks in her records of the team's work,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Treacherous Light of the Depths|note=optional interactable Bossuet Research Institute Project Result Summary (I)|quote=Since Monsieur Bossuet became the supervisor of the Bossuet Research Institute (formerly known as Alain Guillotin Memorial Research Institute), his flawless decisions and wise leadership have led to remarkable results in multiple research areas.<br>Out of respect and in gratitude to Monsieur Bossuet (Note: I am absolutely not being mandated to do this by Monsieur Bossuet himself), his highly original research results shall be collected here for future reference.}}</ref> as well as giving the [[Traveler]] a very colorful description of him should they ask. Her resentment of Bossuet is strong enough that Sevigne speculates if Chisseray found Bossuet's portrait, which he left in their [[Bossuet's Abandoned Laboratory|underwater laboratory]] beneath [[Mary-Ann Memorial Park]], the ways in which she would deface it would probably land her in the [[Fortress of Meropide]].<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Sevigne}}</ref>

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Chisseray:''' How wonderful to not be doing research...
:{{DIcon}} Are you a researcher?
:;(Before completing ''[[Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble]]'')
:::'''Chisseray:''' I was. But I don't do that now. I just help [[Raimondo|Mr. Raimondo]] by organizing files and documents.
:;(After completing ''Fontaine Research Institute, Stagnating in the Rubble'')
:::'''Chisseray:''' I was. But since quitting Bossuet's team, I'm an honorary researcher at best. Of course, that means I rank below you, as you're an Honorary Senior Researcher.
:::'''Chisseray:''' Anyway, I don't do that now. I just help Mr. Raimondo by organizing files and documents.
::'''Chisseray:''' Looking back, I should have quit way earlier and let that old fool Bossuet write his own boring papers... It's the only thing he's good for anyway.
::{{DIcon}} And Bossuet is...
:::'''Chisseray:''' He's an old fogey whose vision has already started to go, a researcher without an ounce of creativity, an honorary clothes rack that thinks the world of himself, a bloodsucker who feeds on the research of others and is utterly useless without his subordinates.
:::{{DIcon}} He sounds very... special.
::::'''Chisseray:''' He is. And if I'd realized sooner how "special" he is and made up my mind to quit, my life would have been much easier.
::::'''Chisseray:''' But never mind. I'm not a researcher now and I'm getting my life back on track. And that's enough for me.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Chisseray:''' See you. And if you run into Bossuet, stay away from him.
