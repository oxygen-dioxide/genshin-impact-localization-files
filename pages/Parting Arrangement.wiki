{{Quest Description|Fungus Mechanicus's testing phase is coming to a close. It's time to give Haniyyah and Balfour some feedback...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on [[Haniyyah]], optional)
:'''Haniyyah:''' (Let's get to work once we arrive back at the camp... our fungal friends will love this.)

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on [[Balfour]], optional)
:'''Balfour:''' (Now, we'll need to analyze the data collected from the play-test. Hmm, if I stay up for three more nights, I should be able to get everything done!)

;(Talk to Haniyyah or Balfour after passing time)
:'''Balfour:''' Thank you for your work these past few days, Golden Comet {{Traveler}} and Silver Companion!
:'''Balfour:''' I've logged all your games, and we've been able to gather lots of data from your game records.
:'''Balfour:''' You fall under the category we call "pinnacle-class" players, and I believe that between you and normal testers, we'll be able to come up with some stable improvement directives.
:'''Haniyyah:''' Of course, we'd also like to hear what you thought of the game overall, and if you have any suggestions in that regard.
:'''Haniyyah:''' Your feedback will not only have a positive impact on Fungus Mechanicus, but will also affect the next tournament to some extent.
:'''Balfour:''' Finally, we'd like to hear about your general preferences... Would you prefer novelty, or more competitive aspects?
:{{DIcon}} I'd prefer to emphasize cooperation between companions.
::'''Paimon:''' Right! Competitive clashes are really important, sure, but we'd prefer that future challenges test the bonds between us and our Fungi friends!
::'''Haniyyah:''' Bonds, huh... Alright, I understand.
::'''Haniyyah:''' Mr. Balfour. Do you remember what I told you about the most important idea?
::'''Balfour:''' Understood! I shall endeavor to design more challenges that will test your coordination with one another, where effective communication will allow you and your Fungi friends to unleash your true potential!
:{{DIcon}} I'm partial towards the elegance and thrill of combat.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah! Paimon's also sure that our bonds with our shroom buddies will only become stronger, and won't weaken with time!
::'''Paimon:''' Who knows how well we'll work together the next time we compete? There's no doubt that we'll need the coolest battles to put that on display!
::'''Haniyyah:''' I see. So you're of a mind that suitable challenges can display the full strength of the Fungi.
::'''Balfour:''' In that case, we'll increase the number of challenging events available during the next competition!
:{{DIcon}} I'm not partial to anything. Let's just do something enjoyable!
::'''Paimon:''' That's right. No matter what happens, we'll be happy so long as we can play with our shroom buddies, clear challenges with them, and overcome difficulties together!
::'''Haniyyah:''' Understood. So we'd want a mix of fun and challenge, huh? It sounds simple, but might be harder to execute...
::'''Balfour:''' Leave it to me. I shall do my best to satisfy your requirements!
:'''Haniyyah:''' Same as always, huh, you two...
:'''Haniyyah:''' Regardless, that's it for this round of Fungus Mechanicus tests.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for your hard work!
::'''Paimon:''' Nice! Now that we're done with work, it's time to collect our pay and get some food to reward ourselves, hehe!
:{{DIcon}} Don't forget our salary.
::'''Paimon:''' Right, right. Hehe, food bought with hard-earned Mora tastes so much better!
:'''Paimon:''' Wait... That's not right! We're the organizers of the next tournament, while Haniyyah and Balfour are making preparations for it...
:'''Paimon:''' Haniyyah's our awesome assistant, and Balfour's also being employed by us.
:'''Paimon:''' Does that mean we'll have to, uh... pay our employees for their hard work... and stuff?
:'''Haniyyah:''' Oh, no, that's not necessary. In fact, that's too kind of you! I volunteered to do this job, and I learned a lot from it, too!
:'''Haniyyah:''' I mean, I'm someone from the mercantile industry as well, so the experience of managing Fungus Mechanicus has been quite valuable to me.
:'''Haniyyah:''' If this work were to be open to the public, I'm quite sure you'd have no lack of offers from people who'd like to buy the rights to it, to be honest!
:'''Haniyyah:''' And once Fungus Mechanicus starts turning a profit, Mr. Balfour should make his investment back and a large portion of the profits will go to me.
:'''Haniyyah:''' I will then set a portion of that aside for use as funds for the next tournament, and another portion will be used to take care of our shroom friends.
:'''Haniyyah:''' And by that I don't just mean Bongo-Head, but also the Fungi that the other contestants have entrusted to me, like Stormstress.
:'''Haniyyah:''' In other words, the improvements you're helping us make to Fungus Mechanicus will not only make us all a tidy profit, but will also go into securing welfare for the Fungi.
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, so that's it... Well, Paimon doesn't get all this profit and earnings stuff, but it sounds like everyone wins, huh?
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon's feeling that sense of accomplishment already!
:'''Paimon:''' If we get the chance, {{Traveler}}, we should tell our friends in Sumeru about Fungus Mechanicus. Gotta spread the word and everything!
:{{DIcon}} Of course, of course.
:'''Haniyyah:''' I'll be heading out of the city with our Fungi friends to meet up with my assistant, and then we'll return to our campsite.
:'''Haniyyah:''' The Fungi who stay at the campsite will get worried if we're away for too long.
:'''Haniyyah:''' Mr. Balfour will stay here to promote the test version of Fungus Mechanicus, so if you've not yet had your fill of fun, you can keep playing.
:'''Balfour:''' Indeed! Play to your heart's content!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, you're going already, Haniyyah? With Bongo-Head and the rest?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon still wants to play with Bongo-Head...
:'''Paimon:''' But meeting you again has definitely put Paimon at ease!
:'''Paimon:''' It was especially great to see that our shroom buddies are all right as rain, and that we're just as tight as we used to be!
:'''Haniyyah:''' Don't worry. I believe we'll meet again soon.
:'''Haniyyah:''' Though the two of you are constantly traveling, I do have some means of contacting you &mdash; for example, we can send you letters through the Adventurers' Guild.
:'''Haniyyah:''' I'm sure that when we next meet, our friends will be both healthy and hearty!
:'''Haniyyah:''' Just hang tight and wait for good news from me.
:'''Paimon:''' Yup! We believe in you, Haniyyah!
:{{DIcon}} Keep up the good work, Haniyyah.
:{{DIcon}} Take care of our friends.
:{{DIcon}} And don't forget to take care of yourself.
:'''Haniyyah:''' We'll see you next time then, Golden Comet and Silver Companion!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Post-Quest Dialogue===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Balfour)
:'''Balfour:''' Ah, my wondrous heroes! Would you be game for a few more rounds of Fungus Mechanicus?
:'''Balfour:''' And should you have any questions, feel free to ask away!
:{{DIcon|Fungus Mechanicus}} Play Fungus Mechanicus
:{{DIcon}} So, about future funding...
::'''Paimon:''' That's right! If you hadn't mentioned it, Paimon would've totally forgotten! During the first tournament, we were attracted by the big...
::'''Paimon:''' Err, we were attracted by the big tournament, which also had a sweet prize!
::'''Paimon:''' So that means that we'll also have to prepare a tidy sum for the next tournament, won't we? That way, we can motivate people to aim for the top, which is where the best prizes will be!
::'''Paimon:''' We'll also have to rent the venue, hire staff... And all this stuff's gonna cost Mora... Are we really gonna have to fork over all eight figures of it?
::'''Balfour:''' Haha, and now you're speaking my language!
::'''Balfour:''' Not to worry. I will be on the hunt for sponsors in the lead-up to the next tournament. We're talking about something along the lines of several dozen merchants helping to put up the funds for it to be held.
::'''Balfour:''' As for renumeration, we'll just have to provide them with the equivalent amount of "exposure." After all, many merchants place great emphasis on the advertivement potential that popular competitive events have!
::{{DIcon}} I understand.
::{{DIcon}} That's definitely an idea.
::'''Paimon:''' That does sound pretty reasonable. If things go well, raising funds this way means that everyone wins!
::'''Balfour:''' This field of work can be considered my specialty. Just give it the okay, and I'll start sponsor-hunting.
::'''Balfour:''' Of course, I'll investigate the status of all our sponsors very carefully before organizing it into a chart for your perusal.
::{{DIcon}} We will indeed have to be quite selective.
::{{DIcon}} We'll definitely have to weed out any people with ill intent.
::'''Balfour:''' Understood. Vigilance will be the watchword &mdash; especially after what happened the last time!
::'''Paimon:''' We'll be counting on you then, Balfour!
:{{DIcon}} We can leave it for later.
::'''Balfour:''' Alright! See you later, then, great heroes!

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Souka, optional)
:'''Souka:''' (Yes, I think the reunion between old friends requires more detail and effort. More emotion... I must make this part better!)

;(Talk to Haniyyah and Souka at the camp north of Port Ormos)
:'''Haniyyah:''' It's almost time to go, Souka. We'll rest for a while after eating, and then we'll pack the campsite up.
:'''Haniyyah:''' We'll be heading out on a long trek shortly. If any of the Fungi can't walk any further, then we'll do it as we did before...
:'''Haniyyah:''' You'll carry Twirly-Whirly and Blitzara, I'll carry Bongo-Head and Kindlejoy, and the tents and baggage will be left to the Sumpter Beast.
:'''Souka:''' Alright. I'll get the fire started, then. And put some more food on, too &mdash; this is going to be a long trip, after all.
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like Haniyyah and Souka have met up at the campsite. Paimon wonders what they're talking about...
:{{DIcon}} Well, why don't we listen in?
::'''Paimon:''' Sure! Paimon's honestly quite curious... And surely they wouldn't mind, would they?
::'''Souka:''' I heard that the Fungus Mechanicus trials went quite well.
::'''Souka:''' Yesterday, a few merchants came up to me to confirm their invoices, and even they've played Fungus Mechanicus &mdash; they've got nothing but praise for it, too.
::'''Haniyyah:''' Indeed, Balfour's really got a head for planning. We could learn a thing or two from him.
::'''Haniyyah:''' We also had the help of Golden Comet and Silver Companion, and everything went quite smoothly overall. It's been really encouraging, honestly.
::'''Souka:''' Ah, as one might expect of the "Twin Stars of Brilliant Valor"! Troubles that would stymie any ordinary person shall not frustrate them!
::'''Souka:''' And issues that an ordinary person can handle shall all but quickly melt away...
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, they're praising us!
::{{DIcon}} Shh, Paimon...
::{{DIcon}} Hehe...
::'''Haniyyah:''' Come to think of it, have we ordered enough goods?
::'''Souka:''' Don't worry. We're practically old customers of theirs by now.
::'''Souka:''' Construction materials for expanding our camp, new bedding and a small meal table for our fungal friends, and a climbing frame for them to play... Everything has been accounted for.
::'''Souka:''' The Marvelous Jelly ingredients that Master Najah left with the merchants are also as if fresh out of the oven!
::'''Souka:''' You could say that we've really gained a lot from this trip to Port Ormos!
::'''Haniyyah:''' Glad to hear it.
::'''Haniyyah:''' After we get back to camp, I'd appreciate it if you could teach me some more words and grammar. I've got to finish my copy of "500 Things You Need to Know When Organizing a Big Event."
::'''Souka:''' No problem. To be honest, the things we've gone over before are definitely sufficient. With how hard a worker you are, you'll finish that book with ease, I know it.
::'''Souka:''' But are you sure you still want to learn more about doing business? You could always leave it to Mr. Balfour.
::'''Haniyyah:''' The first iteration of the tournament had a lot of staff working in the background apart from Mr. Balfour, and we don't know how many more people we'll need to hire for the next.
::'''Haniyyah:''' We can't just put the burden solely on his shoulders, and we shouldn't make our Golden Comet and Silver Companion worry about trivial matters either.
::'''Haniyyah:''' That's why I need to learn how to wear many hats quickly. Apart from doing my job as a beast tamer well, I want to be able to handle all sorts of tournament-related affairs.
::'''Haniyyah:''' And that's how I'll meet their expectations...
::'''Souka:''' That makes sense... In which case, I'd like to help too!
::'''Souka:''' I don't know what I can do, actually, but I'm determined to do something!
::'''Haniyyah:''' In that case, I'd advise you to improve your physical abilities first. You'll have time for other things once you're able to survive by yourself in the wild. If not, I'll have to constantly keep an eye on you.
::'''Souka:''' I'll... I'll do my best. I won't drag you down!
::'''Souka:''' I mean, I've improved quite a bit during this time, haven't I? I even managed to beat back a large Shroomboar that had come charging into the camp!
::'''Haniyyah:''' Hmm. Speaking of fighting, that reminds me. Would you fancy a change of attire?
::'''Haniyyah:''' The hems of your current clothes are way too long for living in the forest, and they look pretty expensive as well. It would be a huge shame to ruin them...
::'''Haniyyah:''' I have a few spare sets of Eremite attire, and even some weapons I used to use. If you don't mind, I could give them to you.
::'''Souka:''' A mercenary's garb? I... I'm curious, that I must admit! This would be an amazing experience for me as a writer!
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, looks like they're getting along pretty nicely!
::{{DIcon}} If no one interrupts them...
::{{DIcon}} I think they could probably go on forever...
::'''Paimon:''' Alright, let's not disturb them, then. We should just let them continue discussing the future!
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps we should say hello all the same...
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm, that works too. Sounds like they're going soon, so we can take this opportunity to chat just a bit.
::'''Paimon:''' Hey there, Haniyyah, Souka!
::'''Souka:''' Ahh! A sudden appearance, as befits our "Call-And-They-Appear Adventurers"!
::'''Paimon:''' Huh. That nickname's also a first...
::'''Paimon:''' How many nicknames do you have for us anyway, Souka? Maybe Paimon should get a little notebook someday and write them all down.
::'''Haniyyah:''' Now, I did say that we would meet again soon, but I didn't expect to be proven right quite so quickly.
::'''Haniyyah:''' Perhaps our next meeting will be just as unexpected as this one.
::'''Haniyyah:''' If you choose to see your parting with your Fungi friends in that manner, the parting should sadden you less.
::{{DIcon}} That does make sense.
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, thanks Haniyyah! Paimon's feeling loads better already!
::'''Haniyyah:''' We were just planning to return to camp once we finish eating. If you're not in a hurry, would you like to come with us?
::'''Haniyyah:''' Souka's a very good cook, and she often makes things I've never even heard of &mdash; it'd be a shame for you to miss out.
::'''Haniyyah:''' It was her suggestions that led Najah to make all kinds of new Marvelous Jelly flavors. Our shroom buddies really do enjoy them.
::'''Paimon:''' R&mdash;Really?
::'''Souka:''' Oh, it's nothing that dramatic. I was just trying to imitate some dishes I read about in the bridging plots of some light novels. There wasn't any special basis behind it...
::'''Souka:''' Now that you two are here, I'm going to do more than my best to whip something awesome up!
::'''Paimon:''' Woohoo, time for a feast!
::'''Paimon:''' It's time for Souka's "Unbound Author's Feast"!
::'''Haniyyah:''' I'll call our fungal friends over and lay a spread of their favorite Marvelous Jellies for them, so we can all eat together.
::'''Haniyyah:''' Hmm... I... seem to have gotten used to this, haven't I?
::'''Haniyyah:''' ...How nice.
::'''Paimon:''' Did you just say something, Haniyyah?
::'''Haniyyah:''' No, not really... Heh, just look at Souka go. It's almost like she's conjuring a meal, rather than cooking it.
::'''Souka:''' Well, I'm starting &mdash; just watch me!
::{{Black Screen|Souka picks out quite a few light novels with exceedingly long titles from her pile of books and checks them against the ingredients available at the campsite before deciding on the menu.}}
::{{Black Screen|Afterward, she whips out some cooking utensils and begins the flashy and swift process of cooking. She quickly completes several luxuriant dishes.}}
::{{Black Screen|Everyone sits on the campsite grounds, enjoying the delicious feast together with the Fungi.}}
::{{Black Screen|The murmuring waters intertwine with the forest fragrances and the flavors of the feast...}}
::{{Black Screen|Time seems to slow down, and the enjoyable time stretches on...}}
::'''Paimon:''' Phew... That was great. Paimon's so full!
::'''Paimon:''' What do you think, Bongo-Head, Kindlejoy, Twirly-Whirly, and Blitzara?
::'''Bongo-Head:''' ♪~
::'''Kindlejoy:''' ♫~
::'''Twirly-Whirly:''' ♩~
::'''Blitzara:''' ♬~
::'''Paimon:''' Hooray! Everyone else has eaten and drank their fill, too!
::{{DIcon}} Huh, I didn't understand that!
::{{DIcon}} Can Paimon speak to the Fungi?
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, guess you'll have to have a few more conversations with Bongo-Head before the next tournament!
::'''Paimon:''' Speaking of that, Paimon didn't think that you could cook Ajilenakh Nuts in that many ways...
::'''Paimon:''' Or that cooked Sunsettias and Zaytun Peach would have this sort of flavor when mixed with spices.
::'''Paimon:''' Huh, Souka hasn't been here long, but she seems like she already understands the unique points of the local ingredients!
::'''Souka:''' Well, that's our job as authors. Before we write anything, we must do sufficient research into the places we will write about, and memorize the local encyclopedias as much as possible.
::'''Souka:''' Sprinkle in a bit of the thought process that one reads about often in light novels &mdash; combining two strange elements to see what happens &mdash; and you might be pleasantly surprised by what you find.
::'''Souka:''' Speaking of that, I just remembered a light novel opining that the pinnacle of culinary skill can transcend even the most absolute of preferences and the most ossified of habits...
::'''Souka:''' For example, you can make people who don't enjoy spicy food eat some, or cause dogs to fall in love with cat food...
::'''Souka:''' The author reasoned that "there are no borders within food so long as you grasp and control the key ingredient that lies between love and hate"!
::'''Souka:''' Perhaps that principle may also work with our shroom buddies?
::'''Souka:''' Perhaps they may no longer be limited to using Marvelous Jellies for sustenance should our culinary skills reach a certain threshold.
::'''Paimon:''' Is that so? That... sounds... kinda reasonable?
::'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, maybe we should keep an eye out the next time we go to Inazuma to see if we can find that kind of light novel!
::'''Paimon:''' If a suitable opportunity arises, we should start our own special culinary training. Let's show our shroom buddies a whole new world of gourmet dining!
::{{DIcon}} Leave it to me, Paimon!
::{{DIcon}} We'll give it a try, no matter how hard things get!
::'''Souka:''' Nice, nice. I guess I can add "Hyperadaptive Chef" to your list of features... and perhaps you really will succeed!
::'''Haniyyah:''' If it's you two, I suspect that you'll even be able to accomplish things that cannot be explained through common sense &mdash; you'll show everyone that it's done.
::'''Haniyyah:''' I look forward to it, in fact. Let's all do our best!
::'''Paimon:''' Alrighty then! Now that we're all fired up, let's get a move on!
::'''Paimon:''' Let's share another meal just like this one the next time we meet!
:{{DIcon}} Let's leave them to do what they have to.
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm, that's true. Everyone has their own arrangements, so let's not disrupt their rhythm.
::'''Paimon:''' Let's hope we meet them again soon!

;(Talk to Bongo-Head, Blitzara, Kindlejoy, or Twirly-Whirly)
:'''Paimon:''' Bongo-Head, Kindlejoy, Twirly-Whirly, Blitzara! You're all here!
:{{DIcon}} The gang's all here, indeed.
::'''Paimon:''' Make sure you listen to Haniyyah, alright? Eat on time, sleep well, train hard, and live happy lives!
::'''Bongo-Head:''' ♪~
::'''Kindlejoy:''' ♫~
::'''Twirly-Whirly:''' ♩~
::'''Blitzara:''' ♬~
::'''Paimon:''' Hehehe, that's good, that's good. We'll have loads of presents for you all the next time we meet!
::{{DIcon}} Behold Paimon, grandmaster of the fungal tongue!
::{{DIcon}} Teach me your ways, great master!
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, to be honest, Paimon doesn't know what they're saying either, but they sure do look happy, and they listen to Paimon!
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon already knows what we should bring them then...
::'''Paimon:''' We'll get Bongo-Head a real round hat. It'll look nice and it'll also protect its soft head.
::'''Paimon:''' It can wear that hat, and when it doesn't, Paimon will take care of it.
::'''Paimon:''' That way, Bongo-Head will never go bongo-less, and it'll be cooler than ever!
::'''Bongo-Head:''' ♪~
::{{DIcon}} Bongo-Head's a Hydro Fungus...
::{{DIcon}} Don't you mean it'll be wetter than ever?
::'''Paimon:''' Uh, um... Guess we can just get it a waterproof hat! Y'know, maybe we'll get one that's made of Nilotpala Lotus or something like that. That way, the water droplets will just slide off it!
::'''Paimon:''' It'll be a bit more expensive, but eh, it's fine &mdash; you can just take it out of Paimon's allowance!
::'''Paimon:''' Twirly-Whirly's next up. We should get it a satchel for it to store Marvelous Jellies. That way, it can just grab some whenever it's hungry.
::'''Paimon:''' Twirly-Whirly is all floaty-boaty, it can use Anemo, and it's really strong, too &mdash; carrying stuff for the other Fungi should be no problem!
::'''Paimon:''' It can drag its own luggage along, after all.
::{{DIcon}} Twirly-Whirly's pretty strong.
::'''Twirly-Whirly:''' ♩~
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe! Looks like Twirly-Whirly loves the idea!
::'''Paimon:''' Kindlejoy's up next. We need to pick a snug eyemask for it that won't fall off no matter how it swings around...
::'''Paimon:''' Right, we should also find an opportunity to have Haniyyah take its measurements.
::{{DIcon}} And what for again?
::{{DIcon}} Wait, I don't get the point of this gift.
::'''Paimon:''' C'mon, Kindlejoy's a Pyro Fungus. Just think about it. Pyro Fungi are like, super shiny!
::'''Paimon:''' Don't you think that the light that Kindlejoy might wind up waking itself up with its own light from time to time? That sounds like it'd be really uncomfortable!
::{{DIcon}} Well, do you see Kindlejoy having eye bags?
::{{DIcon}} Hmm... Y'know, when you put it like that, it does seem that Haniyyah might be the one who needs an eyemask.
::'''Paimon:''' Maybe we should just ask the shroom in question!
::'''Paimon:''' Kindlejoy, do you normally sleep well?
::'''Kindlejoy:''' ♫~
::'''Paimon:''' It seems to be saying... "very well indeed"... So it doesn't have this particular problem, huh.
::'''Paimon:''' Let's give this a little more thought. Paimon's sure that we can come up with something that Kindlejoy will love!
::'''Paimon:''' Next, let's talk about Blitzara's gift. Paimon thinks it should be a drawing board that you can leave traces on using Electro.
::'''Paimon:''' Blitzara's a very active and agile sort, so it should really enjoy drawing!
::'''Paimon:''' And it can also get some exercise at the same time &mdash; two birds with one stone!
::'''Blitzara:''' ♬~
::{{DIcon}} It would need to give you the option of scrubbing the board clean.
::{{DIcon}} We'd have to prevent the drawing board from turning into an utter mess.
::'''Paimon:''' That's true! Let's give that function a bit of thought before placing an order with a craftsperson, shall we?
::'''Paimon:''' We also need to think about who would be able to fulfill such a commission...
::{{DIcon}} Hmm, but you know, you've already revealed the contents of the gifts...
::{{DIcon}} Haven't you already ruined the surprise at this point, though?
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, it's fine! Paimon said that we'd come up with "loads" of presents, so there'll be more to come!
::'''Paimon:''' We can take our time to consider and take our pick. We're not strictly by numbers, after all.
::'''Paimon:''' Our goal is to make sure that our shroom buddies will have loads of fun with the gifts!
::{{DIcon}} A pile of gifts it shall be.
::{{DIcon}} It'll be tons of fun indeed!
::'''Paimon:''' Alright, guess we should set off too. Let's take as many commissions as we can, so that we can save the Mora we'll need to buy these presents.
::'''Paimon:''' Alright then, Bongo-Head, Kindlejoy, Twirly-Whirly, Blitzara. We'll see you all soon, so be patient, alright?
:{{DIcon}} We'll come back and play with them later.
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm, it seems like Haniyyah and Souka are getting ready to leave soon. Let's be quick and make sure we come back in time and get to see everyone!
