==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nika:''' Did you know that the [[Sumpter Beast]]s in the port were all raised by my dad?
:'''Zai:''' Wow, your dad is amazing!
:'''Nika:''' Of course! What about your dad? Does he do anything amazing?
:'''Zai:''' My dad... I don't think he's good at anything. He just hangs around at home all day, playing cards and having sunbaths.
:'''Nika:''' Does that mean your family doesn't even have one Sumpter Beast...?
:'''Zai:''' Yeah, we don't. There are people with Sumpter Beasts who often come looking for my dad, but they would soon take the Sumpter Beasts away and leave nothing for us...
:'''Nika:''' Eh? Why...
:'''Zai:''' So I've always been curious. Sumpter Beasts look like huge loaves of bread... Do they taste as good as buttered bread, too?
:'''Zai:''' My family has lots of big ships at sea, so we eat fish every day. All kinds of fish. And I'm getting sick of it!
:'''Nika:''' Poor you... I haven't eaten Sumpter Beasts either, but I can ask my father if he can spare one for you.
:'''Zai:''' Really? You're the best!
{{Dialogue End}}

==Event Dialogue==
===Chromatic Ode of Candies and Roses===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nika:''' Sabzeruz Festival, Sabzeruz Festival!
:'''Zai:''' Sabzeruz Festival, Sabzeruz Festival!
:'''Nika:''' Where should we go today? Want to dress up the Sumpter Beasts for the festivities together?
:'''Zai:''' Woohoo! Is it a Sabzeruz tradition for people who keep Sumpter Beasts?
:'''Nika:''' Eh? I, uh... I don't remember Dad ever doing it...
:'''Nika:''' But don't you think it really adds to the festive mood?
:'''Nika:''' The Dendro Archon will bless the trees with delicious apples, making the Sumpter Beasts happy too!
:'''Zai:''' Oooh, that's right! If Sumpter Beasts are all dressed up and looking their best, and enjoy their food, they'll probably be tastier too!
:'''Nika:''' ?
