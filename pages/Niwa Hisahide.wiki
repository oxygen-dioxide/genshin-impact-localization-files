'''Niwa Hisahide''', typically referred to only as '''Niwa''', was a historical figure in [[Tatarasuna]], [[Inazuma]] who lived around 400 years ago. He was a central figure in the "Tatarasuna Mystery," during which he mysteriously disappeared and was eventually blamed with the incidents that occurred.

In reality, he was murdered by [[Il Dottore]] as part of a [[Fatui]] plot to cause chaos at Tatarasuna for a future endeavor.

At the time of his death, Niwa was a young man. Notably, he had red streaks in his hair, a trait shared by his distant descendant [[Kaedehara Kazuha]].

==Story==
Niwa Hisahide was a member of the Niwa Clan, which is distantly related to the [[Kaedehara Clan]] and was one of the three ''sansaku'', or great masters, of the [[Isshin Art]]. Niwa's bladesmithing skills led him to become the Armory Officer of [[Mikage Furnace]] sometime before the events of the "Tatarasuna Mystery."

===Tatarasuna Mystery===
Right before the events of the Tatarasuna Mystery, [[Mikoshi Nagamasa]]'s yoriki [[Katsuragi]] discovered a puppet, the entity that would later become [[Scaramouche]], inside [[Shakkei Pavilion]] while investigating a cave-in around [[Nazuchi Beach]]. He brought this puppet back to Tatarasuna, where the swordsmiths there took him in as one of their own and began calling him "kabukimono." Niwa reassured the kabukimono that he was human, but simply lacked a "heart."<ref name="Kabukimono">{{Ref/Quest|The Kabukimono's Finale}}</ref>

Around this same time, a mechanic from [[Fontaine]] calling himself "Escher" appeared, working with the [[Akame School|Akame Clan]] &mdash; another clan of the Isshin Art ''sansaku'' &mdash; to revolutionize the smelting process at Mikage Furnace. "Escher" was actually [[Il Dottore]], dispatched on a mission by [[Pierro]] to cause chaos at Tatarasuna and lay the groundwork for a future endeavor. Taking an interest in the puppet, Dottore decided to make him the key player in his experiment at Tatarasuna and his smelting process, though highly effective, was actually releasing the [[Tatarigami]] inside [[Crystal Marrow]] into the environment. As workers grew sick and died from the curse's effects, people began to panic and Niwa implemented an information blackout to control the situation.

While the kabukimono left for [[Narukami Island]] to entreat the [[Raiden Shogun]]'s aid, Niwa took a device created by Escher to absorb the filth in the Mikage Furnace, intending to fulfill the sacrifice needed for the device to work. Before that, however, he confronted Escher about his true purpose. He had been wary of Escher from the start and, although he was able to ascertain that "Escher" was an alias and that the man before him was not from Fontaine, was unable to figure out the man's objective. After fatally wounding Niwa, Dottore dropped all pretenses and revealed that he was a Fatui Harbinger who had come to sow chaos and reap the rewards in the future, provoking the man into having hatred in his heart.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call}}</ref> After Niwa succumbed to his wounds, Dottore cut his still-warm heart out of his chest and placed it into the device.

The kabukimono returned from his expedition empty-handed, unaware that [[Ei]] had already retreated to the [[Plane of Euthymia]] while he was barred from visiting [[the Shogun]]. Viewing [[Yae Miko]]'s promise to send aid as a sign that the Shogunate had turned their backs on them, the kabukimono returned only to discover that Niwa had gone missing. Dottore convinced him and the people of Tatarasuna that Niwa had abandoned them to their fates, and that their only hope lay in the kabukimono. Taking the device with him, the kabukimono managed to survive the ordeal of absorbing the filth. Afterwards, "Escher" bid him to open the device, where he found a withered heart &mdash; which Dottore claimed was from a subordinate of Niwa's whom Niwa had killed. The kabukimono, believing that Niwa had betrayed him and the people at Tatarasuna, was enraged and came to view this incident as the "second betrayal" that he experienced.

With Niwa's disappearance, the responsibility of shouldering the punishment for the events that transpired at Tatarasuna fell on Mikoshi Nagamasa's shoulders. Unwilling to let his savior face capital punishment, Katsuragi decided to take the blame and punishment on himself, and was executed by Nagamasa.<ref name="Kabukimono" /> It is unknown whether their companions &mdash; [[Miyazaki Kaneo]], [[Kinjirou]], and [[Nozomu]] &mdash; were aware of this, as the [[Rather Aged Notes]] they left behind in Tatarasuna suggest they truly believed that Katsuragi performed some kind of misdemeanor for which Nagamasa killed him.<ref>Interactables: [[Rather Aged Notes]]</ref>

===Revised History===
During the events of {{Quest|The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call}}, Scaramouche learns the truth behind Niwa's death, taken from Dottore's own memories which [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] previously connected to while she was verifying that he had eliminated his segments. After indirectly confirming from the [[Traveler]] that it was possible to change the past, Scaramouche decided to erase his own existence using the remaining divine power he had.

While he was able to remove his direct involvement in the events that came to pass, the "Tatarasuna Mystery" and later [[Case of the Eccentric]] still occurred, albeit with different events to account for his removal from the timeline. In the new version of the "Tatarasuna Mystery," Niwa and another swordsmith successfully used the mechanic's device to purge Tatarasuna of its filth at the cost of their lives.
