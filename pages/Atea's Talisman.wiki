'''Atea's Talisman''' is a [[Quest Item]] obtained during the {{Quest|Home of the Hot Springs}}.

It is a good luck charm that [[Atea]] carried for her whole life, even after she was forced to retire from combat. During ''Home of the Hot Springs'', she asks the [[Traveler]] and [[Mualani]] to deliver it to Mavuika as a memento, knowing that her own end was near. Mavuika receives it in the following quest, ''[[A Decision (Archon Quest)|A Decision]]''.
