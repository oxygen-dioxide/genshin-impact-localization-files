|text    = I went to [[Port Ormos]] on my travels with [[The Crux|the fleet]].

Although it was a brief stay, I was touched by what I saw and felt.

The winds of [[Sumeru]] contain a certain rhythm, the [[spice]]s there are rich and intense, and even the handicraft adds a unique cultural flavor to symmetrical aesthetics. It's hard to resist their charm...

I took strolls in mountains during the day and drank to my heart's content in taverns at night. Sometimes, I also talked with travelers about the local customs of different places. I felt very much at ease.

I never talked about myself, though. But I believe if you had been there, you would've shared many vivid stories of yours.

The thought of it makes me want to see you. I'm gifting you a sprig of flowers, please accept it.
