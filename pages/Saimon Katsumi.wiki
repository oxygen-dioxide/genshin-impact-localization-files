{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Saimon Katsumi:''' Haha, it's you! Thanks for helping me get [[Saimon Jirou|Jirou]] back. He certainly seems more responsible now.
:{{DIcon}} About Jirou...
::'''Saimon Katsumi:''' He's been talking about wanting to tend to the fields... Oh well, I suppose it's not a bad thing.
::'''Saimon Katsumi:''' He left home only to find that it's still better here. He's been through quite a bit, though I suppose it all ended well.
::'''Saimon Katsumi:''' As for me, I'm getting old and I don't expect him to become something extraordinary. I'm happy as long as he's safe and leading an honest life.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you for that spectacular sword.
::'''Saimon Katsumi:''' There's no need to thank me. It would only be fitting if someone like yourself wields the ancestral sword of the [[Saimon Clan|Saimon family]].
::'''Saimon Katsumi:''' You're different from my son. I have confidence that you will find great success. Good luck, youngster.
