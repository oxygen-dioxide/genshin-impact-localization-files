The {{Lang|'''Shuumatsuban'''|ja=終末番|ja_rm=Shuumatsu-ban}} is a secret [[Inazuma]]n organization under the [[Yashiro Commission]].<ref name="proof of guilt">{{Ref/Quest|Proof of Guilt}}</ref><ref name="sayu char details">{{Ref/CS|Sayu|Character Details}}</ref>

[[Sayu]] is described as its resident ninja, although all Shuumatsuban members appear to practice ninjutsu.<ref name="proof of guilt" /><ref name="Nakanishi">{{Ref/NPC|Nakanishi}}</ref>

Their headquarters is a ninja village.<ref name="Nakanishi" />

==Activities==
The Shuumatsuban works to keep Inazuma safe.<ref>{{Ref/HEO|Gendou Ringo's Strange Fortune Slips}}</ref><ref name="SlipSeries">World Quest Series: [[The Very Special Fortune Slip]]</ref> Their duties appear to revolve around espionage and require them to utilize a wide range of skills, including combat. They are led by the head of the Kamisato Clan and Yashiro Commissioner, currently [[Kamisato Ayato]]. Shuumatsuban members report directly to Ayato,<ref name="ayato vo">{{Ref/VO|Kamisato Ayato|More About Kamisato Ayato: IV}}</ref> but they may answer to others in exceptional circumstances.<ref name="ninken by the shore" />

Members receive a monthly salary. Sayu's salary for one month is 200,000 [[Mora]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Buyer's Guide to the Statue of Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder}}</ref>

==Membership==
Most of the Shuumatsuban are orphans who were taken in and raised by the organization starting at a young age. As a result, Shuumatsuban members are highly loyal.<ref name="ayato vo" /> [[Momoyo]] is one such member,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Where the Dandelions Find Rest}}</ref> and Sayu may be another.<ref name="sayu char details" />

The identities of most Shuumatsuban members are highly classified and kept secret from the vast majority of people, to the point that even those who die while carrying out top-secret missions are not publicly commemorated.<ref name="ninken by the shore">{{Ref/Quest|Ninken by the Shore}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* The term {{Lang|''ban''|ja=番}} as a group of samurai refers to guards or a squad to maintain security. For instance, between 1716 and 1868, the shoguns of the Tokugawa Shogunate employed elite intelligence officers called {{Lang|{{w|Oniwaban}}|ja=御庭番|ja_tl=His Excellency's Garden Guard}}. In popular culture, the officers of Oniwaban are often depicted as veteran spies akin to ''ninja'' during the medieval period (c. 1200–c. 1600).
* The slogan of the Shuumatsuban seems to be, "Send in the Shuumatsu to end traitors and criminals alike."<ref name="SlipSeries" />
* The Shuumatsuban can make elemental powder. It is slightly toxic.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Shuumatsuban Operations}}</ref>
* Ayato also uses the Shuumatsuban to deliver strange foods to Thoma.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|New Shoots from Old Branches}}</ref>
