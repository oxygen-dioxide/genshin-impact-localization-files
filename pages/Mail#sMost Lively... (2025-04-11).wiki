|text      = One has taken up residence in [[Liyue Harbor]] for quite some time now, and to be sure, the affairs of the mortal realm have proved tumultuous compared to the untroubled existence one led on [[Mt. Aocang]]. However, one has observed a certain warmth, unique to mortals, beneath these everyday interactions.

Take this morning, for instance. Several children from the neighborhood visited one's abode and poured forth a litany of heartfelt wishes for one's birthday from memory &mdash; last among which, that one should live to see a hundred.

Worried that such speech might offend, [[Shuyu]] swiftly steered the conversation elsewhere. Ah, but with such kind children and a disciple of thoughtful, filial inclination, how could one be anything save elated?

Therefore, one has prepared gifts in return &mdash; [[Adepti Sigil]]s to ward off misfortune for all you young ones. [[Ganyu]]'s, [[Shenhe]]'s, and Shuyu's have already been wrapped, and of course, there is one each for you and your little [[Paimon|companion]]. Once the birthday banquet concludes, do line up in an orderly fashion to collect your gifts.

After all... Ahem! As Liyue's customs dictate, birthday celebrations are to be conducted amidst a fittingly lively atmosphere.
