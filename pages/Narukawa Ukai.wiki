|description = A rod created to commemorate the ancient Ukai, or Cormorant, fishing method. The ruby-red gem at the tip of the rod represents the tinder used by the cormorant fishers, and the bird ornaments along the rod's shaft represent the cormorants themselves, who helped the hard-working Inazumans pass through those cataclysmic years. This low-efficiency fishing method has long become obsolete, but the persevering, pioneering spirit has been passed down together with this rod.

==Trivia==
*As the description says, {{Lang|''{{w|Cormorant fishing|ukai}}''|ja=鵜飼|ja_lit=cormorant feeding}} refers to a traditional Japanese fishing method to use trained cormorants for fishing. Each river has its own tradition for ''ukai'' and the tradition is referred to as the combination of its river name and the term ''ukai'' (e.g., {{w|Cormorant fishing on the Nagara River|Nagaragawa Ukai}}).
*{{Lang|Narukawa|ja=鳴川|ja_tl=Roaring River}} is a Japanese place name and surname. In this case, however, the name may refer to a fictional Inazuman river in the game (although not appeared elsewhere), whose name is likely named after {{Lang|Narukami|ja=鳴神|ja_tl=Thunder|ja_lit=Roaring God}}, a title of the Raiden Shogun.
