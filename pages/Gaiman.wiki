==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Gaiman:''' Yes, this is the spot... the first grand master stood right here and narrowed his eyes into a cold stare, which he fixed firmly on the vile dragon before him...
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Gaiman:''' I'm a novelist. Doing some research for my latest work.
::'''Gaiman:''' I originally came to Liyue looking for the author of [[A Legend of Sword]], but then I happened across some works on the rise and fall of the [[Guhua Clan]]...
::'''Gaiman:''' I thought: "what a great topic to write about!" So, I've decided that I'm going to kick start my writing career with a swashbuckling Guhua masterpiece!
::'''Gaiman:''' Chapter One opens with the grand master fighting the dragon! Did you know this was the very spot where he was standing...
::{{DIcon}} What's A Legend of Sword?
:::'''Gaiman:''' You know, it's a strange one. The author, Master [[Xingqiu|Zhenyu]], is huge in [[Inazuma]] and Fontaine. But no one in Liyue has ever heard of him, even though he was born and raised here.
:::'''Gaiman:''' The book is hands down a classic. There are plenty of copycat authors in Inazuma, but none has achieved anywhere near the same level of success. He is, as they say, inimitable...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} So, tell me about the Guhua Clan.
:::'''Gaiman:''' Well, it was once a flourishing organization in Liyue. Back then, they were even called the Guhua Brotherhood.
:::'''Gaiman:''' But now, there are few if any who would call themselves Guhua disciples.
:::'''Gaiman:''' I bought a batch of swords from someone who claimed to be a Guhua disciple some days back. He claimed that they were the Clan's hidden treasures.
:::'''Gaiman:''' But the boss at the smithy informed me two days later that they were just run-of-the-mill weapons.
:::'''Gaiman:''' *sigh* I didn't think that charlatans from Liyue could be so deceitful. Well, these swords are a burden to me as-is, so why don't you take them? Out of sight, out of mind, as they say!
::;(Obtain 2{{star}} [[Silver Sword]] ×2)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Gaiman:''' Farewell! Keep an eye out for my next novel, A Legend of Guhua. I'm gonna finish this one for sure!
