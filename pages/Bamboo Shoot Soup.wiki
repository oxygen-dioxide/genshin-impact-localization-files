|description     = A soup dish that's been stewed for a good long while.
|desc_suspicious = The inexpert heat control has caused the fresh meat to be a bit tough, and the salty ham has covered the expected taste. The bamboo shoots, which have absorbed the flavors of both meats, are probably the only acceptable part of this dish.
|desc_basic      = The meat and ham have been diced into small pieces, and the soup has been kept on low heat till it turned milky white. The process has brought out the distinct flavors of both kinds of meat, making for an especially tasty soup.
|desc_delicious  = One whiff is enough to whet one's appetite greatly, and the concentrated flavors fill your body with every spoonful of soup. It is almost like spreading a pair of wings and walking on clouds.

==Trivia==
* The real-life version of this dish is {{w|Yanduxian|''Yāndǔxiān''}} (腌笃鲜), a traditional Shanghainese slow-cooked soup. The soup's name comes from its unique combination of two kinds of meat, with ''Yān'' (腌) meaning "cured [pork]", ''Dǔ'' (笃) describing the sound of bubbling soup, and ''Xiān'' (鲜) meaning "fresh [pork]".
