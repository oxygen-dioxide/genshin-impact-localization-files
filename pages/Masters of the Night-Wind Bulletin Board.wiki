===Introduction===
:'''Tribal Announcement:''' "Whether you're a weary traveler or a seasoned returning guest, the Masters of the Night-Wind bid you welcome."
:'''Tribal Announcement:''' "May you run and not stumble. May you walk in the night and not get lost. These words are just words, but words have the power to save or destroy, so please, speak freely."

===A Warning For the Uninitiated===

:'''Tourist Message Board:''' "Do not touch secrets that you cannot overcome by your abilities."
:'''Tourist Message Board:''' "Guests from beyond the night-wind, remember not to ask about taboo mysteries, lest you court disaster."
:'''Tourist Message Board:''' "When asking questions, be wary of making rash decisions, lest you come to regret a wrong move too late."

===Fontainian Phlogiston Pattern===
:'''Message:''' "Praise Master [[Ixim]]! The phlogiston pattern you drew is incredible. I've finally become popular! As soon as I got back to [[Fontaine]], lots of people thronged around me!"
:'''Ixim's Message:''' "Err, thank you very much for the compliment. But I don't recall drawing you anything like that. Are you sure this is connected to me?"
:'''Message:''' "Why, of course, it's related to you &mdash; as soon as I got off the [[aquabus]], I disrobed and displayed the pattern you drew to all. Forget humans &mdash; even the [[Gardemek]]s started chasing after me!"
:'''Message:''' "Good thing I'm a fast runner and didn't let them take advantage of me! *sigh* Seems like being famous is a real hassle, too..."
:'''Ixim's Message:''' "That's... How should I put this? I think this has nothing at all to do with the phlogiston pattern, and in any case, you really shouldn't be taking your clothes off in public spaces..."

===Fortune For a Fortune===
:'''Hornshroom Augery:''' "O visitor from afar, have your eyes grown dim? Have you lost your way? Come into the Hornshroom Augery, and I will lead you to your answer."
:'''Silken Handwriting:''' "Master [[Chicome|Chicomexochitl]], I am a merchant from Fontaine. I would like to ask you: Where should I go to find personal happiness?"
:'''Hornshroom Augery:''' "Chase not a vague remoteness, but stop and gaze around you. Happiness may be found there, glimmering brightly like gold."
:'''Silken Handwriting:''' "Thank you so much, Master Chicomexochitl. I understand now &mdash; the [[Mora]] gleaming in my pocket here is the source of my happiness! Indeed, it was right beside me all along..."
:'''Hornshroom Augery:''' "Even though any normal person could see that's not the point I'm trying to make... I'm still glad that you're happy."

===Fortune For a Fortune II===
:'''Silken Handwriting:''' "Master Chicome, it's me again. I'm a merchant from Fontaine, but I never feel like I have enough Mora. How can I get more Mora than I can spend?"
:'''Hornshroom Augery:''' "As the ancient sages say, be ye not the [[Saurian]] who lusts after unrighteous wealth... (The subsequent text has been randomly crossed out)."
:'''Hornshroom Augery:''' "No, wait! I'm a fortune-teller. What do you take me for, an investment bank? Could you please be a little more down-to-earth here?"
:'''Silken Handwriting:''' "Earth, eh... I see, I see. What you're saying is that I should invest in geological and mining ventures, yes? I get it now."
:'''Hornshroom Augery:''' "Hang on. I never said that! Don't take me so literally each time!"
:'''Silken Handwriting:''' "I'm here to keep my promise! Thank you so much, Master Chicome! I made a mint this time &mdash; you truly are a most efficacious sage! I'll be back with more earnest inquiries for sure!"

===Graffiti Alliance Announcement===
:'''Graffiti Alliance Announcement:''' "Whether they be ideas that come to you while meditating or motifs read in the [[Sacred Flame]], they must be witnessed by the world!"
:'''Graffiti Alliance Announcement:''' "Break these conventions of silence! Shatter this dull atmosphere! Pick up your spray can and let the mountains and the people of the world hear your voice. Let them see your colors, and let them know your choices!"
:'''Graffiti Alliance Announcement:''' "Become the voice of avant-garde. Join the Graffiti Alliance today!"
:'''Graffiti Alliance Announcement:''' "Despite painting being a form of sorcery in and of itself, imaginative thinking will be very well-received &mdash; but all the same, take care to avoid those most sacred of places."

===Idukan's Trove Advert===
:'''Idukan's Trove Advert:''' "Welcome to [[Idukan's Trove]]. This month's new stock: 'The Case Files of Miss Orith: Night on Cider Lake' and 'Mirage Warriors Special Collection: Volume VII'."
:'''Idukan's Trove Advert:''' "If we don't have the book you want in stock, please place an order with us. It's alright if you don't know the book's precise name. We'll be happy to help you find it."

===Mind the Saurians===
:'''Full 3-Page Long Guarantee:''' "I, [[Samil]], am well aware that touching the feathers of a meditating [[Iktomisaurus]] without permission is a serious offense indeed..."
:'''Full 3-Page Long Guarantee:''' "...I hope everyone learns from my experience, and will not fiddle with the wings of Saurian whelps out of curiosity &mdash; and definitely not try to feed them any [[Jueyun Chili]]s..."
:'''Full 3-Page Long Guarantee:''' "...Thank you, Elder [[Tlapo|Tlapopoctiztetl]], for not minding my behavior and for not having me expelled..."
:'''[[Tepano]]'s Message:''' "And please everybody: Do not disturb Saurian whelps while they rest. Nor should you touch them willy-nilly, like Mr. Samil did."
:'''Tepano's Message:''' "If you want to learn more about saurian whelp habits, you can ask Explorer [[Ororon]]."
:'''Tepano's Message:''' "Also: Ororon is just really into his herbal medicine research. He is not a greengrocer."
