|text1    = An evolved [[Fungus]]. When it is hit by {{Color|help|Electro attacks}} and [[Catalyze]] reactions, it will accumulate Activation. When it is hit by {{Pyro}} attacks, it will lose Activation progress. When it accumulates sufficient Activation, it will enter an {{Color|help|Activated state}}. An activated Jadeplume Terrorshroom will unleash more fearsome attacks until it becomes exhausted. When it is not Activated, the Jadeplume Terrorshroom can be put into a [[Burning]] state via the use of {{Color|help|Pyro}}, which will cause it to become Scorched. It will then spread spores around to create Fungi in an attempt to escape this status.
