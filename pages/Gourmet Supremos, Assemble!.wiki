{{Quest Description| You meet an odd bunch of people out in Inazuma's wilds...}}
:'''Xudong:''' Uh, [[Parvaneh]], are there really branches like that around here?
:'''Parvaneh:''' I think so. That's what it says here in this book...
:'''Julie:''' Urgh... I'm starving...
:'''Xudong:''' Hey, Parvaneh, why don't you look up some other method in your dictionary?
:'''Parvaneh:''' What do you think I am, omnipotent!? Besides, this isn't a dictionary. It's just a travelogue from the [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]].
:'''Xudong:''' Fine. Just think of a way, please. Otherwise, we'll have to eat grilled fish again.
:'''Parvaneh:''' Gr&mdash;Grilled fish... Ugh, let's just go back to the town and get an adventurer to help, or we put up a commission, shall we?
:'''Parvaneh:''' Isn't that what you used to do back in Liyue when you had a problem?
:'''Xudong:''' That was Liyue... We're in Inazuma now. We're strangers to this land...
:{{DIcon}} What are you all doing?
:'''Xudong:''' Are you... an adventurer? A traveler? Or both...
:'''Xudong:''' Well, forget it. Who cares? I guess this is fate.
:'''Xudong:''' We're the [[Gourmet Supremos]]. We're currently traveling around the world in a quest to improve our culinary skills.
:'''Parvaneh:''' Ugh, I'm begging you, can you please not say that name out loud...
:'''Xudong:''' Hahaha, come on, it's fine! Anyway, Traveler, are you also going in to collect [[Sakura Bloom]]s?
:'''Xudong:''' If so, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. This place has been blocked by some kind of weird contraption. There's no way in.
:{{DIcon}} I'm just passing through.
::'''Xudong:''' Oh, is that so? Alright then. But if it strikes your fancy, it would be nice if you could help us give this barrier a bit of thought.
::'''Xudong:''' Parvaneh found a method in her book.
::'''Xudong:''' It says you need to touch a [[Thunder Sakura Bough]] before you can get through this barrier.
::'''Xudong:''' But as for those Thunder Sakura Boughs... To be honest, we have no idea what they really look like.
::'''Xudong:''' Well, that's the run-down of our situation. We're still trying to find a way in.
::{{DIcon}} Why do you want to get in?
::'''Xudong:''' We'd like to get some of the Sakura Blooms inside ourselves, of course.
::'''Xudong:''' I've heard that the Sakura Blooms here have the best mouthfeel, and are perfect for cooking.
:{{DIcon}} The method you mentioned earlier...
::'''Xudong:''' Oh? You're really going in?
::'''Xudong:''' Well, that method was recorded inside Parvaneh's dictionary&mdash;
::'''Parvaneh:''' I told you! It's not a dictionary. It's a travelogue from the Akademiya!
::'''Xudong:''' Well, whatever the case, she found a way.
::'''Xudong:''' It says you need to touch a [[Thunder Sakura Bough]] before you can get through this barrier.
::'''Xudong:''' But as for those Thunder Sakura Boughs... To be honest, we have no idea what they really look like.
::'''Parvaneh:''' There aren't any photos in this book either.
::'''Xudong:''' I'm officially sick of eating grilled fish. If I can get my hands on some of those Sakura Blooms. I'm sure I can whip something nice up.
::'''Xudong:''' I've heard that the ones here have the best mouthfeel, and make for perfect cooking ingredients. But why, oh why does there have to be a barrier here...
:'''Xudong:''' Well, we'll keep trying our luck around here. Let us know if you find some leads, Traveler.
:'''Parvaneh:''' ...Mr. Xudong. Is that really how you ask someone for a favor?
:'''Xudong:''' Eh? *cough* Oh right. Traveler, if you could help us bring some Sakura Blooms out from inside...
:'''Julie:''' If you could do that, never mind the payment, Xudong here will also make you some really awesome food!
:'''Xudong:''' You're really good at making these deals, huh, Julie...
:'''Xudong:''' Well, that's how it is, Traveler. Please help us, if you don't mind.

;(Talk to Xudong or Parvaneh or Julie again)
:'''Xudong:''' Parvaneh, is there really no other way to do this?
:'''Parvaneh:''' My book only mentions this one way.
:'''Julie:''' Heh, if only it was just a bunch of monsters barring our path...
:{{DIcon}} Could you repeat that method of yours to me again?
:'''Parvaneh:''' Eh, allow me. Basically, you need to search for something nearby known as a Thunder Sakura Bough and touch it.
:'''Parvaneh:''' After that, something known as an Electrogranum will attach itself to you, and that will allow you to pass through the barrier.
----
{{Quest Description|update| After finding and touching the Thunder Sakura bough, you successfully passed through the barrier and obtained the Sakura Bloom coveted by the group.}}
;(Talk to Xudong after obtaining the Special Sakura Bloom)
:'''Xudong:''' Parvaneh, is there really no other way to do this?
:'''Parvaneh:''' My book only mentions this one way.
:'''Julie:''' Heh, if only it was just a bunch of monsters barring our path.
:{{DIcon}} Are these the Sakura Blooms you've been looking for?
:'''Xudong:''' Ah! Yes, that they are! And this color...
:'''Julie:''' Woohoo! Guess we can finally eat now!
:'''Parvaneh:''' Wait, you've already passed through that barrier? Did you use the method I told you about?
:{{DIcon}} That I did.
:'''Parvaneh:''' Could you tell me where you found that Thunder Sakura Bough?
:'''Parvaneh:''' When you touched that Bough, how did the Electrogranum come to rest upon you?
:'''Parvaneh:''' ...Wait, I'm sorry, let me pull out my notebook. So, did you feel anything after the Electrogranum attached itself to you? And...
:'''Xudong:''' Parvaneh, please, give this Traveler a moment. They just helped us out... I think your research can wait a bit, right?
:'''Xudong:''' Thank you very much, Traveler. As we agreed, you will be paid.
:'''Xudong:''' But before that, just wait here with us for a while. I believe I'll be able to make a dish with the Sakura Blooms you brought.
:'''Xudong:''' I've heard of an Inazuman specialty known as Sakura Tempura. I suppose now's the time to try it out.
:'''Xudong:''' Give me a while to prepare. It shouldn't take too long, so come find me in a moment.
:{{Black Screen|''Xudong starts cooking...''}}
:'''Xudong:''' It goes like this... and this...
:{{DIcon}} Have you finished it yet?
:'''Xudong:''' Just hold on a moment... wrap it up in flour, put it in to dry...
:'''Xudong:''' And there we go! Sakura Tempura &mdash; try it while it's hot!
:'''Julie:''' I&mdash;It's delicious! ...&nbsp;If a bit too hot...
:'''Parvaneh:''' Xudong, I believe that this "tempura" also needs to be served with a special dipping sauce...
:'''Xudong:''' A dipping sauce? Well, I must say that I haven't prepared one of those yet. I'll look into it next time should we get the chance.
:'''Xudong:''' This serving of Sakura Tempura is yours, Traveler. Please take it as thanks for your help.
:'''Xudong:''' Ah yes, I'll give you a copy of the recipe too. Just give me a moment to write it down...
:'''Xudong:''' Try it yourself if you get the chance! Cooking is really fun, you know?
:{{DIcon}} Thank you.
::'''Xudong:''' Don't mention it!
:{{DIcon}} Where will you all be going next?
:'''Xudong:''' We'll be in Inazuma for a while, so I suspect that we might head to {{Color|bz|Kannazuka}} later.
:'''Xudong:''' Julie says that she also wants to see that [[Sacred Sakura|Sacred Sakura Tree]] at the [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Subarea)|Grand Narukami Shrine]].
:'''Xudong:''' They say that all the Sakura Blooms on this island fell from that huge tree.
:'''Xudong:''' I wonder, how large must that tree have been to have so many leaves fall from it...
:'''Xudong:''' You should pay it a visit if it takes your fancy, too.
:'''Xudong:''' Thank you for your help once again, Traveler. Well, I'm going to have a bite too. I'm starving...
