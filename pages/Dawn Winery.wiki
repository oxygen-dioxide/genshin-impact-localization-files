==Descriptions==
{{Description|Filled with the fragrance of grapes and wine, this is the estate of one of Mondstadt's distinguished houses. It has {{sic|conquered drinkers}} of the city over with its unmatched wines, and is in some ways the holy land to which all who love the bottle must make pilgrimage.|Viewpoint, [[Manor of Daybreak]]}}
{{Description|Nestled in the land southwest of Mondstadt sits the winery that has passed down the legacy of Mondstadt's traditional wines and ciders for generations.<br />The grapes grown here are used to produce a range of wines that are popular right across Teyvat.<br />Every year's products are split, with a portion being sold locally within Mondstadt, the rest is sold off via the trade route that sits south of the city.|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Exploration], Genshin Impact Official Site}}
