|text    = Lately, rumors about someone going on an extraordinary adventure around the world piqued my curiosity. I would like to have a chat about it with an experienced traveler like you.

Don't worry. Even though we'll be meeting at the [[Jade Chamber]], there's no need for any formalities. You don't have to bring any gifts or dress up for the occasion. Just think of it as an ordinary get-together with a friend. I have prepared a few small dishes and an assortment of drinks, but if there's anything else you need, feel free to make a request to my secretaries.

It seems like the weather tonight will be excellent, and admiring [[Liyue]]'s scenery at night never gets old. Come visit me, I'm sure we'll have a fruitful chat.

Interesting things you've seen and heard on your adventures... I'll be waiting to hear the stories you have to tell.
