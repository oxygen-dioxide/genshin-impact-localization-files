{{Description|A mighty race of vishaps that dwell within the deep seas.<br>That they hate light is not due to an overly fragile sense of sight. Instead, it is because they have had the selfless sunlight and the surface world taken from them that they refuse to countenance man-made light.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}

'''Bathysmal Vishaps''', also known as '''Dragonheirs of the Depths''' or '''Hydro Vishaps''', are a race of [[Vishaps]] found in [[Enkanomiya]]. After the reinstatement of [[Neuvillette]] as [[Hydro Dragon]], they can also be seen in [[Fontaine]].

They are described as pure, primordial elemental creatures, wild spirits who never bent the knee to any god or worldly power.<ref name="STDS">{{Ref/Quest|The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent}}</ref>

Bathysmal Vishaps have a special attack known as "Cleansing Shower", which drains a set amount of [[Energy]] if the attack hits. If the hit target does not have sufficient energy, they will lose [[HP]].<ref>YouTube:: [https://youtu.be/9LR1HGtpWz4&t=1817s Version 2.4 Special Program]</ref><ref>HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/1806516/ The Inazuma Diaries: Enkanomiya Vol. 2 — New Living Beings]</ref> This HP loss ignores [[shields]], but can be negated using [[Elemental Burst]] [[Invincibility Frames|i-frames]]. A purple HP bar indicates HP loss by a Bathysmal Vishap.

==Lore==
The Bathysmal Vishaps are an intelligent and extremely adaptable race, capable of rapid evolution to survive in their environment. They are able to freely choose which genetic traits to pass on to their offspring, and can even spontaneously create new traits, including [[element]]al affinities. This allows them to adapt within as little as one generation. For instance, if a heat-resistant vishap matures in a cold environment, its offspring will have high body fat, greater predilection towards sleep, and may express the {{Cryo}} element.<ref name="TBC4">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|4|Bathysmal Vishap Experimental Records}}</ref> Some vishaps can even wield multiple elements.<ref>Adventurer Handbook: [[Adventurer Handbook|Bathysmal Vishap Herd]]</ref>

Prior to maturation, Bathysmal Vishaps can also choose which traits to "activate." For example, a vishap with both heat-resistant and cold-resistant traits can selectively express heat resistance if it matures in hot conditions, or cold resistance if it matures in cold conditions. One researcher remarked that they "had already stored a veritable armory within their bodies" before meeting the people of Enkanomiya.<ref name="TBC4" />

Bathysmal Vishaps have their own methods of communicating with each other, but also demonstrate an astonishing ability to learn human language. Within four generations, their linguistic capabilities can match that of a 12-year-old human student. It was in fear of this potential that the [[Vishap Research Lab]] halted their experimentation.<ref name="TBC4" />

They are very aggressive towards humans, possibly due to their past treatment in Enkanomiya. They are also, like all vishaps, elemental creatures of the [[Light Realm]], making them fundamentally at odds with the [[Realm|Human Realm]], which Gods and mortals inhabit, and the [[Abyss|Void Realm]].<ref name="STDS" />

The Bathysmal Vishaps obey and follow their [[Dragon Sovereigns]], whom they see as the peak of their kind.<ref name="TBC4" /> One such figure is the [[Hydro Dragon]], who would've been born from their kind had it not been for their impure evolutions. Instead, the new Hydro Dragon was reborn as [[Neuvillette]], who lost most of his memories and took on a human form.<ref name="Bolteater">{{Ref/Enemy|Bolteater Bathysmal Vishap Hatchling}}</ref> After Neuvillette's Authority was restored, some Bathysmal Vishaps began venturing to the surface. Before the tree in [[Erinnyes Forest]] is restored, one [[Primordial Bathysmal Vishap]] can be found residing at [[Loch Urania]]. Afterwards, another group of appears in the same area. Currently, most Fontainians are not aware of their presence.<ref>{{Ref/BB|Café Lutece Message Board|The topic of the lecture at Salon Caritat this week}}</ref>

===History===
The people of Byakuyakoku traditionally referred to them as the "Dragonheirs of the Depths." It wasn't until after their experiments were observed by [[Orobashi]] that their name was changed to "Bathysmal Vishaps."<ref name="TBC4" />

During olden times, for thousands of years, the Dragonheirs of the Depths terrorized the people of [[Enkanomiya]] (formerly ''Byakuyakoku''). In order to survive the sharpened claws of the dragons, the people of Enkanomiya learned that the Dragonheirs loved the dark and the light scared them away, thus they<ref name="TBC1">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|1|The Serpent and Drakes of Tokoyokoku}}</ref> used thousands of lanterns to ward them off.<ref name="TBC2">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2|Before Sun and Moon}}</ref> But these efforts were not particularly effective and so the people prayed and lamented until one of the [[Heavenly Principles]]'s Four Shades, [[Istaroth]], answered their prayers and gave [[Abrax]] the knowledge to create the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]].<ref name="TBC2" /> The people of Enkanomiya relied on the light of the Dainichi Mikoshi for an untold amount of years until the [[Orobashi|Watatsumi Omikami]] came several thousand years ago and defeated the Dragonheirs of the Depths, suppressing them under the sea with its jade corals. Soon after, Watatsumi Omikami brought the people of Enkanomiya to the surface and created Watatsumi Island for them to live on.<ref name="Moon-Bathed Deep">{{Ref/Quest|The Moon-Bathed Deep (Quest)}}</ref>

===Legacy===
The spirit of Watatsumi Island constantly feels the calls of Enkanomiya, down in the depths. As a result, its soil is slowly bleaching, becoming Holy Soil. If this continues, Watatsumi Island will one day become a desert as pale as the moonlight.

According to tradition, every several centuries, the shrine maidens of Sangonomiya Shrine must take advantage of the moment when the spirit veins flow smoothly in order to break the barrier between Enkanomiya and Sangonomiya, to retrieve a [[Jade Branch of a Distant Sea|Jade Coral Branch]], left behind by the Watatsumi Omikami to suppress the Dragonheirs of the Depths, and perform the [[Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri]] ritual in order for the sunken "spirit" to return, which will stop the erosion of the Holy Soil.

However, though there are many Jade Coral Branches, as this tradition continues, the Dragonheirs of the Depths may one day break through its barrier and invade Watatsumi Island.<ref name="Moon-Bathed Deep"/>

==Trivia==
* Bathysmal Vishaps lose all visual acuity after they mature, apparently "because of their great hatred for humanity." It is unclear exactly what this means; perhaps they just don't want to see humans.<ref name="DFF">{{Ref/Item|Dragonheir's False Fin}}</ref>
