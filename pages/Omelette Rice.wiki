|desc_suspicious = The egg skin just about barely covers the rice, and it has been fried for so long that it has lost all fluidity. Might as well call it "fried egg on rice."
|desc_basic      = The evenly beaten egg fluids are fried into half-doneness before being poured out on top of the rice, and tomato ketchup is drizzled over top afterward once it is ready to plate up. They say that this dish was derived from another region, though this version involves a more complicated cooking method.
|desc_delicious  = Gently poking at the outer layer of the egg skin, which is not wholly cooked yet wraps itself and its red ketchup crown around the tightly packed white rice, shall prick the appetite of any customer&mdash; and after they have partaken joyfully, they cannot help but smile.

==Trivia==
*This dish refers to {{Lang|{{w|omurice}}|ja=オムライス|ja_rm=omuraisu|ja_lit=ome[lette] rice}}, fried rice wrapped in fried scrambled eggs, usually with tomato ketchup. It is one of the representative dishes of {{w|Yōshoku|''youshoku''}} (lit. "oversea dish"), or Western-influenced Japanese cuisine.
**One of the two competing theories for its origin claims omurice was inspired by {{Lang|chakin-zushi|ja=茶巾寿司}}, or sushi wrapped in a thin omelette. [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]]'s Special Dish, [[A Stunning Stratagem]], is made chakin-zushi style while its base dish, [[Bird Egg Sushi]], is made nigirizushi style.
