'''Secret Source Dragon Idols''' are an exploration mechanic in [[Natlan]]. 

They are a type of [[Secret Source Automaton]] that resembles a large, serpentine dragon with a segmented body made of stone blocks. Some segments have launchers that can shoot projectiles. These are known as [[Secret Source Dragon Cannon]]s, and are capable of attacking even when detached. Secret Source Dragon Idols may also be equipped with Secret Source Beam Cannons, which can be manually operated by the player to target [[Abyss]]al corrosion.

Secret Source Dragon Idols can be ridden, and are often used to carry the player to or through a location. It may be necessary to first subdue them by smashing their launchers.

The [[Vagrant Secret Source Dragon Idol]] is a one-time enemy of this type.
