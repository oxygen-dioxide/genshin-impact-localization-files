==Trivia==
* {{w|Fata Morgana (mirage)|Fata Morgana}} is a complex form of mirage visible right above the horizon line. The optical phenomenon occurs when the rays of light bend when they pass through layers of air at different temperatures.
** The name Fata Morgana translates to the italian {{w|Morgan le Fay}} or Morgan the Fairy, the Arthurian sorcesess, due to a belief that these mirages were fairy castles in the air or false land created by her witchcraft to lure sailors to death.
