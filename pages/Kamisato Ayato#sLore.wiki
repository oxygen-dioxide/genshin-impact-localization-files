==Personality==
{{Quote|The young but highly accomplished head of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan. Cultured and polite, he is a man of many ways and means.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
Ayato is a person that does not like to show his face in public often, preferring to work on his duties as the Yashiro Commissioner. A well-known fact about him is that he's extremely busy and stressed, as he has to deal with corrupt government officials while juggling his duty as the leader of the [[Shuumatsuban]]. Due to his duties, he loathes small talk, wanting people to get to the point. He uses a large array of methods to deal with corrupt officials, usually within legal bounds.

While he is not particularly well known due to his preference to remain behind the scenes, those who are familiar with him note that he is incredibly kind and has inspired loyalty from many people. For example, [[Hirotatsu]] states that he continues to serve the Yashiro Commission to repay the generosity that he showed him and his master and it is strongly implied that Ayato was the one who inspired Thoma to the point the latter received a [[Vision]]. Ayato has stated that he highly values loyalty and obedience (hence his preference for dogs), as strongly implied that there were numerous assassinations against him in the past, hence why he values those two traits so much to protect himself from rival clans and organizations.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/KxMs7IsSTgs Character Demo - "Kamisato Ayato: Fathomless Swirls in the Forest"]</ref><ref>{{Ref/VO|Kamisato Ayato|Interesting Things}}</ref>

Despite his succession as the family head at a young age, he appears to be a mature and determined man, notably even more than Ayaka, who's known for her steadfastness. Like Ayaka, Ayato cares for the well-being of the common people. He is also a family man, as he had taken the position of Commissioner per his parents' wishes to also protect Ayaka, stating that he would not forgive any who would harm his family and wanting to ensure that Ayaka had others to rely on when she needed it.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Wind Settles}}</ref> He also risked his life to smuggle the [[Watatsumi Army]] into [[Tenshukaku]] for the sake of doing a "small favor" for her.

Ayato is also known to be cunning and mischievous, as both [[Raiden Shogun|the Shogun]] and [[Yae Miko]] note him as unpredictable and tricky to understand, with the latter strongly disliking him as a result. Nonetheless, he is tolerated by both for upholding the Shogun's will for the former and their duties generally aligning for the latter. [[Hiratsuka]] notes that whenever he hangs out with Thoma, he ropes him into eating strange food, causing Thoma to become terrified whenever he sees him. Itto remarks that Ayato is a "warrior" with great charisma, and that the two are "on the same wavelength". He is also able to find [[Sayu]] with ease despite not appearing to have much ninja training, even though the rest of the [[Shuumatsuban]] have difficulty locating her.

==Appearance==

Ayato uses the [[:Category:Tall Male Characters|tall male]] model. He has long pale blue asymmetrical shoulder-length hair, pale skin, and light purple eyes. He also has a small mole under the left corner of his mouth.

{{Quote|The game of politics is fraught with peril. Saying too little is not good, but saying too much is also bad. But don't get me wrong, my Lord does not take any joy in these 'battles.' For him, it's just... a matter of duty.|[[Thoma]]}}
As the head of the [[Yashiro Commission]], Kamisato Ayato is committed to maintaining the prosperity and stability of the region.

At a glance, he is low-profile and graceful. He is not a fan of public appearances and does not seek to show his skills overtly.

But those who do know him understand that he is not to be underestimated. Long ago, when the Yashiro Commission fell on hard times, and when the [[Kamisato Clan]] was on the verge of crumbling, it was this young man who rose to the occasion and stabilized the situation.

He could not have achieved his position without extraordinary resourcefulness and cunning. But perhaps, that impenetrable smile belies darker waves.

However, the most intriguing thing is that in most of these negotiations in which he participates, he is not ruthless nor competitive, and is even willing to share the benefits so that everyone can get a relatively satisfactory piece of the pie.

"What exactly is he up to?" is usually what people are thinking after all is said and done.

However, now that everyone has a piece of that pie, perhaps what is on Kamisato Ayato's mind isn't so important.

Ayato went from being an elegant and refined princeling to "the poor young master of the Kamisato Clan" amongst the people, and "that greenhorn" amongst his political opponents.</p><p>Time, however, would prove these people wrong.</p><p>With extraordinary courage and some first-rate tactics, he did not leave the clan to languish. No, indeed, the Kamisato Clan's position would grow more stable than ever.</p><p>The heavy workload, malicious deceptions, and attempts to frame him at every turn he parried away, even turning them to his own advantage.</p><p>The passage of time has only increased the standing of the Yashiro Commission's Kamisato Clan in the Shogunate and with the people.</p><p>Today, Ayato is a clan head that a great house like the Kamisato Clan would be proud of, and a Yashiro Commissioner acknowledged by all.</p>

People come from different Commissions and clans, and their perspectives are very different. Any single task grows harder as the number of people involved grows.</p><p>Ayato's great strength lies in his ability to handle such matters. The way he sees it, people are driven by interest. Find leverage, and the other side will cooperate.</p><p>Find some goal that will bring the other party around to your logic, then pacify them with a few choice platitudes for the occasion, and most problems can be resolved.</p><p>And when dealing with the stubborn, one merely needs to appeal to a higher power to bear &mdash; after all, what mortal could gainsay the light of heaven itself, no matter how high their status or arrogant their attitude?</p><p>Over time, the knowledgeable and decorous Kamisato clan head gained quite the name for himself in the Shogunate.</p><p>"Hmm... this matter seems quite hard to handle. Should we ask the Yashiro Commissioner?"</p><p>So people would often say.</p><p>However, while Ayato is indeed full of ways and means, he will not simply help at any given moment.</p><p>Firstly, not every task is related to the Yashiro Commission. Secondly, it is simply not worth it for the Kamisato Clan to get itself involved for the sake of others' petty profit.</p><p>Mostly, Ayato will simply tag along as a junior figure, teacup in hand, doing little more than smiling.</p><p>"Ah, come now, Sir [[Nagaoka Hidemitsu|Nagaoka]]. We are all loyal servants of the Almighty Shogun. Nothing more to it. We just need to be open with each other, and I'm sure we can resolve this issue together."</p>

|text4         = <p>Being limited by his station and work, Ayato does not often appear in public, nor does he have much time for any sort of leisurely walk. However, these obstacles cannot hinder him from learning of new and interesting things.</p><p>Perhaps in the morning, he might spy one of the [[Yae Publishing House]] staff poking her head around the place, seemingly here to "report for work." In which case, he may as well pretend not to notice, all the better to hear what new methods she has for skipping work... and then "accidentally" let slip his newfound knowledge to [[Guuji Yae]].</p><p>In a meeting with those old fogeys at [[Tenshukaku]], there is no need to speak too quickly. After all, watching grown people argue till they are red in the face over petty issues is quite amusing.</p><p>While walking through the streets, he might suddenly consider a certain unique snack stand. Going up to the owner, he'd ask if they are selling anything new, how business is going, buy a drink or two to try... and if he finds it interesting, he'll buy a few back for the rest of the household.</p><p>Lately, he also lent some encouragement to the [[Arataki Itto|young oni]] who frequents [[Hanamizaka]] due to the latter's bug-fighting troubles &mdash; out of the goodness of his heart, of course. He also discovered that this crimson oni did not know what the name "Ayato" signified... which was fine, of course. No need to explain such things.</p><p>On the way home, he might pass [[Chinju Forest]] and see passers-by having tricks played on them by the [[bake-danuki]], in which case he will point the illusion out. If the bake-danuki should hone their changeling skills further on his account, why, they should thank him for the inspiration.</p><p>And of course, even one so talented as [[Thoma]] might sometimes struggle to think of what to make for dinner. Such occasions are perfect for a hot pot game! After all, Ayaka always puts the most unexpected things into the pot &mdash; and how proud he is of his sister for that!</p><p>Yes, these things are indeed the spice of the Yashiro Commissioner's life.</p>

The ink on the inkstone is never really properly kept, and one might even sometimes find chess pieces or cards under the table.</p><p>Each time the clan head gets off work, the servants always need some time to clean his study up.</p><p>In the process, they discovered that assorted notes are often clipped between these pages. Upon closer inspection, they are written in different hands, and their content also varies.</p><p>"Clan Head, the servants have sent a new batch of flowers. I have placed them in a flower vase in a corner of the table. Please take care not to knock it over again."</p><p>"Clan Head, a shrine maiden from the [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Faction)|Grand Narukami Shrine]] came over today, saying that the Lady Guuji wishes to see you. It seems important, as it involves the requisitioning of land in [[Ritou]]. She invites you to the Shrine to discuss the details."</p><p>"Lord Commissioner, the Momoyo flowers have not withered. The branches grow yet. Do not worry."</p><p>"Dear Brother, I learned a new recipe while attending festivities with the Traveler. Considering that {{MC|he|she|mc=1}} is from another land, do you think... that I might need to make some changes to said recipe?"</p><p>"Clan Head, the servants have been reluctant to tell you this, so allow [[Furuta|this old lady]] to say it. If you wish to eat something, please leave it to our [[Thoma|housekeeper]]. Also, please refrain from using the ingredients in the kitchen... How could we make you cook for yourself, after all?"</p><p>Ayato's work often sees him leaving home early and returning late. As such, the people of the [[Kamisato Estate]] will communicate with him through these means.</p><p>This was a method that Ayato came up with himself, and this is how the Kamisato household is run, via these small notes.</p><p>Unfortunately, their use has seen the clan head's already messy table become messier still...

That was the reason for its existence, and any service to the gods was a job, a matter of circumstance.</p><p>But such presumptuous words could never be said out loud, and in any case, Ayato could not bear to interrupt his mother when she looked so excited.</p><p>No matter how long she would go on, Ayato would always sit in front of her and listen in silence, even if his legs might fall asleep in the process.</p><p>With the passing of years, Ayato's days would be taken up by swordsmanship and books. The one giving the "lessons" was now his father, and the lesson content would turn from ritual affairs to matters that the clan's successor should be concerned with.</p><p>His duty to the clan would be something that would occupy yet more space in Ayato's life. Nor was the Raiden Shogun just a mere symbol as she was in his childhood. Now, she was the [[Ogosho]], the mighty defender of Inazuma's eternal peace.</p><p>"The Kamisato Clan stands today because of Narukami's mercy. As such, the Clan must defend the road to Eternity, and follow the Shogun eternally."</p><p>"This was our agreement, and it is the unchanging rule of our clan. Remember this well."</p><p>As for the specifics of what happened, Ayato had already gleaned some of them from reading their ancestral teachings. It was the Kamisato elders' failings that had resulted in the nationally-important Raiden Gokaden to suffer great loss. If not for Guuji Yae's intervention on their behalf, causing the Shogun to show them mercy, the Kamisato Clan may have joined others in falling from grace and ceasing to exist.</p><p>This was the grace of Her Excellency, and at the same time, it was a warning from Her servant.</p><p>As such, Ayato never snubbed his father's teachings. Though he still believed in protecting his clan above all else, he also understood that Inazuma was sustained by the Electro Archon's protection. Only peace in Inazuma could guarantee the longevity and prosperity of the clan.</p><p>No matter how things might change in Inazuma, the Kamisato Clan alone would never betray the Almighty Narukami.</p><p>Even if his heart said differently, he could only bury it deep beneath well-maintained appearances.</p><p>Just as his mother said back then&mdash;</p><p>"The divinely-protected cypress will sprout new leaves from ancient branches.</p><p>So, too, can the camellia in the courtyard remain fragrant even in the most bitter winter."</p>

As such, Ayato often receives excellent brushes as gifts during festivals or birthdays.</p><p>Some of the more speculative have even bought him exquisite and expensive quill pens from overseas.</p><p>Ayato has never attempted to clarify this matter, but instead had a lovely wooden case made in which he stores such stationery.</p><p>He has always been interested in all things new, and trying out these new pens is indeed fun.</p><p>Moreover, these gifts often say much about the person who sent them. Such information thus becomes one of the means by which Ayato can get a handle on them.</p><p>That said, though he claims to have bought this case to store stationery, there are three pens that Ayato has never placed inside it.</p><p>One of them, slim and well-crafted, is placed on his desk. It shows signs of some wear and tear, but it writes well, and is used for writing petitions.</p><p>The second is stored in a drawer at the bottom, its fine tip having seen much loving use in the past when Ayato was practicing calligraphy. Its beginner-friendly nature also saw it borrowed quite often by Thoma and Ayaka back in the day.</p><p>As for the third, it is stored deep within a wooden cabinet used to store antiques, sealed within a silk bag.

How was his swordsmanship progressing?</p><p>As Ayato replied, his father nodded with a smile, seemingly satisfied. Yet, his expression would quickly darken, as if there was something he wanted to, but could not say.</p><p>After much hesitation, and under his wife's melancholic gaze, his father would finally speak, his voice heavy:</p><p>"Ayato... Remember, no matter what happens to the Kamisato Clan in the future, you are our eldest son, Ayaka's elder brother... A successor the Kamisato Clan is proud to have."</p><p>After reminding his father to rest well, Ayato would take leave of his parents and return to his bedroom.</p><p>The moment he opened the door, he saw the shining Vision lying on his desk.</p><p>Ayato had heard since he was young that Visions are signs of the gods' favor, born of human wishes.</p><p>Since his youth, he had longed to become the family's pillar, not for any great work, but to ensure that the clan would prosper, and to protect them.</p><p>That this Vision should appear now... meant that, perhaps, the time had come for him to take up this burden.</p><p>So thinking, Ayato did not call for the servants to light the lamps. Instead, he merely sat down beside the table.</p><p>Many things flowed through his mind then like a tide:</p><p>His father was gravely ill, and his mother was also unwell. The clan was leaderless, and its competitors eyed its position and power hungrily, as they had for some time now.</p><p>His sister was still young, and he had to ensure that she grew up safely. The Shogunate courts were like a sea full of hidden reefs. One had to tread most carefully there...</p><p>They could not let go of the Shuumatsuban, command over which had passed down through the family for generations. As for the servants, some few might still be trusted should the Kamisato Clan's strength wane...</p><p>And as for Thoma, who had come from a different land, though he was a friend and useful ally both, would he consider other options should the Kamisato Clan truly fall?</p><p>These scattered thoughts would gradually straighten themselves out in Ayato's mind, and at their center was his still-unchanged conviction&mdash;</p><p>He would use any means at his disposal to secure the safety of his family and its future. Obstacles to that goal would be cleared away, no matter the cost.</p><p>That night, the Vision was the only light that accompanied him.</p><p>And when the first light of the next dawn alighted upon the desk, the young heir was already prepared to face the world.</p>

* The pattern on Ayato's coattails are {{w|camellias}}. Camellias are also heavily featured in his Elemental Burst animations.
* Ayato's [[Character Demo]] appears to take place during the {{Quest|Omnipresence Over Mortals}}, indicated by the fireworks, [[Sayu]] hiding behind some bushes near [[Tenshukaku]], as well as the mention of a resistance platoon.
** Fireworks were used as a distraction in order for Sayu to sneak into Tenshukaku to steal documents of collaboration between the [[Tenryou Commission]] and the [[Fatui]].
** The [[Watatsumi Army|Watatsumi Resistance]] arrived at Tenshukaku right after the [[Traveler]] and Paimon exited.

* {{Furnishing Mentions|Kamisato Ayato}}

===Etymology===
* {{Lang|Kamisato|ja=神里}} means "god's village", while {{Lang|Ayato|ja=綾人}} means "mature man", lit. "twill human". Kamisato can also be more broadly translated to mean "god's origin", which is similar to the word {{Lang|Genshin|ja=原神}} meaning "original god" or "origins of god".
* Ayato's constellation represents either a cypress or a type of oak. This ambiguity comes from the Chinese character {{Lang|"{{wt|柏}}"|zh=bǎi|ja=kashiwa|sort=zh,ja}}, which represents a cypress in Chinese but refers to a specific type of oak tree in Japanese. In both cases, these trees are regarded as sacred trees in Shinto that symbolize eternity, which is Inazuma's ideal.
** It may refer to the ''{{w|Chamaecyparis obtusa|hinoki}}'' trees in Japan, a type of cypress there known for its strength and resistance. Because of its durability, it is often used as wood materials for Shinto shrines. A scholar says the language of flowers associated with ''hinoki'' in the Japanese culture is "immortality" and "undying."<ref>Japanese Wikipedia: [https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/{{subst:#urldecode:%E3%83%92%E3%83%8E%E3%82%AD#%E5%90%8D%E5%89%8D}} ヒノキ (Hinoki)]</ref>
*** Ayato's constellation in the original Chinese version, {{zh|神守柏座}}, means "Divine Guardian Cypress Constellation." Similarly, it is translated as "Cypressus Custos" in the English localization, which is Latin for "Guardian Cypress."
** Alternatively, it may refer to the ''{{w|Quercus dentata|kashiwa}}'' oak trees (sometimes known as the daimyou oak in English). Being a large evergreen tree, it is often used as a symbol of longevity, from the family crests of priests and samurai to the traditional confectionary {{w|Kashiwa mochi|''kashiwa mochi''}}.
*** Due to the aforementioned difference in meaning of {{zh|柏}}, while the Japanese localization uses the same characters as the Chinese version, {{ja|神守柏座}} instead means the "Divine Guardian ''Kashiwa'' Constellation" in Japanese.
*** Furthermore, the Japanese version of his title, {{Lang|Pillar of Fortitude|ja=磐祭葉守|ja_rm=Bansai Hamori}}, roughly translates to "Hamori of Adamantine Ritual." Hamori ("Leaf-Guardian") is the name of the god of leaves in Shinto, who is said to reside in ''kashiwa'' oak trees.
