;(Approach Keqing and Xingqiu)
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 1 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Rest assured, all is quiet here in Qingce Village. Chongyun is guarding the outside, and I'm guarding the inside. Not a problem in sight.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 1 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Good. I've made some progress in my investigation as well.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 1 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Oh? What are you planning? Is it time to strike?
:{{DIcon}} Perfect timing!
:{{DIcon}} Count me in!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 1 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Traveler, Paimon, you are just in time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 1 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I looked everywhere and I found some clues regarding the Treasure Hoarders. Besides wagon tracks, I also came across bits and pieces of fireworks packaging scattered on the road.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 1 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Following those clues, I was able to finally locate the missing fireworks. But there was no sign of Treasure Hoarders.
:{{DIcon}} Hmm, did they run away?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 1 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' No, I think they might be just overly careless. I seem to have found the location where they've been stashing all their stolen goods. They must have thought it was well-hidden and deemed it unnecessary to post any guards.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 1 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' The amount of fireworks they've amassed there is astonishing. Not only did they steal the ones in Qingce Village but also from other locations, too. They've gathered all the stolen goods there.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 1 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I've asked the Millelith on guard at Qingce Village to report this to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. They will organize a search around that warehouse.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Now that the Millelith is involved, you don't need to handle this yourself anymore!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 1 keqing 08.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' The Treasure Hoarders are notoriously cunning, and they may even have lookouts. If they notice anything suspicious, they will move the fireworks and our single lead will be lost. I have to keep an eye on the situation.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, you're not really thinking that you can take all of them yourself, are you?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 1 keqing 09.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' No, I am not that reckless. I just want to investigate the case thoroughly.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 1 keqing 10.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' But now that I have your help, the idea is feasible...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you really are considering it!
:{{DIcon}} (We can't let Keqing try to handle this on her own.)
:{{DIcon}} They're just Treasure Hoarders, we can take 'em.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 1 keqing 11.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Okay, then there's no time to lose. Let's go.

;(Talk to Xingqiu again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj103 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Though they are merely a group of irksome bandits, please, exercise caution.

;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 3 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' These Treasure Hoarders must have returned to check on the stolen fireworks. <!-- NOTE: this voiceline is also silent in-game, for some reason (only in EN) -->
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 3 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Please hide yourselves. Let's wait and see what happens.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 3 treasurehoarderb 01.ogg}} '''Xiuyong:''' Hey Boss, you think we have enough fireworks now?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 3 treasurehoarderboss 01.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' Hah! Are you kidding? This ain't nowhere near enough!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 3 treasurehoarderb 02.ogg}} '''Xiuyong:''' Uh, but Boss, if we want more fireworks, we'll have to steal 'em in the city! Ain't gonna be easy...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 3 treasurehoarderboss 02.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' Hmm... You got a point. Alright, then we steal those things that make a real loud bang but don't light up real pretty... What do they call 'em? Ah yeah, firecrackers! Those'll do the job!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 3 treasurehoarderboss 03.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' All we need to do is make some real ruckus.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 3 treasurehoarderboss 04.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' As long as we distract the Millelith, the other hoarders can do their end of the job. You get it?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 3 treasurehoarderb 03.ogg}} '''Xiuyong:''' Got it, Boss! Hehe, I gotta hand it to ya, we're gonna hit the jackpot this time!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 3 treasurehoarderb 04.ogg}} '''Xiuyong:''' But, uh Boss... All our boys are out scouting around. Don't ya think we need a few more to guard the stash?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 3 treasurehoarderboss 05.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' Hey, don't worry about it. The Millelith are swamped with Lantern Rite, they won't have time to come out here. Alright, move it boys! Just a few more batches and we'll be...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 3 treasurehoarderb 05.ogg}} '''Junming:''' Uh-oh! Hey, Boss! We've got trouble!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 3 treasurehoarderboss 06.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' Huh!? What happened?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 3 treasurehoarderb 06.ogg}} '''Junming:''' The jig is up, Boss! Th&mdash;The Millelith are coming! And it seems they've already caught our scouts!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 3 treasurehoarderb 07.ogg}} '''Junming:''' If one of the boys hadn't set off a firework to warn us, we would've been completely blindsided! Boss, let's run!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 3 treasurehoarderboss 07.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' But how did the Millelith find out about us? And so quickly too!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 3 treasurehoarderboss 08.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' Arg, fine! Leave the fireworks and let's split! They won't be catching us!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 3 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' It's time to make our move! Ready?
:{{DIcon}} I'm ready!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go!

;(While fighting the Treasure Hoarders)
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 4 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Drop your weapons and surrender immediately!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 4 treasurehoarderboss 01.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' Hah! Get outta my way, you got a death wish or something? I'll show you...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 4 treasurehoarderboss 02.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' Huh? Wait a second...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 4 treasurehoarderboss 03.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' Y&mdash;You're... Lady Keqing, the Yuheng!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 4 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Hmph. So you do recognize me, then.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 4 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I'll say it one more time. Drop your weapon and surrender, now!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 4 treasurehoarderboss 04.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' Who woulda thought we'd run into the Yuheng all the way out here...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 4 treasurehoarderboss 05.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' Alright, hoarders! Looks like the Yuheng wants to play, we'll show you! Get 'em!

;(After defeating the Treasure Hoarders)
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Alright, so you want to do this the hard way.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 treasurehoarderboss 01.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' W&mdash;We surrender, Yuheng.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Now, I want some answers. What were you planning to do with the stockpile of fireworks?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 treasurehoarderboss 02.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' Uh, w&mdash;we just...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Tell the truth and I might go easy on you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 treasurehoarderboss 03.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' We... *sigh* Fine.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 treasurehoarderboss 04.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' We were gonna smuggle these fireworks into the city and ignite them during the Lantern Rite's opening ceremony.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 treasurehoarderboss 05.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' The fireworks are really bright and loud, and would definitely raise some havoc. We were gonna rob the city while everyone's distracted by the explosions.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 treasurehoarderboss 06.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' But, uh... We didn't seem to have enough fireworks, so...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Oh? So you mean you had more than one group of thieves stealing fireworks?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 treasurehoarderboss 07.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' Yeah, that's right... originally I had all the hoarders out stealing fireworks, but then one of them got caught by the Feiyun Commerce Guild and was arrested.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 treasurehoarderboss 08.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' I really didn't get it! Why did the Feiyun Commerce Guild get involved? We were only stealing from the government...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 treasurehoarderboss 09.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' No, what I meant is, uh... Well, I was worried that the guy who got arrested would rat us out.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 treasurehoarderboss 10.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' If word got out, we could lose everything. So I ordered most of our boys to come back.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 treasurehoarderboss 11.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' Who woulda guessed we'd end up runnin' into you like that...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Didn't one of you just say that the Millelith were coming, too?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 treasurehoarderb 01.ogg}} '''Junming:''' Yeah, that's right... I wonder how the Millelith found out we had dispatched scouts.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 treasurehoarderb 02.ogg}} '''Junming:''' They somehow captured almost all of them... If someone hadn't alerted us, we would all have been caught.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, you did get caught.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 treasurehoarderb 03.ogg}} '''Junming:''' Well... uh, yeah...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' It appears that the Millelith managed to get the captured Treasure Hoarder to talk.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' There may still be other Treasure Hoarders in the area. We should head elsewhere, just to be safe.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Traveler, please escort the Treasure Hoarders back to Qingce Village and hand them over to the Millelith stationed there.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 keqing 08.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I'll be there once I am finished inspecting this place.
:{{DIcon}} Understood, please be careful.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 5 keqing 09.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Yes, you too. I'll see you in Qingce Village.

;(Approach the village)
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 pengyi 01.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' *sigh* This is the last batch of fireworks that I can get. Please ensure that there will be no further problems.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 jingcheng 01.ogg}} '''Jingcheng:''' Don't worry, the Yuheng will be taking care of this personally. And with us on guard, I assure you it'll be safe.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Yes, indeed. Oh? It appears the Traveler has returned.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' And with two others, no doubt.
:{{DIcon}} They're the thieves who stole the fireworks.
:{{Black Screen|You tell everyone how the thieves were caught...}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' It's definitely dangerous to infiltrate an enemy area like that. If only I was there to fight alongside you...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 xingqiu 03.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Come now, we both know the Traveler is most capable. Hehe, but who would've known we performed such a noble deed... We had arrested the Treasure Hoarder earlier by mere happenstance.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! Talk about a coincidence!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 xingqiu 04.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' It seems that justice always finds its way into the world. It is in fateful moments that miracles are born.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 pengyi 02.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' So it was you! You horrible brutes are the ones who stole the fireworks!? Just the sight of you two makes my blood boil...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 jingcheng 02.ogg}} '''Jingcheng:''' Please, calm down. I doubt they'll be causing any more trouble now that they're in custody. Thank you very much, Traveler. But may I ask, why has Lady Keqing not returned with you?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lady Keqing was worried there'd be more Treasure Hoarders lurking about. She wanted to conduct a full search of the area.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 jingcheng 03.ogg}} '''Jingcheng:''' Oh, I see... Yes, Lady Keqing is quite thorough. A squad of Millelith came by just now. I believe they were sent by the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 jingcheng 04.ogg}} '''Jingcheng:''' I also heard that most of the fleeing Treasure Hoarders have already been apprehended, hopefully that will be the end of this matter.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 jingcheng 05.ogg}} '''Jingcheng:''' Anyway, you may leave these Treasure Hoarders to us. I will escort them back to the city and make sure they stand trial with the others.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 xingqiu 05.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' And thus our chapter has finally reached its timely conclusion. I am partial to fireworks myself, but I'm afraid we must also be leaving now.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Why the hurry to get back to the Feiyun Commerce Guild? Don't tell us you have work to do, too...
:{{DIcon}} Are you also busy these days, Xingqiu?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 xingqiu 06.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Inevitably, affairs do become busier around festive seasons. But no need to worry, we have many attendants to assist us... And there's always Chongyun, too.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Huh? You mean you're assigning more work to me?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 xingqiu 07.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' 'Tis only my duty as your dearest friend. Work before play, as they say. I am sure you understand.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Oh alright, I suppose...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 xingqiu 08.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' As the saying goes, "Many hands make light work." As long as work is assigned to the right people, everything will proceed without a hitch.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' If you ask me, I think speaking eloquently is just a guise for assigning work to everybody else.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 xingqiu 09.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Alright, alright. I shall treat you to a meal after the work is done!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 xingqiu 10.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Farewell, Traveler.
:{{Black Screen|Chongyun and Xingqiu leave with others from the guild.}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 pengyi 03.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' By the way, do you know when Lady Keqing will be back, Traveler?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 pengyi 04.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' There are not many fireworks in the second batch that I brought, so I'm worried that we can't achieve the show's desired effect. I was hoping we could somehow retrieve the stolen fireworks.
;(Fireworks shoots into the sky)
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, did you hear that explosion!? Maybe it was fireworks? *gasp* Or maybe more Treasure Hoarders!
:{{DIcon}} It came from Keqing's location!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no, maybe she ran into trouble! Let's go and help her!
;(Continue to next section)

;(Talk to Xingxiu again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj103 treasurehoarderboss 01.ogg}} '''Xingxiu:''' *sigh* I guess we're done for...

;(Talk to Junming again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj103 treasurehoarderb 01.ogg}} '''Junming:''' How did the Millelith find us so fast?

;(Talk to Jingcheng again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj103 jingcheng 01.ogg}} '''Jingcheng:''' Hmph, your hoarding days are over! How dare you cause trouble during Lantern Rite. You'll get what you deserve once we hand you over to the Ministry of Civil Affairs!

;(Talk to Pengyi again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj103 pengyi 01.ogg}} '''Pengyi:''' A burst of fireworks... Could it be the Treasure Hoarders? Oh Lady Keqing, please stay safe! It's up to you to find out what's happening, Traveler. Good luck!

:{{A|vo eqhdj103 11 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Oops, what did I do?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Keqing!
:{{DIcon}} Keqing!
:{{DIcon}} Wait, where are the Treasure Hoarders?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 11 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Huh? What Treasure Hoarders?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We heard an explosion and thought it might be Treasure Hoarders sending signals to one another again.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 11 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Ah, I see. Sorry, that's not the case. I saw a few sticks of fireworks on the ground, so I fiddled with them and...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 11 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Sure enough, it seems I accidentally lit the fuse. Before I could react, the fireworks were... *ahem* already up in the air.
:{{DIcon}} Oh, I see.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, no enemies? Well, that's good... We thought you might've been surrounded by bad guys!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 11 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I apologize, I didn't mean to alarm you. Fortunately, there are no more Treasure Hoarders in the area. It seems this matter has finally come to an end.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! The case of the stolen fireworks is finally solved, good thing we were able to get to the bottom of it!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 11 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Otherwise, those beautiful fireworks would have gone to waste and the whole show would be ruined.
:{{DIcon}} That's right.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 11 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' By the way, Keqing, you're the one in charge of the fireworks show, which means you know the best viewing spot, right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 11 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Yes, of course. The best view should be from the Jade Chamber.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 11 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Don't worry, I haven't forgotten my promise. But first, I have to drop by the Ministry of Civil Affairs and close this case.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 11 keqing 08.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Leave the rest of this to me, you've already been a great help. Why don't you go for a walk around the city and I'll meet you when I am done?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 11 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay... But we'll be waiting for you!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 11 keqing 09.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Yes, I'll be there.
:{{Black Screen|Keqing leaves...}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 11 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* Keqing really is super busy.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 11 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "I'll meet you when I am done." How many times have we heard that already?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 11 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Now Paimon gets why Lady Ningguang is so worried about Keqing. If she keeps working like this, she really will miss the Lantern Rite.
:{{DIcon}} Hmm, let's go find Zhongli.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 11 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh yeah, we said we would meet him! And we've even collected a few opinions about taking a rest from work.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 11 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Zhongli said he'd wait for us at Third-Round Knockout. Let's go find him!

:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' You are welcome, Ms. Yun. Your willingness to hear suggestions is indeed impressive. It's no wonder your opera performance has only been getting better.

:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 yunjin 03.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Hmm? You are also acquaintances?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yes, we sure are!
:{{DIcon}} We've met on a couple of occasions.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 yunjin 04.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Not everyone gets the privilege of meeting someone so knowledgeable and discreet as Mr. Zhongli.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 yunjin 05.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' You are indeed well-connected, Traveler.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I am flattered, Ms. Yun. It is an honor for an ordinary person like myself to have met the Traveler.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, did he really just say that...
:{{DIcon}} (I wouldn't dare reveal his true identity.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 yunjin 06.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' I'm sure you must have matters to discuss. I have an appointment with Xinyan, so if you'll excuse me, I'll take my leave.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Very well. Goodbye, Ms. Yun.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' See you around, Yun Jin!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' So, tell me, what have you learned from your trip?
:{{DIcon}} We asked around, and...
:{{Black Screen|You tell Zhongli about everyone's views on work-life balance...}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Hmm, I see. Well, Traveler, what do you make of all their opinions?
:{{DIcon}} I think we can weave them into a story.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! Paimon already started creating her own story on the way here. The goal is to convince Keqing to rest more with just a simple story, right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If that's the case, then Paimon thinks we can use food as our theme!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Think about it, who doesn't like delicious food? And when it comes to eating, everyone has an opinion. It's the perfect angle for our story!
:{{DIcon}} Simple but deep.
:{{DIcon}} Classic Paimon wisdom.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon knows just what to write!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's say there's a chef in Liyue who's very talented at cooking.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He opens a massive restaurant in Liyue Harbor, and lots of customers come every day, so he's always super busy.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then, well... hmm... How should the story go from there?
:{{DIcon}} His food starts getting worse and worse?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that's good! But wait, didn't we say he's really good at cooking? That wouldn't make sense...
:{{DIcon}} It's up to you, it's your story!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' There's no need to jump to the conclusion. Why don't you elaborate more on the chef?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' More about the chef... You mean both good and bad things?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Yes. To gain one's empathy, there must be familiarity. I would like to understand this chef character of ours a little deeper.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, Paimon didn't think this far... Why don't you take it from here, {{Traveler}}?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Since you've spoken with others familiar with Keqing, why don't we integrate their thoughts into your story? That will allow it to become all the more convincing.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay! Let Paimon think... What did Cloud Retainer say?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "As one sows, so do they reap, and the joy of reaping is what one yearns for."
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' That was quite poetic, Paimon. Bravo.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe! Oh! Now Paimon remembers! Cloud Retainer said that if she spends all her efforts working on a machine with no time to test the outcome...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then she'd be like a chef who doesn't get to try their own food. Problems are bound to pop up.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Yes, it is most unwise to put the cart before the horse.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh-huh, that's exactly what she said! So let's make that happen to the chef in the story... He's great at cooking, but he can't enjoy his own food.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Hmm, but there must be a reason why he doesn't partake in the delicacies he makes.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right, it's because he's super busy! He receives the customers, he takes the orders, and he does all the cooking himself...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, that should keep him busy enough. He's so busy every day that he doesn't even have time to take a break, which obviously also means he doesn't have time to eat.
:{{DIcon}} That sounds a bit extreme...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, it's just a story! Besides, it's supposed to leave a powerful impression, kinda like fireworks!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 zhongli 13.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Yes, the chef is unwilling to delegate tasks to others. He's overconfident about his own cooking abilities, and tries to accomplish everything on his own.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 24.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon already kinda feels sorry for him.
:{{DIcon}} "Many hands make light work!"
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 25.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, right! That's what the chef doesn't understand!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 26.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And there's another saying... erm... What was it, again?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 27.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh yeah, "A rested worker is an efficient worker!" That's what Yanfei said.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 28.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So the chef gets busier and busier. To the point where he can't stand up straight anymore and has big dark circles under his eyes. The customers tell him to take a few days off to get some rest, but the chef won't listen.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 zhongli 14.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' His judgment is clouded by the chores before him. He is oblivious to mountains in the distance, the bigger picture.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 29.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eventually, the chef falls ill and his cooking becomes far worse than when he started. The customers can't convince him to rest and they don't like his cooking anymore, so they stop coming to his restaurant.
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} The consequences of not getting enough rest are pretty serious.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 zhongli 15.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Rest is always of great importance. Although we may come across various difficulties in our lives, pushing ourselves is never a good modus operandi.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 zhongli 16.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The story is simple without embellishment, yet deeply meaningful. If our listener is sensible, then she should quickly grasp the meaning contained within.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 30.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're saying... Paimon made a good story!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 zhongli 17.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Sincerity can allow one to see clearly, and earnest advice can provide sound direction. The story is indeed good.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 zhongli 18.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The Yuheng is an adroit leader. I am certain she will understand the message you are trying to convey.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 31.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Score one for Paimon!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 zhongli 19.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Given that the case involving the Treasure Hoarders has come to an end, she is inevitably tired. Now will be the ideal moment to speak with her.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 zhongli 20.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' If all goes well, I think your story will be a success.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 32.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hear that? Zhongli says Paimon's story has what it takes! If anyone knows a good story, he does!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 12 paimon 33.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Quick, let's go find Keqing!

;(Talk to Zhongli again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj103 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I wish you luck, Traveler.

----
;(Approach the Ministry of Civil Affairs)
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 14 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' The matter has finally come to an end, but we mustn't lower our guard. Increase patrols around Qingce Village and coordinate our people at other fireworks locations to prevent any further theft.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 14 jingcheng 01.ogg}} '''Jingcheng:''' Yes, Lady Keqing.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 14 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' And by the way, the Ministry has requested the Millelith to increase security along travel routes. How is that proceeding?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 14 jingcheng 02.ogg}} '''Jingcheng:''' It's all been taken care of. However, due to various reasons, there are still some blind spots in the city.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 14 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Have we drafted a new patrol map? Please give me a copy and I'll look it over when I have time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 14 jingcheng 03.ogg}} '''Jingcheng:''' Understood! The patrol map is still being drafted, but it will be ready soon.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 14 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Okay. Also, I...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 14 jingcheng 04.ogg}} '''Jingcheng:''' Oh, excuse me, Lady Keqing... Your friends are here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hi Keqing, still working? Aren't we going to see the fireworks?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 14 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Oh, yes, but I thought we'd meet at the Jade Chamber. Why have you come here?
:{{DIcon}} You told us to walk and have a look around.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 14 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, we walked around the city just like you told us to, it's very nice. But, it would be even nicer if you could join us! Do you still have work to do?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 14 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' It's nothing urgent, really, just some trivial matters. But I wish to get it done as soon as possible...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 14 jingcheng 05.ogg}} '''Jingcheng:''' You can leave it to us, Lady Keqing. You've been working hard for a long time, so you should get some rest. If I'm not mistaken, the Traveler is here to remind you to take a break.
:{{DIcon}} And we have something to tell you, Keqing.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 14 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's right! Something so important that we must speak with you personally, right now!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 14 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Oh, really? In that case... Jingcheng, I'll let you take charge, thank you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 14 jingcheng 06.ogg}} '''Jingcheng:''' Understood, I'll handle things from here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 14 keqing 08.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Traveler and Paimon, let's go to the Jade Chamber. The view there is nicer and it's much more private, perfect for talking.
<!-- Jingcheng's talk cannot be accessed even with force closing the game. {{A|vo dialog eqhdj103 jingcheng 02.ogg}}-->
:{{Black Screen|You go up to the Jade Chamber with Keqing...}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Well, here we are.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' What was it you wanted to talk about?
:{{DIcon}} We have a story to tell you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! We want to tell you a story from this beautiful view. Whaddya say?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Alright, I'm listening.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, it turns out we just heard some big news in Teyvat! A very talented chef is in trouble!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Oh? Is the chef from Liyue? From [[Liuli Pavilion]] or [[Xinyue Kiosk]], perhaps?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, no. Uh, the chef is from... [[Mondstadt]]! Yeah, and he's really, really good!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He had a restaurant right next to the city gate. He was super efficient and his cooking was really delicious, so his restaurant had been getting more and more popular.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' In fact, he became so busy that the worker from the florist next door asked him, "Sir, why don't you find someone to help you in the restaurant?"
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But the chef brushed the idea aside, saying that he's the only one that can turn top-quality ingredients into world-class dishes, no one could help him.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Hmm. Well, confidence is an essential trait for a good chef. He must be an excellent cook.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's what everyone was saying... But surprisingly, after just six months, no one would dine in his restaurant anymore.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Oh?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Shocking, right? Do you have any guess why?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Hmm. Maybe the chef had fallen ill, or...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wrong answer! You tell her, {{Traveler}}!
:{{DIcon}} Because he was too stubborn.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ding ding ding! Yep, it's because the chef was too stubborn!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He would keep himself busy every day, and try to make the most delicious dishes for all his guests. But, he forgot that he's only human and needs time to eat and rest.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He was so busy that he didn't even have time to eat and couldn't even taste his own cooking.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He was unwilling to seek help even when he's tired, because he thought he's the only one capable of cooking the best dishes.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eventually, the people around him felt like they couldn't help him anyway, so they just left. And because he had forgotten the original taste of his dishes, he was no longer a good chef.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' In the end, his restaurant had no choice but to close for good.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 08.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Oh...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 09.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I see. He's overly confident, which disappoints the people around him, and he's so impatient that he ends up losing sight of his original purpose.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 10.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' *sigh*...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 11.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' So, that's the whole story?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, umm... Yep, that's the whole thing.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, it's not a very good story.
:{{DIcon}} Please don't laugh at us.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Didn't you just say that Paimon made a great story!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 12.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Hmm? Did you come up with that story?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! N&mdash;No, we just, uh...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 13.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Heh...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 14.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Hmm, how should I describe it... The story is very simple, and I suppose the ending isn't really surprising.
:{{DIcon}} Huh!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 15.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Think before you act and don't overexert yourself. Of course, I understand these concepts in theory, but when tasks come to me personally, it is easy to lose sight of the bigger picture.
:{{DIcon}} It's as if "your judgment is clouded," right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 16.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Yes. Up in the mountains, we can see the mist in the clouds. Out in the ocean, we can see fog on the sea. That's why from time to time, we need to examine where we are, remove the fog, and feel our heart.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, how do you feel now, Keqing?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 17.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' How do I feel?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 18.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 19.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Deep down inside, I wish I could slow down time. That way, I could finally take the opportunity to walk around the city, see the people I wish to see, and watch the fireworks.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 26.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Thinking back, I used to be even more impatient. My colleagues would resign after just three months of working with me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 27.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' You're completely right. It's important to know your boundaries.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 28.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' But, I am getting better! You can tell, can't you?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 20.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' And I did make a promise with you, didn't I?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 21.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' We agreed to enjoy the fireworks show together this year. So...
:{{DIcon}} So...?
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 22.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Happy Lantern Rite, Traveler and Paimon, I'm very happy to be here and enjoy this moment together with you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 23.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I've poured all my best effort into this fireworks show. And now that we're here, I sincerely hope you will enjoy it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 24.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I feel very fortunate to be right here, enjoying the fireworks, and enjoying the view of Liyue Harbor.
:{{DIcon}} Happy Lantern Rite, Keqing.
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Happy Lantern Rite!
:{{A|vo eqhdj103 16 keqing 25.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Happy Lantern Rite. And... thank you.

===Chongyun and Xingqiu===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Xingqiu at Qingce Village, nearby [[Dongdong]])
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 10 chongyun 01.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Hmm... With everything that's happened on the way here, I feel like we're forgetting something...
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 10 xingqiu 01.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Chongyun, just look at the stunning scenery of the Qingce Village. If I could sum it up in one word... Would you say "exquisite" does it justice? I think that&mdash;
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 10 chongyun 02.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Ah, I remember now! What about the demons?
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 10 chongyun 03.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Quick, Xingqiu, get the ancient texts out. There isn't a moment to lose.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 10 xingqiu 02.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Careful now, Chongyun, let's not rush into this. Just as tea is to be imbibed one sip at a time, these things must be done step by step. If we are too hasty and end up with enemies on all sides, even we, with our level of martial prowess, may find ourselves overpowered.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 10 chongyun 04.ogg}} '''Chongyun:''' Hmm... You do have a point. Alright then. I'll take you at your word, again.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 10 xingqiu 03.ogg}} '''Xingqiu:''' Excellent. Now then, what was I talking about? Huh, now I've lost my train of thought. Help me, Chongyun, what was I saying?

:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 3 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' What did you think of this year's fireworks display?
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 3 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I just hope this festival can be everything that people want it to be.
:{{DIcon}} They were lovely.
:{{DIcon}} I liked them a lot.

:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 3 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Anyway... If you have any time during the festival, take a look around the city. There's a lot to see, but it won't last. So make the most of it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 3 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' If only I had a little more free time... I'd love to take you around and show you everything we did to make the city look special during the festival.

;(Talk to Yun Jin at Qingce Village, nearby [[Granny Ruoxin]])
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 12 yunjin 01.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Oh, {{Traveler}}! I didn't expect to run into you in Qingce Village, of all places.
:{{DIcon}} I was a little worried when I couldn't find you in the city...
:{{DIcon}} How have you been lately?
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 12 yunjin 02.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Thanks for your concern. I'm touched.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 12 yunjin 03.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' A few days ago, Granny Ruoxin invited me to come out here and give a performance. It's mostly old folks and children who live out this way, so I didn't know whether it would be to their tastes. But everyone seemed to enjoy it, so I'm very proud of myself.
:{{DIcon}} How do you know Granny Ruoxin?
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 12 yunjin 04.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' She was a famous opera singer in her youth, too. She's still got it, if you ask me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 12 yunjin 05.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' In show business, while you're onstage, you constantly have to be in control of everything you're doing to manage your image. So when you're offstage, it's a relief to finally loosen up a litte.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 12 yunjin 06.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' I have some excellent tea here. Would you care to stay for some refreshments before you depart?
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 12 yunjin 07.ogg}} '''Yun Jin:''' Watching the Xiao Lanterns from the village is quite a unique experience in its own right. If you'd like, I can tell you all about it.

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Day 1 - Talk to Zhongli at [[Third-Round Knockout]])
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 13 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' We meet again, Traveler.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 13 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' What a rare opportunity to meet with you here in Liyue during this finest of festivals, as busy as you are on your travels.
:{{DIcon}} Happy Lantern Rite! How are you celebrating?
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 13 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' As you can see, I'm ambling the streets at my leisure, enjoying the sound of people chattering and birds chirping.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 13 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Wangsheng Funeral Parlor has been somewhat idle as of late, so I am presently unoccupied.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 13 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' When the director is out visiting friends, I take the opportunities to head out myself. Habit dictates that my first port of call is here, where I order myself a pot of tea, and listen to the storyteller.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 13 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' As festival times, the storyteller will always select a few new passages that complement the spirit of the season.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 13 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Most are variations on existing legends or accounts from folk history. Their historicity is questionable at times, but it is their entertainment value that makes them an excellent choice for the festive period.
:{{DIcon}} I know exactly what you mean.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 13 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Hahaha, then it seems you are becoming rather familiar with the [[Iron Tongue Tian|storyteller]] at this establishment.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 13 zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Time marches forward relentlessly... People change, traditions change...
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 13 zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Lantern Rite is no exception.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 13 zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' In times of old, Liyue was constantly at war. People lit lanterns and sent them into the sky to help guide the warriors on the distant front back to their home.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 13 zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Today, we live in a time of peace, and the custom of releasing lanterns has become ceremonial in nature. For the people of Liyue, the ritual of lighting lanterns every year symbolizes the undying spirit of heroism.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 13 zhongli 13.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The things that refuse to be shaken by the passage of time... those are Liyue's roots.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 13 zhongli 14.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Traveler, I hope that you are able to celebrate the Lantern Rite together with the people of Liyue.
:{{DIcon}} What about you? Do you have any plans?
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 13 zhongli 15.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Plans... not a notion that can be easily applied to me anymore. I am a man of leisure. I simply go wherever I am inclined, wherever that may be.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 13 zhongli 16.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Although, now that you mention... Yes, I should make the most of this festive period by venturing to parts of Liyue that lie beyond the harbor.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 13 zhongli 17.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I began with tea at Third-Round Knockout today... perhaps tomorrow I shall try somewhere else in the near vicinity.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 13 zhongli 18.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It is quite a joy to be idle and explore this bustling city at my leisure.

;(Day 2 - Talk to Zhongli on the street in front of [[Hanfeng's Ironmongers]])
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 14 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Oh? You're here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 14 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I do apologize, another matter was occupying my mind just now.
:{{DIcon}} What are you looking at?
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 14 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Hanfeng's Ironmongers has a long history. Ownership has been passed down from generation to generation, and today it is known as the most reputable blacksmith in the land.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 14 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The art of forging prizes precision and diligence. The tasks of forging weapons and processing ore require a great deal of time and patience.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 14 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' To most, the sound of iron being struck with a hammer is loud and intrusive. But to those who appreciate this art form, it is like the toll of a bell. Breathtaking, and transfixing.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 14 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The sound of metal clashing with metal causes one to fall quiet, calms one's spirit, focuses one's attention, and then, with a mind emptied of unwanted thoughts, devote oneself fully to the work at hand.
:{{DIcon}} It sounds like you are talented in forging, too.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 14 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Any talent I possess comes not from natural inclination, but out of necessity. In times of war, weapons are indispensable equipment, and highly sought after.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 14 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The wondrous ley lines of Liyue produce all manner of exquisite ore. It follows naturally that distinguished artisans and prized wares arise in response.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 14 zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' But I have always thought that a craftsman's ingenuity is far more valuable than any precious stone. The most accomplished in their craft do not limit themselves to working exclusively with rare ores.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me more about famous Liyue craftspeople.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 14 zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Well, Traveler... After your long sojourn in Liyue, I trust you will have heard of the houses of Kun and Yun?
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 14 zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The [[Kun Family|house of Kun]] is a long-established name in the art of forging. To this day, their descendants continue their craft.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 14 zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The [[Yun Family|house of Yun]] did not limit themselves to this craft. They branched out into many different disciplines and districts. Their descendants today still uphold the work ethic taught within their family for generations: "Even ostensible perfection can oft be improved upon through diligence." This has contributed towards their excellence in numerous fields.
:{{DIcon}} Wait... Is this the same "Yun" as in "Yun Jin"?
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 14 zhongli 13.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Ah, so you are acquainted with Miss Yun. Yes, the talented Yun Jin of Liyue operatic fame is indeed a descendant of the historic house of Yun.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 14 zhongli 14.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Her ancestors changed professions long ago. It was her father's generation that dedicated themselves to the performing arts. In this day and age, the Yun family's history has been forgotten, and nobody knows of the connection they once had to the art of forging.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 14 zhongli 15.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The evolution of families over the ages has been a profound force in shaping Liyue's history. While you're here, if you have the time, you may find learning about the human history of Liyue to be illuminating.
:{{DIcon}} It seems I still have a lot to learn.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 14 zhongli 16.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Much that you might want to know can be found in books.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 14 zhongli 17.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Even books change over the generations, causing discrepancies between their contents and the historical facts. But books can function as a mirror for humanity. Reading is the noblest of pastimes &mdash; there is always some benefit to be derived.

;(Day 3 - Talk to Zhongli at [[Wanwen Bookhouse]])
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 15 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Ah, I wondered if I might run into you again. This makes the third day in a row... perhaps it is fate rather than coincidence.
:{{DIcon}} Are you doing some reading?
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 15 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Yes. After our conversation yesterday, I thought I might visit the bookhouse and see what constitutes popular literature these days.
:{{DIcon}} There's a lot of books in Liyue.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 15 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Indeed. Traveler, do you know anything of the origins of books in Liyue?
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 15 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' First, people ground wood into pulp to make paper. For ease of reading, they began binding sheets together to make what we now call "books."
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 15 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Later, they developed movable-type printing to improve the speed and quality of production. Eventually, the technology developed to the point where books like those we see here can easily be produced in great quantities.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 15 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' There has been a proliferation of literary genres and works since that time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 15 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Traveler, is there any book from Liyue that has made a particularly strong impression on you?
:{{DIcon}} There's a series called "[[Rex Incognito]]."
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 15 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Oh? So, you've read it too.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 15 zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The author does not lack for ideas. Sometimes, they move in strange directions, and even I cannot claim to fully understand their meaning. But it makes for fresh and interesting reading material, a lot like reading somebody else's biography.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 15 zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Gods and adepti are far removed from the mortal experience. That they are difficult to portray in writing is no surprise.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 15 zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It is true that the Geo Archon, [[Morax]] would journey in the mortal realm from time to time. But there was not quite so much ostentatious shapeshifting as the books would have you believe.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 15 zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' When the goal is to wander the streets undetected, donning an overly elaborate disguise is somewhat self-defeating.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 15 zhongli 13.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Such discrepancies illustrate the difference between history as it happened and folk accounts based on hearsay. The value of reading accounts penned by others is in the chance to view the world through their eyes. It is very often an unfamiliar sight, though never an uninteresting one.
:{{DIcon}} I've also read one called "[[Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti]]."
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 15 zhongli 14.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Ah, yes. A memorable work indeed.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 15 zhongli 15.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I have heard that this is an unpopular book due to its often impenetrable prose. And yet, the [[yaksha]]s described in it are real historical figures.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 15 zhongli 16.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' They were loyal servants of Liyue. They lived through a bitter war and sacrificed much. All of Liyue, from harbor to chasm, is indebted to the yakshas for their protection over the years.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 15 zhongli 17.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I believe you have seen one of these yakshas in the flesh.
:{{DIcon}} Xiao.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 15 zhongli 18.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Yes... These days, he often appears at [[Dihua Marsh]].
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 15 zhongli 19.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' He is given to solitude. But I suspect that he would not turn away a reliable companion such as yourself.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 15 zhongli 20.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Should you happen to see him, please pass on my season's greetings.

;(Day 4 - Talk to Zhongli at the viewing deck of [[Wangshu Inn]])
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 16 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' "Where the clear blue water runs into the sky, and an ocean of silvergrass stretches out before the eye." That was written about Dihua Marsh.
:{{DIcon}} Are you enjoying the view?
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 16 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' From an altitude, the sight of reeds on the water, rustling gently in the breeze, is indeed a sight beautiful beyond compare.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 16 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Wangshu Inn is located in the heart of Dihua Marsh, and provides the finest in both food and scenery. It is no wonder that travelers are fond of staying here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 16 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' But Wangshu Inn is no mere guesthouse.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 16 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It was built tall to provide superior visibility for surveying the surrounding terrain. And it was built here, on this road, because it is one of the main routes for traffic into the region.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 16 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' This is a strategic location that must be defended at all costs.
:{{DIcon}} No wonder Xiao is here so often.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 16 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Yes. That is one of the primary reasons that he frequents the inn.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 16 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Looking southeast from here, one can see all the way to [[Guyun Stone Forest]].
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 16 zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' With gods lying sealed beneath those rocks, the area is frequently afflicted with monster activity. Xiao often goes back and forth between here and Guyun.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 16 zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Being constantly on the move must be tiring for him. My purpose in coming here was to give him a few words of comfort, but to my surprise, I did not find him on the roof...
:{{DIcon}}  He must be busy with his duties.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 16 zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Perhaps so. Nevertheless, this trip was by no means a waste. Besides, there shall be no shortage of opportunities to meet in the future.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 16 zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' On the subject of Wangshu Inn, the chef here is highly talented.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 16 zhongli 13.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' If I recall correctly, there was a cooking competition hosted in Liyue Harbor during the [[Moonchase Festival]]. This chef was selected to represent the Dihua Marsh region, entered the finals, and took second prize.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 16 zhongli 14.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Culinary excellence should always be shared far and wide.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 16 zhongli 15.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Hmm... Being up so high reminds me of another lofty location.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 16 zhongli 16.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Yes... one that the adepti once took control of, long ago. It then fell into disuse. Whether anyone tends to it these days, I do not know...
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 16 zhongli 17.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Alright then. That is where I shall go tomorrow.

:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 17 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Here above the clouds, where the moon sets and the sun rises before your eyes, one's sense of time becomes indistinct.
:{{DIcon}} This is Cloud Retainer's place, right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 17 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Indeed.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 17 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' You have encountered her several times, correct?
:{{DIcon}} She is quite wondrous, even for an adeptus.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 17 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' You possess a wealth of knowledge and experience, and you have goodness in your heart. Naturally, you are able to have friendly interactions with her.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 17 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Cloud Retainer is an expert in the mechanical arts, and an avid inventor.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 17 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Generous and kind, honest and forthright... I treasure her as both a friend and teacher, the likes of whom are hard to come by.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 17 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' An old friend once said to me that if you ever have a question on the most trivial of affairs, two hours conversing with Cloud Retainer will leave you better informed than three days and nights talking to every soul in the harbor.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 17 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Traveler, would you say you agree?
:{{DIcon}} Hit the nail on the head.
:{{DIcon}} There's some truth to it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 17 zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Hahaha. Yes, Cloud Retainer does not waste words, but this is no bad thing. She may say that she prefers to keep her distance from the mortal realm, but in fact she cares deeply for humanity.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 17 zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Ahh... I believe I have gazed at the mountains long enough. Time for a change of scenery.

:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 18 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Compared to the constant hubbub of Liyue Harbor, it is far more serene here.
:{{DIcon}} Yep, it's so quiet here.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 18 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It is a pleasant and leisurely atmosphere, not unfit for a festival.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 18 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' On the way over, I saw grandparents preparing meals, children learning to make Xiao Lanterns... It was quite nostalgic for me. It took me back to the very earliest days of Liyue's history.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 18 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Back then, most able-bodied adults were busy supporting the war effort or helping to build the city. Like now, the oldest and youngest supported each other, living humble lives.
:{{DIcon}} It sounds like they had it rough...
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 18 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Indeed, their lives were not easy. But the people of Liyue have tenacity and optimism in their bones.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 18 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' They will never stop striving for progress, no matter how much destitution they face.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 18 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' In ancient times, Qingce Village was once ravaged by the [[Chi]]. It is now several thousand years since it was put to rest.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 18 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Over the millennia, people built dwellings and worked the fertile land, creating the spectacular view we now see today.
:{{DIcon}} I heard a story about the Chi's corpse...
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 18 zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' ...That after it died, its body became the rocky mountains and flowing waters of Qingce. I, too, have heard this story.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 18 zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The idea is captivating. Though, I'm afraid, it is pure fantasy.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 18 zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Lofty mountains have stood and spring water has flowed here since time immemorial. That people now inhabit this place is solely because they have toiled to make it so.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 18 zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Qingce's verdant hills and stunning waters paired with the tranquil atmosphere here make it a place of extraordinary beauty. A rare blessing indeed.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 18 zhongli 13.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Oh, one of the villagers generously gifted me with some fresh [[Bamboo Shoot]]s. They will add some seasonal flavor to a meal on my return to Liyue Harbor.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 18 zhongli 14.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Seasonal bamboo shoots are yet another rare blessing offered by Qingce Village.

:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 19 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The people of Liyue today are busier than ever before. Yet still they head home when the festival season comes, no matter how long the journey takes, just for the chance to sit around the stove and share a joyful time with their loved ones.
