'''Krosl''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in the World Quest [[A Teapot to Call Home: Part I]].

He is a [[Snezhnaya]]n merchant who sought [[Smaragdus Jadeite]] to make hairpins, leading [[Yanfei]] and the [[Traveler]] to seek him out for the rare ore.

==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
''(To be added.)''

===Personality===
Krosl is a merchant at heart. He is determined to make a successful sale with rare and expensive materials, but is unaccustomed to legal troubles. After his fellow merchants learned of his purchase, he was pressured to rent hairpins made of Smaragdus Nephrite as he was fearful of the reprisal if word leaked that he sold a fake product. Likewise, when confronted with the threat of being investigated by the authorities, he confessed that the hairpins were fake to avoid further troubles.

He is also unaccustomed to surprises; when [[Zhiqiao]], the person he loaned the hairpins to, offered a joint partnership instead of demanding compensation, he was caught off-guard as he told her to wait while he thought about it.
