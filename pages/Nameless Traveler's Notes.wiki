==Dialogue==
===Nameless Traveler's Notes (I)===
Located at the Eastern Furnace.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:(This sheet of paper has already gone yellow with age. The scribbled words on it read as follows...)
:They say that the one legends call the [[Och-Kan|Python King]], the Sacred Lord of Transgression, and the Lord of the [[Ochkanatlan|Cinder City]] once used the ancient [[dragon]]s' legacy to create this "[[Tonatiuh|city above the city]]."
:I do not know how he did it... but the woven scrolls I've found speak of [[Perfect Heart of the Sacred Dragon|a jade heart beneath the earth]], as well as hollows that connect to the surface.
:This should be one of those "hollows."
:If the records are correct, this place was once home to... Well, more devices, but it looks empty now.
:Looks like I'll have to continue my search elsewhere.
:They say that [[Copan|the founder]] of the [[Saurian Relics Association (Faction)|Saurian Relics Association]] once came to this place. It would be nice if I could find something of value here...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Nameless Traveler's Notes (II)===
Located at the Southeastern Furnace.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:(This sheet of paper has already gone yellow with age. The scribbled words on it read as follows...)
:It is evident that this place was originally intended to supply energy to this city of ashes...
:But it appears that something must have occurred to cause this function to cease.
:Though there are signs of a battle here, the main structure of the buildings here have not been damaged. As such, battle damage did not cause the cessation. This seems more like the result of human operation.
:They say that the only master of Ochkanatlan, who has dominion over the entire city, may freely operate this giant city of machinery, as well as those modified [[Source Mechanism]]s...
:But why, then, did he shut off the supply of energy to Ochkanatlan?
:Did someone else do it? Is there someone else apart from the Python King Och-Kan who can command these devices?

===Nameless Traveler's Notes (III)===
Located in the Furnace of Fiery Embers (I): Lower Level.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:(This sheet of paper has already gone yellow with age. The scribbled words on it read as follows...)
:"Hollow" is the term that the scrolls, at least, use to describe this huge structure that surrounds the city.
:But it seems evident from my investigation that these "hollows" actually precede Ochkanatlan itself.
:Rather than say that these were built around Ochkanatlan to supply the city with energy...
:One should say, instead, that Och-Kan piggybacked off these devices and built his new city atop [[Chichen Uctokah|the original one]], which had been built by the ancient dragons...
:This might also explain why the scale of the underground areas, and some of the surface ones too &mdash; such as the width of the roads, or the size of the buildings &mdash; are as they are, seeming to have been built for beings that dwarf the average human.

===Nameless Traveler's Notes (IV)===
Located in the Furnace of Fiery Embers (III): Ancient Ruins.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:(This sheet of paper has already gone yellow with age. The scribbled words on it read as follows...)
:I found some discarded records. They may have been left behind by people most ancient indeed.
:Hah. Well, perhaps my records, too, will one day be regarded by people from the future as "something that ancient people left behind"... But enough of that for now.
:I found some clues regarding what must have happened back then.
:Here, it writes... "As arranged by [[Manqu (Historical)|that poor fellow with only half a face left]], we must first shut off the power to the city"...
:A person with half a face left... Sounds like some character from a horror story.
:But based on this description, the "hollows" were shut down by human action...
:"After that, we need to cut off the combustion device's core energy supply area... Such that our [[Grand Alliance]] [[Yupanqui|Ordnance officer]] can take advantage of the chaos to bring [[Scarlet-Eyed Youth|that person]], the great one, before the royal hall."
:"The one to whom this task has been assigned is that half-faced fellow... With any luck, he will be more reliable in deed than in word or plan."
:Hmm... I'm sure I've heard mention of the position of Grand Alliance Ordnance Officer somewhere before...
:In any case, the group that shut this place down appear to have headed to a more important core area.
:If... If I can find something there, the top prize from the Saurian Relics Association will surely be mine!
:That way, even the fact that I didn't get permission to pass the [[Flower-Feather Clan]] blockade to sneak in here and conduct research will not open me up to criticism.

===Nameless Traveler's Notes (V)===
Located in the Furnace of Fiery Embers (II): Upper Level.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:(This sheet of paper has already gone yellow with age. The scribbled words on it read as follows...)
:Same thing here. There's nothing to be found.
:Perhaps it has all been destroyed. It is said, after all, that the [[Scarlet-Eyed Youth|second Pyro Archon]] once overthrew Ochkanatlan and ended Och-Kan's rulership.
:The mechanisms that once operated here must have ceased at that time, with most items also being destroyed.
:The woven scroll records indicate that the [[Old Core of Chu'ulel|Core of Chu'ulel]] lies beneath the many "hollows," while atop them... is [[Core of Chu'ulel|another core energy supply area]].
:It would be good if I could find it.
