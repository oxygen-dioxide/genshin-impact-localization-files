|description  = Scaled armor that grows naturally over mystical stone, tough and silent, and filled with the strength of the dragon king.<br />Across the years as countless generations returned to the mulch of the earth, gold and obsidian embedded themselves into flesh and blood forged from bedrock before spreading and turning into scales.<br />Searing agony, wordless cries... perhaps they will all vanish when the grudges that spawned them, too, finally come to an end.
