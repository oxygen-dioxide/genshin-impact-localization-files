{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yikuo:''' Hello? Can I help?
:{{DIcon}} Shouldn't you be at work now?
::'''Yikuo:''' How dare you. I'm taking a brief moment of much-needed respite from a very hectic schedule, that's all.
::'''Yikuo:''' Hardly my fault if you didn't see me while I was hard at work just now, is it?
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Well, you do have a point.
:::'''Yikuo:''' Exactly, right? Life is brutish and short. Working hard every day is fine and all, but is it worth it?
:::'''Yikuo:''' Rather than sacrifice everything on the altar of work like my colleagues, isn't it better to take breaks like this?
:::'''Yikuo:''' Life is long, why the rush and the chase?
:::'''Yikuo:''' So you should relax, too. Sit here, take a break, have some tea, try these Fried Radish Balls... enjoy life rather than suffer it.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Fried Radish Balls|20|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Yikuo:''' Bye. While the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail!
::'''Yikuo:''' Oh, also &mdash; don't tell Sarge I'm here, if you do see him.
