==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:{{DIcon}} Shouldn't you be at work now?
:'''Yikuo:''' How dare you. I'm taking a brief moment of much-needed respite from a very hectic schedule, that's all.
:'''Yikuo:''' Hardly my fault if you didn't see me while I was hard at work just now, is it?
:{{DIcon|Reward}} Well, you do have a point.
::'''Yikuo:''' Exactly, right? Life is brutish and short. Working hard every day is fine and all, but is it worth it?
::'''Yikuo:''' Rather than sacrifice everything on the altar of work like my colleagues, isn't it better to take breaks like this?
::'''Yikuo:''' Life is long, why the rush and the chase?
::'''Yikuo:''' So you should relax, too. Sit here, take a break, have some tea, try these Fried Radish Balls... enjoy life rather than suffer it.
::(Obtain [[Fried Radish Balls]] ×4)
