{{Quote|Dainsleif is a man of mysterious origins but claims to have knowledge of fate itself.|[https://twitter.com/GenshinImpact/status/1325704179181002752 Official Twitter EN and JP VA Announcement]}}
Dainsleif is an enigmatic character, but glimpses of his personality can be captured through the narrations of the [[Collected Miscellany]] videos and the [[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail|Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview]]. He often praises other characters' qualities, such as determination or wisdom, but regularly leaves open-ended questions regarding their background or motives.

Dainsleif claims that his memory has "all but faded," yet he can vividly recall the events of the [[Cataclysm|Fall of Khaenri'ah]]. Additionally, he is also somehow able to recall many of the events that occurred in [[Mondstadt]] from thousands of years ago, including stories of [[Boreas]] and [[Dvalin]].

Although Dainsleif detests deities that side with [[the Seven]] and dislikes the [[adepti]] for signing contracts with [[Rex Lapis]], he has great respect for those who are hardworking, such as [[Ganyu]].<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/tsPtGG9pFfg Ganyu's Collected Miscellany]</ref>

While indifferent to most crises, Dainsleif states that he would not tolerate the dangers posed from his former homeland, as he is only interested in opposing the Abyss Order. Likewise, he is particularly wary of [[Albedo]] due to his knowledge on the [[Art of Khemia]], a form of alchemy that brought ruin to Khaenri'ah, and would personally intervene if Albedo made a single mistake with it.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/xOJfaOI87XU Albedo's Collected Miscellany]</ref>

During the cataclysm, the [[Pari]] [[Zurvan]] found Dainsleif in the wilderness and brought him to the [[Vourukasha Oasis]]. According to Zurvan, half of Dainsleif's body had become "that of a monster," and he was holding a ring tightly in his hand. Dainsleif and Zurvan traveled together and fought off invading monsters from the Abyss. Afterwards, Dainsleif left, accompanied by the [[Traveler's Sibling]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Hymn of Tir Yazad (Part 2)}}</ref>

At one uncertain point in time, Dainsleif desired to take fate into his own hands.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/lf_b7_5oAZk Keqing's Collected Miscellany]</ref>

According to [[Capitano]], he believes that Dainsleif's pain and hatred far surpasses his own.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As One We Watch the Setting Sun}}</ref> Dainsleif originally used to be both travel partners and on good terms with the [[Traveler's Sibling]], though their bond fractured when their paths separated, though it is implied that he shows slight regret and hesitation.

==Appearance==
<!-- {{See also|character's outfit(s), default first}}
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3-4 sentences. Outfits should be described on the outfit pages. -->
Dainsleif is a tall man with light blond hair and sea blue eyes with distinct, star-shaped irises that are common among "pure-blood" Khaenri'ahns, such as [[Chlothar]], and presumably [[Pierro]] and [[Kaeya]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Destined Encounter|quote='''Kaeya:''' [...] I recognize your eyes...<br>'''Kaeya:''' You're a pure-blood Khaenri'ahn, aren't you?}}</ref> He wears a mask-like eyepatch covering the right side of his face while still showing his right eye. Dainsleif wears a black jacket with blue details, a gray vest, and black pants along with black armored gloves and boots. He also wears a black cape with a starry, space-patterned interior.

Dainsleif has a more youthful appearance to other cursed Khaenri'ahns through unknown means, as Capitano, who also lived during the cataclysm, also suffers the same curse but is in a greater state of decay.

Parts of the right side of his body appear to be covered in a blue veined pattern; namely his right arm, part of his right foot, the upper portion of his right pectoral, and as a faintly visible streak along the right side of his neck. This is more prominent in his artwork that depicts him demonstrating his abilities; in which the glowing veins marble the entire length of a fully blackened right arm, with a similar effect appearing on the foot.

The confluence between the past and future.

The original calamity had been overturned, yet the island in the sky set the earth to burn. Chalk pursues gold, in this time inopportune, the eclipse is swallowed by the crimson moon. The future must atone for bygone mistakes, as the bond familiar falters and breaks&mdash; of the same blood, elders and the youth... Such is the cycle of the world, in truth. Dain, what is that strand of blonde hair to you? Someone you must kill? Or the object of your penitence?

&mdash;A self-proclaimed prophet.

==Trivia==
* Dainsleif's nickname, "Dain," has been used since the days of Khaenri'ah.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As One We Watch the Setting Sun}}</ref>
* Dainsleif is titled the {{Lang|"Bough Keeper"|zh=拾枝者|zh_rm=Shízhī-zhě|zh_tl=Bough Picker}} in-game and in the trailers.
** "Bough" is a likely reference to boughs and branches of [[Irminsul]], the Tree of [[Ley Line]]s, which are containers of travel experiences of the time-flourished world. Dainsleif is rich in experiences and memories throughout his life of "picking and keeping boughs."
* Dainsleif narrates the [[Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail|Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview]], as well as the [[Collected Miscellany]] videos (with the exception of [[Aloy]], [[Dori]], [[Wanderer]], and [[Sigewinne]] which are narrated by [[Alice]] and [[Neuvillette]] instead).
** The Chinese version of "Collected Miscellany" is {{zh|拾枝杂谈|tl=Picking Bough Miscellany}}, a reference to his title.<ref>Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/av797334847/ Chinese Collected Miscellany Videos]</ref> Collected Miscellany videos can thusly be seen as his comments on each of the characters he had previously met.
** In the Teyvat Storyline Trailer, his dialogue switches to first person at the Khaenri'ah section.
* Dainsleif's immortality was first hinted at in his narration in [[Venti]]'s [[Collected Miscellany]], [https://youtu.be/uwNXNHazS-I&t=30s Venti: Skyward Sonnet], where he says: "A thousand years have passed since the [[Barbatos|God of Anemo]] left [[Mondstadt|this land]]. But to me, it has only been half that time."
* Although Dainsleif is confirmed to be a playable character in the future, his character card lists [[File:Character Dainsleif Vision.svg|30px]] for his [[Vision]] element, and he does not have a visible Vision on his person.
** Dainsleif's abilities are briefly shown in {{Quest|We Will Be Reunited}}. His hand is surrounded by a dark blue, galaxy-like aura when restraining an [[Abyss Herald]] without physical contact.

===Etymology===
* In Norse mythology, {{w|Dáinsleif}} is the name of king Högni's sword, crafted by the dwarf {{w|Dáinn (Norse dwarf)|Dáinn}}. When drawn, the sword cannot be sheathed again unless it has taken a life.
** Dáinn is also one of the {{w|Dáinn, Dvalinn, Duneyrr and Duraþrór|four stags}} that feast on the branches of {{w|Yggdrasill}}.
