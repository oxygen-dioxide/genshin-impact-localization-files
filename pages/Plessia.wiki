: {{DIcon|Idle}} The deployment of [[Garde]]s...

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Plessia:''' Greetings. I handle all manner of affairs regarding Fontaine's security.
:{{DIcon}} About security...
::'''Plessia:''' The [[Gardemek]]s are in charge of daily security matters, and they aid their corresponding Gardes officers in conducting patrols.
::'''Plessia:''' Machines are not omnipotent, after all. There are many things that can only be accomplished by humans.
::'''Plessia:''' Gardemeks and the Gardes are both under the [[Maison Gardiennage]].
::'''Plessia:''' If something arises that they, too, cannot handle, then it shall be up to the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, or the [[Neuvillette|Chief Justice]]'s personal unit, the [[Marechaussee Phantom]].
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol...
:::'''Plessia:''' They are the elite of the Maison Gardiennage.
:::'''Plessia:''' They handle affairs that ordinary Gardes would struggle with &mdash; such as criminals who refuse to negotiate and attempt to resist violently.
:::'''Plessia:''' Normally, criminals who still maintain a spark of rationality would surrender upon encountering the Patrol.
::{{DIcon}} As for the Marechaussee Phantom...
:::'''Plessia:''' That organization was once comprised only of humans, but now the majority of them are [[Melusine]]s.
:::'''Plessia:''' They were added in when the Chief Justice noticed that their special visual acuity was most suited to investigating cases.
:::'''Plessia:''' I apologize if I get a little excited at times. Please understand.
:::'''Plessia:''' After all, the lovely Melusines are treasured companions of us Fontainians.
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} You must really like Melusines.
:::'''Plessia:''' Yes, and I never conceal my love for them.
:::'''Plessia:''' As a cardinal defense officer that handles city defense affairs, I am obliged to emphasize that&mdash;
:::'''Plessia:''' Though Melusines are tiny, adorable beings, they are Fontainian citizens, not pets or monsters.
:::'''Plessia:''' I will not allow any inappropriate thoughts regarding Melusines.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Guide to Order}})
:{{DIcon}} I shan't bother you, then.
::'''Plessia:''' See you, in that case.
