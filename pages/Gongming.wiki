==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Gongming:''' State your business here!
:'''Gongming:''' This is a location of paramount import to Liyue. You will forgive me if I appear a little hypervigilant.
:{{DIcon}} About Rex Lapis' death...
:;(Before completing [[Turning Point]])
::'''Gongming:''' It seems like every man and his dog has heard the news now... Perhaps the [[Qixing]] are not as omnipotent as I thought.
::'''Gongming:''' To tell the truth, the news has shaken me to the core. For [[Rex Lapis]] to leave us like this, so suddenly... I dare not contemplate the implications.
::'''Gongming:''' Added to this... I am at a loss to explain some of the Qixing's recent activity. Particularly some of my orders &mdash; what is asked of me far exceeds the scope of my authority...
:;(After completing [[Turning Point]])
::'''Gongming:''' Well, this isn't a secret anymore. It must be the talk of the town. by now.
::'''Gongming:''' It never rains, but it only pours. Rex Lapis had just left us, and then some unidentified scoundrel broke into the Golden House...
::'''Gongming:''' But what concerns me most is that when we did an inventory check afterward, not a single Mora was found to be missing.
::'''Gongming:''' Assaulting the Golden House, but not for Mora &mdash; what manner of deed is that? I can't wrap my head around it...
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Gongming:''' I am under no obligation to respond to your questions... However, since you display such a woeful ignorance of well-known facts...
::'''Gongming:''' I shall indulge you this time... This is the "Golden House." Though, you may simply think of it as the Liyue Mint... or, in fact, the Teyvat Mint.
::'''Gongming:''' The source of all wealth, the foundation of ambition, the lifeblood of the economy... I am the steward here, and I take every precaution to ensure the security of this place.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, I have to go.
::'''Gongming:''' Very well. Unless you have business at the Golden House, please stay well clear of the entrance at all times.
