==Trivia==
* The Borja Family is a reference to the {{w|House of Borgia}}, an Italian-Aragonese Spanish noble family that rose to prominence during the Italian Renaissance, infamous for their meddling with political and ecclesiastical affairs through vicious means such as bribery and murder, while also hoarding power and keeping it inside the family through nepotism; their coat of arms is a red bull upon a yellow and green terrace. Rodrigo Borgia, later known as {{w|Pope Alexander VI}}, had numerous illicit relationships, from one of which his son {{w|Cesare Borgia}}, a condottiero who then became the head of the House of Borgia, was born.
