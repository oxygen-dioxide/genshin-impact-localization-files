==Dialogue==
===Damaged Records: I===
...We were ordered to find the path to the [[The Orchard of Pairidaeza|Eternal Oasis]], and it seems that we're finally seeing some results...<br>
...But this is a perilous place. The investigation team has taken serious losses, and our material transportation lines have been cut by storms...<br>
...<br>
...We have run out of food. Perhaps we can capture some nearby [[Wenut]] to feed ourselves...<br>
...The hunting party we sent was lost to the sandstorm. We cannot risk sending any more people out...<br>
...<br>
...Ran out of water, bled our [[Sumpter Beast]]s... Scouts are still searching for a way back...<br>
...We can only leave our fates to the sleeping mistress of the Oasis &mdash; if she exists at all...

===Damaged Records: II ===
...Oh great [[Nabu Malikata|Goddess of Flowers]], please heed the cries of the abandoned. Carry our souls to your [[The Orchard of Pairidaeza|Eternal Oasis]]...
