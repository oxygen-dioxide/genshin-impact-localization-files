{{Description|An engineer from [[Fontaine]] has arrived at the outskirts of [[The Chasm]] to study harmonic motion between gems known as Vibro-Crystals in an effort to clear the name of his colleague, who had accused of faking his data. Connect Transmitter and Receiver Crystals and attempt to produce various effects that will allow you to defeat your foes with ease.}}
'''Vibro-Crystal Verification''' is an [[Event]] in [[Version 3.5]].

==Event Details==
===Duration===
* 2023/03/14 10:00 - 2023/03/27 03:59

===Requirements===
* [[Adventure Rank]] 28 or above
* Complete the [[Archon Quest]] "[[The Fond Farewell]]"<!-- The event announcement states the quest is "Rite of Parting", however the in-game notice states it is "The Fond Farewell" -->

===Summary===
* During the event, equip your party with a Vibro-Crystal Harmonics Schema and take part in the challenges. Defeat the enemies within the time limit and earn points to obtain rewards such as [[Primogem]]s, [[Hero's Wit]], and [[Weapon Ascension Material]]s.
* During the first 6 days of the event, one new challenge will be unlocked each day.
* During the "Vibro-Crystal Verification" event, you must split your characters into 2 parties for the challenge. Before you start combat, you may equip each party with a Vibro-Crystal Harmonics Schema. Combine Transmitter Crystals and Receiver Crystals to obtain different combat buffs.
* Each Transmitter Crystal can only project its radiation upon one Receiver Crystal, but each Receiver can receive transmissions from 3 Transmitters. Using different Transmitter Crystals to trigger Receivers will increase their effects.
* During this challenge, you must defeat opponents that constantly emerge to obtain points within the allotted time. Of those opponents, Nemeses will provide more points. Once the challenge ends, you will gain different insignias based on the number of points you gained.
* Elemental Resonances will take effect in the "Vibro-Crystal Verification" challenges, but you will not be able to use food or other items.
* Although there are no additional rewards for completing a given challenge with over 2,000 points, a [[File:Vibro-Crystal Research Medal 4.png|30px]] platinum medal will be awarded if at least 5,000 points are obtained.
* Under 500 points [[File:Vibro-Crystal Research Medal 0.png|30px]] no medal will be awarded.
