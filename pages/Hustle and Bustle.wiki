{{Quest Description|You and Paimon have been at a loose end lately, so you decide to visit Qiaoying Village...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon almost forgot! Didn't Zhongli say Hu Tao was also planning on spending some time in Qiaoying Village?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We don't have anything else to do today, right? Why don't we go have a look around? Maybe we'll run into her!

;(Approach the marked location in Qiaoying Village)
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The mountain air is so refreshing! It makes Paimon feel like she could float around all day and never get tired!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 2 navia 01.ogg}} '''???:''' ...[[Cream]]! Gummies! [[Bulle Fruit]]!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? {{Traveler}}, did you hear that...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 2 navia 02.ogg}} '''???:''' ...Sunshine! Blue Skies! Good Vibes!
:{{DIcon}} I heard it too.
:{{DIcon}} Something about Bulle Fruit and good vibes.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right? So Paimon wasn't just hearing things.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That voice sounds really familiar...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, we've got the time. Why don't we go check it out?
:{{DIcon}} Okay. Let's go see what's up.
:{{Black Screen|You and Paimon make your way up the mountain in search of the source of the shouting.}}
:{{Black Screen|As far as you can make out, it's "[[Almond]]s" this and "[[Cocoa Paste (Of Drink A-Dreaming)|Cocoa Paste]]" that. Sounds delicious, that's for sure.}}
:{{Black Screen|The lively voice invigorates your steps, and you ascend the mountain in no time.}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh! What are they doing here!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Navia! Clorinde!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Ah! Well if it isn't my dear partners!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' See! I told you that something good was going to happen during our travels today! I have to say, sometimes The Steambird's astrology column is spot on.
:{{Introductory Note|Navia}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' It's just your lucky day.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Are you guys also here to catch the festivities? Oh, and that reminds me, Happy Lantern Rite!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Happy Lantern Rite.
:{{DIcon}} And to you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Happy Lantern Rite to you too!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, if you're here for Lantern Rite, then what are you doing on top of this deserted mountain?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And that voice we heard... That was you, right Navia?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Oho, impressive! You could tell it was me from that far away! You've got good ears!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That, or your voice is just really loud...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well of course it is! After all, I am a Boss.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Indeed. I suppose it's an asset.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure is! Having a loud voice is a handy tool when it comes to communication.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Wait wait wait! That wasn't even Paimon's point.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon just wants to know why you two were shouting from the top of this deserted mountain.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There was something about Almonds maybe... and Bulle Fruit... Ooh! Is it some sort of secret code?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' No, it's not a code. The words are meaningless.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...Perhaps. But the act of shouting was very meaningful indeed!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' That's just what mountain climbers do, right? After all the hard work it takes to make it to the top, as you stand on the summit looking out at the vast scenery, it's not easy to resist the urge to release those emotions...
:{{DIcon}} I see. So it's not what you were shouting that matters.
:{{DIcon}} But the act of shouting itself.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Exactly! You get me, partner.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I was afraid that it would cause a disturbance, so I asked the locals around here, and they said it was fine. Apparently, most hikers like to shout when they get to the top, so the locals are used to it by now.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' So you see, It's not just me! I guess everyone shouts from the top of a mountain at some point in their life.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Speak for yourself.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' When you're stressed, don't you ever just get the urge to do something for no reason?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 clorinde 06.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Not really. If I ever get stressed, I just go hunting.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! That's a pretty good way to relieve stress.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 clorinde 07.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' What I choose to hunt depends on my mood.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Huh?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Ahem... Anyway, why don't you two give it a try? Shout anything you want. It's a real stress reliever!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... as long as Paimon has clothes on her back and food in her belly, Paimon doesn't think there's any stress that needs relieving.
:{{DIcon}} And I prefer to keep things bottled up.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 14.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hahaha, I bet you guys are just too embarrassed to let loose.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 15.ogg}} '''Navia:''' No need to be shy! Even Furina was shouting from the top of this mountain earlier.
:{{DIcon}} Who?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? ...Did Paimon hear that right? Furina's also here in Qiaoying Village?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 clorinde 08.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Believe in your ears. It is indeed as you heard.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 clorinde 09.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Actually, the reason we climbed this mountain in the first place was also because we heard the sound of shouting.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 16.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Yep. We could just about make out someone yelling things like "Help me!" and "What should I do?". So we hurried up here to check it out.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 17.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And what do you know, Miss Furina was standing right there all red in the face. She practically sprinted back down the mountain the minute she saw us...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 clorinde 10.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Ah, that reminds me. I believe what she actually said was, "So help me, I will figure out what I should do about this script."
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 18.ogg}} '''Navia:''' So you could actually hear what she was saying! Why didn't you say so earlier? I thought someone was really in trouble!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 clorinde 11.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I figured we would come check out the situation either way. Why not let her keep some privacy.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Seems like you caught Furina in the middle of some stress relief as well...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She probably would have never thought... No, she definitely would have never thought she would run into anyone she knew all the way out here...
:{{DIcon}} Was she alone?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 19.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I think so? We ran into Neuvillette on the way here as well, but he was already on his way back, so they probably weren't together.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wha&mdash; Neuvillette was here too?
:{{DIcon}} So many people from Fontaine.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What was he doing here? It couldn't have been for vacation...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 20.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I think it just might have been, actually. But apparently, he only stayed for half a day before heading back. He's a very busy man.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 clorinde 12.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Neuvillette is not the type to take much time off. Taking even a half-day for himself is already a huge step in the right direction.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 21.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Didn't Charlotte publish an article on the Liyue tea industry recently? Maybe he was inspired to come buy some tea after reading that article. You know, just like you were!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 clorinde 13.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' My situation is completely different. I'm here because I was asked to accompany you. The tea purchase is simply an added bonus of this location.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You Fontainians and your tea drinking...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 clorinde 14.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Oh, it's not for me. I lost a bet with Wriothesley, and now I have to buy him something.
:{{DIcon}} You made a bet?
:{{DIcon}} Seems like a fitting gift.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 clorinde 15.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' It was just a spur-of-the-moment sort of bet.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 clorinde 16.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Wriothesley gets really invested in that sort of thing. But he couldn't care less about what he wins in the end.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 clorinde 17.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' You could give him mint plants that you plucked from the side of the road, and he wouldn't even mind.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 22.ogg}} '''Navia:''' If only he was that easygoing when it came to talking business...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 23.ogg}} '''Navia:''' In any case, I'm pretty sure the tea you bought is this region's specialty. What is it called again... Ah, Neuvillette even mentioned it earlier...
:{{DIcon}} Sunglo Tea...
:{{DIcon}} ...Buy ten boxes get half off?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 24.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Yes, yes! That's the one!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You didn't really buy ten boxes, did you?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 clorinde 18.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Please, do I look like someone who would fall for that sort of marketing trap?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 25.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Ah, that reminds me. You guys said you only came up here because you heard my voice, right? I hope it didn't put you out &mdash; you must have other plans for the day?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that's right! Hu Tao!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A few days ago, we heard that a friend was going to be in Qiaoying Village, so we decided to come and see if we could run into her.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 26.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Oh dear, we've been chatting for quite some time. I'm sorry for keeping you.
:{{DIcon}} No harm done, partner.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 27.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hehe, that's good.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We should probably head out and look for Hu Tao.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 clorinde 19.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' No need to stay on our account. We just got up here, so we're going to stay around for a little longer.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 navia 28.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Go and meet your friend. We can meet up in Qiaoying Village later!
:{{DIcon}} Sounds reasonable to me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 3 paimon 24.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds good. We're gonna head down the mountain then. See you later!

;(Talk to Clorinde or Navia, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' What do I have to do to get you to yell from the top of this mountain? Name your price.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' You really want to hear it that bad, huh?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I'm just curious is all. I have a feeling you'll say something amazing.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Hmm... I will pass.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I prefer to let actions speak louder than words.
----
;(Approach Furina, Hu Tao, and Zhongli)
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Qiaoying Village is known for its tea. But you know what else they have with tea? That's right, dim sum!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Didn't [[Gaming]] say something about dim sum being eaten in the morning? Paimon wonders if we can still get some at this time of day.
:{{DIcon}} Afternoon tea might be more appropriate at this point.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, well that's fine too. Paimon doesn't care what kind of tea it is, as long as it comes with some tasty snacks!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Now, let's see what kinds of yummy things we can find around here... Uh...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' P-Paimon's not seeing things, is she? Is that Furina standing between Zhongli and Hu Tao?
:{{DIcon}} Whoa!
:{{DIcon}} Judging based on the hat, I'd say so.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wonder what they're talking about.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Zhongli knows a lot of stuff. Maybe he's telling Furina about Qiaoying Village?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Oh! Or maybe Hu Tao is trying to rope Furina into being one of her clients.
:{{DIcon}} Wanna make a bet?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, this isn't the Fortress of Meropide!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, Paimon could be convinced for the right price. Let's say loser buys the winner three huge bowls of Seafood Congee!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Since Zhongli is there, Paimon bets things are pretty tame...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's decided then! Paimon votes for "tour guide Zhongli"!
:{{DIcon}} Then I vote for "hustler Hu Tao".
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright! No time to waste! Let's go see who's right!
:;(Paimon and the Traveler approach the group)
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good afternoon, Hu Tao, Zhongli, and Furina!!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' (Oh great, now Paimon's shouting too...)
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 01.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oho, well aren't you a sight for sore eyes! Seems like our luck just keeps on growing!
:{{Introductory Note|Hu Tao}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' That we were able to meet you both without prior arrangement must mean that this is quite the serendipitous meeting indeed.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Huh? Oh! So both of you are acquainted with {{Traveler}} and Paimon then.
:{{DIcon}} I have keenly felt the passage of time since our last meeting.
::{{Introductory Note|Furina}}
::{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 02a 1.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oh? Looks like someone's learned a thing or two from Zhongli.
:{{DIcon}} So many chums all in one place!
::{{Introductory Note|Furina}}
::{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 02b 1.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I'm pretty sure you didn't learn that one from me...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' *ahem* I must admit, I'm a bit surprised to see you here, {{Traveler}}.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But seeing as you're a hero who's been all over Teyvat, it makes sense that you would be well-traveled and well-connected.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Since we have found ourselves in each other's company within this fertile land, allow me to take this opportunity to wish you a happy Lantern Rite.
:{{DIcon}} Happy Lantern Rite!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It appears you have been to Fontaine then.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' {{Traveler}}, given your proclivity to spread good deeds wherever you go, it's no surprise that you would make the acquaintance of a celebrity as illustrious and celebrated as Miss Furina.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Th&ndash;That's quite high praise...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' What I mean to say is, you flatter me, Mr. Zhongli.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Although I've built up a certain following within Fontaine, it is no reflection of strength or wisdom.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I stand before you right now as nothing more than an ordinary traveler in search of beautiful scenery and creative inspiration.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (There is definitely more to Mr. Zhongli than meets the eye. I could tell as much from our conversation earlier.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (Given his breadth of knowledge on both academic and worldly matters, there's no way he hasn't heard about what happened in Fontaine...)
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (...Is he just feigning ignorance for my benefit?)
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 03.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' No, no no. Aiya, you're no common tourist. I simply won't have you talk about yourself that way.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (Huh? Does that mean Hu Tao also knows...!)
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 04.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' You may not have heard, friends, but&mdash;
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 14.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Uh, ahem, Miss Hu Tao...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 05.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Miss Furina is now one of my esteemed clients!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 15.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh... Yep!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh&mdash;!?
:{{DIcon}} Did you hear that, Paimon?
:{{DIcon}} She's Hu Tao's "esteemed client."
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, okay. You win...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* Guess Paimon will have to break into the hidden stash at the bottom of her shoe.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 16.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Huh? What's this about winning something?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 06.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Don't tell me... You two were placing bets on us?
:{{DIcon}} It was Paimon's idea.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nuh-uh!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We just saw you guys standing on the side of the road and couldn't help but take guesses as to what you were talking about.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 07.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oh, I see. That means you, my friend, must have guessed that I was trying to promote my business to Miss Furina.
:{{DIcon}} Well, you know me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 08.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' That I do, my friend.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 09.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' What was Paimon's guess then?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thought Zhongli was showing the newbie around.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 17.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ah, by "newbie" you mean me, right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' If that's the case, then Paimon's guess was also correct.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 18.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh, that's right! Mr. Zhongli was telling me about some great sight-seeing spots in the area.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ha! You see! Paimon was right too!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Since both of our guesses were right, there can't be a winner or a loser!
:{{DIcon}} Fine. Keep your secret stash then.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 24.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, don't be upset, {{Traveler}}...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 25.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How about this. You buy Paimon a bowl, and Paimon will also buy you a bowl.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 26.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... As for the third bowl...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 10.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Since I was the subject of the bet, perhaps it should go to me? You know, as a congratulations for the huge deal I just struck.
:{{DIcon}} I'll buy you a bowl any time you want.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 11.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Hehe, I was just joking. Anyway, I should be the one treating you. The Funeral Parlor is about to bring in quite the sum, after all.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 27.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Paimon almost forgot to ask the most important question!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 28.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did, uh, something... happen recently, Furina?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 19.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Huh? What do you mean?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 29.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Well, you know, with you enlisting the services of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor and all...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 20.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh, well, yes.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 30.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really!? Oh no...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 31.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon is so sorry for your loss... Although Paimon may have not known the person, please accept Paimon's deepest&mdash;
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 21.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Woah, woah, woah. It's not like that, Paimon!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 32.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? But Paimon just thought... Since you hired the services of a Funeral Parlor and all... Hey, it's not that big of a stretch!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 22.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Really, Paimon. It's not like you don't know me. Do I look like I know anyone who would ask me to coordinate their funeral?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 23.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Miss Hu Tao is simply helping prepare some props for my film.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 24.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Not too long ago, I read a collection of horror stories from Liyue. The content was spectacular. In fact, I still feel the need to sleep with the light on even now...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 25.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...Anyway, that's not the point!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 26.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Now that Fontaine's biggest star has returned to the stage, I figured it's about time the industry enjoyed a breath of fresh air!
:{{DIcon}} You might even call it a "breath of fresh t-AIR-or"!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 27.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hey, that's pretty good! I'll have to remember that for my ad posters.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 33.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon sees! That makes a lot of sense.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 34.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So did you come to Liyue just to enlist the services of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 28.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Well, not exactly...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 29.ogg}} '''Furina:''' My original plan was to just relax and enjoy the sights. But then I ran into Miss Hu Tao and Mr. Zhongli, and well, you know the rest. I suppose it was meant to be.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It was a fated meeting indeed.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 12.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Zhongli sure loves his lofty turns of phrase. But if you ask me, it's all thanks to that man who stopped to ask for directions.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 35.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? Who was it?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 30.ogg}} '''Furina:''' It's someone you know. Wanna take a guess?
:{{DIcon}} Let me think...
:{{DIcon}} ...It was Neuvillette, wasn't it?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 31.ogg}} '''Furina:''' What! How did you guess that on your first try!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 13.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Very impressive, my friend. Your guessing game is spot on today!
:{{Black Screen|You tell everyone about your encounter with Navia and Clorinde at the top of the mountain...}}
:{{Black Screen|One look at the pitiful expression on Furina's face is enough to convince you to leave out the part about the shouting.}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 36.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, Paimon never thought Neuvillette would be the type to get lost...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 32.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I'm sure he didn't get lost. Even I was able to find my way to this place without any trouble.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 33.ogg}} '''Furina:''' He was already getting ready to leave by the time I arrived. He just wanted to ask someone about the quickest way to get back to Fontaine.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 14.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Yep. That's exactly what he asked.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 15.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' This area is full of mountains and rivers. It's normal to not know the fastest route.
:{{DIcon}} (For him, though, swimming would probably be the fastest route of them all.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 37.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So were you the one that pointed him in the right direction, Hu Tao?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 16.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Of course. I am also a "guide" of sorts, you know. So naturally, I also have a great sense of direction.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 17.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' But, speaking of your friend...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 38.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What about him?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 18.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' He doesn't get out much, does he?
:{{DIcon}} No... No, he doesn't.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 19.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Ah, no wonder! He was stiff as a board and way too polite... I would have never guess he was here on vacation if you hadn't told me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 34.ogg}} '''Furina:''' All in all, he was only here for half a day. I'm pretty sure he's the only one who would consider that to be a vacation...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Oh? This gentleman you speak of must keep a demanding schedule.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 20.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' I'm sure he does. You didn't see him, but he was dressed like he was about to attend some important meeting. It wasn't anything like what someone would wear on vacation.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Is that so...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 39.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, you didn't see him, Zhongli?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Unfortunately, no.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' At the time, it appeared as if Director Hu and Miss Furina were having quite the productive conversation. I know matters of business can take much discussion, so I decided to fetch some tea for them.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 21.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' What a shame. That gentleman seemed like a sophisticated sort of guy. I actually think you two would have hit it off!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Is that so?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Judging by how Zhongli is acting... And taking into consideration Neuvillette's true identity...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Could Zhongli have been avoiding him on purpose?)
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Mm?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Oh, I see.)
:{{DIcon}} It is what it is.
:{{DIcon}} It's truly a pity.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Haha, to borrow Miss Furina's turn of phrase, perhaps it just wasn't meant to be.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 35.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Well, with {{Traveler}} around, I'm sure you'll have a chance to get to know each other at some point.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 40a.ogg}} {{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 40b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's right! {{MC|m=He|f=She}}'s got more friends than {{MC|m=he|f=she}} knows what to do with!
:{{DIcon}} I have a certain charm about me.
:{{DIcon}} I'm good with people.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 36.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Well, that's certainly true!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 37.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh, that reminds me. If you get the chance, you should try and talk Neuvillette into loosening up a bit.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 38.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Just tell him the Palais Mermonia isn't going to fall apart if he disappears for a few days. He shouldn't keep himself cooped up all the time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 39.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Even clams open their shells to let in fresh water every once in a while, right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 40.ogg}} '''Furina:''' If he's really that much of a stickler for protocol, he can fill out a leave of absence request. He'd have to approve it himself since he handles that sort of thing now, but you know what I mean.
:{{DIcon}} That does make sense.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 22.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Seems like this gentleman is also in charge of something pretty important.
:{{DIcon}} He's the fair and impartial Iudex of Fontaine, head of the highest court in the land.
::{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 23a 1.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Aiya, sounds like a pretty uptight sort of guy all right.
:{{DIcon}} Otherwise known as, the demon who controls all the paperwork in Fontaine.
::{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 23b 1.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oho, I've never heard of a demon that boring before.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 24.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' In my experience, a leader needs be able to roll with the punches. That also includes knowing when and what to prioritize.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 25.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' It seems like your friend still has a lot of growing to do.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 41.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (If I remember correctly, he's already several thousands of years old...)
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 42.ogg}} '''Furina:''' You're quite right, Miss Hu Tao!
:;(Navia and Clorinde look on from a nearby bridge)
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 zhongli 13.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Oh?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 zhongli 14.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' {{Traveler}}, Miss Furina, those two individuals over there appear to recognize you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 41.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! It's Navia and Clorinde!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 42.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Over here!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' We saw you all chatting over here, and were wondering if we could join in.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Please excuse the interruption.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 26.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oh, so polite!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 27.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' No apologies necessary. Any friend of {{Traveler}} and Miss Furina is a friend of mine!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Ha, straight to the point. I like it!
:{{Black Screen|Everyone circles around you and begins to introduce themselves.}}
:{{Black Screen|Hu Tao's eyes light up when she hears about Clorinde's profession.}}
:{{Black Screen|But a quick explanation from Furina and Navia seems to dispel some of her more misguided ideas.}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' It's getting late...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' If we want to catch a boat back before dark, we should probably get going.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Indeed.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Then... Miss Furina...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 43.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh... Uh, yes?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' When are you planning to head back? Do you need us to escort you?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 44.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh, um, I... I don't think that will be necessary...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 45.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I mean, you're not my subordinate anymore. You don't need to look after me...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Um, I didn't mean it that way.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 clorinde 06.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' It's normal for friends to travel home together if they run into each other on the road.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' There are a lot of mountainous roads in this area. I imagine they'll be even harder to navigate after dark.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 28.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Exactly! Just like in those ghost stories...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 29.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Eight paths converge in a wood. Beside them an old house is stood. If you dare to go inside, not a soul will greet your eye...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 30.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' But if you take a closer look, there may be something you mistook. A candle flickers to and fro, yet there is no wind to make it so. What is its secret, what could it mean, in this wood where mystery screams...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 46.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Waaaaaah!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 47.ogg}} '''Furina:''' My dear demoiselles... Uh, ladies... No, uh, I mean... friends! Please take me with you!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 clorinde 07.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Of course.
:{{DIcon}} F&mdash;Furina...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 31.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Hehe, gotta say, Furina, you are really quite the character.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 32.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' By the way, did I hear you mention that Clorinde used to work under you?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 33.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Then you must have also been a leader at some point.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 48.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ah... Well, that's, uh... all in the past now...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 49.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Besides, being a leader is hard. It wasn't the right job for me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 50.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I prefer how things are now. I can come and go as I please, and get to enjoy the sweet taste of freedom.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 zhongli 15.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I see. Well, you've certainly picked an apt place to relax. Qiaoying Village is an exemplary choice.
:{{DIcon}} Well, have you all had a good time?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 51.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Only the best! And I've learned a lot, too!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 52.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Thank you so much, Miss Hu Tao and Mr. Zhongli.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 34.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' It's fine! You've thanked us more than enough already.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 35.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' The next time you're in this neck of the woods, I'll treat you to some dim sum in the city!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 53.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Dim sum... Is that some kind of Liyue term for snacks or desserts?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 36.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' They are a part of it! It's basically a tableful of as much tea, sweets, and good company as you can manage.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 54.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh, so it's basically a tea party! Sounds great!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 43.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Make sure to order the Winter Melon Cake and the [[Lotus Flower Crisp]]! They're so sweet and delicious. Paimon knows you'll love them!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 55.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh, okay! I'll be looking forward to it then.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 44.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, but... didn't you guys say you were here on vacation? How come you're all going home empty handed?
:{{DIcon}} You're not bringing home any souvenirs?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Of course I am! I bought tons of fun things to bring home with me!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' A kite, a parasol, a little tin frog that jumps... Oh, and a stuffed toy of a mythical beast...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Clorinde is the one who didn't buy anything for herself.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 45.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So all you're bringing back with you is that tea?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 clorinde 08.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' And some tea-flavored hard candies. They're for [[Sigewinne]].
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Clorinde isn't much of a shopaholic.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 clorinde 09.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Well, one of us has to practice restraint.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hey, I'm hardly reckless with my Mora. I'll have you know, all the purchases I made today were well within my budget.
:{{DIcon}} What about you, Furina?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 56.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Me? Oh, well, I bought some tea, of course. I just had to try all the varieties recommended in The Steambird.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 57.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Other than that, just some bits and bobs, you know. A little bit of this, little bit of that...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 58.ogg}} '''Furina:''' They should all be things I can use... I think.
:{{DIcon}} So you fell for a few marketing traps, then.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 46.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... Now Paimon's even more confused...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 47.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If you bought that much stuff, where did it all go? Into one of Lyney's Magic Pockets?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 furina 59.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh, actually...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 clorinde 10.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Monsieur Neuvillette took them with him.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 48.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so that's what happened...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 49.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Wait, whaaaaat!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 paimon 50.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why did he take them? He's not... hoarding treasure, is he?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hahaha, that's quite the imagination you've got there, Paimon.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Monsieur Neuvillette just saw the amount of bags we had, and offered to take them back for us.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I felt a bit bad at first.... But, uh, I really did have a lot of stuff, hehe...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 clorinde 11.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' He even offered to deliver my gifts to the Fortress of Meropide for me once he's done with the day's work.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 clorinde 12.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Neuvillette is a man of his word. If he says he can do something, then he means it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 navia 14.ogg}} '''Navia:''' See, even Clorinde was happy to take him up on his offer.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 navia 15.ogg}} '''Navia:''' If even his trusty subordinate agreed, then who was I to refuse?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 37.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Wow, he seems like a real gentleman! Maybe he's not as uptight as I thought.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 38.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' If only the Funeral Parlor had an employee as thoughtful, proactive, and responsible as him.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 hutao 39.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Right, Zhongli?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 5 zhongli 16.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Indeed.

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Clorinde said Neuvillette offered to deliver her gifts to Wriothesley.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So if we go to the entrance of the Fortress of Meropide, maybe we'll run into Neuvillette!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, we don't know exactly when he'll show up...

;(Talk to Hu Tao or Zhongli, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 hutao 01.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oh, that reminds me. A new year of work is about to begin.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 hutao 02.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' If there's anything you want to talk about, Zhongli, you know you can come to me. I'm all ears.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Does the Director have any concerns?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 hutao 03.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' It just seemed like you were a bit preoccupied today, and much less talkative than usual. You barely said anything other than "Is that so?" and "Indeed".
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 hutao 04.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' If you ask me, I'd say you're having a mid-life crisis. You're getting to be around that age, after all.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Is that so?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 hutao 05.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' ...
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Haha, I jest.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Given its distance from the city, Qiaoying Village enjoys a much slower pace of life.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Surrounded by such peace and tranquility, I also seem to have developed a proclivity for inactivity.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I apologize for making you worry.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 hutao 06.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Ah. Um, I see.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 hutao 07.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' What do you think, {{Traveler}}? Is this atmosphere putting you in a lazy mood too?
:{{DIcon}} Out of mind, out of sight...
:{{DIcon}} Different worlds should not collide?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 hutao 08.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Wow! You are getting really good at these kinds of lines!
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Indeed.

;(Talk to Clorinde, Furina, or Navia, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, everyone, make sure that you've got all your belongings with you before we leave.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' If there's any souvenirs anyone still wants to buy, the time is now.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Reliable as ever, Miss President.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Huh, what is that supposed to mean?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Clorinde is right, though. You really are reliable!
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' It's not what she's saying, it's the way she's saying it!
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I will say, I never thought you'd be so easygoing outside of work, Clorinde.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' The tone of voice you use when you're working doesn't exactly make you seem like the type who enjoys interacting with people.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Well, I try to keep my professional and private life separate. That includes my behavior.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' You take care now, {{Traveler}}, Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry. Your partner is very strong.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Trying to act cool now, are we? Haha, well I guess it's not an act for you, is it?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 clorinde 06.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' You are indeed quite strong.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hahaha, it's been great talking to you all. I'm really glad I decided to come to Qiaoying Village.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Maybe we could go on another trip together sometime?

:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, look! It's Neuvillette! We lucked out!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Oh, it's you. It has been some time since our last meeting.
:{{Introductory Note|Neuvillette}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Few people frequent this location. Since I was able to conclude my work early for the day, I thought I might take a walk and avail myself of this area's peace and quiet.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You call this early...? Do you always work this late, Neuvillette?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Strictly speaking, that depends on the agenda for the day.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I am hardly bereft of time, however, so working late is of little consequence to me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? If you have so much time on your hands, then why did you only go to Qiaoying Village for half a day?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Hmm...?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 06.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' First, I should clarify that I was referring to my lifespan rather than the time at my disposal on any given day.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 07.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Second... I was unaware you possessed knowledge of my trip to Qiaoying Village.
:{{Black Screen|You give Neuvillette a quick summary of everything that happened today...}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I see. Thank you for informing me.
:{{DIcon}} So did you deliver the gifts?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 09.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Yes. They have been safely delivered.
:;(A flashback begins)
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 wriothesley 01.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I have to hand it to Clorinde.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 wriothesley 02.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Just a simple gift delivery, and she has the great and mighty Iudex at her beck and call.
:{{Introductory Note|Wriothesley}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 10.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I was just passing through. It was merely an act of convenience.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 wriothesley 03.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Alright. Then I hereby confirm receipt of the goods on behalf of the staff of the Fortress of Meropide.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 11.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' A verbal receipt of confirmation? Is such a formality really necessary for a small matter such as this...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 wriothesley 04.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Guess not.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 wriothesley 05.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' This quantity of tea, though... Seems a little excessive for a gift, don't you think? Before you know it, they'll start accusing me of taking bribes.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 12.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Ah, about that...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 13.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Much of that is my own excess, I'm afraid.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 wriothesley 06.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Oh? Why, what happened?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 14.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' It was buy ten boxes get half off.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 wriothesley 07.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Ah! That explains it then.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 wriothesley 08.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Well, go ahead and leave them to me. I'll get through this stash as fast as I can.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 15.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' You have my thanks.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 16.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' There's something else I'd like to give to you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 wriothesley 09.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' This is...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 wriothesley 10.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' A stone... slate? Engraved with a symbolic design?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 17.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' While that is an apt description, it is, in actuality, a legal codex.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 wriothesley 11.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' ...A legal codex, huh... Hmm...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 18.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Before the advent of modern writing utensils, information was recorded on stone slabs such as this. The law was no different.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 wriothesley 12.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Okay...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 19.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Since ancient times, the scales of justice have symbolized the fairness and impartiality of judiciousness.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 20.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' As a tribute to that sentiment, this slate was designed after a traditional legal codex and engraved with the symbol instead of text.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 21.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' During my travels recently, I chanced upon a roadside stall offering tourists the opportunity to try their hand at the ceramic arts... So I decided to have a go...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 22.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' We joked with Clorinde some time ago about gifting you a legal codex. So, here you go.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 wriothesley 13.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Ah, so that's what this is about.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 23.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I did not expect you to remember it as well. In any case, I hope this can be considered as a reasonable attempt to join in on the banter.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 wriothesley 14.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' It is a very good attempt.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 wriothesley 15.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. Even your sense of humor centers around the law. That's an impressive level of commitment.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 wriothesley 16.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' A gift of this significance deserves to be put on display, and I know just the place... Front and center in the Fortress's showroom.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 24.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Ah, surely there's no need for such a grand gesture...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 wriothesley 17.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Just kidding. I don't have anything like a showroom.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 wriothesley 18.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' But we do have a storage room... We can put it next to all the mechanical parts Sigewinne has collected.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 25.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' That sounds good to me.
:;(Flashback ends)
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's what you were doing in Qiaoying Village!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 26.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Indeed. Of course, while I was there, I also took the opportunity to taste the local spring water.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 27.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' The aftertaste is much purer than what I have delivered to me in Fontaine. It stands to reason that the long-distance transport has a tendency to imbue the water with extraneous emotion...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 28.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' If you want to experience the true flavor, you simply have to go the source... Perhaps I should organize some time off to do the same elsewhere.
:{{DIcon}} As they say in Liyue: "A balance between work and play is sure to keep your troubles at bay."
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 29.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Then we are of the same mind. It appears my desire is justified.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If you say so. But you know you don't have to justify a vacation, right? You can just take one.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' After all, you're hardly "bereft of time." You can do whatever you want.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 30.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' You're quite right. I suppose I suffer not from a lack of opportunity but rather a lack of inspiration.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 31.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' However, after reading a few articles about Liyue's holiday traditions, the idea popped into my head and made itself quite at home...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 32.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Seeing as I was free of responsibilities for the morning, I decided to depart at once.
:{{DIcon}} And how was it?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 33.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Refreshing. My spontaneous outing seemed to inspire quite a few other spontaneous decisions as well.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 34.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Take, for example, my foray into ceramics. At first, soil from the ground is granular and unforgiving, but add the right amount of water, and it becomes soft, moldable, and able to take shape.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 35.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' In the past, I never thought about how quotidian vessels were crafted. But now, I have participated in their very making.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 36.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' This is also something I made today.
:[[File:Hustle and Bustle Ladle.png|200px]]
:{{DIcon}} Oh wow. What a big... ladle?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's a ladle? Paimon thought it was supposed to be some long-necked sea creature!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 37.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' That was indeed one of my inspirations.
:{{DIcon}} It's amazing.
:{{DIcon}} The color also really matches your style.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 38.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Really? You like it?
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 39.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' To tell you the truth, given your unexpected arrival, I find myself quite unequipped to give you the welcome you deserve.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 40.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Around an important holiday such as this, human custom would dictate that gifts should be in order...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 41.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' But I'm afraid, this is all I can offer, if you'll have it, that is.
:{{DIcon}} Can I really keep this?
:{{DIcon}} You made it by hand and everything...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 42.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' That is precisely why it would do me such a great honor if you accepted.
:{{DIcon}} Then I accept.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you!
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 43.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' You are most welcome. Happy Lantern Rite.
:{{DIcon}} Oh, that reminds me...
:{{Black Screen|You pass along the advice for Neuvillette's vacation...}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 44.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Hmm, approve a leave of absence request for myself...
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 45.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' That sounds like it could easily lead to a vicious cycle of self-indulgence, something which couldn't be in further violation of protocol.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 46.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' But... I suppose I understand her point.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 47.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' My proclivity to refrain from personal outings does, in part, originate from a sense of responsibility toward my duties. But it is also due to a lack of desire to engage in the human world.
:{{A|vo eqhdj304 8 neuvillette 48.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' But now I see that the human world is indeed full of many interesting places to discover.
:{{DIcon}} I could have told you that.
:;(Quest ends)

;(Talk to Neuvillette, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Lantern Rite marks the start of the new year in Liyue.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj304 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' In the spirit of the season, then, I wish you a year of success as vast and endless as the open ocean.
