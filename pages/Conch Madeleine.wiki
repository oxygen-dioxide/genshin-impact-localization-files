|desc_basic      = A lovely-looking dessert. It is believed that this dessert was created by a cook working for a rich Fontainian family. To cheer their young master up, the cook made a Beryl Conch-shaped cake. The authenticity of this story can no longer be verified, but the cake's delicious taste is beyond doubt.
