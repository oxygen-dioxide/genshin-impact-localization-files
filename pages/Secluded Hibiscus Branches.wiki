|description    = An exquisite tree with blue-lilac flowers growing on its branches. In its presence, it feels as if the atmosphere around it has also become peaceful and relaxed. Even if you travel all across [[Sumeru]], you would find it difficult to locate their habitat. Only in the Realm Within, where all living things grow unrestricted, can you get slightly closer to restoring their true appearance.
