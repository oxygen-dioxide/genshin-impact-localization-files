{{Quote|In the Knights of Favonius, Kaeya is the most trusted aide for the Acting Grand Master Jean. You can always count on him to solve any intractable problems. Everyone in Mondstadt loves Kaeya, but no one knows what secrets this witty, charming knight has...|Description from the Official Website<ref>Official Genshin Impact Website: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/character/mondstadt?char=3 Kaeya]</ref>}}

==Personality==
{{Quote|An accomplished swordsman and a strategic thinker in the Knights of Favonius, rumored to hail from beyond Mondstadt.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
Kaeya is an outwardly confident and charming individual with a flair for drama. He is sometimes seen as overly laid-back and even lazy, but he takes his work seriously. He is surprisingly popular among the elderly of Mondstadt, even earning himself the title of "top candidate for grandson-in-law." His charisma and determination have earned him the admiration, respect, and favor of many people in Mondstadt &mdash; yet, his love for provoking others has also gained him the exasperation of those same people. Kaeya also enjoys putting people into high-stress situations and challenging their values, which he does to both his enemies and his allies alike. He takes pleasure in seeing the hesitation in his comrades' eyes at the moment just before they dive into battle with him, just as he takes pleasure in the look of fear in his enemies' eyes as they face off against him.

He seems to get a kick out of telling bold-faced lies and convincing others to do his work, but this serves him well in his role in the Knights of Favonius. He is a self-proclaimed "anti-hero with an attitude problem;"<ref>[[Manga]] Chapter 2: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/manga/detail/139?mute=1 Flame Born (Part 1)], pg. 2</ref>  as long as everything ends the way he wants, Kaeya does not care about the methods used. Still, according to his informant [[Vile]], he draws the line at working with those who threaten other people's families, believing they deserve to be "hunted down and destroyed."

Despite his extroversion, the Traveler has observed that he appears to struggle with loneliness, though he playfully deflects when confronted about it.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Kaeya|Kaeya's Troubles}}</ref> He frequently reminds the Traveler that they can talk to him, invites them to spend time with him, insistently offers (sometimes extensive) assistance, and often voices his disappointment whenever the Traveler has to leave, showing his desire to be helpful and aversion to being alone.

== Appearance==
Kaeya is a tall young man with a lean build and a tanned complexion. His visible eye is periwinkle with long eyelashes and the same diamond-shaped pupil as [[Dainsleif]]. He has navy-blue hair with streaks of lighter blue, accompanied by a long lock of hair that rests over his left shoulder, cascading down to his waist. His bangs covers the right side of his face and almost hides a plain black eyepatch, which he claims to have inherited from his grandfather, a pirate. However, this was later revealed to be a lie he told to mess with people. It is revealed that he wears an eyepatch not because his right eye is blind, but rather because he was wounded by [[Diluc]] during their battle after [[Crepus]]' death<ref name="hidden strife brick" />; it is implied that there is a scar underneath.<ref name=":0">Event [[Hidden Strife]] Interactable: [[Hidden Strife/Story#Letters in Dawn Winery|A Letter in Beautiful Handwriting (V)]]</ref>

He wears a white-collared, cleavage-revealing blouse adorned by a cape with a fur collar. He wears dark, tight-fitted trousers and knee-length boots. He also wears a loose brown belt from which his [[Vision]] hangs, as well as a rope which may be meant for a scabbard to carry his sword. He has a single earring on his left ear. His outfit, [[Icy Featherflight]], is described to be fashionable and adorned with a fur collar.

Notably, while other Mondstadt characters' Visions feature three feathers per wing, Kaeya's Vision only features two feathers. He is also the only one with a wing on the right side of the back of his Vision (other Mondstadt Visions have those on the left side or no wings at all on the back).

His father had abandoned him in this strange and unknown land to fulfill this mission, and it was Master Crepus and the city of Mondstadt that had welcomed him with open arms when they found him.</p><p>If Khaenri'ah and Mondstadt went to war, which side should he support? To whom should he offer his assistance: his birth father, who had ruthlessly abandoned him? Or his adoptive father, who had loved him and raised him?</p><p>For the longest time, Kaeya had agonized over these impossible questions, caught between the opposing demands of loyalty and duty, faced with an impossible choice between truth and happiness.</p><p>But now, Crepus' death upset this delicate balance.

The clash of crimson fire and azure ice created a sudden swirl of wind that stunned them both. This was the grim moment at which Kaeya's Vision appeared.</p><p>Since that day, Kaeya and Diluc have gone their separate ways. But he never discusses it, just as he never discusses the origin of his Vision.</p><p>Though it is a reminder of a hard-fought battle, and the prize that he earned in exchange for revealing the unadulterated truth, Kaeya sees it as a stern reminder that he must live the rest of his life under the heavy burden of lies.</p>

Kaeya is a major character in the [[manga]], which takes place roughly a year or less before the Traveler's arrival in Mondstadt.

Kaeya and [[Diluc]] rebuff [[Krupp]]'s recruitment attempt for the Fatui. Later, due to the similarities between the powers from the Black Fire Incident and the powers of the Ragnvindr [[Delusion]], Kaeya initially suspects Diluc before discovering that [[Collei]] is the true culprit. Kaeya initially sets out to kill Collei but is stopped by Collei's acceptance of her death as well as the timely arrival of [[Amber]].

Kaeya then enlists Diluc's help; after Diluc poses as the perpetrator of the Black Fire Incident, Kaeya "arrests" Diluc and hands him over to the Fatui to close the case. After Diluc escapes and arrives back in Mondstadt, Kaeya returns Diluc's Vision under the guise of gifting him [[Strange Vase|a vase]].

*[[Birthday/Kaeya]]

==Trivia==
*When cooking a [[Chicken-Mushroom Skewer]], Kaeya has a small chance to create [[Fruity Skewers]] instead.
**His "fruity" skewers don't actually contain fruit; the fruitiness comes from marinating the chicken in sparkling white wine.<ref name="tfn">HoYoverse Chinese News: [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/12147 Teyvat Food Notes - Happy Birthday, Kaeya!]</ref>
* Kaeya's favorite wine is Death After Noon, a particularly strong wine.
* The Steambird's [[The Steambird#Teyvat Food Notes|Teyvat Food Notes]] column (which are blog posts on the Chinese official site) celebrated Kaeya's birthday with a real-life recipe for Fruity Skewers and Death After Noon.<ref name="tfn" />
** The Teyvat Food Notes are written in-character, with Long Erjun (the Traveler) as its columnist. After the recipe for Death After Noon, Long Erjun remarks that he can't drink it.
*In the Chinese version, Kaeya is referred to as [[Diluc]]'s {{Lang|mini=1|zh=义弟|zh_rm=yìdì|zh_tl=sworn younger brother}}, while Diluc himself is referenced as {{Lang|mini=1|zh=义兄|zh_rm=yì xiōng|zh_tl=sworn older brother}}. It indicates that he is likely to be younger than Diluc, though not necessarily so (for example, the birth year of {{w|Guan Yu}} (? – 220), a sworn younger brother of {{w|Liu Bei}} (161 – 223), was traditionally considered to be 160<ref>{{w|zh:关羽#出生爭議|Discussion of Guan Yu's Birth Year (Chinese Wikipedia)}}</ref>).
**"Sworn brothers," in the simplest terms, means "brothers who are not related by blood". It also refers to a delicate bond formed between close friends built from trust and honor.
**In his [[#Vision|Vision Character Story]], Kaeya is referred as {{Lang|mini=1|zh=义子|zh_rm=yìzǐ|zh_tl=foster son}}, Crepus is referred as {{Lang|mini=1|zh=养父|zh_rm=yǎngfù|zh_tl=adoptive father}}, and Kaeya is called {{Lang|mini=1|zh=养子|zh_rm=yǎngzǐ|zh_tl=adopted son}}.
*Kaeya's [https://wiki.biligame.com/ys/%E5%87%AF%E4%BA%9A official Chinese profile] provides some additional information about him:
**The people of Mondstadt find Kaeya a lot easier to deal with than his predecessor, Diluc.
**[[Margaret]], the boss of [[Cat's Tail]] finds his sense of humor amusing.
**[[Bennett]] trusts him as an omniscient big brother.
**[[Flora]] has a good impression of him because his eyes are extraordinarily "deep."
**He has completed mission after mission, constantly proving that he is smart, reliable, and "indispensable."
*Kaeya is mentioned in the description of the Furnishing item "[[Trusty Portable Lamp]]."
*In childhood, Kaeya used his eye patch to play-act as a one-eyed pirate, and to this day claims he inherited it from his grandfather, a pirate.<ref>Pavo Ocellus Act I, part 1: [[Kaeya's Troubles]]</ref> In reality, he currently wears it to hide a scar acquired in his fight with Diluc after their father’s passing, and his birth family, the [[Alberich Clan]], were the ruling regents of Khaenri’ah following the Cataclysm.<ref name="hidden strife brick">Event [[Hidden Strife]] Interactable: [[Hidden Strife/Story#The Brick|The Brick]]</ref>
**In Chapter 7 of the manga, Kaeya is shown wearing an eye patch over his right eye when Crepus dies, implying he has always worn it, even outside of childhood games and prior to his injury.<ref>Manga Chapter 7: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/manga/detail/562 Dusty Chest (Part 2)], page 12</ref>
***The eye patch he currently wears may be a different one from his first, as an older eye patch can be found in a hidden box alongside notes regarding both his birth and adoptive families in the [[Hidden Strife]] event.<ref name="hidden strife brick" />
***Several (though not all) other characters confirmed or presumed to hail from Khaenri’ah, such as [[Dainsleif]] and [[Pierro]], cover the same side of their face in some way, if not their eye. [[Irmin]], the last king of Khaenri’ah prior to its downfall, is also described as one-eyed.<ref name="hidden strife brick" />
**For an unspecified amount of time, Diluc seemingly believed he had blinded Kaeya during their confrontation, a misconception Kaeya privately decided to allow him to continue believing,<ref name="hidden strife brick" /> which he followed through on in a later letter.<ref>Event [[Hidden Strife]] Interactable: [[Hidden Strife/Story#Letters%20in%20Dawn%20Winery|A Letter in Beautiful Handwriting (IV)]]</ref> However, in a message from Diluc to Kaeya sent thereafter, Diluc clarifies that he is aware Kaeya is not blind.<ref name="hidden strife brick" /> In response, Kaeya asserts that even if he isn’t blind, he still has a scar.<ref name=":0" />
*Kaeya is known by these aliases or titles:
**Cavalry Captain
**Master Kaeya (by the Dawn Winery maids)
**Captain Kaeya

===Etymology===
*Alberich, Kaeya's family name, is a German name which means "ruler of supernatural beings (elves)". In Germanic legend, Alberich was a dwarf that guarded the Nibelung's treasure. Alberich was also the name of a prominent character in {{w|Der Ring des Nibelungen}}, a cycle of musical dramas composed by Richard Wagner.
*{{w|Hagen (legend)|Hagen}}, the son of Alberich, has a striking resemblance to Kaeya, Hagen is often described as cunning and one-eyed.
*Kaeya's constellation, Pavo Ocellus, is Latin for "Peacock Eyespot."
