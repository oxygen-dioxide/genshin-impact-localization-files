{{Quote|In the Knights of Favonius, Kaeya is the most trusted aide for the Acting Grand Master Jean. You can always count on him to solve any intractable problems. Everyone in Mondstadt loves Kaeya, but no one knows what secrets this witty, charming knight has...|Description from the Official Website<ref>Official ''Genshin Impact'' Website: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/character/mondstadt?char=3 Kaeya]</ref>}}

==Personality==
{{Quote|An accomplished swordsman and a strategic thinker in the Knights of Favonius, rumored to hail from beyond Mondstadt.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
Kaeya is an outwardly confident and charming individual with a flair for drama. He is sometimes seen as overly laid-back and even lazy, but he takes his work seriously. He is surprisingly popular among the elderly of Mondstadt, even earning himself the title of "top candidate for grandson-in-law." His charisma and determination have earned him the admiration, respect, and favor of many people in Mondstadt &mdash; yet, his love for provoking others has also gained him the exasperation of those same people. Kaeya also enjoys putting people into high-stress situations and challenging their values, which he does to both his enemies and his allies alike. He takes pleasure in seeing the hesitation in his comrades' eyes at the moment just before they dive into battle with him, just as he takes pleasure in the look of fear in his enemies' eyes as they face off against him.

He seems to get a kick out of telling bold-faced lies and convincing others to do his work, but this serves him well in his role in the Knights of Favonius. He is a self-proclaimed "anti-hero with an attitude problem;"<ref>{{Ref/Manga|2|1|pg=2}}</ref> as long as everything ends the way he wants, Kaeya does not care about the methods used. Still, according to his informant [[Vile]], he draws the line at working with those who threaten other people's families, believing they deserve to be "hunted down and destroyed."

Despite his extroversion, the Traveler has observed that he appears to struggle with loneliness, though he playfully deflects when confronted about it.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Kaeya|Kaeya's Troubles}}</ref> He frequently reminds the Traveler that they can talk to him, invites them to spend time with him, insistently offers (sometimes extensive) assistance, and often voices his disappointment whenever the Traveler has to leave, showing his desire to be helpful and aversion to being alone.

==Appearance==
{{See also|Icy Featherflight|Sailwind Shadow}}
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3-4 sentences. Outfits should be described on the outfit pages. -->
Kaeya uses the [[:Category:Tall Male Characters|tall male]] model. He has a tanned complexion and navy-blue hair with streaks of lighter blue, accompanied by a waist-length lock of hair that begins at the base of his scalp on the back of his head at the left. His visible eye is periwinkle with a diamond-shaped pupil that is shared with other characters known to be from [[Khaenri'ah]]. Over his right eye, he wears a gold-trimmed black eyepatch that is mostly covered by his bangs. Kaeya has not been seen without his eyepatch, but his right eye, which is functional, is implied to have a scar over it due to being wounded by [[Diluc]] during their battle after [[Crepus]]' death.<ref name="hidden strife brick" /><ref name=":0">Event [[Hidden Strife]] Interactable: [[Hidden Strife/Story#Letters in Dawn Winery|A Letter in Beautiful Handwriting (V)]]</ref>

Notably, while other Mondstadt characters' Vision casings feature three feathers per wing, Kaeya's Vision on his default outfit only features two feathers. He is also the only one with a wing on the right side of the back of his Vision (other Mondstadt Visions have them on the left side or no wings at all on the back). Kaeya is one of only two characters across all nations who has a Vision with clearly nonstandard casing, with the other character being [[Furina]].

To whom should he offer his assistance: his birth father, who had ruthlessly abandoned him?

Kaeya is a major character in the [[manga]], which takes place roughly a year or less before the Traveler's arrival in Mondstadt.

Kaeya and [[Diluc]] rebuff [[Krupp]]'s recruitment attempt for the Fatui. Later, due to the similarities between the powers from the Black Fire Incident and the powers of the Ragnvindr [[Delusion]], Kaeya initially suspects Diluc before discovering that [[Collei]] is the true culprit. Kaeya initially sets out to kill Collei but is stopped by Collei's acceptance of her death as well as the timely arrival of [[Amber]].

Kaeya then enlists Diluc's help; after Diluc poses as the perpetrator of the Black Fire Incident, Kaeya "arrests" Diluc and hands him over to the Fatui to close the case. After Diluc escapes and arrives back in Mondstadt, Kaeya returns Diluc's Vision under the guise of gifting him [[Strange Vase|a vase]].

==Trivia==
* When cooking a [[Chicken-Mushroom Skewer]], Kaeya has a small chance to create [[Fruity Skewers]] instead.
** His "fruity" skewers don't actually contain fruit; the fruitiness comes from marinating the chicken in sparkling white wine.<ref name="tfn">HoYoverse Chinese News: [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/12147 Teyvat Food Notes - Happy Birthday, Kaeya!]</ref>
* Kaeya's favorite wine is Death After Noon, a particularly strong wine. Death After Noon is a reference to the cocktail Death in the Afternoon, also known as Hemingway Champagne.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Charles}}</ref>
* The Steambird's [[The Steambird#Teyvat Food Notes|Teyvat Food Notes]] column (which are blog posts on the Chinese official site) celebrated Kaeya's birthday with a real-life recipe for Fruity Skewers and Death After Noon.<ref name="tfn" />
** The Teyvat Food Notes are written in-character, with Long Erjun (the Traveler) as its columnist. After the recipe for Death After Noon, Long Erjun remarks that he can't drink it.
* Kaeya and his relationships with other members of the [[Ragnvindr Clan]] are referred to with the following terms in the original Chinese version of his [[#Character Details|Character Details]], his [[#Vision|Vision story]], [[Hidden Strife/Story#The Brick|an interactable]] during [[Hidden Strife]], {{Quest|Destined Encounter}}, {{Quest|Bonds of Melody}}, {{Quest|Taste of Home}}, and [[Flame Born]] (Chapter 2 of the [[manga]]):<!-- this is not supposed to be a comprehensive list, but who else is going to lay everything out like this without an agenda in either direction... -->
** [[Diluc]]'s {{zh|义弟|rm=yìdì|tl=sworn younger brother,}}<!-- Kaeya's Vision story x1 --> while Diluc is referred to as {{zh|义兄|rm=yì xiōng|tl=sworn older brother.}}<!-- Manga chapter 2 x1, Kaeya's Character Details x1, Kaeya's Vision story x2 -->
*** The latter term is also used by [[Dwarkanath]] to describe her adoptive brother [[Iradj]].
*** These terms make it likely that Kaeya is younger than Diluc, but not guaranteed. (For example, the birth year of {{w|Guan Yu}} (? – 220), a sworn younger brother of {{w|Liu Bei}} (161 – 223), was traditionally considered to be 160.<ref>Chinese Wikipedia: {{w|zh:关羽#出生爭議|Discussion of Guan Yu's Birth Year}}</ref>)
*** The meaning of "sworn brothers" is complex and usually refers to a delicate bond built from trust and honor between close, unrelated friends.
** Diluc's {{zh|兄弟|rm=xiōngdì|tl=brother}}.<!-- Kaeya's Vision story x2, Hangout x2 -->
** A {{zh|义子|rm=yìzǐ|tl=foster son}} to the Ragnvindr Family<!-- Kaeya's Character Details x1 --> and [[Crepus]]'s {{zh|养子|rm=yǎngzǐ|tl=adopted son,}}<!-- Kaeya's Hangout x1, Vision story x2 --> while Crepus is referred to as {{zh|养父|rm=yǎngfù|tl=adoptive father}}<!-- Kaeya's Vision story x1 --> and {{zh|义父|rm=yìfù|tl=adoptive father.}}<!-- The Brick x1, Bonds of Melody x1, Destined Encounter x2 -->
* Kaeya's [https://wiki.biligame.com/ys/%E5%87%AF%E4%BA%9A official Chinese profile] provides some additional information about him:
** The people of Mondstadt find Kaeya a lot easier to deal with than his predecessor, Diluc.
** [[Margaret]], the boss of [[Cat's Tail]] finds his sense of humor amusing.
** [[Bennett]] trusts him as an omniscient big brother.
** [[Flora]] has a good impression of him because his eyes are extraordinarily "deep."
** He has completed mission after mission, constantly proving that he is smart, reliable, and "indispensable."
* In childhood, Kaeya used his eye patch to play-act as a one-eyed pirate, and to this day claims he inherited it from his grandfather, a pirate.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Kaeya's Troubles}}</ref> In reality, he currently wears it to hide a scar acquired in his fight with Diluc after their father's passing, and his birth family, the [[Alberich Clan]], were the ruling regents of Khaenri'ah following the cataclysm.<ref name="hidden strife brick">Event [[Hidden Strife]] Interactable: [[Hidden Strife/Story#The Brick|The Brick]]</ref>
** In Chapter 7 of the manga, Kaeya is shown wearing an eye patch over his right eye when Crepus dies, implying he has always worn it, even outside of childhood games and prior to his injury.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|7|2|pg=12}}</ref>
*** The eye patch he currently wears may be a different one from his first, as an older eye patch can be found in a hidden box alongside notes regarding both his birth and adoptive families in the [[Hidden Strife]] event.<ref name="hidden strife brick" />
*** Several (though not all) other characters confirmed or presumed to hail from Khaenri'ah, such as [[Dainsleif]] and [[Pierro]], cover the same side of their face in some way, if not their eye. [[Irmin]], the last king of Khaenri'ah prior to its downfall, is also described as one-eyed.<ref name="hidden strife brick" />
** For an unspecified amount of time, Diluc seemingly believed he had blinded Kaeya during their confrontation, a misconception Kaeya privately decided to allow him to continue believing,<ref name="hidden strife brick" /> which he followed through on in a later letter.<ref>Event [[Hidden Strife]] Interactable: [[Hidden Strife/Story#Letters in Dawn Winery|A Letter in Beautiful Handwriting (IV)]]</ref> However, in a message from Diluc to Kaeya sent thereafter, Diluc clarifies that he is aware Kaeya is not blind.<ref name="hidden strife brick" /> In response, Kaeya asserts that even if he isn't blind, he still has a scar.<ref name=":0" />
* Kaeya is the first character to have both a [[Story Quest]] and [[Hangout Event]].
* Kaeya is known by these aliases or titles:
** Cavalry Captain
** Master Kaeya (by the Dawn Winery maids)
** Captain Kaeya
* {{Furnishing Mentions|Kaeya}}

===Etymology===
* Alberich, Kaeya's family name, is a German name which means "ruler of supernatural beings (elves)." In Germanic legend, {{w|Alberich}} was a dwarf that guarded the Nibelung's treasure. Alberich was also the name of a prominent character in {{w|Der Ring des Nibelungen}}, a cycle of musical dramas composed by Richard Wagner.
* {{w|Hagen (legend)|Hagen}}, the son of Alberich, has a striking resemblance to Kaeya, Hagen is often described as cunning and one-eyed.
