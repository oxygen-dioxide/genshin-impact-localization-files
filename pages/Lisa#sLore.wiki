==Personality==
{{Quote|The languid but knowledgeable Librarian of the Knights of Favonius, deemed by Sumeru Akademiya to be their most distinguished graduate in the past two centuries.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}

Lisa is a proficient witch; as such, she enjoys everything related to the elements and items that would help her understand them. Despite her position as Librarian, Lisa takes it somewhat haphazardly as she appears to be relatively bored dealing with normal books, instead preferring those in the restricted section. She still takes the job seriously nonetheless, and will personally go out to collect books that are long overdue, albeit in a way that she can still enjoy the smaller things in life.

Her haphazard, carefree personality comes from her time in [[Sumeru Akademiya]], as while studying there she noticed the types of effects the pursuit of knowledge can have on a person. She studied in the Spantamad school for two years and left Sumeru shortly after graduating,<ref name=":0" /> relegating herself to categorization and management of the library and usually refusing to take any other duties unless absolutely necessary. Despite repeated pleas from [[Gafoor]] to return to the Akademiya, Lisa refuses to give up her life in Mondstadt. 

When Lisa is angered, the surrounding air near her becomes electrified in part due to her Electro Vision. Depending on the severity of what has angered her, she can either be simply irritated or become extremely scary, the latter also causing her to dispense "appropriate" punishment.

Lisa seems to be fond of the [[Traveler]], and sometimes acts flirtatious, referring to them as "cutie" or "darling," and admitting that they're special to her.<ref>{{Ref/Companion|Lisa}}</ref>

She loves tea and thinks that afternoon tea is the most important part of her day. She sometimes takes tea with vegetable soup as she once used to enjoy this with [[Jean]] at the [[Good Hunter]] restaurant. She also suffers from cucurbitophobia, a fear of pumpkins.

'''The Librarian Â· Lisa'''<br>
"There'll be time for this later... Come sit and chat with me."

<nowiki>===============================</nowiki>

Lisa, Librarian of the Knights of Favonius, has great wisdom that is unparalleled throughout the city. She always knows what to do with whatever troubles Mondstadt.

But with so many careless readers and overdue books to deal with, Lisa often gets tired and a bit... drowsy. Never disturb her when she's taking her morning, midday, or evening naps. Otherwise you will come to understand why she is an outstanding knight &mdash; in an electrifying way...

              --><p>It is known that Lisa chose to return to [[Mondstadt]] after two years of advanced study in Sumeru, but the reason for her decision is not. At present, Lisa's job is to oversee the book collection in the library owned by the Knights.</p>

              --><p>The only time that the citizens of Mondstadt see Lisa is when lending or returning library books.</p><!--
              --><p>In both scenarios, they tend to encounter Lisa sitting at the counter like a languid cat, yawning as she signs books in and out.</p><!--
              --><p>At times, her behavior causes people to doubt whether she is really up to the task of being librarian for the illustrious Knights of Favonius.</p><!--

|text3         = <p>The fact that [[Cyrus (Sumeru)|Cyrus]] of the Sumeru Akademiya frequently refers to Lisa as their "best student in two hundred years" is all that needs to be said about Lisa's accomplishments in her studies.</p><!--
              --><p>From outlandish forbidden knowledge, to the handling of elementally infused flora, to the most efficient methods of distilling wine... where there is a body of knowledge, the chances are that Lisa is acquainted with it.</p><!--
              --><p>This, paired with her ability to explain things clearly and concisely, makes Lisa the sensible person to approach for young knights and alchemists with burning questions.</p><!--

              --><p>To visit during unacceptable hours &mdash; such as in the morning while Lisa is sleeping in, or in the afternoon while she's enjoying her tea &mdash; can spell disaster for unsuspecting visitors.</p>

              --><p>However, though her attitude to life may appear at first to be one of ruthless efficiency, it is in fact better understood as a product of her incorrigibly lazy nature, which drives her to avoid troublesome issues at all costs.</p><!--
              --><p>By negotiating with [[Kaeya]], she offloaded the job of restocking and dispensing medication to [[Huffman]] and [[Swan]], and had [[Flora]] start sending [[Donna]] over to deliver herbs on a daily basis.</p><!--
              --><p>The only tasks that Lisa handles personally are the categorization and management of books and other documents.</p><!--

              --><p>This was much to the consternation of the company's Field Officer, [[Nymph]], who resented the idea of an academic coming in at such a high-ranking position.</p><!--
              --><p>At Kaeya's suggestion, a practice combat session was arranged in which Lisa and Nymph would both display their magical proficiency.</p><!--
              --><p>Two minutes into the session, Lisa graciously declined the captaincy on the grounds that "Nymph manifestly possesses the requisite ability to fulfill the role."</p><!--
              --><p>For the whole year following, the Grand Master received a constant stream of referral letters from Nymph in relation to the captaincy, and the only person ever named in them was Lisa Minci.</p><!--
              --><p>Eventually, the Grand Master began turning over the referral letters to Lisa directly, but every time, Lisa would come up with an excuse to decline the offer.</p><!--
              --><p>Undoubtedly, the 8th Company would have been far stronger under her lead, but she deemed that such a level of power was not only superfluous to requirements, it would also be risky for her in a way that most people could never appreciate.</p><!--
              --><p>To be clear, Lisa is quite confident that she could handle any situation she came up against. However, additional danger means an additional workload &mdash; and that is something that she would never be able to accept.</p>

              --><p>Put off by this realization, Lisa decided to leave Sumeru.</p><!--
              --><p>Since then, Lisa has always stopped short of taking things too seriously.</p><!--

              --><p>These words she has spoken to just three people since arriving in Mondstadt. In each case, it was because she knew it was what they needed to hear.</p>

              --><p>Lisa spent an enormous budget and commandeered the alchemy workshop for two full weeks in order to build this extraordinary piece of equipment.</p><!--
              --><p>She boasts that the cauldron is capable of completing any precision heating task to perfection with a maximum of just two pulls of a lever.</p><!--
              --><p>But her most common application for it is to brew tea and keep it at the optimal temperature while she is managing her books.</p><!--

              --><p>After all, understanding the elements is essential to the study of magic, and practical experience is a far more useful means of acquiring this understanding than trying to assimilate the knowledge contained in dusty old books.</p><!--
              --><p>"Hmm... I suppose I shall need a Vision, then."</p><!--
              --><p>And just like that, as that thought popped into her mind, her Vision popped into her hand.</p><!--
              --><p>With the aid of her Vision, Lisa acquired the knowledge that she sought. But she also sensed the deep secret hidden in the shadows of that knowledge.</p><!--
              --><p>For whatever reason, the gods gave humans the key to changing everything, but they did not explain the cost involved. Lisa grew fearful of the truth.</p><!--
              --><p>The Vision that hung from her neck became to her a bottomless pit filled with sweet delights, lingering at the back of her mind.</p><!--
              --><p>So, from time to time, when somebody whom she finds interesting comes along, Lisa will pass onto them her understanding on all kinds of matters.</p><!--
              --><p>Perhaps she is secretly hoping that by doing so, one day someone will come along who has the ability to understand the ultimate truth behind Visions.</p>

Lisa is a supporting character in the [[manga]], which takes place roughly a year or less before the Traveler's arrival in Mondstadt.

She assisted the investigation into the Black Fire Incident by compiling reports for the Knights of Favonius to read through. She also contacted her teacher to request assistance in deciphering the ancient language found on one of the Fatui's files. Due to her request, [[Cyno]] traveled to Mondstadt and was able to seal the archon residue<ref group="Note">Due to localization adjustments made after the manga's release, the term "archon residue" is no longer accurate. The original Chinese term refers to gods that predate the rise of [[The Seven]].</ref> inside [[Collei]]. Lisa also assisted Collei in writing a letter to [[Amber]] in which Collei thanked Amber and said she left for [[Sumeru]] with Cyno.
