==Personality==
{{Quote|The languid but knowledgeable Librarian of the Knights of Favonius, deemed by Sumeru Akademiya to be their most distinguished graduate in the past two centuries.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}

Lisa is a proficient witch; as such, she enjoys everything related to the elements and items that would help her understand them. Despite her position as Librarian, Lisa takes it somewhat haphazardly as she appears to be relatively bored dealing with normal books, instead preferring those in the restricted section. She still takes the job seriously nonetheless, and will personally go out to collect books that are long overdue, albeit in a way that she can still enjoy the smaller things in life.

Her haphazard, carefree personality comes from her [[Vision]], as while the gods gave it to her and she was sated with knowledge she wanted to learn, they did not tell her what the price was, and she began fearing the truth behind them.><ref>{{Ref/VO|Lisa|More About Lisa: V}}</ref> This in turn caused her to become rather paranoid, and she left Sumeru out of fear that she was paying too high a price for knowledge, relegating herself to categorization and management of the library, usually refusing to take any other duties unless absolutely necessary.

When Lisa is angered, the surrounding air near her becomes electrified in part due to her Electro Vision. Depending on the severity of what has angered her, she can either be simply irritated or become extremely scary, the latter also causing her to dispense "appropriate" punishment.

Lisa seems to be fond of the [[Traveler]], and sometimes acts flirtatious, referring to them as "cutie" or "darling," and admitting that they're special to her.<ref>{{Ref/Companion|Lisa}}</ref>

She loves tea and thinks that afternoon tea is the most important part of her day. She sometimes takes tea with vegetable soup as she once used to enjoy this with [[Jean]] at the [[Good Hunter]] restaurant. She also suffers from cucurbitophobia, a fear of pumpkins.

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3 paragraphs with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Lisa has fair skin, green eyes, and wavy, light honey-brown hair, which is tied in a loose side ponytail.

She wears a purple and white dress with open slits at the sides and gold embroidery, along with black gloves with pale purple trim, a large witch's hat, black lace stockings, and black high heels, and an earring is visible on one ear. She wears a gold necklace with her Vision clasped to the collar of her dress.

Reflecting her favorite flower, a motif of roses is present throughout her outfit. There is a pale purple rose pinned to her hat, and a similar one on the tie of her ponytail. Additionally, a large ornamental golden rose is attached on her belt at the hip. Her outfit, [[Purple Rose]], is described to be a slim-fit dress adorned with roses that displays a young lady's elegance.

<nowiki>===============================</nowiki>

Lisa, Librarian of the Knights of Favonius, has great wisdom that is unparalleled throughout the city. She always knows what to do with whatever troubles Mondstadt.

But with so many careless readers and overdue books to deal with, Lisa often gets tired and a bit... drowsy. Never disturb her when she's taking her morning, midday, or evening naps. Otherwise you will come to understand why she is an outstanding knight — in an electrifying way...

Lisa is a supporting character in the [[manga]], which takes place roughly a year or less before the Traveler's arrival in Mondstadt.

She assisted the investigation into the Black Fire Incident by compiling reports for the Knights of Favonius to read through. She also contacted her teacher to request assistance in deciphering the ancient language found on one of the Fatui's files. Due to her request, [[Cyno]] traveled to Mondstadt and was able to seal the archon residue<ref group="Note">Due to localization adjustments made after the manga's release, the term "archon residue" is no longer accurate. The original Chinese term refers to gods that predate the rise of [[The Seven]].</ref> inside [[Collei]]. Lisa also assisted Collei in writing a letter to [[Amber]] in which Collei thanked Amber and said she left for [[Sumeru]] with Cyno.
