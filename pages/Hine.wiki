==Profile==
Hine was [[Mavuika]]'s younger sister and a member of the [[Scions of the Canopy]], who lived 500 years ago.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Echoes of Life}}</ref> In adulthood, Hine became an artist and an architect who helped rebuild the tribe, though her works did not survive to the present day.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Past and Future}}</ref>

After Mavuika achieved the position of [[Pyro Archon]], Hine was still a child when Mavuika informed her, after their parents, that she intended to sacrifice her life to the [[Sacred Flame]] to travel 500 years into the future to ensure [[Natlan]]'s long-term safety. Hine acknowledged that she couldn't live that long, but still insisted to Mavuika that she would "find a way to meet again."

As an architect, Hine wrote an architecture manual documenting her designs and illustrations of her constructions, along with detailed notations, as Natlan recovered from the devastation of the [[Cataclysm]]. After spending her life helping to rebuild the Scions of the Canopy, she inserted an origami frog between the pages that she had folded before Mavuika told her about sacrificing herself and left it in the safekeeping of another Huitztlan family that her work had helped, with instructions to give it to Mavuika when she returned.

500 years later, Mavuika attempted to find information on Hine at the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]] tribe, but [[Citlali]] was unable to find any information on her life. While visiting the site where her family's home once stood, a young girl about Hine's age descended from the Huitztlan family found her and finally passed on the manual, in which Mavuika found the origami frog and realized that Hine had indeed found a way to meet up again.

Hine would visit Mavuika in a dream like many of the deceased in the [[Night Kingdom]] did after the massive [[Abyss]] assault on Natlan, though Mavuika kept that information to herself.

While Mavuika was separated from the [[Traveler]] during their final assault on the Abyss infestation within the Night Kingdom, Hine met up with her, choosing to appear as the child her sister knew her last. Mavuika confirmed that she had received Hine's manual, to her sister's pleasant surprise, as Hine has some doubts about whether it wouldn't get lost or thrown out by someone moving house or a similar situation.
