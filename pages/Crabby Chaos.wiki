==Steps==
# Defeat the attacking Armored Crabs

==Request Details==
{{Quest Description|Armored Crabs are causing trouble...}}
===Request from Wei Xiaobao===
"Tales of Humanity":<br><!--
-->Oh my, the crabs in Fontaine are ginormous!<br><!--
-->At first I just couldn't understand why Fontainians don't seem to like eating crab when there are clearly so many of them literally on your doorstep.<br><!--
-->...Until one day, when I was chased at least two miles by an {{color|buzzword|Armored Crab}}, that is! What's got into these crazy crustaceans?

===Request from Hubel===
"Tales of Humanity":<br>
To the editorial department of The Steambird: On a recent evening stroll by the river, Mr. Louis was assaulted by {{color|buzzword|Armored Crabs}} and had a nasty fall.<br>
As a result, poor Mr. Louis has been unable to set up his stall for a whole day.<br>
I have a particular eye for news stories &mdash; something I have acquired over many years &mdash; and I can say with confidence that this is headline-worthy material, hence why I have written in.<br>
Editorial department: Thank you for your contribution. We believe that this story would not feel out of place in our "Tales of Humanity" section.
