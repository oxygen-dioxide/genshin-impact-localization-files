==Lore==
When [[Och-Kan]] became king of Ochkanatlan, he tried to force [[Ix Uxul Tz'ib Bolon Ch'ule-L|the dragon]] within the [[Old Core of Chu'ulel]] to power the city for him, as its mechanisms only responded to draconic energy. However, she refused to obey him. Och-Kan then "enslaved" his own draconic half to create a new Core of Chu'ulel that he alone could control. 

At some point, Och-Kan placed his "mind" inside the Core of Chu'ulel in order to fight alongside his people. 
He become inactive afterwards, but placed at least one [[Secret Source Automaton]] in the vicinity to guard the core. Och-Kan's mind was reawakened shortly after the [[Cataclysm]] by the adventurer [[Bona]], after which he took the form of [[Cocouik]].

Over time, the Light Core itself deteriorated due to [[Abyssal Corruption]]. In the {{Quest|Palace of the Vision Serpent}}, the Traveler and Paimon cleanse the Abyssal energy in the area, but the core seems to lose the last of its vitality. All that remained was a piece of [[Pyrophosphorite]].
