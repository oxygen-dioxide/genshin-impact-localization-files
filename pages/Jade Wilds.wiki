|description    = A quiet, serene landscape on the outskirts of Inazuma. A shrine made of Otogi Wood stands tall amongst the Sakura trees, the maple trees, and the colorful flowers. The candlelight flickers, blending in with an intangible sense of majesty and stability. Everywhere, the falling petals seem to be touched by spirituality.
