{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Entering Kuisel's Clockwork Workshop)
:'''???:''' ...W&mdash;We shouldn't do that, right? I mean, why can't we...
:'''???:''' You good-for-nothing wimp! Since when did I say you could tell me what to do?
:'''???:''' But I... I mean we...
:'''???:''' Quiet, fool! I hate you so much, you useless good for nothing! You ought to be left here alone to rot... You hear me? Now shut up and rot!
:'''Paimon:''' It sounds like two people are arguing. What's going on...

;(Approach the cage)
:'''???:''' K&mdash;Kind {{MC|m=Mister|f=Miss}}, help me... Please...

;(Talk to the trapped person)
:'''???:''' A&mdash;Are you two here for the research assistant position? S&mdash;Sorry, but I'm a little busy at the moment...
:{{DIcon}} I can tell.
:{{DIcon}} We're just here to look around.
::'''???:''' H&mdash;Here for a tour? O&mdash;Of course, you're most welcome to.
:'''Paimon:''' Never mind that for now. Why are you locked up in a cage?
:'''Kuisel:''' I had some disagreements with a research partner... Coutrot... he left me here to calm down a little. Th&mdash;That's right... I haven't introduced myself yet. You can call me Kuisel.
:'''Kuisel:''' Ugh, you know... Kuisel's Clockwork Workshop &mdash; that Kuisel.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon is Paimon, and {{MC|m=he|f=she}}'s {{Traveler}}... Paimon did hear the sound of arguing just now. So that guy who sounded really mad is actually your research partner, huh?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe it's time to change your partner.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah! A good partner should be like Paimon... {{Traveler}} is super lucky to have a partner like Paimon!
:{{DIcon}} Anyway, we'll leave you to calm down by yourself.
::'''Paimon:''' Hey!
:'''Kuisel:''' C&mdash;Could you please help get me out of here? If you can find a way to activate the energy storage device beside me, then the door sh&mdash;should open.
:'''Kuisel:''' P&mdash;Please! Those who came here before for the research assistant position also couldn't tolerate his violent temper, so they left as soon as they could. We're the only ones left here now...
:'''Paimon:''' Well, seeing as that's the case, let's give him a hand then, {{Traveler}}!

;(Talk to Kuisel again, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' On that note, is it really okay for us to be messing with stuff like the terminals here?
:'''Kuisel:''' I&mdash;It's okay. Everything here is... well-designed.

;(After operating the Energy Transfer Terminal)
:'''Paimon:''' That was actually pretty easy. But there really was no way for someone to get out on their own if they were locked inside.

;(After opening the door)
:'''Paimon:''' The door's already open. Aren't you going to come out?
:'''Kuisel:''' A&mdash;Actually, there is one more thing I was too scared to mention... If I were to leave this cage now, I'm a&mdash;afraid this place could blow up.
:'''Paimon:''' Blow up?
:'''Kuisel:''' Th&mdash;That's right... Like I said earlier, my research partner's got... a violent temper, which is why he installed a trigger mechanism under the cage.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh!? Then what should we do now?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe we can try putting a heavy object in his place?
::'''Kuisel:''' O&mdash;Ordinary heavy objects won't work, I'm afraid... The way it works is rather complicated. Ugh...
:{{DIcon}} There's no other way. We'll go seek help at the Court of Fontaine.
::'''Kuisel:''' Th&mdash;There's no need to go through all that trouble...
:'''Kuisel:''' If you could take my spot temporarily, kind {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Miss}} {{Traveler}}... and wait in the cage a bit. Then I... I can go disable this special trigger mechanism.
:'''Kuisel:''' A&mdash;After all, I've worked with him for years, and I know exactly what he was thinking when he put it in place.
:{{DIcon}} I don't think I'm heavy enough. Maybe Paimon should also...
::'''Paimon:''' B&mdash;But look, Paimon's floating in midair, so Paimon definitely has no weight!! Yeah, no weight!
::'''Kuisel:''' Uh... this mechanism is extremely particular and doesn't work simply based on weight.
:{{DIcon}} Sounds a little suspicious...
:'''Kuisel:''' Please believe me. All you need to do is stay in my place for a moment, and I'll be back from disabling the mechanism before you know it.
:'''Kuisel:''' ...Perhaps you've heard of the [[Fontaine Research Institute]], or Mr. [[Raimondo]] and Mr. [[Bossuet]]? I... I was once mentored by them.
:'''Kuisel:''' Th&mdash;These kinds of technical matters are not difficult and will not take long to handle. All I need is a quick moment...
:'''Paimon:''' Well... alright then. But be quick!
:{{Black Screen|Very carefully, you swap places with Kuisel...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Why's the door shut again?
:'''Kuisel:''' Uh... M&mdash;Maybe it malfunctioned somewhere. I... I'll go check it out...
:{{DIcon}} This doesn't feel right.
:'''Kuisel:''' D&mdash;Don't worry, I'll fix it as quickly as I can. The terminal to disable the trigger mechanism isn't here, so I've got to leave momentarily. Hold on.
:'''Paimon:''' Guess we have no choice but to wait patiently.
:{{Black Screen|You wait for some time...}}
:'''Paimon:''' What could be taking him so long... Something didn't happen to him, right? But he said earlier that it was just him and his partner left here...
:{{DIcon}} Maybe he got locked up again by that partner of his...
::'''Paimon:''' Eh??
:{{DIcon}} I think we've been tricked.
::'''Paimon:''' You're saying he lied to us?
:'''???:''' I used to wonder, can kindness really be labeled as a good quality? Those filled only with kindness... what good does it even bring them?
:'''Paimon:''' ...Huh? Who's talking?
:'''???:''' There was never a trigger mechanism that could set off an explosion. The door of the cage is indeed locked now, however. Well, what will the two of you do? Keep waiting here, or take action...
:'''Paimon:''' What's this guy on about!? Also, his voice sounds... like Kuisel's, but also like the one he was arguing with before. What's going on?
:{{DIcon}} Let's find a way to get me out of here first...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, right! But... but you're locked inside this cage. How are we supposed to unlock the door...
:{{DIcon}} It's all on you, Paimon. Save me!
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Don't be so dramatic!
:'''Paimon:''' But luckily, Paimon didn't end up getting locked in the cage with you... Uh... Paimon should be able to open the door the way we did before, right? Let's give it a try!
:'''Paimon:''' Let's see... There are two terminals and two energy storage devices here. If Paimon can activate the energy storage device beside the door, then the cage should be able to open!
:'''Paimon:''' Where should Paimon go? To the terminal by the door, or the one by the cage?
:{{DIcon}} Check out the terminal by the door.
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm, this doesn't seem quite right...
:;(Return to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} Try the terminal by the cage.
::'''Paimon:''' Let Paimon see...
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon can see the door Kuisel exited from here. What should Paimon do now?
::{{DIcon}} Activate the energy storage device by the cage.
:::'''Paimon:''' Umm, Paimon can't see it from this angle...
::;(Return to option selection)
::{{DIcon}} Activate the energy storage device by the door.
:::'''Paimon:''' Okay.
:::'''Paimon:''' The terminal on the door lit up! Paimon should be able to see more from over there, right?
:::'''Paimon:''' Paimon can see a bigger door from here! What should Paimon do now?
:::{{DIcon}} Go back to the angle from the terminal on the opposite side.
::::'''Paimon:''' Huh? Okay then...
::::'''Paimon:''' Paimon can see the door Kuisel exited from here. What should Paimon do now?
::::{{DIcon}} Activate the energy storage device by the cage.
:::::'''Paimon:''' Umm, Paimon can't see it from this angle...
::::;(Return to option selection)
::::{{DIcon}} Go back to the angle from the terminal on the opposite side.
:::::'''Paimon:''' Huh? Okay then...
::::;(Return to option selection)
:::{{DIcon}} Activate the energy storage device by the cage.
::::'''Paimon:''' Leave it to Paimon!
::::'''Paimon:''' Tada! How'd Paimon do? Paimon's not so useless after all, right?
::::'''Paimon:''' Anyways, what's the deal with that Kuisel guy exactly? Paimon seriously doesn't get it... Let's go look around where he left. Maybe there's something we can find.

;(Explore past the door)
:'''Paimon:''' It looks pretty deep in there. Paimon wonders where this path leads...

;(Reach the room at the end of the path)
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon never imagined there to be this much space inside. This place doesn't seem like some clockwork workshop, though. How strange!

;(Interact with "Friendly Reminder")
:'''Kind Reminder:''' Closing all valves will activate the terminal and open the path.
:'''Paimon:''' "Friendly Reminder?" Sounds fishy...
:'''Paimon:''' Well... it doesn't look like we have any other clues, so wanna just try and see where it leads?

;(Approach the bottom of the room)
:'''Paimon:''' There's nobody here, and the door's locked... There should be a way to open it, right? Maybe there's a clue nearby...

;(After a certain amount of time passes){{Verify}}
:'''Paimon:''' Now that Paimon thinks about it, {{color|buzzword|the pipes here are leaking gas}}. That could be really dangerous! Maybe there's a {{color|buzzword|way to stop these leaks}}...

;(After closing all the valves)
:'''Paimon:''' We can continue onward now, right?

;(After opening the door)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Watch out, {{Traveler}}!
:'''???:''' Well? I prepared a little gift for the two of you. How do you like it?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't like this! Paimon doesn't like this one bit! Paimon's getting mad!

;(Descend with the lift)
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't know who this guy is, but it's obvious he doesn't mean well!
:'''Paimon:''' If we just keep going, we'll be able to catch him for sure! C'mon, let's keep looking ahead, {{Traveler}}!

;(Reach the room at the end of the path)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? What are these? There doesn't seem to be a way through, either...
:'''Paimon:''' Will there be one up there? But how should we get up?

;(After connecting all the pipes)
:'''Paimon:''' That's how we get up there? But where does it lead to?

;(Explore past the door)
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh... Paimon doesn't like this place...
:'''Paimon:''' Just what is this place exactly? It's like a maze...

;(Engage the Annihilation Specialist Meka)
:'''???:''' How can there not be clockwork meka in a clockwork meka workshop? You guys agree, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Right is right... No, that's not right! What kind of workshop builds clockwork meka that attack people on sight!

;(Approach the door)
:'''Paimon:''' Another closed door!? And the people who were speaking just now are silent... But he can definitely see us, right? Otherwise, why would...
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Just who are you? Come on out!

;(Approach the clockwork meka on standby)
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's got a bad feeling about this... She's sure they'll suddenly start moving soon!
:'''Paimon:''' Better to just keep our distance for now...

;(After a certain amount of time passes)
:'''Paimon:''' Could it be like last time, where we had to solve some kind of puzzle to keep going? Still, where's the puzzle?
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, we should still take a look around!

;(Descend through the hole in the arena)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah! Paimon didn't think there'd be a lower level...
:'''Paimon:''' What the heck is this terminal for? Is this a riddle left for us by that weirdo?

;(After connecting all the pipes)
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, is that it? Paimon doesn't know if there's been any changes outside...

;(Activate the terminal)
:'''???:''' And who said that what a research terminal opens must be the door, hmm?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon knew those weren't decorations! Paimon's had enough!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't care who he is! She's definitely gonna get some payback! Uh, wait, Paimon meant to say "we"!

;(Ascend with the lift)
:'''Paimon:''' It's still not over? And just where does this lift go, anyway...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's getting confused...

;(Enter the large room)
:'''???:''' Wh&mdash;What now... I can't faze them at all...
:'''???:''' To get here is already something... It will be perfect if they can get through our tests! Perfect proof of their value as research material...

;(Approach the people with clockwork mekas)
:'''Paimon:''' Kuisel! There you are!
:'''Paimon:''' And the one next to him... must be that villainous research partner Coutrot that Kuisel was talking about!
:'''Bricole:''' ...? He's Coutrot, not me. I'm Bricole.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Isn't he Kuisel?
:'''Coutrot:''' Kuisel... is just a convenient character. You've already passed many trials, so there's no reason to hide anything from you anymore. My name is Coutrot, and I'm the real owner of this workshop.
:'''Coutrot:''' Haha, you two are truly... great research material. If you are willing to help me with my research...
:{{DIcon}} What research? Tell us a bit more about it.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, c'mon! Are you really going to help someone this fishy?
:'''Paimon:''' Nothing about this place looks like a proper workshop! You also lied to us and made the clockwork meka attack us... Paimon has no reason to believe you're a good guy!
:'''Bricole:''' That's exactly right! Don't fall for his trap! He... He's an extremely vicious crook!
:'''Bricole:''' I followed the clues here while investigating. I didn't expect you to continue your dangerous research even after you were kicked out, and you even stole the Research Institute's assets for this purpose...
:'''Bricole:''' You've committed a crime!
:'''Coutrot:''' You really can't keep your mouth shut, eh, Bricole... You're just a good-for-nothing idiot. I'll take care of you once I've properly appraised our two VIPs over here.
:'''Paimon:''' Your two VIPs... You don't mean us, right?
:'''Coutrot:''' Of course, you only need to pass one last trial to prove your true worth...
:'''Coutrot:''' Time to show me what you've got!

;(After defeating Coutrot)
:'''Coutrot:''' You guys again... You're more skilled than I thought. You are truly the best research material I've ever seen! Far beyond what I can control, though... I admit I've lost.
:'''Paimon:''' Just what is up with this guy!?
:'''Bricole:''' Yep, that's a pretty common reaction to him. You see, his... more peculiar research was exactly what got him kicked out from the Fontaine Research Institute in the first place.
:'''Coutrot:''' My research was not peculiar...
:'''Bricole:''' Yeah yeah, and that's what you told the Ethics Committee back in the day as well. Don't think a single person bought what you said.
:{{DIcon}} So... what was his research?
:'''Bricole:''' Ahem... If you wish to learn more about his research, you may go to the new Fontaine Research Institute to apply for access.
:'''Paimon:''' That gives Paimon a headache just thinking about it...
:'''Bricole:''' It's giving me a headache too. Even though he's been fired, the asset theft case I've been investigating still has to do with him...
:'''Coutrot:''' Haha, do you want to ship me off to the [[Fortress of Meropide]]?
:'''Bricole:''' Well, that's not up to me to decide. The law will hand you your proper judgment. It's a shame that, unlike last time, we can't simply resolve matters by kicking you out.
:'''Bricole:''' Either way, thank you both for your help. I probably wouldn't have been able to bring him down myself... You can leave the rest to me. I promise that this time, he will receive his proper punishment.
:'''Bricole:''' *sigh* I'm afraid I'll still have to return to this place to continue my work. There are so many assets... Just how many reports would I have to compile...
