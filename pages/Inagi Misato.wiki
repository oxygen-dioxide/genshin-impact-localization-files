'''Inagi Misato''' was a shrine maiden who lived 500 years ago and was a friend of the [[Kitsune Saiguu]]. She is a member of the Inagi Clan and an ancestor of [[Inagi Hotomi]].<ref name="YC">{{Ref/Quest|Yougou Cleansing}}</ref>

==Profile==
Misato is offhandedly mentioned by [[Hanachirusato]], who was born out of the filth containing the Kitsune Saiguu's memories. Because the Kitsune Saiguu died during the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago, Hanachirusato's knowledge of the present day is not yet up-to-date at the time she meets the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]], and she is prone to forget that times have changed.

During the {{Quest|Sacrificial Offering}}, if players choose a certain dialogue option referring to "Miss Inagi," Hanachirusato asks if this Inagi's name was Misato. After Paimon replies that her name is Hotomi, Hanachirusato remembers that there is no way Misato can still be alive.

Later, Hanachirusato mentions the fact that Misato's lineage is still going as one of the things which relieves her about Inazuma's present state.<ref name="YC" />
