|description    = The Flatcrest Fulmar is a large seabird that nests in [[Fontaine]] and is named after its flat, white crest.<br>As a bird that feeds on fish, the Flatcrest Fulmar has developed extremely keen senses to track fish. Unfortunately, these abilities are of no practical use in the Serenitea Pot. With no fish to hunt, they can only circle over the landscape aimlessly, doing nothing all day but eat the food Tubby prepares, fly around, or sleep. So, [[Tubby]] has been thinking about making a pond with fake fish to provide them with entertainment...
