:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 louqua 01.ogg}} '''Louqua:''' Unbelievable... No signs of Abyssal corruption whatsoever. The same goes for the Pyro Archon.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 louqua 02.ogg}} '''Louqua:''' In that case, just get some rest, and enjoy your victory.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That means... There's officially nothing to worry about!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You won, hahahaha! You actually won!
:{{DIcon}} Finally, it's time to relax.
::{{A|vo ntaq303 8 paimon 03a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon knew you could do it! The Abyss is no match for you!
:{{DIcon}} Finally, someone to speak for me.
::{{A|vo ntaq303 8 paimon 03b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is that all Paimon is to you...? You know what? Never mind. You get a free pass on all Paimon-teasing today!

:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' And now, Natlan is finally free from the threat of the Abyss!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Welcome back, great hero... I can't wait to tell your story to everyone!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' We should record it on a woven scroll, too. That way, your story will be preserved in my tribe for generations to come.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 olorun 02.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' I'm sure the Grannies and Gramps back home are already on it.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Amazing job, {{Traveler}}. Becoming the first outlander with an ancient name definitely makes you a legend.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 xilonen 01.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' The [[Lord of the Night]] was right to place her trust in you. She chose the perfect name.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Th&mdash;The most important thing is that you made it back safe! Now, I don't have to worry about the rescue plan!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You came up with a rescue plan?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 kachina 02a.ogg}} {{A|vo ntaq303 8 kachina 02b.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' W&mdash;Well, {{Traveler}} already saved me once. So, yeah... If things got risky down there, I was gonna charge in and rescue {{MC|m=him|f=her}}!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' I don't think it would be quite so simple, [[Kachina]]. But, still...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' If something like that really did happen, I'd come for you, too, no matter what it took.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Couldn't have said it better myself!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Bravery aside, I try not to act on impulse... But, I suppose there's an exception to every rule.
:{{DIcon}} Before you praise me too much...
:{{DIcon}} I have something to say.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 hero 01.ogg}} {{A|vo ntaq303 8 heroine 01.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' In the [[Ley Line]]s, I encountered many souls of the dead, and I could hear everyone rooting for me from above.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, really? Who did you see?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 hero 02.ogg}} {{A|vo ntaq303 8 heroine 02.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' I saw [[Atea]], [[Vichama]], [[Chuychu]], and all [[Heroes of Natlan|six heroes]] from five hundred years ago... Not to mention, I heard the messages you left for me in my [[Ancient Name|ancient name]].
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 hero 03.ogg}} {{A|vo ntaq303 8 heroine 03.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' I have to thank each and every one of you.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 hero 04.ogg}} {{A|vo ntaq303 8 heroine 04.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' Without your help, I could never have defeated an enemy as strong as the Abyss.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 olorun 03.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' So, you heard everything we said...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 xilonen 02.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' Those messages became part of your name during the forging process. I just didn't expect them to come in handy at such a crucial moment...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 iansan 05.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' To think that you heard them, though... T&mdash;That's a little embarrassing...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hey, what's embarrassing about that? I'll say it again right now!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Being your friend makes me so happy! Hehehe~
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...Heh, good one, Chuychu.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Things are looking lively over here. How are you feeling, {{Traveler}}?

:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Great, just what I wanted to hear.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The preparations for your celebration ceremony are almost complete.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Celebration ceremony?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' According to tradition, we hold a celebration ceremony for our most outstanding warriors after their final [[Pilgrimage]].
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' In most cases, "outstanding" means warriors who earned more than twenty victories in the [[Night Warden Wars]].
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' It's an exceedingly rare honor. You can think of it almost like a lifetime achievement award.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 olorun 04.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' We haven't held one of those ceremonies in a long time, though...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 mavuika 07a.ogg}} {{A|vo ntaq303 8 mavuika 07b.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' True, but given {{Traveler}}'s exceptional contribution to this victory, I think {{MC|m=he|f=she}} is more than worthy of the honor.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Let's head to the center of the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame|Stadium]], and I'll announce the honor to everyone. You deserve a formal round of applause for this achievement.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Oooh, then I'm gonna grab the best seat in the house!
:;(She rushes off)
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 kachina 03.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Wait, I&mdash;I'm coming, too!
:;(Kachina hurries to catch up with Mualani.)
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 iansan 06.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' [[Kamera]]... This calls for a Kamera...
:;(Iansan rushes off to locate one.)
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Haha, slow down! There's no rush!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mavuika, if this ceremony is to celebrate defeating the Abyss, don't you deserve the same honor?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' What's the point of holding a victory feast for yourself? Besides, I'm already the Pyro Archon &mdash; that's enough honor for a lifetime.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 8 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Let's go. Everyone's waiting for us.
:;(The scene transitions to the middle of the stadium)
:{{A|vo ntaq303 9 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Today, Natlan's long struggle against the Abyss has met its end.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 9 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Many fought for this day and gave their lives for this cause &mdash; we must not forget them, or the heroic outlander who lent us their aid.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 9 mavuika 03a.ogg}} {{A|vo ntaq303 9 mavuika 03b.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' {{MC|m=His|f=Her}} ancient name, "{{Rubi|Tumaini|Hope}}," will be immortalized in the history of Natlan.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 9 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' From this point on, there will be no more Night Warden Wars, and I pray the [[Ode of Resurrection]] will never again need to bring back the fallen.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 9 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' We fought for a singular purpose &mdash; peace. And now, it has been achieved.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 9 mavuika 06a.ogg}} {{A|vo ntaq303 9 mavuika 06b.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The funeral to commemorate the fallen will be held on a later day. In the meantime, our hero will embark on a parade of blessings. Let us send {{MC|m=him|f=her}} off with a round of applause.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 9 mavuika 07a.ogg}} {{A|vo ntaq303 9 mavuika 07b.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' And show {{MC|m=him|f=her}} the warmth and gratitude of our people!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 9 together 01.ogg}} '''Crowd:''' Wohoooooo!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 9 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Go on, this is your moment. You should savor it.
:{{DIcon}} But... what about you?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 9 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Now that the threat of the Abyss has been eliminated, we finally have a chance to restore the [[Night Kingdom]].
:{{A|vo ntaq303 9 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I'll take care of that first.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay! We'll look forward to good news!

:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 citlali 05.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Anyway, that's not the important part! It's about Mavuika's death &mdash; her fate hasn't changed at all.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!?
:{{DIcon}} But, we both made it back!

:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 citlali 07.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' That's why I came to find you. I need to know what I'm missing.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 citlali 08.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Where is Mavuika right now? Did she tell you what she's planning?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She said she was going to restore the Night Kingdom... Compared to fighting the Abyss, that should be pretty easy, right?
:{{DIcon}} After all, the corrosion should be gone by now...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 citlali 09.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Easy... not so much. We can't restore the Ley Lines without the Lord of the Night, and I'm not sure she has enough power to do it on her own.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 citlali 10.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' The Lord of the Night is weak right now. She told us that herself, remember? I'll admit &mdash; restoring the Ley Lines is simpler than reconstructing them entirely, but it's still no easy feat...
:{{DIcon}} You've got a point...
:{{DIcon}} Otherwise, Mavuika wouldn't need to get involved.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' True... If the Lord of the Night could restore the Ley Lines by herself, all Mavuika would need to do is tell her we won.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 citlali 11.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Not even that. The Lord of the Night knows the Ley Lines better than anyone. I'm sure she knew of your victory before us all.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 citlali 12.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Point being, this matter is far more complicated than the Archon made it out to be. We need to get to the bottom of this.
:{{DIcon}} But, why would she hide the truth from us?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 citlali 13.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Mavuika has accepted her death, remember? For her to let someone else dictate her end, there can be only one possibility...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 citlali 14.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' She must think the outcome of her death... is worth it.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 citlali 15.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' The moment Mavuika used the [[Ruler of Death]]'s power, death was demanded in return &mdash; not necessarily as repayment for her aid, but as a "rule."
:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 citlali 16.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' That means Mavuika doesn't have to just sacrifice herself to the Ruler of Death. She can still use her death to get something in return.
:{{DIcon}} Like... dying for a cause?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then, let's get going! Where do you think she went? Could it be where we found the [[Remnants of the Secret Source (Beneath the Secret Source)|Source Mechanism]]?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 citlali 17.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' The Lord of the Night should now be able to appear anywhere in Natlan. What we need to know is where the Ruler of Death can be summoned.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 citlali 18.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' According to the Lord of the Night, the Ruler of Death is one of the shining [[Four Shades|Shades]], an extremely elusive figure. Even woven scrolls dating back thousands of years have nearly no mentions of her.
:{{DIcon}} Mavuika once met [[Xbalanque]].
:{{DIcon}} She told us about it before.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right! Xbalanque created the rules of Natlan by borrowing power from the Ruler of Death &mdash; that means he's met her before!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 20 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, do you think Xbalanque could have met the Ruler of Death in Cinder City, the one they call... [[Ochkanatlan]]?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 20 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' It's very likely. After all, Ochkanatlan was built on the site of a [[Chichen Uctokah|previous Dragon city]] &mdash; it's known as the first city of the [[Pyro Archon]].
:{{A|vo ntaq303 20 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright! Then, let's head over right away!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 citlali 22.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' It's not easy to get there, so follow me &mdash; I'll take you.

:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 godofdeath 01.ogg}} '''Ronova:''' I have grown weary of the endless wait. The fate of this land is of no interest to me anymore.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 godofdeath 02.ogg}} '''Ronova:''' However, you humans managed to meet the expectations of the [[Heavenly Principles]]... For that result, you deserve praise.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 godofdeath 03.ogg}} '''Ronova:''' Mavuika, as the price for using my power, I shall now bear witness to your death.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 godofdeath 04.ogg}} '''Ronova:''' And with you, the war that your nation has waged for more than a thousand years shall meet its end.

:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Closing the final chapter on the plan that has consumed Natlan for five hundred... no, for the entirety of our history.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' We've eradicated the Abyss from Natlan, but its power remains in worlds beyond [[Teyvat]], tremendous and unyielding.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Only by completely restoring the Night Kingdom can we defend against its corrosion in the long run.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' But, the architect of the Night Kingdom is near her end. She lacks the power for such a task.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Worse still, if her life force is depleted, the rules of Natlan disappear along with her.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' We have no need for the Ode of Resurrection right now, but it remains Natlan's strongest defense should the Abyss return one day.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' So, you're planning to...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Yes, my plan is to once again place my life within the Sacred Flame.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Five hundred years ago, I gave my life for the chance to be reborn in this era.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' A chance to see all my plans to completion. And now, to sustain the Lord of the Night, I will give my life once more.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 nightmare 01.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' I respect your decision, Mavuika, but this method requires an immense sacrifice.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 nightmare 02.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' The flames of your life force are exceedingly strong, but a life sustained by fire is one destined to die out one day. What will you do then?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 11.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I've thought about that... With the Abyss out of the picture for now, the Sacred Flame's power will be consumed at a much slower rate. My life force should be able to sustain it for another two or three hundred years.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 12.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Future Pyro Archons will continue to seek new sources of fire. As long as Natlan's legacy endures, the Night Kingdom will survive, impervious to the Abyss.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 godofdeath 05.ogg}} '''Ronova:''' Once again, you place hope in the hands of the future...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' But, the Pilgrimage can replenish the power of the Sacred Flame! We can give it that meaning! Why shoulder this burden by yourself?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 13.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Because, I want the Pilgrimage to change.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 14.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The Pilgrimage was an essential part of our struggle against the Abyss &mdash; a grand competition full of promise and glory. But, it also chained our people to an inescapable destiny.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 15.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Fear and anxiety have been our constant companions. We knew what the consequences would be if we laid down our arms. Morality left us with no other choice.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 16.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' And so, Natlan became the nation of war.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 17.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' This is where Xbalanque defeated the dragons and granted our people the liberation of their flesh. And now, in the same place, I have the chance to grant them the liberation of their spirit.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 18.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' There will be no war, only competition &mdash; one fueled by our dreams for the future rather than a desperate struggle for survival.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 19.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' A new future deserves a new meaning, a chance to take a definitive step forward.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 citlali 04.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' ...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 nightmare 03.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' Very noble indeed, but what does any of this have to do with you? You speak of duty, but not yourself.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 nightmare 04.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' In my eyes, Mavuika, you are not inherently special &mdash; a child of Natlan among countless others.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 nightmare 05.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' Yes, the situation is urgent and the Ley Lines must be restored right away, but it is too heavy a burden for you to shoulder alone.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 20.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' That is where we differ, Lord of the Night. You see all humans as the same, but I understand what it means to be a leader.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 21.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' A leader is swift and decisive in the face of reality.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 22.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Someone capable of making the "right choice" even when there are no good options on the table.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 23.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Sacrificing the remainder of my life to help Natlan overcome this crisis... That is the right choice.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 24.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' After all, leadership is built on the trust of ordinary people. Without them, there is no Archon.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 25.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The people look to their leader to make the world a better place and stand up for them when it counts.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 26.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' For that reason, I must see my duty through to the very end.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 citlali 05.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' But, what about you, Mavuika? You still haven't talked about what you want...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 citlali 06.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Is it that unimportant to you?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 27.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' It's not important, Citlali.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 28.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' There is nothing more important than protecting the future we built together!
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (It's hard to argue with her logic. She probably knew we would come and prepared what to say in advance.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (It's time for Natlan to enter a new era, and I know she wants to fulfill her duty as a "leader," but...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (She deserves to have a place in the future she built with her people.)
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 godofdeath 06.ogg}} '''Ronova:''' I shall accept Mavuika's sacrifice for the Lord of the Night as her death, and I will bear witness to the very end.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 godofdeath 07.ogg}} '''Ronova:''' Thus concludes the deal I made with Xbalanque several thousand years ago.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 godofdeath 08.ogg}} '''Ronova:''' Lord of the Night, you may now begin.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 nightmare 06.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' ...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 godofdeath 09.ogg}} '''Ronova:''' What are you waiting for?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 nightmare 07.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' There is another who wishes to take part in the ceremony, and I cannot disregard their intentions. I must wait for them to arrive.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 29.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Another...?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 godofdeath 10.ogg}} '''Ronova:''' *sigh* I was to bear witness to a death, and now the situation is increasingly tenuous.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 godofdeath 11.ogg}} '''Ronova:''' If the life of this second individual fails to meet my requirements, I fear I may lose my patience.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 nightmare 08.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' Rest assured, his life will hold equal value. I am the helper of humanity, and I must always place their demands first, no matter who the human may be.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 godofdeath 12.ogg}} '''Ronova:''' Hm, cumbersome, but there is nothing to be done &mdash; such is the duty of an [[angel]].
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 citlali 07.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Wait, this feeling...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' *panting*... We made it.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 thecaptain 01.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' Thank you for showing me the way.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[The Captain]]!?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 30.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The other individual you mentioned... It was him?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 nightmare 09.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' Indeed. Like you, he carries many lofty ideals.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 thecaptain 02.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' Mavuika, I understand how you feel, and if I were an ordinary mortal, I would have no reason to stop you.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 thecaptain 03.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' But, like you, I have been waiting for this day for too long, and I can offer a better solution.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 thecaptain 04.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' You created this new future, and you deserve to guide its direction. Your life should not end here.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 thecaptain 05.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' But, death... is the end I have been trying to reach all along. I have come this far to use my death to open the gates of the Ley Lines to my people.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Your people!?
:{{DIcon}} Wait, the souls I saw in my dream?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 thecaptain 06.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' That's right. They have been with me for the past five hundred years.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 olorun 02.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' But, how!? Carrying that many souls within you... There's no way you could keep your consciousness intact!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 olorun 03.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' Besides, you weren't affected by the Source Mechanism like I was.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 thecaptain 07.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' Do you still remember the voice that you "heard"?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 thecaptain 08.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' It came from my heart. With the help of technology from Khaenri'ah, my heart was modified to convert memories and souls from the Ley Lines into knowledge.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 thecaptain 09.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' As a result, I became extremely sensitive to souls and developed the ability to sense their presence... much like yourself.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 thecaptain 10.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' After encountering countless lost souls during the disaster five hundred years ago, I forsook the capacity for knowledge granted by the modification and used my heart as a vessel instead.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 thecaptain 11.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' The lives of my comrades, as well as many Natlanese, have been stored here ever since.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 mavuika 31.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' And you want to... send them home?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 thecaptain 12.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' Yes. The Ley Lines will not accept them. But, by merging my existence with the Lord of the Night, I can become master of the Ley Lines and change the rules entirely.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 nightmare 10.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' He expressed this to me, and I agreed.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 nightmare 11.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' The Captain envisions a kinder and fairer set of rules for humanity. In addition, he aims to challenge the authority of the Ruler of Death... In a word, his goal is revenge.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' R&mdash;Revenge!?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 thecaptain 13.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' After all, it's because of her that I bear the curse of immortality, the curse of absolute life.

:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 thecaptain 14.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' Then, bear witness to my resolve and hatred.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 22 thecaptain 15.ogg}} '''"The Captain":''' The people of [[Khaenri'ah]] committed grave sins, and for that we were cursed to suffer endless physical torment, cursed to witness the demise of everything we held dear.

:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Captain, he...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' The curse of immortality still exists. Does that mean... The Captain will never move from this place?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Lord of the Night, is The Captain still with us?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 nightmare 01.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' There is no need to pursue traces of him. For those cursed with immortality, release from the mortal coil is the greatest form of peace.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Even so, please pass on my gratitude.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' His long journey has finally come to a close. I suppose... this is a happy ending for him.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I cannot imagine how much pain he endured over the past five hundred years... or how much strength it took to never stray from his goal.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 olorun 02.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' There's something I've been trying to figure out... I don't think I ever saw him sleep.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 olorun 03.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' I tried to ask him about it on the way here, but he didn't answer. Just like always, he never talks about himself...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 nightmare 02.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' It's probably due to the voices.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 nightmare 03.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' When souls merge in a single being, their voices echo endlessly through the mind.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 nightmare 04.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' Souls that retain memories of their death often scream and wail in despair... Considering the number of souls inside him, that effect would be even greater.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, over the past five hundred years, he didn't sleep... at all?
:{{DIcon}} No wonder [[Dainsleif|Dain]]'s method of slowing the decay of his body...
:{{DIcon}} Didn't work for him.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Without experiencing the curse of immortality, we will never truly know his agony.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' But, I can see why his hatred for the Ruler of Death was so strong.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' In the end, he used that immortality to his advantage and granted the Lord of the Night eternal life by fusing his existence with hers.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 citlali 04.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Well fought, Captain.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 nightmare 05.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' You may wonder why the Night Kingdom, a land of souls, was unable to accept the souls adrift on the surface...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 nightmare 06.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' The reason lies in the Heavenly Principles' modifications to the Ley Lines. The original purpose was to help counter the Abyss. And so, their stability was paramount.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 nightmare 07.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' But, at one point in time, Natlan's Ley Lines were decimated. Even after reconstruction, the rules needed for the Ode of Resurrection made it impossible to reconnect the Ley Lines to other nations.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 nightmare 08.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' That unique quality is precisely what drew The Captain to Natlan.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Did he try the same thing in other nations?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 nightmare 09.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' Yes, but all those attempts ended in failure.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 nightmare 10.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' He fought to save Natlan not only to defeat the Abyss, but because this is the only land where the souls within him could find salvation.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 nightmare 11.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' We met not long ago to talk about that very possibility, and I confirmed the feasibility of his plan.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 nightmare 12.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' I, too, recognized the need to change the rules of the Ley Lines, not only for the souls that wander this land, but for the outlanders that may perish here in the future...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 nightmare 13.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' In the eyes of the Heavenly Principles, that kind of change is extremely risky, if not impermissible... But, as an Angel, I have a duty to serve humanity &mdash; such is my mandate.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 citlali 05.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Thank you for everything.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 nightmare 14.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' Citlali, when I gave you the [[Pilgrim's Chronicle]], I said something rather pessimistic to you... Do you remember?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 nightmare 15.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' How many years of life are enough? Ten? One hundred? I thought it made no difference...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 nightmare 16.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' But, now, I have the chance to live forever. I am immensely grateful to humanity for this gift, and I am deeply sorry I thought so little of it in the past.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 citlali 06.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' You don't need to thank us. You bear a heavy responsibility.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 nightmare 17.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' Heavy? No. That responsibility is the purpose of my existence.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 nightmare 18.ogg}} '''Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night:''' Farewell, humans, creators of miracles. A new era awaits you.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 citlali 07.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Looks like she returned to the Night Kingdom.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 olorun 04.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' So, this was The Captain's goal all along...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 olorun 05.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' He fought to the end for all those souls and challenged the rules of the world in the process.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' He was an outstanding warrior.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' He took on a burden that was meant for me and even brought about a better outcome... It would seem I lost this duel.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' He was right &mdash; Natlan needs a leader to guide its future. If not a successor, then that responsibility will continue to be mine to bear.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' But, for now, let us pay our final respects to this fallen hero.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 citlali 08.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' ...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 23 olorun 06.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} ...

;(A cutscene plays in Mavuika's office. As a written letter set at the edge of the brazier is slowly consumed by the flames, she's returned to her easel, painting with decisive strokes.)
:{{A|vo ntaq303 24 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' To my sister, [[Hine]].
:{{A|vo ntaq303 24 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I know all that remains in the Night Kingdom is your memory, but I still wanted to write a short letter to tell you about the situation after the war.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 24 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' After countless partings and farewells, Natlan has finally entered an era of peace.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 24 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The Pilgrimage is still a popular tournament, but now, it's only purpose is to showcase the thrill of competition rather than select warriors for war.

:{{A|vo ntaq303 24 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Our cultural legacy is not rooted in our suffering. In this era of peace, Natlan's fire will burn brighter than ever.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 24 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' With the restoration of the Night Kingdom, our people are now free to leave our borders, and many have set their sights on the wonders of Teyvat.

:{{A|vo ntaq303 24 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I'm sure many exciting and eye-opening adventures await them.

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Pass by the rock with a graffiti of the Traveler)
:{{A|vo ntaq303 25 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, is that part new? Paimon's never seen it before!

;(Approach the ceremonial site)
:{{A|vo ntaq303 25 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' We are gathered here today to bid farewell to all who lost their lives in this war.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 25 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' This struggle has caused us profound pain and brought us face to face with loneliness and loss.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 25 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' But, through it all, our bravery and resolve never wavered, and we never lost sight of victory.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 25 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Even the tiniest of sparks can unite to become a blazing fire.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 25 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' They lit our way forward and showed us the path to victory.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 25 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' When our homeland is revived, and life blooms again, they will return to us with the first rain of spring.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 25 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' It is just as our poem describes:
:{{A|vo ntaq303 25 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' "We are the inheritors of memory and legend."
:{{A|vo ntaq303 25 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' "Those who grew alongside sun and wind."
:{{A|vo ntaq303 25 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' "Those who forged our own destiny and future."
:{{A|vo ntaq303 25 mavuika 11.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' "That is Natlan's fire, the lifeblood of our nation."
:{{A|vo ntaq303 25 mavuika 12.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The fallen are never truly lost to us. We will be reunited one day.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 25 mavuika 13.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' And as we create new legends and write new poems in honor of our beloved homeland, they will always be with us.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 25 mavuika 14.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Their deeds immortalized in our memory, and their names immortalized in stone.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 25 mavuika 15.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' This epic will be remembered in the actions of every valiant warrior and brave saurian, all equally important and indispensable.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 25 mavuika 16.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I would also like to take the time to recognize a [[Fatui Harbinger]] who sacrificed his life for our cause.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 25 mavuika 17.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' He was a warrior from Khaenri'ah who helped defend our nation five hundred years ago, a man who used his own heart as refuge for the souls of the fallen. For the chance to offer them a final resting place, he chose to fight with us once again.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 25 mavuika 18.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' In the end, he fulfilled his wish and returned the souls to the Ley Lines. By turning his curse into a weapon, he defeated his fated foe and protected me in the process.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 25 mavuika 19.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' We have had our differences in the past, and I cannot say his character is representative of all in his organization...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 25 mavuika 20.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' But, on this occasion, we honor him as one of our own. In Natlan, all heroes are worthy of celebration.

;(Talk to Chasca, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' After you got back, you mentioned that you saw [[Chuychu]] in the Night Kingdom... So, she helped you, then?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, she brought a lot of [[Saurian]]s.
:{{DIcon}} And helped get through a tricky part of the Night Kingdom.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Good. I'm sure that made her happy.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 chasca 04.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} There's still time.
:{{DIcon}} To see her in your dreams.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 chasca 05.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' It's alright. I don't think she's going to come see me.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 chasca 06.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' She's probably sick of nagging her older sister.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 chasca 07.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Still, thank you for telling me. Natlan has a bright future because of you, and I have {{sic}} chance to make up for my regrets.

;(Talk to Mualani or Kachina, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hey, did you hear? As long as we get permission from our chief, we can leave Natlan as much as we want!
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 kachina 01.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' Yeah, it's because the Ley Lines have been restored, right? And the Lord of the Night is a lot stronger now!
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' That means we can finally see the outside world for ourselves!
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I heard that [[Fontaine]] has a HUGE ocean! That is totally my vibe! I can't wait to go see it!
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 kachina 02.ogg}} '''Kachina:''' I wanna go to [[Liyue]]! The mountains are supposed to be super tall!
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Sounds like the makings of a great vacation! Let's start planning!
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' But, first, we all promised we would go to the hot springs together! Hehe, then we'll be "hot spring buddies" for life!

;(Talk to Iansan, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Muscles grow stronger through periods of strain, and people work the same way.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Even though the crisis is over, we will still band together for the sake of a new future!
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Oh, and you should really come to the [[Collective of Plenty]] sometime. Especially you, Paimon &mdash; your nutrition plan is already set!
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay... Um, so you can help Paimon get stronger, right?
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 paimon 03a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 paimon 03b.ogg}}--> '''Paimon:''' If something like this happens again, Paimon wants to fight by {{Traveler}}'s side!
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Haha, of course! You've got serious potential!

;(Talk to Kinich or Ajaw, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 ajaw 03.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Strange... Why does no one praise the deeds of the Almighty Dragonlord, K'uhul Ajaw?
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 ajaw 04.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Does no one care about my heroism? A great hero such as myself, forced to remain nameless. Hmph, ignorant fools...
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Fine, I guess you helped out. Good job.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 ajaw 05.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Well, well, well... A compliment! After all these years! It's about time you knew your place, lowly servant.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 ajaw 06.ogg}} '''Ajaw:''' Hey! Why are you glaring at me? Oof&mdash;

;(Talk to Citlali, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 citlali 01.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' My teacher once said, "the weight of fate is decided by the one who has to bear it."
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 citlali 02.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' You helped Natlan overcome a cruel fate. From now on, we will always be there to help you.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 citlali 03.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Now, we just need to see where your fate... no, "our fate" leads us.

;(Talk to Ororon, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 olorun 01.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' When [[Guthred]]'s soul possessed my body, all I saw was a dark abyss.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 olorun 02.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' The Captain carried countless souls within him. It must have taken so much strength to live like that for hundreds of years...
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 olorun 03.ogg}} '''Ororon:''' For us, his death is something sad. But for him... maybe it finally allowed him to be at peace.

;(Talk to [[Rotchev]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 rotchev 01.ogg}} '''Rotchev:''' My lord, you will forever serve as an example for all your soldiers.

;(Talk to [[Huamanga]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 huamanga 01.ogg}} '''Huamanga:''' I knew about The Captain's immense strength, but I never expected him to have a such a strong sense of honor.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 huamanga 02.ogg}} '''Huamanga:''' No matter how prejudiced I may have been in the past, he now has my utmost respect.

;(Talk to Xilonen, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 xilonen 03.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' The stories of heroes will continue to be passed down from generation to generation.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 xilonen 04.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' If Natlan faces a crisis again, I'm sure people will look to our story as a source of hope.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 xilonen 05.ogg}} '''Xilonen:''' We've earned our place in history... That's pretty surreal, don't you think?

;(Talk to [[Luta]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 luta 01.ogg}} '''Luta:''' When I was little, my father told me about Thrain, the "Sentinel Knight," an outlander who once fought alongside the warriors of Natlan.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 luta 02.ogg}} '''Luta:''' He was brave, fearless, and deeply respected by his men. I always wished I could go back in time and see him in action...
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 luta 03.ogg}} '''Luta:''' I never thought that, in my lifetime, another outlander would fight to save this land, or that I would get the chance to fight by their side. I will treasure this honor for the rest of my life.

;(Talk to [[Chimalli]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 chimalli 01.ogg}} '''Chimalli:''' Just like the Archon said &mdash; we can now proudly tell our children that this war is a thing of the past. It's a new chapter for all of us.
:{{A|vo dialog ntaq303 chimalli 02.ogg}} '''Chimalli:''' We will never forget your contribution, and Natlan will always be with you. May the Sacred Flame protect you in all the journeys to come.

:'''Monument:''' "This monument commemorates the <NUMBER> brave warriors who gave their lives in the War for Natlan."<ref group="Note" name="deathcount">The death count varies among players, and is the same number players got for "Total Deaths" at the end of [[No One Fights Alone]]</ref>

;(Read the right-side inscription, optional)
:'''Monument:''' "And alien tears will fill for them, pity's long for their names."

;(Approach Mavuika)
:{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Ah, our hero is here! Is there something you want to discuss?
:{{DIcon}} About the stances of the [[Heavenly Principles]] and the [[Four Shades|Shades]]...
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02a 1.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The forces of the [[Abyss]] have always sought to corrode Teyvat. The Ley Lines were created by the Heavenly Principles, and it is only with their protection that Teyvat is able to nurture all forms of life.
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02a 2.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' If the Abyss had {{sic|free reign|expected=free rein}}, this world would become a living hell. We saw that for ourselves...
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02a 3.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Any attempt by humanity to harness the power of the Abyss is met with swift punishment. The Heavenly Principles and the Shades show no mercy in that regard.
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02a 4.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' That unyielding approach is also the source of great sorrow and hatred... The situation goes beyond a simple discussion of "right" versus "wrong."
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02a 5.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Perhaps the truth will reveal itself during your future adventures.
::;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About the [[Ode of Resurrection]] somehow taking effect before victory...
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02b 1.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Oh, isn't it obvious?
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02b 2.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The Ode of Resurrection didn't take effect at all.
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02b 3.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Your own strength is what allowed you to keep fighting, as well as the moral support from everyone in Natlan.
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02b 4.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Still, "moral support" is also an important, if under appreciated, effect of the Ode of Resurrection.
::;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About Natlan's [[Gnosis]]...
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02c 1.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The Captain's subordinates sent us a letter he left behind. After our duel at the Stadium, he asked the [[Tsaritsa]] to remove him from the responsibility of obtaining the Gnosis, and his request was granted.
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02c 2.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The Captain respected the outcome of that match and refused to violate his principles. But, since this is the final Gnosis, I doubt the Tsaritsa will let the situation stand.
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02c 3.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Perhaps a replacement Harbinger will be sent here soon. I'll make sure to be prepared.
::;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About the next stop on my journey...
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02d 1.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' A direct conflict with the [[Fatui]] is unavoidable the moment you step foot in [[Snezhnaya]].
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02d 2.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' So, make sure you're ready for any scenario. On a related note, I've acquired some new intel about the fragment that suddenly appeared in [[False Sky|the sky]].
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02d 3.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Such fragments are known as "Ancient Moon's Remnants," relics of [[Secret Source Automaton|Secret Source technology]] from the era of the [[Seven Sovereigns|Ancient Dragons]]. Coincidentally, a small squad of Fatui infiltrated our borders around the same time it appeared.
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02d 4.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Our investigation revealed them to be subordinates of [[Dottore|The Doctor]]. Their stronghold is in [[Nod-Krai]], a land with a long history not far from Snezhnaya.
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02d 5.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The people there can use a very special power. It is said that this mysterious power predates even the seven [[element]]s of Teyvat.
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02d 6.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Ancient Moon's Remnants, The Doctor, a mysterious power... The project that connects all three must be ambitious indeed.

:{{DIcon}} About the tribe my ancient name will belong to...
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02e 1.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Tribe? Oh, you're thinking along the lines of how the names of the six heroes were inherited...
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02e 2.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' In truth, apart from a few ancient names associated with a certain tribal culture or tradition, most ancient names can be inherited by anyone.
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02e 3.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Your name likely falls under that category. The Wayob will select someone who shares your character and name them as your successor.
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 02e 4.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Of course, that won't happen for a very long time.
::;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} I don't have any other questions...
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The long journey of the Pyro Archon has now come to an end. Together, we overcame darkness and death to accomplish something truly remarkable.
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' As we celebrate your glory, allow me thank you once again &mdash; this time, just as "Mavuika."
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Thank you for the respect, understanding, and support every step of the way.
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 hero 01.ogg}} {{A|vo ntaq303 26 heroine 01.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' It was my honor.
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' An honor we share.
::{{A|vo ntaq303 26 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' You can keep chatting with your friends nearby. I think I'll stay here for now... and watch over them.

;(Pay respects at the monument)
:{{DIcon}} Salute
:{{A|vo ntaq303 27 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What are you thinking about, {{Traveler}}?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 27 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, the battle, right? Even though we won in the end, it cost a lot to get to this point, huh...
:'''Monument:''' "Sing your final song with pride, like a hero's march to the other side."
:'''Monument:''' "This monument commemorates the <NUMBER> brave warriors who gave their lives in the War for Natlan."<ref group="Note" name="deathcount" />
:{{DIcon}} ...
::{{DIcon}} Let's leave this for them.

:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 cucuya 01.ogg}} '''Cucuya:''' C'mon! Tell us! Tell us!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 01.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' Well, you kids don't miss a beat, do you?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 02.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' Alright, you can be the first audience for this new tale. Let me know what you think.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 03.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' Now, where to begin...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wanna stop and listen to the story? Sounds pretty fun!
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 04.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' This is a story of the great heroes of our time.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 05.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' There are three great heroes at the center of this tale.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 06.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' The first is an outlander known as "{{Traveler}}."
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 07a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 07b.ogg}}--> '''Sadigua:''' A warrior of great strength, completely immune to the power of the Abyss.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 08a.ogg}} {{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 08b.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' Most importantly, {{Traveler}} is kind and brave, someone who treasures those around {{MC|m=him|f=her}}. You could call {{MC|m=him|f=her}} a natural-born hero!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 soncco 01a.ogg}} {{A|vo ntaq303 28 soncco 01b.ogg}} '''Soncco:''' Yeah, {{MC|m=he|f=she}}'s super strong! Tell us more!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 ayun 01.ogg}} '''Ayun:''' Hey, just let him finish the story!
<!-- Camera pans to the Traveler and Paimon nearby -->
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The man telling the story keeps looking this way, {{Traveler}}. Paimon thinks he recognizes you...
:{{DIcon}} Well, we've really made a name ourselves in Natlan.
:{{DIcon}} Listening to all this is a little embarrassing, though...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 09.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' The second hero is also an outlander.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 10.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' Many years ago, he forged a connection with this land and used his body as a vessel for the souls of his fallen comrades.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 11.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' His goal was to give them a home and, with that, a chance to be reborn into this world.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 12.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' The third hero is none other than our current Archon, Mavuika!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 13.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' Not only is she a powerful and respected figure, but she also commands the power of the Ode of Resurrection, which can bring people back from the dead.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 14.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' With the support of six heroes from five hundred years ago, she united Natlan against a dangerous foe.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 15.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' Now, this story truly begins with the arrival of {{Traveler}} in Natlan...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 16a.ogg}} {{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 16b.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' ...Under {{MC|m=his|f=her}} guidance, Kachina performed exceptionally well in the Pilgrimage, and earned her chance at the Night Warden Wars...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 17.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' ...Suddenly, the sky turned dark, the Sacred Flame went out, and [[Gosoythoth]] appeared...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 18.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' ...Everyone gathered at the Stadium and sang the Ode of Resurrection together to send their support to the furthest corner of the Night Kingdom...
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 19.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' "{{Rubi|Tumaini|Hope}}" became known by all, and everyone began reciting the words that defined its message.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 20.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' "In the beginning, there was darkness."
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 21.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' "Until someone set themselves aflame."
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 22.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' "Only then did the universe know light."
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 23.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' Anyway, the dust has now settled, and Natlan has entered a new era of peace.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 24.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' {{Traveler}} fought for "life." The Captain fought for "death."
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 25.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' And our Archon, Mavuika, created a bridge between them.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 yata 02.ogg}} '''Yata:''' Wow!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 cucuya 02.ogg}} '''Cucuya:''' Is there more? Please don't let that be the end!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 sadigua 26.ogg}} '''Sadigua:''' Sounds like you like this one... Tell you what, give me some time, and I'll write it all out in even greater detail.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 matho 01.ogg}} '''Matho:''' I loved it! This is the best story ever!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 soncco 02.ogg}} '''Soncco:''' Yeah! And "{{Rubi|Tumaini|Hope}}" is the coolest ancient name! I get to be "Tumaini" today, okay guys?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 ayun 02.ogg}} '''Ayun:''' Hey, it's supposed to be my turn!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 cucuya 03.ogg}} '''Cucuya:''' No! It's my turn!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 yata 03.ogg}} '''Yata:''' No, it's MY turn! I get to be "{{Rubi|Tumaini|Hope}}" today!
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 matho 02.ogg}} '''Matho:''' So, no one wants to be the Pyro Archon anymore?
:;(Paimon and the Traveler walk out of the main entrance of the stadium.)
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, sounds fun. What do you say, {{Traveler}}? Wanna let Paimon be "{{Rubi|Tumaini|Hope}}" for the day?
:{{DIcon}} Sure! Then, I'll be Paimon.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 28 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alrighty then! Let's go, Paimon. A new adventure awaits!
:;(The pair walk off.)

:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 citlali 19.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' Legend remembers him as a wise ruler, one who left little behind.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 citlali 20.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' But, there is a place we could check &mdash; Ochkanatlan, the ruins we now refer to as "Cinder City."
:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 citlali 21.ogg}} '''Citlali:''' It was built on the site of a Dragon city and became known as the first city of the Pyro Archon. That's mostly likely where Xbalanque met the Ruler of Death.
:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you know where can find him? Or, um... his resting place?
:{{A|vo ntaq303 19 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, then to Och... ka... Cinder City it is! Yeah, Paimon's gonna stick with that name.

==Trivia==
* The phrase "And alien tears will fill for them, pity's long for their names" on the monument appears to be inspired by the epitaph on the {{w|Oscar Wilde's tomb|tomb of Oscar Wilde}} ("And alien tears will fill for him Pity's long-broken urn"), taken from his ''The Ballad of Reading Gaol''.
