|description    = An anemometer made from "[[Ashen Aratiku Wood]]" paired with a conical cloth bag, primarily used to help people monitor wind speed and direction in real time. It is a unique device of the [[Flower-Feather Clan]].<br>It is said that although this cloth-based anemometer is not as precise as propeller-style ones, its low cost and intuitive design make it a favorite. Even a Saurian rider flying high in the sky can judge the approximate wind speed and direction on the ground with a single glance, as if grasping the very tail of the mountain wind.
