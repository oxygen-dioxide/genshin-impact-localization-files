A silver mask inlaid with gold and gems and engraved with delicate patterns.<br />Delicately made, it showcases the elegance and customs of the old nobles.

The first nobles who rose up to rule Mondstadt began as heroes of humble origins.<br />These great chieftains and elegant princes as well as beautiful princesses and noblemen<br />once welcomed the people to their banquets and feasts.<br />In those days long past, the nobles shared their wisdom and elegance generously.

In that golden age, the nobles shared with the people their knowledge and profits.<br />But the later nobles were seduced by power. Their banquets were exclusively for their own pleasure.
