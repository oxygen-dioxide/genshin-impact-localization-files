{{Description|Flowers from vines that grow on cliff sides. It is called a lotus only because it has a similar appearance to one. Aside from that, it bears no other similar properties to the lotus.<br>Vines grow along cliffs everywhere in Sumeru, as timeless as time itself. It is said that these vines were the first thing that [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata|Lord Rukkhadevata]] ever created, making them the progenitors of every plant in Sumeru. All the great plants of the land, even the undying [[Divine Tree]], are connected at the roots through the entanglement of these vines. Of course, this saying has long been refuted by Amurta researchers, but still, it persists amongst the people.|[[Archive]]}}
