==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hongyu:''' Hey, it's a traveler. I'm free to chat if you want? While the sergeant's is not here.
:{{DIcon}} About Rex Lapis' death...
:;(After completing [[Rite of Descension]])
:::'''Hongyu:''' Whoa, come on now. When I said we could chat, I didn't mean sensitive topics like that. That's off limits.
:::'''Hongyu:''' Take it from me, no self-respecting Liyue local is gonna want to broach that topic lightly.
:::'''Hongyu:''' ...Ahem, I must stay at my post. If there's nothing else you need, please leave me be.
:;(After completing [[The Fond Farewell]])
:::'''Hongyu:''' I was there at the Rite of Descension too. The Qixing has told us to maintain absolute secrecy about the matter at the time.
:::'''Hongyu:''' But now that the Rite of Parting is finished, everyone is aware of the situation. There's no need for us Millelith to keep silent about it any longer...
:::'''Hongyu:''' But even so... I'm sorry, I still can't bring myself to discuss this topic any further.
:::'''Hongyu:''' Rex Lapis... *sigh*
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Hongyu:''' We're Millelith guards for this area. I'm Hongyu, and that's [[Kun]].
::'''Hongyu:''' Liyue Harbor's a pretty safe place. I've not seen any big trouble ever since I've been in uniform. Maybe you have a bit more pickpockets and petty thieves around Chihu Rock, but that's about it.
::'''Hongyu:''' Hey, have you heard about the [[Lantern Rite Festival|Lantern Rite]]?
::'''Hongyu:''' It's a festival people in Liyue celebrate. Takes place on the night of the first full moon every year. It's the biggest festival of the whole year, too.
::'''Hongyu:''' On the day of the festival, the whole city lights lanterns all night long. It makes the place as bright as day.
::'''Hongyu:''' Also, we have a special floating lantern too. Unique to Liyue. It's quite a sight to behold, and you won't find anything like it elsewhere.
::'''Hongyu:''' Anyway, just thought if you're new in town, it's something you definitely wouldn't want to miss!
:{{DIcon}} Anything interesting happening around here?
::'''Hongyu:''' No, I wouldn't say that anything interesting has happened. But I did encounter something weird recently...
::'''Hongyu:''' There was something quite not right about my house. If it wasn't a bowl or chopsticks moving all of a sudden, then it was a chair suddenly falling over.
::'''Hongyu:''' After talking this through with a friend, he introduced me to an exorcist named [[Chongyun]]. They say he's a specialist in these bump-in-the-night matters.
::'''Hongyu:''' But the instant that exorcist walked into the room, all the strange happenings stopped right away! He didn't even need to work any thaumaturgy!
::'''Hongyu:''' It truly is weird. I still have no idea how that might have happened...
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, I have things to do.
::'''Hongyu:''' *sigh* Okay then. Shame, don't get this sort of freedom very often.

==Event Dialogue==
===Fleeting Colors in Flight===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hongyu:''' I saw a [[Shenhe|white-haired lady]] around these parts a couple of days ago. She was incredibly beautiful &mdash; had an extraordinary air about her to boot.
:'''Hongyu:''' But just as I wanted to get a closer look, she suddenly disappeared...
:'''Hongyu:''' Actually, now that I think about it, did I encounter some passing adeptus?

===The Exquisite Night Chimes===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hongyu:''' Things feel more or less the same, year after year...
:'''Hongyu:''' Not that it's a bad thing. Though nothing particularly good happened, there was nothing bad either.
:'''Hongyu:''' I hope next year will go smoothly as usual.
;(Continue non-event dialogue options)
{{Dialogue End}}

===Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hongyu:''' New year, new horizons!
:'''Hongyu:''' I mean, look, the kites this year have mechanical devices on them. Next thing you know, we'll be mounting compasses on our Xiao Lanterns!
:'''Hongyu:''' That way, we can get them to send letters just like our pigeons.
:'''Hongyu:''' Hmm? You think I'm kidding? Well, maybe I am!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Springtime Charms===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hongyu:''' Hah, would you look at all this newness around us? So long as enough people participate in any activity, even those who weren't interested to start with will get sucked in, like moths to a flame.
:'''Hongyu:''' I mean, just look at the gift envelopes at the fair.
:'''Hongyu:''' In previous years, people would just buy them ready-made for exchange with family and friends, but now that there's a stand at which you can make 'em yourself, even those of us least fond of books are getting in on the action.
:'''Hongyu:''' Of course, watching them scratching their heads trying to figure out some nice words to pen down is pretty funny. But I reckon that you can write anything you want, as long as it comes from the heart.
