==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hitomi:''' To think that there were so many other preparation techniques for tea leaves apart from steaming! Tea ceremony, observed at its origin &mdash; profundity, such profundity...
:{{DIcon}} The land of origin?
::'''Hitomi:''' Are you interested in tea preparations too? Then allow me to briefly expound on my understanding...
::'''Hitomi:''' They say that [[Inazuma|Inazuman]] tea and tea ceremonies originate from Liyue, and so Liyue is considered the origin of such practices.
::'''Hitomi:''' Today, however, Inazuman and Liyue tea ceremonies have completely diverged.
::'''Hitomi:''' In Qiaoying Village, this novel roasted tea exudes a vibrant aroma.
::'''Hitomi:''' I think it can be considered the harmony of tea ceremonies.
::'''Hitomi:''' The blend of the same tea leaves with the tastes of new places eventually causes it to evolve into new forms.
::{{DIcon}} Good point.
::'''Hitomi:''' You're too kind. I'm merely expressing my feelings as one who adores tea ceremonies.
:{{DIcon}} Tea possesses an essence that cannot be changed.
::'''Hitomi:''' Hmm...
::'''Hitomi:''' Well, you're right. No matter how the ceremonies change, the feelings of the people who drink tea are always the same.
::'''Hitomi:''' These are what you mean by "the things that never change," yes?
::'''Hitomi:''' Ah, who knew tea encompassed such vast knowledge! I've learned so much!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Hitomi:''' See you! Let's have another discussion next time.
