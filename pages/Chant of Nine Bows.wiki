===Etymology===
* The {{w|Nine bows|Nine Bows}} is a symbol of the generic enemy in Ancient Egyptian art, standing in for myriad peoples antagonistic to Egypt throughout its history, and possibly for the general concept of disorder itself. As the number nine in Egyptian culture stood metaphorically for totality, and the hieroglyph for “bow” means “stretch” or “be wide”, the symbol may be interpreted as an expression of the perceived immensity of hostile lands and forces.
