==Refinement==
Refining '''Festering Desire''' requires [[Festering Dragon Marrow]] instead of an identical weapon. 4 marrows can be obtained through [[The Chalk Prince and the Dragon]]'s event shop.

==Description==
This was a story from long ago...

Unborn life, unfulfilled wishes,<br />
Tragic dreams at the edge of the universal darkness that could never come true,<br />
Indwell my body, and descend unto this world.

Then, my lovely children,<br />
Like rainwater flowing into creeks, and plants growing towards
the sun,<br />
Go unto a lovely place, and display your own beauty there with pride.

This is a memory, a memory that a child named [[Durin]] had of [[Rhinedottir|his mother]]...

"Thank you, Mother, thank you."<br />
"You gave me wings to soar and a mighty form."<br />
"Mother, I wish to go to a land of lovely songs,"<br />
"I will tell them about you, Mother, and about everyone else."<br />
"I shall tell them that the place where I was born is beautiful."

==Availability==
*Given during [[Festering Desire (Quest)|Festering Desire]] quest of [[The Chalk Prince and the Dragon]] event
**The refinement materials [[Festering Dragon Marrow]] were available from the event's shop.

==Trivia==
*This weapon's lore ties into the lore of [[Dragonspine Spear]] since both weapons are made from remains of the same dragon, [[Durin]].
*This sword was the main focus of the [[Event]] [[The Chalk Prince and the Dragon]]:
**According the [[Albedo]]'s dialogue in [[Festering Desire (Quest)|Festering Desire]], this sword was created by a smith that disappeared shortly after, and his creation got lost in time, eventually ending up in the [[Treasure Hoarders]]' possessions. When stolen goods were reclaimed from a group of Treasure Hoarders by the [[Knights of Favonius]], this sword was rediscovered.<br />As no one came to claim it, he investigated the sword and discovered its true origins: this sword's blade has been coated with a powder made of Durin's remains, notably his eyes, claws, and scales. This has caused to infuse the weapon with Durin's power but also its corruption, cursing the sword and making it unusable by "ordinary mortals", as the corruption might seep through the handle and infect the body of the wielder; Albedo goes as far as considering the sword as "a living being" and theorizing that this curse might be the reason behind its creator's mysterious fate.<br />The [[Traveler]] is unaffected by the curse as they have the ability to purify corrupted items, as demonstrated when they purified [[Teardrop Crystal|Dvalin's tears]], hence why Albedo entrusts the sword to them for experimentation.
***The sword eventually is cleaned of its corruption by the end of [[Raiders Amidst Snow Mist]] thanks to the Traveler purifying it over time, although some of its sheer power is lost when it is transferred by accident into the [[Resurgent Cryo Regisvine]] during [[Uninvited Guests]]. Albedo extracts the rest into a bottle during [[Afterword]], gifting the now safe sword to the Traveler as a memento of their research.
**During this event, the sword could grant various unlockable boosts when used in [[Dragonspine]] and also received a ×1.5 Refinement EXP boost.
