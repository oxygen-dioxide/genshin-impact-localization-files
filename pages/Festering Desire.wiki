==Description==
This was a story from long ago...

Unborn life, unfulfilled wishes,<br>
Tragic dreams at the edge of the universal darkness that could never come true,<br>
Indwell my body, and descend unto this world.

Then, my lovely children,<br>
Like rainwater flowing into creeks, and plants growing towards
the sun,<br>
Go unto a lovely place, and display your own beauty there with pride.

This is a memory, a memory that a child named [[Durin]] had of [[Rhinedottir|his mother]]...

"Thank you, Mother, thank you."<br>
"You gave me wings to soar and a mighty form."<br>
"Mother, I wish to go to a land of lovely songs,"<br>
"I will tell them about you, Mother, and about everyone else."<br>
"I shall tell them that the place where I was born is beautiful."

==Lore==
According to [[Albedo]] in the {{Quest|Festering Desire (Quest)}}, Festering Desire was a sword created by a blacksmith who disappeared shortly after its creation, with the weapon becoming lost to time and eventually ending up in the possession of [[Treasure Hoarders]]. When stolen goods were reclaimed from a group of Treasure Hoarders by the [[Knights of Favonius]], this sword was rediscovered.

As no one came to claim it, Albedo investigated this sword and discovered its true origins: the sword's blade had been coated with a powder made of [[Durin]]'s remains - notably his eyes, claws, and scales. This infused the weapon with Durin's power, but also its corruption, cursing the sword and making it unusable by "ordinary mortals," as the corruption might seep through the handle and infect the body of the wielder. Albedo goes as far as considering this sword a living being, and theorized that this curse might be the reason behind its creator's mysterious fate.

The [[Traveler]] is unaffected by the curse, as they have the ability to purify [[Abyssal Corruption|abyssal corruption]], as demonstrated when they purified [[Teardrop Crystal|Dvalin's tears]], hence why Albedo entrusts the sword to them for experimentation.

The sword is eventually cleansed of its corruption by the end of ''[[Raiders Amidst Snow Mist]]'' thanks to the Traveler purifying it over time, although some of its sheer power is lost when it is transferred by accident into the [[Resurgent Cryo Regisvine]] during ''[[Uninvited Guests]]''. Albedo extracts the rest into a bottle during ''[[Afterword (The Chalk Prince and the Dragon)|Afterword]]'', gifting the now safe sword to the Traveler as a memento of their research.

==Availability==
* Obtained during [[The Chalk Prince and the Dragon]] event.

==Trivia==
* This sword was the main focus of the story in the event ''[[The Chalk Prince and the Dragon]]''.
** During this event, this sword could grant various unlockable boosts when used in [[Dragonspine]].
* This weapon's lore ties into the lore of [[Dragonspine Spear]], since both weapons are made from the remains of [[Durin]].
* This sword's short description mirrors that of [[Cinnabar Spindle]], as both weapons are related in many ways.
