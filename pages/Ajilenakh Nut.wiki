==Descriptions==
{{Description|A fruit that grows on evergreen trees within desert oases. The flesh beneath the tough skin is thick, sweet, and delicious, making it an important food source amongst the desert peoples.<br />Their extremely high sugar content may be attributed to the special geographical conditions of the desert. They are delicious both on their own as dried fruit and as ingredients in various sweets. Ajilenakh Nuts are said to have a long history of cultivation. They are often mentioned in songs about the olden days. Legend has it that the candied Ajilenakh Nuts served as the first appetizer at the nightly banquets held by the [[Scarlet King|Lord of the Blazing Sun]].|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* {{Lang|fa= آجيلِ نخ|"Ajilenakh"}} is a corruption of {{Lang|fa=آجيلِ نخل |"ajilenakhl"}} which means "date palm nuts" in Persian.
