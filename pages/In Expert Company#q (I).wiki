{{Quest Description|In the Court of Fontaine, you meet a group of people from Liyue...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Ms. Qiu, Xingye, or Yifeng)
:'''Xingye:''' What're we gonna do now, Boss? The filming's not done and the Kamera's lost...
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Alright, stop sighing. Didn't we go post a commission at the Adventurers' Guild?
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' There's only one thing we got left to do today, and that's to wait...
:'''Yifeng:''' Yeah, but our half-finished film is still in the Kamera.
:'''Yifeng:''' Even though the machine's pretty hardy, if the film gets damaged...
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Then...
:{{DIcon}} What Film Kamera?
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Well, well! Didn't I say help was coming? As I said, all we had to do was wait!
:'''Yifeng:''' When did the Adventurers' Guild get this efficient?
:'''Xingye:''' Hmm, it seems like some Fontainians aren't that slow-going after all.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Hello there, adventurer. You must be here for the commission to help us get our Film Kamera back, right?
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' We were attacked by monsters over there, can you please hurry...
:{{DIcon}} I didn't accept any commission.
:{{DIcon}} I was just passing through.
:'''Xingye:''' Oh...
:'''Yifeng:''' Then...
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' That's fine! It's all fine. I knew the Adventurers' Guild wasn't reliable...
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Adventurer, would you like to accept an emergency commission? The pay's real good.
:{{DIcon}} That sounds fine...
:{{DIcon}} As long as the pay's good.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Great! Fantastic! I need you to go over and help us get our Film Kamera back! We'd be in your debt!

;(Talk to Xingye again, optional)
:'''Xingye:''' *sigh* When will I get to go back to [[Qiaoying Village]]...

;(Talk to Ms. Qiu again, optional)
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Please, adventurer, please go get us our Film Kamera back.

;(Talk to Yifeng again, optional)
:'''Yifeng:''' This shoot has been nothing but disasters...

;(After defeating monsters)
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Great! The Film Kamera is intact, and the film hasn't been destroyed...
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Thank the Archons. I thought we were gonna have to start shooting all over again.
:{{DIcon}} Why are you filming here?
:{{DIcon}} Seems you aren't from Fontaine either.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' It's a long story...
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Let's keep it brief. We three are from Qiaoying Village in Liyue.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Most people there are in the tea business but we... don't have any interest in tea...
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' So, we changed professions and started filming dokumentari films to help promote tea vendors in the village.
:'''Yifeng:''' In truth, there are too many people in the tea business, and we just couldn't compete.
:'''Xingye:''' The skilled helpers we had at the store left one by one to work elsewhere, so if we just stuck to making tea, we'd be starving.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Can't you two... not make things sound so depressing!?
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' We've made plenty of Mora shooting these tea dokumentaris in the village.
:'''Yifeng:''' But recently, some others in the village have also started to shoot their own promotional films.
:'''Xingye:''' Some of them are even performing an opera in them. They're making a real big show of it.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' So that's why we're in Fontaine. We're trying to seek advice from master filmmakers!
:{{DIcon}} So, you're here to learn about filmmaking in Fontaine?
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Yeah. We found this "lighting expert" called [[Geisert]].
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' He's real good at using lighting to film... what was it again?
:'''Yifeng:''' "Narratives."
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Yeah! Applying lighting to his "narratives."
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' With Mr. Geisert's advice, we can definitely shoot the best films in all of Qiaoying Village!
:'''Xingye:''' Boss, last month you said we were going to shoot the best films in Liyue.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' You have to adjust your expectations realistically when doing business... What do you know?
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Anyway, thanks for your help, Traveler. Here, take this Mora.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Xingye, Yifeng, pack that up quick! We gotta finish shooting our sample and show it to Mr. Geisert.
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' Watch the lighting! The Kamera's gotta be angled toward the light source in this way. We gotta capture that... high-definition lighting!
:'''Ms. Qiu:''' You all read that book, right? The lighting's gotta have a sense of texture? You get what I'm saying?
:'''Xingye:''' Boss, we might've read Mr. Geisert's book...
:'''Yifeng:''' But with what we got, we're not going to be able to capture that high-definition lighting tactility you want no matter how much we struggle...
