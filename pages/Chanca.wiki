==Profile==
<!-- Detailed story/lore information goes here. -->
Chanca is an {{Ancient Name|bearer=1}} [[Ancient Name]] bearer and was once a top-ranked warrior in the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]]. However, during her final battles in the [[Night Warden Wars]], her leg was seriously injured and that forced her into retirement. Her reputation was still quite memorable though. After she took over ownership of the Weary Inn many would visit to see her, though that apparently died down when it became known that she didn't like to make a fuss over her warrior days.<ref name="Tizoc">{{Ref/NPC|Tizoc}}</ref>
