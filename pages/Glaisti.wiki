==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Glaisti:''' My oh my, I really wonder what they like to eat. What shall I use as feed this time?
:'''Glaisti:''' Ah, hello! It's been a while. Would you like to have some tea?
:{{DIcon}} Feed?
::'''Glaisti:''' Ah, I see you heard me mumbling to myself...
::'''Glaisti:''' Actually, I've been trying to raise [[Breacher Primus]]es recently, so I've been making plans to get acquainted with them &mdash; on friendly terms, of course.
::{{DIcon}} You can raise such creatures?
:::'''Glaisti:''' Well, they are gentle and cute little things &mdash; isn't it just like how humans own pets?
:::'''Glaisti:''' Sometimes, I feel my spirits lifted just from watching them walk around.
::{{DIcon}} Do you need any help preparing any feed?
:::'''Glaisti:''' Thanks for the kind offer, but I haven't used up all the current feed I'm using. I'm just wondering what I should use next.
:::'''Glaisti:''' They might suffer from unbalanced nutrition if they always eat only one thing, so I need to switch recipes frequently...
:::'''Glaisti:''' By the way, what do you think would make the best feed? [[Tidalga]] membrane, [[Beryl Conch]] organs, or dried [[Lumitoile]] skin?
:::{{DIcon}} Are any of those nutritious in the first place...?
:::'''Glaisti:''' Uh, to be honest, I'm not sure either, but they might be nutritious to the Breacher Primuses, considering how happily they eat the stuff?
:::'''Glaisti:''' But if none of those options work, I might have to come up with something else...
:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to do right now...
::'''Glaisti:''' Well then, guess I won't keep you. But if you've got the time and mind to, just stop by for a cup of hot tea.
