==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Sanada:''' Ah, why am I the only one left here again... Hello, how can I help you?
:{{DIcon}} The only one left?
::'''Sanada:''' I have a comrade who was supposed to stand on guard with me, but he always abandons his post. If I don't pay special attention, he tends to just leave me on duty here alone.
::'''Sanada:''' I'm debating if I should report this to our superior...
::{{DIcon}} You should report him.
:::'''Sanada:''' If this gets out, everyone will think that I'm a snitch. What if they ostracize me from now on because of that?
:::'''Sanada:''' I don't want to have a bad reputation at the Police Station. It will affect my chances for a promotion...
::{{DIcon}} Best keep it to yourself...
:::'''Sanada:''' But what if there is trouble? How am I supposed to handle it myself?
:::'''Sanada:''' I have to patrol this whole area. This is too difficult. Ah, so annoying...
:{{DIcon}} Have you ever seen someone who looks like me?
::'''Sanada:''' I can't really say. There are way too many people coming in and out of [[Hanamizaka]]. And I'm usually the only one on duty. How can I possibly remember that?
::'''Sanada:''' Gee, can't people just do their job properly...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Sanada:''' Glory to the Shogun and her everlasting reign! Let me think...
