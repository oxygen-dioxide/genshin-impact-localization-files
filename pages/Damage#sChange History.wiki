[[File:elemental mastery bonus damage graph.png|thumb|right|400px|Elemental Mastery bonus damage (%) vs Elemental Mastery (EM)<br />'''[[Version 1.6]] buffed values shown in <font color=red>red</font>; [[Version 1.5]] in <font color=blue>blue</font>''' ]]
*Shields generated by [[Crystallize]], elemental reaction damage ([[Electro-Charged]], [[Superconduct]], [[Overloaded]], [[Swirl]], and [[Shatter]]), and the damage bonus for the same elemental reactions were buffed.
*The Elemental Mastery bonus was increased (relatively) by +75% at low levels increasing to +90% at high levels.<ref name=b16>HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/425806 <nowiki>[Analysis]</nowiki> Genshin Impact 1.6 Elemental Reaction Buff]</ref>
*The exact changes are not yet certain:
**According to one analysis base Elemental Reaction damage was reduced (by ~30%) below level 60, but above level 60 slightly increased, gaining up to ~ +15% by level 80, and +20% by level 90. Before and after buff base damage was roughly equal at level 60.<ref name=b16/>
**An alternative analysis gave no change below level 60 for base damage, but an increasing boost after - peaking at +20% at level 90.<ref name=cn16a>Chinese HoYoLAB: [https://bbs.mihoyo.com/ys/article/6685663 1.6版本剧变伤害基数、结晶盾量、精通都改了哪些]</ref>
**The new formula for Elemental Mastery bonus has been estimated as 16EM/(EM+2000). This gives an increase in bonus of 170% to 200% increasing with EM value.<ref name=cn16a/>
*The net effect of these changes is  minimal changes in damage at lower levels, but substantial increases in damage above level 60 - generally roughly up to doubled damage. (At level 90 between 1.4x and 2.2x damage, depending on EM.<ref name=cn16a/>)
*The damage absorption of [[crystallize]] generated [[shields]] has also been significantly increased.
**According to one analysis the increase in base shield absorption strength was steadily increased from around level 30, reaching around +30% over the shield strength in v1.5.<ref name=cn16a/>
*Elemental mastery bonus formula for transformative reactions was changed from the following:
**<math>\% \text{ EM Bonus}_\text{Transformative} = 6.66 \times \frac{\text{EM}}{\text{EM} + 1400} \times 100 \%</math>
