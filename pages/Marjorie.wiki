:'''Marjorie:''' Welcome. Every treasure here is unique, so we don't negotiate on the price, nor do we give refunds.
:{{DIcon}} Browse items. <small>''(Prior to unlocking shop)''</small><!--Exact condition?-->
::'''Marjorie:''' My, this is unfortunate. The shop's been undergoing renovations recently.
::'''Marjorie:''' Drop by next time. Our products will never disappoint!
:{{DIcon|Souvenir}} Browse items.
::'''Marjorie:''' Take a look around. Let me know if you're interested in any of these.

:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Marjorie:''' Well, it looks like you need more practice.
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Marjorie:''' Whoa. You're better than the regulars here...
:{{DIcon|Special Souvenir}} I'd like to get some special souvenirs, please.
::'''Marjorie:''' Well, then you've come to the right place. Have a look, see if anything takes your fancy!
:;(Opens Special Souvenir Shop)
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to ask about something.
::'''Marjorie:''' Oh? I see you're very interested.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about your wares.
:::'''Marjorie:''' Which one caught your eyes? Every item here is unique. Every purchase here is a bargain!
:::'''Marjorie:''' They were all purchased from the adventurers. Each of them represents the passion and courage of these adventurers&mdash;
:::'''Marjorie:''' So don't bother asking for a discount. You can never discount passion and courage!
::{{DIcon}} How did you come to own this shop?
:::'''Marjorie:''' Why did I open this shop, you ask? It's because of my [[Cyrus|dad]].
:::'''Marjorie:''' He's the Master of the [[Adventurers' Guild]], Mondstadt Branch. He always brings tons of treasures after each adventure.
:::'''Marjorie:''' He'll then tell me the story behind each of the treasures... He was my hero when I was little.
:::'''Marjorie:''' I wanted to share these stories with everyone, so I opened this shop&mdash;
:::'''Marjorie:''' But not long after opening, my dad became a bit more doddery and talks to himself all day...
::{{DIcon}} Did I hear you talk about [[Wolvendom]]?
:::'''Marjorie:''' Oh, yes. I did see something strange in Wolvendom not long ago.
:::'''Marjorie:''' From the silhouette, it seems to have been [[Razor|a boy]], but he was with a pack of wolves, and they seemed very close, too...
:::'''Marjorie:''' Perhaps I was mistaken. I was quite a distance away, after all, and it was only a glimpse.
:::'''Marjorie:''' I mean, how could humans live alongside wolves? How strange...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Marjorie:''' Oh! Don't forget to bring some goodies here next time!

==Event Dialogue==
===Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{DIcon|Music Score}} {{Color|help|We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.}}
::'''Marjorie:''' A music festival? Didn't we just hold the Windblume Festival?
::'''Paimon:''' This one's taking place in Inazuma, Marjorie, and it's a serious musical exchange! If you've got any tunes you like, we can play it for you right here and now.
::'''Marjorie:''' Hmm, let me think... Well, I don't remember this one's name, but could you play it if I were to just to hum the tune?
::{{DIcon}} Sure, I'll give it a go.
::'''Marjorie:''' Oh, that'd be grand!

;(After performing)
:'''Marjorie:''' This tune is so gentle, just the way I remember it.
:'''Marjorie:''' My dad used to play this one for me on his harmonica while we were on the way back from Springvale.
:'''Marjorie:''' He said that this tune represented Springvale itself, and that's where Dad's dad grew up.
:'''Marjorie:''' Shame that my grandfather would pass before I was ever born.
:'''Marjorie:''' Thanks for playing that music. You know what? I've decided that I should spend a bit more time with my dad. He's an adventurer, so he tends to spend time out in the field.
:'''Marjorie:''' So, if you don't mind, I might have to give this festival a pass, but if there's another opportunity, I'll come &mdash; and drag him along as well!

;(Talk to Marjorie again, optional)
:{{DIcon|Music Score}} How was that?
:;(Same as ''After performing'')

===Windblume's Breath===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Marjorie:''' "A flower that is not of this world"... Could that be referring to the real Windblume?
:'''Marjorie:''' Ah, I'm sorry, I was preoccupied with thinking about something.
:'''Marjorie:''' [[Collei|An adorable child]] bought a storybook from me, but I remember there being a rather strange riddle within its pages.
:'''Marjorie:''' It might've been something that someone just accidentally left behind. You don't need to pay any special heed to it.
