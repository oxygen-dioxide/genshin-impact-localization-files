:{{DIcon|Special Souvenir}} I'd like to get some special souvenirs, please.
::'''Marjorie:''' Well, then you've come to the right place. Have a look, see if anything takes your fancy!
:;(Opens Special Souvenir Shop)
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to ask about something.

::{{DIcon}} How did you come to own this shop?
:::'''Marjorie:''' Why did I open this shop, you ask? It's because of my [[Cyrus|dad]].
:::'''Marjorie:''' He's the Master of the [[Adventurers' Guild]], Mondstadt Branch. He always brings tons of treasures after each adventure.

:::'''Marjorie:''' Oh, yes. I did see something strange in Wolvendom not long ago.
:::'''Marjorie:''' From the silhouette, it seems to have been [[Razor|a boy]], but he was with a pack of wolves, and they seemed very close, too...
:::'''Marjorie:''' Perhaps I was mistaken. I was quite a distance away, after all, and it was only a glimpse.
:::'''Marjorie:''' I mean, how could humans live alongside wolves? How strange...

::'''Marjorie:''' Oh! Don't forget to bring some goodies here next time!
