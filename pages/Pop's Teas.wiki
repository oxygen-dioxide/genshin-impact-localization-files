{{Lang|'''Pop's Teas'''|zh=大碗茶|zh_rm=Dàwǎn-chá|zh_tl=Dawan Cha|zh_lit=Big Bowl Tea}} is a [[food]] item that the player can purchase from [[Pops Kai]] (located in Qingce Village, Liyue), [[Pops Zhou]] (located in Stone Gate, Liyue), or [[Mr. Zhu]] for 1,000 [[Mora]] (max 10 per day).

Pop's Teas restores '''14'''% of Max HP to the selected character and regenerates '''350''' HP every 5 seconds for 30 seconds for the selected character. Like most foods, this can not target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]].

==Trivia==
*The following birthday mails included Pop's Teas:
**[[Birthday/Yun Jin#Would You Like a Midnight Snack?|Yun Jin's 2022 Birthday Mail]] (2 Pop's Teas)
*This dish refers to ''dawan cha'', literally meaning "big bowl tea," a type of tea sold by a Chinese tea stall that is cheap and simple, but convenient for a break.<ref name="dawancha">China Daily: [https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2012-09/09/content_15745464.htm Tea traditions spring back in East China]</ref>
*The English translation "Pop's Teas" perhaps comes from the fact it is sold by Pops Kai and Pops Zhou.
