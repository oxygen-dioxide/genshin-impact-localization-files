==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Millereau:''' Hmm? Are you interested in the Mutual Aid Network? I'd be happy to tell you more about it, if you'd like.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Millereau:''' As you can see, I'm spreading the word about the Mutual Aid Network's philosophy in the hopes of getting more people to join us.
::{{DIcon}} It doesn't look like anyone wants to come learn.
:::'''Millereau:''' I'm surprised you saw our dilemma so quickly...
:::'''Millereau:''' It's true &mdash; the Mutual Aid Network is a small group. Few people are interested in us, let alone want to join us.
:::'''Millereau:''' But I still believe that my work is meaningful.
:::'''Millereau:''' When I first arrived in the Fortress of Meropide, I was completely lost. I passed each day in a daze, not daring to think about anything to do with the future.
:::'''Millereau:''' It was only after I joined the Mutual Aid Network that I gradually began to realize that in this world, there are many "things that I can still do."
:::'''Millereau:''' Even if it's just a few, insignificant little things, I can still get a sense of fulfillment from doing them...
:::'''Millereau:''' I hope I can introduce this mindset to more people. I want to help others completely transform themselves, and once more stand upright beneath the light.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Millereau:''' Ah... See you. If you need any help, you know where to find me.
