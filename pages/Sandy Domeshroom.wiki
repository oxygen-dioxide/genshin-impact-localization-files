|description    = These mushrooms have very thick caps that resemble the curved domes of some houses, which gives them their name. Their "sandy-brown" color is exceedingly eye-catching, which makes them an easy target for various animals visually. However, they have much harder caps to avoid being easy pickings &mdash; which, by the way, could really allow them to form a sturdy roof "dome" of sorts.
