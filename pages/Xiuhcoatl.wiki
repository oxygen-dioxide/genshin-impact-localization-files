'''Xiuhcoatl''', also known as the '''Flamelord''',<ref name="Manqu">{{Ref/NPC|Manqu}}</ref> was the {{Pyro}} [[Dragon]] and one of the ancient [[Seven Sovereigns]]<ref name="MOA">{{Ref/Quest|Moment of Awakening}}</ref> who ruled over [[Natlan]] in the distant past. He was the creator of the Huitzilopochtli and the Tzitzimimeh.<ref name="OAFE" />

==Profile==
Xiuhcoatl was a Dragon King who once ruled Natlan. As the Pyro Dragon, he wielded the powers of light, heat, and wisdom.<ref name="TRA">{{Ref/Quest|The Road Ahead}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Item|Natlan: Fiery Dragon|note = Description}}</ref> According to legend, he transformed one of his eyes into a "conduit of supreme authority by which all flames might be governed."<ref name="golden">{{Ref/Item|Golden Entreaty (Moment of Awakening)|note = Description}}</ref>

===Appearance===
As seen through Gosoythoth's transformation, Xiuhcoatl was a colossal serpent shaped dragon with giant eight wings with fiery ends, and two arms with sharp claws, his face have reptilian fearures, specially his jaw, and he has a pair of sharp horns, two pair of scales around his head, and a long pair of antennae. Parts of his body were black, likely due to [[Abyss]]al corruption. He is also historically depicted as a red dragon with golden accents on his wings.

==Story==
On the day that he was born he gave life to his younger brother, [[Kukulkan]].<ref name="OAFE">{{Ref/Quest|An Omen of Annihilation and the Final Entreaty}}</ref>

When the [[Heavenly Principles]] came to [[Teyvat]] and took over the world from the Seven Sovereigns, the Heavenly Principles froze Xiuhcoatl in lava, causing Xiuhcoatl to fall into a false death as the Heavenly Principles established its rule.<ref name="OAFE" /> Some time later, after Dragon King [[Nibelung]] returned to [[Teyvat]] during the dragons' war of vengeance,<ref name="OAFE"/> Xiuhcoatl and his allies would "awaken" and topple the civilizations established by the [[Angel]]s, regaining control over Natlan and causing humanity to regress into savagery.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Blazing Sacrificial Heart's Hesitance}}</ref> Eventually, Xiuhcoatl was corrupted by the Abyss and became a corpse-like shadow of his former self.<ref name="MOA" /><ref>{{Ref/Arti|Reckoning of the Xenogenic}}</ref> 

Thousands of years later, [[Xbalanque]], who had not yet become [[Pyro Archon]] at the time, fought him at the [[Great Volcano of Tollan]].<ref name="TRA" /> Xbalanque pierced the weak spots of the dragon's eyes, one of which was split in two and left behind [[Golden Entreaty|two white disc-shaped fragments]].<ref name="golden" /> Both Xbalanque and Xiuhcoatl fell from a great height during the battle. While Xiuhcoatl died, Xbalanque was wreathed in fire and revived.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Revelations from the Past}}</ref><ref name="MOA" />

According to his [[Kukulkan|younger brother]], Xiuhcoatl was only defeated because he created the [[Huitzilopochtli]] array by modifying one of his eyes to serve as its control hub. The Huitzilopochtli was a device that could convert all of Natlan into solely primal flame, or Phlogiston. It appears that he had intended to use it to protect Teyvat from the Abyss, but activating it would have destroyed the entire nation. However,  no Dragonborn could openly defy his orders, so Kukulkan sought another way to prevent its activation.<ref name="OAFE" />

===Legacy===
Some people believe that Xiuhcoatl still resides in the volcano, deep in hibernation, while others believe it is only a husk whose insides were incinerated by Xbalanque's flames.<ref name="TRA" />

Certain [[Saurian]]s in Natlan are born with a mark called the Flamelord's Blessing, a mark related to Xiuhcoatl that grants them the power of ancient dragons. However, it is far greater than what modern Saurians can bear; the [[Wayob]] and the [[Night Kingdom]] also reject this power and thus refuse to accept these Saurians. As they grow, the power will become more uncontrollable and tear at their bodies, eventually killing them or driving them insane. According to legend, the mark can be removed by bringing two tokens &mdash; the Golden Entreaties &mdash; to the volcano and performing a baptism on the affected Saurian, washing their name as remembered by Xiuhcoatl. However, not a single tribal warrior has succeeded, and the tribes gradually abandoned this custom and simply take care of the affected Saurians until they die.<ref name="Manqu" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Rite of the Bold}}</ref>

According to [[Mposo]], the Flamelord's Blessing usually appears once every dozen or several dozen years, and some Saurians enter the volcano themselves without a human companion. These Saurians are never heard from again, and because those who attempted it never succeeded, the tribes either take care of them until they die, "conceal" them (implied to be killing them) or grow so violent that saurian-hunters kill them. He also states that the mark appears more frequently when the threat of the [[Abyss]] looms nearby.

Other than [[Little One]], [[Holawaqa Ngoubou]] is a [[Qucusaurus]] known to bear the Flamelord's Blessing. His companion [[Menilek]], who was a member of [[Tenoch]]'s alliance 500 years ago,<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Talking Stick}}</ref> made the pilgrimage to the volcano to save him from the growing insanity. However, the journey ended in failure and only Ngoubou remains to this day with the title of "Tyrant."<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Holawaqa Ngoubou}}</ref>

During the battle against the Abyss, [[Gosoythoth]] extracted the memories of Xiuhcoatl from the Ley Lines and incarnated as him, transforming into the [[Lord of Eroded Primal Fire]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Where All Hopes Lie}}</ref><ref name="Weekly boss" />
