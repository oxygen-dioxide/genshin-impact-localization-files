{{Description|Donning the Mask of the Yaksha, Xiao takes the terrifying, demon-conquering form of the Vigilant Yaksha. But this great power has also brought him great suffering. Some call him "The Bane of All Evil."}}

==Gameplay Notes==
*While donning the Yaksha Mask, Xiao's [[Interruption Resistance]] is increased.

==Trivia==
*Bane of All Evil is the first Elemental Burst released with a 70 Energy Cost (see [[Elemental Burst#Comparison]] for a table).
*Currently, Bane of All Evil is the only ability in the game that increases the character's jump height, giving Xiao the highest vertical mobility.
*The Chinese name for this talent is {{Lang|mini=1|zh=靖妖傩舞}}, which more directly translates to "Nuo Dance of Evil Conquering." This refers to how Xiao's [[yaksha]] mask is based on the masks worn in {{w|Nuo opera}}.
**Its English translation, "Bane of All Evil," derives from Xiao's [[Xiao/Lore#Character Story 1|first Character Story]], in which {{Lang|mini=1|zh=靖妖傩舞}} is used as a title used to describe Xiao's experience in slaying demons. Meanwhile, Xiao's English [[Xiao/Lore#Vision|Vision story]] translates {{Lang|mini=1|zh=靖妖傩舞}} as "Nuo Dance of Evil Conquering," in reference to the technique used for slaying demons.
