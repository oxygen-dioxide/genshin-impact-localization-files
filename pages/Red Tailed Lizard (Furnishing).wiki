|description    = A small lizard with horns on its head that can often be found in shadowy bushes.<br>These lizards have lovely red, patterned tails that blend in with their surroundings. They discard these tails in moments of peril to confuse their foes.<br>Lizard tails have special medicinal properties when dried and ground down into a powder. Some crazy alchemists have even found a way to process them into catalysts for explosions.<br>Once they are separated from the body, these tails will lose their vitality and curl up.<br>Unlike those Green Horned Lizards that are terrified of birds, Red Tailed Lizards never avoid the two teapot spirits. Sometimes, [[Chubby]] even allows them to climb into his feathers because "the horns on their heads do wonders for my itchy skin."
