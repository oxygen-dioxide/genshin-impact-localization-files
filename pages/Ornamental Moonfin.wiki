|description    = A valuable Ornamental Fish that may be kept as a pet in the [[Pool of Sapphire Grace]].<br />A rare butterflyfish that emits light admits the pitch-dark ocean. They love to swim in schools, and when gathered together, they firm the image of a moon that has fallen into the sea, which is the origin of the "Lunar Leviathan" legend. This characteristic once attracted a great number of light-seeking creatures, and in some sense, also guided people who had descended into the darkness.
