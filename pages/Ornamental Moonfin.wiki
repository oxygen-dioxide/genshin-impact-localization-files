|description    = A valuable Ornamental Fish that may be kept as a pet in the [[Pool of Sapphire Grace]] and [[Shaded Clarity]].<br>A rare butterflyfish that emits light amidst the pitch-dark ocean. They love to swim in schools, and when gathered together, they form the image of a moon that has fallen into the sea, which is the origin of the "Lunar Leviathan" legend. This characteristic once attracted a great number of light-seeking sea creatures, and in some sense, also guided people who had descended into darkness.
