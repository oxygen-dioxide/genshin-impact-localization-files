'''Taika''' is a historical character from the [[Flower-Feather Clan]] in [[Natlan]].

In his time, he was known as the mightiest warrior of the Flower-Feather Clan.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Demon-Warrior's Feather Mask}}</ref> After the [[Cataclysm]] struck, he led the [[Ochkanatlan Adventure Team]]'s quest to reach the [[Tonatiuh]], leaving his wife and [[Bona|unborn child]] behind to do so.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Moment of Awakening}}</ref> He, like most of his teammates, ultimately perished at the hand of [[Waxaklahun Ubah Kan]]. His journey later inspired Bona to follow in his footsteps, chasing the treasure of the Tonatiuh.
