'''Harmonious Symphony Prelude''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Fragment of Harmonic Whimsy]].

==Description==
It was the age when the fog of ignorance enveloped the High Sea, and the people of Many Waters were yet unenlightened.<br><!--
-->Between the scarlet sands and the murky mountains, there was once a [[Remus|god]] who had lost his homeland.<br><!--
-->He was once a singer of the oases, but his ancient home had been lost beneath the awesome light of the [[King Deshret|Lord of the Blazing Sun]].<br><!--
-->Unwilling to serve the Sand King's throne, the god who had lost his homeland chose the path of wandering.<br><br><!--
-->Below the lightless abyssal depths, where the [[Fontaine|source of all waters]] lies, is a city that no history has ever chronicled.<br><!--
-->This homeless one who had intended to make the [[Source of All Waters: The Great Fontaine Lake|High Sea]] their grave accidentally intruded upon the ruins of this city older than the land itself.<br><!--
-->Passing through endless corridors to the heart of the ruined temple, beneath the [[Irminsul|silver-white cedar]],<br><!--
-->He heard the whispers of the only living creatures left in that forgotten city, the golden bees circling the silver tree:<br><br><!--
-->"O Traveler from afar, this is no happenstance, but the hand of fate that has brought you here."<br><!--
-->"I was once the [[Angel|envoy]] that protected the silver tree, but over the long ages, I have lost my mind and form."<br><!--
-->"Yet my eyes can still behold the future. O Traveler, you will once more have cities and subjects."<br><!--
-->"The [[Remuria|nation]] you build will flourish and prosper, and you shall one day rule the entire High Sea."<br><!--
-->"You will bring to them civilization and justice, but in the end, that very justice shall be their downfall."<br><!--
-->"Should you still be willing to set out on that journey despite knowing its ending, I will show you the way up..."<br><br><!--
-->"O Golden Bees who speak prophecy, is there even room for choice in [[Heavenly Principles|fate]]'s decree?"<br><!--
-->"If I truly did have a chance to choose, then I would be able to change the unchangeable end of which you spoke."<br><br><!--
-->As his words fell, the waterless hollow crumbled with a crash, the silver tree turning into a golden [[Fortuna|ship]].<br><!--
-->This was the first encounter between the glorious king who would later play the symphony, and the prophet [[Sybilla]].
