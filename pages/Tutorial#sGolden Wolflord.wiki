|text1    = The king of the Riftwolves. The Golden Wolflord's attacks can apply stacks of "Corrosion" status, which will cause all characters in the party to continuously lose HP. In combat, the Wolflord will summon Rifthound Skulls to provide it with shields. It can also enter the Elemental Devourer state, which will decrease its Geo RES and increase its offensive capabilities. Attack the Rifthound Skulls with {{Color|Geo DMG}} to destroy the Golden Wolflord's shields swiftly.
