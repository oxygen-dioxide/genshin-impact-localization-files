{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Loafer:''' Oho! Two special guests! Is there anything I can do for you? I'm Loafer, and I specialize in the lowest-effort solutions...
:{{DIcon}} Are you... especially fond of loafing around?
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, Paimon would like to know too!
::'''Paimon:''' Did you get that name because you never do any work?
::'''Loafer:''' Heh! It's not like that! Whether it's controlling the play's progress or making the necessary props and scene elements, I've always completed my work on time!
::'''Loafer:''' Loafing is a state of mind. It strives to achieve the most with the least effort.
::'''Loafer:''' For example, instead of making something three-dimensional, only the front and back of a scene element is prepared. So, uh... In the words of Chief Director, it saves us a lot of time!
::'''Paimon:''' ?
::{{DIcon}} ?
::'''Paimon:''' Doesn't that mean it has no sides?
::'''Loafer:''' Isn't tricking the audience's eyes all we need to do?
::'''Loafer:''' For example, slowing down the Choo-Choo Cart right in front of a scene element, and then shooting off right when it's about to move past it.
::'''Loafer:''' Doing that will keep most of the audience's focus on the front of the scene element! Think about, didn't you do the same with the sea monster's minions?
::'''Loafer:''' Otherwise, our troupe wouldn't have time to complete the more important scenes.
::'''Loafer:''' Instead of wasting time focusing on the "sides of the sea monster's minions," the completeness of the entire experience is definitely more important.
::'''Paimon:''' That does make sense...
::'''Paimon:''' From what you said... calling you "Loafer" is a kind of compliment?
::{{DIcon}} That kinda makes sense.
::{{DIcon}} But it also sounds like a load of baloney.
::'''Loafer:''' Free your minds, honored guests!
::'''Loafer:''' If you are like that fool Zosimos and fail to understand the importance of saving time and effort where you can, you shouldn't bother with working at all!
::'''Loafer:''' After all, if you seek perfection in every detail, the work will be endless! If you allow insignificant details to affect the main performance, you'll be killing the goose that lays the golden egg!
::'''Loafer:''' Of course, all of this is based on the premise that there is a serious shortage of personnel.
::'''Loafer:''' If we were to continue using such methods with sufficient staffing, then instead of loafing, we would just be good for nothing trash!
::'''Loafer:''' At times like that, we should make fundamentals beyond reproach, then strive for perfection in every detail while still utilizing this philosophy to make the whole show even more impeccable.
::'''Paimon:''' You've almost convinced Paimon! Paimon'll definitely give it some more thought.
:{{DIcon}} Then we'll leave you to your loafing.
::'''Loafer:''' Thank you so much! Your wisdom lights up my day! Come again when you're free!
