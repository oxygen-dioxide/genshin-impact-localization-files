'''''"Polychrome Tri-Stars"''''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Duelist: Series I]]''. To complete this achievement, the player needs to defeat the [[Local Legend|Local Legends]] {{Enemy|Fatui Skirmisher - Pyroslinger Bracer|text=Polychrome Tri-Stars: Vasily}}, {{Enemy|Fatui Skirmisher - Cryogunner Legionnaire|text=Polychrome Tri-Stars: Sidorenko}}, and {{Enemy|Fatui Skirmisher - Electrohammer Vanguard|text=Polychrome Tri-Stars: Nomokonov}} within 10 seconds of each other.

An ideal tactic for this achievement is to bring a {{Cryo}}, {{Pyro}}, {{Hydro}} and {{Anemo}} character, or a mix that contains at least three of these elements while grouping the Polychrome Tri-Stars together. This will require some effort in order to get Sidorenko closer while staying close to Vasily. [[Swirl]] reactions will pick up Pyro and spread it onto Sidorenko, Hydro eliminates Vasily's shield and Cryo against Nomokonov's, though uneven DPS will likely result in Sidorenko generally having more HP than the other two Tri-Stars. Try to reduce the Tri-Stars' HP to ~5% and account for incoming shields. The order in which the Tri-Stars are killed will generally not matter, since they would be all at low HP to begin with.
