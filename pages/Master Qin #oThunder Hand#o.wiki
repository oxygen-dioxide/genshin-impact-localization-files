{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Before completing Transient Dreams)
:'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' Hey, pal, do you know the way to [[Narukami Island]]?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' Everyone calls me Master Qin. You can go with that name.
::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' I'm a martial artist from Liyue hired by the Communications Office. Right now, I'm working as a bodyguard for a merchant called Li Xiao.
::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' I had wanted to visit Inazuma before. That's why I took this job.
::{{DIcon}} You want to go to [[Narukami Island]]?
:::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' Yeah, staying in Ritou is so boring.
:::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' And I have already escorted my employer to Inazuma safely. The job is considered done anyway. Isn't it up to me, then, where I want to go next?
:::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' It's such a rare opportunity. I even passed through that stormy ocean. Why shouldn't I go see the world a bit more?
:::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' Since I am here, I have to figure out what it's like to live in Inazuma, haha!
:::{{DIcon}} Why did you come to Inazuma?
::::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' Hmm, I heard that the locals excel in swordsmanship, and I wanted to see it for myself.
::::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' I'm not boasting. I've already defeated half of the fighters in Liyue with my unique technique, Rumbling Hand. No one's been a match for me yet!
::::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' I have not only won the title of Crux Clash Champion, but also clocked the teeth off some of those so-called ace fighters who possess Visions...
::::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' Going undefeated all these years is just too boring! Hmph, so I just want to see the world, challenge fighters everywhere, and learn about foreign cultures.
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} That sounds very adventurous!
::::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' Haha, so you are a member of the [[Adventurers' Guild]]?
::::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' Hmm, not bad! Now that I've been praised by an adventurer, I'll have to try even harder.
::::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' These are the experiences that I've accumulated in my previous adventures. I'll share them with you.
::::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' If you learn anything new, please tell me!
:::;(Obtain {{Item|Hero's Wit|20|x=2}})
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' If you find a way to get to Narukami Island, don't forget to tell me! I will treat you to Inazuman matcha!

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After completing Transient Dreams)
:'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' Why hello there, friend! You look like someone who has a few tricks up their sleeve. How about a few go-arounds with me in the ring?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' Everyone calls me Master Qin. You can go with that name.
::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' I'm a martial artist hired by the Communications Office. Right now, I'm working as a bodyguard for a merchant called Li Xiao.
:{{DIcon}} "Go-arounds"?
::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' Why, of course! Not to boast or anything, but I've already defeated half of the fighters in Liyue with my unique technique, Rumbling Hand. No one's been a match for me yet!
::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' I have not only won the title of Crux Clash Champion, but also clocked the teeth off some of those so-called ace fighters who possess Visions...
::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' I traveled through Inazuma previously. Not a single fighter of note to be found, I tell you! Disappointing, is what it was!
::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' That's why I've returned to Liyue recently. I mean, who knows, maybe some new talent has arisen while {{sic|I away}} that might be worth a bout or two.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} That sounds very adventurous!
::;(If Hero's Wit is not yet obtained)
:::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' Haha, so you are a member of the Adventurers' Guild?
:::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' Hmm, not bad! Now that I've been praised by an adventurer, I'll have to try even harder.
:::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' These are the experiences that I've accumulated in my previous adventures. I'll share them with you.
:::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' If you learn anything new, please tell me!
::;(Obtain {{Item|Hero's Wit|20|x=2}})
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Master Qin "Thunder Hand":''' Aye. If you ever want to have a match, I'm ready anytime!
