{{Description|A timepiece once used by a knight. The liquid inside has dried up, rendering it useless.}}
'''Bloodstained Final Hour''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Bloodstained Chivalry]].

==Description==
Deep in the abyss, where celestial bodies cast no light,<br />the Bloodstained Knight kept this timepiece, though time had lost all meaning.

At an end was the Bloodstained Knight's story,<br />for he realized there was no place for him on this earth.<br />He ventured into the fallen [[Khaenri'ah|ancient kingdom]], and died in battle in the monsters' lair.<br />At the bottom of the world, he learned the origin of the monsters that destroyed the ancient kingdom.

"The ancient kingdom was wrongfully cursed,"<br />"Turning its inhabitants into monsters."<br />"The code of chivalry tolerates not such injustice."<br />"If Abyss be thy name, I pledge to you my loyalty."
