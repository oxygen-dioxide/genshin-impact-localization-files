==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Mochizuki:''' Are researchers all this careless nowadays...
:{{DIcon}} You seem upset.
::'''Mochizuki:''' Yes, and you want to know why? It's because there's [[Kaushik|this researcher]] from [[Sumeru]] running around spreading false histories!
::'''Mochizuki:''' I don't know what school of reasoning he's from, but whatever it is, he's just spinning out fantasies and distortions!
::'''Mochizuki:''' He doesn't seem all that fond of verifying anything, but oh, he's very fascinated with non-existent hypotheses and stories, that's for sure! He's giving me a real headache...
::'''Mochizuki:''' I only hope that people aren't taken in by his words and forget [[Sangonomiya Shrine]]'s real history...
::{{DIcon}} So, what's this true history that you speak of all about?
::'''Mochizuki:''' The truth is that [[Mouun Shrine|the very first shrine]] on [[Watatsumi Island]] is not here at Sangonomiya Shrine. It's actually to the west of the island, where the [[Statue of The Seven]] is now.
::'''Mochizuki:''' After [[Watatsumi Omikami]] was slain by the [[Electro Archon]], Sangonomiya Shrine became our sanctuary where we worship Watatsumi Omikami.
::'''Mochizuki:''' A long time ago, when our ancestors were still suffering deep beneath the waves, it was Watatsumi Omikami who defeated the [[Dragonheir of the Depths]] and brought them to the surface where the sun shone...
::'''Mochizuki:''' The great coral above Sangonomiya Shrine was a gift given by Watatsumi Omikami from its own body, and thus did it gain its name.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I believe you.
:::'''Mochizuki:''' Hah... That's good.
:::'''Mochizuki:''' I remember Her Excellency saying that human wisdom is like a pearl, and that its shine will withstand the test of time.
:::'''Mochizuki:''' You know what? Take this with you.
::;(Obtain [[Sango Pearl]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Mochizuki:''' See you. I just hope people don't misunderstand...
