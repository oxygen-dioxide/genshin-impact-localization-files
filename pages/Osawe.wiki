<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
Osawe and [[Iyoba]] were attempting to evacuate to the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]] when they were attacked by Abyssal monsters. A group of [[Fatui]] who had been nearby protected them alongside several Natlanese warriors, and they were making progress until a black fire shot out into the sky. This resulted in numerous monsters overwhelming the group, and a Fatuus sacrificed himself to conceal the two from [[riftwolf|riftwolves]].

During [[Despair Engulfs the Heavens]], if the [[Traveler]] reinforced hotspot "Survivor Search and Rescue: North" before "Survivor Search and Rescue: South", they could discover Osawe and Iyoba hiding behind a Fatuus corpse. Iyoba thanked them for rescuing the two, and the Traveler offered to bring them to the stadium. Before they left, they paid their respects to the Fatuus for his sacrifice. If the [[Traveler]] did not reinforce hotspot "Survivor Search and Rescue: North" before "Survivor Search and Rescue: South", by the time they arrived, Osawe and Iyoba would be presumed dead.
