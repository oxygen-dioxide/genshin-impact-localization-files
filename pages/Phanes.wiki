==Profile==
{{Quote|The Primordial One may have been Phanes. It had wings and a crown, and was birthed from an egg, androgynous in nature. But for the world to be created, the egg's shell had to be broken. However, Phanes, the Primordial One, used the eggshell to separate the "universe" and the "microcosm of the world."|A scribe of Istaroth|[[Before Sun and Moon]]: On Phanes, or the Primordial One}}<!--
===Personality===-->
===Appearance===
According to [[Enkanomiya]] legend, Phanes was an androgynous entity with wings and a crown.

==Story==
Extremely little is known about Phanes beyond its potential identity as the Primordial One. However, the scribe of [[Istaroth]] who proposes this theory is uncertain of this claim themselves and does not refer to Phanes directly outside of the section "On Phanes, or the Primordial One."<ref name="Before Sun and Moon" />

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* In the Orphic tradition of Greek mythology, {{w|Phanes}} is the primeval god of creation and new life. According to legend, Phanes was an androgynous god who emerged from a {{w|World egg|cosmic egg}} created by {{w|Chronos}}, intertwined with a serpent. As a god of light, he was the creator of daytime and linked with {{w|Nyx}}, the goddess of night who created nighttime. Phanes was also said to be a dying and resurrecting god, killed by the Titans who devoured his flesh but rescued by Athena and resurrected by Zeus.
