|text    = I was all-prepared to hop into the kitchen, but my [[Chef Mao|dad]] told me that I couldn't help out at the [[Wanmin Restaurant|restaurant]] on my birthday, and instead I should go hang out with friends...

Oh, what have you been up to these days?

Picking [[Matsutake]]!? Gathering [[Bird Egg]]s!? Catching [[Slimes]]!? ...Wait, that's what I usually do. Hmm... You've been... looking for chests?

Whatever! Let's go have some food.

There's nothing more enjoyable than cooking a tasty meal for friends!

I'll make you some of Wanmin Restaurant's authentic [[Wanmin Restaurant's Boiled Fish|Boiled Fish]]! And then, you can tell me what you think of the flavor!
