'''Donna''' is an open-world [[NPC]] in the [[City of Mondstadt]]. She can be found near the city's front gates, present for her work at [[Floral Whisper]].

After completing the {{Quest|Flighty Flora... and Flora}}, some flowers will be put on display at Floral Whisper. However, trying to touch them will only get you admonished by Donna at night, when [[Flora]] is not there.
