'''Donna''' is an [[NPC]] in the [[City of Mondstadt]]. She can be found near the city's front gates, present for her work at [[Floral Whisper]].

She has a huge crush on [[Diluc]] and constantly fantasizes about him. She is also interested in the Darknight Hero after being saved by him, and is conflicted by her feelings towards both people (Donna is unaware of the Darknight Hero's identity).

After completing the World Quest "[[Flighty Flora... and Flora]]," some flowers will be put on display at Floral Whisper. However, trying to touch them will only get you admonished by Donna at night, when [[Flora]] is not there.

==Profile==
<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->===Personality===
All Donna can think about is Diluc. Consequentially, speaking to her during the Stormterror attack and during Dill's Story Quest always results in her talking about Diluc one way or the other — often on accident as Donna will unintentionally let her thoughts about Diluc slip to the Traveler.

Additionally, Donna takes her position at Floral Whisper seriously as she will always call out the Traveler for trying to touch the flowers Flora put out.

===Appearance===
Donna has blue eyes and brown hair in low twin tails. On her neck is a teal collar with a gold gemstone. She wears a white top with short sleeves rolled up to reveal teal and gold cuffs, as well as a brown corset with two buckles around her waist. On each wrist is a teal bracelet.

On her lower half is a teal dress with muted gold accents. Donna wears grey leggings and teal shoes.
