==Description==
In the heart of [[Scions of the Canopy|Huitztlan]] lies the [[Kongamato|"Mountain King" Kongamato]], a gargantuan creature like the mountains among which it sleeps.<br><!--
-->In moments of searing pain, in half-waking frenzies, the Mountain King sees everything as a mortal enemy,<br><!--
-->As if to prevent something from being stolen, it attacks all living things that approach without discrimination.<br><!--
-->People say that Kongamato, who once protected the tribes, was driven mad by that [[Cataclysm|dark disaster]],<br><!--
-->But they are never able to explain why the Mountain King, who ought not to be sentient, only attacks those who draw near.<br><br><!--
-->Indeed, its sanity was lost long ago, back when its sharp fangs pierced [[Burkina|that person's]] flesh.<br><!--
-->Legends speak of the one who once made pacts with it, who hunted by its side,<br><!--
-->But no matter how precious these memories were, they have now been lost to the Mountain King's long nightmare,<br><!--
-->Even the name "Kongamato" itself has become unfamiliar to the ancient lord of the [[Yumkasaurus|Yumkasaurs]].<br><br><!--
-->Yet, even so&mdash;<br><!--
-->Even if it is unable to break free from the nightmare, it must at least protect the fire &mdash; though to whom it belongs, it knows not.<br><!--
-->Even if who that person was, or why such a promise was made, have long been forgotten.<br><br><!--
-->Even if the great body it was once so proud of continues to be wracked by burning agony,<br><!--
-->Even if its now decaying frame still bears the imprints of unbearable shame,<br><!--
-->Even so, it would never allow anyone to desecrate the life and fire that were once his.<br><br><!--
-->For the giant beast, now lost to madness,<br><!--
-->Despite its soul having been consumed by the filth of darkness,<br><!--
-->This final shred of resolve it refuses to abandon, no matter what.<br><br><!--
-->"I shall return the [[Turnfire]] name to the [[Night Kingdom|Night Realm]], in exchange for the final kindling."<br><!--
-->"By past fuel, and present flame, life marches ever on."<br><!--
-->"We will answer to the fire for all our deeds. Amidst the flames, we shall be reunited."
