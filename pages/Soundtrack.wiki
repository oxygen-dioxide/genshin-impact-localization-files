==Types==
''Genshin Impact'' has different types of soundtracks that are used.
* Ambient music is determined by area boundaries on the map as well as the time of the day. Crossing a boundary or adjusting the [[time]] will cause the current soundtrack to fade out, stop, and then play another soundtrack.
* Battle themes are played whenever [[aggravation]] is triggered &mdash; that is, the enemy has detected a threat and the player has entered combat mode. These soundtracks are determined by the area and enemy type, and override nearly all other music.
** Some subareas (e.g., [[Stormterror's Lair]] and [[The Serpent's Bowels]]) do not allow battle themes to play during combat.
** Other areas (e.g., [[Dragonspine]]) have their own unique battle themes in addition to those provided by the region they are located in.
** The deeper parts of [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]] (starting from the [[Nameless Ruins]] southward) have two versions of the same tracks, with the ambient version seamlessly transitioning into a battle version when players encounter enemies and vice versa once battles are finished.
* Normal Boss themes are played whenever a Normal Boss is aggravated. There are currently only three known boss themes: ''[[Fiery Pursuit]]'' for all Normal Bosses in [[Inazuma]]'', [[No Turning Back]]'' for the [[Coral Defenders]] challenge, and ''[[Jolts in the Forest]]'' for the [[Jadeplume Terrorshroom]] and [[Aeonblight Drake]].
* [[Domains#Soundtracks|Domain themes]] are played whenever inside a [[Domain]]. Each domain has its own soundtrack that plays during the challenge.

When selecting which music to play in the open world, the game appears to perform checks in the following order:
# If the player is in combat, and a Normal Boss is in its aggravation state, then it will play the appropriate boss theme, if one is present.
# Otherwise, the game will randomly select a regional battle theme that is not a boss theme, if one is present.
# If the player is not in combat and has not been in combat for some time, it will start to play the ambient region theme. If the player reenters combat shortly after leaving combat, it will resume the battle theme.

This melody is featured in various battle themes, [[Character Demo]]s, and promotional videos, usually as an ostinato and sometimes just a single instance of the phrase. Next to the [[Genshin Impact Main Theme]], it is a notable recurring theme in ''Genshin Impact'' soundtracks.
