'''Carefree Simulacrum''' is an exploration mechanic in [[Chenyu Vale]], [[Liyue]]. They are small stone statues that need to be placed back to their original position by the player using [[Adeptus|adeptal]] energy, given to the player by [[Fujin]] during the {{Quest|Qiaoying of the Sacred Mountain}}. A button will show up when the statue is in view, allowing the player to pick the statue up. Upon doing so, it will disappear, and the player can hold the button again to aim and place the statue.

Unlike other simulacrum types, Carefree Simulacrum can speak to the player. Correctly placing one for the first time unlocks the {{Achievement|A Mere Rock...}}
