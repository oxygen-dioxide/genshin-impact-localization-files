|description    = New recruits tend to cause unnecessary damage to their own weapons due to improper use during their training. As such, training grounds tend to come with a large amount of weapons for them to use.<br>For the [[Millelith]], the weapon wear and tear caused by training is no big deal, but leaving them in the [[Treasure Hoarders|Treasure Hoarder]]'s hands is cause for salary docking for sure...
