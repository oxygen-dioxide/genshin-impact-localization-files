;(Talk to Arasata)
:'''Arasata:''' Little strokes fell great oaks. Nara {{Traveler}}, are you here to train as well...?
:'''Arasata:''' But Aradashan, Arayuta, and I won't suppress the power of the Bulky Iron Chunk this time. Though it's in the dream, it is still super scary. Want to try?
:{{DIcon}} Let's do this.
::'''Arasata:''' Please be careful.
:{{DIcon}} I'll need to make some preparations.
::'''Arasata:''' Preparations are indeed needed before facing a mighty foe... Get ready before you start...

;(Fight the Bulky Iron Chunk)

;(Talk to Arasata after defeating the Bulky Iron Chunk)
:'''Arasata:''' Nara {{Traveler}}, you are like the wind that blows away mists and miasma. Even the strongest Bulky Iron Chunk will not stand a chance against you.
:'''Arasata:''' But a Bulky Iron Chunk with all Ararakalari lifted is still very scary...
:'''Arasata:''' If you are not ready, why not challenge a Bulky Iron Chunk with three stacks of Ararakalari lifted and hone your skills first...
:'''Arasata:''' Want to challenge the Bulky Iron Chunk with three stacks of Ararakalari lifted again?
:{{DIcon}} Let's try again.
::'''Arasata:''' Please be careful...
:{{DIcon}} Not now.
::'''Arasata:''' Do not hesitate to tell Arasata if you need anything...
