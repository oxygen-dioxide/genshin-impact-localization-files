The '''Minghua Company''' {{Lang|zh=明华商行|zh_rm=Mínghuá Shāngháng}} and '''Minghua Bank''' {{Lang|zh=明华钱庄|zh_rm=Mínghuá Qiánzhuāng}} were two entities owned by [[Gentry De'an]] which flourished a decade ago. However, the [[Fatui]]'s increasing involvement in [[Liyue]]'s economy led them to undercut De'an's businesses and force their way into Liyue's market.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Gentry De'an|s=Daytime}}</ref>

After the supposed death of De'an's beloved daughter [[Huachu]], De'an sold the Minghua Bank to the Fatui to pay for her funeral. While the Minghua Company is still around, De'an bemoans its languishing business.

==Story==
Sometime before the Traveler arrived in Liyue, Huachu decided to elope with [[Jianqiu]], an arithmetic teacher at [[Chihu Rock]], after De'an refused to acknowledge their relationship.<ref name="De'an Night">{{Ref/NPC|Gentry De'an|s=Nighttime}}</ref> To that end, Huachu and Jianqiu created a diversion by dressing up a corpse as her and throwing it down the well at [[Feiyun Slope]], where it decomposed and contaminated the water source. While investigating the issue, the [[Millelith]] discovered the corpse,<ref>{{Ref/BB|Feiyun Slope Bulletin Board|Water Pollution (Part 2)}}</ref> and De'an identified it as Huachu's. In his grief, De'an decided to sell the Minghua Bank to pay for Huachu's funeral.<ref>{{Ref/BB|Feiyun Slope Bulletin Board|Gentry De'an's Message}}</ref> The Fatui were ultimately the ones to purchase the bank's facilities.<ref name="De'an Night" />

Huachu and Jianqiu, meanwhile, had departed on a self-imposed exile from [[Liyue Harbor]]. The [[Traveler]] encounters them at [[Stone Gate]], where they give cryptic and guarded answers about their destination and the purpose of their trip. Jianqiu also introduces himself as an employee of the Minghua Bank, unaware that the entity no longer existed.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Jianqiu}}</ref> When the two briefly returned to the outskirts of [[Liyue Harbor]] after Huachu grew homesick and wished to watch the [[Lantern Rite Festival]], [[Mr. Zhu]] grew suspicious of their story as he was aware that the Minghua Bank had closed. However, he ultimately chose not to pry into their affairs.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lantern Rite, Big Business?}}</ref>
