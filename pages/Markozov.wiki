Markozov is the leader of a group of [[Fatui]] stationed in the [[Girdle of the Sands]], claiming to seek "knowledge" for his own pursuits.

Eventually, he is defeated a second time and withdraws his entire forces from the region for the time being.

Markozov takes on the appearance of a [[Fatui Skirmisher - Electrohammer Vanguard]].
