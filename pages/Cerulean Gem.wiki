|description    = Commonly found in the wild in [[Fontaine]], the Cerulean Gem is brilliantly colored. Contrary to its dazzling appearance, the flower has nearly no fragrance. It swiftly curls into a hardened, fruit-like structure once plucked.<br>A certain Melusine deployed to the field had a fondness for the floweret and referred to it as "Golden Gem Flower," but was corrected by her human colleague stating that it was "cerulean." In reality, the vision of [[Melusine]]s is very different from humans, while her colleague happened to be color-blind. The Cerulean Gem is actually close to pale violet red or rosy as defined by the [[Fontaine Research Institute]]. Nonetheless, the story of the Cerulean Gem has become an interesting anecdote, known from the [[Maison Gardiennage]] to all the streets and alleys of the [[Court of Fontaine]].

==Trivia==
* This flower appears blue to individuals with protanopia, or the inability to perceive the color red.
* This flower appears to be based off ''{{w|Alcea rosea}}'' or common hollyhock, a type of plant easily found in the southwestern European countryside in both wild and cultivated forms.
