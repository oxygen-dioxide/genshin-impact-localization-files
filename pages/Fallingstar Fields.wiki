===Interactables===
====Deactivated Source Core====
Located inside the Tephric Ruins, on the right side. It resembles the source core of [[Secret Source Automaton]]s.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Deactivated Source Core:''' (A Source Core that appears to have lost its power. You feel like you've seen similar devices in a number of Source Mechanisms...)
{{Dialogue End}}

====Strange Secret Source Structure #1====<!-- Numbered arbitrarily -->
Located further inside the Tephric Ruins, on the right side. It resembles a [[Sheath of the Secret Source]] from a [[Secret Source Automaton: Hunter-Seeker]].
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Strange Secret Source Structure:''' (It seems to be part of some now-broken Secret Source structure. It was clearly placed here deliberately... perhaps as an object of worship?)
{{Dialogue End}}

====Strange Secret Source Structure #2====
Located inside the Tephric Ruins, on the left side. It resembles the outer shell of a Secret Source Automaton: Hunter-Seeker.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Strange Secret Source Structure:''' (You can't help but think that it might spring to life the instant you look away...)
{{Dialogue End}}

====Strange Secret Source Structure #3====
Located further inside the Tephric Ruins, on the left side. It resembles the peripheral "appendages" of a Secret Source Automaton: Hunter-Seeker.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Strange Secret Source Structure:''' (One can only wonder what was going through those tribespeople's minds when they placed these broken pieces of Source Mechanism here...)
{{Dialogue End}}

====Floating Ruins Platform====
Located further inside the Tephric Ruins, in the center. It is initially empty and shows the following dialogue. After obtaining [[That Which Was Once Ehecatl]], this dialogue becomes unavailable.{{verify}}<!-- only interact option is to place Ehecatl there -->
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Floating Ruins Platform:''' (There are signs there was once something placed here, but it is now as empty as can be...)
{{Dialogue End}}

====Records Regarding "Items That Should Perhaps Be Deleted..."====
A [[Secret Source Sentinel]] with an [[Iridescent Inscription]] above it, located in the hidden room that opens after returning [[That Which Was Once Ehecatl]] to its pedestal.
{{Readable|title=Records Regarding "Items That Should Perhaps Be Deleted..."|
Report on Reversing the Regressive Evolution of the Dragonborn<br>
...<br>
The following conclusions can be drawn from our experiments and trials: Previous regressive evolutionary events have significantly impacted the physiological malleability of the Dragonborn.<br>
On the one hand, [[Saurian|Dragonborn experiencing regressive evolution]] can, at present, adapt to a stable environment that has undergone (...) changes.<br>
On the other, the power such physical forms can withstand cannot be restored to their original state via (...). This can only be achieved via bloodlines... (...) can be selected and beneficial modifications then performed over generations through expression of the mark known as the "[[Flamelord's Blessing]]"...<br>
...<br>
Assessment:<br>
It may be possible to restore lost wisdom to the Dragonborn through the above methods. However, the price would be too great.<br>
There is neither enough time, nor can the bodies of many of our kin who have already regressed withstand the power required.<br>
This report should remain sealed... Even though our regressed kin are already...<br>
These experiments are too cruel.<br><br>

Comments on the Phlogiston Records<br>
Time of Comment:<br>
Unknown<br>
Comment:<br>
...This may well be an opportunity.<br>
If we could... make use of this experiment... perhaps we could overcome the barrier of destiny laid down by (...).<br>
Ah, [[Xiuhcoatl|my brother]], through all these long years, the promise [[Kukulkan|I]] saw in humanity... Was it justified, or was it all a mistake...<br>
The future I once hoped for, the world I once planned out... If any of our kin can one day truly reach that "final choice"...<br>
Will it redeem these desolate years and grant me the final answer I've longed for?}}
