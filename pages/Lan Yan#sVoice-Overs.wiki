|vo_01_01_tx             = Hello, I'm Lan Yan, from the [[Chenyu Vale]] Artisans Association! Can I interest you in any decorations or baskets? Or perhaps a vase or piece of furniture? Ah, I'm almost out of rattan. I should head back to the mountains to get more... Oh, you want to come with me? Hehe, that's so nice of you! I'll throw in a free rattan hat! How does that sound?

|vo_05_02_tx             = The legendary Wind Reader is indeed listed as an ancestor of the Lan clan, but my family split from the main branch a long time ago. The Qimen arts are complex and varied, and I've only learned a few tricks so far. Anything harder, and I need to ask my elders and cousins for help. Still, I'm really good at making rattan figures &mdash; even grandpa is no match for me! Hehe, I guess it's the one area where I really hold my own.

I was trying to tell them, "Look over here, everyone! We have a new friend with us today!" Oh, that wasn't clear? Well... "Sit" can mean "listen to me" or "stay where you are" or even "stop what you're doing." Hm? How are you supposed to know? You just need to come to the mountains more often. You'll pick it up in no time!

Although, you could probably give it a go, [[Traveler]]! Just stand still, keep your arm steady, and give a nice, swift throw. I'm sure you can do it!

|vo_07_02_tx             = You can never be too careful when it comes to wild mushrooms. Many are completely inedible, and others have to be stir-fried and cooked fully to be safe. And, if you don't finish them in one sitting, you have to do the same to the leftovers before consuming them &mdash; a lot of people forget that step. So, if you eat a few bites, and your dog starts telling you to put away the laundry, or your chickens start ordering you around the house, seek medical attention right away!

|vo_07_03_file           = VO_{language}{character} Interesting Things.ogg
|vo_07_03_tx             = Once, I was resting in a tree after finishing some weaving, and a [[squirrel]] stole the rattan [[pinecone]]s I just made! Thankfully, I was able to get them back by trading for double the amount of real pinecones. Honestly, I didn't really care about losing my work, I was more worried about ruining the squirrel's entire day! Just imagine &mdash; you spend all day collecting pinecones only to get home and realize they're fake! All their squirrel friends would probably laugh at them...

|vo_08_01_tx             = Everyone says first impressions are important, and the first time I ate at [[Wanmin Restaurant]], I had so much regret... regret that it took me so long to visit [[Liyue Harbor]]! I could have met Xiangling way sooner... In any case, as soon as she heard me talk about all the rare ingredients in the mountains of my hometown, she started planning a trip to Chenyu Vale! I'll make sure she doesn't go home empty-handed!

|vo_08_02_tx             = Director Hu always seems so upbeat and cheerful. Even when the situation was desperate, she was always there with a joke to cheer me up. I haven't known her long, so I was wondering... Is she always like that? Hmm... In any case, starting from today, I hope all her smiles are out of genuine happiness, rather than an effort to reassure other people.

|vo_08_03_tx             = When will the Yuheng finally take a break? She was running all over the place during the [[Lantern Rite Festival|Lantern Rite]]. I wanted to treat her to a meal to thank her for her kindness, but I never had the chance... I was also hoping she could do my hair into a pair of cat ears just like hers. But... maybe that's asking too much. Although, something tells me she wouldn't mind...

|vo_08_04_tx             = I've run into master Xingqiu several times in the mountains. He wasn't accompanied by anyone from the [[Feiyun Commerce Guild]], so it never seemed like official business. After those chance encounters, he often brought me copies of the newest supernatural novels, and I promised to never tell anyone. Except... I definitely just told you, didn't I? Please keep that secret for the both of us, Traveler!

|vo_08_05_tx             = One time, I was out with grandpa on one of his house calls, when I saw Chongyun leave the house with a dejected look on his face. Given how helpless he looked, I assumed the situation must have been bad, but I didn't sense an ominous presence within the house. Grandpa's reading didn't predict any misfortune, either. Maybe he spent a lot of energy getting rid of the problem and was too tired to talk... Huh? You think it's possible he didn't do anything at all? That makes me even more confused...

|vo_08_06_tx             = I've known Gaming since we were kids! He was quite the neighborhood terror back then, haha. Hm? That doesn't sound like him? Well, he's matured a lot since then, just like I have. One thing hasn't changed, though &mdash; he still carries snacks with him wherever he goes. He always comes back from his travels with a ton of goodies to share with his friends. And, of course, he never leaves without stocking up on his hometown favorites...

Or, we can pretend the [[Redbill Pelican|Red-Beaked Pelicans]] are bandits and try to rescue [[Jade Heartfeather Bass]] from their beaks... Oh, you want to play [[Windtrace]]? You'll be the Hunter? Hehe, someone's confident. Alright, if you end up running in circles, I'll ring my silver bell to help you find me. If you manage to touch even the tip of my hair, I'll count that as your win!

My silver hairpin, necklace, and brooch are all birthday presents from my parents. Oh, the bracelet is a Lantern Rite gift from my grandpa, and the earrings are from the last [[Moonchase Festival]], I think... There are also others that were given to me when I mastered the [[wind glider]], received my Vision, and managed to down three whole bowls of rice in one meal...<br>Hehe, my family believes that silver accessories are auspicious and can ward off evil, so I'm constantly receiving new ones!<br>Wearing them all at once is pretty heavy, but...

I mean, a bunch of misshapen black and gray dolls throughout the house... it's the stuff of nightmares for a kid! When grandpa used to send me to study with the head family of our clan, I thought he was possessed. I thought my cousin was teaching me the dark arts! So, one night, I worked up the courage to burn all the figures I could find. Luckily, their purpose was to absorb evil energy, so they were always meant to be destroyed.<br>But, that got me thinking &mdash; if rattan figures looked cuter, maybe people wouldn't mistake them for some kind of evil sorcery...

|vo_09_05_tx             = Rattan weaving isn't hard, I swear! Even the most intricate figures are made one strand at a time. All you need is a little patience, and you'll get there in the end! Compared to the technique itself, precision is the hard part, and persistence can be even harder. If you ask me, though, the most important element is happiness. If you don't enjoy the process, you'll never do a good job &mdash; that's true for more than just weaving. Happiness is key! That goes for both of us!

Hehe, looks just like us, right?<br>I infused the rattan strands with incense, so hanging them on your knapsack should repel insects. Oh, and I designed the silver accessories, too.
