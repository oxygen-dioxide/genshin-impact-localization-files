==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Vert Jr.:''' Hmm... So many businesses, so much potential. All they lack is a guide to help build up their brand image.
:{{DIcon}} And you are?
::'''Vert Jr.:''' Hello there, my friendly and passionate friend. I'm Vert Jr., and I hail from [[Quartier Lyonnais]] in the [[Court of Fontaine]], where I'm really known as Petit Vert.
::'''Vert Jr.:''' After arriving in Yilong Wharf, my friends in Liyue nicknamed me Vert Jr. based on my name's meaning.
::'''Vert Jr.:''' Vert, or green, is the color of tea leaves. So far, it's made the locals more affable toward me and helped build my personal brand...
::'''Vert Jr.:''' And in the long term, I'll be having an extended stay in Yilong Wharf to carefully study and promote the local cuisine.
::'''Vert Jr.:''' Hmm... Why don't I call my first travel guide "Vert's Vouchsafes"!
::{{DIcon}} A tourism guidebook?
::'''Vert Jr.:''' Heh! My sister Rouge and I have dedicated ourselves to the discovery of sights worth visiting and cuisine worth tasting.
::'''Vert Jr.:''' Gorgeous views and delicious food are treasures that belong to everyone in Teyvat. Every tourist should seize the opportunity to enjoy them!
::'''Vert Jr.:''' But non-frequent visitors must inquire about the scenic spots and cuisine from scratch...
::'''Vert Jr.:''' What a bother! It would probably take them years, just like it's taking me!
::'''Vert Jr.:''' Just think! How convenient would things be if we had one... Or even several detailed, comprehensive guides to refer to?
::'''Vert Jr.:''' That's exactly why my sister and I have decided to explore every settlement in Teyvat. We'll create that very series of travel guides for the sake of all tourists!
::'''Vert Jr.:''' Things have been going very smoothly, and we only encountered a small hiccup along the way...
::'''Vert Jr.:''' Problem being that my sister found herself unused to the food outside of Fontaine, so we had to switch jobs...
::'''Vert Jr.:''' Now, her Rouge's Registry will be a record of scenic attractions, while my Vert's Vouchsafes will be about cuisine!
:{{DIcon}} Brand image?
::'''Vert Jr.:''' What do you think? It's your first time hearing this term, I'll bet!
::'''Vert Jr.:''' My elder sister Rouge and I are both representatives of this profession!
::'''Vert Jr.:''' We still haven't made a name for ourselves in the Court of Fontaine, sure, but many stores have sought out our help!
::'''Vert Jr.:''' We offer comprehensive assistance to stores to improve their public brand, including but not limited to advertisements, news columns, short videos, large-scale events, etc.
::'''Vert Jr.:''' For many stores, their excellent service is not reflected in their reputation. However, through the publicity we offer, we will bring their repute up to par with their ability.
::'''Vert Jr.:''' According to the information we've collected, some restaurants in Liyue are suffering from this issue...
::'''Vert Jr.:''' Most restaurants here offer delicious cuisine at reasonable prices, so they rarely have any competitors in the same price range. Residents only need to spend a small amount of Mora to enjoy a sumptuous feast.
::'''Vert Jr.:''' However, more high-end food and beverage brands are needed... After all, even chefs require the support of a brand image.
::'''Vert Jr.:''' If all restaurants operated on a small scale, the culinary profession would be seen as tons of work for little money. Few would be willing to take up the culinary arts.
::'''Vert Jr.:''' If this profession is to have a future, we'll also need outfits that target the wealthy, earn big, and pay chefs handsomely...
::'''Vert Jr.:''' This high-low combination will allow the general public to enjoy delicious food without worry. It would also be respectable to be a chef, and you'd be paid proportionately to your skill.
::'''Vert Jr.:''' Maybe I can help improve this situation... I'll need to get a better understanding of Liyue's food industry first, though.
::'''Vert Jr.:''' Best to start our research from Yilong Wharf before gradually expanding outward...
:{{DIcon}} Sorry to bother you.
::'''Vert Jr.:''' Oh my, how polite of you... Feel free to come chat with me anytime!
