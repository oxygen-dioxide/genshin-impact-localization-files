|description    = A hut with a unique shape, with its roof covered with a heavy leaf canopy. The process of making the top of this kind of tent is very exquisite. After being soaked in a decoction made using a secret recipe, the wood is quickly seared in a bonfire lit by the dead branches of the [[Adhigama Wood]] to dry quickly, then waterproofed by immersing it in large amounts of water, resulting in a material that can repel insects without a pungent odor, but that is also not easily burnt. Safe and practical, these huts were originally developed by the inhabitants of [[Vimara Village]] and are used by the [[Forest Watchers]] as shelters when stationed in areas with more abundant rainfall.<br />Of course, being stationed in areas where such shelters are needed is also a test of spirit for the [[Forest Rangers]], who must have a strong sense of responsibility and conviction.
