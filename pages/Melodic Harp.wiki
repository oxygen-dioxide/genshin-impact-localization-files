'''Melodic Harps''' are exploration puzzles found in [[Golden Apple Archipelago/2.8|Golden Apple Archipelago]] during [[Summertime Odyssey]]. When a Melodic Harp is glowing, it can be activated. An activated Melodic Harp will release sound waves that will cause any [[Melodic Bloom]]s within an AoE to fire notes.
