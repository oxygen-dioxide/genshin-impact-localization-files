==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Chanil:''' When will I be able to bring a [[Saurian]] home...
:{{DIcon}} Would you like to raise one?
::'''Chanil:''' Yes, I do! I really want to, even in my dreams!
::'''Chanil:''' But Mom and Dad keep telling me that I'm still too young, and that I'll have to earn some kind of special name before I can bring a Saurian home...
::'''Chanil:''' Why? I really don't get it. Don't I already have a name of my own? Is it because the Saurians can't understand the way we talk, so we've got to use their language instead?
::'''Chanil:''' *sigh* When will I finally be considered a grown-up? I just want to be able to cuddle with my Saurian as I eat and fall asleep...
::{{DIcon}} There's plenty of Saurians about.
::'''Chanil:''' I know, I know! I've taken nearly all the baby Saurians in the tribe home at one point or another.
::'''Chanil:''' But none of them was able to stay for too long... They all returned to their partners sooner than later.
::'''Chanil:''' Actually, now that you mention it, I don't think any of their grown-up partners had any kind of fancy name...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Maybe they've got something they need to work together on.
::'''Chanil:''' Is that so? Well, in that case, should I not stop making a ruckus, and instead wait patiently for their return?
::'''Chanil:''' I've got it. I'll prepare some snacks for them next time. I want all the little Saurians to know that my house is a good place for them to relax!
::'''Chanil:''' C'mon, you take some too. If you spot any lil' Saurians having a roadside rest, do share it with them.
::; Obtain {{Item|Quenepa Berry|x=4}}
:{{DIcon}} You'll be able to one day.
::'''Chanil:''' Really? Ah, but I'll be a lot happier if I don't have to wait so long...
