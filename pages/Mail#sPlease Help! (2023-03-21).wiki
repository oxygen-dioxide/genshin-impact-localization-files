To be more precise... During festive periods, the [[Knights of Favonius]] often find themselves busy with festival preparations. I have had a bit of spare time recently, and I wish to use it to organize a picnic for everyone by myself.

Planning the itinerary, confirming the location, setting the area up, and preparing all kinds of little things to create a nice ambiance... These things aren't a problem for me. However, the choice of food for the menu has been quite nerve-wracking. Everybody has different tastes, and choosing traditional [[Mondstadt]] cuisine might seem too bland and unoriginal...

I eventually managed to create this menu, but my knowledge of dishes from [[Sumeru]] really isn't very deep, so I would like you to try it and see how it tastes!

Could you please lend me a hand?
