|text      = I recently found myself with some spare time, so I visited [[Qiaoying Village]]. Firstly, to relax, and secondly, because the end of each year is a time for giving gifts to kith and kin.

The distinctive mountains of [[Chenyu Vale]] are striking, and the waters have a delicate beauty. It certainly must be counted among the top destinations for a calming stroll. Should you find yourself otherwise unoccupied in the future, you must come and see for yourself. As for myself, I enjoyed a slow walk the entire time, and before I knew it, the smoke from a hundred hearths filled my senses with the fragrance of food.

The world seeks shelter before the cold that comes with the year's ending, and now is the best time to invite a few close friends to sit around the fire, brewing a pot of hot tea and reminiscing about the past.

A mouthful of winter tea can stave off the cold and chills, and restore one's vitality.

Yet these tea leaves are quite fragile, and cannot withstand the bumps and jolts of a long journey. I shall keep them for now, and we may brew them after you have arrived.
