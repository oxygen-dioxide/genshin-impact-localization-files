===Tic-Tac-Toe===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the tic-tac-toe grid)
:'''Paimon:''' This grid... Are they planning to play tic-tac-toe here or something?
:'''Paimon:''' *sigh* Where could the Monetoo for that red stone be...

;(Place the stone in the top left)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Would it be better to put it down there?
:'''Paimon:''' We won! Great job us!
{{Dialogue End}}

==="Bing Bong Ding Dong"===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Read "A Child's Notes", optional)
::{{Readable|title=A Child's Notes|text=
(Childish, scribbled writings are visible:)<br><!--
-->This game's called "Bing Bong Ding Dong," and here's the rules:<br><!--
-->1. When the Bing Bong Monetoo isn't ding-donging, ride on the [[Saurian]] statue's back to make it move forward.<br><!--
-->2. Get off the Saurian statue when the Bing Bong Monetoo counts down to a "ding!" or you'll lose.<br><!--
-->3. First one to run to the Bing Bong Monetoo wins!<br><!--
-->And don't give me that "isn't this just Red Light, Green Light?" crap. Rules are important, and it's precisely because you don't respect the rules that you can't win!}}

;(Start the game)
:'''Paimon:''' Ohhh, d'you think it wants us to sit on that little statue?

;(Throughout the game, intermittently)
:'''Bing Bong Monetoo:''' Bing-bing-bong...
:'''Bing Bong Monetoo:''' Ding-dong...
:'''Bing Bong Monetoo:''' Ding!

;(Get caught by the Bing Bong Monetoo)
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, does that mean... we lost? Seems like we're supposed to get up before it counts down to a "ding!" or we lose...
:;(Game ends; must restart)

;(Partway through the game)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, that Monetoo tried to rush it and got caught... Guess that's game over for it...

;(Win the game)
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, that should mean we won!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Color Match===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the Monetoo)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? There's a bunch of weird Monetoo gathered here too. What could they be up to...

;(Talk to the Monetoo with the empty jar)
:'''Monetoo:''' ?
:'''Paimon:''' On closer inspection, it does seem odd that the only empty jar is the one in front of this Monetoo...
:'''Paimon:''' Did the other Monetoo find what they were looking for but this one didn't?
:'''Paimon:''' Poor thing... C'mon, {{Traveler}}, let's help it find the stuff that was meant to fit in this jar... Hmm. What would that be, though?

;(Place a red item in the jar)
:'''Monetoo:''' !
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, so this is what we're looking for &mdash; something with red in it!
:'''Paimon:''' Wait... Huh? The stuff we threw in is gone... We did chuck something in, right? Something doesn't feel quite right here...
:'''Paimon:''' Is there something else in the jar?
:{{DIcon}} (Knock on the jar)
::'''Paimon:''' Ugh, a [[Slime]]... There's a Slime inside...
::'''Paimon:''' No wonder this jar's been empty the whole time... Turns out you hid whatever was meant to be inside it!

:;(Defeat the slimes)
::'''Paimon:''' Hmph, well, that's the thief taken care of. Time to give back what you stole!

;(Place an item of any other color)
:'''Monetoo:''' ?
:'''Paimon:''' Umm, this doesn't look to be the right thing...
