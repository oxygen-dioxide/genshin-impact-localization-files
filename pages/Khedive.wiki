==Dialogue==
{{StubDialogue|Determine conditions for dialogue set #4.<br />
'''Dialogue Set #4:''' I got this dialogue after purifying the large crystal and before talking to Zhiqiong back at the second campsite. I completed all the investigation quests at this point. Judging by the content the dialogue seems fit before entering the Chasm underground mines. It's probably this is bugged. Bug the dialogue wasn't mentioned anywhere. So having it noted here before figuring out the intended condition.}}
===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing ''[[Chasm Spelunkers]]''.''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Khedive:''' Why, hello! It's you!
:'''Khedive:''' Hah, they actually managed to get you to come here.
:{{DIcon}} Yes, it's me.
:{{DIcon}} Do I know you?
:'''Khedive:''' Ah, my apologies, please! My name is Khedive. Khedive Pursina.
:'''Khedive:''' If you know anything of the history of the [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]], you would know that our founder was once the rival of the [[House of Purbiruni|Purbirunis]] in the field of astronomy...
:{{DIcon}} Well, I'm (Traveler).
::'''Khedive:''' Ah, there's no need for you to introduce yourself so specifically. Your name and its fame have long reached my ears.
:{{DIcon}} Is announcing your academic school of thought tradition in Sumeru?
::'''Khedive:''' Ah, no, no... It is just... Let's just call it a scholar's pride, shall we?
::'''Khedive:''' Actually, you know what? I blame [[Anisa]] for infecting me with the Purbirunis' bad habit in that regard.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here?
:'''Khedive:''' I'm a researcher who was specifically called in by the Ministry of Civil Affairs. My task is to study the changes that have occurred in life forms within The Chasm before it reopens, and to examine any items of paleontological interest...
:'''Khedive:''' Of course, it has been agreed that I shall share the results of my research with the historical society here in Liyue.
:'''Khedive:''' *sigh* I know what you're thinking, and to be honest this does, in principle, violate the rules of the Akademiya. But the Liyue authorities were quite firm about this. I doubt anyone could have moved them an inch.
:'''Khedive:''' Additionally, the exploration team has been signed under my name, and I am to pay for the salaries of all the camp's miners out of pocket... So if we don't get results, it'll be quite the loss for me.
:{{DIcon}} That's true...
:{{DIcon}} That sounds really rough.
:'''Khedive:''' It's fine, though. I've got the Mora.
:{{DIcon}} Alright, then. See you.
:'''Khedive:''' See you!
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''Chasm Spelunkers'' but before completing the investigation quests.''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Khedive:''' What a curious geological environment we're in now! I'm sure I can outdo the research goals set by the Akademiya this year.
:'''Khedive:''' Oh, Traveler, what's up?
;(If the player has collected at least one [[Starshroom]])
:{{DIcon|Quest}} So, about these mushrooms...
:;(Starts ''[[Mycological Investigation in The Chasm]]'')
;(If the player has at least one [[Photo of a Strange Rock]])
:{{DIcon|Quest}} About the strange rock we found...
:;(Starts the [[Paleontological Investigation in The Chasm]] World Quest)
;(If the player has obtained the [[Strange Object]])
:{{DIcon|Quest}} About the strange object...
:;(Starts the [[Hydrological Investigation in The Chasm]] World Quest)
:{{DIcon}} Nothing...
:;(Dialogue ends)
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #3===
''Available after completing the investigation quests.''
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Khedive:''' Oh? Why, hello there! I thought you'd left, (Traveler).
:'''Khedive:''' The energy readings around here have stabilized a great deal, thanks to you. When I go back and write my thesis, I will mention you for sure.
:'''Khedive:''' However, as the nominal employer of the exploration team, I will still need to stay for a long time to observe this place.
:{{DIcon}} So, how's your research going?
::'''Khedive:''' Since you've helped me so much so far, I could tell you a few things, no problem.
::'''Khedive:''' We came here to monitor the anomalous energies that have been radiating from deep below and study the effects they are having on The Chasm.
::'''Khedive:''' It seems clear now, though, that the situation we face is far more complex than we first imagined.
::'''Khedive:''' If it wasn't for your valor, I doubt that we'd have gotten anywhere near as much data as we have.
:{{DIcon}} Well, I've got to go.
::'''Khedive:''' Then I shan't keep you. Just know that you'll always be welcome with the exploration team!
{{Dialogue end}}

===Dialogue Set #4===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Khedive:''' Hello, (Traveler)! It's great to see you here.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here?
::'''Khedive:''' A field study, to record and research ancient life forms and their remains. Well, and I'm also here to observe the abnormalities in the geological layers.
::'''Paimon:''' And you're not going down there yourself?
::'''Khedive:''' Me? Go down there? No, of course not.
::'''Khedive:''' I mean, I did pay for this exploration team to be set up. I'll fork out the Mora, you do the work. My research gets done, you get paid. I'm happy, you're happy. See?
::'''Khedive:''' That's how that works.
::'''Paimon:''' ...This guy is really annoying.
:{{DIcon}} Bye.
::'''Khedive:''' Well, don't let me keep you too long.
{{Dialogue end}}
