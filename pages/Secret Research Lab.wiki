|description    = A plain old [[alchemy]] workshop. Take out the specialized, intricate apparatus and it would look just like any other study, but for the collection of books on the shelves, the reagents in their containers, and the various experimental samples marked "Do Not Open," the uses of which can only be wildly guessed at by the uninitiated. An incident is probably unavoidable should some curious cat fall to heed his instruction.<br>After actual cats that mistakenly entered the workshop caused two such alchemical potion accidents, the [[Knights of Favonius]] Investigation Team would place strict entry-exit regulations on alchemy workshops within the city. A great number of the strange rumors concerning alchemy were also born around this time, causing no small number of headaches for researchers just trying to concentrate on their work.
