{{Description|A rather exquisite wine cup used in pre-combat rituals.}}
'''Martial Artist's Wine Cup''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Martial Artist]].

==Description==
Before proudly stepping into the arena, a parting ritual with a glass of fine wine is essential for martial artists.<br>Each of them faced with a worthy opponent, two martial artists will raise their glasses to one another.<br>They then step into the arena with a calm and collected composure to face their opponent with the utmost respect.<br>This is the true meaning of the toast, which comes before the fight takes place. It does not serve to glorify victory or cast shame on defeat.
