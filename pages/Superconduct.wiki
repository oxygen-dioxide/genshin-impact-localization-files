{{Elemental Reaction Intro|element1=Electro|element2=Cryo}}

Superconduct does ''not'' apply Cryo to targets hit, and therefore cannot trigger further elemental reactions.

==Damage==
{{See also|Damage#Transformative Reaction Damage|Level Scaling/Reaction}}
{{Transformative Reaction Damage}}

Note that one target can only take '''2''' instances of Superconduct DMG every '''0.5''' seconds from the same attacker, as limited by the [[Damage Sequence]].<ref>KeqingMains Theorycrafting Library: [https://library.keqingmains.com/evidence/combat-mechanics/elemental-effects/transformative-reactions Transformative Reactions]</ref> Additionally, multiple Superconduct reactions triggered on the same target within '''0.1''' seconds can only produce DMG once, regardless of the source.

==Environment==
'''Superconduct''' can also occur in the environment when dealing Electro to [[water]] that was previously [[frozen]] by Cryo, shortening the frozen duration and causing the water underneath to be [[Electro-Charged]]. However, no AoE damage is dealt, nor does the Physical RES of any nearby enemies decrease. Superconduct will not occur when dealing Cryo to Electro-Charged water. However, using {{Cryo}} on an [[Electro Crystal]] or {{Electro}} on a [[Mist Flower Corolla|Mist Flower]] will also cause Superconduct and deal DMG to nearby enemies.

When {{Cryo}} meets {{Electro}}, Superconduct occurs. Superconduct will deal {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}}, and will decrease the Physical RES of any beings affected by Superconduct for a time.

Switch characters in battle to use {{Cryo}} and {{Electro}} attacks in tandem to trigger Superconduct and defeat your opponents swiftly!
