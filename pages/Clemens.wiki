{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Clemens:''' I'm a winemaker from [[Sailing Breeze]]. I came to this market specifically to purchase ingredients.
:'''Clemens:''' You haven't heard of us at all? Heh, that's no surprise. We're an old brand, but we primarily do business overseas these days. We don't even have a shop in Mondstadt anymore.
:'''Clemens:''' We can't compete with [[Dawn Winery]], but Sailing Breeze has made quite a name for itself in [[Inazuma]].
:'''Clemens:''' That girl [[Karpillia]] was so desperate to expand into the overseas market, but it was the right call in the end.
:'''Clemens:''' Thanks to her, my skills can still be put to good use even now.
