{{Description|Since the People of the Springs was first established, an ancient legend has circulated within the tribe — a mysterious island, situated in a rarely visited Domain, promises astonishing wealth and unparalleled glory to those who reach it.<br>Yet, however tempting it might sound, this bounty is far from easily attained. In all their history, only a handful have ever managed to reach this island. It is said that even the top guides from the People of the Springs are unable to guarantee passage through all the trials that must first be passed.<br>But naturally, for someone whose adventures have already taken them across five nations, the opportunity to take up such a challenge is too good to simply pass up.<br>Yet, before you can embark on this journey, it seems that there is a "condition that must be met"...}}

{{Description|In the end, you and Mualani completed your trip to the mysterious island together.

Though you brought back no treasures, the memories you came away with were more precious still. What was the meaning of this journey? Maybe it lies in the commemorative picture that Mualani gave you... or the realization of the answer that has long been buried in your heart. Or maybe, just maybe, it was both.}}
