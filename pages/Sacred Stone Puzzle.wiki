'''Sacred Stone Puzzles''' are found on [[Yashiori Island]] in [[Inazuma]]. They contain Sacred Stone Mounds and Thunderbearer Mirrors. All Sacred Stone Puzzles are part of the [[Orobashi's Legacy]] Quest Series and can only be completed when the corresponding quest is unlocked.

When a '''Sacred Stone Mound''' is attacked, it will fire an electrical current in the direction it is facing. Sacred Stone Mounds are pillars with a semicircle at the top.

When a '''Thunderbearer Mirror''' receives electric current fired from the Sacred Stone Mound, it will redirect it in the direction it is facing. Thunderbearer Mirrors are pillars with a full circle at the top and a semicircle perpendicular to the full circle.

Both Sacred Stone Mounds and Thunderbearer Mirrors can be adjusted to change their direction and elevation angle to direct the current in a specific direction. All of the Thunderbearer Mirrors need to be used to solve the puzzle.
