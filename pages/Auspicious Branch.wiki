==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* The Chinese name references a {{Lang|willow branch|zh=杨枝|zh_rm=yángzhī}} which has multiple meanings and connotations.
** It may be referring to a {{Lang|{{w|teeth-cleaning twig}}|sa=दन्तकाष्ठ|sa_rm=dantakāṣṭha|sa_lit=tooth wood}}. As these were often made from willow branches, they were named as such in Chinese.
** A willow branch was customarily broken off and offered as a farewell gift in ancient times.
** The Chinese {{w|Guanyin}} is typically depicted holding a willow branch. The willow branch is a symbol of being able to bend but not break.
<!--*** She is also typically depicted holding a {{Lang|vase|zh=净瓶|zh_rm=jìngpíng|sa=कळश|sa_rm=kaḷaśa}} of pure water or {{w|amrita}} (called {{Lang|"sweet dew"|zh=甘露水}}) which she sprinkles with the willow branch and is said to be able to bring peace to mankind, among other powers.
*** The willow branch and dew is referenced in the Chinese name of the dessert {{Lang|{{w|mango pomelo sago}}|zh=杨枝甘露|zh_lit=willow branch amrita}}.-->
