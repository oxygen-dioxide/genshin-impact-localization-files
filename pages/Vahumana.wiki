==Overview==
Members of Vahumana undertake expeditions to ruins. [[Scroll of Streaming Song]] was discovered in some desert ruins during one such expedition and translated by Vahumana scholars, although Tafazzoli, a [[Haravatat]] Herbad, criticized parts of their translation.

A popular topic among Vahumana students is Time-Sensitive Commodities, or TSC. Their research and advice on this topic has helped fruit and vegetable sellers at the [[Grand Bazaar]] prevent waste and save Mora.<ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|Sweetness in Exchange}}</ref> They have worked alongside [[Amurta]] scholars to design products related to food preservation and overfishing.<ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|Sweetness in Storage}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|Fisherman's Clemency}}</ref>
