==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Nakano:''' Ah, hello. How may I help you?
:{{DIcon}} Are you enjoying the view?
::'''Nakano:''' Yes. I enjoy watching this ocean and the sunshine every day.
::'''Nakano:''' You're still young, so you probably don't know yet. The scenery you'll see in your 40s won't really be that much different from the stuff you're seeing in your 20s.
::'''Nakano:''' Seeing how the sun rises from the east, sets in the west, and how the tides flow this way and that, I feel like I can understand the Eternity that the Almighty Shogun is pursuing...
::{{DIcon}} Eternity...
:::'''Nakano:''' I'm just a commoner. How could I possibly comprehend eternity as the Almighty Shogun conceives it? I am probably overstepping.
:::'''Nakano:''' But I'm already half a century old, and yet I'm still a regular samurai like when I was young. I still can't help but feel sorry for this ordinary life I've led.
:::'''Nakano:''' Looking back on it now, those fights I got into when I was young were really pointless. I'd rather spend the rest of my short, ordinary life just by watching this ocean...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} But I can't stop here.
:::'''Nakano:''' Ahh, it seems you still have unfulfilled wishes, young Traveler.
:::'''Nakano:''' Well... It's good that you have aspirations that drive you.
:::'''Nakano:''' This bow was given to me by a friend when I was still young... However, I've never had the chance to use it.
:::'''Nakano:''' I don't think it'll do me any good, so I'll give it to you. If it can help you in your journey, then it has served its purpose.
::;(Obtain 3★ [[Recurve Bow]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Nakano:''' Um, goodbye. Enjoy your life.
