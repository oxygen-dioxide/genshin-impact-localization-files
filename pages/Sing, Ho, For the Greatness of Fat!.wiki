{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Suriqui)
:'''Suriqui:''' Ah, valiant passerby, since you've come all the way to [[Teteocan]], I take it you're someone seeking strength, aren't you?
:'''Suriqui:''' Perhaps you've already seen some that the Collective of Plenty would call strong. Hah. Bunch of meatheads, they are, if you ask me.
:'''Suriqui:''' But you? You're pretty lean &mdash; not yet one of those gym addicts obsessed with their daily lifts and bench-presses, I'm sure.
:'''Suriqui:''' I'll tell you what, all of that is a scam. Don't be fooled.
:{{DIcon}} Do you hate working out?
:{{DIcon}} Do you hate muscles?
:'''Suriqui:''' Well, maybe things aren't as simple as that. But muscle worship and the claim that a warrior's strength flows from them? Absolute nonsense.
:'''Suriqui:''' Know this! The heroes of old could never have had bodies that were nothing but skin, bones, and muscle.
:'''Suriqui:''' They lived in far harsher conditions than we do today, where survival and defense were paramount. To endure real combat, they would've definitely maintained a healthy layer of fat for protection.
:'''Suriqui:''' As such, their physique would've been more like mine.
:'''Suriqui:''' Yes, this slightly chubby build I've got is what the heroes of old would've had &mdash; a body that balances impact and agility.
:'''Suriqui:''' But sadly, the people of this tribe just can't see the truth. Ugh, idiots all.
:'''Suriqui:''' You don't look entirely convinced... Hmm, how about this?
:'''Suriqui:''' Try out the jar-smashing challenge I've constructed! I set this location up to train myself, but I wouldn't mind letting you have a go.
:'''Suriqui:''' You'll see just how powerful a larger build can be in real combat once you've given this a shot!
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Allow me to give it a try.
:;(Starts challenge)
:{{DIcon}} I'll need a moment to prepare.
::'''Suriqui:''' No problem, come back whenever you're prepared.

;(Talk to Suriqui again if "I'll need a moment to prepare" was chosen)

::'''Suriqui:''' No problem, come back whenever you're prepared.

;(Talk to Suriqui after completing the challenge)
:'''Suriqui:''' Hehe. Not bad, but you're still a bit behind me.
:'''Suriqui:''' I've been rocking the slightly chubby look for a while now, but trust me, I've never skimped on my training. My agility and impact are way beyond those clueless gym junkies.
:'''Suriqui:''' Forget chasing muscles &mdash; come join me in celebrating the greatness of fat!
----
;(Talk to Illimani after a while)
:'''Illimani:''' Hey, valiant passerby over there &mdash; yes, you!
:'''Illimani:''' Sigh, you're so skinny... Have you been eating properly?
:{{DIcon}} But... all the food got eaten by my guide, [[Paimon]].
::'''Illimani:''' No matter what your reasons or struggles might be, the first rule is: you must eat well!
:{{DIcon}} Huh? Are you offering to treat me to a meal?
::'''Illimani:''' Well, that's not what I meant... But if you're really starving, I do have some grilled meat in my bag. Anyway, let's set that aside for now...
:'''Illimani:''' Since you've made it to Teteocan, you've probably already seen the warriors from Collective of Plenty, right?
:'''Illimani:''' Out of the goodness of my heart, let me give you a piece of advice: never trust those guys who are obsessed with preaching about muscles.
:'''Illimani:''' The fat that the [[Archon]] blessed us with is a precious gift. Giving up all the delicious food and losing your fat just to chase after some flashy muscles?
:'''Illimani:''' That's the dumbest thing ever. Even the forest boars would pity you.
:'''Illimani:''' And honestly, if we're talking about what looks good, this whole muscle-worship thing only became popular in the last few decades.
:'''Illimani:''' My grandpa told me that back in his day, people actually preferred a slightly fuller figure.
:'''Illimani:''' So, don't let anyone mislead you into going down the wrong path to lose weight!
:'''Illimani:''' But, if one day you end up like my relatives from Collective of Plenty and decide to lose weight in the name of strength...
:'''Illimani:''' Here's something else to remember: when it comes to agility, warriors with a slightly chubby build can also be as nimble as fish. But when it comes to strength, those skinny guys are no match for us.
:'''Illimani:''' If you need proof, just look at the jars on this training ground.
:'''Illimani:''' With my build, I can easily {{color|buzzword|sprint through without breaking a single jar}}. I bet even the skinny ones couldn't pull that off with this level of agility, don't you think?
:'''Illimani:''' Oh, I can see it &mdash; you're trying not to laugh, huh? Fine... I know you don't believe me.
:'''Illimani:''' Come on, give it a try! Run through this training ground as fast as you can, but be sure {{color|buzzword|not to break any of the jars}}!
:'''Illimani:''' Let's see how well you do &mdash; and whether you can beat my record.
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Allow me to give it a try.
:;(Starts challenge)
:{{DIcon}} I'll need a moment to prepare.
::'''Illimani:''' No problem, come back whenever you're prepared.

::'''Illimani:''' No problem, come back whenever you're prepared.

;(Talk to Illimani or Suriqui after completing the challenge)
:'''Suriqui:''' Illimani, you seem to have gained some weight again &mdash; congrats!
:'''Illimani:''' Haha, thanks, Suriqui.
:'''Illimani:''' Good news, by the by &mdash; I just talked another skinny person out of dieting the other day.
:'''Suriqui:''' Oh, nice! That's awesome!
:'''Suriqui:''' Hey, what about you? Been eating well these days?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, been eating great.
::'''Illimani:''' That's what I like to hear &mdash; eat more, get nice and chubby.
:{{DIcon}} Not eating so great, though.
::'''Suriqui:''' That's no good. Nothing's more important than eating properly.
:'''Suriqui:''' Oh, by the way, Illimani, this person's jar-smashing record is insane &mdash; just a little short of my best.
:'''Illimani:''' {{MC|m=He|f=She}} even challenged me here. Did pretty well, too.
:'''Suriqui:''' Wow, not bad! Didn't expect you to be so good &mdash; almost beat the two of us.
:'''Illimani:''' Honestly, if he gains a bit more weight, he might actually beat us.
:'''Suriqui:''' Yeah, totally possible. But honestly, you're still a bit too skinny &mdash; you've got room to bulk up. That said...
:'''Suriqui:''' I approve of you!
:'''Illimani:''' I approve of you too!
:'''Illimani:''' But seriously, you should eat more at every meal.
:'''Suriqui:''' No skipping meals, no dieting &mdash; we'd be so disappointed if you did.
