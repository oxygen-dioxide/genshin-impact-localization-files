;(Upon arriving at the location)
:{{A|vo eqfh002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Venti might be here already, let's take a look inside!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 1 athos 01.ogg}} '''[[Athos]]:''' Halt! Citizens, what noble errand brings you?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is Kaeya here? We need him for something.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 1 athos 02.ogg}} '''Athos:''' Captain Kaeya? He's on duty in Jean's office.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh? Why is he in Jean's office?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 1 athos 03.ogg}} '''Athos:''' The Windblume Festival celebrations have always been hosted by the Knights of Favonius. During the festivities, Master Jean personally goes out on patrol.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 1 athos 04.ogg}} '''Athos:''' Captain Kaeya takes over her administrative duties during that period.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, is that right...
----
;(Talk to Kaeya)
:{{A|vo eqfh002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hiya!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 2 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Traveler, Paimon, you're here!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 2 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' I was just thinking about you two, and now here you are. How fortuitous!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kaeya, did you do your homework?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 2 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' I'm afraid I must disappoint you... I haven't even started writing it yet.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 2 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hmm, students that don't hand in their homework on time aren't exactly model students now, are they?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And what excuse does Kaeya have for not handing in his homework?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 2 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Well, as you can see, I'm helping Master Jean take care of various matters.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 2 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Mondstadt is a hive of activity over the festive period. Accordingly, there's a multitude of things that need sorting. *sigh* I've been at it for a good while now.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 2 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Traveler... can I ask for a favor?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 2 kaeya 06.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' I have a drinking buddy that wants me to help him with something, but I'm much too busy. Can I entrust this matter to you?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 2 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' A drinking buddy? A friend you met at the tavern?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 2 kaeya 07.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' That's right. I often go to the tavern when not on duty. Somehow, I seem to have made quite a few acquaintances that way.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 2 kaeya 08.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' His name is Nimrod, he's never far from the tavern. He should be free right now.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 2 kaeya 09.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Thanks for the help. I'd better stay behind and get started on my homework.
:{{DIcon}} Good luck, Kaeya.
:{{DIcon}} I'll consider it part of my Windblume experience.

;(Talk to Kaeya again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh002 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Feel free to take your time... I need to channel my inner poet.
----
;(Upon finding Nimrod)
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 nimrod 01.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' *sigh* What should I do...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You must be Nimrod! Kaeya mentioned there was something you wanted him to take care of. He's busy right now, but we can help.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 nimrod 02.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' ...Huh? Oh, Traveler... I didn't realize it was you.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 nimrod 03.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' ...It's like this: I'm planning to give a gift to my wife for the Windblume Festival, and I wanted my drinking buddy, Kaeya, to come up with a gift idea.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 nimrod 04.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' ...I&mdash;I'm afraid I'm a bit of a drunkard, I'm nearly always in the tavern. My wife hates me drinking, so we're constantly arguing.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Another day, another drunkard...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I can empathize, I don't mind a drink or two myself! Then again, and I'm not one to judge, but by the looks of your drinking habits... hmm...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 nimrod 05.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' I know... She's right, of course. I feel like I have to make it up to her.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 nimrod 06.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' ...Traveler, can you help me gather some materials? I want to make a gift for her myself.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 nimrod 07.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' ...I should have made preparations in advance, but I've barely been sober these last few days. I fell asleep, and when I woke up the celebrations had already begun! Now I'll never have time to finish it by myself...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeesh, this guy is a mess...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' ...Single folks in Mondstadt would never dare get others to help them during the festive period. It's lucky you're already married, Nimrod.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 nimrod 08.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' Uh-huh... you're telling me... *sigh* I'm sorry... Here I am making a fool of myself in front of all of you.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* What's done is done. Spit it out then, how can we help?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 nimrod 09.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' I'm going to look for wood in the city, and we'll need plants to place inside. Those only grow in the wild, could I ask you to retrieve them? I need two stems of [[Small Lamp Grass]].
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Small Lamp Grass and wood... what are you making exactly?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 nimrod 10.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' I want to make her a little wooden house, with glowing flowers and handmade furniture inside...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Aww, such a thoughtful gift!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 nimrod 11.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' A token of my love, haha. ...Back when I'd only just gotten to know her, I used to make handmade gifts for her all the time... She love them, she even used to say that...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 nimrod 12.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' Oh! Uh &mdash; ahem, excuse me. Let's put the past aside for the moment. Thank you all for your help.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lucky you came across such kind-hearted assistants, hmm?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, let's go and find those materials!
----
;(Talk to Nimrod without enough Small Lamp Grass)
:{{A|vo dialog eqfh002 nimrod 01.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' ...I haven't done any carpentry for a long time now. I hope everything goes to plan!

;(Talk to Nimrod)
:{{A|vo eqfh002 4 nimrod 01.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' ...Thank you, thank you so much! With these materials, I can get to work straight away.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Remember, a gift can't solve everything! You need to start being fair to your wife, too!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 4 nimrod 02.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' I will, I will!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 4 nimrod 03.ogg}} '''Nimrod:''' *sigh* I do hope she likes my gift, though...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 4 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Everyone likes a gift given with love, don't worry.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Make it a good one! Don't go wasting those materials, they weren't easy to find y'know!
----
;(Talk to Kaeya)
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're back! Kaeya, have you finished?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Time to hand in your homework!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Welcome back, I'm just finishing up.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Go, go, go, hand it in, hand it in!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Alright, alright... Now then, no hurting my feelings.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hmmm.. Mm? Ooooh...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Tone-Deaf Bard, what grade did he get?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Kaeya, may I read this out loud?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Feel free.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' *clears throat*
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:'''
::"Mi muhe ye
::Means I love you
::In the language of the hilichurls."
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh? Ehh!?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' That's it.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's it!?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Coherent and too the point. Plus, the length seems about right.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!? Are you writing a Hilichurlian phrase book!?
:{{DIcon}} Ridiculous. Where's the romance?
:{{DIcon}} Nice work, you learned a lot, I see.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Hahaha, a love poem has to convey the style of its author, you know?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 venti 07.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I'm not sure you took the exercise seriously.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait... so we're just gonna gloss over the fact that Kaeya can speak Hilichurlian? Weird.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 kaeya 06.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Haha, don't underestimate the hidden knowledge of the Knights of Favonius' Cavalry Captain!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 venti 08.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Alright then, time to collect the next student's homework...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 kaeya 07.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' ...!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 kaeya 08.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' I just caught sight of a suspicious figure, I must go and investigate. Traveler, I have another small task for you.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 kaeya 09.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' The Church has applied to us for a hunting license. Please take these official documents to the Cathedral.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* Running errands again...!
----
;(Upon arriving at the location)
:{{A|vo eqfh002 6 qin 01.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Lisa, we need to establish some ground rules... If we do end up apprehending any drunken troublemakers, no electrocutions. Okay?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 6 lisa 01.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Oh Jean, you misunderstand me. That intoxicated fellow you witnessed last time was practically begging me to be shocked. It makes me wonder if some people don't actually quite enjoy getting&mdash;
:{{A|vo eqfh002 6 qin 02.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Lisa!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 6 lisa 02.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' *sigh* Very well then, if you insist.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Jean, Lisa!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 6 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Greetings, ladies! It's been a while.
:{{DIcon}} What are you two doing here?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 6 qin 03.ogg}} '''Jean:''' A while indeed. As you can see, Lisa and I are on duty.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 6 lisa 03a.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Aww, it's cutie and friends. Did you see any suspicious people on the way here? If you do see anything, report straight to the Knights.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Since when do librarians go out on patrol?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 6 lisa 04.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' Rarely, but this is the Windblume Festival, and they need all hands on deck. Even the humble clerical staff, like me.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 6 qin 04.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Lisa, "humble clerical staff" do not wield Electro the way you do.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 6 qin 05.ogg}} '''Jean:''' *sigh* Please do not be alarmed, I will keep my eyes on Lisa. Especially since she seems to enjoy electrocuting people just to break up a scuffle. Not to mention shocking drunkards until they beg for mercy...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 6 lisa 05.ogg}} '''Lisa:''' If you don't like it, I can happily refrain.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 6 qin 06.ogg}} '''Jean:''' Is that a promise? Good. Otherwise, I'm going to have to reconsider whether I want a librarian on patrol with me.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon never knew being on patrol could be so exciting!

;(Upon approaching Barbara)
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Barbara, Kaeya sent us to deliver the&mdash;
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 bennett 01.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' How dare they! This is sheer intimidation!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 barbara 01.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' How could somebody do this...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' What's happened?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 barbara 02.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' I... *sniff* I&mdash;I received a letter... *sniff* It says... I&mdash;It says...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 bennett 02.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Let me. I just came back from the wilderness. As usual, I came by the Cathedral to ask the sisters to patch me up. That's when I saw Barbara running out, white as a sheet. She was holding a letter.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 barbara 03.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' I've never received a letter like this before.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Can I take a look?
:: '''Watch Out!'''[[File:Watch Out!.png|thumb|Watch Out!]]
:: "Dear Barbara,
:: I've stolen the thing most precious to you and buried it."
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hm... "Dear Barbara, I've stolen the thing most precious to you and buried it." Huh... Could this be an attempt at intimidation?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 bennett 03.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' It's awful... is it a joke? If so, we don't need to worry. But...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 barbara 04.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' ...But... what if it's real...?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's a map on the back, isn't that out in the wilderness?[[File:Missive of Cloud and Fog Map.png|thumb|Map on the back]]
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 bennett 04.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Hmm... the thing most precious to you...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hm, buried...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 bennett 05.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Huh... that location on the map is familiar, I've definitely been there before.
:{{DIcon}} So what is the thing most precious to you?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 barbara 05.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' I can't think straight right now, nothing makes sense... *whimpers*
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 bennett 06.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' It's coming to me... It's coming to me...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 barbara 06.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' The thing most precious to me... W&mdash;Wait, could it be? Oh no!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Barbara! Hey! Slow down!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 bennett 07.ogg}} '''Bennett:''' Aha! I've got it! The Thousand Winds Temple!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Bennett &mdash; hey!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why are they in such a hurry? Let's catch up with them!
----
;(Upon leaving the Cathedral)
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 barbara 01.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' ...My sister!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 rosaria 01.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' Slow down.
:{{Introductory Note|character=Rosaria}}
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 barbara 02.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Rosaria! I just&mdash;
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 rosaria 02.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' Calm down.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 rosaria 03.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' I ran into Jean a moment ago, Lisa was with her. She's fine.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 barbara 03.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' *gasp* R&mdash;Really? A&mdash;Are you sure?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 barbara 04.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Whew...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 rosaria 04.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 rosaria 05.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' That letter. Give it to me.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Sure...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 barbara 05.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' ...If they're not talking about Jean in the letter... then what are they talking about?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Did you really think they'd buried Jean underground!? What a horrible thought!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' So, sister, have you found any leads?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 rosaria 06.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' Looking at the map, the perpetrator seems to have marked out an area around Dawn Winery.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 rosaria 07.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' That's open land, so hiding something there... Hmm, what could it be?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nice work! How'd you figure that out so quickly?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Although... Dawn Winery? That's not the place we were thinking...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 barbara 06.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 rosaria 08.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' Barbara, rather than letting your imagination get the better of you, stand up and face this head-on.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 barbara 07.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' ...You're right, it's just...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hehe, it's a little scary, right? That's why we're going with you. What do you say?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 barbara 08.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Uh? Th&mdash;That's very kind...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' And you, Sister? Will you be accompanying us?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 rosaria 09.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' No need... I knew straight away there was nothing to worry about.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh? And what does that mean?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 rosaria 10.ogg}} '''Rosaria:''' ...Nothing. Get going, then.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Barbara, are you feeling a bit better now?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 barbara 09.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Mm-hmm! I'm... I'm okay.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 barbara 10.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Rosaria is right, better to know the of the enemy than stand here scaring myself.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's right! Let's get moving!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 barbara 11.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Thank you, all of you. Let's get to the location and see what we find.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yup, yup! Go, Barbara, go!
----
;(Upon arriving at the location)
:{{A|vo eqfh002 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Why are there Treasure Hoarders here?

;(After defeating the Treasure Hoarders)
:{{A|vo eqfh002 10 barbara 01.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' It looks like there's something on the ground...

;(Dig up the box)
:{{A|vo eqfh002 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What is this? Hmm... quick, let's open it!
:{{A|vo eqfh002 11 barbara 01.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' I... I...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 11 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' ...Interesting... such an exquisite gift box. What's it doing out here in the wilderness?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 11 barbara 02.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' ...Huh!?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, what a beautiful Windwheel Aster Wreath! And so many paper stars!
:{{DIcon}} Is this a prank?
:{{DIcon}} Is this just someone's way of getting your attention?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 11 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hmm... looks like our "perpetrator" is really just one of Barbara's fans.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's a note! What does it say? Hmm, let's see...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "So sorry to get your attention this way. Please accept this Windblume as a sign of my sincere admiration for your virtue and sweetness."
:{{A|vo eqfh002 11 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? So it's... fraudulent intimidation, then?
:{{A|vo eqfh002 11 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Be it for the gods or that special someone, flowers should be offered in utmost sincerity. It's the most important ceremony of the Windblume Festival.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 11 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Flowers of love and blessing, sent on such a special occasion... No effort should be wasted to make it spectacular.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 11 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Behind the questionable methodology... here we have a meticulously thought-out and heartfelt gift.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 11 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Heh... laying it on a little thick, aren't we? Still seems like someone with a few screws loose to Paimon...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 11 venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hahaha, maybe you're right. I think I have a suspect in mind who fits that description...
:{{A|vo eqfh002 11 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who? Who?
:{{DIcon}} (I think I know the answer too.)
:{{A|vo eqfh002 11 venti 07.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Shh! No telling, now... I'd like Paimon to make a few guesses.
:{{A|vo eqfh002 11 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah!? You're so annoying!
