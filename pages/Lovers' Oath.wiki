==Trivia==
* The soundtrack's name may be a reference to the place where [[Xiao]] is usually found which is the top of [[Wangshu Inn]], where the player first meets him in the storyline. That area is a popular spot for lovers, hence the name.<ref>{{Ref/VP|Vigilant Guardians' Vantage Point}}</ref>
** The Chinese title {{zh|蒲苇如丝}} is an idiom roughly meaning that one's love will last forever. The term {{zh|蒲苇}} refers to a type of pampas grass, so the metaphor literally means the "grass is like silk."
* ''Lovers' Oath'' was featured in the rhythm game-based event [[Tuned to the World's Sounds]] from [[Version 2.2]]. During the event, the player is paired with the character [[Xiao]] for this song.
** The name "Lone Tower in the West" in Chinese is {{zh|独登西楼}}. A literal translation is "climbing the western tower alone" in which case the tower may refer to Xiao's home, the Wangshu Inn. Another possible reading is "climbing the stairway to the west alone."
* Before the soundtrack's release with its official title, many within the English-speaking fanbase referred to it as "[[Guizhong]]'s Lullaby." The fan name may have originated from a YouTube comment by user Teri who said: "I'm about to cry and I think I'm gonna call it Guizhong's lullaby." The [https://youtu.be/fLnqmI4B0XE video] commented on featured an unreleased variant of ''Lovers' Oath'' that included female vocals, and fans believed it was Guizhong singing. Despite many fan assumptions and the spread of the use of this fanmade title (mistaken as an official one), there is no official evidence nor record of this OST being related to Guizhong at all.
