{{Location Intro|description=<p>{{If Self|The Narzissenkreuz Ordo|It|The Narzissenkreuz Ordo}} is a hidden meeting chamber for the secret society of the [[Narzissenkreuz Ordo|same name]] housed at the top of the [[Tower of Ipsissimus]]. Embedded in the chamber's ceiling is a Doomsday Clock created by the mage [[Narzissenkreuz]] to count down the [[Prophecy of Fontaine|apocalypse]].</p>}}

The chamber can be accessed by selecting the prompt "Read" on a book at the end of the Institute of Natural Philosophy's Central Quartier. During {{Quest|Search in the Algae Sea (Quest)}}, a vent on the southwest side on the Tower of Ipsissimus' roof opens, providing another method to access the chamber. Inside the chamber is another book on a music stand that can be used to exit the instance. A second exit in the form of a large crack in the floor will become available during the aforementioned quest.

Interacting with the book in the Institute of Natural Philosophy for the first time to enter the chamber will reveal it on the world map, allowing it to be directly teleported to.

====Notes #1====
One Note can be found on the table directly below the large window after completing the World Quest ''Search in the Algae Sea''.
{{Readable|title=Notes
|text=<!--
-->"Io, Io, Pan! That which lies beneath the great sea!"<br><!--
-->The purpose of this line in the ritual scripture is to forsake the self and sink into the abyss, and in the abyss, to welcome rebirth as a holy infant.<br><!--
-->The origin of this is a tragedy of unknown provenance that has been passed down by persons unknown to this day. Said play is called "Ajax," or "Aias." He was the second-strongest warrior in his alliance.<br><br><!--
-->"Lies beneath the great sea" is, itself, an interesting phrase. It comes from ancient [[Sumeru]] texts, and should be read as "Narayana," which also means "primordial human."<br><!--
-->This, too, is my goal, for not all that comes from beyond may be as one that [[Descender|"descends."]] That title belongs only to wills that can rival an entire world.<br><!--
-->That is what I seek, the way to become just such a will, one that can protect the world, sustain the world, destroy the world, and create the world.}}

====Notes #2====
A second Note can be found in a pile of books next to the seat Caterpillar once sat in after completing the World Quest ''Search in the Algae Sea''.
{{Readable|title=Notes
|text=...To excise the self is not to die, but rather to die before death. That way, there is no life to be ended. Thus may one achieve eternity. This step is vital, for by this, may one avoid receiving a [[Vision]] by some error. To receive a Vision is to sell oneself to the "fate" of this world &mdash; to Heimarmene, and to evermore lose the chance to walk the correct path.}}

==Trivia==
* The Doomsday Clock mounted on the room's ceiling is most likely a reference to the real-world {{W|Doomsday Clock}}, which also uses "midnight" as a symbol of global catastrophe.
*The first note is a reference to Aleister Crowley's [https://www.luminist.org/archives/hymn_to_pan.htm Hymn to Pan]. Crowley was the founder of {{W|Thelema}}, a religious movement in history which likely inspired the Narzissenkreuz Ordo as a whole.
