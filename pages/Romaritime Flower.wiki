==Description==
{{Description|An ethereal and elegant blue flower. Its tender petals are elastic and water-absorbent, making it the ideal raw material for various daily necessities.<br>Romaritime Flower is said to represent loyalty and unswerving oaths.<br>In the folklore of Fontaine, Romaritime Flower is said to have been a Hydro spirit in love with [[Egeria]]. People base this story on the flower's trait to blossom upon contact with [[Hydro]]. On top of that, human beings' lack of knowledge and excessive desire to express themselves certainly have contributed to the tale, too.|[[Archive]]}}
