{{Location Intro|{{Lang|'''Qingce Village'''|zh=轻策庄|zh_rm=Qīngcè-zhuāng}}|description=<p>It is a tranquil village nestled at the foot of Mt. Qingce, with clear waters and terraced fields of flowers. Many of its younger residents have moved away in search of more exciting locales, so it has become known as a retirement spot for the elderly.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Secretary in a Sea of Humanity}}</ref></p><!--

--><p>Buildings in Qingce Village have a simple architectural style, and most are made of wood with blue roofs. The village is home to a community center where [[Granny Ruoxin]] can be found, the mill owned by [[Ms. Bai]], a tea shop owned by [[Pops Kai]], the [[Fanmu Carpenter]] shop owned by [[Master Lu]], and a market. The [[Qingce Village Bulletin Board]] is where advertisements and other postings by locals can be read.</p>}}

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hastily-Written Notes:''' "Day 4: No progress. No idea why the [[Yan'er|boss]] is so obsessed with this place."
:'''Hastily-Written Notes:''' "Day 7: Boss says she's had an idea, but so far it mostly seems to involve her waiting by the ruin... Don't ask me what for, because there's a great big [[Ruin Hunter]] guarding it, so there's no way she's getting in. Not quite sure how this counts as progress."

==Descriptions==
{{Description|Mighty Mt. Qingce gently cradles this peaceful village, silently protecting the old, the young, and the abundant croplands within its embrace. The legend of the [[Chi|ancient threat]] subdued beneath the mountain has been consigned to legend along with those who know of it, never again to return.|Viewpoint, [[A Home in the Hills]]}}
{{Description|At the northernmost point of Liyue, hidden between the hills and the bamboo forests sits Qingce Village.<br>White rolling clouds that sit in the valleys between the mountains are embellished with row upon row of crescent-moon water paddies.<br>When the wind blows, the ripples in the water give off an array of colors.|[https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/map Exploration], Genshin Impact Official Site}}
