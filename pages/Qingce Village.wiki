{{Description|Mighty Mt. Qingce gently cradles this peaceful village, silently protecting the old, the young, and the abundant croplands within its embrace. The legend of the [[Chi|ancient threat]] subdued beneath the mountain has been consigned to legend along with those who know of it, never again to return.|A Home in the Hills}}

*Hastily-Written Notes
**The following notes relate to "[[The Chi of Yore]]," but can be read outside of the quest as well.
{{Dialogue start}}
::'''Hastily-Written Notes:''' "Day 4: No progress. No idea why the [[Yan'er|boss]] is so obsessed with this place."
::'''Hastily-Written Notes:''' "Day 7: Boss says she's had an idea, but so far it mostly seems to involve her waiting by the ruin... Don't ask me what for, because there's a great big [[Ruin Hunter]] guarding it, so there's no way she's getting in. Not quite sure how this counts as progress."

==Puzzles==
===Statue Puzzle===
Located on the hill just slightly south of the [[Teleport Waypoint]] that is west of Qingce Village, this consists of several statues around the writing pedestal facing the cardinal directions.

"[[Rex Lapis]] overcame the Chi, but the Chi could not perish in its entirety. Thus did Rex Lapis conquer each of its facets in turn: its spirit was bound in the north, its bones were pinned in the south-east, its flesh was incarcerated in the north-west, and its form was crushed in the south-west..."

To complete this puzzle, referencing the writing pedestal as the centerpoint of a compass and using your minimap plus character-facing arrow as a reference to which way is North, activate the statues in the exact sequence described: north, south-east, north-west, north-east, south-west, to gain a [[Chest]].
