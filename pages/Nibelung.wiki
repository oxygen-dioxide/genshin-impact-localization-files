'''Nibelung''' was a historical figure in [[Teyvat]] who ruled the world before the arrival of humans. He introduced the [[Abyss]] to the world, and was killed in the [[Great War of Vengeance]] by the [[Heavenly Principles]].<ref name="Shape Self">{{Ref/Quest|What Shape Does the Self Hold}}</ref><ref name=Omen>{{Ref/Quest|An Omen of Annihilation and the Final Entreaty}}</ref>

==Appearance==
Nibelung is described as being gargantuan, and after sinking into the abyss, having great dark wings.<ref name=Once /><ref name=Revelations>{{Ref/Quest|Revelations from the Past|quote=You witness with your own eyes the gargantuan wings from beyond the world, the once glorious and grand figure now pitiable, having completely sunk into the terrifying shadow.}}</ref> However, [[Apep]] describes him as having scales that "shine bright," indicating he wasn't black-colored in the past.<ref name="Shape Self" />

The black dragon depicted in ''[[Revelations from the Past]]'' appears again in a mural in [[Ochkanatlan]], where it is instead depicted as white. This dragon is depicted as floating above the [[Aria, Sonnet and Canon|three moons]] and beyond the world of [[Teyvat]], further implying that Nibelung once had a brighter coloration.

==Story==
Nibelung was born alongside Tevyat. At one point in the distant past, he met a [[voyager]] who traversed the cosmos, and told him that the world would be destroyed and he should leave with her. However, he refused to abandon his people, and instead attempted to lead the dragons to the stars, leading them to develop advanced space technology.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|page=Deep Gallery's Distant Pact}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Domain|Ancient Watchtower}}</ref> As he is depicted in the mural ruling [[Chichen Uctokah]], it is possible that the space elevator project centering on it and [[Tonatiuh]] was originally spearheaded by Nibelung himself.<ref name=Omen />

When the Heavenly Principles descended on Teyvat and established a new order over the world, in an attempt to quell and defeat the usurper, Nibelung left Teyvat and returned with [[forbidden knowledge]] he acquired from the [[Abyss]] outside the world, leading the other ancient dragons into war against it, believing this power was the key to victory.<ref name="Shape Self" /><ref name= Omen />

Instead, this war caused immense destruction on an unprecedented scale and led the world to the brink of collapse. Nibelung's war eventually ended in his and [[Dragon|his race]]'s defeat, as well as his own demise. With the right to "shape the world," the Heavenly Principles cast down the [[Celestial Nail]]s to mend the earth after its destruction; however, this act also devastated the beings which had lived on the surface of Teyvat.<ref name=Omen /><ref name=Neuvision>{{Ref/CS|Neuvillette|Vision}}</ref>

===Legacy===
Even after seeing the former rainforests in her domain turn into desert through the power of the Celestial Nail, [[Apep]] attempted to turn the tides by acquiring more forbidden knowledge, but ultimately failed and became corrupted by the power she had sought.<ref name="Shape Self" /> 

Another surviving Sovereign, [[Xiuhcoatl]], was also corrupted by the Abyss, and to fight it, he resolved to turn all matter in his territory and eventually Teyvat into pure information using [[Huitzilopochtli]].<ref name=Omen />

[[Neuvillette]] believes that Nibelung was wrong, and that humans and dragons together are necessary to defeat the Abyss.<ref name=Neuvision />

While reminiscing on her motivations for making a deal with [[King Deshret]], Apep says that "At that time, I still harbored deep regrets. By the time the Dragon King returned, the world had irrevocably changed."<ref name="Shape Self" /> This may suggest that a new Dragon King was born before Apep made the deal with Deshret.

==Trivia==
* [[Kukulkan]] describes Nibelung as having "descended from beyond the circles of the world" when he returned.<ref name=Omen /> This description is identical to [[Rene]]'s text describing [[Descenders]] as "one who descends,"<ref name="Rene Notes1">Interactable, The Narzissenkreuz Ordo: [[The Narzissenkreuz Ordo#Notes #1|Notes #1]]</ref> making Nibelung a likely candidate for one of the two unidentified Descenders beyond the [[Heavenly Principles]] and the [[Traveler]].
* Nibelung is speculated to be the [[Second Who Came]], considering the similarities in the descriptions of the Second Who Came's War and Nibelung's War of Vengeance, as both wrought massive havoc that threatened to destroy the world itself, later requiring the Celestial Nails to mend, grievously wounded the Heavenly Principles, and led to the destruction of the [[Seelie|Angel]] race.<ref name="Shape Self" /><ref>{{Ref/CS|Neuvillette|Vision}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Beneath the Secret Source}}</ref>

===Etymology===
* The Germanic term {{w|Nibelung}} has several, sometimes conflicting, uses in Norse and Germanic myth, and its exact etymology is unknown. The popular theory is that it is derived from {{De|''{{wt|nibel}}''|tl=mist, cloud}} and that the word was often used for, or may have originally meant, mystical beings. The term ''Nibelung'' in legend has usually referred to either a group of humans or a group of dwarves.
** The term Nibelung in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' is likely derived from Richard Wagner's four-part opera {{De|''{{w|Der Ring des Nibelungen}}''|tl=The Ring of the Nibelung}} (which is based on various Germanic and Norse legends and {{W|Nibelungenlied|sagas}}), in which the dwarf (or Nibelung) Alberich creates a ring capable of controlling the world, using gold he stole from the Rhinemaidens (or {{De|Rheintöchter|Rhine-daughters}}). The conflict that arises over the ownership of this ring eventually leads to the destruction of the gods and their home, Valhalla.
*** The [[Alberich Clan]] and "Gold" [[Rhinedottir]] are other names directly taken from ''Der Ring des Nibelungen''. Notably, both the Alberich Clan and Rhinedottir played a prominent role during the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago, in which a resurgence of [[Abyss]]al power and forbidden knowledge came from [[Khaenri'ah]], resulting in its destruction at the hands of the Heavenly Principles and the gods.
