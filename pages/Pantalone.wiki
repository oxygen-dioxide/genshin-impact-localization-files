'''Pantalone''', also known by his codename "'''Regrator''',"<ref name="lazzo video description" /> is the Ninth of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]].<ref name="yelan cs">{{Ref/CS|Yelan|The Fascinating Bracelet and the Whitesilk Mantle}}</ref>

He makes his first appearance during ''[https://youtu.be/TmaAOV4SJNQ Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo]'' alongside his fellow Harbingers.

==Profile==
{{Quote|We shall, by whatever means necessary, become the heart that pumps money around the world. And, when the moment comes, that heart shall cease beating by our will alone.|Pantalone|[[Moment of Cessation]]}}
Pantalone was born into poverty and was never able to receive a [[Vision]]. This made him question why [[gods]] held dominion over so many aspects of life and gave him a deep desire to obtain wealth for himself.<ref name="cessation" />

Pantalone is currently in charge of [[Snezhnaya]]'s economic policies<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Andrei}}</ref> and is the wealthiest of all the Harbingers. [[Tartaglia]] describes him as extremely ambitious. He has a unique understanding of wealth and his agenda revolves around making Snezhnaya the "heart that pumps money around the world."<ref name="cessation">{{Ref/Arti|Moment of Cessation}}</ref><ref name="yelan sq">{{Ref/Quest|Foregone Conclusion}}</ref> It is not clear why he wants to do this, but [[Scaramouche]] suggests that it has something to do with his idea of "fair exchange," which aims to reverse the natural imbalance between gods and humans.<ref name="Wanderer VO">{{Ref/VO|Wanderer|About Regrator}}</ref>

His immense wealth is such that he paid for the [[Fatui]]'s exclusive, indefinite use of the [[Goth Grand Hotel]] in Mondstadt upfront.<ref name="goth">{{Ref/NPC|Goth}}</ref> When [[Bao'er]] saw the kinds of business transactions [[Landa]] was making on Pantalone's behalf, she warns the [[Traveler]] against trying to find out more about it.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Big Business}}</ref> Pantalone is also partnered with [[Il Dottore|The Doctor]], and the two of them work closely together.<ref name="Wanderer VO" />

==Story==
While Pantalone has not made an in-person appearance, he has influenced the Fatui's affairs in both Mondstadt and [[Liyue]]. Sometime before the [[Traveler]] arrived in Mondstadt, Pantalone booked the entire Goth Grand Hotel for the Fatui's exclusive use; while [[Goth]] was opposed to it due to the Goth family's motto of serving the people of Mondstadt, Pantalone paid for the entire intended duration upfront with an "unbelievably generous" offer.<ref name="goth" />

[[Landa]]'s voiced idle quote reveals he is an agent of Pantalone's, and the big business deal he almost lost in the World Quest ''[[Big Business]]'' was likely something Pantalone was personally involved in. Landa may also be the Snezhnayan agent sent to Mondstadt to ruin its wine industry under the guise of being a Snezhnayan merchant, who ultimately fled after witnessing [[Noelle]]'s overly-dutiful nature.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Noelle|2}}</ref>

During a certain operation, Yelan lost one of her Fascinating Bracelets, magical devices passed down in her clan. To make up for her loss, she infiltrated Pantalone's secret trade route and got ahold of a highly valuable robe made with a powerful beast's fur, which he had intended as a gift to the [[Tsaritsa]]. She has since used the beast's fur to create the white mantle she currently wears.<ref name="yelan cs" />

During the events of Yelan's Story Quest ''[[Calculated Gambit]]'', the Fatui plotted to assassinate [[Uncle Tian]] and interfere with the election of the new Tianshu in order to control one of the members of the [[Liyue Qixing]]. Though the plan ended in failure, Pantalone managed to predict Yelan's next move in time to prevent [[Theofan]] from becoming her pawn and subsequently, a potential danger to the Fatui.<ref name="yelan sq" />

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* Like the other Harbingers, Pantalone's alias is derived from a stock character in ''{{w|commedia dell'arte}}'', a type of Italian theater which uses masks to designate their character's role in the story.
** "{{w|Pantalone}}" is greedy and uses his high social standing to push others around and interfere with their business. Oftentimes, he is the father of one of the Innamorati and tries to keep the two lovers apart. In other versions, he is married to La Signora.
** The literal meaning of "Pantalone" in Italian is "Pants."
*A ''{{wt|regrator||English}}'' (or ''regrater'') is a person who purchases goods from a market, then resells that item in the same (or nearby) market at an inflated price.
