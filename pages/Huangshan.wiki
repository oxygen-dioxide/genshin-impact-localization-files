==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Huangshan:''' Spare me the pleasantries; what is it you want?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Huangshan:''' I'm a guard for hire. I escort goods safely from A to B. Not to boast, but in all my time doing it I've never slipped up.
::{{DIcon}} Might I ask your name?
:::'''Huangshan:''' Haha, I forgot to say my name.
:::'''Huangshan:''' It's Huangshan.
:::'''Huangshan:''' I'm pretty well known on the merchants' route between Mondstadt and Liyue. I'm thorough in my work, and people so say.
:::{{DIcon}} What about the rumors on the road?
:::'''Huangshan:''' A [[Dvalin|dragon]] attacked Mondstadt the other day, so I'm taking a temporary break.
:::'''Huangshan:''' I can deal with monsters, beasts and bandits no problem, but I'm not trying my luck against no dragon.
:::'''Huangshan:''' Speaking of rumors, this is where the rumors of two nations meet. I'm told the staff here are all informers for the Qixing.
:::'''Huangshan:''' The look on your face suggests you took that seriously. Ahahaha...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} About guards-for-hire...
:::'''Huangshan:''' You just need to know that it's a term specific to Liyue that refers to mercenaries who specialize in protecting cargo.
:::'''Huangshan:''' Well, the people of Liyue prize mercantilism, and traveling merchants must go far abroad. Our job is to protect them from bandits who would rob them of their goods.
:::'''Huangshan:''' I've accumulated a lot of experience from my years working in this field for &mdash; and I don't mind sharing.
::;(Obtain [[Adventurer's Experience]] ×3)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Huangshan:''' Bye. I sense a certain confidence in you; we should team up some time.
