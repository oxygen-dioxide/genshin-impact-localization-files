===Amber===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Amber at the [[Mementos of Teyvat#"A Legendary Beginning"|"A Legendary Beginning"]] photo-spot)
:'''Amber:''' Hey, it's you, {{Traveler}}! Fancy meeting you in the Whispering Woods again. What are the odds?
:'''Amber:''' It's been a while, hasn't it? What've you been busy with lately?
:{{DIcon}} Taking photos to keep a record of the places we've been.
:{{DIcon}} Taking photos to commemorate my legendary career with.
:'''Amber:''' Haha, that makes sense! This place is so beautiful and serene, it really does make for good photos.
:'''Amber:''' This is my favorite patrol segment when I'm out on scouting missions.
:'''Amber:''' This was where we met for the first time, too. I even mistook you for some kind of suspicious character back then, too! Ah, I'm getting embarrassed just thinking about it...
:'''Amber:''' After all, it was thanks to your help that we averted the crisis with Dvalin, and restored peace to Mondstadt.
:'''Amber:''' But your {{MC|m=sister|f=brother}}... I put up so many missing posters, but it seems like it wasn't of any help...
:{{DIcon}} It's fine, Amber.
:{{DIcon}} You did all you could.
:'''Amber:''' Thanks. But still, please feel free to tell me if there's anything I can help you with.
:'''Amber:''' Amber, Outrider of the Knights of Favonius, Mondstadt's Gliding Champion, and your friend &mdash; at your service!
:{{DIcon}} In that case, step into the frame, please!

===Xiangling===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Xiangling at the [[Mementos of Teyvat#"Somewhere You'd Want to Go When You're Hungry..."|"Somewhere You'd Want to Go When You're Hungry..."]] photo-spot)
:'''Xiangling:''' {{Traveler}}, it's you! Long time no see! Funny, I just mentioned you to Guoba yesterday, and here we are.
:{{Introductory Note|Xiangling}}
:'''Xiangling:''' I guess that's what they call "fate," huh?
:'''Xiangling:''' Ah, right. Where are you headed?
:{{DIcon}} I was going to take a picture of this bridge.
:{{DIcon}} I'm looking for people to take photos with.
:'''Xiangling:''' Photo-taking? Ooh, that's a coincidence. I've taken an interest in that lately myself.
:'''Xiangling:''' We've been using the same poster at the restaurant for so long. It's high time we got a new one.
:'''Xiangling:''' I've been thinking that we could draw passersby in more easily with some beautiful shots of our dishes.
:'''Xiangling:''' As the old saying goes: "A fine meal is three parts color, three parts aroma, three parts taste, and one part advertising."
:'''Xiangling:''' ...Of course, I added that last bit myself.
:'''Xiangling:''' Dad always talks about the first three &mdash; it's as common culinary wisdom as can be.
:{{DIcon}} Hardworking as always, huh, Xiangling?
::'''Xiangling:''' Hehe. Thanks!
:{{DIcon}} Things haven't been too tiring, have they, Xiangling?
::'''Xiangling:''' No way &mdash; if anything, my motivation grows the more I do things I enjoy.
:'''Xiangling:''' Finding rare ingredients, creating new dishes, learning how to advertise... I've still got a long way to go in my culinary journey.
:'''Xiangling:''' Haha, now that you mention it, it's been a long time since our first meeting, hasn't it?
:'''Xiangling:''' But many things have stayed the same, too, haven't they? You're still traveling, and I'm still coming up with new dishes.
:'''Xiangling:''' It's my goal not only to keep Wanmin Restaurant open, but to make it better and better.
:'''Xiangling:''' So long as I've got strength in my arms, I'll be stir-frying and wok-tossing even when I'm an old granny, delivering delicious, piping hot dishes from pot to plate.
:'''Xiangling:''' Remember to stop by for a meal more often, alright?
:{{DIcon}} I will.
::'''Xiangling:''' Alright then, it's a deal!
:{{DIcon}} We'll see.
::'''Xiangling:''' Haha, are you worried that you won't be able to walk over by then?
::'''Xiangling:''' If that's the case, just write to me &mdash; I'll send you some food that keeps easily.
:'''Xiangling:''' Ah, right, I'm kinda getting off-topic here. You were talking about taking some pictures, right? Need any help?
:{{DIcon}} Yup. Step into the frame, please!
;(If [[Paimon's Kamera]] is not the active gadget)
::'''Xiangling:''' That's a great idea! I've been studying some photography lately myself... By the way, did you bring your Kamera? I don't see it...

::{{DIcon}} A fun pose.
::;(Xiangling leans forward with her Expectant [[Photo Mode#Expressions|expression]])
::{{DIcon}} A joyful pose.

===Kaedehara Kazuha===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Kaedehara Kazuha at the [[Mementos of Teyvat#"Looking Down on the World Below"|"Looking Down on the World Below"]] photo-spot)
:'''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' The [[Fortune Slip]] I received at the [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Subarea)|Grand Narukami Shrine]] stated that Great Fortune shall be with me and that I should expect a reunion.
:'''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' It seems the reunion was to be with you. It's been a while, {{Traveler}}.
:{{DIcon}} We're here to take pictures of Inazuma City.
:{{DIcon}} We're looking for people to take photos with.
:'''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Ah, an elegant pursuit. To take pictures of scenery one has witnessed is to remind oneself of one's journey thus far.
:{{DIcon}} What about you, Kazuha?
:'''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I have presently made plans to meet Mr. {{sic|[[Nakanishi|Nakatsuki]]}}<ref group="Note">This name in the original Chinese version is {{zh|中西}}, the same as the NPC Nakanishi's name.</ref> at the teahouse to discuss the art of the tea ceremony. He is well-versed in the relevant disciplines, and is a regular there.
:{{DIcon}} Are you an expert too?
:'''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I studied for a time in my youth, but my knowledge then was quite shallow. I have found it all the more fascinating while revisiting it for study as of late.
:'''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' For example, the nations differ in their manifestations of said ceremonies. For Inazuma, we emphasize the spirit of "purity" and "tranquility."
:'''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Liyue's [[Qiaoying Village]] also produces tea, and the people of that land lean towards "harmony" and "authenticity."
:'''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' These differences also reflect the two people's differences in living habits. Most fascinating.
:{{DIcon}} You're a real lover of learning.
:{{DIcon}} A man of elegant tastes, I see.
:'''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Haha, hardly... In truth, I did not return here solely for that.
:'''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' This is the land of my birth, and so it remains, though I was once compelled to leave.
:'''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Returning every once in a while, seeing people I knew in my youth, spending time in familiar places...
:'''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I feel as if I still have roots here, which relieves the cares of my wanderings.
:'''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' To use Kameras to immortalize such memories is a wonderful idea. We wanderers need our anchors more than anyone, after all.
:'''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Anyway, that's quite enough about me. I don't wish to take up your time, but if you need any aid, simply say the word.
:{{DIcon}} Alright. Step into the frame, then, if you would!
;(If [[Paimon's Kamera]] is not the active gadget)
::'''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I think you're saying you want to use a Kamera to take photos, but I don't see yours anywhere. Are you sure you brought one?
:;(Dialogue ends)
:;(The message "Equip Paimon's Kamera first" appears)
;(If Paimon's Kamera is the active gadget)
::'''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Easily done. What sort of pose would be best for the shot?
::{{DIcon}} One that's more casual.
::;(Kazuha performs the [[Photo Mode#Poses|Alpha Pose]]<!-- this is also his Talent menu pose but with the default expression instead of the usual one-hand-on-hip Talent menu expression (some have the default neutral expression but most, including Kazuha, don't have the default neutral expression) -->)
::{{DIcon}} A relaxed pose.
::;(Kazuha crosses his arms with his Smiley expression)
::{{DIcon}} Perhaps one displaying deep thought.
::;(Kazuha performs the Thinking pose with his Pensive expression)
::'''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Of course. How does this look?
::{{DIcon|Mementos of Teyvat}} Perfect. Say cheese!
:::'''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I'm ready.

::;(Kazuha performs the corresponding pose)

===Collei===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Collei, optional)
:'''Collei:''' Today's reading class is over, so first, I'll need to review what I learned last week when I get back. Then, I'll organize everything from today into my notebook...
:'''Collei:''' But there's so much... I'm not sure if I can even finish tonight...
:'''Collei:''' No, no! One step at a time. I'll just focus on organizing my notes first.

;(Approach Collei at the [[Mementos of Teyvat#"Data, Dissertations, and Examinations"|"Data, Dissertations, and Examinations"]] photo-spot)
:'''Collei:''' Huh? Oh, it's you, {{Traveler}}! What's the plan today?
:{{DIcon}} We're here to take some pictures of Sumeru City.
:{{DIcon}} We're looking for people to take photos with.
:'''Collei:''' Ah, photography! True, Akademiya researchers often come here to snap a few shots of the city.
:'''Collei:''' Most who do are from [[Vahumana]] and [[Kshahrewar]], apparently to study urban infrastructure... and um, architectural history or something like that.
:{{DIcon}} Well, aren't you familiar with the Darshans?
::'''Collei:''' Not... really. I just know about their research fields and how they set their courses up. I'm still a long way from being a real scholar, though.
:{{DIcon}} Take any classes in those Darshans, by any chance?
::'''Collei:''' Well, I'm not a student yet, so I can't attend the classes, but Master has introduced some of the basics of their research to me.
:'''Collei:''' But if you wanted me to take the selection exam... Heh, I doubt I'd pass even the first round of the written test.
:'''Collei:''' I wish I could reach the level of a researcher, of course, but it's still a dream at the moment...
:{{DIcon}} You'll make it someday.
:{{DIcon}} You can do it, Collei!
:'''Collei:''' Thanks so much, {{Traveler}}. Anyway, I'll do my best to learn the basics first!
:'''Collei:''' Honestly, I'm just happy to learn something new every day.
:'''Collei:''' And right now, my goal is to be the best Forest Ranger I can be.
:'''Collei:''' Guiding those who've gotten lost in the rainforest, helping people who've accidentally ingested poison, protecting the rainforest flora and fauna...
:'''Collei:''' We Forest Rangers do lots of things. Everyone needs me, and I'm more than willing to help!
:'''Collei:''' I've only done a couple of little things here and there, but still, everyone recognizes my work.
:'''Collei:''' Guess I'm lucky to have all these people who care about me... and to have made friends with someone as amazing as you.
:{{DIcon}} I'm glad that we're friends, Collei.
:{{DIcon}} We're both amazing. Don't you forget that!
:'''Collei:''' Haha, alright. Anyway, if there's anything I can help you with, just let me know.
:{{DIcon}} I'd like you to help me with some photos.
;(If [[Paimon's Kamera]] is not the active gadget)

:'''Lynette:''' ...So you did come over. I was wondering if you'd notice me. Looks like my concealment failed this time.
:{{Introductory Note|Lynette}}
:'''Lynette:''' Oh well. I didn't put much effort into it anyway. One moment... {{Traveler}} Observation Mode, off. Chat Mode activated.
:'''Lynette:''' Previous observation indicates that you are more likely to be enjoying the scenery than just wandering about. Are you here on business?
:{{DIcon}} We're looking for a good spot for a picture.
:{{DIcon}} I'm looking for someone to help with some photos.
:'''Lynette:''' Photos... Have you finally decided to end your travels and work at [[The Steambird]]?
:'''Lynette:''' Understandable. An adventurer's income is unstable, and you have Paimon to feed as well &mdash; that can't be easy.
:{{DIcon}} Aye, but they're real slave drivers. Six days of work, one day off.
::'''Lynette:''' You followed up with a joke of your own. Wow. I underestimated you.
:{{DIcon}} No, no, I'm a loyal member of the Adventurers' Guild!
::'''Lynette:''' Hmm. I didn't expect you to be so earnest about the Guild. My apologies for the joke. I did not mean to doubt your adventurous spirit.
:'''Lynette:''' If you've come here to take pictures, they must be of the Court of Fontaine.
:{{DIcon}} Sharp as always, Lynette.
:'''Lynette:''' Many Steambird reporters come here to take panoramic shots of the Court, and sometimes they gossip on the side.
:'''Lynette:''' All I need to do is keep a low profile and listen silently.
:'''Lynette:''' But having come so many times, I've picked up some photography skills along the way... So, do you require an assistant?

:'''Paimon:''' Over here, {{Traveler}}, over here!
:'''Paimon:''' Remember this place? It's where our journey began.
:'''Paimon:''' We've been to so many places since then! Time really flies, huh... Just thinking about it makes Paimon kinda emotional. Ooh, she could write a poem right now!
:{{DIcon}} Please, go right ahead, O great bard Paimon~
:{{DIcon}} Pfft.
::'''Paimon:''' Oh, don't interrupt. Let Paimon think...
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, vast Teyvat!
:'''Paimon:''' How far have we traveled, yet not seen your full breadth!
:{{DIcon}} (Remain silent.)
:{{DIcon}} That didn't rhyme at all.
:'''Paimon:''' Ah! Ah... Huh, and the thought's gone.
:{{DIcon}} Hahahaha!
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, yeah, laugh it up. Paimon's used to it by now.
:{{DIcon}} Do you mean to reflect on how tough this journey's been?
::'''Paimon:''' That's right! Hehe, you sure know Paimon well.
:'''Paimon:''' But seriously, it's easy to forget where we started after all this traveling.
:'''Paimon:''' For example, Paimon can't quite remember what Sweet Madames taste like nowadays, and that was one of her favorite dishes, too...
:'''Paimon:''' That's why Paimon bought this album in the first place, to take pictures of the places we've been and the people we've met.
:'''Paimon:''' "The end is close once we get back to where we started." That happens pretty often in light novels and films, doesn't it?
:'''Paimon:''' That's why we're taking a picture here. Not to feel all sad and stuff, but 'cause we hope to always remember the road we've taken, all the better to tread the road ahead...
:{{DIcon}} Have you been eavesdropping on my conversations with Kazuha?
:{{DIcon}} What? Paimon is evolving!
::'''Paimon:''' Well... Yeah, Paimon was listening when you and Kazuha were chatting.
:'''Paimon:''' C'mon, we were trying to create an atmosphere here &mdash; and now it's all gone.
:{{DIcon}} Don't worry, I understand what you mean.
::{{DIcon}} We'll forge ahead.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, sure, as long as you get it.
:'''Paimon:''' Alright! Your model for this picture is going to be Teyvat's number one guide! So, what pose would you like to go for?
;(If [[Paimon's Kamera]] is not the active gadget)
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, wait a moment. Where's the Kamera Paimon lent you? Let's check real quick &mdash; you'd better not have lost it!
:;(Dialogue ends)
:;(The message "Equip Paimon's Kamera first" appears)
;(If Paimon's Kamera is the active gadget)
:;(Continue to pose selection)

;(Talk to Paimon again while Paimon's Kamera is not the active gadget)
:'''Paimon:''' How did the photos turn out?
:{{DIcon|Mementos of Teyvat}} I'd like to try a different pose out.
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah, sure, but we can't do that without holding a Kamera, can we?
:;(Dialogue ends)
:;(The message "Equip Paimon's Kamera first" appears)
:{{DIcon}} You did great. Thanks a lot.

;(Talk to Paimon again while Paimon's Kamera is the active gadget)

:{{DIcon|Mementos of Teyvat}} I'd like to try a different pose out.
::'''Paimon:''' Sure. What would you like me to go with?
:;(Continue to pose selection)
:{{DIcon}} I'm not quite ready yet.
:;(Dialogue ends)

;(Pose selection)
:{{DIcon}} Let's go with a fun pose!
:{{DIcon}} Let's have a natural pose.
:{{DIcon}} Just take up a casual pose.
:'''Paimon:''' Yup yup! How's this?
:{{DIcon|Mementos of Teyvat}} Awesome. Say cheese!
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon's ready!
:;(Dialogue ends, opens event Photo Mode interface)
:{{DIcon}} The fun pose might work better.
::'''Paimon:''' Alrighty then!
:{{DIcon}} Let's roll with the natural pose instead.
::'''Paimon:''' No problemo!
:{{DIcon}} Let's go with a casual posture instead.
::'''Paimon:''' Sure!
