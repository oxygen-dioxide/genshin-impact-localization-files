==Text==
'''Letter From Guuji Yae'''<br>
I haven't seen or heard from you in quite some time, little one. Don't tell me you've forgotten all about your Lady [[Yae Miko]], and gone off and found yourself a new shrine maiden somewhere else?<br>
That wouldn't do at all &mdash; for one thing, it would break my poor little heart. But surely, a kind and gentle soul such as you couldn't bear to see me that way, would you?<br>
Tell you what, let's meet at [[Tenshukaku]]. I've already had a word with the [[Okuzumeshuu]] at the entrance to let you in, so don't even think about turning me down.<br>
Relax, you're not in trouble. In fact, you're in for quite a treat. Hehe...
