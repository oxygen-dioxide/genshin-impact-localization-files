==Description==
"...I've been thinking this over for a long time, and I feel I should tell him the truth. [[Timmie]] is growing up, and I can't keep it from him forever. The longer I keep it from him, the harder it will be for him to accept."<br />"Nevertheless, this is just my suggestion, since you are the one who has been taking care of Timmie. Please do let me know your thoughts on the matter."<br />"Finally, please say hi to Timmie for me. I'll come visit in a few days."
