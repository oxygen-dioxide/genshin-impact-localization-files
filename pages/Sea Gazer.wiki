'''Sea Gazer''' was an [[adeptus]] who lived in [[Liyue]], but died long before the events of the game.

Sea Gazer was very close with [[Mountain Shaper]] while he was alive. [[Shenhe]] learned from the adepti that Sea Gazer was a very open-minded individual, an attribute that [[Xingqiu]] notes was not mentioned in any historical records of the adeptus.<ref name="interlude">{{Ref/Quest|Seagaze Sunset}}</ref>

He was the creator of the [[Fantastic Compass]], a magical device used to seal away evil monsters. He eventually became friends with a mortal, and gave him the device to aid him in battle, working together to exorcise demons with the compass.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/C24nvloZZhE Perilous Trail Event Cutscene Animation: "Moment of Life or Death"] (video description)</ref>

[[Sea Gazer's Abode]] is in [[Lisha]] and contains "his rarest and most exquisite treasures," including a massive chunk of [[Sunset Vermillionite]].<ref name="interlude" /> At the end of the domain, the [[Seelie]] that the [[Traveler]], [[Paimon]], and Shenhe follow comes to rest alongside another Seelie that has already been settled in its Seelie Court; however, no details are given as to whom the Seelie may represent.
