'''Wind-Blessed Harpastum''' is a gadget obtained during the [[Midsummer Island Adventure]] [[Event]] by finishing the ''[[Summer Vacation: Proceed With Caution]]'' or ''[[Summer Gift]]'' Event [[World Quest]].

It can also be bought from [[Marjorie]] in [[Mondstadt]] for {{Item|Mora|20|x=150,000}} if players missed the event.

==Usage==
The Wind-Blessed Harpastum must be equipped at the Inventory before using, once this is done, players may tap its corresponding button to use it. The item acts as a skill and will replace the prompt used for the character's [[Elemental Skill]]. There is a 2-second cooldown for equipping/unequipping it, and changing characters will automatically revert to the Elemental Skill.

By tapping the Elemental Skill button, a ball will be thrown directly in front of the player with no motion done by the character. By holding the same button, an aiming mode will commence where players may choose exactly where the ball will be thrown. To throw the ball, simply let go of the button. Doing any other action during the aiming mode (attack, jump, sprint) will cancel it. After the ball is thrown with the aiming mode, the camera will default back to the front of the character.

Throwing the ball at enemies deal no damage and will not stun them. It has a 1.5 second cooldown between throws. Players do not need to stand still to throw it, except while aiming.

By entering a Painted Ground, a new command will be available. Tapping the "attack" button will now perform a move where the ball can be redirected back, which can also be done during the aiming mode or while moving around. The character will not perform any motion during this move as well.

It cannot be used in [[Domains]] nor inside the [[Serenitea Pot]].
