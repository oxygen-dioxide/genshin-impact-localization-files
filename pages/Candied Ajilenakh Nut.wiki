|description     = A rich dessert.
|desc_suspicious = The hard nut is almost like a stone lying hidden in the sand, waiting to strike. Sweetness brings happiness, yes, but the feeling of the hard bits stuck between your teeth rather ruins it by half.
|desc_basic      = First, the syrup is boiled till clear, then mixed with fillings and sesame paste from Sumeru. Then at last, the evenly-mixed syrup is poured into a mold and allowed to solidify into this crunchy form. It is said that the cold lands of Snezhnaya are a host to a similar dish, with a slightly different flavor profile. Of course, both sides naturally believe theirs to be the greatest in all Teyvat.
|desc_delicious  = The syrup itself melts upon contact with your mouth, revealing the nut like a gem swathed in velvet, layer leading on to layer of joy. One small bite, and it is as if you are soaked in a tub of silken sweetness. Why, you really, really must make a few pieces more next time!
