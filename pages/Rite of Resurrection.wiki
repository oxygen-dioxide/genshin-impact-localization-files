|ja_note = It can be a reference to the ''yojijukugo'' (idiomatic compound) 起死回生 (''Kishi Kaisei'') which means "revival from the brink of death, recovering from a hopeless situation, resuscitation, revitalisation). However, the last kanji, which means "life", has been replaced with 骸, which means "corpse".
