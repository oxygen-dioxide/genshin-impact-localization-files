[[Lyney]] and [[Freminet]]'s sleeves were stained with different colored inks at breakfast today, and their shoes had bits of colored paper on them. I can deduce they were the ones "secretly" setting up the venue last night.

My task is to keep the secret and pretend I didn't see a thing.

"Hahaha." But I plan to laugh one more time than usual. That should be enough. Even without a word, Lyney can always read my mood. It suits me better to just make tea and enter Standby Mode.

Everyone in the family has their own special cup, and I've prepared one for you too. Let's see if you like it.
