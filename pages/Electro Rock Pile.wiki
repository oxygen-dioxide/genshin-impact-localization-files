'''Electro Rock Piles''' are [[Rock Pile]]s found in [[Inazuma]]. Unlike Rock Piles from the rest of [[Teyvat]], they are {{Electro}} objects and react to certain [[Elemental Reactions]].

They can be destroyed with [[Overloaded]], [[Superconduct]], [[Crystallize]] or [[Swirl]] reactions by attacking them with {{Pyro}}, {{Cryo}}, {{Geo}} or {{Anemo}}, respectively.

They will appear {{Color|Electro|purple}} under the use of [[Elemental Sight]].

==Shield Gauge==
{{See also|Shields/Shield Gauge Data}}
The Electro Rock Pile will require 2 [[gauge unit]]s to break, and {{Hydro}} does not affect it (Hydro will have a modified reaction coefficient of 0). Similarly, {{Electro}} and {{Color|Physical}} DMG will not affect it.

==Trivia==
* As expected, triggering [[Swirl]] on an Electro Rock Pile near a body of [[water]] will spread Electro to the water, causing the water to become [[Electro-Charged]].
