==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Pahua:''' Pick the right equipment and work smarter, not harder. 
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Pahua knows)
:::'''Pahua:''' Let me think... Hmm, now that I think about it, when the volcano erupted before, it ejected a bunch of hard Magical Crystal Ore from deep within the earth.
:::'''Pahua:''' I'll mark the location on your map and you can check it out if you're interested. As far as you're concerned, I imagine digging up minerals counts as a productive training session.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Pahua knows)
:::'''Pahua:''' Let me think... Hmm, I don't suppose there's anything you'll find particularly interesting, but you know what they say, "rest of where the gains are made" &mdash; sometimes it's good just to relax.
:{{DIcon}} What are you selling?
::'''Pahua:''' Training equipment.
::'''Pahua:''' But... looking at you, I think you're well past needing such entry-level gear.
::{{DIcon}} What do you mean?
::'''Pahua:''' Exactly what I said. I'm a fitness coach too, and I've got an eye for my customers' skill levels and needs.
::'''Pahua:''' I can only recommend equipment that I think will help, and you strike me as being a cut above the average fitness fanatic, am I right? Nothing I have here is going to challenge you enough.
::'''Pahua:''' However, if you're looking to buy something for a friend, maybe I can help. Just fill me in on their physical condition they're in{{sic}}, and I'll do the rest.
:{{DIcon}} See you, then.
::'''Pahua:''' Okay, goodbye.
