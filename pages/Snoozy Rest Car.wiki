|description    = A model of a toy train car that is both spacious and comfortable, with a warm, inviting yellow theme. It is a scale reproduction of one of the cars of the [[Maritime Express]].<br>Though the car's interior lacks soft cushions and seating, thanks to the meticulously designed wooden seats and the roomy interior, it still offers a first-class passenger experience. Whether used for rest or for delighting in the views along the way, passengers are sure to have an enjoyable trip. However, passengers should take care to ensure that they do not stay in the car overnight, comfy though the carriage may be. Doing so avoids unnecessary inconvenience for both train staff and passengers alike.
