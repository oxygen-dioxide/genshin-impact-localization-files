{{Location Intro|description=<p>{{If Self|Institute of Natural Philosophy|It|The Institute of Natural Philosophy}} is a dilapidated underwater research facility that once belonged to the organization of the same name, led by Director [[Dwight Lasker]]. Much of the Institute's research remains preserved within the ruined facility, including numerous precursors to modern-day Fontainian technologies and the earliest experiements of the [[Narzissenkreuz Ordo]].</p>}}

Access to the Institute of Natural Philosophy is unlocked through the {{Quest|Aqueous Tidemarks}}.

====Ancient Investigative Report====
(This interactable is located before the [[Ruin Guard]] at the entrance to the last room of the Submerged Ruins: Central Quartier underground area.)

...<br>
...There are suspicions of some sort of [[Narzissenkreuz Ordo|association]] or group activity among the leaders, with a so-called "[[Narzissenkreuz|Master]]" involved. Whilst they are very vigilant towards external investigations, there is currently no evidence of aggression or any invasive nature, so the case is not being pursued through official investigative channels...<br>
...objective remains unclear, and further investigation is required. There is reason to suspect that the [[Institute of Natural Philosophy|Institute]] may be the hub of these activities...

====Ancient Natural History Excerpts====
...<br>
[[Oceanid]]s are beautiful creatures nurtured by the land of Fontaine. According to legend, the gentle [[Egeria]] shed the first tear, from which the first Oceanid was born. Some say that Egeria felt great sympathy for [[dragon]]s, and others say she felt great sadness over the eventual fate of humanity. Now, all that we have left is a metaphorical representation whose true meaning remains unclear: "The lizard's bones dissolved into mud, from which swans emerged."<br>
The newborn Oceanid was bestowed with the task of comprehending all forms of life: to seek an understanding of the diverse array of species and to love every creature. It emerged from the sea of life, possessing the power of metamorphosis. Egeria wished it to use this power to etch the essence of living creatures into its being and it gradually developed a yearning for life. Once it gained enough understanding of humanity, it shed its first tear upon the earth. We have used "she" to refer to the first and her lineage ever since.<br>
This is the origin of Oceanids.<br>
(A small addendum: Perhaps you believe that this kind of document has no scientific value, asserting that physical evidence and records suggest that the origin of Oceanids predates Egeria and the even earlier realm of [[Remuria]], and you reckon that only Evolutionary Diversity of Forest Pigs: Field Tracking Research on Geographically Distinct Forms counts as genuine research. So, I have a question for you: Do you dare to explore our own origins? The gods unleash thunder in anger, and goddesses cry oceans in sorrow &mdash; these things are real.)

...<br>
Oceanids display considerable disparities in cognitive capacity, partially due to differences in lifespan resulting in very different levels of experience and knowledge regarding the world, but substantial individual variation in the Oceanids themselves also contributes to this phenomenon. Some Oceanids are simply too obtuse to complete tasks related to the continent's water systems and are thus confined to Fontaine, where they assist in soothing human emotions.

...<br>
The increase in the number of Oceanids (we have previously considered breeding, proliferation, and reproduction, but none are suitable terms) does not require any pairing off or matchmaking. After gaining sufficient understanding and emotion, they approach the [[Hydro Archon]] or an elder for permission to claim... um, a thing, which results in their division into little Oceanids.<br>
This thing is highly abstract, and in order to make its name more comprehensible to humans, we refer to it as a "Helixsplit." However, what it is exactly remains unknown. Some believe it could be a drop of pure water essence, nurtured by the emotions and intelligence of the parent, eventually giving rise to life. Others speculate that it might be a single sound, a name, possibly even a forbidden utterance, capable of stirring the cycle of elemental forces and drawing on the desire that doesn't exist with the pure water bodies of Oceanids, allowing new life to be attracted into the world. Still, others propose that it serves as a permit, granting permission for the dreams and desires within Oceanids to be bestowed with a new name &mdash; much like the names of childhood dreams throughout the ages.<br>
However, this is a story between Oceanids, and humans have no hope to know it.

...<br>
The propagation of all Oceanids needs to be officially registered. If something were to happen to Egeria (No disrespect intended&mdash; may she keep some blessings for herself), the Oceanid elders will also ensure the continuation of their species. But in the event of a more calamitous occurrence, what will happen to the Oceanids?

====Ancient Notes====
(This interactable is located in the hallway before the final room of the Submerged Ruins: Central Quartier underground area, along with a [[Hydroculus]] and a chest guarded by two [[Riftwolf|Riftwolves]]. It was written by the director of the Institute of Natural Philosophy, [[Dwight Lasker]].)

...<br>
...Though it's a shame, we'll have to miss it. [[Dwight Lasker|I]] was looking forward to [[Coppelius]]'s new work. Ever since he was a child, he's always been incredibly talented...

...<br>
...Out of consideration for everyone's safety, it has been decided that the [[Narzissenkreuz Institute|Institute]] shall close. Driven by the energy and vigor of youth, the young ones are clamoring to go out and do battle. I hope someday they will understand the importance of prioritizing post-disaster reconstruction over marching off to die...

...<br>
...I fear that it shan't be long before we must depart. We've chosen a good piece of land near the [[Fountain of Lucine]] as the post-relocation site... They even say they want to use the land to build an [[Opera Epiclese|opera house]] &mdash; they'd sooner set faces aflame with shame and laughter! To think that anyone could be so comical...

...<br>
...We're going to pay our respects at [[Basil Elton|Basil]]'s grave...<br>
...I hope it all turns out like [[Emanuel Guillotin|Emanuel]] said. However, it's the Institute's responsibility to support gifted and talented youths...

...<br>
...Met with the newly-appointed [[Neuvillette|Iudex]]. He has a peculiar temperament. Seems much more reliable than Leon and those other clowns...

...<br>
...If all goes well, it has the potential to completely revolutionize our understanding of [[clockwork meka]]. The proposed methodology and plan are reliable. Worth paying more attention...

...<br>
...The results of early phases have been satisfactory, we will increase our investment... [[Carter Scherbius|Carter]]'s leave requests have been increasing in frequency. Better have someone keep an eye on him. He may be having financial difficulties (not like it's possible for it to be a family matter)...

...<br>
After some consideration, I've decided to enroll them and temporarily assign them to the same lab. However, I'm concerned about the impact of their joining after [[Alain Guillotin|Alain]] on the mental state of others... must keep careful watch...

...<br>
...Still unconscious during the visit, so couldn't speak...decided to take a blood sample and see if there's a cure, or a way to mitigate it...

...<br>
Although the proposed research plan is expected to face challenges in obtaining recognition, I believe it holds significant practical value, so it justifies approval. Toxins remain in the soil and water and have not yet been fully neutralized... The water is producing [[Tainted Hydro Phantasm|deformed Oceanids]]... In a way, this could be a reflection of previous events. I only just learned that these are [[Karl Ingold|Karl]]'s adopted children. It's a shame the Narzissenkreuz Institute no longer exists...

...<br>
...This could be the biggest breakthrough in a century, it will change all of society...

...<br>
...The report mentioned abnormal movements... I'll have to find a chance to talk to Emanuel about it...
