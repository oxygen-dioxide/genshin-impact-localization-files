The '''Character Menu''' is the place where the player can view their current character configuration, it is unlocked by default upon starting the game. There are several key aspects of the character menu that the player should be aware of that will optimize the character experience. The character menu can be opened via the white icon in the upper right that looks like the [[Traveler]]'s head. It can also accessed from [[Paimon Menu]] > [[Character]]. The default keybind for opening the Character Menu is {{key|C}}.

A scrollable list of characters the player currently owns as well as any [[Character Trial|trial characters]] currently in the party will be at the top or the left of the screen, depending on the device. Clicking on the bottom left button [[File:Icon List.png|20px|link=]] with four squares will display a tiled list of all of the owned characters and to quick-select a character.

The character's element and [[Vision]] is in the upper left corner, showing the character's [[region]] as well as the element the character resonates with. This element color will also be in the background and the element in question will fill the background both visually and aurally in the form of [[Electro|lightning]], [[Hydro|water bubbles]], [[Cryo|snow]], [[Pyro|ash]], [[Anemo|wind]], [[Dendro|leaves]], or [[Geo|rocks]].

==Attributes==
The '''[[Attributes]]''' menu lists the various attributes a character has. It is also the menu by which the player levels up characters (and claim level-up rewards) and access the [[Dressing Room]] to change their [[Character Outfit|outfits]] and [[Wind Glider]]. Directly underneath the character level is a quick summary of character stats, including Max HP, ATK, DEF, Elemental Mastery and Max Stamina. Clicking on the "Details" button will show more character stats. Underneath this button are the [[Friendship Level]] of the character and a brief description of them.

The "Level Up" or "Ascend" button will allow the player to level up or ascend the character. To ascend, a certain amount [[Character Ascension Material]]s are needed. To level up the character, [[Character EXP]] materials (like [[Wanderer's Advice]], [[Adventurer's Experience]], or [[Hero's Wit]]) are needed. Future ascensions' required materials and rewards can be previewed via the button that has a four-pointed star with an up arrow.

==Weapons==
The '''[[Weapons]]''' menu shows the current weapon a character has equipped. Selecting "Switch" or "Enhance" will allow the character's weapon to be changed to another one. A certain [[Weapon Ascension Material]]s are required to ascend a weapon.

The name of the weapon is at the top in the side panel, alongside the base ATK and main affix. The rarity is listed next, then the current weapon level. The refinement level is listed underneath, alongside its weapon buff.

==Artifacts==
The '''[[Artifacts]]''' menu shows the currently applied artifacts to a character. If a number is listed by it, it means that the character has that many empty artifact slots that have artifacts available to equip.

Artifacts can be leveled up by choosing "Enhance" and switched to by selecting "Equip" or "Switch". Artifacts consume other artifacts as well as [[Artifact EXP]] materials to level up. Details as to the buffs the artifacts are provide can be found by clicking on "Artifact Details". A few basic artifact buffs are listed above that button.

==Constellation==
The '''[[Constellation]]''' menu gives details on a character's [[constellation]]. The character's constellation shape is shown along with the constellations themselves. All characters start at Constellation Level 0. Each additional [[Stella Fortuna]] (or [[Memories]] in the [[Traveler]]'s case) will activate the next constellation level. After reaching Constellation Level 6, a character will have reached its maximum constellation level.

==Talents==
The '''[[Talents]]''' menu provides information on a character's [[talents]]. Clicking on an individual talent will show a preview of the next level's effects and level up the talent if applicable, provided that the players has sufficient [[Talent Level-Up Material]]s. All characters have a [[Normal Attack]], an [[Elemental Skill]], an [[Elemental Burst]], a [[1st Ascension Passive]], and a [[4th Ascension Passive]] talent. All characters except the [[Traveler]] have a [[Utility Passive]]. Some characters have additional talents like an [[Alternate Sprint]] or a secondary Utility Passive.

==Profile==
The '''Profile''' menu displays additional character details, stories, and [[voice-over]]s for a character. Additional character details include voice actor credits for the chosen audio language, [[birthday]], affiliation, [[Vision]]/[[Gnosis]] [[element]], and [[Constellation/Gallery|Constellation]] name. Clicking on "Story" and "Voice-Over" will show a character's stories and voice-overs. Stories and voice-overs that have not yet been unlocked cannot be accessed, but their names can be viewed. There are two lists of voice-overs for story and combat.
