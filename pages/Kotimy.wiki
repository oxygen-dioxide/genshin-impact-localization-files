==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kotimy:''' I wonder what kind of Saurian [[Ifa]] is going to bring home next time?
:{{DIcon}} A wounded one?
::'''Kotimy:''' Probably. He is a vet, after all, and there're always plenty of patients at his clinic.
::'''Kotimy:''' But he spends most of the time out on calls with patients.
::'''Kotimy:''' If the Saurian he took home to care for isn't suffering from a minor sickness, like a cold, then there's probably something pretty seriously wrong with it.
::'''Kotimy:''' Heh, I wish I could learn how to treat Saurians too.
::'''Kotimy:''' If I could help a Qucusaurus someday, perhaps it'd let me ride it...
::{{DIcon}} Random opportunity isn't exactly reliable.
:::'''Kotimy:''' I know! Don't worry, I've always been very serious when it comes to flight training!
:::'''Kotimy:''' However, having a good relationship with your Saurian is never a bad thing, is it?
:::'''Kotimy:''' Maybe soon I'll be able to help Ifa out, just like [[Ororon]] did!
:{{DIcon}} A playful Saurian?
::'''Kotimy:''' Oh, that's probably just [[Cacucu]].
::'''Kotimy:''' He's Ifa's, err... "brother".
::'''Kotimy:''' Anyway, that's what he calls himself. He can mimic human speech, too! That's probably why Ifa calls him Cacucu...
::'''Kotimy:''' Now, I don't know if he truly understands human speech, but he looks pretty cool and I love chatting with him.
::'''Kotimy:''' But not for too long, or it'll get in the way of my daily training!
:{{DIcon}} I'm not sure.
::'''Kotimy:''' I can't wait...
