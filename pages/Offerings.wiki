'''Offerings''' are game systems in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' that take items found through [[Exploration]] in exchange for rewards. If the offering system is a tree that has reached its max potential, it will say "Your offerings have been acknowledged." They are similar to [[Statue of The Seven]] but instead of being able to offer one item at a time, the player automatically offers all in [[Inventory]].
