;(Talking to Huffman)
:{{A|vo dlclq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huffman!
:{{A|vo dlclq002 2 huffman 01.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' Oh, it's you two. Thank you for coming.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 2 huffman 02.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' So – the Darknight Hero. Do you have anything else you're able to share with me?
:{{DIcon}} Could I first ask what's going on?
::{{A|vo dlclq002 2 huffman 03a.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' Ah yes, of course I should fill you in first... apologies for my appalling lapse of etiquette.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, we've got nothing.
::{{A|vo dlclq002 2 huffman 03b.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' Is that so... That is a pity indeed.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 2 huffman 04.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' The situation is... here. Take a look at this.
[[File:Letter To The Dark Knight.png|frame|Letter from the Abyss Order]]
:;(He gives you a [[Letter from the Abyss Order]] which says the following)
::To the "Darknight Hero"
::??? ????? ????? has endured too long your self-proclaimed ????????????? and hypocrisy. We hereby ????????? you:
::We shall ??? ?? ??????? ??? march full-on onto Mondstadt's front gate at ?? ???. If you wish to cling to your so-called justice, don't sit idly by ?? ??? ???????, step up and accept ??? ?????????. Otherwise, Mondstadt's ?????? ???? shall take the fall in your stead.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Geez... what horrible handwriting!
:{{A|vo dlclq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, let me take a closer look... Huh, some parts of this seem to be complete gibberish.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 2 huffman 05.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' Indeed. Although this is written in the [[languages|common tongue]], it appears that a cipher has been used in many places.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 2 huffman 06.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' Nevertheless, one can grasp the general message from the non-ciphered portions alone...
:{{A|vo dlclq002 2 huffman 07.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' This is a war declaration from the Abyss Order to the Darknight Hero.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Does that mean... the bad guys want the Darknight Hero to go away forever and ever?
:{{A|vo dlclq002 2 huffman 08.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' Something like that. Thus, we are hoping to contact him as soon as possible so that we can attempt to coordinate a response.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 2 huffman 09.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' After all, this matter no longer concerns merely the Darknight Hero himself. It impacts the entire city of Mondstadt.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you for the information.
:{{DIcon}} I will keep it in mind.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 2 huffman 10.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' If you find out anything at all, come and find me.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A war declaration sent by the Abyss Order...
:{{A|vo dlclq002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This is not good news at all for Master Diluc! Quick, we should go tell him right away!
----
;(Talking to Diluc at Dawn Winery)
:{{A|vo dlclq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Master Diluc! Just now we were at the Knights of Favonius and, and–
:{{A|vo dlclq002 4 diluc 01.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' I take it you're about to inform me of the war declaration from the Abyss Order?
:{{A|vo dlclq002 4 diluc 02.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' I am aware of it. Though I appreciate you for taking the trouble to come all this way.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What?
:{{A|vo dlclq002 4 diluc 03.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' The Dawn Winery's intelligence network extends beyond commercial matters.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! So, what's the plan, Master Diluc?
:{{A|vo dlclq002 4 diluc 04.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' I'm open to suggestions...
:{{DIcon}} You really should join forces with the Knights...
::{{A|vo dlclq002 4 diluc 05a.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' No. That would be playing right into the hands of the Abyss Order.
::{{A|vo dlclq002 4 diluc 05a 1.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' They know full well that we don't exactly see eye to eye. They're using this as a means to force me into making an appearance.
::{{A|vo dlclq002 4 diluc 05a 2.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' If my identity were exposed, all my future activities would be subject to some degree of interference from the Knights.
::{{A|vo dlclq002 4 diluc 05a 3.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' After all, no powerful organization wishes to be outdone by someone from the outside.
:{{DIcon}} Stay at the winery until this blows over.
::{{A|vo dlclq002 4 diluc 05b.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' That would be tantamount to handing this over to the Knights.
::{{A|vo dlclq002 4 diluc 05b 1.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Had they been worthy of this task to begin with, things would never have escalated to this point.
::{{A|vo dlclq002 4 diluc 06.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' In any case, circumstances are not dire enough to warrant me going into hiding and leaving the Knights to deal with the consequences.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew... the Abyss Order has really dealt you a tough hand this time. What a sneaky little bunch those guys are!
:{{A|vo dlclq002 4 diluc 07.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' There is a way. But for it to work, I need some more information.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 4 diluc 08.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Specifically, I need to decipher the obscured portions of the Abyss Order's war declaration.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Obscured portions? You mean the bits Paimon can't read?
:{{A|vo dlclq002 4 diluc 09.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' It must be a cipher only understood by members of the Abyss Order, used to spread messages within the organization.
:{{DIcon}} Why would they send you a written message that only they can read?
:{{DIcon}} If they knew we can't read it, why did they write it in the first place?
:{{A|vo dlclq002 4 diluc 10.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' It's not simply a war declaration, but also a notification to their own.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 4 diluc 11.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' When you take a stand that makes you a hero to one party, you also become a villain to the other.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 4 diluc 12.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' And since I've been the Abyss Order's enemy for so long...
:{{A|vo dlclq002 4 diluc 13.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' They've made me the target around which they can rally their troops and unite their strength.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow... Seems like it takes a lot of brains to be a superhero, huh?
:{{A|vo dlclq002 4 diluc 14.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' I understand my enemy well is all. As the saying goes, heroes and villains are two sides of the same coin.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So what're we gonna do about the intel that's written in gibberish then? How do we... ungibberishify it?
:{{A|vo dlclq002 4 diluc 15.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Simple. When you don't understand something, you ask.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 4 diluc 16.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' I've already tracked down one of their strongholds... If you're interested, feel free to come along.
----
;(Talking to Diluc outside the Abyss Order stronghold)
:{{A|vo dlclq002 6 diluc 01.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' This is the place.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 6 diluc 02.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Abandoned ruins like these are precisely the kind of place the Abyss Order likes to camp out.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 6 diluc 03.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Come on. There's no time to lose.
----
;(At the end of the stronghold)
:{{A|vo dlclq002 10 abyss 01.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' How did you find me here!? Favonian scum!
:{{A|vo dlclq002 10 diluc 01.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' I am no Knight of Favonius. Now, start talking! Your plan, what is it?
:{{A|vo dlclq002 10 abyss 02.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' I see you received our letter... But if you think I'm going to let you in on our secrets, I'm afraid you're quite mistaken!
:{{A|vo dlclq002 10 diluc 02.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Hmph. You appear to have misunderstood the situation you are in.
:{{DIcon}} Burn him with {{color|buzzword|Searing Hand}}!
:{{A|vo dlclq002 10 abyss 03.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' D–Did you just use a Pyro Vision to shoot f–fire from your hands!? ...Ah! It burns!!
:{{A|vo dlclq002 10 diluc 03.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Let's see how long it takes for you to crack...
:{{DIcon}} Burn him with {{color|buzzword|Searing Hand}} again!
:{{A|vo dlclq002 10 abyss 04.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' Stop! Stop! P–Please, the pain– I beg you... make it stop!
:{{DIcon}} Burn him with {{color|buzzword|Searing Hand}} again!
::{{A|vo dlclq002 10 abyss 05a 1.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' Ugh...
::{{A|vo dlclq002 10 diluc 04a 1.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Playing dead won't help you – that fire was nowhere near strong enough to– Oh... He seems to have {{color|buzzword|passed out}}...
::{{A|vo dlclq002 10 diluc 04a 2.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Hey! You sleep when I say you can sleep!
::{{A|vo dlclq002 10 abyss 05a 2.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' Aah! It burns!
:{{DIcon}} {{color|buzzword|Interrogate him}} about their plan of attack.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 10 abyss 05b 1.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' I'll talk, I'll talk! Ow ow ow... P–Please, stop! I'll tell you {{color|buzzword|everything}}!
:{{A|vo dlclq002 10 abyss 05b 2.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' Th–The Abyss Order, we've amassed a force bound by a shared hatred for the Darknight Hero...
:{{A|vo dlclq002 10 abyss 05b 3.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' They... They will march on the Mondstadt {{color|buzzword|city gates}} at 10 PM tomorrow night.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 10 abyss 05b 4.ogg}} '''Abyss Mage:''' That's everything I know... Please... Don't make me suffer those flames again...
:{{A|vo dlclq002 10 diluc 04b.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' That's it? Well, I doubt you'd be foolish enough to keep anything else hidden.
----
;(Outside the stronghold)
:{{A|vo dlclq002 13 diluc 01.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Now that I have the information I need, I must prepare.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 13 diluc 02.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' I would be grateful if you could keep me updated on how the Knights of Favonius respond to this matter.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 13 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yes, Master Diluc sir! Anything you say, Master Diluc sir!
:{{A|vo dlclq002 13 diluc 03.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' ...Why are you acting so strange all of a sudden?
:{{A|vo dlclq002 13 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' In... in light of what just went down here a moment ago...
:{{A|vo dlclq002 13 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Master Diluc has officially reached No. 1 on Paimon's "people not to tick off under any circumstances" list...
:{{A|vo dlclq002 13 diluc 04.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' ...
----
;(Talking to Huffman)
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 huffman 01.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' If we do not make contact with the Darknight Hero soon...
:{{DIcon}} What are we to do about the Abyss Order's challenge?
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 huffman 02.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' Ah, it's you two. I must admit, this issue of the Darknight Hero is proving to be something of a headache.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 huffman 03.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' We've just held a meeting to decide on an appropriate course of action. Can you guess what it is?
:{{DIcon}} Bury our heads firmly in the sand?
::{{A|vo dlclq002 15 huffman 04a.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' Haha... Good one. But no, the Knights cannot afford to simply stand by and watch while there is even the slightest inkling of a threat facing Mondstadt.
::{{A|vo dlclq002 15 huffman 04a 1.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' If that were the case, more and more people would start to rely on the Darknight Hero instead of the Knights of Favonius.
:{{DIcon}} Join forces with the Darknight Hero?
::{{A|vo dlclq002 15 huffman 04b.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' No. That would send a signal that the Knights are in favor of the Darknight Hero's continued presence in our city... which we are not.
::{{A|vo dlclq002 15 huffman 04b 1.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' Encouraging this kind of individual heroism undermines the Knights' authority.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh. Well, what's the plan then?
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 huffman 05.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' Find out the Darknight's Hero true identity, and offer him our protection.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Protection"? He seems to be doing just fine without your protection so far, y'know...
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 huffman 06.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' Pff...
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 huffman 07.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' Well, since you've aided the Knights in the past, I might as well just tell you.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 huffman 08.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' The offer of protection is just a ruse, in order for the Knights of Favonius to take over full – and exclusive – responsibility for this matter.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You aren't gonna let the Darknight Hero be all heroic and stuff? Why not?
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 huffman 09.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' Firstly, to show the might of the Knights of Favonius &mdash; to prove to the people that without the Darknight Hero, they can still rely on the Knights to maintain peace and harmony.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 huffman 10.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' Secondly, the Abyss Order have no mercy in their hearts. If anything happened to the Darknight Hero...
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 huffman 11.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' It would only serve to further their nefarious ambitions.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Gosh... Paimon never knew the life of a knight involved so much untold anguish before.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 huffman 12.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' But none of this will work if we don't establish the Darknight Hero's true identity in time.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' There's no need to despair, Huffman. Just follow my plan and everything will be fine.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 huffman 13.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' Ah, Captain Kaeya.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Lately, Master Diluc has been working the bar at the [[Angel's Share]] every night.
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' All I need you to do is keep him in your sight. Think you can manage that for me?
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 huffman 14.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' Yes, Captain Kaeya! ...But, does that mean that...
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 huffman 15.ogg}} '''Huffman:''' Master Diluc is the Darknight Hero?
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Who knows...? It's just a hunch. I've been known to be wrong on occasion.
----
;(Afterwards)
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, Paimon feels we saw a whole new side of the Knights of Favonius today...
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But Paimon doesn't understand, how is Kaeya so sure he knows who the Darknight Hero is?
:{{A|vo dlclq002 15 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We need to get to the {{color|buzzword|winery}} and tell Master Diluc as soon as Paimonly possible!
