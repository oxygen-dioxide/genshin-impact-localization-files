'''Nihil Sub Caligine Novum''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Wonders of the World]]''. This achievement is earned during ''[[Octave of the Maushiro]].''

==Trivia==
*The name is the reference to the Vulgate translation at Ecclesiastes 1:10 (1:9) ''[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nihil_sub_sole_novum#Latin nihil sub sole novum]'' ("nothing new under the sun") which means "there is nothing novel in the existence". ''Sole'' was replaced with ''caligine'' which means "mist" or "fog" (and in some cases - "darkness"). Thus, the name means "nothing new in the fog".
