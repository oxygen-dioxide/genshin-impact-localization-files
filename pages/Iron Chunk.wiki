'''Iron Chunks''' are a [[Forging Material]] item. They are used when [[forging]] for [[Enhancement Ore]] and to [[Creation|create]] a variety of [[Furnishings]].

==How to Obtain==
Iron Chunks are generally found inside caves, mines, and near mountainous terrain all around [[Teyvat]]. See the gallery or the '''[https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=172 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for specific locations.

They can be harvested by attacking their destructible nodes, dropping 1-3 Iron Chunks. Like all [[Geo Constructs]], it is faster to destroy them using [[Blunt Attack]]s and {{Geo}} abilities. Their respawn rate is 24 hours.

In [[Co-Op Mode]], each nearby player will get their own drops with amounts randomized separately and players will not be able to see others' drops. Unlike most [[Materials]], they cannot be affected by {{Anemo}} abilities that may move them.

They can also be dropped by some [[Investigation]] points and are awarded upon completion of some [[Expedition]]s.

Additionally, the following NPCs give Iron Chunks after following a certain dialogue branch for the first time:
* [[Hanfeng, "Cold Blade"]] in [[Qingce Village]], [[Liyue]] (8 Iron Chunks)
* [[Qian]] in [[Liyue Harbor]], [[Liyue]] (6 Iron Chunks)

==Descriptions==
{{Description|This iron ore can be turned into a multitude of handy items in the hands of a skilled craftsman. Mineral ores' presence on the surface usually indicates abundant ore veins underneath.}}

==Notes==
Claiming Iron Chunks from expeditions also grants [[Battle Pass]] Experience for "Mine 10 Items" under Daily Missions, similar to obtaining other ores from expeditions.
