'''Mini Seelie''' are commemorative [[gadgets]] from the [[Lost Riches]] event. They do not expire, but they cannot be used to search for more [[Iron Coin]]s.

The Mini Seelie is not a true gadget and is merely toggled on when equipped, thus regular gadgets can still be used as per normal. The Mini Seelie will also temporarily disappear when in combat mode. As it does not give any indication of chests, the Mini Seelie is purely a cosmetic item.

==Notes==
During each Lost Riches event, one Mini Seelie can be chosen:
