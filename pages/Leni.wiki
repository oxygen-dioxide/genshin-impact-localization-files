:'''Leni:''' Do you need me to do anything for you? O hero who fought Stormterror in the skies, the ever-dutiful commission shredder, the finder of hidden chests, the breacher of the unknown mists...
:{{DIcon}} You don't have to use so many titles every single time...
::'''Leni:''' Oh no, that won't do. As an adventurer who has accomplished far less than you, I must always show you the highest respect.
::'''Leni:''' I'm sure I'm not the only one in the guild who thinks this way. Please accept our show of respect!
:{{DIcon}} You seem really enthusiastic.
::'''Leni:''' Hahaha! Of course! I really love my job, after all!
::'''Leni:''' I think that adventurers should keep attempting more difficult challenges so they can keep moving towards greater heights.
::'''Leni:''' Whether it's bettering myself or helping others to get stronger, all these things make me happy!
:{{DIcon}} Aren't you going to participate in the challenge yourself?
::'''Leni:''' Aha! To tell you the truth, I've already had my fill defeating monsters when I went scouting!
::'''Leni:''' It's a pity that the creatures nearby are not in endless supply. As the one organizing the event, I can't just focus on making myself happy.
::'''Leni:''' You should also go easy and leave some targets for the newbies so they can practice.
