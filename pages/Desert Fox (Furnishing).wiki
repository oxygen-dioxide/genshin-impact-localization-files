|description    = A sly animal as elusive as a fairy that often appears in folk stories, symbolizing unusual cunning and ancient memories.<br>These animals call the vast desert home and are smaller than most of their kin, which is possibly how they evaded the ancient calamities. Their long ears are an adaptation that helps them better live in their hot and dry desert home.<br>Logically speaking, you would think that these creatures would be much more active in the cooler Realm Within, but neither the slightly muddled [[Tubby]] nor the itinerant [[Chubby]] have seen them all that much, and in lieu of hard evidence have had to guess that they likely have a decent relationship with the [[Masked Weasel]]s, for they can be seen (when the Desert Foxes can be seen at all) playing together.
