|vo_07_03_tx         = If you're heading to [[Jueyun Karst]], please bring me back a bunch of [[Qingxin]]. Just one bunch is enough. Travel expenses... Ah, I almost forgot, during the effective period of our contract, travel expenses are to be paid for by yourself. Sorry to bother you.

|vo_08_03_tx         = Despite the multitude of affairs she deals with in a day, Ningguang always continues to press on. A rare gem indeed. I'm reminded of the time that she used to walk barefoot from [[Yaoguang Shoal]] to the south wharf, trying to sell her wares as she went. Time is cruel to humans.
|vo_08_03_mention    = Ningguang
|vo_08_04_title      = About [[Hu Tao]]

|vo_08_07_tx         = Liyue's prosperity has not been merely built on [[Rex Lapis]]' oracles or wisdom. It is also thanks to the countless servants of the Geo Archon who have honored their end of the contract. Of them, Ganyu is the one who has served for the longest time. If you want to know about her past... You should ask her about it. I fear my wording would not be delicate enough to receive her approval.

|vo_08_08_tx         = She is the most impious of the [[Qixing]] &mdash; but I actually find the conviction of such people quite endearing. The only reason I was able to consider taking a step back from such overarching management of Liyue was because there are people like her. People who speak up when they believe themselves to be right, and then go and do something decisive about it.
|vo_08_08_mention    = Keqing

|vo_08_09_tx         = Despite never having signed a contract with me, she upholds order within many strata of Liyue society in her own way, dispelling misconceptions and correcting biases... Should her father one day return from his travels, I imagine that he would be even more delighted than I.

|vo_08_10_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Baal.ogg
|vo_08_10_tx         = Time tempers all volition. Yet she would give up everyone for her beliefs. Perhaps it is for this very reason that she has come to where she stands today... Should the chance come by me, I too would like to learn of the Eternity for which she so earnestly endeavors.
|vo_08_10_mention    = Baal

|vo_08_12_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Furina.ogg
|vo_08_12_tx         = She made a contract with her own self to save the nation, strictly adhered to it for over five centuries without once wavering, and even fooled the [[Heavenly Principles]] in the end... I have great respect for approaches to justice that place exacting demands not only on others, but also on the self. Though her divinity has vanished and the throne of the [[Archon]] is no more, Furina will go down in [[Fontaine]]'s history as a God of Justice worthy of recognition.

|vo_08_13_tx         = I hear many merchants of Liyue tell tales of a Ms. Xianyun. By most accounts, she appears proud and taciturn upon first glance, yet in conversation, people find her to be forthright and fair-minded, and they are pleased to make her acquaintance. I am glad to hear this. But... I have also heard a great many accounts lauding her readiness to part with large sums of [[Mora]]...

|vo_08_14_tx         = [[Natlan]]'s long history of struggle fueled its warriors to overcome the Abyss and transcend fate to forge a new future.

|vo_09_02_tx         = Have you heard of the origin of the [[Blackcliff Forge]]? In the past, they would mine the ore veins of [[Mt. Tianheng]], and then replace the cavities with factory equipment. Tunnels run in all directions throughout the mountain &mdash; some even run to the ruins deep within the earth. I doubt there is a person today who could map out all the tunnels.

|vo_09_03_tx         = Have you heard of the origins of the [[Lantern Rite Festival|Lantern Rite]]? In a war, long ago, the people of Liyue would release lanterns to remind their soldiers of the way home, and to never lose sight of themselves. Though in this day and age, I doubt there are any that remember.

|vo_09_04_tx         = The God of Contracts. Have you heard of him? He has an impressive memory. He remembers the name of every person he comes across, and the date that every ship in Liyue sets sail. After all, only in being able to do so can he memorize all of the contracts he holds. With that said, not every memory is a happy one...

|vo_10_02_tx         = To get people to abide by a contract and act in accordance with the guidelines set out within is simply to ask them to respect the concept of fairness. It is not a large request. How are there those who still do not understand such simplicity?

==Trivia==
* In his "Good Afternoon" line, the "good place in Chihu Rock" he refers to is likely either [[Wanmin Restaurant]] or [[Third-Round Knockout]], two restaurants in Chihu Rock that he shows a preference towards.
* "About Us: Gold" is a reference to the description on [[Prithiva Topaz Gemstone]], which are words spoken by him.
* Differences between language versions:
**'''Good Evening:''' In Chinese, Zhongli calls Yun Jin {{zh|云先生|Yún-xiānshēng}}. Though {{zh|先生|xiānshēng}} is now normally only used for men, similar to "Mr." in English, in ancient times it's used as a respectful address for accomplished or influential individuals, similar to {{ja|先生|sensei}} in Japanese.
** '''About Tartaglia: Composed:''' In Chinese, Zhongli calls Tartaglia {{zh|武人|wǔrén}} instead of "rascal," which is a general term for any martial artist.
** '''Chat: Reminiscing:''' In Chinese, the first sentence Zhongli recites is from a [https://baike.baidu.com/item/唐多令·芦叶满汀洲/8464037 Chinese poem]: "{{zh|欲买桂花同载酒}}". The direct translation of this line is "[I] wish to buy {{w|Osmanthus fragrans|osmanthus}} and drink wine together." The poem continues with "{{zh|终不似，少年游}}", meaning: "In the end, it cannot be [carefree] like the journeys of my youth." Zhongli says instead, "{{zh|只可惜故人，何日再见呢？}}", which roughly means: "It's only a pity I know not when I can see that old friend again."
** '''About Xiao:''' In Chinese, {{zh|连理镇心散}} is used instead of "painkillers." This fictional medicine is based on {{zh|镇心散}}, a traditional Chinese medicine for clearing the mind and relieving emotional pain, commonly used to treat symptoms such as postpartum depression in new mothers.
* In the Japanese version, one of his voice lines ("Chat: Reminiscing") was updated twice.
