{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Futaba:''' Big {{MC|m=bro|f=sis}}, could you tell me a story?
:{{DIcon}} What kind of story would you like to hear?
::'''Futaba:''' Granny always tells me scary stories. I'd like to listen to something different this time! Something to do with gods and legends...
::'''Futaba:''' Wait, are you saying that the [[Anemo Archon]] is a drunkard, and {{sic|that [[Geo Archon]]}} never takes [[Mora]] along when he goes out? Erm... are you just messing with me?
::'''Futaba:''' I think I'll just go and listen to Granny's stories.
:{{DIcon}} Are there any interesting stories about the village?
:;(After completing ''[[Yougou Cleansing]]'')
::'''Futaba:''' Hmm... Interesting stories... Ah, I've got one! It's said that there are bad things that appear in some scary house around here. I've always wanted to go and {{sic|it see}} for myself.
::'''Futaba:''' Takeru promised to come with me, but his legs got all wobbly when the house got in sight! What a scaredy-cat!
::'''Futaba:''' If you ask me, I think there must be Tatarigami living in there! They're the scariest type of ghosts! They mess with people's minds and make them go insane.
::'''Futaba:''' Why don't I go myself? Erm... I already told you, Tatarigami are super scary! It would make more sense to bring someone with me, it'd be dumb to go alone.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Futaba:''' You can come find me if you ever get bored. Catch ya later!
