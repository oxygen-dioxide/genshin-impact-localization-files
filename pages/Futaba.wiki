{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Futaba:'''  Big sis/Big bro, could you tell me a story?
:{{DIcon}} What kind of story would you like to hear?
::'''Futaba:''' Granny always tells me scary stories. I'd like to listen to something different this time! Something to do with gods and legends...
::'''Futaba:''' Wait, are you saying that the Anemo Archon is a drunkard, and that the Geo Archon never takes Mora when he goes out? Erm... are you just messing with me?
::'''Futaba:''' I think I'll just go and listen to Granny's stories.
:{{DIcon}} Are there any interesting stories about the village?{{Verify|Unlock condition}}
::'''Futaba:''' Hmm... Interesting stories... Ah I've got one! It's said that there are bad things that appear in some scary house around here. I've always wanted to go and see it for myself.
::'''Futaba:''' Takeru promised to come with me, but his legs got all wobbly when the house got in sight! What a scaredy-cat!
::'''Futaba:''' If you ask me, I think there must be Tatarigami living in there! They're the scariest type of ghosts! They mess with people's minds and make them go insane.
::'''Futaba:''' Why don't I go myself? Erm... I already told you, Tatarigami are super scary! It would make more sense to bring someone with me, it'd be dumb to go alone.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Futaba:''' You can come find me if you ever get bored. Catch ya later!
