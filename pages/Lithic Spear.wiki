==Description==
A weapon favored by the [[Millelith]] of yore.<br>
Made from a lith of the [[Guyun Stone Forest]], said to be able to pierce even through dragon scales...<br>
Its great weight prevents the Millelith of today from equipping it.

In ancient times, the Millelith would conduct themselves in [[Rex Lapis]]' name according to this axiom:<br>
"While rock stays hard, the mountain shall never fail; while the Millelith stands guard, evil shall never prevail."<br>
In the past, they went forth to subdue demons and protect the roads and the countryside.<br>
In these peaceful times, their duties have shifted to maintaining order.

At a certain point in the past, the earth did shake, and the mountains did tremble.<br>
Then, the Millelith gave out equipment left over from the ancient wars to those among them who were of unusually great stature.<br>
These were the incredibly weighty Lithic Spears, and they were used as shoveling tools to rescue the injured.<br>
"The Lithic Spear pierces through rock with ease."<br>
"If a thousand such spears could be lined up in formation today, none could stand before them."

Yet in an even earlier era, when the world was in yet deeper turmoil,<br>
Every soldier in the Millelith could wield these colossal weapons.<br>
Thus were they able to protect Rex Lapis' kingdom and defend their homeland.<br>
With a thousand Lithic Spears lined up in formation, no evil could prevail against them.
