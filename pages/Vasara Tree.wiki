'''Vasara Trees''' are trees, usually created by the [[Aranara]], that contain dreams and memories. The speed of a Vasara Tree's growth is reliant on the memories contained within the seed used to plant it.<ref name="Fruits">{{Ref/Quest|For Fruits, Seeds, and Trees}}</ref>

During ''[[The Rhythm that Leads to the Gloomy Path]]'', ''[[The Rhythm that Nurtures the Sprout]]'', and ''[[The Rhythm that Reveals the Beastly Trail]]'', the [[Traveler]] accompanies the Aranara to cleanse the dreams of the Vasara Trees by defeating the Fungi inside and removing traces of [[Marana]]. As thanks for making the tree healthy again, each Vasara Tree bears a [[Vasoma Fruit]], which is the accumulation of the dreams and memories of the Vasara Tree.<ref name="Gloomy">{{Ref/Quest|The Rhythm that Leads to the Gloomy Path}}</ref> The three Vasoma Fruits are offered to the first Vasara Tree, the [[Fane of Ashvattha|Ashvattha Tree]]. However, the Ashvattha Tree has been corroded by Marana, and [[Arama]] takes its place, growing into the new Ashvattha Tree.<ref name="Fruits" />

==Lore==
When the Aranara were first created, [[Viaghara]], the ruler of the jungle, blessed them under the first Vasara Tree. Viaghara's "pact with the divine" prevented the Aranara from being harmed by the birds and beasts of the forest.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Laurel Coronet}}</ref>

The Aranara [[Araji]], [[Aramaha]], and [[Arayama]] turned into the three Vasara Trees encountered during ''[[Aranyaka]]''.<ref name="Fruits" /> These three Aranara sealed each of the [[Ashvattha's Concourse]]s after [[Old Vanarana]] was sealed and the Marana came into existence, turning the concourses and the Vasara Trees within them into sacred places.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Encounter in the Woods}}</ref> [[Aramuhukunda]] also turned into a Vasara Tree in Old Vanarana to suppress [[Marana's Avatar]], but this tree was withered away.<ref name="Fruits" />
