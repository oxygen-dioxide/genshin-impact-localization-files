:'''Khayyam:''' Hello, child! How can I help?
:{{DIcon}} About Irfan...
::'''Khayyam:''' Oh, him... We are childhood friends. He went to Port Ormos and became a merchant, then got married and lived well...
::'''Khayyam:''' I haven't had drinks and talked with him in a long time... We didn't get to see each other before he died a few years ago...
:{{DIcon}} About [[Siman Farrokhzad|Siman]]...
::'''Khayyam:''' ...
::'''Khayyam:''' Hm...? Oh, her...
::'''Khayyam:''' "The child born in the middle of sands cherishes green more than anyone else." This sentence probably is about her...
::'''Khayyam:''' She should have followed in her father's footsteps and become a mercenary, adventuring in the vast desert... But she chose the path of a researcher.
::'''Khayyam:''' She was born cut out for a mercenary, through and through. To achieve her goals, she'd act regardless of the cost or the consequences, even her own life...
::'''Khayyam:''' I tried to understand her, but I was too young, and it turned out quite unpleasant... So, it is as you see. We have been apart for many years... many decades, actually.
::'''Khayyam:''' I hope she is doing well.
:{{DIcon}} About the medical history... ''(Only available after interacting with the [[Bimarstan#Medical History of Giyath Khayyam|Medical History of Giyath Khayyam]])''
::'''Khayyam:''' Medical history? Medical history...
::'''Khayyam:''' Oh! You saw it? My medical history?
::'''Khayyam:''' Haha... You saw it, huh... You saw it.
::'''Khayyam:''' They said I would forget everything in the end. I would forget everything I learned in my life, forget my best friend... everyone and everything.
::'''Khayyam:''' When that day comes, I will lose my memory, my everything, my sense of being alive. Then I'll forget why I exist. I am destined to be like that... sooner or later...
::'''Khayyam:''' So until then, at least until then... I want to do what I want. Just stay in the place I want to die in.
::'''Khayyam:''' Forgetting cannot stop my steps, and neither can Siman...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Khayyam:''' Haha, don't let me keep you for too long, child!
