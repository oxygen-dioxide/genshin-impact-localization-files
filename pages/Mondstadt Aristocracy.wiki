'''Mondstadt's aristocracy''' was the ruling class of [[Mondstadt]] after the fall of [[Decarabian's Mondstadt]]. Over the course of their 1,600-year reign, however, they went from being the noble protectors of the people to their tyrannical and oppressive overlords.

Their oppression of both citizens and foreigners alike eventually roused the Anemo Archon [[Barbatos]] from his slumber, and he assisted the foreign-born gladiator [[Vennessa]] in her rebellion against the aristocracy. The resistance emerged victorious and most of the aristocracy was exiled from Mondstadt.
