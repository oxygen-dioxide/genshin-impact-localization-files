The '''Night Kingdom''', also known as the '''realm of the Wayob''' and the '''kingdom of the Lord of the Night''',<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Flow-Inverted Wayob Manifestation}}</ref> is a realm within [[Natlan]] where the [[Wayob]] and the souls of the dead reside. It was created by [[Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night]],

It is described as "a liminal space between the body and mind, life and death,"<ref name="NANA">{{Ref/Quest|Natlan! A New Adventure}}</ref> and is located deep underground.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Moment of Awakening}}</ref> Due to the lack of stable, deep-rooted [[Ley Line]]s within Natlan, the Night Kingdom essentially functions as Natlan's Ley Lines.

==Overview==
When the people of Natlan die, they enter the Night Kingdom, where they will eventually lose their sense of self and become one with the sea of souls.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Decision (Archon Quest)}}</ref> However, [[Ancient Name]] bearers who fall in battle (such as in the [[Night Warden Wars]]) can be brought back by the [[Ode of Resurrection]], provided that their team has triumphed against the [[Abyss]].<ref name="NANA"/> If an Ancient Name bearer dies by defeat and is not resurrected, their Ancient Name will be lost forever. However, if they die by other circumstances, they will eventually be reborn in Natlan, albeit in a different form.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Fuel Named "Fate"}}</ref> The ability of the Ode of Resurrection to bring Ancient Name bearers back to life originates from [[Ronova]], the [[Four Shades|Shade]] who controls the power of death, who let [[Xbalanque]] borrow her power.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As One We Watch the Setting Sun}}</ref>

The souls in the Night Kingdom are known as '''Nightsouls'''. Natlanese warriors can draw on the power of these Nightsouls to enhance their combat abilities, enabling them to use [[Nightsoul's Blessing]], Nightsoul Transmission, and Nightsoul Bursts.

Since the Night Kingdom is different from the Ley Lines in other areas of [[Teyvat]], memories obtained in the presence of the Night Kingdom seem to be incompatible with those from outside Natlan. While in the process of creating an Ancient Name for the [[Traveler]], [[Xilonen]] explains that the feats they did outside of Natlan could not assist in the process, as the Night Kingdom had no memories of their feats. Even then, both Xilonen and [[Citlali]] believed that they would need to the help of the Lord of the Night in order for them to be recorded.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|All Names are Noble}}</ref> Likewise, the Night Kingdom does not accept souls from non-native inhabitants, with very few exceptions.

==History==
After the ancient battle between the [[Heavenly Principles]] and the [[dragon]]s, the original Ley Lines of Natlan were left severely damaged. With guidance from the Ronova, one of the [[Four Shades]], the [[Angel]] [[Yohualtecuhtin]] used fragments of the old Ley Lines to reconstruct a similar network which formed the Night Kingdom. Later, the first [[Pyro Archon]], [[Xbalanque]], strengthened the realm.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Beneath the Secret Source}}</ref>

During [[cataclysm]] five hundred years ago, the Night Kingdom was overrun by [[Abyss]]al forces.<ref name="PaF">{{Ref/Quest|Past and Future}}</ref> Over the ensuing centuries, the Wayob engaged in a ceaseless battle against the Abyss, which depleted their energy and impaired their ability to communicate with the people of Natlan. By time the [[Traveler]] arrived in Natlan, the Pyro Archon, [[Mavuika]], estimated that the Night Kingdom would be completely destroyed in less than a year.<ref name="PaF" />

During the events of [[Chapter V|Natlan's Archon Quests]], the Traveler ventures into the Night Kingdom several times. The first time was to rescue [[Kachina]] when an Ode of Resurrection ceremony failed to resurrect her, during which the Abyss sealed them in the Night Kingdom. However, [[Mavuika]] managed to break in and rescue them by sacrificing her keepsakes. Later, during the Abyss' failed invasion of Natlan, [[Gosoythoth]] was defeated and fled into the deepest, most contaminated parts of the Night Kingdom. The Traveler later ventured into the depths of the Night Kingdom with Mavuika and defeated Gosoythoth. Gosoythoth's destruction purged the Night Kingdom of Abyssal influence, and the Lord of the Night returned to it to maintain the Ley Lines after the war concluded.

Mavuika originally planned to sacrifice herself in order to completely restore the Night Kingdom after defeating the Abyss. However, the [[Fatui Harbinger]] [[Capitano]] intervened and traded Mavuika's death with his own death, merging his life force with the Lord of the Night to strengthen and rewrite the rules of the Ley Lines. After Capitano's sacrifice, people from outside Natlan are now accepted into the Night Kingdom.

==Trivia==
* In the [[Version Trailer]] ''[https://youtu.be/w1BaF4fd1UM "Flowers Resplendent on the Sun-Scorched Sojourn"]'', the tip of a [[Celestial Nail]] in the Night Kingdom was shown briefly. In-game, Celestial Nails can be seen in two places in the Night Kingdom. One can be seen in the distance during the {{Quest|Black Stone Under a White Stone|showType=0}}, and another can be seen high above the arena associated with [[Nightsoul Totem]]s.
* There are some references in the lore of Teyvat to a place called {{w|Xibalba}},<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lights, Kamera, Action!}}</ref><ref>[[Local Legend|Cihuacoatl of Chimeric Bone — Once Walked With the Lord of Xibalba]]</ref> which in Mayan mythology is an underworld where the souls of the dead reside and which is ruled over by the {{w|Maya death gods}}. Various caves and cenotes in Mesoamerica are held to be entrances to Xibalba. This bears clear parallels to the Night Kingdom, which is also an underworld location containing the spirits of the dead and ruled by powerful entities, and which can be entered through underground passages. It may be that Xibalba is another name for the Night Kingdom.
