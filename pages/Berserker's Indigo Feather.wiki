==Description==
The once-sane berserker's homeland fell victim to the raging war between gods and mortals.<br />The rose garden burst into flames and birds of omen fed on the flesh of his countrymen.<br />Reborn in flames, vengeance and bloodlust took over the warrior's mind, turning him into a berserker.<br />Black feathers, scattered on the battlefield, were painted red by his rage as he took his revenge.
