'''Theater Mechanicus''' is a [[Recurring Event]].

==Basic Gameplay==
In Theater Mechanicus, players must set up Mechanici that deal Elemental and Physical DMG to enemies throughout the arena in designated spots to prevent them from escaping the stage. Buying Mechanici requires a certain number of points, and selling Mechanici recuperates up to 50-75% of points spent.

As the gameplay mirrors that of {{w|tower defense}} games, characters are unable to deal any direct damage (indirect such as [[Fall Damage]] remains unaffected) and cannot use their [[Elemental Burst]] abilities, as energy is temporarily drained to 0. [[Elemental Skill]]s remain unaffected and enemies can be applied [[elements]] for [[Elemental Reactions]]. Enemies are also significantly easier to stagger.

If too many enemies escape during the stage, the player automatically fails.

==Trivia==
* Several other events have incorporated Theater Mechanicus or mechanici into the gameplay:
** [[Fungus Mechanicus]] involved battles between the fungi and the mechanici; however, players controlled the fungi rather than the mechanici, and the mechanici could be destroyed.
** [[Divine Ingenuity: Collector's Chapter]] featured the stage [[Divine Ingenuity/2023-06-08#Imaginarium: Bastion Mechanicus|Imaginarium: Bastion Mechanicus]], a version of Theater Mechanicus which also allowed the player to deal damage to opponents. Players could also create their own custom Theater Mechanicus domains using the [[Mechanicus Fixed Emplacement]] item.
