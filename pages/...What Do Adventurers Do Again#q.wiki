{{Quest Description|At [[Lan]]'s direction, Tiantian of the Adventurers' Guild has been put in charge of distributing commissions, but she has no idea what sort of commissions she should be giving out to adventurers...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Lan)
:'''Lan:''' Oh, you're here. I can see you've been on quite a few adventures recently.
:'''Lan:''' As it happens, I do have some matters that require an experienced adventuring hand to resolve.
:'''Lan:''' If you're interested, go look for Tiantian. I've delegated the task of distributing commissions to her.
:{{DIcon}} What about you?
:'''Lan:''' Me? Nothing's come up that interests me so far, and at a time like this... the Adventurers' Guild needs someone to hold the fort.
:'''Lan:''' Alright, then. If you'd like to take this task on, go look for Tiantian. She needs to grow up sometime, anyway...

;(Talk to Lan again)
:'''Lan:''' Was there anything else?
:{{DIcon}} Have you found that sword of yours?
:'''Lan:''' ...Huh, to think you still remember that. Unfortunately, no. I still don't have the foggiest idea where it might be.
:'''Lan:''' It seems I'm still at square one, waiting for things to happen.
:'''Lan:''' If anything related to that matter crops up, I might come looking for you &mdash; When that happens, I'll be counting on you.
----
;(After finding Tiantian)
:'''Tiantian:''' A&mdash;Are you an adventurer? Are you here to accept commissions?
:'''Tiantian:''' Uh, please... wait a moment, let me see what I have here... "Speed Glider," "Outdoor Survival Experience Guide," "Free Climbing Instructor Wanted..."
:{{DIcon}} That doesn't sound like the Adventurers' Guild...
:'''Tiantian:''' I know, and Lan says so too! But all the adventures I've read about in books were something like this...
:'''Tiantian:''' If I don't give out these commissions, what should I give out, then...
:{{DIcon}} Something like "beat up monsters," perhaps?
:'''Tiantian:''' I&mdash;Isn't that dangerous? I mean, there are a lot of them around Lisha, and they are a threat to passers-by.
:'''Tiantian:''' But normal people don't stand a chance against them. They might even get hurt...
:{{DIcon}} Well then, leave it to me.
::'''Tiantian:''' Can you really? Well.. Alright then, I'll leave it in your hands. I'll go back and discuss appropriate payment for your services with Lan.
:{{DIcon}} Adventurers are anything but ordinary.
::'''Tiantian:''' Is that so... W&mdash;Well then, I'll let you handle it. I'll discuss your payment with Lan later.

;(Talk to Tiantian again)
:'''Tiantian:''' Do all adventurers do these dangerous things?
:'''Tiantian:''' But what if they get injured...
----
;(Return to Tiantian after defeating the monsters)
:'''Tiantian:''' Eh? You're back already? Have you completed the commission?
:{{DIcon}} Done, and done!
:'''Tiantian:''' That's... really impressive. I went back to the Guild to reorganize our commissions based on the one I gave you.
:'''Tiantian:''' There was a whole mountain of commissions related to defeating monsters. So adventurers are supposed to do this sort of thing all the time...
:'''Tiantian:''' But other than monsters, there've been reports that say that Treasure Hoarders have been seen along the roads.
:'''Tiantian:''' Is this really also something the Adventurers' Guild should do? It feels like it falls under the job scope of the [[Millelith]]...
:{{DIcon}} We can do it.
::'''Tiantian:''' Huh. Adventurers can really do anything, it seems.
:{{DIcon}} If the money's good...
::'''Tiantian:''' Adventurers really are impressive... It seems like you can do almost anything.
:'''Tiantian:''' Well then, I will prepare adequate compensation for you &mdash; so please take this commission, too!
:'''Paimon:''' What, another one already? We haven't gotten our...
:'''Tiantian:''' There'll be further compensation! I've already discussed this with Lan. So as long as you complete the next commission, you'll receive further payment.
:{{DIcon}} Well, that sounds more like it.
:'''Tiantian:''' I'll be counting on you, then.
:'''Tiantian:''' Well, that's two commissions down.
:'''Tiantian:''' The secret method Lan taught me to "get adventurers to take commissions gladly" really works...

;(Talk to Tiantian again)
:'''Tiantian:''' I'll leave it to you then, adventurer!
:'''Tiantian:''' The secret method Lan taught me to "get adventurers to take commissions gladly" really works...
----
;(After defeating the Treasure Hoarders and returning to Tiantian)
:'''Tiantian:''' Have you finished the commissions?
:{{DIcon}} You bet I have.
:'''Tiantian:''' Wow... So this is the strength of an adventurer.
:'''Tiantian:''' Well, um, if you don't mind, could you answer some of my questions about adventurers and commissions?
:'''Tiantian:''' Other than defeating monsters, what other commissions do adventurers take?
:{{DIcon}} We also help people fix carts and houses.
:{{DIcon}} We help people pick flowers and catch fish.
:{{DIcon}} We send takeout and play with children.
:'''Tiantian:''' Whoa, doesn't that just mean that you adventurers do everything? I never knew.
:'''Tiantian:''' Thank you! I'll make note of it for sure... Ah yes, right. This is your repayment, please take it. It's as generous as can be, you know!
:'''Tiantian:''' Next time you're here to take commissions from me, I'll make sure to give you the best ones!
