|description    = A type of tree commonly found in Yilong Wharf famous for its bright crimson leaves. It is said that this tree was once seen as a symbol of somber, harsh austerity due to its leaves turning scarlet when the first frosts fell, and poets especially abhorred it. However, this view has undergone a dramatic shift in recent years. Poets have gradually come to realize that this stunning scenery blooming in the chilling cold has a tenacious and natural feel. For this reason, it has gained a new name&mdash; "Frostflower."
