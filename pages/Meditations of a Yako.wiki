==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* {{w|Yako (fox)|Yako}} (lit. "Wild Fox") refers to the lowest ranking fox spirits in the Japanese folklore.
* The Japanese name "Yako Setsu-Zen" literally means "A Wild Fox Teaches Zen."
** The wording is probably a reference to the Zen Buddhist idiom {{lang|''yako-zen''|ja={{wt|野狐禅}}|ja_lit=wild fox's Zen}}, meaning "pretentious monk" or "know-it-all person," originating from an episode in the Chinese Zen book ''{{w|The Gateless Barrier}}'' (early 13th century).
** It may be also a nod to the legend of the kitsune {{w|Hakuzōsu|Hakuzousu}}. Once upon a time, a kitsune transformed into a Zen monk in order to teach Zen Buddhism to a cruel hunter, only to find their disguise was unsuccessful. People felt great pity for the kitsune's death, and since then many shrines and temples have been dedicated to them.
*** Later, a playwright wrote a ''{{w|Kyōgen|kyougen}}''-style play on this legend, whose title {{lang|''Konkai''|ja=吼噦|ja_tl=Howling of Fox}} is used in the Chinese and Japanese names of the constellation [[Fox's Mooncall]].
