==Trivia==
* In feudal Japan, the term "Tenryou" referred to land directly held by the Shogun, as opposed to land held by a Daimyo ({{ja|大名}}, feudal lords, such as [[Hiiragi Shinsuke]]). The original term for this kind of land was {{Lang|shihaisho|ja=支配所}}; but since the Meiji period, the term {{Lang|Tenryou|ja=天領|ja_tl=Emperor's land}} has become synonymous, because the shogun's lands were returned to the emperor.<ref>{{w|Tokugawa_shogunate#Tenry%C5%8D,_gundai_and_daikan|Tokugawa shogunate: Tenryou, gundai and daikan}}</ref> However, in ''Genshin Impact'', there is no Inazuma emperor, so the use of this term indicates land directly governed by [[Ei]]. The [[Tenryou Commission]] is given great authority to manage the security of Tenryou and the public security of Inazuma, showing that Ei has great trust in the [[Kujou Clan]].
