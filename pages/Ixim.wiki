==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ixim:''' Hello there. Are you looking for something serious, or something casual?
:{{DIcon}} And what might you mean by that, precisely?
::'''Ixim:''' Ah, I'm referring to the content of [[Phlogiston]] Engravings.
::'''Ixim:''' Each pattern has its own unique meaning. Some are just graffiti, pure and simple, which is what I meant by "casual" work.
::'''Ixim:''' Others have a more profound meaning and can produce actual effects. These I'd call "serious."
::'''Ixim:''' But those are the minority, and I don't recommend that you carry a symbol weighed down with too much meaning on your person.
::'''Ixim:''' Graffiti is a more popular form of Phlogiston Engraving, and the satisfaction and fulfillment it provides far outweighs any practical uses.
:{{DIcon}} Not right now.
::'''Ixim:''' Alright. You stay safe, now.
