'''Phase Gates''' are ruin devices used for transportation that are primarily found on [[Seirai Island]] and [[Watatsumi Island]].

==Overview==
When two Phase Gates face each other, an energy route is established between them. When the player enters an active Phase Gate, they will be turned into a ball of what looks like [[Electro]], then travel to the linked Gate. Routes between linked Phase Gates never touch the ground, and they are also often not straight, even if a straight path is available. Some Phase Gate routes run through an [[Electroculus]].

Most Phase Gates can be rotated by interacting with them; [[Elemental Sight]] can be used to check the way the opposite door is facing. A linked Phase Gate will emit light and sound, while an unlinked one does not.

==Gameplay Notes==
While traveling using Phase Gates:
*The player can press the [[jump]] button to stop traveling prematurely, reappearing as the active [[character]] and jumping upwards as if on ground.
*Characters can be targeted and take damage from enemies while traveling. Taking damage that causes [[stagger]]ing will also end the travel immediately.
*If the route is blocked, such as by [[Geo Constructs]] or [[Thunder Barriers]], or if the route gets too close to something a character can walk on, such as frozen [[water]] or any water while in [[Kokomi]]'s [[Elemental Burst]], [[Nereid's Ascension]], the travel will also end immediately.
*All [[Talent]] effects, such as [[Xiangling]]'s [[Pyronado]], will persist even after the traveling begins. In the case of the Pyronado, it will circle around the active character as usual.
*If any ability, or switching of characters, is used after entering the Phase Gate &mdash; most likely due to lag &mdash; the travel will end immediately, and the usage of said ability or the switching of characters will carry on as normal.
*[[Photo Mode]] (the in-game camera feature) can be used as normal.

==Similar Mechanisms==
===Enkanomiya Phase Gate===
[[File:Enkanomiya Phase Gate.png|right|thumb|Enkanomiya Phase Gate]]
A variant of Phase Gates can be found in [[Enkanomiya]]. Instead of a gate, they look like circular, transparent blue-green portals. Players who enter these Phase Gates take on the appearance of a glowing blue orb.

Enkanomiya Phase Gates are similar to the standard ones, save that they cannot be rotated (and therefore are always active) and are often one-way, leading to areas where there may not be another Phase Gate present to go back to the starting point.

[[File:Silent Seeker of Knowledge Portal.png|right|thumb|Sumeru Phase Gate]]
===Sumeru Phase Gate===
A portal that seems to be another Phase Gate variant can be found in [[Sumeru]], in the [[Silent Seeker of Knowledge (Domain)|Silent Seeker of Knowledge]] [[Quest Domain]]. It appears as a circular, transparent yellow-green portal. Upon entering it, the player is turned into a glowing yellow-green orb with small wings but cannot cancel the travel, unlike other Phase Gates.

[[File:Fontaine Phase Gate.png|right|thumb|Fontaine Phase Gate]]
===Fontaine Phase Gate===
A phase gate variant that can be found in [[Fontaine]]. These are blue and watery in appearance, with a projection that points in the direction of travel. They are one-way, require interaction to activate, and cannot be canceled mid-travel. 

===??? Phase Gate===
Another phase gate variant can be found in [[??? (Fontaine)|???]]. These visually resemble [[Abyss]] portals, appearing as narrow fissures in reality that open wide when the player draws near. They occur in pairs, require interaction to activate, and can be canceled mid-travel.
