'''Phase Gates''' are ruin devices used for transportation that are found in [[Inazuma]], mostly on [[Seirai Island]] and [[Watatsumi Island]].

When two Phase Gates face each other, an energy route is established between them. When the player enters an active Phase Gate, they  will be turned into a ball of what looks like [[Electro]], then travel at high speeds to the linked Gate. Routes between Gates are often not straight, and do not touch the ground.

Most Phase Gates can be rotated by interacting with them; [[Elemental Sight]] can be used to check the way the opposite door is facing. A linked Phase Gate will emit light and sound, while an unlinked one does not.

A variant of Phase Gates can also commonly be found in [[Enkanomiya]]. These Phase Gates have the appearance of a glowing blue orb and share the same transportation usage as the standard ones, save that they cannot be rotated and therefore are always active, and are often one-way, leading to areas where there is no opposing Phase Gate present to go back to the starting point.

==Notes==
While traveling using Phase Gates:
*The player can press the jump button to stop traveling prematurely, reappearing as the active [[character]] and jumping upwards as if on ground.
*Characters can be targeted and take damage from enemies while traveling. Taking damage that causes [[stagger]]ing will also end the travel immediately.
*If the route is blocked, such as by [[Geo Constructs]] or [[Thunder Barriers]], or if the route gets too close to something a character can walk on, such as frozen [[water]] or any water while in [[Kokomi]]'s [[Elemental Burst]], [[Nereid's Ascension]], the travel will also end immediately.
*All [[Talent]] effects, such as [[Xiangling]]'s [[Pyronado]], will persist even after the traveling begins. In the case of the Pyronado, it will circle around the active character as usual.
*If any ability, or switching of characters, is used after entering the Phase Gate &mdash; most likely due to lag &mdash; the travel will end immediately, and the usage of said ability or the switching of characters will carry on as normal.
*[[Photo Mode]] (the in-game camera feature) can be used as normal.
