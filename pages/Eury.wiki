==Profile==
Eury seems to be quite indecisive, shown through her pacing around the shops in Mondstadt pondering what to get (such as [[Good Hunter]] and [[Mondstadt General Goods]]) and her shopping lines in the quest "[[A Little Booze Doesn't Hurt...]]" She also has a lack of self control when it comes to deciding what to buy and has bought items that were too expensive for her own good. Despite this, Eury seems to dislike alcohol and pushes against her [[Nimrod|husband]] drinking it.

{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Eury:''' Hello! Are you looking for anything in particular?
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror...
:;(Unlocked after [[A Long Shot]])
::'''Eury:''' *sigh* I only realized that those days of window-shopping and haggling with shopkeepers was "peace" when I experienced Stormterror's attack.
::'''Eury:''' I was originally planning to get my husband to kick his drinking habit...
::'''Eury:''' ...But in celebration of this hard-won peace, I suppose I can put it off for now.
:{{DIcon}} I'm just browsing.
::'''Eury:''' I envy those who can show restraint when shopping...
::'''Eury:''' Once I see an "on sale" sign, the Mora in my coin pouch goes away like the wind...
::'''Eury:''' *sigh* Have you seen my alcoholic scoundrel of a husband by any chance? I hope he's not scurried off to find a drink somewhere...
:{{DIcon}} What have you bought?
::'''Eury:''' Just now, a beautiful gemstone ring caught my attention.
::'''Eury:''' I accidentally picked it up. It was a huge mistake...
::'''Eury:''' I should've known. The price tag is something I can't afford...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Eury:''' Okay, goodbye! Hope you enjoy Mondstadt!
