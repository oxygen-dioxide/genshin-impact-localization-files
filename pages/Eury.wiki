==Profile==
Eury seems to be quite indecisive, shown through her pacing around the shops in Mondstadt pondering what to get (such as [[Good Hunter]] and [[Mondstadt General Goods]]) and her shopping lines in the quest "[[A Little Booze Doesn't Hurt...]]" She also has a lack of self control when it comes to deciding what to buy and has bought items that were too expensive for her own good. Despite this, Eury seems to dislike alcohol and pushes against her [[Nimrod|husband]] drinking it.
