==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Kirara says there are a few things she must investigate alone. As you're not a cat, curiosity won't kill you, so why not go with her...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Kirara)
:;(Before completing [[They Once Walked the Starry Sky]])
:::{{A|vo kwq001 1 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Hey! Are you guys already finished with everything in the Metropole?
:::{{A|vo kwq001 1 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' No need to prioritize me - there's just this place I really wanna go check out. Feel free to get back to me once you've got everything sorted out.
:;(After completing [[They Once Walked the Starry Sky]])
:::{{A|vo kwq001 1 kirara 04.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' So, are you all set? Ready to start investigating?
:{{DIcon}} We're all good!
::{{A|vo kwq001 1 kirara 03a 1.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Great! Then let's go!
:{{DIcon}} I'll be right back...
::{{A|vo kwq001 1 kirara 03b 1.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Sure. Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere!

;(Follow Kirara)
:{{A|vo kwq001 2 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' I've delivered packages all over, but I've never seen a mysterious fairytale world like this before!
:{{A|vo kwq001 2 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Looks like nobody has gotten around to repairing this house yet... Eek, even I wouldn't dare to sleep in there. It might suddenly collapse in on you.
:{{A|vo kwq001 2 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Nothing to see here, either... Maybe we can find someone to ask...
:{{A|vo kwq001 2 kirara 04.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Aha, over there! I bet we'll find some people there. Let's go take a look!

;(If the player strays off)
:{{A|vo kwq001 2 kirara 05.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' You wanna check out the area over there? Okay, I'll wait here for you.

;(Approach the houses with Kirara)
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Huh? I was sure there'd be people here...
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 chiefdetective 01.ogg}} '''???:''' ...There once was a goddess who ruled over fate. Before she died, she left three riddles for the kingdom she'd created.
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What... Who said that?
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 chiefdetective 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Long story short, on this day, a sentient feline, an outlander, and a, uh... diminutive pixie arrived on the scene.
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 chiefdetective 03.ogg}} '''???:''' They saw a narrow path off to the side.
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, but which side?
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Yeah, if you gave ambiguous instructions like that to a Komaniya Express courier, they'd give you the parcel right back and tell you to write the delivery address more clearly.
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 chiefdetective 04.ogg}} '''Narrator:''' ...Despite how obvious the answer was, the perplexed pixie and the flummoxed feline struggled to work it out. Hmm, although perhaps a small part of the blame could be attributed to my dull narration...
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 chiefdetective 05.ogg}} '''Narrator:''' Alright, let's try this again: *clears throat* "The path on the left-hand side seemed to give off an enticing fragrance, as if to say: 'This is the way to wealth and glory!'"
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Ooh! That sounds like the start of a good story! Then what, then what?

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 chiefdetective 06.ogg}} '''Narrator:''' At the end of the path, the motley crew would soon spot a secret stone room. A prophecy had once foretold of a marquis who shall one day venture inside, and thus it is named: The Future Marquis' Abode-To-Be.
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 chiefdetective 07.ogg}} '''Narrator:''' You like it? "The Future Marquis' Abode-To-Be..." Got a nice ring to it, doesn't it?
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 kirara 04.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' That was a little bit boastful...
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 chiefdetective 08.ogg}} '''Narrator:''' But! Before you continue, I must warn you of the danger that lies ahead! For example, under no circumstances should you sit on the chair in the center.
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 chiefdetective 09.ogg}} '''Narrator:''' Otherwise, the consequences could be... uh, a bit embarrassing.

;(Approach the cave before the above dialogue completes, optional)
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 chiefdetective 10.ogg}} '''Narrator:''' Uhh, are you sure you don't want to hear the rest?
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 kirara 05.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Meow! What's going on!?
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 chiefdetective 11.ogg}} '''Narrator:''' Hear me out, alright? I'm sorry for resorting to extreme measures, but I'm trying to help here.
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 chiefdetective 12.ogg}} '''Narrator:''' Don't worry, the fencing will disappear as soon as I'm done talking.
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 kirara 06.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' So are you some sort of fence-spawning [[youkai]]?
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 chiefdetective 13.ogg}} '''Narrator:''' I'll keep this brief. Firstly, the place ahead of you is a secret room whose purpose, per the legends, is to await the arrival of a certain "marquis." For that reason, it's called The Future Marquis' Abode-To-Be.
:{{A|vo kwq001 3 chiefdetective 14.ogg}} '''Narrator:''' Secondly, when you get inside, don't sit on the chair in the center, or bad things will happen. There, that's all. Off you go!
----
;(Enter the cave)
:{{A|vo kwq001 5 cappet 01.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Tsk, looks like we got some more time-wasters... Tune up and clear your throats &mdash; remember, we're supposed to talk like bards.
:{{A|vo kwq001 5 albizzi 01.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' *clears throat* So many summers, winters, springs, and falls, and now at last a hero hither strides.
:{{A|vo kwq001 5 boborano 01.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' This realm knows not what lies beyond its walls, its secrets mystify the world outside.
:{{A|vo kwq001 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, new voices? Who are they?

;(Approach the table and the three chairs)
:{{A|vo kwq001 5 boborano 03.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' As golden sunlight fills the firmament, {{Color|buzzword|the tabletop}} engrosses your attent. Perhaps, perchance, peruse these pages thence &mdash; they surely represent no ill intent.

;(Idle for some time without interacting with the document, optional)<!--may trigger even after reading document-->
:{{A|vo kwq001 5 cappet 02a.ogg}} {{A|vo kwq001 5 cappet 02b.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Why isn't {{MC|m=he|f=she}} reading {{Color|buzzword|the files on the desk}}? Hey Boborano, maybe quit showing off and try using words he'll actually understand?
:{{A|vo kwq001 5 boborano 05.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' I can either rhyme like a bard, or I can curse like a sailor. And right now, Cappet, you are seriously tempting me towards the latter.

;(Continue to idle without interacting with the document, optional)
:{{A|vo kwq001 5 albizzi 03.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' Um, Cappet, forgive me for breaking the rhyme scheme for a second. But I wanna hear your take on this.
:{{A|vo kwq001 5 albizzi 04a.ogg}} {{A|vo kwq001 5 albizzi 04b.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' So any outsider who comes in here would surely see {{Color|buzzword|the documents on the table}}, right? Unless {{MC|m=he|f=she}} was visually impaired. And unless {{MC|m=he|f=she}}'s got tinnitus or something, {{MC|m=he'd|f=she'd}} definitely have heard what we were saying.
:{{A|vo kwq001 5 albizzi 05.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' All I'm trying to say is, if this poor person can't see or hear properly... I just feel kinda sorry for them.
:{{A|vo kwq001 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, we hear you loud and clear! So watch it!

;(Break the crates or vases near the table or chair, optional)
:{{A|vo kwq001 5 albizzi 02.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' With wood and earthen wares strewn all around, the demon-feline's fury can't be quelled, reducing them to rubble on the ground, she finds the vessels vacant save for... uhh, air?
:{{A|vo kwq001 5 boborano 04.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' She finds long gone the gems that once they held.
:{{A|vo kwq001 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Are they describing how we broke the boxes and jars?
:{{A|vo kwq001 5 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Who are you calling demon-feline!?

;(Sit on the chair in the center, optional)
:{{A|vo kwq001 5 boborano 02.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' Stop the poem, we have a situation... Something's up with this person.
:{{A|vo kwq001 5 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' {{Traveler}}, are you alright?
:{{DIcon}} Turns out... there's glue...
:{{Black Screen|You try to stand up, but the glue is holding you firmly in place...}}
:{{A|vo kwq001 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' C'mon, you can do it! Th&mdash;This can't be how our story ends...!
:{{DIcon}} (Try to stand up)
:{{Black Screen|You manage to partially un-stick yourself. The issue isn't that you can't break free &mdash; it's more that you don't want to tear your clothes in the process. They mean a lot to you.}}
:{{A|vo kwq001 5 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Can I give you a hand? Or a tail, even?
:{{DIcon}} (Keep trying to stand up)
:{{Black Screen|You finally free yourself and stand up, clothes intact.}}
:;(The [[superglue]] is removed from the chair)

;(Leave the cave before reading the document, optional)
::{{A|vo kwq001 5 boborano 06.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' The weary heroes falter in their quest, for home they long, for friend and kin they yearn. These thoughts in mind, they pause and deem it best, to cease this foolish errand, and return&mdash;
::{{A|vo kwq001 5 cappet 03.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Rhyme-time is over! They've already gone!
::&nbsp;
:;(Re-enter the cave)
::{{A|vo kwq001 5 cappet 04.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Aha, they're back. It seems our outlanders pine for {{Color|buzzword|the desktop documents}} after all.

:{{A|vo kwq001 6 cappet 01.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Captivated by the epic poetry, and enthralled by the outstanding storytelling, the outlanders knew what their next objective was:
:{{A|vo kwq001 6 cappet 02.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Namely, to remove the {{Color|buzzword|clockwork key from the raised platform}} up ahead.
:{{A|vo kwq001 6 boborano 01.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' Cappet, I just realized. You said we all had to speak like bards, but every time you open your mouth, I don't hear any rhymes.
:{{A|vo kwq001 6 albizzi 01.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' Yeah, I noticed that too. It's one standard for us, and another for you. That's not fair, Cappet.

;(Idle for some time away from the key, optional)
:{{A|vo kwq001 6 albizzi 03.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' Perhaps the outlanders are worried that something drastic will happen the moment they remove {{Color|buzzword|it}}.
:{{A|vo kwq001 6 albizzi 04.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' Maybe that's why they're investigating the area thoroughly first. Can't fault them for that. I'm wondering if we can take advantage of this downtime to discuss whether we really need to keep this up&mdash;
:{{A|vo kwq001 6 cappet 06.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' If you guys don't wanna put on a voice and speak in verse, be my guest. Just don't blame me for your own poetic incompetence.

:{{A|vo kwq001 6 albizzi 02.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' Oh no you don't. I wrote that line! Don't start plagiarizing me just because you can't take a bit of criticism.
:{{A|vo kwq001 6 cappet 04.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Look, let's not put form over content here. It's not about the rhymes, it's about making sure the outlanders focus on {{Color|buzzword|the clockwork key on that platform}}...
:{{A|vo kwq001 6 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' I told you already, stop calling me demon-feline!

;(Leave the cave before pulling out the clockwork key, optional)
::{{A|vo kwq001 6 boborano 07.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' Cappet's blatant unprofessionalism and lackluster performance began to annoy the outsiders.
::{{A|vo kwq001 6 boborano 08.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' He decided to step out to get some air and come back with a change of attitude.

::{{A|vo kwq001 6 together 01.ogg}} '''Boborano & Albizzi:''' My gosh, a poem from Cappet! I can't believe my ears!
----
;(Idle around the key, optional)
:{{A|vo kwq001 6 boborano 02.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' As the outlander stands before {{Color|buzzword|the clockwork key}}, they are overcome by a sudden urge to set it free.
:{{A|vo kwq001 6 boborano 03.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' ...Also, Cappet, that'll be my last rhyming line. I'm not writing any more poetry until you apologize.
:{{A|vo kwq001 6 cappet 05.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' What does it matter, anyway? I've lost count of how many people have tried this before. No one's getting that key out.

;(Interact with the key)
:{{DIcon|Gear}} Pull Hard
:{{A|vo kwq001 6 boborano 04.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' Strong as stone, firm as steel. The outlander pulls, but it does not yield.
:{{A|vo kwq001 6 cappet 07.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' This has happened many times before. But this time is different. A thought enters the outlander's mind: "{{Color|buzzword|Attack, attack}}! First weaken the structure, then seize the treasure."

;(Idle before attacking the key, optional)
:{{A|vo kwq001 6 albizzi 05.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' The outlander takes a moment to wipe the sweat from their hands, then braces themselves as they grasp their sword. Only now are they ready to {{Color|buzzword|attack}}. Although, a mallet would have made the job easier.
:{{A|vo kwq001 6 albizzi 06.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' Cappet, it looks we have a few moments to spare, and we're still waiting on that apology.

;(Idle after attacking the key a few times, optional)
:{{A|vo kwq001 6 cappet 08a.ogg}} {{A|vo kwq001 6 cappet 08b.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' The outlander's comrades urge {{MC|m=him|f=her}} on: "Keep up {{Color|buzzword|the attack}}! Don't give up halfway!"

:{{A|vo kwq001 6 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' But seriously, I'm not about to cheerlead for someone attacking an inanimate object. That's just embarrassing.
:{{A|vo kwq001 6 albizzi 07.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' Cappet. Speaking of not giving up halfway, shouldn't that also apply to our performance as bards?
:{{A|vo kwq001 6 boborano 05.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' I wouldn't give him that much credit. He didn't give up halfway &mdash; he quit before he began.

:{{A|vo kwq001 6 boborano 06.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' The attack now over, only one final step remains.

;(Interact with the key)

:{{A|vo kwq001 7 cappet 01.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' But alas, as was the case for all those who had come before, the key still did not move an inch&mdash; Wait, what? They got it out!?
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 boborano 01.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' Yes! Finally! C'mon, move your butts &mdash; and your legs, assuming they're still in working order. It's showtime!
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 albizzi 01.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' No hard feelings about your lack of poetic contributions?
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 cappet 02.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Oh, let it go!

;(Approach Albizzi, Boborano, and Cappet)
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 cappet 03.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Ah, welcome, esteemed and noble outlander. Allow us to introduce ourselves.
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 albizzi 02.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' We represent the three great clans of this realm, having been selected as its authorized historical supervisors.
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 boborano 02.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' Our purpose being to await the arrival of ones such as yourselves, who shall remove the clockwork key.
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 cappet 04.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' My name is&mdash;
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' You're Cappet, he's Albizzi, and that's Boborano. Right?
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' You've done so much talking that we can already tell you apart by your voices.
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aren't we missing someone, though? The guy who led us here to begin with?
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 cappet 05.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Who?
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 chiefdetective 01.ogg}} '''Narrator:''' *clears throat* And thus was born the long-awaited fellowship, destined to uncover the truth of the past. Allow me to quote, if I may: "In the history of Constellation Metropole, a new page has begun."
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Him.
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 boborano 03.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' Well, there's no fourth person, so which of you is the ventriloquist? Come on, out with it.
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 albizzi 03.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' We've never heard that voice before. But he sounds like he'd be good at reading bedtime stories to children.
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 cappet 06.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Whoever it is, I don't know and I don't care. Forget about him. We have far more important things to focus on, like where our journey goes from here.
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 albizzi 04.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' That key you hold is the pivot point about which the past and present of the Metropole revolve. However, between our three clans there is some... dispute over the historical record.
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 boborano 04.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' Each clan has its own version of history, detailing the clan's origins and the tale of the dragon of old. And unfortunately, we don't know which one is the truth.
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Dragon? You mean, the one that's been acting up recently?
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 boborano 05.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' Oh &mdash; no, not that one, you adorable little pixie. When I say "dragon of old"&mdash;
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 cappet 07.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' ...He means, a dragon that would be really, really old if it was still with us today, but it was defeated in ancient times. The new one has nothing to do with our clan history.
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 kirara 04.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Uhh, was that supposed to be a joke...? Anyway, so you've been waiting for someone to remove the key so you can finally explore the truth of the past?
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 boborano 06.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' Not just explore it, but argue incessantly about it. Honestly, I don't care that much. Cappet's the one who's always bothering us about it.
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 albizzi 05.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' What we need to figure out is who resolved the dragon crisis. We have to know that before we can decide which is the Supreme Clan.
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 cappet 08.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' The moment you removed the key from where it was lodged, you became the Honorary Marquis. We humbly beseech you, noble outlander&mdash;
:{{DIcon}} Call me {{Traveler}}.
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 cappet 09.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Noble Marquis {{Traveler}}, we ask you to help us &mdash; you, and your talking puss-in-boots, and the pale, floating pixie.
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 kirara 05.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Puss-in-boots, are you serious!? It's better than "demon-feline," but still...
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 albizzi 06.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' Embrace it, my friend, embrace it. Most cats don't wear boots or speak, do they?
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 kirara 06.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' I'm not even a "cat"! I'm a nekomata! Now that you know the word, I expect you to use it!
:{{A|vo kwq001 7 cappet 10.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Please allow me to lead you all to a sacred memorial site. It will be much easier to explain what needs to be done once we are there.
:{{Black Screen|Cappet leads the party to the so-called "sacred memorial site."}}
:{{A|vo kwq001 8 cappet 01.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' This place is sacred to my clan. It is where our brave forefathers once took up arms against the dragon of old.
:{{A|vo kwq001 8 cappet 02.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' After a bitter battle that dragged on for many days and nights, finally our forefathers fought the dragon into submission, and it fled. ...They took turns, though. Some forefathers worked the day shift, while others worked the night shift.
:{{DIcon}} So they worked shifts while the poor dragon had to work around the clock?
:{{A|vo kwq001 8 cappet 03.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' So they say. It's just a legend though.
:{{A|vo kwq001 8 boborano 01.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' Wait a second! Did I just hear you admit that your clan's history is just a legend?
:{{A|vo kwq001 8 cappet 04.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' History, legend &mdash; who cares? My clan was definitely courageous, that's the point. That's the truth.
:{{A|vo kwq001 8 cappet 05.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' And isn't the truth what we've all been arguing about non-stop for all these years?
:{{A|vo kwq001 8 chiefdetective 01.ogg}} '''Narrator:''' Cappet's words gave {{Traveler}} food for thought: Could it be that "the truth" in a fictional world is equivalent to "fiction" in the real world?
:{{A|vo kwq001 8 chiefdetective 02.ogg}} '''Narrator:''' But that would have to wait. Apparently, Cappet was not alone in his pilgrimage to this sacred site &mdash; unwanted company had arrived.
:{{A|vo kwq001 8 chiefdetective 03.ogg}} '''Narrator:''' {{Traveler}} and the talking cat&mdash; Ahem, nekomata decided to teach them some manners.

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Defeat the first wave of enemies)
:{{A|vo kwq001 9 cappet 01.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Wow, a true display of heroism and valor... It was as if the spirits of my ancestors were fighting through you...
:{{A|vo kwq001 9 boborano 01.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' Here's a thought, could be wrong, but: Maybe Marquis {{Traveler}} is a lot more powerful than your ancestors.
:{{A|vo kwq001 9 cappet 02.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Technically, by saying that... Aren't you implicitly acknowledging that my clan's history is, in fact, true?

;(After defeating the second wave of enemies)
:{{A|vo kwq001 10 cappet 01.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Your martial prowess and show of courage are a more vivid re-enactment of my ancestors' feats that suit the modern aesthetic.
:{{A|vo kwq001 10 cappet 02.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Now, let's get down to business.
:{{A|vo kwq001 10 cappet 03.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' As we all know, time is but an illusion. Time may flow line-by-line, page-by-page, or frame-by-frame. But usually, it flows in the form of springs and gears.
:{{A|vo kwq001 10 albizzi 01.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' And that clockwork key you have in your hand can turn back time, and make the past reappear.
:{{A|vo kwq001 10 boborano 01.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' Actually, my view is that the illusion of time is more of a problem of consciousness. Gears power the body, while the body is the vessel of the conscious mind.
:{{A|vo kwq001 10 boborano 02.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' But the mind cannot understand the dimension of time, so we experience instead an endless continuum of moments as the pinion of now turns along the rack of ages.
:{{A|vo kwq001 10 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' I... I'm getting flashbacks to when I was delivering packages to the Sumeru Akademiya...
:{{A|vo kwq001 10 chiefdetective 01.ogg}} '''Narrator:''' A teacher once asked Albizzi what his greatest fear was, and he replied: "dragons." Boborano was asked the same question. He replied "time," and repeated the argument we just heard.
:{{A|vo kwq001 10 chiefdetective 02.ogg}} '''Narrator:''' The teacher then turned to Cappet, and posed the same question. He replied "Boborano."
:{{A|vo kwq001 10 cappet 04.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' The manuscript that tells the truth of the historical record, the blueprint to all of creation, the work of the great mage themselves &mdash; it can be found at the beginning of the gear-rack, and on the very first page of the book.
:{{A|vo kwq001 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Paimon didn't follow all that. But basically, you're just saying that we need to put the key in and turn it all the way back?
:{{A|vo kwq001 10 cappet 05.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Exactly. It is said that in the beginning, the [[Goddess of Creation]] took the [[Goddess of Fate]]'s manuscript as a blueprint, placed it under the [[Goddess of Prophecy]]'s starry realm, and generated the world from a few magic arrays.
:{{A|vo kwq001 10 cappet 06.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' So in a few moments, when the great clockwork key turns the local time here back to the very beginning, we will restore the magic arrays back to their original configurations.
:{{A|vo kwq001 10 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Hold on, isn't stealing part of the blueprint of creation a little dangerous? Also, how are we supposed to know the original configurations of the magic arrays?
:{{A|vo kwq001 10 cappet 07.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Ah, well the general shapes of the configurations have been passed down over the ages. They now form the family crests of each of our clans. So you'll just need to reference my family crest, and join the dots accordingly.
::{{Readable|title=Shape of Valor
|text=[[File:Shape of Valor.png|300px]]}}
:{{A|vo kwq001 10 cappet 08.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' To address your other concern... When the house has already been built, do you really think that taking away the construction crew and blueprint will cause it to collapse?
:{{A|vo kwq001 10 chiefdetective 03.ogg}} '''Narrator:''' {{Traveler}}-Marquis prepares to insert the great clockwork key into the nearby keyhole.

;(After the cutscene)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Cappet:''' Connect the lines to draw the family crest...

:{{A|vo kwq001 13 cappet 01.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Where's your clan's pedestal? Lemme guess, you hid it away in advance to save yourself the embarrassment of having it exposed as a fake?

:{{A|vo kwq001 13 boborano 03.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' My clan's claim to fame is that we outwitted the dragon of old and stole its treasure. Ergo, all articles of value that we own &mdash; including the pedestal for the clockwork key &mdash; lie behind that door.
:{{A|vo kwq001 13 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' So next step is, open the door?
:{{A|vo kwq001 13 boborano 04.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' Almost. There's one step before that. The door is protected by a smart interrogation system. We have to answer its questions, and if we get them wrong, it will alert law enforcement.

-->Wise Antonio, in the basement<br><!--
-->of the crumbling house,<br><!--
-->began reading the ancient book<br><!--
-->he had found. His oil<br><!--
-->lamp shook from time to time<br><!--
-->as the swaying structure above-ground<br><!--
-->collapsed.<br><!--
-->The village was to be symbolically razed<br><!--
-->by the dragon, and he<br><!--
-->had been chosen by the dragon,<br><!--
-->for he had not returned home. But<br><!--
-->Antonio did not care.<br><!--
-->He only wished to study<br><!--
-->the book the old lady had given him<br><!--
-->on the bridge he passed today.<br><!--
-->This book was titled the<br><!--
-->"Radiant{{Obf|1}}C{{Obf|1}}arter," and within<br><!--
-->was re{{Obf|1}}or{{Obf|2}}d all the rules that<br><!--
-->every bei{{Obf|3}}in Simulanka<br><!--
-->must follow. It was written in the language<br><!--
-->of world's creation at the very start,<br><!--
-->and if Antonio was not possessed of<br><!--
-->extraordinary wisdom, and deciphered this<br><!--
-->primordial text, there would have been<br><!--
-->no study to be had.<br><!--
-->This book recorded no solutions<br><!--
-->as to resolving the difficulty<br><!--
-->that Constellation Satellite<br><!--
-->presently faced, nor did it contain<br><!--
-->any hexes that could aid<br><!--
-->Antonio in repairing his own home.<br><!--
-->But he knew<br><!--
-->that wisdom was the mightiest thing<br><!--
-->in the world.<br><!--
-->The morning light shone through<br><!--
-->the ruins of his home, and the neighboring<br><!--
-->blacksmith and chubby chief took<br><!--
-->great pains to get rid of the house's<br><!--
-->wreckage, which blocked the basement hatch.<br><!--
-->With dark circles about his eyes,<br><!--
-->Antonio said to the chubby chief:<br><!--
-->"I shall defeat the dragon.<br><!--
-->I will return soon."<br><!--
-->"Are you sure you're alright?<br><!--
-->You don't look like you got any sleep."<br><!--
-->"Just smoke from the oil lamp.<br><!--
-->Don't worry about it."<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->The dragon sat atop a mountain<br><!--
-->of treasures, gazing down<br><!--
-->at insignificant little Antonio walking<br><!--
-->closer. Flames gathered<br><!--
-->in its throat, preparing to burn<br><!--
-->the area one centimeter before him,<br><!--
-->all the better to scare this puny,<br><!--
-->foolish creature away.<br><!--
-->"Halt! I'm a qualified 2nd-class Meister!<br><!--
-->The 'Radiant Charter' states that<br><!--
-->should I refuse a duel, you cannot<br><!--
-->use force."<br><!--
-->This restriction did indeed exist,<br><!--
-->and so the wicked dragon<br><!--
-->swallowed its flames whole &mdash; ah, how it<br><!--
-->dreaded going to the toilet tomorrow.<br><!--
-->Antonio, for his part, had not expected<br><!--
-->that the 2nd-class<br><!--
-->rust-clearing Meister qualification exam he<br><!--
-->had taken on a lark would come in useful.<br><!--
-->"And since I am a 2nd-class<br><!--
-->Meister, I propose<br><!--
-->a duel of riddles. You cannot refuse!"<br><!--
-->Now, Simulanka had just such a law, mainly<br><!--
-->for the benefit of sphinxes, old sages, and<br><!--
-->princesses who wished to make life hard for<br><!--
-->others. The evil dragon had not expected<br><!--
-->this rule to catch up with it.<br><!--
-->"I shall ask the first question:<br><!--
-->My house sold for 8,000 Mora yesterday<br><!--
-->But I thought there was room<br><!--
-->to raise the price, so I<br><!--
-->bought it back for 9,000,<br><!--
-->planning to sell it for 10,000.<br><!--
-->How much Mora did I lose in the end?"<br><!--
-->The dragon laughed in contempt.<br><!--
-->"What's so hard about that?<br><!--
-->You could have waited until<br><!--
-->it hit 10,000 to make your move,<br><!--
-->But you sold for 8,<br><!--
-->and bought for 9, so you<br><!--
-->lost 1,000 Mora, that you<br><!--
-->could have earned instead!"<br><!--
-->"Wrong. You burned my house<br><!--
-->down yesterday, and I couldn't<br><!--
-->sell it in time, so I've lost far more."<br><!--
-->"S&mdash;Sorry. I mean,<br><!--
-->I do have to burn a house, and you<br><!--
-->happened not to be home,<br><!--
-->so I might as well hit one that doesn't<br><!--
-->result in any loss of life."<br><!--
-->"Now that you've lost this<br><!--
-->contest, I have the right<br><!--
-->to loot of the same value<br><!--
-->as your life, minus 1 Mora.<br><!--
-->And considering that<br><!--
-->you've burned my house, I can<br><!--
-->seek damages. Let's assume that<br><!--
-->my house is worth just 1 Mora...<br><!--
-->Well, then, wicked dragon,<br><!--
-->you know what to do with yourself."<br><!--
-->"P&mdash;Please spare me. I'll give you<br><!--
-->anything!"<br><!--
-->"Your words, not mine," Antonio said<br><!--
-->as he pulled out a contract<br><!--
-->he had written long ago.<br><!--
-->...<br><!--
-->Thus did Antonio use his<br><!--
-->wisdom to take all the evil<br><!--
-->dragon's treasures.<br><!--
-->The dragon, devastated, would never<br><!--
-->again return to attack<br><!--
-->Constellation Satellite,<br><!--
-->where Antonio lived.<br><!--
-->Many years later, a child asked Antonio:<br><!--
-->"You sold your place for 8,000<br><!--
-->and spent 9,000 buying it back,<br><!--
-->so it looks like you actually<br><!--
-->did lose 1,000 Mora?"<br><br><!--

:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Red Toy Figure:''' So many Giant Guards...
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Red Toy Figure:''' They'll kick everyone out...

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo kwq001 16 chiefdetective 01.ogg}} '''Narrator:''' The cohort of truth-seekers followed Albizzi to his clan's sacred site. They arrived to the sight of a giant guard towering over them.
:{{A|vo kwq001 16 albizzi 01.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' Up ahead is my clan's gigantified guard. He can be a little pig-headed, and he's incredibly strong. Your weapons won't even scratch him.
:{{A|vo kwq001 16 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Wait, but wasn't Cappet's clan the one that's all about strength? So... What do you guys believe in then?
:{{A|vo kwq001 16 albizzi 02.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' Oh, the guard is one of Cappet's people. Size is a coveted trait in the clan of strength, after all.
:{{A|vo kwq001 16 albizzi 03.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' Mine is the clan of empathy, and our key contribution is... growth serum!
:{{A|vo kwq001 16 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' ...What's empathetic about that?
:{{A|vo kwq001 16 albizzi 04.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' Our ancestors believed that, just maybe, the dragon of old didn't mean us any harm at all. Perhaps the dragon simply didn't notice us, since we are so very tiny.
:{{A|vo kwq001 16 albizzi 05.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' So they drank the growth serum, and grew even larger than the dragon. Then, they sat the dragon down, calmly explained their perspective, and eventually taught it how to empathize.
:{{A|vo kwq001 16 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Uhhh...
:{{A|vo kwq001 16 albizzi 06.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' The serum isn't what it once was, though. Nowadays, it doesn't make you grow all that much, and it actually makes you lose your empathy... So, I advise we take a detour.

:{{A|vo kwq001 17 chiefdetective 01.ogg}} '''Narrator:''' Despite Albizzi's words of caution, somebody, no doubt, has other ideas. "Surely we could avoid a conflict with the guard," they think to themselves, "if we could just try to understand one another."

-->"Don't worry about us."<br><!--
-->And so, the two best friends<br><!--

-->The evil dragon trembled<br><!--

-->That was how they accidentally squashed<br><!--

:{{A|vo kwq001 20 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So Paimon was worried she'd look stupid for asking the question.
:{{A|vo kwq001 20 boborano 02.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' It's not a stupid question at all, my dear little pixie. While I did postulate that different truths may coexist, there is an issue when it comes to these three truths in particular.
:{{A|vo kwq001 20 boborano 03.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' The problem is, all three truths are the history of the exact same thing &mdash; namely, the dragon and the Metropole's origins. Yet all three bear the signature, showing that they're genuine.

:{{A|vo kwq001 22 boborano 01.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' I don't know. I doubt anyone here in Simulanka could make sense of it. All we do know is that any manuscript bearing her signature has to be valid.

:{{DIcon}} Y&mdash;Yes...
:{{A|vo kwq001 24 detectivetough 03.ogg}} '''Detective:''' My sincere condolences. You were travel companions, right? It's a real tragedy... I'm afraid he'll be out cold for another hour and a half, at least.
:{{A|vo kwq001 24 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Huh?
:{{A|vo kwq001 24 detectivetough 04.ogg}} '''Detective:''' I know. It's despicable. Hitting someone in the back of the head is the second-worst act of cruelty there is. The first being replacing their gear oil with extra-strong glue.

:{{A|vo kwq001 24 detectivetough 05.ogg}} '''Detective:''' His gears, metal frame, and shell are all still in excellent condition. It's just his energy supply that's been all messed up...
:{{A|vo kwq001 24 detectivetough 06.ogg}} '''Detective:''' Wait, but... Surely you can't be suggesting that just because Cappet isn't broken, there's no need to go looking for the culprit...?

:{{A|vo kwq001 24 detectivetough 07.ogg}} '''Detective:''' ...Unfortunately, this is rapidly turning into a cold case. There's no evidence, and no witnesses. Unless there's an official clockwork pedestal of the Goddess of Prophecy around here somewhere...

;(After watching the replay)
:{{A|vo kwq001 26 detectivetough 01.ogg}} '''Detective:''' Well, that clears it up. Cappet was walking along the street, then he suddenly collapsed. He was faking it.
:{{A|vo kwq001 26 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What, so case closed? Aren't you supposed to investigate a little more first?
:{{A|vo kwq001 26 detectivetough 02.ogg}} '''Detective:''' We literally replayed the crime scene and saw it with our own eyes. There's no need for any evidence-gathering or powers of deduction now. Besides, maybe the truth is inherently strange by nature.
:{{A|vo kwq001 26 detectivetough 03.ogg}} '''Detective:''' Like how Constellation Metropole has three histories, each of which is the truth.
:{{A|vo kwq001 26 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' But didn't you say Cappet was struck in the back of the head and knocked unconscious?
:{{A|vo kwq001 26 detectivetough 04.ogg}} '''Detective:''' For all I know, he could have bashed his head against the toilet bowl before leaving the house. Then walked here in a daze before finally passing out.
:{{A|vo kwq001 26 detectivetough 05.ogg}} '''Detective:''' As for why he might have done that... My guess is:
:{{A|vo kwq001 26 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' ...Is...?
:{{A|vo kwq001 26 detectivetough 06.ogg}} '''Detective:''' With the Supreme Clan question left unanswered, and the tension in Constellation Metropole suddenly wiped away, he was looking to create a new source of conflict.
:{{A|vo kwq001 26 detectivetough 07.ogg}} '''Detective:''' Only then would the city feel alive again.
:{{A|vo kwq001 26 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... Do we really think he's capable of that, though? Sounds like a pretty complicated conspiracy for the average Simulanka resident...
:{{A|vo kwq001 26 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' {{Traveler}}, something about the crime scene isn't sitting right with me... It just seems unnatural.
:{{A|vo kwq001 26 kirara 04.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Also, anything outside of the immediate area won't have appeared in the replay. Is it possible that something was missing from the scene?
:{{A|vo kwq001 26 kirara 05.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Why don't we search the area?
:{{A|vo kwq001 26 detectivetough 08.ogg}} '''Detective:''' Wait, what are you doing?

:{{A|vo kwq001 35 kirara 05.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' You call that a tall wall? In {{Color|buzzword|Urgent Neko-Parcel}} mode, I'll scale it in no time!

;(Follow the detective to the top of the wall)
:{{A|vo kwq001 35 chiefdetective 09.ogg}} '''Detective:''' I'm beat. I surrender.

;(After catching up to the detective)
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 kirara 01.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' You've got nowhere left to run!
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 01.ogg}} '''Detective:''' Alright, I confess.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That was fast!
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 02.ogg}} '''Detective:''' Getting caught by you here was a backup plan. I don't know if what I've done will make things better or not.
:;(The detective's title changes from Chief Consulting Detective to Narrator)
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 03.ogg}} '''Detective:''' Time to come clean. I am the narrator, the one who's been guiding you all this time.
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, I figured...
::{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 04a 1.ogg}} '''Detective:''' Hahaha, okay. I guess my voice-acting skills have some room for improvement.
:{{DIcon}} Gasp! Shock! My mind is blown!
::{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 04b 1.ogg}} '''Detective:''' You're overdoing it a little bit there.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 05.ogg}} '''Detective:''' Anyway, I only did what I did because&mdash;
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why are you suddenly spilling the beans?
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 06.ogg}} '''Detective:''' I poured my heart and soul into all this. I was worried you wouldn't ask.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 07.ogg}} '''Detective:''' The truth is, I was one of the first conscious beings ever made by the Goddess of Creation. And I've known for a long time that this whole world is just a fairytale, written by the Goddess of Fate.
:{{DIcon}} ...!
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 08.ogg}} '''Detective:''' I know they say that fairytales are just made up for kids to read. But I refuse to believe that fairytales are just fictional stories, and nothing more.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 09.ogg}} '''Detective:''' The reason why Constellation Metropole has three origin stories is that the Goddess of Fate wrote three drafts, and couldn't decide which one she liked best.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 10.ogg}} '''Detective:''' Then, her cat trod all over them and they all got crumpled together. So the three worlds just sort of folded into one.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 11.ogg}} '''Detective:''' The Goddess of Fate was torn between them anyway, since she couldn't decide which ending was best for the dragon or the kids.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 12.ogg}} '''Detective:''' So when she saw what the cat had done, she simply decided to go with all three.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who'd have thought... But what does any of this have to do with what you did?
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 13.ogg}} '''Detective:''' You're not a fictional character, so you couldn't hope to understand my sorrow. Honestly, I don't think there's anyone in all of Simulanka who would understand.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 14.ogg}} '''Detective:''' Every day that I experience, every interaction I have with another person... Is it really all just a work of fiction?
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 15.ogg}} '''Detective:''' The only reason the three great clans wanted to find out the truth was for the pointless task of electing the Supreme Clan. I thought that once they'd learned the truth, it might make them curious enough to investigate further.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 16.ogg}} '''Detective:''' But as it turned out, they just... accepted it. And carried on living the same old lives.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 17.ogg}} '''Detective:''' I have to motivate them to keep looking for answers, now that they think they've learned the truth. I have to make them uncomfortable with the superficial explanation that they took at face value.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 18.ogg}} '''Detective:''' And I have to figure out, once and for all, while you real people from the outside world are still here: Are we real?
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw...
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 19.ogg}} '''Detective:''' That's my full confession. Time for you to take me back. I'm guessing I'll probably be forced to make a public apology, then sentenced to half a day in solitary confinement. I definitely deserve half a day.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 20.ogg}} '''Detective:''' Oh, also, pass this message onto Cappet, Boborano, and Albizzi, if you could: The great clockwork key was originally put in place jointly by the ancestors of the three clans.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 21.ogg}} '''Detective:''' If the three of them had had any ability to cooperate whatsoever, they'd have been able to remove it by themselves.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 22.ogg}} '''Detective:''' Over all these years, not once have they ever tried removing it together.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 m 01.ogg}} '''{{tt|???|???}}:''' Oh, my poor child. There's one thing you've been mistaken about this whole time.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 kirara 02.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Aah! Whose voice is that!? ...Detective, was that you? Your voice acting's actually pretty good.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 m 02.ogg}} '''???:''' The reason fairytales are suitable for children is that they help them to understand the world.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 m 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Fairytales may be works of fiction, but at their heart lies an internal logic that is undoubtedly real-world truth in a condensed form. Perhaps they simplify good and evil, and perhaps they hide the darkness in metaphors.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 m 04.ogg}} '''???:''' But let there be no doubt: The world within fairytales is as real as can be. And by extension, you and your compatriots are also real.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 23.ogg}} '''Detective:''' Goddess! Is it really you!?
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 m 05.ogg}} '''{{tt|Footnote|Echo of the Goddess of Fate}}:''' The line that separates footnotes from narrative can never be crossed. Never the two shall meet. This is why you have never heard my voice before.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 m 06.ogg}} '''Footnote:''' But now, you wish to break free from the story &mdash; and there's a cat nearby &mdash; so you can hear my echo.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 kirara 03.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' Nekomata...
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 24.ogg}} '''Detective:''' ...Just your echo...?
:'''Detective:''' ...
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw... Poor detective...
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 detectivereal 25.ogg}} '''Detective:''' So... we are a part of the real world, too...
:{{Black Screen|You lead the surrendered detective back to Cappet...}}
:{{Black Screen|"So we need a shot of the crime scene for evidence, a mugshot of the suspect for the records, and a photo of the heroes for posterity..." The guard mulled it over. "Three photos is overkill. Let's just get one big group photo at the crime scene."<br><br>"Suspect, try and look more serious. Heroes, more natural please, happy smiles! ... But no smiling from the victim or their friends and family, thank you. No no, don't get up! Stay on the ground, we need to capture the crime-scene as-is!"<br><br>"3, 2, 1, say cheeeeese!"}}

:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Weirdest photo experience of my life...)
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 cappet 01.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' My head's spinning. Albizzi just gave me a quick rundown of the situation. So you caught the detective?
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sorta, we chased him until he surrendered. Oh, and he asked us to pass on a message...
:{{Black Screen|You tell the three about the rest of what happened...}}
:{{Black Screen|...And that they could have removed the great clockwork key if they'd just worked together.}}
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 cappet 02.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Does he really think we didn't try that? 'Cause we did. After six months in that place.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 boborano 01.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' That was my bad. I thought it was a stupid idea at the time, so I didn't really exert myself.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 albizzi 01.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' I, uh... I also sort of stopped trying after three years.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 cappet 03.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' You...! *sigh* Never mind, I'm partly to blame as well. On the second attempt, I just hugged the key and pretended like I was pulling as hard as I could.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 kirara 04.ogg}} '''Kirara:''' You guys are so lazy... My granny's neighbor's pet {{sic|dog|nolink=1|expected=cat<!--audio mismatch-->}} has nothing on you, and it spends all day every day sunbathing.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 cappet 04.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' Anyway, you said you heard the voice of the Goddess of Fate at the end? That's amazing.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 albizzi 02.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' There is a world beyond our own after all.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 cappet 05.ogg}} '''Cappet:''' What would you guys say to taking a trip to the outside world some time? Otherwise, I got bashed in the back of the head for nothing.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 boborano 02.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' Depends, do either of you know how to get there...? But yes, I agree, we should go. And not invite the detective, just to annoy him.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 boborano 03.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' But maybe the reason we never worried about whether we're real or not is that, unlike him, we weren't there to witness the creation of this world. We've never had any reason to doubt that we're real.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 boborano 04.ogg}} '''Boborano:''' If someone ever convinced me that these delightful dimwits, Cappet and Albizzi, weren't real... I'd be devastated.
:{{A|vo kwq001 36 albizzi 03.ogg}} '''Albizzi:''' Hehe.

==Trivia==
* The following lines are in rhyming {{w|iambic pentameter}}:
{{Dialogue Start}}
::'''Albizzi:''' *clears throat* So many summers, winters, springs, and falls, and now at last a hero hither strides.
::'''Boborano:''' This realm knows not what lies beyond its walls, its secrets mystify the world outside.

::'''Boborano:''' As golden sunlight fills the firmament, the tabletop engrosses your attent. Perhaps, perchance, peruse these pages thence — they surely represent no ill intent.

::'''Albizzi:''' With wood and earthen wares strewn all around, the demon-feline's fury can't be quelled, reducing them to rubble on the ground, she finds the vessels vacant save for... uhh, air?
::'''Boborano:''' She finds long gone the gems that once they held.

::'''Boborano:''' The weary heroes falter in their quest, for home they long, for friend and kin they yearn. These thoughts in mind, they pause and deem it best, to cease this foolish errand, and return—

::'''Cappet:''' A sense of longing wells up in the chest, and to one's heart one always must be true. Resume, you must, your once-forsaken quest, and persevere until you see it through.
{{Dialogue End}}
* The blacked-out text likely represents a pawprint from the Goddess of Fate's cat.
** The formation of the blacked-out text is identical across all manuscripts and all languages: two individual characters in the first line, an individual character and two consecutive characters in the next line, and three consecutive characters in the final line, with all blacked-out characters in close proximity to each other and also located in roughly the same section<!-- if you actually go and line count, you are doing god's work --> of each manuscript (around the middle for all languages except for Korean, where the "pawprint" is in the first three lines of each manuscript). The individual blacked-out characters represent the cat's toe pads, meaning the pawprint is "upright" when viewed at a 45-degree angle.
* In the picture at the end of this quest, the Detective holds a sign reading "NARR" (Narrator) in [[Fontaine Script]].
* The story the Narrator tells about a teacher asking the clan members' greatest fears is a reference to the [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/what-scares-you-the-most What Scares You The Most] meme, specifically the [https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/8lwtw5/i_see_a_lot_of_potential_with_this_format/ version made by u/SicWik in r/MemeEconomy] in Reddit.
