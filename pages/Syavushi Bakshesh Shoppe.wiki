==Trivia==
* The shop's name may be translated as "Generous {{w|Siyâvash}}" in Persian.
** In the Iranian {{w|Shahnameh|''Shahnameh''}} epic, {{Lang|Siyâvash|fa=سیاوش}} was a martyred prince and husband of Ferigees, from whose blood grew a plant known as {{Lang|''Khune Asyavushan''|fa=خون اسیاوشان|fa_tl=Blood of Siyâvash}}. Because of this, he is associated with the growth of vegetation in Iranian mythology.
** {{Lang|{{wt|بخشش|''Bakhshesh''}}|fa=بخشش}} is a Persian word that can be translated as "forgiveness" or "generosity".
