==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
''(To be added.)''

===Personality===
In [[Unreconciled Stars]], [[Huffman]] describes Mack to be someone who is not good with children. No matter how much he tried to convince Jill and Will to return to the city, he was left to stand by from a distance.

Though he appears to be a stern person and the children have thought of him as fierce and angry, there is a gentler side to him. A conversation with the Traveler reveals that Mack did not want to disturb their joyful playtime, so he chose to watch over them. He even worries over the possibility of them getting hurt.

===Appearance===
Mack wears one of the standard uniforms of the Knights of Favonius. The uniform consists of a black long-sleeve shirt, horse riding pants, gloves, and brown leather shoulder pads with brass-accented white plate armor worn on top. His vambraces however are black. Wing motifs decorate various parts of the armor along with the Knights of Favonius crest on the breastplate. A sheathed sword hangs from his belt on his left side and a blowing horn hangs from the back of his hip.

:'''Mack:''' Hi. I'm Mack, a Knight of Favonius. Is there anything I can help you with?
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here?
::'''Mack:''' Ah, well do you see those two children over there?
::'''Mack:''' They ran off to play together by themselves, without their parents.
::'''Mack:''' I was concerned for their safety, so I thought I'd follow them.
:{{DIcon}} Who are those kids?
::'''Mack:''' That's Will and Jill. Children aren't really supposed to leave the city without an accompanying adult...
::'''Mack:''' But I thought, they just look so happy playing together. I couldn't bring myself to go and tell them off...
::'''Mack:''' So I've just stayed here watching them. Otherwise, I'm not sure how I'd be able to face their parents.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Mack:''' Alright, have a good one.

===Hidden Strife===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Mack where Falcon Coast's northern beach meets Windrise's grass)<!-- using this description because he does appear before the ley line deposit appears, so using the ley line deposit as a landmark technically isn't a good idea -->
:{{A|vo hyeq002 10 mack 01.ogg}} '''Mack:''' Hold it, I have to stop you right there. Sorry, the name's Mack.
:{{A|vo hyeq002 10 mack 02.ogg}} '''Mack:''' The Knights of Favonius are carrying out a training exercise near Falcon Coast. Access is temporarily denied to the public.
:{{DIcon}} But I don't see any knights on the beach...
::{{A|vo hyeq002 10 mack 03a.ogg}} '''Mack:''' They're still rounding up the troops, but they'll be arriving shortly.
::{{A|vo hyeq002 10 mack 03a 1.ogg}} '''Mack:''' Please return to the city. Combat training is boring to watch, and we don't want to risk you getting injured.
:{{DIcon}} But there are monsters on the beach...
::{{A|vo hyeq002 10 mack 03b.ogg}} '''Mack:''' Exactly. They will serve as targets for the knights participating in the training exercise.
::{{A|vo hyeq002 10 mack 03b 1.ogg}} '''Mack:''' Please return to the city. Combat training is boring to watch, and we don't want to risk you getting injured.<!-- yes, it sounds like the VA recorded the exact same line twice with slightly different intonation -->
