When they first saw the place, they made a gesture to pump themselves up. I'd hazard a guess that Romaritime Harbor, atop that waterfall, would make for a perfect cover image..."

|"Light novel readers have a special nickname for the place where the protagonist is briefly active before they go out and do their great deeds &mdash; the 'Happy Old Home.'"<br>"In some works, such a place plays host to neither powerful friends nor foes, which allows the protagonist to display their stunning rate of growth. But many readers also find that this makes said stories rather old-fashioned and formulaic, and robs the initial companions one meets of significance."<br>"What do I think, you ask? Well, I'm of the latter camp. Those the protagonist meets at the start should also constantly improve &mdash; that's the reality of how it is in Teyvat, and it just wouldn't be any fun otherwise!"<br>"Speaking of which, what sort of place would you find closest to the concept of said 'Happy Old Home'?"

The cover needs to... leave a kind of panicked terror at first glance, before inspiring an indomitable will to fight!"<br>"I've never received such a request before, but my guess is that an ancient, famous battlefield would be the best reference... Any ideas?"

|"Have you heard? In places where many lives have been lost, their fear and sorrow seep into the very soil, and though trees and flowers may sprout and grow thereafter, the air will still carry the faint scent of sadness."<br>"...Hmmm. That's what the historian who commissioned it said. Either way, this author is penning a novel rooted in historical facts that has been suitably dramatized in some places for effect, and so we'll need a cover that's... bright, yet carries that note of tragedy."<br>"He recommended that I take use scenery from Elynas as a reference, though I must confess that I don't really understand why..."

He is a Fontainian author who rarely leaves home, and has never even seen the Research Institute... Only due to a lack of time, of course. Which appears to be a common issue for many authors."

I suppose that would serve as the best possible basis for a magical plant."
