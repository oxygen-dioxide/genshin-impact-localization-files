==Personality==
{{Quote|A courier for Komaniya Express, a delivery company in Inazuma. A nekomata who loves her job and human society.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
Kirara is a [[youkai]] who enjoys working at Komaniya Express as she is curious about the world outside [[Teyvat]] and enjoys public interactions, seeing them as outings at her own expense. Due to her lack of knowledge about the outside world, she often mistakes others with non-human features or magic users to be other forms of youkai. She enjoys her job and ensures that her customers have a pleasant experience, frequently worried about the prospect of getting fired and having to return to the wilds, which she considers boring.

As a nekomata, Kirara often has various feline instincts such as sleeping in boxes, pouncing on small animals and sunbathing on roofs, though she has to frequently suppress these instincts while in her human form to better interact with society. She is notably bad at lying, with any attempts to do so resulting in her tails swaying wildly back and forth. 

==Appearance==

<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3-4 sentences. Outfits should be described on the outfit pages. -->
Kirara uses the [[:Category:Medium Female Characters|medium female]] model. She is a slim, fair-skinned young woman with pale, ash blonde hair that sticks out in tufts and green eyes. Part of her hair is tied into a high ponytail, and she has a long ahoge in the middle of it. She has a distinct set of two-toned cat tails. As with many other youkai, Kirara has an alternate feline form, though she does not use it as often as it attracts too much attention.

{{Quote|She's an adorable little nekomata. Just whisper 'the parcel delivery is going to be late' in her ear while she's asleep, and she'll spring right up and start dashing faster than General Gorou does on the battlefield.|[[Yae Miko]]}}
Komaniya Express, the famous delivery company in Inazuma, has a very special employee working under them. At a glance, she resembles an adorably dressed teenage girl with two tails swaying behind her. Though she treats each of her customers with kindness and generosity, secretly she sometimes takes to running quietly across rooftops to ensure none of her deliveries arrive late...

Though her obvious nature as a youkai drew more than few comments at first, as Kirara introduced herself with honesty and clarity time and time again while conducting her tasks with dutifulness and effectiveness, people not only dropped all lingering misgivings but even grew grateful for her presence. "Safe and punctual," "service assured," "vivacious and adorable"... These three phrases are words most commonly used to describe Kirara on the feedback board. Word is that if you give her a five-star rating or offer her some snacks, you might even see Kirara's face brighten with gratitude as her tails whirl with building joy.

To Kirara, her job is as precious as any jewel. She treasures everything about human society and is always overjoyed to behold the smiling faces of her customers. Thus, she gives her all to offer the best service she can for everyone she caters to. After all, if she finds herself fired by the company, all she can do is return being a youkai in the mountains.

Thankfully, her boss at Komaniya Express had never even considered the idea of releasing her. Contrarily, they privately asked Kirara if she wanted higher pay and to transition into comparatively less effortful secretarial work, but Kirara rejected their offer with haste. She didn't have the heart to tell her boss that, to her, every time she leaves to make a delivery, it feels like she's getting to enjoy an outing at the public's expense!

              --><p>Ah! But the same people who tell you this will also warn you that this nekomata isn't some weak little thing you can pick on. If you have designs on packages that don't belong to you or get carried away and try to touch her tails... Well, then you'll have to face the consequences.</p><!--
              --><p>After hearing all this, it's hard to resist going to Komaniya Express...</p><!--

|text2         = <p>Kirara's earliest memories are of wandering the wilds of Inazuma.</p><!--
              --><p>Back then, she was a nameless kitten with but one tail, and woke every morning with an empty, growling stomach. After a stretch, a yawn, and a single "meow" as though to bellyache about her circumstances, she would begin to hunt for breakfast. The menu often included finches that had let down their guard, or overly curious young fish too near the shore.</p><!--
              --><p>Whenever she encountered adventurers out in the wilderness, she would lie down at a safe distance and watch intently as they fished out all kinds of marvelous instruments from their packs. Fwoosh! Suddenly there was a fire roaring. Bong! A strange cauldron was set over the fire. And then, with a bubbling sound, an intoxicating scent would occasionally waft over on the breeze...</p><!--
              --><p>Observing this process with wide eyes, to her it was as if she had witnessed magic. Thus a yearning for human society began to flutter about in her chest, as though a butterfly had flown into her heart.</p><!--
              --><p>During a frigid winter night with the biting winds howling, Kirara, still a small kitten, was frozen to the point of being unable to feel her tail.</p><!--
              --><p>"Gotta find a warm place to hide. Even a hollow in a tree will do..." She thought to herself. But when she was able to look up, she saw a cluster of warm lights flickering not too far away...</p><!--
              --><p>This was the first time Kirara entered a human home, and while she was curious about everything around her, she was also frightened. The owner of the house seemed not to notice the kitten that had found its way into her home, but Kirara paid little notice. She found a small square box near the entryway into which she snugly fit, and into it did she sit, falling asleep almost immediately.</p><!--
              --><p>"I'll just rest the night, just one night..." were her last thoughts before dreams took her...</p><!--
              --><p>Yet when she awoke, she found a warm fire crackled away next to her, and beside it was a fragrant bowl of nekomanma. Directly across from her was an old lady in the middle of knitting a woolen sweater. The old lady seemed to be trying to say something, as though encouraging her to eat. With her tail down and guard raised, she cautiously took a bite of that aromatic nekomanma in front of her that she was so curious about...</p><!--
              --><p>It was the most delicious thing she had ever eaten, to the point she began to doubt whether or not she was still dreaming!</p><!--
              --><p>And so, she stayed in that cozy little home for one winter after another, and heard story after story from that kind old woman...</p><!--
              --><p>On occasion, when Kirara thinks back to that first night, she'll cock her head and ask herself:</p><!--

She eagerly explored every nook and cranny in the city, and not even the roof of the Almighty Shogun's [[Tenshukaku]] was immune from her curiosity. This is the reason that the [[Tenryou Commission]] is one of the addresses she is most familiar with.</p><!--
              --><p>Though the Tenryou Commission taught her rules like "don't climb on other people's roofs" and "don't eat the ornamental koi", then she learned "how to be a good youkai in human society" from none other than the [[Yae Miko|Lady Kitsune]] of the [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Faction)|Grand Narukami Shrine]]. Kirara has caught the eye of "the greatest and coolest youkai," as she calls her, and Yae Miko, for her part, has been willing to impart all her experience upon her lively and interesting junior. Upon learning that Kirara felt the streets and alleys of Inazuma City were priceless treasures, Miko recommended that she seek employment at Komaniya Express.</p><!--
              --><p>"If you want to blend into human society, then you must work like an ordinary human. This is most important." Thus spoke the Lady Kitsune.</p><!--

She never thought there was anything wrong with what she was doing, just that all those accessories would occasionally restrict her movement and make it hard to climb up and down.

              --><p>Each package usually contains a lovely little gift, such as a dried flower of the [[Nilotpala Lotus]], a [[Starconch]] ornament, or if the household has young children, a [[Scarab]] with peculiar patterns on its shell!</p><!--
              --><p>These are all items that Kirara has collected while out on her deliveries. To her, each is a novel and fascinating treasure, and perfect as thank-you gifts.

Leaving a present at the door, if she happens to find the old woman sunning herself in the yard, she'll immediately return to being a cat. "Meow, meow," she'll call, jumping up onto the woman's knees, curling up into a ball and pouting for attention.</p><!--
              --><p>"Ah! Back, are we, Kirara?" The old woman smiles and laughs. She doesn't know that this little cat is already a renowned courier. All she knows is that she often goes out to "play" for ever longer periods.</p><!--
              --><p>"You really are growing up so fast. I remember when I found you in the box, you were such a tiny little thing..." Scratching Kirara's head, the old woman fishes out a round, shimmering pearl and places it on her paw pads.</p><!--
              --><p>"See? This is that [[Sango Pearl]] from the story. Now, I don't know who it's from, but there it was on the doorstep, along with some snacks, too."

              --><p>"Why, you haven't grown into a youkai who takes care of me in my old age, have you, little cat?"</p><!--

              --><p>"I remember there was a really really tall tree nearby..."</p><!--
              --><p>Kirara's tail seemed even more anxious than she was. As she climbed, it repeatedly refused to obey her mental commands and nearly caused her to fall.</p><!--
              --><p>The tree stretched ever upward, so tall it seemed without end. Kirara did not think about just how high she had climbed. Instead, stories of youkai and humans raced across her mind. It seemed as if she wasn't climbing a tree but pursuing days gone by, and if she was but a step too slow, all might slip away forever...</p><!--

              --><p>In that moment, it was as if something dormant in Kirara's heart was ignited, and all the fantastical stories of the past had finally become reality, a thousand rays of shimmering light streaming into that galaxy of fireworks. The stories that had once seemed so far away were now so close she could almost reach out and touch them, and she now yearned as never before to bask in that glow.</p><!--
              --><p>"Ah! I see her!"</p><!--

              --><p>When she safely alighted back on the ground, the clouds parted and the moonlight cast her shadow upon the snow, a shadow that now boasted two tails...</p><!--
              --><p>"Are you sure you don't want to stay the night? The snow has only just stopped, and getting back won't be easy," urged the landlord.</p><!--
              --><p>"No, no, I couldn't! I have a little cat at home, waiting for my return, haha..." laughed the old woman as she stood before the entryway.</p><!--
              --><p>"If that's the case, I'll take you back!" A young female voice suddenly rang out from outside.</p><!--
              --><p>The landlord and old woman peered outside, and there they saw a youthful lady with two restless tails, and a shining Vision dangling from her waist.</p>
