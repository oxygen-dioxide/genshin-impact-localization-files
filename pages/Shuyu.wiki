{{Lang|'''Shuyu'''|zh=漱玉|zh_rm=Shùyù}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in {{Quest|A Thousand Moonlit Miles}}.

==Profile==
<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->
Shuyu is the granddaughter of [[Cloud Retainer]]'s disciple [[Yuandai]] and an exorcist from [[Mt. Tianheng]]. After her parents died when she was young, she was raised by her grandmother. As she got older, Shuyu began to take care of Yuandai due to the latter's presumed dementia. After going on [[A Thousand Moonlit Miles|a journey]] with Cloud Retainer, the [[Traveler]], and [[Paimon]], Shuyu eventually learned of her grandmother's past. Afterwards, Shuyu has become the newest disciple of Cloud Retainer, making her the first disciple of the said adeptus in the human world.

===Appearance===
Shuyu has fair skin with freckles on her face. She has dark brown eyes and brown hair tied in braided pig tails.

Originally Shuyu wears dark teal dress with black skirt and black shoes. However, after she became Cloud Retainer's disciple, the adeptus made her new clothes: light teal dress shirt on top of black skirt. They are paired with red knot accessory above her chest, red rope bracelets, and light teal shoes. She now also dons red bows on her braided pigtails.

==Story==
Shuyu is a young girl and the granddaughter of [[Yuandai]]. Her parents died young, and thus she was left to take care of Yuandai herself. She would regularly try to treat her dementia, to little avail; however, at the time, she was not aware she was not a full, pure-blooded human.<ref name="Leisurely Chatter">{{Ref/Quest|Leisurely Chatter}}</ref>

At one point, Shuyu had a high fever and was not with Yuandai. Yuandai's master, [[Cloud Retainer]], having come to terms with Yuandai's decision, saw this and tried to treat Shuyu, but she refused to climb on her. Cloud Retainer later returned, having made herself completely white and brought Shuyu to her adobe, where she treated her with a magic potion before returning her home.<ref name="Lovely Dreams">{{Ref/Quest|Lovely Dreams}}</ref> Shuyu would remember the events, though did not know who the adeptus was.<ref name="A Search for Secrets">{{Ref/Quest|A Search for Secrets}}</ref>

When Cloud Retainer decided to return to [[Liyue Harbor]] under the alias Xianyun, Shuyu and Yuandai were going to eat at [[Wanmin Restaurant]], only to be informed by [[Chef Mao]] that they had no tables left, though he suggests asking around to see if someone would share. Shuyu spotted Xianyun, the Traveler and Paimon, and asked to share the table, which they agreed to. She explained her past and Yuandai's worsening dementia, unsure as to what to do.<ref name="Leisurely Chatter"/>

Upon learning from [[Xingqiu]] about a mysterious heroine, the Traveler decided to visit [[Wangshu Inn]], the area north of [[Jueyun Karst]] and [[Qingyun Peak]]. In each location, Yuandai slowly regained her memories.<ref name="A Search for Secrets"/> For the last step, Xianyun invited them back to [[Mt. Aocang]], where she used her [[Suspensus Somnium Mechanism]] to help Yuandai fully recover her memories and origins. After making peace with her life and promising to return in the future, Yuandai reverted to a crane and leaves, making Shuyu cry. When tired from crying, she fell asleep listening to the sounds of Xianyun's mechanism.<ref name="Lovely Dreams"/>

Following the nap, Shuyu felt better knowing that she would see Yuandai sometime later, and asked Xianyun if she could be her disciple, which she agreed to, making her the first disciple in the human world. She was given a new dress and moved her belongings to Xianyun's new home in [[Chihu Rock]], before Xianyun took her, [[Zhongli]], the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] to a restaurant to introduce Shuyu to her other disciples, [[Ganyu]] and [[Shenhe]].<ref name="Lovely Dreams"/>

As the next [[Lantern Rite]] which featured a kite-flying competition was near, Xianyun organised a kite-making workshop with her disciples and friends, and bought [[Grilled Tiger Fish]] with Shuyu for the occasion. After enjoying the meal, Xianyun asked the participants to team up, and Shuyu invited [[Gaming]], who initially wasn't sure he should also join but decided to go along with it. Shuyu wanted a suanni for the design of their kite, which Gaming thought was hard but agreed to, and she did the colouring while Gaming made the frame. They also made the eyes and ears able to glow in the dark. After all the groups were done, they put their kites together to let Xianyun evaluate. However, it was not long before a rogue kite from elsewhere landed nearby, which Xianyun went to investigate. In the meantime, Shuyu and [[Yaoyao]] played with their kites, but soon tired themselves out, so they left while escorted by Gaming.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Cloud-Sea Appeal, a Brilliance Revealed (Quest)}}</ref> Days later at [[Liyue Harbor]], Shuyu accompanied Gaming's father [[Yip Tak]] while watching Gaming's Wushou Dance. Afterwards, seeing that Xianyun was waiting for her aside, she bid goodbye to Yip Tak and headed over.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Glede Returns to the Pavilion (Quest)}}</ref>
