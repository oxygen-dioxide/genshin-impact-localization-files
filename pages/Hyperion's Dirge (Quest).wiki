==Steps==
Start the quest by talking to [[Aberaku]] directly under the central teleport waypoint of [[Dainichi Mikoshi]] where there are two [[Ruin Guard]]s. He is hidden in a room which is blocked by two [[Ruin Guard]]s and [[Ruins Torch]]es. The torches appear as [[Sunfire Phantasms]] in Whitenight so the player must turn to Evernight in order to reveal them.
# Find and offer up the objects in which Aberaku nested his thoughts (0/3)
#:There are three sub-quests to collect each of the three offerings:
#* [[Temple Inquiry]]
#* [[Narrow Inquiry]]
#* [[Serpent's Heart Inquiry]]
#: These sub-quests can be done in any order. After completing them, submit the [[Offerings of The Narrows]], [[Offerings of the Temple]], and [[Offerings of the Serpent's Heart]] to the pedestals in the hidden room.
# Reach the top of [[Dainichi Mikoshi]]
#* Use the [[Phase Gate]] that appears in the hidden room after submitting the offerings to reach the top.
# Speak to Aberaku

==Gameplay Notes==
* Reaching the top of Dainichi Mikoshi grants the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement ''[[Light and Dark, Dusk and Dawn]]''.
* The sub-quests can be found and done without starting this quest.

{{Quest Description|According to the spirit named Aberaku, he can only find peace if you collect the three fragments of his soul and reunite them with the main body...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;((Optional) Talk to Aberaku in the secret room, prior to placing the offerings)
:'''Aberaku:''' My name is...
:'''Aberaku:''' Aberaku, Helios-Forger!
:'''Paimon:''' And Paimon's... well, Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} We're doing introductions now?
::'''Paimon:''' Well, since he started it...
::'''Paimon:''' Guess it's just good manners.
::'''Aberaku:''' It is but a small matter. Indeed, it is I who has treated you with utter disregard, having come to receive you in such a tragic state.
::'''Paimon:''' Don't worry! We don't mind. Right, (Traveler)?
:{{DIcon}} My name is...
::'''Aberaku:''' ...I see. So you are a guest from afar.
::'''Aberaku:''' I only regret that I have come to meet you in such a horrid state.
::'''Paimon:''' It's alright!
:'''Paimon:''' Still, why are you here, Mister?
:'''Aberaku:''' I... I am the creator of the Helios, and this place is my... final resting place.
:'''Aberaku:''' Falling asleep in a dark, icy place, never to wake... How could I just die like that? I, the Helios-Forger!
:'''Paimon:''' The creator of the Helios?
:'''Paimon:''' What's the Helios?
:'''Aberaku:''' Ah, right. Helios is what I called my creation in private.
:'''Aberaku:''' Perhaps this is not known to you, but the people of Byakuyakoku call this thing...
:'''Aberaku:''' The Dainichi Mikoshi.
:'''Aberaku:''' Helios is the Dainichi Mikoshi, the solar chariot that drives the {{Rubi|Hyperion|Byakuya no Hikari}}.
:{{DIcon}} So you're the creator of the Dainichi Mikoshi?
:{{DIcon}} That's you then?
:'''Aberaku:''' Indeed it is.
:'''Aberaku:''' O Traveler from another land. Though I did create it, I was placed under house arrest, and imprisoned above my own creation.
:'''Aberaku:''' After my death, my soul was shattered across the land of Byakuyakoku, and many of my memories were lost in that scattering.
:'''Aberaku:''' I remember that there was something very important... high above the Dainichi Mikoshi...
:'''Aberaku:''' But I can no longer remember it. Please, distant wayfarer... Could you help me retrieve my clothes, crown, and bones, which have been placed in three different places?
:'''Aberaku:''' You can find them in [[The Narrows]], the [[Evernight Temple]], and [[the Serpent's Heart]].
:'''Aberaku:''' Offer them up upon three altars, and my soul shall be reunited, and I shall be able to open the way to the Dainichi Mikoshi for you...
:'''Aberaku:''' Then you will be able to travel above the Dainichi Mikoshi, into the closed spaces hidden in the veil of ever-night.

;(Talk to Aberaku again)
:'''Aberaku:''' Please, claim the offerings at The Narrows, the Evernight Temple, and the Serpent's Heart. This way, my soul shall be reunited, and I shall be able to open the way to the Dainichi Mikoshi for you...

----
;(After placing the three offerings)
:'''Paimon:''' The offering's done...
:'''Paimon:''' Earlier, that soul remnant said that the offerings could open the way to Dainichi Mikoshi...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go up and have a look, (Traveler)!

----
;(Talk to Aberaku at the top of Dainichi Mikoshi)
:'''Aberaku:''' Ah, Traveler from another land, it is you.
:'''Aberaku:''' Thanks to you, my soul has become whole, and I now recall everything. Incredible.
:'''Aberaku:''' Perhaps you already know that in the distant past, there was only a great darkness in Byakuyakoku, and that those who lived there dwelt in fear of the [[Dragonheirs of the Depths]].
:'''Aberaku:''' Back then, it was I who organized the construction of the Dainichi Mikoshi, and thus did Byakuyakoku obtain a cyclical night and day, and thus did the name "Byakuya" come about.
:'''Aberaku:''' It was said that: "Now that the Dainichi Mikoshi has been built, though this land is in everlasting night, we can at least tell black from white."
:'''Aberaku:''' How mortifying then, that before the shreds of my soul were reunited, I could not even remember that day when the people crowded around the completed Dainichi Mikoshi.
:'''Aberaku:''' It should have been my fondest memory.
:'''Aberaku:''' But alas...
:'''Paimon:''' Alas what?
: '''Aberaku:''' When Dainichi Mikoshi was built, the Dragonheirs were defeated, repelled by a light that they were unused to. Thus did the people regain peace of mind.
:'''Aberaku:''' But the moment peace began to reign... Ah, the human heart is hard to comprehend. Who knew then that they would have begun to nurse such evil intent?
:'''Aberaku:''' O Traveler from afar, I am certain that you know how voracious villains will seize for themselves riches and power if given the chance... more than they ever deserved!
:'''Aberaku:''' And so they used the people, leading them unto the worship of the Dainichi Mikoshi, leading them into the folly of believing in such vain and dead objects.
:'''Aberaku:''' In the end, they even proclaimed the rule of the "{{Rubi|[[Sunchild]]|Phaethon}}" over the land.
:{{DIcon}} The Sunchild?
:'''Aberaku:''' Indeed. There will always be a young infant chosen to be the Sunchild.
:'''Aberaku:''' Of course, such children would not have been of age to understand the world. They would not have been fit to rule. And so they served as puppets, going along with those who pulled their strings in the background.
:'''Aberaku:''' I wanted to oppose this, but I was accused of high treason by the Sunchild under their control and imprisoned here.
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, the Sunchild...
:'''Paimon:''' But wouldn't the Sunchild eventually realize that they were being manipulated?
:'''Aberaku:''' And that is why no Sunchild has ever reached maturity. For it is as you say: grown people are not so easily swayed by villains.
:'''Aberaku:''' "The hallowed Sunchild, their birth-rite begun, on Pegasus shall ride to the feast of the sun."
:{{DIcon}} Wait, surely you don't mean...
:{{DIcon}} So, on one of their birthdays...
:'''Aberaku:''' Yes. They would be taken to the inner sanctum of the Dainichi Mikoshi, dressed up as those attending birth rites and in high spirits...
:'''Aberaku:''' ...The thing hidden here is related to them.
:'''Aberaku:''' This bridle is the proof that one is indeed a child of the sun. I hid it here, thinking to someday hand it over and alert the people... But I suppose that such a deed is meaningless now.
:'''Aberaku:''' Traveler from another land... I was neither able to protect those children nor this nation.
:'''Aberaku:''' My name is...
:'''Aberaku:''' Aberaku, Helios-Forger!
:'''Aberaku:''' I organized the construction of the Dainichi Mikoshi. 'Twas I who hung a bright mirror on high amidst the ever-night, and I thought myself a genius.
:'''Aberaku:''' And such talent I had! Such ability!
:'''Aberaku:''' I dreamed of using the Dainichi Mikoshi to wash away the darkness, but I did not then know that it was the greed and desire within human hearts that was the all-devouring night everlasting.
:'''Aberaku:''' Guest from afar, I now give the bridle into your hands.
:'''Aberaku:''' This Divine Bridle is a testament to our supremely laughable history...
:'''Aberaku:''' Keep it well... Nay, do with it whatever you wish.
:{{DIcon}} This is too precious a gift...
:'''Aberaku:''' Hah! Nay, it has already been rendered meaningless. That I have been restored to wholeness and become able to hand it to you is fate. And for this thing, it shall be considered a fine death.
;(Obtain [[Divine Bridle]] ×1)

;(Talk to Aberaku again after the quest ends)
:'''Aberaku:''' Ah... All the talent, all the ability... But what use was it?
