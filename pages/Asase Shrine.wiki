==Lore==
After Kanna Kapatcir was felled over Seirai Island, the Asase Shrine was established to manage the wards and suppress its lingering hatred.<ref name="Through the Mists" /> The shrine was managed by the Asase Clan, and villagers from [[Koseki Village]] helped maintain the shrine and made offerings.

Around five hundred years ago, several years after the [[cataclysm]] drew to a close, a conflict erupted between Seirai's [[Ako Domeki]] and his crew, and [[Narukami Island|Narukami]]'s [[Shogunate]]. [[Asase Hibiki]], the Head Priestess of Asase Shrine, decided to aid Domeki's cause by using the "true 'magic'" she learned from the [[Yougou Tengu]] to unseal the wards around Seirai Island.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Hamayumi}}</ref> This unleashed the Thunderbird's might, creating a massive Electro storm in the middle of the island and drawing the [[Thunder Manifestation]] to [[Amakumo Peak]].

While most of Seirai was devastated and the inhabitants of Koseki Village were evacuated to [[Inazuma City]], Asase Shrine itself has remained largely unaffected by the storm besides the loss of visitors. After Hibiki headed into the storm and never returned, the cat [[Neko]] has dubbed herself Asase Shrine's "Provisional Head Priestess."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Seirai Stormchasers: Part I}}</ref>
