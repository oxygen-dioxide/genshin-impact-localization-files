==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Diluc before approaching Stanley)
:{{A|vo dialog wdlq004 diluc 01.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' You know, I'm glad I actually had the chance to come down here today.
:{{A|vo dialog wdlq004 diluc 02.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' The tavern isn't overcrowded, and I couldn't be in a better mood.

;(Upon approaching Stanley)
:{{A|vo wdlq004 3 stanley 03.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' Tell me, [[Real Stanley|Stanley]]... Tell me what should I do...?
:{{A|vo wdlq004 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Why does he keep repeating his own name?
:{{DIcon}} He's hiding something.
::{{A|vo wdlq004 3 paimon 02a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Could there be another person called Stanley?
:{{DIcon}} There's another Stanley.
::{{A|vo wdlq004 3 venti 01b.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Surely not. Even I've never heard tell of a second Stanley.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 3 stanley 04.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' *sobs* Oh, Stanley...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 3 stanley 05.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' It should have been me! I should have been the one to die in the [[Mare Jivari]] that day... Why won't your spirit come and stop me from using your name? Why, Stanley, why?
:{{A|vo wdlq004 3 stanley 06.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' If only you hadn't had to save a rookie like me, you would have never died in that windless corner of the world...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 3 stanley 07.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' You were a renowned adventurer, destined to become a legend one day... But now... that'll never happen, because your life was cut short&mdash; and all because of a worthless tag-along...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... Does anyone get what's going on here?
:{{A|vo wdlq004 3 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' ...I think our friend really did make it to the Mare Jivari. And I think the tragedy he encountered there was real, too.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 3 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' But, the real adventurer, the real Stanley &mdash; that was his partner. Not him.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 3 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' The real Stanley is the one who died to save our "Stanley."
:{{A|vo wdlq004 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait... So the only reason our Stanley is called Stanley in the first place is because he stole the other Stanley's name?
:{{A|vo wdlq004 3 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I fear that may be the case.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 3 stanley 08.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' Stanley, for so many years I've lived in fear... fear that Mondstadt will forget all about you... So I tell your adventure stories at every opportunity...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 3 stanley 09.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' Mondstadt must remember: Stanley reached the center of the Mare Jivari... He's the greatest adventurer there ever was, and he lives on!
:{{A|vo wdlq004 3 stanley 10.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' Stanley will never die, because I am Stanley! I... am Stanley...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 3 stanley 11.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' I'm sorry, Stanley... I'm getting too old... now...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 3 stanley 12.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' *sigh*
:{{A|vo wdlq004 3 stanley 13.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' Are you guys planning on eavesdropping much longer?
:{{A|vo wdlq004 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yikes! We're busted!

----
;(Talk to Stanley)
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 stanley 01.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' Go away. Save your questions, just leave me in peace!
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 stanley 02.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' Leave, now! Don't make me tell you again!
:;(Jack arrives)
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 jack 01.ogg}} '''Jack:''' Honorary Knight! Venti! And Paimon! I'm so glad you guys are here.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 jack 02.ogg}} '''Jack:''' I've been looking for you everywhere! I wanted to thank you again for helping me find the sword and shield. My parents are finally supporting me!
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Oh? Really?
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 jack 03.ogg}} '''Jack:''' Yeah, really! They even said they're gonna pay for someone to fix up the Sword of Brilliant Valor and Shield of Magnificent Honor for me, so I can take them out on the road.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' That's wonderful. So, Jack, is this the part where you bid farewell to Mondstadt and set off on your intrepid trip traversing Teyvat?
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 jack 04.ogg}} '''Jack:''' No, not yet. I still don't have what it takes to go too far from home just yet.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 jack 05.ogg}} '''Jack:''' Besides, I'm sure Stanley still has a few stories left to tell. Hehe... They're what inspired me to become an adventurer in the first place.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 jack 06.ogg}} '''Jack:''' Stanley... Oh, you're drunk again...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 jack 07.ogg}} '''Jack:''' See you tomorrow, then. After your hangover wears off, maybe you can tell me some more of your stories?
:;(Jack leaves the tavern)
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Stanley's really fond of that kid, don't you think?
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 stanley 03.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' *hic* Jack? Jack!
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Jack left.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 stanley 04.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' Oh, I see... Well, thank you for not telling him about my secret.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Eh? All of a sudden you're facing the facts? That isn't like you...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 stanley 05.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' Just now... I couldn't bear to look at him. His adventurer's spirit is so pure... unblemished...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 stanley 06.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' I'm just a weary old feckless fraud, but that kid is a brand-new shining star, full of potential... I cannot allow his dreams to be crushed.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're not a total fraud... Stanley's adventure stories and experiences &mdash; they're all true, aren't they?
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 stanley 07.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' Stories... Experiences... What's the point of them anymore?
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 stanley 08.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' To be honest, my memories of adventuring, and of Stanley... they're hazy, these days.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 stanley 09.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' That's my biggest secret of all. And my biggest fear.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 stanley 10.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' All these years, I've been livin' to tell his story. But his personality, and the details of his life, I don't remember them clearly anymore. Ah-ha...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 stanley 11.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' But the one thing I can never forget... is that he died in a windless land, where his spirit can never be recovered!
:{{DIcon}} His whole life, he's been drowning in guilt...
:{{DIcon}} All that remains is his imaginary friend...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Exactly... Even in his memory, the real Stanley isn't the living, breathing friend he knew at all.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 venti 07.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Instead, he's become fixed on the image of him as that battle-scarred warrior... and that image had held him captive his entire life.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 stanley 12.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' I'm too old... I never let go, but still so much has slipped away...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 stanley 13.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' I'm completely and utterly worthless!
:{{A|vo wdlq004 4 stanley 14.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' No adventurer should have to go that way... No adventurer ever...
:;(An animated cutscene begins)
:{{A|vo wdlq004 2 cs venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hans Archibald?
:{{A|vo wdlq004 2 cs stanley 01.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' My true name... How did you know?
:;(Venti summons a breeze)
:{{A|vo wdlq004 2 cs stanley 02.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' The wind...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 2 cs stanley 03.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' I can hear the wind blowing in the Mare Jivari...
:;(Venti shows himself as Barbatos to Stanley)
:{{A|vo wdlq004 2 cs stanley 04.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' I always believed... you existed...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 2 cs venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Will you hand me your old friend's spirit?
:;(Stanley takes Venti's hand and the spirit of Stanley finally goes in peace)
:{{A|vo wdlq004 5 stanley 01.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' I... I can't believe it...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 5 stanley 02.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' Thank you all! And thank you, Lord Barbatos...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 5 stanley 03.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' I'm sorry, it's going to take me some time to calm back down...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 5 stanley 04.ogg}} '''Stanley:''' But I think that... I'm going to be okay...
:;(Stanley leaves)
:{{A|vo wdlq004 5 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Ah, wonderful! Stanley reconnected with his true self, and Jack can finally go his own way.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 5 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' This calls for a celebration! And by celebration, I do of course mean libation!
:{{A|vo wdlq004 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And by libation, you mean you're not leaving this tavern till you're too drunk to walk, right?
:{{A|vo wdlq004 5 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Haha, no, the wine here's too expensive. Jack still owes me some wine though &mdash; he promised me a rare vintage in exchange for helping him out, remember?
:{{A|vo wdlq004 5 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I'll head off to fetch the wine. See you shortly, let's meet at the {{Color|buzzword|usual place}}!
:{{A|vo wdlq004 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Where's that supposed to be? Why has Paimon never heard of it? Hey, Tone-Deaf Bard!
:{{DIcon}} It's anybody's guess.
:{{DIcon}} I think I know where... possibly.
:{{DIcon}} Okay, see you there!
:{{A|vo wdlq004 5 paimon 03c.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey!

;(Talk to Diluc after Stanley reveals his secret)
:{{A|vo dialog wdlq004 diluc 03.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Stanley...
:{{A|vo dialog wdlq004 diluc 04.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' So many years after the fact, it's not even his friend himself that holds him back anymore.
:{{A|vo dialog wdlq004 diluc 05.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' But I for one am confident that the people of Mondstadt will not forget his friend's story.

----
;(Talk to Venti)
:{{A|vo wdlq004 6 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' You made it... finally.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just tell us where you mean next time, okay!? We looked everywhere!
:{{A|vo wdlq004 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So. Did you at least manage to find your wine?
:{{A|vo wdlq004 6 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Yep! Well, sort of... Jack made it out to be a rare, collector's edition vintage...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 6 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' ...when actually, it's just a half bottle of regular cider.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 6 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Ah, this takes me back.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 6 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' The first time I saw this view, I hadn't even taken on this form yet.
:{{DIcon}} ...What?
:{{A|vo wdlq004 6 venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' It was about twenty-six hundred years ago, before the world had come under the rule of The Seven.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 6 venti 07.ogg}} '''Venti:''' At that time, Old Mondstadt was ruled by a tyrant, who sealed off the city's perimeter with a ferocious hurricane. Even the birds couldn't get in or out.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Old Mondstadt? Oh, Paimon remembers &mdash; nowadays it's known as Stormterror's Lair, right? You mentioned it before!
:{{A|vo wdlq004 6 venti 08.ogg}} '''Venti:''' That's right. The tyrant of the winds who once ruled from that tower was [[Decarabian]], God of Storms.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 6 venti 09.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Back then, I was but a wisp among the thousand winds. I wasn't a god of anything &mdash; I didn't even have a human form...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 6 venti 10.ogg}} '''Venti:''' I was just a tiny elemental being who lived in the wind, a gentle breeze bringing subtle changes for the better, or tiny seeds of hope.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A tiny elemental being? Without a human form? Venti... do you mean you used to look different than you do now?
:{{A|vo wdlq004 6 venti 11.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Yep. My current form is not so different from the situation with fake Stanley... I took the form of a friend.
:;(Venti tells his story)
:In Old Mondstadt transpired the story to be told,
:Where a tyrant ruled, I met a boy, not that old.
:The lyre he played, and for a song he sought,
:But storm-walls blocked blue sky &mdash; he was sincerely distraught.
:"I do so wish to see the birds in flight"
:Said he, his strong eyes filling with light.
:But his voice was lost in the howling wind's churn.
:For the whirlwind takes, and gives naught in return.
:The true sky, and songs that cageless soar...
:Were they not wishes worth fighting for?
:So the boy turned, extending his hand:
:"Let us cast down the tyrant and his walls from this land."
:The young boy raised then the flag of revolt,
:And I threw myself into freedom's tumult.
:Victorious were we who fought to be free.
:Gods fell, winds whipped, nations shook violently.
:In the smoke, a despot met his doom,
:And we watched as his great tower fell none too soon.
:Mondstadt began anew, the story passed down&mdash;
:And since then never has another worn its crown.
:;(Venti finishes telling his story)
:{{A|vo wdlq004 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So then what?
:{{A|vo wdlq004 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What happened to your friend?
:{{DIcon}} (Same situation as with Stanley's friend...)
:{{A|vo wdlq004 7 venti 01.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Say, Paimon, do you wish to hear the next part of the story?
:{{A|vo wdlq004 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yes, of course! The suspense is killing Paimon!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, go pick us a couple of apples.
::{{A|vo wdlq004 7 paimon 04a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Now's the time you suddenly get a craving for apples? Really?
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, could you fetch us some meat or fish?
::{{A|vo wdlq004 7 paimon 04b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But Venti's telling his story! What makes you suddenly wanna have a meat feast!?
:{{A|vo wdlq004 7 venti 02.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Hahaha, getting a little peckish or something...
:{{DIcon}} Oh, so peckish.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh! Paimon's had it up to here with you!
:;(Venti and the Traveler keep talking after Paimon leaves)
:{{A|vo wdlq004 7 venti 03.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Ah... You know, you're so smart it almost makes me uncomfortable sometimes...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 7 venti 04.ogg}} '''Venti:''' But then, maybe it's right that true friends can tell what the other is thinking.
:{{A|vo wdlq004 7 venti 05.ogg}} '''Venti:''' A refreshing drink, a gentle breeze... Moments like this always take me back...
:{{A|vo wdlq004 7 venti 06.ogg}} '''Venti:''' Back to a song that I first heard from him...
:{{DIcon}} I'm listening.
:;(Venti recites)
:{{A|vo wdlq004 7 cs venti 01.ogg}} '''''Fly, fly away.'''''
:{{A|vo wdlq004 7 cs venti 02.ogg}} '''''Like a bird in the sky.'''''
:{{A|vo wdlq004 7 cs venti 03.ogg}} '''''See the world on my behalf...'''''
:{{A|vo wdlq004 7 cs venti 04.ogg}} '''''To the heavens may you fly...'''''

----
;(Talk to Venti again)
:'''(Quietly gazes at Venti):''' (The green-clad figure is uncharacteristically silent.)
:'''(Quietly gazes at Venti):''' (Sometimes even the lissome wind grows heavy in its grief... But not that mortals could ever see a moment oh so brief.)
