:'''Hawad:''' I guess I'll rest around the pitstop once I'm done here.
:'''Hawad:''' Too bad I can't see that flower again...

:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Hawad:''' I won? Uh... Thanks for going easy on me, dear guest?
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Hawad:''' You're really good! If I had your skills, I'd be able to talk business with just about anyone!
:{{DIcon}} You are...
::'''Hawad:''' Hello, I'm a traveling merchant who sells desert specialties. Unfortunately, I only brought a few items with me this time, and they've been booked.
::'''Hawad:''' But if you're interested, you can take a look for the moment.
::{{DIcon}} What are your best sellers?
::'''Hawad:''' [[Ajilenakh Nuts]] have been the most in demand lately.
::'''Hawad:''' Ajilenakh Nuts are a common crop that the people of the desert used to plant. They make pretty good desserts and candy because of their high sugar content.
::'''Hawad:''' Sweets make people happy, so I guess that's where its popularity comes from.
::'''Hawad:''' I heard researchers from the [[Akademiya]] are even trying to find out which type of light produces sweeter Ajilenakh Nuts. I really look forward to their results.
:{{DIcon}} What flower?
::'''Hawad:''' Ah... I mean [[Gohar|a girl]] from here. She is the flower of this place. I only have to look at her smile from a distance and I feel cleansed already.
::'''Hawad:''' But I heard that she's gone to [[Sumeru City]] to look for her lover.
::'''Hawad:''' What a pity... I don't even know her name...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Hawad:''' See you.
