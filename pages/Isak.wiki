==Profile==
<!-- Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->

Isak is a young boy who lives in Aaru Village. When the Akademiya sent people who had succumbed to forbidden knowledge to the village, he took a liking to one of them, a scholar named [[Khalil]] as he reminded him of his biological grandfather. Khalil was later kidnapped from the village under [[Rahman]]'s orders when the Akademiya hired them to do so, prompting Isak to accompany the [[Traveler]], [[Dehya]], [[Cyno]] and [[Alhaitham]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Secret of the Scorching Desert}}</ref>

During the Akademiya infiltration, Isak volunteered to disguise himself as [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]], luring the [[Corps of Thirty]] guards in the city to the Grand Bazaar.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Jnagarbha Day}}</ref> Once the situation was resolved, Khalil's mind was restored and he decided to stay with Isak due to the care he had shown him. Isak is currently studying hard, as Alhaitham mentions in one of his [[Birthday/Alhaitham|birthday mails]] that he is now proficient in reading and writing in [[Sumeru Script|Vedanagari script]] according to several researchers stationed in the village, and the Akademiya sent him some primers for his talent.<ref>[[Mail/... (2024-02-11)|Alhaitham's Birthday Mail]]</ref>
