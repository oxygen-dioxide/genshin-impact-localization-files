==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Makhfi:''' The life of a researcher is more than just researching topics.
:{{DIcon}} What happened?
::'''Makhfi:''' Sorry you had to hear me complain.
::'''Makhfi:''' I was just lamenting that researchers have to deal with so many things on top of their own research.
::'''Makhfi:''' Such as official Akademiya assignments, delegated tasks from mentors, getting along with peers, and sometimes, even inquiry from the matra.
::'''Makhfi:''' *sigh* If only these things could just resolve themselves, like a tree shedding its leaves...
::'''Makhfi:''' Now I understand more or less why Tighnari left the Akademiya.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Makhfi:''' The simple life is gone forever...{{Dialogue End}}

==Event Dialogue==
===A Parade of Providence===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Makhfi:''' I didn't expect Tighnari, who rarely shows himself in the city, to participate in the [[Interdarshan Championship]].
:'''Makhfi:''' I don't know much about Tighnari. He doesn't strike me as someone who is fame-hungry... Perhaps too many people were recommending him, and he didn't want to disappoint them.
:'''Makhfi:''' Speaking of which, I think he's planning to hold a new lecture next month.
:'''Makhfi:''' I must note down the time of his lecture before I forget... I can't miss it!
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
* Makhfi may be the unnamed researcher featured in one of the photos shown at the end of {{Quest|The Unanswerable Problems}}, as she also mentions Tighnari in her dialogues.
