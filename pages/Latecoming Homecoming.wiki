{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Giulietta)
:'''???:''' Do you two happen to be heading to sea as well? If so, please, could I trouble you to bring me along to Bayda Harbor?
:{{DIcon}} My Waverider's pretty small...
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, but I don't intend to go out to sea right now.
:'''???:''' Ah, I see... Oh dear, this is going to be a toughie...
:'''Paimon:''' Well, if it's really urgent, we could still help...
:'''Giulietta:''' Oh! What kind souls you are! In any case, my name's Giulietta, and I sell instruments.
:'''Giulietta:''' Not long ago, I inked an order with some outlander gentlemen for a batch of materials from them. I mean, even the greatest artisan wouldn't be able to fashion an instrument from nothing!
:'''Giulietta:''' According to the contract, the payment must be made these two days at Bayda Harbor. But I overslept and missed the last boat...
:'''Giulietta:''' *sigh* It might be the nightmares I've been having lately, but I couldn't sleep well... It is my fault, of course, but right now, I need to get to Bayda Harbor.
:'''Giulietta:''' So if you'd be willing to help, I'd be immensely grateful. Three times the going rate &mdash; that's what I'll pay.
:'''Paimon:''' Th&mdash;Three times!?
:{{DIcon}} You sure are generous, huh?
:'''Giulietta:''' Well, it's a matter of trust and reputation. This is life and death for us businesspeople.
:'''Paimon:''' W&mdash;Well, sure seems that way...
:{{DIcon}} Well, what are you waiting for? Get onboard, sailor!
::'''Giulietta:''' Thank you so much, {{MC|m=good sir|f=kind ma'am}}!
:{{DIcon}} Hold on, I have some things to handle first...
::'''Giulietta:''' Alright, but do hurry. Time waits for no one...

;(Talk to Giulietta again, if second option was chosen)
:'''Giulietta:''' Ah, you're back. Glorious! We can go now, can we not?
:{{DIcon}} Alright, get onboard.
::'''Giulietta:''' In that case, let us not delay. To Bayda Harbor we go!
:{{DIcon}} You'll have to wait a while longer, I have something that needs doing.
::'''Giulietta:''' *sigh* Alright. But do come back as soon as you can &mdash; we have an agreement, don't we?
----
;(Choosing the first option)
:{{Black Screen|You cross the sea and arrive in Bayda Harbor...}}
:'''Giulietta:''' Yes! We're here!
:'''Giulietta:''' Thank you both so much! Now I can deliver the payment as promised &mdash; we can't have our outlander friends viewing us Fontainians as fickle folk who flip on their agreements.
:'''Giulietta:''' Well then, here's the payment, as promised!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, shiny, shiny Mora. As long as there's some to be had, we can do business!
:'''Paimon:''' That said, {{Traveler}}, since we're here already, why don't we have a look around? Even if we were to go back to Petrichor now...
:'''???:''' Hmm? Did you two come from Petrichor by any chance?
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Don't just talk to people from behind like that! You gave Paimon a fright!
:'''???:''' Oh, did I startle you? My apologies, truly. I simply could not contain myself upon hearing my hometown's name...
:'''Paimon:''' Did you really have to get this excited, though?
:'''???:''' Well... I left home when I was young, and I haven't been back since. Ten years flew by while I did business in Sumeru. Ten years without word from home...
:'''Giustino:''' Well, since you've come from there, could you tell me how things have been going? ... Right, I forgot to introduce myself. Just call me Giustino.
:'''Paimon:''' Hello there, Giustino. Paimon's name's Paimon, and this is {{Traveler}}. And you've come to the right people &mdash; we have a "deep" understanding of Petrichor, after all!
:'''Paimon:''' (Hmm, wouldn't he think we're crazy if we told him that we followed a cat and wound up disrupting an ancient plot and resolving the crisis in his hometown, though?)
:{{DIcon}} (Well, those things did happen, but...)
:{{DIcon}} (It would sound like pure nonsense...)
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, Petrichor's doing great! How great, you ask? As great as before, that's how!
:'''Giustino:''' Really? Just as before, then? That's good, that's good...
:'''Paimon:''' Speaking of which, wouldn't it be better for you to go, since you're a local, rather than rely on us outsiders?
:'''Giustino:''' You speak reason! I should, yes. I did not bat an eyelid when I left it all behind back then, yet now I shrink back from my desire to return.
:'''Giustino:''' How strange. My courage fails me as I grow older...
:'''Giustino:''' If I hadn't found this flute in my baggage while packing...
::[[File:Latecoming Homecoming Flute.png|x100px]]
::'''A short flute made of bone. You can see the faint marks time has left upon it.'''
:'''???:''' ...
:'''Giustino:''' When I left home, I had nothing with me but this flute. In truth, my family disapproved of my departure, and my father snuck the instrument out to me at the last minute.
:'''Giustino:''' Haha, good times, though. Not a Mora to my name, but with the flute's melodic strains flowing free, a fire in my belly, and a dream, it was like the whole world was mine for the seizing.
:'''Giustino:''' Later, I would make lots of friends in Sumeru, and my business would grow. *sigh* If only I could have written them a letter, but I had all but forgotten my family and home...
:'''Giustino:''' Ahem... Anyway, if I may make such a request, would you be willing to take me with you when you return to Petrichor?
:{{DIcon}} So, you gonna pay us triple, too?
:'''Giustino:''' Triple!?
:'''Paimon:''' That's right! The lady we just ferried over had urgent business to attend to, so she paid us triple for the ride!
:'''Giustino:''' Well... I should have enough for that. Alright, I'll pay you triple too. "Strike while the iron is hot," as they say &mdash; since I've decided to return home, any delay will be detrimental.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, we're not exactly professional boatmen or anything... But hehe, such premiums are tough to refuse!
:{{DIcon}} My Waverider's a fast and steady boat. Hop onboard, and we'll be off.
::'''Giustino:''' Thank you.
:{{DIcon}} Could you wait for a moment?
::'''Giustino:''' Of course. No worries.

;(Talk to Giustino again, if second option was chosen)
:'''Giustino:''' Shall we head out now?
:{{DIcon}} Let's go.
:{{DIcon}} Just a while more...
::'''Giustino:''' Of course, no trouble at all.
----
;(Choosing the first option)
:{{Black Screen|From Bayda Harbor, you then return to Petrichor...}}
:'''Giustino:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Err, you don't look so good. You sure you're okay?
:'''Giustino:''' I... I'm just a bit seasick. Ugh... Sorry! I&mdash;I'll just throw up over there for a bit. Be right back!
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Uh, sure, but don't forget to come back as soon as possible!
:{{Black Screen|After a good long while...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, something's not right. Why isn't Giustino back yet?
:{{DIcon}} Did he vomit till he passed out?
::'''Paimon:''' Eh!? That serious? But you were keeping the boat pretty steady... Or maybe it's because Paimon floats...
:{{DIcon}} Uh oh, is he trying to wiggle his way out of paying?
::'''Paimon:''' Huh? Didn't he say he was a big-shot booming businessman, though? Was he fibbing?
:'''Paimon:''' Either way, we've gotta find him, and fast!

;(Talk to Loredan, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' Hello there. Have you seen a merchant from Fontaine dressed in Sumeru garb?
:'''Loredan:''' Huh? A Fontainian wearing clothes from Sumeru? Sorry, I was a bit busy thinking about my composition, so I didn't notice.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, alright then... Guess we should ask elsewhere, {{Traveler}}.

;(Talk to Contarini, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' Hello there. Have you seen a merchant from Fontaine dressed in Sumeru garb?
:'''Contarini:''' I've not seen any such person. Has something happened? If there's an emergency case that requires the Special Patrol's services...
:'''Paimon:''' Well, it's not anything urgent, really... Anyway, we'll be looking elsewhere!

;(Talk to Giovanni)
:'''Paimon:''' Hello there. Have you seen a merchant from Fontaine dressed in Sumeru garb?
:{{Black Screen|You explain the situation...}}
:'''Giovanni:''' So this fellow you're looking for is named "Giustino," and he claims to be from Petrichor?
:'''Paimon:''' That's right! Have you seen him? Wait &mdash; were you two acquainted from before?
:'''Giovanni:''' Just acquainted? Hah!
:'''Giovanni:''' Still, even if I recognize him, I wonder if he still recognizes his little brother. So many years away, and not a letter sent back. Why, I've already had a tombstone erected for him behind the town!
:'''Giovanni:''' And now he's back... and he hasn't paid his boat fare? Disgraceful.
:{{DIcon}} Disgraceful indeed.
:{{DIcon}} We shouldn't comment too much as outsiders...
:'''Paimon:''' W&mdash;Wait, but we're... the victims here, aren't we? And if Giustino really did faint from discomfort somewhere...
:'''Giovanni:''' *sigh* Fine, I'll go search together with you. I'm a local, so I know our surroundings better. Also, I have some idea as to where he'll be.
----
;(Approach the marked location)
:'''Agent:''' Huh? Are you pulling my leg? "I'm sorry, but I really don't remember"?
:'''Agent:''' Don't you know what this uniform means? Doesn't it remind you of anything?
:'''Giustino:''' O&mdash;Of course I know what you do, but I'm debt-free! Or I should be... unless a friend took a loan in my name...
:'''Agent:''' A friend? Who cares about those excuses? I only recognize what's written here on the contract in black and white &mdash; and it's my duty to make violators pay up.
:'''Agent:''' This is my first job, you know! I wanted to be worthy of this uniform, so I showed up at the specified location three days in advance! Three days!
:'''Agent:''' I spent them thinking about the excuses you'd make to get out of paying, and how I'd respond...
:'''Agent:''' And then you just upped and ran! All that effort I put in, wasted! Now, I've no choice but to go by the book and...
:'''Agent:''' Teach you a lesson first, and then bring you back to report!
:'''Giustino:''' No! I don't want to leave Petrichor anymore! H&mdash;Help me!
:'''Giovanni:''' Stop it! Does any amount of money owed warrant such cruel treatment!?
:'''Giovanni:''' Please, {{Traveler}}! Don't let him hurt Giustino! Only you can stop him now!

;(After the dialogue)
:'''Paimon:''' Before figuring out what exactly is going on, make him stop first!

;(After defeating the Pyro Agent)
:'''Agent:''' H&mdash;Hired help!? Seriously, would you rather pay through the nose for a powerful bodyguard than just follow a contract? I'll... never understand you merchants...
:{{DIcon}} No, I just couldn't control myself after seeing your uniform...
::'''Agent:''' ...Huh!?
:{{DIcon}} Actually, I'm also here to collect a debt.
::'''Paimon:''' That's right! He hasn't paid us our triple boat fare either!
:'''Paimon:''' ...But y'know, if he's in this much debt, it seems unlikely that we'll get paid at all...
:'''Giustino:''' No, I... still have enough for the boat fare. I counted &mdash; I should be fine on that front.
:'''Giovanni:''' Then what about the contract and debt he speaks of? Is that, perchance, the "souvenir" you're giving us after more than ten years?
:'''Giustino:''' How could you say that, Giovanni? I really don't know a thing about the contract he's talking about! *sigh* I don't know what to say to make you believe me, though.
:'''Agent:''' Heh. The handbook says that people will lie and do all they can to wriggle out of debt, but the contract is clearly written &mdash; don't you even try.
:'''Agent:''' You still owe us payment for ten crates of materials to make those blasted flutes of yours...
:'''Giustino:''' ...Wait, what did you say? Flutes?
:'''Agent:''' ...Are you still sticking to the pretense even now, "Participazia"? ... Grr, you Fontainians sure have names that are annoying to pronounce...
:'''Giustino:''' Sorry... but who's that? My name is Giustino. Giustino Pasquale...
:'''Agent:''' ...?
:'''Agent:''' O&mdash;One moment! Let me see... Giu? Ju? Pas... Giulietta Participazia, from Petrichor...
:'''Agent:''' Err. This seems to be... a woman?
:'''Paimon:''' Uhh... Ah...
:{{DIcon}} Um...
:'''Agent:''' W&mdash;Wait! If you're not that woman, then why were you going on about some "flute" back there at Bayda Harbor?
:'''Giustino:''' ...I was talking about... this flute?
::[[File:Latecoming Homecoming Flute.png|x100px]]
::'''A short flute made of bone. You can see the faint marks time has left upon it.'''
:'''Giovanni:''' ...
:'''Giustino:''' This is the flute my father gave me when I was about to leave home. He hoped that I would inherit the family business of instrument-making, but I...
:'''Giustino:''' *sigh* Forget it.
:'''Agent:''' Hold on. If this had nothing to do with you, then why did you run?
:'''Giustino:''' "I'm sorry, but I really don't remember," I said that, didn't I? But you sounded so aggressive and looked so frightening. What was I going to do except run?
:'''Agent:''' Well, this is my first job &mdash; one to remember! Of course I had to double my enthusiasm!
:{{DIcon}} To the point that you showed up three days in advance?
::'''Paimon:''' You were way too anxious!
:{{DIcon}} Well, it looks like your career's in dire straits now...
:'''Agent:''' Ugh. Then where did that Giulietta Participazia go...
:'''Paimon:''' Speaking of that, the lady we ferried over first works in the instrument business... Y'know, the one who was going to be late for a business transaction? Didn't she call herself "Giulietta"?
:'''Agent:''' What? So she's in Bayda Harbor now? I have to find her as soon as possible...
:'''Paimon:''' She seems to care a lot about credibility, so she probably wouldn't default...
:'''Agent:''' You're going to get scammed if you hold onto such naive ideas. People lie &mdash; that's what the handbook says! Anyway, I've got to go find her, immediately!
:{{Black Screen|The Agent departs...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Seriously, where does he get the cheek to lecture Paimon based on that handbook of his!? He was the one who made a mistake...
:'''Giovanni:''' What a farce... I see you're the same as ever, Big Brother. Always sucking people into whatever trouble you get into!
:'''Giovanni:''' I don't know whether to laugh or be angry.
:'''Giustino:''' I'm sorry, Giovanni.
:'''Giovanni:''' And sorry for the trouble, you two, but this is no place for a chat. Let's find a spot where I can treat you to some snacks, and we'll talk.

;(Approach the marked location)
:'''Giovanni:''' Our town's a small place, and our desserts and tea are all quite ordinary, so they might not look like much to you who have traveled and seen much...
:'''Giustino:''' Giovanni, why do you have to talk like this? My heart is made of flesh and blood, just as yours is. It, too, can be hurt.
:'''Giovanni:''' Is that so? And here I thought that the heart of one who cares so little about their family would be made of immovable stone.
:'''Giustino:''' I...
:'''Paimon:''' (Well... Paimon didn't think it'd turn out like this... This is so awkward!)
:{{DIcon}} Stop arguing, you're going to spoil the taste of the snacks.
:{{DIcon}} If I'd known, I'd have gone with that Agent...
:'''Paimon:''' A&mdash;Anyway, you brothers have been reunited after many years, so shouldn't you be happier about that...?
:'''Giovanni:''' ...
:'''Giustino:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, {{Traveler}}, c'mon! Help talk some sense into 'em, would you?
:{{DIcon}} I envy you. At least you've been reunited.
:{{DIcon}} There's no point butting into someone else's family matters.
::'''Paimon:''' Well, that's true, but...
:'''Paimon:''' Actually, {{Traveler}}'s still searching for {{MC|m=his|f=her}} missing {{MC|m=sister|f=brother}}...
:{{Black Screen|You briefly explain the reason for your journey to the two brothers...}}
:'''Giovanni:''' I see... It must be hard, to have to scour the world for your family &mdash; and you're so young, too.
:'''Giustino:''' I'm sure your {{MC|m=sister|f=brother}} has {{MC|m=her|f=his}} reasons. I don't think {{MC|m=she|f=he}}'s forgotten you or has intentionally broken off contact. Please, don't hate {{MC|m=her|f=him}} for it.
:{{DIcon}} Err... Thanks?
:{{DIcon}} Actually, never mind my problem. You two...
:'''Giovanni:''' Ah. *sigh* To have been guided by a youth like you... We have truly shamed ourselves as elders.
:'''Giovanni:''' We may have had our disagreements, but we are still brothers...
:'''Giustino:''' Thank you... Giovanni.
:'''Giovanni:''' Ah, but don't be so quick to thank me. It was you who voluntarily gave up the family business. Now, I am the legal heir to the Pasquale name, no matter how you...
:'''Giustino:''' It's alright, Giovanni, I know what you mean. But of all the things I've lost, I regained the most precious of them &mdash; as for the rest, I don't need them.
:'''Giovanni:''' Again, don't speak too soon. That novice debt collector wasn't talking out of his hat when he said that "people lie"!
:'''Giustino:''' In that case, let us sign a contract &mdash; write a statement in black and white! Or perhaps, if some other means suits you better...
:'''Giovanni:''' We don't have to go that far...
:'''Giustino:''' Ah, it seems you're quite the same as you used to be. But I've changed. I'm not the man I was before. Let me work in your workshop.
:'''Giustino:''' I shall be your assistant, just as you were mine when we were little.
:'''Giovanni:''' Do your best, then. I'm not going easy on you just because you're my big brother.
:'''Giustino:''' Of course. No worries.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, so guess the two of you have made up now, eh?
:'''Giustino:''' Yes. Thank you so much for your help. Why, I somehow feel as if the triple-price fare was hardly enough! It's just a shame I only have this much on me...
:'''Giovanni:''' If you can sit yourself down and work hard in the workshop, repaying their kindness would be a simple matter.
:'''Giustino:''' Hear that? Giovanni's going to take good care of me. If we should have the chance to meet again, I'll treat you two!

;(Talk to Giovanni or Giustino, optional)
:'''Giovanni:''' Big Brother... When you meet Martha and Moce back at the workshop, just let me do the talking.
:'''Giustino:''' A&mdash;Alright, sure! But who are they again...
:'''Giovanni:''' Martha is my wife, and Moce, my son. You remember meeting the Valiers' daughter? She would often come to the workshop and... Never mind. I'll tell you the story later.
