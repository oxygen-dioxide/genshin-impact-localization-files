==New Abilities and Attacks==
===Amethyst Prisms===
[[File:Hypostatic_Symphony_Amethyst_Prism_Reaction.gif|thumb|right|Amethyst Prism Disabled with Elemental Reaction]]
Unlike the standard [[Electro Hypostasis]], this creature has special Amethyst Prism objects surrounding the map that when activated by {{Color|Electro DMG}} deal {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} to nearby characters, and can only be deactivated by [[Elemental Reactions]]. One can choose to avoid the corners of the map where they are situated.

==Returning Abilities and Attacks==
For most of the attacks below, the core will be exposed for a few seconds after the boss uses the attack. Use this opportunity to deal damage to the boss.
*'''Rock, Scissors, Paper:''' Flies next to the player and turns into a giant fist, punching in the player's direction. Then, turns into giant scissors and deals damage in a "cutting" motion. Finally, turns into a giant hand and slaps the ground in front of it. Sometimes only performs 1 or 2 of the attacks, but will always perform them in the given order. Dash to dodge.
*'''Drill: '''Turns into a giant drill and rams across the arena. Dash to dodge.
*'''Missiles:''' Flies into the air and forms a circle with its shell pieces. Forms homing elemental missiles using its shell pieces and fires them at the player. Move around to dodge.
*'''Clap''': Quickly flies next to the player and forms a large wall, which folds in a "clapping" motion very quickly, dealing damage in an area in front of the wall. Dash sideways to dodge.
*'''Tremors:''' Moves to the center of the arena and sends out small waves of shell pieces. Weave between the waves to dodge.
*'''Cage: '''Sends shell pillars into the sky and rains them down in a circle formation around the player, trapping them. Then, rains Electro meteors within the cage. The cage can be broken by attacking the pillars with elemental damage. The core will be exposed '''during '''this attack. Dash toward the first pillar, and then out of the cage before the complete cage is formed.
*'''Rotating Lasers: '''Forms a ring around its core with its shell pieces and fires lasers out in 8 directions (as opposed to only 4 directions in the [[Electro Hypostasis|original version]]). The ring will then rotate, the lasers moving with it. When the lasers turn off, the shell pieces quickly converge on the core. Sprint in a circle close to the ring to dodge lasers. Alternatively, stand '''inside''' the ring to dodge the lasers, but make sure to leave the ring before the pieces converge (indicated by the ground rune disappearing). The core will be exposed '''during '''this attack, allowing the player to safely continue damaging the Hypostasis for a duration.
*'''Rebirth: '''When HP is low (approx. 5%), teleports to the center of the arena and forms multiple large Revival Prisms, which can only be damaged by Elemental damage (may only be reaction damage, such as Pyro and Cryo). After 15 seconds, absorbs the particles and heals for approx. 15% of its HP for each particle absorbed. If a particle is destroyed, it does not add to the healing and does not respawn next time the Electro Hypostasis uses Power Surge. When the player destroys all Electro particles, the Electro Hypostasis dies immediately. Using a wide reaching Elemental Burst (such as [[Xiangling]]'s [[Pyronado]]) is suggested.

*Total Score: 3,555
*Time Remaining: 23s

The sprinting variation was not taken as it would close to double the damage taken from the boss (+75%) just for sprinting. Avoid the prisms surrounding the stage that deal major damage when activated.
