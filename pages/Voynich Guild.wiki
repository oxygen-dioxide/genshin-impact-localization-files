The '''Voynich Guild''' is an organization from [[Snezhnaya]]. According to [[Liben]], it is the "strongest force" in [[Nod-Krai]]<ref name="Liben Nov 2024">{{Ref/NPC|Liben}}</ref> that is located in the southernmost part of Snezhnaya. The people of the Voynich Guild comprise of merchants from [[Nasha Town]], which is also the guild's main base of operations.<ref>YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbDXwuUWxhY&ab_channel=GenshinImpact Behind the Scenes of Genshin Impact "Let's Start With Nod-Krai" | Genshin Impact #NodKrai]</ref>

Liben states that they are seemingly the only force in the area, with no court of law or organization like [[Mondstadt]]'s [[Knights of Favonius]] to uphold law and order. Liben tells of the guild's competency and generosity in retrieving his goods and thoroughly compensating him after he had been robbed.<ref name="Liben Nov 2024" />
