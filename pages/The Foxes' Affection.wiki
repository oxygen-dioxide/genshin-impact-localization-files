'''The Foxes' Affection''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] that takes place in [[Dragonspine]]. It is gated over 6 in real life days (5 server resets) and requires the completion of [[Lost in the Snow]].

==Procedure==
Put {{Item|Berry|x=2|25}} on the feeding bowl near the camp once every day. After feeding the foxes for 5 days, a [[Precious Chest]] will spawn, along with the foxes, on the 6th day, with a [[Crimson Agate]] in it.

==Notes==
* Completing this objective grants the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement "[[Untellable Tale]]."
* It does not matter what the player does to the foxes on the final day. However, after the player opens the Precious Chest and leaves the area, the foxes will also leave.
* The foxes are considered targets and may be killed by auto-aimed attacks such as [[Passion Overload]], [[Guoba Attack]], and the Kindling Arrows from [[Firework Flare-Up]]. To light the campfire without harming the foxes, it is recommended to use a fully charged [[Aimed Shot]] from a {{Pyro}} [[bow]] character without auto-aimed attacks, such as [[Amber]] or [[Yoimiya]] with [[Niwabi Fire-Dance]] in effect.
