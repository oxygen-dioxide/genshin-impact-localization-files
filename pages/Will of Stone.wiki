==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Millelith soldier [[Jiayi]] wants to send a gift to his daughter. [[Little Liu]], but he has no time to return to [[Qingce Village]], and as such is looking for someone to help him out...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Jiayi)
:'''Jiayi:''' Ah, it's been a long time since I was last at Qingce Village. Little Liu, Daddy misses you so much...
:{{DIcon}} Is everything alright?
:'''Jiayi:''' Oh, it's you, traveler. Thanks for your concern. Nothing's wrong. I just... miss my daughter.
:'''Jiayi:''' I told her that once this shift ended, I'd take leave to spend some time with her for a few days at Qingce Village.
:'''Jiayi:''' But who knew that such a huge thing would suddenly happen in Liyue Harbor. Not only was every soldier on leave recalled, but everyone at their post has also had their leave canceled.
:'''Jiayi:''' Now we have to man our stations all day. Forget taking leave, I need to find someone who can take over my post even if I want to get a sip of water.
:'''Jiayi:''' I'd prepared my gifts, too &mdash; a huge bag of toys... But what shall I do with it now?
:'''Jiayi:''' That's right! Traveler, could I ask you to bring these toys to my daughter, Little Liu? She stays at Qingce Village. If you ask Granny Ruoxin, you're sure to find her.
:{{DIcon}} Lay it on me.
::'''Jiayi:''' Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
:;(Obtain [[Jiayi's Gifts]])
:{{DIcon}} I've got other matters to attend to.
::'''Jiayi:''' Alright. Qingce Village is such a long way off, anyway. I should think of another solution rather than trouble you...
:;(Does not accept the quest)

;(Talk to Jiayi again)
:'''Jiayi:''' *sigh* I was counting down the days before I'd be able to go back. Just two or three days more...
:'''Jiayi:''' With all the leave I'd saved up until this point, I could have spent over a week together with Little Liu.
:'''Jiayi:''' But with but one order, all our leaves were canceled. Even the people on leave were recalled.
:'''Jiayi:''' In my experience, this means at least another month without any hope of returning to Qingce Village. What terrible luck...
----
;(Talk to Granny Ruoxin)
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Oh, where has that child run off to...
:{{DIcon}} Can I ask about Little Liu?
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Are you looking for her? *sigh* What perfectly terrible timing. I don't know where's she's gone.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' She received a letter that her father asked someone to send over from Liyue Harbor that stated that he'd be back soon.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Little Liu was so happy. She said she wanted to prepare a gift for her father, and roped some other children into picking fruits and flowers...
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' But a few days afterward, he sent word, saying that he had a last-minute assignment and wouldn't be able-to return.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' She threw a tantrum, and nothing we could say could dissuade her from insisting that she would go to Liyue Harbor herself, since her father wasn't coming.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' *sigh* We've already sent people out to look for her, but if you're willing, you can join in as well.
:{{DIcon}} I'll give it a go.
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' I apologize for the trouble. *sigh* This child...
:{{DIcon}} Where do you think she's headed?
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' I doubt she could go far. She's probably still close by, but the wilds are a dangerous place... Please, find her quickly.

;(Talk to Granny Ruoxin again)
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' That Jiayi, too. How could he just cancel on his daughter like that...
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' She doesn't see him any more than a few times a year. Is this how a father should behave?
:{{DIcon}} He's doing this for Liyue Harbor...
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' That's what he says every year. I've lost count of the number of times he's said that...
:{{DIcon}} He's just doing his job...
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Well, it's also his job to take care of his daughter. Little Liu is growing up day by day.
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' If he's not careful, she'll be the one going out to work by the time he returns.
::'''Granny Ruoxin:''' This father and his daughter just can't get together, can they?
----
;(Investigate the first area)
:'''Paimon:''' If Paimon were to guess, Paimon would say that these berries were picked by Little Liu. Quick, we must find her!

;(Investigate the second area)
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, so many footprints... This can't be good. We must hurry and find Little Liu!

;(Upon finding Little Liu)
:'''Paimon:''' Look over there, it's Little Liu!
:'''Paimon:''' She's surrounded by hilichurls! Quick, you know what to do!
----
;(Talk to Little Liu)
:'''Little Liu:''' Are you here to catch me and take me back to Qingce Village?
:{{DIcon}} Granny Ruoxin is worried sick about you.
::'''Little Liu:''' Hmph. So you are here to catch me. Well, I'm not going back.
:{{DIcon}} I have something for you...
::'''Little Liu:''' I don't need anything from you. You're just trying to bribe me.
:'''Little Liu:''' Go back and tell the villagers that I'm going to Liyue Harbor to look for Daddy.
:'''Little Liu:''' They don't have to worry. Once I find him, I'll just talk to him for a while, then I'll come back.
:;(Little Liu begins to run off)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Wait up!
:'''Paimon:''' Little Liu's run off. We need to catch up with her and make sure she's safe.

;(Talk to Little Liu after defeating the hilichurls)
:'''Little Liu:''' What are you following me for, anyway? I said, I'm going to Liyue Harbor!
:'''Little Liu:''' I'll get around these monsters myself. They won't find me.
:'''Little Liu:''' Don't treat me like a kid! I'm a grown-up now!
:{{DIcon}} This is from your father...
:'''Little Liu:''' From Daddy? Did he ask you to send it over...
:'''Little Liu:''' I'm sure it's more things for children to play with... if it's not kites, it's dolls.
:{{DIcon}} You don't like them?
:'''Little Liu:''' ...I do. It's something Daddy gave me. How could I not like it?
:'''Little Liu:''' But if I always like these things, doesn't that mean that I'll always be a kid?
:'''Little Liu:''' If I keep playing with them, when will I become an adventurer, or get my own Vision?
:{{DIcon}} What did you want a Vision for, again?
:'''Little Liu:''' If I had a Vision, I'd be able to do so many things, whether it be making money or something else...
:'''Little Liu:''' Then, Daddy wouldn't have to work in Liyue Harbor all the time. He could come back and spend time with me.
:'''Little Liu:''' Right now, I can't even go to Liyue Harbor myself without a Vision...
:'''Little Liu:''' But since Daddy has already sent you here with his presents, I might just be giving him more trouble by going to look for him.
:'''Little Liu:''' {{Color|buzzword|I had presents ready for him too}}. I wanted to give him a surprise... But I can't take them to him now.
:'''Little Liu:''' {{Color|buzzword|If only someone could help me do that}}... It's alright. I'm going back. There's no need to follow me, I know the way home.
----
;(Talk to Granny Ruoxin after Little Liu returns)
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' You've returned. Thank you for your help. Little Liu has already returned, and with quite the bag of things, too.
:{{DIcon}} Jiayi sent them to her.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' Did he, now... But still, what Little Liu really wants is for him to come back in person.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' That child really has grown up like the bamboo around the village. Blink, and you'll miss just how much she's grown.
:'''Granny Ruoxin:''' The days when your child is young will never return again once you miss them...
----
;(Talk to Little Liu before talking to Jiayi)
:'''Little Liu:''' Dolls... kites... pinwheels. Daddy sent these again, just like I thought.
:'''Little Liu:''' *sigh* It's just a shame that I wasn't able to send him my gifts too.
:{{DIcon}} I'll take them to your father.
:'''Little Liu:''' You'll help me? Well... Even though you don't have a Vision either, it looked like those monsters didn't give you a hard time at all.
:'''Little Liu:''' I guess we'll have to do it this way, then. Thank you.
:'''Little Liu:''' *sigh* If only I could be as strong as you...
:;(Obtain [[Little Liu's Gifts]])

;(Talk to Little Liu again)
:'''Little Liu:''' If only I had a Vision! With it, I could do so many things, whether it's making money or whatever...
:'''Little Liu:''' At least, I would have no trouble making it to Liyue on my own.
:'''Little Liu:''' But, how do I get my hands on one...
----
;(Talk to Jiayi, without talking to Little Liu)
:'''Jiayi:''' Have you handed the presents to Little Liu yet?
:{{DIcon}} I have.
::'''Jiayi:''' That's good. Those toys are her favorite. Thank you &mdash; please take these as a token of my thanks.
:{{DIcon}} She'd prefer it if you were home.
::'''Jiayi:''' I want to go back too. But with Liyue Harbor in this state, I don't think that's possible for the time being.
::'''Jiayi:''' Still, thank you so much. I hope those presents will improve her mood a bit &mdash; they are her favorites, after all.
::'''Jiayi:''' Please, take this as thanks.

;(Talk to Jiayi, if you got Little Liu's presents)
:'''Jiayi:''' Have you handed the presents to Little Liu yet?
:{{DIcon}} Well, this is from Little Liu.
:'''Jiayi:''' This... is from Little Liu, for me? So many... How much work did she have to put in...
:'''Jiayi:''' I want nothing more than to drop everything and run back to Qingce Village right now. But the Ministry of Civil Affairs would...
:'''Jiayi:''' Thank you once again. Take these as thanks, please.
:'''Jiayi:''' *sigh* I have no idea when this whole affair will be over, or when the Ministry will approve my leave, either...
