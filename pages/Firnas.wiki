'''Firnas''' is a scholar at [[Sumeru Akademiya]]. [[Hosseini]] mentions him in passing while talking about "our great tutor Firnas."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Muddy Bizarre Adventure (Part 2)}}</ref>

A "great master Firnas" is mentioned in [[Wings of the Forest]]'s description, which recounts how he tried, and failed, to invent a [[Wind Glider]] that did not require [[Barbatos]]' blessings. The narrator emphasizes twice that this Firnas "is not the current great lecturer," although the truthfulness of this statement is left to reader interpretation.
