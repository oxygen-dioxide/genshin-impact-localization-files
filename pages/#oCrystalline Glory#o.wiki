|description    = A harp model with exquisite craftsmanship, its aqua strings shimmer like the sunlight reflected off rippling waves. It is the same design as the harp model found in the Faded Castle. According to legend, certain epic tales of glorious deeds were sung to the accompaniment of this type of harp. Today, though the protagonists of those stories are long dead, their exalted achievements still dazzle brilliantly, like the instrument's bright strings.
