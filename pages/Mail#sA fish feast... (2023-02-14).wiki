|text    = Hey, you wanna hear something cool? I caught a fish this morning almost the size of a small boat! Plus, it happened to be my birthday, so I asked [[Wanmin Restaurant]] to help me prepare a feast using it.

Speaking of said fish, we managed to hook it by the mouth at first, but who'd thought its tail could be so strong that its slaps left several of my sailors red and wrecked? And even after all that, it managed to break free and get away, swimming back to the sea.

Of course, if that's how the story ended, then my fleet wouldn't be worthy of being called [[The Crux]]. To make a long struggle short, we got it! It's just boiled fish now, haha. Unlike some other fish out in the sea, the meat of this one is much firmer, and the taste is just splendid. I'm not lying. You gotta try it!
