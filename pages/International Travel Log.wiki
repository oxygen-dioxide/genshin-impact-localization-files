{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Midori)
:'''Midori:''' Well, I'm running out of new stories to tell Kouichi...
:{{DIcon}} What kind of new story?
:'''Midori:''' It's a new story told by Uncle Ramsay.
:'''Midori:''' He said he's been to many countries and seen many interesting things. In order to record these things, he wrote something called the travelogue.
:'''Midori:''' He showed me a lot of his travelogues!
:'''Midori:''' For example, there's a kind of iron carriage that flies in the sky in [[Fontaine]]. It runs along an invisible road. It takes no time to travel from one end of the village to the other.
:'''Midori:''' There's a special kind of grass in [[Sumeru]], which can be planted anywhere. It can be planted in soil, water, or sand. Once it's planted, it will sprout and grow.
:'''Midori:''' And... And... There's a kind of... hmmm... boat that can stay at the bottom of the sea for a long time!
:'''Midori:''' By riding in that boat, people can go to the deep sea to do all kinds of things and see all kinds of fish!
:{{DIcon}} Really...
::'''Midori:''' Anyway, that's what Uncle Ramsay told me...
:{{DIcon}} Did he tell you about [[Snezhnaya]]?
::'''Midori:''' Snezhnaya? Well, I don't think so.
:'''Midori:''' Well, that's not the point!
:'''Midori:''' Recently, Uncle Ramsay stopped sending me his travelogue for some reason. So I'm running out of stories to tell Kouichi.
:'''Midori:''' I know that Uncle Ramsay has been staying at the [[Komore Teahouse]]. I wanted to go find him. But the gatekeeper, Sister [[Kozue]], wouldn't let me in because I'm a kid...
:'''Midori:''' You look old enough. Can you help me ask Uncle Ramsay, what happened to those travelogues?
:{{DIcon}} Ehm, I am not that old...
:'''Midori:''' Anyway! You look like a reliable person. Please help me!
:{{DIcon}} I'll see.
:'''Midori:''' Oh? Are you also interested in reading those travelogues? No problem. Just give them to me when you're finished.
:'''Midori:''' I... I'll go with you. Although I can't get in, I can wait for you near the teahouse...
:'''Midori:''' Ah, I'm so looking forward to reading Uncle Ramsay's new travelogue.
----
;(After talking to Kozue)
:'''Kozue:''' Welcome to the Komore Teahouse! How can I help you?
:{{DIcon}} About Ramsay...
:'''Kozue:''' Oh that businessman... He is indeed in the teahouse. But he's been quite stressed recently. Not sure what happened...
:'''Kozue:''' If you want to find him, just go inside and you'll see him.
----
;(Talk to Heihachi)
:'''Heihachi:''' What are you looking at?
:'''Heihachi:''' Get out of my way!

;(Talk to Ramsay)
:'''Ramsay:''' Are you... a traveler? What can I do for you?
:{{DIcon}} About the travelogue...
:'''Ramsay:''' Oh, you mean the travelogue I wrote for that little girl Midori.
:'''Ramsay:''' I've been too busy to write those lately. She must be getting anxious...
:{{DIcon}} Are those travelogues real?
:'''Ramsay:''' Hahaha, what do you think?
:{{DIcon}} They don't sound real to me...
::'''Ramsay:''' Hahaha, I can see you are well-traveled. You can tell right away.
:{{DIcon}} I hope it's true.
::'''Ramsay:''' Hahaha, I also wish the things I wrote could come true.
:'''Ramsay:''' That's right. Technically, none of the facts in the travelogues are real.
:'''Ramsay:''' Although some places and characters are based on reality... Most of the contents are my own imagination.
:'''Ramsay:''' Of course, some of it is not entirely imaginary. For example, in the travelogue that I'm writing, someone made a super balloon.
:'''Ramsay:''' Then he summoned his friends and planned to travel around Teyvat in this balloon in 80 days.
:'''Ramsay:''' Also, this balloon does not require a [[Vision]] to operate. All it takes is some technical knowledge.
:'''Ramsay:''' These people travel around the world in the balloon, and they encounter various strange things and phenomena along the way...
:'''Ramsay:''' I was going to write this for Midori. But for some reason, I didn't even have time to finish a short paragraph.
:{{DIcon}} Why is that?
:'''Ramsay:''' Do you see that guy in the hallway? He's called Heihachi. He's been staring at me since I don't know when.
:'''Ramsay:''' I was going out to look for inspiration for my travelogue. But that guy has been following me everywhere. I don't know what he's trying to do.
:'''Ramsay:''' I'm worried that this guy has ill intentions towards me. I wouldn't dare to go out. That's why the travelogue has been delayed.
:'''Ramsay:''' Fortunately, now you are here. Traveler, can you accompany me to look for inspiration outside? With you here, I don't think he would dare to do anything to me.
:{{DIcon}} I'll take care of it.
::'''Ramsay:''' Thank you.
:{{DIcon}} Why would he do that?
::'''Ramsay:''' I don't know. But... People don't need a reason to be malicious to someone.
:'''Ramsay:''' As the saying goes, "one must guard against others." Someone's staring at me from behind. I have to guard against him no matter what.
:'''Ramsay:''' So when I'm looking for inspiration, please protect me, traveler.
:'''Ramsay:''' In fact, I already have a few locations in mind. Let's go there right now.
:'''Ramsay:''' The first place is near the beach. Let's go.
----
;(Talk to Ramsay after arriving at the beach)
:'''Ramsay:''' The water at this beach is crystal clear, and the color of the sand is so white, it's completely different from the open seas.
:'''Ramsay:''' It would be a nice place to set sail from... or take off from...
:'''Ramsay:''' Ehm, the scenery here is very nice. Let me write it down in my notes.
:'''Ramsay:''' Traveler, please wait a moment. I need to think about how to write my travelogue. You can walk around and enjoy the scenery.
:'''Ramsay:''' But please don't stray too far away from me. The guy Heihachi is following me. He's just nearby.

;(Talk to Ramsay again)
:'''Ramsay:''' The water at this beach is crystal clear, and the color of the sand is so white, it's completely different from the open seas.
:'''Ramsay:''' This could be a safe place to set sail from...
----
;(Run into Heihachi while walking around the beach)
:'''Heihachi:''' Why are you standing in my way? Are you trying to start something?
:{{DIcon}} Why are you following us?
:'''Heihachi:''' Following you? What? I'm just taking a walk around here! What's wrong with that? Do you own this beach? Who do you think you are...

;(Talk to Heihachi again)
;(Same as above)

;(After returning to Ramsay)
:'''Ramsay:''' Pretty good! The scenery here is really nice...
:'''Ramsay:''' And then... Let me have a look. There is a river bend in the outskirts to the north of town. The small waterfall there is very nice. Let's go there.
----
;(Upon arriving at the area)
:'''Ramsay:''' Why are there monsters around here?
:'''Ramsay:''' Traveler, please kill them!

;(After defeating the hilichurls, talk to Ramsay)
:'''Ramsay:''' Why are there monsters wandering around... Although the scenery is very nice, it really is quite dangerous...
:'''Ramsay:''' But I can include this experience in my travelogue...
:'''Ramsay:''' Let's get out of here and find a safe place.
:'''Ramsay:''' That guy is still following us. He's really... humph... persistent...

;(Talk to Heihachi)
:'''Heihachi:''' What the hell is this place? There are monsters here...
:{{DIcon}} Why are you following us?
:'''Heihachi:''' Me... follow you? Aren't I allowed to come here to enjoy a walk and pick fruit? So paranoid...

;(Upon arriving at the safe spot)
:'''Ramsay:''' The last location is the top of the hill over there.
:'''Ramsay:''' The view there is very good. We should be able to get a panoramic view of the surrounding landscape.
----
;(After coming to the summit of the nearby mountain)
:'''Ramsay:''' Standing on the top of the mountain, you can almost see the entire Narukami Island.
:'''Ramsay:''' The wind at the mountain top is quite strong, and the height is perfect for take-off. There are no obstacles here.
:'''Ramsay:''' And it's a long way from Inazuma City, I won't be disturbed by Doushin... or by unwanted people.
:{{DIcon}} It really is a good location.
:'''Ramsay:''' In conclusion, it's a good location to take off from... And it's a nice place to write about in the travelogue.
:'''Ramsay:''' That guy... he's still following us. He just won't let us go.
:{{DIcon}} I'll get rid of him.
:'''Ramsay:''' It's fine. Don't worry about him. He wouldn't dare do anything rash with you around.
:'''Ramsay:''' When dealing with this kind of person... If you approach him, he would keep pestering you.
:'''Ramsay:''' Anyway, let's call it a day. Let's go back to the Komore Teahouse.
----
;(Talk to Ramsay or Heihachi after returning to the teahouse)
:'''Ramsay:''' I already have some ideas about the main story of my travelogue. But it'll take me a day or two to finish the chapter.
:'''Ramsay:''' I wrote a few paragraphs before. Please take these paragraphs to Midori first.
:'''Ramsay:''' When I am finished with the whole story, I'll ask someone to bring her the completed travelogue.
:'''Heihachi:''' Travelogue... Humph. That's what he says. How would I know if he has any other agendas...
:{{DIcon}} What are you talking about?
:'''Heihachi:''' I said this guy has ulterior motives for writing these travelogues.
:'''Heihachi:''' Who would think about such random nonsense? Traveling around Teyvat in a hot-air balloon without using a Vision...
:'''Heihachi:''' Humph, there must be some sort of agenda behind it... he just hasn't exposed himself yet.

;(Talk to Ramsay or Heihachi again)
:'''Ramsay:''' Please take these paragraphs of travelogue to Midori. When I finish the whole story, I'll ask someone to bring her the completed travelogue.
:'''Heihachi:''' Humph, there must be some sort of agenda behind it... Just that he hasn't exposed himself yet.
----
;(After returning to Midori)
:'''Midori:''' Traveler, did you get the Travelogue?
:{{DIcon}} This is from Mr. Ramsay...
:'''Midori:''' Travel around Teyvat in Eighty Days... WOW! Thank you! Let me have a look...
:'''Midori:''' Oh, how come this is so thin? The other travelogues are much thicker...
:{{DIcon}} He hasn't finished yet.
:'''Midori:''' Is that so? I'll wait and read it when Uncle Ramsay is finished... Then I'll have a new story to tell Kouichi.
:'''Midori:''' Thank you, Traveler. These are for you. Please accept them.
