:'''Bhabha:''' I wonder if my friends from when I was young are doing alright now...
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
:;(Before completing ''Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies'')
::'''Bhabha:''' I'm just an old-timer with too much free time on his hands. Not like before.
::'''Bhabha:''' I once crossed the rainforest and the desert when I was young. I adventured all over Teyvat, saw plenty of things, and made many friends...
::'''Bhabha:''' I didn't have much money then, but what I did have was vigor and courage.
::'''Bhabha:''' Then... Then I happened to dig up some treasure on one of my adventures. Some people said it was a fairy's treasure, while others said it was the legacy of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata...
::'''Bhabha:''' I was just a kid then who didn't know any better, so I sold it to the highest bidder.
::'''Bhabha:''' Thanks to that income, I'm able to clothe and feed myself even in my old age, hehe.
:{{DIcon}} You are...

:{{DIcon}} Your friends from when you were young?
::'''Bhabha:''' I was an energetic and tireless adventure in my youth. I may have gotten myself into my fair share of trouble, but that's also how I made friends.
::'''Bhabha:''' I remember that lad [[Roald]] would lose things all over the place. I once lent him shoes, notebooks, and a mountaineering pickaxe... before he lost them all, that is.
::'''Bhabha:''' And there was that chatterbox... [[Cyrus (Mondstadt)|Cyrus]]? Was that his name? He had a booming voice, like to go on and on and on, but would never listen to what anyone else had to say...
::'''Bhabha:''' I hear he's the branch master of the Mondstadt [[Adventurers' Guild]] now, and that he's got a [[Marjorie|beautiful daughter]].
::'''Bhabha:''' I suppose that means he's grown up a fair bit now, that's good...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Bhabha:''' Safe travels.
