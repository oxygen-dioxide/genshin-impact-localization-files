'''Phantasmal Gates''' are an exploration mechanic in [[Sumeru]].

Phantasmal Gates can be permanently unlocked by playing the [[Vintage Lyre]] next to them. After they are unlocked, passing through the gate will activate a challenge that requires collecting 15 Phantasmal Seeds. The challenge has a time limit of 1 minute 30 seconds, running out of time will teleport the player back to the Phantasmal Gate; collecting a Phantasmal Seed will reset the challenge time, while being hit by an enemy attack will decrease the remaining time by 30 seconds. Leaving the area will fail the challenge.

[[Dream Flower]]s will appear in Phantasmal Gate challenges which can be used to clear enemy aggro or mark the locations of remaining Phantasmal Seeds.
