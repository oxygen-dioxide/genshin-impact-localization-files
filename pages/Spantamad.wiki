==Trivia == 
*The [[Pursina]] who created [[Pursina's Spikes]] is mentioned as having a deep understanding of ley lines, which allowed her to develop such a device. However, it is unclear whether she was a member of Spantamad or not.

===Etymology ===
*Like the other Six Darshans, the name {{Lang|"Spantamad"|zh=悉般多摩}}<ref name="WDSD">{{Ref/Quest|Wherefore Did the Spiritstone Descend?|note=Chinese version}}</ref> is derived from a {{w|Zoroastianism|Zoroastrian}} deity. {{w|Spenta Armaiti}}, also known as Spandarmad in Middle Persian, is a goddess associated with the earth and death. In the Avestan language, "Armaiti" refers to regulative thoughts regarding the physical laws of nature. In the Gathas, the ''Spantamadgah'' is also the name of the third chapter, which focuses on creation.<ref>PDF: [https://etd.ohiolink.edu/apexprod/rws_etd/send_file/send?accession=kent1595845477078896&disposition=inline Beyond the Water: How Pronunciation Affects Melody in the Zorastrian Hymn "The Water's Birthday" in Ahmad-Abad, Iran.]</ref>
