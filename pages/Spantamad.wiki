===Etymology===
*Like the other Six Darshans, the name {{Lang|"Spantamad"|zh=悉般多摩}}<ref name="WDSD">{{Ref/Quest|Wherefore Did the Spiritstone Descend?|note=Chinese version}}</ref> is derived from a {{w|Zoroastianism|Zoroastrian}} deity. {{w|Spenta Armaiti}}, also known as Spandarmad in Middle Persian, is a goddess associated with the earth and death. In the Avestan language, "Armaiti" refers to regulative thoughts regarding the physical laws of nature.
