==Event Description==
During the event, you can log into Genshin Impact daily, claim Commission Rewards, open treasure chests, and complete other challenge missions to obtain Stamina.<br>
Stamina can be used to unlock Cleanup Commission stages during the event. Complete stages to obtain Primogem rewards as well as the event item "Wastewater."<br>
The event item "Wastewater" can be exchanged for Cleanup Reputation. Once your Cleanup Reputation reaches a certain amount, you can obtain Primogems, Mystic Enhancement Ore, Hero's Wit, and other rewards.<br>
* For players on some servers, when Daily Missions begin at 04:00 (Server Time) on the first day, rewards for inviting returning players will also be made available for claiming.

==Cleanup Commissions==
<!-- From the Event Rules inside the web event -->
# Log in to the web event and Genshin Impact daily, and carry out other actions to obtain Stamina.
# Daily missions refresh at 04:00 (Server Time) each day. Unclaimed Stamina will also be cleared by then. Please claim and use the Stamina in time.
# During the event period, Travelers can obtain Stamina by doing things like opening treasure chests while exploring the map, enhancing Artifacts, and defeating powerful opponents a certain number of times.
# The challenge missions will not refresh daily, and you can obtain a maximum of 250 Stamina by completing them. Completed missions will not award Stamina beyond this limit.
# Stamina will not be cleared once you have claimed it.
# You can spend Stamina to unlock different stages. There are a total of 6 Cleanup Commission stages in the event. The first time you complete a stage, you'll obtain the event item "Wastewater" as well as Primogems, Mystic Enhancement Ore, Hero's Wit, and other rewards.
# Before completing all stages, each stage can be replayed without spending Stamina (but no additional rewards will be obtained). After completing all stages, you can replay Stage 6 "A Classic Play" to obtain extra Wastewater.
* If Travelers try to visit the event at around 04:00 (Server Time), which is when the daily missions refresh, they may encounter a brief network error. Please refresh the page if you encounter this error.
