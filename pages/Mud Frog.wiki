|description = A small frog that often appears in wetlands.<br>These animals are very common in wetland areas, and its body secretes a mysterious sticky substance that has much medicinal utility. As opposed to normal frogs, the yellow Mud Frogs are better at camouflaging themselves along wet banks.<br>They say that in [[Fontaine]], people refer to brigands who escape capture often or evildoers who evade judgment as "mud frogs in butter."
