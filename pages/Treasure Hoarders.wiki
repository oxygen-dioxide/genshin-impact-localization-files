{{Description|A ragtag group of bandits whose traces can be found all across the lands, even {{sic|in deepest}} depths of uncharted domains.<br />Although their main purpose is hunting treasure, they are also known to get rough with unfortunate bystanders who happen to be nearby.<br />It's said that the group's founder, [[Reed Miller]], defined the Treasure Hoarders as "an organization of mutual cooperation."|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}
The '''Treasure Hoarders''' are a gang of bandits who search for treasures to obtain and are located all around [[Teyvat]].

==Description==
Treasure Hoarders are a group of bandits that can be found across numerous locations in [[Teyvat]], especially in ruins. Renowned for their Ravenwing motif, all members have their own reason of joining the criminal organization, but it is usually attributed either illegal activities or a lack of stable income. Not all members get along though, as some of them are more looked down upon than others. To protect their identities from law enforcement, most members wear a face mask. The few that don't are usually either of high importance or are used to draw unsuspecting victims into their traps.

According to [[Jilliana]], the Treasure Hoarders tend to burn the money that they acquire very quickly, resulting in a vicious cycle of wealth and poverty that most members cannot escape from.

The Liyue group of Treasure Hoarders fear [[Beidou]] and try to placate her needs to avoid incurring her wrath.

The Inazuman group of Treasure Hoarders occasionally work with [[Nobushi|vag]][[Kairagi|rants]].

The Sumeruan group of Treasure Hoarders occasionally work with the [[Fatui]] and [[The Eremites|Eremites]].

==="Boss"===
During multiple [[World Quests]] in Liyue, including [[Share Not Your Treasures]] and [[Trails in Tianqiu]], the player can find notes left behind by Treasure Hoarders which reference a female Treasure Hoarder they refer to as "Boss." In many cases, this Boss will leave trails leading to supposed treasure to trick the player into falling into an ambush of Treasure Hoarders. This character likely holds a high position among the Treasure Hoarders, perhaps comparable to the position of Freckle Huang. She is also known as "Big Sis" or "Big Sis of the South."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Involuntary Sacrifice}}</ref> It is later revealed that the identity of the "Boss" is [[Yan'er]].

==Trivia==
* As stated above they are the only human enemies that will escape by throwing smokebombs rather than fade away (like [[Fatui Skirmishers]], [[Nobushi]]/[[Kairagi]], and [[Millelith Soldiers|Millelith]] and [[Shogunate Infantry|Shogunate Troops]]) if defeated normally. However, there are some exceptions:
** If ragdolled or drowned, they strangely still disappear in a puff of smoke.
** If defeated while in a [[Frozen]] state or petrified by [[Zhongli]]'s [[Planet Befall]], they will shatter like most other enemies.
** In [[Version 1.4]], they occasionally ragdolled from attacks that do not inflict knockdown (including from bow attacks). This issue was fixed in [[Version 2.0]].
* Before version 2.4 the only Elite Treasure Hoarder faced is Raptor. Carmen and Wallenstein has yet to be given mention or appear, while "Boss" and Liuliu are only mentioned in their respective journal entries (and in the latter's case, both Tyler and the suspicious person utilize a different combat style from the real person himself).
* As seen above the gallery, there is an icon for Treasure Hoarder variants (excluding elites), but (bar the Potioneers) currently, only the basic variants are found in the game as enemies.
* In "[https://youtu.be/3f2-EANyrNM Character Demo - "Childe: A Letter to Snezhnaya"]," a ''Treasure Hoarders: Boss'' can be seen alongside a Scout.
** This variant was never seen anywhere in-game until the [[Fleeting Colors in Flight]] event during [[Version 2.4]].
** However, the ''Treasure Hoarders: Boss'' can be seen in [[CBT2]].
