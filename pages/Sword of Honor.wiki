Clorinde's outfit consists of a white dress shirt, a purple ribbon, like tie with gold and light blue accents that sits on her chest with her {{Ousia}}-aligned {{Electro}} [[Vision]] at the center, and white gloves. She also wears a black underbust corset, which has a light blue inner part and four golden buttons, black, a high-waisted pencil skirt worn over nylon tights, black thigh garters on her legs, and black and white ankle-length heeled boots. She also wears muted blue, water droplet-shaped earrings and a bycocket hat. Over her uniform is a short blue cape with epaulets that hangs off her shoulders. A longer patterned blue cape with gold tassels hangs off her left shoulder and reaches past her knees.
