;(Approach the Choo-Choo Cart Arena before completing ''Zip Along (According to Safe Cart Operating Procedures)'', optional)
:'''Park Announcement Speaker:''' Welcome to the {{Color|Buzzword|Choo-Choo Cart Arena}}. Due to issues with the track, repairs are required... *cough* As such, I shall be away for a time.
:'''Park Announcement Speaker:''' But fret not, I'll be back once the repairs are complete. *cough* Don't forget to return once that happens if you want to experience our thrilling cart races!

;(Approach a park speaker after completing ''Zip Along (According to Safe Cart Operating Procedures)'')
:'''Park Announcement Speaker:''' Your attention please... I have some good news. The tracks repairs have been completed. Of course, the {{Color|Buzzword|Choo-Choo Cart Arena}} has reopened as well.
:'''Park Announcement Speaker:''' If you desire a more thrilling Choo-Choo Cart experience... *cough* please challenge the Choo-Choo Cart Arena at the {{Color|Buzzword|northwestern side of the canyon}}!

;(Approach the Choo-Choo Cart Arena)
:'''Park Announcement Speaker:''' Welcome to the {{Color|Buzzword|Choo-Choo Cart Arena}}. Experience our ever more thrilling... *cough* Choo-Choo Cart tracks!

;(Talk to Haddo)
:'''Haddo:''' It might be more exciting if we had made the rail tilt a little more... It's about the rotation angle in the air... *cough*
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, Haddo!
:'''Haddo:''' It's you... *cough* Enjoying your days in the Veluriyam Mirage?
:{{DIcon}} We've had a lot of fun!
::'''Haddo:''' That's good... *cough* It's good to hear that you're having a good time.
:{{DIcon}} Is your cough getting better?
::'''Haddo:''' *cough* I'm not expecting it to get better. But it's alright, a cough can't stop my passion for designing tracks...
:'''Haddo:''' Oh, speaking of which... *cough* Would you like to try one of these test mini-carts?
:'''Paimon:''' Test? Do carts even need to be tested?
:'''Haddo:''' Yeah. See the site behind me? That's where Choo-Choo Carts are tested. Hehe, do you remember the Torrential Twister?
:'''Haddo:''' This is where that rail line was born... *cough* Even with the Preprint and the Streaming Projector, a properly designed route is essential to the whole process.
:'''Haddo:''' So it's important that we design and test the rails in advance so we can collect feedback for future iterations... Right now it's just... just more or less... what Jeroney calls "overstimulating."
:'''Haddo:''' The test site for small carts has three rails for gradient testing. *cough* Choo-Choo Carts can go a bit faster on these rails...
:'''Haddo:''' They are called... *cough* "Meh, It's Okay Rail," "Kinda Dizzy Now Rail," and "Aaaah! Please Slow Down Rail." Oh, if you're wondering, Ferdinand came up with the names.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, how's [[Ferdinand]] doing?
:'''Haddo:''' He's alright. He just needs some, um, fresh air...
:'''Haddo:''' Anyway, since all three are faster than... *cough* All three tests are faster than the rails outside, so I recommend that you begin with the "Meh, It's Okay Rail."
:'''Haddo:''' Whaddaya say? Brave enough to give it a go?
:{{DIcon}} Let's do this!
::'''Haddo:''' I like your confidence! Go find the [[Hydro Eidolon]] in charge of the three test rails. It'll be happy to activate the test for you.
:{{DIcon}} Nope, I've got other plans...
::'''Haddo:''' No hurry. *cough* The Hydro Eidolon in charge of the three test rails is always there. Feel free to come test whenever you've got time...
