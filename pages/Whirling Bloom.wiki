'''Whirling Bloom''' is [[Kirara]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
Kirara wears a brown cat-ear like accessory decorated with gold and flowers and lined with blue fabric and white fur. Along with this, her hair is styled a number of yellow and brown hairpins, as well as one flower-shaped clip on the right of her hair. She also has a distinct set of two-toned cat tails.

Kirara's outfit consists of a dark colored cropped top made up of two pieces of fabric and decorated in the middle with a large yellow ornament with a jingle bell and two yellow tassels. Over this, she wears a patterned light blue tunic with detached sleeves decorated around the arms with white fur and long dark fingerless gloves that stretch past her elbow. 

Around her waist, Kirara wears a stylized black belt consisting of a long piece of black fabric held together with numerous bows of varying colors with a dangling ornament pinned to it and a small blue cape decorated with flowers. Under all of this, she wears a pleated blue skirt lined with gold and a set of black leg warmers. Her {{Dendro}} [[Vision]] is attached to her belt.
