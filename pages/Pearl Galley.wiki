The '''''Pearl Galley''''' is a luxurious ship located close to [[Liyue Harbor]], which is for the exclusive enjoyment of its specially-invited guests. Its proprier is [[Rouran]].

The advertisement on the [[Feiyun Slope Bulletin Board]] and the [[#Connoisseur Catalog|Connoisseur Catalog]] on the ship indicate that the ''Pearl Galley'' is actually a floating {{w|gentleman's club}}, and also functions as a brothel and casino. While such industries are technically not allowed in Liyue itself, the [[Liyue Qixing]] turn a blind eye to the ''Pearl Galley'' which floats offshore.

Reaching the ''Pearl Galley'' for the first time triggers the World Quest ''[[The Ocean Pearl]]'', the completion of which will allow the player to return to the ship by talking with [[Pinghai]]. It is also visited during {{Quest|Shadow of Yore}}.

===Etymology===
* In the Connoisseur Catalog, {{Lang|"The beauty of water is in the pearls it holds"|zh=「川怀珠而媚」}} is based on a famous sentence from the influential Chinese work ''{{w|Wen fu}}'': {{zh|石韞玉而山輝，水懷珠而川媚。|tl=Let it [a thought], then, be contained like jade in rocks, that a mountain loom in radiance, / Or cast it like a pearl in water that a whole river gleam with splendour.}}<ref>Archive.org: Lu Ji, Chen Shixiang.
