;(After completing ''[[Asipattravana Itihasa]]'')
:'''Mihir:''' The sights and scenes of the Vourukasha Oasis are as they always were. They comfort you humans as well, yes?
:{{DIcon}} About Pari responsibilities...
::'''Mihir:''' These should come naturally to us Pari, and should not trouble us.
:{{DIcon}} About Sorush...
::'''Mihir:''' Sorush is also doing her utmost to fulfill her duties as a Pari.
::'''Mihir:''' Although her methods... could use some refinement, she is very dedicated to her duties. I am sure you understand what I mean.
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you in peace for now.
::'''Mihir:''' Very well. I shall stay here for a spell.

;After completing ''[[The Hymn of Tir Yazad (Part 2)]]''
:'''Mihir:''' Peace has been restored for now... Friendly human, why are you still here?
:{{DIcon}} There are still some other things I'd like to do...
::'''Mihir:''' If such is the case, I understand.
::'''Mihir:''' I also have many tasks awaiting me... I will complete them after I finish resting.
::{{DIcon}} About Sorush...
:::'''Mihir:''' In terms familiar to a human, Sorush has matured from her recent experiences.
:::'''Mihir:''' The Pari are indifferent to the maturation process, but I didn't realize that Sorush had already...
:::'''Mihir:''' Hm. It's been a good thing for her. That should mean enough.
::{{DIcon}} About the Sign of Apaosha...
:::'''Mihir:''' Considering a lot of what happened was pretty unexpected... Well, unexpected for Sorush, anyhow.
:::'''Mihir:''' With the sign extinguished, I assume Sorush has also learned much from the Chaplet.
:::'''Mihir:''' The greater struggle itself, however, is not over. As Pari, our duty remains even with the quelling of the sign.
:{{DIcon}} Nothing. I'll be going now.
::'''Mihir:''' Farewell, friendly human.
