==Trivia==
* This is the first event wish to have multiple characters of the same [[Element]] be featured, being [[Hu Tao]] and [[Xiangling]], who are both {{Pyro}} characters.
* This is the first event wish to not be announced during the [[Special Program]]. It is speculated that having Hu Tao, a character who's theme is the passing of people, would not be appropriate to take place during [[Lantern Rite]], which is based on Chinese New Year. Thus [[Version 1.3]] had 3 Character Event Wishes of length 2 weeks instead of the normal 2 wishes for 3 weeks each.
