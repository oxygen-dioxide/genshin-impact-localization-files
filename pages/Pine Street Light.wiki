|description    = A street light made of Pine Wood. Often seen standing on both sides of the road in the countryside around [[Mondstadt]], where they have stood for a long time. Street lights also used to be a common sight in the wild and the mountains, but they were destroyed when monster activity in these areas increased.<br />Thanks to the efforts of the [[Knights of Favonius]], the monster threat has been quelled for the time being, and new street lights have been placed along the roads.
