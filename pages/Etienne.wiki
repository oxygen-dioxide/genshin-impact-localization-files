:'''Etienne:''' Good girl, [[Baguette]], good girl... Phew.
:{{DIcon}} What are you busy with?
::'''Etienne:''' ...Oh, sorry. I'm just... really tired right now. Didn't notice you there.
::'''Etienne:''' Very few people talk to me at work, in any case, since cargo inspection doesn't really involve the crew.
::'''Etienne:''' And as you can see, that's what I'm doing.
::'''Etienne:''' Though in practice, the one inspecting things is my dog, Baguette. I'm just here to take care of her in turn.
:{{DIcon}} Mind telling me about your dog?
::'''Etienne:''' Ah. Baguette is an earnest girl who's dedicated to her work. I'm most fond of her.
::'''Etienne:''' She's got a truly keen sense of smell, and she can sniff out all manner of contraband and prohibited items.
::'''Etienne:''' No human inspector can beat her in that regard, but...
::'''Etienne:''' Baguette is tireless at work, and just as tireless when it comes to tearing the house down.
::'''Etienne:''' *sigh* If only she could be this at peace at home.
;(Available after Step 9 of ''[[Soloist's Prologue]]'')
:{{DIcon}} Could you tell me about the "prophecy"?
::'''Etienne:''' Ah, yes, thanks for sending me the Magic Pocket earlier.
::'''Etienne:''' Whether the prophecy is true or not, the pocket remains a very convenient storage tool.
::'''Etienne:''' I should probably stuff all the valuables at home into it. Even if I don't have to move, I can avoid their damage at Baguette's hands.
;(Available after completing ''[[The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur]]'')
:{{DIcon}} About the prophecy...
::'''Etienne:''' Please, allow me to thank you again for the Magic Pocket you gave me earlier! It's extremely convenient for storage.
::'''Etienne:''' Luckily, I'd already stuffed all my home's most valuable things in there. When the waters rose, everyone was so busy with rescue efforts that there wasn't time for anything else.
::'''Etienne:''' But I still haven't taken out the stuff I put in, hehe... After all, Baguette can't break what's inside.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Etienne:''' *sigh* See you.
