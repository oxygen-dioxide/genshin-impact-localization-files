;(Talk to Chalmet)
:'''Chalmet:''' That should do it... I hope these materials will actually be useful.
:{{DIcon}} Are you still organizing files?
:'''Chalmet:''' Oho! Pleasure to see you, Honorary Senior Researcher.
:'''Chalmet:''' That's correct! I am continuing to organize the documents and files according to Mr. Raimondo's instructions... Wait, haven't I said this before?
:'''Paimon:''' But this place is huge! It's way too much work for one person. Why didn't he assign anyone to help you?
:'''Chalmet:''' The Research Institute has many pressing matters to deal with. It's normal that there's no one available to help me.
:{{DIcon}} And you're a Director too...
:'''Chalmet:''' You mean my title as Fontaine Research Institute Materials Retrieval Project Director? *sigh* Please don't mock me so...
:'''Chalmet:''' In what way am I actually a Director? From the very beginning, I have been no more than an ordinary staffer responsible for organizing files.
:'''Chalmet:''' After Mr. Raimondo assigned me here to organize the files, I was suddenly informed of my new title.
:'''Chalmet:''' Someone said this was Mr. Choiseul's idea. Apparently he thinks that since our work is so onerous, giving us such titles will make providing additional compensation easier...
:'''Chalmet:''' Ah! Don't tell anyone else, how could I... how could I just say it out loud like that...
:{{DIcon}} I'm the silent type, relax.
:'''Paimon:''' That sounds not bad at all! And after all, it's only fair that those who do all the work should receive a bit more compensation.
:'''Paimon:''' But why use such a roundabout method? Can't they just give everyone more Mora?
:{{DIcon}} This seems par for the course here at the Research Institute.
:{{DIcon}} As long as you actually receive the extra Mora.
:'''Chalmet:''' *sigh* I can never understand just what the two of them are thinking...
:'''Chalmet:''' But I have to keep working, no matter what! There's too much to do.
:'''Chalmet:''' Honorary Senior Researcher, if you are willing, could you please give me a hand?
:{{DIcon}} It is my duty.
:{{DIcon}} Don't forget to make the "honorary" in my title even more honorable!
::'''Chalmet:''' Hahaha, not a problem! I will testify to your kindness and contributions.
:'''Chalmet:''' In that case, please help me clear out some of the filth around here.
:'''Chalmet:''' Be sure to do your best {{color|buzzword|not to touch the nearby books and files}} while you're cleaning. It would be absolutely awful if they were damaged by the cleaning...
:'''Chalmet:''' I'll leave that to you then! As for me, I'll keep organizing the files here. *sigh* I never noticed there were so many files in the Institute before...

;(Talk to Chalmet again)
:'''Chalmet:''' *sigh* I never noticed there were so many files in the Institute before...

;(After getting the files wet with Hydro abilities)
:'''Chalmet:''' Hey, careful there! Some of the files almost got wet, you know!

;(After blowing the files away with Anemo abilities)
:'''Chalmet:''' W—Whoa, what a huge gust of wind! Wow! The files are gonna get blown away!

;(Talk to Chalmet after cleaning the filth)
:'''Chalmet:''' Phew... Thanks for your help. Were it not for you, who knows how long it would have taken me...
;(If player damaged the books or files)
::'''Chalmet:''' Though, if you had been a bit gentler with the cleaning, that would have been even better...
::{{DIcon}} Sorry about that...
::{{DIcon}} I'll go a bit easier next time...
::'''Chalmet:''' Don't misunderstand! I'm not blaming you, you really did do me a huge favor.
::'''Chalmet:''' These are for you. Thank you for your help, Honorary Senior Researcher.
;(If player did not damage the books or files)
::'''Chalmet:''' No wonder you're the Honorary Senior Researcher. No matter what you do, you do it well.
::{{DIcon}} I've always been a bit out of the ordinary.
::{{DIcon}} I've got some experience in the cleaning department.
:::'''Chalmet:''' Huh? Then you truly are multitalented, and eminently worthy of your title!
::'''Chalmet:''' I must thank you again for your help, Honorary Senior Researcher. Please, take these.
