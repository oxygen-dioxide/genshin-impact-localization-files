==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* In the Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish versions, {{Lang|''{{w|Pratyekabuddhayāna|Pratyekabuddha}}''|sa=प्रत्येकबुद्ध|zh=缘觉}}, literally "isolated Buddha," is one of three types of enlightened beings according to some schools of Buddhism. Pratyekabuddhas are said to achieve enlightenment on their own or through an event, without the use of teachers or guides, but also do not lead others to enlightenment.<ref>Wisdom Library, [https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/pratyekabuddha Pratyekabuddha]</ref>
