|description    = "Weapons are bound to take damage in battle. Thus, the store of a force's consumables and weaponry are a measure of their ability to wage war."<br />It is said that these were the words of the very first Quartermaster of the [[Corps of Thirty]]. It has been a long time, though, so the veracity of this attribution can no longer be determined. Of course, all military forces, whether they be the Corps of Thirty or other mercenary bands, place great importance on the maintenance and resupply of weapons.<br />This weapon rack is a product of the evolution of traditional design. Sturdy yet light and reinforced by metal components in key places, it is easy to construct and transport. When operated at maximum capacity, it can supply weapons to a whole combat supply squad for half a month.<br />However, it is said that [[Dehya|a certain mercenary]] with long black-and-golden hair once used up all the weapons to be found on one such rack while sparring against other warriors &mdash; following which they suggested that she get a custom-made weapon instead of using mass-produced ones.
