'''Geo Lamps''' are objects found in [[Liyue]]. Bringing a [[Geogranum]] to a Geo Lamp will activate it. Some Lamps are permanently activated upon bringing a Geogranum to it, while others are only temporarily activated until all Geo Lamps in the area are activated.

Geo Lamps are typically used in open world puzzles and lighting all the Geo Lamps in an area can result in one of many possible effects, such as spawning [[chests]], lowering water levels, or opening doors.
