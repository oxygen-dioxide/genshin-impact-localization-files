{{Description|A sharp-eyed and proud falcon.<br />A fragile creature, yet one that defiantly braves the boundless snowscape. Its frost-covered feathers glisten like glaciers. An ancient legend holds that the people of a [[Sal Vindagnyr|long-lost mountain civilization]] turned into snow-white falcons to watch over their once lush and verdant homeland. Due to the lack of natural predators or hunters in the land now entombed by snow, these old souls live a life of relative comfort.|in-game description from the [[Archive]]}}
