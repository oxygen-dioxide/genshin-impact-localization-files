|text      = For my birthday this year, our long-time fans booked a ship for the entire Yun-Han Opera Troupe on which to admire the full moon. As this was the request of our adoring supporters, we of course decided to go.

I discussed matters with everyone and, seeing how devoted our fans are, we agreed that it was best to repay them in at least some small part with a performance.

Upon the sea and beneath the moon, accompanied by the sound of the waves... I think this song is best suited to the scene:

"The frosty disk of the full moon rises upon a lonely island, life fleeting as a pleasant dream, let me raise my cup with open heart and drink to my soul's satisfaction."

To spend my birthday creating beautiful memories with friends and those who love and appreciate opera fills me with joy.

I hope that you might be a part of those memories, but as I am unsure if you have a free moment, I am writing you this letter of invitation.

Should you wish to join me in scene and song beneath the moon, then do come along!
