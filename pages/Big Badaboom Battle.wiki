{{Quest Description|Paimon is very curious about Albedo...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Upon arriving in the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]])
:'''Paimon:''' Speaking of which, what is Albedo doing right now?
:'''Paimon:''' He played with [[Klee]] for a while before saying that he wanted to go have a look around.
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe he's gone off to sketch something again?
:'''Paimon:''' Let's look for him!

;(Upon arriving at the location)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, why's there a canvas here?

;(After observing the painting)
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like this was left by Albedo... whoa, this looks like one fierce fella.
:'''Paimon:''' Is this Albedo's latest work? If you look closely, it does look similar to the gift that [[Alice]] left for Klee.
:'''Paimon:''' Aaah! It appeared!
:'''Paimon:''' C'mon, Traveler, find some way to take care of it!
