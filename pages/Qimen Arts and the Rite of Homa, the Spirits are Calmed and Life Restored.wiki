{{Quest Description|update|Today's the day Ningguang said to meet up again. It's time to head to Yujing Terrace...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Ningguang at Yujing Terrace)
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, everyone's here already...
:'''Hu Tao:''' Hey, Paimon. Did you have a good rest?
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, yup! Pretty good, thanks!
:{{DIcon}} How's the situation looking?
:'''Ningguang:''' Since we last met, we've seen an uptick in patient numbers in [[Liyue Harbor]].
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 2 lanyan 01.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Also, my cousin wrote back to me. She mentioned that people have started to get sick in [[Yilong Wharf]] as well.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no, it's spread to Yilong Wharf now?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Mm, but as long as we solve the core problem, the fetor in people's bodies will dissipate, and they'll make a speedy recovery.
:'''Hu Tao:''' And the good news is that thanks to the Tianquan's efforts, we now have the locations of all eight gates.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Woohoo! So what's the plan?
:'''Ningguang:''' Tonight, we will deploy the array, and set up a Homa Altar at each of the gates. This will enable the funeral parlor's secret art to incinerate the fetor.
:'''Ningguang:''' Since the gates are interconnected via the [[Ley Line]]s, the secret art will be amplified to all of Liyue. Not a single wisp of fetor will escape its grasp.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Mm-hmm! It's gonna be the biggest purification ceremony in the funeral parlor's history.
:{{DIcon}} Okay, so what are the locations of the eight gates?
:'''Ningguang:''' You needn't worry &mdash; they're all accounted for. Actually, we already knew the locations of the first four two days ago.
:'''Ningguang:''' [[Keqing]] has already set out for the Gate of Life in Yilong Wharf, and [[Ganyu]] is en route to the Gate of Concealment at [[Mt. Aocang]]. [[Beidou]] is covering the Gate of Fright at [[Guyun Stone Forest]], and [[Yelan]] will tackle the Gate of Injury at [[The Chasm]].
:'''Ningguang:''' As of last night, we confirmed the locations of the remaining four gates. The fifth is the Gate of Terrain at [[Dihua Marsh]], which the [[Conqueror of Demons]] has pledged to defend.
:'''Ningguang:''' The sixth is the Gate of Repose in [[Qingce Village]]. This one has been claimed by the [[Bubu Pharmacy]] duo.
:'''Ningguang:''' The seventh is the Gate of Initiation, located here in Liyue Harbor. [[Lan Yan]] and I will see to this one.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What about the final gate?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Last but not least is the Gate of Death at [[Wuwang Hill]]. Which, let's be honest, has Director Hu written all over it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Wait, so you've assigned all of the gates already!?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Sorry! You got here too late.
:{{DIcon}} Let me take the Gate of Death.
::'''Hu Tao:''' You trying to steal my job now? Nuh-uh, hands off!
::{{A|vo eqhdj403 2 paimon 07a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But the Gate of Death sounds so dangerous... And you only just got back from the border...
::'''Hu Tao:''' You're right that it's the most dangerous gate. Which is exactly why it needs an expert on life and death like me!
:{{DIcon}} Alright, lemme guess: There's a secret ninth gate for me?
::{{A|vo eqhdj403 2 paimon 07b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah! People are always saying eight gates when they mean nine &mdash; it happens all the time, right?
::'''Hu Tao:''' Nope, not in my experience.
:'''Hu Tao:''' If you have to take a gate, go steal the Tianquan's instead, hehe.
:'''Ningguang:''' {{Traveler}}, I appreciate your eagerness to help, and as it happens, Miss Lan Yan and I do have a matter we'd like to discuss with you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 2 lanyan 02.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' That's right. But let's discuss it once Director Hu's done with you.
:{{DIcon}} Wait... so Director Hu DOES need me for something?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Hehe, sorry, I went ahead and told them I'd be stealing you for a little while.
:'''Hu Tao:''' I haven't had much time to enjoy myself this Lantern Rite. And come this evening, I have to leave the city again, which means I'll miss out on all the lanterns.
:'''Hu Tao:''' So I want to use the little down time I have to go hand out some fortune coins to my friends. Then I can at least say I did Lantern Rite this year. Fancy joining me for that?
:{{DIcon}} Absolutely.
:'''Ningguang:''' Hehe, this is the one thing Director Hu's had to look forward to. Otherwise, she'd have set out for Wuwang Hill by now.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so you were waiting for us all this time?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Hehe, it's okay. Since time was tight, I already asked the Tianquan to pass along my fortune coins to all the people handling the gates.
:'''Hu Tao:''' I'm grateful for their help &mdash; it should {{sic|have been be}} the funeral parlor's responsibility, after all.
:'''Ningguang:''' Think nothing of it, Director Hu.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Anyway, I have a few friends left to visit in Liyue Harbor. Let's do the rounds, shall we?

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Hu Tao:''' We should head to Bubu Pharmacy first, or I won't catch them before they head out for Qingce Village.

;(Talk to Ningguang, optional)
:'''Ningguang:''' Don't forget to come back here after Director Hu is done with you. There's a favor I would like to ask of you.
:{{DIcon}} About the people assigned to the eight gates...
:'''Ningguang:''' Heh, you want to drop by and say hello to them? Well, you'd better hurry if you want to make it back in time.
:'''Ningguang:''' The Gate of Life is at Yilong Wharf, and the Gate of Concealment at Mt. Aocang. They are being seen to by Keqing and Ganyu respectively.
:'''Ningguang:''' The Gate of Fright can be found at Guyun Stone Forest, and the Gate of Injury is at The Chasm. Those are assigned to Beidou and Yelan.
:'''Ningguang:''' As for the Gate of Terrain at Dihua Marsh, that's been taken by the Conqueror of Demons. These five are all on location already.

;(Talk to Lan Yan, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj403 lanyan 01.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' See you shortly, {{Traveler}}. We'll be waiting!
:{{DIcon}} About the eight gates...
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj403 lanyan 02.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Oh? You want to learn more about the gates? Well, as you heard earlier, the gates are basically eight key nodes in Liyue's Ley Line network.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj403 lanyan 03.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' You must be wondering why the [[Ministry of Civil Affairs]] had to do so much work to find out the locations of the gates?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj403 lanyan 04.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Well, the Qimen arts teach that the state of the Ley Lines is intricately linked to human activity. Each can affect the other.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj403 lanyan 05.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' In other words, the gates' locations are subject to change over time.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj403 lanyan 06.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' For instance, before our ancestors moved to [[Chenyu Vale]], they lived near the Chasm. My grandpa says that back then, the gate there was the Gate of Life &mdash; yet all these years on, it's become the Gate of Injury.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj403 lanyan 07.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' So we had to map out the gates all over again to make sure we're deploying the array properly.

;(Talk to Keqing at the [[Yilong Dais]], optional)
:'''Keqing:''' Oh, {{Traveler}}, Paimon... What brings you here?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj403 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We heard you were taking part in this Seven-and-Eight-Gates Method, so we came to see how you were doing.
:'''Keqing:''' I see. So Ningguang's explained the situation to you already.
:{{DIcon}} About the Gate of Life...
:'''Keqing:''' The Gate of Life symbolizes growth, prosperity, and revitalization. It is the most auspicious of all eight gates. As you can see, this gate is currently situated at Yilong Wharf.
:'''Keqing:''' Later tonight, I will use the power of this gate and Director Hu's rattan figure to take on some of the fetor blast for her. With each gate helping to share the load... Yes, I'm sure we'll make it through this crisis.

;(Talk to Ganyu on Mt. Aocang, optional)
:'''Ganyu:''' Hey there you two... I wasn't expecting your company here at Mt. Aocang.
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj403 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We heard you were taking part in this Seven-and-Eight-Gates Method, so we came to see how you were doing.
:{{DIcon}} About the Gate of Concealment...
:'''Ganyu:''' Don't worry. This Gate is a place of refuge, peace, and good fortune. It's the perfect place for Master and the other adepti to live in seclusion. I believe they're currently discussing something in Master's abode.
:'''Ganyu:''' Once this crisis is over, you'd be more than welcome to come and stay here for a little while. It'd be good for your health.

;(Talk to Beidou near the [[Teleport Waypoint]] in Guyun Stone Forest, optional)
:'''Beidou:''' Hey! How'd you end up stranded out here? Ningguang didn't actually rope you into this too, did she?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj403 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We heard you were taking part in this Seven-and-Eight-Gates Method, so we came to see how it's going.
:{{DIcon}} About the Gate of Fright...
:'''Beidou:''' Ah, so you already know what's what.
:'''Beidou:''' Since ancient times, the Gate of Fright has been known as a gate of great misfortune. It usually shows up in places filled with fear and desolation.
:'''Beidou:''' I guess this place checks all the boxes, with all the demons [[Rex Lapis]] suppressed here.
:'''Beidou:''' But the [[Crux Fleet]] is right at home in places like this, hahaha.
:'''Beidou:''' If I didn't have to work tonight, I'd have loved to take you on a walk around the area.

;(Talk to Yelan near the eastern Teleport Waypoint in the Chasm, optional)
:'''Yelan:''' Oh? Fancy seeing you here. Don't you have business with Director Hu to attend to?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj403 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, you really gather intel like it's going out of fashion... But anyway &mdash; we heard you were taking part in this Seven-and-Eight-Gates Method, so we came to check-in.
:{{DIcon}} About the Gate of Injury...
:'''Yelan:''' It's piqued your curiosity, huh? Well, this is one of the least fun gates there is. The Gate of Injury symbolizes wounds and loss. It's one of the three gates of great misfortune, along with the Gates of Death and Fright.
:'''Yelan:''' A long, long time ago, this was actually the home of the present-day people of Chenyu Vale.
:'''Yelan:''' But as you know, there was a huge disaster here. My ancestors fought alongside the [[Yaksha]]s, and gave their lives to save Liyue from peril.
:'''Yelan:''' That's why it has to be me here, guarding this gate. Unless you've got other burning questions, I must ask you to leave at once.
:'''Yelan:''' I'm sure you still remember the time [[Perilous Trail|we explored the depths of this place together]]... And I trust you haven't forgotten just how dangerous it was?

;(Talk to Xiao in front of [[Wangshu Inn]], optional)
:'''Xiao:''' Hmm? {{Traveler}}, Paimon. How are you feeling after your trip to the border?
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj403 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're feeling great, thanks! We just heard you were taking part in this Seven-and-Eight-Gates Method, so we came to see if there were any issues.
:{{DIcon}} About the Gate of Terrain...
:'''Xiao:''' No need to worry. Though the Gate of Terrain symbolizes fire and volatility, it also stands for light, growth, and prosperity. For that reason, it is seen as a somewhat auspicious gate.
:'''Xiao:''' The greatest challenge of tonight will be found not here, but at Hu Tao's Gate of Death.
:'''Xiao:''' I will do my utmost to alleviate her burden.
----
;(Approach Bubu Pharmacy)
:'''Qiqi:''' Hu Tao, {{Traveler}}, and Paimon...
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 10 baizhu 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Oh? I didn't expect to see you here at this hour.
:'''Changsheng:''' We are just about to set out for Qingce Village!
:'''Hu Tao:''' Hehe, guess we caught you just in time, then. We're here to deliver some fortune coins!
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 10 baizhu 02.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Hm, you're in unusually good spirits, Director Hu... Even pesky [[Baizhu]] gets a fortune coin today?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Of course, of course! There's enough for everyone. Here, this one's for you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 10 baizhu 03.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' It's the sun symbol...
:'''Hu Tao:''' You're absolutely right, Dr. Baizhu &mdash; in terms of your peskiness, I mean.
:'''Hu Tao:''' So I'm afraid I won't be wishing you success in your medical and immortality-seeking endeavors. That would just make things unnecessarily difficult for me.
:'''Hu Tao:''' The sun symbol symbolizes peace and harmony in the world. My wish is that all shall be cured of their ailments before arriving at your door, so you'll be spared the sight of pain and suffering.
:'''Changsheng:''' Haha, I see. Director Hu's hoping that you go out of business, Baizhu.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Hehe, [[Changsheng]], this one's for you.
:'''Changsheng:''' Let me see, let me see... Ooh, a cross symbol!
:'''Hu Tao:''' Mm-hmm! The cross symbol represents growth, prosperity, and balance between heaven and earth. May you soon regain all the power and memories you possessed in your prime!
:'''Changsheng:''' That's very thoughtful of you, Director Hu. I assume you also brought one for [[Qiqi]]?
:'''Qiqi:''' F&mdash;For me?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Yup! This peace symbol coin is for you, Qiqi. It symbolizes safe passage. In other words &mdash; stay away from dangerous place the next time you go herb-gathering.
:'''Hu Tao:''' If anything were to happen to you, poor Mr. Baizhu would be in a real pickle &mdash; because he'd have no one to study the secrets of immortality from.
:'''Hu Tao:''' And I'd be affected too, of course. I can't bury you if I don't know where you are.
:'''Qiqi:''' Uh, got it...
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw, it's nice to see that Qiqi's recovering well from all that fetor at the border.
:'''Qiqi:''' I am a [[zombie]]. Zombies can't get sick.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 10 baizhu 04.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' In fact, Qiqi insisted on joining me at the gate tonight. She's determined to help eradicate the fetor.
:'''Qiqi:''' Bad fetor. I don't like it.
:'''Qiqi:''' It can make people sick, and then Baizhu has to heal them. It can also make people die. And then they have to get buried by Hu Tao.
:'''Qiqi:''' Too much trouble...
:'''Hu Tao:''' Don't worry, Qiqi. Tonight, we'll solve the problem once and for all.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Alright, everyone, we won't overstay our welcome.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 10 baizhu 05.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' One moment, Director Hu.
:'''Hu Tao:''' What's wrong? ...Huh? Wait, what are you doing?
:;(Baizhu raises one hand, closes his eyes and concentrating, transfers life force to Hu Tao.)
:'''Changsheng:''' Aha, so the secret art works even when there's no illness present... Seems like a sizeable step forward for Baizhu's research.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 10 baizhu 06.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Tonight, you will stand guard over the Gate of Death &mdash; the most ominous gate of them all. It may not help much, but I transferred a little extra life force to you. May it help you stay alert and focused during the proceedings.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Hopefully not at a detriment to your own health, though?
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 10 baizhu 07.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' You needn't worry about that. As your archenemy, why would I undermine myself to help my opponent?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Hahaha, alright, well said. Okay &mdash; this time I really am leaving. Bye, everyone.
:'''Qiqi:''' Good luck, Hu Tao...

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Where to next?
:'''Hu Tao:''' To pay a visit to [[Yun Jin]]!

;(Talk to Baizhu or Qiqi, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog eqhdj403 baizhu 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' We are grateful for Director Hu's well wishes. Don't worry about us &mdash; focus on your own duties.
:'''Qiqi:''' Good luck, Hu Tao...

;(Approach Yun Jin)
:'''Hu Tao:''' Oh, Yun Jin! Aka, Ms. Yun! Also aka Director Yun!
:'''Yun Jin:''' Huh? Hu Tao? What brings you here? Oh, and {{Traveler}} and Paimon, too...
:'''Yun Jin:''' Is this about the other day? I swear, I didn't say anything bad about you! They were just trying to find out where you'd gone!
:'''Hu Tao:''' Haha, no it's not about that! I'm just here to say hi to my friend... assuming that's alright with you?
:'''Yun Jin:''' Oh. Uh, yeah, of course!
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 12 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Also, she brought some fortune coins for you!
:'''Hu Tao:''' Yep yep! Hehe, take a look!
:'''Yun Jin:''' What are these?
:'''Hu Tao:''' They're fortune coins engraved with the yardstick symbol. One for you, and one for [[Xinyan]].
:'''Hu Tao:''' You're the top performing artists in all of Liyue Harbor, and I wish you success beyond measure!
:'''Hu Tao:''' Could you pass Xinyan's coin to her for me? I haven't been able to find her all day, but I know she won't miss your show tonight.
:'''Yun Jin:''' Thanks, Hu Tao. I really appreciate the coin! But... how come you can't just give it to her yourself this evening?
:'''Hu Tao:''' I'd love to, but unfortunately I won't make it to the lantern display tonight. That's the whole reason I'm here now.
:'''Yun Jin:''' Oh... how come? You have something else on?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Just a little thing I have to do for work.
:'''Yun Jin:''' Ah, right... I heard the Ministry of Civil Affairs announced that they'll be reviving an ancient ceremony tonight &mdash; something about lighting a flame to dispel the smog.
:'''Yun Jin:''' Your little work thing wouldn't have anything to do with that, would it?
:'''Hu Tao:''' You're a sharp one, Yun Jin. Yes, that's exactly it.
:'''Yun Jin:''' Is it... dangerous?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Technically, but only a teeny tiny little bit. {{Traveler}} will back me up on that.
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, Hu Tao's right.
:'''Yun Jin:''' ...Are you sure?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Ah, come on Yun Jin. I get that you won't take my word for it, but if you can't trust {{Traveler}}, whom can you trust?
:'''Yun Jin:''' I didn't mean it like that... Anyway, since you can't make it tonight, how about I sing "The Sanctification of [[Tao Dou]]" for you right now? Does that sound good?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Hehe, that's so nice of you! But since you're offering... I'd rather hear a certain other tune instead. You know the one, right?
:'''Yun Jin:''' Uh... which one? Sorry, I'm a little lost...
:'''Hu Tao:''' You know! You've sung it to me before!
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 12 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What are you talking about? Is this supposed to be a riddle?
:'''Hu Tao:''' The opera version of the Hilitune! We made a bet, and agreed that whoever lost had to sing lyrics chosen by the winner in their own style. The result was Yun Jin's spectacular operatic version of the Hilitune. You guys seriously need to hear it.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Aw, Yun Jin... Don't tell me you're embarrassed to sing it now that {{Traveler}} is here...?
:'''Yun Jin:''' What are you talking about? Of course not...
:'''Hu Tao:''' Pretty please, Yun Jin? Just once, for me? I really want to hear it again.
:'''Yun Jin:''' Alright, alright, I'll sing it for you after the show tonight. How about that?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Noooooo, I want to hear it now!
:'''Yun Jin:''' Why?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Oh, don't play dumb, you know why! Hu Tao's a sassy little brat who always gets whatever she wants! Mostly because she's sooo adorable that no one has the heart to turn her down! La-la-la-la-la, life is grand~
:'''Yun Jin:''' *sigh* You are unbelievable... Alright. I'll sing, but please &mdash; do not laugh at me.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 12 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yay! Operatic Hilitune, let's go!
:'''Yun Jin:''' ♪ Silly-churl, billy-churl, silly-billy Hilichurl... ♪
:'''Hu Tao:''' Bravo, bravissimo! Well, what do you think &mdash; glad I dragged you out now?
:{{DIcon}} It was a truly unique performance.
:'''Yun Jin:''' I must look ridiculous...
:'''Hu Tao:''' Hee-hee, thanks for indulging me, Yun Jin. You're a star! We should head off now, as I still have one person to give a fortune coin to.
:'''Yun Jin:''' No, wait... Hu Tao, be honest. You guys aren't hiding anything from me, are you?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Of course not! Put that thought right out of your head.
:'''Yun Jin:''' Alright. Then whenever you're done with your work &mdash; whether it's tomorrow, the day after, or whenever &mdash; come find me again, and I'll sing "The Sanctification of Tao Dou" for you.
:'''Hu Tao:''' ...Hmm?
:'''Yun Jin:''' Let me rephrase. Hu Tao, {{Traveler}} &mdash; promise me you'll come and see me perform some day soon, okay?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Sure! You got it!

;(After the cutscene)
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 13 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Where should we go next?
:'''Hu Tao:''' I'll bet {{Traveler}}'s guessed it already. Hehe, to [[Wanmin Restaurant]] we go.

;(Talk to Yun Jin, optional)
:'''Yun Jin:''' Good luck. I'll be waiting for you.

;(Approach [[Xiangling]] at Wanmin Restaurant)
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! You got a [[New Year's Cheer|new outfit]] too? You look amazing, Xiangling!
:'''Hu Tao:''' Ooh, you think? Hmm, then what does that say about my taste? Hint, hint?
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 14 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Yeah, yeah, Director Hu has the most exquisite taste in the world, et cetera.
:{{DIcon}} I see, so it's a gift from Hu Tao.
:'''Hu Tao:''' A thank-you gift, technically. I sought out that [[Fontaine]] [[Chiori|fashion designer]] and gave her a brief description of Xiangling.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 14 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Her work is incredible! Especially this [[Guoba]] hat. It's just as cute as the real Guoba!
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 14 gooba 01.ogg}} '''Guoba:''' ♪~
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 14 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's great seeing both of you together dressed in your new outfits. You almost look like sisters!
:'''Hu Tao:''' Hehe, that's a given!
:'''Hu Tao:''' Oh, also &mdash; Xiangling, I got you a little something else too. It's a fortune coin.
:'''Hu Tao:''' This career fortune coin is for you! May you go from strength to strength, and may the Wanmin Restaurant get so many customers that it needs to be rebuilt ten times bigger!
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 14 xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I dunno, Hu Tao, you're kind of asking a lot of me there...
:'''Hu Tao:''' Wait, I'm not done! I've got two more coins &mdash; a "family fortune" one for [[Xingqiu]], and a "spirit and vigor" one for [[Chongyun]]. I believe they've already left for Chenyu Vale, so could you pass them on when they get back?
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 14 xiangling 04.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Uh... Why get me involved? Can't you just give these to them yourself?

:{{A|vo eqhdj403 16 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What does this symbol mean?

:'''Hu Tao:''' Because I'll be working tonight! Hehe, I've always been very serious when it comes to work.
:{{DIcon}} ...Is this my gift?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Look again! Do you see anything about me that's different from before?
:{{DIcon}} ...You changed clothes?
::'''Hu Tao:''' Heh... I mean, yes, but I was hoping you'd be a little more observant than that...
:{{DIcon}} Your hat...
::'''Hu Tao:''' Haha, yes! Very observant of you! And all the proof I need that you spend your free time staring longingly at pictures of me. There's no way you'd spot a detail like that otherwise.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Here. This plum branch is for you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 16 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, isn't this the branch from your hat!?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Yes, and going back further, it's from a tree that I planted myself. {{Traveler}}, you have countless friends in Liyue Harbor, so I'm sure you'll get plenty of fortune coins.
:'''Hu Tao:''' I wanted to give you something different. Something that will remind you of me whenever you look at it.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 16 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eek! Paimon doesn't like the sound of that!
:'''Hu Tao:''' Okay, then I'll rephrase: Something you can take a look at whenever you miss me.
:{{DIcon}} You just made it worse!
:'''Hu Tao:''' What do you mean? I don't know what's going through your head... Look, all I'm saying is, I can't be by your side 24/7 like Paimon can. There's gonna be times when we're apart.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 16 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Phew, you scared Paimon!
:{{DIcon}} ...I've got a gift for you, too.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Huh? Wait, that sigil... Is this one of the fabled [[Zhongli: Rex Coin|Rex coins]]!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 16 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You've got a great eye, Hu Tao! It's a Rex coin &mdash; although, probably not the genuine article, 'cause the Conqueror of Demons told us he couldn't sense [[Rex Lapis]]'s power in it.
:{{DIcon}} But still, [[Zhongli|the owner]] before us was someone pretty important.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 16 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, that too! So maybe it can keep you safe.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Wow, this is a really special gift... I'll take it! Hehe, thank you both. I'll stay safe, don't you worry.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Anyway, it's getting late, and I have a few things to get ready before I head out to Wuwang Hill. Besides, you should probably get back to Yujing Terrace now &mdash; I know the Tianquan's still waiting for you.
:{{DIcon}} Please, be careful.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Don't worry, I got this.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 16 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright then, bye-bye! And remember &mdash; the sooner you get back, the sooner we can go for a meal together! And hear Yun Jin's singing!
:'''Hu Tao:''' Got it! See ya!
:;(The Traveler and Paimon leave and Zhongli approaches)
:'''Hu Tao:''' It was so nice to spend this time with you...
:'''Hu Tao:''' Oh! What brings you here? No tea drinking today?
:'''Zhongli:''' It would be unbecoming of me to sip tea in leisure while my employer toils alone.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Aha, so you do have a heart after all.
:'''Zhongli:''' Have you made up your mind, Director?
:'''Hu Tao:''' Throughout our history, we've fought off many existential {{sic|threat}} with whatever tools we had at our disposal. Today is no different, we just have to rise to the challenge.
:'''Hu Tao:''' It'll be my first time using this array, so who knows how it'll go. But if I know one thing, it's that I must drive death back where it came from.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Oh, also, {{Traveler}} gave me a special fortune coin &mdash; apparently, it's one of those Rex coins. You're more knowledgeable about this kind of thing than me though. So I'd appreciate your second opinion.
:'''Zhongli:''' It is indeed a Rex coin. It symbolizes good fortune, and may offer some use as a protective charm.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Got it. In that case... after tonight, could you please return it to {{Traveler}} for me?
:'''Zhongli:''' You wish to return the gift? For what reason?
:'''Hu Tao:''' {{Traveler}} reached [[Natlan]], and took a trip to the [[Night Kingdom|land of the dead]] while there. It must have been incredibly dangerous.
:'''Hu Tao:''' {{MC|m=He|f=She}}'s made it this far unscathed, so clearly {{MC|m=he|f=she}}'s blessed with good fortune. But {{MC|m=his|f=her}} journey will only get more dangerous with each step, and that worries me.
:'''Hu Tao:''' So, if there's a chance this Rex coin really can keep a person safe, I want to make sure that person is {{Traveler}}.
:'''Zhongli:''' You make good points, Director. But have you considered that {{Traveler}} perhaps had similar wishes for you?
:'''Hu Tao:''' That's another reason I can't afford to keep it...
:'''Hu Tao:''' I don't know what's going to happen tonight. If worse comes to worst and I don't make it back, I don't want {{Traveler}} to find out this coin didn't work by discovering it in a pile of debris...
:'''Hu Tao:''' What if it upsets {{MC|m=him|f=her}}? What if {{MC|m=he|f=she}} feels like it's all {{MC|m=his|f=her}} fault? I couldn't bear to see {{MC|m=him|f=her}} like that... You know what I mean, right, Zhongli?
:'''Zhongli:''' I fear that I do...
:'''Zhongli:''' Your concern is that the sight of this coin will only make it more difficult to let go of your worldly attachments.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Haha, it's like you're a mind-reader... You know as well as I do that being too attached is a fatal flaw for a funeral director. It's a vice that's all too easy to fall prey to...
:'''Hu Tao:''' But this time, I must not repeat my [[Hu Tao's Father|dad]]'s mistake. That is what's most important here.
:'''Hu Tao:''' ...Alright, since we're this far in, I might as well just tell you the rest too. If I don't return tonight, you'll no longer be a consultant... Because you'll be the 78th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.
:'''Zhongli:''' ...Your work is far from done, Director. I fear there is no one who could hope to take your place.
:'''Hu Tao:''' "Live in life, and die in death." If my time has come, then so be it. There's no sense resisting the inevitable.
:'''Zhongli:''' Nevertheless, I would urge caution. Focus on the task at hand, not what transpired in the past. And do not forget the rest of that saying: "Follow your heart, and do what you can."
:'''Hu Tao:''' I understand... Alright, it's almost time. I should get going.
:;(Hu Tao leaves while talking aloud)
:'''Hu Tao:''' It's a really beautiful day today... I should write a poem to capture this moment.
:'''Hu Tao:''' A butterfly dances in a crimson bouquet, for fear of the ominous rainfall that may soon show its face.
:'''Hu Tao:''' With one last, lingering glance at that carmine hue, she lies among the petals in the garden of eternal rest, as she sets the floral incense ablaze.
:;(The camera pans back to Zhongli)
:'''Zhongli:''' ...The lone butterfly left, but not without a trace. A fragrance remained, her butterfly's embrace.

:{{A|vo eqhdj403 17 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ningguang, Lan Yan, we're back! So, what did you want to discuss?
:'''Ningguang:''' I'll let Miss Lan explain.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 17 lanyan 01.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Remember how I wrote a letter back home to ask about the array? Well, I got a reply.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 17 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Paimon remembers. So was Hu Tao right? No one has to be sacrificed, right?
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 17 lanyan 02.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' ...Unfortunately, my cousin could not give me a definitive answer on this, despite scouring the family library.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 17 lanyan 03.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' But, given that the array gets its power from the Ley Lines, she suspects that the obfuscation requirement may be a rule laid down by the mountains and the land.
:{{DIcon}} What does that mean?
:'''Ningguang:''' Basically... it looks likely that the obfuscation of one person is mandatory after all, because we can't violate the laws of the Ley Lines. Furthermore, the Gate of Death will be used to suppress the fetor this time... which is Director Hu's gate.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 17 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, you're saying, Hu Tao has to die!?
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 17 lanyan 04.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' If my cousin's right, and as I said, she can only speculate... But she also provided me with a method that might just be able to save Director Hu's life.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 17 lanyan 05.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' See this? It's a rattan figure I made for the director. One of many. In case you've forgotten, they work by absorbing evil energy in their owner's place, so they won't come to harm.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 17 lanyan 06.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' With the technique my cousin explained, I managed to connect several of these rattan figures to the gate array. That way, the fetor blast will be shared evenly by everyone in the array.
:'''Ningguang:''' Everyone has agreed to the plan. Keqing, Ganyu, the Conqueror of Demons, Qiqi, Beidou, Yelan, Lan Yan, and I will each hold a rattan figure.
:'''Ningguang:''' Today's Liyue draws its strength from unity. That is how we quelled an [[Osial|ancient god]]'s wrath without the help of Rex Lapis, and that is why we cannot let the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor shoulder the present crisis alone.
:'''Ningguang:''' Nevertheless, the danger posed by the fetor is not to be underestimated. The consequences could be grave, even with everyone sharing the blast.
:'''Ningguang:''' We would like to request your assistance, but the choice is entirely yours. If you have any reservations, we will by no means&mdash;
:{{DIcon}} Count me in.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 17 lanyan 07.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' What did I tell you? I knew {{Traveler}} would help us!
:'''Ningguang:''' Hehe, I never doubted that for a second.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 17 lanyan 08.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Then, please take this rattan figure. I'll link you up to the array right now.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 17 lanyan 09.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' Huh? What's going on? This doesn't make any sense...
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 17 lanyan 10.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' I... I don't think I made a mistake, but it seems like... I can't connect {{Traveler}} to the array.
:'''Ningguang:''' How can this be? What's the problem?
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 17 lanyan 11a.ogg}} {{A|vo eqhdj403 17 lanyan 11b.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' This should work in the exact same way as the gate array &mdash; by using the power of the Ley Lines. But the Ley Lines aren't responding to {{Traveler}}, almost as if they believe {{MC|m=he|f=she}} doesn't exist...
:;(Paimon recalls something and looks at the Traveler.)
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 17 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! So could... [[Irminsul|that be the reason]]?
:{{DIcon}} It's true that the Ley Lines do not contain any information about me.
:'''Ningguang:''' Is that so? Then perhaps this is simply the will of fate...
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 17 lanyan 12.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' I've never heard of anything like that before!
:{{DIcon}} Can we find some other way?
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 17 lanyan 13.ogg}} '''Lan Yan:''' I don't know, this is the first time I've run into a situation like this... I would write to my cousin, but I think we're out of time...

:'''Zhongli:''' I suppose that will be up to her.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 20 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's not good enough! Surely there's gotta be something we can do?
:'''Zhongli:''' As it happens, there is one thing that comes to mind. Namely... If the Seven-and-Eight-Gates Method operates according to the principles of the Ley Lines, the same must also be true of the obfuscation process.
:'''Zhongli:''' But since you cannot connect to the Ley Lines in the first place... Do you see what that implies?
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 20 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?

:{{A|vo eqhdj403 22 hutaoyeye 03.ogg}} '''Grandfather:''' Look. Someone's here to take you home.

;(A [[#Gallery|cinematic]] plays)
:;(Hu Tao follows her grandfather's gaze and sees her plum branch float down from the sky and lands in her open hand, as her father and grandfather fade away, like ephemeral sand in the wind.)
:;(As Hu Tao looks back down at her plum branch, she blinks &mdash; and the Traveler's hand is suddenly clasping hers, having reached through a portal into the border itself to grab Hu Tao's hand and is actively siphoning away all the fetor from her into themselves.)
::'''Hu Tao:''' Traveler!? You're...
::'''{{Traveler}}:''' Don't worry. I've got this
::'''{{Traveler}}:''' Come on. Everyone's waiting for you
::'''Hu Tao:''' ...Mm!
:;(Straining, the Traveler pulls Hu Tao through the portal, absorbing the last of the fetor damage from her in the process and the fetor vanishes from her to appear on them.)
:;(On the other side, the visible fetor fades away from the Traveler as they see the giant tree, now revitalized and free of fetor)
:;(Cinematic ends)

:{{Black Screen|You wake up two days later in the back room of Bubu Pharmacy.}}
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 23 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're finally awake! How do you feel? Does anything hurt?
:{{DIcon}} What happened...?
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 23 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You've been asleep for two whole days! If Baizhu hadn't insisted that you were just out from exhaustion, Paimon would've been worried sick!
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 23 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Still, it is a relief to see you finally wake up again. Guess Baizhu knew what he was talking about.
:{{DIcon}} When did I get here?
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 23 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The night of Lantern Rite, of course! Hu Tao carried you here on her back. Paimon was so worried to see you unconscious... Thankfully, Zhongli was there too, and he said you'd be fine.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 23 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That being said... Why did you sneak off without saying a word? Were you trying to beat Hu Tao's record for running away and getting stranded in the border?
:{{DIcon}} It was an emergency.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 23 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, yeah, Paimon knows. Hu Tao told us the whole story. Sounds like you did something pretty amazing!
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 23 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You've had a lot of visitors over the last couple of days. Zhongli, Ningguang, Lan Yan... and pretty much everyone else you could think of!
:{{DIcon}} Are they still here?
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 23 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Most of them have probably left by now, but Hu Tao's still waiting out in the main room. She's been there the whole time.
:{{A|vo eqhdj403 23 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, you stay in bed and get some rest! Paimon will go get Baizhu to take a look at you.

;(Leave the back room)
:;(It's early morning. The Traveler walks up to the nearby railing and looks out over Liyue Harbor, when a lady's hands cover their eyes from behind.)
:{{Black Screen|Just then, you feel something cool against your face... You've been ambushed again.}}
:'''???:''' One more time, guess whooo~?
:{{DIcon}} I recognize those dulcet tones anywhere, Zhongli.
::'''Hu Tao:''' Good! If you have the energy to joke around, it means you're making a good recovery!
:{{DIcon}} Happy Lantern Rite, Director Hu.
::'''Hu Tao:''' Good! You still recognize me. So the fetor didn't fry your brain.
:'''Hu Tao:''' I'm so glad! Looks like I can stop worrying now... Welcome back, my hero!
:{{DIcon}} You are the real hero.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Hahaha, don't be silly. It's just the two of us here, you really want to talk in glib pleasantries? 'Cause I can out-glib you any day of the week if that's how you wanna do this.
:{{DIcon}} Alright, um... So, how are you holding up?
:'''Hu Tao:''' I'm doing great, thanks to a certain someone! Baizhu gave me a checkup too.
:'''Hu Tao:''' You look remarkably well too, considering what you went through. But are you sure you're well enough to leave yet? You'll only make things worse if you power through before you've fully healed.
:{{DIcon}} I'll be fine.
:'''Hu Tao:''' Well, I sure hope so... You know, I was really surprised you came to rescue me. You took such a huge risk... When did you become so reckless?
:;(She 'chops' the Traveler's forehead with her hand, who responds with a sheepish smile.)
:{{DIcon}} I learned from the best, Director Hu...
:'''Hu Tao:''' Hmph... Hey, look! Liyue Harbor looks so pretty from this angle... Let's see, what's everyone doing at this hour?
:;(Hu Tao goes to the railing and looks downward to the lower levels.)
:'''Hu Tao:''' Hmm... Those two kids look like they're in a hurry... I bet they're racing each other to the fortune coins.
:'''Hu Tao:''' And that [[Nadia (Liyue)|lady]] over there &mdash; her cheeks are so red, you'd think she's caught the sun... Aha, yes! She must be waiting for her [[Vlad|lover]] so they can go set off some fireworks together!
:'''Hu Tao:''' Such a marvelous view. Really puts me in a poetic mood! Hee-hee, okay, I got something:
:'''Hu Tao:''' As fresh festivities fill the streets, while lanterns light the sky like countless times before...
:'''Hu Tao:''' I dwell not on the twists and turns of bygone years, but remember this: that with each new day, I receive the gift of life once more.
:;(Smiling, Hu Tao looks back over her shoulder at her friend.)
:'''Hu Tao:''' Thank you, {{Traveler}}. Happy Lantern Rite.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
* During the conversation between Hu Tao and Zhongli on the bridge, she makes explicit mention of the various stages of her [[Papilio Charontis|Constellation]] up until her constellation five, the final being mentioned by Zhongli.
*: {{Dialogue Start|left-line=1|'''Hu Tao:''' A butterfly dances in a [[Crimson Bouquet|crimson bouquet]], for fear of the [[Ominous Rainfall|ominous rainfall]] that may soon show its face.<br><!--
-->'''Hu Tao:''' With one last, [[Lingering Carmine|lingering glance at that carmine hue]], she lies among the petals in the [[Garden of Eternal Rest|garden of eternal rest]], as she sets the [[Floral Incense|floral incense]] ablaze.<br><!--
-->'''Zhongli:''' ...The lone butterfly left, but not without a trace. A fragrance remained, her [[Butterfly's Embrace|butterfly's embrace]].}}
** In the Chinese version, Hu Tao reads aloud the first five levels of her Constellation verbatim, and Zhongli recites the final one.
