{{Dialogue Start}}<!-- Unvoiced in EN: Arataki Itto, Kaedehara Kazuha, Kamisato Ayato, Kirara, Kujou Sara, Sangonomiya Kokomi, Shikanoin Heizou, Thoma, Yoimiya -->
;(Talk to [[Ei]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 raidenei 04.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...Though there were misunderstandings, wariness, and even hostilities along the way, we still ended up with a celebration in the end.
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 raidenei 05.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Seeing the [[bake-danuki]] together with all these humans and [[youkai]]... It's a moving sight indeed.
:{{DIcon}} Speaking of the bake-danuki... Where are [[Kinkaku]] and the others?
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 raidenei 06.ogg}} '''Ei:''' [[Miko]] took them to [[Mizuki]] so she can check them over. We needed to make sure the disappearance of the Nightmare Fragment did not have an adverse impact on them.
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 raidenei 07.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...After all, you claimed striking down the nightmare could endanger the bake-danuki. Unless... that was a lie?
:{{DIcon}} O&mdash;Of course it wasn't...
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 raidenei 08.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...Heh.

;(Talk to [[Gorou]], [["Gyoubu Koban"]], or [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 gyoubukoban 02.ogg}} '''"Gyoubu Koban":''' Hm! Next time, slash slash, kapow...
:'''Gorou:''' That's weird... I can't seem to understand the bake-danuki anymore...
:'''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Ah, some kind of spell must be wearing off... Although, I think I got the gist.
:'''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Let's play together again next time.

;(Talk to [[Kappa]], [[Hitotsume Kozou]], [[Thoma]], [["Shousei"]], or [[Youko]], optional)
:'''Thoma:''' ...You three feeling alright? No side-effects?
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 youko 01.ogg}} '''Youko:''' All good! That [[Yumekui-Baku]] lady already looked us over!
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 kappa 01.ogg}} '''Kappa:''' We woke up once the Nightmare Fragment was gone... It felt like one big, long dream.
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 hitotsumekozou 01.ogg}} '''Hitotsume Kozou:''' Sorry we couldn't help you with the game, Boss.
:'''Thoma:''' Don't worry about it! Besides, there's still time! Why don't you try out "Akitsu Harpastum" and tell me what you think?
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 shousei 02.ogg}} '''"Shousei":''' Let's kapow together!

;(Talk to [[Kamisato Ayaka]], [["Kichiboushi"]], [[Sayu]], or [[Yoimiya]], optional)
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 sayu 02.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Huh... We finished the game, but it feels like I'm forgetting something, like our original goal...
:'''Yoimiya:''' Well, if you can't remember, it must not have been that important!
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Just let it go and enjoy the festival! All the games are super fun!
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 kichiboushi 02.ogg}} '''"Kichiboushi":''' Haha! Bake-danuki spell, pip pip!

;(Talk to [[Akira]], [[Genta]], or [[Mamoru]], optional)<!--unvoiced in all languages-->
:'''Mamoru:''' Oh, you didn't go to the hot springs?
:{{DIcon}} Well now, I don't see you going either...
:'''Akira:''' ...We did go with the Boss, once. But then he got it into his head to start some sort of competition...
:{{DIcon}} ...What sort of competition?
:'''Genta:''' Um, I forgot. The only thing I remember is almost passing out from the heat...

;(Talk to [[Arataki Itto]])
:'''Arataki Itto:''' Ah, compadre! A little birdie told me you went to Aisa Bathhouse last night!
:'''Arataki Itto:''' I'm gettin' the crew together, and we're gonna go there to celebrate! You in?
:{{A|vo schjeq004 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, we were just there...
:'''Arataki Itto:''' Uh, yeah... But, I bet you were missin' a few people, yeah? Like [[Shinobu]].. and Gorou... and, y'know... [[Ayato]]...
:'''Kuki Shinobu:''' Basically, Boss heard about the trip, and now he really wants to go.
:'''Arataki Itto:''' A&mdash;Anyway! Once you're done perusin', come find me, and we'll SOAK! IT! UP!

;(Talk to Itto again)
:'''Arataki Itto:''' Well? Ready to get your soak on?
:{{DIcon}} Ready!
::'''Arataki Itto:''' Aww yeah! Next stop, Aisa Bathhouse!
:;(Continue below)
:{{DIcon}} Just a sec...
::'''Arataki Itto:''' Oh, compadre... Don't tell me the gaming bug's gotcha bad, like Akira and the others... I mean, the games are fun, but they'll still be there after a good soak!

===Kaedehara Kazuha===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Kaedehara Kazuha)
:'''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Blossoms in the sky, intoxicating the clouds, in drunken stupor...
:{{DIcon}} No games for you, Kazuha?
:'''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' Oh, well, you were drawn to this place, too, weren't you? I did come for the festival, but the cherry blossoms on [[Mt. Yougou]] are as arresting as ever.
:'''Kaedehara Kazuha:''' I like to take things slow, stopping to appreciate the mountain views or the sound of the rain... A vacation should be a bit spontaneous, don't you think?
