;Available after completing To Wish Upon a Star
:'''Mama Coco:''' Being strict is actually what's best for children, don't you think?
:{{DIcon}} About [[Orqo]]...
::'''Mama Coco:''' That's the kid I'm talking about. It's precisely because of his family's circumstances that he needs to grow up faster. What happened to his parents was indeed a tragedy, but what's done is done...
::'''Mama Coco:''' Dwelling on the past is useless. We need to look ahead to the future. And in the future, that kid'll have to rely on himself.
:{{DIcon}} About the star that fell from the sky...
::'''Mama Coco:''' You mean that weird rock? Well, it did fall from the sky, all right. Strange as it is, though, it doesn't seem to be dangerous.
::'''Mama Coco:''' Though the story Orqo is talking about should have nothing to do with it. After all, that story's been passed down for ages, and it speaks of the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]].
::'''Mama Coco:''' *sigh* Though it's not like I can't understand where [[Waranka]] is coming from. But kids have to face the truth someday, and perhaps sooner is better than later.
:{{DIcon}} I'll take my leave for now.
::'''Mama Coco:''' Do be careful!

==Trivia==
* Her name may be a reference to the character "Mama Coco" from the 2017 Mexican-American animated film ''{{w|Coco_(2017_film)|Coco}}'' produced by Disney/Pixar.
===Etymology===
* Mama Coco may be named after the Incan goddess of the sea, {{W|Mama Qucha|Mama Cocha}}.
* Based on the pronunciation of the Chinese name "卡卡妈妈" (''Kǎkǎ Māma'') and considering the names of the two characters, [[Orqo]] and [[Waranka]], in the "[[To Wish Upon a Star]]" mission, it is likely that the real source of '''Mama Coco''' is the character {{w|Ollantay#Plot summary|Mama Caca ("Stone Mother")}} from the Inca dramatic play ''{{w|Ollantay}}''. In the story, there is a character named ''Orqo Waranka'' ("mountain, thousand"), which can be split into the two Natlan characters.
