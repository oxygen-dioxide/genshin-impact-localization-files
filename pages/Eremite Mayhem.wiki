==Steps==
# Defeat The Eremites

==Request Details==
{{Quest Description|The reckless Eremites are raging...}}

===Request from Araby===
Help Needed:<br>
You see all sorts of strange things every day when you're observing ocean life. The previous time, I saw someone drowning near the water's surface, and this time, it's a bunch of {{Color|buzzword|Eremites}}.<br>
Seems like they've taken the {{Color|buzzword|Devantaka Mountain}} for their refuse heap. Could the Corps of Thirty muster up some able hands to settle this?

===Request from Arshia===
Help Needed:<br>
{{Color|buzzword|Eremites}} here, Eremites there, Eremites everywhere!<br>
I came to {{Color|buzzword|Caravan Ribat}} to purchase some goods for our daily needs, but if I were to bump into them on the way, then I may as well not have made the trip at all.<br>
I hope that the Corps of Thirty can solve this problem quickly. We here at Aaru Village are strongly dependent on Caravan Ribat for essential goods, after all.<br>
If this road were to grow more perilous, our lives, too, will certainly become more difficult.

===Request from Tanamart===
Help Needed:<br>
One of my merc pals from the old days informed me that some {{Color|buzzword|Eremites}} are skulking about {{Color|buzzword|the outskirts of Sumeru City}}. And trust me, I know what Eremites get up to without any minders. They'll be a threat to public safety, or I'm an idiot!<br>
Could the Corps of Thirty send someone to mediate an amicable solution for all?
