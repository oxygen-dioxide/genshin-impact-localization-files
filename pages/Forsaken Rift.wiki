They would whisper their secrets into the tree hole, relieving themselves of the burden of keeping the secrets to themselves. The Forsaken Rift is filled with long-forgotten secrets.

'''Forsaken Rift''' is a [[Domain]] located between [[Springvale]] and [[Dragonspine]] in [[Mondstadt]]. Clearing this domain gives [[Character Talent Material]]s. Challenge domains with higher levels to get better rewards.

==Ley Line Disorder==
Each level in this domain has the following Ley Line Disorder, respectively:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
!Level
!Ley Line Disorder
|-
!I
|rowspan=2 |Your character will be periodically inflicted with [[Condensed Ice]], greatly increasing your Stamina Consumption until the inflicted Cryo element is removed.
|-
!II
|-
!III
|rowspan=2 |Your character will be periodically inflicted with [[Condensed Ice]], greatly increasing your Stamina Consumption until the inflicted Cryo element is removed. Icicles will periodically fall from above, dealing {{Color|Cryo DMG}}.
|-
!IV
|}

===Damage===
{{See also|Level Scaling/Reaction#Level Multiplier}}
The {{Color|Cryo DMG}} dealt by the falling Icicles is calculated as <math>\text{Multiplier} \times \text{Level Multiplier}</math>. This DMG is affected by the player's [[Cryo RES]], but unaffected by [[DEF]] or [[DMG Reduction]]. The final result is rounded down.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! Level !! Multiplier !! Base Damage

! III
| 0.3
| 222.74
|-
! IV
| 0.5
| 570.83
|}

==Trivia==
* The level names for this domain are 'Frosted Altar' for Freedom talents, 'Frozen Abyss' for Resistance talents, and 'Realm of Slumber' for Ballad talents. The ice-related names are likely related to how the Ley Line Disorder inflicts an ice-related effect on you and drops icicles and how all the enemies are Cryo-based. Realm of Slumber may be related to how the effect drains your stamina, making you fatigued or 'tired' quicker.
**The association between altar and freedom is likely based around Mondstadt being all about freedom, even in their worship of Barbatos.
**The association between abyss and resistance may be related to Mondstadt's expedition and resistance against the abyss, or perhaps there's another connection.
**The association between slumber and ballad may simply refer to the sleep-inducing qualities of music.
