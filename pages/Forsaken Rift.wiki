==Trivia==
* The level names for this domain are 'Frosted Altar' for Freedom talents, 'Frozen Abyss' for Resistance talents, and 'Realm of Slumber' for Ballad talents. The ice-related names are likely related to how the Ley Line Disorder inflicts an ice-related effect on you and drops icicles and how all the enemies are Cryo-based. Realm of Slumber may be related to how the effect drains your stamina, making you fatigued or 'tired' quicker.
**The association between altar and freedom is likely based around Mondstadt being all about freedom, even in their worship of Barbatos.
**The association between abyss and resistance may be related to Mondstadt's expedition and resistance against the abyss, or perhaps there's another connection.
**The association between slumber and ballad may simply refer to the sleep-inducing qualities of music.
