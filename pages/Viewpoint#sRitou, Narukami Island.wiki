|text    = Legend has it that hundreds of years ago, [[Hiiragi Hiroshi|Lord Hiiragi Hiroshi]] of the [[Kanjou Commission]] miraculously built a prosperous trade center from a deserted island, and greatly impressed the [[Raiden Shogun (Disambiguation)|Shogun]]. In the days when the [[Sakoku Decree]] was in force, the headquarters of the Kanjou Commission still flourished. However, the merchants from faraway nations languished, and the streets were no longer the bustling appearance of a century ago. Perhaps this is the best reflection of the business of mortals: those who become successful overnight will also lose everything in a day.
