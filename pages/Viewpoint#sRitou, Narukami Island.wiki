|text    = Legend has it that hundreds of years ago, Lord Hiiragi Hiroshi of the Kanjou Commission miraculously built a prosperous trade center from a deserted island, and greatly impressed the Shogun. In the days when the Sakoku Decree was in force, the headquarters of the Kanjou Commission still flourished. However, the merchants from faraway nations languished, and the streets were no longer the bustling appearance of a century ago. Perhaps this is the best reflection of the business of mortals: those who become successful overnight will also lose everything in a day.
