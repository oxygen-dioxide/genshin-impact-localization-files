==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kumar:''' Greetings. May [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] bless you.
:{{DIcon}} You are...
:;(Before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
:::'''Kumar:''' I live in Vimara Village, so you'll probably see me around if you visit here often.
:::'''Kumar:''' Hmm... My elder brother, [[Banka]], may try to stop me, but I think it's fine to tell you that I have [[Eleazar]].
:::'''Kumar:''' Have you heard about this disease in Sumeru? Scales gradually cover the body of the person until they are rendered immobile...
:::'''Kumar:''' The doctors recommended that I live in an environment of rich flora because it can alleviate my pain.
:::'''Kumar:''' While there are reasons for this that I do not know, I'm sure the blessings of Lesser Lord Kusanali are part of it, right?
:::'''Kumar:''' After all, everything in Sumeru is linked to her after the Greater Lord's departure.
:::{{DIcon}} Take care of yourself.
:::'''Kumar:''' Thanks, but there's no need to worry. My condition is quite stable now.
:::'''Kumar:''' If I just continue resting as usual, then even if I can't train and hunt as my brother hopes, my condition shouldn't be too bad.
:::'''Kumar:''' My only regret... is probably that I can't go to the city and experience the [[Sabzeruz Festival]].
:::'''Kumar:''' I heard the [[Akademiya]] isn't holding the Sabzeruz Festival as often as it used to. I may never get to attend one if that goes on...
:;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
:::'''Kumar:''' I'm one of the residents here in Vimara Village. If you came around often before, you might've seen me here.
:::'''Kumar:''' Not that any of that matters now, though. By the grace of Lesser Lord Kusanali, my illness has been completely healed!
:::'''Kumar:''' I'm not sure if you've heard, but we have this disease here in Sumeru that causes scales to gradually cover someone's body until they are rendered immobile...
:::'''Kumar:''' To be honest, I was prepared for the worst, but thanks to our archon's miraculous touch, I have a future again.
:::'''Kumar:''' Haha, let's see who dares to doubt her power now!
:::{{DIcon}} That's wonderful. What do you plan to do next?
:::'''Kumar:''' To be honest, I'm not quite used to my body being this healthy.
:::'''Kumar:''' Well, have I got lots of things I want to do! I'd like to train and hunt with my elder brother, and I'd like to go outisde Vimara Village and explore the world!
:::'''Kumar:''' That said, he's still quite worried about me, and has suggested that I stay in the village for a while more to observe my condition ─ and that I should read a couple more books in the meantime.
:{{DIcon}} You, too.
::'''Kumar:''' Thank you, goodbye.
