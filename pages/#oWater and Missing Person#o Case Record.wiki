|A popular potion circulating quite widely. It gives the drinker a very pleasant experience for a short time, but its side effects are equally strong. The producer uses these special characteristics to earn a massive profit from its trade.

|You discovered objects within the containers labelled with the names of those who owned them within the depths of the HQ. The names here must have something to do with the victims in the serial disappearances case. This might be proof that this was their "final stop."

{{A|vo fdaq006 7 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's super shocked for sure, but isn't there an age mismatch? Or is Paimon still missing something?

|[[File:Case Record File.png|100px]]<br>Callas' Case Records
|Three years ago, on a rainy night, banquet-goers heard two gunshots outside the house. When they reached the scene, Callas had a gun in his hands, and Jacques had been shot and slain. Based on the investigations done then, there was no possibility that anyone else could have done the deed and escaped, and Callas was thus adjudged to have been the culprit.

{{A|vo fdaq005 4 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Here we go again trying to crack an impossible case... All proof and no motive...
|-
|[[File:Case Record Testimony From Jacques' Family.png|100px]]<br>Testimony From Jacques' Family
|Jacques' family believes that he had struggled greatly with the order to kill Callas. Did Callas act in self-defense, or was there more to the incident?

{{A|vo fdaq005 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If Paimon was Jacques, Paimon would probably help whoever Paimon finds more trustworthy, someone like... {{Traveler}}!

|Florent, the advisor to the Spina di Rosula, claimed that he was very grateful to Callas for his kindness. He was also present at the banquet on the day of the case and can provide evidence that Callas did not carry a gun with him when he went out.

|[[File:Case Record Information Regarding Thierry.png|100px]]<br>Information Regarding Thierry
|Thierry is the person responsible for official contact between the Spina di Rosula and the Gardes. According to him, only the sufficiently rich can privately own large numbers of Gardemeks.

{{A|vo fdaq005 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He seems good friends with Navia... Could he really be the culprit?
|-
|[[File:Case Record Information Regarding Marcel.png|100px]]<br>Information Regarding Marcel
|Marcel is the leader of the Confrerie of Cabriere, and was the organizer of the banquet years prior. The Confrerie and the Spina di Rosula have always maintained a close working relationship. Though his recollection of the events of the case is quite foggy, he is willing to defend Navia.

{{A|vo fdaq005 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Navia called him "Uncle"... So it couldn't have been him, right...?
|-
|[[File:Case Record File.png|100px]]<br>Suspect Analysis
|Combining the information regarding the Gardemeks and the investigation results so far, it can be concluded that there is only one person who can have a large number of Gardemeks in his possession and run the Sinthe business without leaving traces. This person is none other than Marcel.

{{A|vo fdaq005 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How could it be... He's so close to her, has he been deceiving her all this time...
