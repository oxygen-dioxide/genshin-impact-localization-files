==Mona and Snowball==
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to [[Mona]] after reaching Trusted with [[Snowball]])
:'''Mona:''' Me... Meow?
:'''Mona:''' Is this really how cats greet one another? I wonder if my pronunciation's on point...?
:'''Snowball:''' Meow?
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like "Snowball" didn't understand even a whisker.
:'''Paimon:''' Mona, are you trying to speak "Cat"...?
:{{DIcon}} Professor Megistus, that is not how you pronounce it.
:{{DIcon}} Try roaring at it, like, "RAWR"!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! "Rawr" sounds more like tigers or lions! That's a good way to frighten a kitty and turn it into a scaredy-cat!
:'''Mona:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon! So the rumors were true &mdash; you really are working at the Furball Fortress!
:'''Paimon:''' "Working" probably isn't the right word. We're helping Valerina and Rosaria out, so we're more like... consultants!
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, that's it! Being called a "consultant" sounds really impressive, hehe!
:'''Paimon:''' By the way, Great Astrologer Mona, are you looking to adopt a cat to assist you in your astronomical observations?
:'''Mona:''' Based on my understanding of astrology, it shouldn't be too hard to teach a cat to read the various aspects of the stars. I might even... teach one to help me write manuscripts...?
:'''Mona:''' (Steal a peek at Snowball)
:'''Paimon:''' (Boldly stare straight at Snowball)
:'''Snowball:''' Meow!
:'''Mona:''' *cough* On second thought, maybe not. One who can only read the stars but is ill-versed at stringing words together would not suffice to convey my illuminating insights.
:'''Mona:''' If I really needed an assistant, it would be better to just take a trip to [[Fontaine]] and recruit some staff member from [[The Steambird]] or find a [[Melusine]] who can use a typewriter and bring them back to Mondstadt...
:'''Mona:''' Were I to really adopt a cat, at most it would be to play with it a bit, to relax and relieve the stress from the exhaustion of academic inquiry.
:'''Mona:''' One mustn't be a bad owner. When you get tired, it would be best if the cat is tired enough for a cat nap as well.
:'''Mona:''' Before I set foot in here, I never imagined hanging out with cats would be such a joy... Ah, how wonderful life would be if we could always be happy like this!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, looks like you're going to be a really conscientious owner! Guess this cat's gonna be in fine hands!
:'''Mona:''' But I've also heard that some cats can be quite rambunctious. Always jumping around, biting, and clawing the furniture...
:'''Mona:''' Imagine my manuscripts or astrology tomes, ruined by feline canines &mdash; that'd be troublesome indeed!
:'''Paimon:''' Making a snack out of precious books... Paimon can barely imagine something so terrifying!
:'''Mona:''' "Snowball" looks quite well-behaved, but seems not to comprehend my meaning... Perhaps we lack that special connection.
:'''Mona:''' So I would like to observe a bit more &mdash; you know, keep an eye out for obedient cats.
:'''Mona:''' Oh, and I must calculate the cost of a cat bed, cat food, and other expenses. Not too luxurious, but also not so shabby. Wouldn't do to submit the cat to hardship.
:{{DIcon}} It's okay, take your time.
:{{DIcon}} There are many more furry felines in this fortress.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, Valerina said that she'll adopt even more strays in the future, so even if no cats catch your eye today, you can always come back often to play and have a look!
:'''Snowball:''' Meow~

;(Talk to Mona again, optional)
:'''Mona:''' Hmm... Well, I do find inspiration sometimes when I play with the cats.
:'''Mona:''' But as I do, I find my motivation to write waning... On the other end, you're always raring to go every time I see you. It's almost as if you're simply inexhaustible!
:{{DIcon}} Hold on, we're not workaholics either!
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah! We're always traveling, so we don't do too much exhausting work.
::'''Mona:''' But when I dropped by The Steambird before to take care of some things, I noticed an editor compiling mountains of notes. Hundreds were related to "a {{MC|m=Blond|f=Blonde}} Traveler."
::'''Mona:''' Destroying the Pufferfruit floating here and there, defeating monsters and bandits up and down the land, escorting masterless cargo through dangerous areas...
::'''Mona:''' And every seven days, taking care of commissions from ordinary citizens, sometimes completing dangerous bounties...
::'''Mona:''' Your weekly workload is practically fourteen to seventy times that of some elite adventurers! Some people even ask for star readings to predict when you'll arrive, just so they can hire you!
::'''Paimon:''' Huh? So, we... Are we actually that hardworking... and popular?
::'''Mona:''' If you could apply that same industriousness to helping me write articles... I mean, I would provide a detailed summary and the underlying theoretical basis, and you would just help me put it to paper...
::'''Mona:''' We could probably publish hundreds of papers in a year... No, we'd be able to publish a slew of books with tons of time to spare!
::{{DIcon}} Great! And what would my cut be?
:::'''Paimon:''' Paimon's not sure you get paid all that much for your writing anyway... Would there be enough left if we split the proceeds...?
:::'''Mona:''' We'd split it down the middle regardless of the amount, of course! With my brains and your tireless toil, it would be a completely fair arrangement! The more we write, the more we'll sell and the greater the readership. The income will naturally grow substantially!
:::'''Mona:''' Oh, I've prepared a whole bunch of theses! So many that I'd not run out of material even if I proceeded at an ideal pace for several years! I'll wager that plenty of those articles will end up being cited and utilized by the academic community &mdash; and oh, those licensing fees will be glorious!
::{{DIcon}} My handwriting isn't exactly the prettiest...
:::'''Paimon:''' Now that you mention it, compared to professional authors, Paimon's handwriting is also... Well, not the best, and not very fast either.
:::'''Mona:''' That's fine. I can buy a typewriter from Fontaine, and it's not like articles printed in newspapers use our original handwriting!
:::'''Mona:''' And they write quite elegantly indeed, but a typewriter that would fit the title of "the Great Astrologist" would be hard to find... Still, I'm sure I can purchase one if I search hard enough!
::'''Mona:''' Anyway, if you are willing, then we can discuss the details once I've finished preparations.
::'''Mona:''' Who knows? Perhaps we'll become an ace astrology arrangement with the highest proportion of thesis contributions!
:{{DIcon}} Are the manuscripts being difficult lately?
::'''Mona:''' "Difficult" is not the phrasing I'd use. "Not ideal in quality," perhaps. Though the results of my astrological observations are crystal clear, and my mind is equally sure about how it wants to convey them, I just can't put quill to paper.
::'''Mona:''' If I were to put out something wishy-washy under these circumstances, the quality would not be worthy of the name of Mona Megistus, the Astrologist!
::'''Paimon:''' Ah, so it's not just "burnout," but the high expectations you have for yourself...
::'''Mona:''' Yes, and it was at such a moment that I happened to hear about the trial opening of the Furball Fortress, and thought I'd come and try relaxing a bit here. You know, get myself back in the right state of mind.
::'''Mona:''' But after playing with the cats, I found that I was... too relaxed, while the study of the stars and penning papers requires a certain seriousness...
::'''Paimon:''' That's totally normal! Maybe you just haven't played enough! If you cut playtime short and force yourself to work, it's no surprise that you won't be able to focus!
::'''Paimon:''' Just don't think about anything, empty your head completely, and just take a nap when you tire yourself out from playing! You'll definitely be full of energy and enthusiasm the next day!
::{{DIcon}} That would be ideal, anyway...
::{{DIcon}} But what if you still just wanna have fun...
::'''Mona:''' You do have a point, Paimon, which does fit with another possibility &mdash; which is that the current course of fate has yet to come into contact with some key factor.
::'''Mona:''' Deadlines are fixed, but days suited to important work are flexible. We must wait for the crucial sign...
::'''Mona:''' But for now, I shall follow your advice and stop thinking. I'll continue enjoying myself here in the Furball Fortress. Who knows? The sign that I should pick up my pen just might come tomorrow...
::'''Mona:''' Thanks, {{Traveler}}! And you too, Paimon!
:{{DIcon}} We'll talk again later!
::'''Mona:''' Yes, it looks like you still have work to do. I shan't take up any more of your time, then.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Amber and Bunny==
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to [[Amber]] after reaching Trusted with [[Bunny]])
:'''Amber:''' Meow, meow meow&mdash;meooooow~~
:'''Bunny:''' Meow! Meow meow meow!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmmm... Both Bunny and Amber have a point...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, so that's it...
:{{DIcon}} A most astute observation.
:{{DIcon}} Hold on, I'm a bit lost.
:'''Paimon:''' Actually, Paimon doesn't really get it either, but she can tell that Amber and Bunny have reached an understanding!
:'''Amber:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon! You're here! I was just thinking about going to look for you!
:'''Amber:''' I've already heard all about how you're helping Valerina with the Furball Fortress!
:'''Amber:''' That's the {{Traveler}} and Paimon for you! The second you're back in Mondstadt, you're already being such a huge help!
:{{DIcon}} I, the Honorary Knight, will fulfill my mission, no matter its nature.
:{{DIcon}} The defense of the cats of Mondstadt is one of my many responsibilities.
:'''Paimon:''' Speaking of which, what were you and Bunny discussing just now? You seemed to be having a really fun conversation.
:'''Bunny:''' Meow, meow meow?
:'''Amber:''' Oh! I was just asking Bunny about the weather, and whether or not it would rain.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Do cats know that kind of thing?
:'''Amber:''' Hehe, [[Lisa]] said something about that!
:'''Amber:''' According to a book she read, cats are very sensitive to humidity, and don't like the feeling of being wet.
:'''Amber:''' So, if they notice a sudden increase in the humidity, they'll start nervously pawing their faces and licking their fur.
:'''Amber:''' Once a cat does something like that, it's a sign that a large rainstorm is likely on its way.
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, Paimon had no idea, that's so cool! Guess we just learned something amazing by accident!
:'''Paimon:''' In that case, {{Traveler}}, let's pay more attention to cats during our travels! That way, we won't... keep getting soaked by huge downpours from those big black clouds!
:{{DIcon}} I suppose we'll have to pay more attention going forward.
:{{DIcon}} Since when haven't I paid close attention to cute kitties?
:'''Amber:''' I originally came here to ask Valerina about something.
:'''Amber:''' But just as I was talking to her, this little kitty snuggled up close to me and yawned so loudly! It was just too cute!
:'''Amber:''' Since she was so affectionate towards me, then... Well, then I need to show how friendly I am, too!
:'''Amber:''' That's when I remembered what Lisa told me, so I went ahead and asked Bunny about the weather.
:'''Amber:''' But she responded by rubbing her face, then wagging her tail, then lying on the ground snuggling against my hand...
:'''Amber:''' *sigh* So is it actually going to rain or not over the next few days...?

;(Talk to Amber again, optional)
:'''Amber:''' Hey, you two! You're doing such a great job managing this place! I never imagined you'd be so good at this too!
:{{DIcon}} As long as you're enjoying yourself, Amber!
::'''Paimon:''' That's right! Valerina also orders food from [[Good Hunter]], so Amber, you can stay here and play when you're on vacation!
::'''Paimon:''' Oh! Speaking of work, have you finished all your recent missions, Amber? When you were asking Bunny about the weather... Was it because you have to go out on gliding patrol soon?
::'''Amber:''' Relax, no need to worry! I won't be going out on patrol today. I was just asking Bunny about the weather to make conversation, that's all!
::'''Amber:''' I'm here today for two reasons! First, to satisfy my own curiosity, and second, to help a friend...
::'''Amber:''' I have a friend who's very skilled at making handicrafts, and used to make all kinds of toys for kitties and doggies. Many of the furnishings at The Cat's Tail were made by her!
::'''Amber:''' After I heard about the Furball Fortress, she contacted Valerina, and supplied some furniture and toys &mdash; the very same ones you see here, in fact!
::'''Amber:''' What I didn't imagine was that Valerina couldn't bear to accept donations, and insisted on paying her.
::'''Amber:''' Now that the Fortress is a few days into its trial opening, my friend wants to understand whether or not the cats like her toys, but she doesn't really have time, and she doesn't understand cats very well either...
::'''Amber:''' So I'm here to conduct an on-the-spot inspection! And the results are in. Full marks!
::'''Paimon:''' If even the person making cat toys can't communicate with them, how'd you manage it, Amber?
::{{DIcon}} Natural talent?
::{{DIcon}} You practiced with Baron Bunny?
::'''Amber:''' I don't know either... Maybe you're right, {{Traveler}} &mdash; those do both sound like good reasons. But maybe there's another, and that's my duties as an Outrider?
::'''Amber:''' Outriders are different from scouts, who need to both quickly obtain intelligence on the enemy, but also strike first. Outriders need to do their best to stay out of sight and use every means at their disposal to gather intel.
::'''Amber:''' Sometimes, the chirping of birds, the bouncing of squirrels, and the grunting of boars can tell me what I need to know about monsters.
::'''Amber:''' If I'm lucky, animals that are familiar with me will come up and warn me of monsters of their own accord when they see me in areas I often patrol.
::'''Amber:''' Whether they do it by chirping, bouncing, or grunting, they all mean pretty much the same thing: "Oooh, scary! There's bad guys over there!"
::'''Amber:''' Compared to those sensitive wild animals, the cats outside are really easy to communicate with, never mind these super well-behaved little kitties in the Furball Fortress!
::'''Paimon:''' P&mdash;Paimon never imagined that Outriders would have to master skills like those... If it was Paimon, she'd probably get dizzy just trying to listen for a little while!
::'''Amber:''' Oh, it's not some essential skill! It's just something I've picked up from my experiences. For an Outrider, the most important skill to master is using a wind glider.
::'''Amber:''' On that note, {{Traveler}}, your wind glider skills haven't gotten rusty in your long absence from Mondstadt, have they?
::{{DIcon}} Would you like to test me personally, Instructor Amber?
::{{DIcon}} My gliding skills soar upward by the second!
::'''Amber:''' Now that's the spirit! That's what I like to see!
::'''Amber:''' The next time we meet, I'll be sure to give you a real test!
::'''Amber:''' If your skills really are even sharper than before, then I'll personally make you some [[Sticky Honey Roast]]!
::'''Paimon:''' Yay! Amber's Sticky Honey Roast!
::'''Paimon:''' Let's find a time to practice a bit more soon, {{Traveler}}! You've gotta make sure you can back your boasts up!
:{{DIcon}} What kind of cats do you like, Amber?
::'''Amber:''' Me? I'm not really sure myself...
::'''Amber:''' Each cat is cute in its own way, so it's really hard to compare...
::'''Paimon:''' That's true! Fur color, build, fur patterns, eyes, ears... There are combinations of characteristics beyond count! If Paimon had to choose, she wouldn't be able to pick either...
::'''Amber:''' Though when you put it that way, I don't think I've ever seen a red cat...
::{{DIcon}} A red cat?
::{{DIcon}} A [[Pyro]] Kitty!
::'''Paimon:''' If there really were red cats, Paimon bets they'd be super energetic and wreck the whole house if they got upset...
::'''Amber:''' Well, [[Teyvat]]'s a big place! You can find all manner of amazing and mysterious things here.
::'''Amber:''' Just think about it&mdash; There are slimes of all different elements and colors, so maybe there are cats with all sorts of fantastic and exotic colors in some place we've never heard of...
::'''Amber:''' Yeah! Y'know, the [[Varka|Grand Master]]'s really experienced and knowledgeable, so maybe he's seen some during his travels!
::'''Amber:''' Once he comes back, let's find an opportunity to sit down and talk together &mdash; we can ask him then!
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for the compliments! We'll keep at it!
::'''Amber:''' Yeah! But don't forget to rest. Try not to tire yourself and Paimon out!

==Razor and Dustball==
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to [[Razor]] after reaching Trusted with [[Dustball]])
:'''Razor:''' ...
:'''Dustball:''' ...Meow.
:'''Razor:''' ...It's you. Me, I'm talking.
:'''Paimon:''' Talking... Razor, are you talking to Dustball?
:'''Dustball:''' Meow, meow-meow.
:'''Paimon:''' It seems like Dustball is trying to say... "That's right"?
:'''Razor:''' A familiar scent, looking for friends.
:'''Razor:''' It is good. Happy.
:'''Dustball:''' Meow, meow.
:'''Razor:''' Friends followed the scent. You came too, happy. On your body, the smell of wind and rain, very familiar... The scent of cats, also familiar.
:'''Razor:''' Paimon, very sweet scent. Smell good.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh!? Sweet... Could that be the flavor of the pancakes Valerina gave us? D&mdash;Did Paimon eat that many?
:{{DIcon}} I gave you half of my portion, remember?
:{{DIcon}} No sweat, you can still eat triple what you ate before.
:'''Paimon:''' Really? Paimon didn't even notice... Mmm, it's all the pancake's fault for being so delicious!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, and Paimon also wants to eat [[Sweet Madame]]s, [[Steak]]s, and [[Mondstadt Hash Brown|Hash Brown]]s... oh, and drink some [[Apple Cider]]!
:'''Paimon:''' Okay, that's the menu for the next meal then! C'mon, {{Traveler}}, let's go place our order with Valerina! You come too, Razor!
:'''Razor:''' Thank... Thank you...
:'''Razor:''' Dustball has brought me lots of... nuts...
:'''Razor:''' And, meat boxes... I am very full.
:'''Paimon:''' Sounds like Valerina ordered delivery, then? Did Dustball deliver the food to you, Razor?
:'''Dustball:''' Meow-meow. Meow!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon never imagined that the cats would actually end up taking care of the customers here in the Furball Fortress!
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like you really are the cat's meow, eh, Razor?

;(Talk to Razor again, optional)
:'''Razor:''' Seeing lupical, I am happy.
:{{DIcon}} Razor, are you acquainted with Dustball?
:{{DIcon}} It feels like you already knew each other.
:'''Razor:''' It, sleeps outside city wall. Takes me there. Very comfy.
:'''Razor:''' It has many friends, many, outside city... starving...
:'''Razor:''' Inside the city, there's food... Me, hunting, there's food.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, so you already made friends with Dustball outside the city...
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like you do have quite a few friends out there.
:'''Paimon:''' Then, they deliver the food out to their friends outside...
:'''Paimon:''' Why don't those little cats just come inside the city? Sure, the walls might be a little high, but there's shelter from the wind and rain and plenty to eat!
:'''Razor:''' They like, butterflies flying high. They don't like, places without wind.
:'''Razor:''' ...Dustball different. Like people more.
:'''Razor:''' He wants to give food to friends. His friends like human food.
:'''Paimon:''' They like human food, but don't want to live in the city. Those are some pretty fickle cats!
:'''Razor:''' He wants to bring friends, inside. Use food, bring them inside.
:{{DIcon}} Convincing cats to come inside with food...
:{{DIcon}} That actually might do the trick...
:'''Paimon:''' But if we bring all those cats over here from outside, will the Furball Fortress be able to handle it?
:'''Paimon:''' If this place was really filled to the brim with all kinds of cats, Valerina would be really happy, but the funds might...
:'''Razor:''' Cats good, food good, hungry, bad. I will help!
:{{DIcon}} Anyway, we should make sure that the cats are fed first.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, no matter what, we should take care of delivering the food before anything else. If only we could convince them to come live in the city...
:{{DIcon}} And we need to explain things to Valerina...
:'''Paimon:''' That's right, after all, the costs of running this Furball Fortress are all coming right out of her pocket.
:{{DIcon}} Razor, how are the cats outside the city doing right now?
:'''Razor:''' Past few days, brought food to friends. Now, they not hungry.
:'''Paimon:''' Phew... That's a relief. Now that we don't have to worry about the cats suffering from hunger pangs while we speak, we can go discuss this with Valerina...
:'''Razor:''' Thank you, Lupical. When with you, no need to worry.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Fischl and Dopey==
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to [[Fischl]] after reaching Trusted with [[Dopey]])
:'''Fischl:''' Ohoho! So this is the rumored sacred land that people name the Furball Fortress! And yet it is furnished in such a prosaic manner &mdash; shabby, one might even call it.
:'''Fischl:''' Surely a few... swings woven from the vines of purple agate grapes might be built! Pure silver lamps mounted with candles made of abyssal sea salt, all the better to light the cat-feeding platters with the motifs of nightborne stars!
:'''Fischl:''' And... Yes, statues! Forged in the image of cat familiars by melting the venerable coinage of lost dynasties and adorning them with strange pearls and dewdrops from the depths of a fjord. Surely, this would make for an amenable choice!
:'''Fischl:''' You surely must agree, do you not, dear familiar...
:'''Fischl:''' ...Hmm. You have yet to declare your name to your Prinzessin. Think on that, then, and know that it shall be your utmost honor to be known to her!
:'''Dopey:''' Meow?
:'''Paimon:''' His name is "Dopey," esteemed Prinzessin!
:'''Paimon:''' Dopey isn't the brightest, and he can't really understand or appreciate your exquisite choice of words. Please, show him clemency, Prinzessin...
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, wait, no, that's not right! Why does Paimon get like this whenever she sees Fischl?
:{{DIcon}} Nothing wrong with that, let me give it a whirl too!
:{{DIcon}} I, the Great Cat Conjuror, sincerely pay my humble respects!
:'''Fischl:''' Haha, as I anticipated! Cat Conjurors, thou hath once more been brought before our august person by the weavings of the threads of fate...
:'''Fischl:''' 'Tis a most pleasing reunion!
:'''Paimon:''' What a title... Looks like Fischl heard about us from Valerina!
:'''Fischl:''' By your counsel, much thought have I given of late within [[Immernachtreich]] to realize the ingenuities obtained from prior experiences, and...
:'''Fischl:''' I have decided to select the most sagacious and sensible of cat familiars to accompany my eminent person on my sojourns!
:'''Dopey:''' Meow~
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, so you were also planning on taking care of a cat, Fischl? Well, understandable. Most people want to have their own after seeing just so how adorable they are!
:'''Paimon:''' But Fischl, don't you already have [[Oz]]?
:'''Paimon:''' And the two of you tend to move really fast, can a cat keep up? Or... Are you gonna have Oz fly while carrying the cat?
:'''Fischl:''' Hmph! I, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, often traverse three thousand universes. Though such a journey may not be long, having more suitable companions and gaining insight into things easily overlooked... naturally wouldn't hurt.
:'''Fischl:''' Oz also would like to have a cat familiar to play... *cough* Ahem, to join forces with to guarantee that my mood shall shine bright as moonlight every second of every day!
:'''Fischl:''' Yet, 'tis a shame that though Oz went to great pains to don a form that sets most at ease, he could not diminish his majesty fully, and could not approach the cat familiars.
:'''Fischl:''' Whenever dear Oz gets within five paces of a cat familiar, their fur shall inadvertently stand on end and inflate like a Bloatty Floatty unmoored. Any closer, and terror overtakes them, and they flee for the hills.
:'''Fischl:''' The Anemo Archon's devoted and loyal nuns recommended that Oz repose without, and as their advice was sound, I graciously assented.
:'''Paimon:''' Majesty? Oh, right, Paimon gets it...
:'''Paimon:''' You mean that Oz's body has so much Electro energy that the second he enters the Furball Fortress, all the feline fur gets electri-fried, right?
:'''Paimon:''' But if that's true, then how could a cat ever travel with you, Fischl...?
:'''Paimon:''' If only there was some material in Teyvat that could block the effects of [[Electro]]!
:'''Paimon:''' Then we could make cat clothes out of that material, and then a cat could travel with you and Oz, no problem!
:'''Dopey:''' Meow?
:{{DIcon}} Gimme! Give it to me first!
:{{DIcon}} Those [[Electro Slime]]s will be no match once I have donned this panoply of war!
:'''Paimon:''' But now that Paimon thinks about it, elemental power is super-duper-mega strong! If there was a material that could just easily resist something as powerful as the elements... That would be too good to be true!
:'''Paimon:''' We probably shouldn't stand around daydreaming!
:'''Fischl:''' Ah, the naivete! Do not jump to judge a cat familiar's talents through common sense! The semantic resources of mere mortal words struggle to accurately convey their properties.
:'''Fischl:''' Perhaps somewhere in this world there exists a cat familiar that can... dive deep into the depths, endure in an inferno, and ride upon the wind! Such a special entity would surely have no fear of thunder or lightning.
:'''Fischl:''' So long as I am patient in my search, I shall find it &mdash; forsooth, even if I should seek for ten years or a hundred, it shall be but a fleeting instant in the Immernachtreich!
:'''Fischl:''' Additionally, the devotion to one's development in life is as important as the innate nature one is born with. I see this "Dopey" has immense potential. Perhaps after joining my retinue for a spell, it will become all the more familiar with the power of Electro!
:'''Fischl:''' By happenstance, I, the Prinzessin, have disentangled a million myriad menial affairs, thus allowing myself a tincture of time to spare. Perhaps, then, it shall not hurt, endeavoring to stay here and familiarize myself with these cat familiars... particularly this "Dopey"!
:'''Dopey:''' Meow!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe! Then Paimon hopes you'll have fun here in the Furball Fortress, Fischl!

;(Talk to Fischl again, optional)
:'''Fischl:''' No need to tremble before the Prinzessin. You have done well indeed to care for these cat familiars... flawlessly, even! Keep up the fine work!
:'''Fischl:''' As the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, I shall remain here for a bit longer... Reading the poetry of the soul of these feline familiars.
:{{DIcon}} Your Royal Highness the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, how proceedeth thy reading?
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah! Paimon's curious too. How're you getting along with the cats? Did you find any special ones?
::'''Fischl:''' ...Hmph!
::'''Fischl:''' It has been just a few short days, merely a snap of the fingers, however, and our promising feline retainers are yet deep in preparation to display their prodigious capabilities before my royal person.
::'''Fischl:''' Only this creature with a name most humble, as though it was seeking to actively conceal its unique talents, this "Dopey," has dared to respond to my tests, and has proven relatively cooperative. Praiseworthy indeed!
::'''Paimon:''' Wait... So the other cats just gave you the cold shoulder because they couldn't understand your... unique way of speaking...?
::'''Paimon:''' And only "Dopey" is usually willing to spend time with you?
::{{DIcon}} Blasphemous slander! How could that be?
::{{DIcon}} Not surprising...
::'''Fischl:''' *Ahem*... Such topics are unworthy of further examination!
::'''Fischl:''' Cat Conjurors, the time has come for you to demonstrate your wisdom and offer up your counsel to mine august person...
::'''Fischl:''' I am sure that by this time, you have long since gained deep insight into... All the habits and favorite victuals fancied by the feline familiars here within the Furball Fortress.
::'''Paimon:''' Oh, so you just wanted to ask what the cats like to eat! That's an easy one.
::'''Paimon:''' You sure are a quick study! The moment you noticed the cats ignoring you, you immediately thought of using food to get close to them...
::{{DIcon}} A classic stratagem!
::{{DIcon}} Most wise, Mein Prinzessin!
::{{Black Screen|You describe the food preferences of several cats to Fischl, and based on Paimon's suggestions, come up with a few combinations that might make them especially happy...}}
::'''Fischl:''' As expected! Such an intricate formulation could surely only be mastered by you, my Cat Conjurors most clever!
::'''Fischl:''' To discern the potential of each of these feline retainers, I, the Prinzessin, must also reveal a suitable skill amongst my talents unnumbered, and show these cats the world...
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, good luck, Fischl!
::'''Paimon:''' Though remember to exercise portion control! Even if it's their favorite foods, cats can't eat too much! Don't let them pig out or waste food!
::{{DIcon}} Paimon...
::{{DIcon}} (Stare...)
::'''Paimon:''' H&mdash;H&mdash;Hey... Why are you looking at Paimon like that? P&mdash;Paimon always orders what she likes and finishes every morsel! She would never waste a crumb!
::'''Paimon:''' A&mdash;At least, Paimon doesn't think she's ever wasted anything...? As for pigging out...
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon may sometimes eat a bit more than usual, but that can't really count as pigging out!
:{{DIcon}} How has Oz been lately?
::'''Paimon:''' Oh, right! What's Oz been up to while you've been playing in the Furball Fortress? Is he just... waiting by the door?
::'''Paimon:''' Or did he go outside the city by himself? Could that be dangerous for him?
::'''Fischl:''' Oho! Do not jest! This is Oz we speak of! Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, the being who reigns supreme over three universes!
::'''Fischl:''' Surely, you are not concerned for his safety? Hardly necessary, I do say! Even at a hundred paces, a thousand paces, any harboring treacherous intent would be overwhelmed and over-awed by the mysterious depths of his gaze, and would never dare to act rashly!
::'''Fischl:''' In our journey through the ages, it is inevitable that Oz and I will sometimes act separately.
::'''Fischl:''' When Oz is not at his place by my side, he prefers peace and quiet, and will actively conceal his person rather than chat with mortals.
::'''Fischl:''' Simply by observing the placid surface of a lake, Oz can sift through millions upon millions of memories, and from them, allow entirely new philosophies yet undreamt of to bubble up... This is one of his favorite pastimes.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks she gets it... He should be by [[Cider Lake]] right now... Somewhere we can't see, resting and enjoying the breeze.
::'''Paimon:''' So you get to have fun in the Furball Fortress, while Oz gets to treat himself, resting the way he likes. Seems like good deal for all!
::{{DIcon}} Very good indeed!
::{{DIcon}} Congratulations are in order!
::'''Fischl:''' Naturally, I, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung, cannot long linger here in this "Furball Fortress," for the pressing matters of many different worlds await the attention of Oz and myself...
::'''Fischl:''' The next time I see you two, my good Cat Conjurors, I shall surely have sought out a... cat familiar who fears not Oz's might and majesty!
:{{DIcon}} Then we shall continue to dedicate ourselves to the cause!
::'''Fischl:''' Most excellent indeed! The cat familiars all applaud your amazing work!

===Valerina===
Available after completing ''[[Furball Fortress's Frightful Fix!]]''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Valerina:''' Honorary Knight, Cat Whisperer Paimon, are you two tired? Would you like something to eat or drink? Or perhaps a massage to relax your muscles?
:{{DIcon}} Never mind that for now. Let's talk business...
::'''Paimon:''' That's right! It can't have been cheap setting up this Furball Fortress. Even Paimon knows that...
::'''Paimon:''' If there's a problem with the finances, don't hesitate to let us know and we'll figure something out!
::'''Valerina:''' Ah, so that's what you were concerned about... Well, we've nothing to worry about as far as Mora is concerned.
::'''Valerina:''' My parents are both merchants. Not super rich, but they do support me with "operational funds" each month, so running the Fortress is no big deal at all.
::'''Valerina:''' I might look like a stiff breeze could blow me away, but I was the "riddle solver" in my adventuring team back when I was with the [[Adventurers' Guild]].
::'''Valerina:''' Quite often my entire team relied on my intelligence to overcome the strange mechanisms in the ruins and get us to the treasure.
::'''Valerina:''' That's to say, I didn't come cheap if anyone wanted to hire me as a freelance adventurer. I used to take on quite a bit of work, too. Sometimes I'd even complete over ten missions in a month.
::'''Valerina:''' In fact, the Mora I earned on my own has surpassed the "operational funds" my parents provide me with. At this point, I have enough to handle my daily expenses for a lifetime and then some.
::'''Valerina:''' I don't really have any hobbies, and now the money that was just sitting in my savings is being used to help cats today, and tomorrow, it might help more animals still. That works out just as it should, don't you think?
::'''Paimon:''' Wow, you're... certainly wealthy beyond Paimon's expectations... Hang on, what do you mean "That works out just as it should"?
::'''Valerina:''' Hmm. How should I put this... I've been part of many adventuring teams in my time, and I've dealt with all sorts of animal-loving people and pets.
::'''Valerina:''' I've also met some compassionate souls asking others... and even the [[Knights of Favonius]] or the Church to adopt stray animals.
::'''Valerina:''' This, while they themselves don't have any money beyond that needed to support themselves.
::'''Valerina:''' Some good souls with the means, on the other hand, donate enough Mora to take care of one or two stray cats. They're good role models.
::'''Valerina:''' I mean, it's good to have sympathy, but I don't really like asking others to do things that they... well, aren't even responsible for in the first place, you know, just because of your own feelings.
::'''Valerina:''' That's why solving this problem is a job for someone who's both willing and rich, like me &mdash; I'll pay, and I'll do my part!
::'''Valerina:''' Of course, I'll stop bothering you two and Ms. Rosaria once I've learned how to get along with cats!
::'''Paimon:''' Huh. Y'know what, Valerina? That's kinda cool! Paimon didn't know that you had this side to you.
::'''Paimon:''' Those stray cats are real lucky to have met someone like you. Paimon sure hopes that the Furball Fortress will help more cats in the future!
::{{DIcon}} Well done indeed!
::{{DIcon}} A commendable spirit!
::'''Valerina:''' Hahaha, such wonderful praise from the Honorary Knight and Cat Whisperer Paimon...! Ah, now I'm getting really pumped up again!
::'''Valerina:''' I'll keep working at it. I will learn how to communicate with cats and manage the Fortress as best I can!
:{{DIcon}} Food and drinks?
::'''Paimon:''' Huh, did you set up a kitchen in here, Valerina? Paimon hasn't seen one.
::'''Paimon:''' And what about the chef? Or are you gonna step up to the plate?
::'''Valerina:''' As you can see, while this place isn't officially open yet, some guests still stay here for long periods of time.
::'''Valerina:''' And I wouldn't say making them go out and buy food and drinks themselves is an ideal situation.
::'''Valerina:''' As such, I've set things up with Sara at Good Hunter so that if our guests have requests for takeout, they can leave them with me. Then, Ms. Rosaria or I will put the order in at Good Hunter.
::'''Valerina:''' I'm not running this place to make a profit, so the prices for ordering takeout will be the same as getting it straight from the restaurant.
::'''Paimon:''' W&mdash;Wait, you're not even charging them for the delivery fee?
::'''Paimon:''' I'm sure our guests will be thrilled to be able enjoy delicious food at the original price while playing with cats!
::'''Valerina:''' Right? Even you think it's a great idea, don't ya, Cat Whisperer?
::'''Valerina:''' Once the Fortress officially opens, this can be one of its selling points!
::'''Valerina:''' The more people we attract, the more likely the cats are to find a suitable owner. Once the number of visitors and the rate at which I adopt cats reaches a nice balance, I'll consider expanding the scale of our operations.
::'''Valerina:''' Once that happens, we'll be able to add a management area, and areas in which other stray animals can be adopted...
::'''Valerina:''' Though that's an issue I'll have to plan out in the future. Just leave the business operations and data gathering to me. Don't sweat that stuff!
:{{DIcon}} No worries, we know you're busy!
::'''Valerina:''' Hah, not as busy as you, I expect! Why, I should watch the two of you work more if anything!

===Rosaria===
Available after completing ''[[Furball Fortress's Frightful Fix!]]'' and playing with Snowball once.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Rosaria:''' Hmm? Not playing with the cats? Or do you have a takeout order for me to take care of?
:{{DIcon}} What do you think of this job?
::'''Paimon:''' You don't seem to play with the cats much. Do you find this... boring?
::'''Rosaria:''' It's alright. Boring and interesting are relative.
::'''Rosaria:''' I don't anticipate any major incidents or accidents occurring here. It's a very ordinary job, little different from staying at the Church...
::'''Rosaria:''' Hmm... No, there are some differences.
::'''Rosaria:''' Some of these cats are very clever, and they understand me just fine. I find interacting with them interesting enough.
::'''Rosaria:''' And even though Valerina is quite similar to Victoria in the way she finds things for me to do... They do have very different ways of doing things.
::'''Rosaria:''' It's a fresh experience, I suppose, and that in itself is new. It's not a bad feeling.
::'''Paimon:''' Well, that's great!
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks you get along pretty well with Valerina and the cats, really!
::{{DIcon}} You do indeed get along well.
::{{DIcon}} You'll be great buddies for sure.
::'''Rosaria:''' Thank you, and I hope things stay that way.
:{{DIcon}} Which cat do you like the most?
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon's curious, too! Have you ever found a cat you'd like to get close to, or wanted to take good care of?
::'''Rosaria:''' That's rather sudden, but I suppose it's natural for people to be curious about things like that.
::'''Rosaria:''' I would say "no."
::'''Paimon:''' Wow. That was quick!
::{{DIcon}} That's a surprise...
::{{DIcon}} I knew it...
::'''Rosaria:''' Different people have their own definitions of the word "like."
::'''Rosaria:''' To me, right now there's no living being or object I think of in those terms. That said, it's about the same for things I "dislike."
::'''Rosaria:''' My willingness to care for these cats, to spend my time on them, is because it's my job...
::'''Rosaria:''' Or should I say that it's a problem before me that requires little effort on my part to solve, so why not?
::'''Rosaria:''' If nothing else, this job's presented me with some... pleasant surprises. I'd consider that good enough.
::'''Paimon:''' Uh, Paimon didn't really get that, but it sounds... positive...?
::{{DIcon}} Don't worry, I didn't get it either.
::{{DIcon}} No worries, Paimon, I'll understand Rosaria for the both of us.
::'''Rosaria:''' Don't overthink it. Life's like a placid lake most of the time. You just need to get used to it.
::'''Rosaria:''' And if you can't... I'm sure someone of your ability can change all you see before you. Good luck either way.
:{{DIcon}} I guess I'll leave you to it.
::'''Rosaria:''' Sure. Come find me if you need anything else.

===Ematol===
{{Dialogue Start}} 
Available before starting ''[[Sir Pouncelot Joins the Lot!]]''
;(Talk to [[Ematol]])
:'''Ematol:''' Oh, where are you, [[Sir Pouncelot]]? Where do I even start to look...
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
::'''Ematol:''' H&mdash;Honorary Knight!
::'''Ematol:''' H&mdash;Honorary Knight! I&mdash;I&mdash;I'm here to report that the squad cat I was charged with caring for... knocked me out and escaped...
::{{DIcon}} Squad Cat?
::{{DIcon}} Knocked you out?
::'''Ematol:''' Well, it's really embarrassing, and I could never let the Honorary Knight worry about me...
::'''Ematol:''' And our [[Albedo|captain]]'s busy with debriefing reports at headquarters... so, I must find Sir Pouncelot on my own!
:{{DIcon}} Are you sure you're alright?
::'''Ematol:''' Y&mdash;Yes, yes I am! Thanks for your concern! I'm just a little woozy after eating a paw to the head...
::'''Ematol:''' Sir Pouncelot didn't really hit me that hard, he was just a bit upset... It's all my fault for being too weak...
::'''Ematol:''' I shouldn't have gotten it into my head to pour [[Phonia]]'s powder on the toy before giving it to the cat...
::'''Ematol:''' I just thought it smelled nice, you know? But Sir Pouncelot saw it as a threat and... Either way, I deserved the beating!
::'''Ematol:''' In any case, it's best I picked up training again. I don't use normal weapons at the frontline, but even slinging bombs requires quite a bit of strength...
::'''Ematol:''' It's okay if I can't take on a boar, but being knocked unconscious by a single swipe from a big cat... Let's just say that I'd fail the next combat skills assessment as I am now for sure. I must uphold my duty as a knight!
::'''Ematol:''' Or perhaps... I could design a bomb-firing device with a caliber exceeding the launch tube width based on [[Liyue]]'s explosives and Fontaine's muskets?
::'''Ematol:''' *ahem* Well, no matter what, that's a job for later...
::'''Ematol:''' And e&mdash;either way, this was all my fault. I&mdash;I can't trouble you with it, Honorary Knight, no way! You're basically Captain-tier, after all! I'm sure you have lots of more important things to do!
::'''Ematol:''' Well, I shan't bother you, then.
:{{DIcon}} Well, I'm not sure just what you're going through... but good luck regardless!
::'''Ematol:''' Y&mdash;Yes, Honorary Knight, {{MC|m=sir|f=ma'am}}! I&mdash;I'll do my best! Yeah! My best!
