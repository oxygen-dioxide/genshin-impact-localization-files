{{Dialogue start}}
;(Read Fatui Action Log<nowiki>:</nowiki> Part I)
:'''Fatui Action Log: Part I:''' "...The people from Liyue have left their large cannon behind. It shows signs of maintenance. It seems that they have not given up on re-opening the mine..."
:'''Fatui Action Log: Part I:''' "...Scouted the area where the crystal fragment was found, clearing a path for others to follow, before returning here to await further orders..."
:'''Fatui Action Log: Part I:''' "...The sonic catcher is reacting to a greater pulse coming from deeper within the mine... It is a grand, but dull noise..."
:'''Fatui Action Log: Part I:''' "...According to sample analysis, the crystal may be older than The Chasm itself. However, we have not found any systemic signs of ancient civilizations nearby..."
----
;(Read Fatui Action Log<nowiki>:</nowiki> Part II)
:'''Fatui Action Log: Part II:''' "...The sonic catcher is constantly blaring. It almost reminds me of Sergeant Anton's old grandmother's snoring... We can't use it as-is..."
:'''Fatui Action Log: Part II:''' "...I'm going to call it the 'Babushka,' I think. This issue might have been caused by the radiation from the crystal itself and the influence of that black matter..."
:'''Fatui Action Log: Part II:''' "...I do not have the spare parts to repair the 'Babushka,' so it has to be disassembled. Sorry, grandma. Setting up camp here and awaiting resupply."
:'''Fatui Action Log: Part II:''' "...It seems that someone is observing us from a vantage point nearby. Spotted an unnatural flash. A telescope (or perhaps the scope of a rifle?) Either way, we have to move..."
----
;(Read Fatui Action Log<nowiki>:</nowiki> Part III)
:'''Fatui Action Log: Part III:''' "...Specialist Bogdana has discovered that the black-colored mud is still constantly propagating. We have to move more swiftly than before..."
:'''Fatui Action Log: Part III:''' "...The anomalous shifts in The Chasm's underground have been gradually increasing in speed. We have to bring the Mokosh Device to the bottom for assembly as soon as possible..."
:'''Fatui Action Log: Part III:''' "...Sergeant Anton reports that a woman has been following us around. We might need to set up some traps and early warning systems..."
----
;(Read Fatui Action Log<nowiki>:</nowiki> Part IV)
:'''Fatui Action Log: Part IV:''' "...An explosion has occurred. Cause unknown. The Mokosh Device, which should have theoretically been able to clear the Abyssal corruption from this place, has overloaded and been destroyed..."
:'''Fatui Action Log: Part IV:''' "...The black pollutant on the main fragment has begun to regenerate... We need to sum up what we've learned thus far..."
:'''Fatui Action Log: Part IV:''' "...One or several hard strikes aimed at key stress points on the main fragment can cause the black matter to retreat..."
:'''Fatui Action Log: Part IV:''' "...Our scouting parties have discovered human activity in different locations. Whether they are human or some other creature is unclear... But perhaps they might even be the culprits behind the black matter's propagation..."

==Trivia==
*The Action Logs may have been written by the unnamed Captain of the Ninth Company. The Fatuus' Journal interacted with in ''[[Perils in the Dark]]'' writes: ''"...This is very similar to the large bell that the Captain discovered in the ruins to the northwest."'' Fatui Action Log: Part III is located near said ruins, suggesting that its author was either the Captain himself or a direct subordinate who accompanied him there.
