==Abilities==
The Polychrome Tri-Stars inherit the abilities of regular [[Fatui Skirmishers]], with the only modification being they will activate their elemental shields immediately upon entering battle.

Additionally, each member of the Polychrome Tri-Stars will cause a unique effect when defeated:

==Trivia==
* The Fatui Skirmishers' title "Polychrome Tri-Stars" is likely a reference to the Black Tri-Stars in the {{w|Mobile Suit Gundam}} series.
** Their codenames, Vasily, Nomokonov, and Sidorenko, reference various Soviet soldiers during World War II.
*** {{Lang|1={{w|Vasily Zaitsev (sniper)|Vasily Grigoryevich Zaitsev}}|ru=Васи́лий Григо́рьевич За́йцев|ru_rm={{#invoke:ru-rm|main|Васи́лий Григо́рьевич За́йцев}}}} was a Soviet sniper, who served during World War II.
*** {{Lang|1={{w|Ivan Sidorenko}}|ru=Иван Сидоренко|ru_rm={{#invoke:ru-rm|main|Иван Сидоренко}}}} was a Red Army officer and a Hero of the Soviet Union, who served during World War II.
*** {{Lang|{{w|Semyon Nomokonov}}|ru=Семён Номоконов|ru_rm={{#invoke:ru-rm|main|Семён Номоконов}}}} was a Soviet sniper during World War II.
** Similarly to the Fairy Knight Twins and the Swords of the Gorge, their subtitles are only seen after one of the three are left remaining, though the name is randomized with each spawn.
* Vasily, Sidorenko and Nomokonov are mentioned in interactables found around the [[Phlogiston Extraction Research Center]], with the implication that they were originally assigned to oversee the area.
