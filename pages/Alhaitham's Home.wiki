==Lore==
Alhaitham's house was given to him by the [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]] due to his part in a joint research project with Kaveh during his student years. Kaveh had initially turned down the house, not needing it, but later became bankrupt and needed somewhere to live. Though Kaveh was also a researcher on the project, he had forfeited his right to the house; thus, Alhaitham collects rent from him, being the landlord.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Alhaitham|4}}</ref>

While working as an architect, Kaveh also does chores around the house. The house's decoration is a point of contention: Kaveh finds Alhaitham's choice in furniture ugly and wants to be consulted before Alhaitham purchases more.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Pride and Prejudice}}</ref>
