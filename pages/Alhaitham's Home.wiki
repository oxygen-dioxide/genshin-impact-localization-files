Alhaitham's home was originally a research center provided to him and Kaveh by the [[Sumeru Akademiya|Akademiya]] for their joint research. It was allocated to the two after it fell into disuse due to the lack of a united vision between the researchers, as well as due to a lack of manpower, and eventually converted into a proper home after Kaveh forfeited his rights to the property. After having sold his home and all his possessions to fund the second construction of [[The Palace of Alcazarzaray]], Kaveh went bankrupt and would spend his time drinking in [[Lambad's Tavern]], where he eventually reunited with Alhaitham and was invited to live with him on the condition that he pay rent. Kaveh would also take on fulfilling all the domestic duties, such as tidying up, after suggesting that he could help out around the house while staying there. Despite essentially being Kaveh's landlord, Alhaitham only ever refers to Kaveh as his "roommate."<ref>{{Ref/CS|Alhaitham|4}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/CS|Kaveh|5}}</ref>

The house's decoration is a point of contention: Kaveh finds Alhaitham's choice in furniture ugly and wants to be consulted before Alhaitham purchases more.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Pride and Prejudice}}</ref> Kaveh has his own room, which he goes into on the rare occasion that Alhaitham has guests. To avoid being discovered living with him, he also avoids answering the door if Alhaitham is not home.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Competition on the Sands}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* In the {{Quest|A Toast to Victory}}, Alhaitham mentions taking both his and Kaveh's house keys by accident. These keys can be seen in Alhaitham's first idle animation, and their appearances reflect their owners' personalities; Alhaitham's is a simple silver key with a green and silver bow, whereas Kaveh's is gold with a gold and green bow, and has a lion-shaped keychain with a brown gear mane attached to a keyring. The lion keychain alludes to Kaveh's darshan, the [[Kshahrewar]], which is represented by a gray lion with a gear mane.
