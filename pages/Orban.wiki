==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Orban:''' What is it?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Orban:''' My name is unimportant, only my work is.
::'''Orban:''' Have you heard of the weapon named [[Cool Steel]]? It's the sword of the adventurer [[Herman]], who was once famed throughout the continent. I forged it for him.
::'''Orban:''' ...Though a number of people praised it quite highly, it was one of my more ordinary forging projects.
::'''Orban:''' For me, the most important weapon is the next one I'm making...
::'''Orban:''' That one alone deserves to be remembered as part of my legacy.
:{{DIcon}} Why are you here?
::'''Orban:''' For a weapon. One that is destined to be remembered by all who hear its name.
::'''Orban:''' You can make as many mundane weapons as you like, and they would all be meaningless. That's the life of a blacksmith, not that of a weaponsmith.
::'''Orban:''' A true forgemaster needs only to build one famous weapon.
::'''Orban:''' I will use my life's worth of skill and sweat to forge that weapon. Once it is complete, all Teyvat will remember it &mdash; and me.
::'''Orban:''' It is for that reason that I am here on this mountain &mdash; for it contains the materials that I have been searching for all this time.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Materials?
:::'''Orban:'''  I've tried forging weapons from all kinds of materials. But each and every one of them has turned out to be completely unexceptional.
:::'''Orban:''' This has led me to understand the limitations of ordinary ores...
:::'''Orban:''' Take this polearm with you. It's just a test piece that I forged once upon a time &mdash; but for the average person, it should make a fine weapon.
::;(Obtain [[Black Tassel]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} Nothing.
::'''Orban:''' If you've got nothing for me, then don't waste my time.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* Orban's name may be a reference to Orbán, a Hungarian iron founder who made superguns used by the Ottomans to break through the Theodosian Walls.
