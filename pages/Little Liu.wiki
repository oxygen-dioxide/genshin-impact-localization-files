==Profile==
Liu is the young daughter of [[Jiayi]]. She lives with her grandparents in Qingce Village. She believes that her parents are both working in Liyue Harbor. However, her mother died while giving birth to her and her father who is scared to tell her the truth is forced to work in Liyue Harbor as a Millelith soldier. One day, Liu runs way from Qingce Village after learning that her father's scheduled visit will be postponed once again. She was frustrated that the gifts she has collected with her friends for her father's arrival has become useless. So she planned to go to Liyue Harbor on her own. She makes it more than halfway to Stone Gate before being attacked by a group of monsters. The [[Traveler]] finds her and saves her from the monsters. She then realizes that she's weak and would probably run into more issues if she continues her journey which could end up worrying her parents. She resolves to get stronger and hopes to someday earn a vision.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Will of Stone}}</ref>

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Little Liu:''' Hey. You look like an adventurer. You got a [[Vision]]?
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Duel
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Little Liu/Duel: Little Liu|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Little Liu:''' Hehe, I won! Even adults will lose when it comes to cards!
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Little Liu:''' Ugh... This one doesn't count! I'll win next time for sure!
:{{DIcon}} No.
::'''Little Liu:''' Aw, that sucks! Nobody remembers the adventurers who don't have Visions.
::'''Little Liu:''' Wanna know why? 'Cause when you get a Vision you get to use elemental power, and you can use that to fight evil and become a legend!
::'''Little Liu:''' That's just scratching the surface; Visions give you loads of advantages. Even the books themselves say, the famous adventurers you read about in books are all Vision bearers.
::'''Little Liu:''' In short, if you ain't got a Vision, you can forget your dreams of becoming a big hero.
::{{DIcon}} I can control the elements though.
:::'''Little Liu:''' Impossible! You're a liar; I've read lots of books about this and I have never come across anyone who doesn't need a Vision to use elemental power.
:::'''Little Liu:''' Don't think I'm gonna fall for your lies just 'cause I'm a kid!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} You can go on adventures without a Vision.
:::'''Little Liu:''' You mean be one of those martial arts heroes? Hmph, no thank you!
:::'''Little Liu:''' After the old folks in the village discovered I had an interest in adventuring, they kept bringing me all these martial arts novels...
:::'''Little Liu:''' But when I read them, I was disappointed to find that the main characters are all ugly stinking men! Sorry, not my kind of story!
:::'''Little Liu:''' You haven't read any before? Here, knock yourself out, they're certainly no use to me!
::;(Obtain {{Item|Records of the Gallant|20|text=Records of the Gallant: The Hermit|type=Book}})
:{{DIcon}} Why are you obsessed with Visions?
::'''Little Liu:''' 'Cause I want one for myself!
::'''Little Liu:''' With a Vision you can get money and status. If I had enough money, mom and dad could come back to the village 'cause they wouldn't need to work in [[Liyue Harbor]] anymore.
::'''Little Liu:''' I told my friends about Visions, and now they all want one too.
:{{DIcon}} Not telling you.
::'''Little Liu:''' Hmph. Fine. Not like I haven't seen one before anyway.
