==Profile==
Liu is the young daughter of [[Jiayi]].

During [[Will of Stone]], Liu runs away from Qingce Village after hearing that, once again, her father must work overtime and can't visit her, while her mother died in childbirth. After collecting some gifts, she resolves to walk to Liyue Harbor herself to see Jiayi. She makes it more than halfway to Stone Gate before being attacked by a group of monsters.

Liu is saved by the Traveler. She tells them that she would probably just run into more issues if she continued her journey and end up causing her father more worry and distress. She resolves to get stronger and hopes to one day possess the Traveler's power.

===Personality===
Liu is obsessed with Visions. After meeting a stranger she will immediately ask them if they possess one, and she tells her friends all about the power of Visions and even convinces many of them into wanting one.

Liu's obsession with Visions stems from a desire to get stronger and become someone who can make money and support her father. Jiayi works tirelessly in Liyue Harbor and is unable to spare even a moment to visit Liu in Qingce Village. Liu wants a Vision so that she can become stronger, make money as an adventurer, and be with her father.

===Appearance===
She has red hair pulled back in two braids and dark eyes.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Little Liu:''' Hey. You look like an adventurer; you got a [[Vision]]?
:{{DIcon}} No.
::'''Little Liu:''' Aw, that sucks! Nobody remembers the adventurers who don't have Visions.
::'''Little Liu:''' Wanna know why? 'Cause when you get a Vision you get to use elemental power, and you can use that to fight evil and become a legend!
::'''Little Liu:''' That's just scratching the surface; Visions give you loads of advantages. Even the books themselves say, the famous adventurers you read about in books are all Vision bearers.
::'''Little Liu:''' In short. if you ain't got a Vision, you can forget your dreams of becoming a big hero.
::{{DIcon}} I can control the elements though.
:::'''Little Liu:''' Impossible! You're a liar; I've read lots of books about this and I have never come across anyone who doesn't need a Vision to use elemental power.
:::'''Little Liu:''' Don't think I'm gonna fall for your lies just 'cause I'm a kid!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} You can go on adventures without a Vision.
:::'''Little Liu:''' You mean be one of those martial arts heroes? Hmph, no thank you!
:::'''Little Liu:''' After the old folks in the village discovered I had an interest in adventuring, they kept bringing me all these martial arts novels...
:::'''Little Liu:''' But when I read them, I was disappointed to find that the main characters are all ugly stinking men! Sorry, not my kind of story!
:::'''Little Liu:''' You haven't read any before? Here, knock yourself out, they're certainly no use to me!
::;(Obtain [[Records of the Gallant: The Hermit]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} Why are you obsessed with Visions?
::'''Little Liu:''' 'Cause I want one for myself!
::'''Little Liu:''' With a Vision you can get money and status. If I had enough money, mom and dad could come back to the village 'cause they wouldn't need to work in [[Liyue Harbor]] anymore.
::'''Little Liu:''' I told my friends about Visions, and now they all want one too.
:{{DIcon}} Not telling you.
::'''Little Liu:''' Hmph. Fine. Not like I haven't seen one before anyway.
