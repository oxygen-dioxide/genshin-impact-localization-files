==Full Description==
"My ideals have no stains."<br>
I must correct you. People here bear no sins in the eyes of the gods... Only laws and the Tribunal can judge someone."<br>
They can judge even me. So praise my magnificence and purity."

==Trivia==
* <section begin="VarunadaQuote" />The Varunada Lazurite quote aligns with the events of the {{Quest|Masquerade of the Guilty}}.
** The Chinese version of "People here bear no sins in the eyes of the gods" is better translated as "People here bear no sins against the gods." This can be interpreted as the narrator believing that Fontainians have not done anything to offend [[Celestia]].
** "They can judge even me" likely refers to the [[Oratrice]]'s death sentence against [[Focalors]] and her Divine Throne.<section end="VarunadaQuote" />

===Etymology===
* The English name for this item derives "Varunada" from {{w|Varuna}}, a Vedic deity associated with the sky, seas, justice, and truth. In the Hindu Puranas, he is the god of oceans.
* In the Chinese version, "Varunada" is instead {{zh|s=涤净|t=滌淨|rm=Díjìng|tl=Cleansing, Purging.}}
