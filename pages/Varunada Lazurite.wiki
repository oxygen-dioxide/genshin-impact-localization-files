==Trivia==

**The Chinese version of "People here bear no sins in the eyes of the gods" is better translated as "People here bear no sins against the gods." She is saying that her people have not done anything to offend the gods in [[Celestia]], linking back to her fear of them as indicated by [[Dainsleif]].
