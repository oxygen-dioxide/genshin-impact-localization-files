'''Nirodha Fruit''' is an [[Exploration]] mechanic found in the [[Girdle of the Sands]], [[Sumeru]]. 

When [[Sorush (Gadget)|Sorush]] interacts with a Nirodha Fruit, she gains an additional ability that allows her to drop fruit bombs. This ability can be activated in the same manner as an '''Elemental Burst'''. The bombs can destroy solidified [[Amrita]], mine [[Mineral|ore]], and deal damage to shields, but cannot damage [[Enemy|Enemies]] or [[Wildlife]]. Sorush can only drop bombs on targets directly below her.

When Sorush harvests a Nirodha Fruit, her bomb gauge will be filled to a maximum of 80 points. Each bomb costs 10 points. When the gauge is depleted, the ability will be removed. Exiting Sorush mode will also remove this ability. A harvested Nirodha Fruit will respawn in about 10s.

==Locations==
Nirodha Fruit can be found growing on cliffs in the Girdle of the Sands.
