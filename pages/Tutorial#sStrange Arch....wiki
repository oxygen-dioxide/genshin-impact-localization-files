|text1    = These strange arches are known as [[Phantasmal Gate]]s. Complete the challenges within, and perhaps something good will happen.<br />Play [[Arana]]'s song on the [[Vintage Lyre]] in front of a Phantasmal Gate to awaken it. After this, enter the arch to undertake the challenges.

|text2    = During a challenge, you must collect all the Phantasmal Seeds and return to the Phantasmal Gate within the time limit. If you are hit by attacks from opponents during this time, the time allotted to you for the challenge will decrease...

|text3    = After you have entered the Phantasmal Gate, certain special [[Dream Flower]]s will appear. Standing within the barrier that these flowers project will cause opponents to forget your existence and allow you to exit combat. Additionally, activating these Dream Flowers with {{Color|help|Electro}} will allow them to mark the location of the remaining Phantasmal Seeds for you, but this will also undo the effect of the barrier.
