==Trivia==
* Kaveh's Hangout Event is the second after [[Layla]]'s [[Ever Silent Stars]] to introduce a slightly different gameplay mode:
** Similarly to Layla's Hangout Event, Kaveh's icon replaces the Travelers next to the Heartbeat Value, suggesting that the Value reflects his mental state throughout the quest. This is indicated by the fact that Kaveh can gain and lose hearts by interacting with characters other than the [[Traveler]] throughout the quest; for example, he loses all three of his hearts during his confrontation with [[Badawi]] at the start of the Story Quest, forcing the player to begin the quest with zero hearts. Kaveh also occasionally gains and loses hearts based on his own independent reactions to things.
*** Kaveh's Heartbeat Value has no effect on the ending the player receives based on the path they choose in the Story Quest.
