|description  = Use this traditional instrument from Mondstadt to play songs. An instrument of incredible workmanship, it will surely produce moving music when played by able hands.<br />Mondstadt has a long-standing tradition of poetry and song, and thus also boasts a long history of constructing instruments to that effect. Bards are most proud of their songs and poems, and perhaps the instruments, too, would be proud of their owners and their musical tradition.

The '''Windsong Lyre''' is a [[gadget]] that can be obtained during the [[Invitation of Windblume]] event. It can be bought from the event shop for 280 [[Festive Tour Ticket]]s after completing all "[[Ballads of Breeze]]" challenges in Normal Mode.

It can also be bought from [[Marjorie]] in [[Mondstadt]] for {{Item|Mora|20|x=150,000}} if players missed the event.

The lyre has a {{w|Range (music)|range}} from C3 to B5 and does not have sharp or flat notes.
Notes are labeled with {{w|solfège}} syllables rather than note names, with C as ''do''. Multiple notes can be played simultaneously, but notes cannot be held, as expected of a plucked instrument.

==Usage==
The lyre can be played on PC using either the keyboard or the mouse. On the keyboard, the top row of notes (treble clef, 𝄞) are mapped to the letters {{key|Q}} to {{key|U}}, the middle row (alto clef, 𝄡) from {{key|A}} to {{key|J}}, and the bottom row (bass clef, 𝄢) from {{key|Z}} to {{key|M}}.

With a PlayStation controller, the notes from "do" to "ti" are mapped onto the left, up, right, down, {{key|ps-s}}, {{key|ps-t}}, and {{key|ps-c}} buttons, respectively. The alto clef notes (the middle row on PC and mobile) are displayed by default, and the {{key|ps-l1}} and {{key|ps-r1}} buttons need to be held to access the lower and higher keys, respectively.

==Disclaimer==
There is a disclaimer in-game regarding the use of the lyre:
:When using the Performance function, please make sure that you use an original composition or have the relevant rights to use the melody you are playing in order to avoid harming the rights of any third parties and to avoid any actions in breach of or incompatible with our Terms of Service.
