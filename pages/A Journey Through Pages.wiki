'''A Journey Through Pages''' is a [[Web Event]] in [[Version 2.8]].

==Event Duration==
August 17, 2022 – August 23, 2022 23:59 (UTC+8)
* Rewards cannot be claimed after the event ends. Please claim them in time.

==Eligibility==
Travelers who have reached Adventure Rank 10 or above can participate in this event.

==Event Description==
During the event, you can log in to Genshin Impact every day and complete Daily Commissions, consume Original Resin, and other missions to obtain Activity Points. Accumulated Activity Points can earn you Encounter Pieces, which can be pieced together in the gameplay interface to continuously expand the map. Travelers can switch to Exploration mode to unlock various encounters on the map and interact with them. Accumulate unlocked Encounter Records to receive rewards such as Primogems.

==Obtaining Encounter Pieces==
For every 50 Activity Points, you can unlock one Encounter Piece. There are seven Pieces waiting for Travelers to unlock!<br>
Travelers can obtain Activity Points through the following methods:
# Complete the following actions in Genshin Impact every day such as: log into Genshin Impact every day, complete two Daily Commissions, and consume 40 Original Resin.
# Complete the following actions on the website such as: logging into the web event daily, etc.
* Daily missions refresh daily at 04:00 (Server Time).
* Activity Points need to be collected manually in the event page. Activity Points that have not been collected will also be reset when daily missions are refreshed the next day. So, remember to collect them!

==Unlocking Encounter Records==
# After unlocking the Encounter Pieces, Travelers can put together and rotate them in the gameplay page. When placing them, you can observe the color of the piece's ground more often, which will help to place them in the correct position!
# You can also switch to Exploration Mode to trigger encounters and collect Encounter Records. Accumulate and unlock encounters to get Primogems and other rewards.
# On each piece, (except for the initial piece), there is one fixed encounter that you can explore after placing it.
# When a particular border of two pieces is spliced together, an additional special encounter is triggered, out of a total of four such special encounters. (Once triggered, special encounters are fixed on the map only after interaction and unlocking in Exploration Mode. If you haven't already interacted with the encounter in Exploration Mode, you can take the two pieces apart and the special encounter will disappear.)
# When all nine pieces are placed correctly, an additional special encounter will also be triggered. So, there are 13 encounters in total for the event waiting to be explored!
* For more details on how to play, please check the "Gameplay Details" pop-up window on the page.
