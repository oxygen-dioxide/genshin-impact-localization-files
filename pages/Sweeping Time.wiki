{{Description|Sometimes, it's not just dust that needs sweeping...}}
'''Sweeping Time''' is [[Noelle]]'s [[Elemental Burst]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* The DEF converted to ATK is additive with Noelle's ATK.
* Elemental Burst DMG% and Skill DMG% describe the damage of the initial small explosion (Burst DMG%) and swing (Skill DMG%) when Sweeping Time is activated.
* Elemental Burst DMG% bonus will apply to both the Burst and the Skill's damage, while Normal/Charged/Plunge Attack DMG% bonuses will apply to the Normal/Charged/Plunge attacks performed afterwards, during the skill's duration.
* Sweeping Time is not deactivated if Noelle is swapped to another character. However, its duration will still continue to tick down while Noelle is off-field.

* {{TalentNote|constellation|6|Must Be Spotless|The ATK Bonus is increased to include an additional 50% of Noelle's DEF, and every enemy that Noelle defeats during Sweeping Time adds 1 second to the duration, up to a maximum of 10 seconds for 10 enemies defeated.}}
