{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Kun)
:'''Kun:''' These items are really hard to find...
:{{DIcon}} Is something wrong?
:'''Kun:''' Oh, it's you. Do you still remember the affair with the Jade Chamber? Baiwen came over some days ago, saying that a schedule's already been drawn up for its reconstruction.
:'''Kun:''' While it's impossible to finish the building so quickly, there are some small matters that can be prepared beforehand.
:'''Kun:''' She gave me a checklist and told me to look through the items and see what I can easily get hold of, but also that I needn't go out of my way to get them all.
:'''Kun:''' To be honest, though, I couldn't leave my post even if I wanted to. The Ministry of Civil Affairs is getting busier by the day, so I really don't know...
:'''Kun:''' It would be great if you had the time to help me make the trip. Baiwen did look like she was rather anxious for this to get done...
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
::'''Kun:''' Thanks for the help.
:{{DIcon}} You're really rebuilding the Jade Chamber?
::'''Kun:''' I've heard Baiwen say that the schedule's already been sent out. But given how large that building is, I think that it will take some time to rebuild it...
::'''Kun:''' They're just preparing some small items at the moment. Things will really get busy once they officially start the rebuilding process.
:'''Kun:''' Let me see... Hmm, they first want a book called "Meadow of Gems," and some small bamboo ornaments.
:'''Kun:''' You can ask Jifang about the book. As for the bamboo ornaments, I believe that [[Master Lu]] of [[Fanmu Carpenter]]'s makes them.
:'''Kun:''' I'm sorry, but I'll have to leave this matter in your hands. Hmm, but it would indeed be good if the Jade Chamber could be rebuilt...
----
;(Talk to Jifang)
:'''Jifang:''' Hi. Would you like to buy anything?
:{{DIcon}} We'd like a copy of "Meadow of Gems."
:'''Jifang:''' "Meadow of Gems"? We don't have it in stock here. Do you need it in a hurry?
:{{DIcon}} Well, they're rebuilding the Jade Chamber...
:'''Jifang:''' Are they really? Well, that would require proper preparation, yes. Let me think...
:'''Jifang:''' Perhaps you can look for Qingzhou instead. He is extremely well-read &mdash; perhaps he might know where a copy of "Meadow of Gems" might be found.
:{{DIcon}} Got it.
:'''Jifang:''' If my memory serves, Qingzhou often lodges at the Wangshu Inn. You can try looking for him there.
----
;(Talk to Qingzhou)
:'''Qingzhou:''' A conundrum. Most vexing, indeed...
:{{DIcon}} So, uh, do you know anything about the "Meadow of Gems"?
:'''Qingzhou:''' The "Meadow of Gems," you say? Yes, I do recall that book.
:'''Qingzhou:''' I once went hither and thither in search of material with which to write a poem about merchants and happened upon this book in the process.
:'''Qingzhou:''' I did not fully comprehend the book's contents, but some of its anecdotes proved most inspirational nonetheless.
:'''Qingzhou:''' Let me try to recall the name of that poem. Pray, give me a moment...
:{{DIcon}} Do you remember where I can find that book?
:'''Qingzhou:''' As, so you wish to locate that book? I must confess that no such place comes to mind...
:'''Qingzhou:''' However, if you need it urgently, I could just write you out a copy of it myself.
:{{DIcon}} Write it out?
:{{DIcon}} From memory?
:'''Qingzhou:''' Ah, it was hardly a lengthy text. Memorizing it was no tall order.
:'''Qingzhou:''' More to the point, the book collector wouldn't let me loan it out.
:'''Qingzhou:''' And since poetry is not something that one can rush, I decided I'd simply write out a copy for my continued perusal... The book's contents were not very long, either, so I have it more or less memorized now.
:{{DIcon}} That's seriously impressive work...
:'''Qingzhou:''' Ah, it is but a trifling matter, my liege. Still, perhaps you could do me a favor in exchange for the hand-written text.
:'''Qingzhou:''' As embarrassing as this is... I have been so focused on gathering inspiration here that only now do I realize: I have completely forgotten to eat today. Suddenly, I feel rather ravenous.
:'''Qingzhou:''' Could you help me get a serving of Triple-Layered Consommé? In exchange, I shall write you a copy of "Meadow of Gems."
:'''Qingzhou:''' I believe that I should just about be done by the time you return.

;(Talk to Qingzhou again)
:'''Qingzhou:''' The "Meadow of Gems," how does it start... Ah yes, "Commerce and trade, like springs and streams, begin with the mountains and end with the seas..."
----
;(Talk to Qingzhou)
:'''Qingzhou:''' "This grand plan charts the course that will lead us, slowly but surely, to Liyue's longevity and the people's prosperity."
:'''Qingzhou:''' Ah, you've returned. One moment, I am still penning the last few lines...
:'''Qingzhou:''' Hmm... There. That should do it.
:{{DIcon}} Here's your Triple-Layered Consommé...
:'''Qingzhou:''' Ah! That can wait, though &mdash; first, please see if the book is to your satisfaction. I trust that you will find my penmanship to be quite satisfactory.
:{{DIcon}} This is seriously impressive work...
:'''Qingzhou:''' Hahaha, you praise me excessively, my liege. This book is for you. Don't lose it, now.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Meadow of Gems}})

;(Talk to Qingzhou again)
:'''Qingzhou:''' "There are those who lose their jobs and have no reliable source of food, nor a roof over their heads, they toil in vain in their barren fields. All the while, the wealthy merchants' residences overflow with gold and jade. What justice and uprightness is this?"
:'''Qingzhou:''' Though this passage still speaks of the mercantile way, it reveals quite a fair amount more meaning upon closer reading...
----
;(Talk to Master Lu)
:'''Master Lu:''' Hmm? Do you need anything?
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to order some small ornaments made of bamboo...
:'''Master Lu:''' Small bamboo ornaments, you say? I could do it, but may I know where this order is coming from?
:{{DIcon}} It's from this checklist of Baiwen's...
:'''Master Lu:''' Oho... an order from Yuehai Pavilion, is it? Well then, I suppose I should complete it as quickly as I can, then.
:'''Master Lu:''' There is one problem, though: the bamboo forest that I frequently gather materials from has suddenly become occupied by a great many boars, for reasons unknown to me.
:'''Master Lu:''' Though it is not much of a problem, I often have to go around them to collect bamboo...
:'''Master Lu:''' If you could chase those boars out, I can go and collect some bamboo now, and we can begin work right away.
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
:'''Master Lu:''' I shall wait for you here, then. Once you have chased those boars out, come back and give me a shout.
;(Talk to Master Lu again)
:'''Master Lu:''' Hmm, small bamboo ornaments...
----
;(Approach the boars)
:'''Paimon:''' There are so many boars here... Let's send them all packing!
;(After the first few boars are gone)
:'''Paimon:''' More boars over here, time to shoo them off!
;(After all the boars are gone)
:'''Paimon:''' Well, that should be all of them. Let's go back to Master Lu.
----
:'''Master Lu:''' So, have you chased those boars away?
:{{DIcon}} All of 'em.
:'''Master Lu:''' That will do. I shall head over to collect bamboo in a while. Once the ornaments are ready, I shall have them delivered directly to Yuehai Pavilion.
:'''Master Lu:''' This order is quite large. There's quite the sum to be made here...
;(After cutscene ends)
:'''Paimon:''' Well, that's that settled. Let's head back to Yuehai Pavilion and inform Baiwen &mdash; and let's pass her this book in the meantime, shall we?
;(Talk to Master Lu again)
:'''Master Lu:''' Hmm, small bamboo ornaments...
----
;(Talk to Baiwen)
:'''Baiwen:''' Hello, can I help you?
:{{DIcon}} So, about those preparations you've been making...
:'''Baiwen:''' This is... the "Meadow of Gems"? Where did you get this book? I've searched high and low throughout Liyue, and I couldn't find it even so...
:{{DIcon}} Qingzhou hand-wrote a copy for me.
:'''Baiwen:''' That poet? Hmm, it seems that his reputation is well-founded...
:'''Baiwen:''' Thank you for your help in preparing these objects. Once Master Lu sends those ornaments over, I will also arrange for him to receive appropriate compensation.
:{{DIcon}} So, you're rebuilding the Jade Chamber, huh...
:'''Baiwen:''' Indeed, we do have plans to do so. But with the number of things we will need to prepare, there is still much work to be done. I doubt that we can finish rebuilding it quickly.
:'''Baiwen:''' Not to mention our biggest material headache, which we have yet to find a solution to...
:'''Baiwen:''' Never mind, I shall not speak of it. Thanks for your help once again &mdash; and please, accept these for your aid. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must return to my work.

;(Talk to Kun)
:'''Kun:''' These items are really hard to find...
:{{DIcon}} Something the matter over there?
:'''Kun:''' Oh, it's you. Well, you must know that the Jade Chamber has finally been rebuilt, right?
:'''Kun:''' I never thought that such a huge place could be rebuilt just like that...
:'''Kun:''' Baiwen came looking for me several days ago, asking me to prepare a few items to help redecorate the Jade Chamber's interior.
:'''Kun:''' Look, she even passed me a checklist and all, telling me to keep the various items recorded there in mind.
:'''Kun:''' I'll be honest with you, though, My work at the Ministry of Civil Affairs has been getting more hectic by the day. There's just no time to help her...
:'''Kun:''' Could you help me make the trip to find these items, Traveler? Baiwen did look like she was rather anxious for this to get done.
:{{DIcon}} Consider it done.
:'''Kun:''' Thank you!
:'''Kun:''' Let me see... Hmm, they first want a book called "Meadow of Gems," and some small bamboo ornaments.
:'''Kun:''' They're just preparing some small items at the moment. Things will really get busy once they officially start the rebuilding process.

==Trivia==
* It is likely that the material Baiwen says "will be a headache to get" is [[Plaustrite]], a greenish mineral with anti-gravity properties that allows for floating platforms. It is stated during the 2021 [[Lantern Rite]] festival that the shard by the Skybracer sculpture is the largest they've had in 20 years (and it is only a fraction of the size of the Jade Chamber), indicating that Plaustrite is a rare and expensive material, and for the Jade Chamber to float, it will need a large amount.
