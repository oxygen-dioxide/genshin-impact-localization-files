{{Description|A soldier encased within a Fatui war machine.<br />These skirmishers do not question if they shall live or die as they advance into nations far from home to complete advance missions and lay the groundwork for operations to come.<br />Unlike the elite [[Fatui Cicin Mages|Mages]] and [[Fatui Agents|Agents]], Fatui Skirmishers are soldiers of lesser individual might.<br />To complete their tasks and reduce losses in men and material, their tactics are thus more reliant on teamwork.}}
'''Fatui Skirmishers''' are combatants and foot soldiers of the [[Fatui]] that are located in multiple locations across [[Teyvat]].

==Types==
All the skirmishers can generate shields.

===Bracers===
The Bracers will sometimes jump back from the player to deal ranged attacks.
*{{Enemy|Fatui Skirmisher - Geochanter Bracer|text=Geochanter Bracers}}: Shoots out {{Color|Geo projectiles}} and can generate {{Color|Geo Elemental Armor}} (weak to [[Blunt Attack]]s), can also generate a {{Geo}} dome field.
*{{Enemy|Fatui Skirmisher - Pyroslinger Bracer|text=Pyroslinger Bracers}}: Shoots out {{Color|Pyro bullets}} and can generate {{Color|Pyro Elemental Armor}} (weak to {{Hydro}})

===Legionnaires===
Legionnaries can jump in the air and can do ranged attacks.
*{{Enemy|Fatui Skirmisher - Cryogunner Legionnaire|text=Cryogunner Legionnaires}}: Shoots a continuous spray of {{Cryo}}, can generate {{Color|Cryo Elemental Armor}} (weak to {{Pyro}})
*{{Enemy|Fatui Skirmisher - Hydrogunner Legionnaire|text=Hydrogunner Legionnaires}}: Shoots {{Color|Hydro projectiles}} that can heal allies and damage the player, can generate {{Color|Hydro Elemental Armor}} (weak to {{Electro}})

===Vanguards===
The Vanguards are close-quarter combatants.
*{{Enemy|Fatui Skirmisher - Anemoboxer Vanguard|text=Anemoboxer Vanguards}}: Can generate an {{Color|Anemo shield}} which can absorb elements. They can also recuperate dazed Skirmishers, allowing them to re-activate their Elemental Armor almost immediately.
*{{Enemy|Fatui Skirmisher - Electrohammer Vanguard|text=Electrohammer Vanguards}}: Swings their hammer to deal damage and can generate {{Color|Electro Elemental Armor}} (weak to {{Cryo}})

==Elemental Armor==
{{See also|Gauge Unit Theory|Shields/Enemy}}
In general, the elemental armor generated by Fatui Skirmishers can be broken using elemental reactions. Each type of elemental armor has a particular elemental weakness, but elemental reactions caused by other elements still deal a small amount of damage to the armor. All Skirmisher Armor except the Geochanter Bracer's use a unique reaction cost coefficient. Compared to other shields, there is a large difference between the gauges required from the most effective element and the gauges required from other elements.

==Strategy==
This describes a general strategy against groups of skirmishers. For strategies against individual skirmishers see their respective pages.

Skirmishers in general are often seen in groups of two or three, although occasionally a few might just wander about alone; rarely four or more will be found close together. Skirmishers are fairly weak when their armor is not imbued and they do not usually apply the effects immediately, often waiting around 10 seconds to do so. They will prioritize generating a shield if their health falls below 50%.

Hydrogunner Legionnaires should take first priority, as they are able to provide healing for their allies, which is further strengthened if they imbue themselves, not to mention that without an {{Electro}} character, taking them out becomes far more tedious. Anemoboxer Vanguards are the second-highest priority; they have a tendency to cover their allies and create [[displacement]] effects if their shield takes an elemental reaction, making the player easier to hit if allies are around. They also recover their fellow Skirmishers, more often than not causing them to immediately reapply their shields.

If the present two skirmishers are not present or killed, then the player should focus on Cryogunner Legionnaires and Electrohammer Vanguards. Cryogunners, while slow, deal more consistent damage if the player is unable to escape their guns, which is particularly the case if wet, as players will find themselves continually stuck in a [[Frozen]] state due to their rapid hits. Electrohammers deal more damage than the other skirmishers and can leave the player open to the more dangerous [[Overloaded]] or [[Superconduct]] reactions if a Pyroslinger Bracer or Cryogunner Legionnaire is present.

Bracers should take the lowest priority, as their attacks are fairly easy to dodge, attack far slower than the other Skirmishers and even when imbued, aren't much of a threat in the first place.

While possible to stagger a Skirmisher while they are in the process of creating their Elemental Armor, this is usually discouraged because their resistance values are significantly higher than normal when they do so. Bracers and the Anemoboxer Vanguard have less weight compared to the Legionnaires and the Electrohammer Vanguard, making the former susceptible to displacement and fall damage and the latter simply stumbling.

==Notable Fatui Skirmishers==
The following Fatui Skirmishers are featured in [[quests]]:
* [[Anton]] &mdash; An Anemoboxer Vanguard and the Staff Sergeant of the Ninth Company, sent to [[The Chasm]] in a joint operation with the [[Liyue Qixing]] to help deal with the [[Dark Mud]]. After being stranded in the Underground Mines, Anton leads a small group of followers and eventually persuades the [[Traveler]] to help them. Appears in ''[[A Company Vanishing Into the Deep]]''.
* [[Borenka]] &mdash; An Electrohammer Vanguard and a naval intelligence officer sent to [[Inazuma]] to follow up on [[Nathan]]'s work. Appears in ''[[Clean House]]''.
* Corporal Mashkov &mdash; An Electrohammer Vanguard in the Ninth Company who attacks Anton's group to take the food the Traveler gave them for his own group. Appears in ''A Company Vanishing Into the Deep''.
* [[Danila]] &mdash; A Geochanter Bracer in the Ninth Company who is part of Anton's group. Appears in ''A Company Vanishing Into the Deep''.
* [[Ilyin]] &mdash; A Pyroslinger Bracer and one of [[Efim Snezhevich]]'s subordinates. Appears in ''[[Where the Dandelions Find Rest]]''. (Despite being a Pyroslinger Bracer in dialogue cutscenes, he is fought as a [[Fatui Pyro Agent]].)
* [[Pavel (Where the Dandelions Find Rest)|Pavel]] &mdash; An Electrohammer Vanguard and one of Efim Snezhevich's subordinates. Appears in ''Where the Dandelions Find Rest''.
* [[Radomir]] &mdash; A Hydrogunner Legionnaire in the Ninth Company who is part of Anton's group. Appears in ''A Company Vanishing Into the Deep''.
* [[Temur]] &mdash; A Pyroslinger Bracer in the Ninth Company who is part of Anton's group. Appears in ''A Company Vanishing Into the Deep''.
* Unnamed Cryogunner Legionnaire &mdash; A Fatuus who was mistaken for raiding [[Master Lu]]'s warehouse, and subsequently attacked by [[Ganyu]] and the Traveler, when he was simply trying to pick [[Berry|berries]] near [[Qingce Village]]. Appears in ''[[A Secretary in a Sea of Humanity]]''.
* Vitaly &mdash; An Electrohammer Vanguard who spontaneously joins the fight over [[Saimon Jirou]], with the title of "Too Long a Pencil Pusher." Appears in ''[[The Farmer's Treasure]]''.

==Trivia==
*Bracers can summon their rifles or staffs on hand when they engage the Traveler in combat, much like how player characters do. The same principle applies to the other Skirmishers as well.
*Unlike Agents and Cicin Mages, Skirmishers don't carry a Delusion; instead their weapons have the ability to channel their respective elements.
*As a side effect of Dottore's enhancements, all Skirmishers have silver/gray hair.
*Vanguards wear Officer Caps instead of Fedoras.
*Along with the [[Kairagi]], the Fatui Vanguards and Legionnaires are the largest human enemies in-game so far.
*In a cutscene that introduces Eula, an Electrohammer Vanguard that the Traveler took down disappear in red particles instead of blue.
*Bracers can be seen without their weapons, where they will do a salute idle animation. Cryogunner Legionnaires can be seen eating meat. Hydrogunner Legionnaires will periodically scratch their stomach. Vanguards will flex their muscles with other Vanguards.
