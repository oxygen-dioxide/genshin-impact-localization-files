==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}

;(Examine the statues)
:'''Examine Statue:''' (A bizarre-looking statue that appears to be made of salt)

;(You encounter towering white figures in the ruin...)
:{{A|vo zllq004 1 wanyan 01.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' A&mdash;Are these... statues?
:{{A|vo zllq004 1 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' No. These are people.
:{{A|vo zllq004 1 kliment 01.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' Urgh...
:{{A|vo zllq004 1 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' They were probably followers of the God of Salt.
:{{A|vo zllq004 1 kliment 02.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' How did they become this way...?
:{{A|vo zllq004 1 wanyan 02.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' What in the world is hidden deep in this ruin...?

----

;(Explore further and look for divine relics)
:'''Examine Salinized Adherent:''' (He is transfixed in an earnest posture... No, perhaps he was also... afraid?)

;(You find a strange chalice on an altar...)
:{{A|vo zllq004 2 wanyan 01.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Look at this. It's filled halfway with salt.
:{{A|vo zllq004 2 kliment 01.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' Just looks like a fancy salt holder. Seems like the God of Salt was a god lacking in treasures.
:{{A|vo zllq004 2 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' According to my knowledge, it's no ordinary vessel. Although it is only half-full, it is also forever half-full &mdash; that is to say, it is bottomless.
:{{A|vo zllq004 2 kliment 02.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' What!? You're saying that even if I pour the salt out, the amount inside won't change!?
:{{A|vo zllq004 2 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Exactly.
:{{A|vo zllq004 2 wanyan 02.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Able to produce endless salt... The God of Salt is powerful indeed!
:{{A|vo zllq004 2 kliment 03.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' Finally, after all that effort, I've found precious treasure! I claim this as mine!
:{{A|vo zllq004 2 kliment 04.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' I just need to pour the endless salt into a thousand, or ten-thousand bags... I can sell it and make a fortune!
:{{A|vo zllq004 2 wanyan 03.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Hey! How can you use a relic of the God of Salt for such a shallow pursuit!?
:{{A|vo zllq004 2 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' If Mr. Kliment wants this salt chalice, then the next object we find will belong to Miss Wanyan, according to the contract agreed upon.
:{{A|vo zllq004 2 kliment 05.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' Of course, as we agreed. Hehe, but how can anything be worth more than this rare find?
:{{A|vo zllq004 2 wanyan 04.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Since we have a contract, it's no use for me to fight with him...
:{{A|vo zllq004 2 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Then let's move on, shall we?

----

;(You discover a strange ruler on a separate altar...)
:{{A|vo zllq004 3 kliment 01.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' Ha, just a simple ruler. Doesn't look to be worth anything.
:{{A|vo zllq004 3 wanyan 01.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' This... If I remember correctly, this is some kind of measuring tool.
:{{A|vo zllq004 3 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Indeed. But the God of Salt imbued it with another power.
:{{A|vo zllq004 3 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' When you stick this ruler in the ground, the surrounding area will become covered in salt, much like a rising tide covers the earth.
:{{A|vo zllq004 3 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The deeper it is stuck in the ground, the more salt will appear. It is essentially a "bumper harvest" of salt.
:{{A|vo zllq004 3 kliment 02.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' Th&mdash;That's even better than the salt chalice!
:{{A|vo zllq004 3 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Well then, according to our contract, the salt ruler goes to Miss Wanyan.
:{{A|vo zllq004 3 kliment 03.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' No! Unacceptable! I paid for and organized this entire expedition. Why should I get the short end of the stick!
:{{A|vo zllq004 3 kliment 04.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' And this girl has been useless. Why should she get anything!?
:{{A|vo zllq004 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh boy, here we go again...
:{{DIcon}} *sigh*
:{{DIcon}} While we're on the topic of "useless" people...
:{{A|vo zllq004 3 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' So you are saying, you want to break the contract?
:{{A|vo zllq004 3 kliment 05.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' So what if I break it? Now that I've seen how the mechanisms in this ruin work, I no longer need you.
:{{A|vo zllq004 3 kliment 06.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' Let's not forget who hired who here. Why should I let you make the rules?
:{{A|vo zllq004 3 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Because you agreed to a contract.
:{{A|vo zllq004 3 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Rex Lapis once said: "Ones who break their contracts shall suffer the Wrath of the Rock."
:{{A|vo zllq004 3 kliment 07.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' That is one of your Liyue gods. I am from Snezhnaya, I&mdash;
:{{A|vo zllq004 3 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' &mdash;Will "suffer the Wrath of the Rock" &mdash; you may find it rather unpleasant.

:;(A battle ensues between you and Kliment, a Fatui Pyro Agent)

----

;(Punish Kliment)
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I shall confiscate your treasure as well.
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' You are not worthy to continue any further into the ruin. Leave this place.
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 kliment 01.ogg}} '''Kliment:''' Darn you... Just you wait!

;(Talk to Zhongli and Wanyan)
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Some "archaeological survey..." He could only pretend for so long.
:{{DIcon}} At least we had our guard up.
::{{A|vo zllq004 4 paimon 02a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, good thing Paimon can smell a liar from a mile away.
:{{DIcon}} I hope you never become as greedy as him, Paimon.
::{{A|vo zllq004 4 paimon 02b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Paimon likes Mora, but Paimon doesn't do bad things!
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Kliment's wrongdoing stemmed from greed, yes. But besides greed, there are many other things that may tempt us to break contracts.
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' When people see the object of their dreams, how many are really able to control their desire and follow the contract...?
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I think we should be honest with each other now.
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Be honest about what?
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' That in truth, not a single member of this "archaeological expedition" came here for archaeology.
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 wanyan 01.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Wh&mdash;Why do you say that?
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Miss, you lack even the most basic archaeological knowledge and can recognize naught but a few simple relics. However, you are an expert when it comes to anything regarding the God of Salt.
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' You aren't interested in archaeology or relics &mdash; what you're really interested in is the God of Salt.
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I believe those legends about the God of Salt that you mentioned on the [[Pearl Galley]] are passed down between generations at [[Yinyuan Hall]]...
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 wanyan 02.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Okay, that's enough!
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 wanyan 03.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' ...Sir, you are indeed a man of great knowledge and talents. I seem to have been right to seek you out, once I plucked up my courage.
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 wanyan 04.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' You're right. I'm not a scholar of archaeology. I come from one of the [[Eight Trades]] under the jurisdiction of the Qixing &mdash; Yinyuan Hall of the salt industry.
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 wanyan 05.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Our ancestors were those protected by the God of Salt all those years, when the Archon War engulfed the land in chaos.
:{{DIcon}} Come to think of it, I've never heard you say "Rex Lapis"...
:{{DIcon}} Hmm, I've never heard you say "Lord of Geo"...
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh right. Now that you mention it, the people of Liyue very seldom use the name "Morax"...
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 wanyan 06.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' During the war, Morax assassinated our god out of envy for her power! He left us alone and lost in the world.
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 wanyan 07.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' We... We hate him! But this is Morax's Liyue, after all, and its history is written as he wishes...
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 wanyan 08.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' So, I seek proof of Morax's guilt! He has blood on his hands, and cruelty in his heart!
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' ...
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 wanyan 09.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' We agreed to a contract that we will face the truth head-on, didn't we Mr. Zhongli!? You must judge this history fairly!
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Naturally, of course. But I must add, Liyue is no longer Morax's Liyue.
:{{A|vo zllq004 4 zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Come with me. All the answers you seek lie ahead.

----

;(Examine the broken sword)
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 wanyan 01.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' This is... a sword?
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 wanyan 02.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Aha! It's a broken sword, this is proof! This proves that the God of Salt had to fight back, fight back against the evil Morax! But sadly, she was defeated...
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 wanyan 03.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' The power of this sword surely is much greater than that of the salt chalice and salt ruler!
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 wanyan 04.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' If we can repair this sword, then we can show the world the mighty power of the God of Salt...
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... It does look like something left behind after being defeated in battle.
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Two pieces of a broken sword. From an archaeological perspective, these are two separate relics. According to the contract, you can only claim one.
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 wanyan 05.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Wh&mdash;Why? We were alternating claims to treasure, true, but Kliment is no longer here...
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Yes, but the "only one object per claim" clause still holds true. You cannot take two relics at the same time.
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 wanyan 06.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Th&mdash;This logic...
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Erm... Zhongli, she seems like a good person, and no one is fighting over treasure. How about you let this one slide, huh?
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' When there's a contract, nothing can be allowed to "slide." If the contract is not followed, then it is broken.
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 wanyan 07.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' No! If I only take one half, then it can't be repaired, and the power of the God of Salt cannot be restored...
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 wanyan 08.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' No matter what, I must be faithful to her...
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 wanyan 09.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Even if it breaks the contract, I don't care.
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' So you are already decided? Hmm... Then, there is a price to pay for breaking the contract.
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Zhongli!
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' That is to say, you consign yourself to "suffer the Wrath of the Rock."
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 wanyan 10.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' That... That's okay. The God of Salt gave up her life to protect her people. My sacrifice is nothing compared to that.
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 wanyan 11.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Punish me however you want. Just let me take this proof of my faith!
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, you can't hit her!
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Perhaps that punishment would be easier for her, but...
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' As punishment, I will tell you the truth.
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 wanyan 12.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 wanyan 13.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' The truth? You mean the truth is my punishment?
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Yes. The truth that I am about to tell you shall be your price to pay for breaking the contract.
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I'm afraid to say that the God of Salt, Havria, was not the powerful god you imagine her to be.
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Rather, she was a small and weak god who yielded to all other gods. When it came to war, she lost... never able to win a seat among The Seven.
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 wanyan 14.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Wh&mdash;What...!?
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' During the Archon War, the gods of this world used all their strength and cunning to vie for control of Teyvat.
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' But Havria instead chose to flee. She thought that by giving up before a fight could start, she could save herself and her people from the war.
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 zhongli 13.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' However, during such a long war, there is no end to the advances of aggressors.
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 zhongli 14.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' After making countless concessions, Havria had lost all of her lands until only one small haven remained.
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 wanyan 15.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' No... no... it can't be so...
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 zhongli 15.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' In her last days, she had not even a single blade to defend her people with.
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 wanyan 16.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' "Not even a single blade?" Then, this sword...
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 zhongli 16.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' This sword is not a relic belonging to the God of Salt... but is instead the murder weapon used to kill her.
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 wanyan 17.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Murder weapon?
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 wanyan 18.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' No! That's not true, that can't be true! You are trying to test my faith in the God of Salt!
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 zhongli 17.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' As I said before, I only state the facts.
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 wanyan 19.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Preposterous! Y&mdash;You are a follower of Morax, don't try to trick me!

;(Wan'yan cannot accept Zhongli's words. She storms off further into the ruin...)
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! Heyyy! Come back!
:{{DIcon}} That was too much for her to take.
::{{A|vo zllq004 5 zhongli 18a.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It is a punishment, after all. I did not want to tell her such cruel facts, but the contract was broken...
:{{DIcon}} What you said really is true, right?
::{{A|vo zllq004 5 zhongli 18b.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Indeed. Otherwise, why would I use the truth as punishment? I did not want to tell her such cruel facts, but the contract was broken...
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 zhongli 19.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Let's follow her deeper into the ruin. There, I fear, we will find something that will leave her no choice but to face the truth.

----

;(Catch up to Wanyan)
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are these statue thingies... running?
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What will we find ahead...?
:{{A|vo zllq004 5 zhongli 20.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Salt. And betrayal.

;(Examine the fleeing statues)
:'''Examine Salinized Adherent:''' (He seems to have been fleeing from something, no doubt suspecting that something terrible was afoot.)

;(Talk to Wanyan)
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 wanyan 01.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' ...What are all these?
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 wanyan 02.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' What did they see... What did they do?
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 wanyan 03.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' What... What happened?
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Since you do not trust me, let us continue onward.
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' That which lies beyond this door will show you all that happened back then.

;(Door unlocks)

----

;(Examine the statue in the middle)
:'''Examine Salinized Adherent:''' (He once held something in his hand, upraised in a pose of supreme effort. This must be the one who...)

;(Examine the body of salt on the floor)
:'''Examine Sal Flore:''' (Ground zero. No matter what was once here, naught remains but a single flower of salt.)

;(At the end of the ruin, you see motionless white figures, their postures suggesting they are battling to escape. In the center of the room, the one they ran from has disappeared, leaving behind only traces of white salt...)
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' This is the scene of the crime. Havria's body dissipated, leaving nothing but these traces of salt. Her dying moments have since been frozen in time to this very day.
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 wanyan 04.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' ...
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The story continues that some among her people realized at last that this gentle, kind but weak god could never protect anyone in wartime.
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The Archon War was cruel in the extreme. Instead of consigning her to the agony of defeat, they thought, perhaps it would be better to give her a quick release.
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But what about these statue thingies?
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' No matter how weak the god, the power that flows forth when they are slain is beyond the strength of mortal coils to bear.
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Those who could not flee were thus transformed.
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Those of her people who were untouched by this disaster left for Liyue, where they sought refuge with Rex Lapis.
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Their descendants feared Havria's remnants and lived in terror that she had laid upon them an eternal curse...
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' So they risked their lives to come here to break the sword, and offer up obeisances in hopes that her anger might be appeased.
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' But they need not have done so. For how could a god who had never once resisted &mdash; even till the end &mdash; nurse hatred for her people in her heart?
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 wanyan 05.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' I&mdash;I... Even if this is so, I can't...
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 wanyan 06.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' This must be a lie... a false history... all of it!
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 wanyan 07.ogg}} '''Wanyan:''' Don't you dare try to... shake my faith!

;(Wan'yan runs off again, this time in despair...)
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yikes, Zhongli didn't show any mercy this time, either...
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' This is the price she must pay... Yet I would not call it a bad thing.
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 zhongli 13.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Judging by how she appeared, I fear that she will struggle for a time. But even if she may not escape that struggle immediately, simply recognizing the truth is good enough for now.
:{{DIcon}} You seem all too familiar with what happened to the God of Salt.
::{{A|vo zllq004 6 zhongli 14a.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Indeed. In ages past, Havria's story served as a warning to me as well.
:{{DIcon}} You didn't just hear rumors about the way to break the seal, did you?
::{{A|vo zllq004 6 zhongli 14b.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' No, indeed. How sharp of you &mdash; yet this is not a matter of wisdom. Only age.
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 zhongli 15.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Faith in a god who has already passed will do you no good.
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 zhongli 16.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' So it is for Havria, and so it is for Morax also.
:{{DIcon}} The people of Liyue will understand that one day.
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 zhongli 17.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Alright, then. Now, would you like to accompany me in taking a trip to Guyun Stone Forest?
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What do you want to do, Zhongli?
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 zhongli 18.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' *sigh*...
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 zhongli 19.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Treading old ground, telling old stories...
:{{A|vo zllq004 6 zhongli 20.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' ...One cannot help but be reminded of old acquaintances.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
*The quest name is a reference to [[Farewell, Archaic Lord]], where the [[Traveler]], Paimon, and Zhongli prepare the Rite of Parting for Rex Lapis' death.
*Although the Traveler can claim that they have not heard Wanyan use the title "Lord of Geo," she does refer to Morax as such once in [[Shadow of Yore]].
