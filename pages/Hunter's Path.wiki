==Description==
A golden hunting bow made of white branches that contains the blessing of the forest.<br>
Trees with such white branches are rarely seen nowadays.<br>
The blessings were once covered by darkened blood, but the stains have been washed away by water.

[[Viridescent|The hunter]] pursuing the dark herd seemed to be on a hunt without end.<br>
Nights of waiting under rotten leaves, and days of slumbering inside chunks of meat,<br>
All for that fatal arrow that would penetrate the heart of the prey &mdash; and then, it was on to the next target.

Gradually, the hunter stopped worrying about the wind revealing her location to the prey,<br>
Or about using wildflowers to camouflage her human scent,<br>
As the smell she diffused became similar to the stench wild beasts were familiar with.

She forgot the human tongue long before she became a hunter.<br>
During her endless hunt, the time and the sun and the moon faded into oblivion,<br>
And so did the boundless hunting fields promised to her.<br>
Even the blind youth who first found her and gave her the bow made of white branches,<br>
And led her onto the path of the dark beasts,<br>
Was forgotten in her undistracted hunt.

"For the bloodstained shall never find yonder hunting grounds of endless viridescence."<br>
"No, master, this world where barbarous beasts roam shall be my hunting grounds..."

Looking into the clear water under the moonlight, the hunter found that she, too, had unwittingly turned into a wild beast.<br>
Following the tracks left by the beast, [[Bloodstained Knight|the black knight]] whose form and [[The Black Sword|sword]] were reflected in the water found her, at a loss as she was...

"So, you were just another beast to be destroyed, tempted by the illusory silhouette of the moon in the water."<br>
"How strange. For a moment, I thought I saw a maiden lost in the forest..."

"I must continue westwards. For the sake of justice... To settle the crime of twisting man into a [[Hilichurls|beast's form]]."
