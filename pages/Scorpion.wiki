|description = Large arthropods that live beneath the sandstone that specialize in using their venom to hunt.<br>Due to their ability to secrete highly toxic fluids when under attack, they have long been much sought-after by plotters and alchemists alike, with these fluids becoming common ingredients in poison-making. Indeed, human hearts are yet more dangerous than venomous scorpions.
