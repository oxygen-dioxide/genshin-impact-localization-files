{{Lang|'''Sigils of Permission'''|zh=百无禁忌箓|zh_rm=Bǎiwújìnjì Lù|zh_tl=Talisman of Nonrestriction}} were once created by [[Rex Lapis]] and infused with adeptal power.<ref name="custodian of clouds">{{Ref/Quest|Custodian of Clouds}}</ref> During the [[Archon War]], such talismans were used by mortals to channel divine power.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Solitary Fragrance}}</ref> Now, most of its power has worn off,<ref name="custodian of clouds" /> but [[adepti]] will still refrain from harming its holder.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Wangshu}}</ref>

The Sigil of Permission received from [[Childe]] is a product of Fatui research and not one of those created by Rex Lapis. Intensive study of the patterns on the talisman has allowed the [[Fatui]] to recreate them. During [[Heart of Glaze]], the duplicates were used to free [[Osial]] from Rex Lapis's restraints for a short period of time.

==Trivia==
*A Sigil of Permission is featured in [[Tartaglia|Tartaglia's]] [https://youtu.be/ZF4KyX0ASnI Character Tale]. In the video, he is seen taking back a "debt" from a master, the debt being one of the Sigils.
*{{Lang|mini=1|zh=百无禁忌|zh_rm=Bǎiwújìnjì}} is a Chinese idiom meaning "nothing is taboo" or "nothing is restricted."
