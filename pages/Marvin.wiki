==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Marvin:''' Ahhh! Father, please...
:'''Marvin:''' ...Oh. You gave me a real fright... Who are you? *yawn*
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror...
:;(After completing [[A Long Shot]])
::'''Marvin:''' I dare not even think of it. When the storm came, a huge rock came hurtling towards me. Fortunately, it missed, smashing into the ground next to me.
::'''Marvin:''' At that instant, all I could think about was my girlfriend. That was when I realized she means the world to me.
::'''Marvin:''' Even if my father opposes us being together and tries to meddle into our affairs, our relationship will survive!
::'''Marvin:''' Yes. We will be together. I just... need some time to persuade my father...
:{{DIcon}} Are you... sleeping with your eyes open?
::'''Marvin:''' I was... until you woke me up!
::'''Marvin:''' This is an act, you know. Something to fool my family, so that this night's rendezvous will not be exposed... Ahem.
::'''Marvin:''' It's very impolite to wake someone when they're sleeping, so please refrain from doing it again. You won't find me to be as agreeable as my father... *yawn*
:{{DIcon}} Who's your father?
::'''Marvin:''' My family name is Goth, get the picture?
::'''Marvin:''' My father is the general manager of the Goth Grand Hotel.
::'''Marvin:''' Don't be fooled by his Mr. Nice Guy act &mdash; he's being completely obstinate and unreasonable on the matter of my marriage!
::'''Marvin:''' That's why all I can do in the middle of the night is to... to&mdash; Wait a moment, you haven't been sent by him to get me talking, have you?
::'''Marvin:''' Go away, get out of here. I am wide awake, I'm not in the slightest bit sleepy... *yawn*
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Marvin:''' *yawn* What were... you... say&mdash; *snoring*
{{Dialogue end}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Marvin:''' You came to me again, my darling Marla!
:'''Marla:''' Oh, Marvin; how could I ever let you go! I don't care what your father thinks about our being together, my love for you is like... like the ice at the river's source in Springvale...
:'''Marvin:''' Marla, no... Your love should not be a thing so cold...
:'''Marla:''' I mean not that; I mean that my love will become a sweet spring of live-giving water with which to quench your thirst for a thousand &mdash; nay, for ten thousand years...
:'''Marvin:''' Oh, Marla, my love! Then my love for you is like the eyes of the eagle who soars over Falcon Coast...
:'''Marla:''' Marvin, no... Your love should not be a thing so shrewd...
:'''Marvin:''' I mean not that; I mean that I could not bear for you to disappear from my gaze, even for a moment; and if ever there came one who sought to steal you away from me, I would surely make known unto them the sharpness of my talons and the hardness of my beak...
:'''Marla:''' Oh, Marvin!
:'''Marvin:''' Oh, Marla!

====Daytime====
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Marvin:''' Ugh, should I tell my father or not?
:'''Marvin:''' No, I suppose it would be best if I didn't. But if I don't tell him, I...
:{{DIcon}} Something on your mind?
::'''Marvin:''' I... I have a friend. Yes, a friend...
::'''Marvin:''' He's very taken with a certain girl, but unfortunately, she doesn't come from a particularly wealthy family, so my friend's rather worried that his father will oppose their marriage.
::'''Marvin:''' Thing is, he truly loves that girl and wants her to be his wife.
::'''Marvin:''' So I... well, he, is wondering if he should simply come clean with his father...
::{{DIcon}} You sure you're talking about a friend?
:::'''Marvin:''' Ahem! *cough* D-Don't you dare say such scurrilous things...
:::'''Marvin:''' Wait a moment, you haven't been sent by the old man to test me, have you?
:::'''Marvin:''' Hmph, whatever. I said nothing. Just go.
::{{DIcon}} I don't think you should...
:::'''Marvin:''' Hmm, is that so...
:::'''Marvin:''' *cough* Ah, uh. I said nothing. You don't hear anything from me!
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it, then.
::'''Marvin:''' Yes, alright. Please don't disturb me any further...

''After [[Aroma of the Past]]{{Verify}}''
:'''Marla:''' There you are, dear Marvin.
:'''Marvin:''' Oh, Marla! I can't turn my back on you, not when you're inviting me to Weinlesefest!
:'''Marla:''' No matter what your father thinks of us, my love... is like wine made from Mist Flowers...
:'''Marvin:''' Marla, no... Your love should not be a thing so cold...
:'''Marla:''' No. I mean that, my love will turn into burning liquor to warm you for a thousand &mdash;& nay, for ten thousand years...
:'''Marvin:''' Oh, Marla, my love! Then my love for you is like the bitter north wind that follows the west wind...
:'''Marla:''' Marvin, no... Your love should not be a thing so chilly...
:'''Marvin:''' No. I mean that, I don't want you out of my sight, not even for a moment. I want to turn into a full season of Mondstadt's wind, always by your side...
:'''Marla:''' Oh, Marvin!
:'''Marvin:''' Oh, Marla!

===Windblume's Breath===
:'''Marvin:''' Marla, the Windblume Festival is here, and yet, it holds no meaning for me...
:'''Marla:''' Oh, Marvin, say not that!
:'''Marla:''' We do not have your father's approval, but this time for lovers is ours also...
:'''Marvin:''' No, what I mean is that as long as I am with you, every day may well as be the Windblume Festival.
:'''Marla:''' You're right, Marvin. Our love is like the dandelions that bloom on Cape Oath...
:'''Marvin:''' Marla, no... Our love should not be a thing so fragile...
:'''Marla:''' No, I mean to say that though the dandelions are scattered by the wild winds, their lives will not thusly end.
:'''Marla:''' Dandelion Seeds will fly to distant places, take root, and sprout there... One day, they will cover the length and breadth of Teyvat.
:'''Marvin:''' Oh, my darling Marla...
:'''Marla:''' Oh, Marvin! My love...
