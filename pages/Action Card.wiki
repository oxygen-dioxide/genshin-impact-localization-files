'''Action Cards''' are a [[Card Type]] in [[Genius Invokation TCG]].

During a match, 30 Action Cards in the Deck will form the Draw Pile. When the game starts, each player will draw cards from their Draw Pile to form their Hand each round.

When the player plays Action Cards with a Cost, the corresponding Elemental Dice need to be expended. Action Cards generally cost [[File:Genius Invokation TCG Matching Cost.png|20px]] Matching Dice of any element or [[File:Genius Invokation TCG Unaligned Cost.png|20px]] Unaligned Dice, except [[Talent Card]]s which will require Matching Dice of a specific element and sometimes Energy.

==Types==
There are 3 types of Action Cards, each with different effects:
* [[Equipment Card]]s: These are equipped on characters to apply an effect that buffs this character.
* [[Event Card]]s: Play these to immediately trigger all their effects.
* [[Support Card]]s: Place these in the Support Zone to continuously apply supporting effects.

==How to Obtain==
Action Cards can be obtained through:
* Purchase from [[Card Shop]].
* Complete missions in [[TCG Player's Manual]].
* Achieve victory in [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage|Stages]].
