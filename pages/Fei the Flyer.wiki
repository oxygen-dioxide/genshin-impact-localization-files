==Profile==
Fei joined [[The Crux Clash]] for the Masterless [[Vision]], knowing that it would be a wealthy commodity to sell on the black market. Due to his ties with the [[Treasure Hoarders]], Fei was more skilled in martial arts than most of the competitors, taking advantage of his speed to overcome more powerful opponents. During the tournament, he bested [[Uncle Yun]], but after seeing [[Rongshi]] lose to the [[Traveler]], realized that he was outmatched and stole the Vision. However, he was pursued by them and [[Kaedehara Kazuha|Kazuha]] and forced to give the Vision up in return for not being apprehended.

===Appearance===
Fei wears the Treasure Hoarders outfit that the [[Treasure Hoarders: Pyro Potioneer|Pyro Potioneer]] dons. His hair color is also the same as them, albeit a different hairstyle.

==Trivia==
* Despite Fei getting into a fighting stance, he will use a crossbow during the fight.
** His voice also recycles lines from [[Raptor]] rather than having his own.
