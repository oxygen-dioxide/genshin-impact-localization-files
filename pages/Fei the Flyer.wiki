==Profile==
Fei joined [[The Crux Clash]] for the Masterless [[Vision]], knowing that it would be a wealthy commodity to sell on the black market. Due to his ties with the [[Treasure Hoarders]], Fei was more skilled in martial arts than most of the competitors, taking advantage of his speed to overcome more powerful opponents. During the tournament, he bested [[Uncle Yun]], but after seeing [[Rongshi]] lose to the [[Traveler]], realized that he was outmatched and stole the Vision. However, he was pursued by them and [[Kaedehara Kazuha|Kazuha]] and forced to give the Vision up in return for not being apprehended.

===Personality===
Despite his shady ties, Fei is confident, calculating and more honorable than one would expect from a Treasure Hoarder, having signed up for the tournament intending to win fair and square, seeing that none of the competition posed a threat to him. However, his sense of fair play has its limits, as after seeing the Traveler best Rongshi, Fei made use of his criminal skills to steal the Vision and escape. Upon being foiled, he was flabbergasted that the samurai had been aware of his intentions all along, believing that he had made the perfect getaway.

===Appearance===
Fei wears the Treasure Hoarders outfit that the [[Treasure Hoarders: Pyro Potioneer|Pyro Potioneer]] dons. His hair color is also the same as them, albeit a different hairstyle.

==Gameplay==
Fei the Flyer is the last enemy encountered in [[Follow the Wind]]. He is similar to [[Raptor]] in terms of attacks, igniting his crossbow with {{color|Pyro}} to deal {{Color|Pyro|Pyro DMG}}. He can also back off and retaliate in a single bow shot if the player strays near to him.
