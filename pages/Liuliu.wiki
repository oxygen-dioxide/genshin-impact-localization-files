==Trivia==
* In [[To Mondstadt]], using the Elemental Sight on one of the Mondstadt Bandits (the one who meets with The [[Traveler]] and [[Mona]]) will also reveal the name "Treasure Hoarders – Liuliu".
* During the [[Lantern Rite]] Story Quest [[Currents Deep Beneath the Lanterns]], using [[Elemental Sight]] on the man named "???" and "Suspicious Person" reveals his name as "Treasure Hoarder – Liuliu". Oddly enough, however, [[Letter to the Treasure Hoarders|his letter]], when translated back from the [[Languages#Teyvat Language|common Teyvat language]], is riddled with misspellings &mdash; a trait the other notes left by Liuliu did not have, this is possibly done on purpose.

|zh_note = {{zh|{{wt|溜||Chinese}}|rm=Liū}} literally means "to sneak away." {{zh|{{wt|溜溜||Chinese}}|rm=Liūliū}} itself is also an ideophonic phrase which represents something dripping, flowing, or rolling. In this case, it is likely used in the context of sneaking away, repeated to emphasize that Liuliu is good at escaping, or slipping away.

|ja_note = {{ja|{{wt|ja:遁ずら|とんずら}}|rm=Tonzura}} is a slang term for slipping away after committing a crime.
