{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Traveler, you're here! Did you come to pay respects?
:{{DIcon}} How's your wood carving going?
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Oh, I'd say that I'm doing fine. I still need to fix the dimensions of the carvings, though.
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' According to my initial thoughts, these carvings should fit snugly in a person's palm.
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' That way, they can play with it easily.
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Also, other than the carvings themselves, I think I should make some decorations.
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' I've seen that when people make these carvings, they will also add some accessories on the side.
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Things like flowers, animals, bases that have flowery patterns, things like that...
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' I'd also like to put such decorative bases on my wood carvings. That said, due to sizing issues, we can only put one ornament on one wood carving...
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' But I'm thinking that if the decorations are detachable, I can just put on whatever decorations my customers request.
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' I'd probably want to start from simpler decorations... Something like Naku Weed.
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' So, Traveler, could you help me gather 3 stalks of Naku Weed back to use for reference?
:{{DIcon}} I've got your back.
:{{DIcon}} Why three?
::'''Ooshima Junpei:''' If I can get three, I can view them in three different states.
::'''Ooshima Junpei:''' That way, I should be able to carve the best Naku Weed that I can.
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Sorry, Traveler, but I'll be leaving this in your hands. Come back and look for me once you have those Naku Weeds.
----
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Have you gotten those Naku Weeds?
;''(Give 3 Naku Weeds)''
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Oh, nice! These should do the trick. Thank you so much, Traveler!
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Now, time to do a little investigating. How are we going to carve wood into the shape of Naku Weed...
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' If I can make these decorations well enough and have a wide enough variety of them...
:'''Ooshima Junpei:''' Maybe we'll be able to sell them separately...
