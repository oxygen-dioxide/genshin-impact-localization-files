|description    = A working space that combines mining equipment, processing facilities, and a display shelf for finished weapons &mdash; a one-stop shop from production to retail and enough to satisfy the needs of a full team of Natlan craftspeople.<br>Natlan is a land shaped by war where weapons and their production are viewed with great importance. Its furnaces are kept burning with an unrivaled heat, in hopes that this fiery baptism will forge weapons for warriors that shall endure and defeat even the strongest of foes, just as the Sacred Flame does.
