==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* The domains are named "Spring," which in the original Chinese text is {{Lang|{{w|Jingzhe}}|zh=惊蛰|rm=Jīngzhé}}, or the period when nature reawakens after winter ends. In traditional Chinese folklore, it is believed that thunderstorms will awaken hibernating insects &mdash; hence why the Ley Line Disorder favors the [[Superconduct]] reaction.
