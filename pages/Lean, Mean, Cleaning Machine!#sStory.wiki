:'''Paimon''': The scenery in the Court of Fontaine's so amazing! The sky and the water are always so blue~
:'''Traveler''': The city's always so clean too! Not a speck of dust to be seen.
:'''Paimon''': D'you think... it's the power of Hydro in the air? It's like all the dust's been washed away!
:'''Traveler''': A humid climate can actually make dirt even harder to get off...
:'''Traveler''': It must be down to those hardworking Fontainians cleaning it regularly!
:'''Paimon''': Yikes... Removing stubborn stains sounds even tougher than beating up powerful enemies!
:'''Traveler''': They have special cleaning tools for the job, like powerful water cannons! What say you, Paimon &mdash; fancy giving it a go?
:'''Paimon''': Yay! Time for some water fun!
:'''Traveler''': The cleanup wastewater can even be reused~
:'''Paimon''': Let's get started already! Paimon's feeling like a lean, clean, meaning machine!
:'''Traveler''': Personally, I'm feeling more like a "lean, mean, cleaning machine" &mdash; but each to their own!
