==Profile==
Imatani Keisuke is part of the [[Tenryou Commission]], though he feels regret over confiscating people's [[Vision]]s and wonders if he is doing the right thing. He is the son of [[Imatani Saburou]] and [[Imatani Kaori]] from [[Konda Village]] and used to be good childhood friends with [[Sakujirou]], until they fought over the peace in Inazuma.

===Personality===
''(To be added.)''

===Appearance===
Keisuke wears a standard uniform modeled from the {{Lang|''ashigaru''|ja=足軽}} of feudal Japan. He wears a purple-gray ''shitagi'', lavender ''kobakama'', white socks, and ''waraji'' sandals. His eggplant-colored armor with pale gold accents consists of ''dou'' (breastplate) with the [[Inazuma Shogunate]]'s crest, ''kote'' (armored sleeves), ''haidate'' (thigh guards), and ''sune-ate'' (greaves). He is also wearing a {{Lang|''jingasa''|ja=陣笠}} with the crest of the Inazuma Shogunate. He is equipped with a ''juumonji yari'' (cross-shaped spear), whose shaft is lavender colored, and contains the Shogunate crest under the spearhead.
