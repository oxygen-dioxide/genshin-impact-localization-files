[[File:A Parade of Providence Event Cutscene Animation- "Crown of Glory" - Genshin Impact|thumb]]
After some time, the Traveler and Paimon check with Aarav, who states that they've found the culprit: Jiwani, Sachin's son. They interrogate him, and he reveals his goal: to find his father and force him to hand the wealth to him. However, not only did they fail to find him, the Eremites he hired were defeated by "a flying brat" and "a guy wearing green." The Traveler asks Jiwani about the Diadem of Knowledge, and he says that after Sachin bought that Diadem, weird things happened, but he also says that weird things has always happened since the day his father returned after venturing into the desert for his research. With this information, the Traveler and Paimon decide to report to Kareena and request to put the competition on hold. However, when they arrive at the venue, the contestants have gone to Mawtiyima Forest for the third round, where the goal is to find the Diadem of Knowledge and place it on the stand. Considering the winner of this round will most likely win the competition, all six contestants will be chasing after it. The two make their way to Mawtiyima Forest as soon as possible, but they are too late. The Diadem is gone, and they can only wait at the finish line now. Kaveh manages to grab the Diadem and put it on the stand, making him the winner of the third round, but at that point, a strange voice manifests inside his head.

The voice is then revealed to be Sachin, or rather, a fragment of his consciousness. Twenty-eight years ago, he headed to the desert and found only conflict, so he tried to find a way to stop it, even came in contact with the "Lost Darshan" in the desert. However, he failed because he believed that humanity's nature can only create conflict and, subsequently, destruction. He then found a diadem that can store a part of one's consciousness, so he put his experience inside, asked the Akademiya to manage his estate, and then, with great emptiness, ended his life. Through the diadem, he hoped to find someone like him, someone who is both a genius and an idealist to continue his experiment in human nature, and found Kaveh to be that person. Sachin decides to give his fortune to him, believing that whether he is tormented through his research or simply enjoying his estate, his research can still continue as long as he wears the Diadem. However, Kaveh destroys the Diadem and chooses to donate all of his riches to the people in need. Sachin's consciousness fades away but not before smiling at his successor's decision.

As per the rules, Kaveh is crowned the winner of the Interdarshan Championship, but because he destroyed the Diadem of Knowledge and donated the money, all that's left in the prize pool is the limited-edition card and a priority in future project proposals. Kaveh accepts the card, but as he doesn't need it, he gifts it to Cyno, who offers one million Mora to buy it. Kaveh reluctantly agrees, using most of the money to pay the debts of the month and the rest to treat everyone for a meal. As for the rest, Faruzan found a new student, Layla gained the admiration of her fellow Rtawahist classmates, and Tighnari's lecture reached a record number of participants. However, one problem remains: Sachin's research. The Traveler deduces that his research is in Aaru Village, considering how he spent plenty of time in the desert. When they arrive, they find Alhaitham, who hadn't been seen in Kaveh's get-together, alongside Sachin's research, which Alhaitham states as the reason why he became a commentator for the event. He also reveals what he wrote in the note on Sachin's documents: "Lofty ideals may provide no defense at all against nihilism, but perhaps little decisions can. By their own choice, the idealist seeks to bring happiness to all, while denying themselves the same. Thus they shall never reach even the borders of truth until they wipe away the ignorance that blinds them."

He then leaves, and shortly after, Nahida and the Wanderer appear, the former explaining that the latter's reason for entering the competition was to observe Sachin's successor, and if something went wrong, he would intervene and stop them. Nahida also explains that Sachin is not wrong, but it's only one side of the truth. Regarding his research, Nahida will seal it away as it was Kaveh's right to decide to not have it diseminated, but she would also not hinder anyone that wished to follow his line of research in the future. She also expresses a desire for the Wanderer to continue his studies in Vahumana, and that she will personally grade "Hat Guy's" final thesis.
