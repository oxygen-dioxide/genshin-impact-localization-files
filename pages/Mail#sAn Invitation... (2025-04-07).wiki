|text      = I received a commission to escort a caravan across the desert. The [[Natlan]]ese client was a pretty interesting guy, and we shared many stories, including one about the outlander heroes who saved Natlan. Pretty awe-inspiring stuff from you there, I'll say!

Once the job was done, not only did he give me a tip, but also a whole bunch of Natlanese delicacies. Friendly fella &mdash; consider me a fan!

I gotta say, these snacks sure are pretty. There's almost as much color on them as my makeup box! And since I've got the rest of the day off, I'm gonna dole these out to the kids I'm subsidizing.

Why not swing by if you're free? Come share your side of the story with us &mdash; I'm just as interested as any of the kids are.
