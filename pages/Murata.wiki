'''Murata''', also known as the '''God of War''' and the '''Lady of Fire''', was a [[Pyro]] Archon and a member of [[The Seven]] who presided over [[Natlan]].<ref name="Manga Prologue">{{Ref/Manga|0}}</ref><ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/TAlKhARUcoY Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail｜Genshin Impact (Contains spoilers)]</ref><ref group="Note">The Chinese version of the Manga's Prologue chapter calls her the {{Lang|God of Pyro|zh=火之神|zh_rm=Huǒ zhī Shén|zh_lit=God of Fire}} and the {{Lang|God of War|zh=战争之神|zh_rm=Zhànzhēng zhī Shén}}, both of which are titles affiliated with Natlan's Archon in ''Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail''.</ref>

Her status as of a thousand years ago is unknown. By the time [[Vennessa]] and her tribe, whom [[Venti]] calls the "Children of Murata," were enslaved in [[Mondstadt]], they had forgotten their history.

===Introduction===
{{Quote|Back in those days, warriors from every tribe would perform rites of combat and celebrate victories in her name. Come to think of it... She can be pretty obnoxious at times.|Venti's explanation of Murata to Vennessa|Manga Prologue: Songs of the Wind}}
Little is known about Murata or her reign outside of Venti and Vennessa's brief conversation about her in the Manga. According to Venti, all of Murata's people have fiery-red hair and hardy bodies;<ref name="Manga Prologue" /> Vennessa could have easily broken through the metal shackles placed on her in Mondstadt, as Mondstadt's ores lacked the "divine flame" of her homeland.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Shackles of the Dandelion Gladiator}}</ref>
[[File:Manga C0 The Children of Murata.png|thumb|right|Snippet from the manga prologue|alt=Two people with red hair, their faces in shadow. The caption reads "The Children of Murata, the Lady of Fire, are a hardy people blessed with a head of fiery-red hair. But they are few in number and seldom seen in the North."]]
Murata was the Pyro Archon before Venti's disappearance from Mondstadt, and his remarks about her indicate that the two were familiar with each other. During the end days of the [[Mondstadt Aristocracy]] 1,000 years ago, Venti was awakened by the cries of those oppressed by the aristocracy and became acquainted with Vennessa, who was then an enslaved gladiator. He immediately identified her as a Muratan and told a confused Vennessa about the god. When questioned why her elders had not taught her this, Vennessa informed him that her tribe had spent generations wandering the plains; her ancestors prioritized passing down the art of combat and over time, her tribe lost touch with their past.<ref name="Manga Prologue" />

===Personality===
Venti describes her as someone who "can be pretty obnoxious at times," and states that Vennessa's temper is "very Muratan."<ref name="Manga Prologue" />

===Appearance===
Nothing is known about Murata's appearance besides the fact that she used a female vessel.

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
*Murata's name is a direct reference to the character [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Murata Himeko|Murata Himeko]] from the ''Houkai Gakuen 2'' and ''{{w|Honkai Impact 3rd}}'', other games also developed by [[HoYoverse]].
