'''Murata''',<ref group="Note" name="murata name">The name "Murata" is used by the English localization of the [[Manga]] Prologue: [[Songs of the Wind]]. However, the English localization deviates from the original Chinese text by using "Murata" as a personal name. In the original text, the Lady of Fire is left unnamed while "Murata" is only used in the demonym {{Lang|Muratan|zh=穆纳塔人|zh_rm=Mùnàtǎ rén|zh_tl=Murata people|zh_lit=Munata people}}. Linguistic convention indicates "Murata" is more likely to be a location or nation name than a personal name. For convenience of description and ease of searching, "Murata" will remain the article name until more accurate information is revealed.</ref> also known by her {{w|Goetic}} name '''Haborym''' and bearing the [[Ancient Name]] {{Ancient Name||'''Kiongozi'''|bearer=1}}, was a [[God]] of War and a [[Pyro Archon]] among [[The Seven]] who presided over [[Natlan]].<ref name="Manga Prologue">{{Ref/Manga|0}}</ref><ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/TAlKhARUcoY Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail]</ref><ref group="Note">The Chinese version of the Manga's Prologue chapter calls her the {{Lang|God of Pyro|zh=火之神|zh_rm=Huǒ zhī Shén|zh_lit=God of Fire}} and the {{Lang|God of War|zh=战争之神|zh_rm=Zhànzhēng zhī Shén}}, both of which are titles affiliated with Natlan's Archon in ''Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail''.</ref>

There have been at least four named Pyro Archons prior to [[Mavuika]], but Murata's position in the history of Pyro Archons is unclear. By the time [[Venti]] awoke from his slumber 1,000 years ago, Murata's status was already uncertain, as the "children of Murata" &mdash; [[Vennessa]] and her tribe &mdash; had departed from Natlan long enough that they had no knowledge of their history, let alone Murata.<ref name="Manga Prologue" />

==Profile==
[[File:Manga C0 The Children of Murata.png|150px|thumb|right|Snippet from the manga prologue|alt=Two people with red hair, their faces in shadow. The caption reads "The Children of Murata, the Lady of Fire, are a hardy people blessed with a head of fiery-red hair. But they are few in number and seldom seen in the North."]]
===Introduction===
{{Quote|Back in those days, warriors from every tribe would perform rites of combat and celebrate victories in her name. Come to think of it... She can be pretty obnoxious at times.|Venti's explanation of Murata to Vennessa|Manga Prologue: Songs of the Wind}}
Little is known about Murata or her reign outside of Venti and Vennessa's brief conversation about her in the Manga. According to Venti, all of Murata's people have fiery-red hair and hardy bodies;<ref name="Manga Prologue" /> Vennessa could have easily broken through the metal shackles placed on her in Mondstadt, as Mondstadt's ores lacked the "divine flame" of her homeland.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Shackles of the Dandelion Gladiator}}</ref>

Murata was the Pyro Archon before Venti's disappearance from Mondstadt, and his remarks about her indicate that the two were familiar with each other. During the end days of the [[Mondstadt Aristocracy]] 1,000 years ago, Venti was awakened by the cries of those oppressed by the aristocracy and became acquainted with Vennessa, who was then an enslaved gladiator. He immediately identified her as a Muratan and told a confused Vennessa about the god. When questioned why her elders had not taught her this, Vennessa informed him that her tribe had spent generations wandering the plains; her ancestors prioritized passing down the art of combat and over time, her tribe lost touch with their past.<ref name="Manga Prologue" />

===Appearance===
Nothing is known about Murata's appearance besides the fact that she used a female vessel.

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* Murata's name may be a reference to the character [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Murata Himeko|Murata Himeko]] from ''Houkai Gakuen 2'' and ''{{w|Honkai Impact 3rd}}'', games also developed by [[HoYoverse]], who shares a fire theme.
** While "Murata" is used in every localization of the Manga, the original Chinese term instead reads {{Lang|"Munata"|zh=穆纳塔|zh_tl=Mùnàtǎ}}. Notably, the latter two characters have since been used as Natlan's Chinese name.
