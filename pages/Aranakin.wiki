==Profile==
Aranakin is one of the Aranara who is responsible for cleaning [[Mawtiyima]] of [[The Withering]] that had set root there.

After meeting him, the [[Traveler]] found a group of Eremites camping outside and left on reasonable terms. Soon after, Aranakin appeared, telling the Traveler that the Eremites they had spoken to were bad people looking for Aranara. He had been looking [[Zohrah Mushroom]] as part of the [[Arahaoma]] to restore Mawtiyima; however, the Eremites they had encountered earlier attempted to steal it, but were stopped by the Traveler.

Upon acquiring the Yajna Grass and [[Barsam Flower]], Aranakin and the other caretakers, [[Aranaga]] and [[Aragaru]] made the Arahaoma and ventured into Mawtiyima and cleansed it of the Withering. Soon after eliminating [[Marana's Avatar]], Aranakin had forgotten them, but after using the melody he had taught them, he was able to convince them that they were good Nara. After exploring an abandoned treehouse, Aranakin caught up with Aranaga and Aragaru to restore some dried flowers.

==Trivia==
* In English-based language patches, Aranakin's name is a pun and reference to the ''{{w|Star Wars}}'' character [https://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Anakin_Skywalker Anakin Skywalker].
** Aranakin also despises sand, claiming that it's coarse, rough, irritating and gets everywhere, which is a reference to ''{{w|Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones}}'', where Anakin complains about visiting his desert homeworld of Tatooine due to sand being "coarse and rough and irritating. And it gets everywhere."

===Etymology===
* "Aranakin" may be derived from {{Lang|1=''nakin|sa=नाकिन्|sa_tl=deity}}.
** This is based on the interpretation that [[Aranaga]] and [[Aragaru]], who are also involved in [[Agnihotra Sutra]], are named after heavenly beings.
