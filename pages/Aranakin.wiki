==Profile==
Aranara is one of the Aranara who was responsible for cleaning [[Mawtiyima]] of [[The Withering]] that had set root there.

After meeting the Aranara, the [[Traveler]] found a group of Eremites camping outside and left on reasonable terms. Soon after, Aranakin appeared, telling the Traveler that the Eremites they had spoken to were bad people looking for Aranara. It had been looking [[Zohrah Mushroom]] as part of the [[Arahaoma]] to restore Mawtiyima; however, the Eremites they had encountered earlier attempted to steal it, but were stopped by the Traveler.

Upon acquiring the Yajna Grass and [[Barsam Flower]], Aranakin and the other caretakers, [[Aranaga]] and [[Aragaru]] made the Arahaoma and ventured into Mawtiyima and cleansed it of the Withering. Soon after eliminating [[Marana's Avatar]], Aranakin had forgotten them, but after using the melody it had taught them, they were able to convince it they were good Nara. After exploring an abandoned treehouse, Aranakin caught up with Aranaga and Aragaru to restore some dried flowers.

===Personality===
Aranakin despises sand, stating that it's rough, coarse, irritating and gets everywhere. When [[Arama]] drained a large amount of sand in [[Old Vanarana]], it stated that Aranakin would've been happy seeing all the sand gone.

==Trivia==
* Aranakin's name is a pun and reference to the ''{{w|Star Wars}}'' character Anakin Skywalker.
** Aranakin also despises sand, claiming that it's coarse, rough, irritating and gets everywhere, which is a reference to {{w|Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones}}, where Anakin complains about visiting his homeworld of Tatooine due to sand being everywhere.
