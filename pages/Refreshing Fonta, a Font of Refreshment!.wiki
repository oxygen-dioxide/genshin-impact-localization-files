{{Quest Description|In the [[Fontaine Research Institute]], you encounter [[Heinry]], a member of the [[Fonta]] development team, and he seems to be quite busy with something...}}

===First Encounter===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Heinry)
:'''Heinry:''' Alright. It seems that the manner in which we're improving Fonta has got to change...
:{{DIcon}} You want to improve Fonta?
:'''Heinry:''' Ah, my dear Honorary Senior Researcher! Good to see you &mdash; most good, indeed!
:'''Heinry:''' Do you still remember me? Well, you might not, considering how busy you were previously...
:'''Heinry:''' But no matter! Allow me to introduce myself &mdash; Heinry, a member of the Fonta development team, at your service.
:'''Paimon:''' You mentioned adjusting the way in which you're improving Fonta... are you developing some all-new version of it, or something?
:'''Heinry:''' Hahaha, that's exactly what I've been doing all this time. We've had some successes and some failures, and some that even now stand at the crossroads between the two...
:'''Heinry:''' But honestly, I've been working in business-related fields too much &mdash; I fear my mind's now closer to a merchant's than that of a researcher.
:'''Heinry:''' As such, my recent development attempts have been rather uninspired, and my design plans have proved likewise...
:'''Heinry:''' *sigh* I used to have all manner of fascinating ideas back when I worked at the Research Institute...
:'''Heinry:''' But we wound up going with plans that would be easier for the public to accept, which would help Fonta sell better &mdash; many of my design drafts were left on the cutting room floor as a result.
:'''Heinry:''' But I have always believed that those original drafts contain incredible inspirational value!
:'''Heinry:''' My return to the Institute was also intended to find those drafts I left behind in my lab, and perhaps, even the samples I left behind.
:'''Heinry:''' Basically, I hope that the passionate, inspired "past-me" can give "present-me" a bit of a boost.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Did that lab not get caught in the explosion?
:'''Heinry:''' Hardly &mdash; it was blasted sky-high as well.
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, then where would you even begin looking for your stuff? Are you gonna use magic to get those drafts out from the ground or something?
:'''Heinry:''' Well, please let me finish. The lab was caught in the blast, yes, and that was a tragedy, but are those drafts not made of paper?
:'''Heinry:''' They might just have been blown away rather than blown to bits &mdash; as such, they'd have floated down to the earth quite safely following the initial explosion.
:{{DIcon}} Your optimism brings tears to my eyes.
::'''Heinry:''' Hahaha, thank you for the praise &mdash; I've always seen it as one of my principal virtues.
:{{DIcon}} You Institute folks are pretty good at rhetoric, aren't you?
::'''Heinry:''' Well, we prefer to call this "being precise."
:'''Heinry:''' I'm not joking here. The lab in which the Fonta research team was in was not that close to ground zero, so there's every chance that it was not directly hit by the explosion.
:'''Heinry:''' In any case, our lab had been closed for some time at that point, and there weren't any active machines in there, so there was no risk of a fire, either.
:'''Heinry:''' In the best case scenario, the documents and samples I left in there may indeed just have been knocked airborne by the shockwave rather than been utterly destroyed.
:'''Heinry:''' And with the aid of some of my colleagues, I've also been able to calculate the possible locations of said materials! The only issue is that they're... a bit far away...
:'''Heinry:''' So, my dear Honorary Senior Researcher, surely you would not leave Fonta and the Institute in the lurch, would you?
:'''Paimon:''' Well... If it's about a new Fonta flavor, {{Traveler}}, we could help him, couldn't we?
:{{DIcon}} Alright, Paimon, I'll do it for you...
:{{DIcon}} Sure, let's do it for the Fonta.
:'''Heinry:''' Splendid! With your aid, I'm yet more certain that we shall succeed. First, let me investigate the destination we're heading to this time.
:'''Heinry:''' Let me see... Aha! There we go. First, search the vicinity of this spot &mdash; I'll mark this "Location 1" out on your map.
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, isn't this area mostly water? You sure your stuff hasn't fallen right in?
:'''Heinry:''' Don't worry. When we sealed our materials, we waterproofed and insect-proofed every last sheet of paper.
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, you've got techniques for that?
:'''Heinry:''' Hahaha! It's hardly worthy of being called any "technique." We just put the manuscripts inside hardy waterproof bags and sealed them tightly.
:{{DIcon}} Let's get looking for the bags then...
:{{DIcon}} Let's just hope the bags didn't fly too far out...
:'''Heinry:''' Right... Ah, yes &mdash; here's two bottles of Fonta for a quick pick-me-up!
:;(Obtain {{Item|Fonta|x=2}})

;(Talk to Heinry again, optional)
:'''Heinry:''' It's in your hands, Traveler. Do it for the Fonta!

;(Pick up the [[Location No. 1 Materials]])
:'''Paimon:''' This should be what Heinry's looking for. Let's take it back to him.

;(Report back to Heinry)
:'''Heinry:''' I can't believe you found these documents completely intact... You really are my lucky star!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Hang on, why do you look so shocked?
:'''Paimon:''' You... didn't have any hopes for successful retrieval at all, did you?
:'''Heinry:''' What? No! I swear on my Fonta that I've never thought that way!
:{{DIcon}} You'd best not have.
:{{DIcon}} And have you asked the Fonta how it feels hearing that?
:'''Heinry:''' *cough* Well! Uh, it's very good that we've retrieved these materials, in any case. Give me a moment to study their contents...
:{{Black Screen|Heinry looks through the materials...}}
:'''Heinry:''' This records the various methods we can use to adjust the Fonta's sweetness.
:'''Heinry:''' Huh. Adding salt to Fonta to boost its flavor... Wow, past-me, what a novel thought!
:{{DIcon}} Looks like present-you has some reflection to do.
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... Paimon's not so sure about salty Fonta...
:'''Heinry:''' Huh? Would you not like such a flavor?
:'''Heinry:''' Oh, not to worry, the saltiness you'd get from the salt wouldn't be too intense. The drink would still slant toward a sweet taste overall.
:'''Heinry:''' Well... But since you did help me retrieve my materials, the new flavor I'm gonna develop will also take your suggestions into account.
:'''Heinry:''' Do you think that I should take the suggestion that this draft contains and add salt to Fonta?
:{{DIcon}} Just add it, I reckon that a little saltiness will do us good.
:{{DIcon}} Uh, let's leave the sweet flavor be, shall we?
:'''Heinry:''' Alright, then. Your will be done!
:'''Heinry:''' I'll continue my research into new Fonta flavors. Once I've got a finished product, I'll be sure to have you try it.
:'''Heinry:''' Saltiness, sweetness... Hmm... How do I balance both of these...?
{{Dialogue End}}

===Second Encounter===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Heinry)
:'''Heinry:''' Looks like I'll have to adjust my research direction... Well, not that it's the biggest problem ever...
:{{DIcon}} Any new Fonta flavors available?
:'''Heinry:''' Hello there. Unfortunately... no, I fear.
:'''Heinry:''' You did help me retrieve a lot of documents previously, but I must confess that I might not have been in my right mind when writing them.
:'''Heinry:''' A lot of the data and design concepts in here corroborate each other, but there are also some contradictions...
:'''Heinry:''' I will need a bit more time to, ah, decipher these documents and try to understand what my thought process was back then.
:'''Heinry:''' Of course, the collection process isn't going to stop, so could you continue helping with that? The search areas will be the same as before.
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
:{{DIcon}} Alright, I'll do it for the Fonta.
:'''Heinry:''' Splendid! With your aid, I'm yet more certain that we shall succeed. First, let me investigate the destination we're heading to this time.
:'''Heinry:''' According to my calculations, some of the materials may have plummeted into the waters in this area... Let me mark this "Location 2" on your map...
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, wouldn't your drafts have become super-soaked by now, then?
:'''Heinry:''' Uh... Well, I couldn't say, so we'll just have to check it out. In the meantime, let's have faith in Fontaine's waterproofing techniques!
:'''Paimon:''' Bah, you just put stuff inside bags! It's nothing that special!
:{{DIcon}} Let's get looking for the bags then...
:{{DIcon}} Let's just hope the bags didn't fly too far out...
:'''Heinry:''' Right... Ah, yes &mdash; here's two bottles of Fonta for a quick pick-me-up!
:;(Obtain {{Item|Fonta|x=2}})

;(Talk to Heinry again, optional)
:'''Heinry:''' It's in your hands, Traveler. Do it for the Fonta!

;(Pick up the [[Location No. 2 Materials]])
:'''Paimon:''' This should be what Heinry's looking for. Let's take it back to him.

;(Report back to Heinry)
:'''Heinry:''' I can't believe you found these documents, and they haven't turned into a sopping wet mess... You really are my lucky star!
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, why do you look so surprised... Weren't you very confident in this "waterproofing technique" of yours?
:'''Heinry:''' Of course I had faith! I just, uh... lacked faith in the hydrological environment. Yes. The environment.
:'''Heinry:''' You know what they say &mdash; "Even the best ship can't withstand all the turbulent tides."
:{{DIcon}} No one says that!
:{{DIcon}} You'd better apologize to these documents later.
:'''Heinry:''' *cough* Well! Uh, it's very good that we've retrieved these materials, in any case. Give me a moment to study their contents...
:{{Black Screen|Heinry looks through the materials...}}
:'''Heinry:''' Huh, so I once wanted to make Fonta that only contains fizz, while lacking any other flavor.
:{{DIcon}} Wouldn't that just be plain soda?
:'''Heinry:''' This material indicates that this was indeed the conclusion I came to at the time as well.
:'''Heinry:''' The original purpose of this sort of Fonta was to help children who don't like drinking water get into it...
:{{DIcon}} You're quite the considerate sort, aren't you?
:{{DIcon}} Remember to drink three glasses of water every day, Paimon.
::'''Paimon:''' Wait, why three? Is there some special meaning there?
:'''Heinry:''' Heh, since this is a design that past-me thought of, there's no need for me to give it up.
:'''Heinry:''' Given that you did help me retrieve my materials, any new flavor I develop will also take your suggestions into account.
:'''Heinry:''' Do you think that I should take this draft's suggestion and continue using the carbonated version?
:{{DIcon}} I reckon carbonation's for the best.
::'''Heinry:''' Understood. I'll take your word on that.
::'''Heinry:''' I'll continue my research into new Fonta flavors. Once I've got a finished product, I'll be sure to have you try it.
::'''Heinry:''' Bubbly... Hmmm... Let me think...
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to try uncarbonated Fonta out.
::'''Heinry:''' Understood. I'll take your word on that.
::'''Heinry:''' I'll continue my research into new Fonta flavors. Once I've got a finished product, I'll be sure to have you try it.
::'''Heinry:''' Hmm. If we remove the fizz, we'll have to make the taste better elsewhere...

;(Talk to Heinry)
:'''Heinry:''' Looks like I'll have to adjust my research direction... Well, not that it's the biggest problem ever...
:{{DIcon}} Any new Fonta flavors available?
:'''Heinry:''' Hello there. Unfortunately... no, I fear.

:{{DIcon}} Alright, I'll do it for the Fonta.
:'''Heinry:''' Splendid! With your aid, I'm yet more certain that we shall succeed. First, let me investigate the destination we're heading to this time.
:'''Heinry:''' Based on the results of my calculations, some of the documents should have landed in this area. I'll mark this "Location 3" on your map...
:'''Heinry:''' Some of my colleagues mentioned that they picked some paper up nearby, and that they also appeared to be office paper commonly used in the Fontaine Research Institute.
:'''Heinry:''' Let's go try our luck... Um, I mean, assess the situation there.
:'''Paimon:''' So, your real feelings have come out, huh...
:{{DIcon}} Might as well try our luck, then.
:{{DIcon}} Might as well go check it out.
:'''Heinry:''' Yes, yes. Come, here's two bottles of Fonta to raise your spirits a bit!
:;(Obtain {{Item|Fonta|x=2}})

;(Talk to Heinry again, optional)
:'''Heinry:''' It's in your hands, Traveler. Do it for the Fonta!

;(Approach the location)
:'''Paimon:''' Where could those materials be? Hmm, maybe they're under the cans? Let's take a look.

;(Pick up the [[Location No. 3 Materials]])
:'''Paimon:''' This should be what Heinry's looking for. Let's take it back to him.

;(Report back to Heinry)
:'''Heinry:''' I can't believe that these documents are so complete, and neither damaged by water or monsters... You truly are my lucky star!
:'''Paimon:''' What state were the previous documents you retrieved in?
:'''Heinry:''' Uh... Let's just say that I'd rather that they were destroyed.
:'''Heinry:''' *cough* Well! Uh, it's very good that we've retrieved these materials, in any case. Give me a moment to study their contents...
:{{Black Screen|Heinry looks through the materials...}}
:'''Heinry:''' This design manuscript states that I once considered changing the base ingredient of Fonta to "tea leaves."
:'''Heinry:''' ...And then I'd release a series of drinks based on different flavors of "tea," before promoting them in the Liyue market.
:'''Paimon:''' Tea flavored Fonta? And you want it in different flavors...? Paimon can't imagine what those would taste like...
:{{DIcon}} Likely bitter.
:{{DIcon}} Apologize to the tea leaves before you start, thanks.
:'''Heinry:''' It even says here that condensed tea extract, syrup, and milk can be added to adjust the flavor.
:'''Paimon:''' That sounds interesting, but Paimon doesn't think this drink has anything to do with Fonta.
:'''Heinry:''' Exactly, and that's why this plan was scrapped &mdash; because "it has nothing to do with our main product."
:'''Heinry:''' However, I've decided to reinstate this plan &mdash; after all, developing a delicious tea-flavored drink might be interesting in its own right.
:'''Heinry:''' However, you did help me retrieve my materials, so I'd like to hear what you have to say on the matter.
:'''Heinry:''' Do you think that I should take the suggestion in this draft on board and try changing the base ingredient of Fonta to tea leaves?
:{{DIcon}} I think we should keep Fonta in its original state.
::'''Heinry:''' Understood. I'll take your word on that first.
::'''Heinry:''' Guess preservation's the way to go.
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to try some carbonated tea, sure.
::'''Heinry:''' Understood. I'll take your word on that first.
::'''Heinry:''' Still, what sort of tea leaves should we use? Guess I should find someone well-versed in this field and ask them...
