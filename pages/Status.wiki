'''Statuses''' can be applied to [[Characters]] and [[Enemies]] to provide relevant effects. If a character is imposed with a buff, arrows surrounding the character will move upward. If a character is imposed with a debuff, arrows surrounding the character will move downward.

Status Effects are primarily broken into four main categories: [[Elements]], [[Ley Line Disorders]], [[Auras]], and [[Climate]] effects. There are also character- and enemy-related status effects.
