:{{A|VO Amir All Schemes to Know 01.ogg}} '''Amir:''' (Did the search and rescue dog run off somewhere? Is the Trainee Forest Ranger doing okay in her job? Do we still have enough medicinal herbs in stock?)

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Amir:''' These guys just love running about when they aren't working.
:'''Amir:''' I hope they pay close attention to [[Collei|that girl's]] condition and report any changes immediately.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Duel
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Amir/Duel: Amir|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Amir:''' Haha, I narrowly won...
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Amir:''' Ah, I thought I was going to win, but I guess I overthought the whole thing, haha...
:{{DIcon}} These guys?
::'''Amir:''' Yeah, these fluffy guys. They just refuse to sit still, and they keep running around and making noise all day.
::'''Amir:''' Luckily, they get serious when it's time for work. Otherwise, I would have taught them another good lesson.
::{{DIcon}} Fluffy... Forest Watchers?
::'''Amir:''' Haha, I think you've misunderstood. I didn't mean my colleagues, I meant these doggies.
::'''Amir:''' They may seem like they're all over the place, but they're actually very reliable. They're good friends and assistants for our forest patrol work.
::'''Amir:''' As for myself, I am responsible for managing and training these search and rescue dogs.
::'''Amir:''' [[Sag]] is my best student, so I appointed it captain of the search and rescue dog team. If you can't find a Forest Watcher or a Forest Ranger, you can ask it for help too.
:{{DIcon}} That girl?
:;(Before finishing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]]{{Verify}})
::'''Amir:''' Oh... She's a Trainee Forest Ranger with us.
::'''Amir:''' She... is in poor health, so she's here to learn and recuperate at the same time.
::'''Amir:''' She's so young yet so eager to excel. I'm still quite worried about her condition.
::'''Amir:''' That's why I asked the search and rescue dogs to pay attention to her condition and notify me immediately if something happens. That's the only way I can be there in time to help her.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I can help too.
:::'''Amir:''' That means a lot to me. Ah, how I wish more kind people like you would join the Forest Rangers.
:::'''Amir:''' By the way, are you heading to [[Avidya Forest]]? If so, let me give you some common herbs that might come in handy.
::;(Obtain [[Nilotpala Lotus]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} So, who's that girl?
:;(After finishing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies{{Verify}})
::'''Amir:''' Oh... She's a Trainee Forest Ranger who's currently stationed with us.
::'''Amir:''' She's only just recovered from a very serious illness, but it seems that she's been trying a bit too hard recently.
::'''Amir:''' She's been all over the shop, so much so that I've started to worry that she might go running off into a storm again just to rescue someone.
::'''Amir:''' That's why I've asked our search and rescue dogs to pay attention to her condition and notify me immediately if something happens. That's the only way that I can be there in time to help her.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} I can help too.
:::'''Amir:''' That means a lot to me. Ah, how I wish more kind people like you would join the Forest Rangers.
:::'''Amir:''' By the way, are you heading to [[Avidya Forest]]? If so, let me give you some common herbs that might come in handy.

:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Amir:''' Goodbye. Safe travels.
