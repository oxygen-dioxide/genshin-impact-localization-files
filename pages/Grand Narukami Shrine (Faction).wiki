The {{Lang|'''Grand Narukami Shrine'''|ja=鳴神大社|ja_rm=Narukami Ooyashiro}} is a religious organization that worships the [[Electro Archon]] and leads the Narukami people's faith. It is based at the shrine of the same name located at the peak of [[Mt. Yougou]].

==Overview==
[[Yae Miko]] is the head of the Shrine and is considered the most experienced member.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia}}</ref> The use of military force is not permitted around the areas of the Grand Narukami Shrine as it dishonors the Shogun herself, thus the shrine is not under the jurisdiction of the [[Shogunate]] but still under the authority of the Electro Archon whom the shrine worships.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Servant's Path}}</ref>

The Shrine has several responsibilities which includes assisting visitors who come to the shrine to pray to the Electro Archon, protecting the [[Sacred Sakura]] and the [[Thunder Sakura]], as well as performing rituals and ceremonial affairs, such as the [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual]]. According to [[Inagi Hotomi]], many of the visitors pray for the [[Sakoku Decree]] to be lifted as it has caused them economic hardship.
