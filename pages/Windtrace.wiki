'''Windtrace''' is a [[Recurring Event]]. It is a classic [[Mondstadt]] game, handed down throughout its history.

==Basic Gameplay==
Players shall be split into two sides: the Rebels, members of the ancient resistance, and a Hunter sent by the ancient aristocracy, who will then have a contest of wits in the Contested Zones.

The Hunter's task is to capture all the Rebels, while the Rebels must constantly move and hide to avoid the Hunter until the danger has passed. If the Hunter dies or drowns during the event, the Rebels get victory, and if a Rebel dies or drowns during the event, it counts as a capture.

This event can be found under [[File:Icon Windtrace.svg|30x30px]] map icon.

In the first run of the Windtrace event, players could use [[alternate sprint]]s to hide. That has since been disabled in the second run of the Windtrace event.

==Trivia==
* Windtrace is inspired by the times of when the [[City of Mondstadt]] was ruled by the [[Mondstadt Aristocracy]]. Citizens formed an underground resistance, and the aristocrats retaliated with their own henchmen.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Gygax}}</ref>
* [[Tubby]], after learning about Windtrace from the [[Traveler]], made a hide-and-seek game inspired by it: [[Leisure Device: Confused Confuzzlement]].
