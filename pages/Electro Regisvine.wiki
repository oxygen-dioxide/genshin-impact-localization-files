* The Weak Point is only exposed after the player has destroyed the shield at its corolla once. However, unlike the Pyro and Cryo Regisvines, the corolla's appearance does not change when the Weak Point is exposed.

==Abilities==
''Most ability names are unofficial.''
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = State Shift
|desc_1 = Upon entering battle, the Electro Regisvine will form a [[Shields/Enemy|shield]] (core) at its corolla. The shield will periodically shift positions between the Regisvine's corolla and roots. If the shield is destroyed, the regisvine will be stunned for a long period of time with lowered [[Resistance]]s.<br>Every time the shield shifts positions, a Waning Stamen or Waxing Stamen will be produced which can be destroyed using [[Elemental Reactions]]. When producing the Waxing Stamen, it deals '''40% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} while Waning Stamen deals '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}. If both types of Stamens are present on the battlefield, they will attract each other and cause a massive explosion, dealing '''300% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} across the entire arena.

{{Description|A giant plant that violently releases electric charges stored within the [[Ley Line]]s.<br>Electro awakens plants and boosts soil fertility. If the Regisvine was indeed created to harmonize the turbulent energies of the Ley Lines, then it might be the earth's wish to see the presence of lush forests in Sumeru.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}
{{Description|A huge vine that has morphed into a monster through the conduction of high-voltage currents through the Ley Lines.<br>Electricity surges constantly from its canopy like the unending rage of the earth itself.<br>[[Kshahrewar]] researchers once submitted that a complex circuit matrix might be set up around this creature to carry electrical energy to the city for use there. This plan was stridently opposed by scholars from [[Spantamad]], who sacrificed 10 [[Shroomboar]]s to drive home the point about the dangers of utilizing electricity.|[[Archive]]}}
