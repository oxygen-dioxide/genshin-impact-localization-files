{{Enemy Intro}}
They might ambush players walking too close to inactive [[Thunder Sakura Bough]]s, and activate them when defeated. They may spawn if their mimic plants are picked.

==Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Burrow:''' Sinks into the ground and emerges nearby.
*'''Ambush:''' If the player interacts with a disguised Electro Whopperflower, bursts from the ground, dealing '''300% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.
*'''Spin:''' If the player is within melee range, flattens while spinning its petals to deal '''50% ATK * 3''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} around itself.
*'''Normal Attack: Orb Lay:''' Lobs out 3 orbs next to it that stay on the ground for a few seconds, dealing '''33% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} on landing and '''10% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} to players that come in contact.
*'''Charged Attack: Focused Laser:''' Closes its petals, consuming one of the "fruits" orbiting around it and creating a {{Electro}} [[Shields|shield]], giving it ~5 seconds to charge up its attack. If allowed to fully charge, it will bend over, point its top at the player, and charge up a laser blast that explodes 4 times, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} with each hit; however, the shield can be broken to prevent its attack and stun the Whopperflower for ~15 seconds.
*'''Recharge:''' Once all three "fruits" are consumed, the Whopperflower will burrow into the ground and restore all three creating a visual AoE but will not deal any damage.

==Strategy==
*Their shields can be destroyed by any form of damage, but {{Hydro}}, {{Cryo}} and {{Pyro}} can destroy their shields the quickest through the [[Electro-Charged]], [[Superconduct]] and [[Overloaded]] reactions respectively. They are not immune to any form of damage when they do not have their shields.
