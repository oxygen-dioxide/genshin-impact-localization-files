{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Burrow
|desc_1 = Sinks into the ground and emerges nearby.

|name_2 = Ambush
|desc_2 = If the player interacts with a disguised Electro Whopperflower, bursts from the ground, dealing '''300% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.

|name_5 = Charged Attack: Focused Laser
|desc_5 = Closes its petals, consuming one of the "fruits" orbiting around it and creating a {{Electro}} [[Shields|shield]], giving it ~5 seconds to charge up its attack.

Upon impact, the laser will cause a forward line of 4 sequential explosions, each dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} with each hit; however, the shield can be broken to prevent its attack and stun the Whopperflower for ~15 seconds.
