==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''"Mural Maniac":''' Our membership has expanded too fast. We have to think of a way to solve our expense problem as soon as we can...
:{{DIcon}} How do you do...
::'''"Mural Maniac":''' Oh, a new face.
::'''"Mural Maniac":''' Welcome to the Graffiti Alliance HQ... It might just look like a normal house, but still!
::'''"Mural Maniac":''' If you're looking for one or more of our members, I regret to inform you that a couple hundred of them are busy painting all over Natlan, while others are busy managing their lives.
::'''"Mural Maniac":''' They only visit HQ to pay membership fees, or when seeking out technical assistance.
::'''"Mural Maniac":''' Anyone from Natlan you see holding a spray can and paint bucket is probably one of ours.
::'''"Mural Maniac":''' If you want to visit, feel free to do so any time.
::'''"Mural Maniac":''' But you won't find any of our alliance members' exquisite masterpieces here &mdash; those are scattered all over Natlan.
::{{DIcon}} May I join the alliance, too?
::'''"Mural Maniac":''' Sure. Henceforth, you're a member.
::'''"Mural Maniac":''' I'll note your name down later.
::'''"Mural Maniac":''' Don't look so surprised. There's no testing or ceremony for new entrants. So long as you're interested in graffiti, you can join up.
::'''"Mural Maniac":''' If you need any help, you can always ask your fellow alliance members.
::'''"Mural Maniac":''' Just remember to give us a shoutout to others once you're out there throwing up your mad masterpieces.
:{{DIcon}} Expenses?
::'''"Mural Maniac":''' A thousand Mora to each person each year &mdash; that's what goes into training up new members of our Alliance.
::'''"Mural Maniac":''' Outsiders have told us that art from other places attaches great importance to heritage.
::'''"Mural Maniac":''' So my master's master's master's... master from Archon-only-knows how many generations ago, that person created this membership fee system.
::'''"Mural Maniac":''' We put these dues toward buying lots of paints and spray paint tools so that we can give keen joiners free lessons...
::'''"Mural Maniac":''' That spread the popularity of graffiti and got more people into it.
::'''"Mural Maniac":''' However, the fees haven't changed for hundreds of years. Nowadays, it's not enough to cover our expenses.
::'''"Mural Maniac":''' Perhaps I could take some orders for portraits, earn some royalties, and beef up our expenses fund...?
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it, then!
::'''"Mural Maniac":''' You're too kind... If you need anything, come find me any time!
