:'''Kageyama:''' Do you need anything?

;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Kageyama:''' This is the identification checkpoint under the jurisdiction of the Outlander Affairs Agency.
::'''Kageyama:''' Any outlander who wishes to stay temporarily at Ritou must have an Entry Permit ready. If you are looking to stay for longer, you also need a Resident Permit.
::'''Kageyama:''' If you don't have these permits, we can't really make an exception for you...
::{{DIcon}} About the procedure for going to [[Narukami Island]]...
:::'''Kageyama:''' If you wish to travel to Narukami Island, you need a Travel Permit. According to procedure, you must apply for it at the headquarters of the Outlander Affairs Agency...
::;(Before completing [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]])
::::'''Kageyama:''' ... However, if you don't have any special connections, it might be very difficult to apply for it.
::::'''Kageyama:''' Yup, that's about it... I can't really say anything more than this. Please understand.
::;(After completing Omnipresence Over Mortals)
::::'''Kageyama:''' In the past, if you didn't have any special connections, it might be very difficult to apply for it.
::::'''Kageyama:''' Nowadays, all the affairs of Kanjou Commission are strictly supervised, so visitors should be able to apply for the Travel Pass easily as long as they prepare the required materials.
::{{DIcon}} So if I want to meet the [[Hiiragi Shinsuke|Kanjou Commissioner]]...
:::'''Kageyama:''' If you wish to seek audience with the Kanjou Commissioner, you may send your name card to the headquarters of the Outlander Affairs Agency.
:::'''Kageyama:''' The inspector at headquarters will pick out a guest worthy of meeting the Commissioner based on the status and causes of the applicants.
:::'''Kageyama:''' That being said, you'd better give up on that idea if you're a commoner. Generally, outlanders won't have the opportunity to meet the Commissioner.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Kageyama:''' Goodbye! Please stay safe.

;(After completing Transient Dreams)
:{{DIcon}} What's this place?
::'''Kageyama:''' This is the identification checkpoint under the jurisdiction of the Outlander Affairs Agency.
::'''Kageyama:''' With the abolition of the Sakoku Decree, the number of people entering and exiting Ritou has gradually increased, while the number of people coming to apply for short-term residential permits and goods exchange permits has increased as well.
::'''Kageyama:''' But since our restrictions are no longer so stringent, processing these applications has become a far smoother process. Oftentimes, only the most basic of documentation is required, thus resulting in the process being completed the very same day.
::{{DIcon}} About the procedure for going to Inazuma City...
:::'''Kageyama:''' According to the Almighty Shogun's edict, both Inazumans and outsiders may freely enter Inazuma City.
:::'''Kageyama:''' However, we are still to conduct necessary examinations at checkpoints, just to be safe.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Kageyama:''' Goodbye! Please stay safe.
