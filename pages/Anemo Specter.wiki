{{Description|A monster birthed from a high concentration of Anemo that can float in the air.<br />As reason might dictate, monsters made from coalesced Anemo already come equipped with the ability to float. As such, their petal-like wings are most likely to be a mimetic organ first and foremost.|[[Archive]]}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Fury:''' Taking high DMG from a single attack will charge Fury. The higher the DMG dealt, the more Fury will be accumulated. When they have a full Fury bar, they will grow bigger and gain access to enhanced attacks.<table class="fandom-table"><tr><th>DMG Taken (%Max HP)</th><th>Fury Accumulated (%)</th></tr><tr><td>18.75-31.25</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>31.25-43.75</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>43.75-56.25</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>56.25+</td><td>100</td></tr></table>
* '''Wind Blast:''' Shoots two consecutive homing wind bolts that each deals '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DMG}}. If at max Fury, instead shoots three non-homing bolts in a spread pattern, each dealing '''125% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DMG}} and becomes its only attack.
* '''Puff Blow:''' Spins, puffs up, then releases a {{not a typo|swirl}} of wind dealing '''125% ATK''' as {{Color|[[AoE]] Anemo DMG}}.
* '''Final Burst:''' Explodes after a short pause when defeated dealing '''125% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Anemo DMG}}. If at max Fury, DMG is increased to '''150% ATK''', and leaves behind a [[Vacuum Field]] for 10 seconds that sucks in players and items while dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DoT}}.

===Ability Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if they meet all of the following conditions:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Certain abilities with extra trigger conditions may defy regular ability logic.
