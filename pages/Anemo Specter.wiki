|name_2 = Wind Blast
|desc_2 = Shoots two consecutive homing wind bolts that each deals '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DMG}}. If at max Fury, instead shoots three non-homing bolts in a spread pattern, each dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DMG}} and becomes its only attack.

|name_4 = Final Burst
|desc_4 = Explodes after a short pause when defeated dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Anemo DMG}}. If at max Fury, DMG is increased to '''120% ATK''', and leaves behind a [[Vacuum Field]] for 10 seconds that sucks in players and items while dealing '''40% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DoT}}.

===AI Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Certain abilities with extra trigger conditions may defy regular ability logic.

{{Description|A monster birthed from a high concentration of Anemo that can float in the air.<br />As reason might dictate, monsters made from coalesced Anemo already come equipped with the ability to float. As such, their petal-like wings are most likely to be a mimetic organ first and foremost.|[[Archive]]}}
