==Profile==
Xavier, along with a group of other experts from Fontaine, helped maintain the [[Mikage Furnace]] for the [[Shogun's Army]] to produce Jade Steel using the power of [[Tatarigami]]. Xavier opted to stay behind in order to film the furnace at action in the hopes of promoting Fontaine's technology, but the furnace went critical and he was forced to develop a containment dome to stop the energy from leaking out. He could not do anything as the [[Tenryou Commission]] were too busy to handle his request. He also taught the people at [[Higi Village]] how to make [[Imported Poultry]].

Eventually, the [[Traveler]] came along and discovered that the [[Fatui]] had taken an interest in the Tatarigami. Xavier was alarmed at what they would do it, and fast-tracked a device to purify the energy. Thanks to the Traveler, he was able to purify the furnace, preventing the Fatui from getting their hands on the Tatarigami energy unless they wanted to cause a war with the Tenryou Commission.

After the incident, Xavier resumed his intentions of creating movies in Inazuma, starting with "Tatara Tales" to re-enact the Traveler's fight against the Fatui. He also began production of another film, "The Seventh Samurai," which was accepted by the [[Tenryou Commission]] as they believed it would help increase the Shogunate's prestige.

During the [[Roses and Muskets]] event, Xavier returned to Fontaine to participate in the [[Fontinalia Film Festival]] and to produce a film named "[[The Two Musketeers]]," but he ran into many problems such as struggling to fund the film due to losing his investor, [[Morris]]. [[Kamisato Ayato]] and [[Kamisato Ayaka]] were invited to be leads in the film, and they decided to act for free as they see the trip as a part of cultural exchange. [[Chiori]] also offered to help in exchange of good exposure for her brand. He was also able to convince [[Furina]] to join the team as a director after he explained his problems. The Traveler, Paimon, [[Yoimiya]], and [[Chevreuse]] also helps him during the production process. Despite Morris trying to sabotage his film production, Xavier eventually managed to finish the film. After winning the Furina Award, he decided to establish his own film company, Musketeer Pictures.

<!-- this section is also transcluded from Toranosuke's page -->
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After completing "The Seventh Samurai")
:'''Toranosuke:''' Mr. Xavier, do we need to keep filming?
:'''Xavier:''' But of course! There are so many more topics out there waiting for us!
:{{DIcon}} Are you guys still "filming"?
::'''Xavier:''' Ahh... If it isn't you, my gallant {{MC|hero|heroine|mc=1}}!
::'''Xavier:''' I'm discussing what to film next with this soldier over here.
::'''Xavier:''' I want to document the legends of the tanuki and the kitsune. But as for our good soldier...
::'''Toranosuke:''' Well, I recommend that you head into the city and capture the might of our samurai on film, Mr. Xavier.
::{{DIcon}} So, have you guys reached a conclusion?
::'''Xavier:''' Hmm... I suppose we've reached a common understanding after ample discussion.
::'''Xavier:''' And that is to... make a "film" that includes both elements.
::'''Xavier:''' The story I have in my head is that of a samurai slaying monsters and demons in Inazuma in ages past!
::'''Xavier:''' And of course, there shall also be the most quintessential elements of love and comedy...
::'''Xavier:''' However, this is just a preliminary thought. I still have much material to gather.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Xavier:''' Alright then. Farewell, my fair {{MC|hero|heroine|mc=1}}, I wish you only the best of luck!
