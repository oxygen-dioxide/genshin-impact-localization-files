'''New Year's Cheer''' is a 4-Star [[Character Outfit]] for [[Xiangling]].

During [[Version 5.3]], New Year's Cheer was obtainable for free as a reward from the [[Springtime Charms]] [[event]]. In [[Version 5.4]], it became purchasable in the Character Outfit Shop for the cost of {{Item|Genesis Crystal|25|x=1,680}}.

==Appearance==
Xiangling's bangs are layered and slightly swept to one side, with two braided pig-tails at the back. She wears a yellow beanie hat with bulges resembling panda ears, with several pins attached to the brim.

Xiangliang wears a black long sleeved romper with [[Guoba]]-inspired neckline details. On top is a red overcoat lined with golden lapels; cuffs and a sailor collar made of white fur. Behind, the coat has cross-straps for a pinched waistline, with a white pom-pom in the center. The coat is fastened by two [[wikipedia:Frog (fastening)|frogs]] at the front. She also wears a detachable collar, a small bag with Guoba graphics, and a leather garter belt on her right thigh, where her {{Pyro}} [[Vision]] is fixated. 

Her accessories include many food-themed pins all over the coat, yellow ombre nails, knitted socks, white legwarmers, and loafers with golden soles.

==Description==
The seasons turned, the days grew chill, and every store on [[Chihu Rock]] prepared for the new season.<br><!--
-->Down went the cooling short garments at the clothing stores, and up went the velvet-quilt coats and fur-lined dresses.<br><!--
-->Xiangling, who had just begun putting on winter clothes, thought then that [[Wanmin Restaurant]], too, should switch up seasonal flavors.<br><!--
-->Cooling bean soups were out, of course, but she had yet to think of what to make for the new season.<br><!--
-->Logic dictates that a person's diet should match the time of year. Icy for hot weather, spicy in cold climes.<br><!--
-->And on days when hearts frigid grow like falling flakes of snow, all long for a nice hot and hearty bowl.<br><!--
-->What warms the mouth, warms the heart in turn, after all.<br><!--
-->And when one speaks of hearty warmth, a hot pot comes to mind. Yes, mutton hotpot. Why not?<br><!--
-->A bowl of delicious mutton soup and the company of close friends is the best way to end the year, after all.<br><!--
-->And if she could satisfy her own picky taste buds, surely the customers, too, would be pleased.<br><br><!--
-->And in truth, the ingredients needed for said soup were quite simple. Indeed, a friend of hers had already volunteered to buy them at her behest.<br><!--
-->The difficult part was mixing the dipping sauce. This she would see to in person.<br><!--
-->Of course, [[Guoba]] was welcome to help if he was interested. They could have some mutton soup together later.<br><!--
-->The thick sauces, readied all-year round on the stove, must first be thinned a little, then mixed in homemade shrimp oil, before being mixed with cooled boiled water.<br><!--
-->The small leafy veggies she diced, before Guoba mulched them and the condiments into a paste, which she then poured into the sauce bowl alongside the fermented tofu &mdash; the latter a Wanmin secret recipe.<br><!--
-->Brown, green, red... Many flavors filled the bowl, together forming the warmest memory from every winter.<br><!--
-->Ah, but not so fast &mdash; it is a Wanmin Restaurant tradition to pour on a spoonful of fried-on-the-spot [[Jueyun Chili]] oil atop the fresh seasoning mix.<br><!--
-->The chilis themselves must be dried and de-seeded before boiling vegetable oil is poured onto them, and in a flash, forth pours a fragrant spiciness.<br><!--
-->And with that spoonful of chili oil, the mutton hotpot sauce is ready.<br><!--
-->Of course, such strong and appetizing smells are to kick up some steam &mdash; Xiangling and Guoba were barely able to stifle a simultaneous sneeze.<br><!--
-->Oh, when was [[Hu Tao]] coming back with the meat? She could barely wait to get this hotpot started!
