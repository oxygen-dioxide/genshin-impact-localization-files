|text      = Not long ago, a traveling merchant from afar set up camp near Aaru Village to sell rare gems and jewelry. Having confirmed their honest intentions, I should have politely declined their various recommendations and simply left right away...

But, when the maroon light of the augite caught my eye, I couldn't help but recall the legends my grandfather once told me as a child...

Today, the fires of war have been buried by the drifting sands, and the long-suffering desert folk have finally begun to lead stable, peaceful lives.

If you would like to hear more, please visit me in the village. Let these beautiful stones be my witness; through them, I will tell you the stories of what once was in this desert.
