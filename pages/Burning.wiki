{{Elemental Reaction Intro|element1=Pyro|element2=Dendro}}

Burning will apply a Burning aura, which appears as an animated version of the Pyro aura and will coexist with the underlying [[Pyro]] and [[Dendro]] auras. The Dendro aura will be steadily consumed while burning. The Burning state requires both the Burning and Dendro auras to maintain, and will end if one of them is depleted.

Currently, players can only burn if they are inflicted with Dendro from a [[Dendro Samachurl]] or a poison status from a [[Large Dendro Slime]] and Pyro from another source. This damage is separate from the damage taken when standing on burning grass without being affected by Dendro.

{{Transformative Reaction Damage}}

==Environment==
Note that in the open world, grass, haystacks, shrubs, small trees, crates, and barrels are all Dendro objects. Using Pyro abilities on them will ignite them as well as the surrounding area. After being burnt, grass will be charred and cannot be burned again until the area resets, while shrubs and trees will be temporarily destroyed. Units that are Burning will also spread fire to combustible objects that they touch such as grass.

The amount of {{Color|Pyro DMG}} dealt to player by a fire depends on the player's [[World Level]]. At its minimum, Burning deals 2 {{Color|Pyro DMG}} every half second, and at its maximum, fire deals 100 {{Color|Pyro DMG}} every half second. If a [[Dendro]] construct like [[grass]] is set on fire, it will extinguish after the status expires or once it comes into contact with Electro, Cryo, or Hydro.

==Artifacts==
These artifact sets increase the damage from Burning reactions.
