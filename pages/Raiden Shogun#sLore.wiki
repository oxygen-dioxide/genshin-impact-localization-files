{{Quote|The Raiden Shogun is the awesome and terrible power of thunder incarnate, the exalted ruler of the Inazuma Shogunate.<br />
With the might of lightning at her disposal, she commits herself to the solitary pursuit of eternity.|Description from the Official Website<ref>Official ''Genshin Impact'' Website: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/character/inazuma?char=4 Raiden Shogun]</ref>}}

==Personality==
{{Quote|Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, who promised the people of Inazuma an unchanging Eternity.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}

The Raiden Shogun is a firm believer of what she believes to be eternity &mdash; a place in which everything is kept the same, regardless of what goes on. She is honorable in her conduct and is revered by the people of Inazuma.

The Raiden Shogun exists in two forms &mdash; [[Ei]], her true identity, and [[the Shogun]], a puppet created by Ei to oversee Inazuma in her stead while she meditates in the [[Plane of Euthymia]]. This puppet follows a set of directives programmed into her, which are extremely difficult to modify. The Shogun is cold and stern in personality, even callous at times; she is limited in emotional expression, has no likes and dislikes, and has no need for recreation.<ref name="traverse">{{Ref/Quest|To Traverse the Mortal Plane}}</ref> The Shogun thinks of herself as Ei's assistant<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Lonesome Euthymia}}</ref> and carries out her creator's exact will, unable to act on her own volition. If her usual functions are disabled, the Shogun becomes ineffectual. Due to limited protocols as a result of Ei's initial indifference towards anything other than "eternity", the puppet is able to be manipulated by external influences. For example, the [[Kujou Clan]] and [[Fatui]] persuaded her into initiating and maintaining the [[Vision Hunt Decree]].

While Ei has a more stern demeanor than the average person, she is notably more emotive and sociable than the Shogun. Unlike the Shogun, Ei has preferences, such as a love for sweets and passion of martial arts. Due to her dedication to eternity, Ei maintains a wary attitude on the idea of change. However, she demonstrates curiosity rather than disdain towards new affairs, such as the appearance of the [[Traveler]]<ref name="servant">{{Ref/Quest|The Servant's Path}}</ref> and the customs of the modern world.<ref name="traverse" /> Due to having lost many of her loved ones over the centuries, Ei is driven by a fear of further loss     wanting to preserve Inazuma. To this end, she previously sealed herself in the Plane of Euthymia to keep herself from the effects of erosion. She created the puppet Shogun to ensure immunity from the decay of her physical body.<ref name="servant" /> While in the Plane of Euthymia, Ei was indifferent to anything that did not affect her pursuit of eternity and had a low opinion of human ambition due to it resulting in loss and suffering. Thus, making it incompatible with eternity.<ref name="omnipresent">{{Ref/Quest|The Omnipresent God}}</ref> While in the Plane of Euthymia she was not unmoved by loneliness, as Ei is shown enjoying Yae Miko<ref name="omnipresent" /> and the Traveler's company.

In spite of her flawed actions, Ei is devoted to Inazuma, simply longing to protect it and her people. After she is convinced that her actions were destructive, Ei shows remorse and is willing to change her perspective regarding eternity to become a better ruler. She also gained a newfound respect for the idea of human ambition and it's achievements.

==Official Introduction==
===[https://www.hoyolab.com/article/587499 Eschew the Ephemeral World. Abide in Unchanging Eternity.]===
{{Quote|Her Excellency seeks to rid herself of the mundane delusions of the world, but only in an attempt to overcome the cycle of life and death. No one truly understands her, yet she does not deign to make herself understood... Her Excellency the Shogun is simply full of contradictions.|[[Kitsune Saiguu]]}}

The undisputed supreme ruler of Inazuma.

Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, promised the people of Inazuma an unchanging eternity to last throughout the ages.

After purging all sentiment with merciless lightning, the solitude of her mind became a secluded space free from mortal joys and woes...

Over the long years, the road to eternity has been dark and desolate, but Her Excellency the Shogun has never wavered, not even for a moment.

For true unchanging eternity is found only in the stillness that manifests itself when all noise is stripped away.

However, Ei also had moments of repose away from battle, sitting with her friends under the sakura trees and playing karuta.</p><p>Due to her character, Ei was always the most wooden player. She was never the final victor, nor did she ever have a taste of the prizes that the Kitsune Saiguu reserved for the winners.</p><p>Thus, she poured the effort that she put into swordsmanship into karuta practice, often pestering Makoto or [[Mikoshi Chiyo]] to karuta matches, or spending much time by moonlight reading the poetry inscribed on the cards out loud.</p><p>At last, the day came that under the sakura trees, Ei would defeat opponent after opponent. Even the mighty [[tengu]] would be felled after a hard-fought battle, and thus was she crowned the champion.</p><p>Ei let out a victorious whoop at her victory, only to be greeted by the sounds of her friends' laughter. Only then did she realize that she had lost her usual composure entirely, before snapping both arms back down and reverting to her usual cool facade.</p><p> Of course, her friends did not intend to make sport of her. Indeed, they understood her character and the manner in which she had worked ever so hard to come out on top.</p><p>As for the [[Kitsune Saiguu]], oh, how amused she looked as she presented Ei with some pastries.</p><p>"I said it was a reward, yes, but it was simply some hand-made cakes of mine. I didn't think that you would be so concerned about it, Ei. Well then, enjoy the spoils of your victory to your heart's content."</p><p>Ei was hardly one to be greedy for snacks. But as a samurai, she firmly believed that what she lost must be reclaimed. These pastries were more akin to a vindication of her desire to win.</p><p>&mdash;But it was not long before that cool demeanor of hers broke into a smile again. The cakes were lovely &mdash; just like the taste of victory. As for her clumsy attempts to hide that smile, one could only say that it was an entertaining sight all around for her friends.</p><p>To this day, Ei still often remembers that sakura tree.</p><p>...Even though she has not gone to see it in a long time, and even though no one sits under it anymore, she wishes that time might stop forever.</p>

Instead, Makoto's energies were focused on the present.</p><p>"It is precisely because we know that this scene is but a fleeting shadow that we should enjoy it all the more."</p><p>Then, Ei could only smile wryly, realizing that she, the kagemusha, was even more old-fashioned than the real Raiden Shogun.

Is that so?"</p><p>"Do you presently have some new ideas, or have you, too, fallen victim to inexorable 'erosion'?"</p><p>Their faces were the same, but they spoke of different ideals. [[Farewell to the Past|The battle with herself, with her past, would come someday.]]</p><p>But it was not this day.

==Trivia==
* The Raiden Shogun is one of the characters with ornaments that glow. {{Transclude|Narukami's Law|Glowing Ornaments|section=1}}
* {{Transclude|Narukami's Law|Projection of Elemental Symbol|section=1}}
* Unlike [[Venti]] or [[Zhongli]], whose constellation names follow the form of {{Lang|"~ Dei"|la=<wbr>|la_tl=~ of God}}, Raiden Shogun's constellation name does not follow this pattern. This is because both Venti and Zhongli are part of the original [[The Seven|Seven]], while Ei is not, as she originally took the role of the [[Makoto|original Electro Archon]]'s kagemusha.
** As she directly governs Inazuma, everyone is also aware of her identity, a stark contrast to Venti and Zhongli in which only few people know of their true identities.
* Beyond simple fear of loosing those closest to her, it is hinted that Ei's obsession with a never-changing eternity is to prevent Inazuma from suffering the same fate as [[Khaenri'ah]] as a result of the '[[Celestia|Heavenly Principles]]'.
* She is the second character to be both a playable character and a boss, with the first being [[Tartaglia|Childe]].
** She is also the first [[Archon]] to be fought as a boss, although only twice in the story domain [[Plane of Euthymia]].
* The Raiden Shogun is proficient in two weapons &mdash; [[swords]] and [[polearms]], using the former as part of her [[Musou no Hitotachi]] and the latter, which was the [[Engulfing Lightning]], during the player's fight against her in [[Amidst Stormy Judgment]] and later, [[The Omnipresent God]]. She shares this trait with many other prominent Inazumans.<ref group="Note">[[Gorou]] and [[Kujou Sara]] are mentioned to have used swords despite using bows as their primary weapons, while [[Kamisato Ayato]] is mentioned to use both swords and polearms.</ref>
* She is the first [[Wishes#Character Event Wishes|event-exclusive]] [[character]] whose element is {{Electro}}.
* She is the first character to slay a [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers|Fatui Harbinger]].
* She is loosely based on [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Raiden Mei|Raiden Mei]] from ''Houkai Gakuen 2'' and ''{{w|Honkai Impact 3rd}}'', as the two share a plethora of connections:
** The two harness the power of lightning (Electro).
** Raiden Shogun's real name, "Raiden Ei" is similar to Raiden Mei's name.
** They are both voiced by Juhuahua in Chinese and {{w|Miyuki Sawashiro}} in Japanese.
** They are very similar in appearance, with both having long purple hair and purple eyes.
** Raiden Mei is the 3rd Herrscher (Herrscher of Thunder) while the Raiden Shogun is the third among the Seven Archons to appear.
** In one of the Online Honkai Mangas, There is a chapter called "The Wrath of Baal," where it shows Mei's first appearance as the Herrscher of Thunder.
* The Raiden Shogun's Japanese voice actress, Miyuki Sawashiro, has a couple of roles that share a few traits with Ei:
** Kirari and Ririka Momobami are twins from the anime series ''Kakegurui'', just like Ei and Makoto who are also twins and are both voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro.
** Kaiser de Emperana Beelzebub IV from the anime series ''Beelzebub'' is a demon baby who can electrocute anyone when he's upset. Ei's Archon name is Beelzebub and can control lightning.
** Bishamon from the anime series ''Noragami'' is a goddess of war and also has many names. She is a member of the Seven Gods of Fortune and has purple eyes. In mythology, Bishamon is said to be male much like Beelzebub (Ei's archon name).  Ei is a member of The Seven Archons of Teyvat and also has purple eyes.
* Raiden Shogun on release had no indicator on-model to indicate Elemental Burst charge (aside from a change to the Resolve Stack Circle). This was later added, but it is too subtle to notice.
** In the Serenitea Pot, the model for Raiden Shogun does not glow until completing [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]].
** Raiden Shogun does not have Electro particle spillover effects, nor does the Electro symbol project big, when her Elemental Burst is ready.
* The tip of Raiden Shogun's hair glows when she uses her Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst. This seems to be a trait shared with other Archon characters.
* Raiden Shogun is one of two characters who does not have a visible breath when exposed to [[Sheer Cold]] in [[Dragonspine]], owing to her nature as a puppet; the other character with this distinction is the [[Wanderer]].
*The Raiden Shogun is the first major character to kill another, that being her act of executing [[La Signora]] after she is defeated by the Traveler in the Duel Before the Throne.
* Raiden Shogun is also known by these aliases or titles:
** Narukami Ogosho
** Master of the Euthymic Plane
** Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, God of Thunder
