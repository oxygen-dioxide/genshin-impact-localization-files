{{Quote|A magician's assistant hidden in the shadows who refers to herself as a "Multi-Function Magic Assistant." Poker-faced, reticent to speak, and as unpredictable in her movements as a cat.|Description from the Official Website<ref>Official Genshin Impact Website: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/character/Fontaine?char=1 Lynette]</ref>}}
==Personality==
{{Quote|A magic assistant of few words, her emotions are as inscrutable as any cat's.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}

Compared to her siblings [[Lyney]] and [[Freminet]], Lynette is the most reserved of the three. She rarely talks to others out of her own accord, letting Lyney do the talking for her, and dissuades essentially any attempt to speak with her by saying bizarre responses. Whenever she needs to talk, she speaks briefly and frankly.

Due to a rare case of atavism, Lynette has feline features and traits, such as enjoying fish. She also has a habit of breaking and/or damaging machines, resulting her not using them frequently. Lynette enjoys making and drinking tea, though her sensitive tongue results in her having to cool it down first before drinking.

As a result of her traumatic past with Lyney, Lynette does not trust most people lest they take advantage of them, seeing her brother as a truth in a world full of lies and falsehoods. Like Lyney, she keeps her ties with the Fatui discreet.

==Appearance==

<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3-4 sentences. Outfits should be described on the outfit pages. -->
Lynette uses the [[:Category:Medium Female Characters|medium female]] model. She is a young woman with violet eyes, pale skin, and ash blonde hair tied into a low, thin ponytail which extends down her back. She has blunt bangs swept to her left, a short braid along the right side of her head, and two sections of hair which frame her face, curling inwards towards her chin. Additionally, she has cat-like ears, and a cat's tail. She also has a small, dark brown star-shaped mark on her left cheek, mirroring her brother's teardrop mark on his opposite cheek.

{{Quote|That's already the fifth time this month... Haven't you learned not to mess with Lynette?|Words muttered by Freminet to a vacuum cleaner, overheard by Lyney as he left his room in the dead of night.}}
In direct contrast to her older brother, who refers to himself as "the greatest magician in all Teyvat", Lynette might possibly be the lowest-profile Magician's Assistant in the land.

She seeks neither flowers nor applause, avoids interviews, and generally tries to avoid notice.

Whether people are trying to attract her attention or simply curious, she shuts them out with bizarre responses like "Entering Standby Mode" and "I need to space out."

Even when bigwigs from the audience pay them a private visit, Lynette always takes a back seat and lets Lyney do the talking. She prefers to brew a pot of tea and sit in the corner, looking down as she quietly sips away, apparently uninterested by the conversation.

Only the very few among them, in the briefest of interludes, sense for a millisecond that they are being secretly watched. But by the time they try to locate the source of the gaze, it has already vanished without a trace.

Yet the only other people in the room are Lyney – warm and hospitable as ever – and Lynette, whose undivided attention is being bestowed upon a teacup.

...Perhaps it was just their imagination.

...But even if not, what harm could a quick glance have done? It's not like they could have seen anything of any significance... could they?

{{Quote|You needn't fret, nor should you feel like you have to change your own habits. But you should know that genuine understanding can only be found, not sought. A true companion is someone who can read your 'signals.|[[Arlecchino]]}}
In their little team of three at the Hotel Bouffes d'ete, Lynette plays an essential role in making sure that their work runs smoothly. When Lyney's bold nature clashes with Freminet's cautiousness, instead of taking sides, Lynette stands back and analyzes the situation in a calm and collected manner. She resolves their disputes by helping them find a middle ground.

She's generally very quiet and is in the habit of constantly observing other members of her "family." If Lyney accidentally cut his finger in the middle of a performance, or Freminet suddenly looked downcast, Lynette would make a mental note of it. When she had a suitable opportunity, she'd be there with a bandage or a cup of tea.

She loves her "family" and her "family" love her. Waking up by the fireplace, she's become accustomed to the familiar sight of Lyney at the table practicing card tricks and Freminet cleaning the living room. It was in such a moment that she suddenly realized how long it had been since the memory of those sleepless nights of fearful anticipation had vanished — just like a lump of coal that had burned itself into oblivion.

              --><p>Desperate, Lynette grabbed onto a floating piece of wood, and by sheer dint of will managed to drag her unconscious brother to shore, coughing up water as she struggled on.</p><!--
              --><p>Fighting the searing pain in her lungs, she checked his condition in a panic. He was deathly pale, his eyes squeezed shut &mdash; there was none of his usual vitality to be seen.</p><!--
              --><p>She hugged him tightly to prevent his temperature from dropping further, even as she surveyed her surroundings. The forest was dark, and in that lightless night the twisted trees seemed ever more malevolent.</p><!--
              --><p>She called his name softly, hoping that he might stand up again with a grin, just as he had in their prior performances. But this time, the only reply she received was his fragile and weak breathing.</p><!--
              --><p>The loneliness and fear of that fateful night so many years ago seized her heart once again.</p><!--
              --><p>It had been so long, and they'd been through so much &mdash; she'd grown from that, or so she thought.</p><!--
              --><p>Why, then, were things just like before? Could she do nothing but wait for someone to defend her? As she trembled in the darkness?</p><!--
              --><p>No. No. It should have been different. They had made so many miracles by their own hand, conquered so many obstacles.</p><!--
              --><p>...She had wished to stand behind him, supporting him, back to back, shoulder to shoulder.</p><!--
              --><p>The Maison personnel could be patrolling nearby. She dared not call out to their "family members," nor could they stay here.</p><!--
              --><p>The only thing she could do now was grasp Lyney's hand tightly, and haul him onto her shoulders.</p><!--
              --><p>If she could not see the way forward, then she would hear it.</p><!--
              --><p>Extending her ears as high as she could, she listened out for even the slightest wisp of wind.</p><!--
              --><p>And the wind sang through the branches and through the bushes, and brushed against her face... and they gradually painted for her a blurry scene.</p><!--
              --><p>Lynette groped forward in the dark, the thorns along the path piercing her skin and staining her clothes red.</p><!--
              --><p>Slowly, the sight before her eyes became clearer. Perhaps her ears had grown used to the wind, or her eyes, accustomed to the darkness, but her steps grew more agile, more resolute.</p><!--
              --><p>In this stage without spotlights, in this performance without plaudits, Lynette had at last become the star.</p><!--
              --><p>As the rays of dawn darted into the woods, Lynette carried her brother back to the rendezvous point of their "family," only to encounter someone unexpected &mdash; their "Father" had personally made the trip down last night.</p><!--
              --><p>Using the last of her strength, Lynette retrieved the sodden evidence from her bosom, but before she could hand it over, her legs gave out, taking Lyney down with her in the fall.</p><!--
              --><p>"Father" grabbed them both, allowing the incriminating information to fall to the earth and be soiled.</p><!--
              --><p>"Sleep now. You've retrieved... a far more valuable prize."</p><!--
              --><p>A Vision, reflecting both the dawn sun and the twins' sleeping faces, hung at Lynette's waist, glowing silently.</p>

** Additionally, her Wish Art on [https://wiki.hoyolab.com/m/genshin/entry/3962 her HoYoWiki entry] has blue-gray eyes similar to Lyney's, whereas all her other depictions &mdash; including her in-game Wish Art &mdash; give her purple eyes.
* The star-shaped mark on her face may be a mouche, an artificial beauty mark that was fashionable in sixteenth-century France (and later, across Europe).
