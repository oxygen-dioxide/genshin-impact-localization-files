{{Description|A monster birthed from a high concentration of Hydro that can float in the air.<br />On moonlit nights, Hydro Specters will give off a ghostly glow as they float by the riverbank. Their furtive forms are often mistaken by passers-by for wandering spirits, which has made them mainstays in quite a few folktales.|[[Archive]]}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Fury:''' Taking high DMG from a single attack will charge Fury. The higher the DMG dealt, the more Fury will be accumulated. When they have a full Fury bar, they will grow bigger and gain access to enhanced attacks.<table class="fandom-table"><tr><th>DMG Taken (%Max HP)</th><th>Fury Accumulated (%)</th></tr><tr><td>18.75-31.25</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>31.25-43.75</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>43.75-56.25</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>56.25+</td><td>100</td></tr></table>
*'''Water Spit:''' Shoots a slow homing bubble that deals '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}}.
*'''Splash Burst:''' Spins before summoning a splash at the location of the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|[[AoE]] Hydro DMG}}. Any enemies in the AoE will be [[heal]]ed by '''40%''' of their Max [[HP]].
*'''Squeeze Out:''' Squeezes itself out, before releasing a splash around itself dealing '''125% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}. This attack will only occur at max fury and will be the only attack it uses in that state.
*'''Final Burst:''' Explodes after a short pause when defeated, dealing '''125% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}. If at max Fury, DMG is increased to '''150% ATK''', and if enemies are nearby, the explosion will also release bubbles that track nearby enemies and heal them by '''20%''' of their Max HP.

===Ability Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if they meet all of the following conditions:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Certain abilities with extra trigger conditions may defy regular ability logic.
