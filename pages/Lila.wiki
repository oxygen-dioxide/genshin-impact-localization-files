;(Before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
:'''Lila:''' *sob* ...The doctor is a meanie, grandma! The shot she gave me hurt!
:'''Tahmina:''' No, she's not a meanie but an agent for Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.
:'''Tahmina:''' Lila is an unwell little tree, and she is nourishing you, little tree.
:'''Lila:''' I know Rukkhadevata is good, so the doctor is good too?
:'''Tahmina:''' Yes. Listen to her and you'll grow tall and strong.
:'''Tahmina:''' Otherwise, the Eremites will take you away for defying Rukkhadevata!
:'''Lila:''' No, the Eremites are scary, I don't want that...

;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
:'''Lila:''' *sob* ...The doctor is a meanie, grandma! The shot she gave me hurt!
:'''Tahmina:''' Haha. No, sweetheart, this lady here isn't being a meanie. She's here as a representative of the Dendro Archon.
:'''Tahmina:''' You're like an unwell little tree, Lila. What the doctor is doing is nourishing you.
:'''Lila:''' I know the Dendro Archon is a good person... Does that mean that the doctor is a good person too?
:'''Tahmina:''' Yes. Listen to her and you'll grow tall and strong.
:'''Tahmina:''' Otherwise, the Eremites will take you away for defying the Dendro Archon!

===Chromatic Ode of Candies and Roses===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Lila:''' *sobs* Grandma, please, since it's the Dendro Archon's birthday, can I not take my medicine...?
:'''Tahmina:''' Oh, but the Dendro Archon wants you to be healthy, my little Lila! If you don't take your medicine, how will you get better?
:'''Lila:''' But... But...
:'''Lila:''' O&mdash;Okay then... Fine. But can I at least have some candy before I take it?
:'''Tahmina:''' My dear Lila, if you have the medicine after the candy, then won't it be the bitter aftertaste that sticks around?
:'''Tahmina:''' Even the scariest Eremites know that work comes before play. If you don't believe me... Perhaps I should ask them to teach you?
:'''Lila:''' No, no! They're scary! I don't want that...
