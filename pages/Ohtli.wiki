===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing {{cx}}.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ohtli:''' Careful, next time might be when we find out who the winner really is.
:'''Itotia:''' Couldn't look forward to it more.
:'''Itotia:''' Let's hope you won't say "What a shame, it's a draw" again. I'm sick of hearing you say that.
:'''Ohtli:''' It's not my fault that you can't beat more bad guys than I do.
:'''Itotia:''' Allow me to remind you what the meaning of a draw is. It means I could say those words right back at you.
:'''Ohtli:''' Then there's no point in fighting like this, is there? Let's just keep working hard, y'know? I mean, as opponents.
:'''Itotia:''' What are you talking about? Of course we're opponents. I haven't reached the point where I need to team up with you yet.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing {{cx}}.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ohtli:''' ...What a shame...
:'''Itotia:''' Stop, stop!
:'''Ohtli:''' ...Another draw.
:'''Itotia:''' You just have to fight me, don't you?
:'''Ohtli:''' The day you beat me, I'll shut up for as long as you want.
:'''Ohtli:''' But until then, I'll speak my mind.
:'''Itotia:''' ...The day will come. So long as we're both standing here breathing, the day will come when we find out who the winner is!
:'''Itotia:''' Not only am I going to make you shut up, I'm gonna make you take off that mask! And then we'll see whether you're wearing it because of all the scars underneath.
:'''Ohtli:''' That'll depend on how good you are. Try killing half an enemy more than me, for starters.
