'''Storm Barriers''',<ref>Official Interactive Map: [https://act.hoyolab.com/ys/app/interactive-map/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=83 Teyvat]</ref> colloquially known as '''Anemo Barriers''' or '''Wind Barriers''', are hollow columns of wind. They typically surround another object, such as a chest or Elemental Monument, and will disappear when that object is interacted with.

If the player attempts to run into a Storm Barrier, they will be pushed back. When a player interacts with the object inside the barrier, the barrier will disappear. Reaching the inside of a barrier typically requires [[gliding]] from a high point, using [[Anemograna]], or height-boosting talents (see [[Plunging Attack]] for examples).

==Trivia==
* The term "storm barrier" is also used multiple times to refer to the protection around [[Stormterror's Lair]] during {{Quest|Song of the Dragon and Freedom}}.
