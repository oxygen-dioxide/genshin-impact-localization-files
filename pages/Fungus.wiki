'''Fungi''' are an enemy group found in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]] and [[Sumeru]]. They are an evolved species of mushrooms with increased abilities to reproduce and protect the flora.<ref>Youtube: [https://youtu.be/JrC7DTUsii8 Sumeru Preview Teaser 03- Prelude to Wisdom - Genshin Impact]</ref>

They are considered [[Tri-Lakshana Creature]]s and thus {{Pyro}} and {{Electro}} will have adverse effects on them. When inflicted with Pyro, they enter a '''Scorched''' state, attacking significantly slower but dealing more damage. On the other hand, Electro causes them to enter an '''Activated''' state, attacking significantly faster.

Unlike other Tri-Lakshana Creatures (barring the Jadeplume Terrorshroom), once they enter a Scorched or Activated state, they stay that way until killed.

==Drops==
Fungi will only drop spores, pollen and dust when defeated in their normal state. If defeated in an Activated or Scorched state, nucleus drops are added to the table, while the original three drops have a significantly reduced drop rate.

==Trivia==
*Using {{Pyro}} or {{Electro}} against fungi will cause the experience drop to triple as if they were [[Elite Enemies]] despite retaining the [[Common Enemies]] mora amount.
