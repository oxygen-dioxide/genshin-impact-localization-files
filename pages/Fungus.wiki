'''Fungi''', singular '''fungus''', are an enemy group found in [[Sumeru]] and [[Liyue]]. They are an evolved species of mushrooms with increased abilities to reproduce and protect the flora,<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/JrC7DTUsii8 Sumeru Preview Teaser 03- Prelude to Wisdom - Genshin Impact]</ref> though most people consider them to be monsters. Attempts to domesticate fungi are ongoing with some success.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Farewell, My Shroom Buddies}}</ref>

They are considered [[Tri-Lakshana Creature]]s and thus {{Pyro}} and {{Electro}} will have adverse effects on them. When inflicted with Pyro, they enter a '''Scorched''' state, attacking significantly slower but dealing more damage. On the other hand, Electro causes them to enter an '''Activated''' state, attacking significantly faster.

Unlike other Tri-Lakshana Creatures (barring the Jadeplume Terrorshroom), once they enter a Scorched or Activated state, they stay that way until killed.

==Drops==
Fungi will only drop spores, pollen and dust when defeated in their normal state. If defeated in an Activated or Scorched state, nucleus drops are added to the table, while the original three drops have a significantly reduced drop rate. Additionally, the [[Character EXP]] drops of Activated and Scorched fungi are tripled.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|To put it shortly, the Fungus is the congregation of overgrown and over-evolved spores.<br>{{Color|bp|Exposing it to Pyro or Electro will Scorch or Activate it, respectively. While in either one of said states, the Fungus will drop special materials.}}<br>It is said that the infestation of Fungi is the result of a lab accident. At first, a certain sage had hopes of utilizing spores for medical purposes. If that is true, the person had clearly underestimated the spores' adaptive and reproductive powers.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}

==Trivia==
* A lone group of Fungi can be found in [[Yaodie Valley]] of [[Chenyu Vale]], [[Liyue]].
* Some small fungi found in the wild can be seen caged by other common enemies like [[Hilichurls]], [[Treasure Hoarders]] or [[The Eremites|Eremites]]. They cannot be freed and can still be defeated while imprisoned.
* Some fungi encountered in ''[[Homecoming]]'' are [[Apep's Creatures|survivors]] of [[Apep]]'s attempt on harnessing [[Forbidden Knowledge|forbidden knowledge]]; prior to the [[cataclysm]], [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] took pity on their suffering, where she promised to take them back "home".<ref>{{Quest|Homecoming}}</ref>
** Unlike regular fungi that derives from spores as normal, they are actually elemental lifeforms.
* Fungi are also encountered in [[Natlan]], though as part of the [[Tribal Chronicles]] [[Mushroom Realm Mystery]], who had arrived there due to [[Bifrons]], a fungus god, relocating there in an attempt to restore power. There are no fungi enemies in Natlan's overworld.
