'''Crown of Parting''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Resolution of Sojourner]].

==Description==
The departing traveler would take this crown of willow branches as a final memento.<br />With it, he would remember his lover, now departed like a dandelion on the breeze.

The traveler was the wandering lyrist, and that maiden in the country of wine was a prisoner of the nobility.<br />For reasons he knew not himself, his lyre-song revealed his true heart.

"What would move me, you ask? ...Well, it would be your smile."<br />"I've never known you to smile, after all. Not even once."<br />"I will break the chains that bind you."<br />"When that time comes, would you let me see you smile?"

"Yes, and thank you. It would be wonderful indeed if you could do that."<br />Pretty words, but who could trust them, coming from a singer?
