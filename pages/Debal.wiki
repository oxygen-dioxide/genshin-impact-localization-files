==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Debal:''' Finally, the job is done... That fool [[Brek]] can't even do his job properly.
:{{DIcon}} What's up with Brek?
::'''Debal:''' All he does is slack off and try to make a quick profit through shady dealings.
::'''Debal:''' Last time, he got duped into buying and reselling dried [[Bulle Fruit]], and ended up falling into serious debt. Now he's got creditors hounding him day in and day out.
::'''Debal:''' Even with things being as bad as they've gotten, he still won't consider taking up honest work to pay off his debt. Instead, he keeps going on about pulling off some "major deal" and hitting it big.
::'''Debal:''' He should have known what he was getting into. He originally wanted me to go in on the loan with him, but unlike him, I'm no fool.
::{{DIcon}} So you turned him down?
::'''Debal:''' Of course, I have my own business to attend to.
::'''Debal:''' I run a perfectly legitimate business here. Do you know [[Fonta]]? I know a few people who are planning to replicate it and create a unique beverage of their own.
::'''Debal:''' Once they've perfected the recipe, I'll facilitate getting the drink into the port for people to sample, and then handle the additional promotion.
::{{DIcon}} Why choose the harbor for your first market?
::'''Debal:''' There are always people coming in and out of [[Lumidouce Harbor]], including quite a few first-time visitors to Fontaine. I want this beverage to give them a positive first impression of this place.
::'''Debal:''' If we acquaint enough people with our knockoff... Who cares about Fonta, our drink will be the most popular in all of Fontaine!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Your business is...
::'''Debal:''' What? I'm running a legitimate business here. I don't steal, I don't rob, and I sure don't dupe others out of their fortunes. I work hard and I've earned everything I have through sweat and toil.
::'''Debal:''' There aren't many honest folks like me these days, who earn their living through blood, sweat, and tears.
::'''Debal:''' Why, if everyone in the Court of Fontaine was like me, fairness and justice would prevail in all business dealings.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Teachings of Justice|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} Bye.
::'''Debal:''' Goodbye. Try and make an honest living out there.
