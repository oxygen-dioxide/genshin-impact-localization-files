{{Lang|'''The Crux'''|zh=南十字|zh_rm=Nánshízì|zh_tl=The {{w|Crux|Southern Cross}}}} is an armed fleet based in [[Liyue Harbor]] and led by Captain [[Beidou]]. The Crux is famous throughout [[Liyue]] for their daring adventures and rich bounties.

Its flagship, the ''[[Alcor]]'', can be found (and boarded) off the shores of [[Guyun Stone Forest]], by the southeastern end of the island [[Domain of Guyun]] is on.

==Overview==
The Crux's expeditions are "more or less" approved by the [[Liyue Qixing]] due to Beidou's unusual relationship with the Tianquan [[Ningguang]]: Beidou has no fear of her like the rest of Liyue's citizens and adamantly proclaims that no one is her boss, while Ningguang claims she never hires the Crux's services &mdash; just Beidou's.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Beidou|3}}</ref>

Whenever the Crux returns from a voyage, they hold a three-day celebratory feast. Once, they hired [[Xiangling]], hoping they could save Mora by hiring the not-yet-famous chef. She impressed both Beidou and the crew with her skill, and Beidou ordered the crew to call the girl "Madam Xiangling," proclaiming she would soon become renowned throughout Liyue. Afterwards, Xiangling became a regular guest aboard the fleet in search of new and exotic ingredients.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Beidou|4}}</ref>

The Crux's dealings go beyond Liyue's borders, having done business in [[Inazuma]]. Beidou's Chief Mate, [[Juza]], has an Inazuman name.<ref group="Note">Juza's name is based on the Japanese reading of {{Lang|mini=1|ja=重佐|ja_rm=Juusa}}. His crewmates' names are based on their Chinese readings, indicating that this was a deliberate decision on the English localization's part.</ref> [[Yoimiya]] occasionally commissions the fleet to send fireworks to Liyue.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Kaedehara Kazuha|About Yoimiya}}</ref> Beidou and her crew were also hired by [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]] as mercenaries for the [[Watatsumi Army]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|In the Name of the Resistance}}</ref>

Sometime after [[Ei]] enacted the [[Vision Hunt Decree]], Beidou took in [[Kaedehara Kazuha]] as a "temporary crewmember", allowing him to escape his pursuers for the time being.
