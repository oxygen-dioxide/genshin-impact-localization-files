[[Natlan]] is characterized by its adherence to "war," the Pyro Archon [[Mavuika]]'s ideal.

==Life in Natlan==
Since [[Och-Kan]]'s era (~2000 years ago), there have been six major tribes in Natlan: the [[Children of Echoes]], [[People of the Springs]], [[Scions of the Canopy]], [[Collective of Plenty]], [[Flower-Feather Clan]], and [[Masters of the Night-Wind]]. Alongside humans, a large number of evolved [[dragon]]s known as [[saurian]]s reside in Natlan, having undergone years of development and evolution while co-existing with humans.<ref name="Finale">{{Ref/Quest|Finale}}</ref> Each tribe has a specific saurian that they bond particularly well with.<ref name="SCBU">{{Ref/Quest|Search Chronicle: Burning Up!}}</ref>

[[Aikawa Susumu]] has visited Natlan personally and experienced their hot springs. According to him, Natlan is "a country of red-hot passion, both in name and climate."<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Aikawa Susumu}}</ref>

Another [[Inazuma]]n who visited Natlan in his youth is [[Shousen]], who witnessed the nation's art of boxing. He noticed that the locals trained using a method they called "shadow boxing," where boxers would practice sparring by imagining their opponents' actions and reacting accordingly. This technique inspired Inazuma's [[Shinryuu]].<ref name="PF:PB">{{Ref/Quest|Phantom Flow: Phantasmal Blade}}</ref>

[[Lectoure]], a sailor in [[Romaritime Harbor]], mentions that he has a "lady love" over in Natlan, though he worries about being unable to integrate smoothly due to the nation's variety of tribes and rules. He also states in his [[TCG]] dialogue that the place would be his first choice of a nation to settle down.

[[Adel]], an NPC located in [[Bayda Harbor]], speaks very highly of Natlan, stating that its population is energetic and that "their souls are forged for battle from birth," specifying that they're not barbarians of any sort. He also states that they love street graffiti, showing off and comparing fashionable trinkets. He ends his dialogue by describing Natlan as a "colorful, contradictory and charming place." People also enjoy dancing and listening to music.

The weather of Natlan is stated to be hot, so many people in Natlan tend to wear loose-fitting clothing. [[Baret]] remarks that even her lightest [[Fontainian]] dress was not able to withstand the heat.

"War" is a daily part of life in Natlan, which [[Neuvillette]] likens to an "undying flame,"<ref name="Finale" /> as the nation is constantly under threat of the [[Abyss]] ever since the [[cataclysm]]. Unlike the other nations, Natlan's Ley Lines are repurposed as the [[Night Kingdom]], as the original was severely damaged during the war between the [[Heavenly Principles]] and [[Seven Sovereigns]]. Due to this, the Night Kingdom only accepts Natlanese and does not share memories with the rest of Teyvat and vice versa. The deceased are usually sent to the Night Kingdom, though there are a few exceptions which can potentially put them at the risk of being forgotten for good.

After the Abyss was purged from the Night Kingdom and [[Capitano]] sacrificed his life force, the Night Kingdom accepts people from other nations.

===Cuisine===
[[Grainfruit]] is a staple food of Natlan. It serves as the base of many dishes, including [[Tatacos]], [[Grainfruit Meat Soup]], and [[Hot Spring O'Clock]]. Another common ingredient is [[Cacahuatl]], which has a bitter, complex flavor that is often used in sweeter dishes, such as [[Volcano Cake]] and [[Saurus Crackers]]. In general, Natlanese food tends to be hearty and filling, with an emphasis on starch and meat.

Cacahuatl can also be used in making drinks; the seeds are considered the most valuable part of the plant, though its white flesh can also be pressed for juice. [[Quenepa Berry|Quenepa Berries]] can also be consumed, and to a lesser extent, [[Flamegranate]]s, which causes whatever it is put into to be full of [[Phlogiston]].

[[Puff Pops]] are a popular snack among those from the Scions of the Canopy.

[[Embercore Flower]] nectar is extremely sweet and leaves a burning sensation on the lips and tongue. This unique flavor is very popular among the tribes of Natlan.

Alongside their plentiful crops, people in the Collective of Plenty are fond of mushrooms, due to [[Varesa]]'s family orchard growing berryshrooms as a result of an unforeseen circumstance involving [[Bifrons]].

===Technology===
Obsidian, a mineral found in volcanic areas, has a rich history in Natlan. Since around the time of the [[Archon War]], it has been used for making ritual implements,<ref group="Note">According to the description of [[Moment of Attainment]], the Natlanese used obsidian totems in their worship of the Night Kingdom prior to the reign of [[Och-Kan]], which was around the time of the Archon War.</ref> and since at least 500 years ago, for making weapons.<ref name="TS">{{Ref/Weapon|Talking Stick}}</ref> The Natlanese also work with Phlogiston-infused ores, and have since at least the time of [[Vennessa]], who described them as having "exceptional quality" compared to those of [[Mondstadt]].<ref>{{Ref/Item|Shackles of the Dandelion Gladiator}}</ref> According to the gem merchant [[Jinghe]], all Natlanese ores are actually associated with Phlogiston.

Natlan's current technology partly builds on that of the ancient dragons, the previous civilization that dominated the area. Most notable is their use of phlogiston, a naturally occurring form of high-temperature thermal energy,<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Natlan|Phlogiston}}</ref> as a power source. One way to manipulate phlogiston is through Phlogiston Engravings, a method developed to imitate the [[Iridescent Inscription]]s that the dragons used. With these, they are able to do things like store information and create [[Spiritway]]s.

Much of the dragons' technology, though, has been lost to time or is yet undeciphered, restricting the degree to which modern humans can use it. Accordingly, draconic technology is sometimes referred to as originating from the "Secret Source." The Secret Source is primarily found in automatons of varying makes, such as [[Secret Source Dragon Cannon]]s, [[Secret Source Dragon Idol]]s and combat automatons such as the [[Secret Source Automaton: Configuration Device]]. Secret Source reacts to the presence of [[Nightsoul's Blessing]], causing combat constructs to adjust their combat capabilities accordingly to handle the threat.

Some people in Natlan use complex phlogiston-powered vehicles, many of which are made by the Nanatzcayan. Examples include [[Kachina]]'s ridable drill, Chasca's flying cannon, Mavuika's all-terrain motorcycle, and jetpacks called Phlogiston Wings. They are also capable of making dynamic light displays, as seen on [[Xilonen]]'s portable DJ set and the weapon [[Peak Patrol Song]]. However, access to this level of technology is very limited; most Natlanese travel on foot, using alpacas or depending on the tribe, saurians as pack animals, and they decorate with gems and paints.

The Nanatzcayan tribe uses a variety of drills in their mining. There is an enormous drill embedded in the cliffs above their tribal settlement, suggesting the scale that they are able to achieve.

The Meztli tribe makes circular record discs that can be played on portable record players,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Someone Trustworthy}}</ref> as well as several kinds of string and percussive instruments. They have also constructed artificial hot springs (in addition to their natural ones).<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Home of the Hot Springs}}</ref>

The Mictlan are known to weave scrolls to record historical events in Natlan, a difficult skill that is passed down through the tribe. Special scrolls are made for major events, with their weavers being appointed by the [[Iktomisaur]] Elder [[Tlapo]].

The Tlalocan often use hot air balloons to keep platforms up in the air at a reasonable distance from the ground, but not too far for people to access. These balloons are buoyant enough to support large wooden structures, yet durable enough to withstand moderate impact and various weather conditions.

Natlanese tribal warriors have been shown to use a variety of intricate weapons, including giant collapsible slingshots, giant circular saws, and portable cannons.

==Designs, Motifs, and Symbols==
The overall shape of Natlan Character Cards is a large circle with a darker ridge pattern covering the circle's inner edge. To either side of the circle's center are circles with symbols nestled in the troughs of the ridges, representing the six tribes of Natlan.

In clockwise order:
* Top right is the emblem of the [[Huitztlan]] tribe, specialists at communications and tracking down [[Saurian]]s.
* Middle right represents the [[Nanatzcayan]] tribe, miners and excavators of the region's east.
* Bottom right represents the [[Teteocan]] tribe, renowned for their strength and agriculture.
* Bottom left is the emblem of [[Meztli]] tribe, explorers and guides accustomated to the region's rough terrain.
* Middle left is the emblem of the [[Tlalocan]] tribe, expert aerial warriors and rangers.
* Top left is the emblem of the [[Mictlan]] tribe, known for their close connection with the [[Night Kingdom]].

==Economy==
Since the people of Natlan were unable to leave its borders for many years, its economy was fairly closed, and thus exports were fairly scarce. Their only "export" was tourism, as many people visited the nation due to visitors finding their culture and scenery fascinating.

Within Natlan, each of the six tribes has its own economic niche.

The Nanatzcayan specialize in mining, smithing, and gem appraisal. Notably, they are Natlan's only source of obsidian,<ref name="TRAN">{{Ref/Quest|To Reclaim an Ancient Name}}</ref> which is used for important ritual purposes, such as communing with the [[Night Kingdom]]. They are also responsible for forging [[Ancient Name]]s, a task taken on by skilled Name Engravers like [[Xilonen]].

The Meztli rely heavily on tourism, especially to their hot springs, which are famous throughout Teyvat. The [[Inazuma]]ns were so enamored that they incorporated them into their own culture, commissioning high-efficiency [[Snezhnaya]]n boilers to create artificial ones at home.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Mikawa Akane}}</ref>

The Huitztlan mainly take delivery and hunting commissions. They are also a popular tourist destination for extreme sports, such as rock climbing, rappelling, bungee jumping, and volcano parkour.<ref name="TRAN" />

The Tlalocan are known as elite warriors, and one of their members, [[Ifa]], is a renowned sauro-vet, but their general source(s) of income are unclear.

The Mictlan offer spiritual services, such as fortune-telling and the blessing of tools and weapons. They also make artisanal items, as it is believed that "items created by the Masters of the Night-Wind have special effects."<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Xipilli}}</ref>

The Teteocan are known for their high-quality agricultural products, as they live on particularly fertile land. They grow so much that they often trade and/or give away excess harvests to the other tribes.

==Fashion==
[[File:Search Chronicle Burning Up Hat.png|thumb|Ranjit's Natlan-style hat]]
People of Natlan, especially warriors, like wearing "Saurian imitation" that makes them look similar to their companions, as can be seen from the [[Sauroform Tribal Warrior]] enemy group. A hat inspired by this fashion is visible on the [[Specially-Shaped Saurian Search]] event page.<ref name="SCBU" /> Some Teteocan wear masks, which is part of a time-honored wrestling tradition. When two mask wearers duel each other, the loser is forced to remove their mask, while the winner keeps theirs, which retains a sense of mystery to inspire others to step up an challenge them.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Acatl}}</ref>

Many adults in Natlan have markings on their bodies. Children and seniors generally wear fully covered clothing, while adults are generally more mixed; while men can wear loose clothing that reveals their chest and midriff, others tend to wear fully covered clothes just like people from other nations. Women, on the other hand, are almost always seen with an exposed midriff.

==Festivals and Holidays==
The people of Natlan come together and hold tournaments to fuel the [[Sacred Flame]] in honor of the [[Pyro Archon]], known as the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]]. These tournaments are split into two rounds: in the first round, participants compete in teams to attempt to complete an objective, while in the second round, participants individually face off against each other. The winners of the second round go on to form the team that will partake in the [[Night Warden Wars]], a war against the Abyss. The war is only allowed for participants with an [[Ancient Name]], as the Pyro Archon's [[Ode of Resurrection]] does not work for non-Ancient Name bearers. If the winners emerge victorious, they are greatly honored, and non-name bearers are also treated as such despite not partaking in the fight.

Those sent in the wars are blessed by the Pyro Archon. Even if the participant is killed during the battle, as long as the rest of their team emerges victorious, they are revived by the Ode of Resurrection. If the whole team fails, the Ode will not work and their souls will linger in the Night Kingdom, slowly forgotten over time.

After Kachina failed to return from the Night Warden War despite the success of her team, Mavuika suspended all future pilgrimages, as she had been unable to locate Kachina's Ancient Name. In truth, this was also to prevent further casualties and division among the tribes, as she knew that the amount of Contending Fire produced by the participants was not enough to sustain the Sacred Flame.

Once the Abyss was purged from the Night Kingdom, Mavuika revised the Pilgrimage, now repurposed as athletic competitions.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As the Blazing Sun}}</ref>

Another old festival that the tribes used to celebrate was the [[Bloomflower Trials]], which also helped fuel the Sacred Flame and could help heal sick Saurians. However, the trials died out at some point in the past, as the last attempt to host it in the past resulted in bloodshed and division. In addition, the Pilgrimage provided more Contending Flame, resulting in the festival's decline. It was only after the Abyss war ended that the trials began again, which helped [[Milray]] recover from his illness and [[Antu]] get past his regrets.<ref name="Bloomflower Trials">Event [[Tournament of Glory in Bloom]] Quest</ref>

==Politics==
Unlike the other nations, which have a single general populace and central ruler, the people of Natlan all belong to one of six major tribes, each of which is ruled by a Chief. The Pyro Archon, while the nation's de facto ruler, does not play a major role in managing the tribes' internal affairs. Instead, they are primarily responsible for national events such as the Pilgrimage, Night Warden Wars, and national defence.

Tribal Chiefs govern their tribes on their own terms. They oversee tribal customs and are able to change them as they see fit,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Rite of the Bold}}</ref> and even the Pyro Archon cannot overrule their decisions (so long as their tribe agrees).<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Time for the Showdown}}</ref> There appears to be no age requirement to become a Chief &mdash; simply being able to handle the responsibilities and having been picked by the previous Chief appears to be more than sufficient. [[Pacal]], the Chief of the Children of Echoes, found other ways to help support the tribe by becoming a Chief, while [[Amina]], the Chief of the People of the Springs, is a young girl who was selected by her grandfather (and voted in by the elders) to succeed him and is able to handle many tasks without much issue.

Tribes are usually united in their goals, though there have been times where the tribes were bitterly divided to the point that a Pyro Archon could not intervene at times, especially if a new Archon had been appointed.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Medicine Borne of Guilt}}</ref> The current tribal chiefs are on good terms with each other, though their duties have resulted in them not spending as much time as they would like.

Prior to the purification of the Night Kingdom, the people of Natlan generally chose to never leave their nation. As explained by Kachina, this was due to the [[Wayob]] protecting the people from the constant Abyssal influence in Natlan. For anyone who left Natlan's borders, the Wayob's protection would weaken, and the person would suffer the consequences of long-term exposure to Abyssal energy. In special circumstances, one could go through an application process that involved asking their tribal Chief to directly seek permission from their tribe's Wayob, but the chances were still slim.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Past and Future}}</ref> Now that the Night Kingdom has been purified, the Natlanese are able to travel out of the nation without suffering any consequences, though they still need their Chief's permission to do so.

The Wayob also grant Ancient Names to those who they deem worthy in the tribe. These name bearers are revered among their tribe, as it is considered a special honor to be bestowed one. Their deeds are recorded with the Ancient Name and are a source of inspiration for future generations. When one has fully embodied the aspirations of the Wayob, they are able to tap into the knowledge once held by previous name bearers.

Conflict is considered "reason" in Natlan, and is used as a method to determine outcomes,<ref>{{Ref/Item|Teachings of Conflict}}</ref> as well as a demand for people to settle their scores decisively and efficiently.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Guide to Conflict}}</ref> The premise of conflict is that all parties involved must confront their own desires with utmost sincerity, so they will remain mindful of what they wish to achieve and stay true to their original objectives.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Philosophies of Conflict}}</ref> If a conflict between parties is unable to be resolved, it may necessitate the intervention of "peacemakers" such as [[Chasca]].

===Military===
Natlan does not have a formal military. Instead, each tribe has their own group of tribal warriors, who often base their outfits and fighting styles on their tribe's favored Saurian. Most are capable of using their respective Saurian's [[element]] and special abilities, such as levitation, telekinesis, and "surfing" on land. The degree to which a warrior can do this depends on their skill level.

Tribal warriors are proficient in both hand-to-hand combat and the weapon of their choice. Commonly used weapons include swords, clubs, spears, javelins, giant hammers, saw-like weapons, and hand cannons.

It should be noted that, up until the present, the people of Natlan were accustomed to the daily threat of the Abyss. Their culture also emphasizes warriors, heroes, and victory. Thus, many Natlanese are capable or at least familiar with combat.

==Languages==
In addition to speaking the [[Languages#Teyvat Language|common tongue]], it appears that Vennessa's clan had their own language,<ref>{{Ref/Manga|0|quote='''Barca Lawrence:''' I know you speak our tongue!}}</ref> which was presumably either a Natlan local language or a language derived from theirs, depending on how long ago Vennessa's clan left their homeland.

Saurians are not able to communicate with humans, though they can understand human speech. Likewise, humans are not able to understand saurians. Saurians have their own language, which the Traveler can understand while [[Saurian Indwelling|indwelling]] a saurian. Few are able to communicate in both languages; [[Cacucu]] understands both, but the limits of his vocal cords has limited him to copying several phrases that [[Ifa]] often uses. [[Ajaw]] is also capable of communicating between people and saurians.

Furthermore, [[Natlan (Soundtrack)|the song]] sang by Natlan people during "Ode to Resurrection" and Natlan battle theme use Swahili language.
