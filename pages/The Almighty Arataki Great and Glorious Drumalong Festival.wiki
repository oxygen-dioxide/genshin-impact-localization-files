<!--
Some notes for other editors in case I can't come back to get them for the later songs:
Score breakdown of each judgement:
Tap notes:
Perfect: 20 points
Good: 15 points
Hold tick (when your combo increases in the middle of a hold): 5 points

Rank thresholds:
Unranked: 0 points
Euphonia: 1+ points (15+ points in practice since 15 is the lowest non-zero score you can get)
Dulcem: 60+%
Discantus: 90+%
Canorus: 100%

Calculating the note count:
To get the note count, simply play the map and then add the perfect, good, and failed counts together.

Calculating the maximum score:
First step is to get play the map, getting the maximum combo (failed count should be 0).
If your good count is 0, you have achieved the maximum score and can put that into the wiki directly
If your good count is greater than 0, take your score, and add the number of goods you got multiplied by 5

eg. 110 Perfects, 7 Goods, Score 2305
2305 + 7 x 5 = 2340
