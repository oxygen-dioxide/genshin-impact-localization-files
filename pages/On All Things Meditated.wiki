==Gameplay Notes==
* Using [[All Schemes to Know]] can mark human [[NPC]]s in [[Sumeru]] (and only therein) to trigger auto-playing special dialogue, which represents their thoughts.
** While playing special dialogue, the edge of the screen will darken.
** Some NPCs may also have special dialogue during quests.
** A list of all NPCs with special dialogue outside of quests can be found [[:Category:NPCs Targetable by All Schemes to Know|here]].
** Foreigners can be targeted, but not overseas Sumerians.
* At most 5 harvestable items can be picked up each time the hold version of this talent is used.
* The [[Seed Dispensary]] gadget can be equipped to harvest [[Gardening Materials]] using this talent. Gardening Materials will not count towards the 5 item limit.
* All Schemes to Know will not mark or activate [[Whopperflower]]s disguised as regular plants.
* All Schemes to Know can collect resources behind transparent [[barrier]]s.
* Only naturally placed [[Carrot]]s and [[Radish]]es can be harvested by All Schemes to Know. Carrots and Radishes dropped by [[Investigation|Investigation Points]] or destroying crates cannot be harvested this way. However, all [[Apple]]s, [[Sunsettia]]s, [[Mushroom]]s, and [[Matsutake]]s can be harvested, regardless of where they come from<!-- includes: investigation points and crates for apples and sunsettias; shroomboars for mushrooms and matsutakes -->.
* All Schemes to Know cannot be used to harvest flora that have been [[Gardening|planted]] on fields in the [[Serenitea Pot]].
