==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ms. Bai:''' Hello, how do you do? We don't often see young people like you.
:{{DIcon|Shop}} What do you sell here?
::'''Ms. Bai:''' Would you like some tofu? I can guarantee that ours will surely satisfy you!
:;(Opens [[#Shop|Shop]] menu)
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
::'''Ms. Bai:''' Just call me Ms. Bai. This is my mill... Or more accurately, this is the mill that I oversee.
::'''Ms. Bai:''' Not bad at all, wouldn't you say?
::{{DIcon}} What's with the mill?
:::'''Ms. Bai:''' What's with it? This was left to me by my father. When I returned, I renovated it wholesale, and now maintain it every day.
:::'''Ms. Bai:''' Maybe my father also once lived this kind of peaceful life... Every time I hear the sound of the water wheel, it reminds me of many things in my childhood.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} It's not bad.
:::'''Ms. Bai:''' Thanks, it's always nice to get positive feedback. This is more than just a mill&mdash; the tofu we make here is the best in all of Liyue!
:::'''Ms. Bai:''' I know that sounds like bragging, but it's the truth. Many restaurants in Liyue Harbor order from us, and so does the Wangshu Inn!
:::'''Ms. Bai:''' Of course, I could talk all day but nothing beats trying it for yourself. Here, have some on the house. If you like it, maybe you can consider buying some more in the future.
::;(Obtain [[Tofu]] ×8)
:{{DIcon}} Young people, you say?
::'''Ms. Bai:''' Yes. Most of the young folks have gone out to seek work, and they don't return. We don't get many young foreign visitors either.
::'''Ms. Bai:''' Such is the allure of city life, I suppose.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Ms. Bai:''' Goodbye, and stay safe!
