'''Instances''' ''(unofficial name)'' are [[points of interest]] that have an accessible interior requiring a loading screen to access. Some instances teleport the player into a fully different map, such as the [[Knights of Favonius Headquarters]], while others teleport the player to areas hidden underneath the normally accessible main map, such as [[Nice to Meet You]]. The latter are therefore also accessible through terrain clipping glitches, at the risk of {{w|sequence breaking}}. Important instances may have a dedicated marker on the map. Unlike [[Domain]]s, the player can take [[Photo Mode|photos]] and switch their party members inside an instance.

Some [[Gadget]]s can be used inside instances, such as [[Kamera Gadget]]s, [[Music Gadget]]s, and the [[Windblume Festival Commemorative Balloon]], but most gadgets cannot be used indoors. Gadgets that cannot be used include [[Treasure Compass]]es, the [[Serenitea Pot]], the [[Portable Waypoint]], and the [[Launch Tube]].
