==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Shatir:''' It's not fair. All those secret research projects are sucking up budgets that should be ours.
:{{DIcon}} Budget?
::'''Shatir:''' Yeah, the budgets.
::'''Shatir:''' Sadly, even great things like knowledge can be thwarted by money.
::'''Shatir:''' The Akademiya has been spending more and more budgets on classified research over the past years.
::'''Shatir:''' Instead of maintaining a financial black hole, they should fund more practical disciplines like archaeology.
::'''Shatir:''' With a lack of self-reflection on history, we would get a short end in real life sooner or later.
::'''Shatir:''' Next time I apply for funding, I must get [[Vikram]] to join me!
::{{DIcon}} About Vikram...
::'''Shatir:''' Vikram is my friend. He must be your friend, too.
::'''Shatir:''' You know how it is. As long as he's there helping with the negotiations, you can always get more funding than you expected.
::{{DIcon}} I've only heard the name.
:::'''Shatir:''' What? You don't know about him? Hm... Well, he has been busy recently with the thing about the next [[Grand Conservator]].
::{{DIcon}} It's my first time hearing this name.
:::'''Shatir:''' What? There are people in Sumeru City who haven't heard of Vikram? Well... Maybe I'm the one who's taking it for granted, since I haven't met anyone who didn't know of him.
:::'''Shatir:''' He's been in the limelight recently, and is a strong candidate for the next Grand Conservator.
::'''Shatir:''' I don't know what other people think, but other than [[Lisa]], who according to legends has become [[Mondstadt]]'s Grand Conservator, Vikram should be the most suitable candidate.
::'''Shatir:''' After all, if the person in charge of the collections is as unreasonable as the one managing the funds, this study will be dead in the water.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Shatir:''' Goodbye.

==Trivia==
* Although he does not wear his school crest, it can be assumed that Shatir is a researcher of the [[Vahumana]] [[Darshan]] given his interest for archaeology and concerns about the Akademiya's lack of self-reflection on history.
