'''Skyrider''' is the namesake character in the [[Skyrider Series]].

==Story==
He attempts to fly with his [[Skyrider Sword|sword]] in [[Jueyun Karst]], but fails. He sells the sword in exchange for medicine, but his dreams of flying do not end.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Skyrider Sword}}</ref> Instead of accepting that swords would not fly, he blames the sword, and decides to use the larger [[Skyrider Greatsword|greatsword]] instead. He attempts once more to fly in [[Guyun Stone Forest]], but that also fails and he dies.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Skyrider Greatsword}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*This is likely based off the common trope in {{W|Xianxia (genre)|xianxia}} novels where cultivators can fly on their swords.
*Interestingly, there is a Skyrider Greatsword stabbed into a stone platform at Guyun Stone Forest. Perhaps it landed there after his leap, though the positioning seems a bit too intentional for it to have just randomly fallen there.
*[[Pan Guan'er]] finds a Skyrider Sword in Jueyun Karst. It's unclear if this is the one that the Skyrider sold, if it is from another attempt, or if this weapon is simply mass-produced and not unique to the Skyrider.
