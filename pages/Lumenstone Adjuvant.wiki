'''Lumenstone Adjuvant''' is a [[Gadget]] that helps the [[Traveler]] explore the [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]] and solve some of its puzzles.

It is obtained during the World Quest ''[[Chasm Spelunkers]]'' where it transforms from the [[Lumenstone]].

==Usage==
When the gadget is equipped in the Underground Mines, an energy gauge appears above the [[Health]] bar. As long as at least one energy is inside the gauge, the Lumenstone Adjuvant can activate specific light-sensitive mechanisms, and it will also glow and illuminate the area surrounding the character. How much this improves visibility in The Chasm is dependent on the player's Brightness [[setting]]: The higher the Brightness setting is, the lighter the environment colors are, so the less the light from the Adjuvant helps.

Apart from this, energy can be consumed to recharge inactive [[Ruin Brazier]]s, [[Lumenlamp]]s, [[Time Trial Challenge]]s and most [[Chests]] in the mines. Higher-tier chests require more energy to unlock. Upon reaching the requisite level, the Lumenstone Adjuvant can also be used to dispel [[Oozing Concretions]].

Energy can be refilled by standing next to active [[Teleport Waypoints]], Ruin Braziers, or Luminous Seelies, breaking glowing ore rocks, killing [[Bluethunder Weasel]]s, catching [[Lucklight Fly|Lucklight Flies]], and collecting [[Starshroom]]s.

==Enhancing==
{{Main|Enhance the Lumenstone Adjuvant}}
The Lumenstone Adjuvant can be [[Enhance the Lumenstone Adjuvant|enhanced]] by talking to [[Jinwu]] using [[Lumenspar]] and [[Lumenstone Ore]]. Enhancing the Lumenstone Adjuvant to level 10 will grant the ''[[Chasmlighter]]'' achievement "[[Arch-Illuminator]]."

:'''Paimon:''' Eugh, that dark mud looks super thick... and gross. The Adjuvant we have can't do anything about it yet. Let's get more {{Color|buzzword|Lumenspar}} first, shall we?
