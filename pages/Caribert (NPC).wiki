'''Caribert Alberich''' is a quest-exclusive NPC that appears in {{Quest|Caribert}} and {{Quest|Bedtime Story}}.

==Profile==
Caribert was a former resident of [[Khaenri'ah]]. His father was [[Chlothar]] and his mother was an unnamed woman with roots in [[Mondstadt]]. He was considered to be an "illegitimate son" by his father.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Fortune-Mocking Pedigree}}</ref>

After the gods attacked Khaenri'ah, they cursed its inhabitants, and the pure-blooded Khaenri'ahns were given immortality. Those who came to Khaenri'ah from the other gods' lands were instead cursed with the "wilderness," transforming them into hilichurls, Caribert included since his mother was from Mondstadt. Caribert fell into a state of torpor upon being transformed and was cared for by Chlothar.

Sometime after [[Cataclysm|Khaenri'ah's fall]], the [[Traveler's Sibling]] met Chlothar and Caribert. The former begged them for help in cultivating a [[Nameless Taboo Medicine of the Royal Court|forbidden medicine]] that would, according to records, awaken the God of Wisdom and help Caribert resist the effects of the curse. The sibling helped Chlothar make a dose and administered it to Caribert, but it had no effect. While trying to make a second dose, Chlothar saw a hilichurl he assumed was Caribert heading in the direction of [[The Chasm]]. The sibling and Chlothar followed it to a strange sanctuary, only to realize the hilichurl was not Caribert. However, deep within they would eventually meet the "[[Vedrfolnir|Sinner]]," who imbued Chlothar with [[Abyss|Abyssal power]]. The two eventually made their way out of the cavern and administered a second dose of the medication to Caribert.

Caribert regained his sentience but was initially horrified to see what he had become. Chlothar calmed him down and told him not to take his mask under any circumstances, which Caribert agreed to. However, when the sibling and Chlothar decided to go back to the sanctuary and find the deity, Caribert took off his mask and saw his reflection in a mirror. The mental anguish caused him to flee, and he was gone by the time Chlothar and the sibling returned. They eventually caught up to Caribert by the edge of a cliff, who took off his mask again and was enveloped by abyssal energies. Exactly what transpired after this is unclear, but Chlothar tells the sibling that Caribert was going to transcend his tragic fate and become the "[[Abyss Order|Loom of Fate]]". 

It is later revealed that Caribert could not become the Loom of Fate as was initially planned, and instead died at the age of 8 while being used as fodder for its construction.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|World-Order Narration|quote='''Caribert:''' Any chance at living was stripped away from me when I was eight years old, my consciousness left to mature in an illusory world of nothingness.}}</ref> While his body no longer existed in the physical world, a fragment of his consciousness remained within the Loom and retained the ability to control its incomplete state. Caribert used the incomplete Loom's ability to implant false memories to trick [[Dainsleif]] allowing the Abyss Order to acquire the Eye of the First [[Field Tiller]] - which was a requirement for their plan to finish the Loom into its final form capable of weaving new Ley Lines.

Caribert deeply mourned being denied the right to exist in Teyvat and experience the joys of life as a normal human would. To achieve what semblance of humanity he could from his quasi-existential state, Caribert also used the memory-implanting powers of the incomplete Loom to surreptitiously achieve two personal, harmless goals before the Abyss Order completed it.

The first was to interact with the inhabitants of [[Vimara Village]] in their memories, as he wished for the chance to know what his life could have been like if he were actually alive. During this time, he became beloved by the villagers, who saw him as a kind and gentle person. Secondly, he implanted a comforting story into the memories of other hilichurls of Teyvat - because he wished for them to have some mental peace after recalling the comfort his own father's bedtime story brought to his suffering when he first discovered his monstrous form as a child. Having fulfilled this final act of kindness, both Caribert's consciousness and the space which used to house it eventually dissipated soon after.

Caribert is also responsible for taking a photo of the Traveler and their sibling together through some unknown means while they were in his realm of consciousness, allowing them to preserve a fragment of the memory of their reunion which would otherwise have been lost forever as the space and the consciousness supporting it collapsed.

===Appearance===
<!--Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 2 paragraphs with 3-4 sentences each.-->
Caribert shares the same appearance as a normal hilichurl, but with a silk scarf wrapped around his left wrist to allow Chlothar to easily identify him.

In his human form, his robes are similar in appearance to that of his father's. He has black hair, fair skin, and deep blue eyes that hold the same star-shaped irises as "pure-blood" Khaenri'ahns.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Destined Encounter|quote='''Kaeya:''' [...] I recognize your eyes...<br>'''Kaeya:''' You're a pure-blood Khaenri'ahn, aren't you?}}</ref> He also wears a diamond-shaped earring on his left ear. The silk scarf wrapped on his left wrist is present visible, and unfurls during a cutscene in ''[[World-Order Narration]]''.
