{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the quest marker)
:'''Paimon:''' (Traveler), something seems strange here... Urgh... Paimon's nose is starting to itch...
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, look over there! The Fungi have encircled something... That seems to be an Aranara!
:'''Paimon:''' (Traveler), let's go and help out!

;(After defeating the enemies)
:'''???:''' Oh, it's a Nara. A golden and brave Nara...
:'''Paimon:''' Hey there! Paimon's Paimon and {{MC|m=he's|f=she's}} (Traveler). Why're you here all alone? Everyone at [[Vanarana]] is busy preparing for [[Festival Utsava]], y'know.
:'''Arapandu:''' [[Arapandu]] has a very important task to do for Festival Utsava, for [[Apam Woods]], and for [[Nara Varuna]].
:'''Paimon:''' Well, that makes you Arapandu, then. But "Nara Varuna"? Hmm. That name sounds kinda familiar.
:'''Arapandu:''' Nara Varuna... {{MC|m=She|f=He}} is a golden and brave Nara, just like Nara (Traveler).
:'''Arapandu:''' When the moon and sun couldn't be seen, even the leaves of big trees in Vanarana were gnawed off by the wind, and their branches rotted away in the black rain.
:'''Arapandu:''' Vana's pain dripped into the soil. The smell of iron and salt was everywhere...
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa...
:'''Arapandu:''' No one knows how many sunsets and sunrises passed before Nara Varuna came. A Golden Nara, who spoke a Golden language.
:'''Arapandu:''' {{MC|m=She|f=He}} and Aranara brought back the moon and the sun. The [[Varuna Contraption]] washed away Vanarana's pain. The black rain was gone and the smell of iron and salt was no more.
:'''Arapandu:''' Everyone from Vanarana thanked and liked Nara Varuna who was like the sun, mud, and the dew drops.
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, that sounds amazing! {{MC|m=She|f=He}} must have been a good Nara!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe... But Nara (Traveler) has also helped lots of people, for which lots of people are thankful...
:'''Paimon:''' You'll definitely like Nara (Traveler) as well, Arapandu!
:{{DIcon}} ...
:'''Arapandu:''' After {{MC|m=she|f=he}} left Vanarana, many were born from the soil and many returned to the soil.
:'''Arapandu:''' Later, the branches and leaves of the Varuna Contraption grew weak. The [[Varunastra]] was like a scared finch and flapped its wings wildly. It then rained a lot. Very strange.
:'''Arapandu:''' Now running mushrooms have settled in Vana. Seeds that have never been seen before are everywhere...
:'''Paimon:''' ...Do you mean the Fungi and spores? Actually, that said, what are the Varuna Contraption and the Varunastra exactly?
:'''Paimon:''' Could they be powerful weapons?
:{{DIcon}} A blade that can slice Valuka into two pieces.
::'''Paimon:''' Wait! That would be too powerful!
:{{DIcon}} Maybe they aren't weapons...
::'''Paimon:''' What could they be then?
::{{DIcon}} They could be winged Aranara made out of water...
::'''Paimon:''' Wouldn't those just be Oceanid Mimics!?
:'''Arapandu:''' Hmm... No, not right. Nara (Traveler) and Paimon both wrong.
:'''Arapandu:''' Let's go to somewhere high above. Arapandu will tell you.

;(After talking to Arapandu)
:'''Paimon:''' Urgh... Something is seriously off with the air here...
:'''Arapandu:''' Very bad seeds. Cannot participate in Festival Utsava like this.

{{Quest Description|update|The intermittent rain in Apam Woods and the spores spreading all over appear to be caused by the Varuna Contraption acting up. The Aranara are trying to fix the machine for Vana and Festival Utsava.}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the marked area)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! What's over there!? It's magnificent!
:'''Arapandu:''' Now Nara (Traveler) and Paimon know. That is the Varunastra. But the Varuna Contraption is in a deeper place, somewhere as deep as roots.
:'''Paimon:''' We've underestimated Nara Varuna. Paimon didn't think it would be this big...
:{{DIcon}} Such power is not to be underestimated...
:'''Arapandu:''' Before the black rain and before Nara Varuna came to [[Vana]], [[Aramuhukunda]] and the Lord of Dendro created the [[Varuna Contraption]]. Rain gave life to many things.
:'''Arapandu:''' Black rain, black mud, and many other bad things made a mess of Vana.
:'''Arapandu:''' Before {{MC|m=she|f=he}} came, Arapandu had never seen such a brave Nara. {{MC|m=She|f=He}} fixed the machine together with Aranara, just like the sun driving away the sleepy fog.
:'''Arapandu:''' Nara Varuna is no longer in Vanarana. Aramuhukunda is no longer in Vanarana... But Aranara must fix the Varuna Contraption again for Festival Utsava and Vana.
:'''Paimon:''' We promised [[Araja]] and [[Arama]] to help prepare for Festival Utsava. As they say, the fire is bigger and stronger when more Nara help pick firewood, right?
:'''Arapandu:''' Eek!
:'''Paimon:''' Um! No, no, Paimon meant that everything will go smoothly with more Nara helping out! Don't be afraid, it has nothing to do with fire! They're not related at all!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, you've outsmarted yourself yet again.
:'''Paimon:''' Aw, come on. We're here in Sumeru, you know? Paimon just wanted to show everyone that she knows lots of stuff too...
:'''Arapandu:''' Arapandu not scared. Paimon has good heart, just like Nara (Traveler) and Nara Varuna. Paimon is friend of Aranara.
:'''Arapandu:''' [[Aranakula]], [[Arabalika]], [[Arakunti]], and Arapandu want to heal the Varuna Contraption, but...
:'''Arapandu:''' There are too many spores and Fungi, so we can't do anything.
:'''Arapandu:''' Arapandu doesn't have a powerful [[Ararakalari]] like Arabalika, and the strange rain made the Fungi fiercer...
:'''Paimon:''' Hold on. Ararakalari? Arana told Paimon that it can be used to repel [[Marana]]...
:'''Arapandu:''' Powerful Ararakalari can drive away Fungi. Arapandu's Ararakalari is weak. Can't do anything to Fungi.
:'''Paimon:''' What? Ararakalari can be used that way?
:{{DIcon}} Ararakalari should be the general name for a certain type of ability...
:'''Arapandu:''' Nara (Traveler) is smarter than Paimon.
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh...
:'''Arapandu:''' Different Aranara have different Ararakalari, but all Aranara gain the power to use it from the plants of Vana.
:'''Arapandu:''' Arabalika's Ararakalari is very powerful, not afraid of large Fungi and large iron Nara.
:'''Paimon:''' Large iron Nara?
:'''Arapandu:''' Large iron Nara are very big and have two arms and two legs like Nara (Traveler), but only have one eye.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, you're talking about Ruin Guards!
:{{DIcon}} Pretty clever, Paimon.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe.
:'''Arapandu:''' Oh! There are Fungi on the trees over there... Arabalika can defeat them, but Arapandu can't...
:'''Arapandu:''' Nara (Traveler) not afraid of [[Fungi]] either. You do not use Ararakalari, but you are very powerful. Destroy them, like strong gust blowing away a leaf! Whoosh!
:'''Arapandu:''' If not dealt with, spores and Fungi will multiply... Nara (Traveler)...
:'''Paimon:''' Leave them to us! Nara (Traveler) should be able to deal with them in an instant! Right?
----
;(Approach one of the fungi spots)
:'''Arapandu:''' Be careful, Nara (Traveler). Strange rain has made the Fungi stronger.
:'''Arapandu:''' They should be easier to defeat once the rain stops...

;(After defeating the first fungus)
:'''Arapandu:''' Nara (Traveler) is like the powerful wind, but there's still one more. Please handle it.

;(Approach the second fungi spot)
:'''Arapandu:''' Be careful, Nara (Traveler). Strange rain has made the Fungi stronger.
:'''Arapandu:''' They should be easier to defeat once the rain stops...

;(After defeating the second fungus)
:'''Arapandu:''' We're safe, Nara (Traveler). We should go to the Nara "rest stop."
:'''Paimon:''' What kinda of place is the "rest stop"?
:'''Arapandu:''' A place closer to the Varuna Contraption up ahead. You know when we there.
----
;(Approach the rest stop)
:'''Paimon:''' Urgh... Something is seriously off with the air here...{{verify|check for additional lines}}
:'''Paimon:''' So this is the "rest stop," huh? There are some signs that Aranara were here earlier.
:'''Paimon:''' The Varuna Contraption looks even more impressive from here. Urgh... the pressure is so intense...
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, watch out in case you get sucked in.
:'''Paimon:''' That won't happen! Paimon hopes...?
:'''Arapandu:''' We made an agreement. Will meet up at the "rest stop" after healing the Varuna Contraption's branches and leaves.
:'''Arapandu:''' Then, we will banish the bad bugs gnawing on the Varuna Contraption's roots and heal it.
:'''Paimon:''' By the way, what do you mean by "the Varuna Contraption's branches and leaves"?
:'''Arapandu:''' The Varuna Contraption's branches and leaves are everywhere in Vana. They give the machine power to turn black rain into good rain. Good rain then gives things life.
:'''Arapandu:''' Like how rainwater flows into a stream and then into a lake, the branches and leaves gather bits and pieces that go into the Varuna Contraption.
:'''Arapandu:''' The Varuna Contraption is now no longer the same. It is like broken branches have blocked the rainwater, so streams can't form. Without streams, the lake dries out.
:'''Paimon:''' Urgh... Paimon still doesn't get it...
:{{DIcon}} It's basically what happens when you starve.
::'''Paimon:''' Oh! Paimon won't have strength to work if she doesn't eat! Does this mean the Varuna Contraption is hungry-angry?
::{{DIcon}} No, I don't think that's the case...
:::'''Paimon:''' Mmm, that's true! No one has the strength to throw a tantrum when they're hungry, anyway!
::{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} It's like when a safe transportation route is blocked by roadblocks...
::'''Paimon:''' Then we need to clear all the roadblocks to keep going!
::'''Paimon:''' We just need to find another path, then! Who decided that we have to take this route anyway...
::{{DIcon}} Yeah, who decided this route?
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, we need to heal the branches and leaves first, right?
:'''Arapandu:''' Yes, Arapandu will take Paimon and Nara (Traveler) there.

;(Approach the marked area)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa... Paimon never thought that we'd find them in a place like this!
:'''Paimon:''' Hold on... Eh? You sure these are "branches and leaves"? They look like...
:{{DIcon}} Like stones placed by Aranara.
:'''Arapandu:''' Stone leaves, stone branches. They were created by Aramuhukunda and the Lord of Dendro and can channel Vanarana's power into the Varuna Contraption
:{{DIcon}} So the Varuna Contraption is like a big tree.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, so that's how it is, huh?
:'''Arapandu:''' Hmm... Oh no. The three leaves need to be turned to face the branch, but Arapandu is not strong enough.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, you Aranara are kinda small. Don't worry, just leave this to Nara (Traveler).
:'''Arapandu:''' Arabalika might be able to do it, but Aranakula and Arakunti...
:'''Arapandu:''' Still, we need to solve this problem first. Nara (Traveler), Arapandu will leave it to you.

;(Talk to Arapandu again)
:'''Arapandu:''' Just turn all three leaves to face the branch. Thank you, Nara (Traveler).
----
;(Adjusting all of the rocks correctly)
:'''Paimon:''' This should do the trick!

;(Approach Arapandu)
:'''Arapandu:''' Thank you, Nara (Traveler). Leave the rest to Arapandu.
:'''Arapandu:''' But it has been too long. Don't know if it will work this time.
:'''Paimon:''' What!? There's a chance it can fail?
:'''Arapandu:''' It worked before, but this time it may or may not work. Just like how the sun rose last time and the time before that, but nobody knows if it will rise the next time.
:'''Arapandu:''' Only after the sun rises next time can Paimon say: "Oh, the sun has risen again."
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, wait, that's not good! What if the sun never rises again?
:'''Arapandu:''' Paimon, there's no need to be afraid. Nara (Traveler) is golden like the sun, just like Nara Varuna. A brave Nara, Nara (Traveler) is.
:'''Arapandu:''' Nara Varuna returned the moon and sun to us. Nara (Traveler) can also do that.
:'''Paimon:''' ...Yes! Paimon also believes in (Traveler). {{MC|m=He|f=She}} can overcome any difficulty!
:{{DIcon}} Don't you worry.
:'''Arapandu:''' But for now, leave this to Arapandu.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon thinks it... worked?
:'''Arapandu:''' Yes, the branch and leaves here are healed.
:'''Paimon:''' That's great! And your Aranara dance was really interesting, too!
:{{DIcon}} You could learn some fancy footwork from the Aranara, Paimon.
:'''Paimon:''' Sounds like a great idea!
:{{DIcon}} I mean, more exercise will be good for you, given how much you eat...
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Paimon's been running around everywhere with you, (Traveler). That counts as exercise!
:'''Paimon:''' Still, this won't be enough to fix the Varuna Contraption, will it?
:'''Arapandu:''' There are three more places like this in Vana. Arabalika is very strong and might succeed... But Arapandu's very worried about Aranakula and Arakunti. Vana has become more dangerous after the strange rain.
:'''Paimon:''' What say we help you go check on them, then? After all, we can't prepare for Festival Utsava in peace if the Varuna Contraption isn't fixed.
:'''Arapandu:''' With the help of Paimon and Nara (Traveler), the Varuna Contraption will surely be fixed soon. Life will return to Vana like before.
:'''Arapandu:''' Aranakula went to the {{color|buzzword|Yasna Monument}}. There is an Aranara memorial to Nara Varuna in the depths of Vana, but we haven't been there for a long time because of the Fungi and spores.
:'''Arapandu:''' Aranakula is used to being with soil and seeds. Familiar with all things born from the soil.
:'''Arapandu:''' Find him. Tell him Arapandu's name. Then he will not be afraid.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh? He sounds like a rather timid Aranara.
:'''Arapandu:''' Arabalika's Ararakalari is very strong! But... But please, Paimon and Nara (Traveler), go check on him...
:'''Arapandu:''' Arabalika is at the {{color|buzzword|Ruins of Dahri}}. That place smells like iron so much... Paimon and Nara (Traveler) must be careful.
:{{DIcon}} We will, thanks!
:'''Arapandu:''' Arakunti is at the {{color|buzzword|Grove of Dreams}}. You can enter dreams from there. He and Nara have a... distant relationship. If he hides, play our music.
:'''Paimon:''' Speaking of that, didn't we get an Aranara music score earlier? We can try playing that if we can't find Arakunti.
:'''Arapandu:''' Arapandu will wait at the "rest stop" and observe how Vana is doing.
:'''Arapandu:''' Aranakula, Arabalika, and Arakunti know to meet up at the "rest stop" after healing the branches and leaves.
:'''Arapandu:''' Golden Nara, brave Nara. May Aramuhukunda watch over Nara (Traveler).
:'''Paimon:''' Yup! You can count on us!
:;(Quest ends)

;(Talk to Arapandu at the rest stop)
:'''Arapandu:''' Aranakula is at the Yasna Monument, Arabalika went to the Ruins of Dahri, and Arakunti is in the Grove of Dreams. Nara (Traveler) and Paimon must be careful.
