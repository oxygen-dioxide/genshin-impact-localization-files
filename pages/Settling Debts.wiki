'''Settling Debts''' is a [[Random Event]] World Quest that can occur while exploring the world.

==Steps==
# Defeat the [[Fatui Pyro Agent|Fatui Agent]]

==Gameplay Notes==
* The [[Bishui Plain]] starting location triggers if you stay around the area between [[Wuwang Hill]] and [[Dihua Marsh]].
** The Pyro Agent will be located near three [[Electro Hilichurl Shooter]]s, which will probably be [[aggro]]'d while fighting the Agent. They aren't difficult to deal with, however, and all four can be instantly killed by luring or knocking them into the water.
