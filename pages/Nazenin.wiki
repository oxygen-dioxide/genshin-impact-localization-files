{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Peseng:''' If I join [[the Eremites]], I'll be able to both support my family and go on adventures in the desert. Wouldn't it be awesome?
:'''Nazenin:''' Awesome!? You can't even hold a kitchen knife properly! Not to mention handling a fight!
:'''Peseng:''' A kitchen knife... M&mdash;Mercenaries don't fight with kitchen knives! They use hunting knives! They're completely different kinds of things!
:'''Nazenin:''' Where is this confidence coming from? You can't even handle regular housework, and you'd trust yourself to deal with bandits and beasts out in the desert? I doubt you'll even survive the heat!
:'''Peseng:''' You...!
:'''Nazenin:''' What? Am I not telling the truth? Even the omnipotent [[King Deshret]] perished in the desert! You think you're better than King Deshret?
:'''Peseng:''' That's...
:'''Nazenin:''' If you die out there, my life as a widow won't be any easier.
:'''Nazenin:''' Anyway, you are not joining the Eremites! Do you hear me?
