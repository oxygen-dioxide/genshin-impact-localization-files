==Trivia==
* Although this food has the word "[[Teyvat]]" in its name and is served at the [[Shops#Restaurants|Restaurant Shops]] in each region's main city, [[Yicheng]] calls it a [[Mondstadt]] dish during the {{Quest|A Bottomless Appetite}}.
* Based on the image and description, Teyvat Fried Egg is traditionally served sunny-side up. This tradition is shared by Germany and other German-speaking countries, by which Mondstadt is primarily inspired. The original Chinese text for "a taste of the summer sun" in the delicious version emphasizes the light of the sun ({{Lang|"sunshine-like warmth"|zh=阳光般和煦}}); this may correspond to the German for fried egg ''{{wt|Spiegelei}}'', literally meaning "mirror egg," that some think is from the sense of "shiny yolk."
