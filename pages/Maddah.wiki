==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Maddah:''' How can I keep people interested in hearing my stories...?
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
::'''Maddah:''' I just drank the manager's &mdash; I mean, [[Enteka|the acting manager]]'s coffee that she brought over. I feel fine physically, but my mental state is troubling.
::'''Maddah:''' Everyone clearly liked my hero stories at first, so why are they rarely coming to hear them now?
::'''Maddah:''' Have sophisticated, mighty heroes already fallen out of fashion?
::{{DIcon}} I don't think that's the problem...
::'''Maddah:''' Really? Then why does everyone leave before the story even gets going?
::'''Maddah:''' Some guests from afar have even said that the stories aren't as fresh as those from [[Liyue]] about [[Tea Master Liu Su#Rex Lapis and Osial|gods descending to the battlefield]] or [[A Knight's Journey Through Liyue|maid-knights fighting against giant mechanical beasts]] and the like...
::'''Maddah:''' But those stories sound simply outrageous! I find it really hard to accept a story that can't immerse listeners with a sense of realism.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Maddah:''' *sigh* How worrying...
