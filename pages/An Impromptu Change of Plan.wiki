#Meet the [[adepti]] in [[Jueyun Karst]]
#Fight with support from the adepti

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|During the rite, the appointed moment arrived. Yet when the clouds parted, a divine carcass crashed down to earth, knocking all the offerings over. Amid the chaos and confusion, the [[Qixing]] ordered that the assassin be arrested. Unable to prove your innocence, you were forced to accept the help of [[Childe]] of the [[Fatui]], and as suggested by him, you are now headed for Jueyun Karst, a hidden abode where the adepti dwell...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(At Jueyun Karst)
:{{A|vo lyaq002 2 mooncarver 01.ogg}} '''???:''' And who might we be? Those that dare enter Jueyun Karst?
:{{DIcon}} I was sent here.
:{{DIcon}} Please take a look at this.
:{{A|vo lyaq002 2 mooncarver 02.ogg}} '''???:''' A [[Sigil of Permission]]... Many a season has passed since one was last in the presence of such an item.
:{{A|vo lyaq002 2 mooncarver 03.ogg}} '''[[Moon Carver]]:''' He before you is the mighty and illuminated adeptus, Moon Carver. Speak, traveler. What business have you here?
:{{A|vo lyaq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Actually...
:{{A|vo lyaq002 2 millelithsergeant 01.ogg}} '''Millelith Sergeant:''' It's the assassin! They dared to flee here to Jueyun Karst!
:{{A|vo lyaq002 2 millelithsoldier 01.ogg}} '''Millelith Soldier:''' Sir, we've already stepped too far into Jueyun Karst ourselves...
:{{A|vo lyaq002 2 millelithsergeant 02.ogg}} '''Millelith Sergeant:''' We... Argh, there's no choice. Apprehending the assassin is top priority, we must press on!
:{{A|vo lyaq002 2 mooncarver 04.ogg}} '''Moon Carver:''' ...disturbing our borders.
:{{A|vo lyaq002 2 mooncarver 05.ogg}} '''Moon Carver:''' See them gone. One will not have interruption.
----
;(After defeating the Millelith guards)
:{{A|vo lyaq002 4 mooncarver 01.ogg}}'''Moon Carver:''' We've digressed. State your purpose, traveler.
:{{A|vo lyaq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well...
:;(Scene fades to black)
{{Cutscene Description|You tell Moon Carver what happened at Yujing Terrace...}}
:{{A|vo lyaq002 4 mooncarver 02.ogg}} '''Moon Carver:''' Preposterous...
:{{A|vo lyaq002 4 mooncarver 03.ogg}} '''Moon Carver:''' PREPOSTEROUS!!!
:{{A|vo lyaq002 4 mooncarver 04.ogg}} '''Moon Carver:''' The Liyue Qixing... utterly disappointing.
:{{A|vo lyaq002 4 mooncarver 05.ogg}} '''Moon Carver:''' How could someone possibly assassinate [[Rex Lapis]] during the Rite of Descension...
:{{A|vo lyaq002 4 mooncarver 06.ogg}} '''Moon Carver:''' And then place suspicion upon the attendees!?
:{{A|vo lyaq002 4 mooncarver 07.ogg}} '''Moon Carver:''' ...
:{{A|vo lyaq002 4 mooncarver 08.ogg}} '''Moon Carver:''' Traveler, of the unjust accusations placed upon you, one has become aware.
:{{A|vo lyaq002 4 mooncarver 09.ogg}} '''Moon Carver:''' The mind knows its answer. Though one must consult with one's fellows, lest the mind be misguided.
:{{A|vo lyaq002 4 mooncarver 10.ogg}} '''Moon Carver:''' Go. Take your Sigil of Permission, carry with you a message.
:{{DIcon}} Who should I look for?
:{{DIcon}} Where should I go?
:{{A|vo lyaq002 4 mooncarver 11.ogg}} '''Moon Carver:''' [[Mountain Shaper]] and [[Cloud Retainer]] can be found here. Only fate will decide if you shall find them &mdash; only fate.
:{{A|vo lyaq002 4 mooncarver 12.ogg}} '''Moon Carver:''' There exists a [[Xiao|Conqueror of Demons]], a [[Yaksha|Guardian Yaksha]]. Go to [[Wangshu Inn]]. There you shall seek him.
