Kaveh dons a white shirt with a high collar and a triangular chest window. Along his collar he wears a golden, angular ornament along with his cape. His cape is a mix of black, gold, and blue, but majorly red. It is split into two halves with intricate patterns. Along his waist, he wears a coastal blue sash, white tassels with golden ornaments, and his {{Dendro}} [[Vision]] on his left. His pants are colored black with some patterning and his footwear is a pair of white socks with a sandal-like structure.

Kaveh's hair hangs down the back of his head, complemented with some red hair clips holding his hair, and a slight braid. On his left, he wears a blue feather tucked under one of his hair strands and above his ear. He also sports a pair of golden, angular ear ornaments with small red and blue squares inside of them.
