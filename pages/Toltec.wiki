==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Toltec:''' This isn't good...
:{{DIcon}} Did something bad happen?
::'''Toltec:''' "Something bad," you say... I could easily come up with a whole basket of that stuff.
::'''Toltec:''' You know, we have plenty of tribespeople who help escort [[Iktomisaur]]s to read the trends of the Ley Lines and [[phlogiston]] &mdash; including me, and I'm one of the better-spoken ones.
::'''Toltec:''' Honestly speaking, our ley Lines{{sic}} seem to be falling further and further below "healthy," and the [[Abyss]] is a threat that cannot be taken lightly...
::'''Toltec:''' But I suppose life isn't all bad, eh? Always one or two things that can make you happy, and all that.
::'''Toltec:''' When I feel down, I just hang out in our tribe's trophy room, focusing on the woven scrolls and paintings.
::'''Toltec:''' Even if it's not for work, it's still a great pastime.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry to bother you...
::'''Toltec:''' No, it's okay.
