|description    = A two-story building with an attached workshop and separate balcony that uses an asymmetric layout. It exudes the distinctive Petrichor style.<br>This type of house is extremely spacious, and the attached workshop features its own entrance and a pipe through which to ventilate exhaust, cleverly ensuring that work and living areas are completely separated and neither will interfere with the other. It is said that even if you were to undertake the design of a "Teyvat Grand Cannon" within, it would not disturb those taking an afternoon nap elsewhere in the dwelling, showcasing the advantages offered by its incredible isolation of work from daily life.
