{{Quote|As the Acting Grand Master of the Knights, Jean has always been devoted to her duties and maintaining peace in Mondstadt.<br />She had taken precautions long before the onset of Stormterror's assault, and she will guard Mondstadt with her life as always.|Description from the Official Website<ref>Official ''Genshin Impact'' Website: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/character/mondstadt?char=0 Jean]</ref>}}

==Personality==
{{Quote|The righteous and rigorous Dandelion Knight, and Acting Grand Master of Mondstadt's Knights of Favonius.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}

As the acting Grand Master for the Knights, Jean takes all of her responsibilities and duties associated with the role seriously, regardless of how minor the tasks may seem, such as finding a lost cat. Due to this, Jean often exhausts herself trying to complete commissions from the locals, much to the concern of her fellow members.

Her devotion to her duties stems from two reasons; her upbringing as a child, and [[Varka]]'s teachings. Even though he consistently takes his duties lightly, his relaxed and unruly personality has contributed to her growth. She shows no resentment towards his attitude, instead vowing to ensure that the city will be more prosperous and welcoming when he returns. Her work ethic makes her well-liked by both Mondstadt's citizens, her fellow members, and is noted by other organizations. Although she prefers using peaceful methods to solve problems, she will not hesitate to use force if necessary. She has a habit of calling [[Diluc]] her senior, even well after he left the Knights. Despite this, she acknowledges that they both share the same vision of protecting Mondstadt.

She sees [[Vennessa]] as a role model because of her exploits and how she left an impressive legacy behind and works tirelessly to maintain her legacy and Mondstadt's safety. Whenever she feels troubled or confused, she often heads to the Great Tree in [[Windrise]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Master's Day Off (Quest)}}</ref>

Jean was raised by [[Frederica Gunnhildr|her mother]] to be the successor to the Gunnhildr Clan.</p><p>She was trained in all the things a knight must know and all the qualities they must exhibit, from discipline, etiquette and conduct, to knowledge of history and ballads, as well as maintaining peak swordsmanship and physical fitness. Only by upholding this standard can Jean carry the mantle of the Gunnhildr Clan, whose motto is: "For Mondstadt, as always."</p><p>Some time ago, there was a joke commonly told in Mondstadt's taverns: A Gunnhildr learns to say "For Mondstadt, as always" before learning to say "Mommy."</p><p>As a child, Jean once lifted her head up from the book she was reading, "[[Breeze Amidst the Forest|Breeze Amidst the Forest - Ballad Selection]]," and saw the other children her age happily playing with pinwheels outside the window. The young Jean knew in that moment what her family motto meant to her.</p><p>Now, when she lifts her head up from her piles of paperwork and sees the next generation of children doing the same thing, Acting Grand Master Jean has no regrets about her years of service to that motto.</p><p>"You have to give your all to do the right thing.

Jean gladly lends a hand whenever she can.</p><p>"The chance to help someone in need is reason enough for a knight."</p><p>To her, her knightly duty takes priority over her role as Acting Grand Master. She believes helping others herself is the best way to assist.</p><p>She holds her fellow knights to the same standard.</p><p>[[Lisa]] the Librarian once suggested that Jean take a break and "enjoy some afternoon tea, as is befitting of a lady."</p><p>However, to Jean, doing that which is befitting of a knight takes priority over doing that which is befitting of a lady.</p><p>"Jean is so reliable."</p><p>Such is the reputation Jean enjoys in Mondstadt.</p><p>Her only gripe is that there are not enough hours in the day. She could never help all of those in need, even by forgoing sleep.</p><p>The dedication and commitment required to become someone so reliable is unimaginable.</p>

Passed down through generations of knights, the title is bestowed upon only the most distinguished.</p><p>On the day she received the title, Jean excused herself from the celebrations that followed the conferment ceremony. As if following in the footsteps of her childhood hero, she went and stood before the great tree.</p><p>The title of Dandelion Knight symbolizes Vennessa's legacy of resistance and benevolence. So how, Jean thought, could one such as herself be worthy of this honorable title?</p><p>More than a millennium had passed since Mondstadt's restoration. Did she really have what it would take to continue to protect this ancient and proud land of freedom?</p><p>Beneath her outwardly mature visage lay the heart of a young girl, who had only just received the title and remained wholly unprepared for the task that lay before her.</p><p>The wind blew from far away, and she felt it flow within her as it gently whisked away her doubts and worries, leaving her with an unwavering determination:</p><p>For Mondstadt, as always.</p><p>To become a warrior as kind and as determined as Vennessa, and to fight for her people and for freedom... Yes, this was the true meaning of her simple family motto.</p><p>To this day, whenever Jean feels weary or feels herself beginning to waver, she comes and stands before this tree and lets the wind console her once more.

==Trivia==
* Jean is one of the characters with ornaments that glow. While wearing her default outfit, [[Favonian Devotion]], or her alternate outfit, [[Gunnhildr's Legacy]], when Jean's Elemental Burst is ready, the green gem on her collar and the two green gems on her belt will glow along with her Vision.
* Jean is currently the only playable Anemo character to utilize the tall character model; all other playable Anemo characters use either the short or medium model.
* Jean and Barbara are sisters, but when their parents separated, Jean stayed with their mother while Barbara stayed with their father.
* She owns a pet tortoise.
* Jean's favorite food is pizza from [[Cat's Tail]]. She claims to have no disliked foods, as true knights can't afford to be picky eaters.
* NPCs and interactables that mention Jean:
** [[Ellin]] is a huge fan of Jean's, mentioning in her regular dialogue as well as her Commission Quest [[Ellin, the Wannabe Knight]].
** On the [[Cat's Tail Message Board#Fatui|Cat's Tail Message Board]], one message complains about the Fatui and remarks that Jean must be exhausted from dealing with them.
* Jean's Chinese voice actress, {{zh|林簌}}, is one of the directors of ''Genshin Impact''{{'}}s Chinese voice actors.<ref group="Note">Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV18Z4y1V7rB Version 1.1 Chinese Special Livestream]; Zhongli's VA introduces himself as a director, and Paimon's VA then notes that this is the first time with two of the directors in one livestream.</ref> She also voices [[Ganyu]].
* Jean is one of the first two characters to get an alternate costume, the other being her sister [[Barbara]].
* Jean is one of only two residents of Mondstadt who are aware that [[Venti]] is [[Barbatos]], having figured it out on her own, and the other being [[Diluc]]. While Venti also revealed himself to [[Stanley]], the latter does not remember their conversation, and the nun [[Gotelinde]] simply thought that Venti was lying.
* Jean personally edited the [[Knights of Favonius Handbook - 5th Edition|5th edition of the Knights of Favonius Handbook]], ostensibly to update it for current circumstances.
* The cloak on Jean's default costume ([[Favonian Devotion]])'s icon is colored black, while every other media that Jean appears in has it colored dark blue. It is unknown if this is intentional or not.
* Jean bears some physical resemblance to [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Durandal|Durandal]], a playable character in ''{{w|Honkai Impact 3rd}}''.
* Jean is seen wielding the [[Favonius Sword]] in her official art and wish art.
* Jean is known by these aliases or titles:

===Etymology===
* Jean is a female English name derived from John, which itself is derived from the Hebrew {{Lang|mini=1|he=יוחנן|he_rm=Yôḥānān|he_tl=Yahweh is gracious.}}
* Jean's Constellation, {{wt|leo|Leo|Latin}} {{wt|minor|Minor|Latin}}, is Latin for "The Lesser Lion."
* Jean's Chinese name, {{zh|琴|Qín}}, can be translated as "lyre." The Chinese version of [[State of the Holy Lyre der Himmel]] uses this to make a pun; when Jean praises the [[Holy Lyre der Himmel]], she initially refers to it as {{zh|琴|Qín}}, giving Paimon the impression that she was praising herself.
