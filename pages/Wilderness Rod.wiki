|description  = A rather pedestrian-looking wooden fishing rod. Apart from being quite sturdy, {{sic|{{Not a typo|even to point}}}} where you could use it for self-defense, it lacks any sort of special features. But the old adage holds true &mdash; "the novice's rod shall be the tent-pole of their veterancy." Even the greatest anglers must surely have started with this simple implement.
