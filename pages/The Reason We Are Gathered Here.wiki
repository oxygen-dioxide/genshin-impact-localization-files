;(After passing time)
:{{A|vo nllq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' In the blink of an eye, it's already debate time!
:{{A|vo nllq003 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We did a lot of preparations with Nilou! Hopefully they were helpful.

;(Approach the theater)
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 safwan 01.ogg}} '''Safwan:''' Hello and welcome, everyone. I am Safwan, a scholar from the Akademiya, and I will serve as this debate's adjudicator.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 safwan 02.ogg}} '''Safwan:''' I swear to judge both parties with the utmost wisdom and impartiality. I will neither interfere with the proceedings nor demonstrate bias.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 safwan 03.ogg}} '''Safwan:''' I ask for both parties to stand. May the Dendro Archon also serve as a witness to this duel of wits.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 01.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' Since you so desperately demand an explanation, I will expound on the Akademiya's stance.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 02.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' You may have misunderstood us from the outset, and believed that the Akademiya is prejudiced against you.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 03.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' However, the truth is that the Akademiya wishes for every resident of Sumeru to be afforded opportunities to grow and cultivate their wisdom.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 04.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' Therefore, the works they consume should also possess enlightening qualities and intellectual value.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 05.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' We have failed to identify these qualities in the shows performed at Zubayr Theater.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 06.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' In other words, instead of struggling against the Akademiya in pointless confrontations, if you had spent your time reflecting on improving the quality of your shows and enlightening your audience...
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 07.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' Zubayr Theater would not be today facing such a tragic fate.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aggressive from the get-go. He's really putting on the pressure...!
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Can Nilou stand her ground?
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' (Calm down, Nilou... First, carefully analyze what he said.)
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' (He said that we were shut down not because the Akademiya looks down on the arts, but rather because our shows aren't up to their standards. However...)

:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' In your eyes, our shows can't meet the Akademiya's expectations.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Shouldn't it be the audience who decides if a show is intellectual or enlightening? Why is someone from the Akademiya judging that?
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 05.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Also, I believe that there is no such thing as a wiser or more enlightening performance.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 06.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Art doesn't discriminate, and it appeals to all. Everyone has the right to appreciate art.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 08.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' Appreciation is but a primitive form of satisfaction. Guidance and enlightenment are necessary if we are to induce growth in the performers as well as the audience.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 09.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' This stance holds performers to a higher standard and encourages the development of the arts.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 10.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' If all performances are simple-minded, require little effort to comprehend, and lack any impetus for the betterment of society, then the people will not be able to develop a greater level of artistic understanding.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 11.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' Nurturing the populace's understanding requires a long and arduous process, and guiding this process is the Akademiya's true goal.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 07.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' (He changed the topic without batting an eye! Good thing I'm prepared.)

:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 09.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Someone at our theater has tried that before.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 10.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' He was a famed artist, but he recognized that very few people could connect with his works.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 11.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' I agree that art should be enlightening, but we can't pursue that goal by creating complicated works.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 12.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' If a work can't tap into an audience's personal experiences or feelings, then its contents may as well be a castle in the sky.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 13.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' What's the point of performing a show that its audience can't even follow?
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 14.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' That would only be forcing people to watch something they don't like.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 12.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' You can only reach that conclusion from a place of ignorance.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 15.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' In that case, before passing judgment, you should first become a better dancer than me.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 farhad 01.ogg}} '''Farhad:''' You tell them, Nilou!
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 kourosh 01.ogg}} '''Kourosh:''' Looks like he's backed himself into a corner...
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 safwan 04.ogg}} '''Safwan:''' As the party holding the burden of proof, Sharif has failed to provide sufficient support for his judgment of the quality of Zubayr Theater's programs.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 safwan 05.ogg}} '''Safwan:''' Likewise, the definition that Nilou put forth is but her personal opinion. Neither party is the victor for this particular point of contention.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 safwan 06.ogg}} '''Safwan:''' ...Additionally, I must request that both parties exercise greater control on their emotions.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Keep it up, Nilou! You're doing great!
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 13.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' In that case, I shall speak of more concrete matters. The essence of this issue is that you have violated the law, so you must now pay the price for your transgression.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 14.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' This course of action is also completely procedurally sound. We have already contacted Zubayr Theater multiple times regarding the theater's repertoire.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 15.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' However, you have consciously ignored our warnings &mdash; or perhaps your compliance was purely superficial. Regardless, that failure has indirectly led to the present day's proceedings.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 safwan 07.ogg}} '''Safwan:''' That is indeed so, according to the laws decreed by the Akademiya.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 16.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' (He's started talking about procedural stuff, so I need to focus on...)

:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 17.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Mr. Zubayr has already provided signed copies of all documentation related to our operations. Everything is perfectly filled out and valid.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 18.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Although the theater's performances don't align with the Akademiya's requests, the law doesn't say that Zubayr Theater can be demolished only because of that reason.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 19.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Demolition notices need to be provided in writing and made available to the public. Otherwise, the theater can continue to operate as long as its license is valid.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 20.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Failing to follow these rules makes your stance procedurally unsound.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 abe 01.ogg}} '''Abhi:''' Yeah, yeah!
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sorin 01.ogg}} '''Sohrin:''' That's right!
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 16.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' ...There are different ways to apply the rules. There is precedent for this.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 17.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' So long as this matter is discussed within the Akademiya, this course of action will come to pass.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 safwan 08.ogg}} '''Safwan:''' Looking at the past 27 cases of similar nature, 90% of them support Sharif's claim and position.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 safwan 09.ogg}} '''Safwan:''' However, the demolition process in those cases was only started after discussion at the Akademiya. In other words, premature notice of demolition is indeed a rash act.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 21.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' That's more than enough. We've proven that the order is unreasonable as it currently stands.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 18.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' ...Hmph. Cease your futile resistance.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nilou's definitely won this point, right?
:{{DIcon}} She still can't let down her guard.
:{{DIcon}} He'll bite back.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're right... Stay focused, Nilou!
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 19.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' Even if permission for demolition has yet to be obtained, it is a fact that your performances violated the Akademiya's policies on numerous occasions.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 20.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' Based on that fact, we can permanently revoke your right to perform in Sumeru.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 22.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Ah...
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 safwan 10.ogg}} '''Safwan:''' Under the current system, it is indeed possible to immediately revoke Zubayr Theater's performing rights.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's a thing!?
:{{DIcon}} I figured.
:{{DIcon}} That's his back-up plan.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 21.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' Rather than protecting Zubayr Theater, I surmise that your true intention is to maintain your hold over your audience, and their patronage as your source of income.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 22.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' Without them, Zubayr Theater is nothing more than an empty building.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 23.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' And without its performances, the theater has nothing else of value.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 23.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' What you said isn't true at all!
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahh, keep it cool, Nilou!
:{{DIcon}} Don't get riled up.
:{{DIcon}} He's intentionally provoking you.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 24.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' (Right, I need to keep calm, but he...)
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 25.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' (Just a little more. Zubayr Theater isn't just a performance venue to us...)

:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 26.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Zubayr Theater isn't simply a performance venue to us &mdash; it means more than that. It's been our home for a long time.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 27.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Ms. Rekhar can't go on adventures anymore, but she has found a stable career and a new life at the theater.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 28.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Her son, Sohrin, has already passed his theater exam, and he'll soon be our newest member.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 29.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Mr. Khasani found a new way to look at art. He decided to stay at the theater to watch us grow.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 30.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Mr. Farhad and Mr. Hushang visit even when there isn't a show going on, and they always tell us lots of entertaining stories.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 31.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Even Inayah wants to stay with us, and she's starting to look forward to a new future.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 32.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Zubayr Theater exists for them... for every single one of us!
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 24.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' Perhaps Zubayr Theater has provided you with a multitude of positive emotions and experiences. However, you have misconstrued something, young miss.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 25.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' The interpersonal relationships you speak of were established upon normal theater operations.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 26.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' Sheikh Zubayr operates the theater for his livelihood, his employees work for their wages, and the audience comes to enjoy performances.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 27.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' Relationships are merely a byproduct in this exchange of interests. They may be pleasant and captivating, but they can only ever be secondary.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 28.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' When scholars collaborate to solve difficult problems, we freely share our knowledge and resources with one another, as if we were all kin.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 29.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' However, this collaboration ends after the results of our work are published.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 30.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' The reason is simple: We are scholars, and there are new projects that await our attention.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He really doesn't think much of relationships. Paimon also thinks he did a lot of prep &mdash; he's been solid as a rock.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 safwan 11.ogg}} '''Safwan:''' Sharif's argument is currently the more persuasive of the two for this point of contention.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 safwan 12.ogg}} '''Safwan:''' The continuance of the interpersonal relationships Nilou spoke of remains hypothetical before the theater's demolition, whereas the situation that Sharif described has been well documented at the Akademiya.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 safwan 13.ogg}} '''Safwan:''' The Akademiya has made significant academic contributions in no small part due to its researchers' efficiency and ability to compartmentalize.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no, what should we do? Things are going in the opposite direction...
:{{DIcon}} Patience, Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} Nilou might be setting him up.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A set-up? So Nilou's got him?
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 33.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' (Good, he's said what he said. The next argument could decide this debate.)
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 34.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' (But... is this really the best thing to do? It might be too cruel to Inayah...)

:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 36.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Mr. Sharif believes that interpersonal relationships are a byproduct of working towards a goal. Once that goal is achieved or abandoned, those relationships would have no more reason to continue.

:{{A|vo nllq003 2 inayah 02.ogg}} '''Inayah:''' Sorry Nilou, as expected, I should be the one to say it. You don't need to shoulder this responsibility for me.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 31.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' ...
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 inayah 03.ogg}} '''Inayah:''' If in your eyes, the purpose of my existence is to become your academic successor, then that goal has ended in complete failure.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 inayah 04.ogg}} '''Inayah:''' By your logic, that means there is no more reason to sustain our relationship as father and daughter.

:{{A|vo nllq003 2 inayah 06.ogg}} '''Inayah:''' You're so immersed in your own world that you can't understand why we come together for the sake of relationships.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 rikard 01.ogg}} '''Rekhar:''' Yeah, don't look down on us!
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 farhad 02.ogg}} '''Farhad:''' You can watch a dance anywhere, but there's only one Zubayr Theater!
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sheikhzubayr 01.ogg}} '''Sheikh Zubayr:''' I'm almost starting to feel sorry for this guy, what with the idiotic things he's said.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 safwan 15.ogg}} '''Safwan:''' Order, order! Members of the audience, do not interrupt debate proceedings!
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 inayah 07.ogg}} '''Inayah:''' I confess that this is the final argument we had prepared. Disown me, and you will win the debate.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 inayah 08.ogg}} '''Inayah:''' But before that, Father, I have some final words to say.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 inayah 09.ogg}} '''Inayah:''' I've been doing some soul-searching. Not about whether I should have run away from home, but whether there was any point to my personal rebellion against you.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 inayah 10.ogg}} '''Inayah:''' I kept trying to earn your approval, but I only disappointed you over and over. The truth is, I ran away from home as a means to vent my recurring frustrations.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 inayah 11.ogg}} '''Inayah:''' That is to say, I was exerting pressure on you, and hoping you'd give up on your lofty expectations.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 inayah 12.ogg}} '''Inayah:''' But by doing that, wasn't I just doing the same thing as you?
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 34.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' ...
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 inayah 13.ogg}} '''Inayah:''' I won't force my expectations upon you anymore. At Zubayr Theater, I have found the life I've always wanted.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 inayah 14.ogg}} '''Inayah:''' I will move on from my family troubles and strive towards my new goal.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 inayah 15.ogg}} '''Inayah:''' But if you dare to harm this place, then I will stand with my friends here and fight against you.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 safwan 16.ogg}} '''Safwan:''' This is not the time to space out, Sharif. The debate is still underway.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 35.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' ...You already consider them to be your friends?
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sheikhzubayr 02.ogg}} '''Sheikh Zubayr:''' You should be asking US that question.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sorin 02.ogg}} '''Sohrin:''' Of course we are!
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 abe 02.ogg}} '''Abhi:''' Miss Inayah is a really good friend!
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 qasani 01.ogg}} '''Khasani:''' It was a bit of a process, but we won her over.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 39.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Make no mistake:
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 40.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' All those who come to Zubayr Theater become one of us. We will always be with her.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 36.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' Hmph, such puerile simplicity. However...
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sharif 37.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' It is surprisingly a relief.
:;(Sharif leaves)
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 safwan 17.ogg}} '''Safwan:''' Wait, what are you...? Ah, never mind.
:;(Safwan follows)
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 41.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' They... left?
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 rikard 02.ogg}} '''Rekhar:''' Does that mean we've won?
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 kourosh 02.ogg}} '''Kourosh:''' We won?
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nilou, you're amazing!
:{{DIcon}} Fantastic job!
:{{DIcon}} Inayah was also brilliant!
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 42.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Ha... Haha...
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 43.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' I relaxed for a moment, and... I feel a little faint...
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 44.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' It looks like he still has a place for her in his heart.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sheikhzubayr 03.ogg}} '''Sheikh Zubayr:''' Terrific work, Nilou and Inayah. They likely won't cause any more trouble for us.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 farhad 03.ogg}} '''Farhad:''' Didn't know you could get so fierce. I have a lot of newfound respect for you two.
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 nilou 45.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' This really took a lot out of me, though. *sigh* I don't ever wanna do this again...
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 sorin 03.ogg}} '''Sohrin:''' Both Miss Nilou and Miss Inayah were so cool!
:{{A|vo nllq003 2 rikard 03.ogg}} '''Rekhar:''' Should we throw a second round of celebrations?

:'''The curtain finally falls on the debate amidst a euphony of cheers...'''

;(Talk to Inayah, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog nllq003 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' During the debate, you said that you found a new wish. What was it?
:{{A|vo dialog nllq003 inayah 01.ogg}} '''Inayah:''' I actually... want to learn how to dance from Nilou.
:{{A|vo dialog nllq003 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's a great wish, but with your shyness, are you really going to be okay going up on stage?
:{{A|vo dialog nllq003 inayah 02.ogg}} '''Inayah:''' I&mdash;I'll try my best...
:{{A|vo dialog nllq003 inayah 03.ogg}} '''Inayah:''' Nilou wasn't born an expert, either!

;(Talk to Nilou)
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Oh, it's you.
:{{DIcon}} Feeling any calmer?
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Yes, I feel a lot better. The more I think back on everything, the more surreal it all feels.
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' I don't think I could repeat what I did a second time.
:{{DIcon}} All of our preparations paid off.
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Yes, and it's all thanks to you.
:{{DIcon}} Now that I've heard everyone else's stories...
:{{DIcon}} I want to hear yours.
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 05.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Hehe, I see. You mean how fate brought me to the theater, right?
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 06.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Then, I'll have to tell you about my teacher, who Mr. Zubayr had mentioned.
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 07.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Mr. Zubayr opened his theater when I was still a child.
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 08.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' There was a beautiful dancer, and from the moment I saw her, I couldn't look away.
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 09.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' I thought to myself, "The gods must have blessed her with such talent."
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 10.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' But later on, she would actually smile down at me and say, "Just the opposite, in fact."
:{{DIcon}} The opposite?
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 11.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Yeah. She said, "Dance is an art born from toil. It isn't a gift from the gods, but a creation by our own hands."
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 12.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' "It is a beautiful thing born from our life experiences. Whenever there is joy or something to be celebrated, people will dance."
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 13.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' "In other words, any place where people can effortlessly begin a dance will for sure be filled with the blessings of everyone's happiness."
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 14.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' She wasn't looking for flowers and applause &mdash; all she wanted was to see her audience smile.
:{{DIcon}} So that is...
:{{DIcon}} What art means to people.
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 15.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Right, the same as what Mr. Khasani believes.
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 16.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' I was completely moved by what she had said, so I started taking dance lessons from her. And later on, I began to dance here in her stead.
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 17.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Before she retired, she told me, "For as long as you live, never forget what dance means to others."
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 18.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' This is why Mr. Zubayr and I never intended to listen to the Akademiya.
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 19.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Even though it ended up causing everyone a whole lot of trouble, thankfully, everything worked out in the end.
:{{DIcon}} I see.
:{{DIcon}} Looks like you won't have to worry anymore.
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 20.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Mhm, although I do have a small regret.
:{{DIcon}} Inayah?
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 21.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Yeah. Even though she has already decided to stop fighting with her father, they never managed to have a real conversation with each other.
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 22.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Before he left, Mr. Sharif looked like he had a lot on his mind.
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 23.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' He probably has a lot of things he wants to say, but will now perhaps never get a chance to.
:{{DIcon}} That really is a shame.
:{{DIcon}} That might be for the best.
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 24.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Yeah, but I still hope that things can change. It never hurts to have hope.
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 25.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' You and Paimon are more than welcome to keep attending our shows.
:{{A|vo nllq003 4 nilou 26.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Hehe, who knows, next time, you might see Inayah on the stage.

;(After talking to Nilou)
:{{A|vo nllq003 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you still worried about Inayah?
:{{A|vo nllq003 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's be sure to come back often. Who knows, maybe things will have worked out for her!

;(Talk to Nilou again)
:{{A|vo dialog nllq003 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' You two are welcome here anytime! Seeing you safe and sound in between adventures will keep me from worrying too much about you.
:{{A|vo dialog nllq003 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' I think I already see you two as people of the Grand Bazaar. Yep, without a doubt.
{{Dialogue end}}
{{Quest Description|update|Sharif quit the debate, and the theater finally avoided the fate of being demolished. However, the seemingly perfect ending has left a little regret...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the theater)
:;(Nilou finishes a dance)
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Everyone, I'd like to introduce you to our newest member: Inayah!
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 inayah 01.ogg}} '''Inayah:''' H&mdash;Hello, everyone...
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' She'll be dancing for us from now on, so please give her your support.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Inayah's taken her place on the stage! Paimon wonders how she'll look once she starts dancing.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' When you stop and think about it, happy endings like this sure aren't easy to come by!
:{{DIcon}} A lot of things came together to make it happen.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nilou's efforts, everyone's wisdom, Inayah's determination...
:{{DIcon}} And Sharif's mercy.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What do you mean by that?
:{{DIcon}} I think he intentionally gave us a chance.
:{{DIcon}} He didn't have to agree to the debate.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You do have a point there...
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The whole demolition thing was going overboard, but he really could've banned Nilou and the others from dancing.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If he really wanted to be ruthless, he could've done some real damage, even without winning the debate.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh well, it's not like we can understand how people like him think. Let's focus on watching the performance!
:{{DIcon}} Agreed.
:{{DIcon}} Enough of him for now.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? Wait, look who the cat dragged in!
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Isn't that Inayah's father!?
:{{DIcon}} Let's go greet him.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 sharif 01.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' Oh, it's you two.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 sharif 02.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' I don't have much to do today, so I just came to look around this place.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmph, are you looking for Inayah?
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 sharif 03.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' No, I am simply here to watch a performance. There is no need to trouble her.
:{{DIcon}} Shouldn't you be busy?
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 sharif 04.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' Well, I was, for a time.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 sharif 05.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' My loss at the debate caused quite the loss of face for the Akademiya, so there was a period of unrest.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 sharif 06.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' I used this opportunity to suggest that my superiors temporarily suspend me from duty. Otherwise, the rumors would probably persist for even longer.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Suspended from duty...
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 sharif 07.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' Yes, I am temporarily unemployed. However, I now have an abundance of time, so I can afford to come here and watch a show.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 sharif 08.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' I admit that I do not understand the magic that this theater possesses, but my curiosity has been piqued.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 sharif 09.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' I still cannot forget that young lady's perseverance. Inayah would almost certainly mature in the presence of such a person.
:{{DIcon}} So you're still concerned about your daughter.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 sharif 10.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' There are no parents who do not worry about their children. I suppose she managed to hit a weak spot of mine.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 sharif 11.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' Never mind. I do not have the right to say that.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're already here, so you might as well go see her.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 sharif 12.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' No, that is not necessary. I will take my leave after the show concludes.
:;(Nilou, who is talking to Inayah on the stage, notices Sharif)
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 sharif 13.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' ...Do not tell her that I was here.
;(A cinematic plays)

::{{A|vo nllq003 cs nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' C'mon, who knows if you'll get a chance like this again!
:;(Nilou pushes Inayah towards the Traveler and Sharif)
::{{A|vo nllq003 cs inayah 01.ogg}} '''Inayah:''' But, but...
::{{A|vo nllq003 cs nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' You said you were going to make peace with your past. Show your father how much you've grown
::{{A|vo nllq003 cs nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Don't be nervous. Everyone at Zubayr Theater has your back!
::{{A|vo nllq003 cs nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Hey, let's go somewhere else. We should give them some space
::{{A|vo nllq003 cs paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You sure they'll be okay?
::{{A|vo nllq003 cs nilou 05.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' I dunno
::{{A|vo nllq003 cs nilou 06.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' But... I think we should have faith in them
:;(Nilou, the Traveler, and Paimon give them some space)
:;(After some awkwardness from both of them, Sharif starts to talk)
::{{A|vo nllq003 cs sharif 01.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' Ah, yes, Inayah...
::{{A|vo nllq003 cs sharif 02.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' I have something for you
:;(He pulls out an embroidery piece and offers it to Inayah)
::{{A|vo nllq003 cs sharif 03.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' I'm still learning. It's hardly a masterpiece...
::{{A|vo nllq003 cs sharif 04.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' But it's yours, if you'll take it
:;(Seeing Inayah's hesitation, he begins to take it back)
::{{A|vo nllq003 cs sharif 05.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' ...You don't have to take it
::{{A|vo nllq003 cs sharif 06.ogg}} '''Sharif:''' It's fine. Er... never mind
:;(Inayah reaches out and takes the embroidery piece from him, holds it to her chest, and turns around)
::{{A|vo nllq003 cs inayah 02.ogg}} '''Inayah:''' Let's have a heart-to-heart, Father
:;(Cinematic ends)
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Like father, like daughter. They're both so awkward with their feelings!
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Yeah, she probably would've snuck away as well if I didn't drag her back.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Do you think they'll be able to reconcile?
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' I'm not sure. A complete reconciliation may also not be the best thing for them right now.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 nilou 05.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' All those years of arguments and misunderstandings can't be settled overnight. It might be best if they continue to keep some distance for now.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 nilou 06.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' But no matter where their hearts and bodies may be, they will always be family.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 nilou 07.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' All I wish for them is to be able to one day tap into the warmth of that bond.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 nilou 08.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Oh, by the way, everyone's really thankful to you for helping out with the debate.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 nilou 09.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' So we made you a little something. Hope you'll like it!
::[[File:Item Miniature Zubayr Theater.png|150px]]
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' I&mdash;Isn't this Zubayr Theater?
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, this is amazing... It's so detailed and polished...
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 nilou 10.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Hee-hee, we've also never made anything this complicated before.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 nilou 11.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Mr. Zubayr and Mr. Khasani took charge of the design, while Inayah and I made all the little pieces with the help of others.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 nilou 12.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Ms. Rekhar and Miss Najia made and assembled the centerpiece.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 nilou 13.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' As adventurers, you two will doubtlessly travel to many more lands and see many more things.
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 nilou 14.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' That's why we hope that your time at Zubayr Theater will become a fond memory of your journey. You two are welcome back anytime!
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mhm, we'll come back and watch you dance whenever we get the chance!
:{{DIcon}} Thank you all for being so considerate.
:{{DIcon}} According to custom, I should drop the formalities and just accept it, right?
:{{A|vo nllq003 7 nilou 15.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' You're welcome, and there's no need to be so polite. You learned fast!
