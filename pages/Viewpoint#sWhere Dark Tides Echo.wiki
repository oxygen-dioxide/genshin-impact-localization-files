|text    = Where the [[Spina di Rosula]] was born. Just as a tiny chick that will one day become a soaring eagle is hatched from an egg, so are grand and radiant ambitions hatched in a dark and cramped place.<br>The people of [[Poisson]] are like the residents of the [[Fleuve Cendre]], and from the history of these places they understand that some things are worth being, and indeed must be, fought for and bought by blood.
