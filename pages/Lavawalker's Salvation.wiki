{{Description|The feather of a proud phoenix. You can almost hear the sound of its wings flapping in the scorching flames.}}
'''Lavawalker's Salvation''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Lavawalker]].

==Description==
A feather plucked by the Lavawalker from a bird that sings amid the flames.<br />The wearer can almost hear the sound of the bird's wings flapping in the blaze.

Legend has it that there exists a kind of solidarity bird that sings in the blazing flames.<br />People worshipped it as a totem while kings saw it as a sign of nobility.

Donning this feather, the Lavawalker retreated from the outside world.<br />Alone he came and alone he went, leaving no trace behind.<br />Since then, people often hear cries coming from the Mare Jivari.<br />No one knows if they are the song of the bird or the sighs of the Lavawalker.
