|text      = Yesterday. I slept really well so I could save up enough energy for today, and start today's one-day adventure full of vim and vigor!

You shouldn't think it strange! I am well aware that as an Outrider, I'm quite used to detecting risks and gauging potential danger. Even if I end up in a strange land, I won't just be completely and unconditionally excited... I'm pretty different from [[Klee]] in that respect. But after hearing her go on about her "big adventure" so much, I've decided to indulge my inner child. An entire day of carefree freedom sounds good to me!

So, I plan to travel from [[Springvale]] to [[Dawn Winery]] first, and then I'll decide whether to go to [[Stormterror's Lair]] or the [[Stone Gate]] from there based on how I'm feeling.

If I run into you on the road, I'll be happy to share some bread with you!
