{{Quote|Seek violence, and violence shall find you.|Iskandar|[[Bimarstan's Proverb Column]]}}
Little is known about Iskandar at the moment. [[Jazari]] quotes him while observing the [[Ruin Golem (Devantaka Mountain)|Ruin Golem]] at [[Devantaka Mountain]], claiming "Behold. Thousands of years of ancient [[Khaenri'ah]] history lie before us!"<ref name="VAJC" /> Based on this, it can be assumed that he studied Khaenri'ah's history at some point.
