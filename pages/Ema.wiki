==Profile==
Ema is the shade of a librarian responsible for collecting any outstanding books on the last day before the people of Byakuyokoku left for the surface.

===Personality===
Ema seems to be very stressed and anxious when the [[Traveler]] first meets her, and even claims to be the angriest, most anxious person in Enkanomiya. However, she lightens up after the Traveler retrieves the 5 outstanding books for her, and reveals her wish to set up a sushi/sashimi restaurant when she gets to the surface.

===Appearance===
Like most shades, she is a translucent humanoid figure without defining physical features.
