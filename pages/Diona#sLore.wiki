==Personality==
{{Quote|A young lady who has inherited trace amounts of non-human blood. She is the incredible popular bartender of the Cat's Tail tavern.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
According to her father Draff, Diona is in a bit of a rebellious phase. While Diona adores her father and idolized him in her youth, witnessing his change in personality while drunk shattered the pedestal she put him on &mdash; and started her vendetta against alcohol. She despises just about anyone who indulges in alcohol, apart from [[Lisa]]<ref>{{Ref/VO|Diona|About Lisa}}</ref> and [[Eula]].<ref>{{Ref/VO|Eula|About Diona}}</ref>

Although Diona has the option of literally destroying the industry,<ref>{{Ref/VO|Diona|About Klee}}</ref> she chose not to, instead opting to do so by plummeting the industry's reputation by becoming a bartender and serving terrible drinks. Unfortunately for her, her long-forgotten childhood friend, the [[Spring Fairy]], blessed her with a magic touch that makes all of her drinks delicious, regardless of how noxious the ingredients used are, and she herself is unaware of this.

In her interactions, Diona proves to be a classic {{w|tsundere}} and is very naïve. She worries over the Traveler's ability to get home safely without night vision and offers to escort them home until they remind her that street lamps exist, after which she quickly denies ever having offered escorting them. She blames [[Diluc]] for her father's problems, even though the Dawn Winery had existed well before him or [[Crepus|his father]],<ref>{{Ref/VO|Diona|About Diluc}}</ref> and fails to see why the fans she and [[Barbara]] gets are drastically different.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Diona|About Barbara}}</ref> She also appears to have attachment issues and craves companionship, implied to be a result of Draff neglecting her when he's in his drunken stupors. She genuinely enjoys the company of those who have earned her trust, such as Klee and the Traveler, finding comfort in the Traveler's touch even begs them not to leave her and "become another dream". Although she displays many cat-like mannerisms, such as her love for fish, naps, hatred of vegetables and water, and tendency to meow, purr, and bite when angry, she hates being referred to as a cat in this regard. Also true to her feline nature, she is implied to be astraphobic,<ref>{{Ref/VO|Diona|When Thunder Strikes}}</ref> as well as aquaphobic.

==Appearance==

{{Quote|I've been bitten by a cat!|Elzer, Dawn Winery's butler, shortly after complimenting}}

The incredibly popular bartender of the Cat's Tail tavern, rising star of Mondstadt's wine industry, and the greatest challenger to its traditional powerhouses...

Such is Diona's image in the eyes of her clientele.

Yet this feisty feline young lady from Springvale prefers to see herself as the "Wine Industry Slayer."

That ambition is reflected in her bartending philosophy: "I'm gonna ruin the taste of alcohol for everyone, for good!"

This subtle contradiction comes from a blessing &mdash; or, in Diona's mind, probably more of a curse &mdash; that has been placed upon her:

For any drink mixed by her hand is destined to taste delicious beyond belief.

Nevertheless, to this day, her deep distaste for alcohol prevents her from giving up her mission.

Devoted to concocting the most disgusting drink in the world that will single-handedly destroy Mondstadt's wine industry, Diona has been concentrating all of her efforts on this pursuit.

Over time, this gave rise to the small town known as Springvale.</p><p>Nowadays, few are left who believe that this is any more than a mere legend, and some even dismiss it as myth-making for tourism's sake.</p><p>Only little Diona believed in the existence of the spring fairy, and on nights when her father was in a deep stuporous sleep, she would speak to the moon reflected in the spring water's surface.</p><p>These were her earnest feelings, innocent and wonderful &mdash; feelings worth answering.</p><p>That was what the spring fairy believed.</p><p>So, Diona would make a curious friend, a companion whom she could bare her feelings to and sometimes assuage her loneliness.</p><p>On the night of Diona's seventh birthday, as the moonlight reflected off the spring and upon her face, she heard the soft voice of the spring fairy.</p><p>"I will bless you, daughter of hunters, for your days ahead, and as a farewell.

May it always be refreshing as springs of ever-melting snow."</p><p>From that day on, the spring fairy would never appear before Diona again, and she left those memories behind, consigning them to her childhood dreams.</p><p>Till today, she has yet to realize that her troublesome constitution has anything at all to do with that dream.</p>

===Etymology===
* Kätzlein, which is mentioned as being her bloodline, is German for "Kitten."
* Diona's name likely derives from a combination of the names {{w|Diana (mythology)|Diana}}, the Roman goddess of the hunt, who is commonly depicted as an archer, and the Greek god {{w|Dionysus}}, who is the god of wine-making.
** Alternatively, the name "Diona" can also derive from the name of a sea-nymph from Greek mythology named {{w|Dione (mythology)|Dione}}. This could be related to Diona having been blessed by the Spring Fairy when she was seven years old.
