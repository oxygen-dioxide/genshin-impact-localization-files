{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Isami:''' That mercenary... shouldn't be a bad person, right? This place is just full of plants, so there's nothing worth taking for him.
:{{DIcon}} Which mercenary?
::'''Isami:''' Oh, I was talking about [[Shahin|Mr. Shahin]] who guards the place.
::'''Isami:''' I've never seen such an inquisitive person in [[the Eremites]].
::'''Isami:''' I always though the Eremites were a group of reserved brutes, but I was gravely mistaken.
::'''Isami:''' I have nothing against friendly people, but he keeps asking about what's being done here and what's being stored there... It overwhelms me a little.
::'''Isami:''' It's mainly because he looks so curious, so he doesn't seem like he's scheming something, and I can't bother [[matra]] for just a few questions of his...
::'''Isami:''' So, I have to deal with him best I can.
:{{DIcon}} What's this place?
::'''Isami:''' This is Pardis Dhyai, a research site for {{Rubi|Amurta|Biology}}. You can meet researchers studying topics like plants, [[Shroom-Kin]], and even insects here.
::'''Isami:''' They're mostly researchers and students of the Akademiya, and some are close collaborators with Pardis Dhyai.
::'''Isami:''' For example, a [[Tighnari|Forest Watcher]] of [[Gandharva Ville]] used to spend all his time here while he was studying. Even if he has left the Akademiya now, he still comes here often to conduct research.
::'''Isami:''' His research findings are very precious, so Pardis Dhyai is willing to assist the Forest Rangers in their work too. Call it a mutually beneficial cooperation.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Isami:''' See you.
