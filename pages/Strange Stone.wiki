The '''Strange Stone''' is a quest item that is used in the [[Luhua Landscape]] quest.

There are two stones; one is given to the player by [[Vermeer]] after finishing the first step of the quest, while the other is found nearby on the ground during the second step of the quest. The stones are then placed into the head of the two nearby statues to open the gate to the treasure.
