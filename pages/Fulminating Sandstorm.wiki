;Wenutslayer Cannon
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Fulminating Sandstorm Wenutslayer Cannon 1.png
|text1  = The Deviant Wenut will sometimes enter a berserk state, in which they will keep their distance and launch long-range attacks. During this time, they cannot be damaged normally.
|image2 = Tutorial Fulminating Sandstorm Wenutslayer Cannon 2.png
|text2  = The Wenutslayer Cannon is the only weapon that can defeat the Deviant Wenut. Use the charging devices to power the Cannon up, and only then can it fire. However, charging devices will also attract nearby opponents...
|image3 = Tutorial Fulminating Sandstorm Wenutslayer Cannon 3.png
|text3  = Attacking certain opponents will result in the coalescing of elemental energies. Touching these coalescences will charge the Wenutslayer Cannon.<br>Rocks in the nearby area sometimes contain such energies, but they can only be destroyed by the Wenut's attacks. Baiting the Wenut into destroying these rocks seems to be the most effective method here.

;Berserk Wenut
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Fulminating Sandstorm Berserk Wenut 1.png
|text1  = Multiple Wenut in berserk states will appear one after the other, but the charging device, now at full operating capacity, also stands ready. Defeat as many of the Wenut using the Wenutslayer Cannon as possible!
