'''Achievements''' are in-game goals that will award the player with [[Primogem]]s once completed. Completing all of the Achievements within a category will award the player with a [[Namecard]] style that can be used on their in-game profile (some categories like ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' and ''[[Memories of the Heart]]'' continually get more achievements added and do not have a completable percentage rating nor completion reward).

The number of successive achievements is indicated by the number of stars in their icon, for example, if there are 3 star slots in the icon it indicates that the achievement has 3 successive tiers to achieve.

Completing all {{Achievement/Total}} achievements will reward a total of {{Achievement/Primogems/Total}} [[Primogem]]s.
