'''Kujou Takayuki''' {{Lang|ja=九条孝行}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in [[Chapter II]], Act III: [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]]. He is the head of the [[Tenryou Commission]] up until the end of the Inazuma Archon Quests; after his collusion with the [[Fatui]] for personal gain is exposed, he is removed as head of the clan, leading to internal conflict within the Tenryou Commission.

==Profile==
At the start of the Inazuma Archon Quests, Kujou Takayuki is the current head of the [[Kujou Clan]]. He has two biological children, [[Kujou Masahito]] and [[Kujou Kamaji]]. At some point prior to the [[Vision Hunt Decree]], some travelers found an unconscious [[tengu]] girl by the roadside with a glowing item. Takayuki was immediately notified of the situation and when he came to check in on the girl, he discovered that the glowing item she had was a [[Vision]]. He then decided to adopt her and gave her the name [[Kujou Sara|Sara]], who would become his adopted daughter.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Kujou Sara|Vision}}</ref>

A year before the events of the game, the Fatui conspired with Takayuki to have him forward the Vision Hunt Decree so they could sell their [[Delusion]]s and cause chaos in the nation in return for power. Wishing to preserve the influence of his clan and believing that the Fatui would be no match for the Shogun, Takayuki agreed, writing deceitful letters to the Shogun ensuring her that all was well and fine.

When Masahito reported the destructive influence of the [[Tatarigami]] unleashed on [[Yashiori Island]] during the ensuing war, Takayuki's response was "one of fury, rather than sympathy." Believing Masahito was making excuses for his own incompetence, Takayuki sent an investigation team to the island to uncover the "truth" &mdash; a veiled warning for Masahito to "pull himself together" lest he be demoted and replaced by his adoptive sister.<ref>{{Ref/HEO|Tatarigami Investigation Expedition}}</ref> According to one of the [[Lost Texts]] left by the investigation team, Takayuki also ordered them to kill any and all villagers they came across and pass it off as the [[Watatsumi Army]]'s doing.

The Fatui plot was unraveled with the [[Traveler]]'s aid during [[Chapter II]]. The Shogun was unhappy with the extent of the deception, and Takayuki "aged" overnight, losing his will, conviction and position, causing Kamaji to take his place as proxy clan head. Takayuki is currently under house arrest and awaiting punishment, having been denied bail.<ref>{{Ref/BB|Inazuma Commercial Street Bulletin Board|Tenryou Notice: Kujou Takayuki}}</ref>
