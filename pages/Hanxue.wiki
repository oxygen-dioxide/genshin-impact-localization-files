==Profile==
An archaeologist specializing in [[Liyue]] history, Hanxue has published books about his findings. During Shadow of Yore, he is found debating the origin of the [[Mora]] with [[Zhongli]], [[Wanyan]], and [[Yixuan]].

Hanxue teases the contents of his latest book, which comes to the conclusion that the world's first Mora &mdash; undoubtedly cast by [[Morax]] himself &mdash; was used to enhance a sword and dagger, and whoever came to possess those artifacts would gain sovereignty over Liyue. Zhongli, who unbeknownst to the rest of the group is Morax himself, quickly voices his disagreement, much to Hanxue's ire.
