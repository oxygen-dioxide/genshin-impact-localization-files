{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Faustier:''' Is it so hard to believe?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Faustier:''' What? It's me, Faustier!
::'''Faustier:''' Eh? Oh, sorry, I must've gotten the wrong person. Too many people ask me that, so I thought you must be an old acquaintance.
::{{DIcon}} Old friends don't recognize you?
::'''Faustier:''' Well, I had a short stint in the [[Fortress of Meropide]]. Petty theft and such...
::'''Faustier:''' And when I came out, no one could recognize me any longer - they said I'd changed too much.
::'''Faustier:''' Well, I certainly was a leaner sight in the past - it took quite some effort just to move chairs, even. But unrecognizable, really? I just bulked up a little, that's all.
::{{DIcon}} It's understandable.
::'''Faustier:''' Really? Did I change so much?
::'''Faustier:''' Well, I've got the [[Pankration Ring]] to thank for that, then.
::'''Faustier:''' When I first watched a boxing match, I couldn't help but wonder if I would ever stolen, had I simply been strong enough.
::'''Faustier:''' After serving my sentence, I was invited to join the Spina, and I began to do some legitimate manual labor... I guess I'm finally on the right path, no?
:{{DIcon}} See you.
:'''Faustier:''' See you.
