==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Jiuguan:''' There are many intricacies to drinking tea... Clear your mind, take a sip of tea, and sense the whispers within your drink. That is the attitude all tea lovers should have...
:{{DIcon}} How incredibly sophisticated...
::'''Jiuguan:''' It's just a habit. Tea-tasting habits differ among tea lovers from place to place.
::'''Jiuguan:''' Fontainians prefer sipping tea while watching a play or film, and some even add milk and spices.
::'''Jiuguan:''' Most of them treat tea as a common beverage, no different from coffee or alcohol.
::'''Jiuguan:''' But in my opinion, tea tasting for the residents of Chenyu Vale revolves around the concept of peace and exploration...
::'''Jiuguan:''' Yes, peacefully exploring the tea's original flavor.
::'''Jiuguan:''' Tea tasting seems closer to a ritual people practice after a busy day to relieve themselves of the bustle and clear their minds...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Is it really that serious...?
:::'''Jiuguan:''' Hmm, perhaps my words were too formal, and caused you confusion.
:::'''Jiuguan:''' Tasting tea is itself a relaxing experience. No need for baths and changing clothes and burning incense and all that performative posing and etiquette. Just sit back and enjoy!
:::'''Jiuguan:''' I hope that you too will discover inner peace while sipping tea.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Chenyu Adeptea|20|x=5}})
:{{DIcon}} What other insights and wisdom can you share? Please, enlighten me...
::'''Jiuguan:''' We merely met by chance and had a short conversation, so such politeness isn't necessary.
::'''Jiuguan:''' Tea tasting comes later, and tea preparation comes first. If we do plan to go into it, then we must discuss tea preparation first. And the specifics of it depend on the type of tea.
::'''Jiuguan:''' For example, Yunlai White Tea is shaped like a silver needle and should not be brewed with boiling water. The water must be allowed to cool until it's at 70% of its boiling temperature.
::'''Jiuguan:''' First, wet the tea with some hot water, then pour an appropriate amount of water into the pot. Wait patiently for ten minutes until the tea turns a light amber hue. Only then should you take a sip.
::'''Jiuguan:''' The brewing steps are reversed for Bishui Green Tea. It requires pouring the water first, then the tea leaves...
::'''Jiuguan:''' And Single-Origin Yauwan Tea, one of the teas Chenyu Vale is famous for, requires brewing at high temperatures. Boiling water must be used after letting it stand for a short moment...
::'''Jiuguan:''' Besides that, Single-Origin Yauwan Tea should be paired with small teapots and teacups, and every pot must not be filled with too much water...
::'''Jiuguan:''' I fear that the details cannot be captured with so few words.
::'''Jiuguan:''' Fortunately for you, I heeded Mr. Fryslan's advice and made the artisans of my teahouse co-write a book on tea preparation and tasting.
::'''Jiuguan:''' If you would like to delve deeper into the various teas and their intricacies, you can consider waiting until the book is finished. I'm certain a careful read of it will enlighten you.
:{{DIcon}} I will be back to hear a detailed explanation from you...
::'''Jiuguan:''' Well then, until we meet again.
