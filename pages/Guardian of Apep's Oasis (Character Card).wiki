==Story==
{{Description|[[Apep]] found itself swallowed alone amidst the scenery of the catastrophe. All the people, gods, dragons, beasts, birds, and fish. All memories, wisdom, words, and hatred were ground into colorless dust, and the last of the moonlight burned away into a rain of pale fire, falling on the barren land.<br>...<br>Apep once deemed the bottom of the sea of sand to be its grave, not the palace of a dispossessed king. The poison of "wisdom" would soon free Apep from the hatred and anger festering within it over countless moons. Apep had grown weary of the colorless apocalypse. Then, finally, the young god and the golden Traveler let it recall once again, even though the verdant land it once ruled had been reduced to this gilded wasteland, even though Apep and its many offspring had grown twisted and wretched to secure their continued survival therein, Apep still treasured the sight and scenes of the oasis sparkling in its heart.|title=Wisdom's End: Guardian of Apep's Oasis}}
