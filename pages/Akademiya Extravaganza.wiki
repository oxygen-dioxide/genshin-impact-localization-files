The '''Akademiya Extravaganza''' is a festival in [[Sumeru]] run by the Akademiya. It consists of the Wisdom Gala and the Interdarshan Championship.

==Wisdom Gala==
Wisdom Gala is held annually. During this time, all six [[Darshans]] will set up booths throughout [[Sumeru City]] for showcase purposes to attract potential students. These booths often include minigames and other activities.

Deciding what to showcase is a point of contention for some Darshans, as they can encounter difficulties figuring out appropriate yet appealing activities.

==Interdarshan Championship==
The Interdarshan Championship is held once every four years. Each Darshan selects one representative to participate, and the participants compete to become champion of the entire competition and thus earn rewards. In the twenty years preceding and including A Parade of Providence, one of the greatest rewards was the right to wear the [[Diadem of Knowledge]], a valuable treasure widely regarded as a work of art.

===Participants===
Participants must belong to a Darshan. Both current students and alumni are eligible. Participants can self-nominate or be nominated by over half of their Darshan; those who are nominated can decline participation. Sages cannot participate, and participants may only participate in one Championship.<ref name="opening festivities">{{Ref/Quest|Opening Festivities}}</ref> It is unknown if those who were expelled, were otherwise removed, or dropped out before graduation are eligible to become participants. It is also unknown who selects the participants.

Known participants include:
* [[Kaveh's father]] (Rtawahist, 20 years ago) &mdash; finished second
* [[Huvishka]]'s friend (Darshan unknown, 20 years ago)
* [[Tighnari]] (Amurta, during A Parade of Providence)
* [[Faruzan]] (Haravatat, during A Parade of Providence)
* [[Kaveh]] (Kshahrewar, during A Parade of Providence) &mdash; champion

==History==
Not much is currently known about the history of the Wisdom Gala or that of the Akademiya Extravaganza prior to twenty years ago.

According to Huvishka, the [[Spantamad]] Darshan has had the highest percentage of winners in the championships history. He also claims that the most thrilling competition occurred 20 years ago.

Events in which participants fought to the death were included in the Interdarshan Championship up until the one held twenty years before the events of [[A Parade of Providence]].

===20 Years before A Parade of Providence===
Shortly before an Akademiya Extravaganza was to be held, [[Sachin]] donated or entrusted all of his assets to Sumeru Akademiya. Included among his donations was the [[Diadem of Knowledge]], a valuable treasure that Sachin declared would only be worn by the winner of an Interdarshan Championship. To celebrate, the Akademiya Extravaganza hosted after Sachin's donation was a larger celebration than usual.<ref name="suspicions aroused">{{Ref/Quest|Suspicions Aroused}}</ref><ref name="when the curtains close">{{Ref/Quest|When the Curtains Close}}</ref>

The Extravaganza that year included the Interdarshan Championship, and [[Kaveh's father]] and [[Huvishka]]'s friend participated in it.

Kaveh's father became a favorite to win the Interdarshan Championship, but he did not win.<ref name="kaveh story 2">{{Ref/CS|Kaveh|2}}</ref> It is implied that in the final round, he encountered the fragment of [[Sachin]]'s consciousness stored in the Diadem of Knowledge and was negatively affected enough that Arakasyapa, who still remembered Kaveh's father and happened to be nearby, took the Diadem of Knowledge and hid it in a tree hollow,<ref name="when the curtains close" /><ref name="that incident from twenty years ago">{{Ref/Quest|"That Incident From Twenty Years Ago"}}</ref><ref name="the contestant">{{Ref/Quest|The Contestant}}</ref><ref name="to claim the crown">{{Ref/Quest|To Claim the Crown}}</ref><ref name="the arc of intellect">{{Ref/Quest|The Arc of Intellect}}</ref><ref group="Note">''[["That Incident From Twenty Years Ago"]]'' indicates that after the final round, Arakasyapa hid the Diadem of Knowledge in a tree hole in order to protect the human who taught it how to read. ''[[The Contestant]]'' suggests that the human was the same human who helped Aaru Village and died in quicksand. ''[[When the Curtains Close]]'' shows that the human spoken of in ''The Contestant'' is Kaveh's father, as deduced by both the Traveler and Alhaitham.<br><br>According to [[Wiqas]] in ''[[Sachin's Article]]'', the Diadem of Knowledge "carries a secret that no one knows"; the secret is likely related to the mental experience Kaveh had with Sachin's words and emotions due to the Diadem of Knowledge, as shown in ''[[To Claim the Crown]]'', explained by Kaveh himself in ''[[The Arc of Intellect]]'', and further supported by Kaveh's declaration in ''When the Curtains Close'' that with the diadem shattered, Sachin's words will never hurt anyone again. This makes it likely that Kaveh's father had the same experience as Kaveh.</ref> where it would later be found by the employee who was in charge of the Diadem of Knowledge.<ref name="sachin article" /> However, the damage had already been done, and Kaveh's father fell into depression.<ref name="the contestant" />

Exactly what happened during the final round, held in Avidya Forest, is unknown, partly because "no one dared to approach" the participants. The Akademiya eventually shut down the competition and later removed many of the events that caused participants to fight to the death, implying that whatever happened in the final round had been tragic or nearly so.<ref name="sachin article">{{Ref/Quest|Sachin's Article}}</ref> It is unknown if there was any winner to that Interdarshan Championship.

===A Parade of Providence===
{{Main|A Parade of Providence/Story}}
As a result of the change to Sumeru's leadership following the events of {{Quest|Chapter III}}, the Akademiya Extravaganza held during A Parade of Providence was of great importance to Sumeru Akademiya. Due to the long oppression suffered by desert-dwellers prior to the change in Sumeru's leadership, Lesser Lord Kusanali and the sages decided to specifically invite many of them, such as [[Candace]] and [[Dehya]] to the Extravaganza in hopes of having them enjoy the Akademiya's atmosphere. They also recruited [[Nilou]], the [[Traveler]], and [[Paimon]], none of whom are from the Akademiya, as guest commentators in hopes of having the Interdarshan Championship appeal to more people.<ref name="opening festivities" />

The Extravaganza included the Interdarshan Championship, and its participants were [[Tighnari]], [[Faruzan]], [[Kaveh]], [[Layla]], [[Cyno]], and the [[Wanderer]]. [[Alhaitham]], Nilou, the Traveler, and Paimon were guest commentators. The rewards included money, research funding, a limited-edition [[Genius Invokation TCG]] card, and the right to wear the Diadem of Knowledge as usual.<ref name="opening festivities" />

There were three rounds as follows:
# Find Swiftflies among the many butterflies that were intentionally released in [[Sumeru City]]. Swiftflies look different from and are faster than ordinary butterflies.
# Find Ley Line Disruptors, devices that mimic the effects of Ley Line disruptions, buried around [[Aaru Village]].
# Find the Diadem of Knowledge and place it on a stand in [[Mawtiyima Forest]].

During the Championship, Sachin's son, [[Jiwani]], hired [[Eremites]] to kidnap his father, who he had grown to resent, as Jiwani thought his father was still alive. This plan was foiled by Wanderer and Alhaitham.<ref name="to claim the crown" />

The fragment of Sachin's consciousness in the Diadem of Knowledge finally saw a worthy successor in Kaveh and appeared at the end of the final round, after Kaveh won. However, Sachin's words upset Kaveh, who threw the Diadem of Knowledge to the ground, breaking it into pieces to ensure that no one else would ever have to hear Sachin or suffer from an experience with the Diadem of Knowledge again.<ref name="when the curtains close" /> As the recipient of Sachin's wealth, Kaveh also decided to donate all of it to help others. With the Diadem of Knowledge broken, the image of Sachin dissipated with a smile on his face. During the reward ceremony, Kaveh rejects all of the other rewards, except the [[Genius Invokation TCG]] card, which he gives to [[Cyno]], who then decides to buy it from him for 1 million Mora. [[Nahida]] later arrives to seal away Sachin's research, honoring Kaveh's wish for it not be disseminated, though she says that if someone else wants to take on Sachin's research in the future, she will not stop them because it is one step toward discovering the truth of the world.<ref name="to claim the crown" />
