'''Mask of Solitude Basalt''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Archaic Petra]].

==Description==
It is said that during the years when gods contended against one another, Rex Lapis' aspect was that of boundless slaughter.<br />In those god-eat-god battles, one could never have ascribed gentleness to him.

He knew right from wrong, and never missed his mark: in those days of tumult, he would show no mercy, even to friends-turned-foes.<br />Rex Lapis' stone-cold expression never once changed throughout that storied age.

They say that only when the dust settled did he lay down that unmovable visage.<br />But it had been necessary, for he had donned it to fulfill a contract.
