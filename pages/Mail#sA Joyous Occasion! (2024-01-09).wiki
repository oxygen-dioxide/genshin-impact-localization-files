Though we'll have plenty of time to talk after you come, I still can't wait to tell you about this really fun thing that happened.

Not long ago, a shop in [[Ritou]] imported a bunch of goods from [[Mondstadt]], and you could tell at a glance just how fresh they were! I seized the chance to buy a bunch and immediately started pickling some.
I had originally planned to use the clear and sweet flavor of the Calla Lilies to give it a unique twist, and give  [[Kamisato Ayato|my lord]] and  [[Kamisato Ayaka|milady]] a chance to try something new. But the final product was a completely wondrous surprise. Even the texture was totally transformed. At once crispy and tasty, but also oh-so-savory as you chew. Madam [[Furuta]] even asked me for the recipe!

Being able to share this amazing discovery with everyone is all I could ask for. As a matter of fact, I've made a whole smorgasbord of delicious dishes, be sure not to miss it!
