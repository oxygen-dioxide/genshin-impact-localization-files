;(Talk to Baizhu)
:{{A|vo card baizhu invite easy 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' As you wish. I am hardly an expert at this game, however, so please forgive me if my perfomance fails to live up to your expectations.

:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to do right now...

;(When the player defeats one of Baizhu's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card baizhu ingame easy 02.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' A little rash, don't you think?

;(When the player defeats two of Baizhu's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card baizhu ingame easy 03.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' This is turning into quite a predicament.

;(When Baizhu defeats one of the player's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card baizhu ingame easy 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Just the ingredient I needed.

;(When Baizhu uses an Elemental Burst)
:{{A|vo card baizhu ingame easy 04.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' I have just the remedy.

;(If the player wins the match)
:{{A|vo card baizhu invite easy 03.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' *cough* ...I am defeated. That went much as I expected...

;(If the player loses the match)
:{{A|vo card baizhu invite easy 02.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' That partly came down to luck... But I daresay I won't be needing your forgiveness today.

===Serious Showdown===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Baizhu)
:{{A|vo card baizhu invite hard 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Happy to oblige, but remember &mdash; everything in moderation, even card games. You might think of them as a fun way to relax, but they actually require substantial mental energy, so be sure to get adequate rest.

:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to do right now...

;(When the player defeats one of Baizhu's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card baizhu ingame hard 02.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Nothing to be troubled about.

;(When the player defeats two of Baizhu's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card baizhu ingame hard 03.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' This leaves a bad taste in the mouth...

;(When Baizhu defeats one of the player's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card baizhu ingame hard 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Sorry &mdash; doctor's orders.

;(When Baizhu uses an Elemental Burst)
:{{A|vo card baizhu ingame hard 04.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Ah, a road to recovery.

;(If the player wins the match)
:{{A|vo card baizhu invite hard 03.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' You beat me. *sigh*... I must say, I'm feeling a little faint after all that. A cup of strong tea should rejuvenate me, shall I make one for you, too?

;(If the player loses the match)
:{{A|vo card baizhu invite hard 02.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Ah... Well, that was a stroke of good fortune... Though I couldn't help but notice you were visibly anxious during the game, which seemed to be affecting your concentration. It could simply be sleep deprivation, but are you experiencing any other symptoms?

===Guest Challenge===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Baizhu)
:{{A|vo card baizhu freetalk 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' This crowded tavern is getting terribly stuffy... They should really open a window to let some fresh air in.

:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to do right now...
::{{A|vo card baizhu leave 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Goodbye. I'll be leaving myself shortly... I left some herbs out to dry &mdash; I do hope Gui remembered to take them in...

;(If the player loses the match)
:{{A|vo card baizhu endofgame win 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' It's just a game, so don't take it to heart. Take it from me &mdash; I'm a doctor. Excessive rumination on negative thoughts is known to cause many adverse health effects.

;(If the player wins the match)
:{{A|vo card baizhu endofgame fail 01.ogg}} '''Baizhu:''' Card games do not appear to be my forte... Perhaps in the future, I should stick to medicine.
