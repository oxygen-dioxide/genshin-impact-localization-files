'''Tepal''' is a mentioned NPC in the {{Quest|Of Fading Flowers and Falling Feathers}}.

==Profile==
Tepal is the son of [[Allpa]] and an unknown father, when the former was a Wingless that decided to travel across Natlan. Tepal's birth delighted Allpa and she wanted to prove that she was a free-faring mother, but her husband decided otherwise and wanted to give him a sheltered life. This resulted in them parting ways, with Tepal being taken by his father to be raised in the [[Children of Echoes]] alongside a foster mother, [[Puma]]. Like his biological mother, Tepal longed for the skies and hated his father and step-mother for denying him his wishes. When he learned that Allpa was his biological mother, Tepal made his way to the [[Flower-Feather Clan]] and introduced himself to her again. Allpa was delighted that he shared her aspirations and tried to enroll him into the Qucusaur Riders, but like Allpa, Tepal failed and was deemed a Wingless.

Tepal returned to the Children of Echoes; though he was disappointed much like his mother, he still believed in his dream to eventually soar the skies one day and began to experiment with creating the Phlogiston Wings, a device that could allow anyone to fly. His initial attempts to artificially refine the phlogiston failed, with [[Xilonen]] claiming that he barely got out alive from each incident. This ostracized him even further, resulting in him desiring to create a flying workshop of his own to work without being disturbed by others. Through unknown means, he managed to acquire a relic from [[Ochkanatlan]], which allowed him to create his workshop. Eventually, both Puma and his father tried to talk sense into him, but he dismissed their concerns, believing that they wanted to squash his dreams. Sometime afterwards, Tepal's father became gravely ill, and Puma wrote a letter to the Flower-Feather Clan asking him to at least visit his dying father. Tepal did not do so, resulting in Puma believing that he never cared for them at all.

In reality, Tepal's experiments with refining phlogiston had resulted in his death before he could receive Puma's letter, something which Allpa would discover. Believing that the qucusaurs played a role in Tepal's death, Allpa viewed them as savage beasts that only cared for themselves and decided to forcefully extract phlogiston from qucusaurus glands to fuel the Phlogiston Wings. This drastic approach was successful, allowing Allpa to fulfill her son's dreams of unskilled flying. She began to plot a coup to overthrow the current chief, [[Mutota]], and assumed her son's identity by wearing a mask, gathering other like-minded individuals to her cause. Under her assumed guise of Tepal, Allpa would hire people to catch as many qucusaurs as they could to mass-produce Phlogiston Wings.

The coup would eventually fall apart after [[Isidore]] and his group (who were hired by Allpa) abducted a Qucusaurus chick named [[Chime]], who was the daughter of [[Coya]] and part of [[Chasca]]'s Qucusaur family. After defeating Allpa and crushing the coup, Mutota and the other tribesmen would head to Tepal's workshop and disassemble it, only leaving a small and safe section behind as a repurposed jail for Allpa and her lackeys.
