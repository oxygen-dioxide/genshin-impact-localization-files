==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Try your luck at the Saurian Relics Excavation Site!}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Quipia)
:'''Quipia:''' Three hundred [[Mora]] entry fee...
:{{DIcon}} Can I get a discount?
:{{DIcon}} It's free if I beat you, right?
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, that's not how we normally do things!
:'''Quipia:''' The price is set by the [[Saurian Relics Association (Faction)|Saurian Relics Association]], and cannot be negotiated. As far as I know, this is already the cheapest excavation site, as it's been open the longest.
:'''Quipia:''' But nowadays, we sometimes get dreamers like you who want to try their luck.
:'''Quipia:''' After all, you never know! Maybe none of the hundreds and thousands of people who came before you had a good eye for treasure, and missed a priceless relic that only looks ordinary.
:'''Quipia:''' Many would pay 300 Mora for such a beautiful dream.
:'''Quipia:''' So, how lucky are you feeling? Do you believe you'll be the one to strike it rich?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrrooo... Rawr! Rawr! Raaawr!
:{{DIcon}} My luck's never let me down.
:{{DIcon}} I don't need that, I've got a lucky Saurian.
:'''Paimon:''' Feel like putting your luck to the test, {{Little One}}?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' He definitely looks up for it. And what's 300 Mora anyway? Paimon can handle that!
:'''Paimon:''' Being able to buy three rays of hope for that sum is kind of a steal, really!
:'''Quipia:''' Then I wish you all the best of luck.

;(Talk to Quipia again, optional)
:'''Quipia:''' What is it? There's no time limit, so take your time.

;(Investigate what {{Little One}} digs up in the cage)
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, we haven't found anything, at all...

;(Investigate what {{Little One}} digs up near the bombs)
:'''Paimon:''' There's nothing here. Guess the area near the surface is basically no different from the world above...

;(Wait until {{Little One}} digs up the switch)
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Looks like a gadget used by some kind of mechanism...

;(After the [[Monetoo]] returns to its painting)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Sounds like something activating... Eek, watch out behind you!

;(After defeating the enemy)
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' This little ball... It looks kinda like a component or something. You like it?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrrah... Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Though we didn't dig it up, since we did find it here... It might be something really valuable!
:'''Paimon:''' Let's ask when we leave!

;(Leave the ruins)
:'''Quipia:''' How did it go?
:'''Paimon:''' {{Little One}} found this...
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Quipia:''' Let me have a look... Not the most uncommon item, but still, a rare find. It is very well-preserved, with clearly-visible [[phlogiston]] flow patterns.
:'''Quipia:''' Yes... Would you be willing to part with it if I gave you 10,000 Mora?
:'''Paimon:''' Wha&mdash;!? Did we really find a priceless Saurian relic!?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon just knew that {{Little One}} was awesome, and would bring us good luck!
:'''Quipia:''' No, this isn't nearly as precious as you seem to think. Were you to take it to Association headquarters for appraisal, it'd clock in at around 5,000 Mora at most.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's not falling for that trick! If it's only worth 5,000, why are you willing to pay 10,000 for it?
:'''Quipia:''' That's because of the unique patterns on it. I'm quite taken with them. Though it may not be that valuable in the eyes of others, I'm willing to pay a bit extra for it.
:'''Quipia:''' You may call me eccentric, but you could also say it's just the nature of a collector.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... When you put it like that, Paimon gets you. And 10,000 is quite a lot compared to the entrance fee.
:'''Paimon:''' So, shall we trade it in for 10,000?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Wrroh... Rrrooo...
:'''Paimon:''' You don't seem too happy about that, {{Little One}}... Do you wanna keep it for yourself?
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rrrah... Rawr!
:{{DIcon}} Well, you were the one who found it.
:{{DIcon}} Guess you wanna be a collector too, huh?
:'''Paimon:''' Since {{Little One}} doesn't want to sell, then we'll just have to keep it.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Quipia:''' Looks like you value {{Little One}} far more than Mora.
:'''Paimon:''' Naturally! He's our companion, after all. But if we find something similar in the future...
:'''Quipia:''' Thank you, but a collector's passion is as fickle as the tides. It rises as suddenly as it might retreat. Perhaps I'll find myself obsessing over something else in the future, though I can't yet say what my new interest will be.
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Rawr rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' Are you agreeing with her, {{Little One}}? Ohhh, Paimon gets it! This must be the mutual respect and understanding shared by collectors!
:'''Quipia:''' It is my honor to have been acknowledged by such a brilliant young [[Tepetlisaurus]]. Still, even if we can't do business, that doesn't mean we can't be friends! Feel free to come find me if you ever want to talk about collecting.
:'''Quipia:''' I won't keep you any longer, then. Good luck!
