{{Description|[[Amber]] found a mysterious [[Collei|young girl]] "touched by the deev" looking for something in [[Mondstadt City|Mond]]. What would the flying champ of the city discover?}}
'''Lost and Found''' is Chapter 3 of the ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' [[manga]].

==Summary==
[[Amber]] approaches the [[Collei|girl]] and introduces herself, but she pushes her away in anger. The girl simply informs Amber that she's looking for something, which the latter offers to help with. She takes the girl to the top of [[Favonius Cathedral]] for their search. When Amber asks her what she's trying to find, the girl remembers her past.

As a child, she was born [[Eleazar|sickly]] and her parents brought her to a [[Barnabas|seer]] for help. Instead of saving her, he brought the girl to [[The Doctor|Dottore]] to use as test subject for their Archon Residue experiments.

After returning to the ground, [[Jean]] and [[Lisa]] approach Amber, asking her about her investigation into the black fire incident.
