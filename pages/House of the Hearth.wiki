The '''House of the Hearth''' is an orphanage in [[Snezhnaya]] run by "The Knave" [[Arlecchino]] of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]]. Several notable members of the [[Fatui]] were raised into the organization after growing up in the House of the Hearth.

{{Quote|My dear Snezheviches, my dear Snezhevnas, my brothers and sisters<br />
If I were to one day cease my journey and slumber under the white birch, please carry on without me...|The end of [[Trofin Snezhevich]]'s [[Tattered Paper (Alphonso)|Tattered Paper]], containing the motto of the House of the Hearth}}
Orphans raised in the House of the Hearth are gathered from all over the continent, likely to make it easier for people who are ethnically from a certain nation to blend in with its people,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Shuumatsuban Operations|quote='''Buzuleac:''' We were all brought up in similar circumstances, but it's just easier for people with Inazuman blood like her to create a fake identity, you know?}}</ref> and many of those who clearly belong to a certain ethnicity (such as [[Lyudochka Snezhevna]], who was of [[Inazuma]]n descent) study affairs relating to their native land from a young age.<ref name="TRS">{{Ref/Quest|The Replacement's Secret}}</ref>

Once children raised in the House of the Hearth grow up, those who are deemed to "have potential" are enlisted in the [[Fatui]] and are dispatched as sleeper agents to other nations to await orders.<ref>{{Ref/HEO|The Bad Guy in Vimara Village}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Foolish Fatuus|quote='''Oleg:''' Hmph, Trofin Snezhevich... That guy didn't achieve anything here in the past few years, whereas I have already gotten results. Well, won't we see what he has to say for himself then?}}</ref> The fates of children without "potential" has not been addressed.

Those raised in the House of the Hearth view each other as "family" and refer to their bonds as being "tighter than blood."

The Fatui refer to those from the House of the Hearth with the surname "Snezhevich" for the males, and "Snezhevna" for the females.<ref name="TRS" />

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* "Snezhevich" and "Snezhevna" mean "Son of Snow" and "Daughter of Snow," respectively. While these two names are officially explained as surnames,<ref name="TRS" /> in real-life Russian, the ''-evich'' and ''-evna'' endings make them {{w|Patronymic#Russian|patronymics}}, which are secondary names that are based on the father's given name. Because the orphans have unknown parentage, the {{lang|"Snow"|ru=Снег|ru_rm=Sneg}} is considered their "father," while the [[Tsaritsa]] is the "mother."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Company Vanishing Into the Deep|quote='''Anton:''' Katarina and her younger brother, Corporal Nikolay, were brought up in the House of the Hearth. They are the children of Her Majesty the Tsaritsa.}}</ref>
