===Local Legend===
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = Torches
|desc_1      = Three torches are lit around the arena. When near a torch, the player will receive {{Pyro}} application, and their [[Charged Attack]] deals an additional instance of {{Color|Pyro DMG}} equal to '''200%''' of the character's [[ATK]] and applies '''1U''' of {{Pyro}}. This additional DMG scales with the player's [[DMG Bonus]]es and can [[CRIT]]. The braziers will be extinguished during '''Obsidian Storm.'''

|name_2      = Updraft
|desc_2      = Becomes airborne. The Iktomisaurus can still attack while airborne.
|file_2      = Iktomisaurus Updraft 2

|name_3      = Frosty Wind
|desc_3      = Sends forward two projectiles, each dealing '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}.
|file_3      = Iktomisaurus Frosty Wind 2

|name_4      = Chilling Blast
|desc_4      = Marks multiple circular areas around the player's location and deals '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} in each area after a short delay.
|file_4      = Iktomisaurus Chilling Blast 2

|name_5      = Obsidian Storm
|desc_5      = Teleports to the middle of the arena before creating an updraft to become airborne, gaining a {{Frozen}} shield and freezing all torches in ice. Tornadoes will spawn around the arena, dealing '''20% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} on hit. If the shield is not broken in time, produces a massive windstorm around the arena that continuously deals '''40% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} every '''0.5s'''. At the end of the windstorm, produces a massive blast, dealing '''300% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} across the arena. Destroying the shield will interrupt the attack and stun the Iktomisaurus, causing it to take '''15% Max HP''' as {{Color|True Physical DMG}}. The ice will melt and torches reignite upon the attack being canceled or is completed in full, whichever comes first.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|Able to use their plumage for leaping, Iktomisaurs are also the only type of Saurian to have grasped how to enter the "Spiritspeaker" state.<br>According to legend, their ancestors did not have a physical form, and instead could drift like spirits between reality and the spiritual realm, manifesting themselves through the darkness of night. Some also say that the first Iktomisaur to emerge from the Night Kingdom was not actually a true Saurian, but rather a unique race distinct from ordinary Saurians.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* Some Iktomisaurs in the wild appear to be meditating. These Iktomisaurs will not react to the player unless the player attacks it first.
* The name Iktomisaurus combines the name of "''Iktomi''", a Trickster God of the Lakota People, and "''saurus''" the Greek word for ''lizard''. Combined together, the name translates to "Iktomi's Lizard".
