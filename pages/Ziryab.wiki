;(Daytime)
: {{DIcon|Idle}} The phrasing here...
:: {{A|VO Ziryab 01.ogg}} "What is the best way to handle the phrasing here?"

==Thoughts==
{{All Schemes to Know Explanation|name=Ziryab}}
===Daytime===
:{{A|VO Ziryab All Schemes to Know 01.ogg}} '''Ziryab:''' (If you wanna touch someone's heart, you have to find just the right words!)

===Nighttime===
:{{A|VO Ziryab All Schemes to Know 02.ogg}} '''Ziryab:''' (Is my poetry not good enough? Let me try to explain...)

==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ziryab:''' "Fresh breeze in the night" or "Fresh night breeze"? How about just "Night breeze"?
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Ziryab:''' I'm pulling my hair out on how to win her heart.
::'''Ziryab:''' "Fresh breeze in the night" has too much emphasis on time, when I think about her day and night.
::'''Ziryab:''' On the other hand, "Fresh night breeze" sounds rather cliche, like a line in a child's fairytale.
::'''Ziryab:''' But just "Night breeze" would save more room for more serenade.
::'''Ziryab:''' But the people in the square discussing the candidates for the next [[Grand Conservator]] are messing up my thoughts. If only I could have a quieter place to think.
::{{DIcon}} How about indoors?
:::'''Ziryab:''' Tried it, didn't work.
:::'''Ziryab:''' You got either couples flirting, or someone pushing fliers on choir, card games, cross country, and other events on you in the study.
:::'''Ziryab:''' I could have just stayed in the dorm room, but my dumb roommate tried to make hotpot with a prototype burner...
:::'''Ziryab:''' I won't go into details, except the room is still full of smoke.
:::'''Ziryab:''' I don't trust myself to write anything [[Hana]] will appreciate in that condition.
::{{DIcon}} The next Grand Conservator?
:::'''Ziryab:''' Yes, the current Grand Conservator announced a few days ago that he was going to retire, and the next Grand Conservator needs to be voted in by the sages.
:::'''Ziryab:''' Practically everyone is talking about this. Didn't you hear them chattering about it?
:::'''Ziryab:''' Something about [[Vikram]] of the Vahumana being good with people, and [[Rifaet]] of the Haravatat being incredibly intellectual. Stuff like that...
:::'''Ziryab:''' I think there're even fan clubs of some sorts that've been set up by some students. From what I see, there's too little schoolwork.
:::'''Ziryab:''' Hana's better. She doesn't care about these mundane things.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry to disturb...
::'''Ziryab:''' "Night breeze"... "Be my words"...
{{Dialogue end}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Ziryab:''' Ahem... "Melodious night breeze, be my words, express the daylight delights"...
:'''Hana:''' ?
:'''Ziryab:''' "Here I stand in the wind, just to hear your gentle sing-along."
:'''Ziryab:''' What do you think of that?
:'''Hana:''' What do I think of what?
:'''Ziryab:''' The lovely poem I just composed. How does it make you feel?
:'''Hana:''' Is this... for your literature class?
:'''Hana:''' I'm sorry, I don't quite get it...
:'''Ziryab:''' That's okay, just listen closely...
