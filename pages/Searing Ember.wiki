==Gameplay Notes==
* When Diluc takes damage while having a shield, the effects of this constellation will still activate.
* This constellation can be triggered by damageless hits from teammates, such as [[Dori]]'s [[Alcazarzaray's Exactitude|Electro application]], [[Kujou Sara]]'s [[Tengu Stormcall|buff application]], and Aura Checks from [[Anemo]] characters capable of [[Elemental Absorption]].
* When Diluc's HP is reduced by [[HP/HP Loss|HP Loss]] effects, such as [[Furina]]'s {{Talent|Salon Solitaire|20|nobr=1|type=1}} or the [[Corrosion]] status, the effects of this constellation will not activate.
