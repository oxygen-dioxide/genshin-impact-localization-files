|text    = Today is the day of a sacred star's descent from the depths of the night sky into the mundane world... That star was I, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung! Rejoice, for today is Fischl von Luftschloss Narfidort's... Day of Destiny. And as the Destined One of this blessèd day, the power to bequeath blessings is bestowed upon me now.

Since the things you wish for on your birthday come true, then... best wishes for other people should also work...

By the Prinzessin's power of Phantasmagoria, I hereby bequeath unto you the almighty power to crush all circumstances that would seek to conspire against you.

Ahem, one other thing.
