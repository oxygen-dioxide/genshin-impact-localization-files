'''Vermillionite''' is an [[Event Item]] obtained during the {{Quest|Currents Deep Beneath the Lanterns}} after defeating a [[Ruin Hunter]], as requested by [[Wang'ya]].

According to Wang'ya, old Ruin Hunters in [[Guili Plains]] who have lost the power of flight use Vermillionite to keep themselves airborne.

==Trivia==
* The item's name likely derives from a combination of the words "vermillion" and "plaustrite."
