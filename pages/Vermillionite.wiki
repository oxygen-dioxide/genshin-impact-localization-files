'''Vermillionite''' is a Quest Item obtained during the "[[Currents Deep Beneath the Lanterns]]" Event [[World Quest]] after defeating a [[Ruin Hunter]], as requested by [[Wang'ya]]. According to her, old Ruin Hunters in [[Guili Plains]] who have lost the power of flight use Vermillionite to keep themselves airborne.

==Trivia==
* The item's name likely derives from a combination of the words "vermillion" and "plaustrite."
