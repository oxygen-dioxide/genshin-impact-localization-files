The '''Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament''' is a tournament that was held in [[Sumeru]]. It was organized by [[Kautilya]], a senior [[Amurta]] researcher, and funded by [[Elchingen]], a businessman from [[Fontaine]]. It boasts a prize pool of 60 million Mora, with another prize of [[Elchingen]]'s entire fortune being given away to the person who wins the Ultimate Trial.

In the tournament, contestants are tasked with capturing Fungi, training them and then commanding them to fight with the [[Wisdom Orb]] that is provided by the organizers of the tournament.

The tournament features two [[Event Domain|event domains]]: [[Fabulous Fungus Frenzy/Special Training|Nilotpala Cup Special Training Grounds]] and [[Fabulous Fungus Frenzy/Championship Progress|Nilotpala Cup Official Arena]]. Both domains are found at the respective [[File:Icon Peculiar Wonderland.svg|20px]] icon on the map.

==History==
During the tournament, Elchingen was exposed as a [[Fatuus]] seeking to use the fungi to cause havoc in Sumeru, while Kautilya was exposed as a fraud for plagiarizing the Wisdom Orb from a previous design. However, the tournament was positively received, so responsibility for hosting the event in the future was passed to the [[Traveler]], the tournament's champion. However they decided that the tournament should be suspended for the time being until [[The Akademiya]] find a way to improve the design of Wisdom Orb.

After some time passed, the once-heated discussions around the first iteration of the event are slowly decreasing and the tournament is being forgotten. To prevent this from happening, [[Haniyyah]] and [[Balfour]] organized a thematic event to promote the next tournament called Fungus Mechanicus, based on [[Theater Mechanicus]] which Balfour bought the Sumeru franchising right of the game from Liyue. With the Traveler's permission, they would market this event as a spin-off of the tournament to attract more contestants and audience in the next tournament.
