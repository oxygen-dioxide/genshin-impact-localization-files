==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Zohreh:''' *sigh* Even after doing the calculations twice, I'm still coming up a little short...
:{{DIcon}} Something on your mind?
::'''Zohreh:''' Yes, I'm a logistics buyer for the Akademiya. I mainly purchase things like spices and blankets.
::'''Zohreh:''' I said I'm a buyer, but the reality is that most of my time working is spent on calculating prices and applying for budgets...
:;(Before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
::{{DIcon}} The Akademiya wants to purchase these things...?
:::'''Zohreh:''' That's right. After all, researchers, students, and other staff all need to sleep and eat.
:::'''Zohreh:''' The Akademiya may have a handle on knowledge, but they still depend on the people for production and need to purchase daily supplies from the private sectors on a regular basis.
:::'''Zohreh:''' However, the Akademiya also provides everyone with free healthcare, imparts knowledge through the Akasha Terminal, and covers the costs of holding necessary festival celebrations.
:;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
::{{DIcon}} The Akademiya wants to purchase these things too...?
:::'''Zohreh:''' That's right. After all, researchers, students, and other staff also need to sleep and eat.
:::'''Zohreh:''' The Akademiya may have a handle on knowledge, but they still depend on the people for production and need to purchase daily supplies from the private sector on a regular basis.
:::'''Zohreh:''' In return, the Akademiya will also provide free healthcare to all and helps foot the bill for any festivals and celebrations that may need to be held.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Zohreh:''' See you. I have to prepare another pitch for a new budget application...
