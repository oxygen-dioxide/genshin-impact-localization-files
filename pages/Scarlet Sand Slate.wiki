'''Scarlet Sand Slate''' is a [[Gadget]] that is used to explore the Ruins of King Deshret. It is obtained during the [[World Quest]] ''[[Lost in the Sands]]''.

Despite its gadget categorization, it is found in the [[Quest Item|Quest]] section of the [[Inventory]], cannot be equipped, and is read like a [[Book]].

Upon unlocking all the clearance levels as part of the quest [[Dual Evidence]] (except The City of Gurabad), the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' [[achievement]], '''Walk Like King Deshret's People''' will be obtained.

===Abdju Road===
The emergence of this text signifies the beginning of a great journey. Follow the guidance you receive, open paths with clearance, and document what you see along the way.

The temple of Abdju Road is the entrance to the King's territory. Unfortunately, most of the pillars have collapsed, and the passage buried deep underground has already become a stage for scorpions and lizards.

===Khemenu Temple===
Leave Abdju Road and walk along the axis in the direction of the sunset. Khemenu Temple is located there.

People have left images on the shrine walls with plant juice and ore powder. These murals will not be easily covered by the wind like footprints in the desert, and they have long been there, depicting the reign of King Deshret.

===The Mausoleum of King Deshret===
The murals watch you leave, and they don't feel sorry about it, because they are well aware what you are going to witness next...

Whisper the name of King Deshret. He was the one who brought this marvelous scene to the earth and allowed every citizen to travel freely, praising his majesty.

You are free to roam here, but do not tarry too long on account of the golden vessel, the journey is not over yet.

The hall buried in sand cannot be seen in its entirety, and thus can only be measured with one's feet. But do not be too hasty, lest you step down the wrong path.

Skilled craftsmen strung the natural caves with thousands of corridors. Such that even someone adept at discerning the directions will inevitably lose their way.

Sing and give praise here, for this is where the location of Al-Ahmar's wisdom shall be revealed.

===Khaj-Nisut===
Located in front of Khaj-Nisut is an oasis, a place for people to rest. Refresh yourselves here and drive your weariness away. Then you may venture forth to pay tribute with radiant faces.

The illusion shall manifest at the end of the threefold trial. Proceed onward, for this is the sacred realm that all the people of King Deshret aspire to enter. The throne resides under the dome of Khaj-Nisut, and in order to ascend to a high place, one must first humbly look down.

The path to reach the throne room is now open. Recite the prayers here to reach the golden slumber where wisdom gathers.

Whoever acquires the wisdom of Al-Ahmar shall lose their bodily form, and will not be able to tell of the wonders he created. Therefore, turn back and tell every stupefied person who has slandered King Deshret what you have witnessed here.

===The Mausoleum's Depths===
====Initial Text====
The village named Aaru is the shelter for the remnants, but those who once witnessed Khaj-Nisut should know that the original Aaru is elsewhere, at the source of the sandfall, at the end of the trials.

The mortal plane is like a river between the underworld and Aaru. Mortals must not cross, must not probe, must not covet, or they shall descend into the underworld forever. In order to ascend to Aaru, one must have a body like that of a vulture and soar above the underworld. One should peck at three different organs in order to obtain the consent of Al-Ahmar, and fly across the river in the form of a falcon.

The resilient who pass the trial of {{color|help|the Place of Rebirth}} shall obtain an unalterable form.

The sophophilic who pass the trial of {{color|help|the Place of Breath}} shall obtain ever-lasting bliss.

The abstinent who pass the trial of {{color|help|the Place of Swallowing}} shall never fear hunger or thirst.

====Final Text====
The village named Aaru is the shelter for the remnants, but those who once witnessed Khaj-Nisut should know that the original Aaru is elsewhere, at the source of the sandfall, at the end of the trials.

The mortal plane is like a river between the underworld and Aaru. Mortals must not cross, must not probe, must not covet, or they shall descend into the underworld forever. In order to ascend to Aaru, one must have a body like that of a vulture and soar above the underworld. One should peck at three different organs in order to obtain the consent of Al-Ahmar, and fly across the river in the form of a falcon.

Go forth, resilient ones, for you shall gain an unalterable form.<!--Complete the Place of Rebirth-->

Go ahead, sophophilic ones, for you shall gain everlasting bliss.<!--Complete the Place of Breath-->

Go ahead, abstinent ones, for you shall fear neither hunger nor thirst.<!--Complete the Place of Swallowing-->

You have obtained full clearance. Except for that abandoned yet nostalgic ancient city, the desert no longer hides any secrets.<!--Obtain full clearance-->

After flying across the river in falcon form, one must burn the embers of the sun at three places using feathers. Only through this may one obtain the mercy of Al-Ahmar and ascend to Aaru.<!--Enter the portal-->

Do not disturb the ancient dream-guards who slumber here, just keep silent and bear Aaru's original appearance in mind.<!--?-->

===Safhe Shatranj===
Linger not here, for this is the remembrance of eternal glory. It is the index of countless pools, the blueprint of the oases, and yet it would become a place of ill-omen, where swords met in anger. But perhaps those who come after may return everything to its former place, and thus allow the paths buried beneath the sands to show themselves.

===The City of Gurabad===
This is where the curtain falls. This is the final secret hidden beneath the sands. This place was once a pearl amongst pearls, a star amidst stars. But now, dust and sand eat at the corners of the buildings, and utterly abandoned, it is but an echo of a bleak, lingering dream.
