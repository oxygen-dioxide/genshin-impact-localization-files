'''Cat's Tail''' is a tavern in the [[City of Mondstadt]]. [[Margaret]] owns the tavern, with [[Diona]] working as one of its bartenders. It is located between the [[Adventurers' Guild]] and [[Good Hunter]], though it is currently inaccessible.

Ever since Diona was hired, business at Cat's Tail has boomed due between her cute appearance and blessing that makes all of her drinks taste delicious. In fact, she singlehandedly disrupted the monopoly [[Angel's Share]] once had over Mondstadt, which piqued [[Elzer]]'s interest and got him bitten when he tried to headhunt Diona over to the rival tavern.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Diona}}</ref> In addition to the drinks, the tavern is also known for its cats, which are a popular attraction.

The tavern also specializes in pizza, being [[Jean]]'s favorite when she has the time to order one.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Jean|Favorite Food}}</ref>
