'''Indarias''', also known as '''General Musatas''', was an [[Adepti|adeptus]] and one of the Five Foremost [[Yakshas]].

==Profile==
Indarias was among those who answered [[Morax]]'s summons to aid his fight against the demons that spawned from the remains of defeated gods during and after the [[Archon War]]. Of the many yakshas, Indarias was one of the five strongest alongside [[Bosacius]], [[Bonanus]], [[Menogias]], and [[Xiao|Alatus]].<ref>{{Ref/Book|Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti}}</ref>

Indarias and Bonanus appeared to be close, appearing next to each other in Bosacius' memories.

Indarias eventually succumbed to the karmic debt accrued from endless slaughter and perished. It is implied she went mad with fear.

==Trivia==
