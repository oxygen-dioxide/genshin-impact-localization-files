{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Aikawa Susumu:''' Let the Aisa Bathhouse warm your heart. Experience the glamour of [[Natlan]].
:'''Aikawa Susumu:''' Ahh, it's a traveler from afar. What a rare guest. Welcome.
:{{DIcon}} The glamour of Natlan?
::'''Aikawa Susumu:''' Haha, it might be a little too much to call it "glamour"... Aisa Bathhouse is a hot spring inn in Inazuma that I founded after experiencing the volcanic hot springs in Natlan.
::'''Aikawa Susumu:''' The healing power of a hot spring is unforgettable once you've tried it. After I returned home, I also wanted my friends in Inazuma to experience that same warm and comforting feeling.
::'''Aikawa Susumu:''' I had no idea Aisa Bathhouse would become so popular. Even some big shots frequent this place, something that makes me regret setting the price so low. Haha.
::{{DIcon}} Big Shots?
:::'''Aikawa Susumu:''' By no means are they senior government officials... I meant those samurai from the [[Tenryou Commission]]. They often come here. But since I'm just a little commoner, they're pretty important in my book, haha.
:::'''Aikawa Susumu:''' Some of them have become regular customers. I make note of it and offer them a discount.
:::'''Aikawa Susumu:''' I guess it must be because they can see plainly and speak frankly while at a hot spring. That must do wonders for fatigue relief.
:::'''Aikawa Susumu:''' Someday, I hope that even the [[Ei|Almighty Shogun]] herself might grace our hot springs with her presence... I imagine she must be in need of some relaxation, given how she has to worry about so many affairs of state...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} What's Natlan like?
:::'''Aikawa Susumu:''' Haha, it's nothing like Inazuma, which has oceans surrounding it. Natlan is a country of red-hot passion, both in name and climate.
:::'''Aikawa Susumu:''' What I said might be a bit confusing, so here are souvenirs I brought back. You can have them. Who knows, you might be able to get a sense of Natlan's scorching temperatures.
::;(Obtain 1 [[Agnidus Agate Fragment]].)
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Aikawa Susumu:''' Goodbye. Feel free to relax in the hot spring when you are tired.
