'''Thunder Spheres''' are objects found in the skies of [[Inazuma]]. When within range of a Thunder Sphere while carrying an [[Electrogranum]] or affected by {{Electro}}, the player can move swiftly in the direction of it. After being used, the Thunder Sphere will be temporarily inactive as it recharges itself.

Passing through a Thunder Sphere will affect the player with {{Electro}}, allowing for continuous movement.

Some Thunder Spheres will only appear for certain [[Time Trial Challenge]]s and [[Commissions]] or if the player begins carrying an [[Electrogranum]] from specific [[Thunder Sakura Bough]]s.
