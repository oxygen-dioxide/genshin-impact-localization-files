===Personality===
''(To be added.)''

===Appearance===
Koutoku wears the Watatsumi Army's standard uniform, modeled from the {{Lang|''ashigaru''|ja=足軽}} of feudal Japan. His clothing consists of a light red-white gradient ''shitagi'' with a red-violet colored left sleeve, gray ''kobakama'', and ''waraji'' sandals without the socks. Although not visible, the [[Sangonomiya Clan]]'s crest is imprinted on the back of the ''shitagi'', below the neck. Additional features on the uniform's design such as breastplates and helmets are not present, compared to Shogun's Army uniforms, but were still equipped with ''sode'' (shoulder armor), ''han-kote'' (half-armored sleeves), ''haidate'' (thigh guards), and ''sune-ate'' (greaves) armor, whose colors were red and black with gold accents. The right shoulder guard has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest imprinted on it. Koutoku is equipped with a ''juumonji yari'', whose shaft is colored with a red-white gradient and has the Sangonomiya Clan's crest under the spearhead.
