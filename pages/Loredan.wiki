===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing ''Canticles of Harmony''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Loredan:''' Ho there, citizen! If you require shelter, simply head to the belltower in the city center.
:'''Loredan:''' The savages have been getting all bold and uppity lately, so be on your guard!
:{{DIcon}} And you are?
::'''Loredan:''' Lauretus Vicetinus am I, under the auxilia of Machimos's Legio III!
::'''Loredan:''' So long as we are here, we shall suffer no despicable invaders to step within the city walls!
::{{DIcon}} City walls? Where'd they come from?
::'''Loredan:''' Hmm? Are we not within our defensive walls as we speak?
::'''Loredan:''' Ah, wait, I see... You're testing me! Why, just as Dominus [[Boethius]] once said, "the mighty legions are the true walls of the empire"!
:{{DIcon}} You mean the belltower?
::'''Loredan:''' Indeed! These are days of fire and sword, after all, and as soldiers of the [[Remus|Imperator]], our God-King, we cannot allow our imperial citizens to be exposed to danger.
::'''Loredan:''' Someone in the belltower will guide you to Machimos. You shall be safe there.
:{{DIcon}} About the barbarians...
::'''Loredan:''' Those savages? There's nothing to be said for those detestable invaders! They destroy our cities, slaughter our people...
::'''Loredan:''' Enemies of the empire I name them... Nay, enemies of all civilization!
::'''Loredan:''' Still, you need not fear, citizen! Dominus Boethius shall soon come to Machimos in person.
::'''Loredan:''' When that happens, all disturbances shall be utterly quelled, and those putrid primitives shall get what they deserve!
::{{DIcon}} Have you met any barbarians?
::'''Loredan:''' Hmm... No, not yet, I fear. They're a cunning lot, I must say. They rarely show up when they cannot be sure of victory...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Loredan:''' Fare ye well, citizen!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''Canticles of Harmony''.''
{{Dialogue Start}} 
:'''Loredan:''' Ah, if only I could play such a wonderful melody...
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Loredan:''' Ah, hello there, dear guests! I'm Loredan Vicentino, a student of Master [[Giovanni]]'s!
::'''Loredan:''' If you wish to order instruments, please seek my master instead. 
:{{DIcon}} A beautiful melody?
::'''Loredan:''' Indeed! Just as my brothers and sisters have, organizing performances at the [[Opera Epiclese]] to endless plaudits and applause...
::'''Loredan:''' That said, I'm not at their level. I must work harder, practice harder, to maintain the prestige of our family!
::'''Loredan:''' That's why I've stayed in town, working for Master Giovanni on one hand, while honing my musical craft on the other. 
::'''Loredan:''' One day, people will surely say of me, "Ah, indeed, you are a descendent of the Vicentino family!"
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye. 
::'''Loredan:''' See you, dear guest from afar!
