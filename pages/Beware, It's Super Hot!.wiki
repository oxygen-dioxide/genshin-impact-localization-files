'''Beware, It's Super Hot!''' is [[Xiangling]]'s [[4th Ascension Passive]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* The chili pepper lasts on the field for 10 seconds only.
*The ATK buff only applies to the character who picked up the chili pepper. It will not carry over to another character that is switched in.
*The ATK buff is not lost upon switching out &mdash; if the character who picked up the chili pepper is switched out, then switched back in during its 10-second duration, the ATK buff will still be effective.
