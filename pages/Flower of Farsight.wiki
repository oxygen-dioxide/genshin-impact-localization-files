|description = One of the six lost offerings scattered throughout The Chasm... possibly? It seems just like an ordinary Qingxin, and one that has newly sprouted as well, seeing as how its white petals have never been touched by dew.<br />Who knows how many people have once climbed up to high heights to pick one such fresh flower? Who knows if these flowers eventually bore witness to partings or reunions?
