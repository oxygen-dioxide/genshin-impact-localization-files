==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You uncovered a strange picture on [[Seirai Island]]...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Obtain {{Item|Picture Commemorating Seirai Island}})
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? This is a picture. And it's got some weird markings on it, too...
:'''Paimon:''' C&mdash;Could it be a treasure map?
:'''Paimon:''' Let's bring this back to the city and ask around. Maybe someone can tell us more about it!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Paimon thinks an adventurer might be the best choice. They'll have the most experience in looking for treasure, after all!

;(Talk to the adventurers in [[Inazuma City]])
:'''Furuya Noboru:''' Hmm, this is quite the headache...
:{{DIcon}} Would you know anything about this map...
:'''Furuya Noboru:''' Judging by the topography, I'd say that this is some place on Seirai Island...
:{{DIcon}} How could you tell?
:'''Furuya Noboru:''' The Guild has commissioned several expeditions to Seirai Island in the past.
:'''Furuya Noboru:''' The adventurers who accepted those commissions would bring us intel on the island in the form of reports.
:'''Furuya Noboru:''' Unfortunately, manpower issues have prevented us from launching large-scale expeditions, so we're stuck sending a few adventurers at a time to explore the area.
:'''Furuya Noboru:''' I'm afraid that this limits the extent to which I can continue helping you to analyze this map.
:'''Furuya Noboru:''' However, I do know someone who might have more to do with Seirai Island than me.
:'''Furuya Noboru:''' His name's Oda Tarou. I've heard that his ancestors used to live on Seirai Island before migrating here for various reasons.
:'''Furuya Noboru:''' Speaking of which, he did come to the Guild some time back to hire some adventurers who would accompany him to Seirai Island to see the place...
:'''Furuya Noboru:''' You can ask him about this map. With any luck, he might know something about it.

;(Talk to Oda Tarou)
:'''Oda Tarou:''' *sigh* When will I find someone who'll accompany me back there...
:{{DIcon}} Would you know anything about this map...
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Are you... an adventurer with the Guild? Can they finally spare the people?
:{{DIcon}} Uh, I'm just a passing traveler.
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Hmm, fine, then... What's this map you spoke of?
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Now, let me see...
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Th&mdash;This! Could it be...
:{{DIcon}} What did you see?
:{{DIcon}} Is this your home?
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Isn't this Seirai Island!?
:{{DIcon}} That it is.
:{{DIcon}} Ding ding, correct answer...
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Haha, is it really? I just guessed.
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Although my ancestors once lived on Seirai Island, that was a very long time ago now.
:'''Oda Tarou:''' By the time we came to my generation, we no longer had any impression of our old home.
:'''Oda Tarou:''' All we have left in the house to remind us of it are three landscape paintings of the island.
:{{DIcon}} So why do you want to go back?
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Well... It is still my "hometown," is it not?
:'''Oda Tarou:''' I feel like... I have to go see it no matter what.
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Unfortunately, I'm pretty busy running my business at the moment, so I haven't the time to go.
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Additionally, I had some trouble finding adventurers willing to escort me to Seirai Island...
:'''Oda Tarou:''' So I went with Option B: putting up a commission at the [[Adventurers' Guild]].
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Hopefully, some adventurers can help me go to Seirai Island, find the three places shown in those paintings, take a few pictures with a [[Kamera]], and bring those pictures back to me.
:'''Oda Tarou:''' But no one's picked up that commission thus far...
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
:{{DIcon}} I can go there for you.
:'''Oda Tarou:''' W&mdash;Would you really? That would be amazing!
:'''Oda Tarou:''' As for payment, you need not worry. I will have it ready for you for sure.
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Well then, Traveler, I'll be counting on you. Including the map you brought, that would make four locations to take pictures of...
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Well then, Traveler, please head to these four locations and snap a picture of each of them for me.
;(Obtain {{Item|Picture Commemorating Seirai Island (II)}}, {{Item|Picture Commemorating Seirai Island (III)}}, {{Item|Picture Commemorating Seirai Island (IV)}})

;(Talking to Oda Tarou again)
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Seirai Island... How I wish I could see you for myself.
:'''Oda Tarou:''' But where will I find the time...
----
{{Quest Description|update|You uncovered a strange picture on Seirai Island. After asking around in [[Inazuma City]], you attract the attention of Mr. Oda Tarou, and he asks you to go to Seirai Island to take a few pictures...}}
;(Talk to Oda Tarou after having taken the pictures)
:'''Oda Tarou:''' You're back. How's it going? Did you manage to get those pictures?
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Of course.
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Wonderful. Please, let me see them...
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Um... Well...
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Ahaha! I can't tell where these places are at all...
:'''Oda Tarou:''' It does seem that those three locations have changed a lot since our family left...
:'''Oda Tarou:''' I wonder if Miss [[Fujiwara Toshiko]] will be able to recognize them.
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Well, actually... I doubt it.
:{{DIcon|Talk}} She's also from Seirai Island?
:'''Oda Tarou:''' More accurately, she's in the same boat as me &mdash; our ancestors both lived there.
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Actually, there's a lot of us here in Inazuma City whose ancestors were once natives of the island, you know?
:{{DIcon|Talk}} So why did you all move away?
:'''Oda Tarou:''' I don't really remember anymore... It was a very long time ago.
:'''Oda Tarou:''' I think it might have been the crazy storms, or to prevent smuggling and illegal border crossings...
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Whatever the case, the Shogunate arranged for the inhabitants of the island to come to Narukami Island.
:'''Oda Tarou:''' Well, that's neither here nor there. This is for you. Take it as thanks for running this errand for me.
:'''Oda Tarou:''' *sigh* Ah, I do wish that I could go to Seirai Island in person sometime...
:'''Oda Tarou:''' But I've got all this business to take care of...
