==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Duqin:''' Do you need some assistance? We bill by the hour, but prices are negotiable. We can support a large number of city guards.
:{{DIcon}} What do casual laborers do?
::'''Duqin:''' We specialize in packing and sealing loose goods, and the handling of luggage and large cargo! Efficiency guaranteed!
::'''Duqin:''' Some foreign visitors don't know how to properly pack their tea leaves and jadeware into their luggage, resulting in damage during transportation...
::'''Duqin:''' Or they are unfamiliar with the roads of Yilong Wharf and choose the wrong path, resulting in them finding stairs in their way and exhausting themselves...
::'''Duqin:''' By hiring help like us in advance, you'll avoid lots of trouble!
::{{DIcon}} Sounds really tough...
:::'''Duqin:''' It's all right. Compared to the guys working as long-distance escorts, we're just moving goods within the city. The work is much less intense, and it's safer too.
:::'''Duqin:''' Of course, some of us aren't official guard material yet, so they're trying to work their way up.
:::'''Duqin:''' The journey from [[Liyue Harbor]] to Yilong Wharf is a great ordeal for guards, and you'll never make it without some skill!
:{{DIcon}} Why do you pay by the hour?
::'''Duqin:''' Oh! Because it's our part-time job!
::'''Duqin:''' Our primary job is to assist the guys in the Secure Transport Agencies with the unpacking and distribution of long-distance shipments.
::'''Duqin:''' However, there aren't that many such long-distance shipments. Since we have nothing else to do between them, why not do some odd jobs and help some foreign visitors?
::'''Duqin:''' Everyone knows when the next long-distance shipment will be arriving, so our work schedule is quite flexible if we only accept a few hours of work at any one time.
:{{DIcon}} We'll call if we need your help!
::'''Duqin:''' Take care then! Who knows? Maybe you'll make a fortune soon, and when the time comes for you to purchase lots of stuff, we'll be there to help!
