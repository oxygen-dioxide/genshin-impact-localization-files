{{Description|An agile and wise soul, endowed since birth with a well-maintained elegance and pride.<br />These mysterious passers-by are clad from head to toe in black fur, and purr from the shadows that hide their forms, only to reveal two large, gleaming golden eyes amidst the gloom. To some scholars, black cats symbolize the study of mysteries, magic, and portents from afar, and are very popular as a result.|[[Archive]] Description}}
'''Black Cat''' is a type of cat which can be found as a [[Wildlife]]. It is the only cat that cannot be put as a pet for the [[Serenitea Pot]].

Cats cannot be killed and are passive towards the player. Attacking one will make it fling backwards, and some [[Elemental Skill]]s can make it run away and disappear. Approaching one for the first time will add this creature's entry into your in-game [[Archive]].
