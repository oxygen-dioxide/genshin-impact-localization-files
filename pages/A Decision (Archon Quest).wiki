;(Approach the marker after passing time)
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon feels like a whole new Paimon after those two days in the hot springs. The [[Abyss]] kinda threw a wrench in our relaxation, though.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Still, spending time here really has felt like a vacation!
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The [[Koholasaur]]s are so nice, and so fun to play with. Their bellies are super bouncy!
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, and [[Atea]]'s snacks were so delicious! She gave Paimon some for the road just this morning, actually.
:{{DIcon}} What was she up to?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yelling at some kids who got caught throwing stones in the hot springs... So, not much has changed since we first met her.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Hey, you guys! Sleep well last night?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep! This area is so nice, hehe.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Glad you like it! I was thinking of taking you guys out to do some sea-fishing. Later tonight, we can eat whatever we catch. Fresh fish is absolutely delicious right off the grill!
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 tonina 01.ogg}} '''Tonina:''' Hey, [[Mualani]]!
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yeah? What do you need?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 tonina 02.ogg}} '''Tonina:''' The team sent out to fight in the [[Night Warden Wars]] has returned.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' And [[Kachina]]? Is she back as well?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 tonina 03.ogg}} '''Tonina:''' Kachina... fell in battle.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 tonina 04.ogg}} '''Tonina:''' But, don't worry! The team was victorious, so the Rite of Resurrection will be held at the Stadium soon.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' That's a relief. The Abyss is cunning, and it was her first time. Mistakes are bound to happen.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 tonina 05.ogg}} '''Tonina:''' Exactly. She deserves to hold her head up high.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Alright, thanks for letting me know. We'll head out in a bit.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Geez, she sounded a little anxious there &mdash; had me thinking it was bad news for a moment.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mualani, you said the Abyss was "cunning" just now. But, it seems like the Abyss just wants to destroy everything!
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Like, think about all those monsters that attacked your tribe. If there really was some sort of "cunning" plan, wouldn't it make more sense to send them to attack Kachina and her small team?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ummm, not that Paimon wants them to be in any more danger! It's just...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Haha, relax, I get it. The Abyss is difficult to understand, that's for sure.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' At a glance, it certainly seems like the only goal is total destruction. The Abyss isn't a living entity, after all, so what capacity for logic or planning could it possibly possess?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' But, through our long history of fighting the Abyss, we've realized things aren't quite so simple.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 11.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Five hundred years ago, the Abyss invaded Teyvat. You know about that, right?
:{{DIcon}} During the age of [[Khaenri'ah]]?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 29.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' That's right. Khaenri'ah suffered greatly during that time, but so did every other nation in Teyvat.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 12.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' And [[Natlan]] was the worst affected of all. It took the combined efforts of the then-Pyro Archon and heroes from every tribe to finally repel the Abyss.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 13.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Even so, the effects of the invasion lingered for hundreds of years, only able to be reversed little by little.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 14.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Our tribe's waters were contaminated. The [[Children of Echoes]]' territory was overrun by dangerous sludge surging from underground. Unrelenting black winds tore across the lands of the [[Flower-Feather Clan]]...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 15.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' It was like each disaster was "designed" for a specific tribe.
:{{DIcon}} So the Abyss understood the foundation of each tribe?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 16.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Exactly. We once thought that the Abyss' desire for destruction was a sort of primal instinct, but its methods are, in truth, marked by intelligence.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 17.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' We now believe the Abyss has invaded the [[Night Kingdom]], and has the capacity to read the memories of this land at any given moment.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And that's how it became so dangerous and cunning, almost like it knows you inside and out...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 18.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yes, and that's why we've been unable to fully eradicate it, even after all this time.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 19.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Luckily, the problems left behind by the Abyss have been successfully addressed by the various [[Pyro Archon]]s we've had over the years.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 20.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Now, every tribe is prospering, and things are looking up. I mean, just look at what we managed to do a few days ago! We totally fought them off!
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (In other nations, I've seen how much effort it takes to truly eradicate the Abyss.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (The people of Natlan live in its shadow every day. Who knows how long it will take for this war to end...)
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You must have had to sacrifice a lot to get to this point...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 21.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Every battle, every sacrifice is in pursuit of a future where we get to stop fighting.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 22.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Responsibility, duty, unavoidable burden... Everyone in Natlan views the war differently.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 23.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' But, I believe we WILL be rid of the Abyss one day, and the efforts of all who fought against them will become a story for the ages!
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 24.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' To think that my name could survive in ballads passed down to future generations... It's kind of romantic.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 25.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Everyone has something that drives them forward, you know?
:{{DIcon}} You can do it.
::{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 26a 1.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' We have to &mdash; not only for ourselves, but for our future.
:{{DIcon}} You make me want to contribute.
::{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 26b 1.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Haha, be my guest! Heroes are always welcome in Natlan.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 27.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Anyway, let's head to the Stadium. Our fishing trip can wait until Kachina's back with us.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 1 mualani 28.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' The sea's not going anywhere!
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|The Night Warden War is complete. Time to head back to the Stadium.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the Stadium of the Sacred Flame)
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, this place is packed already.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Of course! No one's gonna miss out on the chance to welcome our heroes back from battle, hehe. It's their moment of glory!
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Kachina's gonna be so flustered. She's never had this many eyes on her before.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, she doesn't seem like the kind of person who likes being the center of attention.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Looks like I'm just in time.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' [[Kinich]], you're here!
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Yeah, a commission ran longer than expected, but I made it. I heard about the incident with your tribe, Mualani. Is everyone alright?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mualani 03a.ogg}} {{A|vo ntaq004 2 mualani 03b.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yeah, it's all taken care of. Our new friend here's got some tricks up {{MC|m=his|f=her}} sleeve, by the way. {{MC|m=He|f=She}}'s just as strong as Kachina made {{MC|m=him|f=her}} out to be.
:{{DIcon}} I could've done better.
:{{DIcon}} If only I'd been a bit more perceptive.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, look! Is it about to start?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' That's right. Someone will come out and recite a eulogy, and then we'll sing the [[Ode of Resurrection]] together.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' C'mon, let's find a spot with a good view. When the singing starts, just follow my lead, and you'll be fine.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Let's go somewhere higher up, so Kachina can spot us.
:;(The group finds a spot in the Stadium)
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 ntotila 01.ogg}} '''Ntotila:''' Warriors of Natlan &mdash; heed the call of life.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 ntotila 02.ogg}} '''Ntotila:''' We are the inheritors of memory and legend.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 ntotila 03.ogg}} '''Ntotila:''' Those who grew alongside sun and wind.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 ntotila 04.ogg}} '''Ntotila:''' Those who forged our own destiny and future.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 ntotila 05.ogg}} '''Ntotila:''' That is Natlan's fire, the lifeblood of our nation.
:<!--{{A|gnr01 remixed m.ogg}}-->'''Crowd:''' The tale continues on<!-- missing VO files -->
:'''Crowd:''' Glory passed through generations
:'''Crowd:''' Courage ignites the sky and earth
:'''Crowd:''' Once more, victory heralds Natlan's path
:'''Crowd:''' We'll wait for you, we'll sing for you
:'''Crowd:''' Come back, brothers, come back, heroes
:'''Crowd:''' Once again, once again, burn bright!
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' ...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I could not find Kachina within the Night Kingdom, or locate her [[Ancient Name]].
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' ...What?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh. What does that even mean?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Usually, once the Ode is complete, the Pyro Archon and resurrected person will emerge from the flames, but something went wrong...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 lakamha 01.ogg}} '''Lakamha:''' What's going on?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mazatan 01.ogg}} '''Mazatan:''' This has never happened before.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 tepexpan 01.ogg}} '''Tepexpan:''' Well, I think it's pretty obvious. Clearly, the team sent to fight the Abyss didn't win after all.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 tepexpan 02.ogg}} '''Tepexpan:''' Think about it! The Ode rekindles all victors &mdash; we've witnessed it countless times.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 tamuin 01.ogg}} '''Tamuin:''' Since the Archon couldn't find Kachina in the Night Kingdom, that must mean there's more to this "victory" than meets the eye.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! You just haven't gotten over the fact that Kachina beat you in the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame|Pilgrimage]]!
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Pathetic, the both of you...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Your wild guesses are misplaced. We completed our mission.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 tepexpan 03.ogg}} '''Tepexpan:''' Maybe YOU did, but who's to say whether that little girl even contributed at all? Maybe she got scared and ran off...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 tepexpan 04.ogg}} '''Tepexpan:''' Why would the [[Wayob]] recognize someone like her, even if she was on the winning team.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' How dare you insult a hero of Natlan like that!
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Kachina sacrificed herself to repel the Abyss. She doesn't deserve to be subjected to your vile rumors when she's not even here to defend herself!
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 kinich 05.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Calm down, Mualani, there's no point arguing with the likes of them.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mualani 11.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I can't just sit here and let them slander her like that!
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 tamuin 02.ogg}} '''Tamuin:''' To "insult a hero of Natlan," the person actually has to be a hero.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mualani 12.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' You... You!
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 tepexpan 05.ogg}} '''Tepexpan:''' Think about it, everyone! Who do you think is really at fault here? A girl who never should've even gone to war...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 tepexpan 06.ogg}} '''Tepexpan:''' Or the great Pyro Archon? Why would the rules of our nation suddenly stop working!?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' ...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 lakamha 02.ogg}} '''Lakamha:''' That's true. If she wasn't revived, it must mean she failed to achieve victory.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mazatan 02.ogg}} '''Mazatan:''' Maybe the Wayob interpret "victory" in different ways?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 ecate 01.ogg}} '''Ecate:''' I mean, that girl didn't look all that strong to me...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (The Pyro Archon seems to be deep in thought. Why isn't she putting a stop to the commotion?)
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kachina wouldn't have run. That's not like her at all!
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mualani 13.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' No. She's been waiting for this moment for too long!
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mualani 14.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' No matter how daunting the situation, no matter how scared she might feel, she's always the first person to stand up and face it head-on!
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mualani 15.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' We don't even know what happened, so don't you dare try to use this as an excuse to vent your anger or slander her reputation.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 tepexpan 07.ogg}} '''Tepexpan:''' Fine. We'll find out what happened soon enough. Then, we'll see who truly deserves glory...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' That's enough.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' There is no doubt about today's victory, or Kachina's part in it. She is a hero worthy of our admiration and celebration.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' However, the failure of today's ceremony is undeniable. Kachina has not been rekindled, and I offer you all my deepest apologies as I continue to investigate this matter.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' To prevent further casualties, I have decided to suspend the Pilgrimage until this matter is resolved.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 tepexpan 08.ogg}} '''Tepexpan:''' What!?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' No one is all-knowing. No one is infallible &mdash; not even myself.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' But, doubt is a means by which we seek the truth, not a weapon we wield against others.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 tepexpan 09.ogg}} '''Tepexpan:''' I&mdash;I&mdash;I... I didn't mean it that way, Archon, I just...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' If there are things you wish to clarify, then ask me directly. Doubt my answer if you wish, but now's your chance. You have concerns? State them.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 tamuin 03.ogg}} '''Tamuin:''' N&mdash;No, of c&mdash;course not...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Even though I have said nothing to change your mind? Then, it would seem the truth never mattered to you at all.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That guy doesn't even have the courage to answer the Pyro Archon's question. So much for all that glory talk earlier.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mualani 16.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I have a question, Archon.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mualani 17.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' My friend, Kachina... Do you have any idea where she is? It's extremely important to me!
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mualani 18.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I know you said you were investigating the situation, but... I'm sorry, that's not enough!
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mavuika 11.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I've already shared everything I know. If you want to learn the truth and rescue your friend sooner, you should join the investigation.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mavuika 12.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' So, what do you say?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mualani 19.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Of course I'll join!
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mavuika 13.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' In that case, come see me in the [[Speaker's Chamber]].
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' We should join them.
:;(Chasca looks at [[Iansan]], who nods)
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mavuika 14.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Oh, and, if it's not too much trouble, could you drop by as well, {{Traveler}}? I'd like to have a chat.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mavuika 15.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Rest assured, everyone, I'll keep the tribal chiefs informed on the progress of the investigation.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 mavuika 16.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Once again, I apologize for the outcome of this ceremony. If there are no further questions, let's part for now.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, did she just... ask us to come along?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 2 kinich 06.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I believe she did. Let's go. I'd like to know what's going on myself.
:;(Inside the Speaker's Chamber)
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The situation is urgent, so I'll get straight to the point. Kachina is undoubtedly a hero of Natlan, and I'm deeply sorry this happened to her.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' There's been unrest in the Night Kingdom, but I don't know what's causing it. As a result, I've been unable to track down her location.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Until we find and address the cause of the unrest, the Ode of Resurrection will continue to be ineffective.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And that means... Kachina won't be able to come back?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' That's correct. Not until the problem with the Night Kingdom is resolved.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mualani 01.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' How long will that take?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' It's hard to say.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mualani 02.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' ...Kachina always dreamed of fighting the Abyss, of doing her part to defend Natlan.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mualani 03.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' She wasn't afraid of death because she knew, if it came down to it, the Pyro Archon would be there to bring her back to life...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mualani 04.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Whenever we sat down together, exhausted from training, she would always hum the Ode of Resurrection...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mualani 05.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' She was supposed to come back to us. We were supposed to hug her and celebrate with her and share her joy...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mualani 06.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' We supported her every step of the way, but what are we supposed to do now?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mualani 07.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Sit peacefully and wait for her to return? Lose ourselves in grief over her death? Tell me &mdash; are we her friends? Or her murderers?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' That's not fair, Mualani.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' It's alright. I understand your rage and your grief. Kachina's life means a great deal to me, Mualani.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Believe me, I want to bring her back as soon as possible. I would give you that peace of mind if I could.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' But please hear what I have to say, so I can at least give you a broader picture of the issue we are now facing.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 58.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Considering the recent attack on your tribe, I believe the Abyss has found a new means of undermining the rules of our nation.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mualani 08.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' You mean...?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The [[Sacred Flame]] &mdash; the foundation of our resistance against the Abyss.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' If we continue to hold the Pilgrimage and send teams to fight the Abyss, there will likely be more casualties.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 11.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' But, if we stop altogether, the Sacred Flame will only grow weaker. The Abyss will scale up their attacks, and the tragedy we saw with the People of the Springs will only be the first of many.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' If we compare the two choices, the former seems to be the lesser of two evils.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' ...Sorry. I know that may sound harsh, but I bear the Name "{{Rubi|Malipo|Turnfire}}." Weighing the costs is my duty.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' The raw truth can be cruel. But we need to understand it if we want to approach this rationally.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 12.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' But, what would you say, Mualani? This is personal for you, and unlike Kinich, I daresay it's not a simple case of weighing up which course of action is less painful, is it?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mualani 09.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' No. I can't choose between them, and I don't want to. Saying that one is preferable over the other is disrespectful to the people who suffered...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 13.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' You're saying it doesn't matter whether I suspend the Pilgrimage... the consequences will be equally painful.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mualani 10.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Yes... What happened to Kachina breaks my heart, but I couldn't bring myself to sacrifice other people for her sake...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 14.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' And that is the crux of the problem. It's not simply a matter of choosing the lesser of two evils.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 15.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Either way, there will be people who suffer, and the end result will be the same &mdash; belief in the Pilgrimage will waver.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 16.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Once doubt has crept in, the people will no longer unite in battle against the Abyss. And that is exactly what the Abyss wants.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 59.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Their ultimate goal isn't to break the rules that make the Ode of Resurrection work. It's to destroy the people's faith in them.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 17.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' To prevent what happened to Kachina from happening to anyone else, we need to suspend the Pilgrimage, so that is my current plan, and in the meantime, I've made efforts to strengthen each tribe's defenses.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 18.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Then, we have to find another way of strengthening the Sacred Flame to keep the Abyss at bay. This won't be easy. I'll need time to figure out the best approach.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 19.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I understand your anger, Mualani, but I hope that provided some clarity, at least.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, Paimon thought things were gonna get heated for a second, but the Pyro Archon took the time to explain everything so patiently...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mualani 11.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' I owe you an apology, Archon. I let myself get carried away earlier, and I'm sorry. You're right &mdash; we need to focus on finding solutions.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' We could always hold the Pilgrimage without sending a team to fight in the Night Warden Wars. That way, we would still be able to fuel the Sacred Flame.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 20.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I've considered that, but the two events have nearly always been linked.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 21.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Without the chance to fight the Abyss, Pilgrimage rankings lose their prestige, and competitor numbers will drop.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 22.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' With fewer participants, the amount of Contending Fire produced will decrease, and the vicious cycle will continue indefinitely.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mualani 12.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' So essentially, the Abyss has taken Kachina hostage...
:{{DIcon}} What happens if you stay in the Night Kingdom for a long period of time?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 23.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' You've learned about the concept of [[Ley Line]]s during your travels, yes? The Night Kingdom is something similar.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 24.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Staying there for a short period of time shouldn't have an effect on the person, but with the Abyss in the picture, it's a different story.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 25.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Your sense of self will be devoured until, eventually, you become one with the sea of souls.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 26.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Imagine pouring a cup of water into a rushing river. You can try to scoop up another cup, but there's no chance it will be the same water you had before.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 27.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I won't sugarcoat it &mdash; that is the danger Kachina is currently facing.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mualani 13.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Just like you said, Archon, both of these problems need to be addressed...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mualani 14.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' You can focus all your efforts on dealing with the Sacred Flame. I will go search for Kachina.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 28.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The Abyss poses the same threat to you as it does to her. It is very possible you will not return. Knowing that, do you still choose to go?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mualani 15.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Kachina's waiting for us to rescue her &mdash; that's all that matters.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' I failed to protect her during our campaign, but I can make it up to her now. I choose to go as well.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, {{Traveler}}? What do you think?
:{{DIcon}} This isn't how it should end for her.
:{{DIcon}} I promised she would have the chance to learn from me.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 29.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Understood. Then, I'll support you in any way I can.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 30.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The [[Masters of the Night-Wind]] have a technique that can extract an Ancient Name from the Ley Lines.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 31.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' If we can find Kachina's Ancient Name, I can use the link between them to pinpoint her position within the Night Kingdom.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 32.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Then comes the hard part &mdash; You need to visit the Night Kingdom in person and rescue her.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, isn't the Night Kingdom a land of souls? Can we even go there?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 33.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Under normal circumstances, only the consciousness can enter, but there is a way to go there in person.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 34.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' However, know that the Night Kingdom will attempt to repel you, and the Abyss certainly won't leave you be...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mualani 16.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' That's fine by me.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 chasca 03.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Same here. Fighting the Abyss is nothing new for me.
:{{DIcon}} It won't be a problem.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 paimon 05a.ogg}} {{A|vo ntaq004 3 paimon 05b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, uh, Paimon's the only one who's scared? W&mdash;Well, if you're going, {{Traveler}}, Paimon's going too.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 35.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' [[Citlali]] of the Masters of the Night-Wind once created an artifact that can be used to communicate with the Wayob. We call it the Spiritspeaker Stone.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 36.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' It was originally used as a ceremonial artifact wielded by the tribal chiefs, but that spiritual quality also means it can be used to search for an Ancient Name.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 kinich 05.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' That was the artifact I delivered to the [[Scions of the Canopy]] a few days ago. Didn't think I'd be hearing about it again so soon.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mualani 17.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Thank you so much for your help, everyone.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 37.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Your thanks are unnecessary. I will offer you whatever aid I can, but your fellowship and courage are what will truly decide the success of this operation.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 38.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Besides, you're the ones helping me. I can only focus on one thing at a time, after all.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 39.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' {{Traveler}}, I certainly didn't expect our first conversation to be so serious.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 40.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I've heard all about your accomplishments. Ever since you arrived, I've been hoping to meet you and offer you Natlan's highest level of hospitality.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... Why?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 41.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' "Why"? Is that not what happened in the other nations you've visited?
:{{DIcon}} It's kind of complicated.
:{{DIcon}} But, looks like we're really making a name for ourselves.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, things were pretty complicated at the start... and, y'know, in the middle... But, our reputation's solid nowadays!
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 42.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Haha, that's more like it. After all, I've heard you're someone who transcends fate.
:{{DIcon}} You know quite a lot about me.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 43.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Perhaps even more than you can imagine. But we can talk about that some other time.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 44.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Ideally, this would be the perfect night for a drink and some musical ambiance. But, there are important things to be done.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mualani 18.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' Oh, I almost forgot... Atea was wounded in the fight against the Abyss. She wanted us to give this to you.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mualani 19.ogg}} '''Mualani:''' It "embodies fond memories and my strength of will" &mdash; that's what she asked us to tell you. She said you'd know what that means...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 45.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' ...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 46.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I didn't think this day would come so soon. The flames of her life force... I can feel them flowing within the talisman.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 47.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' If things were different, the two of us could have enjoyed the hot springs together while she gave this to me in person. We're supposed to be "hot spring buddies," after all.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 48.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' But, don't worry. This talisman means a great deal to me. I'll take good care of it, and once this is all over, I'll pay Atea a visit.
:;(Everyone leaves the Speaker's Chamber except Iansan, Kinich, and Mavuika)
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 kinich 06.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' You said you didn't want to jeopardize the production of Contending Fire... But, that's not at all why you decided to suspend the Pilgrimage, is it...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 49.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' You're right. Even now, the production of Contending Fire is far from sufficient.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 50.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The gradual corrosion caused by the Abyss has resulted in a massive shortage of Pyro energy, and we're currently at the breaking point.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 51.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' As things stand, the Pilgrimage is a lost cause. Suspending it allows us to save our strength to defend the tribes.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 52.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The Abyss has brought catastrophe to Natlan, and Kachina's disappearance in the Night Kingdom is a direct consequence of that.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' *sigh* We can't let the general public know that.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 53.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' No. If the public learned that Natlan's destruction was close at hand, there would be immense panic.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 54.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' But, if I said nothing at all, they would have continued to question the integrity of Natlan's heroes.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 kinich 07.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Another simple choice. The latter was clearly the better solution, but you chose otherwise.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 55.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I have never subscribed to the belief that the "right" choice is the one with the fewest "sacrifices."
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 56.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Let's go. There's still a way for the Sacred Flame to last a little longer.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' You mean...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 3 mavuika 57.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Yes. Come with me.
:;(Outside, in the Stadium of the Sacred Flame)
:{{A|vo ntaq004 4 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The Sacred Flame must never go out. Not only does it strike fear in the Abyss, but it's also the pillar of Natlan's stability.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 4 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' So, until our heroes are ready, I will sacrifice my power to keep it burning.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 4 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' But, that can only last so long. I think we should focus on the remaining Ancient Name bearers.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 4 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Don't let desperation cloud your judgment...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 4 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Those chosen by the Wayob have already embarked on their destined path. It is for them to decide how that journey ends, not us.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 4 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' All we can do is support them.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 4 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Even so, for you to make this sacrifice... It's not right...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 4 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Hah, if not me, then who? No other is capable of sustaining the Sacred Flame.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 4 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' I possess great strength, but I'm not above my people. This is part of my duty.
:{{Cutscene Description|Just as Mavuika and the others are talking, [[The Captain]] bursts into the Stadium of the Sacred Flame leading the [[Fatui]], proclaiming his intent to seize the [[Gnosis]]. Mavuika accepts the challenge head-on, and they engage in a fierce duel, shaking the whole stadium. Finally, Mavuika uses her full power, and wounds The Captain with a single strike. Before they can resume their fight, a cloud of smoke saves The Captain, whisking him away to safety. Mavuika recognizes that the power comes from the Masters of the Night-Wind, and orders that The Captain and his helpers be found.}}

::'''Yagbeu:''' Archon, it's the Fatui!

::'''The Captain:''' A force to be reckoned with

::'''The Captain:''' Long have they been destined for ruin
::'''The Captain:''' And since the oath made five centuries ago remains unfulfilled
::'''The Captain:''' What use is the Gnosis in your hands?
::'''Mavuika:''' I don't know what you mean
::'''Mavuika:''' But it sounds like this is about more than the [[Tsaritsa]]
::'''The Captain:''' In times of crisis, someone must pick up the mantle of salvation
::'''The Captain:''' Your plan has reached an impasse
::'''The Captain:''' And now it falls to me to create new "rules" for Natlan
::'''The Captain:''' But before the dawn of a new age
::'''The Captain:''' The old must be destroyed

:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Are you alright, Archon?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 mavuika 01.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' He was a formidable opponent &mdash; exactly what I would expect from the First of the [[Fatui Harbinger]]s.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 kinich 01.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' I never imagined someone could match you in combat...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 kinich 02.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' If the Tsaritsa sent him here, why would he bring up what happened "five centuries ago"?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Yeah, and how much does he know about Natlan...?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 mavuika 02.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The Harbingers are all driven by their own personal goals. The only purpose that unites them is collecting the Gnoses.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 mavuika 03.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' But I'm sure The Captain has his own reasons for being here as well.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 kinich 03.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Whatever his motive, we should shift our focus to the Fatui. If they attack again and we're not prepared, we're done for.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 mavuika 04.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' No. We're running out of time.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 mavuika 05.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' The wound I inflicted should hold him back and weaken him for the time being.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 mavuika 06.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Besides, I'm sure you noticed... The power that came to his rescue just now came from the Masters of the Night-Wind.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 kinich 04.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' In other words, there are traitors among us.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 mavuika 07.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Not necessarily. This could prove to be a very valuable turn of events.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 mavuika 08.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' When we exchanged final blows, I sensed an unusual presence within him. I'll need to investigate further.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 mavuika 09.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Kinich, go to the Masters of the Night-Wind and look into who could have aided the Captain. Speak to Citlali &mdash; she should know.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 kinich 05.ogg}} '''Kinich:''' Of course. I'll head out right now. Do you still intend to...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 mavuika 10.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Yes, but fear not.
:;(Kinich leaves)
:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 mavuika 11.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Natlan's strength has never rested solely in its Archon.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 mavuika 12.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Together, we foresaw the only path that leads to our nation's future. We must trust in that vision now.
:;(Mavuika transfers her power into the Sacred Flame)
:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Is everything okay, Archon?
:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 mavuika 13.ogg}} '''Mavuika:''' Completely fine. Just lamenting the fact that I never got a picture when I could still turn my hair into flames. Hehe, too late, now.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 5 mavuika 14a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo ntaq004 5 mavuika 14b.ogg}}--> '''Mavuika:''' ...I just hope the others have a safe journey.

:{{A|vo ntaq004 6 chasca 01.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' It feels like the Archon unleashed her power. She must be fighting a formidable opponent...
:{{A|vo ntaq004 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Should we go back and check what's going on?
:{{DIcon}} Kachina doesn't have that much time.
:{{A|vo ntaq004 6 chasca 02.ogg}} '''Chasca:''' Have faith in the Archon. She wouldn't lose in a one-on-one confrontation.
