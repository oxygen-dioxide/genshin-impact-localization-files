The '''Thousand Winds''' is a term that has appeared in legends and historical texts of [[Mondstadt]] and [[Enkanomiya]]. It has been used to refer to the following:
#[[Istaroth]], the God of Time, also known as "the thousand winds of time" or simply "the thousand winds."<ref name="HSiB">{{Ref/Item|Hydrological Studies in Byakuyakoku}}</ref>
#Personifications of the winds that protect Mondstadt, including [[Barbatos]] ([[Venti]]).<ref name="atlas">{{Ref/Weapon|Skyward Atlas}}</ref><ref name="Venti3">{{Ref/CS|Venti|3}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Should You Be Trapped in a Windless Land (Quest)}}</ref>

==Overview==
Sources differ on what exactly the Thousand Winds encompass or represent. In Enkanomiya beliefs, Istaroth is the personification of "undying wind" and the phrases "the thousand winds of time" and "the thousand winds" refer to her and the power of wind.<ref name="HSiB" />

In Mondstadt, where worship of Istaroth seems to have faded out and been forgotten, "the thousand winds" is currently interpreted as the literal winds and clouds in northern [[Teyvat]], each of which were allegedly given names and personalities through the Cloud Atlas and serve as Mondstadt's protectors.<ref name="atlas" /><ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Skyward Spine}}</ref> [[Venti]] was originally a "single thread of the thousand winds" before he amassed power and eventually rose to godhood and the position of Archon as [[Barbatos]].<ref name="Venti3" /> Venti's power over wind is referred to, both by himself and by various descriptions in the game, as calling on the power of the thousand winds.<ref name="atlas" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Dragon Storm}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Skyward Harp}}</ref>

The [[Aranara]] of [[Sumeru]] reference winds bringing seeds, some containing information about the traveler.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Children of the Forest}}</ref> The Aranara, Aranaga describes a flower in their possession as being unable to be blown away by "the Ad Oblivione", which they later clarify to be "the thousand winds that return to one."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Final Chapter}}</ref>

The [[Thousand Winds Temple]], on the other hand, preserved some of the worship of the "god of Time"; the carvings on the sundials at the [[Thousand Winds Temple]] and the [[Nameless Island]] leave messages associated with both the god of Time and the god of Anemo:
:''"Seeds of stories, brought by the wind and cultivated by time."<br />Stories brought on the wind will bloom into legends in due time."''
This can also be confirmed with the [[Ragged Notebook (Time and Wind)|Ragged Notebook]] written by the missing
friend of [[Henry Morton]], and the weapons in the [[Sacrificial Series]]:
{{Quote|On the cliff facing the eastern sea, the ancestors worshipped the masters of Time and Anemo together.<br />The two are intimately related, as expressed in the saying, "Anemo brings stories while Time nurtures them."|Opening lines of the lore in [[Sacrificial Bow#Lore|Sacrificial Bow]], [[Sacrificial Greatsword#Lore|Sacrificial Greatsword]] and [[Sacrificial Sword#Lore|Sacrificial Sword]]}}{{Quote|Rituals took the form of performances, [...]<br />A group who could bear the cold no longer built a shrine high on a clifftop in the east.|[[Sacrificial Fragments#Lore|Sacrificial Fragments']] lore}}
