'''Yarshater''' is a Herbad in the [[Sumeru Akademiya]]'s [[Vahumana|Vahumana Darshan]].

Yarshater was one of the Vahumana researchers who translated the [[Scroll of Streaming Song]]. In response to [[Tafazzoli]], a [[Haravatat]] Herbad who left several footnotes criticizing Vahumana's translations, Yarshater left footnotes of his own pointing out that Tafazzoli purposefully had not pointed out the issues while they were working together on the project.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Scroll of Streaming Song}}</ref>
