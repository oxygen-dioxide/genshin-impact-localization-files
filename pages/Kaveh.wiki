'''Kaveh''' is a playable {{Dendro}} [[character]] in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''.

The architect behind the [[Palace of Alcazarzaray]], Kaveh was a student of the [[Kshahrewar]] Darshan of the [[Sumeru Akademiya]] and graduated with honors, earning the moniker "Light of Kshahrewar." Having become insolvent after the construction of the Palace of Alcazarzaray, he was forced to reside with [[Alhaitham]], whom he has a complicated relationship with. In spite of the illustrious façade he maintains to outsiders, Kaveh is often saddled with guilt for his [[Kaveh's Father|father]]'s death, ashamed of his poverty, and struggling with realizing his ideals.
