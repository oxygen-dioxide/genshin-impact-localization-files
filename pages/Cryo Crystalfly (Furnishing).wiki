|description    = Pure elemental life-forms composed of drifting [[Cryo]] particles, as free and unbound as the butterflies they resemble.<br>A glittering Cryo creature that is the product of rising and condensing elements, and which feeds off the power of Cryo that is scattered amidst the mist and frost.<br>Though it is fragile beyond comparison, it still dances amidst the blizzard. It is completely harmless by itself, but it is also a portent of the descent of snow, which silences all life. Here in the Realm Within, though, they bring a refreshing gust of cool air to any who pass by.
