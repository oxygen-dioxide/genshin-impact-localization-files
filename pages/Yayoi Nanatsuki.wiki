==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Yayoi Nanatsuki:''' Yayoi Lacquerware &mdash; we sell only the best.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about your wares...
::'''Yayoi Nanatsuki:''' If you want the best lacquerware in Inazuma, this is the place to be.
::'''Yayoi Nanatsuki:''' We sell only the highest-quality items. Even big shots from the Shogunate order from us.
::'''Yayoi Nanatsuki:''' Our venerable store has been around for many years. I am the fourth generation owner and have inherited the pursuit of perfection from my ancestors.
::'''Yayoi Nanatsuki:''' Add that to the unique craftsmanship I learned from [[Sumeru]], and I am sure that I will have much to add to our legacy.
::{{DIcon}} Sumeru?
::'''Yayoi Nanatsuki:''' I once traveled to and studied at Sumeru Akademiya. The secret crafting techniques that I learned there has helped to me create unique paints. <!--guessing they meant 'helped me to'?-->
::'''Yayoi Nanatsuki:''' Lacquerware-making techniques are truly fascinating. My goal is to combine everything I have learned and become the best of the best.
::'''Yayoi Nanatsuki:''' If my skill can reach that apex, I am sure that my lacquerware will bear out the pattern of the truth.
:{{DIcon}} May I use the Crafting Bench here?
::'''Yayoi Nanatsuki:''' Be my guest, as long as you don't hinder my research. Use caution.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Yayoi Nanatsuki:''' Good bye! The next time we meet, you shall behold my newest work.

==Trivia==
* The character of Yayoi Nanatsuki {{Lang|zh=弥生七月|zh_rm=Míshēng Qīyuè}} is a possible reference to the main character of ''Legend of Saha'', Misei Nanatsuki {{Lang|zh=弥生奈奈月|zh_rm=Míshēng Nàinàiyuè}}. ''Legend of Saha'' ({{Lang|zh=娑婆物语|zh_rm=Suōpó Wùyǔ|mini=1}}) was the first game produced by miHoYo's co-founder Cai Haoyu.
** In Yayoi Nanatsuki's dialogue, she speaks of her experience of learning lacquerware craftmanship in Sumeru. In ''Legend of Saha'', "Sumeru" was mentioned in Misei Nanatsuki's point of view, "Misei Nanatsuki is me ... I gathered the physical body again, finally reborned under the Sumeru mountain."<ref>Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nt411n7yT 米哈游黑历史娑婆物语关卡体验，以及背后的故事]</ref>
* The name of March 7th {{Lang|zh=三月七|zh_rm=Sanyuè Qī}}, a character from the miHoYo title ''Honkai: Star Rail'', is similar to Yayoi Nanatsuki's name. "{{Lang|ja=弥生|mini=1}}" is a Japanese poetic term that refers to the month of spring, March. "{{Lang|zh=七|mini=1}}" refers to the number 7.
