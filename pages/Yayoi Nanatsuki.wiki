==Trivia==
* Yayoi Nanatsuki {{Lang|zh=弥生七月|zh_rm=Míshēng Qīyuè}} is a possible reference to the main character of ''Legend of Saha'', Misei Nanatsuki {{Lang|zh=弥生奈奈月|zh_rm=Míshēng Nàinàiyuè}}. ''Legend of Saha'' ({{zh|娑婆物语|rm=Suōpó Wùyǔ}}) was the first game produced by miHoYo's co-founder Cai Haoyu.
** In Yayoi Nanatsuki's dialogue, she speaks of her experience of learning lacquerware craftmanship in Sumeru. In ''Legend of Saha'', "Sumeru" was mentioned in Misei Nanatsuki's point of view, "Misei Nanatsuki is me ... I gathered the physical body again, finally reborned under the Sumeru mountain."<ref>Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1nt411n7yT {{zh|米哈游黑历史娑婆物语关卡体验，以及背后的故事}}]</ref>
* The name of {{Not a Typo|March 7th}} {{Lang|zh=三月七|zh_rm=Sanyuè Qī}}, a character from the miHoYo title ''Honkai: Star Rail'', is similar to Yayoi Nanatsuki's name. "{{ja|弥生}}" is a Japanese poetic term that refers to the month of spring, March. "{{zh|七}}" refers to the number 7.
* Yayoi Nanatsuki shares the same English voice actor as the [[Raiden Shogun]].
