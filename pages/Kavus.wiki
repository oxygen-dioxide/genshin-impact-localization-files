==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* Kavus' name may be derived from {{w|Kay Kāvus}}, a mythological Persian king who is best known for building a flying throne, on which he managed to fly all the way over to China before the vultures carrying his throne became too tired to fly and dropped him and his throne.
