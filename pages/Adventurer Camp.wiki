|description    = A campsite hastily made by adventurers deep in the wilds.<br />When adventurers make camp, they must be sure to place a fence down to fend wild beasts off. But since the area rarely has enough wood to create complete protection, they must often keep watch on shifts and sound the alarm to avoid any slip-ups and mishaps.
