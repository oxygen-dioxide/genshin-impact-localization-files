===Tatarasuna Mystery===
{{Quote|It was all a horrific experiment planned by [[The Doctor]]... Everything he did was just to plant seeds of disaster in [[Inazuma]] that would bear fruit in the future. Of all the unwitting participants in The Doctor's experiment, [[The Balladeer]] became the main test subject.|[[Nahida]]|[[The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call]]}}
The '''Tatarasuna Mystery'''<ref name="TNBFatCC">{{Ref/Quest|The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call}}</ref> was an incident that occurred around 400 years ago that resulted in the illnesses of many workers at the [[Mikage Furnace]] and the death of multiple historical characters in [[Inazuma]]. It was considered a mystery due to some unexplained circumstances, primarily the involvement of a [[Scaramouche|kabukimono]].

;Background
While investigating a landslide caused by [[Crystal Marrow]] miners, Katsuragi&mdash;the yoriki of Inspector [[Mikoshi Nagamasa]]&mdash;discovered Shakkei Pavilion and met a [[Scaramouche|young man]] passed out there. Katsuragi evacuated the young man out and brought him to Nagamasa. They would start to call him the kabukimono. However, Katsuragi would notice the [[Plume of Luxury|golden pinion]] the kabukimono had and realize his identity; understanding the kabukimono had his reasons not to mention his origin, Katsuragi would change his story to say that he instead found him at [[Nazuchi Beach]], and beseeched the kabukimono not to reveal the lie or his own identity.<ref name="CS1">{{Ref/CS|Wanderer|1}}</ref> In addition, Nagamasa "dealt with" the kabukimono in a "certain fashion" upon knowing of his true identity, but what he did to him is unclear.<ref name="PoL">{{Ref/Arti|Plume of Luxury}}</ref> Nevertheless, Katsuragi and Nagamasa, alongside Armory Officer [[Niwa Hisahide]] and Vice Armory Officer [[Miyazaki Kaneo]], treated the kabukimono as their friend and taught him basic skills such as literacy and cooking. During this time, Nagamasa was also able to forge a nagamaki, the "Daitatara Nagamasa." Its beauty caused a member of Nagamasa's entourage, [[Nozomu]], to draw a picture of it, and Katsuragi to conduct a sword dance with the kabukimono.<ref name="RAN">Interactable: [[Rather Aged Notes]]</ref>

In the meantime, a mechanic from Fontaine named [[Escher]] started working with the [[Akame Clan]] to revolutionize the forging process in the [[Mikage Furnace]]. Through Escher's techniques that made use of Crystal Marrow, forging efficacy and production were increased in the furnace. Akame would eventually introduce Escher to Niwa Hisahide.<ref name="CS2">{{Ref/CS|Wanderer|2}}</ref>

;Anomalies and confrontation
As time passed, however, black gas started to form around the furnace and spread to the environment The black gas was [[Tatarigami]] power, which originated from the Crystal Marrow used to expedite and improve the forging process. This started to make workers ill and die, and the furnace itself eventually reached the point in which it was unapproachable and virtually impossible to stop. As the highest authority in Tatarasuna, Niwa implemented an information blackout to control the situation. Many people went out to sea in order to get help from [[Tenshukaku]], but none returned.<ref name="CS2" />

Niwa met with [[Escher]] to discuss how to stop the furnace from killing people. While the Armory Officer suggested to sacrifice himself by going to the furnace with the mechanic's new purification device, Niwa also confronted Escher about his suspicions that the mechanic was intentionally sabotaging Tatarasuna. Niwa also reveals that Mikoshi Nagamasa had reservations about Escher, although chose not to act on it due to being cautious about his family name. Before this confrontation, Niwa already had his subordinates look into Escher's background and found that Escher was an alias and he was not from Fontaine.<ref name="TNBFatCC" />

In the end, Escher fatally stabs Niwa and reveals to him that he is the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers|Fatui Harbinger]] "[[The Doctor]]." Alongside just giving Inazuma a minor inconvenience to deal with, he also states how this entire plan was a controlled experiment with the kabukimono as its main test subject. He made the purification device Niwa holds with the kabukimono in mind, as he had already planned to kill Niwa, place his heart into the device, and give it to the kabukimono to see what would happen to him. In his final moments, Niwa asks The Doctor to tell the kabukimono that he and Nagamasa considered see him as one of them, but this wish would ultimately not be fulfilled. As Niwa finally succumbs to his wounds, The Doctor informs [[The Jester]] that he has completed the mission, and that he would be introducing a puppet to him.<ref name="TNBFatCC" />

;The betrayals
While Niwa was confronting Escher, the kabukimono had also boarded a boat to [[Inazuma City]] to ask for an audience with [[Ei|the Shogun]] to receive help from Tenshukaku. Unbeknownst to him, however, the Shogun had already retreated to the [[Plane of Euthymia]] as she had completed the [[Guardian of Eternity]]&mdash;the perfect puppet with the kabukimono as the template&mdash;and given it the power to manage the nation. He was repeatedly refused, so instead he gave his [[Plume of Luxury|golden feather]] to meet with [[Yae Miko]]. As Yae was busy assisting the Guardian, she could only meet the kabukimono briefly, and although she came as soon as possible and assured him that help would be on the way, he already made up his mind; the Shogunate has forsaken Tatarasuna. He returned there in despair. The help Yae promised did arrive, but they did not arrive to any disaster, and almost no one knew what happened due to the information blackout Niwa had implemented. When they interrogated the mechanic Escher, he stated that Niwa had fled with his family to escape a crime he had committed and that the kabukimono went into the core of the furnace to cleanse it in Niwa's place, shutting the furnace down. When Yae received word of this, she merely sent someone to return the golden feather to the kabukimono.<ref name="CS2" />

In reality, when the kabukimono returned to Tatarasuna, he was given a device by Escher and instructed to enter the furnace and absorb all of the Tatarigami caused by the smelting process. The load was too much to bear for the kabukimono, but he survived. In disbelief and exhaustion, he asked Escher what was in the device. Escher then lies to the kabukimono, telling him that it was the heart of one of Niwa's subordinates that he killed, when in fact it was Niwa's heart that Escher removed from the Armory Officer's chest. Escher added that this was Niwa's gift to the kabukimono before he fled to avoid punishment for what he had supposedly done. This statement left the kabukimono conflicted, as he had felt completely betrayed by Niwa killing an innocent person, but that injustice was what ensured his survival in the furnace. Overwhelmed, he threw the heart to the ground and left Tatarasuna soon after.<ref name="TNBFatCC" /> [[The Jester]] would eventually find him and the kabukimono would become the Sixth Fatui Harbinger, taking on the name "[[The Balladeer]]".<ref name="CS4"> {{Ref/CS|Wanderer|4}}</ref> As The Balladeer, he would cause another incident with the [[Raiden Gokaden]], titled the [[Case of the Eccentric]].

;Aftermath and legacy
Niwa's information blackout and The Doctor's lie ensured that the truth would not be known for 400 years. Due to Niwa's disappearance, blame fell onto Inspector Mikoshi Nagamasa for the incident. However, he was still insistent in clearing his family's name, and therefore refused to die. Knowing this, his yoriki Katsuragi decided to take the blame and punishment, and Nagamasa killed him with the sword he had forged earlier, the Daitatara Nagamasa. Katsuragi's death would be rationalized by saying that he had committed some kind of malfeasance. After Katsuragi's death, Nagamasa threw the blade into the furnace, melting it; but Nozomu, having disagreed with Nagamasa's decision, went into the furnace a drew the melted blade out of it. Nozomu sustained severe burn injuries which killed him that same night. Another member of Nagamasa's entourage, [[Kinjirou]], decided to hide the melted weapon's remains and Nozomu's drawing in [[the Arsenal]], with only [[Miyazaki Kaneo]] beware of this. Both Nagamasa and the sword eventually became known as [[Katsuragikiri Nagamasa]], or ''Katsuragi-Slashing Nagamasa''.<ref name="RAN" /><ref name="KW">{{Ref/Weapon|Katsuragikiri Nagamasa}}</ref><ref name="CS5">{{Ref/CS|Wanderer|5}}</ref>

In the present times, the [[Rather Aged Notes]], which chronicled the events of the forging of the Daitatara Nagamasa and Katsuragi and Nozomu's deaths, were plundered by the [[Fatui]] during their recent takeover of the [[Mikage Furnace]]. A certain Mr. Rumi had also discovered the notes and made a report on "The Haply Hidden Tales of Tatarasuna;" this report became the basis for the works of two writers from [[Sumeru]], [[Aqaba]] and [[Sawada]], who wrote an essay and a book about the incident, respectively. And while the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] were walking to the [[Sanctuary of Surasthana]] to ask for information from the Dendro Archon [[Nahida]] regarding the [[Traveler's Sibling]], they overheard the two discussing their writings, intriguing the adventurers. After listening to the writers, the Traveler and Paimon saw The Balladeer to pass by, prompting them to follow him to the Sanctuary of Surasthana, where they discover that Nahida had struck a deal with the fallen harbinger to search for information of the Descenders in [[Irminsul]]. With the Traveler escorting The Balladeer in Irminsul, they instead find a recollection of Niwa's confrontation with Escher. Nahida filled in the gaps of what Irminsul showed to The Balladeer, and he would learn the truth behind Niwa's "betrayal."<ref name="TNBFatCC" />

;Revised history
Believing that he could change the fate of Niwa and the others affected by the incident at Tatarasuna, The Balladeer went inside Irminsul to remove himself from history. Although his plan ultimately succeeded in removing any of his involvement from the incident, the fate of those involved still remained relatively the same; The Doctor still sabotaged the furnace under the guise of a mechanic from Fontaine, and Niwa still died, albeit this time he had entered the furnace himself with another swordsmith to purify it.<ref name="ADoD">{{Ref/Quest|A Dance of Destruction}}</ref> Instead, The Balladeer became a [[wanderer]] in Sumeru with no recollection of who he was other than being a puppet until [[Nahida]] returned his memory to him from information she saved from Irmisul through a backup.<ref name="TKF">{{Ref/Quest|The Kabukimono's Finale}}</ref>
