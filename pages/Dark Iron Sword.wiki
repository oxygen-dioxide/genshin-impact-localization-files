==Description==
"Why is your sword lying on the ground?"<br>
"I'm sun-tanning the sword to make it darker."<br>
"Why?"<br>
"Good question, kid. What's the darkest thing you can think of?"<br>
"Crows?"<br>
"...Sure. What else?"<br>
"Hm... Cooking pots!"<br>
"Good. Keep going. What's underneath the cooking pot?"<br>
"Fire!"<br>
"And where does the fire come from?"<br>
The girl thought for a bit.<br>
"Coal! Coal is the darkest thing of all!"<br>
"That's right! Coal, or carbon, is what makes iron stronger. But I figure I can just darken the sword by tanning it instead."<br>
With that, he flipped the sword to the other side.

==Availability==
* From [[Chen the Sharp]] as dialogue reward.
* From a chest in [[Wangshan Hall]] in [[Chenyu Vale: Upper Vale]].

==Trivia==
* Prior to [[Version 4.4]], the Dark Iron Sword was the only 3-star weapon that could not be refined, as players may only receive it once from [[Chen the Sharp]]. After Version 4.4, another copy can be obtained from a chest in [[Wangshan Hall]] in [[Chenyu Vale: Upper Vale]].
* The only other Dark Iron Sword variants that can be seen in-game are on the backs of [[Wen the Fourth]], {{LL|Master Qin "Thunder Hand"|,}} [[Sturdy Wu]], [[Huangshan]], [[Little Que'er]], [[Sun Yu]], [[Carpe Diem]], [[Wei Fengchen]], [[The Halberd]], and [[Hanqian]]. It is also seen on the waist of [[Huang the Third]].
* The Dark Iron Sword has no entry in the [[Archive]] system introduced back in [[Version 1.1]].
