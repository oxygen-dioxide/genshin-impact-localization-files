==Description==
"Why is your sword lying on the ground?"<br />
"I'm sun-tanning the sword to make it darker."<br />
"Why?"<br />
"Good question, kid. What's the darkest thing you can think of?"<br />
"Crows?"<br />
"...Sure. What else?"<br />
"Hm... Cooking pots!"<br />
"Good. Keep going. What's underneath the cooking pot?"<br />
"Fire!"<br />
"And where does the fire come from?"<br />
The girl thought for a bit.<br />
"Coal! Coal is the darkest thing of all!"<br />
"That's right! Coal, or carbon, is what makes iron stronger. But I figure I can just darken the sword by tanning it instead."<br />
With that, he flipped the sword to the other side.

==Availability==
* From [[Chen the Sharp]] as dialogue reward.
