|description = A sharp-eyed and proud falcon.<br>It circles the skies at high altitude where the air is cold, waiting for the moment to swoop down and strike the squirrels and small birds hiding in the grass and trees. Hunters say that just a small amount of training can turn this bird of prey into a formidable hunting companion.
