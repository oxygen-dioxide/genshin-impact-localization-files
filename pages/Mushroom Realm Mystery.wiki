==Summary==
{{Description|There seems to be an extraordinarily delicious mushroom in the Collective of Plenty...}}
===Act I - Ardent Land of Plenty===
{{Main|Ardent Land of Plenty}}
{{Description|You ran into a young lady named Varesa, and followed her to the Collective of Plenty.}}

While walking around the [[Great Volcano of Tollan]], the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] come upon a young woman from the Collective of Plenty who introduces herself as [[Varesa]]. She offers to bring them to her tribe, which they accept. On the way, she demonstrates some of her abilities, impressing the two. As they make their way to the village, the [[Great Volcano of Tollan]] erupts, sending rocks flying in their direction. Varesa simply smashes through them before they come upon some [[hilichurls]], who they kill. They finally arrive at the village and Varesa asks them meet them at the arena.

===Act II - Orchard Repose===
{{Main|Orchard Repose}}
{{Description|The warm and friendly Varesa showed you around the Collective of Plenty's tribal camp, and welcomed you into her family orchard with a feast of fresh fruits and mushrooms.}}

Making their way to the arena, Varesa offers to give them a tour of the village and her family orchard. Before they head to the orchard, they stop to talk with [[Iansan]], who explains Varesa's training to them. While Varesa is very strong, she has never been able to get past the team stage during the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]], since she can't bring herself to fight her own people. The Traveler reassures her before Varesa brings the two to her family orchard. She explains that the tribe grows plenty of fruit due to their location being ideal for crops, and they usually sell a fair amount to the other tribes. At the farm, Varesa calms the guarding [[Tatankasaurus]], [[Vanana]], down and explains how she began her eating journey. She also reveals that there is a food tournament being held soon and that her orchard is responsible for harvesting fruits to be used for dessert. 

As the three begin to harvest the crops, Paimon notices mushrooms growing on the property and wonders how they got there. Varesa tells the two that they appeared out of nowhere when the orchard first started, but are surprisingly tasty and can be prepared in numerous ways. After collecting the harvest, Varesa prepares a simple meal with some of the crops, which the Traveler and Paimon find delicious.

===Act III - Field Fungal Traces===
{{Main|Field Fungal Traces}}
{{Description|Sensing something strange about the mushroom, you encouraged Varesa to investigate, and found out the identity of the mushroom god Bifrons, as well as its ancient scheme. Fortunately, it had so little of its divine power left that it posed nary a threat. Varesa offered to take responsibility and keep an eye on it. Over the course of your adventure, Varesa also learned what it means to be a "hero" — namely, to be someone who makes the right choice at the right time.}}
