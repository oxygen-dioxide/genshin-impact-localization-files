|text      = No duel will be postponed or rearranged due to a Duelist's personal reasons. Fortunately, there's only one duel scheduled today, so I'll be able to finish my work on time and use my personal time to celebrate my birthday.

I had planned to go hunting to unwind a bit. But [[Navia]] rushed over, saying she wanted to host today. She justified herself by saying that she has come up with plenty of "challenges" for me. So she'd like me to bring some well-coordinated companions and enjoy the explorations and adventures within the story. It's typical of her, and in the end, I was "persuaded." So today, I'll be joining as a player.

Would you care to join me in the game? The rules are simple enough, and if you have any questions, Navia and I can help explain anytime.

Also, to avoid making things too serious, I'll be attempting to play certain cheerful roles. I hope I won't make a fool of myself.
