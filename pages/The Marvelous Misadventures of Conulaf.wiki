{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the hot air balloon)
:'''Trembling Female Voice:''' Hello? Help... help! Somebody, please! Is there anybody there&mdash;
:'''Trembling Female Voice:''' Right here on this hot air balloon... *sniffle*... it's full of hilichurls...

;(Approach the cage after defeating the hilichurls)
<!-- Remains named ??? even if spoken to before -->
:'''???:''' Ah, my savior! Thank you for your help in... defeating these hilichurls.
:'''???:''' I was just standing on the cliff admiring the scenery, and one of them knocked me right out. By the time I woke up, I was trapped in here.
:'''???:''' It's locked. The key... Ah, right, the key is in that chest over there. Could I trouble you to do me a teensy weensy favor?
:'''???:''' I'd be eternally, utterly grateful if you would...

;(Talk to the woman again, optional)
:'''???:''' Oh please, my savior, this place is so high up, and there are so many Qucusaurs about. You cannot possibly leave me alone here in this cage...

;(Approach the glowing spot)
:'''???:''' Agh, the key! The Qucusaurus snatched it right up! Darnit, that's one meanie of a Saurian! We have to catch it!

;(Defeat the Qucusaurus)
:;(Obtain {{Item|Key From a Balloon Platform}})

;(Open the cage)
;(If Conulaf was not spoken to before)
::'''???:''' *sob* Freedom! Freedom from this prison at last!
::'''???:''' This hot air balloon keeps on swaying this way and that. Heh, who knows, perhaps a gust of wind shall come and blow the whole thing down...
::'''???:''' Even [[Citlali|Granny Itztli]] would not be able to save us then, I fear.
::{{DIcon}} Who are you, anyway, and how did you wind up here?
::'''Conulaf:''' Ah, yes, I haven't introduced myself. Call me Conulaf, a trainee priest of the Masters of the Night-Wind...
;(If Conulaf was spoken to before)
::'''Conulaf:''' *sob* Freedom! Freedom from this prison at last!
::'''Conulaf:''' This hot air balloon keeps on swaying this way and that. Heh, who knows, perhaps a gust of wind shall come and blow the whole thing down...
::'''Conulaf:''' Even Granny Itztli would not be able to save us then, I fear.
::{{DIcon}} What happened to you this time?
::'''Conulaf:''' Ah, it's you, my savior! I did not expect to run into&mdash; I mean, have you save me again during our respective travels...
::'''Conulaf:''' Ah, did I not say previously that my name is Conulaf, a trainee priest of the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]]?
:'''Conulaf:''' As the title suggests, I'm currently in training to be a priest. I've stayed within our tribe all my life, so the elders told me, "why don't you go out and see the world?"
:'''Conulaf:''' And so they kicked me out of the tribe under the guise of training&mdash;
:'''Conulaf:''' Still, I wouldn't call getting caught by hilichurls the good kind of "seeing the world," would you, my savior?
;(If Conulaf was not spoken to before)
::{{DIcon}} Adventuring on your own's dangerous stuff...
:::'''Conulaf:''' Indeed, indeed! Were it not for you, I don't know how long I'd have remained trapped in there...
::{{DIcon}} Well, so long as you're strong enough...
:::'''Conulaf:''' Heh... I fear you're not fooling me with that. There just aren't many adventurers as strong as you are in this world...
;(If Conulaf was spoken to before)
::{{DIcon}} Adventuring on your own's dangerous stuff...
:::'''Conulaf:''' Indeed, indeed! Were it not for you, I don't know how long I'd have remained trapped in there...
::{{DIcon}} You'll be fine so long as you're strong enough.
:::'''Conulaf:''' Heh... I fear you're not fooling me with that. There just aren't many adventurers as skilled as you are in this world...
:'''Conulaf:''' In any case, thank you so much for saving me, my dear savior... Now, after all this wind I've been subjected to, I should head down before giving my continued training more consideration...
:'''Conulaf:''' I don't have much on me, but in my family, we repay kindness when it is shown to us, so let me give you these!

===Location #2===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the crowd)
:'''Trembling Female Voice:''' Hello? Help... help! Somebody, please! Is there anybody there&mdash;
:'''Deep, Husky Male Voice:''' Enough, stop this arguing! You're the one who can't afford it!

;(Talk to the Relaxed "Flower-Feather Clan" Warrior, optional)
:'''Relaxed "Flower-Feather Clan" Warrior:''' Hmm? You're a new face. First time watching the contest? No rules here, mind, but if you lose the bet, then your Mora goes to the house, y'hear?
:'''Relaxed "Flower-Feather Clan" Warrior:''' We had a lass from the Masters of the Night-Wind who couldn't pay up after losing a while back. You know where she is now? Bawling inside that cage, that's where.

;(Talk to the Focused "Flower-Feather Clan" Warrior, optional)
:'''Focused Flower-Feather Clan Warrior:''' Both sides are engaging full-force now, but if they keep doing that, it's going to take a huge toll on their endurance...
:'''Focused Flower-Feather Clan Warrior:''' Hehe... Come on now... When do we get to see those finishing moves...

;(Talk to the Excited "[[Children of Echoes]]" Warrior, optional)
:'''Excited "Children of Echoes" Warrior:''' Come on, Gigadrill! You're the previous champ &mdash; no way you'll lose to that soft-looking Qucusaurus!
:'''Excited "Children of Echoes" Warrior:''' That's it, Drill, that's it! Bob and weave, and look for an opportunity!

;(Talk to the Calm "Children of Echoes" Warrior, optional)
:'''Calm "Children of Echoes" Warrior:''' Odds are one to one-point-zero-five. Both sides are quite evenly matched in strength... But I'm hoping Gigadrill takes the win.
:'''Calm "Children of Echoes" Warrior:''' Still, you saw how Crimson Dancer warded off Gigadrill's signature drill attack by ducking into its feathers &mdash; launched a counterattack right after, too.
:'''Calm "Children of Echoes" Warrior:''' The situation's looking dicey for Gigadrill, I'd say...

;(Approach the cage)
;(If Conulaf was not spoken to before)
::'''???:''' *sob* I did not expect to be locked up in this cage... My dignity as one of the Masters of the Night-Wind is all but gone now, surely!
::'''???:''' A disgrace to the tribe, a disgrace indeed...
::{{DIcon}} Who are you, and how did you wind up here?
::'''Conulaf:''' Me? I... I'm Conulaf, a trainee priest of the Masters of the Night-Wind...
;(If Conulaf was spoken to before)
::'''Conulaf:''' *sob* I did not expect to be locked up in this cage... My dignity as one of the Masters of the Night-Wind is all but gone now, surely!
::'''Conulaf:''' A disgrace to the tribe, a disgrace indeed...
::{{DIcon}} You again? What happened this time?
::'''Conulaf:''' Ah, my savior, we meet again... *sigh* I'm sorry you had to see that.
::'''Conulaf:''' Ah, did I not say previously that my name is Conulaf, a trainee priest of the Masters of the Night-Wind?
:'''Conulaf:''' As the name suggests, I'm presently in training to become a priest. And... Well, our tribal elders told me that my ancestor, [[Sanhaj]], used to get into betting battles with people from other tribes, often tricking them silly in the process.
:'''Conulaf:''' And so the elders said, "Go make and win some bets! That's the only way to qualify as a true Master of the Night-Wind!"
:'''Conulaf:''' So when I passed by and saw a tournament taking place, I... I made a bet too. I mean, who cares if you've got a "defending Tepetlisaurus champion" or a "Qucusaurus, the decade's strongest rookie"...
:'''Conulaf:''' Our Iktomisaurs would be the strongest, naturally!
:'''Conulaf:''' That's what I thought, anyway... but I bet on the wrong Saurian.
:'''Conulaf:''' Not only did I wind up in debt, but I got locked in here to boot...
:'''Conulaf:''' "Heh, tell you what," they said. "We'll give you ten times your Mora back if the Iktomisaurus emerges the champ. If not, you can just stay in this cage, alright?"
:'''Conulaf:''' What should I do now? Oh, if only there was an Iktomisaurus who could give those other two Saurians a good thumping...
:'''Conulaf:''' That way, I could get out of here, and get ten times the Mora too! ... Ah, I mean, most importantly, we can't have those two tribes look down on our wonderful Iktomisaurs!
;(If Conulaf was not spoken to before)
::'''Conulaf:''' *sob* Please, dear blonde traveler. If you could find such an Iktomisaurus...
;(If Conulaf was spoken to before)
::'''Conulaf:''' *sob* Please, dear savior. If you could find such an Iktomisaurus...
:'''Conulaf:''' *sigh* I probably shouldn't spout such nonsense. You're not of our tribe anyway &mdash; where are you supposed to just find an Iktomisaurus like that?
:{{DIcon}} I'll see about finding one...
:'''Conulaf:''' R&mdash;Really, could you? I&mdash;In that case, I'm just going to stay in this cage and wait for an update from you...

;(Talk to Conulaf again, optional)
:'''Conulaf:''' Oh great Sanhaj, please take pity upon your poor descendant... Guide my savior to {{Color|buzzword|a mighty Iktomisaurus indeed}}...
:'''Conulaf:''' May those from the other tribes who have humiliated your progeny be taught a lesson... *sob*

;(Indwell the Iktomisaurus spiritsconce)
:'''Excited "Children of Echoes" Warrior:''' Now this is a battle... You've got this, Gigadrill!
:'''Focused Flower-Feather Clan Warrior:''' Looks like we have a winner, and it's none other than the Crimson Dancer! If there are no new challengers, then our champion this time is... Crimson Dancer!
:'''Focused Flower-Feather Clan Warrior:''' Are there any more challengers? Do no other Saurians dare challenge for the crown?
:'''Focused Flower-Feather Clan Warrior:''' Oho! It's an Iktomisaurus! Another Iktomisaurus has joined the fray!

;(Defeat "Gigadrill" and "Crimson Dancer")
:'''Conulaf:''' *sob* Ohhh... I thought I was about to be sent home in a cage, my family forced to pay my debts...
:'''Conulaf:''' And while I was in there, I suddenly remembered that our ancestors would stack the deck first before betting, which is how they'd win...
:'''Conulaf:''' So, yes, I had much time for self-reflection while in this cage &mdash; you know, about my unrealistic expectations of beating others at their own game.
:'''Conulaf:''' I don't know where you managed to find such a powerful Iktomisaurus...
:'''Conulaf:''' But I'm grateful all the same! With your help, I've recovered my investment, and even earned back ten times the Mora I put in!
:'''Conulaf:''' I, on the other hand, barely did anything... But I'll need to find a soft bed to lie down on all the same. My back hurts all over from being stuck in this cage for half a day.
:'''Conulaf:''' As for the winnings, you keep them, dear savior! The elders said that keeping an unexpected windfall close will only bring one misfortune, so it's best I give it away!

;(Talk to the Calm "Children of Echoes" Warrior, optional)
:'''Calm "Children of Echoes" Warrior:''' Good, you're not seriously injured, and there's a sauro-vet clinic nearby... We'll do a complete checkup once we get there.
:'''Calm "Children of Echoes" Warrior:''' But I can see that we've still got a long way to go, Gigadrill... Let's do this together.
:'''"Gigadrill":''' Wroo...

;(Talk to the Focused "Flower-Feather Clan" Warrior, optional)
:'''Focused Flower-Feather Clan Warrior:''' Heh... Feeling sore about that loss, are ya?
:'''"Crimson Dancer":''' Crooo...
:'''Focused Flower-Feather Clan Warrior:''' That Iktomisaurus... *sigh* Can hardly believe such a strong one exists. Still, a loss is a loss. We'll just have to win next time!
:'''"Crimson Dancer":''' Grrawk!

;(Approach the camp)
:'''Trembling Female Voice:''' Hello? Is there anybody there? Help me, please! This Saurian cart is so hot and stuffy...
:'''Trembling Female Voice:''' I swear I won't do it again... I promise I won't go anywhere near your alpacas...

;(Approach the cart)
:'''Trembling Female Voice:''' Huh? Is there someone out there? Please, help me...

;(Upon defeating all enemies)
:'''Trembling Female Voice:''' I don't know who you are, but I'm here, inside this Saurian cart... Ugh, it really stinks...

;(Open the cart)
;(If Conulaf was not spoken to before)
::'''???:''' *sob* Freed I am at last! Freed from this Saurian cart!
::'''???:''' Ugh. That cart was so stuffy and hot... and stinky, too! I sat in it for half a day, and I already feel like it shaved two or three years off my lifespan...
::{{DIcon}} Who are you, and how did you wind up here?
::'''Conulaf:''' Ah, yes, I haven't introduced myself. Call me Conulaf, a trainee priest of the Masters of the Night-Wind...
;(If Conulaf was spoken to before)
::'''Conulaf:''' *sob* Freed I am at last! Freed from this Saurian cart!
::'''Conulaf:''' Ugh. That cart was so stuffy and hot... and stinky, too! I sat in it for half a day, and I already feel like it shaved two or three years off my lifespan...
::{{DIcon}} You again? Really? What happened this time?
::'''Conulaf:''' Ah, it's you, my savior! I did not expect to run into&mdash; I mean, have you rescue me again during our respective travels...
::'''Conulaf:''' Ah, did I not say previously that my name is Conulaf, a trainee priest of the Masters of the Night-Wind?
:'''Conulaf:''' My training's a work in progress at the moment, and to that end, the elders of the tribe told me that there are ancestral treasures to be found all over Natlan. "Go do some treasure-hunting, Conulaf!" they said.
:'''Conulaf:''' And so they kicked me out of the tribe under the guise of training&mdash;
:'''Conulaf:''' And well, my keen ears picked up some clues about treasure to be found nearby... Something about finding it if I followed the footsteps of some beast.
:'''Conulaf:''' But doesn't that refer to a [[Shaggy Sumpter Beast|Sumpter Beast]], I thought? Or could it be an [[Alpaca]] instead?
:'''Conulaf:''' Either way, I followed a Sumpter Beast to the camp these folks had made, and thinking I was some manner of Sumpter Beast thief, they locked me up...
:'''Conulaf:''' Forget the buried treasure, I was about to be buried myself...
:{{DIcon}} You had an incomplete trail of clues to begin with...
:'''Conulaf:''' Right you are! I shan't act quite so rashly going forward... Hmm. Perhaps that lesson is the greatest treasure I could have obtained from this incident.
:'''Conulaf:''' *sigh* I'll have to find a place to take a nice shower to get this smell off me.
:'''Conulaf:''' Thank you so much, my savior! Allow me to give you a humble token, drawn from my limited traveling expenses, to show my gratitude...
