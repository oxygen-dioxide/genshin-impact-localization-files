==Summary==
''(To be added.)''

==Trivia==
* As of August 2021<!-- possibly earlier -->, this chapter is currently not available in English (or any localization besides Japanese) on the [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/manga official website], but it is available on [https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/genshin-impact/chapter-9-ludi-harpastum-part-1/viewer?title_no=242646&episode_no=19 Webtoon].
** While this chapter is available on the Simplified Chinese official website, the original Page 13 was removed, likely due to the {{w|Rising Sun Flag}} imagery in the background. The flag is controversial in China, where it is seen as a symbol of Japanese imperialism and militarism.
