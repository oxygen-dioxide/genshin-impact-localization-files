|text1    = This is the mature form of a Rifthound Whelp... or so it would seem. However, these monsters do not have natural life cycles, and their growth remains a mystery. The Rifthound attacks can apply stacks of the "Corrosion" status, which will cause all characters in the party to {{Color|help|continually lose HP}}. Additionally, when they take elemental damage from their respective element, Rifthounds will enter an Elemental Devourer state that will allow them {{Color|help|to fight more fiercely at the cost of lessened RES to that particular element}}.
