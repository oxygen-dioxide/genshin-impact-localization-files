==Gameplay Notes==
* Closing the game or disconnecting from the internet during the initial dialogue resets the quest and can change the version. Since the follow-up commission ''[[Blooming Sands: Lasting Scent]]'' requires completing all 3 versions, and each version can be recognized based on its unique initial dialogue, players can keep resetting the quest until they get the desired version and avoid duplicates in the process.

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|[[Nermin]] is putting a lot of work into taking care of that flower...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Nermin)
:'''Nermin:''' (I hope Raef won't overwork himself.)

===Watering Version===
;(Talk to Nermin)
:'''Nermin:''' Whew... Loosening the soil like this should work...
:{{DIcon}} Are you still looking after this flower?
:'''Nermin:''' Yep. [[Kulsoom|Granny Kulsoom]] gave me a lot of tips on taking care of flowers.
:'''Nermin:''' Things like loosening soil, regularly trimming leaves, getting rid of bugs using various methods...
:'''Nermin:''' Oh, and you shouldn't water them too often, or else the roots will rot.
:'''Nermin:''' *sigh* And I thought watering them every day was the way to go... To keep the soil moist and stuff...
:'''Nermin:''' But it's a good thing, because I don't have to fetch water everyday anymore. The {{W|stepwell}}'s really far away.
:'''Nermin:''' I have to continue trimming the leaves. In the meantime, could you fetch a small can of water for me?
:'''Nermin:''' I've talked to [[Kazan]]. He said I could water the flowers today.
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
:{{DIcon}} Granny Kulsoom taught you all that?
::'''Nermin:''' Mm... Kinda. Granny Kulsoom knows everything. I always go to her when I have questions.
::'''Nermin:''' I'm counting on you! One small can of water will do.
:'''Nermin:''' The watering can is over there. Be careful when drawing water. Don't let too much mud get into the can!

;(Talk to Nermin again, optional)
:'''Nermin:''' Ugh... Why are there so many bugs on the leaves?
----
;(Draw water from the stepwell &mdash; the locations corresponding to the dialogue are randomly determined)
:{{DIcon|Investigate}} Draw Water
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, that bucket's more filled with mud and sand than water. This won't do. Let's draw water elsewhere...

:{{DIcon|Investigate}} Draw Water
:'''Paimon:''' Gah, this one's full of sand and mud. Let's try getting water someplace else, shall we?

:{{DIcon|Investigate}} Draw Water
:'''Paimon:''' Well, this should do the trick! Let's bring this water back to Nermin!
----
;(Talk to Nermin)
:'''Nermin:''' Did you fetch the water?
:{{DIcon}} If this counts...
:'''Nermin:''' Great! I'm gonna start watering the flowers. Please wait a second...
:{{Black Screen|Nermin starts watering the flowers...}}
:'''Nermin:''' Whew. This should do it...
:'''Nermin:''' Granny Kulsoom says that when you're watering plants, you should stop when the water starts seeping out from below the flower pot.
:'''Nermin:''' Because that means the soil has been "soaked through." You need to water them once every three days...
:'''Nermin:''' Ah! Sorry, I got carried away... Here's the reward I promised. Thank you for helping out, Traveler.
:'''Nermin:''' Which tool should I use for trimming leaves...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Kitten Version===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Nermin)
:'''Nermin:''' Oh no... There's more bitten leaves...
:{{DIcon}} What happened?
:'''Nermin:''' Traveler, look! That kitten is chewing on my flowers again!
:'''Nermin:''' Look at this leaf over here... That one too! They all have large chunks bitten off!
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps the kitten is hungry.
::'''Nermin:''' That's also what Raef said. He even went around to feed the kitten...
::'''Nermin:''' But the next day, the kitten came back to nibble on my flowers.
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps the kitten... enjoys chewing on plants?
::'''Nermin:''' I'm not sure what it likes...
:'''Nermin:''' The kitten just munches on leaves for now. What if it starts biting the stems? ...That would be a disaster.
:'''Nermin:''' But I don't want to chase it away either. If it leaves the village, it'll have nowhere to go but to the desert...
:'''Nermin:''' Traveler, could you help me feed the kitten again? I hope it doesn't come nibbling at my flower leaves again. They're not even tasty to begin with...
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
:{{DIcon}} I'm somewhat of a cat expert.
::'''Nermin:''' That would be great! Whenever I see cat paws, I'm worried that the cat'll pounce at me with its claws out...
:'''Nermin:''' Anyway, thanks for agreeing to help. I'll mark the kitten's favorite spot on your map...
:'''Nermin:''' Meanwhile, I'm gonna stay here and watch my flowers in case another little cat comes along and takes a chunk off the leaves...

;(Talk to Nermin again, optional)
:'''Nermin:''' Why does the kitten like nibbling on leaves...? I wonder what they taste like...
----
;(Approach the kitten)
:'''Paimon:''' Look, the kitten's over there! Let's approach it quietly.

;(Talk to Lazy Cat)
:'''Lazy Cat:''' Meow? Meow meow meow!
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! We aren't bad guys! Don't get so worked up!
:'''Paimon:''' This should be the cat Nermin was talking about. Let's give it some food.
:{{Black Screen|You place the food in front of the wary cat.}}
:'''Paimon:''' It really likes the food. Paimon guesses this will do. Let's report back to Nermin.
----
;(Talk to Nermin)
:'''Nermin:''' Traveler, did you find the kitten?
:{{DIcon}} I gave it some food.
:{{DIcon}} I think the kitten's full now.
:'''Nermin:''' Great! I hope it doesn't mess up my flowers again... Cat food is supposed to taste better than flower leaves, after all.
:'''Nermin:''' Thanks for your help, Traveler. Here, this is your reward.
:'''Nermin:''' *sigh* I hope the kitten doesn't get hungry too soon...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Zaytun Peach Version===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Nermin)
:'''Nermin:''' Traveler, perfect timing! Come have a taste of the Minty Bean Soup I made.
:{{DIcon}} The ingredients in your soup...
:'''Nermin:''' I asked someone to buy most of the ingredients for me, but as for Mint... I grew them myself.
:'''Nermin:''' Raef gave me a set of gardening tools and some fertilizer.
:'''Nermin:''' I thought it would be a waste to use them on one single pot of flowers... So I asked Azalai to buy some Mint seeds for me.
:'''Nermin:''' After planting the Mint seeds, I took care of them just like how I take care of the flowers.
:'''Nermin:''' As time went on, the Mint grew and matured...
:'''Nermin:''' So I picked some and made this Minty Bean Soup. What do you think? Tastes pretty good, huh?
:'''Nermin:''' Um... Since you ate my Minty Bean Soup, you have to do me a favor.
:{{DIcon}} Uh, I'm not done eating yet...
:{{DIcon}} You can take this bowl back!
:'''Nermin:''' Hey, I was just joking! I'll give you a nice reward for your help.
:'''Nermin:''' I just need you to pick three Zaytun Peaches for me. They're Raef's favorite fruit.
:'''Nermin:''' I wanna add them to my Minty Bean Soup and bring it to him.
:'''Nermin:''' Now that I know how to make Minty Bean Soup, I just need someone to get the Zaytun Peaches for me.
:{{DIcon}} Got it...
::'''Nermin:''' Thanks! I'll treat you to another bowl of Minty Bean Soup when you get back.
:{{DIcon}} Is he allowed to eat soup while at work?
::'''Nermin:''' It's not gonna take up that much of his time. Besides, he's not too busy with work.
:'''Nermin:''' I'm counting on you, Traveler. Find some Zaytun Peaches and bring them back to me.
----
:'''Nermin:''' Traveler, have you found the Zaytun Peaches?
:;(Submit {{Item|Zaytun Peach|x=3}})
:'''Nermin:''' Thank you. I need to cut them into pieces, then put them in my Minty Bean Soup...
:{{Black Screen|Nermin starts making her special Minty Bean Soup...}}
:'''Nermin:''' Done! Hmm... It doesn't look any different than the regular Minty Bean Soup...
:'''Nermin:''' But I'm sure it's gonna taste different!
:'''Nermin:''' Traveler, please bring this bowl of Minty Bean Soup to Raef.
:'''Nermin:''' I have to make a few more servings for [[Kulsoom|Granny Kulsoom]]. [[Ebeid]] and [[Hilmi]] said they wanted to try some too...
:{{DIcon}} Don't overexert yourself.
::'''Nermin:''' I won't! It's just a few bowls of Minty Bowl Soup, not a big deal at all!
:{{DIcon}} You seem so energetic...
::'''Nermin:''' Well... Since I'm finally able to actually do something meaningful, I have to make the most out of it.
:'''Nermin:''' Anyway, please bring this Minty Bean Soup to Raef.
:'''Nermin:''' I have to prepare some for [[Nawaz]] and [[Ramiz]] as well...
:;(Obtain {{Item|Nermin's Minty Bean Soup}})

;(Talk to Nermin again, optional)
:'''Nermin:''' I have to prepare some for Nawaz and Ramiz as well...
----
;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Raef)
:'''Raef:''' (I hope Nermin will cheer up.)

;(Talk to Raef)
:'''Raef:''' Hey Traveler! Didn't expect to see you here. Do you need any help from me?
:{{DIcon}} Nermin wants to give you this.
:;(Submit Nermin's Minty Bean Soup)
:'''Raef:''' Minty Bean Soup... Did Nermin make this herself?
:'''Raef:''' So that's why she's been acting all mysterious lately. I heard that she bought a few flower pots, too... I wondered what she planted in them.
:'''Raef:''' Not that it's a bad thing. At least she won't be spending all her time worrying about her health.
:'''Raef:''' There's still another batch of goods I need to take care of. Once I bring them back into the village, I'll try her soup.
:'''Raef:''' Oh, and here's a little something for you. Thank you for coming all the way here.
