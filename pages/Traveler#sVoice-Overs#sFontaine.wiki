                    -->'''{{Traveler}}:''' Apparently, the story's based on true events.<br><!--

                    -->'''{{Traveler}}:''' Maybe the work they carry out is essential, but insignificant.<br><!--

                    -->'''{{Traveler}}:''' But practically speaking, the chances of it happening are next to nothing. So it's insignificant at the same time.<br><!--
                    -->'''{{Traveler}}:''' If someone in the Palais Mermonia was assigned a task like that, it'd be up to them to decide how busy they wanna get. Chances are, they'd probably just sit back and do nothing.<br><!--
