|description  = Charlotte's outfit. "If your reporting isn't real enough, it's because you're not close enough." Charlotte often has this to say about journalism. Sometimes, however, she adds: "But of course, maybe it's that the lens you're using just isn't that great."

'''"All Is Overt Through My Lens"''' is [[Charlotte]]'s Default [[Character Outfit]].

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 1-2 paragraphs (preferably 1 paragraph) with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Charlotte wears a red cap with a gold-edged black brim, adorned with a black-and-white ribbon tied in a bow, golden studs, and a gold brooch with the form of a winged quill pen, complete with white feather. She wears a gold monocle with a dangling bow-shaped adornment over her left eye. 

She wears a sleeveless and backless white collared shirt with diamond shaped gold buttons, with a black-and-gold ribbon tied in a bow around her neck, adorned with a round blue brooch resembling a camera lens. She has detached white sleeves with a ruffle at the ends. Over this is a short coat with red pumpkin sleeves ending in folded-back black cuffs and a black mantle-like top with gold trim connecting across her back. This is adorned with a black-and-white ribbon tied in a bow,  secured with a gold brooch. On her hands she wears short white gloves with a small bow detail. 

She wears black pleated shorts with gold details at the hem, over which she has a stiff, red, high-waisted overskirt with a slit over the right leg, gold details and gold trim, and two black straps at each side of the waist. This overskirt is secured by black and gold suspender straps. A wide white belt and thinner white strap with gold details sits across her hips, on which she hangs her camera in the front and a thin black journal on the back. A long, thin white strap dangles from where the journal is secured.  

She wears a white pouch on her right leg, with her {{Pneuma}}-aligned {{Cryo}} [[Vision]] attached to the flap. She has short, red, heeled boots secured with a gold strap and white socks with black-trimmed cream fold over the tops of her shoes.
