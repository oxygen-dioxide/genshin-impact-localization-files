:{{Black Screen|The film has a successful premiere and the musket murder case also successfully comes to an end.}}
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Xavier! It's been a while!
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 1 xavier 01.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Hey there, you two. Sorry I've been scarce, I've been buried in marketing and preparing the film for release ever since we wrapped post-production...
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The award ceremony is today, right? Paimon wonders if we'll win the Furina Award!
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 1 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I'd give it a ninety percent chance.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Furina! Paimon didn't know you were already here. You're earlier than everyone else!
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 1 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I'm sure the others will also be here in no time. Hmm... Xavier, if we end up getting called on stage, shouldn't you come up with a name for our crew?
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 1 xavier 02.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Huh!? But we don't even know if we're going to win. I wouldn't want to jinx our chances by celebrating early...
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 1 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Just open your eyes! Surely you've seen the audience's reactions to our film? We've had nothing but critical acclaim!
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 1 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' You've also had conversations with the opera house's operating staff, right? Didn't they want to increase the number of showings?
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 1 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' With the Mora you've made from the box office, you can now open your very own film company!
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 1 xavier 03.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' B&mdash;But that's all credit to my amazing crew! You've all helped to make this a reality, so I can't be the only one asked to come up with a name!
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 1 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Well, give it some thought. I'm sure the crew will respect your choice.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 1 xavier 04.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Alright... But before that, {{Traveler}} and Paimon, could I trouble you to quickly pay a visit to the [[Fortress of Meropide]]?
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? But shouldn't we stay for the award ceremony?
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 1 xavier 05.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' I wanted to ask you two to invite Chevreuse to join us at the ceremony. She's one of the lead roles, after all.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 1 xavier 06.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' I haven't been able to find her recently, so I haven't had the chance to invite her personally.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 1 xavier 07.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' According to the papers, the culprits of the musket murder case will be personally escorted today by the Captain of the Special Patrol to the Fortress of Meropide...
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon gets it now.
:{{DIcon}} It'll be a piece of cake for us.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep! Just wait here, Xavier, and maybe try to come up with a few snappy sounding names.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 1 xavier 08.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Alright, then I'll leave you to it.

;(Talk to Furina or Xavier, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 xavier 01.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Will we really win an award...
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Trust me. When have I ever been wrong about something like this?
----
;(Enter the [[Duke's Office]])
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 chevreuse 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' This is as far as I'll be taking them. I'll leave the three of them to you now.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 wriothesley 01.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Got another errand to run?
:{{Introductory Note|Wriothesley}}
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Something like that. I'm expected at a party.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 wriothesley 02.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Now that's something you don't hear every day. Found a new pastime?
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 chevreuse 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' No, it's just a special occasion.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Chevreuse, Wriothesley!
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 wriothesley 03.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Festivals really do bring people together. It's been a while since I last had so many visitors at the Fortress of Meropide.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Call it the festival spirit, I guess.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 wriothesley 04.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Yeah, you could say that. Even our [[Sigewinne|head nurse]] has gotten herself all worked up preparing super deluxe nutritious shakes... Just one gulp, and you'll have met all of your nutrition needs.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Were you talking about work just now?
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 chevreuse 05.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' We've already finished discussing everything. So, what do you think about my "heads-up," Mr. Wriothesley?
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 wriothesley 05.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Hmm. I believe I haven't yet made any promises or guarantees.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 chevreuse 06.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' But you also didn't shoot me down.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 chevreuse 07.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Here, how about this? You could give everyone a copy of the newspaper. Perhaps on the day when the cover story happens to, oh, I dunno, expose a certain someone's misdeeds from 20 years ago.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 wriothesley 06.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Hmm. I suppose then, a certain someone may soon find himself the most unlucky person in the Fortress of Meropide.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 chevreuse 08.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' While another two people will soon be hailed as heroes.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 wriothesley 07.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Speaking of heroes, did you two need something from me?
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, uh, actually we're here for...
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 chevreuse 09.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' You're here to invite me to the party, right? Don't worry, I didn't forget.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, then let's head back right away!
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' See ya, Wriothesley! Happy Fontinalia Festival!
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 2 wriothesley 08.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' And the same to you.

;(Talk to Wriothesley, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 wriothesley 01.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Please go and enjoy the festival.

;(Approach the venue)
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 filmfeshost 01.ogg}} '''Film Festival Host:''' And the winner of the Furina Award for the first Fontinalia Film Festival is&mdash;
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 filmfeshost 02.ogg}} '''Film Festival Host:''' "The Two Musketeers"!
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We won! We really won!
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Congratulations, Mr. Xavier.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 xavier 01.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' We won... I can't believe it, I... I... I really can't thank all of you enough!
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' See? My takes on Fontaine's entertainment industry have never been wrong.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 filmfeshost 03.ogg}} '''Film Festival Host:''' Now, please welcome to the stage the producer of "The Two Musketeers," Mr. Xavier!
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 xavier 02.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Thank you... Thank you all so much for your recognition and support. While I'm up here, I would like to give special thanks to&mdash;
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 chevreuse 01.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Time really flies, huh?
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' It certainly feels that way. It feels like it was only yesterday when you were teaching me to hold a musket.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Will you come back to Fontaine again?
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 ayaka 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Of course! I'm very fond of this city. There are so many novel and interesting things that it's been hard to keep track of them all.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 ayaka 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' But how about you? Would you be interested in visiting Inazuma?
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 chevreuse 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I can't say the thought has crossed my mind before... but I'd be willing to consider it now.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 ayaka 05.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I will be eagerly awaiting your visit. It would be wonderful if you could visit my home and enjoy a taste of our tea and desserts.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' Yes, let's keep in touch.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 chiori 01.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Did you accomplish all you came here for?
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 ayato 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Yes. And you should visit Inazuma again sometime.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 chiori 02.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' How has [[Ogura Mio|Ogura]] and her business been?
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 ayato 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' To my knowledge, she's been doing quite well.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 chiori 03.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Tell her I said hi.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 ayato 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' I certainly will.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 chiori 04.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I heard the thunderstorm has stopped.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 ayato 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Yes, and the war has also been brought to an end. Peace and prosperity has returned to the islands.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 chiori 05.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I quite like the sound of that, perfect for hanging textiles out to dry.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 xavier 03.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' &mdash;I'd like to offer my thanks again to the entire cast and crew. Without you, I would have never completed this film, much less had the opportunity to be standing on this stage.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 xavier 04.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' With the support of my entire crew, I would like to officially announce our film company, "Musketeer Pictures"!
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, that has a really nice ring to it!
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 filmfeshost 04.ogg}} '''Film Festival Host:''' Then, in that case, let's please welcome all the members of Musketeer Pictures onto the stage for a commemorative photo!
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Paimon didn't know we'd also be taking pictures!
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 xavier 05.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Director Furina, I believe you are the most deserving person to raise this trophy.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Huh? No, no no no, there's no need... It's so embarrassing...
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 chevreuse 05.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' It's an honor the director deserves.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 ayaka 06.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Yes, I agree.
:{{DIcon}} I can't think of anyone better for the honor.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 chiori 06.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Just accept that you're not getting out of this.
:{{A|vo dyjeq005 3 filmfeshost 05.ogg}} '''Film Festival Host:''' Ready, everyone? Three, two, one&mdash;

:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 yoimiya 01.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh? But I feel like I didn't do anything out of the ordinary.
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 chevreuse 02.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I'm very grateful for your assistance during that special performance in the warehouse.
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 chevreuse 03.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' It was always going to be somewhat risky. To engage and draw away Morris all on your own...
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 chevreuse 04.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' You're only a civilian and have never been trained to act in such a dangerous situation...
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 yoimiya 02.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Don't say it like that! As the director's assistant, it was my duty to help out the crew however I could. It was an honor to help you solve the case.
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 yoimiya 03.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' I have to admit though, my heart was thumping super hard the entire time I was laying on the ground. I was scared that everyone would notice, hehe.
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 chevreuse 05.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' You did great.
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 yoimiya 04.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Oh, and before I forget! If you ever visit Inazuma, please come and pay a visit to [[Naganohara Fireworks]]. I'll make some fireworks for you &mdash; I even know what shape I'd make!
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 chevreuse 06.ogg}} '''Chevreuse:''' I'm guessing... a musket?
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 yoimiya 05.ogg}} '''Yoimiya:''' Hehe, telling you now would ruin the surprise! If you really want to see it, just come and visit me!

:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 xavier 02.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Lady Furina, please allow me to take just one more photo of you! I would also love to get your autograph... just as a memento of our time together on the crew.
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Hey, I've had enough of the Kamera flashes from when we were all up on stage.
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 xavier 03.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' But... But Lady Furina, you are the best Director I've ever met! The most photogenic maiden in all of Fontaine! This kind of lively and celebratory setting is exactly where you shine. I believe all photographers would agree...
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 xavier 04.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Come, the brightest star of our land! Show us your light! The Kamera is waiting to sing praises of your beauty!
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Well I'm flattered, but... but...
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' *sigh* Alright, I'll humor you and try a few more different poses.
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But I don't have to hold the trophy, right?
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 xavier 05.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Ah... Ah! Of course! You may pose however you like!
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 xavier 06.ogg}} '''Xavier:''' Thank you so much, thank you so much! By the heavens, my luck has been beyond belief, I'm having a hard time coming to terms with it now...

::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 chiori 02a 5.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Thanks to you, we were also able to premiere the film in time. Its success has increased the reach of my brand.
::{{DIcon}} But we didn't really do anything...
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 chiori 02a 4.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' There's no need to be humble. You helped Xavier and Chevreuse, and even [[Kirara]]'s told me many good things about you. They are all my friends.
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 chiori 02a 6.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' You've done far more than what you give yourself credit for.
::;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About your work...
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 chiori 02b 1.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' I am merely a fashion designer. I don't have anything else I moonlight as.
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 chiori 02b 2.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' But when you run a business, it's inevitable that as you make more friends, you'll also encounter all sorts of thorny issues.
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 chiori 02b 3.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours. It's just the common sense of business.
::;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About the film...
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 chiori 02c 1.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Xavier's over the moon now that he's actually won the Furina Award. Maybe I'll actually find him in a fountain the next time I see him.
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 chiori 02c 2.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' The demand for couture at my Boutique has also increased... so much so that I don't have enough staff to handle it.
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 chiori 02c 3.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Looks like I'm one step closer to achieving my dream.
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 chiori 02c 4.ogg}} '''Chiori:''' Anyway, you will always be welcome at Chioriya Boutique. I would love to see you both again at the upcoming [[Fontaine Fashion Week]] as well.

:{{A|vo dyjeq005 8 ayato 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Oh, I didn't expect to meet you here.
:{{DIcon}} About your drink...
::{{A|vo dyjeq005 8 ayato 02a 1.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' I've been told that this is a beverage called "[[Fonta]]." I quite like its unique taste.
::{{A|vo dyjeq005 8 ayato 02a 2.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' The slogan, "A Font of Refreshment," is rather catchy as well. I'm starting to wonder if I could incorporate it into our cultural exchange initiative.
::{{A|vo dyjeq005 8 ayato 02a 3.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' What would happen if we were to add some sprigs of mint into Fonta? I believe this is an idea worth testing.
::{{A|vo dyjeq005 8 ayato 02a 4.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Or perhaps we could even take it one step further, and mix in an equal amount of Milk Tea Medley...
::{{A|vo dyjeq005 8 ayato 02a 5.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Hehe, but for some reason, I suspect that experiment wouldn't turn out well.
::;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} About the film...
::{{A|vo dyjeq005 8 ayato 02b 1.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Thanks to you, the film was successfully completed and the [[Yashiro Commission]] secured a collaboration project with the [[Palais Mermonia]].
::{{A|vo dyjeq005 8 ayato 02b 2.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' If another opportunity was to arise in the future, perhaps I should take on the chance to act as the protagonist.
::{{A|vo dyjeq005 8 ayato 02b 3.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayato:''' Or perhaps... you think the role of villain would fit me better?

===Kamisato Ayaka===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Kamisato Ayaka on the eastern platform overlooking the [[Icewind Suite]])
:{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I'm so glad we were able to complete the film. Thanks for taking care of me while I was here.
:{{DIcon}} Your acting was brilliant.
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 ayaka 02a 1.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Really? Thank you...
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 ayaka 02a 2.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' At first, I simply tried to work hard out of a desire to not become a burden to the crew. It would have been so embarrassing if the filming had to stop to accommodate my lack of skills.
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 ayaka 02a 3.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' But Director Furina was both patient and knowledgeable, and Chevreuse and [[Elain]] taught me a lot about the scenes and details. It was all thanks to their help that I was able to grow comfortable with the role.
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 ayaka 02a 4.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' And even with all of that said, I still... got a little flustered with praise, especially since everyone, including you, were complimenting me at the end...
::;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
:{{DIcon}} Did you have a good time?
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 ayaka 02b 1.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Yes, I visited many places with Yoimiya in between the filming sessions.
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 ayaka 02b 2.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' The elegant streets, the beautiful flowers and greenery, and the dreamlike underwater world... Everything I saw will shine like stars in my memories.
::{{A|vo dialog dyjeq005 ayaka 02b 3.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' It also brings me joy to think that perhaps you've marveled at those exact wonders as well.
