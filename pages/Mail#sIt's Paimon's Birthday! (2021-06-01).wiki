...You didn't forget, did you? No, of course you didn't! ...Right? Forgetting Paimon's Birthday is not allowed!

Paimon has been saving all sorts of delicious ingredients to use up on this extra-special day! First, Paimon sneaked off to buy some [[Flour]], then bought some [[Sugar]], and after that, Paimon gathered a whole bunch of [[Slime Condensate]]...

And now, to show your appreciation for the best guide ever and to celebrate us being together for so long...

It's time for you to go make Paimon a cake!

Hurry up, Paimon's hungry for slime-flavored birthday cake!
