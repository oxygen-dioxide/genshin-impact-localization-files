;(When the player defeats one of Kaveh's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card kaveh ingame easy 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Huh?

;(When the player defeats two of Kaveh's Character Cards)
:{{A|vo card kaveh ingame easy 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' *cough* N&mdash;Nothing, it's nothing...

;(When Kaveh defeats one of the player's Character Cards)

;(When Kaveh uses an Elemental Burst)
:{{A|vo card kaveh ingame easy 04.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' It's not over yet!

;(If the player wins the match)
:{{A|vo card kaveh invite easy 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I didn't even get to try out the tactics I'd planned on using... *sigh* Guess I'll have to save those for a rematch.

;(If the player loses the match)
:{{A|vo card kaveh invite easy 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Playing cards is one of my more minor pastimes &mdash; I guess a little experience goes a long way. What did you think? Not too bad, huh?

;(If the player wins the match)
:{{A|vo card kaveh invite hard 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Hmm, looks like this deck needs a bit of a rework. Question is... What exactly needs changing?

:{{A|vo card kaveh invite hard 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Well, how about that! I've put a lot of effort into tweaking this deck, and it looks like it paid off. I'd hope so too, after all the times I've asked people for advice...
