|-
|When the night is closing in<br>And you feel the darkness growing<br>Hope is fading every day<br>Deep in my heart<br>There is a fire glowing<br>Light the spark<br>And hear the engines roaring<br>Ride with me<br>Through the storm<br>Together we'll find a way
|-
|Let your flame burn brighter<br>Can't you see<br>It's now or never<br>This is our moment<br>Now is our time<br>So follow me to the finish line<br>Let your soul awaken<br>Destiny is what we make it<br>Ride with me<br>To victory<br><br>Let it burn
|-
|When your faith<br>Is shaken<br>Trust in me<br>That dawn is breaking<br>Head into the light<br>I'm here by your side<br>I never will let you go<br>Let your flame burn brighter<br>Stand with me<br>And be united<br>This is our moment<br>Now is our time<br>So follow me to the finish line<br>Let your soul awaken<br>Destiny is what we make it<br>Ride or die<br>Rise up, tonight
