==Description==
"A human is nothing more than a machine of a certain level of complexity."<br />Thus declared the youth from his lectern in the seedbed of wisdom. If one were to disassemble a part of this machine and make enhancements to it, Its performance could be greatly amplified.<br />With or without a Vision, and irrespective of their physique or combat skills, "Enhanced humans" would surely display strength far beyond the average.

Despite the risk of being denounced as a heretic and permanently cast from the circle of the wise,<br />The youth candidly jotted down these thoughts in the margins of his research notes:<br />I. As anticipated, no research breakthroughs are possible, given the working style of the Academia.<br />II. Nevertheless, being expelled would be a loss. One needs an environment conducive to research.

Following a trail of rumors of heresy, [[Pierro|the first of the Fatui]] tracked him down...

"Merely an enhanced human? If your great nation can furnish me with sufficient resources and allow ample time, I could manufacture even that which you would call a god. What say you?"<br />In the desert that shone bright like liquid gold, he inquired of the Snezhnayan diplomat:<br />"Will you treat me like the Academia did? Will you call me a monster, a madman?"<br />"Or will you treat me as my hometown did, and chase me away with pitchforks and clubs...?"

However...<br />"Good. Then, we are now in partnership."<br />"As for the matter of your title — what do you say to this..."<br />Taken completely by surprise by the sheer irony of the title he was given, the [[Dottore|young man]] burst into hysterical laughter.
