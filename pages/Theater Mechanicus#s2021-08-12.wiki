===Tutorial===

|-
|[[File:Tutorial Theater Mechanicus 2021-08-12 1.png|200px]]
|Increase Mechanicus Mastery to unlock new Mechanici and Wondrous Sticks.<br />All available Mechanici and Wondrous Sticks can be viewed from the Armory menu.
|-
|[[File:Tutorial Theater Mechanicus 2021-08-12 2.png|200px]]
|A single Stage of Theater Mechanicus can be challenged by up to two players at the same time. In Co-Op Stages, the max constructible Mechanici is a collective limit shared between all players. Each player still accrues and allocates a proportion of Veneficus Points individually.<br />Once the challenge starts, spend Veneficus Points to build various kinds of Mechanici at designated bases. Earn more Veneficus Points by defeating various monsters during the Stage. Some Mechanici will also refund Veneficus Points to the player when removed.
|-
|[[File:Tutorial Theater Mechanicus 2021-08-12 3.png|200px]]
|Some Mechanici may be rotated.<br />You can change the direction which these Mechanici face to affect opponents coming from different directions. Use this function to adapt to changing circumstances within the Stage.
|-
|[[File:Tutorial Theater Mechanicus 2021-08-12 4.png|200px]]
|Spend Veneficus Points to draw Wondrous Sticks. Of these, Fortune Sticks will provide various upgrades to your Mechanici, while Mystic Sticks will provide the player with various buffs.<br />Sticks have different rarities. In ascending order, those are Normal Sticks, Auspicious Sticks, and Affluent Sticks. The higher the rarity, the greater the buff that will be provided by the stick, but the higher the Veneficus Points cost to acquire it.<br />Certain Wondrous Sticks can be drawn multiple times to stack their effects.
|-
|[[File:Tutorial Theater Mechanicus 2021-08-12 5.png|200px]]
|Some Wondrous Stick cannot be drawn in certain stages.
|-
|[[File:Tutorial Theater Mechanicus 2021-08-12 6.png|200px]]
|Other than Fortune Sticks and Mystic Sticks, there are also Courage Sticks that will buff incoming opponents. In exchange, defeating these opponents will award more Veneficus Points.
|-
|[[File:Tutorial Theater Mechanicus 2021-08-12 7.png|200px]]
|Sometimes, players will draw Wondrous Sticks affected by Ominous Sticks. These Wondrous Sticks cost fewer Veneficus Points to acquire, but upon drawing them, players may experience all manner of unpredictable consequences.
|-
|[[File:Tutorial Theater Mechanicus 2021-08-12 8.png|200px]]
|After the Stage begins, a constant stream of opponents will start flooding the Stage from various directions. Players must use the Mechanici available to stop opponents from escaping the Stage. When an opponent escapes, your Terminus will lose Integrity.<br />Keep Terminus Integrity above 0 throughout the Stage to claim victory. If Terminus Integrity is depleted before the countdown ends, the challenge is failed.<br />Note that in Theater Mechanicus, characters are unable to deal DMG to opponents or regenerate Elemental Energy.
