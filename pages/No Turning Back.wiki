|zhsja_note = These are idioms referring to a desperate last stand with no chance of retreat, akin to English "burning one's boats." They originate from the account of the {{w|Battle of Jingxing}} in the ''{{w|Records of the Grand Historian}}'', in which {{w|Han Xin}}, general of the Han dynasty, won by arranging his troops with their backs against a river. This position was highly vulnerable but also very difficult for enemy forces to flank.
