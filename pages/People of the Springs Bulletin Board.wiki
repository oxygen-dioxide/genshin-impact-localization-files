===Koholasaurs===
:'''Notice:''' "Dear guests, remember not to provoke the [[Koholasaur]]s, whether young or mature, if you do not have any experience in communicating with them!"

:'''Notice:''' "Feeding them stimulating foods or trying to get close too early might scare them away, and they might either avoid you in the future or politely refuse contact."
:'''Notice:''' "And I'm sure you don't want to be thrown into the sea by one of them after they bop you with their heads, or have one of them grab you and pull you over to Chief [[Amina]]'s, right? So yes. Take your time, and don't rush it~"

:'''Hot Spring Notice:''' "Next up, no playing around in the hot springs. Not only will this disturb others, but you might also slip and fall."
:'''Hot Spring Notice:''' "Last of all, know your limits. Don't be afraid to step out should you feel uncomfortable, and don't forget to drink water and eat some food to keep your stamina up."
