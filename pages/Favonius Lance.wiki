==Description==
A spear of honor amongst the [[Knights of Favonius]]. It is used in a ceremonial role at parades and reviews, but it is also a keen and mortal foe of monsters.<br />
By studying the arbor that held firm in the wind, the craftsmen and scholars of [[Mondstadt]] would learn much of elemental affinities.<br />
This sturdy spear not only holds a place of special honor among the Knights &mdash; it is also a crystallization of the hard work and artistry of the city's defenders.<br />
With it in hand, they shall always remember to be disciplined, and to defend Mondstadt's freedom.

Indeed, many people have used polearms of a kind as their weapons, using the reach advantage to supplement their lack of martial skill.<br />
Even untrained plebeians could arm themselves with sharpened wooden sticks, and they would perhaps be a match for the steel of trained soldiers.<br />
To celebrate the overthrow of the aristocracy, long stakes, flagpoles and pitchforks were stuck all over the greenery around the city.

It was once required of all nobles to study the art of the sword, that they might grow in stature and wisdom.<br />
In those days, the art of the spear was reserved for foreign gladiators and traitors.<br />
But there was once a noble scion who wielded a spear.<br />
They said that [[Eberhart]] would enjoy the night breeze as he caught the first drops of dew with his spear tip.

An illegitimate child, Eberhart dreamed of recapturing the glory and pride of ancient nobility.<br />
Yet, he needed greater power in order to destroy these rotten foundations. So&mdash;<br />
Whether it was instigate [[Parsifal|his legitimate brother]] to pursue his dream of becoming a phantom thief, before deceiving him and forcing him to flee,<br />
So that he might usurp that legitimacy,<br />
Or whether it was pledging himself as a certain [[Blue-Eyed Spear Witch|spear-wielding witch]]'s disciple to learn the fatal loophole in her art,<br />
All the better to slay her with...

"So what if those who came after should despise me? I will do anything to achieve my goals."
