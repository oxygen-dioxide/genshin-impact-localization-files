The '''Fatui''' are a delegation of diplomats from the [[Zapolyarny Palace]] of [[Snezhnaya]]. There is also a military detachment led by the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]] and the [[Tsaritsa]] herself. They are one of the main antagonistic factions in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' and the main antagonists in the official supplementary [[manga]].

A single member of the Fatui is called a '''Fatuus'''.

==Description==
The Fatui are a powerful military force in terms of power and numbers, making it the strongest of all the seven nations. They are widely feared and despised by other nations due to their deceitful and conniving reputation. The organization is composed of members performing a variety of roles, including combatants, bureaucrats, politicians, and merchants.

Hailing from the frozen lands of Snezhnaya, the Fatui are publicly seen as a political department of the nation that represents the goodwill of the Tsaritsa and manages foreign affairs with all six other nations. However, despite how they initially present themselves, the citizens and governments of those nations are often already aware of their true colors, and treat both their diplomats and individual members of the organization with distrust.

They often use underhanded methods to establish their power and influence in another nation, and as a whole are willing to go to extremes to further the Tsaritsa's vision for a "perfect world." Deception, extortion,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Bookworm Swordsman}}</ref> and human experimentation are but some of the tactics they employ to bolster their own strength.

Despite their loyalty to their empress, most of the Fatui grunts themselves are unaware of the Tsaritsa's true plans. The Harbingers are likely some of the few among the ranks who are truly aware of the Tsaritsa's true intentions, as they are the ones assisting her in collecting [[Gnosis|Gnoses]].

The Fatui are divided into divisions, each of which is headed by one of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers. Each Harbinger operates with a different modus operandi which also influences how their underlings act.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Shuumatsuban Operations}}</ref> There is often a lack of thorough communication between fellow Harbingers,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Defender of Childhood Dreams}}</ref> Harbingers and their subordinates, as well as between different divisions of Fatui operatives.<ref name="Equivalent Exchange">{{Ref/Quest|Equivalent Exchange}}</ref> However, some members of the Fatui are quite loyal to their leading Harbinger, to the point of being willing to seek revenge for their sake.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|New Beginning}}</ref>

The Fatui come from a variety of backgrounds: some were taken in at the [[House of the Hearth]] orphanage<ref name="The Replacement's Secret">{{Ref/Quest|The Replacement's Secret}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lost in a Foreign Land: Seeking}}</ref> while others consciously choose to join their ranks. They also do not hesitate to help financially and diplomatically strategic allies in order to interfere in foreign policy.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Foregone Conclusion}}</ref>

They receive certain advantages in exchange for their services, such as supplies, salaries, or powerful weapons<ref>Archive: [[Fatui Skirmisher - Electrohammer Vanguard]]</ref>; in exchange for this, however, they choose neither the destination to which they are sent, nor the superiors to whom they obey.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Tales of Winter}}</ref>

Many of the Fatui NPCs in the game are everyday workers who are oblivious to their superiors' true intentions, but are nevertheless very loyal to the Tsaritsa and Snezhnaya. Members have differing opinions on being stationed in other nations, ranging from intense homesickness<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Vlad}}</ref> to having developed fondness for their new home.<ref name="Andrei">{{Ref/NPC|Andrei}}</ref>

===In Mondstadt===
So far, the Fatui's tactic to increase their influence in [[Mondstadt]] has been to incite or take advantage of disturbances to offer their assistance in a way that puts the [[Knights of Favonius]] in an awkward position. For example, they provoked [[Ursa the Drake]] into attacking the city so that [[Il Dottore]] could defeat it (later attempting a similar setup during Ludi Harpastum),<ref>Manga, Chapter 12: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/manga/detail/1486 Unshrouded Resolution]</ref> and one of their diplomats pressured [[Jean]] to allow them to kill [[Dvalin]] after the Stormterror attack.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Shadow Over Mondstadt}}</ref> Later during the Stormterror conflict, agents stole the [[Holy Lyre der Himmel]], though it was soon retrieved. A delegation of diplomats is currently residing in the [[Goth Grand Hotel]], though they are apparently under lockdown.<ref name="Equivalent Exchange" /> During [[Eula]]'s [[Aphros Delos Chapter|Story Quest]], it is revealed that they were colluding with [[Schubert|Schubert Lawrence]] to invade Mondstadt, promising to help him establish the [[Lawrence Clan]] as the rulers of the city once again.<ref name="TTMTTH">{{Ref/Quest|Through the Motions, to the Heart}}</ref>

The Fatui were presumably the ones who gave [[Crepus]] his Delusion, and were the ones who lured Ursa the Drake to his carriage, eventually leading to his death.

They are also competing with [[Diluc]] to find a vial that contains the [[Barbatos|Anemo Archon]]'s breath, which was stolen six months before the events of the game from one of the Temples of the Four Winds. Due to the amount of counterfeits that have flooded the market since, both the Fatui and Diluc are yet to find the real one, though Diluc has been buying every counterfeit he can find just in case.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|State of the Holy Lyre der Himmel}}</ref>

===In Liyue===
The Fatui used to have some kind of diplomatic immunity in [[Liyue Harbor]] (and an embassy),<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Gentry De'an}}</ref> and have been investing in the local economy through the [[Northland Bank]], though the [[Liyue Qixing]] are wary of them. The Northland Bank is an arm of the Fatui "with some exceptions"<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Endless Smoke}}</ref> despite their receptionist [[Ekaterina]] denying this, being a national bank founded in Snezhnaya that has opened a branch in [[Liyue Harbor]]. The Harbingers are important clients of the bank, and the Fatui's Debt Collection division, of which [[Fatui Pyro Agent]]s are a part, seem to assist the bank in tracking down debtors.<ref>YouTube:  [https://youtu.be/ZF4KyX0ASnI Character Tales: "Childe: Sigil of Permission"]</ref>

Shortly after [[The Chasm]] shut down, Signora had negotiated with the Qixing to allow a group of Fatui to enter to combat the mysterious sludge with an experimental device, but the device exploded and the Fatui became scattered across the mines. The Ninth Company, a group of 64 soldiers, suffered immense casualties that half of the men were assumed dead and the other missing, forcing [[Anton]] to assume command over the few remaining soldiers. Another Fatui, [[Katarina]], was stationed in the Chasm to look for her brother, Kolya, sustaining herself through the supply line that had been established inside. Due to the isolation in the Chasm, these Fatui were initially unaware of news from the surface.

Fatui soldiers assisted [[Tartaglia|Childe]] after he summoned the [[Osial|Overlord of the Vortex]], fighting against the Traveler, [[Keqing]], and the [[Millelith]] on the Jade Chamber. This in turn caused the remaining Fatui in Liyue to be looked down upon with suspicion and those stationed in the Chasm were promptly abandoned and labeled hostile by the Millelith.

They have ties to [[Wangsheng Funeral Parlor]],<ref>{{Ref/Quest|An Organization Known as Wangsheng}}</ref> the exact nature of which are unclear.

While relations have since been soured since Childe's actions, the Fatui are still interested in Liyue &mdash; upon learning that [[Uncle Tian]] had wanted to step down, they colluded with one of his disciples, [[Zhiyi]], to assassinate and replace him so they could have some influence in the Liyue Qixing. Fortunately, this plot was foiled by [[Yelan]], who had been investigating Zhiyi, with [[Pantalone]] treating the issue as a peripheral concern.

===In Inazuma===
The Fatui were the masterminds behind the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] in [[Inazuma]], and fanned the flames of conflict on both sides of the civil war. They colluded with the [[Tenryou Commission|Tenryou]] and [[Kanjou Commission|Kanjou]] Commissions to feed the [[Raiden Shogun]] false information<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Blind Loyalty, Reckless Courage}}</ref> and gather materials for their [[Delusion Factory]] respectively, secretly distributed [[Delusion]]s among the [[Watatsumi Army|Watatsumi resistance forces]], and planted spies throughout the country in various efforts to destabilize both Watatsumi and the Shogunate and render them vulnerable to Fatui influence and control.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Delusion (Quest)}}</ref><ref name="Clean House">{{Ref/Quest|Clean House}}</ref> After the Vision Hunt Decree was abolished and the civil war ended, the bulk of the Fatui's forces retreated; a few remained behind for various reasons, such as avenging Signora, recruiting disgruntled Shogunate soldiers to their cause as living test subjects<ref name="Clean House" /> or continue their work as spies to re-ignite the war.<ref name="The Replacement's Secret" />

The Fatui also caused the Tatarasuna Incident by sabotaging the [[Mikage Furnace]] as part of Pierro's plan to lay the groundwork for a future endeavor in Inazuma; while unconfirmed, it was most likely the prelude to the Vision Hunt Decree plot.

===In Sumeru===
Some of the Fatui were tasked by [[Il Dottore]] to catch the [[Aranara]] by trapping children to lure them out, although such measures failed due to the race's apparent invisibility and powers.

Aware that the Akademiya sages desired to have a god once more to replace [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] (as they saw [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] as nonexistent), they collaborated with Dottore to create a new god, harvesting divine knowledge from scholars who had gone insane and powering the Akasha by trapping the people of Sumeru City in a samsara. They would then pour these resources into [[Scaramouche]], who was in the process of becoming a god.

Scaramouche was eventually defeated but reformed and eventually removed himself from [[Irminsul]]. It is not known how the Fatui would be affected by this change, although it is known that his former seat had been left empty for years and the Tatarasuna Incident was revised.

Other Fatui were sent into the [[Great Red Sand]] in the hopes of seeking the Eternal Oasis that the [[The Eremites|Eremites]] had spoken of. The [[Tanit]] were one of the tribes approached by the Fatui, who helped Matriarch [[Babel]] obtain her position. However, she soon came to regret working with them and subsequently barred them from entering her tribe's lands. Professor [[Froderock Fronkonsteen]] had also tasked the Fatui with finding "live specimens" for him in the desert.

==Members==
===Leaders===
====Tsaritsa====
{{Main|Tsaritsa}}
The Tsaritsa is the Cryo Archon and the Archon presiding over Snezhnaya. The Fatui Harbingers carry out her plans to seize authority from the gods, though her motivations for doing this are still shrouded in mystery.

====Eleven Fatui Harbingers====
{{Main|Eleven Fatui Harbingers}}
The '''Eleven Fatui Harbingers''' are the executive officers of the organization, being under only the Tsaritsa herself. They are given absolute executive authority by her and answer directly to her. They are blessed with powers that exceed those of an average human, but those powers do not seem to be derived from their [[Vision]]s. Instead, the Harbingers all possess a [[Delusion]], which are said to be even more powerful. Those among the Fatui who have proven themselves in their strength are chosen by one of them to serve as direct subordinates. Each Harbinger goes by a code name instead of their real names and leads their own division within the Fatui. Currently, the only known such division is the Debt Collection division.

====Ninth Company====
{{See also|A Company Vanishing Into the Deep}}
This company was dispatched by [[Pulcinella]] to [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]] to investigate its recent strange phenomena as part of an agreement between [[Snezhnaya]] and the [[Liyue Qixing]]. After [[Tartaglia]]'s actions in [[Liyue Harbor]], this arrangement was nullified and the supply chains were cut off, but the company stayed, unaware of the events at the surface.

The company originally contained 64 members, but Anton estimates that half of the soldiers have gone missing or died to accidents within the Chasm.

==Trivia==
* The word "{{wt|fatuus|Fatui|Noun}}" is Latin for "Fools."
** In Italian, its meaning is "someone who works hard, but fruitlessly."
* In English, "{{wt|fatuus|Fatuus|Noun}}" &mdash; the singular form of the Latin word ''fatui'' &mdash; is sometimes used to refer to a singular member of the Fatui.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Vortex's Wake|note=Quest Description|quote=After your chance meeting with Zhongli, you learn that a Fatuus named Kliment is trying to organize an archaeological expedition.}}</ref> The English word "fatuous," used in the name of the ''[[Fatuous Farce]]'' weekly Reputation Quests, is also derived from Latin ''fatuus''.
** In Japanese, however, {{ja|ファトゥス|Fatusu}} refers specifically to members of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Chasing Shadows|note=Japanese|quote={{ja|モンドには…オレらの「{{Rubi|執行官|ファトゥス}}」がいる！}}}}</ref>
** In Chinese and Korean, the word sometimes used to refer to a singular member {{zh|愚人|rm=yúrén}}/{{ko|{{Rubi|愚|우|人|인}}|rm=u'in}} means "Fool."
* Diluc is a member of an underground intelligence network based in the north which, amongst its various activities, keeps tabs on the Fatui and previously intervened in the Harbingers' attempt to kill Diluc during his years away from Mondstadt.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Diluc|4}}</ref> He remained a member after returning to Mondstadt and has used its intelligence network to track the activities of both the Fatui and the Abyss Order.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Abyss Mage (Quest)}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|All's Well That Ends Well (Quest)}}</ref>
