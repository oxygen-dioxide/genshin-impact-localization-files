The '''Fatui''' also called the '''Warriors of the Pale Star''' are a delegation of diplomats from the [[Zapolyarny Palace]] of [[Snezhnaya]]. There is also a military detachment led by the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]] and the [[Tsaritsa]] herself. They are one of the two main antagonistic factions alongside the [[Abyss Order]] in ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' and the main antagonists in the official supplementary [[manga]].

A singular member of the Fatui is called a '''Fatuus'''.

==Description==
The Fatui are a powerful military force in terms of power and numbers, making it the strongest of all the [[Teyvat|seven nations]]. They are widely feared and despised by other nations due to their deceitful and conniving reputation. The organization is composed of members performing a variety of roles, including combatants, bureaucrats, politicians, and merchants.

Hailing from the frozen lands of Snezhnaya, the Fatui are publicly seen as a political department of the nation that represents the goodwill of the Tsaritsa and manages foreign affairs with all six other nations. However, despite how they initially present themselves, the citizens and governments of those nations are often already aware of their true colors, and treat both their diplomats and individual members of the organization with distrust.

They often use underhanded methods to establish their power and influence in another nation, and as a whole are willing to go to extremes to further the Tsaritsa's vision for a "perfect world." Deception, extortion,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Bookworm Swordsman}}</ref> and human experimentation are but some of the tactics they employ to bolster their own strength.

Despite their loyalty to their empress, most of the Fatui grunts themselves are unaware of the Tsaritsa's true plans. The Harbingers are likely some of the few among the ranks who are truly aware of the Tsaritsa's true intentions, as they are the ones assisting her in collecting [[Gnoses]].

The Fatui are divided into divisions, each of which is headed by one of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers. Each Harbinger operates with a different modus operandi which also influences how their underlings act.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Shuumatsuban Operations}}</ref> There is often a lack of thorough communication between fellow Harbingers,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Defender of Childhood Dreams}}</ref> Harbingers and their subordinates, as well as between different divisions of Fatui operatives.<ref name="Equivalent Exchange">{{Ref/Quest|Equivalent Exchange}}</ref> However, some members of the Fatui are quite loyal to their leading Harbinger, to the point of being willing to seek revenge for their sake.<ref name="New Beginning">{{Ref/Quest|New Beginning}}</ref>

The Fatui come from a variety of backgrounds: some were taken in at the [[House of the Hearth]] orphanage,<ref name="The Replacement's Secret">{{Ref/Quest|The Replacement's Secret}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lost in a Foreign Land: Seeking}}</ref> others choose to join their ranks, while others, like [[Childe]], can be enlisted by their parents. They also do not hesitate to help financially and diplomatically strategic allies in order to interfere in foreign policy.<ref name="Foregone Conclusion">{{Ref/Quest|Foregone Conclusion}}</ref>

They receive certain advantages in exchange for their services, such as supplies, salaries, or powerful weapons;<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Fatui Skirmisher - Electrohammer Vanguard}}</ref> in exchange for this, however, they choose neither the destination to which they are sent, nor the superiors to whom they obey.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Tales of Winter}}</ref>

Many of the Fatui [[NPC]]s in the game are everyday workers who are oblivious to their superiors' true intentions, but are nevertheless very loyal to the Tsaritsa and Snezhnaya. Members have differing opinions on being stationed in other nations, ranging from intense homesickness<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Vlad}}</ref> to having developed fondness for their new home.<ref name="Andrei">{{Ref/NPC|Andrei}}</ref>

===In Mondstadt===
So far, the Fatui's tactic to increase their influence in [[Mondstadt]] has been to incite or take advantage of disturbances to offer their assistance in a way that puts the [[Knights of Favonius]] in an awkward position. For example, they provoked [[Ursa the Drake]] into attacking the city so that [[Il Dottore]] could defeat it (later attempting a similar setup during [[Ludi Harpastum]]),<ref>Manga, Chapter 12: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/manga/detail/1486 Unshrouded Resolution]</ref> and one of their diplomats pressured [[Jean]] to allow them to kill [[Dvalin]] after the Stormterror attack.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Shadow Over Mondstadt}}</ref> Later during the Stormterror conflict, agents stole the [[Holy Lyre der Himmel]], though it was soon recovered. A delegation of diplomats is currently residing in the [[Goth Grand Hotel]], though they are apparently under lockdown.<ref name="Equivalent Exchange" /> During [[Eula]]'s [[Aphros Delos Chapter|Story Quest]], it is revealed that some members were colluding with [[Schubert|Schubert Lawrence]] to invade Mondstadt, promising to help him establish the [[Lawrence Clan]] as the rulers of the city once again, though this plot was quickly foiled by the Knights of Favonius.<ref name="TTMTTH">{{Ref/Quest|Through the Motions, to the Heart}}</ref>

The Fatui were presumably the ones who gave [[Crepus]] his [[Delusion]], and were the ones who lured Ursa the Drake to his carriage, eventually leading to his death. They are also competing with [[Diluc]] to find a vial that contains the [[Barbatos|Anemo Archon]]'s breath, which was stolen six months prior to the events of the game from one of the Temples of the Four Winds. Due to the amount of counterfeits that have flooded the market since, both the Fatui and Diluc have yet to find the real one, though Diluc has been purchasing every counterfeit he can find just in case.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|State of the Holy Lyre der Himmel}}</ref>

The Fatui also have plans involving the heart of the deceased [[Abyss]]al [[dragon]], [[Durin]], in [[Dragonspine]], though the [[Traveler]] ends up interfering when they arrive.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Festering Fang}}</ref>

===In Liyue===
The Fatui used to have some kind of diplomatic immunity in [[Liyue Harbor]] (and an embassy),<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Gentry De'an}}</ref> and have been investing in the local economy through the [[Northland Bank]], though the [[Liyue Qixing]] are wary of them. The Northland Bank is an arm of the Fatui "with some exceptions"<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Endless Smoke}}</ref> despite their receptionist [[Ekaterina]] denying this, being a national bank founded in Snezhnaya that has opened a branch in Liyue Harbor. The Harbingers are important clients of the bank, and the Fatui's Debt Collection division, of which [[Fatui Pyro Agent]]s are a part, seem to assist the bank in tracking down debtors.<ref>YouTube:  [https://youtu.be/ZF4KyX0ASnI Character Tales: "Childe: Sigil of Permission"]</ref> The Fatui also have ties to [[Wangsheng Funeral Parlor]],<ref>{{Ref/Quest|An Organization Known as Wangsheng}}</ref> the exact nature of which are unclear.

A Fatuus agent named [[Javert]] would make contact with [[Gentry Maocai]] in order to obtain large amounts of [[Cor Lapis]], giving him some thugs to help force merchants into selling their stockpile lower than the market price. Gentry would later attempt to strongarm [[Chang the Ninth]] of his stockpile, but the Traveler and [[Xingqiu]] put a stop to Gentry's antics. Javert, realizing that he was outmatched and that Maocai wouldn't honor the contract, left, threatening the merchant of the payment. Gentry would be forced to buy the stockpile at triple the market price and likely delivered the needed materials to Javert afterwards.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Bookworm Swordsman}}</ref>

Shortly after [[The Chasm (Subregion)|The Chasm]] shut down due to a series of mysterious incidents, the Harbinger [[Signora]] had negotiated with the [[Liyue Qixing|Qixing]] to allow the Fatui's Ninth Company to enter the underground mines to cleanse the [[Dark Mud|mysterious sludge]] in the mines with an experimental device. The Fatui would investigate The Chasm, while the [[Millelith]] would deliver supplies and orders. However, the device exploded and the Fatui became scattered across the mines. The Ninth Company, a group of 64 soldiers, suffered such immense casualties from this that half of the men are assumed dead or missing including the company captain, forcing Staff Sergeant [[Anton]] to assume command, although not everyone has listened to him. By the time the Traveler discovers them, Anton has three soldiers remaining under his command. Begging them for help, Anton and his men learn what happened and decide to retreat.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Company Vanishing Into the Deep}}</ref> 

Fatui soldiers assisted [[Tartaglia|Childe]] after he summoned the [[Osial|Overlord of the Vortex]] in order to draw out [[Rex Lapis]], fighting against the [[Traveler]], [[Keqing]], and the [[Millelith]] on the [[Jade Chamber]]. Since this was effectively abetting a plot to destroy Liyue Harbor, this caused the remaining Fatui in Liyue to be looked down upon with suspicion and the Ninth Company in the Chasm was promptly abandoned and declared criminals by the Millelith, having lost all communication with the surface and desperately running low on rations, with some scattered groups bartering with [[Treasure Hoarders]] in the region for food.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Undetected Infiltration}}</ref> [[Katarina]] is another notable Fatuus, having remained in the underground mines to search for her brother, who was separated from her.

While relations have soured since Childe's actions, the Fatui still has a delegation in Liyue and is still interested in the nation's politics &mdash; upon learning that [[Uncle Tian]] had wanted to step down from the Liyue Qixing, they colluded with one of his disciples, [[Zhiyi]], to assassinate and replace him so they could have influence over the Liyue Qixing. Fortunately, this plot was foiled by [[Yelan]], who had been investigating Zhiyi, although the Harbinger [[Pantalone]] (who was monitoring Liyue's situation) managed to minimize the Liyue Qixing's advantage over the Fatui.<ref name="Foregone Conclusion" />

===In Inazuma===
The Fatui were the masterminds behind the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] in [[Inazuma]], and fanned the flames of conflict on both sides of the Inazuman civil war. They colluded with the [[Tenryou Commission|Tenryou]] and [[Kanjou Commission]]s to feed the [[Raiden Shogun]] false information<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Blind Loyalty, Reckless Courage}}</ref> and gather materials for their [[Delusion Factory]] respectively, secretly distributed [[Delusion]]s among the [[Watatsumi Army|Watatsumi resistance forces]], and planted spies throughout the country in various efforts to destabilize both Watatsumi and the [[Inazuma Shogunate|Shogunate]] and render them vulnerable to Fatui influence.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Delusion (Quest)}}</ref><ref name="Clean House">{{Ref/Quest|Clean House}}</ref> They caused the [[Tatarasuna Mystery|Tatarasuna Incident]] by sabotaging the [[Mikage Furnace]] as part of [[Pierro]]'s plan to lay the groundwork for a future endeavor in Inazuma; while unconfirmed, it was most likely the prelude to the Vision Hunt Decree plot. They were also responsible for the [[Tatarigami]] outbreak on [[Yashiori Island]], as [[Nathan|a Fatui infiltrator]] convinced members of the Watatsumi Army to destroy the wards on Yashiori Island.<ref name="Clean House" /><ref>Interactable: [[Narukami Pillar#Waterlogged Note|Waterlogged Note]]</ref>

Upon revealing the truth to the Raiden Shogun and demanding a duel before the throne, the Traveler prevails against Signora; as a consequence of losing the duel, the Shogun executed Signora with the [[Musou no Hitotachi]]. The Traveler later spends time with Ei after revealing that her Vision Hunt Decree was wrong, ending the civil war. She discovers the Fatui's involvement in Inazuma's policies and expels them as a friendly party.

[[Capitano]] dispatched Naval Warrant Officer [[Borenka]] to cover up the Fatui's involvement in the Yashiori Island disaster by recovering the infiltrator's report and extracting any Inazuman recruits to be silenced. However, he and his group were defeated by the Traveler and [[Shizuru]], who retrieved the report for Watatsumi.<ref name="Clean House" /> Some of Signora's subordinates have stayed behind to avenge her, seeking to disrupt the peace treaty between the Shogunate and Watatsumi, though they were unsuccessful.<ref name="New Beginning" /> Another group from the House of the Hearth, led by [[Efim Snezhevich]], also planned to reignite the civil war by poisoning Watatsumi Island; Efim believes this would raise the prestige of their patron, the Harbinger [[Arlecchino]],<ref name="The Replacement's Secret" /> though it is later revealed that he had broken off with unsuspecting subordinates to advance the [[Crucabena|previous Knave]]'s directives. This plan was disrupted by the defection of [[Lyudochka Snezhevna]], and the [[Shuumatsuban]] is working to root out Efim's remaining associates.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Momoyo|s=3|condition=after completion of ''[[The Very Special Fortune Slip]]''}}</ref>

===In Sumeru===
Fatui involvement in [[Sumeru]] has largely been from the Harbinger [[Il Dottore]]'s projects. They collaborated with the sages of [[Sumeru Akademiya]] to replace [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] with a new [[god]] of wisdom. Dottore was aware that the sages did not acknowledge Kusanali as a successor to [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]], and he was intrigued by the possibility of creating an artificial god. He set up an experiment to turn the Harbinger [[Scaramouche]] into Sumeru's new god using the [[Electro]] Gnosis (previously acquired by Scaramouche). They successfully turned Scaramouche into the god [[Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom|Shouki no Kami, the Prodigal]], though he was soon defeated and Lesser Lord Kusanali was restored as the deity of Sumeru. In the aftermath, Dottore recovered the Electro and [[Dendro]] Gnoses for the Tsaritsa via a deal with Lesser Lord Kusanali: the deletion of all his other Segments, as well as an exchange of information.

Following these events, Lesser Lord Kusanali took Scaramouche under her wing. Upon learning the truth and scale of Dottore's machinations, he broke off from the Fatui and attempted to erase himself from [[Irminsul]], though this attempt was unsuccessful. Upon restoring his memories via a backup that Kusanali had made to resist tampering, Scaramouche abandoned his name and the Fatui. As an effect of tampering with Irminsul, Scaramouche's seat would remain unoccupied for hundreds of years, with any further effects being unknown.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As Though Morning Dew}}</ref>

Another of Il Dottore's projects involves weaponizing dreams and [[The Withering]], and many of Dottore's subordinates in [[Dharma Forest]] have been tasked with aiding the project. Dottore is particularly interested in the [[Aranara]], who possess the power to manipulate dreams, and his subordinates have been ordered to catch the Aranara for study. With the help of an [[Trofin Snezhevich|infiltrator]] they have been trapping children from [[Vimara Village]] to lure out the Aranara, though such measures have consistently failed due to the Aranara's innate properties.<ref>{{Ref/HEO|The Bad Guy in Vimara Village}}</ref> A related team led by [[Oleg]] set up research camps across the forest using machines with the goal of extracting energy from Withering Zones. However, the machines were not actually intended for that use and they had been tricked into using them by [[Kasim]], a con artist. Oleg's team was eventually arrested by the [[Corps of Thirty]] and their machines were disabled.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Foolish Fatuus}}</ref>

Under the guise of the [[Nilotpala Cup Beast Tamers Tournament]], another Fatuus named [[Elchingen]] would collaborate with dubious scholars from the [[Sumeru Akademiya]], creating the Wisdom Orb in order to convince people to domesticate fungus for the tournament. The orb was also programmed to force control of the fungus, in the hopes that Elchingen could overthrow Sumeru with his army of fungus. The plot was foiled by the Traveler, Miko, Layla, Haniyyah and the Sumeran authorities. An unknown Fatui commander, deeming Elchingen to be too troublesome, ordered an agent named [[Yurochka]] to kill him, which he successfully did.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Fabulous Fungus Frenzy}}</ref>

The Fatui are also active throughout the [[Great Red Sand]]. They have been collaborating with [[Thutmose]], an [[The Eremites|Eremite]] faction, in order to explore the ruins of [[King Deshret]]'s civilization.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Secret of Al-Ahmar}}</ref> Separately, the Fatui Desert Expedition Investigation Team was sent to the [[Desert of Hadramaveth]] to study the desert tribes<ref name="Rejoice">{{Ref/Quest|Rejoice With Me, for What Was Lost Is Now Found}}</ref> and explore the [[The Orchard of Pairidaeza|Eternal Oasis]], striking a deal with the [[Tanit]] tribe for aid. However, they were betrayed by Matriarch [[Babel]], putting their efforts at a standstill. When Babel ordered [[Jeht]] to eliminate the Traveler, she refused the order, prompting her to lay a trap with the Fatui to eliminate her. The Fatui successfully caught her, but were terrified of her tenacity. Likewise, she told the Traveler of her "betrayal", hoping that one of them would kill the other, but the plan was foiled and the two destroyed the team.

Some Fatui were also sent to the [[Girdle of the Sands]] for reasons unknown, with one officer, [[Markozov]], seeking the [[Pari]] for unknown reasons related to knowledge, though [[Sosi]] believes that they were coveting the power of the gods. Markozov's group was driven off by the Traveler.

===In Fontaine===
The Harbinger Arlecchino is the Father of the House of Hearth in [[Fontaine]], and as such she is concerned by a [[Prophecy of Fontaine|prophecy]] claiming that the people of Fontaine will one day dissolve into the water of the [[Primordial Sea]], leaving only the [[The Seven|Archon]] [[Focalors]] to weep. Arlecchino and her operatives under the House of the Hearth were in Fontaine for the supposed reason of stopping the prophecy from occurring. Tartaglia was also sent to Fontaine to assist the Northland Bank branch there, but was (falsely) accused of being the perpetrator behind a series of mysterious disappearances. Though he was proven innocent, the [[Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale]] still declared him guilty, and he was sentenced to the [[Fortress of Meropide]]. Arlecchino sent several of her agents to infiltrate Meropide and gather intel, though many of them were captured by [[Wriothesley]]. She also took it to herself to investigate the true identity of the Hydro Archon.

The Fatui are also involved in other operations throughout the nation. [[Henri]] was hired by the Fatui to collect parts from the [[Fontaine Research Institute]] for them, and was misled into extracting the [[Mysterious Core|cores]] of seven water quality monitor devices, being told they were polluting the water. The Traveler helped him, not knowing he was hired by the Fatui. However, Henri's [["Boss"|boss]] was ultimately captured by [[Hunter]] and [[Turner]], who revealed Henri had been tricked.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Still Mouthwatering!}}</ref>

The 34th Independent Investigative Squad was deployed to [[Mont Esus East]], and took over several hydrological monitoring stations once used by the Fontaine Research Institute, claiming the [[Maison Gestion]] gave them permission. In truth, they were only pretending to work, as the squad (including its captain [[Malinovskyi]]) simply wanted to slack off but were being monitored by the deputy captain, [[Shumilov]], who they did not like. In the end they were chased off by the Traveler, who was helping the researcher [[Broglie]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|In Search of Lost Time}}</ref>

Following an explosion at the [[Fontaine Research Institute]], Arlecchino sent several of her [[Fatui Operative]]s to investigate the matter. It is also implied that they entered a partnership with [[Edwin Eastinghouse]] and [[Nacker]] regarding [[Arkhium]], as a Wind Operative can be found in Nacker's former laboratory in the [[Morte Region]] following his capture.

Upon learning of some ancient ruins near [[Poisson]], Arlecchino had sent a group out to explore it, but they soon learned of the Poisson disaster and devoted their resources to helping the people out, such as performing headcounts and monitoring water levels. When [[Lyney]], [[Lynette]] and [[Freminet]] learned of the Traveler and [[Neuvillette]]'s plan to "trap" Furina so she could admit her secrets, Lyney had the Fatui help him in replicating a larger-scale version of the trick he initially performed at the [[Opera Epiclese]], who created a false house and made a tunnel from Poisson all the way to the opera house. They also assisted Freminet in finding a missing stone slate that the Traveler, Neuvillette and [[Navia]] had come upon while investigating the ruins.

When the prophecy passed, Neuvillette gave Arlecchino the Hydro Gnosis as a "diplomatic gift", as both Arlecchino and Tartaglia provided invaluable assistance to the people of Fontaine and that he wanted to dispose of it after [[Skirk]]'s urging. Arlecchino's role in acquiring the Gnosis would result in Pulcinella and Pantalone placing her and her organization in the spotlight of [[Project Stuzha]], however she and her members suspected their sudden thrust into the spotlight was meant to keep them in check.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Sea Breeze Rendezvous}}</ref>

The forces of another Harbinger (likely [[Sandrone]]) worked with a civilian named [[Jenck]] to steal [[Sir Arthur]] to help him take over [[The Steambird]] in return for finding [[Mosso Lombroso]]'s inheritance and research in machine intelligence. The collaboration ended when Jenck destroyed [["Curve"]], a lie-detecting [[Clockwork Meka]] created by Lombroso, and most of his research to avoid capture, so the Harbinger had him punished accordingly by breaking his mind and ripping his tongue out, leaving a letter apologizing to the Traveler, [[Paimon]] and [[Talochard]]. The Harbinger's subordinates were ordered to recover Curve's remains afterwards before anyone could act.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Questioning Melusine and Answering Machine}}</ref>

After giving the Gnosis to the Tsaritsa, Arlecchino returned to Fontaine and had a meeting with Neuvillette, where she gave him a proposal of her own. While he was initially hesitant to accept at first, upon learning the entire deal, he accepted the offer. Arlecchino proposed to him that there were members from the House who wanted to leave, but did not want to be targeted due to their secrets. In return for having their memories of the House erased and allowing them to live normal lives in Fontaine, Arlecchino would withdraw the majority of her forces from Fontaine and would not carry out any "special missions" in the nation unless absolutely necessary.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Birds in a Cage}}</ref>

A newly certified agent would later arrive at [[Petrichor]] in order to collect a debt from [[Giulietta]], who had defaulted on a debt regarding flute-making materials. When they arrived, another Fontanian, [[Giustino]], hired them to bring him back to Petrichor, though upon arriving, the agent ambushed him, believing him to be the person owing the debt. After being beaten by the Traveler, the agent, who had been too enthusiastic with his first job, realized that he had targeted wrong person, as his main target was now in Bayda Harbor. He quickly left in a hurry in order to pursue her and collect the debt.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Latecoming Homecoming}}</ref>

===In Natlan===
During [[Varka]]'s expedition with the veteran members of the [[Knights of Favonius]], they ran into [[Il Capitano]] and his subordinates, who were heading to [[Natlan]]. They eventually arrived, and Neuvillette states that Il Capitano had "thrown himself" into the nation's endless "wars". Capitano later confronted the [[Pyro Archon]], [[Mavuika]], over her indecision and failure to fulfill the oath made 500 years ago. In the ensuing duel, Mavuika managed to injure Capitano, who was able to retreat due to [[Ororon]]'s assistance. Acknowledging his defeat to her and learning that she had spent her powers fighting him, he refrained from stealing the Gnosis and informed the Tsaritsa that he would abandon his task, which she accepted.

Groups of Fatui were also sent across Natlan's plains. A group of Fatui were stationed in [[Coatepec Mountain]], capturing the local [[Saurian]]s under Capitano's orders to experiment on them regarding [[Phlogiston]]. The "[[Polychrome Tri-Stars]]," a trio of prominent Fatui footsoldiers, were also sent to assist in maintaining the machine, though they would eventually wander to [[Huitztli Hill]] for reasons unknown. The [[Traveler]] discovered the facility and shut it down, freeing the captured Saurians in the process.

After Capitano failed to acquire the Gnosis from Mavuika, he ordered his subordinates to instead focus on an alternate plan to rework the nation's [[Ley Line]]s by searching for the [[Source Mechanism]]. He also sent a request to be relieved of his duties of acquiring the Gnosis, which the Tsaritsa approved. Having interrogated three scholars and combining their research, they were able to locate the device and headed to a cave to activate it. The plan instead failed, as it awakened [[Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night]], and creator of the [[Night Kingdom]]. As a result of the failed plan, Ororon became acknowledged as one of the [[Ancient Name|six heroes]] for Mavuika's plan, and Capitano eventually agreed to support Mavuika, knowing that her plan had the potential for the best outcome. Thus, he ordered his subordinates to begin assisting the Natlanese, knowing that they would not defy him.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Beneath the Secret Source}}</ref>

When the Abyss launched a massive invasion on Natlan, the Fatui worked with the Natlanese to fight the invasion off, suffering immense casualties in the process.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Despair Engulfs the Heavens}}</ref> Nonetheless, after the battle concluded, Mavuika thanked Capitano for their invaluable assistance.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Fuel Named "Fate"}}</ref> Upon learning of the [[False Sky]] after the invasion, Dottore also sent a small group of Fatui to infiltrate Natlan from [[Nod-Krai]] to investigate the Ancient Moon Remnants.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|When All Becomes a Monument}}</ref> 

Once the Abyss influence was purged from the Night Kingdom, Capitano merged his life force with Lord of the Night's, seating himself at the [[Throne of the Primal Fire]] as his consciousness was moved to the Night Kingdom to substitute Mavuika's sacrifice to [[Ronova]]. The Tsaritsa retained Capitano's status as a Harbinger. Aware of her plans with the Gnoses, Mavuika suspected that the Tsaritsa would send another Harbinger to collect the Gnosis.

A group of Fatui led by [[Grudoc]], who were affiliated with Pantalone, were sent to accompany a Fontanian merchant named [[Montluson]] to the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]] in order to search for evidence of the Battle of Seven Colors, as Montluson had created a special paint and was enraged when his profits failed to materialize, after a Fontanian tourist claimed to have seen the same color in Natlan. Pantalone believed that Montluson had the potential to become a giant in the painting industry and disrupt Fontaine's economic system, which apparently aligned with his interests. While [[Citlali]] and the Traveler defeated the Fatui, Grudoc proceeded to use a backup plan by destroying the sphere to avoid implicating Pantalone in the plot, presumably at the cost of his own life.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Seven-Hued Ruins}}</ref>

Another group of Fatui set up camp by the [[Great Volcano of Tollan]] to investigate the kuuvahki, requested by a specific Lord Harbinger. Some of these Fatui participated in a feast involving [[Bifrons]]'s green mushrooms, cooking at their camp.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Smokeless War}}</ref>

===In Snezhnaya===
The Fatui Harbingers were recently summoned back to Snezhnaya and dispatched to Nod-Krai, following the highest of commands the "Palestar Edict."  According to [[Helka]], they brought with them with many construction materials, though she does not know what they intend to do. <ref>Song of the Welkin Moon</ref><ref>{{Ref/NPC|Helka}}</ref>

===Leaders===
====Tsaritsa====
{{Main|Tsaritsa}}
The '''Tsaritsa''' is the [[Cryo]] [[The Seven|Archon]] and the Archon presiding over Snezhnaya. The Fatui Harbingers carry out her plans to seize authority from the gods, though her motivations for doing this are still shrouded in mystery.

====Eleven Fatui Harbingers====
{{Main|Eleven Fatui Harbingers}}
The '''Eleven Fatui Harbingers''' are the executive officers of the organization, being under only the Tsaritsa herself. They are given absolute executive authority by her and answer directly to her. They are blessed with powers that exceed those of an average human, but those powers do not seem to be derived from their [[Vision]]s. Instead, the Harbingers all possess a [[Delusion]], which are said to be even more powerful. Those among the Fatui who have proven themselves in their strength are chosen by one of them to serve as direct subordinates. Each Harbinger goes by a code name instead of their real names and leads their own division within the Fatui. Currently, the only known divisions are the Debt Collection division and the Intelligence division, the latter also being known as the House of the Hearth.

====House of the Hearth====
{{See also|House of the Hearth}}
The '''House of the Hearth''' is a group founded by [[Crucabena]], who is succeeded by [[Arlecchino]]. Unlike the other known Fatui groups, all of its members consist of orphans from all over the continent who are raised under a single group. Once the orphans have come of age, they enlist in the Fatui and either continue to serve Arlecchino, or transfer to a different Harbinger's command.

====Ninth Company====
{{See also|A Company Vanishing Into the Deep}}
This company was dispatched by [[Pulcinella]] to [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]] to investigate its recent strange phenomena as part of an agreement between [[Snezhnaya]] and the [[Liyue Qixing]]. After [[Tartaglia]]'s actions in [[Liyue Harbor]], this arrangement was nullified and the supply chains were cut off, but the company stayed, unaware of the events at the surface.

The company originally contained 64 members, but Anton estimates that half of the soldiers have gone missing or died to accidents within the Chasm. Since the company's captain had also gone missing, Anton declared himself as the Brevet Captain (acting commanding officer).

Its members included:

====Desert Expedition Team ====
The '''Fatui Desert Expedition Investigation Team''' was sent to the [[Desert of Hadramaveth]] to investigate the status of the desert tribes for Dottore<ref name="Rejoice" /> as well as explore the [[The Orchard of Pairidaeza|Eternal Oasis]] venerated by the Eremites. The expedition commander, Professor [[Froderock Fronkonsteen]], also wished to obtain a member of the desert tribes for experimentation.<ref name="Zoya">Interactables: [[Captain Zoya Snezhevna's Reports]]</ref> They struck a deal with the [[Tanit]] tribe; they would supply the Tanit with Snezhnayan supplies and technical documents and help Babel consolidate power in exchange for the tribe's help exploring the oasis. However, Babel betrayed them, resulting in the Fatui becoming scattered and unable to advance.<ref name="Zoya" /> They briefly work with [[Aderfi]] and [[Azariq]] to overthrow Babel, but this fails after the Traveler and [[Jeht]] kill the two "traitors."

Eventually, the expedition team ends their negotiations with the Tanit with a deal to get rid of Jeht, who would be taken as their test subject. They capture Jeht and take her to their ad-hoc headquarters at [[Wadi Al-Majuj]] to be transported out of the desert.

==Trivia==
* The word "{{wt|fatuus|Fatui|Noun}}" is Latin for "Fools."
** In Italian, its meaning is "someone who works hard, but fruitlessly."
* In English, "{{wt|fatuus|Fatuus|Noun}}" &mdash; the singular form of the Latin word ''fatui'' &mdash; is sometimes used to refer to a singular member of the Fatui.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Vortex's Wake|note=Quest Description|quote=After your chance meeting with Zhongli, you learn that a Fatuus named Kliment is trying to organize an archaeological expedition.}}</ref> The English word "fatuous," used in the name of the ''[[Fatuous Farce]]'' weekly Reputation Quests, is also derived from Latin ''fatuus''.
** In Japanese, however, {{ja|ファトゥス|Fatusu}} refers specifically to members of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Chasing Shadows|note=Japanese|quote={{ja|モンドには…オレらの「{{Rubi|執行官|ファトゥス}}」がいる！}}}}</ref>
** In Chinese and Korean, the word sometimes used to refer to a singular member {{zh|愚人|rm=yúrén}}/{{ko|{{Rubi|愚|우|人|인}}|rm=u'in}} means "Fool."
* Diluc is a member of an underground intelligence network based in the north which, amongst its various activities, keeps tabs on the Fatui and previously intervened in the Harbingers' attempt to kill Diluc during his years away from Mondstadt.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Diluc|4}}</ref> He remained a member after returning to Mondstadt and has used its intelligence network to track the activities of both the Fatui and the [[Abyss Order]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Abyss Mage (Quest)}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|All's Well That Ends Well (Quest)}}</ref>
