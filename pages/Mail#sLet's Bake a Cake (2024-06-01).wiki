|text      = Time flies, just like Paimon, huh? Hehe~ Can't believe it's already been that long since we started traveling together! We've eaten so much delicious food and had so much fun, Paimon doesn't even know what to wish for anymore... Seeing as you're the one who's been doing all the cooking, Paimon thinks it's about time to show you what she's made of! Recently, she's been studying hard by watching over your shoulder while you've been cooking... Did you notice? But, well, uhh... Turns out that making a cake isn't as easy as it sounds... Besides, the ingredients themselves all look so tasty! So, umm… Why don't we try making it together instead? Paimon's even planning to add some freshly picked [[Bulle Fruit]]!

Oh, and Paimon's wish this year is that no matter where our adventures take us, it'll be full of happy memories and all go without a hitch! Don't forget, Paimon'll always be there by your side!
