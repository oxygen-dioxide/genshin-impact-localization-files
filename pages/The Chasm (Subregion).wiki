{{Location Intro|description=<p>In the recent past, a series of mysterious accidents led the entire mine to be closed, putting its workers out of a job. However, the [[Liyue Qixing]] is gradually reopening the area, thus allowing miners to resume working. Beneath the Seven-Star Array is [[The Chasm: Underground Mines|the Underground Mines]].</p>}}
