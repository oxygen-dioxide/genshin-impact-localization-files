'''Viktor''' {{Lang|ru=Виктор|ru_rm=Viktor}} is a member of the [[Fatui]]. He can be found inside the [[Favonius Cathedral]] at all times of the day until the completion of [[Return to Days of Winter]] where he will now leave from Mondstadt to Snezhnaya.

==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Viktor is a diplomat's assistant who was sent to [[Mondstadt]] to work for [[Signora]], but never received any orders since arriving. Without anything to do, he pointlessly loiters around the Favonius Cathedral.

===Personality===
Viktor is not very fond of [[Mondstadt]], finding the place extremely boring and openly questions [[Barbatos]]' purpose and existence, causing him to get hostile looks from the locals and he longs to return home. As with many Snezhnayans, he upholds his promises those who help him, telling the Traveler about the Fatui from what he knows of after they help him out in his tasks.

===Appearance===
''(To be added.)''

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Viktor:''' What are you playing at? What do you want?
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror...
:;(Unlocked between completing [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]] and [[A Long Shot]])
::'''Viktor:''' Hehe, now that's a topic that piques my interest. I am quite curious to see how the Knights of Favonius will handle Stormterror.
::'''Viktor:''' And if I may add, we the Fatui had nothing to do with this disaster.
::'''Viktor:''' So please refrain from pointing fingers and tarnishing the Fatui's reputation when this all goes down!
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Viktor:''' Hmph! I am not idling away my time by napping!
::'''Viktor:''' I'll have you know I am a Fatui diplomat&mdash;
::'''Viktor:''' Diplomat's assistant, Viktor!
::'''Viktor:''' I am here on orders from his excellency to assess the situation in Mondstadt!
::{{DIcon}} That sounds exciting, tell me more.
:::'''Viktor:''' I'll tell you one thing... Mondstadt is boring! *yawn*
:::'''Viktor:''' Though they call it the City of Freedom...
:::'''Viktor:''' There's just nothing to do here at all. How do Mondstadters put up with this place?
:::'''Viktor:''' Also, what's the big deal with this [[Barbatos]] guy? He's never even here!
:::'''Viktor:''' Can't compare with Her Majesty, the [[Tsaritsa]] of the Zapolyarny Palace... Ugh, never mind, that nun over there is giving me evil looks again.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Fatui.
::'''Viktor:''' You Mondstadt folks could not begin to fathom the affairs of the Fatui.
::'''Viktor:''' Ahem... Though to be honest, even I don't know about what goes on at the top level.
::'''Viktor:''' In any case, all you need to know is that there is no greater honor than being under the protection of the Fatui.
::'''Viktor:''' And as for the [[archons]]... Well, compared to having a [[Delusion]] at hand, all those religious beliefs and [[Vision]]s and so on are just child's play.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Viktor:''' So soon? Bye then.
::'''Viktor:''' You Mondstadters are no fun to be around anyway...
