==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Viktor is a diplomat's assistant who was sent to Mondstadt to work for Signora, but never received any orders since arriving. Without anything to do, he pointlessly loiters around the Favonius Cathedral. After Signora's death, he was transferred to work under [[Pulcinella]] in Sumeru City, assisting a man named Mr. [[Vsevolod]]. He works there as an agent of the [[Northland Bank]] prior to their establishment of a Sumeru branch.

===Appearance===
Viktor has short swept-back blond hair, the front of his hair is longer than the back. He is wearing a Fatui mask with a red mark across the left eye. He wears the typical Fatui uniform consisting of a red and dark grey coat with a gold Fatui symbol across the left side of his chest.

===Dialogue Set #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Before completing [[Return to Days of Winter]])
:'''Viktor:''' What are you playing at? What do you want?
:{{DIcon}} About Stormterror...
:;(Unlocked between completing [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]] and [[A Long Shot]])
::'''Viktor:''' Hehe, now that's a topic that piques my interest. I am quite curious to see how the Knights of Favonius will handle Stormterror.
::'''Viktor:''' And if I may add, we the Fatui had nothing to do with this disaster.
::'''Viktor:''' So please refrain from pointing fingers and tarnishing the Fatui's reputation when this all goes down!
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Viktor:''' Hmph! I am not idling away my time by napping!
::'''Viktor:''' I'll have you know I am a Fatui diplomat&mdash;
::'''Viktor:''' Diplomat's assistant, Viktor!
::'''Viktor:''' I am here on orders from his excellency to assess the situation in Mondstadt!
::{{DIcon}} That sounds exciting, tell me more.
::'''Viktor:''' I'll tell you one thing... Mondstadt is boring! *yawn*
::'''Viktor:''' Though they call it the City of Freedom...
::'''Viktor:''' There's just nothing to do here at all. How do Mondstadters put up with this place?
::'''Viktor:''' Also, what's the big deal with this [[Barbatos]] guy? He's never even here!
::'''Viktor:''' Can't compare with Her Majesty, the [[Tsaritsa]] of the Zapolyarny Palace... Ugh, never mind, that nun over there is giving me evil looks again.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the Fatui.
::'''Viktor:''' You Mondstadt folks could not begin to fathom the affairs of the Fatui.
::'''Viktor:''' Ahem... Though to be honest, even I don't know about what goes on at the top level.
::'''Viktor:''' In any case, all you need to know is that there is no greater honor than being under the protection of the Fatui.
::'''Viktor:''' And as for the [[archons]]... Well, compared to having a [[Delusion]] at hand, all those religious beliefs and [[Vision]]s and so on are just child's play.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Viktor:''' So soon? Bye then.
::'''Viktor:''' You Mondstadters are no fun to be around anyway...

===Dialogue Set #2===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After completing [[Equivalent Exchange Once More]])
:'''Viktor:''' *sigh* Fine, I'll just have to find a way to get by...
:{{DIcon}} Are you settling in to life in Sumeru?
::'''Viktor:''' No, but I'll just have to learn to get used to it... I was stationed here after all, so complaining won't do me any good.
::'''Viktor:''' *sigh* I really don't know how Mr. [[Vsevolod]] stays so enthusiastic about his work.
:{{DIcon}} Do you want to go back to Mondstadt?
::'''Viktor:''' No, of course not!
::'''Viktor:''' I may not have gotten acclimated to Sumeru just yet, but I'd much rather be here than in the cathedral getting dirty looks from that nun all the time.
::'''Viktor:''' Still, I wonder how that kid Lily is doing...
::{{DIcon}} Why don't I bring her a letter for you?
::'''Viktor:''' You'd do that? Uh...
::'''Viktor:''' Forget it, it's fine. Really.
::'''Viktor:''' I'm a Fatuus, I shouldn't be sending letters to that child. Who knows what sort of trouble that could stir up...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Viktor:''' You go do what you need to do. I have work I should be getting to as well.
::'''Viktor:''' *sigh* How did I end up getting stationed here...
