{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = Laser Sweep
|desc_1      = Activates 2 emitters that rotate while continuously firing laser beams. The laser beams deal '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} to targets that come in contact.

|name_2      = Carpet Bombing
|desc_2      = Ascends high into the air and flies towards the player while dropping a great number of bombs, each dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. At the end of the bombing sequence, smashes down to the ground, dealing '''60% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. The downward smash can also be used on its own.

|name_3      = Missile Barrage
|desc_3      = Locks onto the player and fires a barrage of homing missiles, each dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on hit.

|name_4      = Gravity Reduction Field
|desc_4      = Teleports to the center of the arena and covers the entire arena in a Gravity Reduction Field. Characters in this field will gain greatly increased jumping height. While the field is active, the Experimental Field Generator will use more powerful {{Geo}} attacks that can can be avoided by jumping. If the Experimental Field Generator is hit by a total of 3 {{Pneuma}}-aligned attacks in this state, the Gravity Reduction Field will end.
|file_4_2    = Prototype Cal. Breguet Gravity Reduction Field 2
|caption_4_2 = Interrupted

|name_5      = Gravity Ripple
|desc_5      = This is always the first and last attacks to be used by the Experimental Field Generator while the Gravity Reduction Field is active. Periodically sends out a shockwave that expands outwards that can be jumped over, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} on hit. If used the second time during a single Gravity Reduction Field, releases three consecutive shockwaves at the end. This attack cannot be dodged using [[sprint]] [[i-frames]].
|file_5      = Prototype Cal. Breguet Enhanced Attack 1

|name_6      = Enhanced Attack 2
|desc_6      = Consecutively detonates multiple explosions around itself, each dealing '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} and spawns several rocks midair. The rocks then fire themselves at the player, each dealing '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} on hit.

|name_7      = Enhanced Attack 3
|desc_7      = Marks areas on the ground where rocks emerge from the ground after a short delay, dealing '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} on hit.

|name_8      = Enhanced Attack 4
|desc_8      = Charges and releases a massive explosion, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}.

==Gravity Field==
{{Description|An Experimental Field Generator that once embodied the lofty ideals of an engineer. It brought calamity before these hopes could be realized. Nowadays, the exquisite mechanical construct quietly bides its time in the center of the ruined hall, waiting for the gravity field to take effect once more — a moment when it will no longer be seen as a mere memento of disgrace.}}

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A product of the Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering that has gone out of control due to an accident.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}
{{Description|A large device designed by the late [[Edwin Eastinghouse]]. It has the ability to "counteract" the effects of gravity. According to the original design intentions, this was the first step in a plan to turn [[Fontaine]] into a city in the sky, so never again would the people have to worry about the waves that once swept over the land. Even if all seven nations were to be swallowed by the deeps, the elegant Court of Fontaine would float above it all, just like [[Celestia]]. Even the secrets of the universe would no longer seem so distant.<br>The [[Arkhium]] in the device's core has the characteristics of "splitting" or "precipitation," and can take matter, or certain things outside of matter, and separate them. It is said that this process can be reversed, but the [[Fontaine Research Institute]] is infatuated only with the physical effects it can produce.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* Breguet is likely named after the real-life French horologist {{w|Abraham-Louis Breguet}}.
* This boss' Archive Entry, Tutorial, and World Map Icon refer to it as "Experimental Field Generator".
