==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Xuanji:''' You've already tasted our specialty tea. The wilds can be dangerous, so if there's nothing else, do return home soon.
:{{DIcon}} Do you have any more new teas?
:'''Xuanji:''' Haha, do not worry, I'm working on it as we speak.
:{{DIcon}} What do you do here exactly?
:'''Xuanji:''' Hmm? That is a strange question. This here is my tea store, and what would one do with such a place, if not sell tea?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
:'''Xuanji:''' Stay safe!
