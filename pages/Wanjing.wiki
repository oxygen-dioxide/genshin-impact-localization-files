==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Wanjing:''' So many scenic spots left to visit, but I'm already running out of [[Mora]]...
:{{DIcon}} Scenic spots?
::'''Wanjing:''' Are you a tourist, too?
::'''Wanjing:''' Judging from your calm demeanor, you must be one of those "been there, done that" experts who has been just about everywhere, right?
::'''Wanjing:''' I haven't really gotten around that much myself. I tend to stop pretty frequently while traveling, so at best I've only seen a few of [[Chenyu Vale]]'s most famous sights.
::'''Wanjing:''' [[Yilong Dais]] is my final stop on this trip. I've heard that burning incense in that censer outside the mountain is super lucky!
::'''Wanjing:''' But I'm pretty scared of heights, so I might need to ask someone to go there for me... I hope it won't be too expensive...?
:{{DIcon}} Is traveling around these parts expensive?
::'''Wanjing:''' No, no, no, [[Qiaoying Village]] and [[Yilong Wharf]] are both pretty cheap! Food and lodging aren't too costly, and most of the stuff on sale is great quality for the price.
::'''Wanjing:''' It's just that my travel budget is really limited, and I spent most of it on a [[Kamera]] some Fontainian merchant recommended.
::'''Wanjing:''' It's a good thing the Kamera takes such beautiful pictures! I can even use it to capture how I felt looking at such amazing sights. It's totally worth the Mora!
::'''Wanjing:''' Who knows? In ten to twenty years, maybe I'll only need to take a glance at these pictures to remember everything I experienced over these few days!
::'''Wanjing:''' I still need to take some photos from Yilong Dais at the summit...
:{{DIcon}} Good luck!
::'''Wanjing:''' Many thanks! Safe travels to you too!
