==Mercenary's Aged Notes (I)==
''(These notes look to have been abandoned here for many years, and the dry desert winds have made them brittle. The fact that they haven't been buried by the sands is quite odd indeed...)'' 

...Found a spring in the canyon here. Perfect for a rest. 

...This is a short contract. Just a pilgrimage to a site in the north. A simple escort mission, just like being a tour guide. ...The clients are a couple from the rainforest, both scholars from the [[Vahumana]] Darshan. The woman is already heavily pregnant. They're here to research the pilgrimage routes to the [[Vourukasha Oasis]].

...Constantly collecting worthless trinkets buried in the sand, coins and talismans and the like... 

... 

...The night wind carries the smell of danger. If there are really bandits about, it's just my luck that I have one useless client and the other about to give birth... 

...This is great, just great. What am I going to do...

==Mercenary's Aged Notes (II)==
''(These notes look to have been abandoned here for many years, and the dry desert winds have made them brittle. The fact that they haven't been buried by the sands is quite odd indeed...)'' ...The woman's fetal movements are growing stronger. She can no longer endure long treks. But they haven't given up, they want to continue north... No, it can't be anywhere else, can it? They just HAVE to go to the Vourukasha Oasis, which just so happens to be another forbidden place. Hmph. ... ...The nomads there may not welcome us with open arms. I warned them, but noooo, they wouldn't listen... 

... 

..."'[[Babel]].' If she's a girl, then that's what we'll call her." That's what he said. And it was only then that I noticed how the woman's eyes were beautiful, like dusk falling over an oasis. 

...What are their names again? I didn't pay attention, because there's no need to remember, really. They're just two idiots who will get themselves killed, that much is obvious. The woman is from some sage's family. As for the man, his station is more lowly. Maybe he was from the desert too, some generations back...? No wonder they came to the desert despite expecting a child — I've seen this plenty of times before, reckless couples who disappear into the desert... 

... 

...The man went off on his own again. Nothing I can do about that. He's the one paying me, after all... But why am I the one who has to accompany the pregnant woman? 

==Mercenary's Aged Notes (III)==
''(These notes look to have been abandoned here for many years, and the dry desert winds have made them brittle. The fact that they haven't been buried by the sands is quite odd indeed...)'' 

...

...The man hasn't returned yet. Maybe he broke his leg somewhere, the useless clod. The woman's in bad shape though. Perhaps the fetus is in an abnormal position... 

... 

...The rug is dyed red all over... 

...She's weak, and may not make it through the night. Who knew such a small person could bleed so much... 

..."Babel"... She's a natural-born killer. I saw it myself. She ripped her mother's body apart. Absolutely incredible... 

...She's healthy, and might be able to survive on the milk of Sumpter Beasts. But her mother... I ended her suffering. She didn't want to leave her daughter, but had no strength... 

...It's a real shame. 

==Mercenary's Aged Notes (IV)==
''(These notes look to have been abandoned here for many years, and the dry desert winds have made them brittle. The fact that they haven't been buried by the sands is quite odd indeed...)'' 

...I found the man in the middle of a sandstorm. His clothes were ragged, and he was in poor condition... I doubt he'll be able to pay my commission. 

...I told him he could either pay up or use his daughter to repay his debt. Regrettably, we failed to come to an agreement... 

...At least the two of them are together again, in the end... 

... 

...As for little Babel, if she can survive growing up and pass the trials of the [[Tanit]], she will likely become a mighty "Falcon" indeed...
