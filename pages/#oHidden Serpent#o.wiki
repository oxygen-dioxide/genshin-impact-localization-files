|description    = A low-pitched horn model shaped like a massive serpent, with a knob to control the pitch. It has the same design as the low-pitched horn model found in the Faded Castle.<br>It is said that though this horn has a very exaggerated appearance, its tones are like those of a serpent hidden in the brush. The sound is mellow and full, with a low key, and is not easily noticed. Many artists take advantage of this characteristic by skillfully inserting it into the accompaniment to create a tense atmosphere and a sense of impending danger...
