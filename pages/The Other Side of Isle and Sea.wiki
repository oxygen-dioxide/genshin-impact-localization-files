'''''The Other Side of Isle and Sea''''' is a [[World Quest]] that occurs in [[Golden Apple Archipelago/1.6|Golden Apple Archipelago]]. It was part of the [[Midsummer Island Adventure]] event.

==Steps==
Start by observing the mural on the wall.
# Take a photo of a mural
# Look for other murals
#* Players need to take photos of all 5 murals before progressing to the next step.
# Return to [[Mondstadt]] and look for a [[Sayid|researcher]]

==Gameplay Notes==
* Players can start the quest from any of the available murals.
* There are 5 murals in total, one on [[Broken Isle Mural|Broken Isle]], [[Minacious Isle Mural|Minacious Isle]], [[Nameless Island Mural|Nameless Island]], [[Nameless Islet Mural|Nameless Islet]], and [[Twinning Isle Mural|Twinning Isle]].
* In order to take a photo of a mural, players need to first observe the mural by selecting the Observe option that appears when walking up close to it. Otherwise the photos will not count towards the quest. Players can use [[Photo Mode]] from the [[Paimon Menu]] or equip the [[Kamera]]. It is not needed to use the "save" option upon taking the picture.
* To be able to go to the [[Nameless Islet]], players need to find the [[Illegible Notes|journal]] shown in the [[Twinning Isle Mural]]. The journal will trigger the quest [[A Trip Through Fog and Wind]].
* The "Nameless Island" is to the west of the island at [[Twinning Isle/1.6|Twinning Isle]].

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You discover a strange mural on one of the islands in the Golden Apple Archipelago. Perhaps this archipelago is home to more of these murals...}}
===Upon taking a picture of any mural for the first time===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Take a picture of observed mural for the first time)
:'''Paimon:''' Who knew that we'd find a mural like this one on this island?
:'''Paimon:''' Still, we can't make complete sense out of the story these murals depict just by looking at them.
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe there might be similar murals on the surrounding islands nearby...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's look around and see what we can find!

===Broken Isle===
;(Observe the mural)
:''<small>(If this is the first mural you've found)</small>''
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm? Look, there's some sort of... drawing on this stone.
:''<small>(Otherwise)</small>''
::'''Paimon:''' Look! Over here! There's a mural here too!
:'''Paimon:''' What's this... looks like five... pillars? Or are those five cups of water? Paimon wonders which it is...
:'''Paimon:''' Well, let's record it down anyway.
;(Only plays if you interacted with the stone pedals for the [[Broken Isle/1.6#Mural Lake Puzzle|Mural Lake Puzzle]] before)
:'''Paimon:''' This mural... feels like it has something to do with that pool on the mountaintop.
:'''Paimon:''' But we can't be sure how they're related...
;(Take a photo and obtain [[Broken Isle Mural]])

===Minacious Isle===
;(Observe the mural)
:''<small>(If this is the first mural you've found)</small>''
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm? Look, there's some sort of... drawing on this stone.
::'''Paimon:''' Looks like a ship with lots of people on it... meeting a disaster at sea...
:''<small>(Otherwise)</small>''
::'''Paimon:''' Ooh! Here's another mural!
::'''Paimon:''' Looks like a ship with lots of people on it... meeting lots of huge waves...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon can't read this very well... Either way, let's make of note of this mural first, shall we?
;(Take a photo and obtain [[Minacious Isle Mural]])

===Nameless Island===
;(Observe the mural)
:''<small>(If this is the first mural you've found)</small>''
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm? Look, there's some sort of... drawing on this stone.
:''<small>(Otherwise)</small>''
::'''Paimon:''' Over here! There's a mural here as well!
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like a broken ship... and one group of people saving another...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's not totally sure what it means, but let's record this mural down first.
;(Take a photo and obtain [[Nameless Island Mural]])

===Nameless Islet===
<small>Part of [[A Trip Through Fog and Wind]]</small>
;(Observe the mural)
:''<small>(If this is the first mural you've found)</small>''
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm? Look, there' some sort of... drawing on this stone.
::'''Paimon:''' It looks like people are getting ready to board a ship.
:''<small>(Otherwise)</small>''
::'''Paimon:''' Huh, Paimon didn't think we'd find a mural here, too...
::'''Paimon:''' It looks like it shows people getting ready to board a ship.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't know what all this means, but let's record this mural down first.
;(Take a photo and obtain [[Nameless Islet Mural]])

===Twinning Isle===
;(Observe the mural)
:''<small>(If this is the first mural you've found)<!-- plays even if Illegible Notes is not obtained --></small>''
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm? Look, there's some sort of... drawing on this stone.
::'''Paimon:''' This one seems to show a mountain... with a special symbol on it.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon's not totally sure what it means, but let's record this mural down first.
:''<small>(Otherwise, if obtained [[Illegible Notes]])<!-- this dialogue plays after having already discovered other murals as well as having both obtained Illegible Notes and completed Fog and Wind... many variables there --></small>''
::'''Paimon:''' Looks like we've found another mural.
::'''Paimon:''' This one seems to show a mountain... with a special symbol on it.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon's not totally sure what it means, but let's record this mural down first.
:''<small>(Otherwise)<!-- possibly if Fog and Wind has not been completed yet? or if Illegible Notes has not yet been obtained? --></small>''
::'''Paimon:''' Looks like we've found another mural.
::'''Paimon:''' This mural looks like it has some special meaning.
::'''Paimon:''' Looks like the marking is right on top of that mountain. Should we go have a look? Who knows, maybe we'll find something.
;(Take a photo and obtain [[Twinning Isle Mural]])
;(If obtained [[Illegible Notes]])
:'''Paimon:''' This mark... looks like the same spot that was on the journal we found.
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe that journal and the mural were left by the same group of people!

===Observe any mural again===
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon wonders what story these murals record...

===After all murals have been found===
;(After collecting photos of all murals)
:'''Paimon:''' Well, we've recorded all these murals down. If we connect them, we should be able to put the pieces together.
:'''Paimon:''' Still, it feels as though these murals are hiding some other message. If only we could get someone to help us decipher it...
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps we should put up a commission at the Adventurers' Guild.
::'''Paimon:''' Hey! If we do that, and the murals turn out to be clues to some treasure, aren't we just giving it up for free?
::'''Paimon:''' That won't do! Let's look for... oh, let's go look for a researcher and get them to help us out!
:{{DIcon}} Let's rope a researcher into this business, shall we?
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm, that would be best. But where would we find one...
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, Paimon's heard people say that you can normally find researchers in the library, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go back there and try our luck, shall we?
:'''Paimon:''' Who knows, we might just find the researcher we need there!

;(Return to Mondstadt and talk to [[Sayid]])
:'''Sayid:''' Hello, friend. Is there anything I can do for you?
:'''Paimon:''' Are you a researcher?
:'''Sayid:''' Haha, I suppose I count. Strictly speaking, I am a "wandering scholar," but I suppose that is merely just a subset of "researcher."
:'''Sayid:''' Well, then. Have you encountered a problem that you need a "researcher" to help solve?
:{{DIcon}} Well here's what happened...

:'''''You and Paimon explain the process of recording the murals to Sayid...'''''

:'''Sayid:''' Islands out at sea... and murals you found there. How fascinating.
:'''Sayid:''' So you're looking for a researcher who can help you decipher those murals, I gather?
:{{DIcon}} Are you willing to help us out?
::'''Sayid:''' Of course, I have never rejected the opportunity to study the unknown.
:{{DIcon}} We can pay you.
::'''Sayid:''' Hahaha. From the look of things, you must be highly-experienced adventurers.
::'''Sayid:''' However, I would say that these stories of the unknown are the greatest possible remuneration for me. You need not pay me anything else.
:'''Sayid:''' Now then, let's not delay. Could I have a look at those murals?
:{{DIcon}} Here are the ones we recorded down.
:'''Sayid:''' Oh, not bad, not bad at all.  My apologies, please give me a moment to think...

:'''''Sayid examines the murals carefully...'''''

:'''Sayid:''' Hmm. The contents depicted by these murals are not difficult to decipher in and of themselves. I cannot quite put them all in order yet, but I think there should be no problem if we just tried to understand them one by one.
:'''Sayid:''' First, we have this mural, which depicts a group of people who were shipwrecked.
:;(Shows [[Minacious Isle Mural]])
:'''Sayid:''' After they were shipwrecked, they must have drifted to the island where you encountered the murals.
:'''Sayid:''' They then stayed on that island.
:'''Sayid:''' As for this mural, it shows five objects with five different markings within them.
:;(Shows [[Broken Isle Mural]])
:'''Sayid:''' Just like five cups of water, with each containing a different amount of it.
:'''Sayid:''' This sort of artwork usually hints at the change in state of something.
:{{DIcon}} A change in state...
:{{DIcon}} ...What does that mean, exactly?
:'''Sayid:''' However, I cannot guess what this "something" is exactly...
:'''Sayid:''' Still, if this island is in the middle of the ocean, then this "something" could always be "seawater."
:'''Sayid:''' Next, let's look at this mural.
:;(Shows [[Nameless Island Mural]])
:'''Sayid:''' After yet another shipwreck, the island welcomed some new "guests."
:'''Sayid:''' This should be the first batch of people attempting to rescue the second. Also, if you'll have a look at the wreckage depicted here...
:'''Sayid:''' The first mural only hints at their situation, but this mural goes into a lot of detail as to the wrecked ship.
:'''Sayid:''' Perhaps this particular shipwreck meant something unusual to the people who wound up on this island.
:'''Sayid:''' Then we come to this mural.
:;(Shows [[Twinning Isle Mural]])
:'''Sayid:''' Here, I'm sure you can observe that this mountain has been specially marked out.
:'''Sayid:''' I suspect this place must have been important to these people.
:'''Sayid:''' Finally, we come to this one. Clearly, they found some way to leave this island and thus departed.
:;(Shows [[Nameless Islet Mural]])
:'''Sayid:''' The story the murals tell should be as such.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you.
::'''Sayid:''' It was nothing. In fact, I have always been interested in this sort of research.
:{{DIcon}} Why did they have to use murals, though?
:: '''Sayid:''' Sometimes, images are most intuitive than language when it comes to recording and transmitting information.
:'''Sayid:''' Thank you for bringing me this story and these murals. I never thought that I would encounter such things in Mondstadt.
:'''Sayid:''' Perhaps I should take some time out to walk around outside...
{{Dialogue end}}

===Post-Quest Dialogue===
These dialogue lines appear upon observing the murals after having completed the quest.
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Observing the Broken Isle Mural)
:'''Paimon:''' The more Paimon looks at these five things, the more they look like cups with water in them.

;(Observing the Minacious Isle Mural)
:'''Paimon:''' When these people got shipwrecked, they must have first stayed on this island.

;(Observing the Nameless Island  Mural)
:'''Paimon:''' This group of people must have saved another group on this island.

;(Observing the Nameless Islet Mural)
:'''Paimon:''' They must have left this island. Let's hope that their voyage went smoothly this time...

;(Observing the Twinning Isle Mural)
:'''Paimon:''' This mural looks like it's trying to mark something out.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* The story is expanded on during Version 1.6 through ''[[From Outer Lands]]'' and most [[Echoing Tales/Story|Echoing Conches]]. The story of the ship in the second shipwreck is further expanded on in two World Quests during the Golden Apple Archipelago's next iteration in [[Version 2.8]], ''[[Treasure Voyage]]'' and ''[[The Final Treasure]]''.
* During the Golden Apple Archipelago's iteration in [[Version 2.8]], the only mural that remained was the one at the Nameless Islet depicting a group of people leaving on a boat.
