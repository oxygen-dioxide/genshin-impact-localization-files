|description  = A medium-sized, round fish with horn-like cartilage that is used to dig underwater burrows, build shelters and drive away creatures that try to harm them.<br>As the longest-living species of pufferfish, they have a light gray color and are easy to identify. The color comes from their unique way of survival &mdash; their cutis contains a substance similar to bile, which is far more acidic than that of other fish, causing them to be shunned by many underwater creatures.<br>But when cooked in a special way, the acidity actually adds to the freshness of the fish. As a result, this fish sells very well. At [[Sumeru]]'s fish markets, you can often see signs that say: "Do not keep Sunset Cloud Anglers in the same tank as other fish meant for consumption."
