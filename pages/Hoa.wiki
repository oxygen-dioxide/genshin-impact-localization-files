==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hoa:''' Greetings there, my friend. Do you need a letter mailed by any chance?
:{{DIcon}} You work for the postal service?
::'''Hoa:''' More or less. Us [[Scions of the Canopy]] are quite adept at traveling through the woods at high speed, so we took on most of the messenger work.
::'''Hoa:''' We'd establish Courier Longhouses all over Natlan, and help the tribes deliver letters and packages.
::'''Hoa:''' Sometimes, we'd also help the tribes recruit people for events, or coordinate collaborations between different tribes.
::{{DIcon}} What sort of collaboration?
::'''Hoa:''' They actually come up quite a lot. Let me think...
::'''Hoa:''' Sometimes, adventurers would want to hire a guide from the [[People of the Springs]], or request a doctor from the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]]. If they don't know how to find such individuals themselves, they'll often ask me to pass on the word.
::'''Hoa:''' Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. It's only right to help each other out.
:;(After completing [[When All Becomes a Monument]])
::'''Hoa:''' Y'know, like when we were struggling with the [[Abyss]]. I was running here and there delivering an endless torrent of messages and letters, and after it was all over, I had to take a much-needed rest.
::'''Hoa:''' But thanks to our brave heroes, I guess we won't ever have to face another war like that.
:{{DIcon}} Not right now.
::'''Hoa:''' I won't disturb you any longer, then.
