The '''Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard''' is a board in [[Ad-Hoc Main Tunnel]]. It becomes available at the end of ''[[Chasm Spelunkers]]'' after the exploration team sets up the first campsite in [[The Chasm: Underground Mines]].

===Simple Bulletin Board===
:'''Simple Bulletin Board:''' "We, the Chasm Exploration Team, have made this place our temporary base camp. All members, please pay attention to act within safety parameters at all times. Do not act alone without permission, and do not touch any unknown materials within the depths of The Chasm!"

===Message===
:'''Message:''' "Recently, we have discovered an unknown black mud-like substance in part of the main mining area. It is exceedingly dangerous. All spelunkers must be on double guard. Be sure to avoid areas tainted by this substance. If you have any questions, please ask [[Zhiqiong]] to show you the way around."

===Second Message===
:'''Message:''' "[[Taliesin]]'s shoes have gotten wet. Could we ask the resupply team to send down some changes of clothes and shoes?"
:'''Message:''' "Also, [[Jinwu]] needs a set of backup tools with which to process the [[Lumenstone Adjuvant]]s. Could the resupply team please send these over as soon as possible? Thanks!"

===Khedive's Note===
:'''Incomplete Note:''' (This half-torn sheet of paper is filled with complex mathematical workings and geometry. They seem to have something to do with astrology...)

===Mountainator and Millelith===
:'''Memo:''' "The '[[Mountainator]]' cannon within the main mining area seems to remain undamaged. We should be able to use this to open up a path and save ourselves significant amounts of time exploring this place."
:'''Memo:''' "However, we need to first clear the area of roving bandits. Fortunately, there's good news: the [[Millelith]] are already on the move cutting off their links with [[Treasure Hoarders]] on the surface."
:'''Memo:''' "If their connection to the surface is cut, the Treasure Hoarders underground will likely fall back of their own accord..."
:'''Exploration Team Campsite Noticeboard:''' "We need more supplies of vegetables. Also, having stayed down here without sunlight for too long, everyone needs eggs, mushrooms, and fish to keep themselves nourished."

===Old Notice===
:'''Old Notice:''' (This notice is very old indeed. It seems to have been put up by miners well before the exploration team ever arrived on the scene.)
:'''Old Notice:''' "The mines are a sprawling, complex place. Ensure that you carry a finch cage with you at all times while navigating any narrow spaces within in case of any leakage of poisonous or flammable gasses! Do not forget what our comrade [[Erge]] taught us!"

===Incomplete Note===
:'''Incomplete Note:''' (The edges of this incomplete sheet of paper have been charred a deep brown. It seems that someone read this under torchlight without keeping a safe distance...)
:'''Incomplete Note:''' "All miners have been equipped with specialized crystal lamps, so please do not bring flaming torches down into the mines. Additionally, professionals will direct you as to where you might start a fire. Please do not strike camp by yourself if you are unfamiliar with the terrain..."

===Evacuation===
:'''Miner's Message:''' "Please observe strict order while you disperse. Take your personal belongings with you and do not panic. Once the signal arrives from the surface, you may start leaving gradually in small groups!"
:'''Miner's Message:''' "As for all those who have gone too near to the 'crystal fragment,' please report to the medical team immediately, regardless of whether you had a negative reaction or not, and leave The Chasm as soon as possible!"
:'''Miner's Message:''' "Comrades, please do not panic and follow the higher-ups' announcements!"

===Covered Message===
:'''Covered Message:''' (This announcement and the messages written under it have been partially covered by newer notices. This might have been put up not long after the mines were sealed.)
:'''Covered Message:''' "After the 'crystal fragment' was discovered, the amount of [[Lumenstone Ore]] present increased rapidly. As for its benefits or potential risks, we require the exploration team to further confirm them..."

===Battered Namelist===
:'''Battered Namelist:''' (This old namelist seems to have been left here by the very first exploration team sent after the mine was sealed.)
:'''Battered Namelist:''' "We would like to invite the following professional staff to set up camp here to take samples, do research and learn how we might appropriately utilize Lumenstone:"
:'''Battered Namelist:''' "...Deputy Research Director, Jinwu. Experiment Assistant, Azadi... Explorers, He Zhi, He Wei..."
