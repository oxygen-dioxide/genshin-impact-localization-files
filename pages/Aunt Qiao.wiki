==Trivia==
*Aunt Qiao may have written the second remark on the ad for Pops Zhou's Tea on the [[Stone Gate Bulletin Board#Pops Zhou's Tea|Stone Gate Bulletin Board]]. The second note was written by someone who has lived in the area for over 40 years and knows Pops Zhou (and his tea) well, which fits with Aunt Qiao's dialogue about how she is familiar with all the vendors at Stone Gate.
