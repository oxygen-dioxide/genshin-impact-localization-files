|text      = To be clear, although you may know what day it is, I am writing simply to say hello with no special considerations.

Every day in life is important and deserves to be cherished in their own right. You don't have to wait until your birthday to celebrate. You can celebrate every day if you want.

So, it's not a bad thing to treat my birthday as just another day. As long as you're happy, that's good enough.

Anyway, I'm going to the tavern for a drink later.

These days, there are a bunch of cocky guys that say they'll pick up the tab if I can beat them at Genius Invocation TCG.

Sounds like a bargain.
