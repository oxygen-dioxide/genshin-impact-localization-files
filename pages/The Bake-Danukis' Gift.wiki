{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Katheryne)
:'''Katheryne:''' (Traveler), Paimon, have you met two bake-danuki recently, by any chance? One of them carries a purple cloth bag, while the other has a yellow one...
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh! You must be talking about Mamesuke and Shibasuke!
:'''Katheryne:''' Ah, great, so you do know them.
:'''Paimon:''' Um, did something happen to them?
:'''Katheryne:''' Not really, they just made a bunch of gestures before giving me this...<!-- seems like the branching didn't exist in-game...
:;(If the player has participated in [[Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas]])
::'''Katheryne:''' I've heard that you once visited the Good Hunter with a bake-danuki from Inazuma, so I thought you might be friends. I think they wanted me to give this to you.
:;(If the player has not participated in [[Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas]])<!-- got this line but did participate in the eight locales event -->
:'''Katheryne:''' From their gesticulations, I had a feeling that they might be friends of yours. I think they wanted me to give this to you.<!-- if the branching existed, then this line would need to be indented -->
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh! So this is a gift from Mamesuke and Shibasuke!
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, looks like their journey's off to a good start! Paimon wonders if we'll ever meet again...
