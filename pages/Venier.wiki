===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available after completing ''Trial of the Nameless Stone Statue'' and before completing ''Canticles of Harmony''.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Venier:''' A hundred and thirty-six... Alright, fourteen more times, and we'll take a break!
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Venier:''' Hehe, training, of course! Only through constant exercise of the body and soul can I defend this city and destroy the detestable barbarian invaders.
::'''Venier:''' And at the same time, prove myself to the [[Remus|Sebastos]] as worthy of ascension!
::{{DIcon}} Eligibility of ascension, you say?
:::'''Venier:''' That's right. Those who wish to ascend must either possess extraordinary musical talent, or have proven themselves through equally outstanding achievements and loyalty.
:::'''Venier:''' I've not demonstrated much musically in my life, so I can only secure ascension through ceaseless training!
::{{DIcon}} I wish you success!
:::'''Venier:''' Haha, thank you for the encouragement, friend! I, too, wish for the Sebastos to choose you to ascend to immortal form!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Venier:''' See you. Careful out there, now!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after completing ''Canticles of Harmony''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Venier:''' So tired... My arm hurts... It's like someone hit it, or something. 
:{{DIcon}} Would anyone dare to fight you? 
::'''Venier:''' Ah, my friend! Where did you learn to judge a book by its cover so?
::'''Venier:''' I am a musician, you see! These arms are most elegant when they pluck a lyre's strings, I assure you. 
::'''Venier:''' Although I do not know why, though I was exhausted after waking up from a lengthy dream, my arms now feel like they have been granted manifold strength. 
::'''Venier:''' I've never been this tired, not even when I would play the lyre without rest or sleep. 
::'''Venier:''' It seems that I shall have to return to Capitolium to get some rest...
::{{DIcon}} What's the Capitolium? 
:::'''Venier:''' Capitolium? Why, it's... it's... Wait. Where is it again? 
:::'''Venier:''' Strange. Why did that word suddenly leave my lips? It's as if it was my hometown, where my family is. 
:::'''Venier:''' *sigh* Alas, but I no longer have any family. 
:::'''Venier:''' If this Capitolium is some dream world or the afterlife, may I reunite with them there!
:::{{DIcon}} Sorry for your loss...
::::'''Venier:''' Grief will not simply disappear. We can only let it slowly fade. 
::::'''Venier:''' I once thought the world unjust for this reason, but will any amount of that change the past? 
::::'''Venier:''' The more I can commit to the [[Iridescence Tour]], the fewer opportunities there will be for sorrow. 
::::'''Venier:''' Perhaps [[Dvorak]], bless his good heart, was just trying to help me get on my feet when he asked for my assistance with the festival!
:::{{DIcon}} Could you tell me about your family?
::;(Unlocked after completing {{tx}}{{Verify|Possibly [[As Light Rain Falls Without Reason]]}})
::::'''Venier:''' My daughter inherited my musical gifts, and we were to perform at the Opera Epiclese together. 
::::'''Venier:''' But I... lost her in the dissolved young women case...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye. 
::'''Venier:''' Goodbye. Sorry, but I can't even... wave goodbye to you properly.
