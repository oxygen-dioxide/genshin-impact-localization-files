'''Moco''' is an open-world [[NPC]] in [[Dawn Winery]], [[Mondstadt]]. She can be seen with her fellow maid [[Hillie]]. In the morning, they can be found outside the winery; at night, they are found inside the winery.

The two are always found conversing with each other, and head maid [[Adelinde]] is often less-than-pleased with their work, which perhaps stems from their tendency to chatter. They have two versions of their dialogue, which play at random.
