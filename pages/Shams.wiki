==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Shams:''' No one needs a vacation more than someone who's just had a vacation.
:{{DIcon}} Are you on vacation?
::'''Shams:''' Bingo &mdash; warm sunlight, tasty food, and an endless supply of time!
::'''Shams:''' Haha, don't misunderstand me, I'm no hedonist. It's just that I finished up a big job, and now I happen to be enjoying my holiday.
::'''Shams:'''  It wasn't easy going to [[Inazuma]] to do business during the [[Sakoku Decree]]... *sigh* But that's all in the past now. No point in dwelling on it.
::'''Shams:'''  Anyway, after wrapping up that big one, I can finally take it easy for a while.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} It was pretty tough.
::'''Shams:'''  Yeah, if you've tried to get through the thunderstorm around Inazuma, you must know what I mean.
::'''Shams:'''  In the end, I had to ask for help from the [[Crux Fleet]] to take the herbs and stuff to [[Watatsumi Island]].
::'''Shams:'''  I learned quite a lot from them on that trip... But, uh, I'm gonna save it for the next time we work together.
:;(Obtain [[Guide to Gold]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} Enjoy your vacation.
::'''Shams:''' Enjoy, enjoy! All together now!
{{Dialogue end}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Shams:''' [[Kamal]], hear me out, next time, I want to do an even bigger job...
:{{DIcon}} Who's Kamal?
::'''Shams:''' Kamal is my old pal!
::'''Shams:''' But Kamal's already packed it in and doesn't do this business with me anymore... *burp* He insisted on joining some doggone [[Adventurers' Guild]].
::'''Shams:''' The way I see it, those small-fry jobs the Adventurers' Guild is slinging aren't nearly as &mdash; *burp* Aren't nearly as exciting as my work...
::'''Shams:''' Maybe he just got tired of it. If you have the spare time &mdash; *burp* &mdash; don't forget to bring my old pal Kamal some good food and drinks.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} As long as I get paid.
::'''Shams:''' Okay, okay, payment's not an issue.
::'''Shams:''' *burp*... I don't think he's around here, so I'm gonna save you the trouble today.
::'''Shams:''' Here, this is... *burp* for you.
:;(Obtain [[Biryani]] ×3)
:{{DIcon}} "An even bigger job"...?
::'''Shams:''' What's hottest in Sumeru right now is definitely... uh, that canned stuff, pretty rare... Right?
::'''Shams:''' *burp* ...Someone like me doesn't have the cushy reserves of the [[Homayani Family|Homayanis]]. If I want to make money, I have to take risks and do high-end business.
::'''Shams:''' People of superior learning may not give a hoot about anything else, but that's not the case when it comes to knowledge.
::'''Shams:''' Let me tell ya, I got them all figured out... *burp*
:{{DIcon}} (Time to make a discreet exit...)
::'''Shams:''' I will... make a profit!
