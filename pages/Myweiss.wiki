==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Myweiss:''' I think this one should be called, Love Turns You into an Unthinking Vegetable...
:{{DIcon}} Have you seen anyone around that looks a lot like me?
::'''Myweiss:''' Hmm? You mean, you're looking for a relative?
::'''Myweiss:''' You don't look or dress anything like a local, so I'm sure anyone who looks like you would have made an impression... Sorry, it seems I haven't seen them.
::'''Myweiss:''' I hope you find your lost relative soon. You have my full support! Being related by blood is the only real connection you can have in this world. Not love, as some imbeciles would have you believe.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Myweiss:''' Me? Well, I used to be known as Myweiss the Lovebard... but not anymore. Now I go by Myweiss, Grim Reaper of Romance.
::'''Myweiss:''' What is love but a lie we tell to fool children? Only idiots would believe in something so stupid.
::'''Myweiss:''' Ugh, men! They say one thing and do another...
::'''Myweiss:''' ...My ex-husband, for example!
::{{DIcon}} Tell me more about your ex.
::'''Myweiss:''' Hmph. His name was Davy, a bard in name and name alone... Who knows what I ever saw in him.
::'''Myweiss:''' After we were married, he chastised me for having my own pursuits &mdash; said I should be taking care of things at home...
::'''Myweiss:''' ...Meanwhile, he was all smiles in front of other girls. I observed him for a time and to be fair, they were all just people in his audience. Still, I felt like there was an accident waiting to happen there...
::'''Myweiss:''' Anyway. I get it now. Love is a big hoax, and I need to make sure the women of Mondstadt wise up to it!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Myweiss:''' Don't be led astray! There's no such thing as love!

==Event Dialogue==
===Invitation of Windblume===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Myweiss:''' The [[Windblume Festival]]... Hmph, it's that time of the year again, is it?
:'''Myweiss:''' I had an epiphany when I got divorced, and it was like waking from a long dream: The Windblume Festival should never have been associated with love at all!
:'''Myweiss:''' Hah, it must have been the scheme of some scheming city merchants. Wouldn't they love to package every festival as something for lovers?
:'''Myweiss:''' ...People in love have no rational thought to speak of. A little flattery here and there and their wallets open wide.
:'''Myweiss:''' Whatever the case, I've come to my senses now. These festivals are absolutely meaningless.
:'''Myweiss:''' And if not for the Windblume Festival, would I even have met that man? Hmph...
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
*Her name in the original Chinese version is a transcription of {{w|Mavis}}, an English female name that originates from a dialect name of the {{w|song thrush}} (''Turdus philomelos''), whose song is famous for being beautiful.
