'''Starshroom''' is a food item that can be obtained in the [[Underground Mines]] of [[The Chasm]] and in [[Sumeru]].

Starshroom restores 300 HP to the target character. Like most foods, this can not target other players' characters in [[Co-Op Mode]]; this can only target characters of the player's party.

The player can apply {{Electro}} or {{Pyro}} to Starshrooms found in Sumeru to obtain [[Activated Starshroom]]s or [[Scorched Starshroom]]s respectively.

==How to Obtain==
Starshrooms are found in the overworld of [[Sumeru]], as well as in the caves of the [[Underground Mines]], especially in [[The Glowing Narrows]]. Picking up Starshrooms while in the Underground Mines will restore [[Lumenstone Adjuvant]] energy.

See the '''[https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/9?shown_types=355 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for specific locations in the Underground Mines.

==Trivia==
* Eight Starshrooms are needed for the quest ''[[Mycological Investigation in The Chasm]]'', and are referred to as "shining mushrooms". According to [[Khedive]], they are identical to a species indigenous to [[Sumeru]], besides the fact that they are fluorescent. He suggests that the mushrooms didn't evolve to glow, but rather went through an ecological phenomenon caused by absorbing energy from a "fragment that fell from the sky."
* The top of a Starshroom's cap contains a [[Symbols in Teyvat#Four-Pointed Star|four-pointed star]], a common visual motif in the game.
* In real life, there are over 100 known fungi species that exhibit bioluminescence, with many having bioluminescent mushrooms, and some of them (certain ''{{w|Armillaria}}'' species) being edible like Starshrooms. See {{w|List of bioluminescent fungus species}}.
