'''Flamethrowers''' are a type of [[Obstacle]] that shoots out flames that deal {{Color|Pyro DMG}} to the player.

These can be activated with switches or monuments or can be always on. They can be temporarily deactivated by inflicting {{Cryo}} on the monument, or avoided by simply climbing over them.

Sometimes flamethrowers are stationary. Other times they are seen rotating in a group.

==Domains==
*Flamethrowers are first seen in [[Crash Course]] but appear in various domains throughout Mondstadt.
*They also appear in [[Eula]]'s story domain [[Behind Enemy Lines]]

==Trivia==
* One must use Cryo to disable them. Using Hydro does not appear to work.
* Flamethrowers always reactivate after a few seconds, even if the Cryo application that deactivated them is a long-lasting Cryo application.
