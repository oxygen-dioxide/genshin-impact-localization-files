==Description==
This crimson polearm has seen countless battles, and has borne witness to [[Unnamed Gladiator|a certain gladiator]]'s valor.<br />
Its ice-cold tip was often drenched in the blood of its foes, to the thunderous applause of the crowd.<br />
Bloodstained was the gladiator's fate, and freedom, so near yet so far, was often balanced on a knife's edge.<br />
The dull sound of that crimson tip piercing flesh was many a battle's death-knell.

As the gladiator's final performance ended, their master spoke up amidst the thunderous applause:<br />
"The promised number has been met. You have done well, and are a warrior worthy of great renown."<br />
"Consider this weapon to be a parting gift... Yet, would you not consider fighting on?"<br />
"Continue your brilliant performance as a free person, for your glory and for mine. What say you?"<br />
Many years past, and the beasts and men who fell to that spear grew too numerous to count.<br />
The duelist's weapon became known as undefeated, but his heart belonged to his young master.

As the gladiator's final performance ended, amidst thunderous applause,<br />
His weapon fell to the bloodied sand as the [[Vennessa|red-haired maiden]]'s scorching blade pierced the old warrior's heart.<br />
As he fell, despondent, he turned his eyes to his beloved master, his noble lord who cherished him...<br />
"[[Eberhart]], Master Eberhart... Did my final performance please you?"<br />
But his master's seat was empty, save for a wine goblet and silver platter, toppled in haste.

"At first, I fought for myself, for blood and battle-lust."<br />
"But since a time I know not when, I have killed for my master."<br />
"Only for the sake of others can we fight like wild beasts without care."<br />
"Someone like you, who fights for her people and not for herself... Surely, you understand this as well."
