==Get Inspiration==
# You can gather inspiration by logging into Genshin Impact cumulatively and completing the corresponding quests in the game.
# During the first five days after the event begins, a new inspiration quest will go online every day at 04:00 on server time. You can switch tabs to preview quest details.
# You can also make progress for quests that are not yet available. As soon as that quest is available, you can then receive the reward.
* If Travelers try to do the event around 04:00 (Server Time), which is when the Daily Commissions refresh, there might be a brief network error. Please refresh your page if you encounter such a situation.
