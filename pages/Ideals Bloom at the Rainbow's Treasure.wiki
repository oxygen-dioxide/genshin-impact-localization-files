==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the location of [[Liam]]'s treasure)
:'''Paimon:''' Based on what the treasure map says, it should be here... but why are there Treasure Hoarders here, too?
:'''Paimon:''' Nothing for it, just deal with him, quick and clean.
<!-- Fight {{Enemy|Treasure Hoarders: Electro Potioneer|text=Davy Smith &mdash; Sparrow-Occupied Dove Nest}} -->
----
;(Approach the location of [[Rocky Avildsen]]'s treasure)
:'''Paimon:''' This is the spot the treasure map led us to, but... Why are there Treasure Hoarders here, too?
:'''Paimon:''' It's all because of you lot that we had to spend extra time looking for the treasure! We could've eaten 3 whole extra [[Chicken-Mushroom Skewer]]s in that time! Gaaaaah!
:'''Paimon:''' Deal with him in the time it would've taken to eat 3 Chicken-Mushroom Skewers!
<!-- Fight {{Enemy|Treasure Hoarders: Cryo Potioneer|text=Davy Smith Jr. &mdash; Bandit Family's Bloodline}} -->
----
;(Approach the location of [[Rouge]]'s treasure)
:'''Paimon:''' This is the spot marked on the treasure map... "The withered tree with the Fruit of Wisdom," "Ask thrice"... Just what are we supposed to do?

;(Hit the tree with the apple once)
:'''Sound of Unknown Origin:''' Booong!

;(Hit the tree a second time)
:'''Paimon:''' Another noise! So that's what "ask thrice" means.
----
;(After finding all treasures)
:'''Paimon:''' Speaking of which, there are patterns on the back of the Treasure Map we found. Paimon always thought they were strange.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's take another look at the Treasure Map. Maybe we missed something there...
:'''Paimon:''' ...Hmm, doesn't it look like a picture when you put them together? It looks like a... like a [[Rainbow Rose]]?
