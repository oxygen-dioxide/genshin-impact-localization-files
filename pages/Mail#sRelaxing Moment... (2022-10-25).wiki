|text      = According to aristocratic etiquette, one can dance for cherished ones on their birthday, and this dance of celebration will bestow upon both parties their ancestors' blessings.

I have no interest whatsoever in the [[Lawrence Clan|Lawrence clan]]'s blessings, nor do I intend to observe this rigid aristocratic tradition. That's why I never mentioned it to you.

But come to think of it, maybe I shouldn't have been so biased. Maybe I don't have to do away with the core and form of this tradition alive... Since dance has always remained noble to me, as long as I perform in my way, I'll be offering you my own blessings.

Anyway... Don't let me wait for too long.
