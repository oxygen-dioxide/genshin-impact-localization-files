{{Quote|Absolute peace. Such is the gift from the [[Tsaritsa]], such is Her Majesty's benevolence.

Now you rest in this coffin, encased in layer upon layer of ice. But [[La Signora|Rosalyne]], I promise you... Your final resting place will be the entirety of the "Old World"...|Pierro|[[Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo]]

Pierro is the very first member of the [[Fatui]], thereby the first of the Harbingers. He has personally recruited several Harbingers, including [[Il Dottore]], [[Scaramouche]], and [[Signora]].<ref name="PF" />

==Story==
===History===
Pierro's past is largely a mystery but is alluded to in [[Pale Flame#Mocking Mask|Mocking Mask]]. He was originally a royal mage of [[Khaenri'ah]] and lived with the [[Traveler's Sibling]] for a time.<ref name=":0" /> He failed to gain favor with [[Irmin|Khaenri'ah's ruler]] due to being less capable than the country's sages and could not stop them from doing something that tore away the "veil of sin," which brought destruction to the nation. For this reason, he became embittered with the "divine" and joined the [[Tsaritsa]]'s cause.<ref name="PF" />

===Recruiting Other Harbingers===
At some point in the past, Pierro went to [[Sumeru Akademiya]] in pursuit of rumors surrounding a student there performing heretical acts. He found the man who would become known as [[Il Dottore]], who readily agreed to join the Fatui Harbingers upon discovering that they were supportive of his efforts to create an enhanced human who could surpass the gods.<ref name="PF" />

Pierro also recruited [[Signora]], at the time known as the Crimson Witch of Flames, to join the Fatui. He bestowed her with a Cryo [[Delusion]] in order to suppress the intense flames flowing through her body.<ref name="PF" /><ref>{{Ref/Item|Ashen Heart}}</ref>

Pierro and Dottore had a hand in the event known as the [[Tatarasuna#Tatarasuna Mystery|Tatarasuna Mystery]] where Dottore infiltrated the [[Mikage Furnace]] as a Fontaine mechanic by the name "Escher" to sabotage the nation per Pierro's order. Upon finishing the mission, Dottore offered to introduce a certain [[Scaramouche|puppet]] to Pierro, expected to make it their new comrade if it proved useful, otherwise it would be disposed of. Later on, Pierro encountered the puppet and recruited it to the Fatui, who would later become Scaramouche.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Ref/CS|Wanderer|4}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Kabukimono's Finale}}</ref> Pierro would send Scaramouche on very important tasks, which also included trips into the [[Abyss]].

When [[Tartaglia]] became a Harbinger and received his Delusion, Pierro was the one to pin it on him.<ref name="pierro">{{Ref/CS|Tartaglia|Delusion}}</ref>

===Present===
During the event [[Unreconciled Stars]], while Pierro does not make a personal appearance, he was responsible for sending [[Scaramouche]] to [[Liyue]]. While investigating the meteor at [[Musk Reef]], Scaramouche makes a discovery: ''"The stars, the sky... It's all a gigantic hoax. A lie."'' Believing that Pierro had foreseen the meteorite showers and the discovery he would make, Scaramouche leaves in an irritable mood, presumably to confront the senior Harbinger.<ref name="UnrecStars">{{Ref/Quest|Where Ancient Stars Align}}</ref>

Pierro masterminded the Fatui's involvement in [[Inazuma]].<ref name="Clean House">{{Ref/Quest|Clean House}}</ref> To prolong the war, create a demand for Delusions, and secure their supply of materials to create more Delusions, Pierro sent [[Nathan]] to infiltrate the [[Watatsumi Army]], sabotage their efforts, and create chaos on [[Yashiori Island]]. Scaramouche was also dispatched to oversee the [[Delusion Factory]]'s operations,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Delusion (Quest)}}</ref> while Signora manipulated the [[Kanjou Commission]] and otherwise continued her mission of collecting the [[Gnosis|Gnoses]]. After the Fatui's actions were exposed, Pierro had an order sent to [[Borenka]] to withdraw from Yashiori Island and bring back the few Shogunate renegades to him as test subjects for an unknown experiment.<ref name="Clean House" />

==Trivia==
* In ''{{w|commedia dell'arte}}'', a type of Italian theater, "{{w|Pierrot}}" (Pedrolino in Italian) is a sad clown, pining for love of Columbine, who usually breaks his heart and leaves him for Harlequin.
** His name was adapted into Pierro to match the actual pronunciation of Pierrot.
* Pierro's Chinese alias ({{zh|丑角}}) literally translates to "The Clown Role," which is a direct translation of the role of ''Pierro'' (sad clown). It can also by extension mean The Jester, The Comedian, The Fool, or The Buffoon.
* Pierro has the same [[Primogem]]-shaped pupils as [[Dainsleif]], [[Kaeya]], and [[Halfdan]], implying that this feature is exclusive to those from [[Khaenri'ah]].
