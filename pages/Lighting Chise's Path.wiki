:{{DIcon}} Err, hello?
:{{DIcon}} Need any help?
:'''Chise:''' O mighty Thunderbird, please... Do not be angry...
:'''Chise:''' I will do my best to read your decrees and your instructions... But...
:'''Chise:''' But why do you reject me... Why... *sobs*
:'''Chise:''' Why can't I enter the fog you created...
:{{DIcon}} Read... What are you talking about?
:{{DIcon}} Wait a moment. Hasn't the fog dispersed?
:'''Chise:''' The Stormstones you left behind... I will do something about them. But the silver boat is coming. My time is short...
:{{DIcon}} What are these Stormstones you're talking about?
:'''Chise:''' The Stormstones of the Autake Plains... Only those who can wield the thunder can bring them back to life, and only those who can traverse the fog can find them...
:'''Chise:''' To stand tall like the Thunderbird... to unfurl one's wings like the Thunderbird...

;(Talk to Chise before lighting all Stormstones)
:'''Chise:''' My time is short...

;(Talk to Chise  after lighting all Stormstones)
