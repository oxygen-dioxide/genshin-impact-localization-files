{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Pengyi:''' Oh, it's you! Thanks so much for your help previously.
:'''Pengyi:''' Are you here to try your hand at making some fireworks?
:{{DIcon}} What sorts of fireworks can I make?
::'''Pengyi:''' Oh, lots and lots! I could be here all day and not finish talking about them. That said, I've written some basic formulas down for you.
::'''Pengyi:''' Go ahead, have a gander at them!
::'''Pengyi:''' I have faith that you'll be able to make some lovely fireworks!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Pengyi:''' Ah, you must be busy with other things, I suppose? In that case, pop by again when you're free &mdash; but don't go through this Lantern Rite without making a few fireworks, you hear?
