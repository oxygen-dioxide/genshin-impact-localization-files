'''Gardemeks''' are specialist [[Clockwork Meka]] that serve the [[Court of Fontaine]] and are associated with the [[Maison Gardiennage]]. The Gardemeks are in charge of daily security matters, and they aid their corresponding [[Garde]]s officers in conducting patrols around the Court of Fontaine.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Plessia|quote = Gardemeks and the Gardes are both under the Maison Gardiennage.}}</ref>

While Clockwork Meka in general can be used by anyone, Gardemeks can be privately owned, albeit only by the wealthiest amongst the citizenry.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Truth, Lost With the Rain|quote = '''Thierry:''' They're certainly not cheap, so whoever their owner is must be super rich, powerful, or both.}}</ref> Each Gardemek also has a serial number associated with it as to ensure for accountability.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Truth, Lost With the Rain|quote = '''Navia:''' So if you hypothetically wanted to do something against me, all you would need to do is get rid of the meka's serial numbers and send them after me...}}</ref> Gardemeks owned by the Maison Gardiennage are pre-programmed to complete tasks assigned to them and thus cannot be fully controlled by a human Garde. For this reason, the Special Patrol are not fond of Gardemeks, as their rigid movement and large size often block their musket shots and the potential of criminals turning the Gardemeks against their allies.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Chevreuse|2}}</ref>

The citizenry of Fontaine regard Gardemeks as reliable helpers, and it is said that by simply screaming or yelling for help is enough to summon the assistance of Gardemeks patrolling nearby.<ref>[[Aquabus]] &mdash; Clementine Line, [[Aeval]]: [[Aquabus#Clementine Line C4: About Fontaine's Public Security|C4: About Fontaine's Public Security]]<br>'''''Aeval:''' Because Fontaine's public security is absolutely top-notch! Just shout out "HELP! SAVE ME!" and a nearby Gardemek will come to your assistance immediately!''</ref>
