==Trivia==
* The music timestamped at 0:28 and onwards is possibly a remix of the song "{{w|Layla}}" by {{w|Derek and the Dominos}}. The main guitar riff in "Layla" resembles the violin melody in "Surreal Noctivaga."<ref>YouTube: [https://youtube.com/shorts/9sL0cuf6oLs "Surreal Noctivaga" by HOYO-MiX and "Layla" by Derek and the Dominos]</ref>
