==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Before completing [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]])
:'''Lorgar:''' Hey! Traveler!
:'''Lorgar:''' It's dangerous ahead! Don't go that way!
;(After completing The Outlander Who Caught the Wind)
:'''Lorgar:''' In front of you is the danger zone... Huh? Could you possibly be...
:{{DIcon}} ...What's wrong?
:;(Before completing The Outlander Who Caught the Wind)
::'''Lorgar:''' The roads ahead are dangerous &mdash; a convoy was attacked by powerful monsters in the mountain pass.
::'''Lorgar:''' We better leave if we have no business here.
:;(After completing The Outlander Who Caught the Wind)
::'''Lorgar:''' Your attire... Could you be the traveler they spoke of?
::'''Lorgar:''' Huh? You don't? Your heroic deeds have already spread across Mondstadt. I heard that it was you who put an end to the storms that terrorized Mondstadt!
::'''Lorgar:''' Though I believe you're capable of dealing with the monsters ahead, I'd still like to ask you to watch out and take care.
:;(Regardless of whether The Outlander Who Caught the Wind is completed)
::{{DIcon|Reward}} How's the situation?
:::'''Lorgar:''' It's not looking too good... The hilichurls have been increasingly active recently, it's becoming quite a headache.
:::'''Lorgar:''' But there's not much I can do beyond warning the adventurers and travelers around here to watch their backs.
:::'''Lorgar:''' Here are some notes I jotted down, maybe you'll find them helpful. Take care now.
::;(Obtain [[Adventurer's Experience]] ×3)
:{{DIcon}} Have you seen anyone who looks a lot like me?
::'''Lorgar:''' Someone like you? Why, yes, I believe I have...
::'''Lorgar:''' A lot of young adventurers like you will come tramping into the Stormbearer Mountains. I turn most of them back, which is good, since it's quite dangerous up ahead...
::'''Lorgar:''' Oh&mdash; You're looking for a relative, then? I'm sorry, I misunderstood you.
::'''Lorgar:''' I don't think the person you're looking for has come to the Stormbearer Mountains. Best you go look somewhere else.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Lorgar:''' Take care.
