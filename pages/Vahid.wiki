==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Vahid:''' Oh! Dear customer, are you also interested in [[Anahitian Blessing]]?
:{{DIcon}} Anahitian Blessing?
::'''Vahid:''' Have you never heard of it?
::'''Vahid:''' It's a specialty from our [[Sumeru]], the grace of Lesser Lord Kusanali!
::'''Vahid:''' No matter how barren the land or dreadful the climate, a small amount of it shall work wonders!
::{{DIcon}} What is the theory behind that product?
::'''Vahid:''' Um, well... It must be the elemental power within, which grants the land more vitality, and then that, uh...
::'''Vahid:''' *cough* I'm not a researcher, so I can't really explain it well. Anyway, we the Sumeru locals all use this stuff for farming. Its effects are impeccable.
::'''Vahid:''' It's perfect either for your own use or as a gift for your family and friends!
:{{DIcon}} About this shop...
::'''Vahid:''' Syavushi Bakshesh Shoppe only sells specialties from Sumeru.
::'''Vahid:''' Apart from our featured product, Anahitian Blessing, we also have the carefully picked Super Delicious [[Rukkhashava Mushrooms]]...
::'''Vahid:''' These specialties all came from Sumeru across the sea. So rest assured, their authenticity is guaranteed!
::{{DIcon}} How's business going?
::;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:::'''Vahid:''' Why would you ask that? Of course...
:::'''Vahid:''' ...Ah never mind, I'll be honest with you.
:::'''Vahid:''' Before the [[Sakoku Decree]], we still had Inazuma locals coming from [[Narukami Island]] to purchase our goods.
:::'''Vahid:''' But ever since the Sakoku Decree took effect, only a few people have come. It's getting harder to do business, and I'm not sure how long can we last...
:::'''Vahid:''' Dear customer, would you like to buy some Anahitian Blessing? How about buying it as a souvenir for your journey here?
::{{DIcon}} How's business been?
::;(After completing Transient Dreams)
:::'''Vahid:''' Uh... How should I put this?
:::'''Vahid:''' I originally thought that the Sakoku Decree's abolishing would see business pick up, but it hasn't actually improved all that much.
:::'''Vahid:''' It's always the same few customers coming to purchase fertilizers. They often forget the method of using the fertilizer to boot...
:::'''Vahid:''' Well, by the way, dear customer, would you like some Anahitian Blessing? How about buying it as a souvenir for your journey here?
:::{{DIcon}} Eh, no thanks.
:::'''Vahid:''' Ha, haha...
:::'''Vahid:''' Ah, indeed, who would buy fertilizers as a souvenir...
:{{DIcon}} Thank you! Goodbye!
::'''Vahid:''' Ah, okay. We look forward to your next visit.
