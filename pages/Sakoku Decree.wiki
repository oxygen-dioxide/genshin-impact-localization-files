The {{Lang|'''Sakoku Decree'''|ja=鎖国令|ja_rm=Sakoku-rei}},<ref> [[Version 1.6]] Special Program</ref> was an order issued by [[Ei]]'s puppet, [[the Shogun]], to shut down the borders of [[Inazuma]] as part of the [[Vision Hunt Decree]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref>

People who want to leave or enter Inazuma legally must pass the strict assessments conducted by the [[Kanjou Commission]] to obtain permission. Those who are not Inazuman cannot leave [[Ritou]] without a [[Travel Permit]] as a result. However, such restrictions did not initially apply to the [[Fatui]] and [[Snezhnaya]]n merchants due to their diplomatic ties.

The [[Tenryou Commission]] also enforces the Sakoku Decree.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Together Under the Fireworks}}</ref>

To enforce the Sakoku Decree, the Shogun surrounded Inazuma with a storm barrier, resulting in very few ships being able or willing to navigate them and harm Inazuma's economy. The storm barrier is encountered in-game as [[A Nation Closed by Thunder]] and prevents players from entering Inazuma before the quest [[Setting Sail]] ([[Archon Quest]] [[Chapter II]] Act I: [[The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia]]) as well as traveling to and from Inazuma without teleportation, such as with [[Teleport Waypoints]].

When the Vision Hunt Decree was abolished, the Sakoku Decree had not immediately followed suit.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Traveler|About the Sakoku Decree}}</ref> However, the restrictions placed upon foreigners were relaxed and the decree was expected to be lifted soon after. After her duel against [[the Shogun]] in [[Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter|Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter Act II]]: [[Transient Dreams]], Ei abolishes the Sakoku Decree, resulting in an influx of visitors and foreign trade returning to normal.
