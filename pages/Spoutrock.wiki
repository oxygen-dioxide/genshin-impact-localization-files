'''Spoutrocks''' are rocks in [[The Chasm]] that enhance the player's jumping ability to quickly reach high places. Spoutrocks store high-pressure air that can be used to enhance jumping abilities.

Players are granted enhanced jumping ability while standing on these rocks, shown by an {{Anemo}}-colored swirl effect around the character. This visual effect is loss if the player is not standing on the Spoutrock, immediately losing the effect. When the player jumps, they will be boosted to a predetermined height, often just enough to reach a ledge. Players will not take [[Fall Damage]] on landing when jumping off a Spoutrock.

They function very similarly to the [[Springboard Platform]]s in the [[Divine Ingenuity]] event.
