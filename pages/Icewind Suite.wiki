{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1      = Double Spin
|desc_1      = Coppelia and Coppelius each performs a melee attack with their fan and cape, dealing '''60% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DMG}} and {{Color|Cryo DMG}}.

|name_2      = Stationary Lift
|desc_2      = Coppelius skates in a small circle, dealing '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} and leaving a trail of ice shards. The ice shards detonate shortly after, dealing '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}.

|name_3      = Glacial Flourish
|desc_3      = Coppelius raises his cane before tapping it on the ground, sending out a trail of ice, dealing '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}.

|name_4      = Shard Spray
|desc_4      = Coppelius spins his cane to shoot forward many icicles, each dealing '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}.

|name_5      = Coppelia's Climax
|desc_5      = Coppelia and Coppelius move to the center of the arena and initiate Climax. Climax will trigger when 30 seconds have passed since the beginning of the fight or the last Climax, upon reaching '''71%''' of their Max [[HP]], or at the beginning of the fight while in the [[Spiral Abyss]].
* Three Whirlwinds of Dirge will spawn on the arena and slowly move in a clockwise direction.
** Whirlwinds of Dirge are initially Anemo-infused. However, if hit by Coppelius's ice blades, they will become Cryo-infused.
** Anemo-infused whirlwinds deal '''15% ATK''' as {{Color|Anemo DMG}} every 0.5 seconds and continuously [[Vacuum Field|drags]] players towards the center.
** Cryo-infused whirlwinds deal '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} and {{Color|Anemo DMG}} simultaneously every 0.5 seconds.
* Coppelia will perform the following sequence of attacks, dealing {{Color|Anemo DMG}}:
** 2 swipes with her fan ('''60% ATK''', '''60% ATK''', second hit deals half DMG if first hit lands)
** A pulse of wind ('''90% ATK''')
** 2 swipes with her fan ('''92% ATK''', '''92% ATK''', second hit deals half DMG if first hit lands)
** 2 pulses of wind ('''90% ATK''', '''90% ATK''')
* Coppelius will perform the following sequence of attacks, dealing {{Color|Cryo DMG}}:
** 2 swings of his cane ('''60% ATK''',  '''60% ATK''')
** Skates in a small circle, dealing DMG to players in his path, then skates to the edge of the arena ('''80% ATK''')
** Fires 2 ice blades at the player after a bow ('''100% ATK''', '''100% ATK''', second hit deals 0.25× DMG if first hit lands)
** Skates in a full circle around the arena, dealing DMG to players in his path, then returns to Coppelia ('''40% ATK''')
* The above sequences will repeat 3 times if Climax is not interrupted.
* During Climax, the duo will increase their [[RES]] to all DMG by '''25%''' during every sequence. Hitting them with a {{Pneuma}} attack will remove this RES increase. Additionally, the pulses of wind released by Coppelia will have a much smaller AoE and have their DMG reduced to '''60% ATK'''. Hitting them with 3 {{Pneuma}} attacks during a single Climax will interrupt the Climax and stun the duo for a short period of time.

{{Description|Artificed Dancers developed by the Fontaine Research Institute.<br>[[Bossuet]] originally intended for Artificed Dancers to be works of art that transcended the era of mechanical reproduction. But after Bossuet was forced to resign, the project was taken over by [[Maillardet]], who had his own unique understanding of what he wanted to achieve. As a result, while their features were perfected during the course of its development, the Artificed Dancers gradually strayed from Bossuet's original vision.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* The in-game Icewind Suite ballet was created by [[Bossuet]], with Coppelia and Coppelius being modeled after the roles of Claire and Lothair.
* The Icewind Suite are currently the only boss in-game which are not aggressive towards players in their arena in the overworld; the fight is only initiated upon talking to [[Maillardet]]. They are also the only Normal Boss with a canonical reason for "respawning"; attempting to start the fight again before they have respawned will result in Maillardet stating that they are undergoing repairs.
* The Icewind Suite makes use of two distinct death animations upon being defeated:
** If the Icewind Suite is defeated with both meka together, Coppelia will drop onto Coppelius' arms, while Coppelius will grab her and tilt its head down.
** If the Icewind Suite is defeated while separated, Coppelia will drop onto the ground.
===Etymology===
* Coppelia and Coppelius are two characters that appear in the ballet ''{{w|Coppélia}}'', in which Dr. Coppelius creates Coppelia, a mechanical doll so lifelike that it is mistaken for a real woman.
