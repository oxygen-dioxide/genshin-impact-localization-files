==Lore==
[[Dainsleif]] believes that the city was built by a civilization more ancient than Khaenri'ah or the [[Abyss Order]]; however, he remarks that the architecture resembles Khaenri'ah's. Since then, the Abyss Order took over the city.

Within the city is an upside-down pool, which weakens the effect of Dainsleif's curse when he is nearby. Dainsleif believes that the pool is also a relic of the more ancient civilization and is part of the city's structure.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Grave of the Guarded}}</ref> Upon visiting [[??? (Fontaine)|???]] in [[Fontaine]], the player can look through a crack in a wall to see the upside-down pool, though the altar below it is missing.
