The inhabitants have since left westward towards [[Liyue Harbor]] and [[The Chasm]] for a better opportunity. [[Hilichurls]] have since moved in to the area to make use of the leftover facilities.</p><p>There are two [[Teleport Waypoint]]s in this area, one located towards the northern end of the area and one towards the west leading to Guili Plains. There is also a [[Statue of The Seven]] located between the village and Yaoguang Shoal.</p><p>Three small mining tunnels exist in the area around the village where one can find deposits of [[Iron Chunk]]s, [[Noctilucous Jade]], and [[Cor Lapis]].</p>}}
