==Steps==
# Talk to [[Michiya|the afterimage]] in the restricted area
# Look for the experimental records in the experimental site
#* Activate the {{Color|Cryo}} [[Elemental Monument]] to unlock the cell containing a [[Rimebiter Bathysmal Vishap]] and the [[Bathysmal Vishap Experimental Records]].
#* If the Experimental Records were already obtained before speaking to Michiya, this step will be automatically completed and the quest ends after Michiya's dialogue finishes playing.

==Gameplay Notes==
* Obtaining the [[Bathysmal Vishap Experimental Records]] is necessary to complete the {{Quest|Collection of Dragons and Snakes}}.
* The Bathysmal Vishap Experimental Records can be obtained without completing this quest.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to the afterimage in the restricted area)
:'''???:''' Hmph. This is the third group of people you've sent here on Enkanomiya's last day.
:'''???:''' If you want to collect the experimental records, then I have nothing to say to you. Perhaps if you can convince the Erebos and Sangonomiya Factions to cease their squabbling, we may yet discuss this.
;(If ''[[Collection of Dragons and Snakes]]'' has been started)
::'''???:''' In any case, I'm on Sangonomiya's side. It's better that these records remain forever buried here in the darkness.
::'''Paimon:''' Experimental records?
::'''???:''' What? You're not here to retrieve them? Then leave.
::'''???:''' But that said, no ordinary person should have been able to enter this place. Are you a Jibashiri? Or were you sent here by Sangonomiya to silence us?
::'''Paimon:''' No, no! We're just...
::{{DIcon}} Well, aren't you the bright spark?
::'''???:''' What do you mean?
::{{DIcon}} We're here to watch you work.
::'''???:''' Hmph...
::{{DIcon}} We're here to check on the measures you've taken to ensure the security of the records.
::'''???:''' ...Whatever the case, your ability to get here indicates that you are no ordinary person. But I don't care whose side you're on. Leave this place &mdash; better sooner than later.
::'''???:''' I've placed the records deep within the site, and the way can only be opened by activating an elemental monument. That will require a large amount of elemental energy.
::'''???:''' Once everyone leaves Byakuyakoku, the Bathysmal Vishaps will be let loose. These have been raised to react to a special kind of elemental energy.
::'''???:''' The Bathysmal Vishaps here are all of an enhanced variety, and they have a very high chance of passing their unique traits on their offspring. In a few years, this place will be swarming with powerful Bathysmal Vishaps.
::'''???:''' As such, the records shall be safe as can be.
::{{DIcon}} Wouldn't it be safer to just have the records burnt?
::'''???:''' That was the option that I favored, but our research team is split, and it's not as if I don't understand the other perspectives.
::'''???:''' "We're saving Watatsumi! We're heroes!" "Agh, we're going to be the villains in this story, aren't we..." Both these views have merit.
::'''???:''' And besides, leaving the truth to a generation that can forgive us for what we've done... That is an option that I can also accept.
;(If Collection of Dragons and Snakes has not been started)
::'''???:''' On such nights, Enkanomiya is filled with afterimages... Of the "past," of "records," of "history" and the like...
::'''???:''' They are unnecessary... and dangerous.
::'''Paimon:''' (This guy doesn't seem to realize that he's an afterimage himself.)
::'''Paimon:''' We're not here to retrieve any records.
::'''???:''' Oh, is that so? Then leave, please.
::'''???:''' Wait... No ordinary person should have been able to enter this place. Are you a Jibashiri? Or were you sent here by Sangonomiya to silence us?
::'''Paimon:''' No, no! We're just...
::{{DIcon}} We're here to take stock.
::'''???:''' Hmph. What is that, some kind of code that I didn't get the memo for? Still, it matters not. If you managed to get here, then I doubt I can stop you from doing as you please.
::'''Paimon:''' Hah! I mean, look, today is Enkanomiya's final day. I suppose it couldn't hurt to estimate the number of people we'll need to do the moving around here a little early.
::'''???:''' So yes, do as you like. Just make sure you don't light the elemental monument.
::'''???:''' Once everyone leaves Byakuyakoku, I will let the Bathysmal Vishaps loose. They have been raised to react to a special kind of elemental energy.
::'''???:''' The Bathysmal Vishaps here are all of an enhanced variety, and they have a very high chance of passing their unique traits on their offspring. In a few years, this place will be swarming with powerful Bathysmal Vishaps.
::'''???:''' They are still locked up at the moment, but the ruckus they'll make if they sense that elemental power will be quite the headache for me.
::'''Paimon:''' What are those for?
::'''???:''' For recording the experiments, of course? By the way, there are probably some odd materials over there. Not anything you'll need to bring along, so don't worry about them.
:'''???:''' Looking at you, you must either be a Jibashiri or one of Sangonomiya's retainers.
:'''Michiya:''' Tell the higher-ups this: that Michiya will remain in the restricted zone until the moment of departure comes to ensure that no one else approaches the area.
:'''Paimon:''' So that makes you Michiya, then?
:'''Michiya:''' Mmhmm... Although I'll probably have to change my name once we get up above the surface to start a new life. Still, our wrongdoings are not so easily wiped away.

;(Talk to Michiya again)
:'''Michiya:''' As for the rest? Hmph. I shall not say.
----
{{Quest Description|[[Michiya]] must have a reason for not giving the records up. You decide to investigate further...}}
;(Look for the experimental records in the experimental site)
:'''Paimon:''' You've gotten better at pulling the wool over someone's eyes again, huh?
:'''Paimon:''' What was he talking about just now, anyway? Something about lighting the elemental monuments up to obtain the records.
:'''Paimon:''' The monument will summon dangerous [[Bathysmal Vishaps]], though, so we should prepare ourselves first!
;(Obtain {{Item|Bathysmal Vishap Experimental Records|20}})
