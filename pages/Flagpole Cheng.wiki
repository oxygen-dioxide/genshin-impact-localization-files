:'''Flagpole Cheng:''' Ah! The enemy is attack&mdash;
:'''Flagpole Cheng:''' ...Oh, you're not the enemy. Phew, you scared the life out of me!
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Flagpole Cheng:''' Just following orders from Sarge. If the enemy attacks, I have to report it straight away...
::'''Flagpole Cheng:''' But I'm short-sighted, and... I'm still waiting on my new spectacles after I broke the last pair...
::'''Flagpole Cheng:''' In the meantime... *sigh* Let's just hope it stays calm around here.
:{{DIcon}} Seen anyone around that looks a lot like me?
::'''Flagpole Cheng:''' Oh... So you were looking for someone to {{sic|talk you}}... You gave me a fright.
::'''Flagpole Cheng:''' Speaking of which, someone did show up some time ago who had a very similar silhouette to yours...
::'''Flagpole Cheng:''' ...But my glasses had already been broken before that. It's also possible that you passed this way earlier and I caught sight of you.
::'''Flagpole Cheng:''' So, is the person I saw the one you're looking for? I don't know either...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Flagpole Cheng:''' While the Millelith stands guard, e&mdash;evil shall, um, n&mdash;never prevail... Anyway, take care, sir... no wait, ma'am...?
::'''Flagpole Cheng:''' ...Sorry, I can't see your face clearly at this distance.
