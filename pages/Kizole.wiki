;(Before clearing the "Tunnel Through the Mountain")<!-- Use the Tatankasaur's skill to break the rocks in the tunnel; not a quest-->
:'''Kizole:''' Urgh, this is trouble. The volcanic eruption's blocked the path...
:'''Kizole:''' *sigh* Who even knows how long the cleanup's going to take.
:'''Kizole:''' Sure would be nice if we had something or someone on hand to just smash right through... Heh.

;(After clearing the "Tunnel Through the Mountain")
:'''Kizole:''' Well, that's this road cleared up!
:'''Kizole:''' That [[Tatankasaurus]] sure was fast! I wonder whose partner it is... I'll have to thank them the next time we meet.
