{{Quest Description|Somewhere in the desert in front of a giant ruin machine, Mahamata Afratu seems to be troubled by something...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach the researcher)
:'''???:''' Are you [[the Eremites]] that I, Afratu, commissioned? Please stop here if you are not.
:'''Afratu:''' The area ahead is very dangerous. I've already commissioned the Eremites from the [[Citadel of Regzar]] to deal with it. Ordinary people should stay back.
:'''Afratu:''' As a Mahamata, it would be a dereliction of my duties if anything were to happen to you.
:{{DIcon}} We're no ordinary people.
::'''Afratu:''' Oh, that's what all the new adventurers say, but overconfidence is dangerous here in the desert.
:{{DIcon}} Did something happen up ahead?
::'''Afratu:''' Something strange is going on.
:'''Afratu:''' See that huge machine over there? It is said to be a relic of the legendary Dahri people.
:{{DIcon}} Dahri?
:'''Afratu:''' Hmm, perhaps you're more familiar with the name [[Khaenri'ah]]? Dahri is an archaic name that's commonly used in the [[Vahumana]] Darshan.
:'''Afratu:''' Legend has it that the {{Rubi|Dahri|Khaenri'ah}} [[Schwanenritter]] once piloted these huge machines to combat the monsters from the abyss.
:'''Afratu:''' Three [[Ruin Golem|Ruin Golems]] survived that brutal war and were sealed by the sages. This is one of them.
:'''Afratu:''' It has been lying there silently for centuries, but lately, it suddenly became active and has even attacked nearby people.
:'''Afratu:''' It indiscriminately attacks all living things in its vicinity with beam cannons. This is the first time we've seen such dangerous capabilities in these sealed Ruin Golems. There's no way we can leave it unattended.
:'''Afratu:''' The Chaos Cores that powered them should have been deactivated long ago, so it's strange that they can still function... even after several hundred years.
;(If [[Vimana Agama: Jazari's Chapter]] has been completed)
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon didn't understand a thing, but this Ruin Golem should be similar to the one we saw in Devantaka Mountain, right?
::'''Paimon:''' But that big guy didn't attack everyone around it.
::'''Afratu:''' Oh, you know about Ruin Golems? Then I suppose that saves me the explanation.
::'''Afratu:''' So you guys should know, while they do still have an autonomous system, they are mainly operated by people.
::'''Afratu:''' That's the strangest part too. The sages have sealed the path into the Ruin Golem using Suda's Flow, so no one should have been able to activate it.
::'''Afratu:''' Did someone get inside by other means? Or perhaps it was triggered by an activation device that we have no knowledge about?
::{{DIcon}} If only Jazari were here...
:::'''Paimon:''' Right! Mr. Jazari specializes in Ruin Golem research! If he was here, he would be dying to go inside and have a look.
:::'''Afratu:''' Hmm? You know Jazari? Yes, he has indeed done some research on these machines. I had asked him for his help with the investigation, but it seemed that he was too busy writing something.
:::'''Afratu:''' Perhaps that's the exact naivety of the Kshahrewar? If he had paid more attention to the inner workings of the Akademiya, he wouldn't be stopping at Dastur now.
:::'''Paimon:''' Why don't we help you instead? We helped Mr. Jazari with his investigation too.
::{{DIcon}} The only way to find out is to have a look inside.
:::'''Afratu:''' True, though I wonder what's going on at the Citadel of Regzar... It's taking so long for the Eremites to arrive.
:::'''Afratu:''' The Akademiya's seal isn't the problem. The main issue is the huge rock that's blocking the entrance into the Ruin Golem. There's no way I can move it away on my own.
:::'''Paimon:''' Ooh, it does sound like something we can help you with. After all, we've been inside once before.
::'''Paimon:''' That is, if you give the Eremites' payment to us. Right, (Traveler)?
::'''Afratu:''' Really? Having people with prior experience would be great.
::'''Afratu:''' But are you adventurers? I can't let you take such risks if you're ordinary citizens.
::'''Afratu:''' You may have helped in an investigation on a similar machine, but this is different. That guy's beam cannons are no joke.
::'''Afratu:''' I don't know how I'd face the Akademiya if I just let you throw your lives away.
;(If [[Vimana Agama: Jazari's Chapter]] has not been completed)
::'''Paimon:''' Chaos Cores? [[Ruin Guard]]s have them too, right?
::'''Afratu:''' Oh, you know about Ruin Guards? That makes things so much easier to explain. Simply put, a Ruin Golem is a super huge version of a Ruin Guard.
::'''Afratu:''' But unlike Ruin Guards, while they do still have an autonomous system, Ruin Golems are mainly operated by people.
::'''Afratu:''' That's the strangest part too. The sages have sealed the path into the Ruin Golem using [[Suda's Flow]], so no one should have been able to activate it.
::'''Afratu:''' Did someone get inside by other means? Or perhaps it was triggered by an activation device that we have no knowledge about?
::{{DIcon}} The only way to find out is to have a look inside.
::'''Afratu:''' True, though I wonder what's going on at the Citadel of Regzar... It's taking so long for the Eremites to arrive.
::'''Afratu:''' The [[Akademiya]]'s seal isn't the problem. The main issue is the huge rock that's blocking the entrance into the Ruin Golem. There's no way I can move it away on my own.
::'''Paimon:''' Ooh, we can help with that.
::'''Paimon:''' That is, if you give the Eremites' payment to us. Right, (Traveler)?
::'''Afratu:''' Are you adventurers? I can't let you take such risks if you're ordinary citizens.
::'''Afratu:''' The Ruin Golem's beam cannons are no joke. I don't know how I'd face the Akademiya if I just stood here and watched you put your lives at risk.

:{{DIcon}} We're registered adventurers.
::'''Afratu:''' If that's the case, I suppose it's at least procedurally sound.
:{{DIcon}} We're internationally renowned adventurers.
::'''Afratu:''' Really? I'll have to verify that with the Adventurers' Guild later, but I suppose I can take your word for it first.
:'''Afratu:''' After all, I have important research to do, and it's just not feasible to stay here this whole time. I'll leave it up to you guys so that the problem gets resolved quickly.
:'''Afratu:''' I need you to enter the Ruin Golem and shut down its autonomous system from inside. It would be even better if you could figure out the reason behind this strange phenomenon...
:'''Afratu:''' Its autonomous system should be controlled by a switch in its cockpit. After turning that off, the Ruin Golem will enter manual operation mode. However, the cockpit has been sealed too... You'll need to break the seal before entering.
:'''Afratu:''' Hmm... According to the records, the power of the seal is maintained by three groups of mechanisms called "Suda's Flow." Breaking them all will unseal the entrance.
:'''Afratu:''' Just be careful not to destroy the internal structures. After all, this is an important cultural relic registered at the Akademiya.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, of course! Just leave it to us!

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Afratu, optional)
:'''Afratu:''' (What a nuisance...)

;(Talk to Afratu again)
:'''Afratu:''' Although I'm the Mahamata in charge of this area, I was actually sent here on a temporary assignment because I was on an expedition and happened to be nearby.
:'''Afratu:''' Besides, I'm from {{Rubi|Vahumana|Aetiology}}. My knowledge of the Ruin Golems is limited to the things I read in history books.
:'''Afratu:''' But if I can use this opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of ancient {{Rubi|Dahri|Khaenri'ah}}, it should be very helpful for my subsequent research.
----
{{Quest Description|update|A Ruin Golem in the desert seems to be attacking people in its vicinity at random. You have to find a way to get inside and shut it down...}}
;(After the Ruin Golem attacks)
:'''Paimon:''' Watch out!
:'''Paimon:''' That was scary! Paimon didn't expect it to actually fire beams at us!
:'''Paimon:''' But if we bait it into firing that way... We could get it to blow that big stone blocking the doorway open, right?

;(Break the rocks in front of the cave)
:'''Paimon:''' Woohoo! It worked! Paimon's pretty smart, huh?
:'''Paimon:''' Let's continue up ahead and take a look.

;(Walk deeper into the cave)
:'''Paimon:''' Look at all these strange parts! Looks like this is the road into this machine's interior!
:'''Paimon:''' Who knows? Maybe some sage has left some treasure in here.

;(Approach the first seal)
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, that over there's gotta be the seal that the Mahamata mentioned earlier.
:'''Paimon:''' Is that shiny thing over there the, uh, Flow stuff they were talking about? People from Sumeru really do like using vines as seals, huh?

;(Enter the mechanical pathway)
:'''Paimon:''' This mechanical pathway should lead us into the machine.
:'''Paimon:''' But y'know... Is this whole space just its arm?
----
;(Enter the robot)
;(If [[Vimana Agama: Jazari's Chapter]] has not been completed)
:'''Paimon:''' And here we are, finally! This place is much bigger than Paimon thought!
:'''Paimon:''' Doesn't look like this place has had any visitors lately... There's a whole load of vines around here...
:'''Paimon:''' But whatever! Next up, we've gotta look for the pilot cabin, right? That round thing up above looks pretty suspicious &mdash; let's start there!"

;(If [[Vimana Agama: Jazari's Chapter]] has been completed)
:'''Paimon:''' And we're in, finally! Well, this doesn't look so different from the last giant machine we were in!
:'''Paimon:''' Don't you think there's a few dozen vines too many around here?
:'''Paimon:''' Well, let's get to the pilot cabin first. We just need to turn that autonomous system thingy off!"

;(Read the "Old Orders" in the bottom floor, optional)
:'''Old Orders:''' ...Knight Commander Hadura, who has successfully led the operation to stall the beasts, is hereby conferred the title of "Sentinel of the Golden Hall"...
:'''Old Orders:''' ...by order of Marshal Regent Anfortas...

;(Approach the marked location)
:'''Paimon:''' Well, here's our seal. Doesn't look like anyone's tried to damage it either.
:'''Paimon:''' So we just need to find the Suda's Flow stuff that sustains the seal and then break them to enter, right?

;(Read the "Sealed Orders" in the center platform, optional)
:'''Sealed Orders:''' ...all remaining personnel should immediately abandon this machine upon completion of the mission and relocate to the Marshal's machine...
:'''Sealed Orders:''' ...it is a pity that due to our limited transportation capacity and the uncontrollable security risks, we can only provide the wounded with sufficient supplies and transfer them to a nearby safe zone for now. We will come back to them later...

;(Break all the Suda's Flows)
:'''Paimon:''' Well, that's the seal gone. Now we just need to get into the pilot cabin and turn the autonomous system off!

;(Turn off autonomous targeting)
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like it worked! Guess we can control that beam cannon manually now, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Well? Shall we give it a try?
----
;(Talk to Afratu)
:'''Afratu:''' How's the situation? I noticed the Ruin Golem was acting unusually. Was it because you switched its autonomous system off?
:{{DIcon}} Yep! It's all done, easy peasy!
::'''Afratu:''' Fantastic! The commission is complete then.
:{{DIcon}} Yep, we shut it down.
::'''Afratu:''' Great, then it should stop attacking nearby people now.
:'''Afratu:''' Did you discover any clues about why it suddenly became active?

:'''You tell Afratu about your discovery in the Ruin Golem.'''

:'''Afratu:''' Hmm, overgrown vines? Doesn't seem characteristic of the ecology of the desert. I'm not very sure what they are, but it sounds like they might be related to the Ley Lines.
:'''Afratu:''' I've received similar reports in the past about Ruin Machines with damaged cores being constantly "revived" due to the Ley Lines.
:'''Afratu:''' There may be many links between the Ley Lines and the machines created by the Dahri that we still do not know of.
:'''Afratu:''' And the seals of the ancient sages were created with energy from the Ley Lines, so if there's an anomaly in the Ley Lines...
:'''Afratu:''' If my deduction is correct, problems will start occurring in all the sealed Ruin Golems.
:{{DIcon}} That sounds like trouble.
:'''Afratu:''' Unfortunately, the only thing I can do is report it to the Akademiya. I can't deal with something like this on my own.
:'''Afratu:''' I originally came here to explore the ruins of the Dahri people. It had taken me quite some while to get approval from the Akademiya, and I even contacted the local chapter to come and get me.
:'''Afratu:''' Who would've thought that I'd run into this mess as soon as I stepped out of the city? But I'm in no position to decline a request from the Akademiya...
:'''Afratu:''' Now that the issue is resolved, I can finally continue with my fieldwork. I'll leave the rest to whoever else the Akademiya sends.
:'''Afratu:''' Please accept your rewards. May we meet again in the desert.
