==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Caron:''' If clocks are the score of time's song, then what can I do for it...
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to use this [[Crafting Bench]].
::'''Caron:''' Oh, please feel free.
:{{DIcon}} Tell me about the clocks...
::'''Caron:''' Clocks &mdash; or to be more precisely, exquisite clockwork-powered clocks &mdash; are our family craft, famous throughout Fontaine.
::'''Caron:''' Have you heard of the Lady of the Lake's Tear?
::'''Caron:''' That was the name Lady [[Furina]] gave to one of my works.
::'''Caron:''' What a lovely name, like a song that encapsulates such sadness.
:{{DIcon}} A lover of poetry, are we...
::'''Caron:''' Haha, yes, that unsightly attempt of mine. Now, I do not hate my work, but I also love poetry and song.
::'''Caron:''' My [[Livre|elder brother]] has gone on to live his own life, while I inherited the family business.
::'''Caron:''' It's quite unadventurous and unromantic of me, but I do not desire that this craft be lost.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry for bothering you.
::'''Caron:''' No worries. May time's song remember you.
