==Profile==
Jala is a merchant from [[Sumeru]]. She first started her business buying and selling junk and secondhand goods, until she met [[Lisa]] who was preparing to move back to her homeland and was selling everything she couldn't bring home, including the board and pieces for the "Shroomsplosion" game she had made. The game caught Jala's interest, and she was offered by Lisa to keep the game running for her. After selling a few copies of the game, Jala's income skyrocketed, giving her the capital she needed to start a real business. The experience inspired Jala, and she adopted Lisa's work-life balance philosophy and started living happily every day.

After hearing that Lisa's homeland was [[Mondstadt]], Jala dreamed of coming to Mondstadt one day in order to have business there and experience its people and culture. When she first arrived in Mondstadt sometime before the events of [[Dodoco's Bomb-Tastic Adventure]], she followed a superstition from merchants in [[Fontaine]] of releasing animals to the wild before doing something important for luck. This caused an [[Anglers|invasive species]] of fish from Sumeru to suddenly appear in [[Cider Lake]], threatening its ecology and, consequently, Mondstadt's wine industry and economy. This was eventually discovered by [[Klee]], which subsequently triggered an inspection by the [[Knights of Favonius#Investigation|Investigation Team]] to find out how the invasive species came to Mondstadt. Meanwhile, Jala struck a deal with [[Blanche]], where the former will supply the latter with Sumeru ingredients, spices, and tableware to sell in [[Mondstadt General Goods]].

The [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] may find Jala's campsite around [[Brightcrown Canyon]]'s coast, upon which they can choose to leave her alone, arrest her, or lead her to talking with the [[Knights of Favonius]] near Mondstadt's gate. If she is arrested, [[Porthos]] will inform the Traveler and Paimon that they originally had thought that the culprit fled towards [[Dornman Port]], which is why the Knights couldn't track her down. Porthos also said that Jala was cooperating with the investigation, and that she would just be fined accordingly. If the Traveler chose to not personally arrest her, they simply trick her into coming straight to the capital, by asking her if she wanted to try out Mondstadt's local specialties. This reminds Jala about trying out said specialties by setting out to [[Good Hunter]]. Paimon wonders if she'll be arrested immediately as she'll be talking to one of knights stationed, but the former hopes that the Knights of Favonius will understand that the latter is a good person.

Regardless of what the Traveler does, after the event, Jala can be found just outside of Mondstadt's gate, feeling extremely saddened and remorseful of what she's done. She was lectured by the Knights of Favonius and fined an amount relatively huge to her income; she eventually cried on the road about what she had done but was comforted by Klee who gave her snacks. She promised to never release animals into the wild again and planned on donating another shipment to Mondstadt and apologizing to the people affected by her mistake.

====Dialogue Set #1====
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Jala:''' Oh, how relaxing! The forests of Mondstadt are indeed a great place for camping! This business trip is so worth it!
:'''Jala:''' The humidity and temperature are just perfect, so my clothes won't get drenched in sweat whenever I try to do a bit of work. The sunlight is not too glaring, and there's even a nice fragrance in the air!
:{{DIcon}} You are?
::'''Jala:''' Oh! New friends! Please, sit! Have some tea, let's eat and chat together!
::'''Jala:''' I'm Jala. I'm a merchant from Sumeru. I just closed a big deal, and right now, I'm enjoying the natural beauty of Mondstadt!
::'''Paimon:''' It's the first time we've met someone camping in this area.
::'''Paimon:''' Shouldn't a merchant be... guarding their shop and cargo? If you hadn't told us, we would never have guessed what you are!
::'''Jala:''' Oh, merchants are people too, we also need rest. Who doesn't have a few hobbies? Work-life balance, you know, work-life balance...
::'''Jala:''' You know, back in Sumeru, even students tormented by their studies all the time value this. They even invent games to help themselves relax!
::'''Jala:''' I earned my first big haul by distributing a tabletop game invented by a [[Lisa|student]], called Shroomsplosion!
::'''Jala:''' That genius student once said, "There's always more work. One must learn to take some time to... take a break~".
::'''Jala:''' She brought me wealth beyond my wildest imagination, so I took her words as my motto! Sure enough, I live happily every day!
::{{DIcon}} That name sounds oddly familiar...
::{{DIcon}} The student you're talking about wouldn't happen to be...
::'''Paimon:''' J&mdash;Jala! Can you tell us more about how you came to distribute that "Shroomsplosion" game?
::'''Jala:''' Huh? You've also heard of it? It's already a really old game... Was it years or over a decade ago? Oh, how time flies...
::'''Jala:''' It was quite a coincidence, really. At the time, she was going to return to her homeland, so she sold everything she couldn't bring with her, including the game's pieces and board.
::'''Jala:''' Back then I bought and sold junk and secondhand goods. When I had the fortune to run into her, I asked her about the pieces, and it reminded her that the game she invented may still be of some use... So she briefly walked me through it...
::'''Jala:''' She said, if I was willing, I could try to keep the game running. I made a few copies, and they sold really well! My income just boom! Exploded upward!
::'''Jala:''' Though Shroomsplosion didn't stay popular for long and was replaced by other similar games, it did earn me enough capital to start a real business. I no longer had to rely on selling junk to make a living.
::'''Jala:''' You could say that the unintentional act of a student genius changed my life!
::{{DIcon}} Could it really be coincidence!?
::{{DIcon}} Just giving away her creation like that!?
::'''Paimon:''' Now that Paimon thinks about it, it does seem like something she would do... Perhaps she actually invented quite a few games, and "Shroomsplosion" just wasn't that important to her?
::'''Paimon:''' Or, in terms of business, she probably felt managing the rights of the games was really troublesome... She probably couldn't be bothered with it and felt her time worth more than the [[Mora]] she'd earn.
::'''Jala:''' Right? Don't you think it was amazing?
::'''Jala:''' Later, I heard that her home was Mondstadt, and since then, Mondstadt has become one of my favorite places to go!
::'''Jala:''' So, for many years, I've been trying to find the chance to finally come to Mondstadt to do business and see what the culture and people are like for myself!
::'''Jala:''' I have to say, it didn't disappoint! I closed a big deal and had a great time here!
::'''Jala:''' I sincerely suggest you trying it for yourselves. Find a good work-life balance, and give your life a comfortable rhythm!
:{{DIcon|Quest}} Business?
::'''Jala:''' Oh? You're locals? Want to join me for a cup of soup or some food?
::'''Paimon:''' How hospitable! Are you a... camping enthusiast?
::'''Jala:''' Ha! Well, you wouldn't be completely wrong to say that! I'm Jala, a merchant from Sumeru. Perhaps you'll become familiar with my name soon.
::'''Jala:''' Once I get approval, you'll be able to purchase my goods from Miss Blanche! I offer unique Sumeru ingredients, spices, and tableware, all at a fair price!
::'''Jala:''' I have to say, Mondstadters are so amicable. We reached an agreement really fast without much haggling!
::'''Jala:''' Not that the people in Sumeru are bad-tempered... We just tend to care more about details... and would spend quite a long time negotiating prices for bulk orders...
::{{DIcon}} There must be straight-forward people in Sumeru too!
::{{DIcon}} There must be business-savvy Mondstadters, too!
::'''Paimon:''' Yeah. There are all kinds of people everywhere! You can't generalize about people like that!
::'''Paimon:''' Maybe your past business deals didn't go so smoothly because of bad luck. But this time in Mondstadt, maybe you just got lucky?
::'''Jala:''' Got lucky?
::'''Jala:''' Right! When I first got to Mondstadt, I released a few fish for luck... That must be what brought me luck and led me to my ideal business partner!
::'''Paimon:''' You released... a few fish?
::'''Jala:''' That's right! Since it feels like we are bound by destiny, let me tell you a secret I learned from merchants in Fontaine that only a few people from Sumeru know...
::'''Jala:''' Before doing something important, release some animals into the wild. It will bring you good fortune! Some even buy animals just to release them!
::'''Jala:''' If you are hunters or something like that, you can consider doing it too! You lose a few Mora in exchange for lots of good luck! It's really a good deal!
::'''Paimon:''' (Hey, {{Traveler}}... The sudden apperance of Anglers in Cider Lake... Do you think it's because of...)
::{{DIcon}} (This merchant is the culprit...)
::{{DIcon}} (How careless could she be...)
::'''Paimon:''' (She's completely oblivious to the mess she made... So? Should we tell her? After all, it's already gotten really serious!)
::'''Paimon:''' (Or should we just arrest her on the spot and let the Knights of Favonius decide her fate?)
::(Hm... Such a difficult decision! It feels like she's a warm-hearted person, and she was just trying to be hospitable to us... Turning on her now makes it feel like we're the bad guys here...)
::{{DIcon|Quest}} (As an Honorary Knight, I cannot stand idly by!)
:::'''Paimon:''' Then... Sorry, but we have no choice, Miss Jala!
:::'''Paimon:''' Please understand, as you've unintentionally caused significant damage and violated the laws of Mondstadt... We have no choice but to do this!
:::'''Jala:''' Huh? What are you talking about?
:::'''Jala:''' Wait... Why are you getting ready for a fight... Are you going hunting?
:::'''Jala:''' No need! No need at all! I still have lots of food here...
:::'''Jala:''' Waaaaaah!
:::{{Black Screen|''Before Jala can react, you and Paimon charge at her and knock her out with just the right amount of force, before putting her on your shoulders and carrying her back to the Knights of Favonious headquarters...''}}
::;(Teleports to the front of Knights of Favonious Headquarters)
:::'''Porthos:''' Oh, Hononary Knight and The Helper in White. You are truly impressive, capturing the fugitive just like that!
:::'''Porthos:''' When my colleague and I first identified her as a suspect, after we confirmed her identity and time of departure, we mistakenly predicted she had fled in the direction of Dornman Port... We were just about to go after her on a ship...
:::'''Porthos:''' We didn't expect her to be hiding deep inside the Brightcrown Mountains. No wonder we coudn't track her down... She sure has some excellent counter-surveillance skills!
:::'''Paimon:''' Uh... Paimon doesn't think she tried to evade at all... She didn't even know what happened...
:::'''Paimon:''' Nevertheless, Jala did make a big mistake, but she never meant for any of it to happen. Please don't be too harsh on her!
:::'''Porthos:'''  Of course! I heard she's been quite cooperative. When criminals are cooperative, we will also be calm and rational when dealing with them.
:::'''Porthos:''' The investigation team reports that the current situation can be managed. We just need to go through the standard procedures, assess the damages, and then fine her accordingly.
:::{{DIcon}} That'll be enough punishment.
:::{{DIcon}} She's not a bad person, after all.
:::'''Paimon:''' Whew... Didn't think we would take part in this incident... So this is what it feels like to capture a criminal as a knight!
:::'''Paimon:''' Anyway, it's a relief that Jala was just careless and not trying to sabotage Mondstadt's wine industry...
:::'''Paimon:''' If we had caught a vicious, super noisy criminal who has no remorse, it would really have spoiled our good mood!
:::'''Paimon:''' Paimon hopes Jala has learned her lesson and won't be too upset about her punishment...
::{{DIcon|Quest}} (I really don't want to arrogate the authority to myself...)
:::'''Paimon:''' (Arrogate? What's with that weird term, all of a sudden? Paimon thinks [[Wanderer's Trail|she's heard it before somewhere]]...)
:::'''Paimon:''' (Do you mean, arresting suspects is a responsibility of other knights? We cannot do some other knight's job... and steal the credit?)
:::'''Paimon:''' (Hmm... It does make sense. Although Jala committed a crime, she doesn't seem like a bad person... Even a regular knight could apprehend her easily.)
:::'''Paimon:''' (For regular knights, this is an opportunity to acquire some easy merit. It really doesn't matter to us. We should just let them take care of it...)
:::'''Paimon:''' (But Jala is in a very secluded location. The knights might not be able to locate her easily... We have to get Jala back to Mondstadt somehow.)
:::'''Jala:''' What are you whispering about? Are you also interested in the theory behind releasing animals for luck?
:::'''Paimon:''' Oh! We... We heard you talking about fish, so we're wondering what we should have for dinner!
:::{{DIcon}} I find myself suddenly craving some grilled fish.
:::{{DIcon}} Have you ever had [[Mondstadt Grilled Fish]]?
:::'''Paimon:''' Huh? Hm... Oh! Right, right, right!
:::'''Paimon:''' Since you are here in Mondstadt, you gotta try Mondstadt Grilled Fish! It's so fragrant and convenient! Oh, and also [[Sticky Honey Roast]], [["Pile 'Em Up"]] and [[Flaming Red Bolognese]]!
:::'''Jala:''' Oh! You just reminded me of something!
:::'''Jala:''' I was so focused on my business deal and taking a scenic tour of Mondstadt that I completely forgot to enioy some nice local specialties!
:::'''Jala:''' I heard there's a restaurant called Good Hunter in Mondstadt that offers great food at a good price and even provides delivery services! So I placed a few days' worth of orders without giving it much thought...
:::'''Jala:''' But I forgot to ask about local specialties at that time, and the deliveryperson may not be able to find where I set up camp...
:::'''Paimon:''' Say, why not just go back to Mondstadt and enjoy a good meal?
:::'''Jala:''' Right! I'll also ask the locals about other Mondstadt specialties to take back with me as souvenirs for my friends!
:::'''Jala:''' If I remember correctly, there are two knights stationed by the gates. They should be quite knowledgeable of Mondstadt and could give me some good recommendations!
:::'''Jala:''' You know what? I'm going back right now!
:::{{Black Screen|''Jala leaves the campsite with enthusiasm, heading back toward Mondstadt.''}} 
:::'''Paimon:''' Jala even suggested talking to the knights herself... Paimon wonders if she'll get arrested on the spot...
:::'''Paimon:''' But perhaps the knights will understand that her actions were unintentional... No one who deliberately caused trouble would willingly come to talk to the knights. right?
:::{{DIcon}} Jala likely won't be punished severely.
:::{{DIcon}} We solved the problem peacefully.
:::'''Paimon:''' Yeah! Paimon still feels bad about this, but people have to take responsiblity for their mistakes!
:::'''Paimon:''' Paimon only hopes Jala realizes her mistake soon and won't get too upset after being punished...
:{{DIcon}} (She's enjoying her leisure time. Let's not disturb her...)
::'''Paimon:''' (Good point. People who make camp in secluded places like this prefer their privacy... Let's just leave.)

====Dialogue Set #2====
;(After finishing the last event challenge)
:'''Jala:''' *whimper* *sob*
:'''Jala:''' How could this happen... I'm not malicious... I never meant for any of this to happen...
;(If Jala was neither arrested nor lead to talking with the Knights of Favonius in Mondstadt)
:{{DIcon}} What happened to you?
::'''Paimon:''' You don't look like you're from Mondstadt. Why are you standing here all alone and crying? Did you run into trouble?
::'''Jala:''' Oh... Hello...
::'''Jala:''' I just left the Knights of Favonius headquarters... I was given a huge fine and a lecture...
::'''Jala:''' Though the Knights were all polite and nice, and they just patiently explained everything to me... I still feel so bad about what I did and regret it so much!
::'''Jala:''' I... I did a bad thing without thinking... by releasing them.
::{{DIcon}} Releasing?
::'''Paimon:''' Releasing... It doesn't sound like a bad thing... But it does sound a bit familiar...
::'''Jala:''' I once thought... releasing animals, such an act of kindness, the more you do it, the better, but now I know I was wrong, oh so wrong...
::'''Jala:''' I am a merchant from Sumeru... A friend of mine who went to Fontaine told me of a secret that's only known to a selected few...
::'''Jala:''' "Before doing something important, release some animals into the wild. It will bring you good fortune. Some even buy animals just to release them..."
::'''Jala:''' So I released a few Sumeru-native Anglers into Cider Lake before going to my business meeting.
::'''Jala:''' I didn't know the Anglers had no natural enemies in Cider Lake and were multiplying so quickly, almost to the point of destroying the lake's ecosystem...
::'''Jala:''' Fortunately, the Knights of Mondstadt are capable and reliable. They handled it before it got out of control. Otherwise... Otherwise, I'd have become a villain, condemned by history for all time to come!
::'''Paimon:''' So it was you!
::'''Paimon:''' Uh... But you didn't know what you were doing... You didn't do it intentionally and you've already been punished for it... So, Paimon shouldn't criticize you any more...
::'''Jala:''' O&mdash;Of course it was never my intention to harm Mondstadt! I've always felt Mondstadt is a really great country!
::'''Jala:''' The fact I've been able to become a merchant trading between nations is all thanks to a student from Mondstadt who studied at [[Sumeru Akademiya|the Akademiya]]...
::'''Jala:''' A few years ago, before she returned to her home, she entrusted me with the distribution of a game she developed called Shroomsplosion. It became a hit, and earned me substantial capital, which became my startup fund.
::'''Jala:''' Mondstadters really are incredibly friendly. They didn't treat me very harshly, even though I made such a big mess...
::'''Jala:''' There was a little girl in red who saw me crying by the road, and she even comforted me with lots of snacks...
::'''Jala:''' Though the fine itself was huge to me, it merely covered the losses incurred and the salaries of the knights sent to do damage control...
::'''Paimon:''' Well, as long as you can learn from your mistakes. The issue has been resolved, so you don't have to be so hard on yourself now!
::{{DIcon}} Just don't go randomly releasing creatures again!
::{{DIcon}} And remember to tell your friends that.
::'''Jala:''' Of course! I will remember this lesson! Always!
::'''Jala:''' Perhaps... I should donate another shipment to Mondstadt... and then go apologize in person to those Mondstadters who were affected by my actions...
;(If Jala was lead to talking with the Knights of Favonius in Mondstadt)
:{{DIcon}} You really aren't bad at all...
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Looks like Miss Jala really was discovered by the Knights of Favonius.
::'''Jala:''' Oh, it's you two! We meet again!
::'''Jala:''' I... I told you about releasing animals before, right?&nbsp;...Don't ever do it!
::'''Jala:''' When I returned to Mondstadt to ask about the local specialties, two knights immediately arrested me at the gates!
::'''Jala:''' I left the Knights of Favonius headquarters not long ago... I was given a huge fine and a lecture...
::'''Jala:''' I had no idea the Anglers I released had no natural enemies in Cider Lake and were multiplying so quickly, almost to the point of destroying the lake's ecosystem!
::'''Jala:''' Fortunately, the Knights of Mondstadt are capable and reliable. They handled it before it got out of control. Otherwise... Otherwise, I'd have become a villain, condemned by history for all time to come!
::'''Jala:''' Though the Knights were all polite and nice, and they just patiently explained everything to me...
::'''Jala:''' Mondstadters really are incredibly friendly. They didn't resent or shun me, even though I made such a big mess...
::'''Jala:''' There was a little girl in red who saw me crying by the road, and she even comforted me with lots of snacks...
::'''Jala:''' Though the fine itself was huge to me, it merely covered the losses incurred and the salaries of the knights sent to do damage control...
::'''Jala:''' I just feel so bad about what I did! I really regret it!
::'''Paimon:''' Well, as long as you can learn from your mistakes. The issue has been resolved, so you don't have to be so hard on yourself now!
::{{DIcon}} Just don't go randomly releasing creatures again!
::{{DIcon}} And remember to tell your friends that.
::'''Jala:''' Of course! I will remember this lesson! Always!
::'''Jala:''' Perhaps... I should donate another shipment to Mondstadt... and then go apologize in person to those Mondstadters who were affected by my actions...
;(If Jala was arrested)
:{{DIcon}} We meet again...
::'''Jala:''' Oh, it's you two!
::'''Jala:''' I'm sorry! When I mentioned releasing the fish, I should have gotten down on my knees and admitted my terrible mistake...
::'''Jala:''' I had no idea the Anglers I released had no natural enemies in Cider Lake and were multiplying so quickly, almost to the point of destroying the lake's ecosystem!
::'''Paimon:''' Huh? Uh... Um... You did do something bad to Mondstadt... But why are you apologizing to us?
::'''Jala:''' Because I caused you a lot of trouble too! You had to come all this way just to arrest me... It must be exhausting carrying me back to Mondstadt!
::'''Jala:''' If only I had come to my senses earlier and willingly gone back to Mondstadt to give myself up... Wait, no, if only I realized what I had done the moment I released them and just turned myself in to the Knights of Favonius...
::'''Jala:''' Then I wouldn't have cost you so much time and effort... and the Knights of Favonius wouldn't have had to mobilize so many people to investigate.
::{{DIcon}} You're admitting your guilt and showing remorse quite sincerely!
::{{DIcon}} Now I feel bad about resorting to violence...
::'''Paimon:''' If you hadn't believed those rumors and refrained from releasing the fish in the first place, we wouldn't be in this mess...
::'''Jala:''' True...
::'''Jala:''' I left the Knights of Favonius headquarters not long ago... I was given a huge fine and a lecture...
::'''Jala:''' Fortunately, the Knights of Mondstadt are capable and reliable. They handled it before it got out of control. Otherwise... Otherwise, I'd have become a villain, condemned by history for all time to come!
::'''Jala:''' Though the Knights were all polite and nice, and they just patiently explained everything to me...

:{{DIcon}} Leave quietly with Paimon...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Invasive Fish Wrangler===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Jala:''' How about it, Honorary Knight and Helper in White? Catching some pre-corralled fish should be as easy as... Well, shooting fish in a barrel, right?
:{{DIcon|Invasive Fish Wrangler}} Let's start fishing and cooking!
::'''Jala:''' You two look raring to go... let's see what you've got!
:{{DIcon}} We'll shoot those fish up real good!
::'''Paimon:''' But... Paimon has a question. You mentioned a bunch of "merchants who hold strange beliefs." What's their deal?
::'''Paimon:''' They're the ones who caused this mess. They should be the ones in the barrel right now!
::'''Jala:''' Those guys... I wouldn't call most of them malicious. Just overly naive...
::'''Jala:''' ...Who trusted this rumor: "Release some animals into the wild before you do anything important. It will bring you good fortune!"
::'''Jala:''' People like that have spread from Sumeru to regions all over [[Teyvat]], calling themselves "The Unchained." Some merchants caught the scent of the business opportunity at hand...
::'''Jala:''' ...And they started smuggling various animals from all over and used strange feed to make them look more beautiful, before selling them off to members of The Unchained at exorbitant prices.
::'''Paimon:''' That's crazy! What sort of people would fall for that?
::'''Jala:''' The same sort who'd fall for something as silly as "releasing animals brings you good fortune," that's who.
::'''Jala:''' The way some see it, releasing more expensive or beautiful animals accumulates more "merit."
::{{DIcon}} If they're so eager to part with their Mora, I'm right here.
:::'''Paimon:''' Geez, all that Mora down the drain for nothing&mdash; no, less than nothing, considering the trouble they've caused others! The only ones who profited are those scummy merchants!
::{{DIcon}} And if it's worthy, convincing causes they need, I'm right here.
:::'''Paimon:''' That's right! Giving {{Traveler}} Mora guarantees you some help with your problem, at least!
::'''Jala:''' Don't worry. [[Enghiene|An officer]] from the [[Maison Gardiennage]] is following the clues I provided to track down those charlatans. We'll know the outcome soon enough.
::'''Jala:''' We won't need you two to personally catch the culprits this time, Honorary Knight and Helper in White!
:{{DIcon}} Putting that aside, have we met before?
::'''Paimon:''' Right! You're dressed like you're from Sumeru, but you called {{Traveler}} Honorary Knight, and Paimon the Helper in White, which is what the people in Mondstadt say...
::'''Jala:''' Ah, right. I understand your confusion.
::'''Jala:''' Everyone in Mondstadt says you two can do the work of seven, eight, or even ten people in one day, so you must've met many fascinating people on your travels. By contrast, I doubt you'd remember someone like me, no matter how sharp your mind&mdash;
::'''Jala:''' [[Dodoco's Bomb-Tastic Adventure|A long time ago]], I too believed that releasing animals could bring me fortune. When I was in Mondstadt for business, I released some invasive fish from Sumeru into Cider Lake and caused a whole lot of trouble...
::{{DIcon}} So that was you!
:::'''Paimon:''' Oh! You were having a picnic at Cider Lake back then, weren't you?
:::'''Jala:''' That's right. After encountering you two there, I realized my error and accepted the punishment I deserved.
::{{DIcon}} That's not ringing any bells...
:::'''Paimon:''' Paimon kinda remembers an incident of that sort...
:::'''Jala:''' Well, the details are best left in the past anyway. So, after meeting you two, I saw the error of my ways and accepted the punishment I deserved.
::'''Jala:''' Fortunately, the situation wasn't yet unsalvageable, and the good people in the Knights of Favonius managed to fix my mess, but the dread stuck with me...
::'''Jala:''' After returning to Sumeru, I tried to warn those who habitually released animals. Some were willing to listen, some ignored me, and some started antagonizing me.
::'''Jala:''' As someone who messed up badly in the past, I can't bear to see others repeat my mistakes...
::'''Jala:''' So I read up more on the subject and worked with relevant organizations within the Akademiya to help the "[[Corps of Thirty]]" track down The Unchained and those crooked merchants alike.
::'''Jala:''' The latter are active in many nations, so I've been traveling a lot. This time, as you can see, my quarry is a Fontainian.
::'''Jala:''' I have the relevant documents and proof from the Akademiya on hand. The Maison Gardiennage also has a record of similar cases in the past. And considering how I've hit it off with the local officers, we'll have the culprit behind bars in no time.
::{{DIcon}} Congratulations on turning things around!
::{{DIcon}} A little brutal, but well played!
::'''Paimon:''' From someone who made mistakes to someone who stops others from making them... Paimon's seeing you in a whole new way, Jala!
::'''Jala:''' Well, I couldn't have done it without your help.
::'''Jala:''' The Maison Gardiennage has paid me a considerable commission for this. Since traveling expenses are all I need, I'll leave the rest to you two as a token of my gratitude!
:{{DIcon}} I've got something else to do right now...
::'''Jala:''' No worries! I'm sure you'll settle this in no time, even if you do only show up later!
