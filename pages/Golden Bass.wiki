|description = A type of fish commonly found in bodies of water everywhere. Their meat is sumptuous, making them an important resource for fish-related gourmet dishes in Teyvat.<br>Golden Basses are a much less common sight than Black-Back or Blue-Fin variants. It is said that such fish can bring the one who catches them good luck.<br>There were once those who peddled protective talismans and blessing cards made in the image of Golden Basses in the city streets of [[Liyue Harbor]]. It was also a common saying in [[Inazuma]] that the golden setting sun was like a Golden Bass swimming across the skies.

Catching one for the first time will add this creature's entry into your in-game [[archive]].

==Trivia==
*The Golden Bass may be inspired by a combination of the namesake of a {{w|goldfish}} and the anatomy of a {{w|Bass (fish)|bass}}.
**If this is the case, it may explain why all [[Bass|bass variants]] can be found in both freshwater bodies, lakes and rivers, and in saltwater, at the sea.
