{{Description|A type of fish commonly found in bodies of water everywhere. Their meat is sumptuous, making them an important resource for fish-related gourmet dishes in Teyvat.<br />Golden Basses are a much less common sight than Black-Back or Blue-Fin variants. It is said that such fish can bring the one who catches them good luck.<br />There were once those who peddled protective talismans and blessing cards made in the image of Golden Basses in the city streets of [[Liyue Harbor]]. It was also a common saying in [[Inazuma]] that the golden setting sun was like a Golden Bass swimming across the skies.|in-game description from the [[Archive]]}}
