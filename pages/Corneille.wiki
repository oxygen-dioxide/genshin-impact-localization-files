==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Corneille:''' Ah, I'm quite curious as to how this will end...
:{{DIcon}} What sort of end are we talking about?
::'''Corneille:''' I mean the end of a play, of course!
::'''Corneille:''' Or... Well, there are some cases that have gone into session several times, but with no result. To be honest, they seem all the same to me.
::{{DIcon}} That doesn't sound like a very rigorous distinction to me.
::'''Corneille:''' But does it matter, really? A criminal is a criminal &mdash; someone who's done wrong. Any case involving them is sure to become a talking point regardless.
::'''Corneille:''' And I'm a law-abiding citizen &mdash; I'm never going to touch the law's bottom line.
::'''Corneille:''' Besides, watching trials is a way of studying the law as well.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Corneille:''' Hmm. Let's review the plot again...
