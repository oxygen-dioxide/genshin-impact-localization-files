[[Version 2.1]]
*The English translation for the following line was revised:
**'''{{Color|Old}}:''' '''Zhongli:''' People abandon and surrender the things they love to pursue the right path. Perhaps this is the erosion imposed on me by the ''natural order of this world''.
**'''{{Color|New}}:''' '''Zhongli:''' People abandon and surrender the things they love to pursue the right path. Perhaps this is the erosion imposed on me by the ''Heavenly Principles''.

[[Version 1.6]]
*The description text for a cutscene was revised:
**'''{{Color|Old}}:''' Zhongli tells you the story of when he carved a dragon from stone and brought it to life back in the days when he roamed the lands under the name Morax. The dragon, named Azhdaha, signed a contract with Morax and joined him in countless legendary battles to pacify the lands.
**'''{{Color|New}}:''' You listen to the story of how Zhongli &mdash; while he yet walked the earth as Morax &mdash; discovered the elemental being Azhdaha and gave him eyes. This giant dragon signed a contract with Morax and accompanied him on many campaigns throughout the land, leaving many legends behind.
*Fixes an issue whereby there is an error with the English voice-over for the line "My life is nigh on eternal. I will go on with the infinite flow of time. And you, Morax... You too will live for many a day to come." such that it does not match the subtitle.
