'''Commissions''' are a type of [[Quest]] that players receive daily.

In [[lore]] they are provided to the [[Traveler]] by the [[Adventurers' Guild]].

==Overview==
===Daily Reset===
Each [[Daily Reset]], players will receive four commissions (0–2 [[Commission/List#NPC Commissions|NPC commissions]] and 2–4 [[Commission/List#Basic Commissions|basic commissions]]), viewable through the [[Quest Menu]] or the [[Adventurer Handbook]].
Commissions are randomly selected from a pool of all available commissions for the set location.
Incomplete commissions do not carry over to the next day and are replaced on daily reset.
It is possible to get duplicate commissions on the same day.

While each commission can only be completed once, players through [[Co-Op Mode]] may complete as many commissions as they wish.

===Location===
Commissions will replace normal enemies and objects in their area, including [[Chest]]s, until the commission is completed and the area is reloaded. Conversely, if a location or an NPC is currently occupied by any quest, commissions that require the same location or NPC will not occur. For example, if the [[Chivalric Training]] hangout event is currently active and in its "Training Ground" scene, the [[Ellin, the Wannabe Knight]] daily commission gets blocked and will not occur until the scene is cleared or the hangout event abandoned.

====Preferred Region====
[[File:Adventurer Handbook Commissions.png|200px|thumb|<center>Preferred Region in the top right corner]]
In the Adventurer Handbook players can choose to assign a preferred region in which they wish to be given their commissions, provided they have unlocked it. By default it will be set to "Random" and commissions' locations will be randomly chosen from all the unlocked regions. Only commissions in [[Area]]s that have already been filled in on the [[Map]] by activating the corresponding [[Statue of The Seven]] will be chosen.
<br>Settings take effect on the next Daily Reset.
<br>Emergency quests (including certain NPC follow-up quests) may still appear outside of the preferred region.

===Adventure Encounters===
{{Main|Adventure Encounters}}
Players may obtain Encounter Points by completing [[Quest]]s, opening treasure chests, collecting certain [[Item]]s and participating in [[Event]]s. Encounter Points may be exchanged to claim commission rewards, while those commissions can still be completed they will not provide additional rewards.

===Commissions With Incomplete Achievements===
Commissions with related incomplete [[achievement]]s:
* Have a much higher probability to appear than other commissions.
* Will bypass the [[Commission#Cycle Theory|cycle limit]] (but not the conditions that unlock them, block them, or remove them from the cycle pool), effectively having unlimited number of repeats until their achievements are obtained.
** When an achievement requires the completion of different commissions, all commissions involved will bypass the cycle limit, even if a commission is no longer needed. For example, if the achievement ''[[A Nourishing Friendship]]'' has not yet been obtained, then ''both'' of the requisite quests, ''[[Fishing Jiangxue]]'' and ''[[Yanxiao's Dilemma]]'', bypass the cycle limit until the achievement is obtained, even if the player has already completed one of the quests and that quest is no longer in their cycle.

==Requirements==
Commissions are unlocked upon reaching [[Adventure Rank]] 12 and completing the {{Quest|Every Day a New Adventure}}.

Some commissions require completion of specific prerequisite quests or commissions before they are added to the commission pool.

===Regions===
Initially, only commissions in [[Mondstadt]] are available. Commissions for other regions can be unlocked by fulfilling their requirements:
* [[Liyue]]: Complete {{Quest|For a Tomorrow Without Tears;New Horizons of Adventure}}
* [[Inazuma]]: Complete {{Quest|The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia;Katheryne in Inazuma}}
* [[Sumeru]]: Complete {{Quest|The Morn a Thousand Roses Brings;Adventure Takes Courage! (World Quest)}}
* [[Fontaine]]: Complete {{Quest|As Light Rain Falls Without Reason;Another Horizon of Adventure}}
* [[Natlan]]: Complete {{Quest|Flowers Resplendent on the Sun-Scorched Sojourn;Toward Red-Hot Adventure!}}

==Rewards==
===Individual===
While the players may, either through Co-Op Mode or claiming the rewards through Adventure Encounters first, complete more commissions, a maximum of '''4''' commission rewards can be claimed each day.

Rewards are scaled based on the Adventure Rank at the time the commission was assigned.<ref group="Note" name="Ascension Note">If the player is currently prevented from [[Adventure_Rank#World_Level_and_Ascension|Ascension]] due to not having completed the relevant Adventure Rank Ascension quest(s), but at the same time has all the Adventure EXP required to reach Adventure Rank 60, should the ascension quest be done, the relevant Adventure EXP will be converted to [[Mora]] at a 1 to 10 ratio.</ref>
<br>
Most commissions grant the following rewards upon completion:
{{Commission Rewards|full|tableonly=1}}

Some commissions (usually special NPC commissions that do not involve combat) grant reduced rewards:
{{Commission Rewards|low|tableonly=1}}

Some NPC commissions grant additional commission specific rewards, independent of all commission reward rules and limitations. <!--If someone could test if you can get these in coop that could be added to the coop section -->

===Bonus===
After claiming all '''4''' daily commission rewards, reporting back to the Adventurers' Guild at any branch grants bonus rewards<ref group="Note"  name="Ascension Note"></ref>:

|}

In addition to the rewards above, the player also receives an [[Adventure Treasure Pack]] which gives one 2{{Star}} [[Character Ascension Material]].

===Story Keys===
[[File:Story Key Points.png|200px|thumb|<center>Points counter at the bottom left corner of the image]]
After Adventure Rank 26, every commission completed will store a point up to 8, using these 8 points players can claim one [[Story Key]]. Up to 3 Story Keys can be held at a time. However, since up to 8 points can be stored, players can effectively hold a 4th key.
<br>Story Keys are used to unlock some [[Story Quest]]s and [[Hangout Event]]s.

;Notes
{{Reflist|group=Note}}

==Co-Op==
In [[Co-Op Mode]], the host is the only player that can:
*activate commissions related to a [[Ley Line Monolith]], [[Transport Balloon]], or [[Slime Balloon]].
*advance commissions with dialogue.

Commissions that require submitting an item as well as [[Pigeons Go AWOL]] cannot be advanced or started in Co-Op. However, most commissions with item submission requirements '''can''' still be completed if the host player submits the item in single player (and waits on the next dialogue step) and then immediately accepts a request for someone to join their world before completing the commission dialogue. 

Claiming daily commission rewards via the [[Adventure Encounters]] system will '''only''' count as completion for the player using the system, not the entire Co-Op party, although the player will receive doubled Companionship EXP as outlined below.

The daily bonus from the Adventurers' Guild for claiming all 4 daily commission rewards cannot be claimed in Co-Op.

===Rewards===
When claiming commission rewards in Co-Op Mode with 2 or more players:
* The amount of Companionship EXP rewarded is doubled.
* All players receive rewards based on what was completed:
** Rewards from commission quests are based on the host's Adventure Rank
** Rewards from Adventure Encounters are based on the Adventure Rank of the person claiming them

Players are still subject to the same '''4''' commission reward limitation.

==Cycle Theory==
Each region has its own pool of NPC commissions. A commission will "spawn" a certain number of times per cycle, with the number varying based on the commission. Completing one instance of a commission removes it from the pool until the next cycle. Uncompleted commissions remain in the pool of the current cycle. A cycle will not end while at least one NPC commission remains incomplete. Commissions can be left incomplete and thus retained in the current cycle without sacrificing daily commission rewards by using Adventure Encounters or completing any commission in Co-Op Mode. Non-NPC commissions do not affect NPC commissions.<ref>HoYoLAB:[https://www.hoyolab.com/creatorCollection/482990 Cycle Theory]</ref><ref>HoYoLAB: [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/16634545 <nowiki>[Analysis] Proving Commission Cycle Theory</nowiki>]</ref>
