:'''Ossie:''' As I've gotten older, my memory's gone down the pan... But thinking back to my youth, it wasn't too hot to begin with, haha.
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like there's a story in there.
::'''Ossie:''' What's there to tell? Whether your memory's good or bad, life's still life.
::'''Ossie:''' Has having a bad memory ever caused problems for me? Not really, aside from forgetting lyrics while I was singing.
::'''Ossie:''' But that's all ancient history now! You wouldn't believe it, but one time, I completely blanked out while I was performing between matches during the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]]. That was quite the thrill...
::'''Ossie:''' It's just lucky that the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]] have a habit of writing rather "classical" sounding lyrics. No one even knows what they mean half the time, so your audience won't notice when you go off piste, hehe.
::{{DIcon}} That is indeed a "precious" memory.
::'''Ossie:''' You could call my "amnesia" a blessing in disguise, haha.
::'''Ossie:''' Hear me now, having a bad memory isn't always a bad thing. The less you remember, the less obsessive you become.
::'''Ossie:''' Take that "Granny Itztli" [[Citlali]], for instance. It's been how many years, and she still can't let that unfinished serial novel of hers go!
::'''Ossie:''' *sigh* What was it called again... Heh, I've forgotten...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Ossie:''' Goodbye! I hope I'll still remember you the next time we meet.
