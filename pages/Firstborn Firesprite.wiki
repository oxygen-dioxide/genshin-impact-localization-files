'''Firstborn Firesprite''' is a commemorative [[Gadget]] obtained from the [[Gift for a New Horizon: A Thank-You Gift]] event. It is claimable via in-game mail.

Firstborn Firesprite is not a true gadget and is merely toggled on when equipped, thus regular gadgets can still be used as per normal. It will also temporarily disappear when in combat mode and underwater.

==Gameplay Notes==
* It cannot be used at the same time as any other [[Gadget]] of the "Equipment" type.
