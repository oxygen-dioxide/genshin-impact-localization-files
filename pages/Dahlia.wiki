'''Dahlia''' is a deacon from the [[Church of Favonius]]. 

==Profile==
Dahlia was first mentioned in [[Rosaria]]'s official introduction as the deacon who told [[Barbara]] to ask Rosaria to come to choir practice.<ref>[https://twitter.com/GenshinImpact/status/1376851698350751751 Genshin Impact Rosaria Official EN Introduction]</ref> He is next mentioned in the description of Rosaria's alternate character outfit, [[To the Church's Free Spirit]], as the person who, at the request of Sister [[Victoria]], wrote the birthday letter given to Rosaria alongside the outfit.<ref>{{Ref/Outfit|To the Church's Free Spirit}}</ref>

During ''[[Of Ballads and Brews]]'', Rosaria stated in an open-world dialogue that after finding out that there's more work during [[Weinlesefest]], she decided to hide out to skip work for the Church, and was watching out to make sure Dahlia or Victoria wouldn't find her and drag her off to the sung poetry event.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Aroma of the Past (Quest)}}</ref>

In Rosaria's 2025 birthday mail, she stated that knowing Dahlia, not sending the sisters to chase her down for morning prayer that day was likely his idea of a birthday gift.<ref>{{Ref/Mail|Mail/Here's to You. (2025-01-24)}}</ref>

During the anecdote ''[[Rosaria: Holiday]]'', upon  meeting the [[Traveler]], Rosaria questioned them if they had been sent by the Church to supervise her work, attempting to guess whether it was Victoria, Barbara, or Dahlia who put them up to that task.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Rosaria: Holiday}}</ref>
