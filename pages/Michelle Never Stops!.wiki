{{Quest Description|Michelle is on her way to work, looking quite exhausted...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talking to Michelle)
:'''Michelle:''' Ow, my back...
:{{DIcon}} Are you okay?
:'''Michelle:''' I was just getting ready for work, but then all of a sudden my back started hurting.
:'''Michelle:''' I promised Quinn I would go and help out at his fruit stand today, but I think it's best if I rest here for a while first...
:'''Michelle:''' But I can't just stay here and hold everything up.
:'''Michelle:''' Could you go and ask Quinn what he needs me to do? That will help me get prepared.
:{{DIcon}} Okay.
::'''Michelle:''' Thank you. I should be fine after a short rest.
:{{DIcon}} It's not far, surely you can make it?
::'''Michelle:''' Come on, is this really so much to ask? Help me out here.

;(Talking to Michelle again)
:'''Michelle:''' My back hurts so much... I hope I'll recover after a short rest...
----
;(Approaching Quinn)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa... This looks like really tough work.
:'''Paimon:''' Michelle has enough on her plate already. Let's help Quinn finish the job off ourselves.
:'''Paimon:''' And then let's beg him to give Michelle something that's a bit more manageable...
:'''Paimon:''' Hopefully Michelle won't mind us stepping in on her behalf like this.

;(Talking to Quinn)
:'''Quinn:''' Where is my delivery? This is ridiculous...
:{{DIcon}} What's happened?
:'''Quinn:''' *sigh* My fruit stall is all out of sunsettias. I ordered several batches a while ago...
:'''Quinn:''' But they still haven't arrived. And my customers won't wait forever.
:'''Quinn:''' [[Eury]] alone has come by three times already, and all she wants is {{Color|buzzword|three sunsettias}}. She's been a regular customer for a long time, and now I'm afraid I might lose her!
:'''Quinn:''' I need to stay at the stall... If only someone could go and pick a few wild sunsettias for me.
:{{DIcon}} If it's urgent, I can go.
::'''Quinn:''' Really? That's amazing! Thank you so much.
:{{DIcon}} Michelle is on her way...
::'''Quinn:''' Hang on! What is Michelle doing picking fruit in her condition!?
::'''Paimon:''' We can help!

;(Talking to Quinn with insufficient sunsettias in the inventory)
:'''Quinn:''' Did you find some sunsettias?
:{{DIcon}} Not yet.
:'''Quinn:''' There should be plenty of sunsettias just outside the city. Please, I need to stay here &mdash; can you run and grab some quickly?

;(Talking to Quinn with sufficient sunsettias in the inventory)
:'''Quinn:''' Have you found me some sunsettias yet?
:{{DIcon}} Got them right here.
:'''Quinn:''' Great. That should be enough for Miss Eury.
:'''Quinn:''' *sigh* But it looks like most of my customers have gone now. This isn't a one-person job, it seems.
:'''Quinn:''' Oh&mdash; I should give you something for your trouble. Hang on...
:'''Paimon:''' There is no need for gifts. But we do have a request for you.
:{{DIcon}} It's about Michelle.
:'''Quinn:''' Michelle? You've seen her?
:'''Quinn:''' I should give her a less taxing job?
:'''Quinn:''' All I ever asked is that she watch the fruit stand for me.
:'''Paimon:'''  Oh. Is that true?
:'''Quinn:''' But with no more customers, it looks like I won't even need her to do that...
:'''Quinn:''' Please tell her to go home and rest for me.
:'''Quinn:''' I'll go and chase up that delivery in a moment.

;(After talking to Quinn)
:'''Paimon:''' And at least Michelle can finally get some rest now.

;(Talking to Quinn again)
:'''Quinn:''' Thank you for your help. *sigh* Next time I need to get more people on board. Maybe [[Beatrice]]? Nah...
----
;(Talking to Michelle)
:'''Michelle:''' Have you spoken to Quinn?
:{{DIcon}} Yes. He says you should get some rest.
:'''Paimon:''' There's nothing to do at Quinn's today anyway, go home and rest up.
:'''Michelle:''' Really... *sigh* Looks like I should find something else to do...
:'''Paimon:''' What? You're not going to take a sick day!? Take the chance while it's there!
:'''Michelle:''' Stop and feel what is happening all around you. That's Lord Barbatos' winds, still hard at work.
:'''Michelle:''' We are blessed by Barbatos. It is not a privilege we should take lightly &mdash; we all need to do our part.
:'''Michelle:''' As for your part... What have you been doing? Why are you sweating so much?
:'''Michelle:''' It seems that you are very busy yourself. But this is not a bad thing, for the more we toil, the more we sweat, and the more keenly we feel the winds of Barbatos.
:'''Michelle:''' Here, have this bottle of milk. Drink up and get back to it, for there is no shortage of work to be done in this world.
