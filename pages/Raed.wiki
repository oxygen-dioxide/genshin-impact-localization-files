==Profile==
Raed is a researcher from the [[Vahumana]] Darshan of the [[Sumeru Akademiya]]. He is the leader of an archaeological expedition to collect relics in the [[Great Red Sand]], with [[Bakr]] and [[Bandak]] as bodyguards. However, they have secretly been selling off the relics they find on the black market, with their most recent "product" being a construct they call the [[Tamimi|Ruin Wanderer]], which they seek to replace with broken machinery in order to hide their illicit deal. However, this is interrupted by [[Faruzan]] and the [[Traveler]], who come in search of a Restitution Module for [[Karkata]] and end up exposing Raed's misdeeds. Raed and his guards are soon frightened away when the Ruin Wanderer (actually a mechanical companion of Faruzan from the past) suddenly reactivates.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Wanderings of a Lonesome Shadow}}</ref>
