==Description==
This was an ancient time, when ships sailed alongside sea monsters.

In those days, [[Liyue Harbor]] was not at peace, not from those creatures from the deep.

They say that a [[Osial|great shadow]] once dwelt within the oceanic abyss. With great vortexes and whirlpools it would smash even the strongest of ships, and drag its prey down into the sunless depths. They also say that a divine island would emerge from the sea, rainbow-clad and fog-shrouded...

All who are fortunate enough to set foot on that island will find treasures buried for time incalculable.

Still others say that this island is a great monster in a threadbare torpor.

Most legends that pass between sailors and skippers are such bizarre ones as these. But there is one story that they all believe. They believe that [[Morax|Rex Lapis]] had once wielded a spear that pierced the rainbow, pinning the churning vortex that had once terrorized the oceans in the center of the deep sea.

Legends have it that since then, one can often see dolphins and whales congregate about that patch of ocean, singing.

Some hold that they mourn for the God that they revered, and sing many a winding dirge for it.

Others claim that they do so in awe of Rex Lapis' great power, that he could indeed pierce the rainbow's arc and bring them down the sun.

But folk legend also holds this,

That one day, the vortex, consigned to a dead stillness by the Lord of Geo's divine spear, will once again begin to wake.

When the wind once again brings the stench of the depths onshore, that will be the omen of a hurricane as large as a nine-headed hydra.

Who, then, will be able to subdue That Which Lies in the Deep?

==Trivia==
*[[Zhongli]] is seen wielding this polearm in his official art, as well as in his [https://youtu.be/4oBpaBEMBIM official Character Demo] and in [https://youtu.be/NRXhkjan52A Collected Miscellany - "Zhongli: Dominance of Earth" | Genshin Impact].
*[[Zhongli]] formerly wielded this polearm as a trial character in the one-time domains [[Of Mysteries and Salt]] and [[Beneath the Ancient Tree]], before it was switched with [[Staff of Homa]], and switched back to Vortex Vanquisher in both instances.

===Etymology===
*The Chinese name of the weapon {{Lang|"Lance of Rainbow Piercer"|zh=贯虹之槊|zh_rm=Guànhóng zhī Shuò}} likely refers to the Chinese idiom {{Lang|"a white rainbow pierces the sun"|zh=白虹贯日|zh_rm=bái hóng guàn rì}}. In ancient China, such a celestial event was regarded as an omen which prophesies a lord will be pierced by an assassin.
**The connotation of the idiom depends on the perspective and the context, but it can have a positive connotation in Confucianism. According to ancient Chinese historians, this celestial event was observed when the scholar-swordsman {{w|Jing Ke}} attempted to assassinate King Zheng of Qin (who later became the emperor {{w|Qin Shi Huang}}), who had been traditionally considered to be a tyrannical dictator.<ref name="baidu-baike">Baidu Encyclopedia: [https://baike.baidu.com/item/{{subst:#urldecode:%E7%99%BD%E8%99%B9%E8%B4%AF%E6%97%A5/1174811}} {{Zh|白虹贯日 （汉语成语）}}]</ref> Therefore, the idiom often refers to a Confucian philosophy that an unjust ruler will lose the {{w|Mandate of Heaven}} and their dynasty will be overthrown by a virtuous person.<ref name="baidu-baike" />
*The lore in the game is a word play on the idiom in real life. As a shortend form of the above idiom, the hanzi 贯虹 (pierce-rainbow) means a "piercing rainbow" (a rainbow that pierces something). Meanwhile, 贯虹 of the in-game lore means "to pierce a rainbow" (it is Osial's rainbow that was pierced).
