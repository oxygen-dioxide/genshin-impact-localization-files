===Act I - The Wingless One of Tlalocan===
{{Main|The Wingless One of Tlalocan}}
{{Description|For each of the Wingless, news of the resumption of flying trials evokes an array of different emotions. After bidding them farewell, you set off for the flight trial arena down in the valley...}}
While walking around the Feather-Flower village, the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] hear whistling and investigate the sound, discovering a young woman named [[Coyllur]]. She appears to be in poor spirits, but before they could do anything, [[Chasca]] arrives and tells them to leave her be. She explains that Coyllur was unable to complete the Qucusaur Rider tests. The riders are a very strict group, as not only does the applicant have to be proficient in combat, but they must also win the approval of the [[qucusaurus|qucusaurs]]. Coyllur had just failed her recent attempt, and Chasca states that those who fail too much become disheartened and quit altogether, becoming known as the "Wingless." Coyllur continues whistling, but Chasca states that her whistling would never get any qucusaur's attention. She decides to lay low and watch her to ensure she wouldn't do anything drastic.

The Traveler then comes up with an idea to [[Saurian Indwelling|indwell]] a qucusaur to help cheer her up and does so. Coyllur becomes excited at the sight of the qucusaur and asks for a ride, which the Traveler is unprepared for. Suddenly, another whistle goes off, distracting Coyllur and allowing the Traveler to make their leave. When they return, Coyllur tells Chasca that she managed to get a qucusaur's attention briefly, though she states that the Traveler felt familiar. [[Allpa]] then arrives, telling Coyllur that the tests were being redone as the arena wasn't properly inspected. As the two women make their leave, Chasca asks the Traveler if they were responsible for the qucusaur. She tells them that she could tell as being raised by qucusaurs, they would never be so flustered and acted much like them. Nonetheless, she appreciates their gesture and escorts them to the village.

As they walk around the village, Chasca is informed that her "father," [[Cusco]], was arriving and she abruptly departs. The Traveler talks to him, and Cusco asks them to convince Chasca to take care of herself, as she's been missing her checkups and he feels that her behavior had changed following [[Chuychu]]'s death, which had also affected the rest of the tribe. Not wanting to lose another daughter, he wishes that she would stop putting herself in harm's way.

Returning to Allpa, she learns that several foreign merchants were arriving, commenting that it was not a good time as they were doing a retry for the applicants. Chasca offers to help her tell the other applicants about the retest while she handles the merchants, which Allpa appreciates. The applicants are less than optimistic to retry but accept nonetheless. 

===Act II - The Night Before the Trial===
{{Main|The Night Before the Trial}}
{{Description|A merchant caravan that was ambushed by Qucusaurs seeks your help. But when the Phlogiston Wings they bring with them reach the Flower-Feather Clan... What sort of upheaval will they cause?}}
Heading to the trial arena, Chasca helps the staff set up the arena. After finishing all the prep work, a merchant named [[Isidore]] arrives, begging Chasca for help. He states that they were attacked by a qucusaur and they arrive at the scene to find Allpa there. She states that the qucusaur had left upon realizing reinforcements were arriving. Isodore is relieved to see that their goods, the Phlogiston Wings, were undamaged. As Allpa takes the merchants into the tribe, Chasca picks up a bloodstained feather that she appears to recognize.

===Act III - Guns and Wings===
{{Main|Guns and Wings}}
{{Description|Obsession turned to delusion, and desires were forged into crimes. Yet thanks to your joint efforts, Tepal's dying wish and Allpa's obstinacy did not ultimately lead to disaster.<br>And in the wake of the airborne workshop's dismantling, perhaps the long-held rift between a pair of sisters has finally been overcome too...}}
