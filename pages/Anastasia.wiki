{{Lang|'''Anastasia'''|ru=Анастасия|ru_rm=Anastasiya}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in the {{Quest|For a Tomorrow Without Tears}}.

==Profile==
Anastasia is part of the [[Fatui]] delegation sent to [[Mondstadt]]. She is seen advising [[Jean]] to kill [[Dvalin]] to end the threat it poses to Mondstadt, threatening that the Fatui will take over the defense of Mondstadt if the [[Knights of Favonius]] cannot handle the situation. Jean rebukes her, stating that she is disrespecting Mondstadt by making plans to kill one of its [[Four Winds]]. This prompts Anastasia to leave, claiming that she is merely trying to offer "constructive opinions."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Shadow Over Mondstadt}}</ref>
