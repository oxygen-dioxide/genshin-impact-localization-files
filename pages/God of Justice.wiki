The '''God of Justice''' is the current [[Hydro]] [[Archon]] among [[The Seven]] and presides over [[Fontaine]].

Little is currently known about her, besides the fact that she is not one of the original members of The Seven who emerged after the end of the [[Archon War]].<ref name="C1A3P3">{{Ref/Quest|Solitary Fragrance|q='''Ganyu:''' But five of those original seven had already passed before Rex Lapis &mdash; it's truly a changing of the guard. [...] only Barbatos of Mondstadt remains of the first Seven."}}</ref>

===Introduction===
{{Quote|My ideals have no stains.<br />I must correct you. People here bear no sins in the eyes of the gods... Only laws and the Tribunal can judge someone.<br />They can judge even me. So praise my magnificence and purity.|The God of Justice, in the description for [[Varunada Lazurite Gemstone]]}}

===Personality===
{{Quote|The God of Justice lives for the spectacle of the courtroom, seeking to judge all other gods. But even she knows not to make an enemy of [[Celestia#Relationship to the Archons|the divine]].|[[Dainsleif]]<ref>Video: [[:File:Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview Travail｜Genshin Impact (Contains spoilers)|Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview]]</ref>}}

==Story==
===History===
At some point after The Seven were established as rulers of [[Teyvat]], the previous Hydro Archon passed away and the God of Justice was instated in their place.<ref name="C1A3P3" />

The previous Hydro Archon had a wish to connect with all the people of the world, so she sent the Lochfolk, including the strongest among them, [[Rhodeia of Loch]], all over the world to act as the spies of Fontaine. After the passing of the previous Hydro Archon, the Lochfolk did not recognize the new Hydro Archon and have cut off ties from Fontaine.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Life Flows On (II)}}</ref>

===Archon Quests===
The current Seven are all briefly mentioned in "[[Downtown]]" while [[Zhongli]] is inspecting the kites that represent them. Of the God of Justice's kite, he says ''"Justice flows across the surface of the waters."''

==Trivia==
*The English name for the Hydro character ascension materials derives "Varunada" from {{w|Varuna}}, a Vedic deity associated with the sky, seas, justice, and truth. In the Hindu Puranas, he is the god of oceans.
**In the Chinese version, "Varunada" is instead {{Lang|mini=1|zh=涤净|zh_rm=Díjìng|zh_tl=Cleansing, Purging}}.
