==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Yi Xian is a young girl living in Liyue Harbor with her older brother, Yi Zhu. Their mother died under unknown circumstances, shortly before the [[Traveler]]'s arrival, and at Yi Xian's young age, she didn't fully understand the situation. Their father is unaccounted for and can be presumed deceased; as a result, other people in the city, such as [[Changshun]], have been helping Yi Zhu take care of her.

By the time of the [[Lantern Rite]] event, Yi Xian has come to grips with her mother's death, which is reflected in her dialogue with her brother.

===Appearance===
She is a small young girl with fair skin, black hair and black eyes. She wears a long brown dress with a bow-like knot on the collar.

==Trivia==
* In [[Linling]]'s [[Linling's Anthology of Selected Poetry|Anthology of Selected Poetry]], she complains about "[[Changchang]]'s" constant crying. However, she probably meant Yi Xian, and simply didn't remember which child was which.
<section begin="yixianyizhu" />
* The siblings' names are most likely a reference to {{Lang|''The Inlaid Harp''|zh=锦瑟|zh_rm=Jǐnsè}}, a poem composed by {{w|Li Shangyin}}, a poet and politician during the 9th century.
** The second verse of the poem is {{zh|一弦一柱思华年}} which loosely translates to "Each string (''yixian''), each {{w|Bridge (instrument)|bridge}} (''yizhu'') [of this fifty-string harp] makes me recall the glorious days of my youth [with my beloved one]."
** Reinterpreting the verse while treating {{zh|一弦|yīxián|one string}} and {{zh|一柱|yīzhù|one bridge}} as names results in this possible interpretation: "Yi Xian and Yi Zhu yearn for their happy days."
** Their names may be based on a viral story of a man who named his children Yi Xian and Yi Zhu after his wife Nianhua passed away since the verse may also be interpreted as "Yi Xian and Yi Zhu miss [their mother] Nianhua."
