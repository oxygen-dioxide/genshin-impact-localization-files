===Fragrance of Wine===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909601 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' You made it. C'mon, let's go inside.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909601 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Brace yourself for some sour grapes... Heh.

;(After teleporting into the Dawn Winery)
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 01.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' If you're not feeling well, then let me go this time.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 elzer 01.ogg}} '''Elzer:''' Oh, I'm fine, it's not serious...
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Oh, I'm sorry, I hope I'm not interrupting anything important...
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 02.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' What're you doing here today? And I see you've brought a plus one...
:{{DIcon}} Greetings.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Oh, it's nothing particularly pressing. It's just that we recently returned from Sumeru, and given how long it's been since we last visited the Winery, we thought we'd drop by and say hello.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 03.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Is that it? Make yourselves comfortable, then.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Oh, do you really mean that? Because my definition of "comfortable" happens to involve prodigious amounts of your finest wines... Speaking of which, I'm curious where you store the wine these days &mdash; is it the same place as it always used to be?
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 04.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Sounds like you're in a hurry to reach your goal. Been plotting this raid for a long time?
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Plotting a raid? Why, you misunderstand me. The truth is, a rumor happened to reach my ears recently...
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' My informants tell me that last month, the Dawn Winery spent a large sum of Mora on two bottles of limited-edition Northland Valberry Liquor. However, it turns out that they are likely just cheap knockoffs masquerading as the real thing!
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 06.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Of course, a teetotaler like yourself would struggle to tell the difference. So why not get a connoisseur to help you appraise the quality?
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 07.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Ah wait &mdash; but the sterling reputation of Dawn Winery is at stake! Why, if you really purchased bootleg liquor, that would be scandalous. Better to have unknown and insignificant alcohol aficionados do the taste-test for you, to prevent word getting out.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 05.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Quite the story. You used that one last year. Got anything else?
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 08.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' What, really? Uhhh... I totally forgot. Hmmm... in that case, how about the principle of reciprocity?
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 09.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Here, this is for you. I bought it for you in Sumeru, and it cost a veritable mountain of Mora.
:[[File:Souvenir Lamp from Sumeru.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 06.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Thanks. Put it on the table.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 10.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' That's it? No comment whatsoever?
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 07.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' You want a comment? Okay then. This thing is very in line with your unique aesthetic tastes, much like that vase over there.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 08.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Elzer, fetch a bottle of this year's newest batch from the warehouse. Or else someone will keep blathering on with endless excuses.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 elzer 02.ogg}} '''Elzer:''' One moment, Master Kaeya, I shall fetch it immediately... *cough* *cough*
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 11.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' What's wrong, Elzer? Are you okay?
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 elzer 03.ogg}} '''Elzer:''' My throat is a bit raspy is all. It got better after I began taking medicine, but recently... *cough*&nbsp;...It flared up again. Other than a bit of difficulty breathing now and then, it's nothing to be concerned about.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 12.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Many illnesses are caused by overwork. If you don't get enough rest, medicine alone won't solve the problem.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 13.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Surely, you should've long since handed over the work of the winery to Diluc by now? You can't keep being Diluc's butler, he's becoming a louse.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 elzer 04.ogg}} '''Elzer:''' Actually, most of the time he... *cough*&nbsp;...
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 09.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Take some time off, Elzer. Don't put it off any longer. I'll handle the guild matters.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 10.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' It's important to take care of your health. You have to take it seriously. And Cavalry Captain... you would do well to remember that brevity is the soul of wit.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 elzer 05.ogg}} '''Elzer:''' Master Diluc, Master Kaeya, thank you both. *cough*&nbsp;... Then I'll take my leave and rest for a few days...
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 14.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Enjoy your vacation! Though before you officially clock out, let me head out the door with you. We can grab a few bottles on the way.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 15.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' There's nothing quite like enjoying a quality wine while feeling the gentle breeze against your face... ahh.
:{{DIcon}} Want to come, Diluc?
:{{DIcon}} We can drink inside together.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 11.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Normally I'd accompany you, but unfortunately I still have some pressing matters to take care of. My apologies and regards to both of you.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 kaeya 16.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Really? That's a shame.

;(Talk to Diluc again, optional)
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 12.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Where's Kaeya? Gone already?
:{{DIcon}} Kaeya's still here. What're you working on?
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 13.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Right now, just the usual day-to-day winery business. But I'll be attending a meeting in Elzer's place shortly.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 14.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' The meeting concerns research and development of new beverages, and involves collaboration between several different wineries. It makes more sense for me to attend, anyway.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909602 diluc 15.ogg}} '''Diluc:''' Kaeya can answer any questions you might have while I'm not here. He's quite familiar with the winery.

;(After going outside)
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 elzer 01.ogg}} '''Elzer:''' I asked Connor to select a bottle of our best. He'll bring it by shortly.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' You asked Connor?
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 elzer 02.ogg}} '''Elzer:''' Haha, he hasn't seen you in a while. He's just happy to be able to do this for you.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Considerate as ever. Ah, Elzer! I also brought you a gift. Here, this belt buckle is for you.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 elzer 03.ogg}} '''Elzer:''' Such artistry... Thank you very much indeed. I'll put it on as soon as I get home.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Glad you like it. Go on, enjoy your time off, and don't forget to see a doctor!
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 elzer 04.ogg}} '''Elzer:''' Very well, Master Kaeya. I'll be taking my leave now.

:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Elzer is a good guy, and he's very responsible. But with a thousand different things to worry about each day, that same sense of responsibility wears him down.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 01.ogg}} '''Connor:''' Master Kaeya, your wine, and an Apple Cider for your friend! All freshly fermented this year. Please, have a taste!
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 02.ogg}} '''Connor:''' {{Traveler}}, this one's for you.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Very clear... and a full-bodied aroma. It's rather nice.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 03.ogg}} '''Connor:''' Isn't it? This one's a little on the sweeter side, but I can go grab a dry one if you'd prefer!
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 06.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' No need, sweet is just fine. Let's drink one together.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 04.ogg}} '''Connor:''' Don't mind if I do, haha! I haven't caught up with you like this in a long time.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 05.ogg}} '''Connor:''' We used to always pour the first glass for you when cracking open a new barrel. With you gone these past few years, I've had to drink it for you.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 07.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Well, since it wasn't me harvesting the grapes, destemming, or crushing them, it's much more fitting that you should take the first taste.
:{{DIcon}} Destemming?
::{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 06.ogg}} '''Connor:''' It's an important step in the winemaking process. After harvesting the grapes, the stems have to be removed prior to fermentation, or they'll affect the quality.
:{{DIcon}} Crushing?
::{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 07.ogg}} '''Connor:''' Crushing the grapes improves the aroma and color of the wine during the fermentation process. If you're curious to learn more about the winemaking process, you can read our "Fruit Wine Maker's Manual."
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 08.ogg}} '''Connor:''' If you'd like, {{Traveler}}, you can help us harvest some grapes. Winemaking can be quite a lot of fun.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 08.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' It isn't nearly as exciting as he makes it sound. Your back will be in so much pain after picking grapes that you won't be able to stand up straight.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 09.ogg}} '''Connor:''' Master Kaeya is right, harvesting grapes is backbreaking labor.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 10.ogg}} '''Connor:''' But seeing the grapes turn into grape juice, then ferment into wine, it's a fascinating experience, and every person at the winery should have a chance to share in it.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 09.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Wait, so Diluc actually helps you with the winemaking?
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 11.ogg}} '''Connor:''' Goodness, no, Master Diluc is far too busy! Not just during the day, but even at night...
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 10.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Oh? And just what is Diluc always so busy with?
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 12.ogg}} '''Connor:''' Well, you know. Come nightfall, he's always out there... Uh, networking, and so on... Heh, Master Kaeya, you may be surprised to learn just what lengths Master Diluc is willing to go to for the sake of the business...
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 11.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Haha, Connor, you're an awful liar. I hate to see you struggle.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 13.ogg}} '''Connor:''' Um... Hehe, so &mdash; Master Kaeya, how do you like your drink? I remember you weren't very interested in wine when you were young.
:{{DIcon}} (That was the least natural segue in conversational history.)
:{{DIcon}} (Connor almost exposed the Darknight Hero...)
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 12.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' ...That was because the adults said children weren't allowed even a drop. Don't you remember how much trouble Diluc got in that time he snuck a drink?
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 14.ogg}} '''Connor:''' Ahhh, yes, of course! [[Adelinde]] even covered for the two of you, haha!
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 13.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' But on a serious note, having grown up at a winery, I spent my childhood watching Tunner plant the grapeseeds, waiting for them to ripen on the vine, harvesting them together, and waiting for the alcohol to ferment.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 14.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Even though I couldn't help with making distilled spirits, watching everyone work was fascinating.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 15.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' How could anyone not love to drink with a childhood like that?
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 16.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' So, let us raise a glass to wine itself, and in thanks to the gracious hospitality the winery has shown us today!
:{{DIcon}} To our generous hosts!
:{{DIcon}} Though my drink is non-alcoholic...
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 15.ogg}} '''Connor:''' Hear, hear! To Dawn Winery!
:{{Black Screen|Three glasses clink, and are promptly drained in celebration.}}
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 17.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Speaking of wine, Connor, I have a gift for you. It's a decanter set from Sumeru.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 16.ogg}} '''Connor:''' I get a present too? Thank you, Master Kaeya.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 17.ogg}} '''Connor:''' Time really does fly! I still remember the days when everyone was giving you gifts at your birthday parties when you were young.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 18.ogg}} '''Connor:''' Now, I have wrinkles and Tunner's bent double, while Master Kaeya is the Cavalry Captain of the Knights of Favonius!
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 18.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' How is Tunner holding up?
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 19.ogg}} '''Connor:''' He's still tough, but getting on in years, so some things just aren't as easy as they were. But he's used to doing things his way, and doesn't trust new employees to do it for him.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 20.ogg}} '''Connor:''' A lot of the temporary workers I hired quit because they couldn't handle how picky he was.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 21.ogg}} '''Connor:''' Master Kaeya, if you have time, why not go talk to him about it? You're probably the only person he'll listen to besides Master Diluc.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 kaeya 19.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' I definitely owe him a visit. I haven't seen him in some time, and I do have fond memories of the days when he was teaching me to pick grapes...

;(Talk to Connor again, optional)
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909604 connor 22.ogg}} '''Connor:''' The art of winemaking is fascinating, would you like to try and learn?

===Winery Work===
;(Talk to Tunner)
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909605 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Busy day today, Tunner?
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909605 tunner 01.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' Oh, Master Kaeya, you're back! No, I'm not at all busy, I just spend my hours watching the grapes growing on the vine.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909605 tunner 02.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' They're growing wonderfully this year. A few rows are almost ripe! We've already begun harvesting them these past few days, so that'll keep me occupied.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909605 tunner 03.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' Sit, sit! After we're done picking, I'll bring a few bunches over for you to try.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909605 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' No need. We were just drinking with Connor, and our stomachs are so full of wine that we couldn't eat a bite.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909605 tunner 04a.ogg}} {{A|vo kycop001 1909605 tunner 04b.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' What about your friend? Doesn't {{MC|m=he|f=she}} want to try?
:{{DIcon}} I'm not hungry.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909605 kaeya 03.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Allow me to introduce the Honorary Knight of the Knights of Favonius, {{Traveler}}.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909605 tunner 05.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' Ah, the Honorary Knight in the flesh! There are so many talented people in the Knights of Favonius. You all have bright futures ahead of you.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909605 kaeya 04.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Harvesting grapes is hard work, let me help you.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909605 kaeya 05.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Do you still remember how I used to help out when we were shorthanded?
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909605 tunner 06.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' Haha, I believe I do... In that case, I'm counting on you!
:{{DIcon}} I will help too.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909605 tunner 07.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' What's this, everyone's clamoring to do manual labor? Well, suits me! More help is always appreciated.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909605 tunner 08a.ogg}} {{A|vo kycop001 1909605 tunner 08b.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' Come with me, {{MC|m=young lad|f=young lass}}. I'll tell you which grapes are ripe enough, and you can pick them.

;(Talk to Tunner again, optional)
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909606 tunner 01.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' Happy to have another helper. Now, let's go pick some grapes!

;(Talk to Kaeya, optional)
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909606 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Winery rules state that whoever picks the most grapes without damaging them gets to drink the first glass from the new batch.

;(After picking two bunches of [[Ripe Grapes]] and following Tunner)
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909606 tunner 02a.ogg}} {{A|vo kycop001 1909606 tunner 02b.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' You have nimble hands, {{MC|m=lad|f=lassie}}! Master Kaeya wasn't nearly so careful when he was young. He mangled so many his first time, tsk tsk... what a waste!
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909606 tunner 03.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' Fortunately, the young master has a good head on his shoulders. Didn't take long for him to get up to speed.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909606 tunner 04.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' And now he's turned into such an outstanding young man. Polite and kind...
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909606 tunner 05.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' If I had a son as exceptional as Kaeya, I would be the happiest man in Mondstadt!

;(After picking two more bunches of grapes)
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909607 tunner 01.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' There's a few more rows of grapes up ahead. Let's finish picking them together.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909607 tunner 02.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' Careful not to damage the grapes when you pinch the stem.

;(After picking one more bunch of grapes)
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 01.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' These grapes look excellent, you're a fast learner.

;(Talk to Tunner)
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 02.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' I'll take them, good job.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 03.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' Master Kaeya left the winery and moved to Mondstadt... just like my own son, Guy. He left home to join the Knights of Favonius, too.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 04.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' I don't know him like Miss Adelinde or Master Diluc do, but I know that no matter how old your child gets, they always need a home they can come back to.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 05.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' And without family by your side, you at least need the companionship of friends.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 06.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' I've been working here for decades, and watched him grow up with my own two eyes... Sometimes, I get the sense that there is something bothering him. Something deep-rooted.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 07.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' But he guards his secrets closely. Or perhaps he just doesn't want to involve us... After all, I doubt that we could help him.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 08.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' I can see that you have a good relationship with Master Kaeya. Please look after him... He's very dear to us.
:{{DIcon}} I'll take good care of him.
::{{A|vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 09.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' Hearing that puts my mind at ease. You're a good child. Thank you.
::{{DIcon}} Kaeya is an important friend to me.
:{{DIcon}} I think Kaeya is much stronger than you might imagine.
::{{A|vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 10.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' ...That he is, yes. I do still think of him as a child. It takes time for an old man's mind to adjust.
::{{DIcon}} Kaeya is an important friend to me.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 11.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' Wonderful, wonderful. Knowing that he has a friend like you, we here at the winery can be happy for him.
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909608 kaeya 01.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' You're looking very happy, Tunner. Was {{Traveler}} telling you some jokes?
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 12.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' Haha, no, no jokes... I've received a letter from my son, Guy. He's really going places. I'm so delighted!
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 13.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' Master Kaeya, Honorary Knight, my eyesight is fading in my old age... Could you read it out for me?
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909608 kaeya 02.ogg}} '''Kaeya:''' Of course!
:{{A|vo kycop001 1909608 tunner 14.ogg}} '''Tunner:''' Thank you both.
