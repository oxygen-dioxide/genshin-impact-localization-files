{{Description|Dear Travelers:<br /><br />The standard wish "Wanderlust Invocation" is now available! Win new characters, grab new weapons, and assemble your dream team!<br /><br />In this no time-limit wish, every 10-wish set includes at least one 4-star or higher character or weapon.<ref>Twitter: [https://twitter.com/GenshinImpact/status/1310580022885994498 Event Announcement]</ref>}}

'''Wanderlust Invocation''' is the permanent Standard Wish with no time limit. All ''Non-Event Exclusive'' [[Character]]s and [[Weapon]]s are available in its pool, with new 4{{star}} characters being added to it one update after their original wish debut. [[Character/List#Event Exclusive Characters|Event Exclusive]] 5{{star}} characters or 4{{star}} weapons are not added to this wish.

Please note that despite the wish banner showing certain characters and weapons in its banner image, none of them are actually featured items and do not have any better chance of being wished over items not shown in the image.

In this wish, each 10-wish set is guaranteed to include at least one 4{{star}} or above item.

==Rules==
*'''4{{star}} drop guarantee:''' If a player does not obtain any 4{{star}} (or above) item within 9 wishes in a row, the 10th wish is ''guaranteed'' to be a 4{{star}} (or higher) item. (On guarantee, the probability of getting a 4{{star}} item is 99.4%, and the probability of getting a 5{{star}} item is 0.6%.)
**This counter will reset if the player obtains any 4{{star}} item.
*'''5{{star}} drop guarantee:''' If a player does not obtain any 5{{star}} item after 89 wishes, the 90th wish is ''guaranteed'' to be a 5{{star}} item. (''On average'', a greater proportion of 5{{star}} items are dropped between 74 and 90 pity.)
**This counter will reset if the player obtains any 5{{star}} item.

==Notes==
*Although a 5{{star}} item or character is guaranteed at least once per 90 wishes, there is extensive evidence to suggest that, on average, a rate up event actually occurs earlier, sometime after 70 wishes. This is generally referred to as "Soft Pity".<ref>Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/jvmnac/5_character_banner_pity_analysis_true_rate_of_324/ 5* Character Banner Pity Analysis - True Rate of 32.4% at 76+ Rolls]</ref><ref name="NGA thread">NGA: [https://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=26754637&rand=214 Deriving a model based on 200,000 wishes (May 2021)]</ref><ref>Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/japcnz/whale_watching_logs/ Whale Watching Logs (October 2020) with 3200 pulls, 58x 5*]</ref><ref>Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/jod9o4/whale_watching_logs_2_the_blue_whale/ Whale Watching Logs 2: The Blue Whale (November 2020) with 5935 pulls, 95 5*]</ref><ref group="Note">There are community projects that crowdsource wishing histories and corroborate the theory of an early 5{{star}} rate up event. However, since crowdsourcing a large amount of data inherently has the risk of also accepting tainted data, neither these community projects nor the exact pity counter numbers that they demonstrate rate ups for are cited.</ref>
*In addition to the published rules for obtaining 4{{star}} and 5{{star}} characters and weapons on this banner, there appears to be a system that helps to force a 50/50 ratio between characters/weapons in the short term. Every 270 pulls will contain both a 5{{star}} character and weapon, while every 30 pulls will have both a 4{{star}} character and weapon. In other words, it is impossible to do 270 pulls without a 5{{star}} weapon, and likewise impossible to do 270 pulls without a 5{{star}} character.<ref name="NGA thread" />
**This is suggested by the equal base probability of winning 5-star character (0.300%) and winning 5-star weapon (also 0.300%), as well as the equal base probability of winning 4-star character (2.550%) and winning 4-star weapon (also 2.550%).
