{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Yousuke:''' Hello, how may I help you?
:{{DIcon}} Are you Yousuke?
::'''Yousuke:''' Oh, you must be the traveler that solved the [[Mikage Furnace]] incident with Mr. [[Xavier]].
::'''Yousuke:''' It's very nice to meet you- I've heard so much about you. I am Yousuke, indeed, and I am currently providing oversight of the Mikage Furnace repair efforts.
::'''Yousuke:''' To be honest though, I'm good with crafts and everything, but I'm pretty awful at all the paperwork...
::'''Yousuke:''' Still, I will keep at it and hopefully become someone as reliable as Sir [[Hanbei]]!
::{{DIcon}} That's not necessary...
::'''Yousuke:''' Hmm? But I heard that Sir Hanbei is well recognized and been tasked with great responsibilities...
::'''Yousuke:''' Nevertheless, I will work as hard as I am able. Thank you once again Traveler, for all that you've done for the Mikage Furnace.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Yousuke:''' Take care now.
