|text      = As the sayings go, time fries when you're having fun and weights for no one! Compadre, I'm sure by now news has reached your ears of how the Arataki Gang has reached new heights under my brilliant leadership. Whether we're talking the [[Arataki Blazing Armor Beetle Battle Boot Camp|Beetle Battle Brawl]] or [[Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness|The Great Singalong]], I've taken us to bigger, better, and bolder stages than ever before!

But from the sound of things, you haven't exactly been slacking yourself, huh? I heard you made the papers &mdash; guess you must be rockin' the world too! I expect nothing less from my compadre, following' in my footsteps as I charge bravely ahead, horns-first!

Now, normally great minds like ours think alike, so we don't have to hash things out. But recently, [[Dvorak|Jack-Attack]] told me about these thingamajigs from his [[Fontaine|hometown]] called uhh... De... [[Subdetection Unit|Detector-subs]], or something'? Whatever, it doesn't matter! They should be called "Mighty Meka Armored Onikabuto" &mdash; am I right, or am I right? Anyway, I had a major brainwave, and you've gotta be the first to surf it!

Hahaha, maybe I'm just a born genius? Actually, make that an "ingenious"! C'mon, Compadre, I'll dish out all the deets as soon as you get here!
