{{Elemental Reaction Intro|element1=Dendro|element2=Hydro}}

==Dendro Core==
If a Dendro Core's duration expires, it will explode, dealing {{Color|AoE Dendro DMG}} in a '''5m''' radius to both enemies and players.

If {{Pyro}} is inflicted upon a Dendro Core, the '''Burgeon''' reaction will be triggered, which consumes the Dendro Core, and deals increased {{Color|AoE Dendro DMG}} in a '''5m''' radius to both enemies and players.

If {{Electro}} is inflicted upon a Dendro Core, the '''Hyperbloom''' reaction will be triggered, which transforms the Dendro Core into a Sprawling Shot that homes in on the closest enemy (or ally, if triggered by an enemy/the environment), dealing increased {{Color|AoE Dendro DMG}} in a '''1m''' radius on hit to both enemies and players.

DMG dealt to players by all Bloom-related reactions are '''5%''' of the DMG dealt to enemies, no matter which party triggers the reaction.

Burgeon and Hyperbloom can both be triggered by a party other than the one which triggered the original Bloom, including the environment, and their damage scale with the stats of the party responsible for applying Pyro or Electro.

==Bountiful Core==
Certain character abilities and event buffs will cause the Bloom reaction to produce Bountiful Cores instead of Dendro Cores. Bountiful Cores explode '''0.4''' seconds after their creation, dealing {{Color|AoE Dendro DMG}} in a '''6.5m''' radius to both enemies and players. DMG dealt to players is '''5%''' of the DMG dealt to enemies.

Burgeon and Hyperbloom cannot be triggered on Bountiful Cores. Bountiful Cores share the upper limit of 5 with regular Dendro Cores.

==Damage==
Note that one target can only take '''2''' instances of DMG from each Bloom-related reaction every '''0.5''' seconds, as limited by the [[Damage Sequence]]. Note that Dendro Core explosions and Bountiful Core explosions are also counted separately.
