:'''Zhila:''' Oh! I was lost in thought! What a jump scare you are!
:'''Zhila:''' Oh no, where was I...
:{{DIcon}} It wasn't intentional...
::'''Zhila:''' Don't worry, I'm not blaming you. Please don't mind me.
::'''Zhila:''' It's my own fault. My memory has been failing me lately. I either forget what I'm supposed to deliver, or forget what I'm supposed to sell...
::'''Zhila:''' Luckily, the owner of this place has more important things to worry about than the insignificant work I'm in charge of.
::'''Zhila:''' Well, enough of that, let me continue thinking. Where the heck did I put a long list like that?
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it, then.
::'''Zhila:''' *sigh* See you, I'm going to try recalling it again...
