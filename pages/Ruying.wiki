:'''Ruying:''' *yawn*
:'''Ruying:''' If only I had come a few days earlier...
:{{DIcon}} Didn't sleep well?
::'''Ruying:''' Ah, yes.
::'''Ruying:''' This inn is great. The owner is friendly, and the service is good. We foreign merchants like staying here.
::'''Ruying:''' But there is one problem: the noise insulation is bad.
::'''Ruying:''' I could hear the buzz of conversation next door while lying in bed at night.
::'''Ruying:''' And I don't know if the man and woman next door were speaking in a dialect or something... I could understand the words but not the meaning.
:{{DIcon}} A few days earlier?
::'''Ruying:''' Yup.
::'''Ruying:''' The inn owner said that the person who was my neighbor was a researcher or something, and wrote papers all day.
::'''Ruying:''' Too bad it seems like he disappeared a few days ago, and the room's been let out. The people who moved in are a couple who can't stop yapping.
::'''Ruying:''' If I'd arrived a few days ago, I'd be done with my business and on my way, instead of being bothered by the noise all night and unable to sleep...
:{{DIcon}} Rest well.
::'''Ruying:''' Oh, thanks.
