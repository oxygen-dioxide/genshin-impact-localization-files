{{Description|In the legends of the Scions of the Canopy, the memory of a great fireball has drifted down through the countless ages of Natlan's past.<br>Its story, etched into an Ancient Name and passed down through generations of heroes, now rests upon the shoulders of a young Saurian hunter.<br>As tribal conflicts grow ever more intense, there may be those that ask &mdash; how well does he understand its meaning, and how does he view the coming crisis?<br>"By past fuel, and present flame, life marches ever on."}}
