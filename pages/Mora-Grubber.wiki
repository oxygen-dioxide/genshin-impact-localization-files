==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Mora-Grubber:''' Ah, as one would expect of Boss [[Beidou]]. Bountiful spoils indeed.
:{{DIcon}} You seem very pleased.
::'''Mora-Grubber:''' Of course! Why, we made quite the haul on this voyage!
::'''Mora-Grubber:''' Contrary to what most people think, fleets usually come back empty-handed.
::'''Mora-Grubber:''' We're... something of an exception in that this almost never happens to us, which is all thanks to Captain Beidou's brilliant leadership.
::{{DIcon}} What are your plans after the booty's distributed?
::'''Mora-Grubber:''' How do I put this? I've always had my eye on the process of making money. Never gave much thought to what to do afterward.
::'''Mora-Grubber:''' Maybe I'll go get a hundred servings of [[Zhongyuan Chop Suey]] and treat everyone... Who knows?
::'''Mora-Grubber:''' Some people think results are everything. But if you think about it, if living itself is all about results, what does living even mean?
::'''Mora-Grubber:''' I'd say that if you just look at results, you'll miss out on a lot.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Mora-Grubber:''' Haha, may fortune find you.
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* Despite warning the traveler not to rob her during "A Lone Ship In Guyun," nothing will happen if you open the three chests next to her.
