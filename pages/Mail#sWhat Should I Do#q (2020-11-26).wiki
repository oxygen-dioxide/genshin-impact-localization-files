|text    = Maybe there's something to the saying that you will be especially lucky on your birthday. Today's experiments went very smoothly, and I'm on the verge of a breakthrough.

But... but even so, I feel quite troubled right now.

Rationality dictates that I should stay up to do those experiments and get results as soon as possible, and if I put my experiments aside just to go see you, I might just bring you extra trouble instead.

But I can't help but think about how great it would be if you could be here to witness the fruits of my labor...

Err, I&mdash;I'll get back to my experiments now!
