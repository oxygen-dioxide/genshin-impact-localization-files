|description    = A uniquely shaped fluorescent lamp, emitting a soft and azure glow reminiscent of the sparkling water upon a lake at sunset. Its design is identical to the ornaments used in the Knights of Favonius's alchemy shop. A special potion sits encased within a dazzling gem-like potion bottle, ensuring the enduring reliability of the lamp-light.<br>There are reports that some adventurers have become attracted to its long-lasting luminescence and resistance to external environmental influences, intending to utilize the potion inside this lamp to create a new type of "cave exploration" tool. However, this idea is still in the experimental stages and has a long way to go before it can truly be put to use.
