{{Description|A lovely amulet made from twisted paper cord. It is said to hold the power to make wishes come true.}}
'''Entangling Bloom''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Shimenawa's Reminiscence]].

==Description==
An {{w|omamori}} crafted using an art known as {{w|Mizuhiki}}.<br>It is said to have the power to bind wishes and the reasons for those wishes within itself.

Once, I learned how to manage the affairs of the shrine under the tutelage of a mighty [[kitsune]].<br>Back then, I was just a young shrine maiden who had just arrived on [[Narukami Island|Narukami]] from a [[Koseki Village|small fishing village]].<br>I was duller than a teapot and had yet to lose the obstinate impulsiveness and curiosity of a child,<br>I was always naively skeptical of the elegant but incomprehensible words of [[Kitsune Saiguu|Lady Saiguu]].

"Everything in the world is entangled. Hence, illusory visions were born out of concrete reality."<br>"The so-called omamori cannot make one's wishes come true at all, but they can make them eternal through this entanglement."

Seeing my befuddled expression, a picture of complete confusion, Lady Kitsune couldn't help bursting into laughter,<br>She cheerfully knocked my head with her pipe and sneakily changed the subject.

"I suppose you've met your [[Takamine the Mistsplitter|fated one]] as well, [[Asase Hibiki|Hibiki]]?"

"What sort of 'fate' could there be with a rude and reckless brute like that!"

"Oh, is that so?

[[Cataclysm|But darkness engulfed everything in the end.]]<br>That "fate," too, was no more.
