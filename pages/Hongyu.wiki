==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Hongyu:''' Hey, it's a traveler. I'm free to chat if you want? While the sergeant's is not here.
:{{DIcon}} About Rex Lapis' death...
:;(After completing [[Rite of Descension]])
:::'''Hongyu:''' Whoa, come on now. When I said we could chat, I didn't mean sensitive topics like that. That's off limits.
:::'''Hongyu:''' Take it from me, no self-respecting Liyue local is gonna want to broach that topic lightly.
:::'''Hongyu:''' ...Ahem, I must stay at my post. If there's nothing else you need, please leave me be.
:;(After completing [[The Fond Farewell]])
:::'''Hongyu:''' I was there at the Rite of Descension too. The Qixing has told us to maintain absolute secrecy about the matter at the time.
:::'''Hongyu:''' But now that the Rite of Parting is finished, everyone is aware of the situation. There's no need for us Millelith to keep silent about it any longer...
:::'''Hongyu:''' But even so... I'm sorry, I still can't bring myself to discuss this topic any further.
:::'''Hongyu:''' Rex Lapis... *sigh*
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Hongyu:''' We're Millelith guards for this area. I'm Hongyu, and that's [[Kun]].
::'''Hongyu:''' Liyue Harbor's a pretty safe place. I've not seen any big trouble ever since I've been in uniform. Maybe you have a bit more pickpockets and petty thieves around Chihu Rock, but that's about it.
::'''Hongyu:''' Hey, have you heard about the [[Lantern Rite Festival|Lantern Rite]]?
::'''Hongyu:''' It's a festival people in Liyue celebrate. Takes place on the night of the first full moon every year. It's the biggest festival of the whole year, too.
::'''Hongyu:''' On the day of the festival, the whole city lights lanterns all night long. It makes the place as bright as day.
::'''Hongyu:''' Also, we have a special floating lantern too. Unique to Liyue. It's quite a sight to behold, and you won't find anything like it elsewhere.
::'''Hongyu:''' Anyway, just thought if you're new in town, it's something you definitely wouldn't want to miss!
:{{DIcon}} Anything interesting happening around here?
::'''Hongyu:''' No, I wouldn't say that anything interesting has happened. But I did encounter something weird recently...
::'''Hongyu:''' There was something quite not right about my house. If it wasn't a bowl or chopsticks moving all of a sudden, then it was a chair suddenly falling over.
::'''Hongyu:''' After talking this through with a friend, he introduced me to an exorcist named [[Chongyun]]. They say he's a specialist in these bump-in-the-night matters.
::'''Hongyu:''' But the instant that exorcist walked into the room, all the strange happenings stopped right away! He didn't even need to work any thaumaturgy!
::'''Hongyu:''' It truly is weird. I still have no idea how that might have happened...
:{{DIcon}} Sorry, I have things to do.
::'''Hongyu:''' *sigh* Okay then. Shame, don't get this sort of freedom very often.

==Event Dialogue==
===Fleeting Colors in Flight===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Hongyu:''' I saw a [[Shenhe|white-haired lady]] around these parts a couple of days ago. She was incredibly beautiful &mdash; had an extraordinary air about her to boot.
:'''Hongyu:''' But just as I wanted to get a closer look, she suddenly disappeared...
:'''Hongyu:''' Actually, now that I think about it, did I encounter some passing adeptus?
