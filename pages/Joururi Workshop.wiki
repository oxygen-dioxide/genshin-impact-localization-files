{{Description|The obsession with godhood has burst like a bubble, disappearing like a daydream.<br>And yet when you step into the secret workshop beneath that breach, the memories of your battle against [[Shouki no Kami]] reemerge in your mind, fresh as the morning dew.<br>Such a recollection does not need the use of the [[Akasha]] to reproduce perfectly.|Memories: Lucent Altar of the Everlasting}}
'''Joururi Workshop''' is a [[Trounce Domain]] unlocked after completing the {{Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies}}. Players can relive their fight against [[Scaramouche]] and receive rewards.

==Enemies==
{{Card|Everlasting Lord of Arcane Wisdom|type=Enemy|show_caption=1}}

==Rules==
{{Transclude|Domain|trouncerule|section=1}}

==Ley Line Disorder==
* Some of Shouki no Kami's attacks will create Energy Blocks. Pick these blocks up to recharge the Neo Akasha Terminal. Once it has energy, the Neo Akasha Terminal can be put to various uses.
* When you are standing over an Elemental Matrix on the ground during the battle's first phase, you can activate the matrix's effect(s):
** {{Pyro}}: Clears the Raw Frost effect from the ground.
** {{Cryo}}: Clears the Remnant Flame effect from the ground.
** {{Anemo}}: Creates an [[Upcurrent]] with which you can dodge some of Shouki no Kami's attacks.
** {{Hydro}}: Creates a continuous [[healing]] effect.
** {{Electro}}: Suppresses Shouki no Kami. Activate the other Electro Matrix while a suppression effect is active to overload and paralyze him.
* During the battle's second phase, charge the Neo Akasha Terminal fully to allow it to hit Shouki no Kami with a more powerful aimed attack which will deplete his shield. Additionally, when Shouki no Kami is charging his Setsuna Shoumetsu attack, this sort of attack can be used to hit his weak spot, toppling him over and immobilizing him.
