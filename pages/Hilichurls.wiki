{{Description|Primitive humanoid monsters that can be found all across Teyvat.<br />Most people have already given up on trying to communicate with the hilichurls, believing that they are monsters simply incapable of communication.}}
'''Hilichurls''' are a goblin-like family of [[monsters]] in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''.

==Description==
Regardless of what stage of growth they are currently at, all Hilichurls are bare-chested and bare-footed, and have a large mane covering most of their head. They appear to have two elongated ears sticking out of their mane. The only clothing they wear is a loincloth, while their arms and legs are loosely wrapped in bandages. Every Hilichurl wears a mask. While elementally-affiliated Hilichurls, including Samachurls and Lawachurls, take on the color of their element, their skin is naturally of a grayish-black hue.

Elementally affiliated hilichurls, [[Samachurls]] and [[Lawachurls]] also take on the element's appropriate color for both their skin and masks. Despite their general hostility towards outsiders or humans and a less than optimal lifestyle, Hilichurls are also intelligent for their standards, as a few use tools and [[Slimes]], scavenge and even engage in agriculture, albeit limited to raising livestock due to the race's general dislike of vegetables. They have a fairly impressive, albeit archaic architectural style, the construction or purpose of them unknown. Aside from the practical use of tools, some Hilichurls such as the Pyro Grenadiers can destroy four training dummies at once with a precise throw.

As a hilichurl grows and survives, they eventually turn into [[Mitachurls]], who are larger and bulkier. Mitachurls that continue to grow and survive eventually accumulate an excess of the elemental energy in their area, turning them into [[Lawachurls]]. It is not known how long it takes for this growth to occur.

They appear to not have an archon or god governing them, rather relying on the most strongest and ferocious among them to lead the tribe. Most tribes also have [[Samachurls]] who act as the spiritual leaders of the group. The Lawachurls whose name is derived from the Hilichurlian way of respectfully addressing a king or ruler are revered by younger Hilichurls due to their strength. Despite their status as a role model or "king" for the smaller hierarchy, most Lawachurls prefer solitude.

Hilichurls appear to have a reliable social network, as some Hilichurls are friends with others across vast distances.<ref>Event: [[Mimi Tomo]]</ref> Like humans, Hilichurls can live in a myriad of environments and acclimate themselves accordingly.

Many Hilichurls are also affiliated with the [[Abyss Order]], as the [[Abyss Mages]] are able to speak fluent Hilichurlian. Unlike humans, who usually have to rely on a [[Vision]] or science to manipulate the elements, some Hilichurls are naturally capable of doing so, such as the samachurls &mdash; why or how is unknown. That said, Hilichurls typically stay away from areas with high elemental concentrations, as it places a great burden on their body.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Hurdle}}</ref>

They are one of the first types of monsters and enemies encountered in the game along with the Slimes.

==Tribes==
While Hilichurls can be found all over Teyvat, some of them in small tribes, there are three prominent tribes, all of whom can be found in [[Dadaupa Gorge]]. A tribe's composition tends to vary, usually containing a large amount of normal hilichurls. Most tribes also have Samachurls, who are the oldest of the Hilichurls and often lead the tribes.

Some tribes may not have Samachurls, which is the result of younger, stronger members overthrowing them. These tribes are most likely led by Mitachurls and are far more aggressive. Even fewer tribes are led by Lawachurls, as the few that are around prefer solitude and dislike the reverence the younger members give them.

===Sleeper Tribe===
The Sleeper Tribe Hilichurls are known for napping whenever possible. Due to their emphasis on sleeping, the Sleeper Tribe is rumored to have extremely soft animal-skin beds.

===Meaty Tribe===
The Meaty Tribe Hilichurls are known for making sacrifices on a regular basis. They pray for meat every day and highly value strength. Apart from building huge altars, they possess a massive cooking pot and a huge arena for members of the tribe to spar.

===Eclipse Tribe===
The Hilichurls of the Eclipse Tribe are said to be extremely mysterious; all Hilichurls of that tribe know how to draw an eclipse symbol. It is rumored that the Dada Samachurls of this tribe know the reasoning behind this.

==Lore==
It is heavily implied that hilichurls were once human beings who were cursed by the Gods for "sinning." Whilst the punishment of the Gods could take many forms (such as immortality), this particular affliction is known as the "curse of wilderness," which causes people to transform into monsters and grants them an unnaturally prolonged life. Given that the Hilichurls' existence has been known for over a thousand years, it is likely they originate from the many ancient civilizations that once thrived on Teyvat before their eventual demise in various catastrophic events across [[Teyvat]]'s history. In particular, their presence has increased since the [[Cataclysm]] occurring 500 years ago<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Hilichurl}}</ref> - coinciding with the destruction of the ancient human civilization of [[Khaenri'ah]]. In fact, [[Dainsleif]] confirms that the hilichurls encountered in the Chasm are actually the former citizens of Khaenri'ah,<ref name="RequiemED">{{Ref/Quest|Requiem of the Echoing Depths}}</ref> and [[Chlothar|Chlothar Alberich]] further reveals that only those Khaenri'ans with mixed ancestry were transformed into hilichurls, being seen as "lesser sinners" than the pureblooded Khaenri'ans.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Caribert}}</ref>

Due to the curse, memories of their former life are gradually forgotten, as well as most semblances of humanity they once had. Their intelligence and behavior are gradually degraded, and they can no longer speak nor understand the common language of Teyvat. Despite all this, Hilichurls still seem to be capable of at least some rudimentary self-awareness and emotion. For instance, they still recall what it was like to have a human face, as the reason they wear masks to hide their true countenance is because they cannot stand the mental anguish of seeing their own hideous reflections in a body of water.<ref name="RequiemED" />

Hilichurls are unable to truly die a natural death on account of their immortality; as they grow older, their physical bodies and mental state erode to the point that is like 'death'. Because of this, aged Hilichurls are in a state of perpetual agony. However, Hilichurls seem to know that they are cursed, and are also somehow aware of the properties of an area in [[The Chasm]] that can temporarily assuage the effects of their curse. Therefore, some Hilichurls instinctively venture to this region when they want to 'die' - ignoring all bodily needs of food or defense, and desiring nothing else than to waste away with at least some semblance of comfort.

==Trivia==
*It is not confirmed who or what the hilichurls from more than 500 years ago are. However, there is a [[Frostarm Lawachurl]] enemy on [[Dragonspine]] who is named [[Ukko]], suggesting that Khaenri'ah is not the only destroyed civilization with people who turned into hilichurls.
**It seems that Hilichurls have an affinity for remnants of the past.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Hilichurl Cultural Customs|2}}</ref>
[[File:Ikku Amanojaku.jpg|thumb|A traditional depiction of an Amanojaku]]
*Hilichurls may be inspired by a type of ''{{w|oni}}'' called {{Lang|''{{w|Amanojaku}}''|ja=天邪鬼|ja_tl=heavenly evil spirit}}. It is also called a {{Lang|''jaki''|ja=邪鬼}} in some branches of Buddhism. These creatures are also the inspiration for the main enemy type in the game ''{{w|Ōkami}}'', which also wear masks.
*The word ''Hilifolk'' may be intended as a collective synonym for Hilichurls; the term is written in the [[Teyvat Language|Teyvat alphabet]] on the covers of [[Hilichurl Cultural Customs]] and the [[Handy Handbook of Hilichurlian]].
**Hilichurls are also called "hill devils", but [[Ella Musk]] calls them "hill dwellers" instead.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Achievement: Hill Dwellers}}</ref>
*A tribe in Dadaupa Gorge called the Eclipse tribe worships an object that appears to represent an eclipsed sun. The tribe or the object might be a reference to the now fallen [[Eclipse Dynasty]] in [[Khaenri'ah]].
*Hilichurls seem to recite poems or songs, according to Jacob Musk. These range from expressions of grief, festivity, and so on.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Hilichurl Ballad Selection}}</ref>
*The [[manga]] depicts beings resembling Hilichurls that existed during the time of [[Vennessa]], though they are different in appearance compared to their present-day counterparts. For example, they are shown to have more colorful masks, and could be seen using traditional bows instead of the crossbows now wielded by Hilichurl Shooters. Notably, there was also a kind of flying creature with bat-like wings that is not known to appear in any other media.<ref>{{Ref/Manga|0|pg=56-59}}</ref>
**None of the hilichurl designs seen in the prologue appear afterwards. However, Chapter 5 of the manga depicts hilichurls in present-day with Amber. These hilichurls have the same design used in-game and in official media.
*An unarmed Hilichurl will throw rocks with their left, suggesting that it's supposed to be also used by Hilichurl Fighters (who wield clubs with their right).
* If a Pyro Hilichurl Grenadier attempts to dig out a slime in shallow water, they will humorously show up empty handed while looking on with confusion. Cryo Hilichurl Grenadiers can successfully do so. However, and interestingly, the Cryo slimes they dig up appear to be Frozen.
* In some areas of Sumeru and during specific one-time off events and commissions, players may encounter unconscious hilichurls laying on the ground, most often near active dangerous enemies. These always utilize the normal, plain hilichurl model and can be seen moving when examined up close.
