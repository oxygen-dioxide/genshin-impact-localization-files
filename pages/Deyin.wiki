==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Deyin:''' There is a saying: "No matter how many things rise and fall in this world, a clear spring will always flow alone."
:'''Deyin:''' Scholars should stay true to their hearts and tell elegant stories. If they only speak of mundane affairs, they might as well say nothing...
:{{DIcon}} You are...
::'''Deyin:''' I lack such talent, for I only count as a jade artisan and half a poet. But in the past, I would also occasionally tell stories at the [[Yilong Wharf]] teahouse.
::{{DIcon}} A jadeworker?
:::'''Deyin:''' Hah! When I was young, I was one of the best jade artisans in Chenyu Vale.
:::'''Deyin:''' There's always an inextricable connection between beautiful jade and fascinating stories.
:::'''Deyin:''' As such, I would tell my neighbors stories I had heard while carving jade, which made me somewhat famous in the area.
:::'''Deyin:''' Nowadays, I occasionally give [[Fengtai|my disciple]] some of my jade works to sell on my behalf.
:::'''Deyin:''' If you go to Yilong Wharf, you can visit [[Fengtai General Goods|my disciple's store]]. Maybe you'll come away with jadeware piece that tickles your fancy.
::{{DIcon}} From before?
:::'''Deyin:''' Recently, [[Jiewu|a youth]] has been coming to the teahouse, telling of the most humdrum happenings in the streets, thinking to please the people.
:::'''Deyin:''' A joke about a Fontainian who made a fool of themselves while drinking tea here, a story about a Monstadter who was knocked out after drinking three bowls of a local spirit there...
:::'''Deyin:''' While it's true that outsiders don't understand our traditions and do many outlandish things, it's better to only discuss such things over a cup of tea or after meals.
:::'''Deyin:''' On the stage, it's better to speak of more elegant affairs.
:::{{DIcon}} As long as tempers have cooled off, and everyone's feeling happier.
:::'''Deyin:''' I'm not angry at all. I just feel like it's a shame.
:::'''Deyin:''' Yilong Wharf's a real riot compared to Qiaoying Village, so I get why travelers restlessly spoil for some fun while passing through.
:::'''Deyin:''' However, at the end of the day, Chenyu Vale has Adeptus [[Fujin]] and our thousands of ancestors who endured great hardships to lay foundations down for us, so that there might be endless stories worth telling.
:::'''Deyin:''' As such, a mixture of mundane matters and elegant tales of the past should be told on stage.
:::'''Deyin:''' I wonder when that youth will understand...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Deyin:''' See you, then.
