: '''Ifa's Message:''' "I hope you all remember to perform regular health checkups on your [[Saurian]] companions. Like humans, they can be quite obstinate at times."
: '''Ifa's Message:''' "If you feel as though something is off during your daily interactions with them, please come in for a check-up immediately. Doctor [[Chuychu]] and I can both help out."
: '''Ifa's Message:''' "I recommend Doctor Chuychu for human injuries. If a Saurian is injured, come find me."
: '''Ifa's Message:''' "Anyway, don't be pig-headed, alright? This applies to both humans and Saurians."
