The '''Hydro Archon''' was the title of the '''God of Justice'''<ref group="Note">In ''[[Masquerade of the Guilty]]'', Focalors states that Egeria's justice was "existence," and that Focalors's justice was the "continuation" of that existence. This implies that both gods are Gods of Justice.</ref> among [[The Seven]] who presided over [[Fontaine]], the land of [[Hydro]]. There have been two holders of this title:
# [[Egeria]], the first Hydro Archon who granted the [[Oceanid]]s human forms and life through the [[Primordial Sea]]. Her creations followed her up until she was slain during the [[Cataclysm]], and was turned into the waters of the [[Amrita Pool|Amrita]].
# [[Focalors]], the second and last Hydro Archon, who executed herself via the [[Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale]] in order to deceive the [[Heavenly Principles]] to save Fontaine from [[Prophecy of Fontaine|prophesized doom]].
#* [[Furina]], the body and spirit of Focalors who publicly acted as the Hydro Archon in Focalors' stead to help her save Fontaine from the prophecy.

As of {{Quest|Masquerade of the Guilty}}, Focalors's self-execution resulted in the destruction of the divine throne of the Hydro Archon. Its authority over the element of Hydro now belongs solely to [[Neuvillette]], as the [[Hydro Sovereign]]. Furina also abdicated the position of the Hydro Archon afterward to live as an ordinary Fontainian.
