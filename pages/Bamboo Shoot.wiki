==Trivia==
* Despite being found growing naturally only in [[Liyue]] (as of [[Version 2.3]]), Bamboo Shoots are mentioned in a possible description of a "Good Fortune" [[Fortune Slip]] from the [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Subarea)|Grand Narukami Shrine]], and are also used in the Inazuman dishes [[Tonkotsu Ramen]] and [[Wakatakeni]], implying that they canonically also grow in [[Inazuma]].
