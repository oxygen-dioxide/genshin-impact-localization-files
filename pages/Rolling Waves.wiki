The top of Beidou's hair is tied up with an intricate gold hairpin with a pale blue tassel hanging from one end. Her fringe parts around her right eye, slightly covering her left. She has a black leotard underneath a bright red sleeveless qipao dress, with side slits going up to her hips and the chest area cut out. Over that, she wears a fur-lined red shawl around her shoulders. Her {{Electro}} [[Vision]] hangs at the left side of her waist. Additionally, she wears a pair of fingerless, elbow-length black gloves.
