'''Plaustrite''' is an elemental<ref>{{Ref/Item|Plaustrite Shard}}</ref> mineral found in [[Liyue]] known for its anti-gravity properties. Objects built with Plaustrite are able to float. It is used in the creation of [[Xiao Lantern]]s, and can be encountered in the open world and in [[Domains]] in the form of [[Plaustrite Platform]]s.

==Properties==
Plaustrite is a material able to hover in place in the air, and objects carved from or embed with Plaustrite share this ability. It does not float by default, requiring to be activated first. Before activation, it weighs approximately the same amount as other types of stone.<ref name="AQI-1-2">{{Ref/Quest|Seagaze Sunset}}</ref>

The most common color of Plaustrite is green, but varieties of other colors exist. There is little difference between the properties of regular Plaustrite and other-colored Plaustrite; their names were simply given to them by gemstone merchants to impress customers, and as a result, their price is significantly higher compared to regular Plaustrite.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Currents Deep Beneath the Lanterns}}</ref>

==Varieties of Plaustrite==
* {{Item|Plaustrite Shard|30|text="Common" Plaustrite}}
* {{Item|Azurite|30}}
* {{Item|Vermillionite|30}}
** Sunset Vermillionite is a name given to particularly large chunks of Vermillionite.

==Usage==
This material has been used in various constructions and objects, mostly in [[Liyue]]:
* [[Plaustrite Platform]]s, small platforms found in various places around Liyue.
** In the [[Hidden Palace of Guizang Formula]] [[Domain]], blue Plaustrite Platforms are encountered. They are very similar to their normal counterparts but appear and disappear periodically.
** [[Bu'yun]]'s platform to transport visitors from [[Liyue Harbor]] to the Jade Chamber is a specially carved Plaustrite Platform.
* The foundation of [[Minlin]]'s [[Statue of The Seven]].
* The foundation of [[Cloud Retainer]]'s ''Dwelling in the Clouds'', above [[Qingyun Peak]].
* Large platforms in [[Adepti]] abodes.
* [[Ningguang]]'s [[Jade Chamber]].
** Specifically, it uses Sunset Vermillionite.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Jade Chamber Rising}}</ref>
** The Chamber is able to be moved at will, thanks to a mechanism constructed with [[Wonder Core]]s and [[Adepti Sigil]]s.
* Certain [[Furnishings]] used in the [[Serenitea Pot]]:
** [[Landform/Floating Platform|Floating Platforms]]
** [[Sub-Space Cabochon: In Soaring Flight]]
* [[Xiao Lantern]]s and the Mingxiao Lantern, two types of floating lanterns crafted and released by the people of Liyue during the [[Lantern Rite Festival]].
* [[Moonchase Charm]]s of the [[Moonchase Festival]], carved from Plaustrite Shards.

==Trivia==
* Obtaining a piece of Sunset Vermillionite is one of the main goals of the [[Interlude Chapter]] Act [[The Crane Returns on the Wind]].
** Sunset Vermillionite is extremely rare and expansive to start with, and because of Ningguang's contest, its price inflated even more by the time the [[Traveler]] inquired to buy some. The [[Feiyun Commerce Guild]] was planning to auction one piece off, and according to [[Xingqiu]]'s estimation, it could potentially go for over 500 million [[Mora]] given the current demand.
** The [[Adepti|adeptus]] [[Sea Gazer]] had a piece of Sunset Vermillionite among their treasures.<ref name="AQI-1-2" />
* The [[Jade Chamber#Jade Chamber Intel Wall|Jade Chamber Intel Wall]] contains a message written in the [[Teyvat Language]] about investment unexpectedly pouring into the Plaustrite market, which may be the result of the [[Fatui]].
