|text1    = These ancient machines, which come from the desert, are quite distinct from the [[Ruin Machine]]s. In combat, these [[Primal Construct]]s will fire their components out while their cores enter an "invisible" state that hides them and increases their RES. {{Color|help|Use Catalyze reactions to strike these cores or use Electro attacks on them during such times as the fired components have been destroyed and need to recover}} to cancel this invisibility and cause the cores to be immobilized due to excessive overclocking.
