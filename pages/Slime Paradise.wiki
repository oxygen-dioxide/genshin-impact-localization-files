'''Slime Paradise''' is a web [[event]] in [[Version 1.2]].

==Requirements==
Reach [[Adventure Rank]] 10.

The PlayStation®4 version of this event was released later on '''March 25, 2021 13:00 (UTC+8)'''<ref>Twitter: [https://twitter.com/GenshinImpact/status/1369294401378250752 PlayStation®4 Version Announcement]</ref> due to issues with account mechanics.

==Rules==
===About the Park===
During the park's dates of operation, Travelers can purchase decorations and arrange them in the park. Certain decorations will attract certain slimes to move in and certain monsters to visit the park. The more decorations you purchase, the more lively the park will be!

'''{{Item|Paradise Coin|30|text=Paradise Coins}}:'''<br />
You'll need to spend Paradise Coins to purchase things in the Decorations Shop. Earn Paradise Coins by completing daily tasks.

'''{{Item|Paradise Ticket|30|text=Paradise Tickets}}:'''<br />
You'll need to spend Paradise Tickets to purchase things in the Rewards Shop. As a Park Opening Gift, 100 Paradise Tickets are given initially. You can obtain Paradise Tickets in the following ways:

# By completing certain event tasks.
# From decorations: After purchasing a decoration, it will begin generating Paradise Tickets at a designated time each day starting on the next day. Designated time: Daily at 00:00 (Server time).
# From monsters: Monsters will come to visit the park every day. Each time a different kind of monster visits for the first time, they will bring you a greeting gift of Paradise Tickets.

'''Gallery - Photos'''<br />
If you purchase decorations and visit the park frequently, you can collect different photos. See [[Slime Paradise/Gallery]] for gallery photos and descriptions.

===Park Tips===
# You must purchase the right decorations to attract specific slimes to move in and specific monsters to visit. Pay attention to the decoration descriptions for clues!
# When a slime moves in, it will stay at the park for the rest of the event - they simply don't want to leave!
# Visits will refresh daily. When a guest visits, they will stay in the park until they leave the next day. (When you have a new decoration that attracts new kind of guest, that kind of guest will visit first the next day.)
# All of the daily tasks, visitor events, earnings, and monster visits referred to in these rules refresh at 00:00 daily (based on the time of the server your character is on). ('''Asia:''' UTC+8; '''America:''' UTC−5; '''Europe:''' UTC+1; '''TW,HK,MO:''' UTC+8)
# The Rewards Shop will be open for the same duration as the event. It will be unavailable once the event ends, so don't forget to claim your prizes on time!

==Decorations Shop==
''See [[Slime Paradise/Story]] for visitor messages.''

Each new monster apart from Slimes that visits gets a small descriptive blurb alongside a 150 {{Item|Paradise Ticket|30}} gift. When [[Unusual Hilichurl]] visits, 500 {{Item|Paradise Ticket|30}} is gifted instead. Each 300 coin costing decoration can also be interacted with for amusement by clicking on a specific spot on them.
