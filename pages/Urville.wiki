==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Urville:''' Oh, it's you...
:{{DIcon}} You seem a little down. What's wrong?
::'''Urville:''' Well, that probably has something to do with you... or myself, rather. I was bragging about how I'd have struck it rich the next time we met...
::'''Urville:''' But the truth is, wealth has remained as elusive as ever.
::{{DIcon}} Just keep your feet on the ground and work hard, and one day...
:::'''Urville:''' Nadia said the same thing. You're all more knowledgeable about this than I am, so I'll trust you.
:::'''Urville:''' Actually, working here is a solid gig. It keeps you busy, unlike before when I was treasure hunting outside. You could go for days, or even weeks, without any discoveries.
:::'''Urville:''' You're right! I should work hard and be diligent from today onwards!
::{{DIcon}} Treasure hunt not going well?
:::'''Urville:''' Yes, indeed. I actually tried diving to search for clues before that could lead to treasure, but I was too weak.
:::'''Urville:''' [[Ball Octopus]]es are so hard to deal with...
:::'''Urville:''' But I won't give up. Someday, I'll defeat them on my own terms. Only then can I continue moving forward.
:{{DIcon}} I'm sure you have things to do.
::'''Urville:''' Very well. Goodbye.
