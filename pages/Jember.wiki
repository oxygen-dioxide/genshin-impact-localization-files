==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
Jember participated in Natlan's defence against the [[Abyss]] invasion.

If the Traveler did not visit the refugee camp, by the time they arrived, the area had been overrun by monsters. After clearing them, they discovered [[Kunak]] and [[Libiac]], who had hid from them after trying to run away when everyone else was killed. The Traveler offered their hot air balloon to bring them back to the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]], but before the two could make a decision, Jember and a few warriors arrived, surprised that there were survivors. He offered to bring the two back to the stadium, and they accepted.
