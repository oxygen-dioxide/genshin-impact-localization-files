==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|A sudden accident occurs at the scene of the magic show, and the chosen audience member is also nowhere to be found. All indications point to Lyney and Lynette, but you have your doubts...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo fdaq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hello, Officer. How's the investigation going?
:{{DIcon}} We're Lyney and [[Lynette]]'s attorneys.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 1 esmond 01.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' Ah, I see. You must be the traveler that Lady [[Furina]] mentioned. Listen, I'll be perfectly honest with you... I'd avoid getting mixed up in this whirlpool of a mess if I were you.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What do you mean?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 1 esmond 02.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' Come with me and you'll see.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 1 esmond 03.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' The deceased is one of Lyney's assistants, named [[Cowell]]. Even though he hadn't joined the troupe long, he was hardworking and everyone generally liked him.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 1 esmond 04.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' The assistants are usually in charge of setting up and inspecting the props, as well as assisting with the show and keeping the crowd engaged.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 1 esmond 05.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' As you probably saw when you were in the audience, the water tank suddenly fell and smashed the box with Cowell inside it.
:{{DIcon}} But why was Cowell inside?
:{{DIcon}} Wasn't the girl supposed to be in there?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 1 esmond 06.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' This is the real mystery. We've already searched the scene and were unable to find any traces of the girl.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 1 esmond 07.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' However, if you look carefully, the box was positioned directly under the water tank. The ropes holding the tank were then burned by the pyrotechnics on stage, causing them to snap.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 1 esmond 08.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' All these factors lining up so perfectly makes it hard to see this as a mere accident.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 1 esmond 09.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' If anything, the more logical explanation is that the whole incident was intentionally planned, and Lyney is the most likely person to have access to all these areas.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But he doesn't have a motive...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 1 esmond 10.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' Are you both good friends of his?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, well, you can't say we're "good friends," but we've known each other for, uh, a little while.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 1 esmond 11.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' So in just a short time, he was not only able to win your trust, but even convince you to act as his attorneys.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 1 esmond 12.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' I know there's no such thing as "magic." The real trick of a magician is holding the audience in the palm of their hand.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 1 esmond 13.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' I've seen a lot of cases, and I can tell you that people are the least reliable kind of evidence.
:{{DIcon}} But that's not always true.
:{{DIcon}} People can also be the most reliable evidence.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 1 esmond 14.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' Sorry, I tend to be pretty straightforward... Just know that I'm warning you for your own good.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 1 esmond 15.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' Anyway, you may investigate the scene of the crime yourselves if you're curious. Who knows, maybe you'll be able to come up with some new evidence.

:;("Gardes Investigation Report" and "The Deceased's Identity" added to the Case Record)

;(Talk to [[Esmond]] again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq003 esmond 01.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' Go ahead, have a look around. In the end, we're both after the truth.

;(Investigate the rope)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So this is the rope that broke and caused the water tank to fall.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The rope looks pretty durable! How could it be burned through so quickly by fireworks?
:{{DIcon}} (So either Lyney didn't realize this was a safety concern...)
:{{DIcon}} (Or...)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm? Why are you suddenly so serious, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} I'm just looking at where the rope snapped.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa! Look, this bit's made from different material!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Most of it was burned away, but there's still a little bit of it left.
:{{DIcon}} It seems to be flammable.
:{{DIcon}} Like a type of flash cotton.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, so if a rope meant to hold something was made with that kind of material in it, then that means...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, Paimon should write all this down! Let's take notes!
:;("Special Rope" added to the Case Record)

;(Examine the White Line)
:'''Examine White Line:''' (This is where the magic box was struck. If Cowell weren't inside the box at that moment, he might've dodged the falling water tank.)

;(Examine the Damaged Magic Box)
:'''Examine Damaged Magic Box:''' (The broken magic box was left on the scene after the Gardes completed their investigation. Looking at it now, the water tank must've struck it really hard...)

;(Talk to [[Maurice]])
:{{A|vo fdaq003 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hello there. What are you investigating?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 9 mavis 01.ogg}} '''Maurice:''' Hmm? Oh, this location has also been cordoned off because the magic troupe members are currently considered prime suspects. The investigation team is still collecting evidence.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 9 mavis 02.ogg}} '''Maurice:''' The seats were all booked in advance, so we were able to deduce the missing woman's identity by checking the guest list.
:{{DIcon}} Could you tell us who she is?
:{{DIcon}} We're Lyney and Lynette's attorneys.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 9 mavis 03.ogg}} '''Maurice:''' Sure, it's not like this is confidential information. We will publish it later anyway when we petition the public to help us find the missing person.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 9 mavis 04.ogg}} '''Maurice:''' Her name is Halsey. She's a painter from Fontaine who's made a bit of a name for herself.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 9 mavis 05.ogg}} '''Maurice:''' Apparently, she wasn't a regular at the opera house, but she'd been feeling some pressure with her work lately, which made her decide to come see the magic show.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 9 mavis 06.ogg}} '''Maurice:''' The magic troupe members all claim to not know her. We have looked into her social connections. It seems that she has no personal grievances or conflicts of interest with the suspects.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 9 mavis 07.ogg}} '''Maurice:''' Simply put, she wasn't related to the magic troupe at all, which matches the features of the previous serial disappearances.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Were the victims of the previous cases also chosen at random?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 9 mavis 08.ogg}} '''Maurice:''' That's how it seems to us, in any case. Apart from the fact that they were all young women of around the same age range, there really weren't any other connections between them.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... Okay then.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for letting us know all this.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 9 mavis 09.ogg}} '''Maurice:''' No need to be so formal. If you do happen to see the missing girl, please be sure to contact us.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 9 mavis 10.ogg}} '''Maurice:''' It is of utmost importance that we get to the bottom of these disappearances.
:;("Information About the Missing Lady's Identity" added to the Case Record)

;(Talk to Maurice again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq003 mavis 01.ogg}} '''Maurice:''' If you do encounter Ms. Halsey, please contact the Gardes immediately.

;(Talk to [[Quentin]] or [[Vaughn]])
:{{A|vo fdaq003 5 kent 01.ogg}} '''Quentin:''' The investigation team has some new findings. Turns out there's an issue with the random number selector after all.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 5 vaughn 01.ogg}} '''Vaughn:''' See, I told you. What if the machine picked some big guy's seat? You think the murderer would've still made his move then?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sorry to interrupt, but we're helping Lyney and Lynette with their side of the investigation. What were you saying about the number selector? There's something wrong with it?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 5 kent 02.ogg}} '''Quentin:''' You're trying to help them? Heh, that'll be a tall order.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 5 vaughn 02.ogg}} '''Vaughn:''' Lyney used the machine to pick a random member of the audience during his performance, right? The lucky girl that later disappeared.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 5 vaughn 03.ogg}} '''Vaughn:''' Well, we thought there might be a serious problem with the machine, so we had it taken away for further inspection.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 5 kent 03.ogg}} '''Quentin:''' It turns out that the seat number it picked wasn't random at all. The machine picks that same number every time.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 5 kent 04.ogg}} '''Quentin:''' I'm sure you already know that you have to make a reservation in advance to get a seat, regardless of whether it's a trial or some performance.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 5 kent 05.ogg}} '''Quentin:''' In other words, Lyney knew who would be sitting where from the very beginning.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, that much checks out. Lyney reserved our seats for us, too...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 5 kent 06.ogg}} '''Quentin:''' Bet you see why I was saying it'd be tough to make a case for Lyney.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks, sorry to bother you.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, even though it's bad for Lyney's case, Paimon had better write it down.
:;("Random Number Selector" added to the Case Record)

;(Talk to Quentin or Vaughn again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq003 kent 01.ogg}} '''Quentin:''' Lyney's magic tricks were the stuff of legends. But the way he did this crime... *sigh* He should've stuck to doing magic.
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq003 vaughn 01.ogg}} '''Vaughn:''' Haha! Look, doing magic tricks is one thing, pulling off a crime is something else entirely. Maybe he was just too full of himself.

;(Examine the Magic Box)
:'''Examine Magic Box:''' (It looks like an ordinary box, but Lyney somehow moved instantly from the stage to being inside of it... how did he do it?)

;(Talk to [[Esildor]])
:{{A|vo fdaq003 7 ethelred 01.ogg}} '''Esildor:''' I see that you're investigating the area. Well, it just so happens that I'm interested, too.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 7 ethelred 02.ogg}} '''Esildor:''' If you find any new and interesting leads, be sure to share them with me, alright?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We don't have too many thoughts yet...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 7 ethelred 03.ogg}} '''Esildor:''' Hehe, then why don't I tell you my hypothesis first? The way I see it, it all started with that loud thud.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The thud? Oh, you mean the sound that happened during the countdown?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 7 ethelred 04.ogg}} '''Esildor:''' Yes, exactly. It wasn't terribly loud, but I suspect that most people heard it.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 7 ethelred 05.ogg}} '''Esildor:''' It's just that everyone was awaiting the result of Lyney's trick with bated breath, so no one paid it much mind. But now that the incident has happened, the thud has become an important clue.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, that makes sense. So, what do you make of it?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 7 ethelred 06.ogg}} '''Esildor:''' I'm of the opinion that it may have been the sound of Lyney's accomplice &mdash; Lynette perhaps &mdash; jumping atop the water tank, or something like that.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 7 ethelred 07.ogg}} '''Esildor:''' And when the pyrotechnics went off, she cut the rope, sending the water tank crashing down!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But wasn't the noise we heard too loud for that?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 7 ethelred 08.ogg}} '''Esildor:''' Perhaps the balance wasn't right, leading to a particularly rough landing.
:{{DIcon}} Then wouldn't the water tank have started to swing a bit in that case?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 7 ethelred 09.ogg}} '''Esildor:''' That's true. Hmm, I suppose I must reconsider...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, that does remind Paimon, though. What was with that sound?
:;("Strange Sound During the Magic Show" added to the Case Record)

;(Talk to Esildor again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq003 ethelred 01.ogg}} '''Esildor:''' Hmm... Could it be that I didn't see it happen?

;(Talk to Lynette, Lyney, or [[Molly]])
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq003 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Lyney's still talking to the Gardes. It seems he'll have a lot of explaining to do...
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq003 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I think someone will be assigned to monitor us later, but that's alright.

;(Leave the central opera area)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Hey, you! Yes, both of you! Over here! I've been keeping an eye on you for a while now.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, you mean us?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 02.ogg}} '''???:''' That's right! If I'm not mistaken, you're also among those who wish to cut down the thorns and pursue the truth, no? And by the looks of it, you're not from Fontaine.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, you're right on the Mora about that one... But who are you?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Hehehe, have you never heard of the [[Spina di Rosula]]?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 04.ogg}} '''???:''' From mediating disputes and providing protection, to solving conundrums &mdash; you name it, Spina di Rosula does it.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And I, [[Navia]], have the honor of being its renowned president...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...Though those who play by our rules call me "Boss."
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 silver 01.ogg}} '''Silver:''' I'm [[Silver]], her attendant. Pleased to meet you.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 marcillac 01.ogg}} '''Melus:''' And I'm [[Melus]]. Demoiselle's various daily needs and affairs are under my purview.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Boss, Demoiselle... What gives with the names?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Ahem... Well, I am the second-generation president. Melus and the others are still used to my... previous title.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 marcillac 02.ogg}} '''Melus:''' My apologies, Demoiselle. Should you prefer "Boss," I will endeavor to use that instead.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' No, no need. You don't have to call me Boss, just "Navia" is fine!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, if you say so... Not that we're members of Spina di Rosula, anyway!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Haha, all merely trifling details, never mind. Now, back to the situation at hand.
:{{DIcon}} So you want to investigate as well?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' That's right. I've always kept an eye on the serial disappearance cases &mdash; my interest stems from a matter back from [[Callas|my father]]'s time.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Judging from the look of things, I find Lyney an unlikely mastermind.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? We think so too! That's why we're looking for clues now.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But how did you come to that conclusion?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Intuition, naturally. My unparalleled intuition!
:{{DIcon}} Uh, okay...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Furina sure was quick to point the finger at Lyney without any decisive evidence whatsoever, wasn't she?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 14.ogg}} '''Navia:''' But that's not uncommon for her. If you remember, the Justice had to interrupt her and ask if she was pressing charges just to keep her from getting carried away.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 15.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Anyway, a trial begins the moment someone levels charges. And of course, there was no way Furina was going to back down in that situation.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sounds more like you just don't trust the Hydro Archon.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 16.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, what's your opinion? I must admit that she can be interesting at times, but liking her doesn't mean that I'll blindly agree with her.
:{{DIcon}} Well, when you put it like that...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 17.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Alright, I've answered your question. Now it's time you answer mine.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait a minute, did that answer count?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 18.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, I say it does. But don't worry! You won't hear any pointless questions from me!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 19.ogg}} '''Navia:''' In your opinion, do you think it's right to treat a trial like it's an opera?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, well...
:{{DIcon}} Not always.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 20.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And why would that be?
:{{DIcon}} Doing so makes it easy for the truth to fall by the wayside.
:{{DIcon}} Something serious like a trial shouldn't be treated like entertainment.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 21.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hahaha! See, Silver and Melus? I told you they'd be different!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 marcillac 03.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Most astute of you, Demoiselle. I, too, think that the Traveler's response was most excellent.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 marcillac 04.ogg}} '''Melus:''' No matter how wonderful the script or how fervent the audience's expectations may be, the trials that go on stage here must be based in fact.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 marcillac 05.ogg}} '''Melus:''' And if that can be done, Boss, then&mdash;
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 22.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Alright, that's quite enough, Melus. Anyway, I like your answer. You pass with flying colors!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 23.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Now, I need to make some preparations, following which our joint investigation shall commence... You two shall be my assistants!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, since when did we become assistants!?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 24.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hmm? Oh. Well, I can be the assistant, sure &mdash; or your companion, if you like. I'm really not that fussy.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmph. That's more like it.
:{{DIcon}} I think you're missing the point, Paimon...
:{{DIcon}} Seems you've already agreed, then.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 marcillac 06.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Far be it from me to brag, but I believe that Demoiselle's intuition will be instrumental in uncovering the truth.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 marcillac 07.ogg}} '''Melus:''' You wish to save a friend from false accusations, and we wish to unravel the disappearances. In this sense, our goals are aligned.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, you have a point. You're quite the talker, aren't you, mister?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And what about you over there? What do you think? You seem like you've got something on your mind.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 silver 02.ogg}} '''Silver:''' I have nothing to add.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, alrighty then...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 14 navia 25.ogg}} '''Navia:''' We'll be making some preparations first. Just be sure to let us know if they start revealing Lyney's tricks. Thanks!

;(Talk to Silver, Navia, or Melus again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq003 silver 01.ogg}} '''Silver:''' Speaking of that, I think magic shows would be very popular in [[Poisson]].
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq003 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I can see that... Hmm, maybe I should try to learn some magic. If I could make things disappear, cleaning my room would be a cinch!
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq003 marcillac 01.ogg}} '''Melus:''' You need not worry about such things, Demoiselle. That falls under my duties.
:{{A|vo dialog fdaq003 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...Oh, right.

;(Talk to [[Tristane]])
:{{A|vo fdaq003 11 trista 01.ogg}} '''Tristane:''' Sorry, but no one can freely enter or exit the opera house at the moment. If you wish to leave, you must register your identity with us first.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 11 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, no, we're not leaving... we're representing Lyney and Lynette as attorneys, so we're investigating the case.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 11 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Were you always guarding this entrance?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 11 trista 02.ogg}} '''Tristane:''' Yes, after the Chief Justice gave the order, everyone coming in or out must undergo a strict inspection.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 11 trista 03.ogg}} '''Tristane:''' So the missing girl couldn't have left from here &mdash; at least not from that point on.
:{{DIcon}} What about during the show?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 11 trista 04.ogg}} '''Tristane:''' I doubt there was much opportunity then, either.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 11 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How can you be so sure, hmm?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 11 trista 05.ogg}} '''Tristane:''' Well, because I was in charge of security near the entrance at that time.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 11 trista 06.ogg}} '''Tristane:''' I couldn't see Lyney's performance from here, which was quite a shame... Just my luck.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 11 trista 07.ogg}} '''Tristane:''' But still, I did not abandon my post, and I stayed put no matter how loud the applause was. If someone had so much as even approached the door, I would have noticed it, let alone if they had tried to leave.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 11 trista 08.ogg}} '''Tristane:''' We [[Melusine]]s are good at that sort of thing, you know.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, it's safe to say the girl couldn't have left through here...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 11 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, thanks for your help. This'll be useful info!

;(After investigating all clues)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 16 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've checked everything of note here at the performance venue. Hmm. Paimon wonders how Lyney's discussion with the Gardes is going.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 16 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go see, shall we? Things are getting interesting, huh? We're about to see how magic is made!

;(Approach Lyney, Lynette, and Molly)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 molly 01.ogg}} '''Molly:''' Understood, then I will be going with you. Just so you're aware, I will be monitoring your actions and making notes as necessary.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Very good, thanks for being so agreeable. I'd pull a rose out of my hat as a gift for you, if I could.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 molly 02.ogg}} '''Molly:''' You may spare the pleasantries. I'm just doing my job.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' You've arrived. Ah, who's this?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Me? I'm Spina di Rosula's guardian angel... If you've got a problem, I've got the firepower.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Haha, sorry. I got a little carried away there... Call me Navia. I'm a partner of theirs, and will be helping investigate this whole situation.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And these are my companions. Would you mind if they join as well?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Fine by me...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Oh, new helpers? I would be most grateful!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, let's just say we're tagging along... It's not every day that you get to see the secrets behind magic performed on such a large scale!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hehe, I appreciate your kind interest. Come with me, we'll be heading below stage.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Below stage?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Yes, a world of secrets is hidden beneath this magic box, prepared specifically for this switcheroo trick.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But before I reveal everything, you should have a look first. Notice anything strange here?
:;(Lyney opens the off-stage box)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I'm not trying to be dramatic, remembering the details of a trick will help you understand the methods used to perform it more easily.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Huh. Weren't there balloons and other decorations here? Where did all that go?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Ah, good eye! That said, you're still far from discovering the answer.
:{{DIcon}} The back of the door isn't the same.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... "The back"? You mean the inside of the door? What's different about it? Paimon didn't notice anything...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Haha, very good indeed. I thought you might not be able to catch that, given that you were sitting in the first row.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' The back of this door was patterned. Those patterns are now gone, replaced by a smooth wooden board.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' So if you put two and two together, what do you get?
:{{DIcon}} Wait, does that mean...
:{{DIcon}} There's another box inside this one?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 17 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Haha, exactly! Alright, let's go. I'll tell you how it works as we head down.
:;(The group goes below the stage)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so there was a passageway under the magic box!
:{{DIcon}} And this passage linked the two boxes together.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Haha. I knew you'd figure out most of it as soon as you saw this place.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' The two magic boxes are positioned right above the two entrances of the tunnel.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' See this flatbed trolley?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' The box with the lucky audience member in it would be shuttled over to the other side using the trolley.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' This trolley can raise and lower, and even rotate, ensuring that the box will face in the right direction.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I see, so that's the purpose of the box inside another box!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Precisely. The inner box would descend after the audience member was put inside and be moved along on the trolley, all while the outer box would remain onstage, as if nothing had ever changed.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's how you did it!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Once the box was lowered, the trolley would store some energy through this device here, with which it would complete the rest of the steps.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' The audience member would only be able to feel some slight movements in the dark, and by the time she walked out, she would already be back onstage.
:{{DIcon}} Then what about your side of the trick?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right. You were talking that whole time, and you even came out for a moment near the end.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Ah yes, a phonograph operated by Lynette was used to achieve that effect.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' My assistant and I had already scripted our conversation beforehand. When the countdown began, I had already gone to the opposite box via a tunnel using that ladder.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And what about Lynette? Where was she?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' I was in a mezzanine space in the back of the box.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, interesting!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' That's how we were able to coordinate Lyney's lines with the assistant... And by the way, I was the one who walked out of the box at the end.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I mean, we are twins. All it takes is a change of clothes and no one can tell who's who, hehe.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' And that's my favorite part of this trick &mdash; only Lynette and I can perform it.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's how it all worked. Wow, every detail you revealed was more amazing than the last!
:{{DIcon}} I can tell a lot of thought was put into this.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 lyney 12.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Lynette would briefly walk out of the box and then go back in, jumping into the tunnel and escaping before the box on the trolley could finish ascending.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 lyney 13.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' And then I walk out of the other box in the audience area, and the trick would be complete... the operative word here being "would."
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 lyney 14.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But as you saw, Cowell was in the box, not our audience member &mdash; she, on the other hand, mysteriously vanished.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' We really don't know how that happened.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' If not for that interlude, this would have been an astonishing trick. I probably never would have figured out how you pulled it off...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And yet, to think that someone was able to use this magic trick to commit a crime.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Could we have a look around? I think we can come up with some more leads.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 molly 01.ogg}} '''Molly:''' This is the scene of the crime, so Lyney and Lynette are not permitted to stay here. I'll escort them back up.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 lyney 15.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Yes, of course, no need to be so strict now. I won't disappear into thin air, you know.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 18 lynette 05.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Thanks, everyone. We're counting on you.

:'''Examine Control Board:''' (This should be the control device for the trolley. It seems to be able to operate automatically.)

;(Investigate the hook)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 19 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' What's this?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 19 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like a hook tied to the end of a rope. Huh, there's all kinds of odds and ends here.
:{{DIcon}} Lyney didn't mention this earlier.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 19 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Perhaps it was a prop for a different trick? But why would it have been left here?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 19 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whatever it is, let's make a note of it first.
:;("Dropped Hook Rope" added to the Case Record)

;(Investigate the Vase)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 21 marcillac 01.ogg}} '''Melus:''' The floor is wet. Please be careful not to slip.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 21 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Speaking of which, why would there be water here?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe it was for a trick?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 21 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, Paimon knows. It's one of those tricks where you pour water into a jug, and then flip the jug over, only for the water to disappear!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 21 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And here's a broken vase... Huh. Did the trolley knock it down while moving?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 21 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' That can't be. The trolley moves along tracks from start to finish. It couldn't have hit the vase at this distance.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 21 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, let's note this down too and think about it later.

;(Examine the Tracks)

;(Examine the Storage Boxes)

;(Examine the vent)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 25 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What is this place?
:{{DIcon}} Looks like a vent.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 25 silver 01.ogg}} '''Silver:''' It seems someone could fit through here.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 25 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hmm, could this have been the suspect's escape route?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 25 marcillac 01.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Alone, perhaps. But if they had to pull another person with them, this space would be too narrow.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 25 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But there are no other ways in or out of here.
:{{DIcon}} Other than those that go through the magic boxes.
:{{DIcon}} And Lyney and Lynette were in the two magic boxes.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 25 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, you're right! Let Paimon write that down...
:;("Tunnel Vent" added to the Case Record)

;(Examine the vent again)
:'''Examine the Tunnel Vent:''' (The perpetrator could have left through here, but bringing the young woman with them would have proved tricky...)

:{{A|vo fdaq003 27 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seems we're just about done investigating down here.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 27 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Yes, let's head back up.

;(Return to the surface level)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, we've ascertained the state of the crime scene.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Let's find a place to sort out our findings once Melus returns. It seems to me that there are several things that don't add up here.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 marcillac 01.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Apologies for the wait, Demoiselle.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' So what did the Gardes say? Did the criminal escape through the vent?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 marcillac 02.ogg}} '''Melus:''' They believe the odds of that are very low, since the vent leads to the opera house's basement.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 marcillac 03.ogg}} '''Melus:''' The Gardes have checked the area carefully. No one left through the basement during the performance or after the incident, and no one was found hiding there.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So the tunnel's become like a "secret chamber," then? Y'know, like the kind you usually see in novels?
:{{DIcon}} It would seem so.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hmm, the plot thickens... Halsey's disappearance and Cowell's death are both quite inexplicable.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' No wonder Furina was so confident in her accusation. All the current evidence points toward Lyney and Lynette.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 marcillac 04.ogg}} '''Melus:''' In other words, the "charges" are very likely to be upheld unless we make some considerable progress.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Charges and then trial... So, if the charges are upheld, they'll announce a sentence?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' That's right. This is how a trial goes in the opera house &mdash; during the proceedings, the [[Neuvillette|Chief Justice]] and the [[Oratrice]] will hear statements from both sides.
:{{DIcon}} The Oratrice will too?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' That's right. This is how [[Indemnitium]] is produced.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' The statements from both sides, the defenses from attorneys, witness testimonies, and even the audience's emotions will all be projected on the Oratrice.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' To put it simply, it's as if the Oratrice has its own will, and is a judge in its own right.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 marcillac 05.ogg}} '''Melus:''' This also precludes any kind of favoritism on the part of the Chief Justice... Not that this has ever happened anyway.
:{{DIcon}} Fascinating.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Once both sides have finished speaking, the Chief Justice will make his final decision. This, too, will be used by the Oratrice as a reference.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Then finally, the Oratrice will be consulted by officials. The result it returns is the will of "justice" itself.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? So that machine is the one that actually decides? Paimon thought Neuvillette called the shots!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 marcillac 06.ogg}} '''Melus:''' In practice, there is very little difference. Both have always come to the same judgment &mdash; which is why people have great faith in the Chief Justice.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 marcillac 07.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Ah, yes. The Gardes also asked me to convey that none of us will be allowed to leave this place before the trial.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Why!?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 marcillac 08.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Because we've chosen to act as the twins' proxies. That makes us persons related to the case.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' They're concerned that we might be colluding with outside parties, or that we might find outside help to disrupt the case...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And even if that were not so, it could prove problematic if we happened to spread key information about the case ahead of time.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 silver 01.ogg}} '''Silver:''' I'm ready to break out at any time.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, whoa! There's no need for that! Paimon thinks they have a point. That said... are they providing food?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 marcillac 09.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Of course, I just hope you don't mind the lack of options. I'm afraid that catering to all tastes is not in the cards, nor is any guarantee of balanced nutrition.
:{{DIcon}} Now's not the time to be picky.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 14.ogg}} '''Navia:''' In that case, let's just sort out our findings together here. Pity, I was hoping to take you to try some of Fontaine's famous desserts, too.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 15.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I mean, what better way to properly think through our findings than over some tea and sweets?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, breaking out suddenly doesn't seem like such a bad idea after all...
:{{DIcon}} Paimon.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just kidding, just kidding... Paimon will still do her best even if there are no snacks!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 16.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hmm? What do you mean "no snacks"? Of course we'll have snacks! If we cannot buy some, then we'll simply make some.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Here? But how?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 marcillac 10.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Understood, Demoiselle. Everyone, please come with me.
:;(A stove is set up)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, you're carrying a portable stove with you?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 marcillac 11.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Yes. I must be prepared to meet the Demoiselle's baking needs whenever the fancy strikes her.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 silver 02.ogg}} '''Silver:''' I have eggs, sugar, and almonds at the ready.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 17.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hahaha. Good work, you two. Then I'll get to it. Please sit tight for a moment, you'll get to taste my awesome snacks soon enough!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' These three are quite the interesting group...
:{{DIcon}} Must be a Spina di Rosula thing.
:{{Black Screen|Navia methodically handles the ingredients and pulls fresh macarons out of the oven in short order.}}
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, and Paimon thought it smelled good while it was still in the oven, it's even better now! Paimon can't stop drooling!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' From the way you had these two guys carrying all that stuff around, Paimon thought you'd have them do more during the baking process.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But you ended up doing the entire thing by yourself... beating the egg whites, grinding almonds, everything.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 silver 03.ogg}} '''Silver:''' I was applauding.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 marcillac 12.ogg}} '''Melus:''' And I was giving encouraging smiles.
:{{DIcon}} Uh, that's not quite what Paimon meant, but okay...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon was just thinking, aren't you worried about getting your fancy dress dirty beating egg whites and baking like this?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 18.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Haha! Well, I don't think it's carved in stone anywhere that fancy ladies can only read books, sip tea, ride horses, and play the piano. I just really enjoy making snacks.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 19.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Don't underestimate beating egg whites, by the way. It's a real arm workout! You also need to beat them to just the right consistency, or your macarons will crack.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 20.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Anyway, give these a try, fresh out of the oven! There's three for each of us.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Only three?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 21.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, eating too many sweet treats might send all that sugar to your head. You wouldn't be able to think clearly about the case on a sugar rush, would you?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 marcillac 13.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Tea is ready to be served as well. This is Demoiselle's favorite, strong black tea with a floral fragrance that clears the mind and lifts the spirit.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you.
:{{DIcon}} Why don't you take a break as well?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 marcillac 14.ogg}} '''Melus:''' No need for concern. I'm merely doing as I should.
:;(The group enjoy their snacks and tea)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 22.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Alright then, down to business. As Paimon mentioned previously, the tunnel seems to be something of a secret chamber...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 23.ogg}} '''Navia:''' However, we can assume that Lyney and Lynette were not alone within it. Some criminal also occupied its sealed confines.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 24.ogg}} '''Navia:''' The magician twins could have committed the crimes, of course, but they lack any logical motive.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Exactly! Why would they do such a thing right when everyone was watching?
:{{DIcon}} So apart from the twins...
:{{DIcon}} We're left with two other people: the missing girl and the deceased.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 25.ogg}} '''Navia:''' The flower vase and the thud we heard during the performance could indicate some altercation between Halsey and the criminal in the tunnel.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 26.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Resulting in the shattering of the vase, the discarding of her clothes, and her abduction...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 27.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Perhaps the criminal thought that since she was chosen from the crowd, she would be too easy to identify if she was still wearing the same clothes...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks that makes sense, but the real trouble is...
:{{DIcon}} There's no evidence that this "third person" even exists.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 28.ogg}} '''Navia:''' True. None of the clues we've found thus far support the existence of this third person.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 29.ogg}} '''Navia:''' But the only people left to consider are both technically victims, whether it's the missing girl, Halsey, or poor Cowell...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, could Halsey have secretly made modifications to the magic props in order to murder Cowell before making her escape?
:{{DIcon}} But she had no way of knowing how the magic trick worked.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 30.ogg}} '''Navia:''' That's right. And even if she had tampered with the setup, she would need to understand the entire trick to pull it off.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 31.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Nor does she have any motive. The Gardes said that she has never had any dealings with the magic troupe's members.

:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' From the sound of things, this is turning into an impossible case.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Your macarons are amazing though, Navia. They smell great, they're nice and crisp, and super sweet...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 32.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hehe, they are [["Pick What You Like!"|my specialty]], after all &mdash; and I see you've already had five of them.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What? Five? Oh, that can't be right... Paimon only counted three... honest!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 marcillac 15.ogg}} '''Melus:''' Please, don't worry about it. At my age, a few less sweets might actually be a good thing.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, no, no... Being greedy is one thing, but Paimon knows how to count!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 24.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Besides, Paimon knows that if she ate too many, then others wouldn't have enough.
:{{DIcon}} It's fine. If you ate them, you ate them.
:{{DIcon}} Oh, it's fine. Everyone knows how much you love eating.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 25.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, even you don't believe Paimon!? Oh!&nbsp;...How could you!?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 26.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If Paimon ate those two extra macarons, then may they turn into stone in her stomach!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 33.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Haha, alright, we get it. Well, I suppose one of us might have gotten too engrossed in our chat and eaten them by mistake! No big deal.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 34.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Melus, set the stove up again, if you would.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 27.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What are you doing?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 35.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Making sure everyone gets three macarons, of course!
:{{DIcon}} Oh, there's really no need to do that.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 28.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Exactly! We don't wanna trouble you...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 marcillac 16.ogg}} '''Melus:''' As you wish, Demoiselle.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 silver 04.ogg}} '''Silver:''' I have eggs, sugar, and almonds at the ready.

:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 37.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I don't know what we're looking for yet, but we've still got some time. As attorneys, I suggest the two of you think the case over again.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 38.ogg}} '''Navia:''' It would be awkward if you got all tongue-tied on stage during the trial.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 paimon 30.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright. Thanks for your help &mdash; and for the snacks!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 39.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Haha, it was nothing. A small task for the Spina di Rosula. Silver, Melus, it's time to go.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 28 navia 40.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I'll be back if I find anything new!

:{{A|vo fdaq003 29 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's probably gonna be a long and difficult case... Ugh, there's no point worrying about that now, we just need to prepare!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 29 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Here, take Paimon's notes. They should help you review the situation.

:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What do we do, {{Traveler}}? The whole situation is so confusing!
:{{DIcon}} I do have some thoughts...
:{{DIcon}} But let's take things step by step.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good plan. Impossible things don't just happen, we'll get to the truth one way or another!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Just relax. Even if everyone else suspects Lyney and Lynette, at least we will be supporting them from the stands.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Besides, I doubt Furina understands any more about what happened than we do.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thanks, Navia. Well, we'll be going then.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Best of luck to you.
:;(The Traveler and Paimon approach Lyney and Lynette)

:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' To be honest, you might be disappointed...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' No, no. We're already very grateful that you were willing to help.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Well now, don't you all look disappointed? Don't tell me that your investigation came up empty-handed?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' That was to be expected, of course. The guilty can never produce proof of their innocence.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But don't let that stop you, {{Traveler}}. I shall be terribly disappointed should you, my most anticipated foe, concede so easily.
:{{DIcon}} Just you wait.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Since both parties are present, I declare that the trial regarding the magic show incident is now in session.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Firstly, in order for the audience to understand the causes and results of the incident, could we please have Mr. Lyney explain the trick?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Yes, of course. I will explain, while Lynette demonstrates onstage. All the necessary items have been prepared.
:{{Black Screen|Lyney clearly reveals the details of the magic trick. Everyone in the audience is stunned.}}
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Thank you, Mr. Lyney. In that case, I take your statement to be that...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' You ran to, and remained hidden within, the magic box in the audience stands once the trick began, and thus could not have committed the crime. Is this correct?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Yes, that's correct, Your Honor.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' In that case, I call upon the prosecution &mdash; Lady Furina. Do you wish to refute his statement in any way?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Why, of course I do. Allow me to take the first shot and break this case wide open. Mr. Lyney is clearly lying.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' There is no way you could have been in the box the whole time if you were to abduct Halsey and murder Cowell. In fact, I'd say you were hardly in that tunnel at all!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That is simply your hypothesis based on the presumption that I'm guilty.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh, is that so? And if I may ask, what did you hear while you were inside your box?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' The roaring countdown of the crowd, of course. That's how I kept track of the time and built anticipation for the finale.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' And you didn't hear anything else at all? Nothing that might leave an impression of any kind?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' No, nothing.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I see, but when the count reached thirty seconds or so, there was a thud &mdash; one so loud that I believe practically everyone heard it.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Huh!?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, hang on, something's not right here...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (How could Lyney not know about that sound?)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 audiencec 01.ogg}} '''Doubtful Audience Member:''' Yeah, I'm sure he could've heard a noise that loud from inside the box.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 audienced 01.ogg}} '''Suspicious Audience Member:''' I was right by the box, and I definitely heard the thud.
:;(The scales of the Oratrice tip towards Furina)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look at those scales, could those mean...
:{{DIcon}} They probably represent the Oratrice's stance on the trial.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Well then, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to use the words of the magician himself: "You never know what can happen in the blink of an eye." Indeed, it seems his alibi can also collapse in the blink of an eye.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 furina 10.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Of course, I have armed myself to do far more than smash your alibi. Confidence cannot go unfounded, and my foundations are rock-solid.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 furina 11.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Tell me. Aren't you and Lynette actually from the [[House of the Hearth]]?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The House of the Hearth!?
:{{DIcon}} They're... [[Fatui]]?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 audiencec 02.ogg}} '''Certain Audience Member:''' No wonder they did something like this.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 audiencee 01.ogg}} '''Calm Audience Member:''' So the serial disappearances were the Fatui's doing. Huh, now it all makes sense.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 audienced 02.ogg}} '''Rational Audience Member:''' I've got a feeling that what happened on stage probably wasn't just an accident.
:;(One of the four lights on the Oratrice lights up)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That's irrelevant. Our identities have nothing to do with what happened.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 furina 12.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Indeed. Then perhaps you could tell us everything that happened during that one minute.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 furina 13.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Your first priority is to prove yourself innocent, after all. I'm sure there is little that needs to be kept secret now... Unless your "script" already has holes in it.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 furina 14.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (The outlander is speechless. My, oh my, don't they look flabbergasted! Haha, now comes the infighting and discord, I suppose. This was almost too easy!)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 furina 15.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (Aw, good thing I made all those preparations. Seems the all-nighter I pulled last night is really paying off!)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Lyney, why didn't you tell us this before!?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Lyney and Lynette are Fatui...)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 neuvillette 06.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Order, order. Mr. Lyney, allow me to re-establish the facts. Lady Furina has raised two points...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 neuvillette 07.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' First, when the thud was heard in the opera house, you were neither in the box nor the tunnel. Second, you and Ms. Lynette are both members of the House of the Hearth.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Are these claims true?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' ...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (There's no doubt about a magician's ability to con others. Given how Lyney has concealed his identity, this could all have been set up beforehand.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Plus Childe is here in Fontaine along with other House operatives, there must be some scheme at work here.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (I've been a victim of such schemes before, and now...)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 neuvillette 09.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Please answer my question, Mr. Lyney.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I'm sorry...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 lyney 12.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Yes, they're true, Your Honor.
:;(The scales of the Oratrice tip further towards Furina)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 audiencea 01.ogg}} '''Excited Audience Member:''' I knew it!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 audiencec 03.ogg}} '''Optimistic Audience Member:''' Well, that's it. We might as well move on to the sentencing already.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What should we do now, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} Permission to speak, Your Honor.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 neuvillette 10.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Granted.
:{{DIcon}} My client has withheld some key information.
:{{DIcon}} My defense cannot proceed.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 neuvillette 11.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' In that case, what is your request?
:{{DIcon}} I request a brief adjournment. There are things that must be discussed.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 audienced 03.ogg}} '''Impatient Audience Member:''' Is that really necessary? They're already as good as guilty.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 audiencef 01.ogg}} '''Disappointed Audience Member:''' The defendant deceived their own attorneys. What is there left to discuss?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 neuvillette 12.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Order, order, I say.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 neuvillette 13.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Your request is reasonable and we shall adjourn. This trial will reconvene in one hour.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 furina 16.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Heh, so you would stick to Mr. Lyney's defense even after knowing what you do now? You certainly have more professionalism than I thought.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 30 furina 17.ogg}} '''Furina:''' In that case, my dear audience, let's allow the joy of victory to steep for a little while longer, haha.
:{{Black Screen|While court is adjourned, you meet with Lyney and Lynette backstage in the opera house.}}
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well, this is awkward. I didn't think the Hydro Archon would dig all that up.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I'm sorry, {{Traveler}} and Paimon.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Yeah, sorry.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh... Paimon doesn't know where to start. We trusted you two!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We based our entire reasoning on the assumption that you weren't bad guys!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Not to set the wrong tone or anything, but Paimon's really mad!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I'm very sorry. I know you're angry, and reasonably so, but please let me explain.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I know you've clashed with the Fatui several times before. I wouldn't be surprised if just hearing the word is enough to make you upset.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But our organization is very, very large, and the [[Harbingers]] have very different personalities and goals.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lynette 02.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Right now, we want to save people... as many as we can.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That's right. I'm sure we're on the same page when it comes to this nation and the disaster that its people might face.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I knew if it weren't for our respective identities, we could become good friends...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That's why I didn't wish to flat-out lie to you, but chose to hide some details instead.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' The truth is very important, but being completely transparent about everything would see us spending more effort than we need to.
:{{DIcon}} But how can we know this isn't all just another lie?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Right. So, you be the judge. Heck, if I were you, I fear that I'd even struggle to trust me at this point.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You met a Fatuus who works as a magician, a trickster by trade... all by coincidence, too.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 12.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But still, I'm asking you to trust me. I am no criminal... at least, not in this case.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lynette 03.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Sorry, please forgive us.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, you both say that, but...
:{{DIcon}} Explain the other issue first.
:{{DIcon}} Where did you actually go while the trick was being performed?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right, let's hear your answer first. And no lies, now!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 13.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Of course. I'll answer any question you ask.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 14.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' We've been trying to find out how the Oratrice operates. We want to know why it has a consciousness? Why can it deliver sentences accurately?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 15.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' During our investigations, we learned that the machine's core is beneath it.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 16.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' From that moment on, Lynette and I have been designing this box-swap trick, with the objective of getting close to the core.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is that why you needed a whole minute?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 17.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That's right. In truth, the audience would take about seventy-five seconds to count down from sixty, while I would only need fifteen to get to the opposite box.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 18.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' So after jumping into the tunnel, I accessed the opera house basement via the vent and went to investigate the room in which the core is stored.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lynette 04.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' That air vent was created during the construction of the tunnel specifically to execute this step.
:{{DIcon}} And what did you find?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 19.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well, nothing. As soon as I reached that room and was about to investigate, I heard someone's voice.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 20.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Which should have been impossible, of course &mdash; I was quite certain that I was the only one in the room.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 21.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That voice seemed to recognize me and tried to speak to me. I chose to err on the side of caution and retreated the way I came.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 22.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' On the way back, I saw the broken vase and the clothes on the ground, but the countdown was almost finished, so there wasn't time to give it any thought.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 23.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' After that, the homicide occurred just as you saw.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, that explains why you didn't hear the thud...
:{{DIcon}} But why do you want to understand how the Oratrice operates?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 24.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Because of that prophecy I told you about, of course. We must know all we can about this nation's secrets in order to deal with that prophesied crisis.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lynette 05.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' That's the only way we can save everyone.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 25.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' So, there you have it, the whole truth. I swear, I didn't hide anything from you this time.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 26.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' It was never my wish to proceed under this cloud of mistrust either...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 27.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But like I said earlier, you can be the judge. If you want to leave because you don't trust the Fatui, there's nothing I can do to stop you.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, {{Traveler}}, you decide. Paimon'll follow your lead however you choose.
:{{DIcon}} I believe in the facts.
::{{DIcon}} I will defend you from these charges.
::{{DIcon}} I believe that judgment will be dispensed as it should.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lyney 28.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Okay. Thank you.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 lynette 06.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Thanks for giving us a chance.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The current problem is that the scales are tipped pretty badly against you two...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If we wanna refute the Hydro Archon's accusations, we're gonna need a seriously watertight defense.
:{{DIcon}} Actually, we already have the key evidence we need.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Huh?
:{{DIcon}} The adjournment's almost over. Let's go back.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 31 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm. Oh, Paimon thinks she gets what you mean...

:{{A|vo fdaq003 32 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' That took long enough. Now then, if everyone would lend me their attention.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 32 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' At this stage, let's revisit that scene from Lyney's perspective.

:{{A|vo fdaq003 33 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' As the countdown began, he entered the tunnel.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 33 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' When the flatbed trolley passed, he opened the box and got into an altercation with Halsey, which caused the loud thud.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 33 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' He did not realize that this sound could be heard by everyone in the opera house, which is why he claimed earlier that he could not hear the sound.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 33 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Finally, he used the vase to knock her out, before making her change clothes to prevent others from recognizing her.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 33 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' At this time, Cowell arrived in the tunnel, having heard that strange noise, and caught Lyney red-handed.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 33 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' So Lyney proceeded to knock him out too before stuffing him into that box.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 33 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Afterward, Lyney passed the unconscious Halsey to his accomplice through the magic box in the audience stands, before operating the devices such that Cowell's death would be ruled an accident.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 33 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' And there you have it, that's the truth behind what happened...

;(Logic Chain [[#Tutorials|Tutorial]])

;How did the culprit trigger the onstage accident?
:'''Gardes Investigation Report:''' The Gardes Investigation Report indicates that the fireworks released near the end of the show ignited and burned through the rope suspending the water tank above the stage. This caused the water tank to fall and kill Cowell in the box below.
:'''Gardes Investigation Report:''' If Lyney is no longer under suspicion, only the other members of the troupe would have been able to tamper with the props.
;What was the original plan for the performance?
:'''The Magic Trick:''' Lyney gave a detailed account of how the trick was supposed to work: By using a box inside a box, the idea was for the box containing the audience member to be transported across via a tunnel underneath, and Lyney himself would also use this tunnel to get to the other side.
:'''The Magic Trick:''' Having changed her outfit, Lynette and her assistant would take charge of on-stage interactions.
;What evidence is there that the selected audience member was involved in the incident?
:'''The Young Lady's Clothes:''' The clothes belonging to Halsey &mdash; the lady who went missing &mdash; were found in the tunnel. The reason for this remains unknown.

:{{A|vo fdaq003 42 esmond 04.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' The notes' contents also indicate that Cowell belonged to an organization that sells illegal drugs, and that he had an accomplice.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 42 esmond 05.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' The notebook has many entries concerning safe usage of these fluids, in which the keyword "dissolve" appears many times.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 42 esmond 06.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' One of these tubes was labeled "Opera Epiclese" along with yesterday's date. It is empty.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 42 esmond 07.ogg}} '''Esmond:''' The notes also state that these dissolution properties work exclusively on people from Fontaine. It's likely that Halsey was chosen as some sort of test subject.

:{{A|vo fdaq003 44 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But upon his return, in cruel avarice, Lyney desired sole credit and prepared to do away with his partner-in-crime.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 44 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ultimately, he knocked Cowell out, and the tool meant to cover the crime up also became a murder weapon.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 44 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Now, as much as I regret having come to such a viciously straightforward conclusion, it does seem that the famed Fatui is quite the cold-blooded and ruthless organization...

:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no... Paimon can't think of anything either. It doesn't look like there's any way around this!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, seems using the water as new evidence was too good a move... why did this have to happen now?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I think we've all seen enough now, and we have ample witnesses to my flawless reasoning.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I believe this is indeed the "finale."
:;(The third of four lights on the Oratrice light up)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Now then, my good, noble Chief Justice, should we not, in your view move&mdash;

:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Miss, I must ask you not to shout and to respect the ongoing legal proceedings.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Oh, come on, don't be hasty. I have a good reason for interrupting, you know. Now, would anyone here like to take a little break from all this debate, and see a little magic?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I'll show you an amazing trick, one that can bring a young woman who has "disappeared" back in the flesh, right before our very eyes! Please do the honors Mr. Lyney, if you would be so kind.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 audienceg 01.ogg}} '''Confused Audience Member:''' Wh&mdash;What in the world is she saying?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' No offense, Miss, but miracles like that are beyond my scope as a magician.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Come on now, don't be silly. Magic is all about misdirection, isn't it? It often conceals the truth while presenting a fascinating illusion.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' But once everyone believes the illusion, can't magic reveal the truth to them once again?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' And wouldn't such a trick be the most marvelous finale to today's performance?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Come on, Lyney and Lynette. Give it another go. Don't worry &mdash; Spina di Rosula has made the necessary arrangements on your behalf.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' But as the magic-makers and stars of the show, I think I should leave the final performance to you.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I understand.
:'''Lyney:''' *click*
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' And voila!
:;(The spotlight shines into the magic box on stage and it opens)

:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 lilian 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Um... Uh, sorry for the interruption.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 audienceb 01.ogg}} '''Surprised Audience Member:''' Wait, isn't that Halsey? So the whole thing about people dissolving wasn't true after all?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 lilian 02.ogg}} '''???:''' To be clear, I'm only here because this person told me that if I testified, the merit of doing so would lessen my sentence...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 lilian 03.ogg}} '''???:''' I was hiding outside this room listening to the proceedings because I was afraid that I would be the one put on trial...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 lilian 04.ogg}} '''???:''' I was just feeling happy that no one had noticed me... and then before I knew it, she caught me.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hehe, that'll teach you to underestimate us three.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 lilian 05.ogg}} '''???:''' Where should I begin... *sigh* I'm sorry. I'm the one who killed Cowell, I admit it.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Wh&mdash;What? Why?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 lilian 06.ogg}} '''Liliane:''' Firstly, my name isn't Halsey. It's [[Liliane]], and I'm originally from [[Mondstadt]].
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 lilian 07.ogg}} '''Liliane:''' I heard that Lyney's show was going to be a real thriller, but I missed the chance to buy a ticket, so I stole one.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 lilian 08.ogg}} '''Liliane:''' That's how I make a living, I steal stuff here and there... and I'd never been caught before.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 lilian 09.ogg}} '''Liliane:''' But I was noticed at the harbor a few days ago, and I barely got away. Lyney was the one who caught me in the act.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, no wonder you look familiar. So you were the thief!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lyney even mentioned that you were pretty skilled.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 lilian 10.ogg}} '''Liliane:''' Well, and I thought that would've been the end of it, but then the number selector chose me.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 lilian 11.ogg}} '''Liliane:''' He even mentioned the Fortress of Meropide. That's a prison, isn't it? So you can imagine how shocked I was &mdash; I thought he was onto me for sure.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 lilian 12.ogg}} '''Liliane:''' So I played along with the show while looking for an opening to flee, but then I got water poured on me for no reason, and then someone jumped into the tunnel to nab me...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 lilian 13.ogg}} '''Liliane:''' I wasn't going to take that lying down, so I knocked him out and stuffed him into the box.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 lilian 14.ogg}} '''Liliane:''' There was nowhere to run from there, though, so I had to change my clothes and hide in a box containing performance costumes.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 lilian 15.ogg}} '''Liliane:''' I slipped out after the first Garde arrived at the scene and continued hiding inside the opera house.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Can a person even hide in there?
:{{DIcon}} If they're a practiced hand at concealment, probably...
:{{DIcon}} A professional thief could make it work.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 lilian 16.ogg}} '''Liliane:''' But I swear I didn't know that the water tank would fall down. Really, I swear it!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 lilian 17.ogg}} '''Liliane:''' Had I known that, I wouldn't have put him in the magic box! I may be a thief, but I'm no killer!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, that makes everything pretty clear now, doesn't it?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah. Now it's time to refute the Hydro Archon's previous reasoning.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 45 hero 01.ogg}} {{A|vo fdaq003 45 heroine 01.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' (This time, we need to tell the entire story from Liliane's perspective.)

:{{A|vo fdaq003 46 hero 01.ogg}} {{A|vo fdaq003 46 heroine 01.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' (The strange sound wasn't from a fight, it was Liliane's attempt to break out when she was frightened.)

:{{A|vo fdaq003 46 hero 02.ogg}} {{A|vo fdaq003 46 heroine 02.ogg}} '''{{Traveler}}:''' (The flower vase was not broken to cover anything up, but was smashed during the struggle between Liliane and Cowell...)

:{{A|vo fdaq003 49 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aaand it's Ace Detective Paimon Time!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 49 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Having been selected out of the blue, Liliane panicked.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 49 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Her panic only intensified after she entered the tunnel and had water poured on her head. So she kicked the door open, producing the thud we all heard.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 49 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hearing the commotion, Cowell leaped into the tunnel, only to discover that Liliane had not dissolved.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 49 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He did not know that Liliane was not from Fontaine, but was a thief who'd made her way in by stealing a ticket.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 49 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mistakenly believing that the Water from the Primordial Sea needed time to take effect, he tried to force Liliane back into the box.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 49 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The two broke the flower vase during the struggle, but Liliane came out on top, knocking Cowell out and putting him in the box.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 49 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' With no way of escaping, she changed her clothes and hid in the costume trunk until the performance ended.

;(After the Refutation)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 50 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She knew that she would have to go through Garde inspection if she tried to leave afterward, so she has been trapped in the opera house these last two days.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 50 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' She had already become desperately hungry by the time we were chatting over macarons, so she swiped two of them right under our noses. Talk about a sneaky thief!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 50 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' At this point, all the events that happened in the tunnel have now come to light!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 50 audienceg 01.ogg}} '''Canny Audience Member:''' Ah, so that's the whole story...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 50 audiencea 01.ogg}} '''Cheering Audience Member:''' Bravo. Bravo!
:;(The scales of the Oratrice tip towards the Traveler)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 50 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Now then, Lady Furina, do you wish to speak against the defense's statements?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 50 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I... Um...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 50 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Please answer the question, Lady Furina. Also, if I may add, the trial has not yet ended. As such, I request that the prosecution not leave the room before the proceedings have concluded.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 50 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ugh! What, are you reading my mind now!?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 50 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' *sigh* No, I have no further arguments. I admit defeat. But really, could you at least have left me with some dignity?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 50 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, look at that. She's like a deflated balloon now.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 50 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' If there are no objections, then as the Chief Justice of Fontaine, I shall once again repeat the full sequence of events.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 51 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' The actual perpetrator of the serial disappearances, Cowell, selected his next victim from the audience reservation list.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 51 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' With some modifications to the selector, he could ensure that the pre-selected young woman would be chosen.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 51 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' To cover up any evidence while committing the deed, Cowell thought of allowing the water tank to fall, which would conceal the water left behind after the young woman was dissolved.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 51 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' He also tampered with the ropes suspending the water tank, using the fireworks at the end of the performance to cause the tank to drop and hide the water marks.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 51 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' He poured the Water from the Primordial Sea, into a balloon during the preparation of the magic box and stuck it to the box's lid.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 51 neuvillette 06.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Finally, he passed the prepared hook on a rope through the gap in the magic box's door when bringing the young woman to said box.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 51 neuvillette 07.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' When the magic trick officially began, the box containing the woman was lowered into the tunnel, tightening the hook rope and bursting the balloon containing the Water.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 51 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' If all had gone to plan, the young woman would be dissolved at this time. However, Liliane was not from Fontaine, and thus fled the box with a loud noise.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 51 neuvillette 09.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Realizing that there was trouble, Cowell entered the tunnel and met Liliane. Thinking that the Waters had not yet taken effect, he decided to proceed.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 51 neuvillette 10.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' However, his opponent was more capable than he thought, and he was overcome, knocked unconscious, and placed into the magic box, and thus became his own final victim.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 51 neuvillette 11.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Liliane, according to her own statements, then changed clothes and hid until the performance ended before hiding in other parts of the opera house.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 51 neuvillette 12.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' As for Lyney, he was in the underground structures within the opera house, and was thus ignorant of these happenings.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 neuvillette 01.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' From this reconstruction of events, we can conclude that Lyney, the accused, is in fact innocent.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hooray, Lyney and Lynette! Amazing!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 neuvillette 02.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' While there is much in Lyney and Liliane's conduct that should still be investigated separately...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 neuvillette 03.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' This case, at least, can be handed over to the Oratrice to make the final decision.
:;(The final light on the Oratrice glows and the scales tip towards the Traveler)
:;(A ticket is inserted into the Oratrice and it sends off a burst of light)
:;(A ticket is ejected from the Oratrice)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 neuvillette 04.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' As such, Lyney and Lynette are officially declared "Not Guilty"!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hahaha! Victory for Ace Detective Paimon!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Great work, partners!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 lynette 01.ogg}} '''Lynette:''' Thank you all, thank you so much!
:{{DIcon}} Let's not celebrate just yet...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 neuvillette 05.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Next, I think we deserve an explanation, Garde Vaughn.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 neuvillette 06.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' How did you find the Water from the Primordial Sea in Lyney's baggage?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Right! Your discovery caused me to make a serious mistake, you know!&nbsp;...Or was that not a discovery, but false evidence that you dared to bring before this court?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 neuvillette 07.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I suspect that the accomplice mentioned in Cowell's notes was not Lyney, but you, yes?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 vaughn 01.ogg}} '''Vaughn:''' I... Uh...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 neuvillette 08.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' I'm sure you know what you must do to lessen your sentence.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Speak quickly, unless you want to earn yourself a one-way ticket to [[coupon-town]].
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 vaughn 02.ogg}} '''Vaughn:''' I&mdash;I was just following orders!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 vaughn 03.ogg}} '''Vaughn:''' We were supposed to place blame for the serial disappearances onto Lyney and thus cause suspicion to fall on the Fatui. The higher-ups said that this was the best opportunity to do so.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 neuvillette 09.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' And now that your plan has fallen through, and the secrets of the Water have been revealed, you have become a liability to said higher-ups, yes?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 neuvillette 10.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' Therefore, you would be wise to tell everything you know and seek the protection of the Gardes.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 vaughn 04.ogg}} '''Vaughn:''' Y&mdash;Yes! I'll tell you everything I know!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 vaughn 05.ogg}} '''Vaughn:''' Our boss discovered that the Water can cause people to dissolve.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 vaughn 06.ogg}} '''Vaughn:''' It can also be made into a potion which, when extremely diluted, can cause people to experience unforgettable exhilaration.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 vaughn 07.ogg}} '''Vaughn:''' We've been in this business for a while now and have made decent Mora off it. The disappearances were also the boss' idea. I mean, this is the boss we're talking about, the&mdash;

:{{A|vo fdaq003 52 neuvillette 11.ogg}} '''Neuvillette:''' An outrageous act.

:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... we're just going back now?
:{{DIcon}} The problem seems to have been solved for now.
:{{DIcon}} We're not needed here anymore.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's true, but...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, please wait...

:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lyney...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I know you may not want to speak to me right now. Maybe you don't even want to look at me...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But still, let me thank you again for defending me to the end, even after you learned that I am a member of the Fatui.
:{{DIcon}} I just didn't wish to see anyone be falsely accused.
:{{DIcon}} I just wanted to be sure that we're square.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I guess. But regardless, I'd like the opportunity to set things straight...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I didn't approach you with any ulterior motives or ill-intent. I've spoken to you as myself, just plain "Lyney," this entire time.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' As for why I'm a Fatuus, it's because the goals of the House of the Hearth align with those of an orphan like me. That's all.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That was how "{{Rubi|Father|Otets}}," who you might know as [[The Knave]], approached recruiting us back then, too...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Knave? The one who controls the House of the Hearth? She's your "father"?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That's right. And since we're here, I was wondering... Would you mind hearing a story? It's about my past.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Back when our parents first died, Lynette and I were left wandering the streets.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' To survive, I took to surreptitiously observing an older street performer who did magic. It took me several days to figure out how he pulled off his amazing tricks.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 11.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I took my sister through several streets until we found a crowded corner, and we began to perform magic tricks there.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 12.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' To my surprise, we proved to be pretty popular, and we could at least stop worrying about where our next meal would come from for a time. But, I didn't want my sister to remain a street rat together with me forever.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 13.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Before long, an aristocrat came to me, and claimed that he wished to take us in after watching my performances.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you went from orphans to nobility, just like that?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 14.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That was how we felt at first, too... As if fate was on our side, and we could say goodbye to those painful days.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 15.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But I gradually discovered that while we were called "foster children," he was really after my talent for magic tricks...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 16.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' He would constantly take me to all sorts of banquets to garner attention, which he would then use to expand his social circles.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That doesn't seem too bad either... Better than roaming the streets, at any rate...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 17.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hehe. It took a while for me to realize just how dark his heart really was.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 18.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' After one particular performance at a banquet, I discovered that Lynette was not on the same return vehicle as me.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 19.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I waited a long time after we returned home, but she did not come back. I went to that noble's bedroom and asked him about her whereabouts...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 20.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' The answer he gave me was: "She caught the eye of a most eminent person at the banquet, so I sent her over as a gift. I mean, you'll be able to perform your magic regardless of who your assistant is, yes?"
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no... So he was gonna...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, but wouldn't Fontaine's laws deal with such people?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 21.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' As far as outsiders are concerned, this is a relationship akin to "adoption" or "foster care," and they have their ways of escaping the eye of the law.
:{{DIcon}} Villains.
:{{DIcon}} So what happened after that?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 22.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I managed to ferret out the location of the mansion of that so-called "eminent person," and hurried through the night... But by the time I leaped over the walls, avoided the guards, and made my way in...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 23.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' All I saw was the moonlit ground covered in blood... and The Knave, standing there in the darkness.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So she'd already taken care of that guy...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 24.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That's right. She had rescued my sister before she could come to any harm, and had even discovered several girls hidden in a basement &mdash; all of them orphans.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 25.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' "Father"... I mean, The Knave, might have seen something in me, and so, she made me an offer...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 26.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' "The House of the Hearth welcomes you, for your interests align with ours. Here, none will ever betray you. Indeed, betrayal shall never be permitted here."
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 27.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I was hesitant to trust her. I mean, I had just been betrayed by nobles.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 28.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' But she was also quick to destroy the noble who had taken us in at first, giving us back our freedom.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's how the two of you joined the House of the Hearth.
:{{DIcon}} That's all in the past, though.
:{{DIcon}} The Knave is after the [[Gnosis]], isn't she?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 29.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' She... has her own plans.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 30.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' She has gained permission from the [[Tsaritsa]] to first use the Gnosis' power once she obtains it. She plans to use it to find a way to break the prophecy and save Fontaine.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So she believes in that prophecy too?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 31.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' That's right. The whole House of the Hearth is currently working to combat that crisis.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 32.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Today's case has also proven that people from Fontaine can indeed dissolve into some sort of water, thus further supporting the prophecy.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 33.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Everyone at Hotel Bouffes d'ete, including The Knave, has their roots in Fontaine. And we will always defend our homeland.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 34.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' To us orphans, the only connection we have left to this world, apart from our "family," is our homeland.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So from small deeds like distributing Magic Pockets to huge schemes like stealing a Gnosis, everything is aimed at dealing with that prophecy...
:{{DIcon}} I'm sorry...
:{{DIcon}} But I still can't completely trust you.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 35.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' It's alright, I understand. The only thing I can do is relate all this to you.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 36.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I just hope you can understand that even as a member of the House, I have never stopped making my own decisions, and that I believe what I'm doing is right.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 lyney 37.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' If you should need anything at all in the future, feel free to find me. I will do my best to help you, as plain "Lyney."
:{{DIcon}} I understand.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 53 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... bye, Lyney.

;(Leave the opera house)
:{{A|vo fdaq003 54 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hey there! What was with the disappearing act you pulled right as the trial ended?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 54 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Were you looking for us, Navia?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 54 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, this whole thing isn't exactly over, is it? I do feel that we're getting closer to solving the serial disappearances case, though. Don't you think so too?
:{{DIcon}} Well, I...
:{{DIcon}} I'm sorry, Navia.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 54 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hmm? What's wrong, my dear partner?
:{{DIcon}} I was really only trying to defend Lyney.
:{{DIcon}} I wasn't necessarily looking into serial disappearances case.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 54 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Besides, are you sure we're the ones who can crack a case that's been cold for decades now?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 54 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And given that there's new evidence from the trial, there should be a trail of breadcrumbs for the Hydro Archon's people to follow now, right?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 54 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Ah...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 54 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I see... Well. I won't lie &mdash; I'm a little shocked to hear that from you, but I suppose you are just travelers who have only arrived in Fontaine, after all...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 54 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Sorry, I might have been too presumptuous.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 54 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't say that, Navia...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 54 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' *sigh* And we were having so much fun investigating with you, too...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 54 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' It was like having new waters flowing into a stagnant mire, causing new hope to spring forth, and the reflection in the murk to become clearer.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 54 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Haha... Sorry about that, I'm a bit prone to nostalgia. Don't mind me...
:{{A|vo fdaq003 54 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Wait, shall we have a farewell meal? You know, to commemorate our time as partners?
:{{A|vo fdaq003 54 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Do we really need to get that formal?&nbsp;...Well, guess you really did treat us as partners, huh.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 54 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, I just like to have a proper ending to every important memory, that way there are no regrets later.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 54 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Anyway, it would just be a meal, so it shouldn't take up too much of your time.
:{{DIcon}} Well, if you say so...
:{{DIcon}} Let's go have that meal, then.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 54 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You don't have to twist Paimon's arm! If Boss Navia's treating, count Paimon in!
:{{A|vo fdaq003 54 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Wonderful! In that case, why don't we return to the Court of Fontaine and head to the [[Hotel Debord]]? I believe we'll make it just in time for dinner.
:{{A|vo fdaq003 54 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright then, let's have our farewell meal!
