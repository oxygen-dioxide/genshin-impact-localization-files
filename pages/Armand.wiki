==Profile==
Armand grew up in the same village as [[Arbon]] and [[Alberre]], and aspired to become a comedy actor. However, after sustaining injuries after falling out of his seat during a performance of the comedy "Judgment," Armand was left with a terrible stutter. Only recently has Armand's stutter improved enough for him to be able to express his thoughts in front of large groups of people.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Arbon}}</ref>
