{{Description|A Mitachurl that has mutated due to an accumulation of a large amount of elements in its body. They are bigger, stronger, and absolutely ferocious.<br />Hilichurls worship no gods and follow no order or discipline. The strongest and the most ferocious one among them is seen as fit to lead the tribe.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}
{{Description|These powerful Hilichurls are called "Lawa" by the rest of the tribe, a respectful form of address best translated to mean "king" or "chief". However, Lawa don't actually rule over or lead the tribe at all. Rather, these large loners prefer solitude, avoiding the looks of reverence from the smaller Hilichurls.<br /><br />Adventurers very rarely encounter these gigantic creatures. Still, even the most seasoned adventurers will think twice before going on expeditions into areas where these dangerous Lawas may be roaming.|[[Hilichurl Cultural Customs|Hilichurl Cultural Customs - Vol. 3]]}}
'''Lawachurls''', also called a "'''Hilichurl Chieftain'''" are mutated [[Mitachurls]] that stand atop the [[Hilichurl]] hierarchy.

There are currently three types of Lawachurls: [[Stonehide Lawachurl]], [[Frostarm Lawachurl]], and [[Thunderhelm Lawachurl]].

==Strategy==
Lawachurls are always encountered in an "unarmored" form. Upon engaging the player in combat, they will roar and generate elemental armor. While the armor is active, the Lawachurl's attacks deal elemental damage of its type and are further enhanced. Like [[Fatui Skirmishers]], this armor does not fully protect them from incoming damage. The armor can be removed with any attack, but some elemental reactions are far stronger than others.

When the armor is fully removed, the Lawachurl shakes the remnants off, taking slightly more damage and their attacks become significantly weaker. The player has about two minutes to defeat the Lawachurl or it will roar and reapply the armor on itself again.
