|[[File:Desert Fox Icon.png|80px]]
|"Ashe"<br><small>[[Desert Fox]]</small>
|It likes the sound of its own footsteps and will deliberately run across the floor to hear them. The lab has received many complaints from downstairs because of it.

|Caution is a positive trait, sure, but couldn't you at least remember the hand that feeds you, Arca?

|"Samir"<br><small>[[Desert Fox]]</small>
|A treacherous, cunning thing that's always eyeing up the small birds in the lab. I'll need to keep an eye on this one.

|"Orby"<br><small>[[Crimson Finch]]</small>
|Close to humans, and often rides on everyone's shoulders. It's been trained, so it won't get carried off by just anyone... I think?
|-
|[[File:Crimson Fox Icon.png|80px]]
|"Scrubba"<br><small>[[Crimson Fox]]</small>
|A neat freak. It will even knock over water basins to take a bath. If I had to guess, it should be near a lake somewhere.
|-
|[[File:Azure Crane Icon.png|80px]]
|"Long Beak"<br><small>[[Azure Crane]]</small>
|A rather prideful creature. But I'd say that it prefers literally looking down on people more than it really likes high spots.

|[[File:Azure Crane Icon.png|80px]]
|"Bottle Pecker"<br><small>[[Azure Crane]]</small>
|The sight of it spreading its wings in flight is beautiful, but it always ends up in hard-to-find places. Is this what they call being an introvert?
|-
|[[File:Crimson Finch Icon.png|80px]]
|"Chirpy"<br><small>[[Crimson Finch]]</small>
|It's so small and cute! Hehe, it's a little hard to spot when it huddles into a ball, but what matters is that it's cute!
|-
|[[File:Crimson Fox Icon.png|80px]]
|"Nightcall"<br><small>[[Crimson Fox]]</small>
|It enjoys playing with a ball while shrieking happily in the dead of night. It's lively, but it's also kinda noisy...

|"Agatha"<br><small>[[Squirrel]]</small>
|Likes fruit, and often snatches fruit from the other animals. To be honest, it might be better to just let it eat its fill before coming back.
|-
|[[File:Scarletbeak Duck Icon.png|80px]]
|"Cole"<br><small>[[Scarletbeak Duck]]</small>
|Very clingy and likes to swim. It's the straightforward type, so best to be careful should it hop up onto your knees...
|-
|[[File:Squirrel Icon.png|80px]]
|"Chesterton"<br><small>[[Squirrel]]</small>
|It looks like it's staring blankly a lot of the time but it's actually lost in thought. I sure hope it's not thinking of any dangerous ones.
