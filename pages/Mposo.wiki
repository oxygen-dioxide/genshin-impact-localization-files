;(Talk to Mposo after completing ''[[A Brief History of Rocks]]'')
:'''Mposo:''' *sigh* After all these years of research... *cough* Maybe I really have been "Idle Old Man Mposo"...
:'''Mposo:''' How was it? Did your trip to the volcano go smoothly?
:{{DIcon}} Why are you researching these ruins?
::'''Mposo:''' Because I want to know "why." I want to know why some [[saurian]]s are born different, and I want to know where their fate takes them...
::'''Mposo:''' *cough* ...Perhaps nothing separates them from other saurians apart from the marked horns. Who knows?
::'''Mposo:''' I don't, but I want to know the answers to all these questions.
:{{DIcon}} Are there many saurians with marks on their horns...?
::'''Mposo:''' No, there's perhaps one every dozen years, or even several dozen years, but no one's keeping count...
::'''Mposo:''' Either they get "concealed" by their tribes, or they make their way to the volcano. The few that survive are only mentioned in legends...
::'''Mposo:''' But their situation is *cough* ... less than good. Many of them grow violent and are killed by saurian-hunters...
::'''Mposo:''' However *cough* ... it seems that in times when the taint of the [[Abyss]] grows stronger, the [[Flamelord's Blessing]] appears on the horns of ever more saurians...
:{{DIcon}} What can you tell me about the [[Great Volcano of Tollan]]?
::'''Mposo:''' It's referred to as the Sacred Mountain. According to the stories *cough* ... in the distant past, the [[dragon]]s hollowed out the entire volcano and built a city within, dedicated to the [[Phlogiston|primal flame]]...
::'''Mposo:''' But when we got inside, everything was pitch-black, and we soon encountered a huge obstacle. It wasn't long before *cough* ... we had to abandon the expedition...
:{{DIcon}} Everything's going alright.
::'''Mposo:''' *cough* ...Is that so...
