{{Quest Description|You and Paimon arrive at the dormitories in the Fortress of Meropide...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the dormitories in the Forest of Meropide)
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We once thought the Fortress of Meropide would be super scary, but looking back on it, it really wasn't that bad at all!
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You've got a set schedule, guaranteed food and board, and you can even buy all kinds of stuff with Credit Coupons. It's really no surprise that many people don't even want to leave.
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, you're right.
:{{DIcon}} They probably have that guy to thank for that.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you mean Wriothesley? He's definitely a pretty impressive leader.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' While he does look kind of intimidating, he's actually pretty easy to talk to once you've had a conversation or two with him.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon wonders how he's like with the people here... Do they also get the same guy we do, or is he a lot harsher with the bad guys?
:{{DIcon}} He probably has a good number of tricks for every situation.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah... He must be doing something right to maintain order here, while not making everything feel super oppressive.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 faissolle 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Excuse me, did I hear someone there? Could you please do me a favor?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Uh... Paimon could've sworn she just heard something...
:{{DIcon}} Me too...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 faissolle 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Excuse me, is someone passing by? Could you do me a favor, please?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nope, Paimon wasn't dreaming. There's someone over there for sure, but... Paimon doesn't see anyone...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 faissolle 03.ogg}} '''???:''' Ah, did you two hear my call? Thank you so much... I'm over here, inside this big box.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhh... You're inside the box!? No wonder Paimon didn't see anything... Well, c'mon, {{Traveler}}, let's go take a look.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Umm... Why are you hiding in here, anyway? If we hadn't happened to pass by, you could have been stuck for days!
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 faissolle 04.ogg}} '''Faissolle:''' Uhh, it's a bit complicated... Can we not talk about that for now?
:{{DIcon}} Did someone... shave your eyebrows?
:{{DIcon}} Did someone... strip you of your clothes?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, that's terrible! Did someone seriously do that to you?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 faissolle 05.ogg}} '''Faissolle:''' No, no, it was nothing quite that serious. I'd just like some help finding my hat...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just your hat? But then... Why can't you look for it yourself?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, Paimon gets it! Something must have happened to your hair...
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, we don't have to ask.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, there's no need to spell it out.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sorry, sorry! So that's what happened... Paimon gets it now. Hehe, no wonder why you had to hide inside the box!
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, you just need your hat, right? We'll get it back to you right away! What kind of hat was it?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 faissolle 06.ogg}} '''Faissolle:''' I think you may have misunderstood me, but... *sigh* Never mind, please just help me find my hat.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 faissolle 07.ogg}} '''Faissolle:''' It's a soft and brown hat, with a bit of a brim. Nothing fancy.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 faissolle 08.ogg}} '''Faissolle:''' I think I probably lost it near the entrance elevator. It was getting a bit hot, so I took it off and had a quick nap. But when I came to, it was gone...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 faissolle 09.ogg}} '''Faissolle:''' It's really important to me, so your help would mean the world. I'll wait here for your return.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 1 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Don't worry, we'll be back in no time!

:{{DIcon|!}} Knock on the Chest
:{{A|vo dialog dyzlq001 faissolle 01.ogg}} '''Faissolle:''' I'm really sorry to bother you like this... Please come back soon!

{{Quest Description|update|You and Paimon arrive at the dormitories in the Fortress of Meropide and hear someone calling for help inside a box. Turns out that he needed help looking for his hat which, according to him, is something very important. You decide to search for it in the nearby area...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the lift)
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, Paimon doesn't see anything here... Let's go somewhere else.

;(Interact with the box)
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just where is that thing? This is taking longer than Paimon thought...

;(Interact with the railings)
:{{A|vo dialog dyzlq001 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Nothing in the water, either... Paimon thought it might have gotten blown in...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've looked everywhere, and still not seen anything that looks like a hat...
:{{DIcon}} Let's turn back. We can't scour the entire Fortress.
:{{DIcon}} We can just buy him a hat.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, that's a good idea! If he's just looking to cover his head, then it shouldn't matter what kind of hat he's wearing.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why don't we check out the Rag and Bone Shop? If memory serves, they've got all kinds of stuff in there!
:{{DIcon}} You sure get fired up quick when it comes to shopping...
::{{A|vo dyzlq001 5 paimon 04a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, you'll let Paimon pick out some other stuff too, right? If we're going to the shop anyway...
:{{DIcon}} ...I'm only paying for the hat.
::{{A|vo dyzlq001 5 paimon 04b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? How did you know what Paimon was thinking!?
::{{A|vo dyzlq001 5 paimon 04b 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* This is bad, nothing gets past you nowadays...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, either way, let's go check it out first.

;(Approach the Rag and Bone shop)
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh? Paimon doesn't remember you being the boss...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 chamboduc 01.ogg}} '''Chamboduc:''' Hahaha, I'm just standing in for Mr. Alvard while he's off restocking the shop.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 chamboduc 02.ogg}} '''Chamboduc:''' Now just wait a sec... a blonde foreigner dressed all in white, accompanied by a glaze-covered flying chunk of gingerbread...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 chamboduc 03.ogg}} '''Chamboduc:''' You must be the legendary Traveler and their companion Paimon?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No! Uh... Well, you're... half right? Paimon's {{Traveler}}'s treasured companion, sure, but she's not some flying chunk of gingerbread!
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 chamboduc 04.ogg}} '''Chamboduc:''' Sorry, sorry! I just... I never thought I'd get the chance to see you with my own eyes, so I got a bit ahead of myself.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 chamboduc 05.ogg}} '''Chamboduc:''' I hope you'll find it in your magnanimous hearts to forgive my discourtesy. I'm just a nobody, after all.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, there's no need to put yourself down like that! Paimon's just venting...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 chamboduc 06.ogg}} '''Chamboduc:''' Well, your heroic actions at Erinnyes have long made their way to the Fortress of Meropide.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 chamboduc 07.ogg}} '''Chamboduc:''' We heard that you were personally received by His Grace when you made your way down here, you know. Ah, you were the envy of all...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 chamboduc 08.ogg}} '''Chamboduc:''' And you're now one of His Grace's favorite people, so of course, everyone wants to be introduced to you.
:{{DIcon}} Ah, so it's because of him...
:{{DIcon}} And here I thought I had made it as a hero...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 chamboduc 09.ogg}} '''Chamboduc:''' Haha, I figured you'd appreciate honesty over flattery.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 chamboduc 10.ogg}} '''Chamboduc:''' After all, I also only joined up here because I'd heard Mr. Alvard was a good friend of the Duke.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 chamboduc 11.ogg}} '''Chamboduc:''' And though I've only caught scant sight of His Grace since then, as fate would have it, I've become fast friends with Mr. Alvard himself.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 chamboduc 12.ogg}} '''Chamboduc:''' I mean, we've all got agendas, but rather than trying to force something to be true, it's often better to just go with the flow.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so now, you're trying to kiss up to us.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 chamboduc 13.ogg}} '''Chamboduc:''' Well, I did mean it when I called you legends, and it is indeed an honor to meet the two of you.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 chamboduc 14.ogg}} '''Chamboduc:''' But enough of that &mdash; is there something you're looking for?
:{{DIcon}} A man's hat.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 chamboduc 15.ogg}} '''Chamboduc:''' No problem. Anything else?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 chamboduc 16.ogg}} '''Chamboduc:''' Feel free to check out anything you want. The Credit Coupon costs are on me.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, but that's... You don't have to be so nice!
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 chamboduc 17.ogg}} '''Chamboduc:''' Well, it's not like I'm getting paid to watch this shop. Instead of Mora or coupons, Mr. Alvard usually just lets me take my pick of our goods.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 chamboduc 18.ogg}} '''Chamboduc:''' Life's been pretty good recently, so I might as well just waive your bill. Never hurts to make some friends...
:{{DIcon}} Well, if you put it that way...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright... Paimon will take a look...
:{{Black Screen|After a moment's hesitation, Paimon manages to pick out two snacks.}}
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 chamboduc 19.ogg}} '''Chamboduc:''' Are you sure you don't want more? These opportunities don't come by every day, you know.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's alright! Two will do.
:{{DIcon}} I never thought you'd turn down a chance to freeload...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh, it just doesn't feel the same if the owner's offering everything to you for free!
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But anyway, we don't need to get into that right now. We can discuss Paimonology later &mdash; that poor guy must still be waiting for us.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Thank you so much! We'll be off, then.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 chamboduc 20.ogg}} '''Chamboduc:''' No problem, and thank you for your patronage! I'd appreciate it if you could put in a nice word for our establishment the next time you speak to His Grace.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's a real sneaky way of getting good reviews...

;(Obtain [[Hat]])
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 6 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've been gone awhile... Paimon hopes that guy in the box hasn't passed out from lack of air.

;(Talk to Chamboduc again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dyzlq001 chamboduc 01.ogg}} '''Chamboduc:''' Please come again! And don't forget to mention us to Your Grace!

:{{DIcon|!}} Knock on the Chest
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You can come out now! We've found your hat.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 faissolle 01.ogg}} '''Faissolle:''' You did? Oh, Archons, you've just saved my life! Just one sec...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 faissolle 02.ogg}} '''Faissolle:''' Hmm... Uhh...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, so you're not actually bald? You've got such a full head of hair, too!
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 faissolle 03.ogg}} '''Faissolle:''' *sigh* I mean, I told you that there had been a misunderstanding... This has nothing to do with my hair.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 faissolle 04.ogg}} '''Faissolle:''' Wait, this isn't my hat...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, we got you a new one! We tried really hard to look for your hat, but no dice.
:{{DIcon}} To be precise, someone else gave it to us...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 faissolle 05.ogg}} '''Faissolle:''' Ah, I see... Thank you so much. I'm really grateful, but unfortunately, there's just something special about my hat...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Does it have some kind of sentimental value?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 faissolle 06.ogg}} '''Faissolle:''' Well, um...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 faissolle 07.ogg}} '''Faissolle:''' Sorry, I can't... explain at the moment. Time's tight as well, so I suppose I'll keep looking for a while...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 wriothesley 01.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' If you're looking for a hat, I just picked one up over here. Is it yours?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 faissolle 08.ogg}} '''Faissolle:''' Your Grace!?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, hey, Wriothesley! It's been a while.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 wriothesley 02.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' It's a slow day today, so I decided to go for a little stroll. Even if your work space isn't cramped, it's still good to get some air.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 wriothesley 03.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I'll say, I'm not at all surprised to find the two of you here. You never could turn down someone's request for help.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, it's what good adventurers do, after all!
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 wriothesley 04.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Is that so... Maybe I should consider asking the Adventurers' Guild to open a branch here.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 wriothesley 05.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' As I recall, these hats are very important to members of the Beret Society. Best you avoid misplacing it again, hmm?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 wriothesley 06.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' You might not have the same luck next time.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 faissolle 09.ogg}} '''Faissolle:''' Understood. Th&mdash;Thank you so much, Your Grace.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 faissolle 10.ogg}} '''Faissolle:''' Then... Then I'll be off. Umm... I&mdash;I'll get going now.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What a strange guy... Why'd he care so much about his hat?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, and has he done something wrong? When he saw you, it was as if he'd seen a ghost.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 wriothesley 07.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Oh, not at all. In fact, members of the Beret Society are model prisoners. They work hard and never get into trouble &mdash; they've saved me a lot of work, in fact.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 wriothesley 08.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' As for him... I'd guess he's just more of an introvert. It's not unusual for the more shy prisoners to freak out when I show up unannounced.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Shy? There are prisoners who are... afraid to talk to people?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 wriothesley 09.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Prisoners are still people, after all. There are as many crimes and motives as there are stars in the sky.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 wriothesley 10.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' The idea of the criminal as a selfish, heartless brute is just a stereotype. Such labels could never capture the complexity of even a single individual person.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 wriothesley 11.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' What kind of a person a prisoner may be, and why they have committed a crime &mdash; we'd never know these things if they don't share their story with us.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, you've got a point... Anyway, it's all good as long as it makes sense to you.
:{{DIcon}} What's this "Beret Society"?
:{{DIcon}} There are people here who enjoy working?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 wriothesley 12.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Although most of the societies here will just turn individual brawls into mass ones...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 wriothesley 13.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' The Beret Society does appear to be an exception in that it's instead trying to experiment with some novel and interesting things.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 wriothesley 14.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' If you have some time, why don't we grab something at the Coupon Cafeteria? It'll give us some time to catch up, too.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 wriothesley 15.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' And if you're still interested in the Berets after that, I can take you to their usual gathering place as well.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's not the biggest fan of that cafeteria, but if we're gonna catch up...
:{{DIcon}} Let's go, then.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 7 wriothesley 16.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Alright then, please follow me.

:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wolsey 01.ogg}} '''Wolsey:''' Welcome, Your Grace, and the Traveler. Would you like three orders of today's Welfare Meal?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wolsey 02.ogg}} '''Wolsey:''' Unfortunately, we weren't informed of your visit in advance, so we didn't prepare any Super Deluxe Welfare Meals today...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 01.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I'll pass on the food, then. What about you?
:{{DIcon}} I'm not hungry.
:{{DIcon}} Super Deluxe or bust.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Then, Paimon will also pass. Paimon will save her stomach for something better!
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 02.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' What a pity... It would seem that none of us can properly appreciate your skills, Wolsey.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wolsey 03.ogg}} '''Wolsey:''' Haha, then I must beg Your Grace to find me some more ingredients, so I can come up with some more Welfare Meal recipes.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wolsey 04.ogg}} '''Wolsey:''' If you're not in the mood to eat, I can get you some drinks. We just got some great shipments in from above.

:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wolsey 05.ogg}} '''Wolsey:''' Haha, it's not for everyone. Think of it as a special treat for VIPs.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, now that's what Paimon likes to hear! In that case, two bottles of the drink for Paimon, please!
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wolsey 06.ogg}} '''Wolsey:''' Two bottles, coming right up!
:{{Black Screen|After a while, Wolsey brings out the drinks for everyone.}}
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 03.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Our first meeting took place on short notice, and we were both swamped by everything that happened after, so there was no time for more casual chit-chat.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 04.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I'm actually quite fond of stories, you know. Of course, the others have already told me a lot about your deeds in Fontaine, but I'd love to hear it straight from the source.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, that'd be quite the long story...
:{{DIcon}} We fought tooth and nail for the sake of justice.
::{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 05a 1.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Impressive. Not all who possess the courage to risk their life for their ideals also have the strength to make it out unscathed.
::{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 05a 2.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Had you not possessed these remarkable qualities, I probably wouldn't have had the chance to make your acquaintance in the first place.
:{{DIcon}} I'm still trying to learn more about Fontaine.
::{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 05b 1.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I see. Certainly, that'd fit your title as the Traveler.
::{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 05b 2.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Seeing everything for yourself, recording everything to the best of your ability, and making lots of friends along the way... I'm sure that by the end of your journey, you'll possess an unmatched amount of perspectives and opportunities.
:{{DIcon}} To be honest, I really wasn't that involved with a lot of it...
::{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 05c 1.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Haha, that's a bit too humble for you.
::{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 05c 2.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Even the most unintentional action can catalyze new developments, and force many fates onto brand new paths.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon gets the sense that you're trying to flatter us...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That guy we talked to earlier was obviously trying to get us to put in a good word for him, but you're the Duke, right? Why would you need to get on our good side?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 06.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Well, after all, you did help the Fortress and I maintain our autonomy.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 07.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Is it so strange that I would want to give a few words of praise out of genuine admiration?
:{{DIcon}} Just a little bit.
:{{DIcon}} It's because you don't ever talk about yourself.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 08.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Ah, so this is a matter of trust. Which is unfortunate, since I don't have nearly as interesting of a story to offer about myself.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 09.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I was convicted and sent here at an early age. I only became the top dog after spending a long time figuring out its inner workings.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 10.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Power and control come in many forms, some fair and ethical, others less so. And since we're all sinners here, the victor calls the shots, no matter how they managed to get to the top.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 11.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' So, what do you think? Didn't put you much more at ease, now did it?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, kinda... You're really different from most of the people we've met so far...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 12.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Haha, I'm perfectly aware of that, too. But even so, that doesn't make me think any less of you.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 13.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I would very much like to maintain friendly relations with you two.
:{{DIcon}} That's how I feel as well.
:{{DIcon}} I must thank you for your generosity, but...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 guelet 01.ogg}} '''Guelet:''' Your Grace, after following your instructions, we were able to find a box of undeclared contraband in the latest shipment of cargo.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 guelet 02.ogg}} '''Guelet:''' They were extremely well-hidden, and we've confirmed that the senders have been using this method to smuggle goods for a while. We're trying to trace the goods to their source.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 14.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Got it. Leave the box here, and contact me immediately if you make any progress. You're dismissed.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 guelet 03.ogg}} '''Guelet:''' Yes, Your Grace.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 15.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Sorry, I'd almost completely forgotten about this.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She mentioned something about "contraband." Are they like, dangerous goods?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 16.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Not necessarily. The term is just applied to things people want to bring in on the sly.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 17.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Many people here are experts at pulling rabbits out of the most ordinary hats, so we have to examine everything carefully.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 18.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Now, what do we have here... Hmm, it's more or less what I expected.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, this is certainly a box of curiosities! Mora, snacks, yarn balls, ropes, mechanical parts, and even a gem!
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, if you've confiscated this entire box, then does that mean... all of this belongs to you now?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 19.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Yep. We can't just send them back up now, can we?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whaaaat? But that's just insane profit! {{Traveler}}, why don't you become a Duke as well?
:{{DIcon}} And what about you, Paimon?
::{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 12a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon will be your vault-keeper!
:{{DIcon}} Let's get that title, then.
::{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 20b 1.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' It's only been a couple minutes since we agreed to continue friendly relations with each other, and you're already planning to overthrow me?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 21.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Jokes aside, I didn't know you would be so interested in this box. How about this, then? You can pick anything you want from it. Consider it a gift from me.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? You'll let Paimon pick anything?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No takebacks! Paimon will have you know that she's got a real good eye for treasure!
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 22.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I never joke about things like this.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright... Paimon's gonna have a look...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon wants... this one! This dark, sparkly gem &mdash; you just know it must be worth a ton of Mora!
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Umm... Uhh...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Actually, never mind. Paimon doesn't want this gem anymore... Can Paimon pick something else instead?
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, what's wrong?
:{{DIcon}} Are you feeling unwell?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's something... weird about this gem. Paimon remembered a lot of bad things when she picked it up...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon couldn't even tune them out... It's as if the gem was just drawing them out of Paimon's brain. It was super spooky...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 23.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Is that so? Let me give it a try.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 24.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Uhh...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 25.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Paimon's right. I, too, experienced some unpleasant flashbacks.
:{{DIcon}} Huh, let me try...
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 26.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Are you sure? I wouldn't exactly call it fun.
:{{DIcon}} I want to make sure I know exactly what you saw.
:{{DIcon}} My constitution is a bit different from everyone else's.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 27.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Fair enough. Go ahead. I don't think it'll have a permanent effect.

:'''{{Traveler}}:''' !!!
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 21.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you okay, {{Traveler}}? You also saw something, right?
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, it's just as you said.
:{{DIcon}} I relived some... rather unforgettable memories.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 28.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I'll take this gem, then, and run a thorough investigation on its properties. Paimon, feel free to pick something else.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 22.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then... Actually, never mind. Paimon's gonna pass. Paimon was thinking about one of the snacks, but who knows if it'll also make Paimon sick...
:{{DIcon}} An astute decision.
:{{DIcon}} It doesn't hurt to be careful.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 29.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' You do have a point. In that case, we should destroy the entire box and all of its contents.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 30.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Seems like we're almost done with our drinks, too. Let's go check out the Society's gathering place, then.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 31.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I can introduce you, and we can also continue our conversation while we're at it.
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 paimon 23.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, are you this free every day or something?
:{{A|vo dyzlq001 8 wriothesley 32.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Just noticed? I wasn't exactly busy the first time we met, either.

;(Talk to Wolsey, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog dyzlq001 wolsey 01.ogg}} '''Wolsey:''' Hmm... I should probably always keep a few Super Deluxe Welfare Meals in stock.
