==Dialogue==
===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing ''Ancient Colors''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Serene:''' Hmm. There's much left to do today...
:{{DIcon}} Are there any Melusines around who might need help?
;(Randomly proceeds to one of the following valid dialogues)
:;(Before helping [[Cosanzeana]] in ''There Will Come Soft Rains'')
:::'''Serene:''' One moment... Ah, yes. There's Cosanzeana. I think she's been concerned about her inability to grow flowers...
:::'''Serene:''' Not that I know anything about flowers. I've tried to help her, but to no avail...
:::'''Serene:''' Would you know something about that?
:::{{DIcon}} When I sing, flowers bloom...
::::'''Serene:''' Really? That sounds like it'd make for a lovely scene... In that case, I do hope that you can bless her flowers with a song.
::::'''Serene:''' I'd love to help myself, but it seems that deep subject matter knowledge will be required...
::::'''Serene:''' Would you be willing to visit her garden {{color|buzzword|at the village entrance}} and give her some suggestions?
:::{{DIcon}} I guess I know a thing or two.
::::'''Serene:''' Do you really? Great! I'm afraid I haven't any knowledge myself... In which case, I'd be grateful if you could go see her garden.
::::'''Serene:''' I'd love to help myself, but it seems that deep subject matter knowledge will be required...
::::'''Serene:''' Would you be willing to visit her garden and give her some suggestions?
:::{{DIcon}} Just leave it to me.
:::'''Serene:''' Alright. I do hope that she'll be able to grow some beautiful flowers...
:;(Before beginning ''[["Hey, This Isn't Pumpkin Soup..."]]'')
:::'''Serene:''' Hmm. One moment. There's [[Verenata]], I suppose. She's an earnest and hardworking sort, and she's learning from [[Carabosse]]. She says she wants to be able to help everyone...
:::'''Serene:''' She's been struggling with some new medicine or another. I'm not sure about the details, but... *sigh* I wish Carabosse would be a bit more serious...
:::{{DIcon}} What can I do to help?
:::'''Serene:''' I'm not all that sure myself... It seems to have something to do with developing medicine, or something.
:::'''Serene:''' But if you do go and help her out, I'm sure she'll be very happy... And I'll be, too!
:;(After completing ''"Hey, This Isn't Pumpkin Soup..."'' but before beginning ''[[The Lone Phantom Sail]]'')
:::'''Serene:''' Right. Let me think... There's [[Ahes]]. I believe she's been claiming recently that she's "seen a ship in my dreams"...
:::'''Serene:''' I don't know what's going on with her, but I am quite worried...
:::{{DIcon}} That sounds problematic.
:::'''Serene:''' True. Whatever the case, could you head over to the {{color|buzzword|place with a lot of ships}} north of the village, and see if you can help?
:::{{DIcon}} Alright, you can count on me.
:::'''Serene:''' Thank you so much.
:;(Before beginning ''[[Fishing Game]]'')
:::'''Serene:''' Hmm. Let me think about this... Well, there's [[Iara]]. She seems to be having some trouble with fishing...
:::{{DIcon}} Fishing?
:::'''Serene:''' Yes. She said that she met an angler named [[Delaroche]] and learned fishing skills from her... Despite that, she's been unable to catch anything &mdash; much to her consternation...
:::;(If ''[[Delaroche's Bait]]'' has been completed)
::::{{DIcon}} Delaroche? Seriously?
::::{{DIcon}} I think she might've gone for the wrong teacher...
::::'''Serene:''' Oh, is that so? Oh dear.
:::'''Serene:''' *sigh* I'm not sure how I can help her. I've given it some thought, though &mdash; if all else fails, I can play the role of the fish myself...
:::'''Serene:''' But that's not really a solution I'd call "good," so... Could you try helping her?
:::{{DIcon}} No problem!
:::{{DIcon}} Oh, I'm a real pro!
:::'''Serene:''' Wonderful! She should still be trying to fish {{color|buzzword| at the south side of the village}}... So please, {{Traveler}} give her some pointers!
:;(Before beginning ''[[Book of Esoteric Revelations]]'')
:::'''Serene:''' One moment... Ah, yes. There's [[Canotila]]. I think she's been puzzling over a certain book...
:::'''Serene:''' See, she's still in intense meditation over there, beneath that waterfall.
:::'''Serene:''' She says she can't understand its contents... and neither can I, but perhaps an experienced adventurer like you might be able to help her.
:::{{DIcon}} I'll give it a go.
:::'''Serene:''' Alright. I do hope that Canotila can resolve this matter that so confuses her...
:;(After completing ''[[Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic Dog]]'' but before beginning ''[[Strange Stone Chronicle (Part 1)|Strange Stone Chronicle]]'')
:::'''Serene:''' Huh. Let me see... Right, I believe [[Puca]] said that she's lost her token...
:::'''Serene:''' These tokens are exceedingly important to us... Um, I was originally going to help her find it, like, immediately, but I can't quite leave now...
:::{{DIcon}} Leave it to me!
:::'''Serene:''' Thank you, I'll leave Puca in your capable hands, then!
;(Otherwise, if no quests are available)
::'''Serene:''' Let me think. Actually, I don't think there's anyone around who really needs help at the moment!
::'''Serene:''' Still, troubles do often crop up in places that we can't see... For all we know, some of us might come to need your help in the future, {{Traveler}}...
;(After Step 3 of ''There Will Come Soft Rains'' and before completing ''[[Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic Dog]]'')
:{{DIcon}} About the earthquake just a while ago...
::'''Serene:''' Indeed. What was with that earthquake earlier?
::'''Serene:''' It didn't seem to have any negative consequences, but for things to start shaking so strongly all of a sudden... I'll have to report this to Monsieur [[Neuvillette]]...
:{{DIcon}} Could you tell me about [[Merusea Village]]?
::'''Serene:''' Huh? Is it your first time here? Well, in that case, welcome!
::'''Serene:''' This is the home of us Melusines, but... as you can see, owing to the location, we don't get many human visitors.
::'''Serene:''' Be sure to let me know if you run into any trouble here, or if you need anything at all.
::{{DIcon}} Are you the village head?
:::'''Serene:''' The village head... do you mean some person who's in charge of everyone?
:::'''Serene:''' I don't think that describes me. I'm just a little older than the other kids. As everyone's big sister, it's my responsibility to help with day-to-day issues.
:::'''Serene:''' That's right &mdash; I've gotta look after everyone.
::{{DIcon}} See you.
:::'''Serene:''' Mmhmm, bye now! Please do let me know if I can help you with anything.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Serene:''' Mmhmm, bye! Please do let me know if you need anything.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available when approaching Serene's platform after completing ''Ancient Colors''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Serene:''' Ah, {{Traveler}} and Paimon! Could you come over here for a moment?

;(Approach Serene)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Serene? Why did you call out to us? Did something happen?
:'''Serene:''' Yeah, so, remember when you two said you wanted to go collect some components, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Collecting components... Ah, you mean fixing [[Seymour]]!
:'''Serene:''' Yeah, at that time I didn't have that many components with me, so I couldn't help you two...
:'''Serene:''' So I went out and collected some more!
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! You sure got a lot!
:'''Serene:''' Please take them. This way, you can speed up the repairs, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Well, thanks a lot, but Seymour is already fixed...
:'''Serene:''' Huh? Already? Wow, I should have expected that from you two!
:'''Serene:''' If that's the case, you doubly deserve these components!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh?
:'''Serene:''' You've been putting in a lot of work to help everyone, right?
:'''Serene:''' If that's the case, then I would like you two to have these components as a token of my gratitude. Thank you for taking care of everyone in the village!
:'''Serene:''' It just so happens that {{color|buzzword|[[Xana]]}} is here in the village too! If you need anything, you can trade with her using these components!

''Available after completing ''Ancient Colors''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{DIcon|Reward}} About the earthquake before...
::'''Serene:''' Ah, Mamere told me about the situation. It was the first time that the kid talked that much...
::'''Serene:''' Anyway, Monsieur Neuvillette is very concerned about the matter. I heard that the [[Marechaussee Phantom]] has already sent someone to investigate.
::'''Serene:''' Thank you so much for your help! Right, a&mdash;as a token of gratitude, please, take this!
