===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before completing ''[[Special Friends]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Wactana:''' "I have neither goals I must reach, nor have I urgent desires. I am a happy shepherd. I care only for alpacas, for the seasons and things that grow, for the cool breeze and rains..."
:'''Wactana:''' That's my favorite song. What do you think? Pretty good, huh?

::'''Wactana:''' That I have the life I enjoy now is all thanks to his sense of responsibility. Speaking of his name, I did plan to call him something more normal...
::'''Wactana:''' Back then, I was friends with a chef from [[Sumeru]], and was trying all kinds of creative dishes, so I thought of naming him for some kind of food.
::'''Wactana:''' Now he might look pretty fierce, but he's a sweetie on the inside, and occasionally makes a few harmless mistakes when he gets too reckless... Yeah, "Half-Baked" fits his vibe just fine!
:{{DIcon}} About [[Alpaca]]s...
::'''Wactana:''' Floofy and furry, they're super cute! Sometimes, when I really wanna take an afternoon nap, I use them for pillows, and it feels like... That must be what it feels like to sleep on a cloud, right?
::'''Wactana:''' Hmm... Maybe their fleece could be used to make pillows or cushions...
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you to it, then.
::'''Wactana:''' Here's wishing you a peaceful and pleasant day!
