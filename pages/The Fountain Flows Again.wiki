{{Quest Description|A fountain on Erinnyes seems to have... a small problem...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Examine the fountain)
:'''Observe the fountain:''' (The fountain is silent, and seems to have stopped working...)
:{{Black Screen|As you observe the fountain, someone else arrives...}}
:'''Remaudiere:''' *sigh*&nbsp;...Why hasn't Edel fixed this fountain yet...
:'''Remaudiere:''' If this doesn't get fixed soon, [[Keratry]]'s going to make sure everyone in Teyvat hears about it...
:{{DIcon}} Is this fountain broken?
:'''Remaudiere:''' *sigh* Just a few days ago, it was still working just fine, but now it's suddenly stopped.
:'''Remaudiere:''' What's worse, it broke just as I was performing magic tricks for Keratry!
:'''Remaudiere:''' My parents were at the opera when it happened, and they told me to stay at home with my sister, and entertain her with games or books...
:'''Remaudiere:''' But Keratry wouldn't stop pestering me to take her out. I just couldn't stop her, and ended up taking her outside to play.
:'''Remaudiere:''' When we got to the fountain, Keratry suddenly said she wanted to wait for her parents to come out of the opera, so she could walk home with them.
:{{DIcon}} That doesn't sound too bad.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah. Paimon thinks since you already walked all that way, if you waited for your parents to come out, maybe they would have treated you to something yummy!
:'''Remaudiere:''' It was already really late by then... if Mom and Dad found out that I snuck my sister out and we were loitering around at night, they'd kill me!
:'''Remaudiere:''' So, I told a little white lie to Keratry. I told her I knew a magic trick that could make the fountain stop spraying water.
:'''Remaudiere:''' Actually, I just knew the timing between spurts of water, and I wanted to amuse her and get her to go home.
:'''Remaudiere:''' I correctly estimated when the fountain would stop, and my sister bought my "magic" spiel hook, line and sinker. She wouldn't stop badgering me to teach her how to do this "spell" all the way home.
:'''Remaudiere:''' So, after I brought her home, I made up some stuff to satisfy her curiosity, and got her to go to bed before heading back to my room. Mom and Dad came home a little while later, and everything seemed normal...
:'''Remaudiere:''' But the next day, when I was out getting the paper for dad, I realized that this fountain was still not working... It was broken!
:{{DIcon}} Your magic is pretty powerful.
:{{DIcon}} As expected of a mighty magician.
:'''Remaudiere:''' Come on, don't tease me! If Keratry mentions this to Mom and Dad, I'm toast!
:'''Remaudiere:''' "Eh? The fountain at the plaza suddenly broke down? What do you think happened, dear?"
:'''Remaudiere:''' "That's... really strange. It seemed fine before we went to the opera that night."
:'''Remaudiere:''' "I know why! It's because Remaudiere made it stop! Isn't that right?"
:{{DIcon}} That's a really good impression!
:{{DIcon}} Thanks to your vivid and passionate performance, I now totally understand the situation.
:'''Remaudiere:''' And what's more, they'll find out that my sister and I were out at night, and then they'll yell at me so much, and I'll be in hot water for the next two months!
:'''Paimon:''' But... this fountain should have someone managing it, right? If it's broken, can't they just call someone to fix it?
:'''Remaudiere:''' I told the fountain's manager, Edel, about this, and he promised me that he would fix it as soon as possible. But... even now, the problem hasn't been sorted out.
:'''Remaudiere:''' I can't hide it much longer, I'm finished, totally finished...
:{{DIcon}} I'll go ask him about it for you.
:{{DIcon}} Aw, this isn't a big deal. I'll give you a hand.
:'''Remaudiere:''' Really? You're willing to help? In that case, I'll give you my... my spare allowance, all of it!
:'''Remaudiere:''' Edel is over there. Please hurry up and go ask him what's going on!

;(Talk to Remaudiere again, optional)
:'''Remaudiere:''' I won't be able to hide what happened much longer. Is this the end of the line for me...?

;(Talk to Edel)
:'''Edel:''' The pipes here need to be changed... and the valves... there's also the matter of cleaning the thing... *sigh* Problems on top of problems.
:'''Edel:''' Huh? Do you need something? From the look of you... You're not Estelle's repair crew...
:{{DIcon}} About Remaudiere...
:'''Edel:''' Oh, him? Heh, his magic is really something. It rusted a valve in the fountain's bottommost piping and also completely broke the nozzle.
:'''Edel:''' Hahaha, I jest. Actually, it was the deformed valve getting stuck that jammed the entire water system. For safety reasons, we temporarily shut down the entire fountain.
:'''Edel:''' But why did the nozzle break? I really don't know... It's so weird.
:'''Edel:''' Remaudiere keeps saying if the fountain doesn't get fixed soon, he's going to get chewed out... But there was only so much I could do previously...
:'''Edel:''' I finally had some time to order a new valve and nozzle from Estelle today, and I'm about to go to the city to get it.
:'''Edel:''' You can come with me if you want. I have quite a lot of things to collect, so I'm a little worried that I won't be able to manage on my own.
----
;(Talk to Estelle)
:'''Estelle:''' Hello, how can I... Oh, Edel?
:'''Edel:''' I'm here for the valve and nozzle. If the fountain isn't fixed soon, we'll drive that kid Remaudiere up the wall.
:'''Estelle:''' Th&mdash;The valve, you say...
:'''Edel:''' Uh, why are you stuttering? Estelle... You didn't forget to make it, did you?
:'''Estelle:''' No! I did make one. But... a previous client had to do urgent repairs on something else...
:'''Estelle:''' S&mdash;So I, uh, gave her some general parts...
:'''Estelle:''' Don't worry! I'm in the midst of making a new one right now! It'll be ready shortly!
:'''Edel:''' Miss Estelle, I put that order in long ago...
:'''Estelle:''' I know! But that client of mine was in a hurry. She claimed that she needed to repair a sewage valve, and her pleading got the better of me...
:'''Estelle:''' It's alright! Once... once the Iron Chunk I purchased arrives, I'll be able to make that valve! It should be here soon!
:'''Edel:''' When did you put that order in?
:'''Estelle:''' Th&mdash;This morning...
:{{DIcon}} Leave the matter of the Iron Chunks to me.
:{{DIcon}} I'll go get you those Iron Chunks.
:'''Estelle:''' Really? Excellent, then, excellent! We'll be counting on you, Traveler.
:'''Estelle:''' Sorry! I'm really sorry! Just three Iron Chunks will be enough.
:'''Edel:''' Well, we'll be counting on you, Traveler. Don't worry about remuneration. I won't have you working for free.

;(Talk to Edel, optional)
:'''Edel:''' But on the other hand, that kid, Remaudiere, will go nuts if the fountain isn't repaired soon.

;(Talk to Estelle)
:'''Estelle:''' Traveler, did you get the iron chunks?
:;(Submit {{Item|Iron Chunk|x=3}})
:'''Estelle:''' These should be enough! Hang on, it'll only take me a second.
:{{Black Screen|Estelle begins working in a frenzy...}}
:'''Estelle:''' Alright, done! We've got the valve and nozzle, as well as all the general components we'll need. It's all ready.
:'''Estelle:''' Edel, Traveler, let's head to Erinnyes. As long as I'm there, the fountain should be fixed in no time.
:'''Edel:''' Thank you... I'll take these things, Traveler. Let's get going.
:;(The Traveler and others arrive at the fountain)<!-- screen transition -->
:'''Edel:''' This is the place. Let's get to work. This fountain has been quiet for too long. Time to get it back up and running again.
:{{Black Screen|The two take to their tasks with gusto...}}
:'''Estelle:''' The valve has been installed. I've also performed a comprehensive examination. No major issues.
:'''Edel:''' Alright. Then let's stand back for a moment. The only remaining task should be to open the sluice gate.
:'''Edel:''' Let me see... The main sluice is over there, and the secondary sluice will also need to be operated...
:'''Edel:''' Please wait for me here. I'm going to open the sluice gates.
:'''Edel:''' Who even designed this system? Why did they put the sluice gates so far away...
:{{Black Screen|Edel sprints over to the sluice gates with all haste and comes back after a while...}}
:'''Edel:''' Agh, opening them was a pain. I'm beat...
:'''Edel:''' Let's wait a moment. The water should come rushing in shortly.
:{{Black Screen|After some dull rumbling sounds, the fountain resumes normal functionality...}}
:'''Remaudiere:''' Awesome! The fountain is working again... Now, even if Keratry mentions what happened that night, I can pretend I don't know what she's talking about...
:{{DIcon}} Now you know to be careful with your magic shows.
:{{DIcon}} Now you know that magic and miracles all come with a price.
:'''Remaudiere:''' This isn't a problem caused by magic at all... But thanks a lot anyway. Here. This is my spare allowance &mdash; please accept it.
:'''Remaudiere:''' The payment I promised you is in there too. Thanks for your help.
:'''Remaudiere:''' And thank you too, Edel, Ms. Estelle!
:'''Edel:''' This is as it should be &mdash; think nothing of it. Next time, don't take your little sister out in the middle of the night... Uh...
:'''Keratry:''' Brother! What are you doing here?
:'''Remaudiere:''' Keratry!? What are you doing here? Aren't you... weren't you supposed to be on a stroll with Mom and Dad?
:'''Keratry:''' Hehe... I ran off while they weren't looking. I wanted to see how the fountain's doing.
:'''Keratry:''' Didn't you use magic to stop this fountain? I thought it wouldn't have started flowing yet...
:'''Remaudiere:''' Haha... Um... Hehe... Magic has its limits. I'm sure you know that, right? It only works for a set amount of time...
:'''Keratry:''' Ooh... Then I wanna see more magic! Can you make the fountain stop again!?
:'''Remaudiere:''' This, uh... *cough* Keratry, there are lots of other people around, you know.
:'''Remaudiere:''' If I stop it, I'll upset all the people who want to watch it...
:'''Keratry:''' Well... We can just come back later! And let's bring Mom and Dad too. I'm sure they'll also want to see you do magic!
:'''Remaudiere:''' Huh?! No, that's... Dear sister, I haven't really... fully mastered this fountain magic.
:'''Remaudiere:''' I'm sure our parents won't want to see some lame, half-baked magic.
:'''Remaudiere:''' That's why you can't mention my "fountain magic" to our parents just yet.
:'''Remaudiere:''' I want to understand it thoroughly before surprising them.
:'''Keratry:''' Okay! I'm sure they'll love it once you do!
:'''Remaudiere:''' Yup, I'm sure they will. But let's head home first, alright? I... I can show you some new magic once we do...
