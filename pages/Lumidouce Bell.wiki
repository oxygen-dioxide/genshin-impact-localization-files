==Description==
{{Description|A serene and tranquil violet flower. It has a light, soft, and lasting scent and is often used for making rare perfumes.<br>Lumidouce Bell is said to represent parting and the wish for reunion.<br>In [[Coppelius]]'s play Golden [[Hyperborea]], the flower is referred to as "Weeping Crystal." The play depicts a homesick flower wandering in the [[Snezhnaya|freezing lands of the north]]. Its beauty is made eternal by the icy winds. Critics of Coppelius's time thought that he was obsessed with eternal beauty and eternal love—this obsession was written into every line of his last works.|[[Archive]]}}
