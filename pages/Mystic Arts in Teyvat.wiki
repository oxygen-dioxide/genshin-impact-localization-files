'''Mystic Arts''' encompasses various forms of magic, rituals, or otherwise supernatural abilities practiced in the continent of [[Teyvat]].

==Mondstadt==
===Alchemy===
{{Main|Alchemy}}

[[Alchemy]] is openly practiced in [[Mondstadt]]. Because of this, various sub-categories of alchemy exist. Although [[Liyue]]'s [[adepti]] also practice their own form of alchemy, their techniques are a closely-guarded secret, and most people are unaware of its existence.

====Bio-Alchemy====
Bio-Alchemy focuses on the modification, or transformation, of existing life. Its only known practitioner is [[Sucrose]].

====Art of Khemia====
{{main|Art of Khemia}}
The Art of Khemia is an ancient, powerful form of alchemy developed in [[Khaenri'ah]]. Its most notable ability is the creation of life; although it was originally used to allow plant life to grow despite the lack of natural sunlight in Khaenri'ah, it would later become advanced enough to allow for the creation of much more complex beings. Its practice would later backfire on them, however, and contribute to their downfall during the [[cataclysm]].

[[Albedo]] learned the Art of Khemia from his master, [[Rhinedottir]], and brought his practice with him to Mondstadt, hoping to use it to discover "the truth of this world".<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Rumored Alchemist}}</ref> [[Sucrose]] and [[Timaeus]] are his assistants.

Besides the ability to create synthetic lifeforms, the Art of Khemia can also be used to produce rather ordinary objects such as chairs, replacing the manufacturing process in order to obtain a finished product.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Shadows Deepen}}</ref>

==Liyue==
===Adepti Arts===
The adepti arts are techniques primarily practiced by the [[adepti]], which were taught to them by [[Morax|Rex Lapis]].<ref name="TeapotI">{{Ref/Quest|A Teapot to Call Home: Part I}}</ref> Besides the ability to naturally control the elements, the adepti are able to use their adeptal power for various purposes.
====Alchemy====
{{Lang|Alchemy|zh=丹鼎|zh_rm=Dāndǐng|zh_lit=Refinement of medical substances}} is used by the adepti to create [[elixirs]]. However, the power contained within these elixirs is lethal to those who are not adepti.<ref name="MVME">{{Ref/Item|Mist Veiled Mercury Elixir}}</ref> They are known to give weapons transcendent powers.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Mist Veiled Gold Elixir}}</ref>

====Sigils====
{{Lang|Sigils|zh=符箓|zh_rm=Fúlù}} are able to store adeptal power.<ref name="MVME" /> They typically take the form of paper talismans. The talismans attached to [[Qiqi]]'s clothes are one such example; without them, the adeptal power within her body would cause her to go berserk.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Qiqi|5}}</ref>

Another variation are the {{Lang|Sigils of Permission|zh=百无禁忌箓|zh_rm=Bǎiwújìnjì Lù|zh_tl=Talisman of Nonrestriction}} created by [[Morax|Rex Lapis]]. These allowed mortals to channel adeptal power, and [[Starsnatcher]] was capable of using one to exorcise evil spirits.

====Sub-Space Creation====
{{Lang|Sub-Space Creation|zh=外景|zh_rm=Wàijǐng|zh_lit=Outdoor Scene}} is ability to create a small pocket dimension, typically for the purpose of creating an abode for the adeptus to reside in. Examples of such creations include Madame Ping's [[Inside the Teapot|teapot]] and the [[Serenitea Pot]]. Sub-Space Creation is considered to be inferior to Rex Lapis' ability to literally move mountains and seas.<ref name="TeapotI" />

The adepti are also capable of creating Teapot Spirits to serve as "butlers" for their abodes, guarding them and managing their affairs.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Teapot to Call Home: Part II}}</ref> These spirits are also given adeptus names.

====Dream Trawler====
Also referred to as the "giving and receiving of dreams." Allows the user to enter another person's dream, or grant others a dream of the user's design.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Purging of Evil}}</ref> Known practitioners include [[Rex Lapis]] and [[Xiao]].

====Mortal Lingering====
Allows the user to temporarily take on a physical human form, even after the death of their original body.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Insights of Drifting Dreams}}</ref> Used by [[Pervases]].

====Nuo Dance of Evil Conquering====
Only known to be utilized by [[yaksha]]s. Utilizes the power of the yaksha mask to imbue its wearer with enough strength to subdue a god's might, but inflicts great suffering on its wearer in exchange.

===Exorcism===
{{See also|Exorcist}}
Little is currently known about the practice of exorcism in Liyue beyond the fact that its practitioners supposedly drive away demons. Based on [[Chongyun]]'s techniques and idle animations, exorcist arts are derived from the adepti arts.

=== Fantastic Compass ===
{{See also|Fantastic Compass}}
A catalyst created by the adeptus [[Sea Gazer]] to seal away monsters. When activated by an adeptus and a mortal in unison, it is said that "one can move the heavens and shake the earth".<ref>{{Ref/Quest|At Tunnel's End, Light}}</ref> It is known to have been used by the following:<br />
* Sea Gazer and an unnamed thaumaturge<ref>Video description of [https://youtu.be/C24nvloZZhE Perilous Trail Event Cutscene Animation: "Moment of Life or Death" | Genshin Impact]</ref>
* [[Bosacius]] and [[Boyang]]
* [[Yanfei]] (activated briefly; half-adeptus)
* [[Xiao]] and [[Yelan]]

===Parametric Transformer===
{{Main|Parametric Transformer}}
This mysterious device, powered by elemental energy, is capable of taking items and "transmuting" them into different items. Little is known about how it works or where it came from besides the fact that it was found in the [[Dunyu Ruins]].

==Inazuma==
===Bake-danuki Magic===
The [[Bake-Danuki|bake-danuki]] of Inazuma are tanuki that possess knowledge of mystical arts, and are especially known for their ability to transform into humans and other objects.<ref>{{Ref/Wildlife|Bake-Danuki}}</ref>

The bake-danuki [[Kichiboushi]] demonstrated a trick he calls {{Lang|"Eight tatami Kapow"|ja=八畳ぽんぽこ|ja_tl=Eight tatami Ponpoko}}, whereby he created an "airbag" that allowed him to float using the chilling winds of Dragonspine.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas: Snowswept Fairytale}}</ref>

===Onmyoudou===
{{Lang|Onmyoudou|ja=陰陽道|ja_tl=The Way of Yin and Yang}} is the name of the Kamuna art created by [[Kamuna Harunosuke]] during the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago. It was the result of Harunosuke combining techniques of the [[Liyue]] [[adepti]] arts with the "art of transcension",<ref name="Obsessions">{{Ref/Quest|Away With Obsessions and Falsehood}}</ref> which he learned while training under the [[Yougou Tengu]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Narukami Trail}}</ref><ref name="EchoesOfExtintion">Event [[Labyrinth Warriors]], Stage 4: [[Labyrinth Warriors/The Echoes of Extinction|The Echoes of Extinction]]</ref>

For the most part, the art of onmyoudou has been lost to time, although not completely. A legend from Inazuma says that there are magical shikigami that can follow their masters around and that they can even be used to banish evil, among other things.<ref name="LWQ1">{{Ref/Quest|A Tricky Situation}}</ref> Additionally, the [[Kairagi]], former samurai, are capable of using shikifuda to infuse their swords with elemental energy without the need of a [[Vision]].<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Kairagi: Dancing Thunder}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Kairagi: Fiery Might}}</ref>

====Shikigami and Shikifuda ====
The art of onmyoudou primarily involves the use of charm magic via shikigami and shikifuda. Shikigami are paper cut-outs that are embued with magical powers; examples include [[Shiki Taishou]] and his many replicas, such as [[Shiki Koshou]]. Originally, samurai would combine the shikigami's charm magic with their own martial prowess to fight off monsters.<ref name="Obsessions" /> Shikifuda are paper seals, and they could be used during combat, similar to shikigami. These focus mainly on elemental powers.

====Mystic Onmyou Chamber====
The [[Mystic Onmyou Chamber]] was created by Harunosuke using onmyoudou. A complex [[Domains|Domain]] with many rooms that are capable of rearranging themselves,<ref name="LWQ1" /> where it originally served as a training ground for samurai who wanted to protect [[Inazuma]] from the evil forces of the cataclysm. Shikigami were used to create training targets in the form of mirror monsters. However, the Domain was eventually abandoned.<ref name="Obsessions" />

====Ubiquity Net====
The [[Ubiquity Net]] and the [[Omni-Ubiquity Net]] were created using Kamuna Onmyoudou, and are used to capture small animals.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/sgAvJlOL0Gg Version 2.3 Special Program]</ref><ref name="Bantan">{{Ref/Quest|Bantan Sango Case File: Mystery of the Black Shadow}}</ref> The standard Ubiquity Net, which was designed by [[Sango]] and constructed by [[Wakamurasaki]], was used by the [[Traveler]] to retrieve missing animals during a [[Bantan Sango Case Files: The Warrior Dog|Bantan Sango investigation]].<ref name="Bantan" /> The Omni-Ubiquity Net is Wakamurasaki's enhanced modification of the original net, which is able to detain the essence of living creatures and recreate them using the Serenitea Pot or other suitable media.<ref name="NetQuest">{{Ref/Quest|Omni-Ubiquity Net (Quest)}}</ref> The Ubiquity Net was originally designed to be used by [[Ryuuji]], with the goal of being able to capture criminals and thus recreate their human essences, but neither of the two nets have any effect on humans.<ref name="Bantan" /><ref name="NetQuest" /><ref>{{Ref/Loading|Omni-Ubiquity Net}}</ref>

===Tengu Arts===
Little is known about the tengu arts apart from the art of transcension, which is notable for being used in the creation of onmyoudou.<ref name="Obsessions" /><ref name="EchoesOfExtintion" />
