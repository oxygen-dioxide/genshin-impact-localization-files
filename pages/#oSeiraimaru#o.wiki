==Puzzles==
===Ship Ruins===
Exploring the wreckage of "Seiraimaru" is a multi-part series of puzzles.

====Entering the Ship====
#Approach the four wheels next to the mast with the [[Electroculus]]. The Tattered Notes next to them give a hint as to what to do.
#Rotate the wheels so that the "sword" on the wheel (the single-pointed part) faces the "halberd" (three-pointed) on the wheels above and to the side of it.
#After doing so, an entrance to the ship's interior will open up. This entrance is located on the side of the ship close to the [[Thunder Sakura Bough]].

====Unlocking the First Door====
#Follow the [[Seelie]] found in the ship hull.
#Find the [[Rust-Worn Key]] and complete the wheel puzzle like the previous step. This unlocks the Exquisite Chest.

====Unlocking the Second Door====
#Continue to follow the Seelie.
#Find the [[Intact Key]] and complete the wheel puzzle like the previous step. This unlocks the Luxurious Chest and awards the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement, "[[Davy Jones' Locker]]".
#Continue following the Seelie to another Electroculus and its Seelie Court.

In its remains, marked by starlit tears, one can still vaguely see the image of a vessel proudly sailing, blessed by the shrine maidens and villagers of a bygone age.|Viewpoint, [[Viewpoint/The Stranded Flagship|The Stranded Flagship]]}}
