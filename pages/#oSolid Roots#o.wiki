|description    = A potted plant with a spacious container and a hardy, vibrant green plant as its main feature, found within the [[Flower-Feather Clan]]. It is said that due to the society's location atop the towering branches of [[Quahuacan Cliff]], the area is frequently swept by strong mountain winds. Only plants with well-developed and stable root systems can thrive in such an environment. For this reason, the people of the Flower-Feather Clan select larger pots to allow for ample root growth. This practice is also used by flying instructors as a metaphor, reminding students to build a strong foundation in their training, for only with solid roots can one soar through storms.
