'''Hyakkiyakou''' is a gathering of the [[youkai]] that occurred a long time ago but is no longer conducted.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Yae Miko|4}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Centuries-Long Dream}}</ref> Everyone would have plenty to drink, and they would soar into the sky and cover it with their powers. There were so many youkai that their silhouettes would block out the moon.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Banquet of Parting}}</ref>

Nowadays, youkai memories that leak from the [[Ley Lines]] are weak and they are no longer able to fly, so [[Yae Miko]] performed a convocation ritual for them, gathering all the wandering memories together in one place.

==Trivia==
* This quest references the {{w|Hyakki Yagyō}}, the "Night Parade of One Hundred Demons" where ghosts and demons are said to parade through the streets at night.
