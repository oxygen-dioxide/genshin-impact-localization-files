{{Lang|'''Hu Tao'''{{Name Order|Chinese}}|zh=胡桃|zh_rm=Hú Táo}} is a playable [[Pyro]] [[character]] in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''.

===Gameplay Notes===
* Hu Tao has a unique [[sprint]] that allows her to briefly pass through smaller enemies. This only applies to the initial sprint and does not apply to the continuous run.
** Visually, Hu Tao disappears, and butterflies appear. These butterflies are normally white and turn red if she is in the [[Paramita Papilio]] state.
