==Text==
[[File:Autumn's Regrets Map.png|300px]]

[[Morticia|Autumn]] had no faith she stuck to when she was alive, and presumably no last messages the day she died.<br>
She once danced like a puppet amidst sweet lies.<br>
When she woke up, the most precious thing in her life, [[Molli|her daughter]], had been taken.<br>
Autumn wanted nothing more than a perfect world for her daughter to live in and dedicated everything to make it so.

If you understand the pain a mother can feel, you who are reading this note,<br>
And if you are willing to grant a mother's wish to protect her daughter,<br>
{{color|buzzword|Please go to the shelter in the center of the lake and take what she has left for you.}} Your kindness deserves her trust.
