'''Content Creators''' (CCs) for ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' are members of the ''Genshin Impact'' community that are recognized by [[HoYoverse]] to provide ''Genshin''-related content for the community. There are two separate but related programs, one for the [[HoYoLAB]] forum and one for the ''Genshin Impact'' Discord.

==HoYoLAB==
HoYoLAB Content Creators are users that regularly post high-quality content like guides or fanart onto the HoYoLAB forums.

==Discords==
