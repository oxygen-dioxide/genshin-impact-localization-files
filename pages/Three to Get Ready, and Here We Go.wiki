* During the cook-off:

** If the player leaves the area or if Smiley Yanxiao reaches 100% first, then the player will need to talk to Xiangling again to restart the cook-off.
** After lighting the stove, the on-field character is restricted to only Xiangling, but the player can cook with any character as usual.
** Guoba will stand and wave at the seasoning that Xiangling should pick for her next dish.
** If the wrong seasoning is selected, Guoba will tilt his head, but nothing else changes in the quest.

{{Quest Description|With the finals looming, you and [[Paimon]] go to [[Wanmin Restaurant]] to look for [[Xiangling]]...<br /><br />After some testing, Xiangling modifies the dish she is making for the contest based on everyone's suggestions. The curtain is about to rise on the most riveting iteration of the [[Moonchase Festival]]'s Masterful Chefs competition, and an ancient tale related to the contest is also beginning to surface...}}
===Wanmin Restaurant===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach Wanmin Restaurant)
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey Xiangling, we're here!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 1 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Traveler, Paimon! Did you hear the news? I made it through the selections for Masterful Chefs!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really!? Woohoo, that's great!
:{{DIcon}} I knew you could do it.
:{{DIcon}} You're in a league of your own, Xiangling.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 1 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hee-hee, it was a total breeze, I wasn't even trying... Uh, but a true champion never rests on their laurels! I'm still gonna need your help to prepare for the competition.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 1 xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I made a few new test dishes and I was hoping everyone could try them and give some feedback. Traveler, you wanna be the first?
:{{DIcon}} What a shame, we just ate.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... oh, yeah, we did! And anyway, we get to eat your food all the time, so we're biased. You should find some other people this time, just to play it safe.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 1 xiangling 04.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Good idea! Okay lemme think, mmm... Ah, let's get Beidou to try it first.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Beidou! Yup, you can definitely trust her opinion! Let's go find her.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 1 xiangling 05.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Right now, she should be down at the docks. Lemme box up this food real quick, then we can head on down.
{{Dialogue end}}

===The Wharf===
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach Beidou and [[Xinyan]])
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Beidou ahoy! Hey look, who's she with?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hi Beidou, hi Xinyan. Are we interrupting anything?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 beidou 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Xiangling? The woman of the hour, we were just talking about you.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 xinyan 01.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Beidou was sayin' you and I should get ourselves on board some time. Says the whole crew's been asking for us, haha!
:{{Introductory Note|character=Xinyan|guaranteed=yes}}
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seems like you three go way back.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Oh, we really do! Beidou and Xinyan are two of my oldest customers, and I've helped out in the kitchen on board Beidou's ship in the past. Recently, Xinyan's been planning to do a show aboard, too!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 xinyan 02.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' That's the plan, good music's meant for sharing! You guys should check it out sometime!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Will do! But I came here today because I made it into the Masterful Chefs finals, and I was just trying out some new dishes to bring to the competition. Can you have a little taste and gimme some feedback?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 beidou 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Sure, beats drinking on an empty stomach.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 xinyan 03.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' 'Bout time, I'm starvin' over here! Let's see what you got.

:'''Beidou and Xinyan try Xiangling's dish...'''

:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 xinyan 04.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Aw man! This Chicken Foo Yung is tasting awesome!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 beidou 03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' This food is too good for me to be soaking up the alcohol with, haha.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' These three seem to have a great time with each other.
:{{DIcon}} Those are the kinds of friends you want in life.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 beidou 04.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Only thing is, you've got three dishes here, Chicken Foo Yung, Come and Get It, and Crystal Shrimp, and they all taste kinda refreshing.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... is refreshing really a flavor?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 beidou 05.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' When you spend all your time at sea, you don't have a lot of choice when it comes to food. Especially on the longer voyages, where you've gotta stretch your rations out as far as you can.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 beidou 06.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' The first thing you wanna do when you get back on dry land is dig into a nice hot meal that's swimming in oil and has a ton of flavor.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's the exact opposite of [[Ningguang]]'s tastes!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 xinyan 05.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Sure is! Beidou's tastes are pretty similar to mine and Xiangling's.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 beidou 07.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Ugh, Ningguang... I am sick of hearing that name.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 beidou 08.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Our tastes couldn't be more different. You'll never find us eating the same bowl of food.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But last time when you were chatting with her, Paimon thought you two seemed to get along just fine.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 beidou 09.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' We're evenly matched. Guess that makes us equals. But I'm sorry, limp cabbage leaves are never gonna do it for me.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 xinyan 06.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' I hear ya, I hear ya! Steamed Cabbage in Broth might be upper class and look fancy and all, but man, is it boring! It's never gonna give you that flavor explosion you get with some of the other dishes out there.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 xiangling 04.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' So, Xinyan, are these dishes too mild for you, too?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 xinyan 07.ogg}} '''{{Sic|Xiangling <!-- The voice is that of Xinyan -->|hide=1}}:''' Not so much mild... I just think you maybe missed a beat somewhere.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 beidou 10.ogg}} '''Beidou:'''  Exactly. This is some fine cooking, no question about that. But if this is for a competition, it needs more oomph.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Beat? Oomph? Are we sure these terms apply to cooking?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 xiangling 05.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Beat... and oomph...
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 xinyan 08.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Beat, yeah. You know what a beat is. I only know music though, I'm nowhere near your level when it comes to cooking. So don't mind me if it doesn't make much sense!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 xiangling 06.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' No, no, you're both completely right. Beat and oomph! That's what I need!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 xiangling 07.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I actually thought as much while I was cooking them, even though this was a brand-new combination, it still felt like I was missing that one thing that'll seal the deal... y'know, really push it over the finish line!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seems like she's found her muse. Does that mean... music theory is compatible with cooking?
:{{DIcon}} Every bit as compatible as we are.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! ...Paimon didn't quite get the implication, but Paimon can tell when you're being a meanie!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 xiangling 08.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Okay, I think I know what I need to do.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! So this went really well!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 xinyan 09.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Don't hold back, just get out there and do your thing! You're a pro, Xiangling, and you've totally got this. Hands down, best chef in Liyue Harbor! Ain't that right, Beidou?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 beidou 11.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Well, I think so, anyway. More than any other chef. And there ain't a whole lot of people that I'd be willing to say that about.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 xiangling 09.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hee-hee, I'll do my best! Thanks, everyone!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 beidou 12.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Alright, we'll leave you to it. I'm gonna take Xinyan on board for a while.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Xiangling, they both had pretty strong tastes. You sure that won't be a problem? Shouldn't we get a second opinion from someone with milder tastes?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 xiangling 10.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' That's a good point. Beidou likes her greasy stir-fries, and Xinyan can really handle her spice... Yeah, we should get another opinion.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Now, who do we know whose tastes are on the mild side? Traveler, any suggestions?
:{{DIcon}} A certain person comes to mind again...
:{{DIcon}} Yep, I've thought of someone with mild tastes.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who, who, who?
:{{DIcon}} You know, Almond Tofu...
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, right! Makes sense. So, back to Wangshu Inn?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 xiangling 11.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Who? Who is it?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Someone you just missed last time we were there!
:{{DIcon}} We don't need to go to Wangshu Inn.
:{{DIcon}} We can do it right here.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ....Huh?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Paimon remembers! He said that we just need to speak his name, and poof, he'll show up.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 2 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um... will he definitely hear us saying his name though? Maybe we should find somewhere quieter.
----
;(Approach the quieter area)
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, let's take turns shouting his name!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Huh? Do I need to do this, too?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's going first! *clears throat*
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Xiaaaao!!!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Um, nothing's happening...
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Lemme try again. Xiaaaao!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's weird... Does he not wanna hang out with us?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Wait, so let me get this straight. Some guy with special powers promised you both that you just need to shout his name, and he'll show up?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, well... not "both," actually. Just one of us...
:{{DIcon}} He promised it to me.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiangling 04.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Oh, right. Well, you should be the one to try it then. Paimon clearly just doesn't want to feel left out.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wah... Okay then...
:{{DIcon}} ...
::{{DIcon}} [[Xiao]], you there?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiao 01.ogg}} '''???:''' You called?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiangling 05.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Whoa!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He actually came!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' You spoke my name, did you not?
:{{DIcon}} I didn't think that would actually work...
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' When I make you a promise, I will honor it.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Blink of an eye, and poof, he's there! That's how you know he's an [[adeptus]]...
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiangling 06.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' An adeptus!? Uhh... Xiao, was it? Hi there, it was me who asked the Traveler to call you here. My name's Xiangling. I'm a chef.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiangling 07.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I've made it into the finals of this year's Masterful Chefs, and I'm testing some dishes out in preparation. I'm trying to get feedback from customers with all different tastes.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Customers... and that includes me?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiangling 08.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Uh-huh! The Traveler says you prefer mild food &mdash; just the kind of person I'm looking for. If you don't mind, I'd like you to try the dishes I've made and tell me your thoughts.
:{{DIcon}} Please help Xiangling out.
:{{DIcon}} We value your opinion, Xiao.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Since it's you... I will do it.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiangling 09.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Yay!

:'''Xiao tries Xiangling's dish...'''

:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiao 07.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, how is it? Are you sure you can eat it? Don't force yourself!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiao 08.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Tastes pretty good.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiangling 10.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Huh? R&mdash;Really?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiangling 11.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I can't believe it, an adeptus said he likes my cooking... If my dad was here, he'd be crying tears of joy!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiao 09.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' You excel in the culinary arts. I'm reminded of another chef I know.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiao 10.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' That chef cooks dishes with soul, as do you. Both of you are masters of your craft.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who do you think he means? Smiley Yanxiao?
:{{DIcon}} It has to be Yanxiao!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiao 11.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' If I had to find fault with something... the two sides are a little strong for my taste. Some minor adjustments would take this dish from excellence to perfection.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiao 12.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Just my own opinion... do not fixate on it. Take it or leave it as you see fit.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiangling 12.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Alright, go easy on the sides... okay, I got it.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiangling 13.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Thank you, adeptus friend! It was really great to meet you!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiao 13.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I'll be leaving now.
:{{DIcon}} Thank you.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiao 14.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' See you next time.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon still can't believe he actually came!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So what would happen if we called his name again now? Do you think he'd come back right away?
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, we're not doing that.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Only kinda, maybe, not really, joking, geez...
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiangling 14.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Good news! After two rounds of taste-testing, I've had an idea on what to do next!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 paimon 16.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Great! Lucky we picked the right people to talk to.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiangling 15.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I'd better head back and try this out a few times while it's fresh in my mind. Thanks for your help!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiangling 16.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Oh, and the final is in Yujing Terrace. You'd better come and watch!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Will do. Good luck!
:{{DIcon}} You'll do great!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 3 xiangling 17.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hee-hee, you bet!

;(If player needs to obtain recipes for [[Jueyun Chili Chicken]], [[Triple-Layered Consommé]], and/or [[Crystal Shrimp]])
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure hope Xiangling's preparation is going smoothly. Why don't we go and see how she's getting along?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seems like she's in the zone... talking away to herself...
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 5 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hmm, Jueyun Chili Chicken, Triple-Layered Consommé, Crystal Shrimp...
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are those the dishes she's gonna cook? Mmmm... Okay, now Paimon's hungry. One of each please! Get cooking, (Traveler)!
:{{DIcon}} Alright, sure...
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, can you actually cook all of those? Or is Paimon just assuming that because we eat them all the time? Hehe...
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How about we see if they sell recipes around here?

;(Purchase any needed recipes from Chef Mao at Wanmin Restaurant and open the inventory to learn them)

:{{A|vo eqzyj002 8 yanfei 17.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' And I, for my part, promise to uphold the principles of fairness, impartiality, and transparency in my officiation of the proceedings.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 8 yanfei 18.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Now, I will hand things over to the select panel judge, Ningguang, for the announcement of today's theme!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 8 ningguang 01.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Thank you all for being here today at the Masterful Chefs finals. I am the Tianquan, Ningguang.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 8 ningguang 02.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' The organizers have chosen the theme for today's event, and that theme is: "Of Earth and Water Born."
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 8 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Of Earth and Water Born"... Just like "Feast of the Bounteous Land," it really captures the spirit of this year's Moonchase Festival.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 8 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's like surf and turf, but the deep and meaningful version.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 8 ningguang 03.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' The rules are simple &mdash; the one who receives the most votes, wins. Tailor your dishes to the judges' preferences or win over the audience with your originality. The choice is yours.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 8 ningguang 04.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Well then. I look forward to both of your contributions.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 8 yanfei 19.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Contestants will have one hour of cooking time available, and may only use ingredients provided by the organizers in their dishes. I trust this is no problem.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 8 yanfei 20.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Okay! Without further ado, let the cooking commence! Begin!

:{{A|vo eqzyj002 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Time to pull out all the stops! Show everyone why you're the best!

:{{A|vo eqzyj002 9 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hee-hee... Thanks for coming to support me! Don't you worry, I'm gonna make this the best-tasting dish I ever cooked!

;(Talk to Ningguang during the cookoff)
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj002 ningguang 01.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' We have two extraordinary talents this year. I'm interested to see their choice of dishes.

;(Talk to [[Uncle Tian]] during the cookoff)
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj002 uncletian 01.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' Hehe, what an exciting competition this is.

;(Talk to [[Yanfei]] during the cookoff)
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj002 yanfei 01.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' In the interest of keeping everything fair and above-board, please refrain from talking with the host while the competition is in progress.

;(Talk to Smiley Yanxiao during the cookoff)
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj002 yanxiao 01.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Uhh... I&mdash;I... *sigh* What am I going to do...

;(Talk to Keqing during the cookoff)
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj002 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I look forward to both of your dishes.

;(After lighting the fire)
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 11 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Xiao thought the sides should be milder, which makes sense to contrast with the main dish. I guess that's kinda what Xinyan meant &mdash; you gotta have on beats and off beats... hmm, but at the same time, you have to end on a high note. So I think I'll add a little sugar to the Crystal Shrimp, just to bring the flavor up a notch.

;(After making the Delicious Crystal Shrimp)
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 12 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Triple-Layered Consommé is pretty bland to begin with. I can't have two sides with the same texture... luckily the organizers have provided some very aromatic broth, it's just a little too gentle... Okay, this is where Beidou was right &mdash; a pinch of salt should do the trick!

;(After making the Delicious Triple-Layered Consommé)
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 13 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Jueyun Chili Chicken is the main event. Can't afford to compromise too much here, but maybe some Pepper will set it apart without alienating anybody.

;(After making the Delicious Jueyun Chili Chicken)
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 14 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Huh? Oh, Yanxiao... he doesn't look so good...
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 14 gooba 01.ogg}} '''Guoba:''' ♪~♪~
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 14 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Ah! Guoba!
----
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanfei 01.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Whoa, whoa, what's this? Hold up, things are taking an unexpected turn on the Masterful Chefs stage!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanfei 02.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Xiangling's mysterious assistant appears to be aiding her opponent! Judges &mdash; are we going to allow this?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanfei 03.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' We knew in advance that Xiangling would be accompanied by a mysterious assistant, and the judges agreed that the two could be classed as one individual for the purposes of the competition. But what do we say to this!?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 ningguang 01.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I take no issue with it. In any case, the assistant hasn't done much in the way of assisting.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 uncletian 01.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' Haha... no competition would be complete without a little drama. All part of being young. I won't be the old fogey that ruins it for them.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 keqing 01.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Ahem... please allow me to explain to our host.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 keqing 02.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Prior to the competition, the judges reviewed both contestants, and we can comfortably confirm that neither side is participating in a way that contravenes the competition rules.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 keqing 03.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Xiangling is a highly accomplished chef, and her "assistant" is more like family to her.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 keqing 04.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Xiangling prepares all of her own dishes herself. All that her assistant will do is occasionally provide a fire source. Given Xiangling's level of culinary skill, the difference between her using firewood or her assistant is a trivial one.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 keqing 05.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' I appreciate everyone's concerns. The presence of a mysterious assistant performing strange dance moves to cheerlead for Xiangling is a little unexpected.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 keqing 06.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' But the mysterious assistant has now started cheerleading for Smiley Yanxiao too, demonstrating total impartiality. By encouraging both Xiangling and her opponent, they have proven to be a fair supporter.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' That's right! Guoba's not really outside help &mdash; Guoba just likes to watch people cook! I'm sure the only reason they went over there is to try and help Yanxiao feel less nervous.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I give you all my word, Guoba will not interfere with the competition. And I would also say that it's a loss to the competition if Yanxiao isn't at the top of his form!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I say that as someone who's eaten Yanxiao's cooking at Wangshu Inn before. He's an excellent chef, and I want this to be a competition between the best we both have to bring.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 ningguang 02.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I see... most amusing. Uncle Tian, what's your opinion?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 uncletian 02.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' I have no objections. It's an honor and a privilege to see two contestants so dedicated to having a fair and square contest.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanfei 04.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' The judges and the officiator accept this explanation! Let the competition continue!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 xiangling 04.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Yanxiao, are you alright?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanxiao 01.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' I don't know what's wrong with me, I've never been so nervous in my life! ...Ugh, look, my hands won't stop shaking...
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 xiangling 05.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Take it easy! I've been there before, I can help! Trying say a tongue-twister to yourself in your head, or... think of some happy memories about your dad!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanxiao 02.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Why my dad? That's a bit specific...
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 xiangling 06.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' 'Cause that's what I do.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 gooba 01.ogg}} '''Guoba:''' ♪~♪~
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanxiao 03.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Uh... I guess I'll think of my mom, then. A&mdash;Anyway, you should carry on! I'll be fine. Don't hold up your own dishes on my account.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 xiangling 07.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Nothing's being held up. I'm finished already.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanxiao 04.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Huh!? Right, then I need to focus up and win this thing!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 xiangling 08.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' There you go, that's the attitude we want! You're a very capable chef, Yanxiao. So come on, show everyone what you're made of &mdash; just like you showed us last time at Wangshu Inn!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanxiao 05.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Yes... you're right, I can do this. I can do this!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanxiao 06.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Thank you, Xiangling, and thanks to your, um... well, thanks. Time for me to get cooking!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 gooba 02.ogg}} '''Guoba:''' ♪!

:'''Smiley Yanxiao starts cooking immediately, and his dish is ready in a flash...'''

:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanfei 05.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Time's up!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanfei 06.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Both contestants have now finished cooking. I would like to invite them to present their dishes to the judges for evaluation.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanfei 07.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' We will proceed in the order that the contestants finished. Xiangling &mdash; please describe your dish!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 xiangling 09.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' My dish is:
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 xiangling 10.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Jueyun Chili Chicken with sides of Triple-Layered Consommé and Crystal Shrimp.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 xiangling 11.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' The theme is "Of Earth and Water Born," which includes land and sea. In other words, land animals, fowl, and seafood are all potential ingredients.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 xiangling 12.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' My main dish, Jueyun Chili Chicken, is a combination of Fowl and chilis. Jueyun Chilis capture the essence of the mountains where they grow, and Fowl is a gift from the heavens.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 xiangling 13.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Triple-Layered Consommé also uses Fowl, and its other ingredients are Ham and Bamboo Shoots. These are also flavors from the mountains, but they complement and contrast with the chicken dish &mdash; fresh instead of spicy, cold instead of hot.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 xiangling 14.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' The Crystal Shrimp is made from a combination of Rice, Shrimp Meat, and Carrot. A thin, translucent skin wraps diced Carrot and a whole shrimp. Fresh, crispy, and tender.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 xiangling 15.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Shrimps are a gift from the ocean. Tightly wrapping them in a skin made from rice makes this dish a blend of land and sea, fresh with a hint of sweetness. It's the perfect note to end this course on.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanfei 08.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' A strong delivery there from Xiangling. Let's see what our next contestant, Yanxiao, has to say!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanxiao 07.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' My dish is...
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanxiao 08.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Adeptus' Temptation with a Mint Salad and Golden Shrimp Balls.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanxiao 09.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' As Xiangling says, earth and water means land and sea. So birds, land animals, and seafood were also the ingredients I incorporated.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanxiao 10.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Adeptus' Temptation is a much-loved dish in Liyue, and as chef of Wangshu Inn, I've always been proud to offer this as the signature specialty dish of our menu.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanxiao 11.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' It's a complex dish with very particular ingredients: smoked Ham, Crab, fresh Shrimp Meat, and Matsutake. I chose this as my main dish, as a sign of respect toward my profession and to this competition.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanxiao 12.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' The Mint Salad is my first side. Cool and tender with a subtle sweetness, it's a perfect answer to the rich and strong flavors of the Adeptus' Temptation.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanxiao 13.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' Golden Shrimp Balls is a time-honored classic loved by everyone. A hearty and wholesome broth followed up with a shrimp ball, hehe... Pure bliss!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mmmm~! Paimon can smell it from all the way over here! It's driving Paimon crazy...
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanfei 09.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Judges, please sample the dishes!

:'''The three onstage judges try the two contestant's dishes separately...'''

:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 keqing 07.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Very impressive. Both contestants' dishes are well-considered, expertly made, and truly delicious. I'm gonna have another Golden Shrimp Ba&mdash; um, I mean, I shall have to sample both contestants' dishes once more before I can reach a verdict.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 uncletian 03.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' Now, Xiangling has taken an interesting approach here: She's chosen a cold dish as her main. I have to say, that's a bold move.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 uncletian 04.ogg}} '''Uncle Tian:''' It's also a unique take on Jueyun Chili Chicken. Although the dish as a whole is served cold, the chili peppers have been stir-fried and so they're still just a little warm on the inside. You get a nice crunch as you bite in, then you get the spiciness and warmth all coming in together, and then just a hint of that wonderful pepperiness to top it all off... It's quite simply extraordinary!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 ningguang 03.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' This Adeptus' Temptation is quite exceptional. The Triple-Layered Consommé is also a very superlative contribution &mdash; excellent flavor, well-balanced between sweet and savory. Yes... the standard is very high.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanfei 10.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Judges of the select panel, I will now ask you to consider your votes carefully before writing them down and handing them to me!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanfei 11.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Also, the organizing committee has selected today's audience judges, and they are now evaluating the dishes. Everyone who's been lucky enough to sample today's dishes, please consider and cast your vote independently.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, how are we not involved in this!? Why didn't they pick us to be judges?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon has buckets of passion and oodles of expertise when it comes to food &mdash; if they don't want Paimon, it's their loss! Ohh...
:{{DIcon}} Calm down, Paimon. I'll cook the same dishes for you later.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yippy! For all the chefs there are in the world, and for all the amazing dishes they can cook, the fact remains that you're the one who treats Paimon best!

:'''The judges offstage sample the dishes carefully before casting their votes...'''

:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanfei 12.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Thank you all for waiting! All votes have been received and counted, and the results have been returned to Ningguang.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanfei 13.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' I now invite Ningguang to take the floor and announce the results of the Masterful Chefs finals!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 ningguang 04.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' It is my pleasure to announce that the winner of the Masterful Chefs finals is:

:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 xiangling 17.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Wow!!!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whaaaat!? How was it so close!
:{{DIcon}} Yanxiao is a great chef too.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanxiao 15.ogg}} '''Smiley Yanxiao:''' There it is... *sigh* I knew it.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanfei 14.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' It was a close contest, but we have a winner! Liyue Harbor's Xiangling has beaten Dihua Marsh's Yanxiao by just one vote!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanfei 15.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' There can only be one winner, but the fact that this was so close shows just how much both of these outstanding chefs managed to impress our judges. Thank you both for your stellar contributions here today!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 yanfei 16.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' A big thank you to all the audience for being here today, especially those who have come from far and wide. As officiator, I declare the result of this competition to be fair and valid, thus bringing the Masterful Chefs finals to a close!
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 15 ningguang 06.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Thank you all for coming. Until next time.

:{{A|vo eqzyj002 20 xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I didn't have a chance to fully explain before. In fact, when Master had filled in the missing parts of the recipe for me, I realized that I already knew how to make this dish.

:{{A|vo eqzyj002 20 keqing 09.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' About that... I do not believe that this recipe was my grandfather's creation.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 20 keqing 10.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' My grandfather was a well-known real estate tycoon in Liyue, and also a scholar. He was an avid collector of old books and was quite knowledgeable on many of Liyue's customs and traditions that are no longer practiced.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 20 keqing 11.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' As a child, I used to spend a lot of time with him in his study. We'd read the classics together, then debate how much of it was actually genuine, and whether Rex Lapis was real or not...
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 20 keqing 12.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' He used to say, "Books are just a bridge that bring us a little closer to history. It's up to those of us in later generations to ask these questions, search for the answers, and decide what they mean."
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 20 keqing 13.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Since then, my grandfather has passed on, and I've grown up to become a Qixing. My views on Rex Lapis have changed in this time, too, from myth to reality.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 20 keqing 14.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' For me, the name Rex Lapis is inextricably wound up with memories of my grandfather. Whenever I see his name written down, it always reminds me of sitting in my grandfather's study... seeing all of his notes.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 20 keqing 15.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' As I said earlier, this recipe came from those same notes. It's an ancient dish that he was trying to restore to its original form, but unfortunately, without the full recipe, he never quite succeeded.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 20 keqing 16.ogg}} '''Keqing:''' Still, each time he tried cooking it, he'd always get me to have a taste while it was still warm... ah, the memories. This really is the taste of my childhood.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 20 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ancient dish? Are cornbread buns really that old?
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 20 xiangling 05.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Well, at least in my family it is. My dad learned how to make it from his dad, and supposedly, it's been passed down that way for generations.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 20 xiangling 06.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' We call them Chili-Mince Cornbread Buns! They're a traditional folk-food snack, easy to pack up and take with you on the road, so they're the perfect thing to eat on the go.

:{{A|vo eqzyj002 20 xiangling 08.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' It was in a cave in the mountains! I ducked inside to get out of the rain and saw an offering table in there, so I put the Cornbread Buns I'd brought with me on it.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 20 xiangling 09.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Then I ended up falling asleep, and when I woke up, I found out that Guoba had eaten every last one. Guoba's followed me around ever since &mdash; we're practically family now.

:{{A|vo eqzyj002 23 madameping 03.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Hehe, in old age, the sight of many things puts one in a wistful mood. But children are always a beautiful sight to see.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 23 madameping 04.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Such exuberant life force. It seems to well up from deep within the land itself... a land that has been in existence for so many millennia, and yet one that still dazzles today.
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps that is what defines Liyue.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 23 madameping 05.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Traveler, this Moonchase Festival has been all the more entertaining with you here to witness it.
:{{A|vo eqzyj002 23 madameping 06.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' Now, let's have Xiangling brew us a nice pot of tea. We shall drink and chat at our leisure.
;(Quest ends)

;(Talk to Xiangling again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj002 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hmm, everyone's here to eat, what should I cook? Lemme think... I've got some Fowl and some Fish... and Shrimp Meat, so I can do two snack dishes... yes, and a few stir-fries!
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj002 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hee-hee, everyone's gonna love it.

;(Talk to Zhongli, Madame Ping, or Guoba again)
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj002 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The food at Wanmin Restaurant is excellent. I eat here often.
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj002 madameping 01.ogg}} '''Madame Ping:''' You can say that again... Xiangling is a remarkable child, surely the culinary talent of the century.
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj002 gooba 01.ogg}} '''Guoba:''' ♪~♪!
:{{A|vo dialog eqzyj002 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Indeed. To have mastered the craft at her age lends credence to the old aphorism that heroes are made young.

==Trivia==
*Towards the end of the ''Flavors of the World'' cutscene, [[Madame Ping]], [[Ganyu]], [[Ningguang]], and [[Keqing]] together recite the following {{w|Antithetical couplet|couplet}}; each line makes reference to another famous Chinese work:
**{{Lang|mini=1|zh={{Rubi|风|fēng|雨|yǔ|犹|yóu|祝|zhù}}，{{Rubi|山|shān|海|hǎi|同|tóng|欢|huān}}，{{Rubi|是|shì|承|chéng|天|tiān|地|dì|之|zhī|佑|yòu}}。|zh_tl=Nature provides, the mountains rejoice, we are blessed by heaven's good grace.}}
***This line is narrated by Madame Ping, that after thousands of years, Liyue is still peaceful and prosperous, this should be credited to the joint work of the heroic Liyue people.
***"{{Rubi|承|chéng|天|tiān|之|zhī|佑|yòu}}" is an idiom that means "be blessed by heaven's good grace." It is derived from the fourteenth hexagram ({{wt|䷍}}) in the {{Lang|''{{w|I Ching}}''|zh=周易}}, {{Lang|mini=1|zh={{Rubi|大|dà|有|yǒu}}|zh_tl=Great Possessing}}: {{Lang|mini=1|zh={{Rubi|上|shàng|九|jiǔ}}：{{Rubi|自|zì|天|tiān|佑|yòu|之|zhī}}，{{Rubi|吉|jí|无|wú|不|bú|利|lì}}。|zh_tl=Nine at the top means: / He is blessed by heaven. / Good fortune. / Nothing that does not further.}}<ref>Chinese Wikisource: [https://zh.wikisource.org/zh/%E5%91%A8%E6%98%93/%E5%A4%A7%E6%9C%89 {{Zh|周易/大有}}]</ref><ref>I Ching: [http://www2.unipr.it/~deyoung/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#14 Ta Yu / Possession in Great Measure]</ref>
**{{Lang|mini=1|zh={{Rubi|星|xīng|移|yí|斗|dǒu|转|zhuǎn}}，{{Rubi|沧|cāng|海|hǎi|桑|sāng|田|tián}}，{{Rubi|烟|yān|火|huǒ|人|rén|间|jiān|依|yī|旧|jiù}}。|zh_tl=Years have gone by, the world has transformed, but our way of life survives.}}
***This line is narrated by Ganyu, a half-adeptus who lived through the fall of the Guili Assembly, helped build Liyue Harbor, and has served as the Qixing secretary ever since. She is most keenly aware of Liyue's steadfastness in the face of changing times.
***{{Lang|mini=1|zh={{Rubi|沧|cāng|海|hǎi|桑|sāng|田|tián}}|zh_tl=The blue sea turned into mulberry fields}} is an oft-used idiom derived from {{Lang|''{{w|Shenxian Zhuan}}''|zh=神仙传|zh_tl=Biographies of the Deities and Immortals}}. It is a metaphor for the constant (and significant) change in life or in the world. It can be translated as the "vicissitudes of life" or "ups and downs of time."<ref>Wikipedia: {{w|Mulberry fields (idiom)}}</ref>
**{{Lang|mini=1|zh={{Rubi|功|gōng|名|míng|在|zài|我|wǒ}}，{{Rubi|百|bǎi|岁|suì|千|qiān|秋|qiū}}，{{Rubi|毋|wú|忘|wàng|秉|bǐng|烛|zhú|夜|yè|游|yóu}}。|zh_tl=Fame and fortune is only a season, it is the moment that we should embrace.}}
***This line is narrated by Ningguang; while she amassed an enormous fortune through her own wits and skills and became the Tianquan of the Qixing, she is also keenly aware that her both her title and her wealth are impermanent. It is instead her actions in the present moment that hold lasting meaning.
***{{Lang|mini=1|zh=秉烛夜游|zh_lit=Hold a candle and wander at night}} is derived from {{w|Li Bai}}'s famous poem, {{Lang|''Preface for a Spring Evening Banquet with Cousins in a Peach Plum Garden''|zh=春夜宴从弟桃花园序}}, which gives a rationale for ''carpe diem'' and living in the moment: {{Lang|mini=1|zh={{Rubi|而|ér|浮|fú|生|shēng|若|ruò|梦|mèng}}，{{Rubi|为|wèi|欢|huān|几|jǐ|何|hé}}？{{Rubi|古|gǔ|人|rén|秉|bǐng|烛|zhú|夜|yè|游|yóu}}，{{Rubi|良|liáng|有|yǒu|以|yǐ|也|yě}}。|zh_tl=In addition, the floating life is but a dream, so how much joy can we have at all? The ancients had good reason to hold candles and entertain themselves at night.}}<ref>Google Books: [https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Concise_History_of_Chinese_Literature/FOJ5DwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=Preface%20for%20a%20Spring%20Evening%20Banquet%20with%20Cousins%20in%20a%20Peach%20Plum%20Garden&pg=PA307&printsec=frontcover&bsq=Preface%20for%20a%20Spring%20Evening%20Banquet%20with%20Cousins%20in%20a%20Peach%20Plum%20Garden A Concise History of Chinese Literature]</ref> This idiom itself was derived from the fifteenth of the {{Lang|''{{w|Nineteen Old Poems}}''|zh=古诗十九首}}: {{Lang|mini=1|zh={{Rubi|昼|zhòu|短|duǎn|苦|kǔ|夜|yè|长|cháng}}，{{Rubi|何|hé|不|bù|秉|bǐng|烛|zhú|游|yóu}}|zh_tl=When days are short and the dull nights long, Why not take a lamp and wander forth?}}<ref>Wikisource: [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Hundred_and_Seventy_Chinese_Poems/Seventeen_Old_Poems A Hundred and Seventy Chinese Poems] (the poem in question is listed as No. 14 instead of No. 15.)</ref>
**{{Lang|mini=1|zh={{Rubi|今|jīn|古|gǔ|诸|zhū|事|shì}}，{{Rubi|激|jī|荡|dàng|中|zhōng|流|liú}}，{{Rubi|宏|hóng|图|tú|待|dài|看|kàn|新|xīn|秀|xiù}}。|zh_tl=Past meets present, heritage becomes legacy, long into the future may we thrive.}}
***This line is narrated by Keqing, who is considered the most forward-thinking and innovative of the Qixing. [[Zhongli]] admits that it is because of people like her, who take the initiative to do what they think is right, that he was willing to step down from his role as Archon.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Zhongli|About Keqing}}</ref>
***{{Lang|mini=1|zh={{Rubi|激|jī|荡|dàng|中|zhōng|流|liú}}|zh_lit=surging midstream}} is from {{w|Mao Zedong}}'s famous poem {{Lang|''Changsha''|zh=沁园春·长沙}}, extracted from {{Lang|mini=1|zh={{Rubi|曾|céng|记|jì|否|fǒu}}，{{Rubi|到|dào|中|zhōng|流|liú|击|jī|水|shuǐ}}，{{Rubi|浪|làng|遏|è|飞|fēi|舟|zhōu}}。|zh_tl=Remember still / How, venturing midstream, we struck the waters, / And waves stayed the speeding boats?}}<ref>Blogger: [https://poetmao.blogspot.com/2009/11/english-translation.html Qinyuan Chun: Changsha]</ref> The poem refers to the mood of youths going on an adventure and doing great deeds, changing the world through their actions and words.
* Marchosius' quote recited by Madame Ping to Guoba is also a couplet in the Chinese version:<br />{{Lang|mini=1|zh={{Rubi|说|shuō|小|xiǎo}}，{{Rubi|可|kě|取|qǔ|一|yì|捧|pěng|粟|sù|米|mǐ|尝|cháng}}，{{Rubi|汲|jí|石|shí|上|shàng|甘|gān|泉|quán|水|shuǐ}}；{{Rubi|说|shuō|大|dà}}，{{Rubi|可|kě|取|qǔ|一|yì|壶|hú|星|xīng|月|yuè|饮|yǐn}}，{{Rubi|行|xíng|千|qiān|年|nián|人|rén|间|jiān|路|lù}}。|zh_tl=A humble meal of maize and spring water is also profound in that, by ensuring one's survival, it paves the way for millennia of human history and culture to come.}}
