{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Tsuyuko:''' Oh, it's you! It's been a while!
:{{DIcon}} About Byakuyakoku...
:;(After [[The Still Water's Flow]])
::'''Tsuyuko:''' Enkanomiya's name was Byakuyakoku once upon a time. There was neither sun nor moon in that underground realm, and the only two astronomical phenomena being the Whitenight and the Evernight.
::'''Tsuyuko:''' One of my ancestors was a shrine maiden named [[Eboshi]]. She was a character of some significance in Byakuyakoku's history, and it is due to her that I am in charge of the [[Watatsumi Goryou Matsuri]].
:{{DIcon}} How have things been?
::'''Tsuyuko:''' How have what things been... Oh, you mean my work here?
::'''Tsuyuko:''' Well, we've been dealing with various issues for people whose livelihoods have been affected by the war... I doubt you'd be enthused to hear about such dry stuff.
::'''Tsuyuko:''' Nonetheless, I'm doing pretty alright. Thanks for your concern.
:{{DIcon}} So, about that whole Enkanomiya business...
:;(Before [[The Still Water's Flow]]. This was only available prior to version 2.4 before Enkanomiya was added in game){{Verify}}
::'''Tsuyuko:''' [[Sangonomiya Kokomi|Her Excellency the Divine Priestess]] has yet to authorize our request to open Enkanomiya. We'll just have to wait for her to make the call.
::'''Tsuyuko:''' In any case, our primary task right now is the restoration of the peoples' lives... More long term plans will have to wait for a while.
::'''Tsuyuko:''' Still, I can't say I'm not excited to find out what our ancestral lands deep beneath the ocean waves looks like.
::'''Tsuyuko:''' In any case, the conclusion of this matter was thanks to your help as well. Allow me to express our gratitude once again.
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Tsuyuko:''' See you. Watatsumi Island will always welcome you.
