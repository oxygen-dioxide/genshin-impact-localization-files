==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Alphonso)
:'''Alphonso:''' What should I do about my mission?
:{{DIcon}} (Let's uncover the "bad guy" in Vimara Village.)
:'''Paimon:''' Hello, Alphonso!
:'''Alphonso:''' It's you guys. (Traveler), what can I do for you? If you're looking for [[Rana]], she's gone already.
:{{DIcon}} I want to talk to you about something...
::{{DIcon}} The "bad guy" hiding in Vimara Village.
:'''Paimon:''' After all, Rana only felt relaxed enough to go on a journey after (Traveler) promised her to deal with the bad guy.
:'''Alphonso:''' I see. I understand now. Even though I don't have a clue, feel free to ask.
:{{DIcon}} First, let's recap what happened.
:'''Paimon:''' So, who was the first missing child in Vimara Village?
:{{DIcon}} [[Sudabeh]].
:;(Correct option)
:{{DIcon}} [[Kavus]].
::'''Alphonso:''' That should be Sudabeh.
:{{DIcon}} [[Iotham]].
::'''Paimon:''' No, Iotham was the last one that went missing.
::'''Alphonso:''' It's Sudabeh.
:{{DIcon}} Timmie.
::'''Paimon:''' Timmie? No, this has nothing to do with Timmie! Isn't he in Mondstadt?
::'''Alphonso:''' Who's Timmie? Sudabeh should be the first one that went missing, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon remembers now, it's Sudabeh! She heard that there were herbs that could improve Amadhiah's sight and then sneaked into the woods.
:'''Alphonso:''' That's right. We were worried when it happened and organized a search party.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon remembers now! Rana did say you organized the search party, and brought curry along too...
:{{DIcon}} Who told Sudabeh about the herbs?
:'''Alphonso:''' ...I did. Sudabeh is a good kid who cares about Amadhiah. I recall mentioning it to her one day, but I also said...
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, Paimon knows! She said you told her not to wander the forest alone. But she really cares about Amadhiah.
:'''Alphonso:''' Any other questions?
:'''Paimon:''' So, who was the second that went missing?
:{{DIcon}} Kavus.
:;(Correct option)
:{{DIcon}} Sudabeh.
::'''Paimon:''' No, no, didn't we just get done with Sudabeh? Paimon remembers it was her brother... Kavus, right?
:{{DIcon}} Iotham.
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't think that's right... We saved Iotham when he got lost. The second should be Sudabeh's big brother Kavus, right?
:{{DIcon}} Changchang.
::'''Paimon:''' Changchang is in Liyue! What's this got to do with Changchang!?
::'''Paimon:''' ...Are you okay, (Traveler)? Paimon remembers, the second kid was Sudabeh's big brother named Kavus, right?
:'''Alphonso:''' Kavus... He said he was going to see a "friend" in the forest for his missing sister.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah, he did mention that! Do you know who Kavus' friend is, Alphonso?
:'''Alphonso:''' ...
:'''Alphonso:''' How would I know? I didn't find Kavus or his friend in the woods. As you know, he came back suddenly not remembering anything, just like Sudabeh.
:'''Alphonso:''' Any other questions? No more children went missing after that.
:{{DIcon}} You got this, Paimon.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Okay. Ahem... Well, Iotham was supposed to go missing next, but we and Rana ran into him and brought him back.
:{{DIcon}} How did it happen exactly?
:'''Paimon:''' According to him, he heard Alphonso say there were huge mushrooms in a cave, so he wanted to get some for Rana.
:'''Paimon:''' Then the Fatui followed him. He got scared, ran, and ended up trapped in a Withering Zone...
:'''Alphonso:''' What, he went into a Withering Zone? How come he never told me that? That's unacceptable...!
:'''Alphonso:''' Wait, if he was in the Withering Zone, how did he make it back? I understand that you can master the elements without a Vision, but still...
:'''Paimon:''' (Uh, should we tell Alphonso about Arana?)
:{{DIcon}} (That should be fine.)
:{{DIcon}} (He ought to know.)
:'''Paimon:''' You'll probably find this hard to believe, Alphonso, but there are fairies called Aranara in the forest. Iotham and the gang are friends with them, so the Aranara helped him.
:'''Alphonso:''' Aranara...?
:'''Paimon:''' But going after the kids... the Fatui are so despicable!
:'''Alphonso:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, we still don't know who the bad guy hiding in Vimara Village is...
:{{DIcon}} I think someone's watching us over there, Paimon.
:'''Paimon:''' Where? Don't tell Paimon it's the bad guy we're looking for!
:{{DIcon}} Go check it out.
:'''Paimon:''' Just Paimon alone?
:{{DIcon}} Yell if you're in trouble and I'll be right there.
:{{DIcon}} You're small and can fly. Perfect for scouting.
:'''Paimon:''' Fine. Can't have (Traveler) do everything, anyway. Paimon's got this!

:'''Paimon leaves excitedly.'''

:'''Alphonso:''' Why bother?
:{{DIcon}} She'll be happier if she doesn't know.
:{{DIcon}} Some things are better left untold.
:'''Alphonso:''' Let's talk elsewhere.
----
;(Approach Alphonso at the designated location)
:'''Alphonso:''' When did you start suspecting me? Is it because Sudabeh and Iotham both mentioned me?
:{{DIcon}} You know my name.
::{{DIcon}} But Rana never told you my name.
:'''Alphonso:''' Or maybe I have great hearing and overheard your name when Rana introduced you to [[Amadhiah]].
:{{DIcon}} She never told Amadhiah that, either.
:'''Alphonso:''' How careless of me. But besides the [[Fatui]], the [[Adventurers' Guild]] also has an extensive network, so why don't you think I'm an adventurer?
:{{DIcon}} You seem to know me very well.
::{{DIcon}} You know I could control the elements without a Vision.
::'''Alphonso:''' You're quite famous for your exploits. I don't have to be a Fatuus to know that. The bottom line is, you don't have anything concrete to prove that I'm with them.
::{{DIcon}} True, but that's not important.
:{{DIcon}} You seem to know a lot about the Fatui.
::'''Alphonso:''' They are notorious, enough for most people to know that. The bottom line is, you don't have anything concrete to prove that I'm with them.
::{{DIcon}} True, but that's not important.
:'''Alphonso:''' You're right. Only the court demands proof, whereas a keen hound needs merely a scent to track the prey.
:'''Alphonso:''' Of course, a clever hound would avoid the scent it shouldn't sniff, as to not run into a dragon at the trail's end. But, from your track record, you're not one to quit.
:{{DIcon}} You warned Rana not to patrol the forest...
::{{DIcon}} Because you didn't want her to interfere with the Fatui.
:'''Alphonso:''' There's truth to that, but more importantly, I didn't want her to get hurt. The other Fatui aren't like me. They felt nothing toward her or Vimara Village.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you really, "Alphonso"?
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' The name given to me at birth is buried in freezing snow. The name granted me by the [[House of the Hearth]] is Trofin Snezhevich.
:{{DIcon}} Trofin Snezhevich of the House of the Hearth...
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' Your reaction tells me you probably encountered my "brothers and sisters" before.
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' Oh, don't tell me who you ran into or their status. Should they have revealed their identities to you...
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' Assuming they are still alive, then they would have betrayed [[Tsaritsa|Her Majesty]] already. If they're dead... I'd rather not know about it.
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' House of the Hearth is a shelter founded by "[[Arlecchino|The Knave]]." Children raised in the House aren't related, but our bonds are tighter than blood.
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' After coming of age, those with potential undergo training to become agents, then infiltrate different locations to await orders. Unfortunately, I was deemed as "having potential."
:{{DIcon}} What is your order?
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' Capture Aranara. It's an order from "[[Il Dottore|The Doctor]]," so that he can study the connections between [[Aranara]], dreams, and [[The Withering]].
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' Weaponizing dreams and The Withering seems to be one of his projects. Of course, I and every Fatuus you defeated are his "source of study."
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' We can't see Aranara, but Kavus, Sudabeh, and Iotham have what it takes to befriend them.
:{{DIcon}} So you let the Fatui abduct them to lure the Aranara out.
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' Correct, and the Aranara did show up. But their power truly was amazing, able to free those kids right under the nose of heavy security...
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' The Doctor has eyes on something truly incredible this time...
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' I've got a question for you too, (Traveler). Why would the Aranara erase the abduction and rescue from Kavus and Sudabeh's memory? To avoid being exposed?
:{{DIcon}} Arana doesn't want the children to remember anything like that at all.
::{{DIcon}} Arana doesn't want them to be violent when they grow up.
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' I see. So that Aranara is named Arana? That sounds a lot like Rana, a very pretty name. Please thank her on my behalf when you get a chance.
:{{DIcon}} Why would you thank her?
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' Vimara Village feels like a real home to me. Rana and Iotham feel like blood relatives I should've had. Kavus and Sudabeh are my precious siblings.
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' I hope they will grow up happy, healthy, righteous, and kind.
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' So, even though Arana has made my "job" that much more difficult, I appreciate what she did very much.
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' Oh, I finally get it. Just like you distracted Paimon, the children ought not to know the dirty deeds.
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' "Youngster, you should enjoy childhood, do what you like, see what you want to see. But also remember the dark days..."
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' That's the House's teachings. Because facing the darker side of life is inevitable for grown-ups, you need to be prepared as a child, so you can protect yourself and those you love.
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' Maybe what you're doing also makes sense. If I hadn't grown up in the House of the Hearth and became a spy in Vimara Village... If only I were born in Vimara Village.
:{{DIcon}} All this talk is meaningless.
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' I know. I just feel sorry. I wish I'd always been "Alphonso," not "Trofin Snezhevich." I wish I really was Iotham's big brother.
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' I want to be a good person, but I belong to an organization. I want to be family to Rana and the kids, but I've already got a "family" I can't turn my back on.
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' Many of my fellows have powers rivaling the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers|Lord Harbingers]] and are not subject to any city or state. That's something even a free, honorary knight like you probably couldn't comprehend...
:{{DIcon}} I do comprehend.
::{{DIcon}} But what you did is inexcusable.
:{{DIcon}} I don't comprehend.
::{{DIcon}} Nor will I even attempt to.
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' Well, that's all I've got to say. So, what are you going to do with me now?
:{{DIcon}} Don't come near Vimara Village or let me see you again.
::'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' I see. Got it. You won't see me again. I'm not returning to the Fatui, either, since I blew my mission and brought shame to my "siblings."
::'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' Iotham will probably be waiting for "Alphonso" to come back forever...
::{{DIcon}} Go now. Paimon should be here any minute.
:::'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' Goodbye. No, farewell.
::;(Trofin leaves)
::{{DIcon}} (Battle) I changed my mind.
:::'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' I've foreseen the ending for the wicked, but I won't go down without a fight. You might be (Traveler) and I might not have a chance, but I'll still fight, because...
:::'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' I'm the evil amidst good, the poison amidst the herbs, the wolf in sheep's clothing, the mercury in a golden chalice... My name is Snezhevich. Do your worst!
::;(Enter battle against Trofin Snezhevich)
:{{DIcon}} (Battle) Arana and I both agreed...
::{{DIcon}} That the wicked must be punished.
::'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' I've foreseen the ending for the wicked, but I won't go down without a fight. You might be (Traveler) and I might not have a chance, but I'll still fight, because...
::'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' I'm the evil amidst good, the poison amidst the herbs, the wolf in sheep's clothing, the mercury in a golden chalice... My name is Snezhevich. Do your worst!
:;(Enter battle against Trofin Snezhevich)
----
;(After defeating Trofin Snezhevich)
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' Forgive me, Iotham...
:'''Trofin Snezhevich:''' You must grow up. Do not yield to the wind, or the rain. Do not yield to the winter snow, or the summer heat...
