'''Contending Fire''' is a form of energy produced in battle between the people of [[Natlan]]. It is crucial for Natlan's survival, as it is the fuel that sustains the [[Sacred Flame]]. Contending Fire is primarily generated through the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]], a combat-focused tournament.

Objects carried in battle by warriors of Natlan can also become imbued with Contending Fire. Burning these objects can "activate" the Contending Fire they contain and allow it to be used as fuel, as shown by [[Mavuika]] in the quest ''[[Past and Future]]''.
