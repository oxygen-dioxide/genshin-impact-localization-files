:'''Xi the Maid:''' I wonder how much longer [[Master Hui|the young master]] can last...
:'''Xi the Maid:''' Hello. I'm sorry, there were some things on my mind.
:{{DIcon}} The "young master"?
::'''Xi the Maid:''' That young man whose lips are never far from the words "betting on uncut stones" is the young master of our house.
::'''Xi the Maid:''' The current master and the young master argued till they were red in the face just before they parted. But not a few moments after the young master left, the master sent me after him with some traveling expenses.
::'''Xi the Maid:''' Our lady seemed quite unworried, saying that the young master would surely return.
::'''Xi the Maid:''' Well, he did a similar thing once, when he was younger.
:{{DIcon}} Your clothes...
::'''Xi the Maid:''' Oh, please do not worry. This is our young master's instruction.
::'''Xi the Maid:''' I'm not sure why he insisted that I wear a maid uniform from Mondstadt, though I suspect it is some curious hobby of his.
::'''Xi the Maid:''' But since these were his instructions, I will follow them.
::'''Xi the Maid:''' ...Me? Well, I don't exactly mind it; although it does feel a bit... weird when people stare as they come and go.
:{{DIcon}} Well, see you.
::'''Xi the Maid:''' Though our young master is quite feckless and has a difficult temper, he does come up with the strangest requests at times...
::'''Xi the Maid:''' ...That said, I would like to thank you for looking after him. I hope that all goes well with you.
