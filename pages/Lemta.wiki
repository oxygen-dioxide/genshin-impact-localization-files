:'''Avena:''' I think I'll go explore over there next!
:'''Lemta:''' Miss, with all due respect, your adventure plan...
:'''Avena:''' Yeah, I know. I haven't forgotten! I just want to buy some [[Sumeru]] specialties before I set off.
:'''Avena:''' Come shop with me first, and I'll pay you by the standard of an Adventurer's bodyguard. You won't be underpaid. Trust me.
:'''Lemta:''' It's not the money. I don't usually carry packages for clients in the downtown area...
:'''Avena:''' Well, I wasn't fully prepared for this. I came to Sumeru with only diving equipment. Just see this as procuring supplies for my adventure.
:'''Lemta:''' Fine then...

:'''Lemta:''' Miss, with all due respect, your adventure plan...
:'''Avena:''' Oh, I know, I haven't forgotten! But isn't it the Sabzeruz Festival that's going on right now?
:'''Avena:''' How could I not throw myself, body and soul, into such an important holiday?
:'''Lemta:''' Your whole body and soul {{sic|and}} one thing, but if you throw your whole wallet at the festival too, you won't have anything left to cover adventuring expenses, you know!
:'''Avena:''' Oh, wallet schmallet! That's where you're wrong. You can't eat money, it's meant to be spent!
:'''Lemta:''' *sigh* Really? Well, alright, then...
