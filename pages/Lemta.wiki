==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Avena:''' I think I'll go explore over there next!
:'''Lemta:''' Miss, with all due respect, your adventure plan...
:'''Avena:''' Yeah, I know. I haven't forgotten! I just want to buy some [[Sumeru]] specialties before I set off.
:'''Avena:''' Come shop with me first, and I'll pay you by the standard of an Adventurer's bodyguard. You won't be underpaid. Trust me.
:'''Lemta:''' It's not the money. I don't usually carry packages for clients in the downtown area...
:'''Avena:''' Well, I wasn't fully prepared for this. I came to Sumeru with only diving equipment. Just see this as procuring supplies for my adventure.
:'''Lemta:''' Fine then...
