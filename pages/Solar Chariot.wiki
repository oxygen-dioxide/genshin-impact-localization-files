The '''Solar Chariot''', also known as the '''star of daybreak''', is a byname for the sun in legends about [[Teyvat]]'s ancient history, much like how Teyvat's moon(s) are personified as three sisters named [[Aria, Sonnet and Canon]] who rode in a silver carriage.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Moonlit Bamboo Forest|3}}</ref> In the distant past, while [[Morax]] was still young, the Solar Chariot fell to [[Teyvat]], creating [[The Chasm]].<ref name="RoJ6">{{Ref/Book|Records of Jueyun|6}}</ref><ref name="SR">{{Ref/Arti|Solar Relic}}</ref>

The fall of the Solar Chariot was likely the result of the same incident which led to Aria, Sonnet, and Canon's deaths at each other's hands.

==Story==
Legends about the Solar Chariot vary in their accounts of how it returned to the sky. According to ''[[Records of Jueyun: Hidden Jade]]'', the Solar Chariot was a star with a proud and agitated temper. While it slumbered after its fall to the earth, it reawakened during the [[Archon War]] and, unable to stand the bloodshed and warring that filled the earth, leapt back into the sky.<ref name="RoJ6" /> In another story, the Solar Chariot was an object that was repaired by the indigenous people in The Chasm and then flew back into the sky.<ref name="SR" />
