'''Pulverite''' is an exploration mechanic in [[Natlan]]. It is a mineral that usually occurs in large blocks, which can be smashed using a [[Tatankasaurus]] or [[Collective of Plenty]] character's skill, or by hitting them with [[Flamegranate]]s. Destroying these blocks may reveal hidden objects, such as Chests.

Pulverite is created when [[gaseous Phlogiston]] fuses with stones during volcanic activity; this makes it distinct from [[solid Phlogiston]].<ref>Interactable: [[Flowfire Experimentation Site#"Phlogiston Converter" Experimental Report|"Phlogiston Converter" Experimental Report]]</ref> During eruption cycles in [[Atocpan]], it is frequently launched out of the volcano to fall in the surrounding area.
