The conflicts surrounding the cataclysm primarily revolve around the encroachment of the [[Abyss]] &mdash; an otherworldly power at odds with [[Celestia]]'s power &mdash; and the destruction of [[Khaenri'ah]], a nation that lived without the influence of the [[gods]]. While the exact order of events is unknown, monsters carrying Abyssal power spewed forth from Khaenri'ah and wreaked havoc throughout [[Teyvat]]. Khaenri'ah's attempt to rebel against the gods ended with its destruction at the hands of the gods and the Heavenly Principles. This led survivors from the fallen nation to bear grudges against Celestia and the [[The Seven|Seven Archons]], while The Seven themselves grew embittered towards Celestia. Two of the Teyvat Chapter's main antagonistic groups, the [[Abyss Order]] and the [[Fatui]], were established as a direct response to Celestia's actions.<ref name="AQ1-4-3">{{Ref/Quest|Dishonorable Trial}}</ref><ref name="PF">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Pale Flame}}</ref>

The exact circumstances surrounding the cataclysm remain a mystery, but it is linked to the "truth of this world." The [[Traveler]]'s journey is to uncover said truth, during which they will learn more about the cataclysm.

==Khaenri'ah's Destruction==
The order of events and the motivations of those involved in the cataclysm are not fully known, although a few perspectives have been presented throughout the game.

===Khaenri'ah's Ambition===
Several thousand years ago, around the time the ancient civilization [[Sal Vindagnyr]] fell,<ref name="Scribe's Box">{{Ref/Item|Scribe's Box}}</ref><ref group="Assumption">Currently, Khaenri'ah is the only known nation that was established with the intention of living without gods.</ref> the kingdom of Khaenri'ah was established as a nation without gods and its inhabitants considered their nation to be the "pride of humankind."<ref name="AQ1-4-2"/> Khaenri'ah's existence and its goal of living independently from the gods were not secrets in Teyvat,<ref name="Scribe's Box" /><ref name="Jean">{{Ref/VO|Jean|Jean's Hobbies}}</ref> and people from the Seven Nations have joined the original founders of Khaenri'ah over the millennia.<ref name="Fortune Mocking">{{Ref/Quest|Fortune-Mocking Pedigree}}</ref>

People of Khaenri'ah suspected that the so-called "gods" &mdash; and in particular the entity known as the [[Heavenly Principles]] &mdash; were in fact alien to this world and had usurped it from its original denizens.<ref name="SubterraTrials" /> They knew the rumor that [[False Sky|"the [starry] skies of Teyvat are fake"]]<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Where Ancient Stars Align}}</ref><ref name="C3A5">{{Ref/Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies}}</ref><ref group="Translation Note">Compare the Chinese versions of Dottore's {{Lang|"skies of Teyvat are fake"|zh=「提瓦特的星空是虚假的」|zh_tl='Teyvat's starry sky is fake'}} line in ''Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies'' with Scaramouche's line in ''Where Ancient Stars Align'': {{Lang|"The stars, the sky... It's all a gigantic hoax. A lie."|zh=星空本身，就是个巨大的谎言。|zh_tl=The starry sky itself is a gigantic lie.}}</ref> &mdash; which was completely unknown to the second God of Wisdom [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] before she learned of it from [[Il Dottore]] during the events of {{Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies}}. Khaenri'ah began plotting to rebel against and overthrow the gods.<ref name="AQ1-4-3" /> They developed [[Automatons]] now known as Ruin Machines as a means to fight against Celestia, and originally knew "[[Ruin Guard]]s" as "Field Tillers," as they believed that ''"The land is not to be tilled with farming tools, but rather to be fought for with steel and blood."''<ref name="AQ1-4-2">{{Ref/Quest|A Herald Without Adherents}}</ref>

Few Khaenri'ahn statements have emerged regarding their perspective on the [[Archon War]], which led to the establishment of [[The Seven]]. However, they had some notable activities during that time period. [[Ruin Machines]] appeared in Teyvat as early as 3,700 years ago and some were collected by [[Guizhong]] during her research into mechanics.<ref name="Voyage Sanguine">{{Ref/Domain|Voyage to the Sanguine Sky}}</ref><ref group="Assumption">Because Ruin Machines were developed by the people of Khaenri'ah, the fact that Guizhong was able to collect some before she died 3,700 years ago indicates that Khaenri'ah already existed by then.</ref> Shortly before the last people in [[Enkanomiya]] emigrated to [[Watatsumi Island]], diplomats from Khaenri'ah traveled to Enkanomiya to find evidence that the gods were usurpers. They attempted to steal the forbidden book ''[[Before Sun and Moon]]'', which held an account of the ancient world ruled by the [[Heavenly Principles]] up until its clash with the [[Second Who Came]], but failed to make away with it due to [[Antei]]'s intervention.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Collection of Dragons and Snakes}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Antigonus}}</ref>

It is unclear why the gods never made a move against Khaenri'ah over its long history, but it is heavily implied that Celestia finally took action 500 years ago due to Khaenri'ah's increasing involvement with the [[Abyss]] and forbidden knowledge, which are inherently corruptive towards Teyvat.

===The Abyss and Forbidden Knowledge===
The Abyss' power is described as "alien" to the world of Teyvat and is the only power capable of tainting the power of the gods.<ref name="CA">{{Ref/Item|Chunk of Aerosiderite}}</ref> Forbidden knowledge, which stems from the depths of the Abyss, cannot be understood by even the Gods of Wisdom themselves, and its effects on mortals are both dangerous and maddening &mdash; capable of driving them insane and manifesting as deadly diseases such as [[Eleazar]]. The world itself appears to decay and die under its influence as evidenced by the [[The Withering|Withering]]. If forbidden knowledge is not eradicated completely, even traces of it would continue to forever plague the world.<ref name="C3A5"/>

The first presumed emergence of Abyssal power in Teyvat occurred during the war between the Heavenly Principles and the Second Who Came. [[Nabu Malikata]], a survivor of the [[Seelie]] race &mdash; which had once been heavenly envoys tasked with guiding humanity &mdash; recounted to [[King Deshret]] how "'invaders descended from beyond the firmament, bringing with them destruction, overturning rivers, spreading plagues,'" and that these invaders not only brought war to the Seelie but also vainly attempted to break the "shackles" to the land.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Amethyst Crown|note=Chinese|quote={{Zh|「自外而来者为我曾经的族人带来了战争，亦为大地带来突破桎梏的妄想…」|tl='The outsiders brought war to my former kin, and brought to the earth a vain attempt to break [or "the vain hope of breaking"] the restraints...'}}}}</ref><ref group="Translation Note">The English localization's ''"'they also brought about illusions that could break through shackles to the land'"'' in Amethyst Crown's description is poorly worded, as it can be misconstrued to mean that the invaders had a power of illusions that was capable of breaking through shackles. The original Chinese text is clear that the invaders' attempt to break the shackles was doomed to fail.</ref> Afterwards, the Heavenly Principles cast down the [[Celestial Nail]]s to mend the earth, which also laid waste to the mortal realm.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Amethyst Crown}}</ref> This roughly aligns with the timeline of Sal Vindagnyr's destruction, which in turn indicates that the kingdom of Khaenri'ah formed around this time period.

The "shackles" may include one or all of the "cycle of seven;" "sun, moon, and weight;" "barrier between life and death;" and/or the "original principles of rules, verdicts, and grace." King Deshret mentions that the "dark poison penetrated the earth," wherein the "dark poison" refers to Abyssal power, and goes on to state ''"The beastly trail from the poison should be cut off, for taking poison is a sin running deeper than the sky. But how sweet the whispers can be, and how clear the wisdom of which they speak..."'' Hoping to overthrow the Heavenly Principles himself, King Deshret later inadvertently spread forbidden knowledge, bringing his kingdom to ruin.<ref name="SotSS">{{Ref/Weapon|Staff of the Scarlet Sands}}</ref>

In [[Sumeru]], which Khaenri'ah was located underneath,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Destined Encounter}}</ref> another four notable incidents involving the Abyss and/or forbidden knowledge have occurred. While the first two incidents have no direct relation to Khaenri'ah or the cataclysm, they illustrate the destructiveness of Abyssal power to Teyvat:
# Thousands of years ago, as the final part of her vengeance against [[Ormazd]], [[Liloupar]] ultimately utilized the power of the Abyss to wreak havoc in the oasis kingdom. [[Parvezravan]] and many of the city's inhabitants turned into monsters, while the capital city fell into a deep chasm within the earth.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Memories of Gurabad}}</ref> A plague also overran the city and devastated the population.<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Tale of Shiruyeh and Shirin|2}}</ref>
# Before Liloupar's incident, Nabu Malikata sacrificed herself to help King Deshret learn the secrets of the skies and the Abyss to further his ambition of making humanity into the "god of gods."<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Secret-Keeper's Magic Bottle}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Arti|Wilting Feast}}</ref> This caused the land to be engulfed by a sandstorm and while King Deshret survived, his continued attempts to turn humanity into the "god of gods" eventually brought forbidden knowledge to his people sometime after Liloupar's incident. This knowledge brought forth the demise of his once-glorious desert civilization, filling the minds of his people with "crazed whispers" and causing dark necrotic scales to manifest on their bodies. It is implied that the land itself would have withered away were it not for the timely intervention of [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]], who built temples infused with the divine power of life to slow down the spread of the blight. This threat was only completely eradicated after King Deshret chose to sacrifice himself, purging forbidden knowledge from the world for good.<ref name="SotSS" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Secret of the Scorching Desert}}</ref>
# During the cataclysm, another resurgence of Abyssal power and forbidden knowledge occurred. This time, the disaster was so severe that it brought ruin to the rainforest and infected [[Irminsul]] itself &mdash; and by extension, the consciousness of the [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]], who was the avatar of Irminsul. While the Dendro Archon gave her life trying to combat the knowledge pollution, she could only stall its progression as traces of it yet remained in her corrupted conscious in Irminsul, creating Withering Zones, causing Eleazar, and even triggering earthquakes and sandstorms in the desert for the next 500 years. During {{Quest|Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies}}, [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] erases the remnant memory of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata in Irminsul, which successfully eradicates the knowledge pollution &mdash; but comes at the cost of the entire world of Teyvat forgetting that Rukkhadevata ever existed. The only known person known to remember Rukkhadevata afterwards is the [[Traveler]], who lies outside of Teyvat's laws.<ref name="C3A5" />
# During the cataclysm, the area known as the [[Girdle of the Sands]] was greatly affected by the Abyss, with the [[Pari]], a sprite-like race, having to fight against the corruption alongside the [[Nagarjunites]]. While a great tree sprouted in [[Vourukasha Oasis]] unleashing pure energy, at [[Tunigi Hollow]], a current of Abyssal energy flowed through it, resulting in both sides being in a deadlock in past 500 years. The tree was nearing the verge of collapse until the Traveler intervened, removing the abyssal power and cleansing the tree with the help of the Pari.

====The Art of Khemia====
The [[Art of Khemia]], a form of [[alchemy]] developed in Khaenri'ah that allows for the creation of life itself, has also been hinted as a cause for Khaenri'ah's destruction.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Venti|About Albedo}}</ref> Because Khaenri'ah was established underground and therefore had few natural fauna, the Art of Khemia was developed as a means to create life for the sake of survivability.<ref name="albedo5" /> It is unclear whether the Art of Khemia was originally developed with the Abyss' power, but it certainly was by the time of the cataclysm.

After Khaenri'ah fell, the alchemist "Gold" [[Rhinedottir]]<ref name="the snowy past" /> became a "sinner" and created an "army of shadowy monsters" that included the dark dragon [[Durin]].<ref name="BAF1" /> These creations, empowered by an "all-consuming darkness" capable of tainting even the powers of The Seven, destroyed all in their path once they were unleashed on Teyvat.<ref name="CA" /> Rhinedottir's motivations for unleashing her creations and causing widespread destruction is unknown and some of them, such as the [[Rifthounds]], appear to have run free on their own. Durin was under the impression that she sent him aboveground to display his "beauty,"<ref name="FstDsr" /> and was unconscious of his actions and the destruction he caused once he reached [[Mondstadt]] up until the moment of his death.<ref name="DgspSpr" />

===The Arrival of Outlanders===
As part of their ambition to overthrow the Heavenly Principles, the sages of Khaenri'ah took an interest in the Abyss, believing that so long as they could control the Abyss, they could control "everything."<ref name="Portended Fate">{{Ref/Quest|Portended Fate}}</ref><ref group="Translation Note">In the original Chinese text, Chlothar specifies {{Lang|''"And as long as Khaenri'ah could control the Abyss, they could control everything!"''|zh=而坎瑞亚只要掌控了深渊，就能掌控一切！}} The English localization can be misconstrued to mean they thought the Traveler's sibling could control the Abyss, so this clarification has been added.</ref> Sometime around 500 years ago, the [[Traveler's Sibling|Traveler's sibling]] descended on this world after the "heavens [Sky] responded to the summoning,"<ref name="Night-Bird">{{Ref/Quest|The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call}}</ref><ref group="Translation Note">In the original Chinese version, Scaramouche says {{Lang|"Plus, it's because the Sky responded to the summoning that {{MC|m=she|f=he}} descended on this world."|zh=而且，是因为「天空」回应了召唤，{{MC|m=她|f=他}}才降临至此世}}. Notably, {{Zh|「天空」|tl=Sky}} is treated as a special term, which is not conveyed in the English localization.</ref> and traveled to Khaenri'ah first.<ref name="Toast">{{Ref/Quest|A Toast to Victory}}</ref>

The Khaenri'ahns placed their hopes in the Traveler's sibling, seeing them as someone who represented the Abyss and would bring "new strength and hope" to them. They were named as heir by the last King of Khaenri'ah, Irmin, becoming the "Prince"/"Princess" of Khaenri'ah<ref name="Portended Fate" /> and Pierro is said to have lived with them for a time.<ref name="Night-Bird" /> However, the sibling's involvement became a catalyst for the cataclysm instead, something [[Chlothar|Chlothar Alberich]] berated them for when they met after Khaenri'ah fell.<ref name="Portended Fate" /> How exactly this happened is unknown, but it is implied that the Sibling took part in a ritual initiated by King Irmin which allowed them to become a "vessel for unlimited abyssal power," following which the Cataclysm occurred.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Wings of Fate's Course Intertwined}}</ref>

Notably, even though both the [[Traveler]] and their sibling descended to this world after having traveled to countless worlds following the destruction of their home world,<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Sword of Descension}}</ref> the sibling's activities in this world were recorded in [[Irminsul]], which only contains records of those native to this world. This has led the [[Fatui]] not to consider the sibling as a [[Descender]] when the Traveler is, and [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] suggests that the sibling is actually native to this world despite the Traveler's memories indicating that this is not possible.<ref name="Toast" /> Scaramouche later posits that Khaenri'ah has something to do with this discrepancy, and his speculation is informed by the information given to him by the former Khaenri'ahn royal mage [[Pierro]].<ref name="Night-Bird" />

The Fatui have recorded at least four Descenders, the first of which Lesser Lord Kusanali presumes is the Heavenly Principles, who aligns with the Primordial One (or the "eternal throne of the heavens") mentioned in ''Before Sun and Moon'',<ref name="BSAM">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2}}</ref> and the fourth of which is the Traveler.<ref name="Toast" /> It can be assumed from ''Before Sun and Moon'' and from Nabu Malikata's account that the second Descender is likely the entity known as the Second Who Came (or "second throne of the heavens"),<ref name="BSAM" /> who may also be the outlander whom a Seelie ancestor fell in love with &mdash; which led to the destruction of heaven and earth merely thirty days after their union.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Records of Jueyun|4}}</ref>

Also noteworthy is that when the traveling twins attempted to leave Teyvat, the [[Unknown God]] who introduced herself as the "sustainer of Heavenly Principles" calls the twins "outlanders" when she confronts them, indicating that she knew they both were not from this world. She also seemed to be specifically targeting the sibling; after capturing the sibling, she merely gazes at the sibling's cube in her hand and pays no heed to the Traveler up until they attempt to attack her.<ref name="AQ0-0">{{Ref/Quest|Wanderer's Trail}}</ref> How or why the sibling gained the freedom to wander Teyvat after their presumed capture, when the Traveler was not freed for another 500 years, has yet to be seen.

===Celestia's Punishment===
Two concepts closely associated with Celestia have been brought up regarding Khaenri'ah's destruction: sin and the [[Heavenly Principles]] (also referred to as "destiny"). Based on lore surrounding [[Orobashi]] and the people of [[Enkanomiya]], "sin" consists of both knowledge and actions deemed subversive in Celestia's eyes.<ref name="SubterraTrials">{{Ref/Quest|The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent}}</ref> The exact nature of the Heavenly Principles is a mystery, but it seems to be linked to the concepts of the relentless flow of time and the impermanence of the mortal realm.

[[Pierro]], who co-founded the [[Fatui]] with the [[Tsaritsa|Cryo Archon]] after the cataclysm, mentions that the "sages" from his home country &mdash; Khaenri'ah<ref name="Night-Bird"/> &mdash; tore away the "veil of sin," thereby "ushering in a tide of divine wrath, destruction, and foolishness."<ref name="MockMask">{{Ref/Arti|Mocking Mask}}</ref> People of Khaenri'ah have been referred to as "sinners," both by Khaenri'ahns in reference to themselves<ref>{{Ref/VO|Kaeya|More About Kaeya: IV}}</ref> and in other sources. [[Kaeya]] remarks that all that is left in Khaenri'ah are sinners who "aren't worth talking about, Rhinedottir (as Gold) is described as a "sinner"<ref name="BAF1" /><ref name="SWP">{{Ref/Weapon|Skyward Pride}}</ref><ref group="Note">In the original Chinese version of ''Breeze Amidst the Forest, Vol. I'',  where the English localization says "The alchemist known as Gold was corrupted by their own greed and ambition," it instead says {{zh|被称为「黄金」的炼金士堕落为了罪人|tl=The alchemist known as Gold fell from grace and became a sinner.}}</ref> and "great sinner."<ref name="CA" />

While Khaenri'ah's sins have not been explicitly stated, Enkanomiya may provide enough information to make some hypotheses. For holding an account of the ancient world in ''[[Before Sun and Moon]]'', which was written by a scribe of [[Istaroth]] and later inadvertently read by Orobashi, all of Watatsumi was pronounced guilty with "four counts of the sin of profanity, and a further eight counts for the sin of deceiving living souls."<ref name="SubterraTrials" /><ref>{{Ref/NPC|Eboshi}}</ref> To prevent its people from being collectively punished, Orobashi agreed to take their sins on itself and go to its death to pay the price, and banned the book. Shortly before revealing himself to be an Abyss Lector and attacking the [[Traveler]], Enjou tells them that he is "one such sinner &mdash; one who has committed the sins of deception and betrayal."<ref name="SubterraTrials" />

The Heavenly Principles, meanwhile, are something both [[The Seven]] and the Abyss Order view in a negative light. While recounting the events of the cataclysm and how they led to her current obsession with Eternity, [[Ei]] says she saw "a nation stride forward and lose everything to the Heavenly Principles."<ref name="Promise of a People's Dream">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/hQ5GEOlwLUQ Story Teaser: Promise of a People's Dream]</ref> After the remains of [[Makoto]]'s power is used to plant the [[Sacred Sakura]] in the past, Makoto says: ''Eternity extends time into infinity, dreams illuminate each moment within. When both shine in unison, the Sacred Sakura blooms from the darkness, finally free from the clutches of the Heavenly Principles.'' Furthermore, Ei's dialogue afterward suggests that Istaroth had a hand in Makoto's ability too.<ref name="RadiSakura">{{Ref/Quest|Radiant Sakura}}</ref>

Several other figures have voiced their opinion that Celestia's punishment of Khaenri'ah was cruel and unjust. Accordng to the [[Capitano]], Ruler of Death, [[Ronova]], cursed the full-blooded [[Khaenri'ahns]] with immortality with no distinction in whom she cursed despite the fact that the [[Five Sinners of Khaenri'ah]] and the [[Irmin|Vinster King]] were the primary culprits responsible for the calamity.<ref name="When All Becomes a Monument">{{Ref/Quest|When All Becomes a Monument|quote=: '''"The Captain":''' The people of Khaenri'ah committed grave sins, and for that we were cursed to suffer endless physical torment, cursed to witness the demise of everything we held dear. But, most of us were innocent. Most of us knew nothing of the [[Five Sinners]]' exploitation of Abyssal power... myself included.}}</ref> It is the reason why the [[Traveler's Sibling]] seeks to wage endless war against "destiny" until the "thrones" are toppled, and why the [[Tsaritsa]] seeks to rebel against the divine and create a new world.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Polar Star}}</ref><ref name="Lazzo">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/TmaAOV4SJNQ Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo]</ref> To oppose both the Abyss Order and Celestia, the Tsaritsa established the Fatui, with Pierro as its first member. The punishment is also why the [[Capitano]] sacrificed in place of [[Mavuika]], the current [[Pyro Archon]], to create a paradox, fulfilling his vengeance for the suffering inflicted upon innocent Khaenri'ahns.<ref>{{Ref|Quest|When All Becomes a Monument}}</ref>

At the same time, Celestia's attack may have been triggered by Khaenri'ah's actions. Dainsleif warns the Traveler against "trying to overthrow them [the gods], or hunt[ing] them down," despite previously voicing his disdain towards them. When the Traveler questions his contradictory statements, he explains that he wants to avoid repeating the "failings of my forebears."<ref name="AQ1-4-3" /> Pierro's statement about how the sages of his nation "ushered in" the destruction wrought on them suggests he believes they had some culpability in causing their own destruction.<ref name="MockMask" /> While musing to himself before [[La Signora]]'s funeral, he alludes to these same sages, saying "The sages think themselves to be all-knowing, but we [the Fatui] alone are wise to the virtue in those acts of folly."<ref name="Lazzo" /><ref group="Note">This same quote was used in a Chinese-only official teaser for the Eleven Fatui Harbingers before [[Tartaglia]]'s playable release.</ref>

===Other Potential Causes===
While his exact deeds are a mystery, the [[kitsune]] [[Urakusai]] is believed to have had some involvement in the Abyss' attack during the cataclysm. After discovering what he had done, the [[Kitsune Saiguu]] angrily banished him to parts unknown, then moved to [[Tenshukaku]] in preparation for the Abyss' attack.<ref name="NCotSK6">{{Ref/Book|New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune|5}}</ref>

==The Cataclysm in Teyvat==
===Mondstadt===
After monsters began emerging from Khaenri'ah, the [[Knights of Favonius]], led by Grand Master [[Arundolyn]] and his anticipated successor [[Rostam]], went on an expedition to Khaenri'ah to fight the monsters.<ref name="BH sands">{{Ref/Arti|Fortitude of the Brave}}</ref> Rostam died during the expedition, leaving Arundolyn and [[Rosalyne-Kruzchka Lohefalter]], who was studying at [[Sumeru Akademiya]] when he died, greatly bereaved. Arundolyn gave up fighting and retired from the Knights of Favonius out of grief,<ref name="FGS" /> while Rosalyne used her knowledge to transform her body into that of living flame and enact her vengeance against the monsters, becoming known as the "Crimson Witch of Flames."<ref name="CWoF">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Crimson Witch of Flames}}</ref>

Meanwhile, Mondstadt was attacked by a corrupted [[Durin]], who was created<ref name="the snowy past" /><ref name="chalk-prince-afterword">{{Ref/Quest|Afterword (The Chalk Prince and the Dragon)}}</ref> and sent to Teyvat by [[Rhinedottir]].<ref name="CA" /><ref name="FstDsr">{{Ref/Weapon|Festering Desire}}</ref><ref name="SWP" /><ref name="SWS">{{Ref/Weapon|Skyward Spine}}</ref><ref name="SWS" /><ref name="BAF2">{{Ref/Book|Breeze Amidst the Forest|2}}</ref><ref name="SWB">{{Ref/Weapon|Skyward Blade}}</ref> As Arundolyn had given up fighting after Rostam's death, there was no Lionfang Knight to lead in battle and no one strong enough to take on Durin.<ref name="FGS">{{Ref/Weapon|Favonius Greatsword}}</ref><ref name="BAF2" /><ref name="DW" /><ref name="FS">{{Ref/Weapon|Ferrous Shadow}}</ref><ref name="FSWD">{{Ref/Weapon|Favonius Sword}}</ref> The people of Mondstadt cried out for help and were heard by the [[Anemo Archon]], who called upon Dvalin. The two engaged Durin in battle and eventually defeated him.

Dvalin ingested Durin's poisonous blood in the process and went to [[Stormterror's Lair|Old Mondstadt]] to recover<ref name="SWP" /><ref name="SWS" /><ref name="BAF2" /><ref name="SWB" /><ref>{{Ref/Item|Dvalin's Claw}}</ref> while Durin fell down on [[Dragonspine]], whose extreme, unnatural cold allowed the power inside Durin to seep into the land of Dragonspine. Even today, Durin's heart in [[Wyrmrest Valley]] appears to still beat.<ref name="DgspSpr">{{Ref/Weapon|Dragonspine Spear}}</ref>

===Liyue===
In Liyue, [[The Chasm (Area)|The Chasm]] and [[Dunyu Ruins]] are two known locations majorly impacted by the cataclysm. Monsters poured out of the Chasm and in response, [[Morax]] sent the [[Millelith]] to defend and evacuate the miners. The [[yaksha]] [[Bosacius]], who had once abandoned his duty to defend Liyue after going mad from [[karma]], was drawn to the bloodshed and fought alongside the Millelith. Bosacius, the exorcist [[Boyang]], and some of the Millelith who chose to lead the vanguard ultimately perished in The Chasm after luring the monsters into a mysterious underground palace with the power to negate the power of the Abyss and using the [[Fantastic Compass]] to seal them in the [[The Chasm's Bed|Chasm's Bed]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|End of the Line (Quest)|quote='''Xiao:''' He fought here. The nameless yaksha from the legends... it was him.}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Tenacity of the Millelith}}</ref> Liyue eventually won the battle, but at the cost of many lives.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Danger All Around}}</ref>

What occurred in Dunyu Ruins is unknown, but its people decided to abandon the city and move to Liyue Harbor; none of the refugees nor adepti have spoken about what happened there.<ref name="RoJ6">{{Ref/Book|Records of Jueyun|6}}</ref>

===Inazuma===
Shortly before the Abyss invaded Teyvat, the [[kitsune]] [[Urakusai]] apparently did something linked to it, which greatly angered the [[Kitsune Saiguu]] and led to his banishment. The Kitsune Saiguu, aware of the impending threat, moved from the [[Grand Narukami Shrine (Subarea)|Grand Narukami Shrine]] to [[Tenshukaku]] to stay close to the Electro Archon, then [[Makoto]].<ref name="NCotSK6" /> Makoto was also aware that something was going to happen in Khaenri'ah, saying that it "was not somewhere that any archon could afford to ignore" after Ei asks her about it long after her death.<ref name="RadiSakura" />

When the Abyss attacked, Makoto and her close allies, [[Ei]], [[Mikoshi Chiyo]], the Kitsune Saiguu, [[Reizenbou]], and [[Takamine the Mistsplitter]] fought back the otherworldly threat but eventually perished or disappeared. Chiyo was consumed by a "beast of sin" and, while she slew the monster from within, was corrupted &mdash; she turned against Ei and fought her, which ended after Ei cut her horns and sword arm off and forced her to flee. The Kitsune Saiguu disappeared and was "consumed" by the Abyss for reasons that are unclear but likely related to the [[Thunder Sakura]]s, which were nearly overwhelmed trying to purify the land during the cataclysm. Reizenbou, enraged by her inability to protect the Kitsune Saiguu, left on a self-imposed exile. Takamine disappeared in a battle against the dark forces, only to be killed by his former lover [[Asase Hibiki]] when he finally resurfaced many years later.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Thundering Pulse}}</ref> Makoto was slain in battle in what is suggested to be Khaenri'ah, dying in her sister's arms.<ref name="Promise of a People's Dream" />

===Sumeru===
Sumeru was apparently affected by the cataclysm later than other countries such as Mondstadt,<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Witch's End Time}}</ref><ref name="EftE">{{Ref/Weapon|Elegy for the End}}</ref> and it occurred simultaneously with the contamination of [[Irminsul]] by the forbidden knowledge. It's not known if the two events are connected, however, the Dendro Archon, [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]], was slain during the cataclysm, which caused [[Viridescent]] to no longer be able to hear the grass and trees speak.<ref name="VV sands">{{Ref/Arti|Viridescent Venerer's Determination}}</ref>

[[Old Vanarana]] was one of the places attacked in Sumeru by hordes of ruin machines and riftwolves. While the [[Aranara]] fought fiercely against the invaders, presumably with some humans, the land itself was heavily scarred from the fighting. A strange entity known as [[Marana's Avatar]] quickly formed at some point during or after the battle. While the Aranara managed to seal it away, it eventually managed to bypass the seal and began to spread an anomaly later known as [[The Withering]] across Sumeru's forests.

In the Girdle of the Sands, monsters also emerged from the Abyss to attack the area, with the Pari and Nagarjunites working together to repel the threat; the previous Hydro Archon, [[Egeria]], was slain in battle, but Greater Lord Rukkhadevata grew the [[Harvisptokhm]] to tether her consciousness to the mortal realm and contain the Abyssal defilement in the area. Several monsters were also encased in a strange gray crystal that resulted from the powers of the Abyss, leaving them in a state of torpor for the next few centuries. As centuries passed, the Harvisptokhm began to degrade and without anyone to maintain it, it was nearly overwhelmed by the defilement until the Traveler and a Pari named [[Sorush]] discovered the remaining Great Songs of Khvarena to purify the crystallized trees at Tunigi Hollow.

===Fontaine===
It is implied that [[Elynas (NPC)|Elynas]] appeared at some point during the cataclysm, and began to cause severe pollution to the land and sea. The Director of the [[Narzissenkreuz Institute]] and other [[Oceanid]] went to confront the disaster, while vice-director [[Basil Elton]] was recalled by the Fontaine Armada to hunt Elynas. The armada was nearly destroyed while hunting Elynas down, as they attracted many abyssal sea creatures during their pursuit, with the [[Sponsian]] being destroyed in battle against Elynas. Elynas eventually bled out and died.

===Natlan===
During the Cataclysm, Natlan was particularly vulnerable to the threat of the Abyss as they had the most unstable and shallow-rooted Ley Lines on Teyvat. This corruption caused immense damage and its people initially resigned themselves to their fate, believing victory was impossible. However, with the [[Mavuika|Pyro Archon]] leading the way and uniting the tribes, they were able to repel the Abyss from their nation, albeit at a high cost, forcing the Abyss to retreat underground where they remain a threat to the nation until this day.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Past and Future}}</ref>

Under the Pyro Archon's order, [[Tenoch]], along with the [[Heroes of Natlan|six heroes]] from the six major tribes, headed first into the hotspot of Abyss emergence, at the place later known as [[Mare Jivari]] at the west of Natlan.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Talking Stick}}</ref><ref name="EoL">{{Ref/Quest|Echoes of Life}}</ref>

When the Abyss invaded the Children of Echoes, the hero [[Traore]] and the tribesfolk, with the help of the two Khaenri'ahn soldiers [[Zephaniah]] and [[Irizar]], managed to lure it to the [[Sulfurous Veins]] and sealed it with numerous Shadow Pins.<ref name="SotM">{{Ref/Quest|Shadows of the Mountains}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Book|The Volcano Lord and the Shadow Pins}}</ref>

===Snezhnaya===
During the Cataclysm, [[Nod-Krai]] was the first to be attacked by the [[The Wild Hunt|Abyssal Forces]].<ref>YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbDXwuUWxhY&ab_channel=GenshinImpact Behind the Scenes of Genshin Impact "Let's Start With Nod-Krai" | Genshin Impact #NodKrai]</ref> 

==The Cataclysm in Khaenri'ah==
The clash between Celestia and The Seven versus Khaenri'ah ended with the gods' victory. As punishment for losing, the [[Eclipse Dynasty]] was wiped out. Dainsleif, a knight of the royal family, as well as all pure-blooded Khaenri'ahns were cursed with immortality, while citizens of Khaenri'ah who were half-blood or belonging to other nations entirely were instead inflicted with a curse that transformed them into monsters and hilichurls.<ref name="AQ1-4-4">{{Ref/Quest|A Soul Set Apart}}</ref><ref name="Requiem" /><!-- specifically, The Grave of the Guarded --> Some people appear to have avoided the curse, such as [[Kaeya]], and ostensibly [[Rhinedottir]], but their exact circumstances are unknown. Kaeya's circumstances are of particular note because several of his ancestors, [[Chlothar]] and [[Caribert (NPC)|Caribert]], were afflicted with the curse, perhaps suggesting that it was broken at some point, allowing the remainder of Kaeya's lineage to escape its effects. Some, like Dainsleif, have some unknown means of retaining their sanity, although it merely mitigates the effects of their curses.

During the disaster, Dainsleif ordered [[Halfdan]], an elite of the Royal Guards to protect the people of Khaenri'ah at all costs. However, Halfdan and the other royal guards ended up transforming into [[Shadowy Husks]]. Despite this, Halfdan was able to retain part of his consciousness despite lacking whatever Dainsleif used to mitigate his own curse.<ref name="Requiem">{{Ref/Quest|Requiem of the Echoing Depths}}</ref>

[[Thrain]] and his men initially fought during the cataclysm, but when he realized that the situation was unsalvageable, he ordered a retreat to Natlan, joining forces with [[Ayizu]], then the chief of the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]]. Shortly before passing, he told Thrain about the secrets of the {{Pyro}} Gnosis, prompting him to resent [[Mavuika|Haborym]] for not fulfilling her oath.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As One We Watch the Setting Sun}}</ref>

[[Paimon]] also concludes from the account given by the Traveler's Sibling that the monsters of the Abyss Order were originally the people of Khaenri'ah,<ref name="AQ1-4-4" /> which appears to be supported by the Pyro Abyss Lector [[Enjou]]'s search for ''Before Sun and Moon'', mirroring the Khaenri'ah delegation's search from at least 2,000 years ago. As a result of the curse, Dainsleif no longer views hilichurls or Abyss monsters as human.<ref name="AQ1-4-2" /><!-- "despite being far from human" --><ref name="Requiem" /><!-- specifically, Memories of Inteyvat --> It is still unclear what the suggested link between the hilichurls' Eclipse Tribe and Khaenri'ah's Eclipse Dynasty<ref>{{Ref/VO|Traveler|About the Eclipse Tribe}}</ref> means.

After the Traveling Twins arrived in Teyvat, the Traveler's Sibling awoke first and eventually bore witness to Khaenri'ah's destruction.<ref name="WWBR">Story Teaser: [https://youtu.be/SO__VQZirJ4 We Will Be Reunited]</ref> After the cataclysm, they journeyed through the seven nations of Teyvat alongside [[Dainsleif]].<ref name="Toast" /><ref name="AQ1-4-4" />

==Aftermath==
[[File:UnknownGodFight.png|300px|thumb|The traveling twins fight the Unknown God]]
Across the world, there was a sudden surge in hilichurl population following the cataclysm.<ref name="AHili" /><ref name="NPC Glory">{{Ref/NPC|Glory}}</ref>

===Khaenri'ah===
With Khaenri'ah in ruins, the Traveler's Sibling rushed back to where the Traveler still lay unconscious and woke them up, hoping to leave Teyvat as quickly as possible. The Traveler briefly witnessed the destroyed nation themselves before the two eventually set foot in Celestia as they attempted to leave.<ref group="Assumption">It can be assumed that the location of the opening cutscene is Celestia, based on the [[Symbols in Teyvat#Celestial Motif|"Celestial motif"]] found on the architecture in the cutscene, on the architecture in the game's title screen (which, based on their appearance, is the same location as the opening cutscene), on the Skyfrost Nail and [[Chasm Nail]], and on fully-upgraded [[Statues of The Seven]].</ref> There, they were confronted by the Unknown God, who easily overpowered them and separated them, sealing the Sibling away first before dealing with the Traveler.<ref name="AQ0-0" />

Without their masters, Khaenri'ah's automatons spread all over Teyvat, becoming particularly drawn to ruins and thereby becoming known as Ruin Machines.<ref name="AQ1-4-2" /> The Abyss Order was formed with the intent of overthrowing Celestia and laying waste to the surface world under their dominion.<ref name="AQ1-4-4" /> Meanwhile, despite his anger towards The Seven, Dainsleif viewed the Abyss Order as the greater threat and became their vehement opponent.<ref name="AQ1-4-2" /> Pierro, who had opposed the sages' plan from the start, sided with the Tsaritsa and her objective of creating a "new world," becoming the Director of the Fatui Harbingers. Capitano would later follow suit, becoming the first of the Fatui Harbingers. The [[Alberich Clan]] stepped up as regents after the King [[Irmin]]'s strength failed, although they were unable to revive Khaenri'ah.<ref>Event [[Hidden Strife]] Optional Letter: [[Hidden Strife/Story#The Brick|The Brick]]</ref>

Not only did Rhinedottir emerge from the cataclysm alive, she went on to create her second masterpiece, the synthetic human [[Albedo]]. When questioned about his link to the fallen nation, Albedo reassures the Traveler that he was created long after its destruction and that, as a "pure alchemist" like Rhinedottir who lives for academic knowledge, he has no particular attachment to it.<ref name="the snowy past">{{Ref/Quest|The Snowy Past}}</ref> Whether this reflects Rhinedottir's opinion on Khaenri'ah has yet to be seen.

===Mondstadt===
Rosalyne continued fighting against monsters, but her indiscriminate destruction caused many to become fearful of her. Before her flames could consume her heart and kill her, she was discovered by Pierro, who gave her a [[Delusion]] to suppress the flames and a psychological "delusion" that swayed her to join the Fatui's cause.

The White Knight Rostam mentored<ref name="DW">{{Ref/Arti|Guardian's Band}}</ref> survived the expedition and continued fighting against monsters. However, he became engrossed with the physical sensation of slaughter and became known as the [[Bloodstained Knight]]. Realizing he no longer had a place amongst humanity, he ventured into the Abyss intending to die in battle, only to learn about their origins: the "ultimate injustice" that cursed the people of Khaenri'ah into transforming into monsters. The Bloodstained Knight then pledged his allegiance to the Abyss, and his fate thereafter is unknown.<ref name="BSC">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Bloodstained Chivalry}}</ref><ref name="TBS">{{Ref/Weapon|The Black Sword}}</ref>

At some point in Mondstadt's history, the first [[Field Tiller]] &mdash; a prototype for the automatons now known as Ruin Guards &mdash; somehow ended up in Mondstadt and wandered into [[Boreas]]' proving ground. Initially mistaking the war machine for a challenger, Boreas fought against it and eventually greatly damaged it. It then fled to [[Decarabian]]'s tower, where it proceeded to fire missiles at anyone who approached the area. The people of Mondstadt, who did not know about Khaenri'ah's advanced technology, mistook these attacks as the vestiges of Decarabian's wrath and entitled the phenomenon "The Tyrant's Final Fury." However, around a year after the attacks began, they suddenly ceased as the Field Tiller lost functionality. People thereafter determined it was likely not Decarabian's doing, as he was the God of Storms and was unlikely to use fire-based attacks, but did not investigate the issue further.<ref name="AQ1-4-3" />

===Liyue===
In Liyue, the battle against monsters led to a renaissance in weaponsmithing and catalyst creation after people discovered the weapons up until the cataclysm were not suitable for combat against such creatures.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Prototype Amber}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Prototype Starglitter}}</ref> This renaissance continued even after the end of the monster onslaught and led to the development of the [[Prototype Series]] and [[Blackcliff Series]] weapons.

===Inazuma===
With Makoto's death, Ei became the new Electro Archon. Having lost many of her close allies over the course of the conflict, and fearful after witnessing her sister's death and "that thing,"<ref>{{Ref/VO|Raiden Shogun|More About Ei: V}}</ref> Ei became fixated on Eternity and hoped to preserve the current Inazuma forever. Disillusioned with Celestia after witnessing Khaenri'ah's fate,<ref name="Promise of a People's Dream" /> she severed ties with Celestia and ultimately gave her [[Gnosis]] to [[Yae Miko]] for safekeeping.<ref name="AQ2-3-8">{{Ref/Quest|Wishes (Quest)}}</ref>

Afraid that she was susceptible to [[erosion]], Ei conducted experiments into creating an automaton in her likeness, which would rule Inazuma in her stead while Ei would isolate herself in her personal world, the [[Plane of Euthymia]], meditating to stave off erosion. In the process of creating [[the Shogun]], Ei also created the puppet now known as [[Scaramouche]].<ref name="Husk">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Husk of Opulent Dreams}}</ref>

===Sumeru===
Following Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's death, [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] was born and became the new Dendro Archon.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Solitary Fragrance}}</ref> The Akasha System, which is powered by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's Gnosis, is currently used by the people of Sumeru to manage knowledge as a resource.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/JrC7DTUsii8 Sumeru Preview Teaser 03: Prelude to Wisdom]</ref> While the Akasha System is described as Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's legacy, using knowledge as a resource is apparently not something they thought of themselves, as Yae Miko ponders whether it was Lesser Lord Kusanali or the sages at [[Sumeru Akademiya]] who came up with the idea.<ref name="AQ2-3-8" />

===Fontaine===
Egeria's death favored the rise of [[Focalors]], who would henceforth become the new Hydro Archon. The abandonment of Fontaine by the [[Oceanid]]s can therefore be considered as an indirect consequence of the cataclysm, since they did not want to accept Focalors as the new Hydro Archon.

Furthermore, the [[Melusine]]s were born from the remains of Elynas' body, and they mixed with the Fontanians thanks to the help of [[Neuvillette]], with Elynas' consciousness continuing to remain on the mortal plane as their guide. In any case, the coming and death of Elynas contaminated the lands and waters of Fontaine, and although Fontaine's researchers promised that the pollution had been cleansed, this factor may contribute to the current status of Fontaine's waters.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Enigmatic Page (II)}}</ref>

===Natlan===
To prevent the Abyss from returning, the Pyro Archon periodically held the Pilgrimage of Sacred Flames, inviting the tribespeople of Natlan to participate in a tournament to determine who would be eligible to participate in the Night Warden Wars. The winners would be allowed to participate in a raid against the Abyss, provided they were bearers of an Ancient Name granted to them by the [[Wayob]]s. According to legend, as long as the Sacred Flame was not extinguished, the majority of the Abyss would not be able to befall the nation. The Pyro Archon also granted the representatives of the Night Warden Wars with the "Ode to Resurrection," which would allow them to resurrect the fallen name bearers during the incursion as long as one member of the team made it out victorious.

Despite this, the threat of the Abyss continued to loom over Natlan, causing disasters seemingly designed for each tribe: the waters of the [[People of the Springs]] were contaminated, the Children of Echoes' territory was invaded by dangerous sludge surging from underground and unrelenting black winds tore across the lands of the [[Flower-Feather Clan]]. It was then suspected that the Abyss has invaded the [[Night Kingdom]] itself and therefore had the ability to read Natlan's memories at any time.

In order to stop its threat for good, [[Mavuika]] concocted a plan that would span over the course of 500 years to reunite the tribes and fight the Abyss with recognized and acknowledged Ancient Name bearers. However, corruption in the Night Kingdom prevented the information from being sent to the tribes, resulting in Mavuika having to wait for the tribes to be restored to their proper strength. By the time the Traveler had arrived in Natlan, three of the six Ancient Name bearers were prepared; [[Xilonen]], [[Kinich]] and [[Iansan]]. After entering the Night Kingdom to save [[Kachina]], [[Mualani]] was also acknowledged, resulting in Mavuika waiting for the [[Flower-Feather Clan]] and [[Masters of the Night-Wind]] to prepare their Ancient Name bearer.

Eventually, [[Ororon]] was accepted as one of six Ancient Name, causing the Abyss to launch an [[The Surging Darkness|invasion]] across the nation. During the invasion, [[Chasca]] was also recognised, allowing Mavuika and Natlanese to counterattack Abyssal force and drive them deep into the depths of the Night Kingdom. After obtaining the Traveler's Ancient Name, Mavuika and the Traveler fought the [[Where All Hopes Lie|final battle]] against [[Gosoythoth]], eventually emerging victorious, destroying the Abyss for good.

===Snezhnaya===
Afterwards of the Cataclysm, these [[The Wild Hunt|forces]] still roam [[Nod-Krai]]. They take the forms of spirits, fae, or undead. [[Lightkeepers|The Lightkeepers]] are still fighting the abyssal beings to this current moment. 

The Tsaritsa, embittered by what transpired, cut ties with Venti<ref name="AQ0-3-8">{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref> (and potentially the other Archons) and established the Fatui to combat the Abyss Order and to one day overthrow Celestia, with Pierro as the Director of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]]. Pierro took the initiative in recruiting powerful individuals, including La Signora and Scaramouche, granting them Delusions to bolster their abilities. The Tsaritsa also granted her Harbingers god-like executive authority, although it is unclear whether this refers to Delusions or if it is a separate power.<ref name="AQ0-3-8" />

==Present Day==
Despite the cataclysm's large impact on the continent, knowledge about it is scarcely encountered in-game and much of its events have been dismissed as outlandish legend by modern-day people. Merely two books mention the cataclysm, while only a handful of NPCs talk about it.<ref name="NPC Glory" /><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Facing Distant Echoes}}</ref> Even some Fatui members, despite knowing about the threat of the Abyss and fighting it firsthand, do not believe that their conflict has lasted over 500 years.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Company Vanishing Into the Deep}}</ref> [[Jean]] mentions Khaenri'ah,<ref name="Jean" /> but her knowledge of the cataclysm seems to be limited to the tale of Dvalin and Durin, which she learned from [[Diluc]]<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Behind the Scenes}}</ref> after Venti revealed it to him.<ref name="AQ0-2-7">{{Ref/Quest|Wild Escape}}</ref> Paimon also states the Traveler has rummaged through old books searching for information about Khaenri'ah and the cataclysm, with little success.<ref name="AQ1-4-2" /> (It may be notable, however, that five-sixths of the [[Mondstadt Library]]'s collection, which was once the largest in northern Teyvat, was lost following a large fire at an unknown point in time.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Favonius Codex}}</ref>)

Information about the cataclysm primarily comes from [[books]]; artifact, weapon, and item descriptions; or first-hand sources like the Archons or Khaenri'ah survivors. Venti recounts the story of Durin and Dvalin to an audience<ref>{{Ref/Quest|That Green Fellow}}</ref> but does not say when it occurred. After he plays the same song to Diluc, Diluc asks what he "witnessed" &mdash; implying Venti may have given him a vision of the battle &mdash; then states "This is confidential information."<ref name="AQ0-2-7" /> Meanwhile, [[Zhongli]] has a contract that prevents him from speaking about the events of the cataclysm,<ref name="ZL2-4">{{Ref/Quest|Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved}}</ref> while the adepti refused to speak about the events that led Dunyu Ruins to be abandoned.<ref name="RoJ6" /> Ei admits that she still feels fear over what happened during the cataclysm, citing in particular, "...[[Makoto|Her demise]] and that ''thing''," though does not offer much more information as she only arrived after the worst of the fighting and was not herself the Electro Archon at the time.

While their numbers had dwindled since the cataclysm, [[Riftwolves]] (creations of Gold that have the ability to erode the world's boundaries) began appearing on the abandoned [[Tsurumi Island]] of Inazuma. More recently, they have appeared as far away as Mondstadt, where they have begun encroaching on [[Wolvendom]], the territory of [[Boreas]]' wolfpack. Following the repeal of the [[Vision Hunt Decree]], Riftwolves began appearing and making coordinated attacks against the roots of the [[Sacred Sakura]] on [[Narukami Island]], something which greatly troubled Ei as Riftwolves historically served as harbingers of worse terrors during the cataclysm.

===The Traveler's Journey===
It has been heavily suggested that the Traveler's journey will be intricately linked to the events of the cataclysm. The most obvious indication is the Gnostic Chorus trailer, in which Venti's narration suggests that the second heir &mdash; "your story to be told" &mdash; is the player and by extension, the Traveler.

The description for Mondstadt [[Statues of The Seven]] says that the statue "anticipates the arrival of a noble soul [...] while thousand winds of time will soon unfold a new story." This "noble soul" is likely the Traveler, and it might not be a coincidence that both the Traveler<ref name="AQ0-0" /> and Venti<ref>{{Ref/CS|Venti|2}}</ref> woke up a few months before the start of the game. In the Gnostic Chorus trailer, both heirs start their journey in Mondstadt based on the background in the corresponding scene, which is also where the Traveler begins theirs.

When the Traveler confronts Zhongli about the destruction of Khaenri'ah and their sibling's relation to it, Zhongli refuses to divulge any information on account of his contract but appears to acknowledge the sibling: ''"If you take the same road as that person, there may be more difficulties ahead. But as long as you firmly believe that you are on the right path... everything has meaning."''<ref name="ZL2-4" />

==Related Material==
===Gnostic Chorus===
[[File:Story Teaser- Gnostic Chorus - English Voice-Over - Genshin Impact|thumb]]
{{Quote|"An atrous sun befell its kingdom and a luminous pearl lost its glow."<ref group="Translation Note">The original Chinese version says {{zh|古国黑日落，明珠失其光}}, which may be intended to be read as "The ancient kingdom's atrous sun [black sun/eclipse] fell; the luminous pearl lost its glow." In this case, "atrous (black) sun" is referring to Khaenri'ah's {{Lang|Eclipse Dynasty|zh=黑日王朝}}, which was its ruling dynasty when the cataclysm occurred. The sentence is vague on whether the luminous pearl belonged to Khaenri'ah or not.</ref><br>
"Niveous silk grew dim and wheaten gold burned brilliantly no more."|Breeze Amidst the Forest, about the fall of Khaenri'ah
}}
The Gnostic Chorus story teaser that plays at the start of every new [[Battle Pass]] period may contain a link to the story of Celestia, Teyvat, Khaenri'ah, and by extension, the cataclysm.<ref group="Lore Discrepancy">It is difficult to identify a unified theme between the [[Gnostic Hymn Series]] weapons' descriptions, even though they supposedly comprise the Battle Pass story. [[The Black Sword]] and [[The Viridescent Hunt]]'s stories are set during the cataclysm; [[Deathmatch]] and [[Serpent Spine]] both record stories of people who lived 1000 years ago, while [[Solar Pearl]]'s era is unknown. Because there is no overt commonality between them, they may be linked to the overall narrative of the ''Hymn of the Pearl'', the real-life work that the Gnostic Chorus is based on. (See [[#Trivia|Trivia]] for details.)</ref> It is narrated by [[Venti]] in such a way that suggests that he is speaking to the player (and thus, the Traveler), while the background in the scene where either heir sets off on their journey has Mondstadt's visual cues &mdash; a forest, dandelions, and a mountain that strongly resembles Dragonspine.

The story teaser includes two heirs. Venti narrates that the story of the second heir is the story of the player (and thus, the Traveler). However, the first heir became the queen of the Kingdom of Darkness. The first heir's identity and her relationship to the Traveler &mdash; if any exists &mdash; are unknown.

Furthermore, the Gnostic Chorus teaser mentions a "Genesis Pearl," while [[Breeze Amidst the Forest]] mentions "a luminous pearl." The significance of this pearl and the reason why the "kingdom among the heavens" in the Gnostic Chorus teaser is seeking it out are unknown.

=== The Pale Princess and the Six Pygmies ===
The Abyss Order holds a vested interest in the fairytale [[The Pale Princess and the Six Pygmies]] due to a "secret" allegedly contained within it.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lost Book|quote=I was unaware that anyone in Mondstadt was concerned with unearthing the secret hidden inside this book...}}</ref> However, their attempt to steal the book indicates that even they don't fully understand the contents of this series, so the exact nature of its secret is unknown.

One theory holds that this story may be allegorical for Khaenri'ah from the perspective of the people of Teyvat. Like the perpetually-dark Land of Night, Khaenri'ah was inhospitable and lifeless as a result of being an underground kingdom where light doesn't reach, which was why they turned to alchemy for plant life.<ref name="albedo5">{{Ref/CS|Albedo|5}}</ref> The Night Mother may be based on "Gold" Rhinedottir, who was the origin of the monsters and described as a "great sinner," just as the Night Mother is called "the source of all sins."

==Trivia==
* During the earlier [[Beta|Closed Beta Test]]s, the cataclysm occurred 100 years before the start of the game's story. It was changed to 500 by the time of the game's official release, but some in-game text has not been changed accordingly, whether in Chinese or English. The most notable cases where the timeframe has not been updated are [[Breeze Amidst the Forest]] (Vol. 2) and some [[Skyward Series]] weapon descriptions.
* In [https://youtu.be/uwNXNHazS-I Collected Miscellany - "Venti: Skyward Sonnet,"] Dainsleif, the narrator, says, "A thousand years have passed since the God of Anemo left this land &mdash; But to me, it has only been half that time." Aside from almost certainly being related to certain events in the cataclysm due to the timeframe (500 years ago), it is currently unclear exactly what Dainsleif meant by this line.
* The Gnostic Chorus story teaser is a retelling of the {{w|Hymn of the Pearl}}, a passage in the ''{{w|Acts of Thomas}}''. The Hymn of the Pearl has been interpreted as a Gnostic allegory for their view of the {{w|human condition}}: We are lost amidst the material world and consumed by worldly desires, which prevents us from achieving {{w|gnosis}} (divine wisdom) and transcending the mortal world.
** Major differences between the Gnostic Chorus and the Hymn of the Pearl:
*** The protagonist of Hymn of the Pearl comes from an unspecified kingdom, while the land he seeks to take the pearl from is Egypt. In the Gnostic Chorus, those seeking the pearl hail from a "kingdom established among the heavens," while the pearl is located in the "Kingdom of Darkness."
*** In the Hymn of the Pearl, the protagonist is the second son of the "king of kings;" his older brother is mentioned as the "second in command" and the "viceroy" of their parents' kingdom, and the protagonist would join him if he succeeds in his task of retrieving the pearl. In the Gnostic Chorus, the one who seeks the pearl first is the first crowned heir, while the second crowned heir's story is yet unfinished.
*** Nobody else is assigned the task of retrieving the pearl in the Hymn of the Pearl: the protagonist's parents, realizing his plight, write him a letter (a metaphor for gnosis) that reminds him of his true heritage and his original task.
** A common theme between the [[Gnostic Hymn Series]] weapons is that each weapon's original wielder either lost sight of, gave up, or was otherwise led astray from their original path or goal &mdash; typically as a result of someone else's influence, much like the protagonist of the Hymn of the Pearl forgot his origins and duty and believed himself to be an Egyptian.
