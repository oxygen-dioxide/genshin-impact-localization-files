The conflicts surrounding the cataclysm primarily revolve around the encroachment of the [[Abyss]] &mdash; an otherworldly power at odds with [[Celestia]]'s power &mdash; and the destruction of [[Khaenri'ah]], a nation that lived without the influence of the [[gods]]. While the exact order of events is unknown, monsters carrying Abyssal power spewed forth from Khaenri'ah and wreaked havoc throughout [[Teyvat]]. Khaenri'ah's attempt to rebel against the gods ended with its destruction at the hands of the gods and the Heavenly Principles. This led survivors from the fallen nation to bear grudges against Celestia and the [[The Seven|Seven Archons]], while The Seven themselves grew embittered towards Celestia. Two of the Teyvat Chapter's main antagonistic groups, the [[Abyss Order]] and the [[Fatui]], were established as a direct response to Celestia's actions.<ref name="AQ1-4-3">{{Ref/Quest|Dishonorable Trial}}</ref><ref name="PF">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Pale Flame}}</ref>

The exact circumstances surrounding the cataclysm remain a mystery, but it is linked to the "truth of this world." The [[Traveler]]'s journey is to uncover said truth, during which they will learn more about the cataclysm.

''Note:'' Because the ''Genshin Impact'' story has deliberately left information surrounding the cataclysm vague, this page contains information that is confirmed to be about the cataclysm as well as information that is suggested, but not confirmed, to be about the cataclysm.

{{Transclude|section=1|Timeline|TimelineNote}}

==Possible Causes==
The order of events and causes of the cataclysm are currently unclear, although a few perspectives have been presented throughout the game.

===Celestia's Role===
Two concepts closely associated with Celestia have been brought up regarding Khaenri'ah's destruction: sin and the [[Heavenly Principles]] (also referred to as "destiny"). Based on lore surrounding [[Orobashi]] and the people of [[Enkanomiya]], "sin" consists of both knowledge and actions deemed subversive in Celestia's eyes. The exact nature of the Heavenly Principles is a mystery, but it seems to be linked to the concepts of the relentless flow of time and the impermanence of the mortal realm.

[[Pierro]], the first of the [[Eleven Fatui Harbingers]], mentions that the "sages" from his home country &mdash; likely Khaenri'ah<ref group="Assumption">While unconfirmed, there are several indications that Pierro came from Khaenri'ah through [[Mocking Mask]]'s description and his physical appearance in ''[[A Winter Night's Lazzo]]''.</ref> &mdash; tore away the "veil of sin," thereby "ushering in a tide of divine wrath, destruction, and foolishness."<ref name="MockMask">{{Ref/Arti|Mocking Mask}}</ref> [[Kaeya]] remarks that all that is left in Khaenri'ah are sinners who "aren't worth talking about,<ref>{{Ref/VO|Kaeya|More About Kaeya: IV}}</ref> Rhinedottir (as Gold) is described as a "sinner"<ref name="SWP">{{Ref/Weapon|Skyward Pride}}</ref><ref name="BAF1" /><ref group="Note">In the original Chinese version of ''Breeze Amidst the Forest, Vol. I'',  where the English localization says "The alchemist known as Gold was corrupted by their own greed and ambition", it instead says {{lang|mini=1|zh=被称为「黄金」的炼金士堕落为了罪人|zh_tl=The alchemist known as Gold fell from grace and became a sinner.}}</ref> and "great sinner."<ref name="CA" />

While Khaenri'ah's sins have not been explicitly stated, Enkanomiya may provide enough information to make some hypotheses. For holding an account of the ancient world in ''[[Before Sun and Moon]]'', which was written by a scribe of [[Istaroth]] and later inadvertently read by Orobashi, all of Watatsumi was pronounced guilty with "four counts of the sin of profanity, and a further eight counts for the sin of deceiving living souls."<ref name="SubterraTrials">{{Ref/Quest|The Subterranean Trials of Drake and Serpent}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/NPC|Eboshi}}</ref> To prevent its people from being collectively punished, Orobashi agreed to take their sins on itself and go to its death to the pay the price, and banned the book. Shortly before revealing himself to be an Abyss Lector and attacking the [[Traveler]], Enjou tells them that he is "one such sinner — one who has committed the sins of deception and betrayal."<ref name="SubterraTrials" />

The Heavenly Principles, meanwhile, are something both [[The Seven]] and the Abyss Order view in a negative light. While recounting the events of the cataclysm and how they led to her current obsession with Eternity, [[Ei]] says she saw "a nation stride forward and lose everything to the Heavenly Principles."<ref name="Promise of a People's Dream">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/hQ5GEOlwLUQ Story Teaser: Promise of a People's Dream]</ref> After the remains of [[Makoto]]'s power is used to plant the [[Sacred Sakura]] in the past, Makoto says: ''Eternity extends time into infinity, dreams illuminate each moment within. When both shine in unison, the Sacred Sakura blooms from the darkness, finally free from the clutches of the Heavenly Principles.'' Furthermore, Ei's dialogue afterwards suggests that Istaroth had a hand in Makoto's ability to <ref name="RadiSakura">{{Ref/Quest|Radiant Sakura}}</ref>

Several other figures have voiced their opinion that Celestia's punishment of Khaenri'ah was cruel and unjust. It is the reason why the [[Traveler's Sibling]] seeks to wage endless war against "destiny" until the "thrones" are toppled, and why the [[Tsaritsa]] seeks to rebel against the divine and create a new world.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Polar Star}}</ref><ref name="Lazzo">YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmaAOV4SJNQ Teyvat Chapter Interlude Teaser: A Winter Night's Lazzo]</ref> To oppose both the Abyss Order and Celestia, the Tsaritsa established the Fatui, with Pierro as its first member.

At the same time, Celestia's attack may have been triggered by Khaenri'ah's actions. Dainsleif warns the Traveler against "trying to overthrow them [the gods], or hunt[ing] them down," despite previously voicing his disdain towards them. When the Traveler questions his contradictory statements, he explains that he wants to avoid repeating the "failings of my forebears."<ref name="AQ1-4-3" /> Pierro's statement about how the sages of his nation "ushered in" the destruction wrought on them suggests he believes they had some culpability in causing their own destruction.<ref name="MockMask" /> While musing to himself before [[La Signora]]'s funeral, he alludes to these same sages, saying "The sages think themselves to be all-knowing, but we [the Fatui] alone are wise to the virtue in those acts of folly."<ref name="Lazzo" /><ref group="Note">This same quote was used in a Chinese-only official teaser for the Eleven Fatui Harbingers before [[Tartaglia]]'s playable release.</ref>

===Khaenri'ah's Impudence===
The Kingdom of Khaenri'ah was established as a nation without gods around the time the ancient civilization [[Sal Vindagnyr]] fell,<ref name="Scribe's Box">{{Ref/Item|Scribe's Box}}</ref><ref group="Assumption">Currently, Khaenri'ah is the only known nation that was established with the intention of living without gods.</ref> and its inhabitants considered their nation to be the "pride of humanity." Khaenri'ah's existence and its goal of living independently from the gods were not secrets in Teyvat.<ref name="Scribe's Box" /><ref name="Jean">{{Ref/VO|Jean|Jean's Hobbies}}</ref> Traces of their technological achievements &mdash; such as [[Ruin Machines]] &mdash; appeared in Teyvat as early as 3,700 years ago and were collected by [[Guizhong]] during her research into mechanics.<ref name="Voyage Sanguine">{{Ref/Domain|Voyage to the Sanguine Sky}}</ref><ref group="Assumption">Because Ruin Machines were developed by the people of Khaenri'ah, the fact that Guizhong was able to collect some before she died 3,700 years ago indicates that Khaenri'ah already existed by then.</ref>

People of Khaenri'ah suspected that the so-called "gods" were in fact alien to this world and had usurped it from its original denizens,<ref name="SubterraTrials" /> and began plotting to rebel against and overthrow the gods.<ref name="AQ1-4-3" /> They developed [[Automatons]] now known as Ruin Machines as a means to fight against Celestia, and originally knew "[[Ruin Guard]]s" as "Field Tillers," as they believed that ''"The land is not to be tilled with farming tools, but rather to be fought for with steel and blood."''<ref name="AQ1-4-2">{{Ref/Quest|A Herald Without Adherents}}</ref>

During the [[Archon War]], shortly before the last people in [[Enkanomiya]] were going to emigrate to [[Watatsumi Island]], diplomats from Khaenri'ah traveled to Enkanomiya to find evidence that the gods were usurpers. They attempted to steal the forbidden book ''[[Before Sun and Moon]]'', which held an account of the ancient world ruled by the [[Primordial One]] up until its clash with the [[Second Who Came]], but failed to make away with it due to [[Antei]]'s intervention.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Collection of Dragons and Snakes}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Antigonus}}</ref>

===The Art of Khemia===
The [[Art of Khemia]], a form of [[alchemy]] developed in Khaenri'ah that allows for the creation of life itself, has also been hinted as a cause for Khaenri'ah's destruction.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Venti|About Albedo}}</ref>

While it was originally used to survive underground where no plants could grow normally,<ref name="albedo5" /> its capabilities proved to be Khaenri'ah's undoing. The alchemist "Gold" [[Rhinedottir]]<ref name="the snowy past" /> became a "sinner" and unleashed their creations, an "army of shadowy monsters" that included the dark dragon [[Durin]], on Teyvat.<ref name="BAF1" /> These creations, empowered by an "all-consuming darkness" capable of tainting even the powers of The Seven,<ref>{{Ref/Item|Grain of Aerosiderite}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Item|Bit of Aerosiderite}}</ref> destroyed all in their path.<ref name="CA" /> Eventually, even the [[Eclipse Dynasty]], the reigning dynasty in Khaenri'ah at the time, fell.<ref name="BAF1" />

Rhinedottir's unknown motivations for unleashing her creations and causing widespread destruction adds further ambiguity to the situation; it is hard to tell whether her actions caused Celestia to attack, if her actions were a response to Celestia's attack, or the two events were an untimely coincidence. The people of [[Mondstadt]] characterized Durin as a wicked, evil dragon who attacked the land out of jealousy, and was only felled by the combined powers of Barbatos and [[Dvalin]].<ref name="BAF1" /><ref name="SWP" /> However, Durin's perspective tells a very different story: He was under the impression that his "Mother" sent him aboveground to display his "beauty"<ref name="FstDsr" /> but seemed to be unconscious of his actions and the destruction he caused once he reached Mondstadt, and he only awoke from his "slumber" when Dvalin's fangs fatally pierced his neck. Durin even expresses remorse that he did not meet Dvalin and Barbatos under different circumstances.<ref name="DgspSpr" />

While many sources such as books and item descriptions pin the creation of the mutated monsters on Rhinedottir and imply that she was a major catalyst of the cataclysm, this idea is not corroborated by Khaenri'ah survivors. Dainsleif and Pierro both acknowledge that Khaenri'ah had some responsibility for the events that occurred, but they attribute the nation's fateful decisions to a group of people and not to a single person.

===The Arrival of Outlanders===
While not necessarily a cause of the cataclysm, the [[Traveler]] and the Traveler's Sibling traveled to Teyvat around the time of the cataclysm following the destruction of their home world.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Sword of Descension}}</ref> This makes outlanders involved in at least three massively destructive events that occurred in this world,<ref group="Note">There are suggestions that the war between the Primordial One and the Second Who Came, recorded in ''Before Sun and Moon'', is the same event as the fall of the Moon Sisters and the Seelie that has been referenced in several Teyvat books. Assuming the two events are the same, there are four major events involving outlanders; assuming they are different events that were similarly destructive, there are five events.</ref> although not all of the incidents necessarily involved world travelers.

The first known case is the arrival of the [[Primordial One]] (the "eternal throne of the heavens"), who descended from another world and vanquished the old rulers of the world, the [[Seven Sovereigns]], with the help of its shining shades. (Istaroth is believed to be one of those shades.) The Primordial One was later challenged by the [[Second Who Came]] (the "second throne of the heavens"), leading to a bitter war that destroyed the heavens and earth. The unified human civilization that once existed was divided in the process, causing the region of Enkanomiya to fall into the ocean. Following the war, the path between Enkanomiya and the surface world was severed.<ref name="BSAM">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2}}</ref>

The second known case, although possibly related to the first, is an ancient catastrophe that led to the death of the [[Moon Sisters]], the fall of the [[Seelie]] civilization, and the creation of [[The Chasm]] via the fallen solar chariot (or meteor). According to legend, one of the Seelie's ancestors fell in love with an outlander and they pledged their union in the Lunar Palace. Thirty days later, the world fell to ruin and after attempting to flee, the lovers were caught, permanently separated, and had their memories wiped.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Records of Jueyun|4}}</ref> Meanwhile, the Moon Sisters turned on each other and all died in the ensuing conflict, with only one sister's corpse continuing to illuminate the sky,<ref>{{Ref/Book|Moonlit Bamboo Forest|3}}</ref> while the Seelie faded away into their current forms out of grief. The solar chariot (or meteor) crashed into the area that is now [[The Chasm]], where it stayed until it leapt back into the heavens during the Archon War.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Records of Jueyun|6}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Arti|Solar Relic}}</ref>

The third case is [[Sal Vindagnyr]], another prosperous civilization that had direct liaison with Celestia. It met its end after its [[Irminsul]] tree was abruptly destroyed by the [[Skyfrost Nail]],<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Frostbearer}}</ref> causing the once-verdant land to be engulfed by blizzards and making it inhospitable. During this time, an outlander named [[Imunlaukr]] was living in Sal Vindagnyr and had a close relationship with its [[Princess of Sal Vindagnyr|princess]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Snow-Tombed Starsilver}}</ref> While Imunlaukr is unlikely to be a world traveler, he is another example of an outlander who serves as a major character during the end days of a once-prosperous civilization.

The fourth case is the cataclysm itself. The Traveler's Sibling is closely entwined with Khaenri'ah's story and seeks to avenge its destruction at Celestia's hands. They were once close with [[Dainsleif]] and journeyed across Teyvat with him for a time before presumably learning about the "truth of this world." After witnessing Khaenri'ah's destructions, the twins attempted to leave Teyvat before the [[Unknown God]] appeared before them to stop them from leaving. While her motivations are unclear, she introduces herself as the "sustainer of Heavenly Principles" and makes it a point to call the twins "outlanders" as she confronts them.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Wanderer's Trail}}</ref>

===Other Potential Causes===
While his exact deeds are a mystery, the [[kitsune]] [[Urakusai]] is believed to have had some involvement in the Abyss' attack during the cataclysm. After discovering what he had done, the [[Kitsune Saiguu]] angrily banished him to parts unknown, then moved to [[Tenshukaku]] in preparation for the Abyss' attack.<ref name="NCotSK6">{{Ref/Book|New Chronicles of the Six Kitsune|5}}</ref>

==The Cataclysm in Teyvat==
===Mondstadt===
After monsters began emerging from Khaenri'ah, the [[Knights of Favonius]], led by Grand Master [[Arundolyn]] and his anticipated successor [[Rostam]], went on an expedition to Khaenri'ah to fight the monsters.<ref name="BH sands">{{Ref/Arti|Fortitude of the Brave}}</ref> Rostam died during the expedition, leaving Arundolyn and [[Rosalyne-Kruzchka Lohefalter]], who was studying at [[Sumeru Akademiya]] when he died, greatly bereaved. Arundolyn gave up fighting and retired from the Knights of Favonius out of grief,<ref name="FGS" /> while Rosalyne used her knowledge to transform her body into that of living flame and enact her vengeance against the monsters, becoming known as the "Crimson Witch of Flames."<ref name="CWoF">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Crimson Witch of Flames}}</ref>

Meanwhile, Mondstadt was attacked by a corrupted [[Durin]], who was created<ref name="the snowy past" /><ref name="chalk-prince-afterword">{{Ref/Quest|Afterword}}</ref> and sent to Teyvat by [[Rhinedottir]].<ref name="CA">{{Ref/Item|Chunk of Aerosiderite}}</ref><ref name="SWP" /><ref name="FstDsr">{{Ref/Weapon|Festering Desire}}</ref><ref name="SWS">{{Ref/Weapon|Skyward Spine}}</ref><ref name="SWS" /><ref name="BAF2">{{Ref/Book|Breeze Amidst the Forest|2}}</ref><ref name="SWB">{{Ref/Weapon|Skyward Blade}}</ref> As Arundolyn had given up fighting after Rostam's death, there was no Lionfang Knight to lead in battle and no one strong enough to take on Durin.<ref name="FGS">{{Ref/Weapon|Favonius Greatsword}}</ref><ref name="BAF2" /><ref name="DW" /><ref name="FS">{{Ref/Weapon|Ferrous Shadow}}</ref><ref name="FSWD">{{Ref/Weapon|Favonius Sword}}</ref> The people of Mondstadt cried out for help and were heard by the [[Anemo Archon]], who called upon Dvalin to fight Durin.

Dvalin defeated the larger dragon but ingested Durin's poisonous blood in the process. Dvalin went to [[Stormterror's Lair|Old Mondstadt]] to recover<ref name="SWP" /><ref name="SWS" /><ref name="BAF2" /><ref name="SWB" /><ref>{{Ref/Item|Dvalin's Claw}}</ref> while Durin fell down on [[Dragonspine]], whose extreme, unnatural cold allowed the power inside Durin to seep into the land of Dragonspine. Even today, Durin's heart in [[Wyrmrest Valley]] appears to still beat.<ref name="DgspSpr">{{Ref/Weapon|Dragonspine Spear}}</ref>

===Liyue===
In Liyue, [[The Chasm]] and [[Dunyu Ruins]] are two known locations majorly impacted by the cataclysm. Monsters poured out of the Chasm and in response, [[Morax]] sent the [[Millelith]] to defend and evacuate the miners. The [[yaksha]] [[Bosacius]], who had once abandoned his duty to defend Liyue after going mad from [[karma]], was drawn to the bloodshed and fought alongside the Millelith. Bosacius, the exorcist [[Boyang]], and some of the Millelith who chose to lead the vanguard ultimately perished in The Chasm after luring the monsters into a mysterious underground palace with the power to negate the power of the Abyss and using the [[Fantastic Compass]] to seal them in the [[The Chasm's Bed|Chasm's Bed]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|End of the Line|quote='''Xiao:''' He fought here. The nameless yaksha from the legends... it was him.}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Tenacity of the Millelith}}</ref> Liyue eventually won the battle, but at the cost of many lives.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Danger All Around}}</ref>

What occurred in Dunyu Ruins is unknown, but its people decided to abandon the city and move to Liyue Harbor; none of the refugees nor adepti have spoken about what happened there.<ref name="RoJ6">{{Ref/Book|Records of Jueyun|6}}</ref>

===Inazuma===
Shortly before the Abyss invaded Teyvat, the [[kitsune]] [[Urakusai]] apparently did something linked to it, which greatly angered the [[Kitsune Saiguu]] and led to his banishment. The Kitsune Saiguu, aware of the impending threat, moved from the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]] to [[Tenshukaku]] to stay close to the Electro Archon, then [[Makoto]].<ref name="NCotSK6" /> Makoto was also aware that something was going to happen in Khaenri'ah, saying that it "was not somewhere that any archon could afford to ignore" after Ei asks her about it long after her death.<ref name="RadiSakura" />

When the Abyss attacked, Makoto and her close allies, [[Ei]], [[Mikoshi Chiyo]], the Kitsune Saiguu, [[Reizenbou]], and [[Takamine the Mistsplitter]] fought back the otherworldly threat but eventually perished or disappeared. Chiyo was consumed by a "beast of sin" and, while she slew the monster from within, was corrupted &mdash; she turned against Ei and fought her, which ended after Ei cut her horns and sword arm off and forced her to flee. The Kitsune Saiguu disappeared and was "consumed" by the Abyss for reasons that are unclear but likely related to the [[Thunder Sakura]]s, which were nearly overwhelmed trying to purify the land during the cataclysm. Reizenbou, enraged by her inability to protect the Kitsune Saiguu, left on a self-imposed exile. Takamine disappeared in a battle against the dark forces, only to be killed by his former lover [[Asase Hibiki]] when he finally resurfaced many years later.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Thundering Pulse}}</ref> Makoto was slain in battle in what is suggested to be Khaenri'ah, dying in her sister's arms.<ref name="Promise of a People's Dream" />

===Sumeru===
Sumeru was apparently affected by the cataclysm later than other countries such as Mondstadt.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Witch's End Time}}</ref><ref name="EftE">{{Ref/Weapon|Elegy for the End}}</ref> However, the Dendro Archon, [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]], was slain during cataclysm, which caused [[Viridescent]] to no longer be able to hear the grass and trees speak.<ref name="VV sands">{{Ref/Arti|Viridescent Venerer's Determination}}</ref>

==The Cataclysm in Khaenri'ah==
The clash between Celestia and The Seven versus Khaenri'ah ended with the gods' victory. As punishment for losing, the [[Eclipse Dynasty]] was wiped out. Dainsleif, a knight of the royal family, was cursed with immortality while most citizens of Khaenri'ah were inflicted with a curse that transformed them into monsters and hilichurls.<ref name="AQ1-4-4">{{Ref/Quest|A Soul Set Apart}}</ref><ref name="Requiem" /><!-- specifically, The Grave of the Guarded --> Some people appear to have avoided the curse, such as [[Kaeya]]'s lineage<ref>{{Ref/CS|Kaeya|4}}</ref> and ostensibly [[Rhinedottir]], but their exact circumstances are unknown. Some, like Dainsleif, have some unknown means of retaining their sanity, although it merely mitigates the effects of their curses.

During the disaster, Dainsleif orders [[Halfdan]], an elite of the Royal Guards to protect the people of Khaenri'ah at all costs. However, Halfdan and the other royal guards ended up transforming into [[Shadowy Husks]]. Despite this, Halfdan was able to retain part of his consciousness despite lacking whatever Dainsleif uses to mitigate his own curse.<ref name="Requiem">{{Ref/Quest|Requiem of the Echoing Depths}}</ref>

The exact fates of all of the cursed people has been left ambiguous, but many turned into hilichurls.<ref name="Requiem" /><!-- specifically, The Grave of the Guarded --> [[Paimon]] also concludes from the account given by the Traveler's Sibling that the monsters of the Abyss Order were originally the people of Khaenri'ah,<ref name="AQ1-4-4" /> which appears to be supported by the Pyro Abyss Lector [[Enjou]]'s search for ''Before Sun and Moon'', mirroring the Khaenri'ah delegation's search from at least 2,000 years ago. As a result of the curse, Dainsleif no longer views hilichurls or Abyss monsters as human.<ref name="AQ1-4-2" /><!-- "despite being far from human" --><ref name="Requiem" /><!-- specifically, Memories of Inteyvat --> It is still unclear what the suggested link between the hilichurls' Eclipse Tribe and Khaenri'ah's Eclipse Dynasty<ref>{{Ref/VO|Traveler|About the Eclipse Tribe}}</ref> means.

After the Traveling Twins arrived in Teyvat, Traveler's Sibling awoke first and eventually bore witness to Khaenri'ah's destruction.<ref name="WWBR">Story Teaser: [[:File:Genshin Impact Story Teaser We Will Be Reunited (Contains spoilers)|We Will Be Reunited]]</ref> At some point in time, they also traveled throughout Teyvat with [[Dainsleif]],<ref name="AQ1-4-4" /> but when exactly this occurred relative to the cataclysm is currently unclear.

==Aftermath==
[[File:UnknownGodFight.png|thumb|The traveling twins fight the Unknown God]]
Across the world, there was a sudden surge in hilichurl population following the cataclysm.<ref name="AHili" /><ref>{{Ref/NPC|Glory}}</ref>

===Khaenri'ah===
With Khaenri'ah in ruins, the Traveler's Sibling rushed back to where the Traveler still lay unconscious and woke them up, hoping to leave Teyvat as quickly as possible. The Traveler briefly witnessed the destroyed nation themselves before the two eventually set foot in Celestia as they attempted to leave.<ref group="Assumption">It can be assumed that the location of the opening cutscene is Celestia, based on the [[Symbols in Teyvat#Celestial Motif|"Celestial motif"]] found on the architecture in the cutscene, on the architecture in the game's title screen (which, based on their appearance, is the same location as the opening cutscene), on the Skyfrost Nail and [[Chasm Nail]], and on fully-upgraded [[Statues of The Seven]].</ref> There, they were confronted by the Unknown God, who easily overpowered them and separated them, sealing the Sibling away first before dealing with the Traveler.<ref name="AQ0-0">{{Ref/Quest|Wanderer's Trail}}</ref>

Without their masters, Khaenri'ah's automatons spread all over Teyvat, becoming particularly drawn to ruins and thereby becoming known as Ruin Machines.<ref name="AQ1-4-2" /> The Abyss Order was formed with the intent of overthrowing Celestia and laying waste to the surface world under their dominion.<ref name="AQ1-4-4" /> Meanwhile, despite his anger towards The Seven, Dainsleif viewed the Abyss Order as the greater threat and became their vehement opponent.<ref name="AQ1-4-2" /> Pierro, who had opposed the sages' plan from the start, sided with the Tsaritsa and her objective of creating a "new world," becoming the first of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers. The [[Alberich Clan]] stepped up as regents after the King [[Irmin]]'s strength failed, although they were unable to revive Khaenri'ah.<ref>Event [[Hidden Strife]] Optional Letter: [[Hidden Strife/Story#The Brick|The Brick]]</ref>

Not only did Rhinedottir emerge from the cataclysm alive, she went on to create her second masterpiece, the synthetic human [[Albedo]]. When questioned about his link to the fallen nation, Albedo reassures the Traveler that he was created long after its destruction and that, as a "pure alchemist" like Rhinedottir who lives for academic knowledge, he has no particular attachment to it.<ref name="the snowy past">{{Ref/Quest|The Snowy Past}}</ref> Whether this reflects Rhinedottir's opinion on Khaenri'ah has yet to be seen.

===Mondstadt===
Rosalyne continued fighting against monsters, but her indiscriminate destruction caused many to become fearful of her. Before her flames could consume her heart and kill her, she was discovered by Pierro, who gave her a [[Delusion]] to suppress the flames and a psychological "delusion" that swayed her to join the Fatui's cause.

The White Knight Rostam mentored<ref name="DW">{{Ref/Arti|Guardian's Band}}</ref> survived the expedition and continued fighting against monsters. However, he became engrossed with the physical sensation of slaughter and became known as the [[Bloodstained Knight]]. Realizing he no longer had a place amongst humanity, he ventured into the Abyss intending to die in battle, only to learn about their origins: the "ultimate injustice" that cursed the people of Khaenri'ah into transforming into monsters. The Bloodstained Knight then pledged his allegiance to the Abyss, and his fate thereafter is unknown.<ref name="BSC">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Bloodstained Chivalry}}</ref><ref name="TBS">{{Ref/Weapon|The Black Sword}}</ref>

At some point in Mondstadt's history, the first [[Field Tiller]] &mdash; a prototype for the automatons now known as Ruin Guards &mdash; somehow ended up in Mondstadt and wandered into [[Andrius]]' proving ground. Initially mistaking the war machine for a challenger, Andrius fought against it and eventually greatly damaged it. It then fled to [[Decarabian]]'s tower, where it proceeded to fire missiles at anyone who approached the area. The people of Mondstadt, who did not know about Khaenri'ah's advanced technology, mistook these attacks as the vestiges of Decarabian's wrath and entitled the phenomenon "The Tyrant's Final Fury." However, around a year after the attacks began, they suddenly ceased as the Field Tiller lost functionality. People thereafter determined it was likely not Decarabian's doing, as he was the God of Storms and was unlikely to use fire-based attacks, but did not investigate the issue further.<ref name="AQ1-4-3" />

===Liyue===
In Liyue, the battle against monsters led to a renaissance in weaponsmithing and catalyst creation after people discovered the weapons up until the cataclysm were not suitable for combat against such creatures.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Prototype Amber}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Prototype Starglitter}}</ref> This renaissance continued even after the end of the monster onslaught and led to the development of the [[Prototype Series]] and [[Blackcliff Series]] weapons.

===Inazuma===
With Makoto's death, Ei became the new Electro Archon. Having lost many of her close allies over the course of the conflict, and fearful after witnessing her sister's death and "that thing,"<ref>{{Ref/VO|Raiden Shogun|More About Ei: V}}</ref> Ei became fixated on Eternity and hoped to preserve the current Inazuma forever. Disillusioned with Celestia after witnessing Khaenri'ah's fate,<ref name="Promise of a People's Dream" /> she severed ties with Celestia and ultimately gave her [[Gnosis]] to [[Yae Miko]] for safekeeping.<ref name="AQ2-3-8">{{Ref/Quest|Wishes (Quest)}}</ref>

Afraid that she was susceptible to [[erosion]], Ei conducted experiments into creating an automaton in her likeness, which would rule Inazuma in her stead while Ei would isolate herself in her personal world, the [[Plane of Euthymia]], meditating to stave off erosion.

The Tsaritsa, embittered by what transpired, cut ties with Venti<ref name="AQ0-3-8">{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref> (and potentially the other Archons) and established the Fatui to combat the Abyss Order and to one day overthrow Celestia, with Pierro as the first of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers. Pierro took the initiative in recruiting powerful individuals, including La Signora and Scaramouche, granting them Delusions to bolster their abilities. The Tsaritsa also granted her Harbingers god-like executive authority, although it is unclear whether this refers to Delusions or if it is a separate power.<ref name="AQ0-3-8" />

==Present Day==
Despite the cataclysm's large impact on the continent, knowledge about it is scarcely encountered in-game and much of its events have been dismissed as outlandish legend by modern-day people. Merely two books mention the cataclysm, while only a handful of NPCs talk about it.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Glory}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Facing Distant Echoes}}</ref> Even some Fatui members, despite knowing about the threat of the Abyss and fighting it firsthand, do not believe that their conflict has lasted over 500 years.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Company Vanishing Into the Deep}}</ref> [[Jean]] mentions Khaenri'ah,<ref name="Jean" /> but her knowledge of the cataclysm seems to be limited to the tale of Dvalin and Durin, which she learned from [[Diluc]]<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Behind the Scenes}}</ref> after Venti revealed it to him.<ref name="AQ0-2-7">{{Ref/Quest|Wild Escape}}</ref> Paimon also states the Traveler has rummaged through old books searching for information about Khaenri'ah and the cataclysm, with little success.<ref name="AQ1-4-2" /> (It may be notable, however, that five-sixths of the [[Mondstadt Library]]'s collection, which was once the largest in northern Teyvat, was lost following a large fire at an unknown point in time.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Favonius Codex}}</ref>)

Information about the cataclysm primarily comes from [[books]]; artifact, weapon, and item descriptions; or first-hand sources like the Archons or Khaenri'ah survivors. Venti recounts the story of Durin and Dvalin to an audience<ref>{{Ref/Quest|That Green Fellow}}</ref> but does not say when it occurred. After he plays the same song to Diluc, Diluc asks what he "witnessed" &mdash; implying Venti may have given him a vision of the battle &mdash; then states "This is confidential information."<ref name="AQ0-2-7" /> Meanwhile, [[Zhongli]] has a contract that prevents him from speaking about the events of the cataclysm,<ref name="ZL2-4">{{Ref/Quest|Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved}}</ref> while the adepti refused to speak about the events that led Dunyu Ruins to be abandoned.<ref name="RoJ6" /> Ei admits that she still feels fear over what happened during the cataclysm, citing in particular, "...[[Makoto|Her demise]] and that ''thing''", though does not offer much more information as she only arrived after the worst of the fighting and was not herself the Electro Archon at the time.

While their numbers had dwindled since the cataclysm, [[Riftwolves]] (creations of Gold that have the ability to erode the world's boundaries) began appearing on the abandoned [[Tsurumi Island]] of Inazuma. More recently, they have appeared as far away as Mondstadt, where they have begun encroaching on [[Wolvendom]], the territory of [[Andrius]]' wolfpack. Following the repeal of the [[Vision Hunt Decree]], Riftwolves began appearing and making coordinated attacks against the roots of the [[Sacred Sakura]] on [[Narukami Island]], something which greatly troubled Ei as Riftwolves historically served as harbingers of worse terrors during the cataclysm.

===The Traveler's Journey===
It has been heavily suggested that the Traveler's journey will be intricately linked to the events of the cataclysm. The most obvious indication is the Gnostic Chorus trailer, in which Venti's narration suggests that the second heir &mdash; "your story to be told" &mdash; is the player and by extension, the Traveler.

The description for Mondstadt [[Statues of The Seven]] says that the statue "anticipates the arrival of a noble soul [...] while thousand winds of time will soon unfold a new story." This "noble soul" is likely the Traveler, and it might not be a coincidence that both the Traveler<ref name="AQ0-0" /> and Venti<ref>{{Ref/CS|Venti|2}}</ref> woke up a few months before the start of the game. In the Gnostic Chorus trailer, both heirs start their journey in Mondstadt based on the background in the corresponding scene, which is also where the Traveler begins theirs.

When the Traveler confronts Zhongli about the destruction of Khaenri'ah and their sibling's relation to it, Zhongli refuses to divulge any information on account of his contract but appears to acknowledge the sibling: ''"If you take the same road as that person, there may be more difficulties ahead. But as long as you firmly believe that you are on the right path... everything has meaning."''<ref name="ZL2-4" />

==Related Material==
===Gnostic Chorus===
[[File:Story Teaser- Gnostic Chorus - English Voice-Over - Genshin Impact|thumb]]
{{Quote|"An atrous sun befell its kingdom and a luminous pearl lost its glow."<ref group="Translation Note">The original Chinese version says {{Lang|mini=1|zh=古国黑日落，明珠失其光}}, which may be intended to be read as "The ancient kingdom's atrous sun [black sun/eclipse] fell; the luminous pearl lost its glow." In this case, "atrous (black) sun" is referring to Khaenri'ah's {{Lang|Eclipse Dynasty|zh=黑日王朝}}, which was its ruling dynasty when the cataclysm occurred. The sentence is vague on whether the luminous pearl belonged to Khaenri'ah or not.</ref><br />

The Gnostic Chorus story teaser that plays at the start of every new [[Battle Pass]] period may contain a link to the story of Celestia, Teyvat, Khaenri'ah, and by extension, the cataclysm.<ref group="Lore Discrepancy">It is difficult to identify a unified theme between the [[Gnostic Hymn Series]] weapons' descriptions, even though they supposedly comprise the Battle Pass story. [[The Black Sword]] and [[The Viridescent Hunt]]'s stories are set during the cataclysm; [[Deathmatch]] and [[Serpent Spine]] both record stories of people who lived 1000 years ago, while [[Solar Pearl]]'s era is unknown. Because there is no overt commonality between them, they may be linked to the overall narrative of the ''Hymn of the Pearl'', the real-life work that the Gnostic Chorus is based on. (See [[#Trivia|Trivia]] for details.)</ref> It is narrated by [[Venti]] in such a way that suggests that he is speaking to the player (and thus, the Traveler), while the background in the scene where either heir sets off on their journey has Mondstadt's visual cues &mdash; a forest, dandelions, and a mountain that strongly resembles Dragonspine.

The story teaser includes two heirs. Venti narrates that the story of the second heir is the story of the player (and thus, the Traveler). However, the first heir became the queen of the Kingdom of Darkness. The first heir's identity and her relationship to the Traveler &mdash; if any exists &mdash; are unknown.

Furthermore, the Gnostic Chorus teaser mentions a "Genesis Pearl," while [[Breeze Amidst the Forest]] mentions "a luminous pearl." The significance of this pearl and the reason why the "kingdom among the heavens" in the Gnostic Chorus teaser is seeking it out are unknown.

=== The Pale Princess and the Six Pygmies ===
The Abyss Order holds a vested interest in the fairytale [[The Pale Princess and the Six Pygmies]] due to a "secret" allegedly contained within it.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Lost Book|quote=I was unaware that anyone in Mondstadt was concerned with unearthing the secret hidden inside this book...}}</ref> However, their attempt to steal the book indicates that even they don't fully understand the contents of this series, so the exact nature of its secret is unknown.

One theory holds that this story may be allegorical for Khaenri'ah from the perspective of the people of Teyvat. Like the perpetually-dark Land of Night, Khaenri'ah was inhospitable and lifeless as a result of being an underground kingdom where light doesn't reach, which was why they turned to alchemy for plant life.<ref name="albedo5">{{Ref/CS|Albedo|5}}</ref> The Night Mother may be based on "Gold" Rhinedottir, who was the origin of the monsters and described as a "great sinner," just as the Night Mother is called "the source of all sins."

==Trivia==
*During the earlier [[Beta|Closed Beta Test]]s, the cataclysm occurred 100 years before the start of the game's story. It was changed to 500 by the time of the game's official release, but some in-game text has not been changed accordingly, whether in Chinese or English. The most notable cases where the timeframe has not been updated are [[Breeze Amidst the Forest]] (Vol. 2) and some [[Skyward Series]] weapon descriptions.
*In [https://youtu.be/uwNXNHazS-I Collected Miscellany - "Venti: Skyward Sonnet"], Dainsleif, the narrator, says, "A thousand years have passed since the God of Anemo left this land &mdash; But to me, it has only been half that time." Aside from almost certainly being related to certain events in the cataclysm due to the timeframe (500 years ago), it is currently unclear exactly what Dainsleif meant by this line.
*The Gnostic Chorus story teaser is a retelling of the {{w|Hymn of the Pearl}}, a passage in the ''{{w|Acts of Thomas}}''. The Hymn of the Pearl has been interpreted as a Gnostic allegory for their view of the {{w|human condition}}: We are lost amidst the material world and consumed by worldly desires, which prevents us from achieving {{w|gnosis}} (divine wisdom) and transcending the mortal world.
**Major differences between the Gnostic Chorus and the Hymn of the Pearl:
***The protagonist of Hymn of the Pearl comes from an unspecified kingdom, while the land he seeks to take the pearl from is Egypt. In the Gnostic Chorus, those seeking the pearl hail from a "kingdom established among the heavens," while the pearl is located in the "Kingdom of Darkness."
***In the Hymn of the Pearl, the protagonist is the second son of the "king of kings;" his older brother is mentioned as the "second in command" and the "viceroy" of their parents' kingdom, and the protagonist would join him if he succeeds in his task of retrieving the pearl. In the Gnostic Chorus, the one who seeks the pearl first is the first crowned heir, while the second crowned heir's story is yet unfinished.
***Nobody else is assigned the task of retrieving the pearl in the Hymn of the Pearl: the protagonist's parents, realizing his plight, write him a letter (a metaphor for gnosis) that reminds him of his true heritage and his original task.
** A common theme between the [[Gnostic Hymn Series]] weapons is that each weapon's original wielder either lost sight of, gave up, or was otherwise led astray from their original path or goal &mdash; typically as a result of someone else's influence, much like the protagonist of the Hymn of the Pearl forgot his origins and duty and believed himself to be an Egyptian.
