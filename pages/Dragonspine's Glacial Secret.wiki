==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(After interacting with the first tablet)
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like this stone tablet is talking about events from the past...
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, it lit up! Paimon wonders if these ruins have any other stone tablets like this one?

;(Interacting with any other tablet)
:'''Paimon:''' This stone tablet's lit up as well...

;(After unlocking all the tablets)
:'''Paimon:''' Phew...This is really tiring. Activating this many tablets should do it, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Come on, (Traveler), let's check out that place with the super huge door again!
{{Dialogue end}}

===Ancient Carvings===
{{Dialogue start}}
# '''Ancient Carvings:''' "...its soul, and [[Starsilver]] its bones. But the one who could wield it, the ice-breaking outlander, [[Imunlaukr|Imunlau]]..."
# '''Ancient Carvings:''' "...attempted to heal the Leylines, but the tree had already withered. After burying the [[Princess of Sal Vindagnyr|princess]]..."
# '''Ancient Carvings:''' "...without result or reply, [[Varuch]] proceeded on to the summit..."
# '''Ancient Carvings:''' "...snow whipped across the skies. The [[Skyfrost Nail|pillar that fell from the heavens]] was riven in three..."
# '''Ancient Carvings:''' "...far from snow and strife, and came upon this verdant paradise. A monument was laid down in this place, and it was named Sal Vind..."
# '''Ancient Carvings:''' "...dreamed of the [[Durin|black dragon]] that blotted down the sun, and knew it to be an omen of doom. That same month, the outlander..."
# '''Ancient Carvings:''' "...guided to where the [[Frostbearing Tree|pale white tree]] stood. That month, the underground waterway..."
# '''Ancient Carvings:''' "...ended. There is no more need for records. Yet I regret nothing more than having been unable to watch her finish the fresco within that great hall..."
{{Dialogue end}}

The Ancient Carvings were presumably written by [[Ukko]], the last scribe for the ancient nation of [[Sal Vindagnyr]].
