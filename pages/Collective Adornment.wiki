===User Terms and Conditions===
* Participants must log in to their HoYoverse Account to browse and use certain functions on this event web page.
* To use the avatar creation function, participants will need to click to confirm that they agree with these terms. Otherwise, they will be unable to use it.
* After participants confirmed that they agree, they will be able to upload local images, edit them, then combine them with participants selected Commemorative Avatar Frame. Once they've been combined, a downloadable image will be generated so participants can save it locally.
* Please do not upload images that are obscene, graphic, discriminatory, insulting, or undermine public order and morality in any other way. HoYoverse only provides the avatar frames themselves as well as the avatar creation function. If any issues arise as a result of created avatars violating the terms outlined here, HoYoverse reserves the right to hold the responsible parties accountable and pursue any resulting losses. This event is also subject to Genshin Impact's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.
* HoYoverse will store avatars uploaded by players to review whether they violate the User Terms and Conditions. They will not be used for any other purpose.
* After combining participants avatar with the avatar frame and claiming the rewards, the in-game rewards will be distributed via in-game mail. The mail will expire after 30 days, so don't forget to claim the rewards in time.
* To be considered successful participants, players must upload their finished avatars (combined with the Anniversary Commemorative Avatar Frame) to X (Twitter), Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, VK, or other social media platforms, then post with the hashtag and their Genshin Impact UID. UIDs will only be used to issue rewards for winning players, and are protected by the relevant personal data protection regulations and policies of different countries/regions.
* To ensure that your participation is deemed successful, please make sure that participants keep their avatar with the Commemorative Avatar Frame up until the event ends.
* This event will be held and judged on multiple platforms. Intertwined Fate rewards will be shared across all platforms, and will not be distributed proportionately between different platforms/regions.
* If the issuance of rewards fails due to the player providing the incorrect UID, the official team will not re-issue said rewards.
