|description  = A swift, fierce fish with spiny fins whose spiny mouth can pierce the current when it swims at full speed. Its capabilities have earned it the nicknames "The Cutter" and "Hard-To-Get."<br />Among sticklebacks, this sort would either count as the proudest, or a rather close second place. They are especially prickly during courtships, where even the slightest breeze or smallest ripple might trip their fuse. A hobbyist once observed one such specimen charging at waving seagrass, as if such flagrant dancing was some major provocation against the stickleback king or something.<br />"If you encounter one underwater, do not look it in the eyes." &mdash; Angler's Atlas, Betta Chapter"

'''Betta''' is a type of [[Stickleback]] that can be located in [[Liyue]]. It can be both found as [[Wildlife]] and as a pet for the [[Serenitea Pot]]. Bettas can be obtained through fishing using {{Item|Redrot Bait|20}}. The fish will only spawn between the hours of 18:00 – 6:00, based on in-game [[time]].

==Trivia==
* The in-game Betta does not seem to resemble the real-life {{w|betta}}. However, it does share its pugnacious nature.
** The Chinese, Japanese, and Korean names instead follow the same naming convention as the [[Lunged Stickleback]].
