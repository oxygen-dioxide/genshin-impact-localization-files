{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nolette:''' *panting* Let's put a few more hours in today...
:{{DIcon}} Need a hand?
::'''Nolette:''' Help? No, no, that wouldn't do. It should be me helping you &mdash; I was one of the [[Palais Mermonia]]'s [[Garde]]s, you know, albeit retired now...
::'''Nolette:''' And even so, I'm still hale and hearty &mdash; why, if a thief were to run by me, I would catch them for sure!
:{{DIcon}} Are you alright?
::'''Nolette:''' Of course I am. Not long ago, in fact, I helped solve a case &mdash; I'm not rusty yet, not by a long shot!
::{{DIcon}} What sort of case was that?
::'''Nolette:''' *sigh* Actually, I spotted a photographer doing business at the plaza some time back, and I went to have a picture taken.
::'''Nolette:''' I walked about until dinner time, and when I was about to eat, I felt someone touch my wallet! Shame that the kid was too quick, though &mdash; I couldn't keep up...
::'''Nolette:''' But just the next day, one of my juniors came up to me and told me that the wallet had been retrieved &mdash; and indeed, the photo taken of me had helped to crack a big case!
::'''Nolette:''' *sigh* It saddens me to say this, but I didn't really help much... If I had been fast enough to catch that fellow then...
::'''Nolette:''' *cough* Don't worry about me, though. My bones are still sturdy! I'll get him next time...
:{{DIcon}} Rest well, then.
::'''Nolette:''' Hmph. I could do this for another 10 hours, no problem!
