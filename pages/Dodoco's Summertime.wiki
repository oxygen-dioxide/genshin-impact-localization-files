Klee's friends will find a way!"<br />...<br />According to [[Albedo]], Ms. [[Alice]] did drop by [[Mondstadt]] shortly after the previous year's summer adventure to discuss her though process back then.<br />The witch's considerations were comprehensive indeed. As she suspected, everyone did in fact rest under this tent for quite some time, and the gadgets within provided significant entertainment while it rained or the nights grew long.<br />As for the large amount of treasure Klee discovered during the exploration, it took no small amount of effort to bring it all back to Mondstadt. For example, using [[Cryo]] to freeze wet ground to better push cargo along, or using [[Solar Isotoma]] to lift weights up to cross hilly terrain... One could say that the transportation process itself was quite the unique experience!
