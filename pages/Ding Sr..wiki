: {{DIcon|Idle}} Tea leaves...
:: {{A|VO Ding Sr. 01.ogg}} "With tea leaves, you gotta have good quality control in place."
{{Dialogue End}}

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ding Sr.:''' Are you here for a tour? It's nice that you're interested in tea, and you'll learn all about it here!
:{{DIcon}} What is this place?
::'''Ding Sr.:''' This is the Qiaoying Village tea workshop. Most of the tea leaves are sent here after being picked.
::'''Ding Sr.:''' You might not realize that tea leaves require several processes and careful handling before they can be used to make tea.
::'''Ding Sr.:''' Simply put, we need to remove the excess moisture in the leaves to deepen their fragrance and make them easier to store.
::'''Ding Sr.:''' Our workshop's in charge of sunning, baking, and then stirring them in a pan.
::'''Ding Sr.:''' Some types are then taken back by the tea farmers for additional processing, such as piling and fermenting.
::'''Ding Sr.:''' If you have time, you should stay in the village for a month or so. That way, you can see the full process, from leaf picking to the moment the tea's served up on tables.
:{{DIcon}} What's the machine in that room over there?
::'''Ding Sr.:''' Ah, you're asking about the stirring machine, yes? Compared to our village's history, the machine is very young.
::'''Ding Sr.:''' We used to use a huge tea cauldron for stirring. They said it was an adeptal mechanism of some sort...
::'''Ding Sr.:''' The traditional process creates a traditional flavor, but we must also meet the quantity demands, so these days our workshop uses new, faster machines.
::'''Ding Sr.:''' That said, with higher efficiency and more heat, the need to ensure quality is even greater.
::'''Ding Sr.:''' That's why people like me, with more than thirty years of experience, are needed to make sure things don't go wrong.
::'''Ding Sr.:''' As for [[Ding Jr.]].. He's got another decade of buckling down and learning this craft ahead, that's for sure...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Ding Sr.:''' Farewell! Come back when you have time. Who knows, maybe you'd be interested in becoming one of us!
----
;(Trample the tea leaves in the center of the room)
:'''Ding Sr.:''' Hey, kiddo. Why is someone who looks as nice as you causing so much trouble?
:'''Ding Sr.:''' This basket is filled with tea leaves that are being dried, not weeds. They're treasures meant for everyone's teacups.
:'''Ding Sr.:''' Don't do something like this again, or [[Uncle Luo]] will be furious if he sees you...
:'''Ding Sr.:''' He might even evict you from Qiaoying Village altogether!
