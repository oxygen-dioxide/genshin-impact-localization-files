|text      = Recently, the Reconnaissance Company has been working round the clock, so they are hardly getting any rest.

I'm pretty used to it, and after all, this all means that the merchant caravans from [[Dornman Port]] are constantly streaming into Mondstadt, and that's worth celebrating.

However, a member of the Company suggested it's time to find an Acting Captain to help take some of the pressure off.

Though I fear he was merely jesting, it also reminded me that I do have the perfect candidate in mind already, and that's you.

If you have time, come visit the Reconnaissance Company's camp. I've prepared some combat rations that could be considered suitably sumptuous...

I'll share the basic principles of commanding the Reconnaissance Company with you, as well as what the Captain should pay special attention to. For an Honorary Knight as special as you, I'm certain it'll be useful someday...
