==Gameplay Notes==
* Co-Op is locked from the first trip in the Waverider<sup>[verification needed]</sup> to after the fight against Liuliu.
* When Liuliu's HP reaches 50%, more Treasure Hoarders will spawn<!--at least if the first wave was defeated; not sure about if the first wave wasn't defeated --> and dialogue will begin. Further fighting is not necessary, as the fight will automatically end when the dialogue finishes.

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Ningguang seems to be thinking about something...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Ningguang at the Jade Chamber)
:{{A|vo dleq001 1 ningguang 01.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' A great many things are still unaccounted for...
:{{DIcon}} Things like what?
:{{A|vo dleq001 1 ningguang 02.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' The new Jade Chamber is missing many of the contents held by its predecessor.
:{{A|vo dleq001 1 ningguang 03.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' All the literature, furniture, and ornaments I had collected followed the original Jade Chamber to its watery grave...
:{{A|vo dleq001 1 ningguang 04.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Most of it was destroyed in the process, and the small handful of items that survived intact are strewn across the water's surface. Reclaiming them is taxing work.
:{{A|vo dleq001 1 ningguang 05.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' It takes someone with sturdy sea legs to handle this job, but even then... I just can't tell whether Beidou will be able to fish out everything herself.
:{{DIcon}} "Fish out"?
:{{A|vo dleq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, so you made Beidou go and fish your stuff out of the sea for you?
:{{A|vo dleq001 1 ningguang 06.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' To claim that I "made" her do anything would be imprecise. We reached a mutually beneficial agreement, as is always the case in our dealings.
:{{DIcon}} You pay Beidou to run errands for you?
:{{A|vo dleq001 1 ningguang 07.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Payment is one aspect of it. But I also compensate her in other ways... Hehe, let's just say it's a little complicated.
:{{A|vo dleq001 1 ningguang 08.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Anyway, Beidou is currently in the Guyun Stone Forest area.
:{{A|vo dleq001 1 ningguang 09.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' If you're interested, go pay her a visit. You may be just the help she needs.

;(Talk to Ningguang again)
:{{A|vo dialog dleq001 ningguang 01.ogg}} '''Ningguang:'''  Beidou is salvaging some of my Jade Chamber collection out of the sea around Guyun Stone Forest. If that sounds like your idea of fun, you should go pay her a visit.

----
;(Approach Beidou at the Alcor)
:{{A|vo dleq001 3 beidou 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Ugh, Ningguang... you're really trying my patience...
:{{A|vo dleq001 3 beidou 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' I'm sorry, but if the Jade Chamber smashed into smithereens when it hit the sea, then so did everything inside it. Just because I know the ocean doesn't mean I have the power to fish up the past...
:{{DIcon}} ...The salvaging is going pretty smoothly, then?
:{{A|vo dleq001 3 beidou 03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Oh, Traveler. What're you doing out this way?
:{{DIcon}} I'm here to help out.
:{{A|vo dleq001 3 beidou 04.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Great! You couldn't have picked a better time. The whole fleet's caught up with other things right now, so I'll take all the help I can get.
:{{A|vo dleq001 3 beidou 05.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Look, I even had to rope [[Xinyan]] into this.
:{{DIcon}} Whoa, Xinyan's here!
:{{A|vo dleq001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, what's the occasion? Did you come all the way out here to do a performance?
:{{A|vo dleq001 3 xinyan 01.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' You bet I did! Nothing official, mind you. Beidou wanted to hold a feast onboard and I agreed to come play a couple o' tunes.
:;(If the player has not met Xinyan yet, an introductory note appears on screen)
::Xinyan – Blazing Riff
::Xinyan, a rock musician based in Liyue, uses her music as a form of resistance against societal stereotypes.
::Her tunes are well-loved, and the style of her tunes is much like she is: straightforward, generous, confident, and proud.
::Every time she steps onto her personally-designed stage, loyal fans will come flocking and start to rock to her rhythm.
::If you hear cheers and fireworks go up at any place in Liyue Harbor at the same time, it's most likely Xinyan, so don't miss out!
:{{A|vo dleq001 3 xinyan 02.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' But all that went out the window when someone showed up saying they were one of Ningguang's secretaries. They called Beidou away.
:{{A|vo dleq001 3 beidou 06.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' I think it was [[Baiwen]], or [[Baixiao]]...? Ugh, well it was Bai-something.
:{{A|vo dleq001 3 beidou 07.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Anyway. Ningguang apparently came up with the bright idea of me going out on the sea and salvaging a bunch of her old valuables. She seems pretty willing to shell out for it, too.
:{{A|vo dleq001 3 beidou 08.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Hmph... Well, at the end of the day, the price was right. So yeah, we took the work.
:{{A|vo dleq001 3 beidou 09.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Now, if we're gonna go trawling for trinkets, we're gonna need a smaller vessel.
:{{A|vo dleq001 3 beidou 10.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' All the available boats have been dispatched already. But by the looks of it, we're still one short...
:{{DIcon}} I have my own boat.
:{{A|vo dleq001 3 beidou 11.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' So you have your own vessel do ya? Hah! Great, let's take yours, then.
:{{A|vo dleq001 3 beidou 12.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' The more people we have on this job the better. 'Cause the sooner we get this wrapped up, the sooner we can get that feast going and actually enjoy the festival!

----
;(Board the Waverider)
:{{A|vo dleq001 4 beidou 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' So... this is it? This is your boat?
:{{A|vo dleq001 4 beidou 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' It's really, uh... compact. But, it works... It's about the right size for sweeping up junk from the water's surface.
:{{A|vo dleq001 4 xinyan 01.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Only thing is... we're packed in like sardines here. There's nowhere to put my guitar...
:{{A|vo dleq001 4 beidou 03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Uh, Xinyan, your "axe" is getting a little too close for comfort...
:{{A|vo dleq001 4 xinyan 02.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Oh! Whoops! Lemme try to move that out of your way...
:{{A|vo dleq001 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Huh? Umm Xinyan, why does your guitar have blades on it?
:{{A|vo dleq001 4 xinyan 03.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Self-defense, of course! It shoots fire, too! ...Oh, but the middle of a big festival probably isn't the best time to give you a demonstration...
:{{A|vo dleq001 4 xinyan 04.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Also, there's a teeny-tiny chance it might set your boat on fire... That's not a risk worth taking, no matter how small...
:{{A|vo dleq001 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew, this gal really jazzed up her guitar...

;(Approach the salvage area)
:{{A|vo dleq001 5 xinyan 01.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Hold up, are those... Treasure Hoarders!?
:{{A|vo dleq001 5 beidou 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' We don't usually see these guys out at sea... Could they be here for the same reason as us?
:{{A|vo dleq001 5 beidou 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' C'mon, Traveler. Steer us a little closer.

;(Pick up the salvage)
:{{A|vo dleq001 6 xinyan 01.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Huh? Why're they heading back to shore?
:{{A|vo dleq001 6 beidou 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' To reconvene with their posse, I'll bet.
:{{A|vo dleq001 6 beidou 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Speed it up a notch, Traveler. This is a chase now.
----
;(Attack the Treasure Hoarders)
:{{A|vo dleq001 7 treasurehoardera 01.ogg}} '''Treasure Hoarder:''' Th&mdash;They're gaining on us! We can't give 'em the slip!
:{{A|vo dleq001 7 treasurehoardera 02.ogg}} '''Treasure Hoarder:''' Call in Carmen!
:{{A|vo dleq001 7 xinyan 01.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Haha! "Carmen"? What kind of Treasure Hoarder has a name like that?
:{{A|vo dleq001 7 beidou 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' One that I happen to know pretty well. Didn't think we'd be running into him...

;(Defeat the Treasure Hoarders)
:{{A|vo dleq001 8 doorhold 01.ogg}} '''Carmen:''' Stop! All of you!
:{{A|vo dleq001 8 doorhold 02.ogg}} '''Carmen:''' Are you blind? Can't you see this is Captain Beidou!?
:{{A|vo dleq001 8 doorhold 03.ogg}} '''Carmen:''' Hehe... Cap'n Beidou, it's been a while. Still fighting fit, I see.
:{{A|vo dleq001 8 beidou 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' I guess it has been a while, Carmen. You're looking a little worse for wear.
:{{A|vo dleq001 8 beidou 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Maybe if you did your own dirty work rather than dispatching your minions, you wouldn't be so out of breath right now.
:{{A|vo dleq001 8 doorhold 04.ogg}} '''Carmen:''' Ah, how you jest, Beidou, very amusing... Hahaha...
:{{A|vo dleq001 8 beidou 03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' To get serious for a second, though &mdash; I'm gonna be needing all of this. So put everything down and I won't cause you any more trouble.
:{{A|vo dleq001 8 doorhold 05.ogg}} '''Carmen:''' Of course, of course, whatever Cap'n Beidou wants... You heard her, people. Drop the goods!
:{{A|vo dleq001 8 doorhold 06.ogg}} '''Carmen:''' Here you are, it's all here. So, uh... w&mdash;we'll take our leave now.
:{{Black Screen|''Carmen dashes away with the Treasure Hoarders...''}}
:{{A|vo dleq001 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, he did what we asked without a second thought...
:{{DIcon}} He couldn't surrender quickly enough.
:{{A|vo dleq001 8 xinyan 01.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Couldn't run off quickly enough, either...
:{{A|vo dleq001 8 beidou 04.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Don't waste any more time on them. We've still got salvaging to do.
:{{A|vo dleq001 8 beidou 05.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Ah, but we should load this stash onto the boat first... C'mon, Traveler, help me out here.
----

;(Approach the first set of 3 boxes in water)
:{{A|vo dleq001 9 xinyan 01.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Hey! There're some things floating on the water...
:{{A|vo dleq001 9 beidou 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Hmm, I can't quite make out what they are. Let's bring them in and take a look.
:{{A|vo dleq001 9 beidou 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' I'll take the rudder. Traveler, Xinyan &mdash; go reel them in.

;(Collect the last set of 2 boxes in water)
:{{A|vo dleq001 10 xinyan 01.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Hey, looks like another Treasure Hoarder raft straight up ahead. But, uh... why's it empty?
:{{A|vo dleq001 10 beidou 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' I guess Carmen told all his people to call it off.
:{{A|vo dleq001 10 beidou 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Smart choice. He knows who he's up against. Let's keep going.
----

;(Approach the Treasure Hoarder camp)
:{{A|vo dleq001 11 slippie 01.ogg}} '''???:''' C'mon, we gotta wrap this up soon! Leave the junk, take anything and everything of value!
:{{A|vo dleq001 11 slippie 02.ogg}} '''???:''' And I need a few of you to go and load the boat up, move it!
:{{A|vo dleq001 11 beidou 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Whatever you're about to do &mdash; don't. And whatever goods you're holding &mdash; they're mine now.
:{{A|vo dleq001 11 slippie 03.ogg}} '''???:''' B&mdash;Beidou!? Wh&mdash;What are you doing here!?
:{{A|vo dleq001 11 beidou 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' I might ask you the same question.
:{{A|vo dleq001 11 slippie 04.ogg}} '''Liuliu:''' I mean, what does it look like? We got lucky. Found some treasure floating around in the ocean.
:{{A|vo dleq001 11 slippie 05.ogg}} '''Liuliu:''' If you see anything you like, it's yours for the taking! A token of our esteem for the mighty Captain Beidou, hahaha!
:{{A|vo dleq001 11 beidou 03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Is that right? Well, good. I'll take it all.
:{{A|vo dleq001 11 slippie 06.ogg}} '''Liuliu:''' I... But... C'mon, heh, be reasonable here...
:{{A|vo dleq001 11 slippie 07.ogg}} '''Liuliu:''' Me and the guys have been busting a gut gathering all this up... you gotta leave us a little something-something, surely?
:{{A|vo dleq001 11 beidou 04.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Lemme make this crystal clear: These things do not belong to you, and they never will. So you're gonna put them down, and then you're gonna get as far away from me as is physically possible.
:{{A|vo dleq001 11 slippie 08.ogg}} '''Liuliu:''' That's a little, uh... Heh, why don't we start over, huh? You see, we&mdash;
:{{A|vo dleq001 11 beidou 05.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Huh... sounds a lot like you're stalling to me.
:{{A|vo dleq001 11 beidou 06.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Talk is cheap. Let's settle this the old-fashioned way!

;(Defeat Liuliu to 50% HP)
:{{A|vo dleq001 12 treasurehoardera 01.ogg}} '''Treasure Hoarder:''' The boat's loaded and in the water, boss, come take a look...
:{{A|vo dleq001 12 slippie 01.ogg}} '''Liuliu:''' Argh, Captain Beidou pulls no punches... Retreat! Retreeeeat!
:{{A|vo dleq001 12 treasurehoardera 02.ogg}} '''Treasure Hoarder:''' Uhh, if the captain is bailing... We'd better bail, too!
:{{A|vo dleq001 12 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Woah, looks like they're outta here!
:{{A|vo dleq001 12 slippie 02.ogg}} '''Liuliu:''' We're sorry we offended you, Captain Beidou! Give us some time, we'll find a way to make it right, I promise!

;(The Treasure Hoarder retreats)
:{{A|vo dleq001 13 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Boy, they sure ran off quickly...
:{{A|vo dleq001 13 beidou 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Eh, who cares. They didn't take anything with them.
:{{A|vo dleq001 13 beidou 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' The bigger problem here is, there's no way all of this is going to fit onto your boat.
:{{A|vo dleq001 13 beidou 03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Hmm... Okay, here's what we're gonna do. Unload the boat and put everything here, in one place.
:{{A|vo dleq001 13 beidou 04.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Based on the original plan, [[Sea Drake]]'s boat should be coming past here at some point. When they get here, we'll hitch a ride with them.
:{{A|vo dleq001 13 beidou 05.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' In the meantime, Traveler, head back to the Jade Chamber and deliver a message to Ningguang for me.
:{{A|vo dleq001 13 beidou 06.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Just tell her we're almost done fishing for trinkets here, so she should start getting my compensation ready.
:{{DIcon}} Got it.
:{{A|vo dleq001 13 beidou 07.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Alright. Thanks, Traveler.
:{{A|vo dleq001 13 beidou 08.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' If both Carmen and Liuliu were here... Then I wonder if that other "boss" of theirs, Big Sis, is snooping around?
:{{A|vo dleq001 13 beidou 09.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' I've gotta tell Sea Drake and the rest of the crew to stay on high alert...

;(Talk to Beidou again)
:{{A|vo dialog dleq001 beidou 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' I wonder what's taking Sea Drake so long... Could he have run into the Treasure Hoarders, too?

;(Talk to Xinyan)
:{{A|vo dialog dleq001 xinyan 01.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Seems like the Treasure Hoarders are more of a mixed bag than I thought...

----
;(Report back to Ningguang at the Jade Chamber)
:{{A|vo dleq001 16 ningguang 01.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Welcome back. I trust Beidou is making good progress on salvaging the items?
:{{DIcon}} Let me fill you in...
:{{Black Screen|''You bring Ningguang up to speed on the events so far...''}}
:{{A|vo dleq001 16 ningguang 02.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Treasure Hoarders, I see... Yes, I can imagine that must have been rather irksome.
:{{A|vo dleq001 16 ningguang 03.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' It sounds like you scared them off on this occasion. But it won't end there. They are not the type to forgive and forget.
:{{A|vo dleq001 16 ningguang 04.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' You needn't concern yourself with them any further, though. Leave them to Beidou &mdash; she is well versed in handling Treasure Hoarders. I will be sure to make preparations for her compensation.
:{{A|vo dleq001 16 ningguang 05.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' I also owe you my thanks for coming all this way to deliver Beidou's message. Here, please take this as a token of my appreciation.
:{{A|vo dleq001 16 ningguang 06.ogg}} '''Ningguang:''' Now, please excuse me, I have other business that demands my attention. I wish you a fun-filled festival.

===Beidou and Xinyan===
After completing ''Petal-Lit Ships Fish For the Moon'', [[Beidou]] and [[Xinyan]] can be found in the open world.
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Xinyan or Beidou at the northern bridge entrance to Liyue Harbor)
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 2 xinyan 01.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Ahh... Ahh... *cough*! That party was a real blast! You know you had a good time when you ended up singing a little too hard and straining your voice...
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 2 beidou 01.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Seems I've caused you all sorts of trouble. Sorry it's been so tough on you.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 2 xinyan 02.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Are you kidding me!? I got to go out on the ocean with you and celebrate the festival with y'all. Couldn't have asked for more. Best Lantern Rite ever!
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 2 xinyan 03.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' I was gonna ask, though... Now that your crew is all back home with their families, aren't you gonna get bored on your own?
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 2 beidou 02.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Haha, not a chance. Just yesterday I got an invitation to play some chess. Said I could head up for a game whenever I'm down to play.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 2 xinyan 04.ogg}} '''Xinyan:''' Head up...? Oh, right! You mean to the Jade Chamber.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 2 beidou 03.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Uh, moving on &mdash; when you're feeling better, we should grab some food together.
:{{A|vo eqhdj talk 2 beidou 04.ogg}} '''Beidou:''' Lantern Rite only comes once a year, and I, for one, intend to make the most of it.
