|description    = A signboard made of sturdy Linden Wood that is a common sight in the [[Court of Fontaine]]. They say that this sort of wooden board originates from the discussion boards that opera enthusiasts would put up before the doors of the [[Opera Epiclese]] to use as discussion boards. But so impassioned was the discourse, and so many were the participants, that the [[Maison Gardiennage]] was forced to spend several months dismantling them all to keep public order.<br>However, despite the removal of a vast majority of the boards, this method of communicating through announcement boards continues to persist in the Court of Fontaine. Following the principle of "establishing a semblance of order no matter what," the [[Palais Mermonia]] made revisions to city ordinances, regulating the locations and manner in which such boards could appear.<br>...But when they were done, and announced the measures to the public, they found that the phenomenon then significantly decreased throughout the Court. How very strange indeed.
