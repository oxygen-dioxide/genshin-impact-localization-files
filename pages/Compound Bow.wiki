==Description==
The whole world flocks to the commercial port of [[Liyue]], much to the city's pride.<br />
With the tides of people also come exotic treasures.<br />
This compound bow may be small in size, but its unique design and superior craftsmanship have made it more destructive than most common longbows.<br />
It is also harder to maintain than other bows. For it is not merely a weapon, but the culmination of the wisdom of a foreign kingdom.

Made by a foreign scholar, this compound bow has been modified with a pulley.<br />
The scholar had no heart for violence, and bore no desire to see blood drawn.<br />
But mesmerized by the curve of the drawn bow, and the quiver of arrows in flight,<br />
He was driven to transform the compound bow and make it more powerful.

The scholar knew from the onset of his endeavor what his creation would become &mdash; a tool of war, that would bring nothing but death.<br />
But he was lost in his pursuit to perfect both structure and materials,<br />
And there was to be no stopping him as he fled this reality.

Though one day the bow was taken up by a soldier, who promptly shot down a wild goose.<br />
"This is the bow I seek"<br /><!--There is no end punctuation in-game.-->
Said the heartless soldier, commending the weapon in his hands,<br />
As the final cry of the bird he had murdered pierced his heart, just as his arrow had pierced the bird's.
