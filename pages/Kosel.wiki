===Dialogue Set #1===
''Available before step 5 of ''[[Deluge of Wrathful Waters]]''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kosel:''' Huh? A new batch of goods? I'll get them moved, no problem.
:{{DIcon}} By new batch, you refer to...
::'''Kosel:''' Huh? Relax, I was referring to normal cargo.
::'''Kosel:''' [[Munaciello]] keeps saying that "information is cargo too" &mdash; and he's certainly succeeded in creating all sorts of unnecessary expectations of us porters.
::'''Kosel:''' Don't listen to his claptrap &mdash; we should all just do what we should.
:{{DIcon}} Uh, that's not it...
::'''Kosel:''' Oh, so you're a guest here.
::'''Kosel:''' Alright then. Just call me if you need anything.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #2===
''Available after step 5 of ''Deluge of Wrathful Waters''.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kosel:''' Hello. The goods we're transporting have to pass right through here. Careful not to get hit.
:{{DIcon}} When you say goods...
::'''Kosel:''' Supplies for disaster relief and reconstruction.
::'''Kosel:''' Some are from the Snezhnayans, others from Ms. [[Clorinde]].
::'''Kosel:''' The Boss has already given instructions. I'll take care of these, no need to bother you.
:{{DIcon}} Understood.
::'''Kosel:''' Mm-hmm.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Dialogue Set #3===
''Available after {{cx}}.''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Kosel:''' Huh? A new shipment of goods? I'll get them moved, right away.
:{{DIcon}} By new shipment, you mean...
::'''Kosel:''' Huh? Relax, I meant normal goods.
::'''Kosel:''' Munaciello used to keep saying that "information is a type of good too." That certainly succeeded in creating all sorts of unnecessary expectations of us porters.
::'''Kosel:''' Now that we can't hear his nagging anymore... being a porter is a boring profession once again.
:{{DIcon}} Uh, that's not it...
::'''Kosel:''' Oh, so you're a customer.
::'''Kosel:''' Alright, then. Just call me if you need anything.
