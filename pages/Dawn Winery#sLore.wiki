The '''Dawn Winery''' is the chief winery in [[Mondstadt]] and specializes in [[Dandelion Wine]]. Owned by the [[Ragnvindr Clan]] for several generations, its current owner, [[Diluc]], inherited it four years ago after the untimely passing of his father, [[Crepus]].

According to [[Elzer]], the winery is so successful that it effectively represents the entire wine industry in [[Mondstadt]].

The estate itself is situated in the south-western reaches of the Mondstadt region, between [[Springvale]] and the Stone Gate to [[Liyue]]. It is comprised of the [[Dawn Winery Manor|central two-story manor]] atop a small hill around which the vineyard itself is circling in several rows, as well as a handful of small storage sheds and single-story buildings in the vicinity.

There is a lake southwest of the manor from which Dawn Winery draws its water.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Mr. Bohuan}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Quest|Life Flows On (I)}}</ref><ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/iPt7z1rRptI Version 1.4 Special Program] (Wishful Drops description)</ref>

==Trivia==
* The motto of Dawn Winery is "Shine True."<ref>{{Ref/CS|Diluc|1}}</ref>
** According to Diluc's Character Story 1, the motto is written on the wooden sign outside the winery beneath Dawn Winery; however, in the game, it actually says "Forget not whence thou came" beneath Dawn Winery in the [[Teyvat Language]].
** The full sign reads, in text above and below Dawn Winery, "Whence the flow of {{sic|dalight}} comes / Forget not whence thou came." It bears a slight resemblance to Diluc's personal interpretation of what "Shine True" means: "Evil cannot go unpunished. Never settle for mediocrity. Never forget that the dawn will one day come."<ref>{{Ref/CS|Diluc|5}}</ref>
