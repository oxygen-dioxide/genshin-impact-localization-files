'''Oculi''' are [[Adventure Item]]s that can be found scattered across [[Teyvat]]. They are collectible orbs of elemental energy that can be offered to their corresponding [[Statue of The Seven]] for rewards. Oculi can only be found in the overworld, and will not appear in [[Chests]]. Oculi are also limited and do not respawn.

When an overworld Oculus is within close proximity of a player, the icon {{Icon|Oculus}} will appear on their minimap along with a sound effect. Players can also use their corresponding [[Oculus Resonance Stone]] to mark the location of an Oculus on the map.
