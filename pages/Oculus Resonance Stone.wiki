'''Oculus Resonance Stones''' are consumable [[gadgets]] that can be used to locate [[Oculi]] in their respective [[region]]s and can be obtained through [[alchemy]]. The [[instructions]] needed to craft the resonance stones are all obtainable from [[reputation]] rewards in their respective regions.

<section begin="resonance stone intro"/>Resonance stones can be equipped through the [[Inventory]] and can be used after pressing the appropriate [[Controls|control]]. When used, this [[gadget]] will be consumed if it successfully finds an [[Oculus]]. It will then highlight oculus' general location on the [[map]] with a blue circle. Upon entering its vicinity, a white arrow will show the player whether the oculus is above or below their current elevation until the oculus symbol appears on the map. After collecting an oculus the circle will persist if there are other oculi in its radius. If an oculus is not detected or is detected in a very close proximity to the player, the gadget will not be consumed.<section end="resonance stone intro" />
