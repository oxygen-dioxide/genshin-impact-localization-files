:'''Fein:''' Traveler, would you like to try [[Duel! The Summoners' Summit!/Heart of the Dice|Heart of the Dice]]?
:{{DIcon|Heart of the Dice}} Yep.
::'''Fein:''' No problem. Um, have you finished reading the rulebook yet?
::'''Fein:''' Oh, it's fine, you don't have to read it cover to cover to play. You can always learn as you play.
