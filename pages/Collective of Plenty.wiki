The '''Collective of Plenty''', or '''Teteocan''', is one of the six tribes in [[Natlan]]. They can be found at the [["Collective of Plenty"]] besides the [[Great Volcano of Tollan]] in [[Atocpan]]. Their current chief is [[Acatl]].

==Overview==
The Collective of Plenty are known for their bodybuilding competitions and contests of strength.<ref name=":0">{{Ref/Quest|Echoes of Life}}</ref> Their fruit and vegetables are said to be the best in Natlan, due to their tribe being situated right by the [[Great Volcano of Tollan]], where the soil is rich and fertile.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Cintli}}</ref> They live the farthest from the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Despair Engulfs the Heavens}}</ref>

Some warriors of the Collective of Plenty specifically seek out wild [[Halberd-Crest Bird]]s to see "whose head is harder," attempting to temper their own bodies through such competitions until they become as strong as steel.<ref>{{Ref/Wildlife|Halberd-Crest Bird}}</ref> They also wrestle with their saurians, the [[Tatankasaurus]], as it is a longstanding tradition in the tribe. Winning against them is considered a great honor.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Iansan|More About Iansan: V}}</ref>

Physical fitness is taken in high regard in the tribe; it is known to be a friendly gesture when young people show off their muscles, and fitness coaches have to be incredibly strong in order to be taken seriously. Due to this, many adults tend to have huge frames with large, well-developed muscles.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Iansan|Something to Share: Physicality}}</ref>

Their current chief is [[Acatl]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|When All Becomes a Monument}}</ref>

* The {{Furnishing Mentions|Collective of Plenty}}

===Etymology===
*Like the other known tribes, Teteocan is likely derived from ''Ilhuicatl-Teteocan'', one of the {{w|Aztec religion|Aztec}} {{w|Thirteen Heavens}}. 
** ''Ilhuicatl-Teteocan'' (Nahuatl: ''Ilhuicatl'' "heaven;" ''teteo'' "gods;" ''can'' "place") means "the heaven that is the place of the gods."
** ''Ilhuicatl-Teteocan'' was the abode of the gods, and was ruled by the four ''{{w|Aztec_creator_gods|Tezcatlipocas}}'': {{w|Tezcatlipoca}}, {{w|Quetzalcoatl}}, {{w|Xipe Totec}} and {{w|Huitzilopochtli}}.
