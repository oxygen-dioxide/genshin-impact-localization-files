{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Furuya Noboru:''' Why, if it isn't the new rookie!
:'''Furuya Noboru:''' *cough* Welcome! Feel free to ask me if you have any questions.
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Duel
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Furuya Noboru/Duel: Furuya Noboru|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Furuya Noboru:''' Hmm... Beginners always seem to make the same mistakes...
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Furuya Noboru:''' It seems I've lost... Hmm... I didn't realize where the game started to go wrong...
:{{DIcon}} You look pretty pale. Are you okay?
::'''Furuya Noboru:''' It's okay. I was just born with a weak constitution. *cough* Thank you for asking.
::'''Furuya Noboru:''' I have been weak and prone to sickness since I was little. I joined the [[Adventurers' Guild]] after I had grown up, hoping to train my body through adventures.
::'''Furuya Noboru:''' Although I have gathered quite a lot of experience, my body still remains the same... Oh, no no... I'm not some great adventurer worth mentioning or anything.
::'''Furuya Noboru:''' However, because I have been in Inazuma for so long, I happen to know more about the local Adventurers' Guild than anyone else. *cough* If you have any questions, feel free to ask me anytime.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about Inazuma...
::'''Furuya Noboru:''' You want to know more about the geography of Inazuma? Ahem... No problem!
::'''Furuya Noboru:''' I figure that you must've come to [[Narukami Island]] from [[Ritou]] through [[Konda Village]], right? Then I need not mention them, though there are some urban legends about [[Byakko Plain]], which is also on that path. Who knows if those are true or not?
::'''Furuya Noboru:''' To the north of [[Inazuma City]], you will find the [[Grand Narukami Shrine]] on the mountaintop. The great [[Sacred Sakura]] tree at the shrine is a truly spectacular sight.
::'''Furuya Noboru:''' Beneath the Grand Narukami Shrine are [[Mt. Yougou]] and the [[Chinju Forest]]. It's very difficult to climb Mt. Yougou. There are also legends about [[bake-danuki]] running amok in the Chinju Forest. Be extra careful if you go there.
::{{DIcon}} What's outside Narukami Island?
::'''Furuya Noboru:''' Outside of Narukami Island, if you keep going southwest, you will find [[Kannazuka]], [[Tatarasuna]] and [[Yashiori Island]].
::'''Furuya Noboru:''' These islands have been the focus of recent military conflicts, and I don't recommend that adventurers go there alone. However, many could not resist the temptation of treasure hunting... *cough*
::'''Furuya Noboru:''' In addition, I haven't heard much good about the [[Mikage Furnace]] of Tatarasuna at Kannazuka... Anyway, those who can't handle themselves well had best stay away from those places for now.
::'''Furuya Noboru:''' After passing through these islands, you will find yourself in the most remote corner of Inazuma, [[Watatsumi Island]], a place under the jurisdiction of the [[Sangonomiya Clan|Sangonomiya]].
:;(Before completing [[The Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna]])
:::'''Furuya Noboru:''' Further down... you will be in southern Inazuma. This is a place that is constantly shrouded by [[fog]]. It sure doesn't look like anything good from this side of the ocean...
:::'''Furuya Noboru:''' While I'm curious about what exactly is hiding in the thick fog, I wouldn't suggest going there.
:;(After completing The Sun-Wheel and Mt. Kanna)
:::'''Furuya Noboru:''' You can find [[Tsurumi Island]] to the south of Inazuma. That place has always been shrouded in fog, but that fog has dissipated suddenly for some reason...
:::'''Furuya Noboru:''' The Shogunate has no doubt noticed this as well. I've heard that they're planning to send people to develop that land after an observational period.
:::'''Furuya Noboru:''' Ah, right. While the fog may be gone, the situation is still unclear for now. I would probably still advise any new adventurers to not go there willy-nilly.
:{{DIcon}} I'm afraid I'm no longer a rookie.
:;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:::'''Furuya Noboru:''' Wow, such forcefulness! It seems that I have judged a book by its cover. My apologies.
:::'''Furuya Noboru:''' But since you have just arrived in Inazuma, you probably still find many things unfamiliar. If you run into any trouble, be careful. Come back for me!
:::'''Furuya Noboru:''' Inazuma is in turmoil right now, which you probably already know. However, this may be a blessing in disguise. Ever since the [[Sakoku Decree]], fewer and fewer foreign adventurers have been arriving, so there should still be quite a lot of lost treasure to be found.
:::'''Furuya Noboru:''' If you have confidence in your abilities, this might be the right place for you to flex your muscles.
:::'''Furuya Noboru:''' *sigh* Anyway, best you be careful when going outside. The Adventurers' Guild will always be behind you.
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} I look forward to working with you.
:::'''Furuya Noboru:''' Seeing as you've just arrived, I'll share with you some of the experiences that I've gathered over the years.
:::'''Furuya Noboru:''' In this rapidly changing world, I think there'll always be situations where the experience may be of use to you.
::;(Obtain [[Adventurer's Experience]] ×6)
:;(After completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:::'''Furuya Noboru:''' Wow, such forcefulness! It seems that I have judged a book by its cover. My apologies.
:::'''Furuya Noboru:''' But since you have just arrived in Inazuma, you probably still find many things unfamiliar. If you run into any trouble, be careful. Come back for me!
:::'''Furuya Noboru:''' Still, I expect that there'll be competition for all the buried treasure soon, what with the number of adventurers we're expecting to arrive at our shores from overseas soon.
:::'''Furuya Noboru:''' If you have confidence in your abilities, this might be the right place for you to flex your muscles.
:::'''Furuya Noboru:''' *cough* Anyway, best you be careful when going outside. The Adventurers' Guild will always be behind you.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye! Take care of yourself.
::'''Furuya Noboru:''' Thanks! You too, young adventurer!
