;(Follow the 3 Electro Seelie and open the chest)
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, there was something nice here after all!

;(Talk to Komaki after the current daily fortune task is completed)

:'''Komaki:''' Overcoming ill fate may yet bring you an unexpected boon.
:'''Paimon:''' A boon...? You mean treasure? Is it gonna be treasure?
:'''Komaki:''' I did not say that...

:{{DIcon}} Please help me tell my fortune!

:'''Komaki:''' Hmm. The Spiritherbs say that this will be an ill-fated day.
:'''Komaki:''' The ruined shrine in the east is shrouded in an ominous aura...
:'''Paimon:''' Uhh, that sounds kinda scary...
:'''Komaki:''' However...
:'''Komaki:''' Those who boldly go forth and conquer such omens will receive their just reward.
:{{DIcon}} This seems quite similar to what you said before...
:'''Komaki:''' Ah, isn't life like that? New experiences always cloak themselves in familiar-seeming days.

;(Talk to Komaki again before completing the daily fortune)
:'''Komaki:''' "The ruined shrine in the east is shrouded in an ominous aura..."
:'''Komaki:''' "But should you boldly go forth and conquer such omens, you will receive your just reward."

{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Komaki)
:'''Komaki:''' Oh, youngsters, how do you do?
:{{DIcon}} Please help me tell my fortune!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, is it gonna be good luck this time, Paimon wonders?
:'''Komaki:''' Oh dear, the Spiritherbs' light is rather weak at the moment. It seems they shall need some rest...
:'''Komaki:''' All the same, I can help you perform another divination.
:'''Komaki:''' Hmm. The twinkling of the Spiritherbs say that you shall have good fortune.
:'''Komaki:''' In the ruins to the northeast, in the ancient city that stands alone amidst the sea, a lingering spirit of mourning will light the way.
:'''Komaki:''' However...
:'''Komaki:''' You must open for her a great gate and return her to her nest of sweet slumber before the fated reward can be yours.
:'''Paimon:''' That was so confusing... Something something ancient city, something nest?
:'''Komaki:''' Haha, it's alright. I will remain here. If you cannot figure it out, you can feel free to ask me anytime.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Is she calling Paimon stupid?

;(Talk to Komaki again before completing the daily fortune)
:'''Komaki:''' "In the ruins to the northeast, in the ancient city that stands alone amidst the sea, a lingering spirit of mourning will light the way."

==Trivia==
* The cave being referred to as "a hive of scum and villainy" is a reference to the movie ''Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope'', specifically the scene in which Obi-Wan Kenobi tells Luke Skywalker that the latter will never find "a more wretched hive of scum and villainy" than Mos Eisley Spaceport.
