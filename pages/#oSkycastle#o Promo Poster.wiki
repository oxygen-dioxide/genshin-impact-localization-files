|description    = A promotional poster from the "[[Daiya's Three-Day Reverie]]" attraction in the [[Veluriyam Mirage]], depicting the central ideas and themes behind "[[Skycastle Saviors]]." The image focuses on a huge city floating in the sky, supported by a multitude of balloons attached below it. However, from a safety perspective, balloons that colorful might attract birds and result in collision damage. This might be the reason the Miraculous Architect in the play actually keeps the lift balloons within the foundation of the city, perhaps it's safer and more reliable that way...
