Mika's outfit consists of a blue jacket with lapels and rolled up sleeves worn over a white hoodie with blue details and a yellow necktie decorated with white details and pinned at the top with a blue gem. Over this, he wears a large belt-like garment crossing over his torso along with a small brown buckled book bag decorated with a blue and yellow plume. He wears a pair of cuffed white shorts with silver details, thick gray socks, oversized brown boots with spurs, and navy gloves with silver plating. His outfit is adorned with pins and other silver details, such as a large shield-like ornament on the right side of his chest with a blue feather attached to it. Two long pieces of fabric dangle from behind his jacket, decorated at the end with silver ornaments. His {{Cryo}} [[Vision]] is attached to a plate on his right glove.
