'''From Outer Lands''' is an Event Quest that occurs in [[Golden Apple Archipelago]] during the [[Midsummer Island Adventure]] event.

==Steps==
If start by investigating the wrecked ship on the island in the southeast of Twinning Isle:
#Interact with [[Slightly Damaged Wooden Plank]]

If start by investigating the wrecked ship on the island in the northeast of Broken Isle:
#Interact with [[Somewhat Rotten Wooden Plank]]

After interacting with one of the planks:
#Search for the other half of the wrecked ship
#Search for whatever the ship was carrying
#Defeat the thing that suddenly appeared

==Notes==
*During Step 3, look for mist bubbles near small wreckages.
*The order in which the player interacts with the mist bubbles doesn't matter. The player will always fight a [[Defense Mechanism]] after investigating the third bubble. A [[Luxurious Chest]] appears and the quest immediately completes after defeating it.
*The player can enter Party Setup while fighting the Defense Mechanism.

{{Quest Description|You discovered a strange wrecked ship on a nameless island. But the question is, where did this ship come from?}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Pick up the [[Somewhat Rotten Wooden Plank]] or the [[Slightly Damaged Wooden Plank]] on the first shipwreck)
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, this seems to be a ship... Uh, well, more like half a ship...
:'''Paimon:''' But what would half a ship be doing in a place like this? Oh, look! There are some words carved on it. Let's see what they say...
;(If Somewhat Rotten Wooden Plank)
::'''Paimon:''' "We have no idea where we are, but it looks like we've left [[Inazuma]] far behind. Ha, I wish I could see the looks on the faces of those [[Shogunate]] lackeys!"
::'''Paimon:''' "However, there doesn't appear to be a speck of dry land in sight. I'm afraid the boat won't hold up unless we find a place to make anchor soon... We need to think of a way soon."
::'''Paimon:''' It seems the boat was full of people that left Inazuma, but then encountered some problems at sea... All they could do is drift with the currents.
::'''Paimon:''' It seems that their boat was still intact at that time. Let's keep searching the area for more clues.
;(If Slightly Damaged Wooden Plank)
::'''Paimon:''' "Though the front half was lost, we've somehow managed to stay afloat on the remaining back half for some time now... Now that's what I call a ship, haha! Unfortunately, most of the ship's load is probably sitting at the bottom of the sea by now..."
::'''Paimon:''' "...It seems like... we floated here on the southeast currents? Well, that doesn't matter. The problem that we need to solve right now is how to leave this place..."
::'''Paimon:''' Looks to Paimon like they were a group of people who were stranded at sea. It says the "front half was lost"...
::'''Paimon:''' Oh, so that must mean this is the "remaining back half"! Whew, what could have possibly caused their ship to break into two like that?
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm, it also said that they ended up here by floating on the "southeast currents."
::'''Paimon:''' If we follow the way that they came and look for the front half of the ship, maybe we'll find something.
:{{DIcon}} Let's bring the carved wood plank we just read with us, too.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon gets it. You think these carved words might be some sort of clue.
:'''Paimon:''' Makes sense to Paimon! Most of the ship's wood has already started to rot, the carved plank will probably break right off.
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, let's snap off that plank and go search for the other half of the ship!
----
;(Pick up the [[Somewhat Rotten Wooden Plank]] or the [[Slightly Damaged Wooden Plank]] on the second shipwreck)
:'''Paimon:''' Hey, this must be the other half of the ship. Let's see... Oh, there's some more words carved here!
;(If Somewhat Rotten Wooden Plank)
::'''Paimon:''' "We have no idea where we are, but it looks like we've left Inazuma far behind. Ha, I wish I could see the looks on the faces of those Shogunate lackeys!"
::'''Paimon:''' "However, there doesn't appear to be a speck of dry land in sight. I'm afraid the boat won't hold up unless we find a place to make anchor soon... We need to think of a way soon."
;(If Slightly Damaged Wooden Plank)
::'''Paimon:''' "Though the front half was lost, we've somehow managed to stay afloat on the remaining back half for some time now... Now that's what I call a ship, haha! Unfortunately, most of the ship's load is probably sitting at the bottom of the sea by now..."
::'''Paimon:''' "...It seems like... we floated here on the southeast currents? Well, that doesn't matter. The problem that we need to solve right now is how to leave this place..."
:{{DIcon}} The words from each half of the ship are connected.
:'''Paimon:''' If we place them together, it reads...
:'''Paimon:''' "We have no idea where we are, but it looks like we've left Inazuma far behind. Ha, I wish I could see the looks on the faces of those Shogunate lackeys!"
:'''Paimon:''' "However, there doesn't appear to be a speck of dry land in sight. I'm afraid the boat won't hold up unless we find a place to make anchor soon... We need to think of a way soon."
:'''Paimon:''' "Though the front half was lost, we've somehow managed to stay afloat on the remaining back half for some time now... Now that's what I call a ship, haha! Unfortunately, most of the ship's load is probably sitting at the bottom of the sea by now..."
:'''Paimon:''' "...It seems like... we floated here on the southeast currents? Well, that doesn't matter. The problem that we need to solve right now is how to leave this place..."
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon gets it now. These people were transporting something on the boat when they encountered some trouble at sea and ended up drifting here.
:{{DIcon}} Seems like quite the disaster.
::'''Paimon:''' No kidding, the boat even broke in half...
:{{DIcon}} Maybe they found a way to survive the incident?
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon sure hopes so... But the situation sounds like it was pretty dire...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, but the real question is... what were they carrying on the ship?
:'''Paimon:''' Why don't we look around some more? *gasp* Maybe we'll find treasure!
:{{DIcon}} Anything that's been in the water that long is probably ruined by now.
::'''Paimon:''' Hey! Don't dampen our treasure hunting spirit! I'm sure any treasure we find will be nice and shiny.
:{{DIcon}} Or more monsters...
::'''Paimon:''' No way, we're at sea now! All we have out here is water and big fish.
:'''Paimon:''' Anyway, let's get moving. We've got a lot of sea to cover!
:'''Paimon:''' According to the words carved on that wooden plank, this boat drifted here before being broken up.
:'''Paimon:''' After it was broken up, half of it drifted off to the "southeast."
:'''Paimon:''' Well, might as well try our luck in the area between the two broken bits of the ship.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's see if we really do find something...

;(Investigate the first bubble)
:'''Paimon:''' Aw, there's nothing here...
:'''Paimon:''' Let's go look somewhere else.
----
;(Investigate the second bubble)
:'''Paimon:''' Whole loada nothing here too...
:'''Paimon:''' W&mdash;Well, there's gotta be something around here...
----
;(Investigate the third bubble)
:'''Paimon:''' Hah! Look, there's something... after... all...
:;(A [[Defense Mechanism]] rises from the water)
:'''Paimon:''' Argh, what is this? Why are there such things in the ocean!?
:'''Paimon:''' Ahhh! Bring it down, bring it down, quick!

;(After defeating the enemy)
:'''Paimon:''' Is that the thing that those people carried with them on the boat? How strange...
:'''Paimon:''' Well... we seem to have defeated it either way.
:'''Paimon:''' Let's get back to the shore. Who knows what else we'll meet if we stay here...
