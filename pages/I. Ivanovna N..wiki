'''I. Ivanovna N.''' was a member of the [[Hexenzirkel]], where she went by the codename "'''J'''."

After marrying, I. Ivanovna left the Hexenzirkel, although she kept in touch with them from time to time. She passed away centuries ago but had a line of successors, the most recent of which is [[Scarlett]].<ref name="Windblume">{{Ref/Quest|Joy Above the Clouds}}</ref>

==Profile==
Little is known about I. Ivanovna's abilities or actions while she was alive. However, it is likely that like the other members of the Hexenzirkel, she was a rather powerful mage. She had a lineage of successors and followers, although none of them were acknowledged by Hexenzirkel Elder [[Alice]] until Scarlett.<ref name="Windblume" />

In ''The Mages' Tea Party'' cutscene, I. Ivanovna is represented at the tea party with a pink teacup, with rose and thorn motifs in the background.<ref name="TMTP">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/RigK4OwCCM8 Story Teaser: The Mages' Tea Party | Genshin Impact]</ref>

===Personality===
''(To be added.)''

===Appearance===
I. Ivanovna is depicted as a blonde woman wearing a red dress. Later in ''The Mages' Tea Party'' cutscene, she is also represented by a woman with wavy, floor-length hair and a large witch's hat.<ref name="TMTP">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/RigK4OwCCM8 Story Teaser: The Mages' Tea Party | Genshin Impact]</ref>

==Story==
At some point in her life, I. Ivanovna fell in love with a man and decided to leave the Hexenzirkel after marrying. The day before she was going to be married, Alice, [[Andersdotter]], [[Nicole]], and [[Rhinedottir]] sent her a letter containing a "prophecy," which was actually a request for her to see them again. It can be assumed that she communicated with them using a Lantern of Utmost Joy; after her husband's passing, she told them that she had ended his life to ease him of his suffering.<ref name="Windblume" /><ref name="TMTP" />

Although I. Ivanovna passed away centuries ago, she passed her title onto her students and followers. Her most recent successor, Scarlett, had the prophecy which the Hexenzirkel members had written and sought to uncover information about it, leading to the events of [[Windblume Festival]].<ref name="Windblume" />
