'''I. Ivanovna N.''', also known by her codename "'''J'''," was a member of the [[Hexenzirkel]].<ref name="Windblume"/> She was also the first Mayor of [[Snezhnaya]].<ref name="IT">[[Imaginarium Theater/Fortune Slips|Imaginarium Theater Fortune Slip]]: ''(Neat handwriting. This does not look like a fortune-telling slip...)''</ref>

After marrying, I. Ivanovna left the Hexenzirkel, although she kept in touch with them from time to time. She passed away centuries ago but had a line of successors, the most recent of which is [[Scarlett]].<ref name="Windblume">{{Ref/Quest|Joy Above the Clouds}}</ref>

==Profile==
I. Ivanovna never had any magic or combat training, and was "simply ordinary" in comparison to other members of the Hexenzirkel.<ref name="IT"/> She had a lineage of successors and followers, although none of them were acknowledged by Hexenzirkel Elder [[Alice]] until Scarlett.<ref name="Windblume" />

In ''The Mages' Tea Party'' cutscene, I. Ivanovna is represented at the tea party with a pink teacup, with rose and thorn motifs in the background.<ref name="TMTP">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/RigK4OwCCM8 Story Teaser: The Mages' Tea Party | Genshin Impact]</ref>

===Appearance===
I. Ivanovna is depicted as a light-haired woman wearing a red dress. Later in ''The Mages' Tea Party'' cutscene, she is also represented by a woman with wavy, floor-length hair and a large witch's hat.<ref name="TMTP"/>

==Story==
At some point in her life, I. Ivanovna fell in love with a man and decided to leave the Hexenzirkel after marrying. The day before she was going to be married, Alice, [[Barbeloth]], [[Andersdotter]], [[Nicole]], and [[Rhinedottir]] sent her a letter containing a "prophecy," which was actually a request for her to see them again. It can be assumed that she communicated with them using a Lantern of Utmost Joy. Eventually, I. Ivanovna's husband grew old and fell gravely ill, so she ended his life to ease him of his suffering, and related the experience to her fellow witches the following day.<ref name="Windblume" /><ref name="TMTP" />

During her tenure of mayor, she requested Alice to help her settle various trifling matters in Snezhnaya. In exchange, Alice asked I. Ivanovna to write a fortune slip for Andersdotter.<ref name="IT"/>

Although I. Ivanovna passed away centuries ago, she passed her title onto her students and followers. Her most recent successor, Scarlett, had the prophecy which the Hexenzirkel members had written and sought to uncover information about it, leading to the events of [[Windblume Festival]].<ref name="Windblume" />
