:'''Mermet:''' Really, it's not my fault...
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Duel
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Mermet/Harbor Traditions|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Mermet:''' Phew, that was tough! You're way better than those sailors!
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Mermet:''' Agh... I lost, just as I thought I would. You make those sailors look like a bunch of amateurs!
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything noteworthy nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Mermet knows)
:::'''Mermet:''' Good things? Well, I'm not so sure about that. You might want to ask the hydrology surveyors. They often come across all sorts of strange things during their surveys.
:::'''Mermet:''' However, I heard from a friend about a place nearby with a significant accumulation of "Magical Crystal Ore." I'm not sure if that qualifies as a "good thing" for you, but there you have it. I've marked their location on the map. If you're interested, you can go take a gander.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Mermet knows)
:::'''Mermet:''' I haven't seen anything noteworthy. I've had a lot on my plate with work lately and haven't had the energy to pay much attention to anything else.
:{{DIcon}} What happened?
::'''Mermet:''' I was reprimanded because I accidentally gave the wrong route while guiding a cargo ship, and it almost ran aground.
::'''Mermet:''' Okay, fine, I'll admit it's partially my fault, but you can't pin all the blame on me.
::'''Mermet:''' The routine hydrological surveys at the harbor have been suspended for a while now, so my charts haven't been updated for ages.
::'''Mermet:''' If I had the latest hydrological charts, this kind of problem wouldn't have occurred in the first place.
::{{DIcon}} Are you in charge of helping ships navigate the waters here?
:::'''Mermet:''' Don't you know? The hydrological conditions near Lumidouce Harbor are extremely complex. There are shallows, rifts, and even reefs.
:::'''Mermet:''' That's why the port usually assigns a navigator to board the cargo ships whenever they're entering or leaving the harbor. They help plot a course to guide the ships safely.
:::'''Mermet:''' But due to the recent... complications at Lumidouce Harbor, many navigators have resigned. Those of us who remain are overworked.
:::'''Mermet:''' *sigh* I wonder when this will all finally come to an end...
::{{DIcon}} Those hydrological surveys you just mentioned...
:::'''Mermet:''' Oh, yeah... We need to do them because the underwater environment can sometimes shift, you know?
:::'''Mermet:''' Currents could cause a sunken ship to drift over and end up blocking one route, while the same currents might simultaneously open up another route that was previously impassable...
:::'''Mermet:''' To facilitate navigation, our harbor usually hires specialists every once in a while to conduct a comprehensive survey of the waters near Lumidouce Harbor.
:::'''Mermet:''' They create updated hydrological charts, which are then distributed to all the navigators.
:::'''Mermet:''' But for some reason, it's been forever and a day since the harbor last organized a hydrological survey. We've been navigating based on outdated charts and experience.
:::'''Mermet:''' That's why I almost got into serious hot water.
:::{{DIcon}} How do you guys plan to proceed?
:::'''Mermet:''' I heard that Ms. [[Cassigneul]] is planning on conducting another comprehensive hydrological survey.
:::'''Mermet:''' While that's a good thing, hydrological surveys don't happen overnight. We have no idea when it'll be completed, but we can't afford to suspend the harbor's operations in the meantime.
:::'''Mermet:''' So until then, we'll just have to rely on our experience and intuition.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Mermet:''' Goodbye. I need to continue studying these hydrological charts...
