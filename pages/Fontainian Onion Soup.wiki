|desc_suspicious = The first few sips taste fine, but when you begin to gulp it down, the greasy cheese almost gives you palpitations... You probably don't want to have any soup in your presence the following week.
|desc_basic      = Stir-fry the onion until it is slightly charred, and boil it in broth. Transfer the contents to a soup bowl, add a slice of bread, sprinkle some cheese, and bake it in the oven. Well-seasoned chefs never cry when chopping onions, and here's their secret trick: Let the apprentices do the job.
|desc_delicious  = Stretchy and golden cheese lies on a slice of bread that is crispy on top and soft on the bottom. The rich onion aroma is combined with a slightly salty taste. A small sip is enough to warm one up.
