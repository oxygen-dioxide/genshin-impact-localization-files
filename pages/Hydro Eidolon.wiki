'''Hydro Eidolons''', also known colloquially as '''Water Droplets''', are an exploration mechanic in [[Veluriyam Mirage]] during the [[Secret Summer Paradise]] event.

Interacting with them will unlock various puzzles and mechanisms:
* Hide-and-Seek
* [[Investigation]] points
* Unlocking objects trapped by bubbles ([[chest]]s, [[Dendrograna]], etc.)
* Powering the [[Choo-Choo Cart]]
* Activating [[Elemental Monument]]s
* Interactions during [[Time Trial Challenge]]s
** Racing ("The Great Glug-Glug Run")
** Turning into [[Bouncy Mushroom]]s

They often disguise themselves as other objects, and one of the following interactions appearing next to the item:
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{DIcon|Talk}} Something's off...
:{{DIcon|Talk}} This is a bit odd...
:{{DIcon|Talk}} What is this?
{{Dialogue End}}
Sometimes, the item will have blue bubbles around it to indicate that it is a Hydro Eidolon in disguise.

==Profile==
Hydro Eidolons are found all across the Veluriyam Mirage and power many of the contraptions found there, such as [[Choo-Choo Cart]]s<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Zip Along (According to Safe Cart Operating Procedures)}}</ref> and [[Streaming Projector]]s.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Glaze Domain, Multum in Parvo}}</ref> They cannot speak, but they like to invite strangers to play with them by using body gestures.

Some Hydro Eidolons may be encountered that are paralyzed with fear due to nearby enemies, fire, or obstacles such as high places. The player will be rewarded if they eliminate the source of their fear.

Hydro Eidolons have the ability to copy and transform into humans based on those who have entered and left the Mirage.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Back to Normal: The Story Hidden in the Bottle}}</ref> The human forms of Hydro Eidolons can be recognizable by their light blue-colored hair and pupils. As elemental beings, they emit elemental energy even in their human form. They cannot replicate memories or personalities and they have to be taught by either the humans they copied or by [[Idyia]] using her memories of those people.

==Trivia==
* Hydro Eidolons resemble the shape of a {{w|water}} molecule, which consists of one larger oxygen atom surrounded by two smaller hydrogen atoms.

===Etymology===
* In Ancient Greek literature, an {{Lang|{{w|eidolon}}|el=εἴδωλον}} is the ghostly image or apparition of a living or dead person. The word is derived from {{Lang|mini=1|grc=εἴδω|grc_rm=eídō|grc_tl=to see, to know,}} which is also the linguistic root of the Greek name [[Idyia]].
