==Weak Point Location==
<gallery>
Pyro Regisvine Weak Point.png
</gallery>
* The Weak Point is only exposed after the player has destroyed the shield at its corolla once. When the Weak Point is exposed, the appearance of the corolla will change.

==Abilities==
''Most ability names are unofficial.''

===Roots Phase===
The Pyro Regisvine enters this phase when the boss fight begins, or when it wakes up from its paralyzed state after its corolla core is destroyed. Its core will be located at its roots. Breaking its weak point using elemental reactions will paralyze the Pyro Regisvine.
{{Elemental Shield Data|Pyro|12|Roots Core}}

{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Faceplant
|desc_1 = The Regisvine will slam its face into the ground after locking onto the player's current position, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} on impact and sending tremors through the ground in the direction it faceplants, with each explosion dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}. This attack may be used 3 times in rapid succession. This chance is greatly increased in the Corolla Phase.
* The Pyro Regisvine locks on to the player's current position once it starts shaking its head. After this animation, the player may move out of the way.

|caption_1 = Single
|file_1_2 = Pyro Regisvine Faceplant Triple
|caption_1_2 = Triple

|name_2 = Rapid Fire
|desc_2 = Using its buds, the Regisvine will fire small fireballs at the player in rapid succession, dealing '''20% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}.

|name_3 = Fire Seed
|desc_3 = After a short charging period, in which the Regisvine gathers {{Color|Pyro}} in its buds/arms, the Regisvine hurls a Blazing Seed at the player, dealing '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}. The seed can be destroyed using elemental reactions. If not destroyed, the seed explodes after a while, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} and infusing nearby floor with {{Pyro}} for '''35''' seconds. The infused ground will deal '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} to characters who step on it every second.
* This attack can be dodged by running to the Regisvine's base or dashing.

|file_3 = Pyro Regisvine Fireball

|name_4 = Homing Shots
|desc_4 = Raises its buds and shoots out a number of small orbs, then launching them at the player. The orbs travel slowly but will home towards their target, dealing '''12.5% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} on hit.

|name_5 = Spin
|desc_5 = A circle appears around the Regisvine indicating the radius of the attack. It will then flatten and stretch out its petals and spin, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} within the previously marked radius, knocking any characters back and infusing the ground in the radius with {{Pyro}} for '''10''' seconds. The infused ground will deal '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} to characters who step on it every second.

|name_6 = Half Flail
|desc_6 = If the player is behind the Pyro Regisvine, smashes its head on the floor and swings 180 degrees around its roots, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}.
}}

===Corolla Phase===
The Pyro Regisvine enters this phase when it wakes up from its paralyzed state after its roots core is destroyed. Its core is located at its corolla during this phase. Upon entering this phase, it immediately performs '''Flail'''. If the corolla weak point is not destroyed after a long period of time, the weak point will return to its roots and the Regisvine will re-enter Roots Phase. The '''Faceplant''' attack can still be used in this phase.
{{Elemental Shield Data|Pyro|6|Corolla Core}}

{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Flail
|desc_1 = After recovering from the paralyzed state, smashes its head on the floor, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}, and swings 360 degrees around its roots, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} and knocking players away.

|name_2 = Half Flail Combo
|desc_2 = Performs the following twice: Smashes its head on the floor and swings 180 degrees around its roots two times consecutively, dealing '''100% ATK''', '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} on the head smash and the swing respectively.<br>Then follows with '''Faceplant'''. After performing Faceplant, the corolla will linger on the ground for an extended period of time.

|name_3 = Eruption
|desc_3 = The Pyro Regisvine will point its corolla upwards, along with its buds, and cause {{Pyro}} energy to erupt from the ground, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} and launching the player upwards. More eruptions occur near players, but they are almost entirely absent near the base. This attack only triggers if the player is far from the Pyro Regisvine.
}}

==Strategy==
During the fight, it is necessary to destroy the Regisvine's weak point to allow large amounts of damage to be dealt upon it. While {{Hydro}}, {{Cryo}}, {{Electro}}, {{Anemo}}, {{Geo}} can all deal damage to the weak point, {{Hydro}} is the most effective. Therefore, a {{Hydro}} character is highly recommended. {{Pyro}} is not recommended as the Regisvine has increased resistance to that element. For the gauge units needed to break the shield, see [[Shields/Shield Gauge Data]].

During the Corolla Phase, while the corolla weak point is normally hard to reach using non-[[Bows|bow]]-wielding characters, the Regisvine will expose it during the '''Faceplant''' attack by smashing its corolla into the ground, allowing non-bow-wielding characters to damage it.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A giant vine that has absorbed the ancient flame that rages within the [[ley line]]s.<br>It is restless as if filled with endless fury.<br>Poets, bards, and even some academics believe that elements also contain emotions and hopes. If this is true, then one can only wonder what emotions cause the Pyro Regisvine to burn eternally, writhing like one longing to be free of the confines of the earth...|[[Adventurer Handbook]] and [[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* According to [[Ranjit]], its fruit is "pretty good" and tastes "like Pyro."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Search Chronicle: Cold, Round Belly!}}</ref>
