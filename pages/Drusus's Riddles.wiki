==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Inspect the Bulletin Board)
:'''Bulletin Board:''' "In the light of alternating day cycles, one can see the homeward figure of the lighthouse on the bridge."
:'''Paimon:''' W&mdash;What is this...? A riddle? Or a proverb or something...?
:'''Paimon:''' Alternating day cycles? Homeward figure...
:'''Kamal:''' Hello, traveler. Are you interested in Drusus's riddle too?
:{{DIcon}} Is it really a riddle?
:{{DIcon}} Do you know who set it up?
:'''Kamal:''' It was set up by an [[Akademiya]] researcher named Drusus.
:'''Kamal:''' As far as I know, he's an eccentric even among the Akademiya crowd.
:'''Kamal:''' He loves to talk about riddles with anyone, as well as research all kinds of encryption methods.
:'''Kamal:''' But some of his riddles are too incomprehensible, so not many people are willing to deal with him.
:'''Kamal:''' So he came up with the "solve riddles for prizes" idea.
:'''Kamal:''' Simply put, this riddle actually hints at a treasure trove.
:'''Kamal:''' You just have to show up at the right place at the right time using the right method and you'll get the treasure.
:'''Kamal:''' Drusus also gave a hint, saying that the locations are all within Sumeru City.
:'''Kamal:''' But as you can see, no adventurer has been able to succeed.
:'''Kamal:''' You can certainly try if you're interested.
:'''Kamal:''' But if you ask me, I'd tell you to do something else more productive.

;(Inspect the Bulletin Board again)
:'''Bulletin Board:''' "In the light of alternating day cycles, one can see the homeward figure of the lighthouse on the bridge."

;(After finding the first Riddle Note)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, so that "homeward figure" refers to the lighthouse's shadow cast on the bridge...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, there's also a note inside. What does it say?
:'''Paimon:''' "A mirror not made of glass reflects every drama."
:'''Paimon:''' Yet another riddle... Hmm, Paimon wonders what it could be.

;(After finding the second Riddle Note)
:'''Paimon:''' So the "mirror not made of glass" is talking about this pond, and "drama" refers to this theater...
:'''Paimon:''' Now that Paimon knows the answer, it does feel like a bit of a stretch...
:'''Paimon:''' There's still a note inside the chest. Seems like our painstaking serial puzzle-solving adventure continues...

;(After finding the third Riddle Note)
:'''Paimon:''' So "the sole path to knowledge" is... this bridge right here. Ugh, of course...
:'''Paimon:''' Well, this next riddle has Paimon stumped again...
:'''Paimon:''' "The flowers in the pond are blooming, with watery pearls there lingering."
:'''Paimon:''' What is it talking about?

;(After finding the fourth Riddle Note)
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, so the riddle is talking about this kind of flower! Well, now that Paimon thinks about it, its leaves do indeed hold water droplets like pearls!
:'''Paimon:''' Yet another note in the chest... Whoever wrote these really had all the time in the world...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Paimon doesn't think this is another riddle...

;(Talk to Drusus at noon)
:'''Drusus:''' Is no one coming today either...?
:{{DIcon}} Is this the "front door of the Temple of Knowledge"?
:'''Drusus:''' That's right! This is the front door of the Temple of Knowledge. You seem to have solved all my riddles.
:'''Drusus:''' And that's wonderful! I thought no one would be able to do that today either! Actually, I'm going back to have lunch soon...
:{{DIcon}} Why did you write these riddles?
:'''Drusus:''' Because it's fun, of course.
:'''Paimon:''' That was a quick answer!
:'''Drusus:''' Other than that reason, why do you think I wrote down these riddles?
:'''Drusus:''' Did you think that I was just enjoying being difficult?
:{{DIcon}} Who knows...
:{{DIcon}} I don't know.
:'''Drusus:''' Hahaha, then you have misunderstood me, like some people in the Akademiya.
:'''Drusus:''' I wrote these riddles down because I simply enjoy the feeling of pondering that comes with puzzling them out.
:'''Drusus:''' When you look back at my riddles, you can see that there is always a keyword leading to the final answer.
:'''Drusus:''' If you use this keyword as a base and keep thinking about it, the final answer will gradually present itself.
:'''Drusus:''' If I'd simply wanted to make things difficult for others, I would erase all the clues and turn the riddle into a truly unsolvable problem.
:'''Drusus:''' Let's not talk about this now. Since you've solved all my riddles, you can take these.
:'''Drusus:''' This is the reward you've won with your pondering. Keep them.
