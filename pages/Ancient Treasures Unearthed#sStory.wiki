===Prologue===
:'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' Oh, it's Mr. Zhongli and his friend.
:'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' As it so happens, I just finished writing a new story. I've even created some pictures of relics to go with it!
:'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' As you listen to my story, take a look through the pictures and see if you can match them with the descriptions!
:'''Zhongli:''' This does sound interesting. Why don't we sit for a moment and enjoy some light entertainment?

! Image !! Description
|-
| [[File:Bronze Bird.png|150px]] || '''Bronze Bird'''<br>A bronze bird with a thick neck, round eyes, and a beak shaped like a nail. Its wings are small and it has long, hanging tail feathers. The crest on its head is particularly eye-catching, like a row of flags fluttering in the wind.
|-
| [[File:Bronze Mask With Protruding Eyes.png|150px]] || '''Bronze Mask With Protruding Eyes'''<br>Clearly, this "Bronze Mask With Protruding Eyes" has been thus named for its unforgettably unique eyes. Its eyebrows are raised, and the eyes themselves are long and curved, with extremely exaggerated irises sticking out like columns — hence the name "Protruding Eyes."
|-
| [[File:Flower-Shaped Bronze Bell.png|150px]] || '''Flower-Shaped Bronze Bell'''<br>The "Flower-Shaped Bronze Bell" looks like a flower hanging upside down. If you look carefully, you'll see that the top is the flower's looped receptacle, the center is the ovary adorned with waves and curves, and the bottom consists of four petals extending outwards with a pattern of connected beads.
|-
| [[File:Bronze Standing Figure.png|150px]] || '''Bronze Standing Figure'''<br>Created through a process of segmental embedded-casting, the "Standing Figure" is a statue with a hollow body. From its shape alone, it might easily be mistaken for an ordinary person. But its facial features, clothing, and the objects beneath its feet all exude something of the mystical.
