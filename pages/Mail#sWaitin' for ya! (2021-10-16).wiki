|text    = Each year, I always write a new song a week before my birthday to record my growth. This year's song is already done and I'm pretty happy with it. I hope you'll be happy with it, too. I trust your taste in music, so do share your thoughts with me!

As a matter of fact, I recently carved a miniature {{w|Guqin}} from [[Cuihua Wood]]. I originally wanted to make it into an ornament, but the wooden finish is so smooth and the sound it makes ain't bad. Looks like I've really underestimated the malleability of Cuihua Wood!

Good things are often made better when shared with good friends! Oh right, I got you some wood materials. In addition to making instruments that rock, it can also be used to make ornaments and furniture... If you don't know how to work the wood, that's okay. You can tell me your ideas, and we can work on it together!
