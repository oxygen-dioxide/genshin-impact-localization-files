==Description==
The whole world flocks to the commercial port of [[Liyue]], much to the city's pride.<br />
With the tides of people also come exotic treasures.<br />
This needle-like sword, with a point but no edges, sacrifices the ability to slash for increased piercing damage.<br />
A level of skill is required to realize its full potential.<br />
However, it still serves as a fine sword even for those who wield it without particular skill.

A weapon from a distant shore that once hung from the waist of its seafaring bearer.<br />
A slender and elegant blade, it stood out amidst the roughness and chaos of the sea.

When curious folk inquired, the [[Skipper|boat captain]] deflected their questions. Rumors abounded concerning the blade's origins.<br />
Some said it was won in battle against pirates, others that it was loot from a raid.

But when the red evening clouds set in and after the sails had been dropped for the night, the [[Parsifal|Chief Mate]] would gently polish the blade,<br />
Reminiscing about his old life in the [[Mondstadt|Wind Kingdom]], the time he spent roaming as a martial nomad.<br />
Reminiscing about [[Blue-Eyed Spear Witch|a girl]] from his hometown, a love that ended too soon, and a promise to meet again.

==Trivia==
* This weapon's lore is about [[Parsifal]], a former Mondstadt aristocrat who became a vigilante opposed to the aristocracy and was forced to flee as a criminal. His story is expanded on in the lore for the [[Heart of Depth]] artifact set and the [[Alley Series]] weapons, and ties into the Skipper's story told in [[Tales From the Waves]] and [[Serpent Spine]].
