'''Struggle''' (''unofficial name'')  is a special state that can be applied to characters and enemies, where the target is unable to perform any actions. Displacement caused by [[Vacuum Field]]s also have much stronger effects on targets in this state. It also allows certain Vacuum Fields to lift affected targets vertically.

This state is most commonly applied by abilities capable of generating Vacuum Fields, though it is a separate mechanic and can be applied through other means.

Note that the Struggle state is not to be confused with [[stagger]] effects, as the former does not require the target to be poise-broken to be applied.

==Applying Struggle==
The Struggle state can be applied through the following means.

Note that the Struggle state cannot be applied if the target is more than 20 levels higher than the applier.
