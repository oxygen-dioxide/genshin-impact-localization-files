|text      = Hi there, dear partner! Before we talk business, I want to ask you a few questions first&mdash;

When decorating a cake, do you think [[Lumitoile]]s should go on top or be stuck to the base? I'm also thinking of making a gear mechanism that allows the cake stand to spin, wouldn't that be super fun? Oh, and one more thing, do you reckon savory roast meat crepes can go with cream?

Hmm... I've almost got everything ready for the luncheon, if not for these few pending questions! There's no rush to answer me now though, just bring your answers when you come. Yup, that's right, the business is to invite you to my birthday party! Let's keep it short and simple, I don't think there's a need to go into details! See you at the usual place then!
