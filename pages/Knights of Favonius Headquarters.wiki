The '''Knights of Favonius Headquarters''' is the headquarters of the [[Knights of Favonius]] located in the [[City of Mondstadt]]. There are two rooms inside that can be entered: the Grand Master's Office and the Mondstadt Library. There is also a locked solitary confinement room, which is almost exclusively used by [[Klee]], as well as an upstairs area that is currently untraversable.

The library was formerly a bathhouse created by the aristocracy for their personal use, and [[Ragnvindr]] converted it into a library after [[Vennessa]]'s rebellion. At one point, it was the largest library in northern Teyvat, but was reduced to one-sixth of its original size following the "Great Fire of Fall Equinox."<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Favonius Codex}}</ref> It is unclear whether the rest of the headquarters was converted from the aristocrats' baths, or if it was built following the Great Fire of Fall Equinox.
