:'''Mualani:''' Wow, you're pretty good at photography!
:'''Mualani:''' Those big guys are called [[Long-Necked Rhino]]s. Just like their name, they have super long necks. I've always wanted to try sliding down their necks &mdash; it must be so much fun!
:'''Mualani:''' Next, I'll show you around the other tribes, and introduce you to some of my friends!

:;(Mualani approaches [[Kinich]] with the Traveler)
:'''Mualani:''' Hey, Kinich, I've brought the surfboard you ordered!
