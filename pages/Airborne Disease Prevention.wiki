|info          = It's time for the real bash bros to step up! Ifa calls Cacucu in as backup.<br><br>After using this skill, Ifa gains 80 [[Nightsoul point]]s and enters the [[Nightsoul's Blessing]] state. In the Nightsoul's Blessing state, Ifa will hover with Cacucu's help. When he uses Normal Attacks in this state, he will use different kinds of Supporting Fire on whether you Tap or Hold, firing Tonicshots that are capable of healing all party members.<br><br>Additionally, Holding the Elemental Skill Airborne Disease Prevention while Ifa is in Nightsoul's Blessing will cause him to use a Nightsoul-aligned Plunging Attack. Letting go of the skill button will interrupt this Plunging Attack to maintain his hover. If Ifa lands due to this Plunging Attack, his Nightsoul's Blessing state will end.<br><br>'''Nightsoul's Blessing: Ifa'''<br>Continuously consumes Nightsoul points. This state will end when Ifa runs out of Nightsoul points or if he uses this skill again. His Nightsoul's Blessing state has the following properties: <ul><li>Hovers with Cacucu's help, increasing Ifa's [[Movement SPD]] and [[interruption resistance]]. In this state, Ifa will continuously consume Nightsoul points to maintain this hovering state. If he sprints or accelerates, he will consume additional points. </li><li>When he uses Normal Attacks, he will use different kinds of Supporting Fire depending on whether you Tap or Hold.</li></ul><br>'''Supporting Fire'''<br>In the Nightsoul's Blessing State, Ifa's Normal Attacks will turn into Supporting Fire. '''Tap'''<br>Fires a Tonicshot.<br>'''Hold'''<br>Continuously fires Tonicshots.<br>'''Tonicshot'''<br>Deals Nightsoul-aligned Anemo DMG, and will heat all nearby party members based on Ifa's Elemental Mastery upon hitting an opponent.
