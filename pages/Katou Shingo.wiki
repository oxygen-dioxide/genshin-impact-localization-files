==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Katou Shingou is the older brother of [[Katou Youhei]]. He and his brother dreamed of establishing their own dojo for a living. He became a student of [[Meikyou Shisui Art]] after begging [[Domon]] to take him in. However, due to his laziness and negligence, he was kicked out.

During the popularity of the book [[A Firsthand Guide to Summoning Spirits]], he and his brother performed a summoning ritual in order to gain swordsmanship that will allow the brother to build their own dojo for a living. The [[Arakawa Kouji|spirit]] they've summoned possessed Shingou and helped him defeat Domon's best apprentice.
