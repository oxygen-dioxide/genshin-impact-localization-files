{{Description|The dark metallic vessel owned by the Bloodstained Knight. Its exterior has been stained as black as the night by smoke and coagulated blood.}}
'''Bloodstained Chevalier's Goblet''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Bloodstained Chivalry]].

==Description==
Originally an exquisite silver goblet with gold engravings depicting the feats of a chivalrous knight.<br />But blood and smoke have stained the cup beyond recognition.

Covered in blood, the knight who slayed demons returned from the scourged battlefield,<br />Only to find that those awaiting his rescue were nowhere to be found among the burning, collapsed houses.

Defeated, the Bloodstained Knight took the smoke-blackened goblet,<br />and vowed to rid the world of monsters, of poverty and of evil.
