|description = A beetle with a lively, energetic personality that carries a block of crystal-like solid [[phlogiston]].<br>The Crystal Beetle's magnificent appearance can attract other creatures from afar. Should they prove friendly, the Crystal Beetle will play with the other party, and over time, they can become friends. Should the other party have ulterior motives, then the Crystal Beetle will use its rock-hard body to make them regret it.<br>It is said that Crystal Beetles have the special ability to perceive certain ores and minerals. Some miners from the [[Children of Echoes]] put this incredible faculty to good use, making friends with a few Crystal Beetles and asking them to lend a tarsus when they head down into the mines...

'''Crystal Beetle''' is a type of [[Wildlife]] that can be found in [[Natlan]].

Crystal Beetles will flee (very slowly) when approached, but will not despawn unless attacked. They will generate 2 Phlogiston Particles if caught, or 1 Phlogiston Particle if killed.

When [[Varesa]] is in her Sudden Onrush state or when [[Iansan]] is in her Rushing Thunderbolt state, simply touching a Crystal Beetle will generate 1 Phlogiston Particle. This does not count as catching or killing it.

Catching a Crystal Beetle counts as an instance of Mining.

==Drops==
Catching one for the first time will add this creature's entry into your in-game [[archive]].
