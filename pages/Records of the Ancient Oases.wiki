==Dialogue==
===Records of the Ancient Oases: Part I===
...Sandstorms have become more common recently. We hope that all villagers will work together to dredge the river and thus avoid its blockage by sand and gravel...<br>
...The Grand Mint, the Royal Docks, and the Construct Assembly Bureau want you if you are: Hardworking and familiar with pipeline work and the associated living conditions. Monthly wages: 30 to 50 bronze coins, depending on job scope.<br>
...All talk of "the Jinni Liloupar" are but baseless rumors. Take note and take care! Do not be ensnared!

===Records of the Ancient Oases: Part II ===
...Our prayers to the [[Nabu Malikata|Goddess of Flowers]] have borne fruit. Her envoy came to us in a moonbeam, granting us life-saving medicine and clean water...<br>...She called herself [[Liloupar]], born of the lilies, and she gave a final warning to us, the people of the Goddess...<br><br>...She embraced my daughter in her sleep before leaving in the morning, and did not touch our offerings... And now my daughter's fever has abated...<br>Fortunately, the illness was not a serious one, and would not affect work the next day, for His Majesty [[Parvezravan]]'s mercy does not extend to the seriously ill...<br>...<br>...At moonrise, she warned us that the water from the canal may carry disease. Something terrible has happened to the water source at [[Mt. Damavand]]...<br>...The others must be warned...<br><br>...His Majesty Parvezravan has built a new palace and factory, and the pay is high indeed. With that, we should be able to pay our delinquent taxes, but we must go to live at the work site. And if I go, who shall take care of my wife and daughter...?<br>...Is the water there clean?

===Records of the Ancient Oases: Part III===
...They say that Jinn-powered machines fill that giant labyrinth...<br>
...From morning till night, they drive the screaming [[Jinni|Jinn]] with nine-tailed whips... and so the Jinn pull, grind, and turn, and so do all things flow from the machines like water...<br>
...But what of those people? Do those who stand guard by the machines day and night, whips in hand, scream too?<br>
...And what sorts of whips do those who drive the guards on carry?

===Records of the Ancient Oases: Part IV===
...The arts of Jinn Fragment constructs have progressed much of late, and the income from industry and mines are enough to support the nation's expenses...<br>
...His Merciful Majesty, Parvezravan, has announced that his people shall have amnesty from poll taxes...

===Records of the Ancient Oases: Part V===
...Tax contractor changes... Nightingale Arak Distillery...<br>...Six of one, without greed, those who do not drink or are underage must pay additional fees...<br>...Villagers must remember to change their tax contracts at the security station...

=== Records of the Ancient Oases: Part VI===
...The machines operate too quickly and will wound people at times, and badly, too. Yet machines are valuable, while manpower can simply be replaced...<br>
...Another night without sleep. Mahrak says that she heard screaming from the factory. The old folks say that it's the howling of shattered Jinn...<br>
...Can Jinn feel agony too? Do they hate this labor that runs like water just as we do?<br>
...Mahrak claims that she met a woman in the factory at midnight, dressed like the dancing girls of the [[Sabzeruz Festival]], and yet appearing like a Jinn-Mother... and the machines fell silent at her arrival...<br>
...<br>
...Liloupar, she called herself. She came amongst us and sang for us, and she stayed with us in silence...<br>
...She could cure our exhaustion and hurts, and she could even heal those who had their fingers bitten off or limbs churned away by berserk machines.<br>
...She also said that she could only come to us in secret when there was moonlight, or her healing benediction could not work...<br>
...Mahrak was taken away by armored people. Her and her big mouth...

=== Records of the Ancient Oases: Part VII===
...<br>
...The compensation for work-related injuries has arrived. It is in hard currency... enough to feed the family for a whole year... Ha, perhaps I should have gotten injured right from the start...<br>
...They say that the injury was due to an operational error, but I know. I've already heard this one...<br>
...It is just as Liloupar told us every night! Those machines contain bloodthirsty, misbegotten creatures...<br>
...They have been trapped within, and are driven by pain and hatred, forgotten and abandoned by the world...<br>
...Only by freeing them can we free ourselves... Yes, free ourselves from our cruel, indifferent "freedom"...<br>
...But she asked me not to think all manner of wild thoughts and take care of myself, for there is work to do tomorrow. There is work to do every day...

===Records of the Ancient Oases: Part VIII===
...<br>
...We must universalize mechanical principles and maintenance measures amongst the workers and increase their awareness of safe operating procedures. These silly "vengeful Jinn" stories and other senseless talk have permeated amongst the laborers, to the point where it is affecting productivity...<br>
...<br>
...considering the constraints of the current situation, we must hold a meeting to prevent the further spread of wild rumors such as this talk of "[[Liloupar]]," "Brass Mask," or "[[Shiruyeh|The Exiled Prince]]," and thus curb the potential for unrest in such avenues...

===Records of the Ancient Oases: Part IX===
...<br>
...For the third time in this half-month, a great fire in the factory was put out...<br>
...The armored envoy agreed to everyone's request and promised to both extend the vacation and pay us our wages in hard currency... But it seems that this compromise was struck too easily. Well, she was wearing armor...<br>
...They say that some areas have been locked down, and that silent mechanical constructs roam those areas...<br>
...Machines are not like soldiers... they do not listen to reason...<br>
...<br>
...Work has ceased for three days. They say things are terrible beyond words over there...<br>
...<br>
...Those who were fortunate to survive were not compensated for the damages. [[Liloupar]] said that she is unable to revive those who have died. She cried ever so sadly...

===Records of the Ancient Oases: Part X===
...<br>
...[[Liloupar]] told us that "the day draws near," and the masked messengers have also sent word to us in the middle of the night...<br>
...I must remind everyone to be vigilant. Vengeance comes like a thief! Who knows when it shall arrive...<br>
...But day comes all the same, and then we must work. If only vengeance's coming wouldn't disturb our rest...<br>
...
