|description    = These creatures dwell within The Chasm, absorbing the energies of the strange stones within and emitting a dim light. Because they give off light, they are loved by miners and considered a good omen, hence the name "Lucklight."<br>Having gotten used to life in The Realm Within, they still practice their usual living habits, but since their habitat has grown larger, they are now quite hard to find, except on quiet nights.
