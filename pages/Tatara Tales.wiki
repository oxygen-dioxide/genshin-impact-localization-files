==Summary==
A few years ago, for the purpose of expanding the production capacity of [[Jade Steel]], the [[Tenryou Commission]] hired experts from Fontaine to build the Mikage Furnace, powering it with the power of the [[Tatarigami]]. However, recently due to the war breaking out between the [[Inazuma Shogunate|Shogunate]] and the [[Watatsumi Army|Sangonomiya Resistance]], this power has begun to spiral out of control, leading the soldier Toranosuke and shrine maiden Miyuki to be at odds with each other. The Traveler decides to see what they can do about the situation and seeks out [[Xavier]], one of the consultants from [[Fontaine]] who stayed behind in Inazuma. After a quick investigation, it is discovered that the [[Fatui]] are the origin of the problems.

Over the 7 days of quests, the Traveler talks with Xavier and takes short trips to the Mikage Furnace to perform tasks such as investigating the area's conditions, gathering data. repairing paths. Sometimes along these preparations, small groups of Fatui will get in the way. After everything is done, Xavier and the Traveler go into the contaminated area together on a last trip to purify the Tatarigami Core which powers the facility, bringing it back to normal functionality.
