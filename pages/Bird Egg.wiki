'''Bird Eggs''' are a [[Cooking Ingredient]] commonly found in the wild all over [[Teyvat]].
==How to Obtain==
Bird Eggs can be found in bird nests and critter hideouts around [[Teyvat]], usually in hard to reach, elevated and/or obscured areas such as trees and cliffsides. They are often found in pairs in the same nest.

See the Video Guides section or the '''[https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=126 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for specific locations.

When destroyed, bushes may also sometimes drop a single Bird Egg. [[Tumbleweed]]s found in the [[Great Red Sand]] drop them likewise.

Bird Eggs can also be obtained from [[Expeditions]] in the following locations:
* [[Mondstadt]] ([[Stormbearer Mountains]])
* [[Inazuma]] ([[Musoujin Gorge]])
* [[Sumeru]] ([[Ashavan Realm]])
