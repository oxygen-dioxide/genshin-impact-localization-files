:;(Opens Meztli<nowiki>:</nowiki> People of the Springs Reputation menu)
:{{DIcon}} Hello. What is this place? ''(Available after unlocking Tribe Reputation)''
::'''Caramuru:''' This is an Obsidian Totem Pole. Pretty awesome, huh? They say you can directly connect to the [[Wayob]] here!
::'''Caramuru:''' It's just that sorta sacred relic... although the details escape me. Haha, that's what you get when you've never been good at history.
::'''Caramuru:''' If there's anything more you'd like to know, feel free to consult the person on the night shift!
::'''Caramuru:''' Whatever the case, so long as you're willing to help us People of the Springs a little, the Totem Pole won't do you dirty.
:{{DIcon}} Good day.
::'''Caramuru:''' Hello, hello! Sorry, but I can't chat for too long.
::'''Caramuru:''' Now I'm not an introvert, but working hours are as they are, and getting caught slacking off could go badly for me.
::'''Caramuru:''' What work am I doing, you ask? Why, shift duty! And how will I do that? ... Well, by being here, am I right?

::'''Caramuru:''' If you want to listen to some music with me, feel free! An extra companion wouldn't hurt!
