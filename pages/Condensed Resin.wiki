'''Condensed Resin''' is a [[consumables|consumable]] that can be created through [[Alchemy]]. It can be used to revitalize [[Ley Line Blossom]]s from [[Ley Line Outcrops]] or Petrified Trees in [[Domains]] to receive 2 sets of rewards at one time. Both sets of rewards are random.

Reach [[Reputation]] Level 3 in [[Liyue]] to obtain [[Instructions: Condensed Resin]].

Players can hold a maximum of 5 Condensed Resin at once. Attempting to hold or craft more than 5 Condensed Resin will trigger an error message of "Item amount exceeds max limit. Max limit: 5."

==Notes==
*Crafting Condensed Resin counts toward the "using Original Resin" counter for the [[Battle Pass]], but spending Condensed Resin doesn't count toward said counter.
*Spending Condensed Resin grants {{Item|Adventure EXP|24|x=200}}.
*Condensed Resin cannot be used on Trounce Blossoms for [[Normal Bosses|Normal]] and [[Weekly Bosses]].
**Condensed Resin also cannot be used to claim rewards during [[Events]] that cost Original Resin, unless specified by the Event's details.
*For the [[Bounty of the Earth]] achievement that requires the player to collect a total of 800 rewards from [[Ley Line Blossom]]s (Blossoms of Wealth or Blossoms of Revelation), Condensed Resin will only make the counter go up by one instead of two.
