==Notes==
*Crafting Condensed Resin counts toward the "using Original Resin" counter for the [[Battle Pass]], but spending Condensed Resin doesn't count toward said counter.
*Spending Condensed Resin grants {{Item|Adventure EXP|24|x=200}}.
*Condensed Resin cannot be used on Trounce Blossoms for [[Normal Bosses|Normal]] and [[Weekly Bosses]].
**Condensed Resin also cannot be used to claim rewards during [[Events]] that cost Original Resin, unless specified by the Event's details.
*For the [[Bounty of the Earth]] achievement that requires the player to collect a total of 800 rewards from [[Ley Line Blossom]]s (Blossoms of Wealth or Blossoms of Revelation), Condensed Resin will only make the counter go up by one instead of two.
