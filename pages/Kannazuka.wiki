| Legend has it that Kannazuka means "the hill where no gods reside." Until now, Kannazuka is disputed territory between the Shogunate and Sangonomiya.<br /><br />Kannazuka has a mountainous terrain with high steep cliffs. In the midst of the rocky outcrops lies Mikage Furnace, the largest smelting facility in Inazuma. This is where Jade Steel is made, a rare material that is used in Inazuma to forge swords.

|[[Kujou Encampment]]
|The Shogunate's military camp in Kannazuka.<br /><br />There will always be an irreconcilable conflict between the people of Narukami who believe in the Raiden Shogun and the people of Sangonomiya who believe in Watatsumi Omikami. The strife between both parties has only worsened since the Vision Hunt Decree was enforced.<br /><br />To put down the Sangonomiya rebellion, the Tenryou Commission has stationed the Shogun's Army here. Compared to the Sangonomiya forces, the Shogun's Army has more troops, is better trained, and is well-equipped. Victory seems assured for the latter.
