==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Farghani:''' Why is discrepancy always inevitable at this point of calculation...?
:{{DIcon}} What are you calculating?
::'''Farghani:''' Before I answer your question, let me ask you one: What do you think Teyvat is like?
::'''Farghani:''' You don't have to respond, just think.
::'''Farghani:''' I have a revolutionary idea... If Teyvat was round, that would explain a lot of things.
::'''Farghani:''' Why are there currents in oceans? Why would the sun and moon alternate rising? Why would there be changes in temperature?
::'''Farghani:''' All that could be explained with the round-earth theory!
::{{DIcon}} So what's the discrepancy?
::'''Farghani:''' *sigh* That there's the rub.
::'''Farghani:''' My theory is perfect, but the calculation of land surface doesn't bear that out...
::'''Farghani:''' Damn it, I shouldn't have ditched math classes in school! It's all Vikram's fault!
::{{DIcon}} Why blame him?
::'''Farghani:''' That's because he asked me to skip classes with him. Whenever there was a class he found boring, he would grab me and have coffee in the downtown area.
::'''Farghani:''' But that guy did surprisingly well in all the foundation courses. I suspect that he dragged me out of classes on purpose, while he studied by himself at night.
::'''Farghani:''' Ah, time passes so quickly. I didn't expect him to be a candidate for the next Grand Conservator now.
::'''Farghani:''' I hope he gets elected so I can go around telling everyone that I skipped classes with the Grand Conservator back in the day.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Farghani:''' Where did it go wrong...?

==Trivia==
* He is named for the Persian astronomer Al-Farghani (in full ''Abū al-ʿAbbās Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad ibn Kathīr al-Farghānī'', and often known as Alfraganus in the West), who formulated a more accurate figure for the size of the Earth than the philosophers of antiquity. His talks of a "discrepancy" appears to be a nod to Christopher Columbus' incorrect estimate of the size of the Earth being based on interpreting Al-Farghani's figures as being in Roman rather than Arabic miles.
