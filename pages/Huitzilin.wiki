'''Huitzilin''' was a shaman in the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]] who lived 200 years ago.

==Profile==
Huitzilin was a legendary shaman and scroll-weaver appointed by the [[Iktomisaurus]] Elder [[Tlapo]], who was also her Saurian companion who she called Claw. In her youth, she challenged fellow student [[Citlali]] and lost, though in subsequent visits, she soon began to bring snacks for her too. She would continue challenging her for twenty years, resulting in a draw which prompted Citlali to accept her snacks.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Citlali|4}}</ref>

She was especially skilled in the art of color manipulation. Chief [[Biram]] believes that the scroll depicting her, by the craftsmanship alone, was likely her own work.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Legendary "Color"}}</ref>

Huitzilin would have her students "taunt" Citlali with provocative graffiti outside her home, which was considered a direct and unignorable challenge. This was not out of spite, as Huitzilin respected Citlali's strength and was said to understand it the best compared to anyone &mdash; in fact, those who were brave enough to face her would make exceptional achievements in their future, eventually becoming a tradition of her own. After Huitzilin's passing, her disciples and descendants would continue to challenge her, even though it meant constant defeat.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Citlali|1}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Huitzilin is a woman with fair skin, long braided blonde hair, brown eyes, and Masters of the Night-Wind-styled shaman attire.<ref name=":0">{{Ref/Quest|page=The Color of Memory}}</ref> In a woven scroll, she is also depicted wearing a circlet, and with glowing ginger hair.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|page=Calling from the Masters of the Night-Wind}}</ref>

In her elder years before her death, Huitzilin dons the same shaman attire and circlet, but with shorter, beige-colored hair.<ref name=":0" />
