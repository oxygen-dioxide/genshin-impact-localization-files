'''Box of Leaves''' is a Quest Item that are obtained upon picking one leaf from the massive oak tree at [[Windrise]] for [[Dr. Edith]] during the ''[[Leaves on the Wind]]'' [[Commission]]. A total of four <!--or five?, needs checking--> boxes can be obtained during the commission, but Dr. Edith only requires a minimum of three boxes.
