==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Cauich:''' "Do not fear failure or death. They are but an omen of coming glory."
:{{DIcon|Reputation}} About my reputation with the Children of Echoes... ''(Available after unlocking [[Tribe Reputation]])''
::'''Cauich:''' Thank you for your help. May you go undefeated even in this nation of conflict.
:{{DIcon}} Hello. What is this place? ''(Available after unlocking Tribe Reputation)''
::'''Cauich:''' Ah, this? It is the center of our tribal beliefs, the Obsidian Totem Pole. It is the symbol of the connection between the tribes and the Night Kingdom.
::'''Cauich:''' Not everyone here can communicate with the Wayob through these totems, though.
::'''Cauich:''' Only a very small number of distinguished, or notably powerful individuals can accomplish that, and most of them are Masters of the Night-Wind.
::'''Cauich:''' Still, you may yet get a response from it if you help our tribe with some commissions.
::'''Cauich:''' Manpower's always at a premium, so it's definitely worth a shot.
:{{DIcon}} Death and failure...
::'''Cauich:''' Haha, you might not know this, but here, even warriors who fail have a chance to start over.
::'''Cauich:''' As long as you've got an Ancient Name as I do, and the companions who fight alongside you succeed, you can return to the battlefield even should you fail.
::'''Cauich:''' To be honest, I've had experience... You know, being dead. Wasn't fun, but fortunately, I wasn't alone.
::'''Cauich:''' *sigh* It's just a shame I'm getting on in years... But perhaps, one day, my Ancient Name will carry my story on and find itself a new bearer.
:{{DIcon}} I wish you the best of luck.
::'''Cauich:''' Thank you, friend.

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
* ''Cauich'' comes from ''ca'' meaning "double" and ''uich'' meaning "face" thus interpreted as "double-faced." ''Cauich'' was another name for {{w|Hunac Ceel}}, a Maya general who conquered Chichen Itzá and founded the Cocom dynasty.
