'''Tyler''' is a [[Treasure Hoarder]] who makes an appearance in Act I: [[Beyond This World's Stars]] of the [[Astrolabos Chapter]].

==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Tyler is a Treasure Hoarder who disguises himself as a merchant alongside his 'brothers', claiming he recently began business in [[Liyue]] and is currently heading back to [[Mondstadt]]. He offers to lend a hand and tells Mona, [[Paimon]], and the [[Traveler]] that they can come along in a cart they supposedly hired. Although Tyler seems friendly enough, Mona rejects their offers, and immediately (and correctly) comes to the conclusion that Tyler and his brother are Treasure Hoarders.

Following this, Tyler's demeanor turns brash and admits that he's a Treasure Hoarder, but tries to get rid of Mona so no one will ever have to find out about his true, ulterior motives. A fight sequence follows in which the player can fight in a trial as Mona, and once over, Tyler and his fellow Treasure Hoarders have disappeared.
