'''''"Polychrome Tri-Stars"''''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Duelist: Series I]]''. To complete this achievement, the player needs to defeat the [[Local Legend|Local Legends]] {{Enemy|Fatui Skirmisher - Pyroslinger Bracer|text=Polychrome Tri-Stars: Vasily}}, {{Enemy|Fatui Skirmisher - Cryogunner Legionnaire|text=Polychrome Tri-Stars: Sidorenko}}, and {{Enemy|Fatui Skirmisher - Electrohammer Vanguard|text=Polychrome Tri-Stars: Nomokonov}}, while defeating Vasily first.

Upon Vasily's death, he will buff both Sidorenko and Nomokonov's ATK by 200%. It is important to avoid Nomokonov at all costs, as Sidorenko's attacks deal less DMG compared to Nomokonov, who is likely to deal massive damage or even outright kill characters in a single hit. Likewise, the projectile that Nomokonov drops on death will instantly kill any character in its radius.
