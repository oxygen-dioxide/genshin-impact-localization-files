|[[Settlement for Exiles]]
|[[Aaru Village]]
|In this shelter congregating those that still linger,<br>The light of a lamp basks the corner in such peace.
|-
|[[Ruins of Scorching Might]]
|[[The Mausoleum of King Deshret]]
|Twilight hues color of a lonely sky,<br>A dirge succumbs beneath crimson sand.
|-
|[[Her Wishes]]
|[[The Orchard of Pairidaeza]]
|A paradise of eternal tranquility<br>But momentarily, strayed from the cycles of time.
|-
|[[Benevolence Bequeathed]]
|[[Sanctuary of Surasthana]]
|Beneath the dome of the grand temple,<br>The light of wisdom shines evermore.
|-
|[[Polumnia Omnia]]
|[[Joururi Workshop]]
|For those who yearn to forge a god,<br>Only futility awaits.
