{{Description|An ancient emblem that was once awarded to those who had made exceptional contributions in battle.}}
'''Hunter's Brooch''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Marechaussee Hunter]].

==Description==
This emblem was specially designed and given to those who had, in the past,<br>
Performed feats of arms in Fontaine's defense. Insignias of this sort were largely symbols of glory,<br>
But some awardees would conceal them or consign them to the water.

"Pursue the phantoms in the dark, expel them all, and hunt them down."<br>
Such is the origin of the name "Marechaussee Hunter,"<br>
Credited to one [[Cassiodor]], who would be elevated to the revered title of "Golden Hunter,"<br>
But who saw the name as a humiliation.<br>
Yet, heretics and demons are rare, but people who are driven to become heretics and demons are legion.<br>
Today, the [[Marechaussee Phantom]] is more focused on investigating criminal activity than battle,<br>
And has absorbed into its ranks a large number of [[Melusine]]s, members of a young race.

This emblem once belonged to a [[Emanuel Guillotin|Marechaussee Hunter]] who took part in and directed the [[Siege of Poisson]].<br>
Due to this event, he left the ranks of the Marechaussee and planned to live out the rest of his days, content with the contents of his cup.<br>
It was not until an [[Basil Elton|old friend]] requested that he, against his will, try living with others again,<br>
That he tried to create a world free of dark phantoms for his [[Alain Guillotin|son]] and [[Mary-Ann Guillotin|daughter]].<br>
At the end, that which welcomed him was a [[Primordial Sea|peaceful ocean]], one which removed all barriers and estrangements.
