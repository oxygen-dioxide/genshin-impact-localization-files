'''A Prize Catch''' is a [[Special Dish]] that the player has a chance to obtain by cooking [[Calla Lily Seafood Soup]] with [[Tartaglia]]. The recipe for Calla Lily Seafood Soup is obtainable from [[Sara]] in [[Good Hunter]] (located in the [[City of Mondstadt]]) for 5,000 [[Mora]] after reaching [[Adventure Rank]] 30.

A Prize Catch increases the party's defense by '''282''' for 300 seconds. Like most foods, this has no effect for other players in [[Co-Op Mode]]; this effect only applies to the player's party.
