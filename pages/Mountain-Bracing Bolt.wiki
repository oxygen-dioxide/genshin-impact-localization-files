==Description==
In those days, the [[Cataclysm|dark tide]] had yet to arise. In those days, the sounds of metal shook the skies in the [[Nanatzcayan]]'s mountains, and the sparks never ceased to fly.<br><!--
-->The miners had worked day and night for months on end to make an important item that was not to be neglected.<br><!--
-->It is said that this item was intimately associated with the mines' safety and the tribe's survival, and the elders named it the "Mountain-Bracing Bolt."<br><!--
-->Whenever the earth would shake and the mountains move, peace could only be purchased by way of tribute, thrown to the mountain spirits in their deepest caverns.<br><br><!--
-->Though it was an ancient ritual indeed, passed down across thousands of years, young [[Sundjatta]] mocked it.<br><!--
-->He understood the flow of the rocks and the paths veins of ore took, and believed that there must be some reason for the frequent collapses.<br><!--
-->Perhaps excessive excavation had rendered the mountains tottering wrecks, or perhaps the earth dragons beneath the springs were up to some mischief.<br><!--
-->Regardless, he was determined to venture into the tribe's taboo caverns to uncover the secrets hidden therein.<br><br><!--
-->On he followed the rocky arteries, and on he strove through pitch-black caves. Nothing could stay him.<br><!--
-->In the deepest depths of the cavern, palisades of long nails arrayed like perilous peaks stood guard over the gate into spaces deeper still.<br><!--
-->This was forbidden territory in which no human had stepped for a thousand years, and yet, there he found marks of recent excavations.<br><!--
-->Tunnels, snaking through the underground world, and whither they went, none knew.<br><br><!--
-->At last, following the underground river upstream, he saw a faint glimmer flickering at the exit of the tunnel.<br><!--
-->After he had grown used to the harshness of light, which he had not seen in a long while, what appeared before him was a ruin blanketed in ash.<br><!--
-->This was once an underground bastion belonging to the [[Och-Kan|usurper]] of [[Cinder City]] and had also once been a place where miners sought shelter in antiquity.<br><!--
-->The blind Stegosaurus that resided within the rocky cliffs was, so it seemed, the one responsible for this passage once again seeing the light of day.<br><br><!--
-->"Yes, this tunnel was only known to those skilled craftspeople who the tyrannical Python King pressed into service in Cinder City."<br><!--
-->"When the furious usurper aimed to erase the traces of draconic craft, when his folly drew both demons and evils divine,"<br><!--
-->"It was through these tunnels that our forebears escaped into the deserted mountains."<br><br><!--
-->But though the sacred passage into the dragon's lair was sealed, bloodthirsty hordes sniffed their way to it all the same.<br><!--
-->So to defend their new home atop [[Tequemecan Valley]], the tribe's warriors sang their echoing war-songs.<br><!--
-->Sharp blades and long spears in hand, they stepped into the pitch-dark caves and fought viciously against nameless entities darker still.<br><!--
-->One weapon after another shattered in their hands, and those in the mountains forged and reforged yet more for them.<br><!--
-->And so the battle raged for days and nights without number, until the nightmarish howling and the sounds of clashing stone and metal stopped as one.<br><br><!--
-->This was the Mountain-Bracing Bolt, which bestowed a blessing upon those who had once remained hidden, and who fought for their freedom and their land,<br><!--
-->Only to fall before daybreak, they who sacrificed themselves so that dawn might come &mdash; a blessing that endures to this very day.<br><br><!--
-->And when the dark tide arose upon the horizon, the sounds of metal shook the skies in the Nanatzcayan's mountains, and the sparks never ceased to fly.<br><!--
-->The running, melted mountain rock was meticulously shaped by the craftsmen into keen lances.<br><!--
-->Sundjatta, chief of the mines, clambered upon the back of the Stegosaurus [[Muhuru]], and took one up from amidst the cliff walls.<br><!--
-->Thus did a new battle begin, bearing the new flame rekindled from the ashes, and the blessings molded from countless wishes.

== Trivia==
* [[Kachina]] is seen wielding this polearm during a still image and various cutscenes in {{Quest|Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame (Quest)}}, and again during {{Quest|The Surging Darkness}}, the former of which is the first appearance of Mountain-Bracing Bolt before its official debut in Version 5.1.
** As a result of Mountain-Bracing Bolt being unavailable before Version 5.1, Kachina is seen wielding [[Footprint of the Rainbow]] during the playable combat segments in between cutscenes in Chapter V: Act I.
