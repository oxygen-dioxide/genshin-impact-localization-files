{{Description|A portable metal vessel containing strong wine. Can be stuffed into the pocket of an outer coat for ease of access and use.}}
'''Forgotten Vessel''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Marechaussee Hunter]].

==Description==
Once, this wine vessel belonged to [[Emanuel Guillotin|one]] who rendered great service to the [[Court of Fontaine]].<br>
Those who find themselves doing certain work, unless they be born ruthless and cruel,<br>
Will eventually walk down the path to total collapse should they go without the elixir within.

This belonged to one who had to do what had to be done for Fontaine's peace.<br>
It was only many years after he retired due to injury, during his final investigation, that he realized...<br>
...No wonderland lay in welcome down the rabbit hole — only the maelstrom.

...
Memories arose like bubbles from a ruptured diving mask.<br>
He thought of his youth, of the games he would play with [[Dwight Lasker|Dwight]], [[Basil Elton|Basil]], and [[Karl Ingold|Karl]].<br>
In those days, he always played the hero, and Karl would be Jabberwock the evil dragon,<br>
He thought of the embrace of the [[Lyris|Director]], so dear and familiar, and he felt so similarly in this moment.<br>
He recalled the countless faces warped by hate in the crimson flames of [[Poisson]],<br>
And then he recalled that he, too, had sent [[Jakob|innocent]] [[Rene|children]] to the [[Narzissenkreuz Institute]].

In the end, what came clearest to him was what he had felt upon meeting his "son" and "daughter."<br>
It was like seeing light at the end of a long tunnel, like seeing himself before he had worn the mask.<br>
But much like clinging to a spider's thread futilely in the dark pits of hell—<br>
"My dear [[Alain Guillotin|Alain]], my dear [[Mary-Ann Guillotin|Mary-Ann]]... I was never close to you,"<br>
"And even at the end, I do not know how I could be a "father" to you."<br>
"But still, I do not wish to lose these memories of watching the two of you growing up..."<br>
—When he awoke from his stupor, all glories, all shame, all love and obsession — they had been dissolved in the [[Primordial Sea|waters]].

==Trivia==
* One 4-star Forgotten Vessel can be obtained from the Luxurious [[Chest]] in [[Kuisel's Clockwork Workshop]] unlocked after redeeming all [[Energy Concentrating Component]]s.
