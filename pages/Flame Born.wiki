{{Description|[[Il Dottore]] left [[Mondstadt]] and withdrew his envoys, but a freak accident threatened to break the peace. Sir [[Kaeya]] of the [[Knights of Favonius]] suspected an [[Diluc|old friend]] to be behind this while his young aide [[Amber]] the Outrider made a chance discovery.}}
'''Flame Born''' is Chapter 2 of the ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' [[manga]].

==Summary==
The [[Knights of Favonius]] escort a cart of diplomats. On the way, [[Kaeya]] eavesdrops on their conversation about [[The Doctor|Dottore]], whom he doesn't want to get involved with. Meanwhile, a mysterious [[Collei|girl]] approaches [[Mondstadt City|Mondstadt]]'s front gates. Her sickly appearance causes the guards to turn her down. Angered, she unleashes black flames onto the diplomats’ cart as it is exiting and escapes into the city.

At the [[Knights of Favonius Headquarters]], Acting Grand Master [[Jean]] assigns Kaeya and [[Amber]] to investigate the situation. Afterwards, Kaeya pushes away Amber's assistance and heads off on his own. He then visits [[Diluc]] for questioning though the latter turns down his involvement in the incident.

Meanwhile, Amber is upset at Kaeya for treating her like a rookie. She then notices the mysterious girl at the statue of [[Barbatos]] and approaches her.
