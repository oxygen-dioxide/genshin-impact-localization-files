|description  = A whole piece of radiant shell liberated from a Furnace Shell Mountain Weasel's back after its defeat.<br>It is said that the more [[Phlogiston]] a Furnace Shell Mountain Weasel has stored in its back, the higher its status in the pack. The reasoning for this phenomenon may be quite simple: More dominant Furnace Shell Mountain Weasels likely have less need to call on their Phlogiston reserves than their less prominent peers.
