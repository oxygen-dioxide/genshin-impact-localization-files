==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->

She is traveling alone as her husband is too lazy to join her. Once the Sakoku Decree lifted, Susan can be seen in [[Sumeru]].

===Appearance===
Susan has shoulder-length black hair. She wears a red and white dress. Her accessories consist of a red choker necklace, and a red bracelet on both of her hands.
