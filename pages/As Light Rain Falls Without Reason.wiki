==Summary==
;Like the Faint Moonlight of Yesteryear

Arriving at [[Hotel Debord]], [[Navia]] orders food as the three sit at a table and begin to enjoy it. They talk about the disappearance case; due to the previous trial, they now know that there is an organization behind the disappearances, though unsure as to their motives. While Paimon laments the fact that they were close to finding out who they were, Navia expresses a lack of faith in the Garde, stating that they needed to look at the case from another perspective to gain more clues. Navia then asks them what they plan to do, learning that they wanted to speak with [[Furina]] as part of their journey to find the truth of Teyvat, though the chance was lost after the trial. Navia then suggests less legitimate means, though the Traveler and Paimon shoot them down. However, this results in them getting an idea to talk to her while she's on break, since Navia believes that Furina was embarrassed after losing the trial.

Navia then notices that her [[Fonta]] was gone, resulting in Paimon apologizing for drinking it. The Traveler and Paimon note that the Fonta tasted salty, so Navia decides to blacklist the hotel's Fonta should they return. She later sees them off, promising to help them with their requests should the need arrive. 

Returning to the [[Fountain of Lucine]] that same evening, both Paimon and the Traveler hears a voice calling for Vacher from the fountain and walks towards it, the Traveler blacking out in the process. When they come to, they find themselves mentally connected with an [[Oceanid]], asking them about Vacher. The Traveler tells it they are not Vacher, while the Oceanid tells them that it has lost a lot of their memories while human, causing them to realize that they were one of the disappearing girls. The Traveler offers to find Vacher, but the Oceanid refuses, as their reunion has since long passed and that Vacher had no choice but to move on with his life. She laments the fact that she could not comfort Vacher as she was dissolving, but nonetheless is glad that they sensed her presence and tells them to tell Vacher to forget about her before sending them out, as Paimon was calling for them.

When the Traveler comes back to the real world, they immediately find Navia, [[Silver]] and [[Melus]] fighting a large horde of [[Clockwork Meka]]. During the battle, Navia spots [[Clorinde]], and her assistance allows them to defeat the entire horde. Afterwards, Navia asks Clorinde how she managed arrive in time, who admits that she was following her because danger had been tracking her too closely as of late and wanted to honor [[Callas|her father's]] wishes, though this simply creates tension as Navia is still upset about her father's demise. Getting back to the point, Clorinde tells them that the mastermind behind the disappearances is very powerful and that their performance would certainly attract their attention. Navia asks her how the Meka were controlled, as the Gardemeks could only be operated by the [[Maison Gardiennage]]. Clorinde tells her that these were illegal meka, as they had no serial numbers when she checked them and likely served as a private force for some rich or powerful individual. She warns them to be careful, though Navia insists that they'll find the truth behind the matter.

As Clorinde leaves, Melus tells Navia that she could have tried to thaw relations, though Navia admits she finds it hard to do so. Paimon tells the Traveler that the Meka appeared after they fell unconscious, only for Navia and her group to save her. Navia credits Paimon for tipping her off, as Fonta is sweet, not salty, and recalled that the color of the Fonta she'd been served at the hotel had been off - she came to realize that it had been spiked with water from the [[Primordial Sea]], and Paimon had accidentally thwarted an assassination attempt on her. Navia also realized that the Traveler was in danger and came to their rescue. As Paimon had also been able to hear the Oceanid this time, they put together from what Lynette had told them that the Primordial Seawater she drank had raised her Hydro sensitivity. The Traveler then tells her about the Oceanid they encountered in the water, giving them a good lead. With the Traveler and Paimon volunteering to fully join Navia's investigation, Navia takes them to one of [[Spina di Rosula]]'s bases to stay for the night and discuss it further.

Heading into the sewers of the Court of Fontaine, the group catches up to Melus, who had gone ahead to prepare the night's accommodations. Navia admits that when her father was the head of Spina di Rosula, their funding was much better. Asking about her father, they learn from her that three years ago, her father, Callas, was accused of murdering his friend [[Jacques]], but rather than standing trial, he chose to duel to maintain his honor, only to die doing so. He had even refused to yield once he was sufficiently injured enough for it to count as a loss. Therefore, coupled with the death of her mother (who he had hidden from her also), she was resolved to find the truth, believing that the disappearance cases was tied to the murder. Melus reveals that the duelist who killed Callas was Clorinde, hence their strained relationship. Clorinde had let them know afterward that before the duel started Callas asked her to ensure Navia was kept safe, indicating that he was determined to die in the arena.

The following day, the Traveler and Paimon find Navia greeting them, who had sent Melus and Silver back to their headquarters in [[Poisson]]. She had spent the night trying to find out who Vacher was, but discovered that there were no public records of him at all. However, she decides that there is one place that they could never reach - the case file archives stored by [[Neuvillette]], which would be their best bet to find more information. Despite having suggested it herself, Navia is hesitant about it but pushes forward nonetheless.
----
;The Truth, Lost With the Rain

Heading to Neuvillette's office at the [[Palais Mermonia]], the three are stopped by [[Sedene]], who asks the reason for their visit. Navia claims they came to archive information on a follow-up case, so Sedene lets them pass. They enter Neuvillette's office, with Paimon apologizing for the deception. Neuvillette does not mind and asks why they came, so Navia tells them that they were looking for a man named Vacher, who was a witness to the disappearance case. Neuvillette makes a thorough search through the files but finds nothing about Vacher. As they leave, he apologizes to Navia for Callas' death, resulting in her becoming offended as she knew he had no emotion behind his words and that even though he agreed that something was wrong with the case, he let the duel proceed. After calming down, she apologizes for taking her emotions out on him and leaves.

Outside, it begins to rain even though it had been sunny out just earlier, causing Navia to recall how it was raining the day Callas was convicted. When she confirms that it was also raining the night Jacques was murdered, the Traveler realizes that now knowing about Primordial Seawater, the real murderer might have been dissolved into water, and the rain helped to leave no evidence of their presence at the crime scene. Navia agrees, so they head to her headquarters in [[Poisson]] and catch up with Melus. There, Navia deduces that with her father's case, there had been a popular drink known as Sinthe, which with what they know now, she is certain was created with Primordial Seawater. Sinthe was popular for recreation, but the effects of long-term consumption describe the result of drug abuse and deeply affected the drinkers and their families. Callas, seeing the danger, banned it from his group which incurred the sellers' wrath. To learn more about the mastermind, he cultivated relationships with some of the vendors, such as [[Jacques]], who was ashamed of his work and eventually agreed to become his informant. During a banquet, Callas is assumed to have shot Jacques dead, though she now knows that a third party might have been involved as there were clothes lying around at the scene. Melus warns Navia that there was no shame in backing out of the case as their enemy was highly dangerous, but Navia insists on finding the truth.

Melus reveals that he had hidden more from Navia; Callas was diagnosed with an illness that left him with less than five years to live and that he had a contingency plan by exposing the dangers of Sinthe to the public - the group had targeted Navia as the next victim, but did not make an attempt on her life until now because their plans and motives would be exposed if they did so, as Callas would have had no reason not to reveal everything he knew in a court trial. Melus is confident that with the Traveler's help, she could uncover the truth for herself. He advises that they not storm their headquarters, as that was tantamount to war. Instead, he gives three potential suspects to investigate that he had weeded out over the past three years - [[Florent]], [[Thierry]] and [[Marcel (Fontaine)|Marcel]], but they first stop to check in with Jacques' family, who had stayed in Poisson ever since Callas had taken them in.

Collecting evidence, they discover that Jacques' betrayal was noticed by the higher-ups in his organization and his wife believes he was forced to kill Callas, but struggled with the order. They also learn that Callas was off on the day of the murder and that when he left the banquet to get some air outside, he had left his gun inside, ruling out the possibility that he had a second gun on him to kill Jacques. When they meet up with Thierry, she asks him about the Gardemeks that attacked her. He tells her that they were nearly impossible to modify without keeping a secret and that either someone rich and/or powerful could get their hands on private units. Finally, they meet up with Marcel; while he does not recall the events during the banquet, he is willing to defend her.

With all the information collected, the Traveler concludes that Marcel was the likely suspect, seeing that he was the only one of the three to be wealthy enough to afford private Meka. Before they could go any further, Thierry urgently informs them that the authorities have accused [[Tartaglia]] of the disappearances. Realizing what's going on, the Traveler offers to infiltrate the enemy headquarters while Navia goes to the opera house to accuse Marcel and stall for time.
----
;When All Return to the Waters

Heading underwater to the Sinthe production facility, the Traveler and Paimon arrive at the entrance and infiltrate it. Back at the opera house, Tartaglia is confused as to what he's being charged for but is willing to accept it if he could duel Clorinde again, as he was disappointed that she had held back in their sparring session. Before the trial could go anywhere, Navia barges in and accuses Marcel of being the prime suspect, referring back to her father's case. Neuvillette reiterates the official conclusions of the case for the record, which Navia refutes with the evidence she acquired. Furina asks for physical proof, which she does not have, but Navia states that it would be coming soon, while Neuvillette orders Marcel to court. She also reveals that she had been the next target in the disappearing cases, prompting Furina to ask why Callas did not want to defend himself. Navia explains that if Callas had done so, she and the rest of Spina di Rosula would have been targeted and many lives would have been lost. She then asks Clorinde to testify to Callas' state of mind in the arena, since she was the one who killed him.

Furina asks Clorinde if what Navia said was true, which she confirms; as a Champion Duelist, she could tell when someone was fighting to live or die, and that Callas wanted to die. Furina finds this as sufficient to open the case, but Neuvillette asks Navia to explain the link between her father and the disappearances. Navia states that on that day, the suspect would have had to attend both events and was willing to dissolve someone in water in front of many witnesses to protect their identity; coincidentally, Marcel was at both events. Marcel defends himself by stating that she was rushing headlong without sufficient evidence by proving where he was and pointing out he'd moved to Fontaine after the disappearances had begun, turning the scales in his favor. However, Navia pulls a trump card by mentioning Vacher, which catches him by surprise, confirming that he did know him.

Back at the Sinthe facility, the Traveler and Paimon begin to explore and fight through private meka units, reach the innermost sanctum and collecting evidence for Navia's case. They discover that Vacher was the one conducting the experiments. After collecting enough, they find the notebook of Vacher's lover Vigneire, containing Marcel's name. Vigneire had decided on it as the name for a future child they could have together.

Returning to the opera house, the Traveler accuses Marcel of truly being Vacher, inspired by the name of the child that never came to be and presents the evidence to Neuvillette, who asks Marcel to defend himself. Marcel does not, instead blaming the system for failing him as when he reported about the dissolving to the Garde, they simply laughed him off. He even drinks a large amount of the Primordial Seawater to prove it has no effect on non-Fontainians, and thus he couldn't commit suicide in a way that would reunite him with Vigneire. As he appears to show signs of mental distress, Neuvillette declares that Tartaglia is innocent and reviews the evidence provided by the Traveler, recollecting the entire event. He then submits the information into the [[Oratrice Mecanique d'Analyse Cardinale]], which returns a "Guilty" verdict. Tartaglia prepares to leave, but Neuvillette stops him, as he has to be formally cleared from the charges initially pressed against him. Neuvillette puts the information in the Oratrice, which hands a "Guilty" verdict on Tartaglia, surprising everyone present, as it was the first time that it gave a verdict different than his own. 

Tartaglia is unamused and attempts to escape using his {{Electro}} [[Delusion]] and his [[Foul Legacy Transformation]] taking down several Gardemeks. Before he could fully transform, however, Neuvillette leaps from his seat and crashes down on Tartaglia, using an unknown {{Hydro}} power to knock him out. As the Gardemeks apprehend Tartaglia, Neuvillette apologizes to him but promises to personally investigate the matter. Once the scene settles, the Traveler and Paimon talk to him about the verdict. He admits that it is the first time the machine had put him in a situation like this, but had to uphold the court rules nonetheless. Neuvillette suggests asking Furina, though when everyone stares at her, she becomes nervous and even shows signs of agitation before composing herself, claiming that the verdict was right and leaves to save face. Neuvillette assures the Traveler that he'll look into Childe's verdict on his own time and find the truth.

As the Traveler leaves the auditorium, they run into Marcel being escorted by Garde Esmond. Marcel asks the Traveler how they knew of Vacher, who tells them about the fountain. He asks to go to the fountain, which a passing Neuvillette grants as he accompanies them there. They then begin to hear Vigneire's voice and Marcel finds himself in the dream realm, witnessed by the Traveler. He meets the Oceanid, but it is not Vigneire, but instead the collective consciousnesses of the women he had dissolved and had merged with Vigneire, thus she knew of all of his crimes. The Oceanid tells him that Vigneire is avoiding him because of his actions and that she did not want him to come because they would kill him. The entire consciousness, including Vigneire, "drown" Marcel; in the real world, doctors rule his death as a panic attack.

A few days later, the Traveler and Paimon finish shopping in the rainy streets of the Court of Fontaine and cross paths with Navia. With her father's honor restored, Navia held a belated memorial for him with the rest of Spina di Rosula and made amends with Clorinde. She had decided to visit his grave and the Traveler asks to join her. When they arrive, they find Neuvillette there, who explains why he let the duel between him and Clorinde continue. He admits that he believed at the time that humans would prioritize their lives over justice, and if Callas was innocent, he surely wouldn't go so far as to let himself die for justice. To his sorrow, Callas had proved him wrong and that without his sacrifice, the case would have never been solved. After paying their own respects, the Traveler and Paimon asks Neuvillette several questions. He reveals that he had foreseen the possibility that one day he would conclude with a different verdict, and was prepared for such an outcome from the Oratrice. He promises to continue investigating Childe to prove his innocence and that Furina herself took the prophecy seriously.
