{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Summon Pillars
|desc_1 = Summons 4 pillars in a large triangle formation around the arena, it will sit on one at a time and teleport between them. These pillars take [[Poise Damage]], and are weakest against [[Blunt Attack]]s. When a pillar is destroyed, a Geo [[Energy|Energy Orb]] will be generated.
{{Elemental Shield Data|Geo|24|Pillar|cryoonly=1}}

|name_2 = Stone Pellets
|desc_2 = Flies into the air and forms a rhombus with its shell pieces before absorbing them all and using them to fire a continuous stream of stone pellets, dealing '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}} on hit. Move around to dodge.

|name_3 = Stone Seal
|desc_3 = Floats into the air and forms a sort of flat, plated formation out of shell pieces while channeling a {{Geo}} seal around the player. After a few seconds, it will break the seal and summon a large pillar at the player's location after a short delay, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}.

|name_4 = Shockwave
|desc_4 = Floats into the air and briefly channels energy into the pillar it is floating on before emitting a single shockwave, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}. This attack cannot be avoided using [[Sprinting#Dash|dash]] [[Invincibility Frames|i-frames]].

|name_5 = Tremors
|desc_5 = Spirals into the air and channels energy into its pillar, causing all pillars to emit continuous shockwaves for the duration of the attack, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DoT}}. Destroying the concentrated {{Geo}} energy near the Hypostasis' pillar creates a {{Geo}} forcefield that blocks the shockwaves. While inside the forcefield, destroy the pillar it is on to bring the Geo Hypostasis back down to ground level. This attack cannot be avoided using [[Sprinting#Dash|dash]] [[Invincibility Frames|i-frames]].
{{Elemental Shield Data|Geo|3|Concentrated Geo Energy|cryoonly=1}}

|name_6 = Hammerfall
|desc_6 = Teleports next to the player and forms its shell pieces into a giant hammer that it smashes into the ground, dealing '''150% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}} and sending out three trails of shockwaves in front of it that deal '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}. This attack can only be used once all of the Hypostasis' pillars have been destroyed.

|name_7 = Clap
|desc_7 = Quickly flies next to the player and forms a large wall, which folds in a "clapping" motion very quickly, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}} in front of the wall.

|name_8 = Rain of Rocks
|desc_8 = Causes pellets to continuously rain down in various small areas around the arena, dealing '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DoT}}. Particularly large chunks of rock periodically fall in the same areas, dealing '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}. This attack will only be used when the Hypostasis is on the ground, and only seems to work the first time it is used.

|name_9 = Terra Resurgence
|desc_9 = When HP is low (approx. 5%), the Hypostasis teleports to the center of the arena and forms 3 pillars that channel {{Geo}} energy. After 15 seconds, the pillars are absorbed to heal '''15%/35%/50%''' of its HP for '''1/2/3''' pillars absorbed. Destroy all pillars to immediately kill the Hypostasis. These pillars take [[Poise Damage]], and are weakest against [[Blunt Attack]]s. If a pillar is destroyed, it will not respawn the next time '''Terra Resurgence''' is used. If if this move is completed, the Hypostasis will use '''Summon Pillars'''. When a pillar is destroyed, a Geo [[Energy|Energy Orb]] will be generated.
{{Elemental Shield Data|Geo|8|Revival Pillar|cryoonly=1}}
}}

==Strategy==
When the fight is initiated, the Geo Hypostasis will immediately conjure four pillars as its starting attack. These {{Geo}} pillars can be damaged by any character, but [[Blunt Attack]]s such as those from [[claymores]], [[Plunging Attack|plunging attacks]], and {{Color|Geo DMG}} are the most effective in damaging them. The damage dealt to these pillars depends on the [[poise]] damage of the particular attack and whether it is blunt or not.

The Geo Hypostasis will warp around active pillars and use a varying range of attacks at its disposal. Its "'''Stone Pellets'''" attack can also damage the pillars, but deals very little damage compared to claymores and the {{Geo}} element. The core itself can be damaged by ranged attacks when hovering on a pillar.

Whenever it performs its Tremor attack, a concentrated batch of {{Geo}} energy will appear next to the pillar where it is floating on. Destroying this batch of energy will generate a {{Geo}} shield dome that protects players from these shockwaves, as long as they are inside it.

Destroying the pillar the Geo Hypostasis is floating on will automatically cancel its attack and it will crash to the ground, becoming dazed for several seconds in the process.

If all pillars are destroyed, the Geo Hypostasis tends to resummon them immediately, but may occasionally perform a few other attacks before doing so if it does not.

When it reaches 5% of its health, it will warp to the center of the field and summon three pillars in an attempt revive itself. As with the normal pillars during the battle, they are weak to Blunt Attacks, but these are far weaker than the ones during the fight. See [[Shields/Shield Gauge Data]] for general data on enemy shields.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|Code Name: Gimel. A high-purity [[Geo]] entity.<br />Elemental [[hypostases]] are ultra-compact structures with a high mass.<br />Concentrated elemental energy forms a solid shell around the core of the hypostasis, leaving only the core reactive to the elemental stimuli.|[[Adventurer Handbook]] and [[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* Each of the Hypostases are named after one of the letters of the Hebrew Alphabet, with {{Lang|"Gimel"|he=גּ|he_rm=Gimel}} being named after the third.
* Its codename was previously recorded as "Grimoire" in the [[Adventurer Handbook]], which did not match its monster title in-game.
