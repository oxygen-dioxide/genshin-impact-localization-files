==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Tiantian:''' Hi. How would you like to go on an adventure?
:'''Tiantian:''' If you like surviving in the wild, deep-water diving, and gliding at breakneck speed, then the Adventurers' Guild needs YOU!
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Tiantian:''' I'm a recruiter from the Adventurers' Guild!
::'''Tiantian:''' I'm on the lookout for budding new adventurers who meet the aforementioned criteria.
::'''Tiantian:''' ...Oh, and you can also join if you're into exploration, mountain-climbing, things like that.
:{{DIcon}} Does the Adventurers' Guild do those?
::'''Tiantian:''' Of course! Clue's in the name, specifically the 'adventure' part.
::'''Tiantian:''' Hehe, c'mon, don't look so skeptical. I'm actually an expert in adventuring, you know!
::'''Tiantian:''' ...Because I've read every last book on the topic from the [[Wanwen Bookhouse]]. I know my stuff!
::{{DIcon}} I thought adventurers just did commissions?
::'''Tiantian:''' Commissions? ...Oh, I know &mdash; you mean rich people who want the experience of going on an adventure, but also have safety concerns, so they hire us to take them on survival trips in the wild. Right?
::'''Tiantian:''' Trust me, all I need is my trusty knife and I can survive in any environment you put me in!
::'''Tiantian:''' If you join the Adventurers' Guild, I promise you will become an expert just like me in no time! Then you can take all the commissions you want!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Tiantian:''' C'mon, you should join! You'll have a blast!
