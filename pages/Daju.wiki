==Trivia==
* The name "Sir Pouncealot" in some localization may be a reference to [[w:c:dragonage:Ser Pounce-a-lot|Ser Pounce-a-lot]] from the {{W|Dragon Age}} franchise, which also happens to be a ginger cat.
* Daju can be fed with a [[Fish Seized From a Pelican's Mouth|special fish]]. This motivates the cat to show the Traveler an [[Chest|Exquisite Chest]]. The fish can be found in the mouth of the pelican called [[Dadao]] which is located on the docks of [[Qiaoying Village]].
