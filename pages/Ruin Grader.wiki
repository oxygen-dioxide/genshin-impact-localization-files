* Weak points are not exposed when the Ruin Grader is paralyzed.

==Abilities==
''Most ability names are unofficial.''
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Clap
|desc_1 = Performs a clapping motion dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} to nearby players, then fires a laser beam in front of it at a fixed angle which deals '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. The core in its head is exposed for as long as it fires the beam.
|strat_1 = The clap can be dodged by moving to the side, while the laser beam can be dodged by remaining in close range.

|name_2 = Stomp
|desc_2 = Stomps one of their feet, dealing '''40% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} to close by players. This is then followed up with a shockwave from the same foot, dealing '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} in a larger area. The cores in both feet are briefly exposed before the follow-up shockwave attack.

|name_3 = Spin
|desc_3 = Spins the upper half of its body and marches towards the player, rapidly dealing '''60% ATK''' as  {{Color|Physical DMG}} over a period of time. The cores in both feet are briefly exposed right before and after the attack.

|name_4 = Charge
|desc_4 = If the player stays too far, the Ruin Grader will charge in one direction towards the player, dealing '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on hit. At the end of the charge, performs a shoulder ram to deal '''40% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} in a slightly larger AoE. This briefly exposes the cores in both feet right before and after the attack.

|name_5 = Focused Laser
|desc_5 = Fires a laser beam directly at the current character, rapidly dealing '''40% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. It will adjust the firing angle if its current target moves and will preemptively cancel the attack if the target is outside of its firing arc. The core in its head is exposed before the attack and for as long as if fires the beam. Additionally, it may perform this attack if the cores both feet are disabled, but not the core in its head.
|strat_5 = The focused laser beam is unable to be aimed in melee range. Moving close to the Ruin Grader will effectively end this attack.

|name_6 = Ruin Mines
|desc_6 = Fires three orbs which will try to land in a triangle formation around the player. These orbs stay on the ground for about 9 seconds and deal '''16% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}} on contact. This exposes the core in its head for the duration of this attack.
|file_6 = Ruin Grader Orb Attack

|name_7 = Brush-Off
|desc_7 = Extends both arms out toward the ground and energizes its laser beam, quickly spinning and firing its beam in a moderate AoE around itself, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Physical DMG}}. This attack is only performed after all cores are recovered after being disabled simultaneously.
|file_7 = Ruin Grader Brush-Off Attack

|name_8 = Paralyzed
|desc_8 = When performing certain attacks, some of its weak points will be exposed at its legs or its eye. Attacking exposed weak points will interrupt the Ruin Grader's current attack. Successfully damaging a weak point twice will temporarily disable that weak point for around 20 seconds, after which it will become operational again. Additionally, the Ruin Grader cannot perform certain attacks if the associated weak point it exposes for those attacks are down. If both weak points are disabled, the Ruin Grader will enter a fully-disabled state.
|file_8 = Ruin Grader Stunned
}}

===AI Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range and angle required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|An ancient humanoid war machine.<br>Their form is similar to that of [[Ruin Guard]]s, but is more distorted and more powerful. Energy cores have been installed in both its legs, as though to power its overly heavy form.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* Ruin Graders sometimes go by titles like Ra-41816, beginning with the prefix Ra and ending in a numeric code. This is demonstrated in certain boss fights like the ones around [[Starglow Cavern]].
** Possible titles include Ra-11235, Ra-25844, Ra-33377, Ra-34558, Ra-36875, Ra-41816, Ra-61098, Ra-65746, Ra-71128, Ra-71597, Ra-76510, Ra-81321, Ra-91142, and Ra-94617.
*The Ruin Grader in Dragonspine and Araumi look out towards each other when dormant.
* Prior to the release of [[The Chasm/Underground Mines|the Chasm]], respawnable Ruin Graders were always found in a dormant state. Unlike other Ruin machines, the grader can be attacked during its waking animation.
