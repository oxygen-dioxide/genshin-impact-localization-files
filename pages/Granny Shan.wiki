:;(Opens the shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} About the toys...
::'''Granny Shan:''' Oh, children love them. Intricate things, they are.
::'''Granny Shan:''' I've got toys for adults too, if you'd like.
::{{DIcon}} Adult toys...?
:::'''Granny Shan:''' Sorry, I should have been more specific. Some toys need adult supervision &mdash; kites for example.
:::'''Granny Shan:''' Come war and famine or the peace and prosperity we know today, happiness is always something worth striving for, don't you think?
:{{DIcon}} So, about Rex Lapis...
::'''Granny Shan:''' Rex Lapis? I understand. Does your little one back home also want a Rex Lapis-themed toy?
::'''Granny Shan:''' Have a look: dragon horn tops, stone dice, a dragon-shaped wooden sword, a kite with Rex Lapis' portrait on it... which would you like?
::'''Granny Shan:''' Ah... So you're just asking around. I see. Rex Lapis-themed toys are so very popular among the children, so I naturally thought that...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Granny Shan:''' Goodbye! Take care now.

::'''Granny Shan:''' Ah, so you're here to buy one, are you?
::'''Granny Shan:''' There's lots of new designs for this year's Lantern Rite, and some of them have come equipped with devices that will let them fly more easily...
::'''Granny Shan:''' As for me, I just have some traditional patterns, and all these newfangled items do rather confuse me. If you want to buy them, you might want to drop by [[Zhenyuan]]'s stall.
::'''Granny Shan:''' She's my niece, and she came to Liyue Harbor from [[Chenyu Vale]] this year to do business. Young people are full of energy, but they can be prone to mistakes, so please do take care of her.
