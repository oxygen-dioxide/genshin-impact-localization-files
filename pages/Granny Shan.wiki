==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Granny Shan:''' Smiling makes the world a more beautiful place! See any toys you like?
:{{DIcon|Special Souvenir}} What do you have to sell here?
::'''Granny Shan:''' What you see is what I've got. Have a look, perhaps there might be something that catches your eye.
:;(Opens the shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} About the toys...
::'''Granny Shan:''' Oh, children love them. Intricate things, they are.
::'''Granny Shan:''' I've got toys for adults too, if you'd like.
::{{DIcon}} Adult toys...?
::'''Granny Shan:''' Sorry, I should have been more specific. Some toys need adult supervision &mdash; kites for example.
::'''Granny Shan:''' Come war and famine or the peace and prosperity we know today, happiness is always something worth striving for, don't you think?
:{{DIcon}} So, about Rex Lapis...
::'''Granny Shan:''' Rex Lapis? I understand. Does your little one back home also want a Rex Lapis-themed toy?
::'''Granny Shan:''' Have a look: dragon horn tops, stone dice, a dragon-shaped wooden sword, a kite with Rex Lapis' portrait on it... which would you like?
::'''Granny Shan:''' Ah... So you're just asking around. I see. Rex Lapis-themed toys are so very popular among the children, so I naturally thought that...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Granny Shan:''' Goodbye! Take care now.
