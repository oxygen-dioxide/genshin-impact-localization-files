==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Yi'nian:''' Ah, a customer! What can I get for you? How about some Lantern Rite specialties? We only make them once a year!
:{{DIcon|Shop}} I'd like to buy a snack.
::'''Yi'nian:''' Certainly! Take a look and decide for yourself. I can do anything on the menu. Or if there's something in particular you're after, I can do that instead!
:;(Opens Shop menu)
:{{DIcon}} How's business these days?
::'''Yi'nian:''' Haha, business is better than ever. Thanks for asking.
::'''Yi'nian:''' But if you ask me, making good food is what really counts. Perfecting tasty snacks is time well spent, rather than thinking all day about how to make more advertisements.
::'''Yi'nian:''' If it's good, it'll sell itself. At least, that's what I think. I don't need any boring advice from [[Wang'ya]].
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Yi'nian:''' Take care. Please come again!
