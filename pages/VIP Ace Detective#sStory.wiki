:Yesterday, there was a burglary at the [[Lepaute Horlogerie]]. A large number of clockwork parts have gone missing, and the owner wishes to recover them as soon as possible.
:'''[[Furina]]:''' This internationally renowned Ace Detective is here to get to the bottom of things!
----
:'''[[Caron]]:''' With your help, I'm sure the parts will be recovered soon!
:'''Furina:''' The clues are bound to lead us to the culprit. I already have an inkling!
:'''Furina:''' Ah... Oh dear, I forgot where the clues are being kept... Where's a trusty assistant when you need one!?
:;([[Veta]] runs past and Furina notices a clue)

;(Take a picture and record the clue)
:'''Box of Parts and Finished Pocket Watch:''' Only one kind of clockwork part was stolen. The other parts were left untouched, as was the highly valuable finished pocket watch by the side.
:;(Veta runs past and Furina notices another clue)
:'''Furina:''' Hmm?

;(Take a picture and record the clue)
:'''Strange Scratches on the Counter:''' Strangely-shaped scratches were found on the counter of the Horlogerie. It was made recently.
:'''Furina:''' I've just about finished checking the crime scene. Did any of you notice anything suspicious lately?
:'''Caron:''' Now that you mention it... Yesterday, a traveler from a distant land inquired about the prices of various different best-selling models of pocket watches, but left without buying anything.
:'''Veta:''' After she had left, she went over to [[Chioriya Boutique]]. Lady Furina, perhaps you might want to go over there and take a look?
----
:'''Furina:''' Hello, shop assistant. You didn't happen to notice a strange traveler from afar hanging around yesterday, did you?
:'''[[Eloffe]]:''' Let me think... I do remember seeing a foreign traveler here yesterday, but there wasn't anything strange about her.
:'''Furina:''' Well, looks like we'll have to look for clues again... It seems patience is a necessary virtue, for a detective at least.
:;(Furina takes out a slice of cake)
:'''Furina:''' Delicious! A good slice of cake always takes a performance to the next level!

;(Take a picture and record the clue)
:'''Missing Buttons:''' Exquisite buttons were ripped off an item of clothing at some point. There's also some mud on the clothes.
:'''Furina:''' Hmm?
:;(Furina notices two dogs sniffing at a sewer lid)

;(Take a picture and record the clue)
:'''Some Missing Items Found Below the Lid of a Well:''' Someone broke into the sewer... In there are stolen clockwork parts, the clothing buttons, and... a wild [[Bulle Fruit]]?
:'''Furina:''' My dear [[Melusine]] officer, have you seen any odd traveler from abroad skulking around recently?
:'''[[Menthe]]:''' Uh... I haven't seen anyone like that while I've been on patrol.
:'''Menthe:''' But I did hear someone mention in passing that they'd noticed an extra tent that's appeared on the beach outside of the [[Court of Fontaine]] recently. It looks like it might belong to the [[Treasure Hoarders]].
----
:'''Furina:''' Seems like this is where the Treasure Hoarders put up their tent. But where have they all gone?
:'''Furina:''' The sun's unbearable today... But I suppose this is all inevitable for a star performer.

;(Take a picture and record the clue)
:'''Treasure Hoarders' Camp:''' The tent is empty and inhabited by some sea creatures. It looks like the Treasure Hoarders are long gone.
:'''Furina:''' Hmm?
:;(Furina notices some holes and three [[Weasel Thief|Weasel Thieves]] pop out)

;(Take a picture and record the clue)
:'''Alert Weasel Thieves:''' Three Weasel Thieves stick their heads out to look around cautiously. One of them has a hole on its backpack and a Bulle Fruit that looks somewhat familiar.
:'''Furina:''' I've just about found all the clues now. I already know what I think happened... Time to wrap this case up! Director! Let's head to the next scene!
----
:What is the suspect's true identity?
:{{DIcon}} Foreign traveler
::A foreign traveler should be more interested in the pocket watch. Stealing low-value components would be of no interest to her.
:;(Return to choices)
:{{DIcon}} Treasure Hoarder
::According to the investigation into the Treasure Hoarders' camp, they had already left long ago.
:;(Return to choices)
:{{DIcon}} "Someone" else
::Exactly. It's this Weasel Thief!

;(Drag and drop the corresponding clue image to answer the questions)
:'''Caron:''' How can we be sure that it really found its way into my shop?
;(Select an incorrect image)
::'''Furina:''' ...Haha! I'm eliminating the wrong answers!
;(Select Scratches)
::The Weasel Thief left these scratches when it scampered up onto the counter with the box of clockwork parts.
::'''Furina:''' Yup! That's exactly it!

:'''Menthe:''' I was close by the whole time. How did it evade me?
;(Select an incorrect image)
::'''Furina:''' ...Haha! I'm eliminating the wrong answers!
;(Select Sewer Lid)
::After stealing the items, it escaped from the Court of Fontaine through the sewers.
::'''Furina:''' Yup! That's exactly it!

:'''Veta:''' There were three Weasel Thieves on the beach. Lady Furina, how are you so sure that it's this one?
;(Select an incorrect image)
::'''Furina:''' ...Haha! I'm eliminating the wrong answers!
;(Select Weasel Thieves)
::If you look closely, you'll realize that the stolen clockwork parts, buttons, and Bulle Fruit found in the sewers all fell out from that hole on its backpack.
::'''Furina:''' Yup! That's exactly it!

:'''Eloffe:''' But why did it steal the clockwork parts and buttons?
;(Select an incorrect image)
::'''Furina:''' ...Haha! I'm eliminating the wrong answers!
;(Select Missing Buttons)
::The shape and color of the clockwork parts and buttons resemble those of [[Mora]]. The Weasel Thief mistook them for Mora!
::'''Furina:''' Yup! That's exactly it!
----
:'''Furina:''' "Hehe, no matter how complicated the case is, the truth never escapes me!" Cut!
:'''Furina:''' Ah, the filming is finally over. Thank you everyone for your great work!
:This detective drama starring Lady Furina has wrapped up spectacularly! Our sincere thanks to Lepaute Horlogerie and Chioriya Boutique for their support during filming.
