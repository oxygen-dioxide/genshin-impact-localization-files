|text    = Frankly speaking, I don't want to celebrate a birthday, and I have no interest in the socializing that accompanies it "in the traditional sense." Therefore, few people know of this day.

If you only regard this day as a slightly special day, to get a drink and have a meal with someone you haven't seen for a long time... I think I can still accept it.

Here are some flowers. [[Flora|Lora]], or what's her name from the flower shop said this flower is the best-seller lately.

...At least it looks interesting, and it can spin.

Beautiful things can give people a different mood. It doesn't match me, but if it's in your hands, I guess it will be different.

Anyway, come see me again at dawn.
