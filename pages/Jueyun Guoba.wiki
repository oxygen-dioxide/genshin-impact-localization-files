|desc_suspicious = The browned Jueyun Chilis and ham stick together on top of a crust that has barely retained its flavor, and you can only tell them apart by the mouthfeel.
|desc_basic      = Stir-fried ham and Jueyun Chili sprinkled on a crispy crust made from Rice and Horsetail create a refined, meaty snack that transforms humble Rice into a hot delicacy.
|desc_delicious  = Chow down on that lovely, fragrant crust and the steaming ham sitting atop it. The spices and spiciness race neck and neck into your nostrils, creating an addictive flavor that has you licking that last finger rather than let a single scrap go to waste.
