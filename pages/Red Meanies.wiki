'''Red Meanies and Mini Meanies''' are an underwater exploration mechanic in [[Fontaine]] currently found in the [[Liffey Region]] and [[Fontaine Research Institute of Kinetic Energy Engineering Region]].

These meanies must be destroyed with a [[Xenochromatic Creature]]'s ability. When there are multiple of them, all of them must be destroyed within a short time, otherwise they will respawn. If the player gets too close to them, the meanies will pulse, dealing small amounts of '''Physical DMG''' to the player.{{Verify|how much damage?}}
