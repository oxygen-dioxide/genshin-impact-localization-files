'''Dunyarzad Homayani''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that first appears in the [[Archon Quest]], [[Chapter III]], [[Through Mists of Smoke and Forests Dark|Act I]], Part 5: [[The Trail of the God of Wisdom]].

==Profile==
Dunyarzad is the daughter of the [[Homayani Family|Homayani family]], and a self-proclaimed follower of [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]]. This is in part due to being visited by the Archon in her dreams as a child, when she was bedridden from [[Eleazar]]. The Homayanis hired members of the [[Corps of Thirty]], a group of [[The Eremites|Eremites]] that also protect [[Sumeru City]], to serve as her bodyguards.

The [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] first visit Dunyarzad while looking for a way to meet Kusanali and helped her hide from some of her family's bodyguards, as they had been tasked with finding her when she snuck out of her home. [[Dehya]] soon found them, but Dunyarzad managed to convince her to stand down and assist her instead through her determination. She was quite eager to celebrate the dying [[Sabzeruz Festival]] and donated a large amount of [[Mora]] to revive it.

However, the [[Sumeru Akademiya]], disapproving of all ties to Kusanali, stopped the festival and implemented a samsara to harvest the dreams of everyone in Sumeru City for reasons unknown. During this time, Dunyarzad's consciousness was unable to withstand the Akasha harvesting, causing her to "die." However, the Traveler and Paimon soon discovered with [[Nahida]] (Kusanali's vessel) that they could break the samsara by forcing the host to realize they were dreaming &mdash; in this case, they discovered it was [[Nilou]]. Nahida, who had left the city during the cycle, was able to find the fading fragment of Dunyarzad's consciousness and managed to sustain it long enough that she recovered in the real world, albeit with no memory of what had happened during the samsara other than Nilou's dance.

===Personality===
Unlike many of Sumeru's people, Dunyarzad is a follower of Kusanali, as she thanks her for letting her know about the outside world due to her assistance. She does not like her parents as they find her too controlling, even though they try to help her handle her Eleazar condition. Even then, she lives life to the fullest, trying to live each day without regrets knowing that she could die soon due to her medical condition. She gets along well with Dehya, who serves as her personal bodyguard.

===Appearance===
Dunyarzad has a light blue dress and a purple top with gold accents. She has brown eyes and brunette hair that she wears in a braided low bun. She has a gold lazurite crown, a gold lazurite necklace and gold earrings. She also has bandages around her arms and brown leather slippers.

During ''[[A Toast to Victory]]'', her bandages are removed due to being completely cured of Eleazar.
