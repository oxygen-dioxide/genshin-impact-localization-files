'''Dunyarzad Homayani''' is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that first appears in the {{Quest|The Trail of the God of Wisdom}}.

==Profile==
Dunyarzad is the daughter of the [[Homayani Family|Homayani family]], and a self-proclaimed follower of [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]]. This is in part due to being visited by the Archon in her dreams as a child, when she was bedridden from [[Eleazar]]. The Homayanis hired members of the [[Corps of Thirty]], a group of [[The Eremites|Eremites]] that also protect [[Sumeru City]], to serve as her bodyguards.

In her youth, Dunyarzad and her family had went to the desert for business but were ambushed by a group of Eremites. They were nearly killed until a group led by [[Kusayla]] rescued them, in part due to him seeing her similarly to Dehya. Before he left to burn the archives of Dakan Al-Ahmar, Kusayla convinced her father to hire Dehya to serve as her bodyguard. As a young woman, her Eleazar had advanced to the terminal stage, and she used bandage wrappings to cover the scaling that had developed on her palms and wrists.

The [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] first visit Dunyarzad while looking for a way to meet Kusanali and helped her hide from some of her family's bodyguards, as they had been tasked with finding her when she snuck out of her home. Dehya soon found them, but Dunyarzad managed to convince her to stand down and assist her instead through her determination. She was quite eager to celebrate the dying [[Sabzeruz Festival]] and donated a large amount of [[Mora]] to revive it.

However, the [[Sumeru Akademiya]], disapproving of all ties to Kusanali, stopped the festival and implemented a samsara to harvest the dreams of everyone in Sumeru City wearing an [[Akasha Terminal]] for their own malicious intent. During this time, Dunyarzad's consciousness, with her physical health already compromised, was unable to withstand the Akasha harvesting, causing her to "die." However, the Traveler and Paimon soon discovered with [[Nahida]] (Kusanali's vessel) that they could break the samsara by forcing the host to realize they were dreaming &mdash; in this case, they discovered it was [[Nilou]]. Nahida, who had left the city during the cycle, was able to find the fading fragment of Dunyarzad's consciousness and managed to sustain it long enough that she recovered in the real world, albeit with no memory of what had happened during the samsara other than Nilou's dance.

Upon learning the truth of the incident, the Traveler and their allies freed Kusanali from the sages and stopped their plot of ascending [[Scaramouche]] into a new god. During this time, Nahida also discovered the remnants of [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] in [[Irminsul]] which was responsible for tainting it and removed it. Rukkhadevata's removal from Irminsul resulted in the forbidden knowledge being removed, which in turn removed Eleazar and cured Dunyarzad of her affliction. She later attended the victory feast with Dehya.

===Appearance===
Dunyarzad has a light blue dress and a purple top with gold accents. She has brown eyes and brunette hair that she wears in a braided low bun. She has a gold lazurite crown, a gold lazurite necklace and gold earrings. She also has bandages around her arms and brown leather sandals.

During ''[[A Toast to Victory]]'', her bandages are removed due to being completely cured of Eleazar.
