==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After leaving the [[Ruins of the Sage of the Stolen Flame]])
:'''Paimon:''' Oh yeah, remember to show Manqu the token you got. He should still be waiting for us over at the entrance to the ruins...

;(Talk to Manqu)
:'''Paimon:''' Manqu, we're back!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
:'''Manqu:''' Phew, that sure was one long wait. Not gonna lie, the longer I waited, the more anxious I became.
:'''Manqu:''' It was my idea in the first place, true, but if you went into the ruins only to never return, I'd be beside myself with guilt...
:'''Manqu:''' Though, if you'll excuse my bluntness, I must ask &mdash; surely you've found the token that the [[Sage of the Stolen Flame]] left within the ruins?
:{{DIcon}} That was pretty tough...
:{{DIcon}} Tough as a piece of cake.
:'''Manqu:''' Hah, I knew you'd do it!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
;(If only one Golden Entreaty has been collected)
::'''Paimon:''' Look, it turned out to be this disc thingamajig!
:::'''Golden Entreaty'''
:::[[File:Item Golden Entreaty.png|80px]]
::'''Manqu:''' No, surely not... a Golden Entreaty!? G&mdash;Golden Entreaties actually exist? Incredible! I must include this in my research.
::'''Paimon:''' So this thing's called a Golden Entreaty, huh...
::'''Manqu:''' Th&mdash;That's right. Apologies, I'm just so excited. It's said that this was once handled by the Sage of the Stolen Flame himself...
::'''Manqu:''' For a moment there, I was thinking about what it might be like to keep it for myself as some kind of family heirloom...
::'''Paimon:''' No way! We need it to save {{Little One}}!
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
::'''Manqu:''' I know... But as for clues about the tokens' whereabouts, well, I'm all out. I haven't the slightest idea where the other one might be.
::{{DIcon}} [[Ochkanatlan]]...
::'''Manqu:''' Huh? Forgive my asking, {{Traveler}}, but did I just hear you say "Ochkanatlan"...?
::{{DIcon}} (Explain that you saw it when you touched the stone tablet...)
::'''Manqu:''' Wow, who'd have thought it'd be in Ochkanatlan... The ruins of an ancient city that lies across a narrow stretch of water, north of the [[Flower-Feather Clan]]...
::'''Manqu:''' If that's where it is, then I am truly sorry, but I cannot help you. Not only does [[Children of Echoes|my tribe]] forbid me to go there, but so does the [[Saurian Relics Association]]...
::'''Manqu:''' Apparently, it is said that many years ago, some Association members received a commission to investigate that place, but after setting out, they vanished without a trace.
::'''Manqu:''' Since then, the Association has steered well clear of anything to do with Ochkanatlan.
::'''Paimon:''' Don't sweat it. You've already told us plenty!
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
::'''Manqu:''' Well, I must thank the two of you once again. I can't tell you how much seeing a Golden Entreaty means to me. Speaking of which, I'd better hurry back and get all this recorded...
;(If both Golden Entreaties have been collected)
::'''Paimon:''' Look, they turned out to be these disk thingamajigs! We've already gotten our hands on both of the tokens!
:::'''Golden Entreaty'''
:::[[File:Item Golden Entreaty.png|80px]]
::'''Manqu:''' No, surely not... two Golden Entreaties!? G&mdash;Golden Entreaties actually exist? Incredible! I must include this in my research.
::'''Paimon:''' So these things are called Golden Entreaties, huh...
::'''Manqu:''' Th&mdash;That's right. Apologies, I'm just so excited. It is said that they were once handled by the legendary Sage of the Stolen Flame, and even the first Pyro Archon...
::'''Manqu:''' For a moment there, I was thinking about what it might be like to keep them for myself as family heirlooms or something of the sort...
::'''Paimon:''' No way! We need them to save {{Little One}}!
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
::'''Manqu:''' I know, I know... Well, I suppose now you must set forth for the [[Great Volcano of Tollan]].
::'''Manqu:''' Legend has it that long ago, before [[Xbalanque]] became the [[Pyro Archon]], it was there that he fought against the [[Flamelord]] who wielded the powers of blinding light and searing heat...
::'''Manqu:''' When the dust had finally settled, the triumphant hero Xbalanque returned alive to become the first Pyro Archon.
::'''Manqu:''' But as for what lies within the volcano, no one knows for sure. Some believe that an ancient dragon still resides there, deep in hibernation &mdash; yet others say it is but a husk, all inside having been incinerated by Xbalanque's flames.
::'''Manqu:''' If you ask me though, these are nothing but storytellers' speculations...
::'''Manqu:''' I'd love to go with you, but I'm afraid that would be asking a bit too much of this poor old body of mine...
::'''Paimon:''' Don't sweat it. You've already told us plenty!
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!
::'''Manqu:''' Well, I must thank the two of you once again. I can't tell you how much seeing those Golden Entreaties means to me. Speaking of which, I'd better hurry back and get all this recorded...
:'''Manqu:''' Thank you once more, {{Traveler}} and Paimon. I wish you a safe journey...
:'''Manqu:''' And {{Little One}}, I wish you success removing the mark of the Flamelord's Blessing.
:{{DIcon}} Farewell!
:'''Manqu:''' Yes... At the journey's end, the place where all souls come to rest, we will meet again &mdash; I am sure of it!
