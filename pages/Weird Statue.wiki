{{Quote|"The land is not to be tilled with farming tools, but rather to be fought for with steel and blood." &mdash;This is how the "Field Tiller" came about.|[[Dainsleif]], [[A Herald Without Adherents]]}}

"Field Tiller" was a codename given by the people of [[Khaenri'ah]] to the war machines now known as Ruin Guards.

The first Field Tiller was a prototype that was far stronger than a normal Ruin Guard, despite sharing a similar appearance to them. At some point,<ref group="Note">It is unclear whether the first Field Tiller came to Mondstadt before or after the cataclysm. Barbara's story only vaguely frames the story between Decarabian's death and before the present day, and Andrius' account of his fight against the Field Tiller places it after he moved to Wolvendom — except there is no timeframe for that either. Note that Guizhong, who lived far before Decarabian fell, had access to Ruin Guards and Ruin Hunters; in addition, Ruin Guards accompanied the Khaenri'ah delegation to Enkanomiya. Since Ruin Guards have existed for such a long time, it is possible that the first Field Tiller wandered into Mondstadt before the cataclysm and not after it, like most other Ruin Guards.</ref> this Field Tiller left Khaenri'ah and mindlessly roamed around Teyvat like most Ruin Guards did after the cataclysm, eventually arriving at [[Wolvendom]]. [[Andrius]] encountered the Field Tiller; mistaking it as a challenger, he fought the Field Tiller in battle, and after Andrius had dealt enough damage to it, it subsequently fled to the ruins of Old Mondstadt.

Severely damaged, it eventually became immobile but still active. Believing to have sensed danger, it launched missiles at anyone that it detected was attempting to enter Old Mondstadt to drive them off. The people of Mondstadt, who had little knowledge of the Ruin Machines, believed it to be a final act of fury from the deceased Anemo Archon [[Decarabian]] and called the phenomenon the "Tyrant's Final Fury". This lasted for around a year before the Field Tiller shut down.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Dishonorable Trial}}</ref>

{{Quote|All of the Ruin Guards today are just replicas of this machine. As the prototype, its combat capability was unrestricted.|Dainsleif, [[A Soul Set Apart]]}}
The [[Abyss Order]] had a plan to place the eye of the first Field Tiller into the [[Defiled Statue]] and attach [[Osial]]'s limbs to it to create a mechanized god. When the [[Traveler]] tries to use [[Elemental Sight]] to extract the eye of the first Field Tiller, it does not work. Dainsleif explains that is because the Field Tiller is not powered by [[element]]al energy. Dainsleif then uses his own power to extract the eye and vows to protect it himself to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Soul Set Apart}}</ref>
