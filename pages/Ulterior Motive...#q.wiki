;(Defeat the Treasure Hoarder)

;(Talking with Barbara)
:{{A|vo bblcop001 1900701 barbara 01.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} That's the last we'll see of him! Whatever he was planning, he won't try it now...
:{{A|vo bblcop001 1900701 barbara 02.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Thank you...
:{{DIcon}} You don't sound too happy about it...
:{{A|vo bblcop001 1900701 barbara 03.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' I had a look at his wounds... I think he really did need healing.
:{{A|vo bblcop001 1900701 barbara 04.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Even if he was a Treasure Hoarder...
:{{A|vo bblcop001 1900701 barbara 05.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Still, I'm sure you made the right decision. If he did have some ulterior motive, we might have fallen into a trap.
:{{A|vo bblcop001 1900701 barbara 06.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' Whatever the case, if he does have others lurking about, we're probably still in danger. We should go back to Mondstadt.
:{{A|vo bblcop001 1900701 barbara 07.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' *sigh* It looks like Chilibrew isn't in the cards this time. I'll have to get around to making one for you next time.
:{{A|vo bblcop001 1900701 barbara 08.ogg}} '''Barbara:''' I'm... heading back to Mondstadt. You should come as well &mdash; don't spend too long out here.
