==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|You rescue a woman named [[Fujiwara Toshiko]] on [[Seirai Island]]. She seems to be searching for a family heirloom here...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Paimon''': Someone's been surrounded by monsters over there! C'mon, Traveler, we gotta go help them!

;(Defeat the 3 Hilichurls and talk to Fujiwara Toshiko)
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko''': Th&mdash;Thank you... Phew, to think that these guys would try to catch me unawares like that...
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing here?
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' I'm Fujiwara Toshiko, and I'm here to... Um...
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Never mind. Since you did save me, I might as well tell you.
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' I'm actually here to find treasure that my ancestors left behind here!
:'''Paimon''': T&mdash;Treasure...!
:{{DIcon}} And have you found it?
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko''' Hahaha, of course I have, I've followed some clues to the treasure's location, and I've ascertained my method of entry.
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko''' But just as I was about to activate the switch and enter the area where the treasure is stored, those monsters sneaked up and attacked me.
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' I owe you my life for chasing those monsters away. Thank you.
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Um, so, could I...
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Could I ask you to protect me for a while longer?
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' I still have to find that treasure, but I don't think I'll be able to handle all these monsters alone...
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' I'll... I'll even share some of the treasure with you!
:{{DIcon}} Is there really treasure here?
:{{DIcon}} Can you really find it?
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' I'm sure I can find that treasure! Just trust me!
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' I've even found the switch that'll allow us to enter the place where the treasure is hidden. It's just over there.
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' That said, the mechanism doesn't seem to be something we can open directly. It requires some special method to activate...
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' I have a map left by my ancestors here with me, and it contains clues as to how I might figure this mechanism out...
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' But... Heh, I still haven't figured it out yet.
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Here, why don't you have a look as well? For all I know, you might be able to figure something out.
::(Displays [[Fujiwara Toshiko's Treasure Map]])
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' *sigh* But really, how am I supposed to solve this puzzle...
;(Talk to her again)
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' How am I supposed to solve this puzzle...

;(Activate the mechanism successfully)
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Wh&mdash;What was that noise...
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Did you just see that? A giant... hole just opened up over there!
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Looks like there's... some sort of basement here! Let's go in and have a look, come on!

;(Enter the basement)
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' This mechanism seems to be of the same kind as the one that we unlocked on the way in.
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Just, you know... more complicated....
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' But it's fine, right? I'm sure the ancestral map I've got has some clues for us!
;(Talk to her again)
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' How am I supposed to solve this puzzle...

;(Activate the mechanism successfully once)
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Yes! We've got it!
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' H&mdash;Huh? Why... did the mechanism change again?
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Are we going to have to solve it again...

;(Activate the mechanism successfully twice)
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' It activated! There's the treasure, too!<!--Dialogue appears right after the puzzle completed -->
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Great. Finally, no more mechanism to solve...
;(After Fujiwara Toshiko opens the chest, talk to her)
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Why's there only this inside...
:{{DIcon}} What happened?
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Other than this picture, there's nothing in this chest.
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Is this the treasure? That's so odd.
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' *sigh* I don't think we can split this, can we...
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Well, how about this, then? Let's head back to my camp first.
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' I'll provide you with the payment once we get back there.
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Right, then. Let's go.
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Only one picture? How strange...
;(On the way to camp)
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' The camp's not far now, we'll reach it in just a moment.

;(Follow Fujiwara Toshiko)
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Eh? What is it this time...
:'''Treasure Hoarder:''' Struck it rich, did you?
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Y&mdash;You...
:'''Treasure Hoarder:''' Hehe. Come on now, cut it with the nonsense. Give it up, or else! We're not leaving empty-handed...
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' What? Wait a moment! All I found was this picture!
:'''Treasure Hoarder:''' A picture? Well, we'll take that too! Come on lads, get {{not a typo|'er}}!
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' H&mdash;Help me, Traveler, please!

;(Defeat the Treasure Hoarders)
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Just when did we catch the eye of those Treasure Hoarders...
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Thank you, Traveler, let's head back to camp.

;(Follow a bit further)
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Wh&mdash;What is going on...
:'''Masterless Samurai:''' Please halt.
:'''Masterless Samurai:''' Could we bother you to leave the treasure you found with us?
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' What...
:'''Masterless Samurai:''' Did you not just fight those Treasure Hoarders off to protect the treasure you found?
:'''Masterless Samurai:''' It stands to reason, then, that it must be something very valuable.
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' I thought I said that it was just one picture!
:'''Masterless Samurai:''' It seems we are at an impasse, then. But we shall not be denied, not after following those Treasure Hoarders for all this time. Attack!
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' H&mdash;Hey, listen to me, will you!? Traveler! Help!

;(Defeat the Nobushi)
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' These people aren't listening to me at all! I said it already, we only found one picture!
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Let's go. We need to get back to my campsite...

;(Follow a bit further)
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Ohh, what now!?
:'''Fatui:''' Hand that picture over.
:'''Paimon:''' The Fatui!? Wh&mdash;What are they doing here!?
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' It's just your ordinary, normal, run-of-the-mill picture! If you want it, just take it, alright?
:'''Fatui:''' Is there anything else? Hand those over too!
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Anything else? There's nothing else! I really only found this one picture!
:'''Fatui:''' Hmph! Why would one crummy picture be hidden by so many complex mechanisms?
:'''Fatui:''' If we hadn't trailed those samurai, we wouldn't have found this basement at all.
:'''Fatui:''' We're not leaving empty-handed after so much waiting. Get them!
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' I... I really... Traveler, please, help me!

;(Defeat the Fatui)
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Wh&mdash;Why doesn't anyone believe that this picture is all I found? I mean...
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' You've got to at least let your victim tell you what they've got while you're robbing them, right?
:{{DIcon}} Let's just go...
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' *whimpers* A&mdash;Alright... Let's just get back to camp. I've had enough of this...

;(Follow a bit further)
:'''???:''' Meow!
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Agh! Wh&mdash;Who is it this time! Please, I just found this one picture, that's all I found, honest!
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'll never go looking for treasure ever again!
:{{DIcon}} It's just a cat...
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Eh? Is it? Oh...

;(Reach the camp and talk to Fujiwara Toshiko)
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Phew, we're back at last. Hold on for a moment while I get your payment ready.
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko prepares your reward...'''
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' That should do it. This isn't much, but please accept it.
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' This treasure hunt sure turned out to be a mess &mdash; and all that for a single picture.
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Why would my ancestors set up so many mechanisms just to protect one picture?
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' I don't get it at all. Maybe I should bring this picture back to [[Inazuma City]] and ask around a bit...
:'''Fujiwara Toshiko:''' Hmm, maybe I should go ask Mr. [[Oda Tarou]]...
