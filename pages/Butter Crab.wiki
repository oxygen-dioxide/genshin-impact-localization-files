|desc_suspicious = A grilled crab dish. The crab legs are still cold, and have a raw, salty flavor to them, almost as if one were being force-fed some seawater.
|desc_basic      = A grilled crab dish. Appropriate heat control has allowed the crab meat to stay moist and fatty. The butter has seeped into the crab meat, producing an aroma that has people salivating even from afar.
|desc_delicious  = A grilled crab dish. The butter-infused crab legs have a rich aroma that washes over the taste buds so seductively that before you know it, you've eaten it all, and are left sipping at the dregs of butter in the crab's shell, hoping to recapture a fragment of the dish's beauty.
