'''Valaya'''<ref>Tutorial: [[Tutorial/Rhythm of the Sprout|Rhythm of the Sprout]]</ref> are an exploration mechanic found in [[Sumeru]]. When hit by a [[Dendrogranum]]'s coordinated attack, Valaya will become activated.

Valaya appear in groups or spawn more Valaya when activated. When a group of Valaya is successfully activated, the player will be rewarded a [[Chest]]. Certain groups of Valaya need to be activated in a specific order or only partly activated. Environmental clues can be found near such Valaya.

Certain special Valaya require a [[Healthy Dendrogranum]] to activate.
