{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the stage)
:'''Mamull:''' Come, take a look, see for yourself! It's only the hottest, most thrilling new thing... the "Painted Stone Challenge"!
:'''Mamull:''' Aiyaya, my friends, this opportunity won't come knocking twice! If you snooze, you'll lose!

;(Approach Mamull)
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Mamull:''' Come and See

;(Talk to the Exhausted Iktomisaurus while [[Saurian Indwelling|indwelling]], optional)
:'''Exhausted Iktomisaurus:''' Be careful... This fellow's a cunning one... *sigh*

;(Talk to the Trapped Iktomisaur Chick while indwelling, optional)
:'''Trapped Iktomisaur Chick:''' Ohh... When can I get out of here...
:'''Trapped Iktomisaur Chick:''' That person's a big liar, *sob*...

;(Talk to Mamull)
:'''Mamull:''' Oh-ho, a foreign guest!
:'''Mamull:''' I guess arriving at the right time is better than being early. I just set this stall up today, and here you are.
:'''Mamull:''' What fantastic luck, hehe!
:{{DIcon}} You do have pretty good luck.
:'''Mamull:''' Oh, no, no, dear guest. I'm not talking about my luck, but yours!
:'''Paimon:''' Our luck?
:'''Mamull:''' Indeed! Not everyone gets the chance to take the most ancient trial on the Hued-Jade Heights &mdash; the Painted Stone Challenge!
:'''Mamull:''' This is a trial left behind by the legendary hero of the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]], um... Vallejodaken, designed to train the memory of our tribespeople and their ability to perceive color.
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, was there ever such a hero from the Masters of the Night-Wind...?
:'''Mamull:''' Why, the tribe has a long and profound history. How could you outsiders hope to know all of it, eh?
:{{DIcon}} But you're not from the Masters of the Night-Wind, are you?
:'''Mamull:''' ...W&mdash;Well now! What does a legendary hero's trial have to do with which tribe I'm from? The six major tribes were established so long ago, surely it is high time the barriers between them went down... *ahem*.
:'''Mamull:''' Anyway, lucky travelers from afar &mdash; why don't you listen in on the rules of the Painted Stone Challenge? To be honest, the rewards I prepared are so generous it gives me conniptions!
:'''Paimon:''' R&mdash;Really?
:'''Paimon:''' It still sounds fishy, but there's no harm in listening... What do you think, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} You'll hear it no matter what I say...
::'''Paimon:''' C'mon, a good adventurer should never pass up a chance for extra rewards!
:{{DIcon}} Well, let's see what you call "lucky" around here, then...
::'''Paimon:''' Teehee, that word always fills Paimon with excitement!
:'''Mamull:''' Then allow me, the heir of the hero Vallekan, to explain the rules to you...
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, did that name just change, or...
:'''Mamull:''' Change? No, no, it was always the same name. *sigh* You foreigners just have trouble remembering the mighty names of our ancient heroes &mdash; but that's okay. Anyway, here's how the rules work...
:'''Mamull:''' When the challenge begins, the Iktomisaurus next to me will create differently-colored stones on the empty platform, which will disappear shortly...
:'''Mamull:''' What you must do is use the {{Color|buzzword|Hued Monetoo to grant color that corresponds}} to the stones on each platform. As long as the colors match, you pass the stage.
:'''Mamull:''' So, this is actually a memory game. How about it? Pretty simple, right?
:{{DIcon}} That doesn't sound very difficult...
:'''Paimon:''' Plus, there's two of us, so it's just remembering a couple of colors...
:'''Mamull:''' Yes, yes. Oh-ho, isn't today your lucky day? But it's also an unlucky day &mdash; for my wallet.
:'''Mamull:''' So then, if you wish to play, it'll cost you 500 Mora to take part.
:'''Paimon:''' What, you still want Mora for this?
:'''Mamull:''' Ah, but what you don't know, dear guest, is that the trials of our heroes have been passed down through the generations and have required much expenditure to maintain... Such tremendous efforts are beyond the ken of outsiders.
:'''Mamull:''' Besides, compared with the final reward, 500 Mora is a drop in the bucket. Ah, it's more like a barrier to entry, testing a challenger's sincerity in wanting to experience the trial...
:'''Paimon:''' Okay okay, well...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's gonna fork up the fee, {{Traveler}}, but you gotta win!
:'''Mamull:''' Okay then, you two: Shall we get things started?
:{{DIcon}} Let's do this.
::'''Mamull:''' Ah, yes! How wonderful! How exciting! The Painted Stone Challenge welcomes its newest challenger! Let the games begin!
::;(The Iktomisaurus conjures three colored stones)
:{{DIcon}} Give me some time to prepare...
::'''Mamull:''' No worries. Just tell me once you're done.
::;(Resets the dialogue to the beginning)

;(Talk to Mamull again before coloring a stone, optional)
:'''Mamull:''' How about it? Would you like to try the Painted Stone Challenge? Or would you like to learn more about the rules again?
:{{DIcon}} Let's hear the rules real quick, shall we?
::'''Mamull:''' Hmm, true, it is always important to understand the rules before you start doing anything. *sigh* Listen carefully, then. The "Painted Stone Challenge" goes like this:

:'''Mamull:''' Now then, as for the stones mentioned in the quiz before... What color were they?
:'''Mamull:''' Well, are you ready with Round 1's answers?
:{{DIcon}} I'm done!
::'''Mamull:''' Okay, let's see about your results, shall we?
:;(If answered incorrectly)
:::'''Challenge Failed!'''
:;(If answered correctly)
:::'''Challenge Completed!'''
:::'''Mamull:''' Amazing! You cleared the first stage, no sweat!
:{{DIcon}} I haven't finished coloring yet.
::'''Mamull:''' Of course, but the longer you spend doing this, the more the color will seep out of your memory...
----
;(Talk to Mamull after passing Round 1)
:'''Mamull:''' My, how quick-witted you are, dear guest! This test is too easy, too basic for you.
:'''Mamull:''' But as you can see, there's still a little bit to go before your final reward.
:'''Mamull:''' How about it? Do you want to keep going? In any case... Hehe, it's 500 Mora to play.
:{{DIcon}} Let's keep going. We've got more than enough to cover the fee...
:'''Mamull:''' Thank you for your patronage, then!
:'''Mamull:''' Alright, alright. Now then, Round Two of the Painted Stone Challenge &mdash; a tougher challenge, to be sure. What will the result be? Would you like to begin?
:{{DIcon}} Let's do this.
::'''Mamull:''' Wonderful! Ah, such excitement! Come then, traveler from afar, dear esteemed guest: Can you pass the test this time around? This way please...!

:{{DIcon}} It's done!
::'''Mamull:''' Okay, let's see about your results, shall we?

:;(If answered correctly)
:::'''Challenge Completed!'''
:::'''Mamull:''' Amazing! The second stage couldn't even slow you!

;(Talk to Mamull after passing Round 2)
:'''Mamull:''' You had to memorize the color of the extra stone, but you guessed them all correctly without hesitation! You might be from a foreign land, but you really are an incredible hero.
:'''Mamull:''' And now, we've reached this stage at last... If you can answer this final question and clear the final stage&mdash; I mean, the final trial, and the reward will be yours!
:'''Mamull:''' How about it? Would you like to keep going?
:{{DIcon}} Here's 500 Mora...
:'''Mamull:''' And indeed it is. Thanks for your patronage!
:'''Mamull:''' Round 3 of the Painted Stone Challenge, my foreign guest, is the final test, and a tremendously exciting one at that! Shall we begin now?

;(After completing Round 3)
:'''Mamull:''' What a shame, dear guests, you almost got it...
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, that can't be! Our answer was correct, Paimon's sure of it!
:'''Mamull:''' Ah, well, doesn't everyone who gets it wrong think so too? That's normal, absolutely normal. The final test's difficulty is different from the others, though...
:'''Mamull:''' "This is the final test, sure, but it looks easy enough..."
:'''Mamull:''' Ask yourself this, my little flying guest: Did you not think this way, even if but once?
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... Maybe...?
:'''Mamull:''' And there's the rub! This is a hero's trial, mind you &mdash; there's no way I could let you breeze past it that easily.
:'''Mamull:''' But that's fine. I'll let you try again for free!
:'''Mamull:''' That way, you'll witness the final trial's true difficulty for yourself!
:'''Paimon:''' Really? No need for any Mora this time around?
:'''Paimon:''' S&mdash;Seeing as it's free, let's give it another go...
:{{DIcon}} "Free"'s the highest price of them all...
::'''Paimon:''' That doesn't make sense either, but anyway... let's give this one more try!
:{{DIcon}} Seeing as it's free...
::'''Paimon:''' That's right! This try's free anyway!
:'''Mamull:''' So then, your second try of the final trial. Shall we begin?
:{{DIcon}} Let's do this.
:'''Mamull:''' Hehe. Well then, do be careful this time.
:;(The Iktomisaurus conjures five colored stones)
:'''Exhausted Iktomisaurus:''' Coo... Cooooo...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Ah! It's the Iktomisaurus in charge of the exam questions... Does it want to say something...?
:{{DIcon|Idle}} '''Exhausted Iktomisaurus:''' Coo... Cooooo...

;(Talk to Mamull again before coloring a stone, optional)
:'''Mamull:''' Ah, what a terrible shame, isn't it &mdash; to feel as if you've gotten it instantly, but somehow fail at the end, no matter what you do.
:'''Mamull:''' But this is also part of a hero's trial. Go on then, dear foreign guest: Would you like to continue the challenge...?
:'''Mamull:''' That said, it is 500 Mora a pop. Don't forget about that.
:{{DIcon}} Let's do this.
