{{Description|A soldier encased within a Fatui war machine.<br>These skirmishers do not question if they shall live or die as they advance into nations far from home to complete reconnaissance missions and lay the groundwork for operations to come.<br>Unlike the elite [[Fatui Cicin Mages|Mages]] and [[Fatui Agents|Agents]], Fatui Skirmishers are soldiers of lesser individual might.<br>To complete their tasks and reduce losses in men and material, their tactics are thus more reliant on teamwork.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}

'''Fatui Skirmishers''' are [[Common Enemies]] found across found across [[Teyvat]]. They are foot soldiers of the [[Fatui]].

In combat, most Fatui Skirmishers are capable of generating an elemental [[Shield/Enemy|shield]] that greatly increases their [[RES]] and enhances their attacks. If their shields are destroyed with the appropriate [[Elemental Reaction]]s, they will become stunned.

==Types==
===Bracers===
Bracers primarily use ranged attacks.
*{{Enemy|Fatui Skirmisher - Geochanter Bracer|text=Geochanter Bracers}}: Fires {{Geo}} projectiles and can generate Geo elemental armor (weak to [[Blunt Attack]]s), can also generate a {{Geo}} dome field.
*{{Enemy|Fatui Skirmisher - Pyroslinger Bracer|text=Pyroslinger Bracers}}: Fires {{Pyro}} bullets and can generate Pyro elemental armor (weak to {{Hydro}})

===Legionnaires===
Legionnaries use their spraygun to perform mid-range or long-range attacks.
*{{Enemy|Fatui Skirmisher - Cryogunner Legionnaire|text=Cryogunner Legionnaires}}: Shoots a continuous spray of {{Cryo}}, can generate Cryo elemental armor (weak to {{Pyro}})
*{{Enemy|Fatui Skirmisher - Hydrogunner Legionnaire|text=Hydrogunner Legionnaires}}: Shoots {{Hydro}} projectiles that can heal allies and damage the player, can generate Hydro elemental armor (weak to {{Electro}})

===Vanguards===
Vanguards are close-quarter combatants.
*{{Enemy|Fatui Skirmisher - Anemoboxer Vanguard|text=Anemoboxer Vanguards}}: Can generate an {{Color|Anemo}} barrier which can absorb elements. This barrier will react to {{Anemo}}, {{Pyro}}, {{Electro}}, {{Cryo}} or {{Hydro}} to trigger a counterattack. They can also recuperate dazed Skirmishers to bring them back into the fight faster.
*{{Enemy|Fatui Skirmisher - Electrohammer Vanguard|text=Electrohammer Vanguards}}: Swings their hammer to deal damage and can generate {{Electro}} elemental armor (weak to {{Cryo}})

==Elemental Armor==
{{See also|Elemental Gauge Theory|Shields/Enemy}}
In general, the elemental armor generated by Fatui Skirmishers can be broken using elemental reactions. Each type of elemental armor has a particular elemental weakness, but elemental reactions caused by other elements still deal a small amount of damage to the armor. All Skirmisher Armor except the Geochanter Bracer's use a unique reaction cost coefficient. Compared to other shields, there is a large difference between the gauges required from the most effective element and the gauges required from other elements.

==Trivia==
*Bracers can summon their rifles or staffs on hand when they engage the Traveler in combat, much like how player characters do. The same principle applies to the other Skirmishers as well.
*Unlike Agents, Cicin Mages, and Mirror Maidens, Skirmishers don't carry a Delusion; instead their weapons and equipment have the ability to channel their respective elements.
*Vanguards wear Officer Caps instead of Fedoras.
*Along with the [[Kairagi]], the Fatui Vanguards and Legionnaires are the largest human enemies in-game so far.
*In a cutscene that introduces Eula, an Electrohammer Vanguard that the Traveler took down disappear in red particles instead of blue.
*Skirmishers can be seen without Their Weapons and will instead perform their Idle Animations until they Spot the Traveler. Pyroslinger Bracers will do a Salute, Cryogunners and Hydrogunners would eat Meat, Hydrogunners scratch their Stomach. Vanguards will flex their Muscles to others
