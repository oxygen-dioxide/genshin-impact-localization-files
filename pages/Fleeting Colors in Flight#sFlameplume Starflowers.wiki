|image1 = Tutorial Flameplume Starflowers 1.png
|text1  = Use the Launch Tube Gadget in your inventory and select Smelt Fireworks to access "Flameplume Starflowers: Production Challenge."
|image2 = Tutorial Flameplume Starflowers 2.png
|text2  = In the "Flameplume Starflowers: Production Challenge," you will find many smelting parameters. Use different smelting techniques to adjust the quality of each parameter. The closer the quality is to the ideal zone, the higher your Quality Score will be!
|image3 = Tutorial Flameplume Starflowers 3.png
|text3  = During the challenge, each time you click "Single Smelt," a certain amount of endurance will be decreased depending on the smelting technique used. Once endurance is depleted, no further smelting can be performed. Click "Finish Smelting" to end the challenge with the current Quality Score.
|image4 = Tutorial Flameplume Starflowers 4.png
|text4  = Other than the effects of smelting techniques, each smelting will also consume a certain amount of the Launch Tube's Firepower Value, which will change its Firepower status. When Firepower is at Medium or Full Fire, a single smelting will provide a medium and large bonus to the parameter's quality respectively.
|image5 = Tutorial Flameplume Starflowers 5.png
|text5  = Other than the effect of smelting techniques, each smelting attempt has a small chance of Curious Efficacy occurring: the current parameter's quality will definitely go up to be within the ideal zone.
