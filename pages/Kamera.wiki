The '''Kamera''' is a [[gadget]] obtained by completing the [[World Quest]] "[[Snapshots]]." As its name implies, it allows you to take pictures.

On all platforms, the Kamera can be used to take pictures in many situations where [[Photo Mode]] is unavailable, such as while [[Elemental Sight]] is active or while battling, [[gliding]], falling, or [[swimming]]. In addition, since pictures are taken instantly once the Quick-Use button is pressed, the Kamera can be used to take pictures of certain actions that are difficult to capture with Photo Mode, such as [[Talents#Combat Talents|combat talent]]s. However, the Kamera lacks the fine-tuning features found in the regular version, such as camera adjustment and options for expression and pose.

There is no cooldown period for using this gadget.

The Kamera cannot be used in [[Domains]].

Screenshots taken on PCs are saved to a ScreenShot folder in the main Genshin Impact folder, which can be found where the user installed Genshin Impact. By default, the path to the ScreenShot folder will be this or something similar:
 C:\Program Files\Genshin Impact\Genshin Impact Game\ScreenShot
