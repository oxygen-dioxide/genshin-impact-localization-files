===Duration===
* 2024/08/12 10:00 - 2024/08/26 03:59

===Requirements===
* [[Adventure Rank]] 27 or above

===Summary===
* During the event, use Motive Force points to set up Ley Line Effectors and obtain combat buffs for your team. Complete challenge stages to obtain [[Primogem]]s, [[Hero's Wit]], [[Weapon Ascension Material]]s, and other rewards.
* After the event begins, a new challenge stage will unlock every day. A total of 6 stages will be unlocked.
* Each stage is comprised of 3 combat rounds, during which you must defeat as many opponents as possible within the time limit to score points.
* Before any challenge begins, you will need to set your parties up. The same character can be placed into parties for all 3 rounds of combat.
* Party members will gain Motive Force based on their adventuring prowess. Motive Force can be used to set Ley Line Effectors to help your party gain combat buffs. The same character can only grant Motive Force once per stage.
* When configuring the Ley Line Effectors, the 3 parties will jointly contribute to the total Motive Force during challenges.
* You cannot use Food or other items during the event challenges.

===Effectors===
* Notes:
** Each Effector costs '''6''' Motive Force.
** Primary and Secondary Effectors only apply to each different party; the Resonant Effector applies to all three.
** Unlocking the Secondary Effector requires a Primary Effector to be selected.
** Unlocking the Resonant Effector requires three Secondary Effectors to be selected.
