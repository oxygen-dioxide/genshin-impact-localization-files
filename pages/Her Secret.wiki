{{Dialogue start}}
;(Wait for Kokomi near the Sangonomiya Shrine)
:{{A|vo xhlq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Kokomi isn't here yet...
:{{A|vo xhlq003 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's weird. She doesn't seem like the type to show up late to things... Eh, let's wait a while longer.

:'''''After some more time...'''''

:{{A|vo xhlq003 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How is she still not here? Do you think she could be in trouble?
:{{A|vo xhlq003 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go ask that soldier over there.
:{{A|vo xhlq003 2 shibata 01.ogg}} '''[[Shibata]]:''' Are you looking for Her Excellency?
:{{A|vo xhlq003 2 shibata 02.ogg}} '''Shibata:''' I'm afraid she isn't here at the moment. I don't know where she's gone.
:{{A|vo xhlq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So strange... Guess we should just call it a rain check then?
:{{A|vo xhlq003 2 shibata 03.ogg}} '''Shibata:''' Not necessarily. If I recall correctly, Her Excellency has made special provisions for just such a scenario in her General Operational Directives.
:{{A|vo xhlq003 2 shibata 04.ogg}} '''Shibata:''' Let me see... Ah yes, No. 98. {{Color|buzzword|"Should a visitor from afar come to see me, and should my whereabouts be unknown, direct them to proceed southward until they arrive at a tree with purple foliage."}}
:{{A|vo xhlq003 2 shibata 05.ogg}} '''Shibata:''' The footnote stipulates that this only applies when Her Excellency has made no communication regarding her whereabouts before disappearing, and even then only when the visitor in question is of VIP status.
:{{A|vo xhlq003 2 shibata 06.ogg}} '''Shibata:''' As far as I'm concerned, you two tick all of the boxes. I keep this directive on me at all times &mdash; I'm sure this is the right course of action.
:{{A|vo xhlq003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kokomi really does think of everything! Alright, let's find the place she wrote about and have a look.
----
{{Quest Description|update|The agreed time has come and gone, but Kokomi has yet to make her appearance. You learn of here{{sic}} whereabouts from the guards, but you discover there is...}}
;(Upon reaching the designated place)
:{{A|vo xhlq003 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you sure this is the right place? It feels like we keep heading deeper into the middle of nowhere...
:{{A|vo xhlq003 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, doesn't that tree look like the one she described in the directive, (Traveler)?
:{{A|vo xhlq003 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It looks like there's a way in over there... Let's take a look!
----
;(Talk to Kokomi)
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kokomi!
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So this is where you ran off to! We were gonna meet up and get things ready for the Victory Feast today, what happened?
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Oh... It's you...
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I&mdash;I apologize... I'm not feeling my usual self today.
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *gasp* You got sick? We'll go find a doctor right away!
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' No no, it's nothing like that... It's just, my energy is completely spent.
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Y&mdash;You run on energy? *gasp* You mean... you're like a Ruin Guard?
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 04.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' No, it's just a figure of speech. *sigh* I'm ashamed to admit it, but I can't always be the infinitely capable person I present myself as.
:{{DIcon}} Everyone was asking so much of you yesterday...
:{{DIcon}} I could sense things were getting to you.
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 05.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Oh... you noticed? I guess I haven't quite mastered the ability to hide how I'm feeling. I'll keep working at it...
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 06.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' To be honest, I'm not really cut out to be a leader. At first, my dream was to read up on military strategy and perhaps become an adviser.
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 07.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Constantly communicating with people, trying to retain their morale, having to read between the lines, making sure everyone gets the recognition they deserve... It's such hard work.
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 08.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' You're somehow supposed to make people feel wonderful just from being in your presence, while also commanding their respect... It doesn't come naturally to me. Truth be told, it's something I never wanted for myself.
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 09.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' But because of my bloodline, I was always going to end up being the Divine Priestess sooner or later. Like it or not, it's just the way it is.
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 10.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' So whenever I feel overwhelmed, I come here to just lose myself in a book and relax for a while...
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 11.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Don't worry, it doesn't affect my work. I handed over preparations for the Victory Feast to someone else.
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 12.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I have to make a speech tonight, and I mustn't give the troops any reason to suspect that something could be wrong. This peace was hard-won, and I want them to feel at ease.
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is there anything we can do to help?
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 13.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I should be feeling energized again soon if I hold off on work for a little longer. *sigh* If only there were some way I could listen to a good read on military strategy, I'm sure that'd speed up the process...
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 14.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I was reading a book last time I was here, but I only got about halfway through. Where did I put it...
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We'll find it for you!
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And then we'll read it out to you &mdash; to help you recover!
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 15.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' You'd do that for me? Thank you.
:{{A|vo xhlq003 3 kokomi 16.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Hehe... I'm really lucky you came back to Watatsumi Island.

;(Talk to Kokomi again)
:{{A|vo dialog xhlq003 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Ahh... I don't even want to move right now.
:{{A|vo dialog xhlq003 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' It'd be so nice if all my work could just do itself without me having to lift a finger...
----
{{Quest Description|update|You find a listless Kokomi at her secret base. Read her a favored military treatise to quickly restore her Energy.}}
;(Investigate first spot)
:{{A|vo xhlq003 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa... Look at all these petitions.
:{{A|vo xhlq003 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So does Kokomi make time to deal with these even when she's resting?
:{{A|vo xhlq003 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Sangonomiya Events Cash Flow Statement," "Consolidated Annual Report on Fishing Production," "Watatsumi Island Monthly Maintenance Expenses Breakdown"...
:{{A|vo xhlq003 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This is a lot of work for one person. And it's on top of all the directives she has to write and the people she has to meet day-to-day. It's no wonder she gets burnt out from time to time.
:{{A|vo xhlq003 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's track down that book and help her feel like herself again!

;(Talk to Kokomi again)
:{{A|vo dialog xhlq003 kokomi 03.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I'm actually pretty social when I have the energy.
:{{A|vo dialog xhlq003 kokomi 04.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Still, talking to people I don't know is really draining...
----
;(Investigate second spot)
:{{A|vo xhlq003 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, look, (Traveler). Could this be the book she wanted?
::'''Secret Notes:'''
::Today, I spent the entire afternoon arguing with representatives from the merchant association. Energy {{Color|pyro|-4}}.
::Many things must still be settled. I need to ensure that they allow the goods to flow smoothly, but I must make sure that their money is made through legal means...
:: &nbsp;
::Today, I finished a day's worth of work. Energy {{Color|pyro|-3}}.
::I'll have to write up another batch of directives tonight. Hopefully, this won't go on too late. I still need to perform an inspection tomorrow.
:: &nbsp;
::The wind is very strong outside. Energy {{Color|pyro|-2}}.
::It seems like it will rain soon. I can only hope that the waves aren't as rough, and those who go out fishing can return safely.
:: &nbsp;
::News of the peace talks reached us today. Energy {{Color|bz|+2}}.
::An end to this war will surely make everyone on Watatsumi Island happy, won't it?
:: &nbsp;
::Today, we received word that the Tenryou Commission might be colluding with the Fatui. Energy {{Color|pyro|-5}}.
::Even I'm struggling to understand what's going on...
:: &nbsp;
::Swordfish II's captain came back today. Energy {{Color|bz|+4}}.
::We tacitly agreed not to speak of Teppei, and no one spoke of those who sacrificed their lives during the war... This peace was far too hard-fought.
:: &nbsp;
::Lots of people spoke to me today again. Energy {{Color|pyro|-3}}.
::Looking at their earnest faces, I can't help but think back to the time that I took up the post of Divine Priestess. Have I really lived up to their expectations all these years?
:{{A|vo xhlq003 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' "Swordfish captain came back today. Energy +4..."
:{{A|vo xhlq003 5 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Ah, that's... that's just, um...
:{{DIcon}} We saw nothing.
:{{DIcon}} (And if we did, it was all Paimon's fault.)
:{{A|vo xhlq003 5 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Give. It. Here.
:{{A|vo xhlq003 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh-heh, guess that was the wrong one... Let's keep looking.

;(Talk to Kokomi again)
:{{A|vo dialog xhlq003 kokomi 05.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' ...You saw it, didn't you?
----
;(Investigate third spot)
:{{A|vo xhlq003 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's gotta be this one, right, (Traveler)?
:{{A|vo xhlq003 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Look, there's even a bookmark. None of the other books have one, so she must have finished reading those already.
:{{A|vo xhlq003 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew, it's pretty dense. Paimon doesn't understand a thing...
:{{A|vo xhlq003 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, let's take it over and read it to her!
----
;(Read the mentioned book to Kokomi)
:{{A|vo xhlq003 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kokomi, is this the book you wanted?
:{{A|vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 01.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Hmm, I'm not sure, actually... Could you read a bit out loud?
:{{DIcon}} "Act to the plan, and plan to the situation"...
:{{DIcon}} "Attack where the enemy is weak, emerge where the enemy is blind"...
:{{A|vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 02.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' *yawns* Yes, that's the one! Thank you.

:'''''You read Kokomi her favorite military treatise.'''''

:{{A|vo xhlq003 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kokomi? Kokomi...
:{{A|vo xhlq003 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no, she's fallen asleep. What're we gonna do, (Traveler)?
:{{A|vo xhlq003 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Tonight's the Victory Feast! Not to mention that the peace talks are just around the corner. She's got so much to do...
:{{DIcon}} Let's let her rest a while.
::{{A|vo xhlq003 7 paimon 05a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You sure that's a good idea?
::{{A|vo xhlq003 7 paimon 05a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, she does look pretty exhausted. Guess there's still some time to go, too. Alright, let's keep her company while she rests.
::{{A|vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03a.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Avoid disaster... Protect peace at all costs...
::{{A|vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03a 1.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' The war's over... Things are slowly getting better...
::{{A|vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03a 2.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Did you see...?
::'''''You take a break together with Kokomi for a while more.'''''
::{{A|vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03a 3.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Uhhhh... Huh? What time is it? Did I fall asleep?
::{{A|vo xhlq003 7 paimon 05a 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yup, you've been out for ages! It's nearly time for the feast!
::{{A|vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03a 4.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I can't believe it got so late!
::{{A|vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03a 5.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' *sigh* I haven't slept that peacefully in so long. That's gotta be three whole energy points right there. Should be enough to see me through the peace talks.
::{{A|vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03a 6.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Thank you, (Traveler). Well, we better get ourselves over there, it's nearly time to light the bonfire.
::{{A|vo xhlq003 7 paimon 05a 3.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Woohoo, Kokomi's back to full energy! Good to have you back!
:{{DIcon}} Let's wake her up.
::{{A|vo xhlq003 7 paimon 05b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We probably should, after all, she did say she wanted to wrap everything up before the feast kicks off!
::{{A|vo xhlq003 7 paimon 05b 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kokomi, wakey-wakey!
::{{A|vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03b.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Hmmmm...? Was I asleep? ...What time is it?
::{{A|vo xhlq003 7 paimon 05b 2.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Time to get going! It's nearly time for the feast!
::{{A|vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03b 1.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Really? It's that time already? Ughhhh... I still don't feel like I'm fully recharged.
::{{DIcon}} I'll buy you a new book on military strategy.
::{{A|vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03b 2.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Really? Yes! I want the latest volume of the Teyvat Art of War!
::{{A|vo xhlq003 7 kokomi 03b 3.ogg}} '''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' The Yae Publishing House published it last month, but I haven't had the chance to get my hands on it... No backing out now, okay?
::{{A|vo xhlq003 7 paimon 05b 3.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, that really perked her up.
::{{A|vo xhlq003 7 paimon 05b 4.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, let's get to the feast!
