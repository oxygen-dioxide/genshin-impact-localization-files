{{Enemy Attacks
|enemy = Cryo Mitachurl

|name_1 = Frozen Shield
|desc_1 = The Ice Shieldwall Mitachurl is equipped with a {{Color|Cryo|[[Frozen#Frozen Element|Frozen]]}} [[shield]], which blocks incoming DMG from the direction that it is facing. This shield is vulnerable to {{Pyro}}, {{Electro}} and [[Poise Damage]], and weakest to {{Pyro}}. In [[Subzero Climate]]s, the shield will regenerate health due to the cold if it is not being constantly damaged, so the shield must be broken quickly.
{{Elemental Shield Data|Cryo|10}}

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A muscular hilichurl that uses solid ice as a shield, wielding it in battle.<br />Reason normally dictates that large creatures that see a lot of action should burn through a great number of calories to sustain themselves. As such, the present-day El Musk has proposed the "Mitachurl Index." This index correlates the percentage of mitachurls within the hilichurl population to the stability and success of hilichurl foraging activity.|[[Archive]]}}
