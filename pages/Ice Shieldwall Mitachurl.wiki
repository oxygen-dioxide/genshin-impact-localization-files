{{Description|A muscular hilichurl that uses solid ice as a shield, wielding it in battle.<br />Reason normally dictates that large creatures that see a lot of action should burn through a great number of calories to sustain themselves. As such, the present-day El Musk has proposed the "Mitachurl Index." This index correlates the percentage of mitachurls within the hilichurl population to the stability and success of hilichurl foraging activity.|[[Archive]]}}

==Stats==

==Abilities and Attacks==
* '''Frozen Shield:''' The Ice Shieldwall Mitachurl is equipped with a {{Color|Cryo|[[Frozen#Frozen Element|Frozen]]}} [[shield]], which blocks incoming DMG from the direction that it is facing. This shield is vulnerable to {{Pyro}}, {{Electro}} and [[Poise Damage]], and weakest to {{Pyro}}. In [[Subzero Climate]]s, the shield will regenerate health due to the cold if it is not being constantly damaged, so the shield must be broken quickly.

* '''Shield Charge:''' Charges towards the player with its shield, rapidly dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}} to players in its path. At the end of the charge, swings its shield at the player, dealing an additional '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}}.

* '''Charge:''' When without its shield, charges towards the player character with brute force, rapidly dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}} to players in its path.

* '''Smack:''' If the player strays too close, swings its shield or delivers a punch with its fist, dealing '''100% ATK''' or '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|Black|Physical DMG}}.

* '''Cryo Slime Throw:''' If the player is at a different elevation, digs a [[Cryo Slime]] out of the ground and throws it at the player, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}.
