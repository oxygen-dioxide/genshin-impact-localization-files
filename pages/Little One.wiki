'''Little One''' is a [[Tepetlisaur Whelp]] [[NPC]] that first appears in the {{Quest|Lost in the Woods}}.

The name "Little One" is used initially in an in-game text; the [[Traveler]] gives him a name (chosen by the player) shortly after meeting him, after which he is referred to by that given name. The player receives a [[Reaffirmed Accord of Appellation]] that will allow Little One to be renamed once.

==Location==
Little One can be found in the [[Rest Area]] after completing {{Quest|Gifts and Gifts in Return}}, and before [[Someday, We All Must Walk Alone]].

==Naming==
{{Main|Lost in the Woods#Gameplay Notes}}

A number of names such as "Traveler" (and their equivalents in all localizations) are rejected by the system when naming Little One. Other names such as "Paimon" will be rejected by [[Paimon]] with special dialogue, and notable names including "LittleOne" and "HashBrown" will be accepted and will result in special dialogues.

==Profile==
Little One had met [[Kukulkan]] at some point prior to the Traveler's arrival in [[Natlan]], though he was not aware of his true identity as the sage had assumed several identities during their conversation. Kukulkan called Little One the "Chosen of [[Dragon]]s" and stated that hope lied with him. He said that they would meet again after all had been done, and Little One would be the one to decide matters after visiting the sacred mountain.

During their arrival to Natlan, the Traveler and Paimon were brought into a strange space where Little One and an adult [[Tepetlisaur]] were attacked by [[riftwolves]]. After killing the riftwolves, the Traveler indwelled the adult [[Saurian]] and freed Little One, giving it a name before leaving the strange space.

While exploring Natlan, the Traveler runs into [[Manqu]], who explains that the distinctive red mark that Little One has on his horn is called "[[Flamelord]]'s Blessing." Saurians with this mark often possess incredible power greater than other ordinary Saurians. However, since this is a form of atavism, and the power is that of far more ancient dragons, Natlan's Saurians can no longer withstand it today, and in the process of growing, those with this mark will sometimes be killed by this power, or driven mad by it. Those with this mark are also thought to be dangerous and are rejected by the [[Wayob]] and the [[Night Kingdom]].<ref name="Manqu">{{Ref/NPC|Manqu}}</ref> 

Manqu recommends that Little One be handed over to the [[Children of Echoes]] to be taken care of, until his eventual passing. When the Traveler refuses, he suggests going to the [[Great Volcano of Tollan]] for a ritual to allow him to receive acceptance again, a practice no longer attempted by the six great tribes today due its low rate of success.<ref name="Manqu"/> During their journey, the Traveler and Little One explore several hidden areas in Natlan and also befriend several inhabitants, both human and saurian.

While exploring an ancient ruin, Little One assists the Traveler in defeating an [[Abyss-Corroded Golden Wolflord]], discovering a [[Golden Entreaty (Revelations from the Past)|Golden Entreaty]] after its defeat, which the Traveler and Manqu believed were necessary to perform the name-cleaning rite.

When the Traveler arrives at [[Ochkanatlan]], Little One accompanies them alongside [[Bona]] and her companion [[Cocouik]], discovering an ancient temple known as the [[Tonatiuh]] and activating it. When they found the second [[Golden Entreaty (Moment of Awakening)|Golden Entreaty]], [[Och-Kan]] stole it and the Traveler and Paimon pursued him, while Bona and Little One remained behind. As the two viewed the dying Och-Kan's memories, one of them showed Little One being spoken to by a mysterious dragon sage, who claimed that Little One would determine the future. The two then returned to Little One and asked if he had spoken to someone recently, though they could not understand him. The trip to the fallen kingdom was worth their time, as they had recovered the Golden Entreaty after defeating Och-Kan.

After acquiring both Golden Entreaties, the Traveler, Paimon and Little One approached the [[Great Volcano of Tollan]] and entered it. During the exploration, the group eventually reached the volcano's core, facing a [[Primeval Source Dragon Mech|Source Dragon Mech]] that imprisoned the Traveler and Paimon. Little One was eventually called by the dragon sage, introducing itself as Kukulkan. Kukulkan revealed the [[Huitzilopochtli]] device, which would turn all of Natlan into [[Phlogiston]] that would destroy the Abyss should it threaten Teyvat again, and Kukulkan asked Little One to activate the array, but before they did so, it remembered their time with the Traveler. This surprised Kukulkan, as he had not anticipated that Little One would remember them.

Little One ultimately refrained from activating the device, stating to Kukulkan that they did not want any harm to befall its companions. Kukulkan pointed out that the Traveler and Paimon might not hold the same view of him, but Little One did not care, proclaiming that regardless of their views on him, they were important to him. Kukulkan then told him that without the primal fire he had gifted him, he would lose his strength and power of speech, but Little One did not care, stating that they didn't have to know something "silly."

Little One eventually breaks out of the plane and reunites with the Traveler, working with them to destroy the Source Dragon Mech. Afterwards, it reverts back to its young form and collapses, with the Flamelord's Blessing finally being removed. As the volcano begins to shake, the Traveler picks up Little One and runs out, after which they recover. Though the mark is still on its forehead, it no longer has a faint warmth, indicating that the blessing was successfully removed. Little One then celebrates the removal of its blessing as the three head back to society to celebrate with a feast.

After completing all of its quests '''(See Quests and Events)''', Little One wants Traveler and Paimon to take a picture together, having acquired a [[Kamera]] through unknown means. After taking a photo, the Traveler realizes that Little One intends to go on his own adventure without them. Both bid a tearful farewell to him, telling him to be careful and live a happy life. He presses his horn on Paimon's forehead before nuzzling at the Traveler's palm. Shortly afterwards, he turns around and plods off to begin his journey.

===Alternative Continuity===
During the world quest ''[[An Omen of Annihilation and the Final Entreaty]]'', Little One may choose instead to activate [[Huitzilopochtli]] and transform all matter in [[Natlan]] (and eventually [[Teyvat]]) into [[Phlogiston]]. With the disappearance of the [[Pyro Archon]], this results in Little One becoming the new Pyro [[Dragon Sovereign]], and the only remaining living being in the [[Sacred Flame]]. His lifespan continues on for billions of years until the Flame inevitably fades. However, Little One still recalls his adventures with the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] fondly, and wonders if he could have made an alternative choice instead.

===Appearance===
Little One is a Tepetlisaur Whelp. He is distinguished from others of his kind by the red mark on his horn and the red cloth that the Traveler tied around his tail to cover his wound.<br>
In his adult version, Little One is distinguished from others of [[Tepetlisauri]] by the red mark on his horn and the red cloth on his arm.
