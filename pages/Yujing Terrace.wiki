'''Yujing Terrace''' is the westmost part of [[Liyue Harbor]] and its wealthiest residential district. It is built along the cliffside of [[Mt. Tianheng]], overlooking the Harbor. The entrance to the district is located at the north, where a crossroads links Yujing Terrace, [[Feiyun Slope]], the small island that [[Bubu Pharmacy]] stands on and the road exiting the city and leading towards the [[Guizhong Ballista]].
