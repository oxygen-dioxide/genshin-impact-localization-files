{{Description|Far from the bustling harbor, the Yujing Terrace rises along with Mt. Tianheng. Here, the Qixing and the leaders of many enterprises tirelessly drive Liyue's prosperity and stability.|[[Archive]]}}

'''Yujing Terrace''' is the westmost part of [[Liyue Harbor]] and its wealthiest residential district. It is built along the cliffside of [[Mt. Tianheng]], overlooking the Harbor. The entrance to the district is located at the north, where a crossroads links Yujing Terrace, [[Feiyun Slope]], the small island that [[Bubu Pharmacy]] stands on and the road exiting the city and leading towards the [[Guizhong Ballista]].
