{{Description|The most formidable warriors of the [[hilichurl]] tribes.<br>Fighting and eating meat are the two most important things to hilichurls, because those are what make them grow stronger. All young hilichurls dream of growing up to become a big and strong mitachurl, because that way they can eat more meat, and fight more battles.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}

'''Mitachurls''' are an [[Elite Enemy|elite]] enemy group.

In combat, Mitachurls use melee attacks to cause heavy damage and [[knockback]]. If the player is out of range, they will grab [[Slimes]] of varying types from the ground and throw them at the player.

==Types==
===Axe Mitachurls===
These Mitachurls are armed with an axe which they use to inflict {{Color|Physical DMG}} normally, but can deal {{Color|Elemental DMG}} by slamming a slime into their axe to [[Elemental Infusion|infuse]] it. This infusion can be dispelled using the correct Elemental Reactions
{{Enemy List|Blazing Axe Mitachurl;Crackling Axe Mitachurl}}

===Shield Mitachurls===
These Mitachurls are armed with a massive shield which protects them from frontal attacks much like [[Hilichurl Guards]], although their larger size makes them harder to stagger through brute force. They also use these shields to directly attack players, dealing {{Color|Physical DMG}}. The shields can be destroyed by attacks, although depending on the shield type used by the Mitachurl in question, some attacks are more effective than others. When the shield is destroyed, the Mitachurl will resort to punches and charge attacks.
