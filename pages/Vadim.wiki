'''Vadim''' is a member of the [[Fatui]]. He is an event-exclusive [[NPC]] who appeared in the {{Quest|Uninvited Guests}}.

==Profile==
Vadim is one of the Fatui assigned to seek the [[Festering Desire]]. Judging from his voice-overs, it seems that he was given orders  by [[Signora]].

They have found the Traveler, [[Sucrose]], and the [[Reckless Pallad]] in [[Dragonspine]] and wishes to take the sword by force along with attempting to kill them for interfering. However, after a short fight, he and his fellow Fatui got defeated.
