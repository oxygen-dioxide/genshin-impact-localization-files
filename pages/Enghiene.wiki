==Profile==
Enghiene is an officer from the [[Maison Gardiennage]] and a veteran member of the [[Gardes]]. She was [[Turenna]]'s drillmaster before she joined the Special Patrol.

During the Event [[Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta]], she takes over Turenna's duty to watch over the Lil' Fungi's Fun-Tastic Fiesta preview event after Turenna received new orders from the Special Patrol. She is enjoying the game and fell in love with the Fungi, especially [[Bongo-Head]] and [[Kindlejoy]], because of their similar characteristics to [[Tidalga]].

During the Event [[Dance of Resolute Will]], she confronted [[Costentin]] for unauthorized investigation of the domain he found and for not declaring his use of weapons to the Maison Gardiennage. She takes him to the Maison Gardiennage to issue him a verbal warning.

During the Event [[Invasive Fish Wrangler]], she arrested the supplier behind [[Phony Bejeweled Unihornfish|The Unchained]] following advice from [[Jala]].

===Appearance===
Enghiene is a blue [[Melusine]] with blue hair and half-lidded purple eyes, she wears a blue Maison Gardiennage uniform and a blue hat.
