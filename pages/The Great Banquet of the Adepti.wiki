==Event Duration==
January 28, 2022 – February 6, 2022 23:59 (UTC+8)
* Rewards cannot be claimed after the event ends. Please claim them in time.

==Eligibility==
Travelers who have reached [[Adventure Rank]] 10 or above can participate in this event.

==Event Description==
During the event, Travelers can log in to Genshin Impact daily, complete the [[Daily Commissions]], consume [[Original Resin]], and salvage at sea to obtain the event item, Shimmering Shells. Shimmering Shells can be used to unlock various areas of the Serenitea Pot in the event, as well as to receive event rewards. When all the main areas are unlocked, you can use the remaining Shimmering Shells to go to [[Tubby]] and draw for some of [[Liyue]]'s specialties.

==Obtain Shimmering Shells [[File:TGBA Shimmering Shell.png|40px]]==
Travelers can obtain the event item, Shimmering Shells through the following methods:
# Complete the following actions in Genshin Impact every day:
#* Log into the game daily (+200)
#* Complete 2 Daily Commissions daily (+100)
#* Use 40 Original Resin daily (+100)
# During the event, you can obtain Shimmering Shells in the salvaging at sea mini-game. You can receive up to 400 Shimmering Shells via salvaging per day.

* Quests and the salvaging mini-game limit refresh daily at 04:00 (Server Time)
* Shimmering Shells need to be collected manually in the event page. Shimmering Shells that have not been collected will also be reset when daily quests are refreshed the next day. So, remember to collect them!

==Salvage at Sea==
# Travelers can log in to the web event page every day and share the event once daily to get a chance to go to sea. When the number of trips out to sea is at least 1, you can begin the mini-game.
#* Log in to the web event daily (+3)
#* Share the event once a day (+2)
#* Visit Genshin Impact's Facebook / Twitter / Instagram Page (+1)
# Daily quests and the number of voyages will reset daily at 04:00 (Server Time). Please be sure to accept and complete them in time.
# In the mini-game, Travelers can fish for various items and fish from the bottom of the sea, which will then be converted to the corresponding number of Shimmering Shells. The Shimmering Shells will automatically be added to the Inventory once the round is over.
# You may even find red Rarity Chests while on a salvage voyage. Rarity Chests will not be converted to Shimmering Shells, and will be temporarily stored on the boat and opened when evaluation is complete. The rarities you collect will be stored in the "Underwater Rarities" showcase on the home page. Collect all five types to receive additional rewards.

* Progress will not be saved upon abandoning the voyage, and any Shimmering Shells or Rarity Chests caught at the time will not be added to the inventory, but the number of voyages will not be deducted.
* If the Traveler plays the mini-game at around 04:00 server time each day (when the daily quest and salvage limit is reset and refreshed), there may be a short network error, please refresh the page in that case.
* For more details on how to play, please check the "Gameplay Details" pop-up window on the mini-game page.

===Gameplay Details===
* Traveler, there are many objects and treasures underwater, waiting for you to salvage. The duration of each salvage voyage will last 60 seconds.
* The net in your hand will swing back and forth. When you tap on the screen (PC players can press the ↓ arrow key), the net will be cast in the direction it is swinging, grabbing the first item it touches and pulling it back to the boat. The bigger and heavier the item, the slower it will pull back~
* When items are pulled back to the ship, they will be converted to a corresponding number of Shimmering Shells.
* Underwater objects and their corresponding value of Shimmering Shells:

* You may even find red Rarity Chests while on a salvage voyage. Rarity Chests will not be converted to Shimmering Shells, and will be temporarily stored on the boat and opened when evaluation is complete. The rarities you collect will be stored in the "Underwater Rarities" showcase on the home page.
* When there are 20 seconds left on the countdown, a Liyue adeptus will help out. The adepti and their corresponding buff effects are:
{| class="article-table" style="text-align: center"
! Adepti
! Support Buff
|-
|Zhongli
|In the remaining time, the value of the salvaged item is twice its original value.
|-
|Madame Ping
|In the remaining time, you will be able to pull items back faster.
|-
|Xiao
|In the remaining time, the net's casting speed will be faster.
|-
|Ganyu
|In the remaining time, everything underwater will freeze and stop moving.
|}
* You also have a chance of getting caught in a storm. In the storm map, with 20 seconds left on the countdown, a vortex will pass by, stirring up objects on the sea floor, and the map will be reset. Fortune favors the brave, Traveler, so rely on your own strength and bravery to face the treacherous weather! (In stormy weather, the adepti will not be able to help, so it's a good chance to test your true mettle! You can do it, Traveler!)
* When the 60-second countdown is over, or you have collected all the items and treasures from the bottom of the sea in this stage, you will return to shore for evaluation. Any Shimmering Shells you have caught will go into your inventory. However, if you leave a voyage before the end of the countdown, your progress will not be saved and the Shimmering Shells collected in that voyage will not be added to your inventory. Keep going until the end, Traveler!

==Teapot Spirit's Blessings==
# After Travelers have unlocked all areas in the Serenitea Pot, the Teapot Spirit's Blessings section will be available.
# Travelers can go to Tubby to use the remaining Shimmering Shells to draw for Liyue's specialties. There are 10 specialties in total.

==Event Rewards==
===Area Unlock Rewards===
Travelers can consume the corresponding number of Shimmering Shells to unlock the five areas in the event, and obtain rewards such as [[Primogem]]s, [[Hero's Wit]], and [[Mystic Enhancement Ore]].

====Details of Underwater Rarities====
The treasure showcase will display the underwater rarities that the Traveler has collected.

# Underwater rarities can be obtained in two ways:
## Salvaging on a Voyage: While on a voyage, you have a chance to salvage a red Rarity Chest. When the salvaging has finished, the chest will open and you will obtain a random underwater rarity. (Priority will be given to unlocking underwater rarities that the Traveler doesn't already own.)
## The Teapot Traveling Salesman, Chubby, will appear a day after you begin the event. Each day, he would find an underwater rarity and ask if you would like to exchange 50 Shimmering Shells for it.
* The treasures will only be temporarily stored in the treasure showcase. If you salvage something from the Jade Chamber's lost collection, you must return it to Lady Ningguang!
