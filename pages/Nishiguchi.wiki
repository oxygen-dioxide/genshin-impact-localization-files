{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Nishiguchi:''' All of my life savings are gone...
:'''Nishiguchi:''' Are you here to draw amusement from my pitiful life...
:{{DIcon}} Whatever happened?
::'''Nishiguchi:''' Listen to me. How could such a thing happen...
::'''Nishiguchi:''' I was robbed of all I had!
::'''Nishiguchi:''' Ugh, curse those thieves!
::'''Nishiguchi:''' Ah, now I feel like I'm cursing at myself... Eh, wait. This doesn't have anything to do with me, does it? Haha...
::'''Nishiguchi:''' Anyway, in the name of [[Electro Archon]] and heaven, I know I was wrong! But these were the wealth that I stole&mdash;No, took... Uh, earned from all over!
::'''Nishiguchi:''' Wh&mdash;Why are you looking at me like that...
::{{DIcon}} Steal?
::'''Nishiguchi:''' Huh? Did I say that word? Hahah...
::'''Nishiguchi:''' Uh, what are you doing? Wait, please! Put your sword away. I&mdash;I will tell you everything I know!
::'''Nishiguchi:''' I'll be honest. I was indeed a thief once. But just when I was about to quit my job, all of my savings were stolen!
::'''Nishiguchi:''' This is probably what I deserve... But if someone could help me retrieve my money, I'll be a good person and atone for the rest of my life.
::'''Nishiguchi:''' Ah, should I ask [[Bantan Sango Detective Agency]] for help?
::{{DIcon}} A thief visiting a detective agency...?
::'''Nishiguchi:''' Desperate times call for desperate measures. Maybe they'll help me.
::'''Nishiguchi:''' Anyway, the people from Bantan Sango Detective Agency are far more competent than those useless pieces of garbage at the [[Police Station]]. You can ask them for help if you need anything.
::'''Nishiguchi:''' I've heard that the president of the agency is very talented. She might be able to help me retrieve my wealth, haha...
::'''Nishiguchi:''' But I don't think I have the money to pay for the commission. Ugh...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye...
::'''Nishiguchi:''' Ah, just leave! And take your mockery of me with you.
