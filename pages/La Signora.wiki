===Phase 1===
In Phase 1, Signora will utilize {{Color|Cryo}}-based attacks via her [[Delusion]]. During this phase, [[Sheer Cold]] will accumulate at a rate of '''3.33%''' per second. Once the gauge is full, the active character will lose HP at a rate of '''3% Max HP + 150 HP''' every second. '''Hearts of Flame''' are placed at the corners of the arena, and have the following effects:
* While near a Heart of Flame, the Sheer Cold gauge will deplete by 12.5% per second.
* After a Heart of Flame sustains 8 hits, it will be destroyed, releasing a wave of heat that completely depletes the Sheer Cold gauge and clears all Frosted Floor in its quarter of the arena.

{{Enemy Attacks
|enemy = Signora

|name_1 = Frosted Floor
|desc_1 = Most of Signora's attacks will cause Frosted Floor: the floor will become patched with ice, dealing '''6.25% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DoT}}. Destroying a Heart of Flame will remove nearby frosted floor.
|file_1 = Signora Hearts of Flame

|name_2 = Pain for Pain
|desc_2 = Upon receiving a single instance of DMG that exceeds '''30%''' of Signora's Max [[HP]], the DMG above the threshold is nullified. Additionally, she deals '''125% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} around her and fully fills the Sheer Cold gauge of all players.
|file_2 = Signora Counterstrike 1

|name_3 = Ice Shards and Frozen Wheel
|desc_3 = Fires five ice shards in a tight spread followed by an ice wheel that curves towards the player, both dealing '''37.5% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} to characters they hit. This attack is always immediately used at the beginning of the fight.
|file_3 = Signora Ice Shards Frozen Wheel

|name_4 = Frostblade Hailstorm
|desc_4 = Rains down ice in a small area, dealing '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} and leaving '''Frosted Floor''' in the area struck.
|file_4 = Signora Hailstorm

|name_5 = Ice Flower
|desc_5 = Imbues three ice flowers which will explode after a short period of time, each dealing '''37.5% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} and leaving '''Frosted Floor'''.
* '''Enhanced:''' While in the Carmine Chrysalis state, periodically drops single ice flowers at various locations across the arena.

|name_6 = Biting Shards
|desc_6 = Signora launches 5 icy spears that home in on the player character one after another, dealing '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} on hit.
* '''Enhanced:''' While in the Carmine Chrysalis state, launches 9 icy spears in quick succession with even stronger homing property, also leaving '''Frosted Floor''' where struck.
|strat_6 = To dodge the enhanced version of this attack, keep a generous distance from Signora and make sure that the active character is not affected by the Cryo status. Simply walk side to side to dodge each missile. Dashing or sprinting is not required nor advised. [[Alternate Sprint]] users [[Kamisato Ayaka|Ayaka]] and [[Mona]] can also spam their Alternate Sprints to evade the rapid-firing missiles.

|file_6_2 = Signora Glacial Missiles Normal Enhanced
|caption_6_2 = Enhanced

|name_7 = Snowfall Strike
|desc_7 = Signora releases a burst of frost around her, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}. If the player is too far away, she will teleport close to them before releasing the burst.

|name_8 = The Tsaritsa's Benevolence
|desc_8 = Signora conjures six icy spears that surround the player character before converging on them, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} and leaving '''Frosted Floor'''. This attack is used if the fight has taken too long.
|file_8 = Signora Tsaritsas Benevolence

|name_9 = The Frozen Void
|desc_9 = Signora marks the player character with a large ice spear before striking it towards the player, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}.

|name_10 = Carmine Chrysalis
|desc_10 = Upon reaching '''20%''' HP, La Signora relocates at the center of the arena in order to encase herself inside a large ice cocoon. During this phase, Signora will gain a {{Color|Frozen}} shield, while Sheer Cold accumulation is doubled and and her moveset will change. She will stop using most of her attacks except for '''Biting Shards''', '''Ice Flower''', and '''The Tsaritsa's Benevolence''', the former two of which will gain noticeable changes.
* Crimson Lotus Moths will periodically spawn around the arena which can be picked up. This will imbue the active character's next attack with a strong '''8GU''' {{Color|Pyro}} application, dealing higher DMG against the cocoon compared to any other attack.
* Using [[Elemental Reactions]], particularly {{Pyro}}, will help speed up the cocoon's destruction slightly.
{{Elemental Shield Data|Cryo|60}}
|file_10 = Signora Frozen Cocoon
|file_10_2 = Signora Crimson Lotus Moth
|caption_10_2 = Crimson Lotus Moth

|name_11 = Sheer Cold Accumulation
|desc_11 = Signora's attacks will increase the Sheer Cold gauge on hit. Weak attacks increase Sheer Cold by '''2%''', strong attacks increase Sheer Cold by '''5%''', and '''Frosted Floor'''{{'|b}}s DMG increases Sheer Cold by '''2.5%'''.

* Strong attacks include '''Snowfall Strike''', '''Ice Shards''', '''Frozen Wheel''', '''Frostblade Hailstorm''', '''The Frozen Void''', and '''Tsaritsa's Benevolence'''.
}}

===Phase 2===
Now assuming her erstwhile moniker, Signora utilizes {{Color|Pyro}}-based attacks. During this phase, [[Blazing Heat]] will accumulate at a rate of '''3.33%''' per second. Once the gauge is full the player will lose HP at a rate of '''3% Max HP + 150 HP''' every second. '''Eyes of Frost''' are placed at the corners of the arena and have the following effects:
* While near an Eye of Frost, the Blazing Heat gauge will deplete by 12.5% per second.
* After an Eye of Frost sustains 8 hits, it will be destroyed, releasing a wave of cold that completely depletes the Blazing Heat gauge and clears all Embered Earth in its quarter of the arena.

{{Enemy Attacks
|enemy = Signora

|name_1 = Embered Earth
|desc_1 = Most of her attacks will cause '''Embered Earth''': the floor will become molten for a short period of time, dealing '''6.25% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DoT}}. Destroying an Eye of Frost will remove nearby Embered Earth.
|file_1 = Signora Eyes of Frost

|name_2 = Pain for Pain
|desc_2 = Upon receiving a single instance of DMG that exceeds '''20%''' of Signora's Max [[HP]], the DMG above the threshold is nullified. Additionally, she deals '''125% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} around her and fully fills the Blazing Heat gauge of all players.
|file_2 = Signora Counterstrike 2

|name_3 = Decimating Lash
|desc_3 = Uses a fiery whip to lash out the player, dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}}. This attack comes in four variations:
* A simple whip attack in melee range.
* A two-lash combo with her whip in melee range, usually performed after using '''Warp'''.
* A single strike in front of her with a longer range.
* A long-ranged attack, splitting her whip into three and striking in a large AoE in front of her. She then lashes her whip out of the floor, causing fiery explosions, dealing '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} as well as leaving a the floor within its AoE burnt.

|name_4 = Warp
|desc_4 = Cloaks herself in her flames before moving to a different position, dealing '''37.5% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} on contact and leaving '''Embered Earth''' on her trail.

|name_5 = Fireball
|desc_5 = Signora hurls a large rolling dark fireball against the player, dealing '''62.5% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} upon contact and leaving '''Embered Earth''' along its path. This is usually done as a follow up to either '''The Witch's Wrath''' or '''Hellfire Onslaught'''.

|name_6 = The Witch's Wrath
|desc_6 = Signora unfurls her wings and rains down waves of molten rocks, each dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} and leaving '''Embered Earth'''.

|name_7 = Hellfire Onslaught
|desc_7 = Signora will unleash her wings to summon a flock of small crimson lotus moths in front of her, dealing '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} and leaving '''Embered Earth'''.

|name_8 = Crimson Lotus Moth
|desc_8 = Signora summons a Crimson Lotus Moth that homes to the player character, dealing '''37.5% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} on contact.
|file_8 = Signora Hellfire Butterfly

|name_9 = Whirling Blaze
|desc_9 = Signora spins herself to transform into a blazing tornado that moves around the arena, dealing '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} upon contact. The tornado will also unleash 4 mini-tornadoes around it every ~3 seconds, each dealing '''37.5% ATK''' as {{Color|Pyro DMG}} upon contact. The main tornado leaves '''Embered Earth''' on its path. At the end of the duration, Signora will spread her wings at the middle of the arena to unleash an intense heat along with another 4 mini-tornadoes, increasing Blazing Heat by '''50%'''. This attack is used if the fight goes on for too long while Signora is under 50% health, or immediately once her health reaches 20%.

==Strategy==
===Phase 1===
Like [[Enter the Golden House|Childe's fight]], Signora is more resistant towards Cryo and Pyro attacks during her respective phases. Signora starts the fight off in her Harbinger state, utilizing {{Cryo}} attacks. Her attacks will generate [[Climate|Sheer Cold]] that can accumulate quickly if the player gets hit by her attacks.

To counter Sheer Cold, there are four Hearts of Flame at the corners of the arena, which slowly remove these stacks by standing near them. As the fight continues, Frosted Floor can accumulate around these objects &mdash; destroying them will clear any nearby iced flooring and Sheer Cold accumulated by the player. It may be suitable not to immediately destroy the Hearts of Flame unless needed, as they take a while to respawn and may leave the player with no heat source for a short time if none are currently present. These hearts' durability is based on hits instead of health, so fast-attacking characters will destroy them with ease.

Upon reaching 20% of her health, Signora will encase herself similarly to the [[Cryo Hypostasis]]. She will periodically attack the player with homing ice shards or bombarding the arena to generate Frosted Floor. {{Pyro}} reactions deal more damage to the icicle, but crimson butterflies will occasionally spawn around the area to imbue the player's next attack with a strong Pyro application, much like using [[Scarlet Quartz]] on [[Ancient Rime]]. After the icicle is destroyed, the Crimson Witch phase begins.

===Phase 2===
As with Childe's fight, a cutscene will occur and Signora will reposition herself in the middle of the arena, with the player(s) placed away. She will not attack unless the player moves up or strikes her first. In this phase, she begins utilizing {{Pyro}} attacks. The phase is similar to the previous one &mdash; Eyes of Frost will appear at the same locations as the Hearts of Flame and Sheer Cold is replaced with Blazing Heat. While the battlefield becomes wider, Signora's attacks also become more damaging and cover a greater range compared to the previous phase. Her whip attacks are also capable of destroying Geo constructs in a single hit if they connect.

Upon reaching 20% of her health (and not performing an attack) or if the fight has lasted too long while she is below 50% health, Signora will head towards the middle of the arena and transform herself into a blazing tornado as she moves around the arena, unleashing smaller tornadoes all over the room, one of which always targets the player. She cannot be attacked in this state and the player will need to wait for the attack to conclude before she can be harmed again. While Signora is using this attack, it is advisable to stand next to an Eye of Frost to prevent Blazing Heat from accumulating. If the player is shielded, they can simply tank the incoming tornadoes; otherwise, reduce its health to a low amount before destroying it to remove all Burnt Floor effects nearby.

==Boss Description==
{{Description|[[Signora]], the Eighth of the [[Fatui Harbingers]].<br>Unlike other [[Fatui]] who use the authority granted by [[Delusion]]s, her Delusion is meant to shackle a flame that will devour everything. As opposed to a weapon used to kill, it might be more fitting to consider this a tool of imprisonment.<br>And it was the embers of that flame, which had accumulated over many long years, that would break through the frosty seal of the Delusion and apply a warped rouge upon her.<br><br>The crimson dawn was reflected in her pupils, and at last, she unfolded her flaming wings and flew towards the light.<br>''"But that light is not the dawn, dear Rosalyne. That is a sea of flame that will consume everything."''<br>[[Rostam|A voice]] spoke to her amidst the light.<br><br>Yet it mattered not, for she knew in her heart that the flames had devoured her long ago.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* It was not until this boss fight that the historical figure Crimson Witch of Flames was revealed to be [[Signora]].
** After the transformation of second phase, she is titled "Crimson Witch of Embers" instead of "Crimson Witch of Flames," which suits her current persona.

===Known Issues===
* In [[Co-Op Mode]], after La Signora is defeated in her "Crimson Witch of Embers" phase and the player respawns, Blazing Heat will still accumulate.
** If the player dies to Blazing Heat, they will return to the front of the door if they haven't claimed the Trounce Blossom.
