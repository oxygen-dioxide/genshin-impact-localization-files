'''Subareas''' are smaller locations within a particular [[area]] of a [[region]]. They include [[Main City|cities]], towns, ruins, and geographic areas, and are displayed on the map after zooming in past the area level. The name of the subarea will appear on the screen when the player enters the subarea, with a few exceptions.
