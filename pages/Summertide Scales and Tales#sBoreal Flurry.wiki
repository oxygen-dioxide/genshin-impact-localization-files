==Tutorial==
{{Tutorial
|image1 = Tutorial Summertide Scales and Tales Boreal Flurry 1.png
|text1  = In the Boreal Flurry game mode, you will have to move and shoot various targets to score points. Locked-on targets will be {{Color|help|marked out}}, and if you crash directly into targets, a certain amount of points will be deducted.<br>Shooting will consume energy, and energy recovers gradually, so take care and control your shots!
|image2 = Tutorial Summertide Scales and Tales Boreal Flurry 2.png
|text2  = In this game mode, you can use {{Color|help|two different buttons}} to use two different firing modes:<br>1. Speedy Shots: When held, you can fire continuously.<br>2. Charged Shots: After charging by holding for some time, release to unleash. Fortified Floater Targets can only be destroyed by these shots.
|image3 = Tutorial Summertide Scales and Tales Boreal Flurry 3.png
|text3  = {{Color|help|Slime Supreme}} targets can take many hits, and they will change after each time they are hit, making them difficult foes indeed.<br>Use Speedy Shots to deal with them effectively.
|image4 = Tutorial Summertide Scales and Tales Boreal Flurry 4.png
|text4  = {{Color|help|Explosive Targets}} might appear along the streaming currents, and they will detonate when hit. This can help you quickly destroy targets within a certain area.
|image5 = Tutorial Summertide Scales and Tales Boreal Flurry 5.png
|text5  = {{Color|help|Shot Enhancements}} may appear along the streaming currents. When you pick them up, you can increase the rate of fire for Speedy Shots, and you will not consume energy when shooting while buffed.
