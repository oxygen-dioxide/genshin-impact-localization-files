==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hiratsuka:''' Hello, are you also coming for work here at the [[Yashiro Commission]]?
:{{DIcon}} You are...
::'''Hiratsuka:''' I'm a staff member at the Yae Publishing House. I'm here to give a budget report.
::'''Hiratsuka:''' I'm not certain if it is because of slumps in other industries, but there are more and more new authors sending their work to Yae Publishing House...
::'''Hiratsuka:''' Well, it's a good thing that the publishing industry is booming, but my work is getting busier.
::'''Hiratsuka:''' If this keeps on going, I won't even have time to visit the [[Kamisato Clan]] to chitchat with people...
::{{DIcon}} What's your job like?
:::'''Hiratsuka:''' My job... it's generally to monitor the content and sales of newly published books each month.
:::'''Hiratsuka:''' Don't assume that it's some easy job. I need to gather various data and come up with operation recommendations for Yae Publishing House's publishing strategy...
:::'''Hiratsuka:''' But our boss doesn't seem to care about these things. Regardless of the profits, the boss only cares about doing things her way...
:::'''Hiratsuka:''' I guess that's just the confidence she has as the [[Yae Miko|Lady Guuji]]...
::{{DIcon}} Chitchat?
:::'''Hiratsuka:''' Well, when I come to the Kamisato Clan to meet someone or work, I will take some time to chat with people. It's a good idea to do some networking, after all.
:::'''Hiratsuka:''' So I will sometimes hear about stories in the Kamisato Clan.
:::'''Hiratsuka:''' I've heard that [[Thoma]] gets nervous whenever he sees [[Kamisato Ayato|the Commissioner]], and that's because the Commissioner often ropes him {{sic|in into}} eating some strange stuff...
:::'''Hiratsuka:''' I really didn't expect the efficient and resolute Commissioner to have such a side to him...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Hiratsuka:''' Yeah, I should probably get back to work as well...
