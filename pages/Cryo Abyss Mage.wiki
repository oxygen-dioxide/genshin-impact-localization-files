==Abilities and Attacks==
''Most attack names are unofficial.''
{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Frozen Shield
|desc_1 = Upon initiating combat, the Cryo Abyss Mage immediately gains a {{Color|Cryo|[[Frozen#Frozen Element|Frozen]]}} [[Shield]], protecting it from damage. The shield takes damage from certain [[Elemental Reactions]] and [[Poise Damage]] and suffers additional damage based on the strength of the attacks it receives. {{Pyro}} is most effective against the shield.
{{Elemental Shield Data|Cryo|12}}

|name_2 = Cryo Thorns
|desc_2 = Shoots an ice projectile at the target, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}
|file_2 = Cryo Abyss Mage Normal Attack

|name_3 = Special Attack: Frostdrift Offering
|desc_3 = Drops an icicle from directly above the target 3 times, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}}.
|file_3 = Cryo Abyss Mage Special Attack

|name_4 = Teleportation
|desc_4 = If the target is too far from the mage, it clutches its mask and teleports directly in front of the target, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}} at its location upon reappearance. The mage can also teleport away from the player to avoid attacks when vulnerable.

|name_5 = Rimestorm Rite
|desc_5 = If the mage is left alone after its shield is destroyed, summons 2 rings of icicles that revolve around it similar to [[Kaeya]]'s [[Glacial Waltz]]. Icicles deal '''70% ATK''' as {{Color|Cryo DMG}} and launch targets upon contact. During this attack, the mage's [[Interruption Resistance]] is increased. If the mage is not staggered or defeated within 10 seconds, it regains a Frozen Shield, dealing '''150% ATK''' and '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}}.

|name_6 = Water Freeze
|desc_6 = Due to their elemental powers, the Cryo Abyss Mage will freeze [[water]] they touch or hover over. This does not protect them from drowning in deep water if {{Pyro}} attacks are used to melt the ice underneath them.

|name_7 = Enhancement
|desc_7 = Certain enhanced Cryo Abyss Mages can be found in certain [[Domains]], [[Spiral Abyss]], overworld events and challenges. There are 3 possible types of enhancements: Attack, Shield, and Teleportation.
* '''Attack Enhancement:''' While using '''Icicle Rain''', each icicle will leave behind a frozen mist dealing '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Cryo DoT}} every '''0.5''' seconds. The frozen mist lasts for '''20''' seconds.
* '''Shield Enhancement:''' The '''Frozen Shield''' becomes twice as durable. When a character's attack hits the shield, 1 [[gauge unit]] of Cryo will be applied to the character.
* '''Teleportation Enhancement:''' While teleporting, deals '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}} at its location upon disappearance.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|Abyss creatures that call upon Cryo in battle. Though they dabble with great power and can even create icicles by condensing and freezing water vapor in the atmosphere, their bodies are very vulnerable in and of themselves. Once their protective barrier has been broken, they are at your mercy.|[[Archive]]}}
