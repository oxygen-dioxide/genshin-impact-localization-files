|description  = A treasure box with a decorative pattern at the bottom. The ornamentation seems to be a part of a three-piece motif. Once the pattern is completed, a certain door may open.
"I yearn for those frosty skies to stand in flames and burn till there's no living soul in the world."

"I yearn for us to turn to dust carried by the wind so that we can find that [[Imunlaukr|outsider]] who abandoned the [[Princess of Sal Vindagnyr|princess]]."

"I yearn for the [[Durin|black dragon]] from the princess' dreams to engulf the land in a cloud of scarlet poison."

"For I am the last one. There's no need to keep watch any longer."

"I've heard of people who are building [[Khaenri'ah|a new nation without gods]]. Perhaps they'll have the power to stand against this world."

The '''Scribe's Box''' is one of three boxes discovered in the [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] [[Dragonspine's Last Trio]], alongside the [[Priest's Box]] and the [[Princess's Box]]. The three boxes are used to unlock the [[Secret Room|Secret Room Gate]], which will also remove all three boxes from the player's Inventory.

It is found in a [[Luxurious Chest]] that will appear upon offering {{Item|Cecilia|20|x=3}} at the Stone Monument west of [[Starglow Cavern]]'s [[Teleport Waypoint]].
