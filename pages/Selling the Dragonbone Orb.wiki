===With Wind Comes Glory===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Marjorie:''' Welcome. Every treasure here is unique, so we don't negotiate on the price, nor do we give refunds.
:{{DIcon|Reward}} I've got some treasure I want to sell.
::'''Marjorie:''' You want to sell treasure? That's quite a surprise.
::'''Marjorie:''' I imagine that an adventurer as skilled as you must have some truly rare goods to sell.
::'''Marjorie:''' Let me have a look.
::
::'''You tell Marjorie about the Dragonbone Orb.'''
::
::'''Marjorie:''' Huh, isn't this what the bards called the "Fretnaught Fruit"?
::'''Marjorie:''' To think that it really exists... So its real name is the Dragonbone Orb.
::'''Marjorie:''' If its effects are as you say, I'd be willing to pay 80,000 Mora and some specialty dishes for it.
::'''Marjorie:''' Hmm... How does 80,000 Mora and 5 [[Moon Pie]]s sounds to you?
::{{DIcon}} ...What will you use it for?
:::'''Marjorie:''' Hehe. I mean, it's such a unique treasure.
:::'''Marjorie:''' Why, it has abilities straight out of a fairy tale! I doubt those alchemists would be loath to part with their Mora.
::;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
::{{DIcon}} A fair price. Done.
:::'''Marjorie:''' I'll take this, then. Thanks for your patronage!
:::'''Marjorie:''' Ah yes. Such beads formed from condensation tend to evaporate slowly in the wind.
:::'''Marjorie:''' As such, it might be best to cover it with a diaphragm or place it within a sealed container to ensure its quality.
:::'''Marjorie:''' I'll give you this tip free of charge. Hopefully, it'll be of some use to you in your adventures.
:::'''Marjorie:''' If you encounter such treasures in the future, always remember that you'll have a loyal buyer in me!
::;(The orb is sold)
::{{DIcon}} Let me think about it a bit more.
:::'''Marjorie:''' Sure, no problem. Nonetheless, I have confidence in my estimation of this item's value.
:::'''Marjorie:''' You can come to me again once you've mulled the matter over.
::;(Dialogue exits without selling the orb)

;(Talk to Marjorie again)
:'''Marjorie:''' Welcome. Every treasure here is unique, so we don't negotiate on the price, nor do we give refunds.
:{{DIcon|Reward}} About the Dragonbone Orb...
::'''Marjorie:''' How about it? Told you that my price was the best, hehe!
::'''Marjorie:''' If you sell it to me, my price is 80,000 Mora and 5 Moon Pies. Sounds reasonable, yes?
::{{DIcon}} It's yours.
:::'''Marjorie:''' I'll take this, then. Thanks for your patronage!
:::'''Marjorie:''' Ah yes. Such beads formed from condensation tend to evaporate slowly in the wind.
:::'''Marjorie:''' As such, it might be best to cover it with a diaphragm or place it within a sealed container to ensure its quality.
:::'''Marjorie:''' I'll give you this tip free of charge. Hopefully, it'll be of some use to you in your adventures.
:::'''Marjorie:''' If you encounter such treasures in the future, always remember that you'll have a loyal buyer in me!
::;(The orb is sold)
::{{DIcon}} Let me think about it one more time.
:::'''Marjorie:''' Sure, aren't you the careful sort? Nonetheless, I have confidence in my estimation of this item's value.
:::'''Marjorie:''' You can come to me again once you've mulled the matter over.

===Xigu Antiques===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Linlang:''' Welcome to my humble shop! We have some new items in store, if you would be so kind as to take a look at them.
:{{DIcon|Reward}} I've got some treasure I want to sell.
::'''Linlang:''' Oh, what rare objects have you found this time? Let me have a look.
::
::'''You tell Linlang about the Dragonbone Orb.'''
::
::'''Linlang:''' If what you see is true, this is a truly amazing relic.
::'''Linlang:''' But from a cursory examination, I can't find anything evidently special about it. Perhaps it requires extensive use to show its qualities...
::'''Linlang:''' The way I see it, it does seem that the wondrous properties you ascribe to it might be a tad... exaggerated. Perhaps it was simply something entrusted to you by those who had failed in their task.
::'''Linlang:''' Don't take it to heart, though. I'm just saying what's coming to my mind.
::'''Linlang:''' This is quite the common occurrence in our line of work, anyway.
::'''Linlang:''' Also, I believe that you did not keep this in sealed storage — it does seem like there is some wear and tear on its surface already.
::'''Linlang:''' I'm afraid that there will be some price reduction on that front, too.
::'''Linlang:''' How does 80,000 Mora sound? I can add 5 [[Bountiful Year]]s on as specialty dishes as well.
::'''Linlang:''' I believe that this is a good price.
::{{DIcon}} ...What will you use it for?
:::'''Linlang:''' To be honest, I would consider the story behind it more valuable than its capabilities.
:::'''Linlang:''' I suspect that this might be of much interest to our storytellers and opera troupes, or perhaps the great men and women of Yujing Terrace.
:::'''Linlang:''' It would be quite the ancient showpiece of a relic even if I were to simply mount it on our shop counter.
::;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
::{{DIcon}} A fair price. Done.
:::'''Linlang:''' My, that's quite forward of you. Well then, here's you Mora.
:::'''Linlang:''' If you should find any other such treasures, we are always awaiting your patronage.
::;(The orb is sold)
::{{DIcon}} Let me think about it a bit more.
:::'''Linlang:''' No problem. After all, you should always check the goods — I mean, the prices — when you're planning to sell precious relics.
:::'''Linlang:''' You can come to me again once you've mulled the matter over.
::;(Dialogue exits without selling the orb)

;(Talk to Linlang again)
:'''Linlang:''' Welcome to my humble shop! We have some new items in store, if you would be so kind as to take a look at them.
:{{DIcon|Reward}} About the Dragonbone Orb...
::'''Linlang:''' Oh, have you considered your options?
::'''Linlang:''' I'll take that item for 80,000 Mora and 5 Bountiful Years.
::{{DIcon}} It's yours.
:::'''Linlang:''' Thank you for your patronage. Here's your Mora.
:::'''Linlang:''' If you should find any other such treasures, we are always awaiting your patronage.
::;(The orb is sold)
::{{DIcon}} Let me think about it one more time.
:::'''Linlang:''' No problem. After all, you should always check the prices on the market when you're planning to sell precious relics.

===Netsuke no Gen Crafts===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' Hello, see anything you like? If you can't find the right one, I can have one custom-made for you.
:{{DIcon|Reward}} I've got some treasure I want to sell.
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' Eh? Well, to tell you the truth, we've managed to restore a regular supply of goods, and we don't really make collecting odds and ends a habit, in any case...
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' But just from looking at you, I think it's safe to assume that it's something most interesting indeed.
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' Well... Why don't you let me have a look at it, then?
::
::'''You tell Mikoshi Genichirou about the Dragonbone Orb.'''
::
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' Hmm...
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:'''  I'll be honest with you. While this is quite the curious tale, it does seem a bit too out there...
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:'''  This object falls somewhat outside my area of expertise.
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:'''  Please, don't scoff. I am but a mere craftsman myself...
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' How about this, then? 80,000 and 5 [[Sashimi Platter]]s. Those dishes aren't cheap by any means, mind you.
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:'''  If you agree to this price, I will buy this treasure.
::{{DIcon}} ...What will you use it for?
:::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:'''  I'm not sure at the moment. I'll need to give it some thought.
:::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' If the situation is right, I might be able to modify this into a special netsuke and sell it for a decent price.
::;(Dialogue returns to option selection)
::{{DIcon}} A fair price. Done.
:::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' In that case, please take this Mora. As for me, I'm going to go look into this item.
::;(The orb is sold)
::{{DIcon}} Let me think about it a bit more.
:::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' Fair enough. I need to give this a little thought myself.
:::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' You can come to me again once you've thought things over.

:{{DIcon|Reward}} About the Dragonbone Orb...
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' Have you decided to sell me the Dragonbone Orb, then?
::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' The price is the same as before. 80,000 Mora and 5 Sashimi Platters.
::{{DIcon}} It's yours.
:::'''Mikoshi Genichirou:''' In that case, please take this Mora. As for me, I'm going to go look into this item.
