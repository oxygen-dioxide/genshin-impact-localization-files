'''''O Archon, Hear Me!''''' is a [[Daily Commission]] that occurs at [[Inazuma City]], [[Inazuma]].

==Steps==
#Talk to [[Shouta]]
#Talk to [[Yayoi Nanatsuki]]
#Help Shouta place offerings at the shrine

==Gameplay Notes==
* Choosing the [[Tricolor Dango]] option will cause an investigation spot appear next to the shrine exactly 24 hours in real-time day after completing this commission.
** The investigation spot does not spawn upon daily reset.
** Interacting with it is not required for unlocking the follow-up commission, [[O Shrine, Show Your Power Once Again!]]
** Interacting with it gives the following dialogue:
**:'''"Mysterious item in front of the shrine":''' There's a mysterious item inside the box. It seems like a present from the [[Archons]]. Maybe it has some peculiar effects?
** Despite the text indicating otherwise, no items are gained from interacting with the spot.
** The investigation spot disappears the following day if it is not interacted with.
** The investigation spot will exist even if the same commission is received consecutively the following day, and completing any steps of the new commission will not affect the investigation spot from the previous day's commission. The investigation spot disappears after interacting.
* The follow-up commission, [[O Shrine, Show Your Power Once Again!]], is not a guaranteed follow-up commission, even if the investigation point is interacted with. O Shrine is only added to the commission pool.
** [[O Archon, Hear Me!/Change History|"O Archon]].." can be received again even after completing [[O Shrine, Show Your Power Once Again!|"O Shrine..."]].

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Something seems to be bothering a boy named Shouta...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Shouta:''' Lacquerware... how do you make those...
:{{DIcon}} Why do you need lacquerware?
:'''Shouta:''' Oh, it's you, big {{MC|bro|sis|mc=1}}. So here's the thing. Have you ever heard of a shrine's divine intervention?
:'''Shouta:''' From what I've heard, if you give precious offerings to the shrine, maybe your wishes will come true.
:'''Shouta:''' I think that pretty lacquerware is very valuable. If I used those as offerings to the shrine, then I'd be sure to get a reply.
:'''Shouta:''' However, I don't have money to buy any lacquerware. That's why I want to make one for myself.
:'''Shouta:''' I heard that [[Nanatsuki]] from [[Yayoi Lacquerware]] is very good at making them...
:'''Shouta:''' Could you go ask her about the lacquerware, big {{MC|bro|sis|mc=1}}?
:{{DIcon}} No problem. Let's go.
::'''Shouta:''' Thank you, big {{MC|bro|sis|mc=1}}!
:{{DIcon}} Not going yourself?
::'''Shouta:''' Nanatsuki is pretty serious most of the time. I don't have the guts to go ask for her help myself...
::'''Shouta:''' But if you're with me, big {{MC|bro|sis|mc=1}}, things will probably go better...
----
;(Talk to Nanatsuki)
:'''Yayoi Nanatsuki:''' Hello, is there anything I can help you with?
:'''Shouta:''' Uhh... so...
:{{DIcon}} So, he wants to ask about lacquerware...
:'''Yayoi Nanatsuki:''' Ah, so you want to offer lacquerwares to the shrine, and you want to make one yourself?
:'''Shouta:''' Please, Nanatsuki. I have a wish that I want to have fulfilled! That's why I... Don't worry, I won't tell anyone about your secret formula!
:'''Yayoi Nanatsuki:''' The issue is not the painting formula. If you want to make beautiful lacquerware, leaving the paint aside, you also need a long period of practice.
:'''Yayoi Nanatsuki:''' And this isn't just about time, it's more about... the capital. I am the fourth generation successor to a family of lacquerware-makers.
:'''Yayoi Nanatsuki:''' I even traveled to [[Sumeru]] to study lacquerwares. So it's impossible for you to grasp lacquerwares overnight.
:'''Shouta:''' Is... is that so? But I can't really think of anything else to offer to the shrine...
:'''Yayoi Nanatsuki:''' In my opinion, it's not about the value of the item being offered to the shrine. This item you offer should represent your feelings.
:'''Yayoi Nanatsuki:''' As long as you have the right feelings and intentions, and offer your favorite items, you should be able to get a response from the archons.
:'''Shouta:''' Right feelings and intentions... the things that I like...
:'''Shouta:''' Hmm, I think I get it... and I also don't. But thank you anyway, Nanatsuki.
:'''Shouta:''' Let's go back to the shrine first, big {{MC|bro|sis|mc=1}}. I still need your help with figuring out the kind of things I want to offer.
----
;(Head back to the shrine)
:'''Shouta:''' I mean, Nanatsuki said that I should, didn't she? But what should I offer, exactly...
:'''Shouta:''' Speaking of things that I like, it's gotta be Tricolor Dango. I love them so much...
:'''Shouta:''' But would it be disrespectful to offer Tricolor Dango? I offered Konpeito Candy before as well, but I got no reply.
:'''Shouta:''' I've also heard that some people will pack fresh petals into sachets and offer those. That sounds more appropriate than Dango.
:'''Shouta:''' What should we do? What do you think we should offer, big {{MC|bro|sis|mc=1}}?
:{{DIcon}} Let's go with Tricolor Dango.
::'''Shouta:''' Really? Okay! I happened to have brought one with me. My mom made it for me and I haven't even eaten it yet...
::'''Shouta:''' Let's offer it up, then!
:{{DIcon}} It's better to offer one of those sachets.
::'''Shouta:''' Okay. Let's go with your idea!
:{{Black Screen|''After you prepare everything with Shouta, he makes an offering at the shrine.''}}
:'''Shouta:''' O Archon, bless me and help my wishes come true.
:'''Shouta:''' Thank you for staying with me until now, big {{MC|bro|sis|mc=1}}. Please have these. They're for you!
:'''Shouta:''' I'll come back here tomorrow to check again. I hope that I'll receive a reply...
