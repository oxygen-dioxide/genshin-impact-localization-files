|text    = Maybe it's because I've been so busy lately, I've caught myself almost nodding off more often during the day...

The other secretaries at [[Yuehai Pavilion]] have been trying to get me to go fishing to take my mind off things. They say that fishing is the best way to overcome fatigue. It's just... I'm worried that sitting by the water doing nothing for hours will just make me even sleepier.

But one of my colleagues, who is a particularly experienced fisher, told me that I'd enjoy it more if I went with some friends. That way, we could pass the time chatting while we waited, and we'd get to witness each other's achievements in those nervous moments when we finally reeled in our catches... It actually sounds like something I'd really enjoy!

I've already prepared the snacks and bait! If you're free, would you like to come fishing with me?
