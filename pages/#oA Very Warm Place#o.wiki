{{Location Intro|description=<p>{{If Self|"A Very Warm Place"|It|"A Very Warm Place"}} is the location of [[Elynas (NPC)|Elynas]]' heart, hence the warm temperature. When the [[Traveler]] first encounters it, the heart is in a dormant state, covered in a layer of crystallized stone.</p>}}

During the events of ''[[Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic Dog]]'', [[Jakob]] uses [[Abyss]]al power to temporarily reverse the crystallization in order to obtain Elynas' blood, but the Traveler causes it to recrystallize. Elynas thanks them for this, because if he were to be revived, the movement of his organs would destroy the [[Melusine]]s' home within his body.
