{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Xiangjun)
:'''???:''' Grandpa...
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm? Hey there, kiddo, what are you doing out here at night? What's your name?
:'''Xiangjun:''' I'm Xiangjun... I'm looking for my Grandpa... He was kidnapped by demons...
:'''Paimon:''' D&mdash;Demons? Here? What sort?
:'''Xiangjun:''' I... I don't know either... Grandpa said that they're in the mountains, so I shouldn't run around by myself... But it's been three days now, and he still isn't back from the mountains...
:{{DIcon}} He's just trying to scare you, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks so too... Did he say what he was doing in those mountains?
:'''Xiangjun:''' Grandpa's the village's herb gatherer. He found a divine plant recently, one that's said to only grow when watered with the blessed waters near Mt. Xuanlian.
:'''Xiangjun:''' So... Might he have bumped into some kind of demon guarding the water?
:'''Paimon:''' Don't worry too much, Xiangjun. Your Grandpa might've just encountered some minor trouble. But it's also getting really late &mdash; mind if we send you home first?
:'''Xiangjun:''' But I want to rescue him...
:{{DIcon}} We can help you.
:'''Xiangjun:''' Really?
:'''Paimon:''' That's right! But if you don't go home, you might cause your Grandpa even more trouble.
:'''Xiangjun:''' Ah, I... don't want to do that.
:'''Paimon:''' Then let us look for him while you stay home, alright? Let's get you back to your home first.
:'''Xiangjun:''' It's fine. I live in Qiaoying Village. I can head back myself.
:'''Xiangjun:''' But... could you go look for Grandpa immediately? I'm worried about him...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, we'll be fine. That said... do you know where exactly he went?
:'''Xiangjun:''' I only know that he went that way...
:{{DIcon}} In that case, that's where we'll start.
:'''Xiangjun:''' Thanks so much! I'll head back now. I won't cause you all any trouble... so I'll wait there for you!

;(After the cutscene)
:'''Paimon:''' This should be the right way, {{Traveler}}. Let's keep our eyes peeled.

;(Approach the campsite)
:'''Paimon:''' Oh? There's a campsite here. Could this have been where Xiangjun's grandfather stayed for a while?
:'''Paimon:''' ...Let's see if we can find any clues nearby.

;(Interact with Someone's Notes)
:'''Someone's Notes:''' "I overslept! I have to get back before tomorrow, or no one's going to watch Xiangjun... Ah, I'm a fool...!"
:'''Someone's Notes:''' "If I remember right, there's a shortcut &mdash; a small road leading from Yaodie Valley to Mt. Xuanlian. Just need to get through that plus one mountain cave, and I should be golden..."
:'''Someone's Notes:''' "I've heard that there are monsters nearby, but I have to give this a shot..."
:'''Paimon:''' This looks like something that her grandpa might've left behind. Seems like he took a small trail &mdash; let's go look for it as well!
----
;(Enter the cavern)
:'''Paimon:''' We should be close... According to the notes, we should find a cave here.

;(Proceed deeper into the cavern)
:'''Paimon:''' We're in... This place really does have that... air of danger...

;(Interact with Someone's Notes)
:'''Someone's Notes:''' "...I was worried about monsters from the start, but..."
:'''Someone's Notes:''' "...So much... My thigh... Can't stop it..."
:'''Someone's Notes:''' "...So sleepy... But Mt. Xuanlian is just up ahead... Xiangjun, I'll definitely get those blessed waters..."
:'''Someone's Notes:''' "Xiangjun... I'll surely get those blessed waters..."
:'''Paimon:''' Oh no... He was attacked by monsters and was badly wounded in the process... Wait, and he still wants to get water from Mt. Xuanlian even so!?
:'''Paimon:''' Let's hurry &mdash; Paimon hopes we can help him!
----
;(Enter the cave near Mt. Xuanlian)
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm. This should be the place, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Why isn't anyone here? No trail to follow, either...
:{{DIcon}} Could he have gone back already?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't think that would happen. He's been injured &mdash; could he have walked far?
:{{DIcon}} But he's not around here either.
:'''Paimon:''' Could someone have met him on the road and rescued him? Paimon thinks that might have happened...
:'''Paimon:''' Shall we go back to Qiaoying Village and ask around?
:{{DIcon}} Let's get a bit of this "blessed water" first.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Oh, right. If Xiangjun's Grandpa was rescued, he might still need this.
:'''Paimon:''' In for a Mora, in for it all, eh? You're so thoughtful, {{Traveler}}.

;(Draw water from the pool)
:'''Paimon:''' "Blessed waters," Paimon's foot! These waters don't look special at all...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, right. We forgot to ask Xiangjun where she lives in Qiaoying Village... Let's go back there and ask around!
;(Obtain {{Item|Xuanlian Sacred Water}})
----
;(Talk to Uncle Luo)
:'''Uncle Luo:''' Ah, it's you, Traveler. You seem in a terrible hurry. Did some trouble come up?
:'''Paimon:''' We... Well, do you know where Xiangjun and her grandfather live, Uncle Luo? We're looking for them.
:'''Uncle Luo:''' Xiangjun? Never heard of her. Is she from around here? I'm sure I know everyone in the village...
:'''Paimon:''' Really? That can't be... We met a little girl outside who called herself Xiangjun, and said she lives in Qiaoying Village. She asked us to help her find her grandfather...
:'''Paimon:''' She also has a big bamboo raft!
:'''Uncle Luo:''' Well, you can find those quite easily, but Xiangjun... I'm fairly sure there's no one by that name in our village. What does her grandfather go by?
:{{DIcon}} He's an herb gatherer.
:'''Uncle Luo:''' A herb gatherer? Let me think. We did have one, so I recall... But it's been three years since he passed...
:'''Paimon:''' He passed away!?
:'''Uncle Luo:''' Aye. He encountered monsters in the wild and... *sigh* Still, I doubt that's who you're looking for.
:'''Uncle Luo:''' He was always a little off his rocker, and he never got married, never mind having descendants of any sort.
:'''Paimon:''' Wait... What's going on here? So, that Xiangjun we met...
:'''Paimon:''' ...Could she have been the real demon!?
:{{DIcon}} What sorts of herbs did your herb gatherer, well, gather?
:'''Uncle Luo:''' Flowers and grasses, none of which we've ever seen. 'Fraid I only know this and that about tea, so I'd be little help here...
:'''Uncle Luo:''' But I do remember that we found him near Mt. Xuanlian. He was still clutching a bottle of water.
:'''Uncle Luo:''' He said that he had a divine plant in his yard that needed that sort of blessed water to grow. Load of hogwash if you ask me &mdash; I mean, it's all just river water. Nothing special about it! Why'd he have to give up his life on account of something like that...
:'''Uncle Luo:''' *sigh* Still, after we buried him, we poured the water he obtained out in that yard of his. I hope that brought him some solace.
:'''Paimon:''' The blessed waters of Mt. Xuanlian? We went there and drew some water, too... So, this herb gatherer of yours...
:{{DIcon}} I think we're talking about the same person.
:'''Uncle Luo:''' Well, that's strange happenings, and no mistake... Why don't you come with me? I'll take you to that fellow's yard.
:'''Uncle Luo:''' If you did draw water, I suppose you can just pour it out in his yard.

;(While walking to the herb gatherer's house)
:'''Uncle Luo:''' Since we're already talking about it, I should probably add that we never really knew the name of that herb gatherer.
:'''Uncle Luo:''' He was an outsider, and we discovered that he was a bit... touched in the head the moment he arrived. He claimed that he'd picked divine herbs, but the pharmacy couldn't recognize them &mdash; much less buy them from him.
:'''Uncle Luo:''' But he had no other skills, and couldn't make the Mora needed to feed himself, so he had to knock on doors to ask for help. We took pity on him, and decided to feed him. His house was also built using Mora the villagers pooled together.
:'''Uncle Luo:''' Later, some ignorant children would call him an "[[adeptus]]" on account of his mutterings about "divine herbs."
:'''Uncle Luo:''' Not the "Capital-A Adepti" who dwell in the clouds, I mean. Just an "adeptus" who could help protect the village from disaster.
:'''Uncle Luo:''' No one expected something that terrible to happen to him afterward, but once it did, everyone thought that this must've been him repaying us by protecting the village!
:'''Uncle Luo:''' Everyone thanked him, and thus people have been reliably caring for his own home. We're almost there, by the way.

;(Approach the yard)
:'''Uncle Luo:''' This is the place. See that spot? That's where the divine herb seeds were buried.
:'''Uncle Luo:''' Just water 'em with the "blessed water," would you?

;(Talk to Uncle Luo)
:'''Uncle Luo:''' If there's nothing else, I'll leave you to look around as much as you'd like.
:'''Paimon:''' So there really wasn't anyone named Xiangjun...?
:'''Uncle Luo:''' I'll ask around. Maybe it was just a little mistake somewhere. Y'know, like someone forgetting where they live, and such.
:'''Uncle Luo:''' In any case, thanks for helping that "adeptus" water the herbs. I'm sure he'll do what he can to defend you from harm as thanks.

:'''"Pharmacy's Amelioration":''' "A few leagues to the east of Mt. Xuanlian is an earthen raft, that can float even without water. On the raft is a strange grass, with large leaves and roots like young children, its name is Xiangjun. Its sound is like that of an infant, and it travels with the raft, smiling when it sees people, and can ward off evil."
