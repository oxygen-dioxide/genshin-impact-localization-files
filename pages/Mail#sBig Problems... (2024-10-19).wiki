|text      = Huge progress! After practicing in secret for sooo many days, I finally learned how to sleep while standing! But... now I've got another big problem. I haven't figured out how to sleep with my eyes open yet. It's really hard...

I gotta come up with something. What if I just paint my eyes on my eyelids? Then, when I close my eyes, it'll look like I didn't, right?

I bought paint and brushes, but just when I was about to start... I found I had a really big problem, even bigger than the big problem! As soon as I close one eye, the other one can't hold on and shuts too!

But I won't give up on sleeping! At least until Muji-Muji Daruma manages to grow hands, you're my only hope! Please help me... paint... two eyes...

I'll be waiting... at the usual spot... standing... waiting for you...

Zzz...
