===Notice===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:From today, all work related to the [[Geode Mine Shaft]] has been suspended, and the connecting paths have been sealed.
:If you require one of the connecting paths to be opened for official Fortress business, you must operate the drive valve only under the supervision of a technical expert to prevent accidents.

:Drive Valve Operations and Safety Manual
:1. The drive valve can be used to rotate, open, and close the connecting paths for each area.
:2. The drive valve is controlled via both the Core Gear Drive (non-removable) and the {{color|buzzword|Gear Drivetrain (removable)}}.
:3. The non-removable Core Gear Drive controls the central room, while the Gear Drivetrain controls the direction of each connecting path.
:4. When operating, take note that {{color|buzzword|when the direction indicated by the Core Gear Drive is opposite to that indicated by the Gear Drivetrain, the path indicated by the Core Gear Drive will be opened}}.
:5. When all 4 Gear Drivetrains are uninstalled, the drive valve will automatically terminate operation.

:The display indications for opening each connecting path are as follows:

:{{color|buzzword|To Supply Warehouse 1}}
:[[File:Readable Rotation Device 1.png|200px]]

:{{color|buzzword|To the Geode Mine Shaft}}
:[[File:Readable Rotation Device 4.png|200px]]

:{{color|buzzword|To Energy Storage Warehouse}}
:[[File:Readable Rotation Device 5.png|200px]]

:{{color|buzzword|To Supply Warehouse 2}}
:[[File:Readable Rotation Device 3.png|200px]]

:Additionally, a new locking device has been deployed in the Geode Mine Shaft. To prevent operational mishaps, the research terminal's energy storage device has been temporarily removed.
:Unauthorized access by non-essential personnel is prohibited. Violators will be held responsible for their actions.

===Memo===
This is located on the desk in the room located after Storage Warehouse 1.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:[[Bulle Fruit]] Juice, [[Rainbow Rose]] distillate, [[Pluie Lotus]] distillate, Cinnamon, Honey, [[Tidalga]], [[Condessence Crystal]] Powder.
:Made [[Koblenz]] the guinea pig. He puked and got the runs, then was laid up in the infirmary for three whole days.
:I'm sure it's because Fontainian plants aren't healthy enough. I ought to replace the Rainbow Rose with [[Sumeru Rose]] and Pluie Lotus with [[Nilotpala Lotus]].

:Bulle Fruit Juice, Sumeru Rose distillate, Nilotpala Lotus distillate, Cinnamon, Honey, Tidalga, Condessence Crystal Powder.
:Koblenz refused point-blank to try again no matter what.
:Spent 280 Credit Coupons to get [[Delassaux]] to test the drink. Feedback wasn't bad. He said he felt quite perky after just one sip, so I'm on the right track. I can cut the Bulle Fruit Juice out, though, since it's little more than flavoring. Not like I'm making [[Fonta]], anyway.

:Sumeru Rose distillate, Nilotpala Lotus distillate, Tidalga, Ore Powder.
:The yellowish green ore outside looked better than Condessence Crystals... Got a small piece near the storehouse and ground it up to replace the Condessence Crystal Powder.
:Tried it, has a rich distinctive flavor. This wholesome healthy drink is sure to be a success this time.

===Training Log===
This interactable is located on the wall beside a punching bag in the hallway located after Supply Warehouse 2 in the Abandoned Production Zone.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:Day 137 in the Fortress of Meropide: Fifth Pankration Ring training match.
:Today's training match was a total nightmare. I embarrassed myself in front of everyone again...
:Blast that freak in the Blubberbeast fighting suit! I can't believe he slipped and used it to roll over and flip me! I hit the back of my head against the railing, and had to be carried out of the arena...
:Just what kinda luck does he have!? And what about my luck!?
:No! When you think about it, the reason there was water in the arena is because of poor maintenance of the pipelines! It was the maintenance staff who made me lose!
:Even if pipeline maintenance workers are just getting by, receiving their daily Credit Coupons salaries and calling it a day, they should at least do the job properly!
:...

:Day 192 in the Fortress of Meropide: Daily Training
:Today's Training Routine: 30 laps of weighted long-distance running, 50 sets of my weightlifting routine, 9 rounds of core exercises, and pummeling the punching bag with 999 crosses!
:Today's Meal: Barbeque Ribs, Lasagna, and Minty Bean Soup... Getting a little sick of it, but it's no biggie.
:Honestly, the food in the Fortress of Meropide doesn't taste that bad. If the cooks had just a bit more finesse, there wouldn't be much to complain about at all.
:They should add a few desserts, like iced Coffee Bavarois... Reckon it's called "Smeshnayan" or something... Anyway, the name doesn't matter!
:If they did, I'd be up for staying here for a few more years!
:...

:Day 208 in the Fortress of Meropide: Tenth Pankration Ring training match.
:It took all that to make it into the top 4, but the Credit Coupon prize couldn't even buy a Bird Egg!
:Though it wasn't like the day was completely wasted...
:Roussimoff smeared spicy sauce on his Garlic Baguette, took a few bites, and got KO'd by a stomachache.
:Rumor also has it that the guy would even catch a cold when hit by Cryo, gets disoriented by Pyro, and can even get heatstroke while in water that's not exposed to the sun...
:Guess he has weaknesses after all!
:Maybe he gave up on adapting to the elements and focused solely on raw strength instead.
:...

:Day 240 in the Fortress of Meropide: Daily training
:Today's Training Routine: 45 laps of weighted long-distance running, 65 sets of my weightlifting routine, 12 rounds of core exercises, and pummeling the punching bag with 1111 crosses!
:Today's Meal: Barbeque Ribs, Lasagna, and Minty Bean Soup... Same old, same old. But to pack on the muscle, I'll bear it.
:Sore muscles, can't bend over, and I'm out of Credit Coupons...
:I only signed up for the Pankration Ring to earn some Credit Coupons, but ended up spending them all on improving my diet...
:Is there something wrong with me?
:Not that I care, anyway!
:Since I've already put so much into it, the priority now is to win the training match title. Just have to hang on a little longer!
:...

==Puzzles==
===Multidirectional Connection Control Drive Valve===
{{Main|Multidirectional Connection Control Drive Valve}}
The Abandoned Production Zone's tunnels are controlled by the Multidirectional Connection Control Drive Valve, and the Notice explains the directions. The [[Gear Drivetrain]]s can be installed and removed in order to control its direction, as they turn alongside the main valve when they are installed. At least one Gear Drivetrain must be installed in order to run the valve. When a door is unlocked, a special animation will be displayed.

Additionally, the [[Energy Transfer Terminal]]s can be used to see inside each passage.

Leaving the area and returning will revert the valve to its original position. This could be because using the valve can obstruct the entrance to the location from the lift.

===Punching Bag===
A punching bag can be found in the hallway after Supply Warehouse 2. It can be activated by bringing an [[Energy Transfer Device]] from the Energy Storage Warehouse. Hitting it will spawn a [[Common Chest]] with {{Item|Credit Coupons|x=30}}. Paimon will comment on the punching bag when first approached.

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Paimon:''' What's the punching bag doing here? Did someone hide it?
