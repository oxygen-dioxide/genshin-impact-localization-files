==Fish Grilling Gameplay Overview==
A piece of firewood, a fish, a jar of seasoning... Okay Traveler, you're all set! You can start grilling the fish!
# Before grilling, select the type of fish you would like to grill! You can choose between Medaka, Golden Bass, and Bitter Pufferfish.<br />[[File:YBUS Tutorial 1.png|x120px]]
#* You can still re-select the fish before you start grilling. The selected fish species will also have a certain impact on the results of the grilled fish~
#* Regardless of which fish you choose, the same ingredients will be deducted each time: Fish ×1, Seasoning ×1, and Firewood ×1.
# After a countdown of 3 seconds, the grilling will begin! The fish you just selected will appear on the grill and start to cook!<br />[[File:YBUS Tutorial 2.png|x120px]]
#* Click the fish to flip it! The two sides of the fish will be calculated separately for the cooking, so flip it over to check on the cooking progress!<br />[[File:YBUS Tutorial 3.png|x120px]]
# While grilling the fish, you can also season it. When dragging the seasoning jar on the right side of the grill, the seasoning scale bar will appear on the interface, from left to right: light, moderate, and heavy.<br />Drag the seasoning jar to the scale of the flavor you want to complete the seasoning!<br />[[File:YBUS Tutorial 4.jpg|x120px]]
#* You can only season the fish once per grilling! However, the grill will temporarily stop heating while seasoning is in progress.
# Quick reminder: You can also judge the current doneness of the grilled fish by the smoke coming from the fish! If both sides of the fish are not cooked, white smoke will continue to appear~ But if one side is burnt, black smoke will begin to appear!<br />When both sides of the fish are grilled perfectly, it will look like the picture below:<br />[[File:YBUS Tutorial 5.png|x120px]]
# When you feel that the fish is almost done, just click on the "The grilled fish is ready!" button to complete grilling and obtain your grilled fish!<br />[[File:YBUS Tutorial 6.jpg|x120px]]
#* Different levels of doneness and seasoning can result in different flavors of grilled fish. The different grilled fish flavors also increase your friendship with Shiki Taishou in varying amounts and you receive different rewards for unlocking different archives.
#* Travelers, if you want to unlock new grilled fish archives, try different grilling techniques!
