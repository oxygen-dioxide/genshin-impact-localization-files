{{Description|Originally designed to hold drinking water, this cup was stained black after a scholar used it to wash their paint brushes.}}
'''Scholar's Ink Cup''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Scholar]].

==Description==
A delicate tea cup that belonged to a scholar. This treasured cup is made of light porcelain and gilded with gold stripes.<br />The dainty cup was in stark contrast with the messy room in which it was found, but seemed to suggest that the scholar was from a well-to-do family.<br />Not caring about the beauty and purpose of the tea cup, the scholar in her ivory tower dipped her quill pen in it.<br />She only saw it as a convenient ware to wash the tip. Now covered in ink stains, the cup has long since lost its former elegance.
