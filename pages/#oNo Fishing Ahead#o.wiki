|description    = This simple fence is crafted with [[Brightwood]] and vines, and has two triangular patterns on it. It is said that to maintain ecological balance, [[Forest Watchers]] once erected these fences around no-fishing zones. But only failing ecosystems require such protection, and those are rather rare in [[Sumeru]] nowadays. Therefore, these fences are treated as boundary markers most of the time.
