==Profile==
Haumia is [[Mavuika]]'s mother. She and Mavuika's sister [[Hine]] were present when Mavuika made the decision to die to be resurrected 500 years later.

Mavuika's family picture depicts two [[Yumkasaur]]s alongside Haumia and other family members,<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Echoes of Life}}</ref> and she states that Hine was an architect who helped rebuild the [[Scions of the Canopy]] tribe.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Past and Future}}</ref> Little information has survived to the present time about the fate of the family.
