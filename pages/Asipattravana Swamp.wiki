{{Location Intro|description=<p>Asipattravana Swamp is located in a thorn-filled canyon just north of [[Vourukasha Oasis]]. It is guarded by the Pari [[Mihir]], a "familiar of thorns."</p>}}

When the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] accompanied [[Sorush]] there in ''[[Asipattravana Itihasa]]'', it had been blanketed in a purple mist of [[Abyss|Abyssal]] origin. In an attempt to defend the swamp, Mihir had sealed herself and the source of the Abyssal energy behind a [[Gray Crystal|Gray Gate]]. The Traveler and Sorush helped to cleanse the defilement and free Mihir.
