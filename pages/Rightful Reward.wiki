==Gameplay Notes==
* The passive effect works with overhealing.
* Unequipping and re-equipping the weapon resets the passive effect's cooldown.

==Description==
Thieves are, after all, thieves, no matter how clever their tricks.<br>
Crimes must be publicly punished, and lies must be publicly exposed.<br>
That is how the world ought to operate, and how righteousness should be.<br>
But when it comes to "how things ought to be," it is always fiendishly difficult to get ideal results.

In her youth she fought with a young [[Emanuel Guillotin|swordsman]], but she was bewildered by his crafty eyes, and deceived by his intentionally slow rhythm,<br>
She finally revealed a critical weakness that she normally never would and her arm was struck by his blade, forcing her to concede that her spearmanship was inferior.<br>
She once thought to seek out that swordsman once again, and give it her all in a final duel, only to accidentally hear that he had long retired...<br>
Long had he hidden his face, wounded in the pursuit of public service, beneath a [[Veteran's Visage|mask]], and he had lost the frivolous, provocative voice and cadence he once had.<br>
Tired of all that the [[Marechaussee Phantom|Marechaussee Hunter]]s faced, he had turned to strong drink.

This was without doubt a betrayal of his past life, but the spear-wielder had to discover the truth behind the rumors for herself.<br>
And so, chasing the swordsman's footsteps and wounds, she pursued her fated opponent...<br>
Though someone dear were to fall upon the arena of fate, even if her heart were to be completely shattered,<br>
After following the trail to the mask left behind by the swordsman, all her trials and tribulations seemed to have been rewarded at last.

However, the end of that pursuit was most unexpected, and had nothing to do with the justice sought by the once-legendary Champion Duelist...

"Ah, the renowned [[Marfisa]] this time, is it...?"<br>
"Take heart. Your fine spear-arm will be of use."

"[[Narzissenkreuz|Master]]. This is already the second, [[Jakob|I'm]] afraid that the next..."

"I know."
