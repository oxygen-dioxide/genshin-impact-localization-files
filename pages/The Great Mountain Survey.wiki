{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to Esther)
:'''Esther:''' This is terrible... What am I going to do...
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
:'''Esther:''' It's my beacons! I've gone and left a whole load of them up on the mountain!
:'''Esther:''' There's no way I can continue my research now... *sigh* And after all the money I spent on them, too...
:{{DIcon}} What exactly happened?
:'''Esther:''' Well, I wanted to do some research into conditions on the mountain &mdash; the climate, the environment, and so on. So, I invested in an expensive set of survey beacons.
:'''Esther:''' Then, I scaled the mountain with a team of explorers. I was just putting the beacons in place when we were set upon by a huge group of monsters, they came out of nowhere...
:'''Esther:''' I didn't manage to grab them all before I left. The explorers insisted that we leave immediately.
:'''Esther:''' They also said they're not going back up there any time soon... But what about my beacons? The monsters will smash them to pieces!
:'''Esther:''' Can you go and collect them for me? Please, I promise they're very easy to find.
:{{DIcon}} Alright then...
:'''Esther:''' Thank you a thousand times over! No, a million times!
:{{DIcon}} What's in this for me?
:'''Esther:''' Oh, uh... a reward, of course! I'll make it worth your while, I swear...
:'''Esther:''' So, thanks in advance.

;(Talk to Esther again)
:'''Esther:''' There's no way this is enough beacons to survey the whole mountain...
----
;(Talk to Esther after retrieving the beacons)
:'''Esther:''' Did you find my beacons?
:{{DIcon}} I did indeed.
:'''Esther:''' Let me see... Yes, these are the ones, alright!
:'''Esther:''' Ugh, look at the state of them... Those monsters clearly weren't gentle with them. But thankfully, they're not completely ruined.
:'''Esther:''' *sigh* Still, I guess I won't be using them in the near future... Ah, can't be helped. I will have to make do with a smaller-scale survey...
:'''Esther:''' I have some other beacons here. Could you set them up on the mountain for me?
:{{DIcon}} Where exactly?
::'''Esther:''' ...Is that a yes? I'll take that as a yes! Thanks! I'll mark the spots on the map for you.
:{{DIcon}} Why can't you do it yourself?
::'''Esther:''' I don't dare... If not even a whole team of explorers could stand up to those monsters, I'm certainly not going back up there alone.
::'''Esther:''' I can't find any other explorers planning a trip up there at the moment, but I also can't delay this indefinitely.
::'''Esther:''' So, you're the only choice I've got. Seeing as you managed to fetch my beacons back so effortless last time, I think you're more than up to the task.
::'''Esther:''' Thanks once again. I'll be sure to compensate you well!
::'''Esther:''' Wait, let me mark the locations on the map for you...
:'''Esther:''' ...There. I've marked them all out. Just put the beacons in those general areas.
:'''Esther:''' Make sure to put them up in high spots. The higher the altitude, the more accurate the survey.

;(Talk to Esther again)
:'''Esther:''' This beacon is useless... So's this one...
----
{{Quest Description|update|You've helped Esther retrieve her lost survey beacons, but she once again requests your help in planting a new batch of beacons across the mountain...}}
;(Report back to Esther after placing new beacons)
:'''Esther:''' Are all the beacons in place?
:{{DIcon}} Yes.
:'''Esther:''' Wonderful, that is an enormous help. Take these &mdash; along with my thanks, once again, for everything.
:'''Esther:''' Ugh, with so few beacons for the survey, who knows if I'll be able to turn up anything of interest...
