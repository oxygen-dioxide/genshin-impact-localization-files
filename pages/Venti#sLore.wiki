{{Quote|A bard that seems to have arrived on some unknown wind &mdash; sometimes sings songs as old as the hills, and other times sings poems fresh and new.<br />Likes apples and lively places but is not a fan of [[cheese]] or anything sticky.<br />When using his Anemo power to control the wind, it often appears as feathers, as he's fond of that which appears light and breezy.|Description from the Official Website<ref>Official Genshin Impact Website: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/character/mondstadt?char=7 Venti]</ref>}}

==Personality==
{{Quote|One of the many bards of Mondstadt, who freely wanders the city's streets and alleys.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}
Venti has a somewhat recalcitrant, carefree, and playful attitude as well as a liking to rhyming in his speech. He sees a particular worth in music to the point where he names his lyre, saying, "every being deserves a name to be called upon, and woven into a song." He is also bold, not fearing to insult or ignore those who are supposedly powerful. In the game, he responds to Paimon's comments and nicknaming by parroting her.

Venti enjoys roaming around Mondstadt playing songs to his people, most of whom are unaware of his true identity as Barbatos. He is very well-liked due to his musical talent, having won the title "Most Popular Bard of Mondstadt" three times.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|That Green Fellow}}</ref> He is also an avid drinker of alcoholic beverages, such as [[Dandelion Wine]] and has an unusually high tolerance to alcohol. He is also fine with apple cider. To his disdain, the form he takes causes most bartenders to see him as a minor.

Being a god who is generally absent for prolonged periods of time, Venti has no personal finances; he often resorts to pilfering from the [[Dawn Winery]] for food and shamelessly has people listening to his songs buy him drinks in lieu of a payment. For reasons unknown, he is deathly allergic to cats and will not perform unless he is certain none are nearby.

He also enjoys apples, considering them to be the fruit of the gods, jokingly stating that he would refuse to go to [[Celestia]] even if he was invited because their apples are bland and the water foul, which would make bad cider. He dislikes items that are sticky and slimy, such as [[cheese]].

Despite his normally playful personality as the bard Venti, he speaks wisely and somewhat philosophically whenever he assumes his true identity due to the many experiences he had being one of the original members of [[The Seven]]. Compared to [[Zhongli]], the mortal vessel of [[Morax]], Venti does not mind revealing his identity and using his powers for various tasks.

For all his cheer and wisdom, Venti hides a lonely soul who, even millennia later, continues to feel strongly about the loss of the Bard whose form he imitates and even compares himself to "[[Stanley]]"; both took on the name and [[Nameless Bard|form]] of their deceased friend, and it is also implied in his Story Quest that his alcoholism is meant as a way to cope with his loss.

Venti also confesses to finding the Traveler's ability to discern what he's thinking as discomforting, but admits that he appreciates having a true friend, similar to how he views the Bard.

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3 paragraphs with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Venti appears as a young man with fair skin and a slim build. Similar to the Anemo element, his eyes are aqua green which also resembles the sky and the grass. He has dark blue hair that borders on black, with short twin braids that fade into aqua at the tips. The aqua tips glow neon when he uses his abilities. The form he currently takes is modeled after a deceased friend who perished to liberate Old Mondstadt. This appearance is used for his [[Statue of The Seven|Statues of the Seven]] around [[Mondstadt]] and the larger statue in the plaza in front of the [[Favonius Cathedral]].

He wears a frilly white top with a corset-like leather midsection, along with teal shorts with gold embroidery, a matching teal cape held together by a deep blue and gold bow. He also wears white stockings with three gold diamond shapes along each leg and a beret-like hat with a [[Cecilia]], which is his favorite flower. He carries a wooden lyre with blue strings and cecilias imbued with the power of Anemo. This wooden lyre is also called "Der Frühling", and it is the current lyre he carries since his other lyre "Der Himmel" is held by the Church. Because he is an Archon with an innate [[Gnosis]], the "[[Vision]]" on his hip is no more than "a glass ball [he carries] around to avoid suspicion."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Ending Note}}</ref> His outfit, [[Breezy Ode]], is described to be an outfit of a carefree bard.

But once he had a few [[Mora]] in the pot from his performance, you could be sure he would hurry off to spend it at the same place every time &mdash; one of the city's taverns.</p><p>Unfortunately for Venti, his childlike appearance meant that his attempts to acquire alcohol failed at every turn.</p><p>The first time he was refused service, he was heard grumbling: "I'm sure there were no such preposterous regulations last time I was here..." Once he realized that the same rule applied to all taverns in town, he decided he would have to change his approach...</p><p>The strategy he developed was drinking on the job &mdash; that is to say, playing the lyre while holding a wine cup in his mouth, urging his audience to buy him a drink from the bar if they liked his performances instead of giving him Mora.</p><p>The novelty of this made him quite popular in Mondstadt.</p><p>There was just one snag &mdash; he couldn't help but sneeze if a cat came close...</p><p>And if he happened to be holding a wine cup in his mouth when it happened... needless to say, it would spell disaster.</p><p>Venti, therefore, has one golden rule when selecting a spot to perform, and that is that there must be no cats in the vicinity.</p><p>Easier said than done &mdash; the stray cats of Mondstadt seem to be quite drawn to him.</p>

The wind's ceaseless howling ground the soil and the rock of that city into smooth, flowing dust.</p><p>The Lord of Wind who lived in his high tower was [[Decarabian]], God of Storms. He squinted from on high at his subjects, who bowed before him in the unceasing wind, and, believing them submissive, thought this good.</p><p>In those days, Venti was but a single thread of the thousand winds that roared through the northern lands.</p><p>He who would in latter days be known as "Barbatos" was but a tiny elemental spirit, without a shred of divine dignity, a breeze that brought subtle changes for the better, or tiny seeds of hope.</p><p>In Mondstadt of old, Venti met a [[Nameless Bard|young boy]]. This lad knew how to play the lyre, and longed to write the greatest poem of all.</p><p>"I do so wish to see the birds in flight."</p><p>So said the boy who had never seen the blue sky, eagles, or the green grass, his voice almost utterly drowned by the wind.</p><p>"Friend, will you not come along?"</p>

The Anemo Archon Barbatos felt power flowing at his fingertips.</p><p>His first use of this power was to reconstitute himself in the likeness of that young lad.</p><p>For only if he wore human shape could he play the lyre that the lad so loved.</p><p>Plucking its strings, he scattered the ice and snow and split the mountains with a divine wind.</p><p>He bade Mondstadt become a city of freedom, a nation without a king.</p><p>In future, he believed, it would become a better, more romantic city.</p><p>"Surely, he too would have wanted to live in such a place."</p><p>Thus, a new age began for Mondstadt.</p>

==Other Appearances==
===Manga===
Venti appears in the [[manga]]'s prologue chapter, [[Songs of the Wind]]. He awakens shortly before [[Ludi Harpastum]] and finds that Mondstadt has greatly changed from the last time he was present. He befriends [[Vennessa]] as Venti, and he reveals himself as Barbatos when Vennessa is sent to fight [[Ursa the Drake]], chasing off the beast before confronting the corrupt [[Lawrence Clan]]. Towards the end of the chapter, he can be seen accompanied by [[Aether]].

==Mail==
*[[Birthday/Venti]]

==Trivia==
* When Venti's Elemental Burst is ready, the green ornament on the back of his shawl will glow along with his Vision.
*Prior to completing Act III of the Prologue Chapter, his profile lists him as "Vision: Anemo". After completing the chapter, the entry is changed to "Gnosis: Anemo".
*Venti took on the [[Nameless Bard]]'s form (which remains his current appearance) after gaining his Archon powers.
**Due to residing in a vessel manifested through his Archon powers, Venti has a large amount of alcohol tolerance; he drinks at least 37 glasses of wine to no ill effect.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Master's Day Off (Quest)}}</ref> However, it didn't prevent him from being allergic to cats.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Margaret's Longing}}</ref> It is unknown whether this is particular to Venti's chosen vessel or not.
**Bows being Venti's weapon of choice may be in memory of [[Amos]], Decarabian's former lover who later sided with the Nameless Bard during the rebellion.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Amos' Bow|Description}}</ref> [[:File:Story Teaser The Boy and the Whirlwind｜Genshin Impact|The Boy and the Whirlwind]] implies that she, like the bard, died in the battle.
*While using his Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst, the ends of his braids light up a little.
*During the [[Unreconciled Stars]] event and [[The Crane Returns on the Wind]] Archon Quest, Venti's fake Vision does not glow when in close proximity to a meteor fragment or [[Starsplinter Iron]], unlike real Visions.
**However, when Venti's Elemental Burst is ready, the fake Vision will glow exactly like real ones.
*Venti is one of the few currently playable characters who acknowledges (or even seems aware) that the Traveler is from another world, presumably because of his status as an Archon.
* As Venti doesn't mind revealing his true identity as necessary, a large amount of people are aware of who he is despite having no "presence" in his own nation:
** The Traveler learns it when Venti declares it to his disciple [[Gotelinde]], though the nun simply thought that he was lying.
** [[Jean]] figured it out herself through her interactions with Venti and accidently calls him Barbatos before correcting herself in [[Diluc]]'s presence, although Diluc's lack of surprise may indicate he had also figured out the truth.
** "[[Stanley]]" is somewhat aware of his identity after he asked him to give his friend's soul to him through his Archon powers. He has since forgotten his name due to being drunk but remembers his general appearance.
** [[Mona]] may be aware of his identity as Barbatos; after being requested to check on him by the Traveler, upon examining her scryglass, an unusual amount of wind obscured it before starting to tear at her clothes, forcing her to abort as she proclaimed that she wouldn't look into him again.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Mona|About Venti}}</ref>
** Venti's fellow Archons are also aware of his appearance, as he had visited [[Zhongli]] on multiple occasions, met with [[Ei]] during a gathering of the gods and the [[Tsaritsa]] informing [[Signora]] and a number of other unknown [[Fatui]] about him.
** [[Xiao]] is aware that Venti is Barbatos, as he's aware that only a member of The Seven could handle his karmic debt and Barbatos frequently played musical instruments.
* The Steambird's [[The Steambird#Teyvat Food Notes|Teyvat Food Notes]] column, which are blog posts on the Chinese official site with real-life recipes for in-game [[food]] items, features Venti in the post for [[Northern Apple Stew]].<ref>HoYoverse News: [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/12502 Teyvat Food Notes - Apples are a Poet's Inspiration]</ref> Also in the post is a recipe for the cocktail Blizzard-Facing God's Apple Cider, which Venti drinks half his glass of as an "appetizer."
* Venti's attire resembles that of Cologne, Germany's Prince of {{w|Cologne Carnival|Carnival}}. They wear the same puffy shorts, white tights, short cape and a cap with feathers. Cologne's carnival closely resembles Mondstadt's Ludi Harpastum and Cologne is also dominated by a gothic Cathedral closely resembling Mondstadt's Cathedral.
* Venti bears a striking physical resemblance to [[w:c:honkaiimpact3:Wendy|Wendy]], The Herrscher of Wind in {{W|Honkai Impact 3rd}}, another one of HoYoverse's games.
* Venti's exchange with [[Paimon]] from Act II of [[For a Tomorrow Without Tears]] of her responding to his "Hehe" with "What do you mean 'hehe'?" has been alluded to twice in the story, thus far. Once during [[Date's Challenge]] with Date responding to Paimon with "What do you mean 'hehe'?!", and another as Paimon's response to the Traveler during [[Eight Locales Over Mountains and Seas: Two Cities' Recommendations]].
* Venti is known by these aliases or titles:
** Tone-Deaf Bard (by [[Paimon]])
* As of {{CurrentVersion}}, Venti is currently the only playable Archon to lack a second Story Quest in his chapter.

===NPC Mentions===
* According to [[Michelle]], Barbatos is a benevolent and hardworking Archon, which contradicts Venti's carefree personality.
* According to [[Sage]], Venti sometimes talks to animals.

===Furniture Mentions===
* [[Classical Lyre: Tenor of the Wind]]
* [[Mondstadt Mansion: Windward Manor]]
* [[Northern Stone Hearth]]
* [[Pure Spirit Banner]]
* [[Stone Lantern: Fudoumyou's Light]]
* [[Sub-Space Boulder: Verdant Peak]]

===Etymology===
*His name comes from the Latin word {{wt|ventus|''ventī''|Latin}}, meaning "winds." This name was also used by the Romans to refer to a group of Hellenic wind deities (known in Greek as the {{w|Anemoi}}) that were associated with the cardinal directions.
*His Archon name, Barbatos, is taken from the eighth demon in the {{w|The Lesser Key of Solomon#Ars Goetia|Ars Goetia}}. He is an earl and duke of Hell, ruling thirty legions of demons and has four kings as his companions to command his legions. He can speak to animals, can tell the future, conciliates friends and rulers, and can lead men to treasure hidden by the enchantment of magicians.
*His constellation, Carmen Dei, is Latin for "The Song of God."
*Venti's two lyres have German names. One is called Holy Lyre der Himmel, which is mixed English and German for "Holy Lyre of the Heavens", the other one is called Der Frühling, which is German for "The Spring." The former lyre is kept by the Church of Favonius, the second one is the lyre Venti's fake vision turns into when entering combat, summoning [[Dvalin]], and maybe playing a song.
* Considering Mondstadt is mostly based on Germany, Venti may be inspired by the Latin motto "''Videtis illam spirare libertatis auram''," meaning "See that the wind of freedom blows," by the German poet-laureate and humanist {{w|Ulrich von Hutten}} (1488–1523), with an intention to support the Lutheran Reformation. It was later translated into German as "''Die Luft der Freiheit weht''," meaning "The wind of freedom blows," which became the official motto of {{w|Stanford University}}.
