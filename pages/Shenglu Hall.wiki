{{Lang|'''Shenglu Hall'''|zh=盛露厅|zh_rm=Shènglù-tīng}} governs the glazed ceramics industry, one of the [[Eight Trades]] under the jurisdiction of the [[Liyue Qixing]].<ref name="Feiyun Bulletin">{{Ref/BB|Feiyun Slope Bulletin Board|Shenglu Hall Announcement}}</ref>

==Overview==
Most members of Shenglu Hall are descendants of the indigenous tribes who dwelt near [[The Chasm]] in ancient times. After the arrival of [[Morax]], the tribes went on to sign blood-pacts with the [[Yaksha]] and became allies of the God of Geo. They participated in the battles against [[Azhdaha]] and the monsters that surged during the [[cataclysm]]. Eventually, most of these tribespeople moved to [[Liyue Harbor]] and formed Shenglu Hall, specializing in glazed ceramics, which were an art passed down through the generations.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Jinwu}}</ref>

The closure of The Chasm was cause for great concern for Shenglu Hall, which relied on resources from the area to create their ceramics.
