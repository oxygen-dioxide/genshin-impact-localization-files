|description  = A [[Sayu|certain ever-somnolent member]] of the [[Shuumatsuban]] wrote this [[Fatui]] Code Sheet.<br />Reading it does not merely let you know that "these Fatui speak very oddly indeed" &mdash; you can also feel the recorder's intense lethargy penetrating the paper in the form of saliva.

==Text==
Fellow countrymen who've forgotten their homeland: Fatui self-identification.<br />
Hiking: conducting mission, on operation.<br />
Sunbathing: Lie low, take no action.<br />
Smash the plates: Attempt some bold action.<br />
Wash the dishes: To be exposed and captured.<br />
Clench the left hand: Take revenge.<br />
Clench the right hand: Make an alliance.<br />
Loosened the left hand: Betra{{Obf|y}}.<br />
Loosened the right hand: F{{Obf|or}}give.<br />
South Wind: Things going well.<br />
North Wind: Things {{Obf|no}}t going wel{{Obf|l}}.<br />
{{Obf|S}}un Crabs: The International Trade Association. Probably because they're not {{Obf|fro}}m Inazuma.<br />
{{Obf|General}} Crabs: The Kanjou {{Obf|Commi}}ssion. {{Obf|Probably}} because they {{Obf|serve}} under the Shogun.<br />
{{Obf|Pale Red}} Crabs: The Nobu{{Obf|shi}}. Because it {{Obf|looks}} {{Obf|like}} the Kaira{{Obf|gi}} colors.<br />
Iron {{Obf|Rats}}: The Shuumatsu{{Obf|ban}}. Ugh, calling us {{Obf|ra}}ts. {{Obf|So}} annoying! {{Obf|---- --}} annoying, it's {{Obf|------ -- ------}}.

(The words start out quite clear, but as time goes on, the handwriting becomes less and less legible, and there are clear signs of water smudging.)
