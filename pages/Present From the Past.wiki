{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Catch up to Xiangling in the ruins)
:{{A|vo xllq005 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Slow down! It's dangerous in here.
:{{A|vo xllq005 2 xiangling 01.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Ingredients don't stay fresh for long!
:{{A|vo xllq005 2 xiangling 02.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' We need to get going before they expire!
:{{A|vo xllq005 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeesh, she's quite the fighter...
:{{A|vo xllq005 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Seems foraging for ingredients takes more than just luck.

;(Defeating the [[Cryo Slime]]s)
:{{A|vo xllq005 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yikes! Look over there, {{Traveler}}! The icicles up ahead are falling!
:{{A|vo xllq005 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, let's be careful not to get hit... It will definitely hurt.

;(Upon reaching the Cryo Regisvine)
:{{A|vo xllq005 2 xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Aha, this must be it!
:{{A|vo xllq005 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's huge!
:{{A|vo xllq005 2 xiangling 04.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hee-hee, this is perfect! Come to me, my little treasure!
:{{A|vo xllq005 2 xiangling 05.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Whoa! My ingredients are attacking me!
:{{A|vo xllq005 2 xiangling 06.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' {{Traveler}}, help me put him in his place!

;(Defeating the Cryo Regisvine)
:{{A|vo xllq005 3 xiangling 01b.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' ♪ Got myself a Cryo Regisvine, cook it up for dinner time... ♪
:{{A|vo xllq005 3 paimon 01b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ♪ Even better if it's paired with a bit of swine... ♪
:{{DIcon}} Stop encouraging her!
::{{A|vo xllq005 3 xiangling 02a.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Lighten up a little! What in the world could bring more joy than finding rare ingredients?
:{{DIcon}} ♪ Wash 'em down with a glass of wine... ♪
::{{A|vo xllq005 3 xiangling 02b.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Hee-hee... Your version just ruins it.
:{{A|vo xllq005 3 xiangling 03.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Wait, there's something else here too!
:{{A|vo xllq005 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This must be the boar that [[Olaf|hunter]] was chasing.
:{{A|vo xllq005 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But Paimon's never seen one with this pattern before.
:{{A|vo xllq005 3 xiangling 04.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Where have I seen this before? Hmm... Aha! It was in the "[[Historia Naturalis Liyue]]"!
:{{A|vo xllq005 3 xiangling 05.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' This pattern is unmistakable. It belongs to a [[Snowboar|breed of boar]] that went extinct 300 years ago!
:{{A|vo xllq005 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow! How is this one still alive after so long!?
:{{DIcon}} Accidental cryopreservation?
::{{A|vo xllq005 3 paimon 05a.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Could be...
:{{DIcon}} Won the genetic lottery?
::{{A|vo xllq005 3 paimon 05b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's pretty sure that's not really possible...
:{{A|vo xllq005 3 xiangling 06.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' I read that this boar was hunted to extinction because its meat was so highly prized.
:{{A|vo xllq005 3 xiangling 07b.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Cryo Regisvine and extinct boar. Not one, but two priceless treasures!
:{{DIcon}} This'll be our winning ticket.
:{{A|vo xllq005 3 xiangling 08.ogg}} '''Xiangling:''' Right. Now let's get back to Springvale!

==Trivia==
* The three lines sung by Xiangling, Paimon, and the Traveler (after defeating the Cryo Regisvine) are localized in two different ways.
** In Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, the song follows a chant along the following lines:
**: '''Xiangling:''' "Cryo Regisvine, Cryo Regisvine, delicious Cryo Regisvine~"
**: '''Paimon:''' "Cryo Regisvine~"
**: '''{{Traveler}}:''' "Cryo Regisvine~"
** In English, Spanish, and French, the song follows a rhyme that describes a meal prep:
**: '''Xiangling:''' ♪ Got myself a Cryo Regisvine, cook it up for dinner time... ♪
**: '''Paimon:''' ♪ Even better if it's paired with a bit of swine... ♪
**: '''{{Traveler}}:''' ♪ Wash 'em down with a glass of wine... ♪
