<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->

::'''Karpillia:''' That's a Mondstadt specialty. It's not supposed to be in the inventory list. But since you're also an outlander like me, I will make an exception and sell you those.

:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Karpillia:''' Huh... How can this be? Did I make a mistake somewhere?
: {{DIcon}} About this shop...
::'''Karpillia:''' This shop is the exclusive seller of fine liquor from Mondstadt.
::'''Karpillia:''' Our ciders are all brewed from the purest water of [[Cider Lake]] and the freshest fruits from Mondstadt. We make sure that even here in Inazuma, our customers shall have the finest and most authentic Mondstadt drinks!
::'''Karpillia:''' So if you choose the finest liquor from Mondstadt, choose Sailing Breeze!
::{{DIcon}} How's business been?
:;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:::'''Karpillia:''' It's not bad. After all, liquor from Mondstadt is the best in Teyvat.
:::'''Karpillia:''' But the [[Sakoku Decree]] has really created some difficulty in the transportation of supplies. That's a headache...
:::'''Karpillia:''' I have no idea what will happen if we use local ingredients. Ugh...
:;(After completing Transient Dreams)
:::'''Karpillia:''' It's not bad. After all, liquor from Mondstadt is the best in Teyvat.
:::'''Karpillia:''' The moment the Sakoku Decree ended, I had clients coming up to me to place some orders. And what do you know &mdash; Mondstadt's Dandelion Wine was number one on the list!
:::'''Karpillia:''' Now that the thunderstorm surrounding Inazuma has dispersed, cargo-carrying ships should be able to get here quickly. Once that happens, never mind our clientele... I'll be able to get a good drink myself.
:::'''Karpillia:''' *cough* I mean, after work, of course!
::{{DIcon}} Would your liquor be better than the [[Dawn Winery]]'s?
:::'''Karpillia:''' Well, I'm sure we'd...
:::'''Karpillia:''' Ah, never mind. As a drinker myself, I can't go against my conscience in this matter.
:::'''Karpillia:''' I have to admit that Dawn Winery's drinks are better. Even I prefer them.
:::'''Karpillia:''' Our store was actually forced to sell here because we couldn't compete with Angel's Share.
:::'''Karpillia:''' But the businesses under Dawn Winery have practically monopolized the liquor industry in Mondstadt. I... don't really think that's a good thing.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
:: '''Karpillia:''' Goodbye! See you next time!
