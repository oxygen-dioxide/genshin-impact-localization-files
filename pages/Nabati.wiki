==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Nabati:''' Some research topic on folk beliefs... What's the point of that?
:{{DIcon}} What topic?
::'''Nabati:''' It's about the belief of [[Children of the Forest]] near [[Vimara Village]]...
::'''Nabati:''' According to my inference, it must be because wild vegetables grow luxuriantly here, and they were anthropomorphized... That's how the Children of the Forest came to be.
::'''Nabati:''' *sigh* Jokes aside, this topic is far less interesting than studying the human body...
::{{DIcon}} Studying the human body...?
::'''Nabati:''' Nah, it isn't as scary as you're thinking. It's just some extended topics on fighting techniques.
::'''Nabati:''' How must the body be controlled to release unimaginable strength? Aren't you all curious about that?
::'''Nabati:''' But while I've suggested it a few times, not a single mentor has been willing to approve it...
::'''Nabati:''' So, I had no choice but to comply with my assignment and research this topic related to folk beliefs...
::'''Nabati:''' I think this can't be allowed to go on. Someone must let the [[Akademiya]] know that there are many other research directions that are worth our attention.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} You can do it.
:::'''Nabati:''' Thanks for your encouragement. Knowing that there are still people who share my thoughts raises my confidence again.
:::'''Nabati:''' A researcher should have the courage and determination to speak their mind!
::;(Obtain [[Guide to Admonition]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} I have no idea.
::'''Nabati:''' What a coincidence, me neither.
