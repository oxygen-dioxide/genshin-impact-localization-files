'''Character Event Wishes''' are [[Wishes]] that have one promotional 5{{star}} [[character]] and three featured 4{{star}} characters. Both the promotional 5{{star}} and featured 4{{star}} items will have an increased probability for players to wish them when compared to the basic rates when the guarantees are factored in.

==Rates==
{|class="wikitable align-center"
!Item !! Base Rate !! Average Rate<br><small>(including Pity)</small>
|-
|5{{star}} Character
|0.6% || 1.6%
|-
|4{{star}} Character or Weapon
|5.1% || 13%
|-
|3{{star}} Weapon
|94.3% || 85.4%
|}

==Rules==
* '''4{{star}} drop guarantee:''' If a player does not obtain any 4{{star}} (or above) item within 9 wishes in a row, the 10th wish is ''guaranteed'' to be a 4{{star}} (or higher) item. (On guarantee, the probability of getting a 4{{star}} item is 99.4%, and the probability of getting a 5{{star}} item is 0.6%.)
** This counter will reset if the player obtains any 4{{star}} item.
* '''Featured 4{{star}} character guarantee:''' Every time a player obtains a 4{{star}} item, there is a 50% chance it will be one of the featured 4{{star}} characters.
** If the 4{{star}} item obtained is ''not'' one of the featured characters, then the next 4{{star}} item obtained is ''guaranteed'' to be one of the featured characters.
** Thus it requires a ''maximum'' of 20 wishes to obtain ''one of'' the featured 4{{star}} characters.
* '''5{{star}} drop guarantee:''' If a player does not obtain any 5{{star}} item after 89 wishes, the 90th wish is ''guaranteed'' to be a 5{{star}} item. (''On average'', a greater proportion of 5{{star}} items are dropped between 74 and 90 pity.)
** This counter will reset if the player obtains any 5{{star}} item.
** Character Event Wishes do not contain 5{{star}} weapons in their item pool, as such each 5{{star}} drop will be a character.
* '''Promotional 5{{star}} character guarantee:''' Every time a player obtains a 5{{star}} item, there is a 50% chance it will be the promotional 5{{star}} character.
** If the 5{{star}} item obtained is ''not'' the promotional character, the next 5{{star}} item is ''guaranteed'' to be the promotional character.
** Thus it requires a ''maximum'' of 180 wishes to guarantee obtaining ''the'' promotional 5{{star}} character.
* '''Counter and Guarantee carry-over:''' Each wish of the same ''type'' shares the above counters and guarantees, this means that the counters for the current Character Event Wish are carried over to the next Character Event Wish (but not the Weapon Event Wish or Wanderlust Invocation).
** For example, if one wishes 89 3/4{{star}} items on Character Event Wish A, then the ''first'' wish on the following promotional Character Event Wish B will be a guaranteed 5-star character.
** Likewise if one wished a non-promotional 5-star character on Character Event Wish A, then the next 5-star character on Character Event Wish B will be guaranteed to be the promotional character.

===Capturing Radiance===
* When the player pulls on "Character Event Wish" or "Character Event Wish-2," if a 5-star character is won but it is not guaranteed to be the promotional 5-star character during this event wish, there is a chance of triggering the "Capturing Radiance" mechanic.<ref>[HoYoverse News: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/125274 "Capturing Radiance" Mechanic: You Ask, I Answer!]</ref>
* After "Capturing Radiance" is triggered, the 5-star character won in this event wish will be the promotional 5-star character.
* Including the possibility of triggering "Capturing Radiance," when winning a 5-star character in the event wish, there is a consolidated probability of 55% it will be the promotional character.
* It doesn't affect the guarantees. The "Capturing Radiance" mechanic only triggers in cases where the "50/50" (i.e., not guaranteed to win the promotional 5-star character) applies. In simple terms, it increases the chance of directly obtaining the promotional 5-star character from a "50/50."
* The base probability of triggering "Capturing Radiance" is 0.018%.<!-- included in event wish details starting with 5.4 Mizuki and Sigewinne -->
* If the promotional 5-star character is the second 5-star character obtained on three consecutive occasions, then "Capturing Radiance" mechanic is guaranteed to be triggered when the next 5-star character is obtained.<!-- included in event wish details starting with 5.4 Mizuki and Sigewinne -->

==Character Event Wish-2==
'''Character Event Wish-2''' is an Event Wish that runs alongside Character Event Wish. It was originally released for previously released characters,<ref>HoYoverse News: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/17072 Character Event Wish-2 (New Type) Mechanics Description]</ref> but this criterion was later changed to allow new characters to appear on it.<ref>HoYoverse News: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/127690 Version 5.3 Event Wishes Notice - Phase I]<br>''※ Starting from this "Character Event Wish-2," both rerun 5-star characters and new 5-star characters may appear in "Character Event Wish-2."''</ref>

The wish guarantee count for "Character Event Wish" and "Character Event Wish-2" is shared, and is accumulated between both "Character Event Wish" and "Character Event Wish 2." This wish guarantee count is independent of the guarantee counts of other types of wishes. For example:
* 5-Star Items
*# If you fail to obtain a 5-star character after making 50 Wishes in "Character Event Wish" and continue to wish in "Character Event Wish-2," within a maximum of 40 Wishes made in "Character Event Wish-2," you will be guaranteed to obtain a 5-star character from "Character Event Wish-2."
*# If you obtain a 5-star character from "Character Event Wish" that is not the 5-star Promotional Character on "Character Event Wish" and continue to wish in "Character Event Wish-2," the next 5-star character will be guaranteed to be the 5-star Promotional Character from "Character Event Wish-2."
* 4-Star Items
*# If you fail to obtain a 4-star item after making 6 Wishes in "Character Event Wish" and continue to wish in "Character Event Wish-2," within a maximum of 4 Wishes made in "Character Event Wish-2," you will be guaranteed to obtain at least an item with a 4-star rating or above from "Character Event Wish-2."
*# If you obtain a 4-star item from "Character Event Wish" that is not one of the featured characters on "Character Event Wish" and continue to wish in "Character Event Wish-2," the next 4-star item will be guaranteed to be a 4-star featured character from "Character Event Wish-2."

The wish guarantee count between "Character Event Wish" and "Character Event Wish-2" is completely shared. Even after the end of this period's "Character Event Wish-2," the wish guarantee count will carry over for future Character Event Wishes and Character Event Wishes-2.
