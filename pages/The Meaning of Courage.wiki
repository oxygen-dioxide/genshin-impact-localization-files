{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the marked location)
:{{Black Screen|Chief [[Acatl]] gathers people from the tribe to hear Varesa's report on the mushrooms.}}
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 acatl 01.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' ...
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 atolli 01.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' ...
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 iansan 01.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' ...
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, so it felt pretty normal in the moment, but hearing it back does sound kind of... ridiculous.
:{{DIcon}} This silence speaks volumes...
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 acatl 02.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' So, the mushrooms in the orchard are sentient? What a remarkable discovery!
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 iansan 02.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Yeah, without your investigation, who knows what could have happened?
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 xoctli 01.ogg}} '''Xoctli:''' Thanks for looking into it, and for collecting all this information!
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Phew, what a relief... I was worried it sounded like I lost my marbles...
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 acatl 03.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Hahaha, it does sound far-fetched. After all, none of us have ever spoken to a mushroom.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 acatl 04.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' But, we know you're not one to lie, Varesa. Besides, the origin of the green mushrooms has always been a mystery to us.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 acatl 05.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Thanks to you, we now know something sinister could be going on. So, we should do our part to help!
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 iansan 03.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Yeah, just let me know if there's anything I can do!
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, that didn't take much convincing...
:{{DIcon}} Thank you, everyone.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 atolli 02.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' Oh, wait, you said the mushrooms need to be cooked on high heat, right? I can do that for you right now &mdash; I'll be quick.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 atolli 03.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' Alright, I'm back! I used cast iron, so it should be hot enough!
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, it smells delicious! Suddenly, Paimon's hungry again!
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' W&mdash;Well, here goes nothing...
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 bifrons 01.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait, that's his voice!
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 bifrons 02.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Hahaha, looks like you stumbled upon the right path, but this temperature does not demonstrate even a fraction of the sincerity I require.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 bifrons 03.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Did you really think some common stove could generate enough heat to earn the acknowledgement of the Sage-Lord?
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 bifrons 04.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Humans are such a disappointment. You can solve my riddles when the answers are handed to you on a silver platter...
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 bifrons 05.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' But, as soon as there are no more hints... not a shred of intelligence in sight.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 bifrons 06.ogg}} '''Sage-Lord of Fungi:''' Do try and use your brain this time, hehehe...
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 atolli 04.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' H&mdash;How did it go? Did you hear the voice?
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh! Annoying menace of a mushroom!
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The Sage-Lord of Fungi said the heat's still not high enough. Hmph, Sage-Lord of nitpicking, more like!
:{{DIcon}} Still, the only way to figure out his goal...
:{{DIcon}} Is to keep playing along.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 acatl 06.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Not high enough, huh... I guess that means we need a more powerful source of heat.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 acatl 07.ogg}} '''Acatl:''' Attention, everyone! We need items that can generate intense heat. Anything you can find!
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 atolli 05.ogg}} '''Atolli:''' I'll see what I can do.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 iansan 04.ogg}} '''Iansan:''' Leave it to me!
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' We should take a look, too.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Definitely! We're not super familiar with this area, though. Do you have any ideas?
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 varesa 04.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Hmm... Nothing concrete, but we could check around the [[Great Volcano of Tollan|volcano]].
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 varesa 05.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' It spews out all kinds of stuff. Maybe there's something we can use.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Awesome, let's go! Paimon's gonna find something scorching hot and then throw it at that stupid mushroom's face!
----
;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo vrslq004 2 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Hey, there should be some Avatars of Lava somewhere along this path...
:{{A|vo vrslq004 2 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Their cores are really hot. It might be just what we need.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Y'know, when you think about how everyone jumped to help us like that, it seems like your tribe has been suspicious of the green mushrooms for a while.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 2 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Yeah, but without you, we would have never gotten this far. I mean, tons of people have tried that mushroom without a weird voice talking in their head.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right... So, even if you wanted to investigate, you had nowhere to start...
:{{A|vo vrslq004 2 varesa 04.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Yeah, this opportunity was a long time coming! Plus, the Sage-Lord's arrogant attitude definitely triggered my tribe's competitive spirit.
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, competitions seem to be a thing here.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You don't seem competitive most of the time, though, Varesa.<ref group="Note">Actual voice-over: "Umm... Varesa doesn't seem competitive most of the time, though. "</ref> Outside of training and fighting monsters, at least...
:{{A|vo vrslq004 2 varesa 05.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Yeah, well... I don't really like fighting or competing, to be honest. Simple day-to-day happiness is what matters to me.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 2 varesa 06.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Still, I've learned a lot from Coach [[Iansan]]. She taught me that strength is a means rather than an end.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 2 varesa 07.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' We get stronger so we can use our strength when it counts &mdash; like during the [[Abyss]] invasion. Having the training to master my [[Vision]] meant that I could do something to stop it.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 2 varesa 08.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' So, no matter how scared I feel, I know I have to be brave, because people are counting on me.
:{{DIcon}} I can tell.
:{{DIcon}} There's a certain strength deep within you.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 2 varesa 09.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Thanks. It's a work in progress. I can only hope that, one day, I can be as brave as Lady [[Fietena|Fietena]].
:{{A|vo vrslq004 2 varesa 10.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Alright, we should keep looking.

;(Approach the ledge)
:{{A|vo vrslq004 3 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, looks like we can make this jump.

;(Approach the boulders)
:{{A|vo vrslq004 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh-oh, a falling rock!
:{{A|vo vrslq004 3 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' That Avatar of Lava pushed it down! C'mon, let's charge!
:{{A|vo vrslq004 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ch&mdash;Charge!?

;(Defeat the Avatar of Lava)
:{{A|vo vrslq004 4 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Done and dusted! This core should be perfect. Look! The [[phlogiston]] inside it is still active!
:[[File:The Meaning of Courage Ignited Seeing Eye.png|200px]]
:{{A|vo vrslq004 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, let's see... Whoa, hot!
:{{A|vo vrslq004 4 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' A few more chunks like this, and we should be good. C'mon, let's keep heading up.

;(Approach the enemies)
:{{A|vo vrslq004 5 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Careful! Three Avatars of Lava ahead!

;(Defeat the Avatars of Lava)
:{{A|vo vrslq004 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh no, not good! The volcano is acting up again!

;(After a while)
:{{A|vo vrslq004 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What is this? It looks like a giant [[Weasel Thief|weasel thief]]... Is there a "Great Tollan Weasel Thief" or something?
:{{A|vo vrslq004 5 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' We call it a "Furnace Shell Mountain Weasel"! It's very aggressive, so be careful!

;(Defeat the Furnace Shell Mountain Weasel)
:{{A|vo vrslq004 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What a great haul! A bunch of [[Ignited Seeing Eye|Seeing Eyes]] and [[Blazing Prismshell|this thing]] the weasel used to spew out fire!
:{{A|vo vrslq004 6 varesa 01.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' I think that's its back armor! It shoots out phlogiston, so it can pretty much attack from all directions.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 6 varesa 02.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' My dad told me about them once &mdash; creatures that live in the volcano. I can't believe we actually ran into one!
:{{A|vo vrslq004 6 varesa 03.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' This piece of armor might produce even higher temperatures than the Seeing Eyes. Hehe, we'll get those mushrooms super hot this time!
:{{DIcon}} Nice fighting back there, by the way.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 6 varesa 04.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh, well... Even though I don't like fighting, sometimes, you don't have a choice. So, I've tried to figure out a bunch of different ways to get myself in the zone.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 6 varesa 05.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' For example, I've read a lot of stories about heroes, and my favorite hero has always been Fietena &mdash; the one I mentioned before.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 6 varesa 06.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Fietena's most iconic feature was her mask, so I decided to make one just like hers.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 6 varesa 07.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' So, now, whenever I wear the mask, it's like there's a little piece of her with me. If I want to honor her legacy, I have no choice but to be brave.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 6 varesa 08.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' At the same time, though... I guess it's kind of like a crutch. Kind of like, I'm hiding behind her strength.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you really think so?
:{{DIcon}} But, it helps you, right?
:{{DIcon}} It's nothing to feel ashamed about.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 6 varesa 09.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Really? It's just...
:{{A|vo vrslq004 6 varesa 10.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' I feel like... I need to take it off one day and face things alone.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 6 varesa 11.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' But, the longer I put off taking that step, the more impossible it feels. I... don't know if I have it in me.
:{{DIcon}} But you were the one who decided to investigate this case.
:{{DIcon}} Not your mask.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, YOU had the courage to make that decision, and that's what adventuring is all about! Fighting is just a small part of it.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 6 varesa 12.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Oh...
:{{A|vo vrslq004 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Besides, Paimon thinks you're doing a great job! Just take your time &mdash; it's not a race.
:{{A|vo vrslq004 6 varesa 13.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Thanks for believing in me, you two. I've learned so much!
:{{A|vo vrslq004 6 varesa 14.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' And, I won't give up, not until I can face things on my own!
:{{A|vo vrslq004 6 varesa 15.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' Phew, after that pep talk, I feel like my appetite is back in full force!
:{{A|vo vrslq004 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're hungry already? Paimon hasn't even finished digesting her last meal!
:{{A|vo vrslq004 6 varesa 16.ogg}} '''Varesa:''' C'mon, let's head back to the tribe. We'll earn that mushroom's recognition this time, for sure!
