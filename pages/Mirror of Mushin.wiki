|description  = The mirror that was set in Shouki no Kami's chest to separate him from the outside world. The mitsudomoe symbol is emblazoned on it as a deliberate show of status and might.<br />This symbol, however, is no show of obeisance to the master of lightning, but is instead a blade pointed at the existing powers that be in this world. Nor is the mirror a means to shut out the looks of judgment from onlooking people, but is rather a bulwark against this base and sullied world. Within this great temple shall punishment be meted out and ignorance be cleansed.<br />Dreams shall be overturned, desires shall be cut away, and karma shall be reset.
