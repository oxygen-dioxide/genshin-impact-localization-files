====AI Logic====
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range and angle required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.

}}

==Strategy==
While Maguu Kenki's high mobility in its 2nd phase may hinder the player's ability to deal DMG, the following methods can be used to restrict it:
* The 2nd variant of the '''Shadowsword: Pseudo Tengu Sweeper''' attack, which teleports Maguu Kenki away from the player, is only triggered if the player attacks it while it is idle. The player can avoid this attack entirely by only attacking Maguu Kenki while it is already performing an attack. Additionally, deployed objects such as [[Guoba Attack|Guoba]] and [[Kamisato Art: Soumetsu|Frostflake Seki no To]] also will not trigger this attack.
* Domain barriers in the [[Spiral Abyss]] as well as Geo barriers created by [[Geo Traveler]]'s [[Wake of Earth|Elemental Burst]] can be used to block Maguu Kenki's path and reduce its teleport distance.
* '''Shadowsword: Pseudo Tengu Sweeper''' can also be used to control the direction of Maguu Kenki's teleportation in the player's favor, such as forcing it to teleport towards an obstacle, as this attack will always teleport Maguu Kenki away from the player.
* '''Shadowsword: Blustering Blade''' is sometimes used as an emergency return-to-spawn-point measure if Maguu Kenki is too far from its starting location. Avoid roaming too far from the boss's spawn point to reduce the likelihood of this attack, or anticipate Maguu Kenki's teleport direction when it occurs as it will always teleport back to its spawn point.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|An autonomous humanoid swordsman. It is said that this machine was made using the culminative memory of the first-generation master of a certain sword technique known for its secret technique, the Tengu Sweeper. However, it malfunctioned, lost control, and was ultimately discarded. Some sing that this blade-ghost wanders about in a place where fate was severed.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}
{{Description|A disciplined mechanical swordsman.<br />Doesn't seem to have the ability nor will to speak, but instead only seeks to communicate with crossed swords.<br />It is said that this machine was made using the memories of the first-generation master of a certain sword school. However, it malfunctioned, lost control, and was ultimately discarded.<br />Some sing that the machine's spirit still lingers in the place where its fate was ended. They also say that the vicious mask that serves as its guard was inspired by a famous [[oni]] from that era.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* The Maguu Kenki in the [[Golden Apple Archipelago/1.6|Golden Apple Archipelago]]'s title is ''Humanoid Automaton of Unknown Origin''.
* Maguu Kenki is the "General" mentioned in the Conch Retrospection series [[Echoing Tales/Story#IV: My .22Hero.22|"My Hero"]], from the [[Echoing Tales]] event. During [[Dodo-King of the Sea: Lying in Wait]], it is suggested that it may have defended the inhabitants of the islands from [[hilichurls]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Dodo-King of the Sea: Lying in Wait|quote='''Diluc''': Hmm... There is a hilichurl presence here. Perhaps this machine's indiscriminate attack is actually supposed to be targeted at hilichurls... to protect the inhabitants.}}</ref>
* True to its name, Maguu Kenki appears to have puppet strings attached to various parts of its body.
* The Maguu Kenki on the Golden Apple Archipelago was stolen by [[Ako Domeki]]'s crew, who had it with them when they got shipwrecked on the Golden Apple Archipelago 500 years ago.
* Despite being released in [[Version 1.6]], Maguu Kenki did not appear in the "Living Beings" section of the [[Archive]] until [[Version 2.0]] when Inazuma was released. The boss could not be reviewed even if the player had defeated it before in the Golden Apple Archipelago, until the player found and defeated it in Inazuma.
* Maguu Kenki's sword arts, and model, are based off [[Iwakura Michihiro]]'s, which would essentially make them "practitioners" of the [[Iwakura Clan]].
* The Maguu Kenki is the only Automaton boss that drops gems corresponding to its elements.
* In Version 2.4, the floating blue particles usually seen in [[Wuwang Hill]] are no longer present inside the area where the Maguu Kenki resides.
