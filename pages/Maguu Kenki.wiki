****If '''Phantom: Slashes''' is used as a follow up to '''Iai: Shadowrush''', follows up with '''Pushing Mask''' regardless of the element of the phantom.
***If the player moves in the opposite direction of that of their initial movement which determined the phantom's element, while staying close to the Maguu Kenki, performs 2 consecutive slashes with no follow-ups.

*'''Phantom: Whirlwind Slash:'''
**'''Variant 1:''' Enters Iai stance and charges, [[Vacuum Field|dragging]] the player into its area of effect, before quickly slashing around itself, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Anemo DMG}}. The phantom appears close to the Maguu Kenki and slashes over a larger area, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}}.
**'''Variant 2:''' Teleports and leaves a {{Cryo}} phantom in its original location. Maguu Kenki and the phantom charge simultaneously before quickly slashing around themselves.

This attack will only be used if the Maguu Kenki is hit while not performing an attack.

===Ability Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if they meet all of the following conditions:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range and angle required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.

==Strategy==
Maguu Kenki's attacks will initially deal {{Color|Physical DMG}}. Similarly to [[Kairagi]], it is not particularly dangerous until it imbues itself as it uses basic attacks. At '''71%''', Maguu Kenki enters its second phase; when it reaches this threshold, it uses Frost Dive to imbue itself with {{Cryo}} and {{Anemo}}, and cannot be damaged past '''70%''' HP until this attack ends. Upon reaching this threshold, the boss has a habit of frequently warping away from the player.

Maguu Kenki's mask parry is triggered by attack distance rather than attack type. Damage dealt when the player is in melee range will not trigger the parry, even if the damage comes from bow or catalyst characters, while damage dealt when the player is far away can trigger the parry, including damage dealt over time by stationary fields and creatures like [[Guoba Attack|Guoba]]. Since the mask parry will not be triggered in melee range, it is recommended to bring melee characters and stay close while attacking.

Maguu Kenki's Frost Dive, although covers a large AoE, can be countered by using a [[Sprinting#Dash|dash]] [[Invincibility Frames|i-frame]] as soon as it enters downward motion.

==Trivia==
*The Maguu Kenki in the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]]'s title is ''Humanoid Automaton of Unknown Origin''.
*Maguu Kenki is the "General" mentioned in the Conch Retrospection series [[Echoing Tales/Story#IV: My .22Hero.22|"My Hero"]], from the [[Echoing Tales]] event. During [[Dodo-King of the Sea: Lying in Wait]], it is suggested that it may have defended the inhabitants of the islands from [[hilichurls]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Dodo-King of the Sea: Lying in Wait|quote='''Diluc''': Hmm... There is a hilichurl presence here. Perhaps this machine's indiscriminate attack is actually supposed to be targeted at hilichurls... to protect the inhabitants.}}</ref>
*True to its name, Maguu Kenki appears to have puppet strings attached to various parts of its body.
*According to an Echoing Conch, the Maguu Kenki was brought to the Golden Apple Archipelago by Inazuman immigrants to the island, after they stole it from their homeland.
*Despite being released in [[Version 1.6]], Maguu Kenki did not appear in the "Living Beings" section of the [[Archive]] until [[Version 2.0]] when Inazuma was released. The boss could not be reviewed even if the player had defeated it before in the Golden Apple Archipelago, until the player found and defeated it in Inazuma.
*The Maguu Kenki's sword arts, and model, are based off [[Iwakura Doukei]]'s, which would essentially make them "practitioners" of the [[Iwakura Clan]].
