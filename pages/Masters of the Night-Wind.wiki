The '''Masters of the Night-Wind''', or '''Mictlan''', is one of the six tribes in [[Natlan]]. They can be found at the [["Masters of the Night-Wind"]] on top of [[Tezcatepetonco Range]]. Their current chief is [[Biram]].

==Overview==
Out of all of the tribes, the Masters of the Night-Wind have the deepest connection with the [[Night Kingdom]]. Their primary role is as "shamans" (or "mystics") who conduct rituals to communicate with the [[Wayob]] for knowledge and guidance. They are also responsible for monitoring the health of Natlan's [[Ley Line]]s and [[Phlogiston]].<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Toltec}}</ref> Members of other tribes often travel to the Masters of the Night-Wind to seek their spiritual services, e.g., to read their futures<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Mitl}}</ref> or bless their tools and weapons.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Tlilhua}}</ref> Their other areas of expertise include storytelling,<ref>{{Ref/Item|Night-Wind's Mystic Augury}}</ref> record-keeping,<ref>{{Ref/Companion|Xilonen}}</ref> medicine, and [[Phlogiston Engraving]].

The shamans of Mictlan practice a range of mystical arts, including divination, potion-making, and astral projection. They possess a heightened perception that allows them to see the energy of Phlogiston and even souls.<ref name="TWTSD">{{Ref/Quest|To Whence the Smoke Drifts}}</ref><ref name="ANAN">{{Ref/Quest|All Names are Noble}}</ref> They are also capable of casting a variety of spells, such as for healing, telekinesis, concealment, and memory extraction.<ref name="TFLSIT">{{Ref/Quest|The Flickering Light Splits in Twain}}</ref> The spell-caster's repertoire depends on their skill level and training. [[Citlali]], who is currently the most experienced shaman of the Masters of the Night-Wind, has mastered many rare spells and created many of her own.

According to Citlali, all of the tribe's spells and "problem-solving methods" are based on dealing with spirits, so a certain degree of spiritual sensitivity is required. Some tribe members are born with no such sensitivity whatsoever; they are known as "spirit-duffers." It is possible to force a spirit-duffer into a clairvoyant state, but if they sustain harm or get stuck, it can be difficult to retrieve or heal them.<ref name="NWL">{{Ref/Quest|Night-Wind Letter}}</ref>

The people of Mictlan have a reputation of being eccentric and reclusive. Most Mictlan tribe members encountered outside of their own settlement are traveling doctors.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Nanse}}</ref>

Their current chief is [[Biram]].

==Lore==
The Mictlan tribe was founded shortly after the [[Archon War]] through the combined efforts of the Priest-King [[Maghan]] and his [[Maghan's Master|master]], a young mystic.

===Etymology===
*{{w|Mictlān}} is the underworld in Aztec mythology.
