|description    = A bowl of water that one cleans one's hands with. It is often set up along the main path to the tea garden.<br />To some Inazumans, carefully washing one's hands and settling one's breathing and state of mind before entering a tea room is a tradition of utmost importance - that way, they can achieve a form of "purity of heart," which will allow them to fully experience the profound mysteries of the tea they shall taste.
