** Phase I: Exacting Moon
*** You will obtain 1 Extract stack after obtaining a shard created through the Crystallize reaction, which will increase the DMG dealt by your active character by 8% for 10s. Max 3 stacks. When characters possessing 3 stacks obtain more Crystallize reaction-created shards, they will unleash a shockwave that deals True DMG to opponents. Shockwaves created this way can occur every 3s.
** Phase II: Stonesoul Moon
*** When there is a Geo construct near your active character, your Charged Attacks deal 30% more DMG and the Stamina they consumed is decreased by 50%.
** Phase III: Pureshade Moon

When a character deals a different type of Elemental DMG to an opponent this way, the previous Elemental DMG Bonus gained will reset.
