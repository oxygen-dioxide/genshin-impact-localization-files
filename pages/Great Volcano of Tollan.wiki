The '''Great Volcano of Tollan''', also known as the '''Ancient Sacred Mountain''', is an active volcano that encompasses the whole of [[Atocpan]], [[Natlan]]. It is located within the southwestern region of Natlan and will periodically erupt.

==Descriptions==
{{Description|A giant volcano in the southwest of Natlan, referred to as the "Sacred Mountain" in ancient scrolls. Though it still erupts from time to time, it is said to have been even more active during the dark chapters of the past.|[[Loading Screen]]}}

==Eruption Mechanic==
When the volcano erupts and if the player is within the Atocpan region, fireballs will start continuously spewing out of the volcano onto the ground for a period of time until the eruption ends. These projectiles will deal {{Pyro}} DMG to both the player and enemies alike if hit by them. In certain areas, giant boulders will start rolling down towards the player.

===Gameplay Notes===
* If players leave Atocpan or teleport to a different region outside of Atocpan, the eruption will end.
** The eruption also ends when players approach the "[[Collective of Plenty]]" tribe.{{verify}}
* Eruptions occur in predictable patterns:
** Eruptions are guaranteed to occur at XX:00, XX:15, XX:30 and XX:45 of the server time.{{verify}}<!--unsure if will erupt while in pause menu (i.e. "time stop")?/unsure if eruption is visible while outside Natlan, from another region-->
** Eruptions are also guaranteed to occur 180 seconds after arriving in Natlan, whether by walking into the region, teleporting to the region, or logging into the game when having previously logged out while in the region.
** Eruptions are also guaranteed to occur when arriving at specific locations within Atocpan, such as just south<!-- and slightly east, so southsoutheast --> of Atocpan's most northwest [[Teleport Waypoint]].
* Each eruption lasts for about 50 seconds.{{verify}}
* [[Enemies]] will find cover when an eruption starts, but will pursue the player into the open if combat mode is triggered.

===Paimon Dialogue===
When an eruption starts, [[Paimon]] may say one of the following voicelines:
{{Dialogue Start}}

:{{A|vo tips volcano avoid outdoor paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Quick, find somewhere to hide!
:{{A|vo tips volcano avoid outdoor paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Be careful! Watch out for low-flying rubble!
:{{A|vo tips volcano avoid indoor paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That she blows again... Wonder how long it'll go on for this time?
:{{A|vo tips volcano avoid indoor paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's sit tight till this blows over. No sense going outside in these conditions. <small>(If the player is within the tribal settlement)</small>{{verify}}
{{Dialogue End}}

{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{A|vo tips volcano end paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is it over? ...Yeah, seems like it’s over!
:{{A|vo tips volcano end paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* Finally...
:{{A|vo tips volcano end paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's hope it didn't spew out anything too weird this time...
{{Dialogue End}}

==Lore==
The Great Volcano was once the dwelling of the ancient [[dragon]]s, and their palace was located somewhere beneath the magma.<ref name="VLSP">{{Ref/Book|The Volcano Lord and the Shadow Pins}}</ref> According to legend, it is from this palace that [[Kukulkan]] stole the [[Phlogiston|primal fire]] in the form of [[Pyrophosphorite]].<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Reckoning of the Xenogenic}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Book|Records of Hanan Pacha}}</ref> It is also said to be the place where [[Xbalanque]] fought and defeated [[Xiuhcoatl]] after the latter became corrupted by the [[Abyss]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Road Ahead}}</ref>

Sometime after the dragon civilization crumbled, the Abyss is said to have taken over the volcano.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Surf's Up}}</ref><ref name="VLSP" />

The power of the two [[Golden Entreaty|Golden Entreaties]] is closely tied to the Great Volcano of Tollan. It is said that bringing both of them to the volcano can remove the [[Xiuhcoatl|Flamelord's Blessing]] from a [[Saurian]].<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Manqu}}</ref>
