'''Berries''' are a [[Cooking Ingredient]] commonly found in the wild all over [[Teyvat]].

==How to Obtain==
Berries grow in groups of three on a single stem and are found in all kinds of grassy terrains around Teyvat. Dropped Berries may also be found in critter hideouts.

See the Video Guides section or the '''[https://webstatic-sea.mihoyo.com/app/ys-map-sea/index.html#/map/2?shown_types=163 Teyvat Interactive Map]''' for specific locations.

Additionally, the following NPCs give Berries after following a certain dialogue branch for the first time:
*[[Zhuyu]] at [[Stone Gate]], [[Liyue]] (6 Berries)

==Trivia==
* The berry may have been based on the real life {{w|Rubus chamaemorus|Cloud berry}}.
* Berry stems will drop one berry to the ground at each melee weapon hit they receive, in the same way that the larger fruit trees of Teyvat drop one fruit at each hit.
