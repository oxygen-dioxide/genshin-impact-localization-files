'''''The Legend of the Mysterious Island''''' is the second act of {{Quest|Where the Springs Return}}.

==Steps==
* Start the quest by talking to [[Amina]] in {{LL|"People of the Springs"|.}}
# Go to the designated location to lure the scammer out
# Follow the scammer "guide"
# Try to get closer to [[Ata (Koholasaur)|Ata]] and take a photo together
# Follow the directions to the designated location
# Reach the "mysterious island"

==Dialogue==
{{Stub Dialogue|Check for conditional dialogue:
# Scare Ata (peaceful trigger area is large, need to try scaring from afar)
# Amina's dialogue referencing [[Tale of Dreams Plucked From Fire]]: confirmed [[Seeker No Finding]] does NOT have to be completed and that simply revealing the hidden island is sufficient, but which of the following is the exact trigger?:
#* Completing [[Tracer No Tracing]]
#* Riding the Spiritway up to the Upper Sanctum for the first time
#* Revealing the hidden island}}
{{Quest Description|Your curiosity having been piqued, you decide to head to the People of the Springs, and ask the tribal leader about the legends of the mysterious island.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Amina)
;(If the player has not yet met Amina in ''[[Home of the Hot Springs]]'')
::{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is this where the chief of the People of the Springs should be?
::{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 01a.ogg}} {{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 01b.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Someone looking for me? Oh, why, if it isn't {{Traveler}} and {{MC|m=his|f=her}} companion.
::{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? So the chief's a... little kid? And wait, how do you already know us?
::{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 02.ogg}} '''Amina:''' As chief of the tribe, I must stay informed about everything that could have a significant impact on [[Natlan]]. That way, I can come up with the best possible plans for the tribe.
;(If the player has already met Amina)
::{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 01a.ogg}} {{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 01b.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Someone looking for me? Oh, why, if it isn't {{Traveler}} and {{MC|m=his|f=her}} companion.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 03.ogg}} '''Amina:''' So what brings you here? Do you need help with anything?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We want to visit the mysterious island!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 04.ogg}} '''Amina:''' The mysterious island, huh...
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, is there something wrong?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 05.ogg}} '''Amina:''' I'm assuming you two are already aware that this island is related to a legend of my people.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, but now that you mention it, we don't know anything about the actual legend yet.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 06.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Then allow me to explain it to you two.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 07.ogg}} '''Amina:''' It is said that the first chief of the [[People of the Springs]] was the most outstanding guide in all of Natlan. He discovered many deserted domains and found countless treasures.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 08.ogg}} '''Amina:''' But to prove himself once more, he embarked on yet another journey, in search of a legendary mysterious island. He endured many hardships along the way, but he persevered and managed to reach the destination.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 09.ogg}} '''Amina:''' The island emits a golden light, where countless treasures are buried. But instead of claiming the treasures for himself, he left behind a trail of clues that lead to the island.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 10.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Since then, many people from later generations have undertaken the challenge of finding the island. After all, to find the island is to find riches and glory.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that makes sense! So could you tell us how to get to that island?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 11.ogg}} '''Amina:''' ...
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon gets it. This is a big secret for the People of the Springs, so you can't just tell anyone, right?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 12.ogg}} '''Amina:''' On the contrary, it's quite the opposite. The legend and the clues needed to find the island are all already known to the public.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! Then what's the problem?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 13.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Well, I'm willing to answer your question in exchange for a favor. What do you think?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure thing, but what do you need us to do?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 14.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Then you have my thanks. Allow me to tell you some details.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 15.ogg}} '''Amina:''' I'll be honest, there are some among the tribe who are of rather base character. Not long ago, I received a report that a few of them were working together to scam visitors.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 16.ogg}} '''Amina:''' As the chief of the tribe, I was very ashamed to hear of this...
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's really hard to believe that could happen!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 17.ogg}} '''Amina:''' They are targeting tourists who wish to visit that island.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 18.ogg}} '''Amina:''' According to my sources, they would trick tourists into believing they are trustworthy guides, before luring the tourists into spending a fortune for the sake of reaching the island.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 19.ogg}} '''Amina:''' They run a pretty sophisticated operation. They would always claim the scammed money as some kind of legal travel expenditure, so it's hard to use that to directly convict them.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 20.ogg}} '''Amina:''' So, I was hoping to find someone who could approach them and pretend to get scammed. Doing so would allow us to gather the evidence required to bring them to justice.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 21.ogg}} '''Amina:''' The problem is... They would certainly recognize anyone associated with me, which is why I haven't been able to carry out the plan yet.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon understands now. We're the perfect bait because we're both tourists!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 22.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Exactly. And as far as I know, you two are no pushovers. No matter what nefarious schemes they may come up with, you'll be perfectly capable of protecting yourselves, right?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 paimon 12a.ogg}} {{A|vo mlnlq002 1 paimon 12b.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You betcha! If it's just a few scammers we're talking about, {{MC|m=he|f=she}} will take 'em all down!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 23.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Wonderful. Then here, please take this.

Item Amina's Coin Pouch.png
</gallery>
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, that's a lot of [[Mora]]! Did we already earn a bonus?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 24.ogg}} '''Amina:''' There will be plenty of rewards if you manage to catch those scoundrels. This Mora, however, is for other purposes.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 25.ogg}} '''Amina:''' I'm sure some spending will be required on your part before they lower their guard. I certainly wouldn't expect you to pay out of your own pockets.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 26.ogg}} '''Amina:''' So please use the Mora as needed, and collect as much evidence as possible.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No wonder you're the chief! Seems like you've already thought of everything. Okay, we'll take it from here!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 1 amina 27.ogg}} '''Amina:''' I've marked the location of the scammers on your map. I'll leave the rest to you two.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Amina's Coin Pouch}})

;(Talk to Amina again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog mlnlq002 amina 01.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Please remember, we need concrete evidence. I'm counting on you.

;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This should be the place! Now, let's see if anyone around here looks like a scammer!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon...
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, right, we should pretend we are innocent tourists with no idea about what's going on! But how should we lure those scammers out?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe try talking about the mysterious island?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good idea. Speaking of which, Paimon's dying to know what kind of treasures could be buried on the mysterious island! Wonder if anyone's ever really seen them before!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 kaulu 01.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Ah, are you two visitors from afar looking to visit the mysterious island?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Who the...? Oh, looks like we managed to lure them out already.
:{{DIcon}} C'mon, Paimon, don't forget our roles.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ahem... Oh, pardon, is something the matter?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 kaulu 02.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' I just happened to overhear you two talking about the mysterious island. I assume you two must be tourists brought here by the legend and looking for the island, am I right?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hello, Paimon is Paimon, and this is {{Traveler}}. That's right, we were just getting ready to look for that island from the legend!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 kaulu 03.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' In that case, as a qualified guide, I certainly cannot allow you to embark on such a dangerous journey.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 kaulu 04.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' As the legend says, if you can manage to reach the mysterious island, riches and glory will be yours for the taking.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 kaulu 05.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Be that as it may, the journey to the island is full of untold perils and dangers. It would be nigh impossible for any average person to reach the island.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 kaulu 06.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' But you are in luck! Allow me to tell you the purpose of our services. It just so happens that our mission as guides is to help visitors avoid danger, find shortcuts, and successfully reach their destination.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} So, this was all a pitch for your services?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 kaulu 07.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Please, there's no need to worry. This was just one point I had to make perfectly clear.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 kaulu 08.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Although the legend and the clues to finding the island are known to everyone, the leads left behind by our ancestors are as enigmatic as riddles found on a lost treasure map.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 kaulu 09.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Only guides bestowed with the legacy of our ancestors can correctly decipher the clues. Tourists who rashly embark on their own often wind up lost and encounter unnecessary dangers.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, he actually sounds pretty convincing...
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 kaulu 10.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' But it seems like fate has brought us together, so what say you to having me as your guide?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, so how much will you charge us?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 kaulu 11.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Not to worry, I don't intend to charge any fees.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you'd be working for... free?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 kaulu 12.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' For us People of the Springs, guiding guests to the mysterious island is a great honor in of itself, worth more than any amount of Mora.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Smooth, Paimon almost wants to believe him...
:{{DIcon}} This is all still a part of his sales pitch.
:{{DIcon}} We need to see what he actually wants to do.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, thank you. Then please, guide us onward!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 2 kaulu 13.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Of course. Please follow me.

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 kaeho 01.ogg}} '''Kaeho:''' Hmm? Are you two here to take pictures with the [[Koholasaur]]s?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really, can we!?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 kaulu 01.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Ahem...!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 kaeho 02.ogg}} '''Kaeho:''' Huh? Oh... You two must be here to seek insight from Ata, right?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, Ata? Insight?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 kaeho 03.ogg}} '''Kaeho:''' Shh, not so loud. Openly saying their name in such a manner will only cause them to loathe you.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 kaulu 02.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Ah, I apologize for not explaining earlier. As you can see, Ata is the elder Koholasaur my senior here is responsible to serve.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 kaulu 03.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Ata is highly respected among the tribe, and is far more knowledgeable than other Koholasaurs. They say that Ata has actually visited the mysterious island before.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 kaulu 04.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Therefore, we must rely on Ata's insight to know how to get there.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? But how do we do that? Can a Koholasaurus elder talk?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 kaulu 05.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' You need only slowly approach Ata. Once Ata has confirmed your scent, they will provide their wise insight... In the language of the Koholasaurs, of course.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 kaulu 06.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' But no need to worry. The ability to interpret this language is one of the basic skills required of a guide from the People of the Springs.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 kaulu 07.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' I can understand Ata's instructions, and will lead you on the journey ahead.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright... then let's give it a try.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 kaeho 04.ogg}} '''Kaeho:''' Ahem! That'll be 10,000 Mora per person.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 kaeho 05.ogg}} '''Kaeho:''' Uh, in order for Ata to give us insight, they must recall their past, which can be extremely taxing for a Koholasaur. Costs to maintain their health can be quite high, you know.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 kaulu 08.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' I'm sorry, such expenses may arise in the process of finding our way. But as long as we reach the mysterious island, these costs will be quite trivial in the end.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There you have it... Paimon knew there was no such thing as a free lunch.
:{{DIcon}} Just pay up. Let's not make him suspicious.
:{{DIcon}} It should also help us gather evidence.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon has an idea! She bets they've just made up all that stuff about the talking Koholasaur. But if we can get a receipt, that'll be proof that they're scamming tourists.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' With that kind of evidence, there'd be no doubt that they're guilty.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 kaeho 06.ogg}} '''Kaeho:''' What's taking them so long... Well, what do you say? I'll even throw in a group photo of you two with Ata. You won't ever find another deal like this!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, that's an unexpected bonus! Quick, let's pay the man!
:{{DIcon}} Whatever makes you happy, Paimon.

;(If Ata gets scared){{Verify}}
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 3 kaeho 07.ogg}} '''Kaeho:''' Didn't I tell you not to scare Ata!? *sigh* Let me calm them down, and you can try again.--><!--does not get scared by shooting it or lighting the grass under it on fire-->

;(Talk to Kaeho or Kaulu, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog mlnlq002 kaeho 01.ogg}} '''Kaeho:''' Remember, approach them slowly. You don't want to scare Ata.
:{{A|vo dialog mlnlq002 kaulu 01.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Don't worry, I will help interpret Ata's insights.

;(Approach Ata)
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa, Ata really didn't try to bite us at all!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 4 kaeho 01.ogg}} '''Kaeho:''' You can also pose now if you'd like a photo together.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay!
:;(Kaeho takes a few photos)
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 4 ata 01.ogg}} '''Ata:''' (Ata makes a noise, but it's hard to tell the meaning.)
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 4 kaulu 01.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Oh, Ata is already speaking! Let me listen to what they have to say... Oh, I see!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Could you really get anything from that noise?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 4 kaulu 02.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Of course. Like I said, only a guide like me can understand their language. Let's follow Ata's instructions and proceed to the next area.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 4 kaeho 02.ogg}} '''Kaeho:''' Here's your group photo. I even packaged it up for free.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Any chance we could get a receipt for that?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 4 kaeho 03.ogg}} '''Kaeho:''' No problem at all. Here ya go.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hee-hee!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 4 kaulu 03.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Please, come with me.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We still have a lot of the chief's Mora to use. Why don't we keep up the act and gather some more evidence?
:{{DIcon}} Good idea.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Heh, Paimon's curious what other tricks these scammers are using.
:{{Black Screen|Under Kaulu's guidance, you obtain one "clue" after another while forking over Mora left and right.}}
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' These guys are going way too far! He keeps coming up with some far-fetched reasons to make us pay for everything!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' With all the evidence we have now, we could bring him straight to the chief and he'd definitely be convicted!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But, after handing over all that Mora, Paimon kinda wants to see if he'll actually take us to the island or not.
:{{DIcon}} It wouldn't hurt to gather some more evidence.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 4 kaulu 04.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Sorry to keep you waiting. After all the clues we've gathered, I've managed to find a shortcut to the island!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, alright. Then let's get going!

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 5 kaulu 01.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' This is the spot. The trails of sunlight will guide the way. Once you cross the rushing water, the light of the setting sun shall reveal everything.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 5 kaulu 02.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Ata's insights have already pointed us to the destination. It's just on the opposite bank!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You mean we're almost there? Huh, but there wasn't even anything exciting about this journey...
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 5 kaulu 03.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' As I said before, this is a shortcut. If I took you on some arduous path after all the Mora you spent, that wouldn't make me look like a good guide, don't you think?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 5 kaulu 04.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Anyway, there's no time to lose. We need to get there before sunset.

;(Approach the marked location)

:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? You mean the mysterious island...?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 kaulu 02.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Yes, I've led you to the island just as I promised, which means it's time for me to say goodbye.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hold on, are you serious!? This is supposed to be the island!? Then what about the treasure? And look at these wooden signs and artificial lights. Even we can tell it's fake!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 kaulu 03.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' All that stuff about treasure is just part of the legend &mdash; I didn't make any promises about what you'd find. And who says a mysterious island can't look like this?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmph, since you seem to have dropped the act, then there's no need for us to continue, either.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We were commissioned by the chief of the People of the Springs to gather evidence of your scamming activities! With these receipts, your scamming days are over.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 kaulu 04.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Heh, you sure? Then what's written on those receipts?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's see... Huh? Wait, all the writing has disappeared!?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 kaulu 05.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' I took you all this way just to buy enough time for the handwriting to disappear. Even if you were to go back to the people you paid, you'd only find that they were using fake names, making them impossible to track down.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 kaulu 06.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' You wanna report me for scamming tourists, then be my guest. I'll just say that I'm being falsely accused. With that settled, I'll be going now.

:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 kaulu 07.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' What's the chief doing here?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 01.ogg}} '''Amina:''' I had dispatched others to secretly trail you. Thanks to you, we can finally convict him of scamming people.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 kaulu 08a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 kaulu 08b.ogg}}--> '''Kaulu:''' Convict me? How? They don't have any evidence against me. Even as the chief, you can't just level accusations without any evidence, right?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sorry to say it, but he got us. We lost all the evidence we had...
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 02.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Not to worry, let's search him first.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 kaulu 09.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Hey, what are you doing? Keep your hands off me, that's my Mora!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 03.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Yes, I see the mark... Looks like you already split the Mora before you led them here.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 kaulu 10.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' What do you mean?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 04.ogg}} '''Amina:''' The Mora that {{Traveler}} and Paimon were using today were all provided by me. They all have a special mark on them.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 kaulu 11.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' You...
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 05a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 05b.ogg}}--> '''Amina:''' So, there must be an explanation why the Mora that should have been theirs ended up in your hands, right?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 06.ogg}} '''Amina:''' There are no receipts to prove that any transactions took place, and you yourself just denied that there was a scam... So did you, then, take the Mora from them by force?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Take Mora from others by force!? Oh, that's an even more serious crime than scamming!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 kaulu 12.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Ah, y&mdash;you... Ugh, alright. Sure, I admit that I coaxed them into spending a few times... But I wouldn't go as far as calling it "scamming"...
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 07.ogg}} '''Amina:''' We have witnesses standing right here, you know.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 kaulu 13.ogg}} '''Kaulu:''' Fine... Yes, it was all a scam.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Woohoo! No wonder you're the chief of the tribe!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 08.ogg}} '''Amina:''' I still don't understand how so many people have been getting duped by them. You need only stop and think for a moment to see through the whole thing.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 09.ogg}} '''Amina:''' If he claims to be able to find a shortcut to the mysterious island, then why hasn't he just gone there and claimed the treasure for himself? Why even bother guiding others there?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's a good point. Speaking of, have any guides from the People of the Springs ever found the treasure of the mysterious island?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 10.ogg}} '''Amina:''' I can answer this question along with your previous one about how to get there. The answer is actually very simple&mdash;
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 11.ogg}} '''Amina:''' There is no shortcut to the island, and most people don't even meet the requirement to ever reach it.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 12.ogg}} '''Amina:''' If you don't meet this single condition, then even guides from the People of the Springs, despite all of their abilities, will find it difficult to overcome the obstacles along the way...
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 13.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Which is exactly why even though the clues to the mysterious island are open to the public, few have ever made it there.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There's a requirement? What is it?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 14.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Let me ask you something first. What do you think a real journey to the mysterious island should be like?
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, it should probably involve... overcoming a lot of hardships with your companions, before witnessing some breathtaking sights, uncovering a really touching story.. Oh! And scoring some super cool treasure at the end!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 15.ogg}} '''Amina:''' And therein lies the key point... overcoming hardships with your companions.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 16.ogg}} '''Amina:''' It's said that when the first chief set out to search for the island, the ones who accompanied him were not clients, nor tourists, but his closest friends.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 17.ogg}} '''Amina:''' The legend also mentioned that only those willing to entrust their lives to one another will be able to reach the island together.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 18.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Therefore, the requirement to reach the island is journeying with your closest friends... The kind of friends you would trust with your life.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 paimon 14.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's the key...
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 19.ogg}} '''Amina:''' From what I can see, you and Paimon are exactly those kinds of friends, the kind that would trust each other with anything.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 20.ogg}} '''Amina:''' But unfortunately, neither of you are experienced guides. And if you were to hire someone else, then I'm afraid you could probably never place your lives in the hands of someone you met on a pure monetary basis.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 paimon 15.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's true...
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 21.ogg}} '''Amina:''' But don't feel discouraged! I believe that this beautiful land that I call my home will not disappoint you.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 22.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Whether it's remote islands or ancient ruins, I'm sure they can also provide you with plenty of exciting adventures.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 23.ogg}} '''Amina:''' And let me tell you a secret. The elders once told me that beneath these very ruins lies a way to reach the sky!
:;(Amina turns to look at the nearby Spiritdoor)
;(If the hidden island in [[the Upper Sanctum]] has already been unlocked){{Verify|exact trigger needed, see stub notice}}
::{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 24.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Or, maybe somebody already discovered that...
::{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 25.ogg}} '''Amina:''' No matter, if you two want to go adventuring elsewhere, I can also give you some suggestions.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 paimon 16a.ogg}}<!--{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 paimon 16b.ogg}}--> '''Paimon:''' Yeah, thanks for that! But knowing us, we don't give up so easily, even when a place is supposedly "impossible" to visit...
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 26.ogg}} '''Amina:''' Oh, I can understand. I won't stop you if you're still interested in visiting the island. I just recommend finding a guide first who you could trust with your lives.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 paimon 17.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A guide we could trust with our lives? Who knows when we'll meet someone like that around here...
:{{DIcon}} Maybe it won't take as long as you think.
;(If ''[[Into Eternal Night]]'' has not been completed)
::{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 paimon 19.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, Paimon has a good feeling about this. Then let's go check out some of the other places first!
;(If ''Into Eternal Night'' has already been completed)
::{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 paimon 18.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh! We can go find [[Mualani]]!
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 amina 27.ogg}} '''Amina:''' It appears you've already made up your minds. Then I'll be taking my leave. My assistants will pay you for all your help. Thanks again.
:{{A|vo mlnlq002 6 paimon 20.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, bye-bye!
