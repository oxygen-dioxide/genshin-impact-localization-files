==Trivia==
* In Japanese, this NPC's name includes the word {{ja|飛車|hisha|flying chariot,}} referring to the {{w|Rook (chess)|rook}}-equivalent piece in {{w|shogi}}. Within a shogi context, the name {{ja|千日|Sennichi|lit=thousand days}} takes on another meaning, alluding to {{ja|千日手|{{w|sennichite}}|lit=moves for a thousand days,}} a rule in shogi stating that the game will end in a draw if the same position is repeated four times during a game. This allusion fits well with his stubborn and combative attitude.
