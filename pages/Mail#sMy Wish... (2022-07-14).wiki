|text    = Let me cut to the chase: Today, I do not expect a celebration or any presents. My only wish is to spar with you.

As General of the [[Tenryou Commission]], I have the vital task of maintaining order within [[Inazuma City]]. Sparring with you is a test for me to see if my martial arts have improved.

Since it is a sparring session, I will not use my [[Vision]], nor will you need to use your elemental energy.

Apart from that, you need not have restraints or concerns. Just let me see your true strength.

Note: I will set up the dojo and have it cleaned up afterwards. You only need to be there on time.
