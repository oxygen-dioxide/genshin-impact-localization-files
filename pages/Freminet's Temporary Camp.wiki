==NPCs==
* [[Thelxie]]

==Interactables==
==="Thelxie" Development Log (I)===
{{Dialogue Start}}<!-- available prior to speaking with Delaroche for the very first time -->
;(Interact with "Thelxie" Development Log (I) in [[Freminet]]'s camp)
:'''"Thelxie" Development Log (I):''' ...Attempted to install a language output module for Thelxie. The output signal will use a similar cipher to the one once used by the House of the Hearth...
:'''"Thelxie" Development Log (I):''' The benefits are twofold. Not only does the warehouse at the {{sic|House of Hearth}} already have many spare old motherboards, this approach will also make the language module compatible with the diving helmet's transcription module, allowing for quick and easy transcription and testing...
:'''"Thelxie" Development Log (I):''' As for the offset of the cipher, it will just be set to {{color|buzzword|1}} for convenience...
{{Dialogue End}}

==="Thelxie" Development Log (II)===
{{Dialogue Start}}<!-- available prior to speaking with Delaroche for the very first time -->
;(Interact with "Thelxie" Development Log (II) in Freminet's camp)
:'''"Thelxie" Development Log (II):''' ...I've hit a snag. I had planned to apply for a transcription module to use for Thelxie, and it would have been the same one as the one used in the diving helmet, but the warehouse is out of stock...
:'''"Thelxie" Development Log (II):''' ...Seems like I'll have to make one from scratch using the one I have as a reference. I'll start looking into it, but it's unclear if I'll have enough time...
{{Dialogue End}}

==="Thelxie" Development Log (III)===
{{Dialogue Start}}<!-- available prior to speaking with Delaroche for the very first time -->
;(Interact with "Thelxie" Development Log (III) in Freminet's camp)
:'''"Thelxie" Development Log (III):''' ...I've already spent more time than planned on the transcription module. The work on Thelxie's main body will be affected if I keep at this. I'll have to put it on hold...
:'''"Thelxie" Development Log (III):''' ...Although the diving helmet can still be used to decipher Thelxie's output signal, it'll probably be unintelligible to everyone else. What a pity...
:'''"Thelxie" Development Log (III):''' ...I'm sorry for not being able to give you a voice, Thelxie...

===Solamenaline===
{{Dialogue Start}}<!-- available prior to speaking with Delaroche for the very first time -->
;(Interact with Solamenaline in Freminet's camp)
:'''Solamenaline:''' (Seems to be a dose of medicine left behind by someone. There's a label on the bottom of the container with the word "Destree" written on it.)
