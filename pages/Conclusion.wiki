{{Description|Even in the face of such a powerful [[Barnabas|foe]], neither [[Amber]] nor [[Collei]] give up. Meanwhile, [[Diluc]] &mdash; posing as the culprit behind the Black Fire incident &mdash; is captured by the [[Fatui]].<!--not official-->}}
'''Conclusion''' ''(unofficial title)'' is Chapter 15 of the ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' [[manga]]. It has not yet been localized in English.

==Summary==
Using his dark powers, [[Barnabas]] takes the form of a large monster as [[Amber]] quickly creates a [[Pyro]] shield around [[Collei]]. She encourages her friend to remain strong as Collei remembers how helpless she was before. Determined to be stronger, Collei breaks through the shield to help Amber. Their strong friendship empowers Amber's [[Vision]], bolstering her [[element]]al powers and successfully dismantles Barnabas as he is suddenly attacked by a series of [[Delusion#Crepus' Delusion|black chains]].

Weakened and defeated, Barnabas returns to his normal form. The [[Diluc|Darknight Hero]] approaches him as Barnabas notices his [[Delusion]] before losing consciousness. [[Kaeya]] and his team arrives at the scene. He claims the Darknight Hero is the culprit of the black fire incident as the knights arrest and "successfully" hand him over to the [[Fatui]].

[[Jean]] returns to headquarters with no progress on the incident before shockingly learning from [[Lisa]] that it has already been resolved.
