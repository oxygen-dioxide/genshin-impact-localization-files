==Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Bubble Support:''' Draws in water and then jiggles around in a bubble before exploding, dealing '''150% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}} launching two smaller bubbles towards different directions which transform into slime-like 'Water Droplets' which can be destroyed. If one droplet is already present, it will only summon the other droplet.
**The dark blue droplet will approach the player, and explode when destroyed with [[Elemental Reactions]] or when close to the player, dealing '''46.7% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}. If the Hydro Hypostasis caught inside the explosion's AoE, it will be forced to expose its core for a period of time.
**The light blue droplet will periodically generate a [[healing]] orb that travels slowly towards the Hypostasis. The player can intercept the healing orbs to recover large amounts of HP and prevent them from healing the boss.
*'''Twisting Vortex:''' Transforms into a twisting serpentine form that spirals around vertically before diving into the ground dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}, and causes bubbles to rise from the ground all around for a while after. Upon contact with a player, a bubble deals '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}} and traps the player temporarily.
*'''Dolphin Dive:''' Dives into the ground before turning into a pod of Dolphins, which leap towards the player in a curved trajectory, dealing '''150% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}.
*'''Rainstorm Maelstrom:''' Transforms into a twister while summoning three circles of deadly rain from the sky dealing '''50% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DoT}}.
*'''Dive Warp:''' Dives into the ground to re-emerge in the middle of the arena.
*'''Rolling Waves:''' Dives into the ground before transforming into a single large cube while calling rolling waves from the edges of the arena to roll in towards it, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Hydro DMG}} on contact, before causing a large splash at the end dealing '''150% ATK''' {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}.
*'''Dolphin Show:''' Creates a summoning circle and spins a ring of water around before covering itself in a bubble and then going vulnerable in the circle. While in this state it will cause dolphins to emerge from the ground all around dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}} on appearance and '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}} on landing.
*'''Wave Slam:''' Transforms into a ray and slaps the ground releasing bursts of water in a line ahead. The initial slap deals '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}, the subsequent bursts deal '''50% ATK''' or '''25% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Hydro DMG}}.
*'''Droplet Aid:''' When HP is low (approx. 5%), dives into the ground to warp to the center of the arena and summon three large 'Water Droplets' which will slowly head towards the boss. If the droplets are not defeated in time, they will touch the boss and heal it. Droplets that are defeated will not reappear the next time the boss uses this ability. The player can also prevent the Droplets from reaching the Hydro Hypostasis by blocking them with [[Geo Constructs]] or by [[Displacement|knocking]] them back.

==Strategy==
All water droplets summoned by the boss spawn with a {{Hydro}} [[Shields|Shield]]. The droplets are instantly defeated after their shields break. {{Cryo}}, {{Pyro}}, and {{Electro}} are recommended to break the Hydro droplets at the end of the fight. {{Anemo}} and {{Geo}} can also break the droplets. See [[Shields/Shield Gauge Data]] for the gauge values of the droplet shields.

The boss starts off the fight with '''Bubble Support'''. It will be vulnerable and it is recommended to explode the dark blue droplet near the boss if possible to allow for additional uptime against the boss. The lighter droplet can usually be ignored as it only launches healing support periodically, which moves slowly and can be intercepted by the player at ground level.

As the boss [[Gauge Unit Theory/Auras|applies]] Wet on itself at all times, {{Pyro}} and {{Electro}} can inflict [[Vaporize]] and [[Electro-Charged]] respectively to deal 1.5x additional damage and apply a damage over time effect respectively. As a boss, it is immune to [[Frozen]], although it can still be used to freeze droplets.

Upon reaching critical health, the boss will launch three large water droplets; if any of them reach the boss, it will revive with a percentage of its health. Droplets that are destroyed before reaching the boss will not appear again when the mechanic is used again, similarly to the Electro, Geo and Anemo Hypostases. AoE abilities with strong elemental application such as [[Planet Befall]] and [[Dandelion Breeze]], can also be used to destroy all droplets simultaneously when they are close to the boss; otherwise, use elemental attacks and pre-place if applicable (e.g. [[Guoba Attack]]).
