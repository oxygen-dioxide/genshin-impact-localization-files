|description    = A sturdy, durable round stone table that can be found within the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]]. It is as hard as a round shield, to the point that even a club swung by some drunk patron would not even put a dent in it.<br>It is said that because they have a very similar shape to sites of competition, the round tables of the [[Weary Inn]] are at times seen as "battlefields" in some sense. As such, other than "Round Shields," they are also known as "Blazing Belly Battle Tables."
