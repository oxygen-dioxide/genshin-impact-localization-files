'''Energy''' is the resource used to execute [[Elemental Burst]]s.

==Overview==
The amount of energy required for each Elemental Burst varies and can be checked in-game via the Skill Attributes section of a character's [[Talents]] menu. After a character uses their Elemental Burst, their energy is completely drained.

A character cannot have more energy than is required for their Elemental Burst, nor can a character have negative energy.

When a character is [[Fallen Characters|knocked out]], they will lose all their energy. If the player's active character falls out of bounds or drowns, the entire team will lose all Energy.

===Particles and Orbs===
Elemental particles and orbs are primarily dropped by characters' [[Elemental Skill]]s and by [[enemies]] who lose HP. When particles and orbs are picked up, they regenerate energy for the entire [[party]].

Particles and orbs only give energy once they reach a character, not when they are generated. As a result, it is possible to switch the active character before the particles or orbs are received so that a different character can recover more energy.

Particles and orbs also only begin to travel to the character if they are in range, and they disappear if not collected within approximately 30 seconds and 9 seconds, respectively.{{Verify|Verify exact periods of time}}

There are also some [[weapons]] that can generate elemental particles, and the [[Elemental Resonance]] [[High Voltage]] will generate an Electro elemental particle on a 5-second cooldown if an Electro-related Elemental Reaction is triggered on an enemy. [[Lightning]] strikes may occasionally produce one Electro particle.

The amount of energy that a character gains when a particle or orb is picked up depends on the character's [[element]], their [[Energy Recharge]] stat, whether they are on the field ("active") or off the field ("inactive"), and how many characters are in the player's party.

The number of characters in the party affects the Conversion Rate of inactive characters.<ref>Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1my4y1r7VP  Energy Recharge Research]</ref>
* For '''2 / 3 / 4''' characters in the party, the Conversion Rate of '''inactive''' characters is '''80% / 70% / 60%''' of the Conversion Rate of '''active''' characters, respectively.
* In [[Co-Op Mode]], the number is determined by characters a player can control. For 2 Players, the host is considered to have '''2''' characters in their party, so the Conversion Rate of '''inactive''' characters is '''80% ''' of the Conversion Rate of '''active''' characters.

The table below shows the conversion rates of elemental particles and orbs to energy without taking the Energy Recharge stat into account. For example, if the active character picks up an elemental particle of the same element, they gain 3 Energy at 100% Energy Recharge.

===Direct Energy Generation===
Energy can be directly generated through some [[artifacts]], [[weapons]], character talents, and character [[Constellation]]s when their activation conditions are met. Direct energy generation is not affected by the Energy Recharge stat.

Energy can also be generated at the beginning of Event Domains or through event effects. 

===Direct Energy Loss===
Aside from using an Elemental Burst or becoming knocked out, a character's energy may also be drained by [[#Enemies|certain enemies]]; [[Ley Line Disorder]]s such as [[High Voltage]]; and effects from [[weapon]]s and [[Artifact]]s, such as [[Katsuragikiri Nagamasa]] and [[Shimenawa's Reminiscence]].

==Particles Generated by Elemental Skills==
{{See also|Energy/Data#Elemental Skills}}
Elemental Skills can generate up to 5 particles at once or a smaller number of particles at intervals upon hitting an enemy. These particles will match the respective character's element. The particles generated will spawn at the location of the enemy hit, the player, or the construct that generated the attack, depending on the Elemental Skill. A small number of characters do not generate any particles at all.

Particles can be generated even if no damage is dealt due to an enemy's elemental immunity or a [[shield]] that prevents all damage. However, some Elemental Skills that deal coordinated attacks will not trigger against enemies that cannot take damage, thus preventing those Elemental Skills from generating particles.

The amount of particles generated by some Elemental Skills are not fixed. These skills have a guaranteed amount of particle generation (which may be 0) and a chance to generate 1 additional particle.

Some Elemental Skills have a cooldown for particle generation, which is independent of the cooldown of the Elemental Skill itself. After an attempt to generate particles from a successful hit, the particle generation cooldown will be entered, even if no particles were generated.

Hitting inanimate objects or non-hostile [[wildlife]] will not generate elemental particles, with the following exceptions:
* The press version of [[Razor]]'s {{Talent|Claw and Thunder|type=1|nobr=1|20}} can generate particles upon hitting non-hostile [[wildlife]].
* [[Wriothesley]]'s Normal Attacks enhanced by his {{Talent|Icefang Rush|type=1|nobr=1|20}} and Charged Attacks enhanced by his {{Talent|There Shall Be a Plea for Justice|type=1|nobr=1|20}} can generate particles upon hitting inanimate objects.

==Particles Generated by Enemy Drops==
{{See also|Energy/Data#Enemy HP Drops}}
When an enemy's [[HP]] decreases to a certain threshold, it will drop Energy particles or orbs. The HP thresholds and drops vary across different enemies, with larger enemies tending to have more thresholds, and one enemy may have up to 4 such thresholds. Depending on the type of enemy, these particles may or may not be elementally charged; for example, particles and orbs dropped by [[Slime]]s are always of their own element, whereas those dropped by [[automatons]] are always non-elemental.

Note that if a threshold has already been reached, and the enemy is [[heal]]ed over that threshold, reaching this threshold again will ''not'' drop Energy.

Some enemies may have mechanics which will restore large amounts of Energy, or completely fully restore them when the mechanic is successfully dealt with.

==Energy Generated by Normal Attacks==
When a [[Normal Attack|Normal]] or [[Charged Attack|Charged]] Attack hits an enemy, it has a probability to generate 1 Energy for the character. Every time a Normal or Charged Attack fails to generate Energy, the probability will be increased. When Energy is successfully generated, the probability will be reset. Energy restored this way is not affected by [[Energy Recharge]].
