A very rough estimation of the timeline of the ''[[Genshin Impact]]'' universe, incorporating historical records, myths, and folk tales. A constant work in progress; take information given with a grain of salt.

To view the timeline by nation, see [[:Category:Region Histories|Region Histories]] and click on the respective nation's page.

'''Note: Due this article's size, timelines for specific regions are directly taken from their History subpages. As a result, information related to multiple nations may be duplicated, and updates to their information must be made on those articles.'''

<section begin="TimelineNote" />References are provided as much as possible. Notes expand on the deduction and reasoning used to draw certain conclusions, which can be read either by hovering over (desktop-only) or clicking on the note. Some specific types of notes found on the page:
* '''Lore Discrepancy:''' When information provided in the game is self-contradictory, retroactively changed, or contradicts information from outside media (such as the [[manga]]), it is considered a lore discrepancy. This is different from a translation discrepancy, in which information is contradictory or misleading due to inaccuracies in localization. In the case of a lore discrepancy between in-game information and outside media, the in-game information always takes priority.
* '''Translation Note:''' Used when the original Chinese text and then official English localization do not match, or if something is clearer in Chinese. In the case of a translation discrepancy, the original Chinese text always takes priority.
* '''Assumptions:''' To make sense of the lore &mdash; which the [[miHoYo]] writers often deliberately obscure by withholding critical information until later versions, giving contradictory evidence, and scattering information across various item sets &mdash; editors will sometimes make assumptions to determine the order of events or connect pieces of lore together. However, they may be obsoleted and proven incorrect by new lore and story. These notes serve as a disclaimer, and expand on the editors' reasoning for their conclusions.

If you have any proposed changes for the timeline, please leave a comment and cite your evidence.<section end="TimelineNote" />

==Old World==
===Nibelung and the Seven Sovereigns===

* Dragon King [[Nibelung]] is born on [[Teyvat]].<ref name="Deep Gallery's Distant Pact"/>
* All elemental beings come from the [[Light Realm]], also known as the Vishap Realm.<ref name="SubterraTrials" /><ref name="BathVishap Records" /> [[Dragon]]s and [[Vishap]]s are the dominant species, led by the [[Seven Sovereigns]] and the Dragon King [[Nibelung]].<ref name="Primordial Bathysmal Vishap" /><ref name="What Shape Does the Self Hold" />
** Each of the Seven Sovereigns holds one of the seven elemental Authorities, and they are the strongest dragon of their respective element.<ref name="3 Realms"/><ref name="Calamitous Tread"/> The world is divided among them, and their respective land is attuned to their elemental affinity.<ref name="Before Sun and Moon" />
*** [[Apep]] holds the {{Dendro}} Authority. She resides in [[Sumeru]], where she rules the land and nurtures some of the most ancient and primordial beings, known simply as [[Apep's Creatures|Dendro Lifeforms]]<ref name="What Shape Does the Self Hold" />
*** The [[Hydro Dragon]] holds the {{Hydro}} Authority, presides over the Primordial Sea, and could be considered the original "God of Life," as all life on the planet can trace its origins back to the Primordial Sea.<ref name="When All" /> Because of this, it is sometimes referred to as "birthing waters" or "amniotic fluid."<ref name="Nursery Rhyme" /> Life within the Primordial Sea was a collective rather than made up of individuals.<ref name="Fontaine Wings" />
*** [[Xiuhcoatl]], who rules over [[Natlan]], holds the {{Pyro}} Authority and wields the powers of light, heat, and wisdom.<ref name="MoA"/><ref name="The Road Ahead"/>
* A [[voyager]] who traverses the cosmos senses Nibelung's presence on Teyvat, and tells him that the world will be destroyed and that he should leave with her. However, he refuses to abandon his people, and instead attempts to lead the dragons to the stars, leading them to develop advanced space technology.<ref name="Deep Gallery's Distant Pact"/><ref name="Ancient Watchtower"/>

===Eternal Throne of the Heavens===
* The [[Heavenly Principles]] (also known as the Primordial One, or the "eternal throne of the heavens") descends on this world<ref name="Before Sun and Moon"/> and takes a portion of the Seven Sovereigns' elemental Authorities for itself.<ref name="Calamitous Tread"/> It creates the [[Four Shades]], four shining shades of itself, to help fight the Seven Sovereigns.<ref name="Before Sun and Moon"/>
** Phanes, a candidate for the identity of the Heavenly Principles, arose from an "egg" as an androgynous figure. The eggshell had to be broken for the world to be created; however, it used the eggshell to split the "universe" from the "microcosm of the world." It then came to the world as its true lord and claimed the heavens as its eternal throne.
** [[Istaroth]] is the Ruler of Time among the Four shades.<ref name="Before Sun and Moon"/><ref group="Assumption" name="Istaroth"/>
** [[Ronova]] is the Ruler of Death among the Four shades.<ref name="Beneath the Secret Source"/> 
** The Heavenly Principles freezes Xiuhcoatl in lava, causing him to fall into a state of false death.<ref name="An Omen of Annihilation and the Final Entreaty"/>
* '''40 years after the Heavenly Principles appears''' &mdash; The Heavenly Principles and its Shades emerge victorious over the Seven Sovereigns, and the world falls under the control of the heavens while the Sovereigns' subjects escape to the oceans. The Heavenly Principles begins creating heaven and earth for the sake of humanity and its creations soon after.<ref name="Before Sun and Moon"/>
** This leads to the existence of the Human Realm created by the Heavenly Principles.<ref name="BathVishap Records"/><ref name="SubterraTrials"/>
** Nibelung leaves Teyvat in the pursuit to acquire [[Abyss]]al power to fight against the Heavenly Principles.

==First Era==
''The term "first era" is derived from ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of Remuria]]''.'' 
''All events take place at an unknown time in the past but allegedly predate Morax's birth, which was over 6,000 years ago.''

* '''400 years after the Heavenly Principles appeared''' &mdash; The Heavenly Principles finished preparing the world for humanity's arrival. It and one of its shades create all animal life, and humanity creates a covenant with the Heavenly Principles. The Heavenly Principles creates a "sacred plan" for humanity, an era referred to as the "Ark's Opening." Humanity tends to the land, which flourishes, leading to a period known  to the [[Enkanomiya]]ns as the "Year of Jubilee."<ref name="Before Sun and Moon"/>
** The Prayer artifact sets &mdash; [[Prayers to Springtime]], [[Prayers for Illumination]], [[Prayers for Destiny]], and [[Prayers for Wisdom]] &mdash; describe a time when the earth was once covered by raw elements &mdash; unending ice, flames, lightning and water. Envoys of the gods made the earth more hospitable for humanity and dwelled among them, while humans could communicate with [[Celestia]] directly. The white [[Irminsul]] trees, connected to the ley lines in the earth, held great importance in the religious rituals of these ancient civilizations.
** Life during this era is described as one of abundance and seemingly endless prosperity, and divine envoys with direct connections to [[Celestia]] dwelled among humanity.<ref name="Before Sun and Moon"/><ref name="The History of the Decline 1"/> The Four Shades are among the divine envoys.<ref name="Fontaine Wings" />
** ''Once upon a time, the people of the land could hear revelations from Celestia directly. The envoys of the gods walked among benighted humanity then.''<ref name="PTS"/><ref name="PFI"/> ''In those days, life was weak, and the earth was blanketed in unending ice.''<ref name="PTS"/> ''The eternal ice had just begun to thaw, and the first fires were still new.''<ref name="PFI"/> ''[...] the ancient flames were extinguished amidst the first falling rains.''<ref name="PFD"/> ''[...] the waters ran dry as thunder first pierced the skies.''<ref name="PFW"/>
* The nature of the world Celestia created was cyclical; humanity would thrive and prosper under Celestia's blessings before coming to an end, and then the earth would be renewed, and the cycle would begin again.<ref name="PTS"/> However, humanity was not meant to know this, so the heavenly envoys remained silent when people questioned how long their prosperity would last.<ref name="PFI"/><ref name="PFD"/>
** To receive answers from Celestia, the people appointed chief priests who, wearing a crown made of Irminsul branches, would head to the depths of the world to attain enlightenment.<ref name="PFI" /><ref name="PFD"/>
* Eventually, humanity grew prideful and ambitious and challenged the gods' authority. They sought to take the heavens for themselves and control their destinies, which angered Celestia and the heavenly envoys.<ref name="PFD" /><ref name="The History of the Decline 1" />
* There were three moons, who were sisters named [[Aria, Sonnet and Canon]]. They dwelled in the Lunar Palace, changing places three times a month to ride around the heavens in a silver carriage.<ref name="MBF"/><ref name="HSD3"/><ref group="Translation Note">The English localization of ''Moonlit Bamboo Forest (III)'' states that disaster would befall the world if the three sisters failed to switch places in time. This is a major misinterpretation of the original Chinese text, which says that they continued switching places up until the great disaster descended. (See [[Moonlit Bamboo Forest#Notes|Moonlit Bamboo Forest § Notes]] for details.)</ref>
*  Around this time existed the Angels (who would eventually turn into the [[Seelie]]), a race with beautiful, humanoid forms and great wisdom. They dwelled across the world and were tasked with guiding humanity. They built a large and prosperous civilization across the world and erected large palaces.<ref name="RJ - MS"/><ref name="ADT3"/><ref name=":0">Archon Quest, Chapter V, Act IV - ''The Rainbow Destined to Burn'', Part 1: ''[[Beneath the Secret Source]]''</ref><ref group="Translation Note">In the original Chinese text for ''A Drunkard's Tale (III)'', the sentence "This wasteland is said to be a land beyond the dominion of the deities, inhabited only by [...] fallen gods, where the former palaces of the Seelie now stand empty" refers to The Seven when it uses {{Lang|"deities"|zh=神|zh_tl=gods,}} juxtaposed against the term {{Lang|"fallen gods"|zh=魔神|zh_tl=demon god,}} a term which, at the time the book was released in-game, only referred to gods who lived before the end of the Archon War. It can thus be assumed that the Seelie civilization &mdash; and, by extension, primordial human civilization &mdash; spanned the entire world and not just the surface-level continent of Teyvat that The Seven now rule over.</ref>

==Great War of Vengeance==
''The term "great war of vengeance" is derived from [[Neuvillette]]'s [[Neuvillette/Lore#Vision|Vision]] Character Story.''

* The [[voyager]] returns to Teyvat only to find [[Nibelung]] missing, with the Heavenly Principles now in control of the world. The voyager decides to cast her consciousness into the body of a boy in the [[Hyperborea|Golden City]]. The [[First Angel]] falls in love with the [[voyager]], and together they pledge an oath of union to rebel against the Heavenly Principles.<ref name="Deep Gallery's Distant Pact"/><ref name="Deep Gallery's Echoing Song"/><ref name="RJ - MS"/>
** This meeting is witnessed by the three moon sisters [[Aria, Sonnet and Canon]].<ref name="RJ - MS"/>
*'''30 days after the pledge of union''' — The great war of vengeance begins.<ref name="RJ - MS"/><ref group="Assumption" name="Second Who Came">''[[Before Sun and Moon]]'' describes a war between the [[Primordial One]] and the [[Second Who Came]]. Although the Second Who Came's exact identity is unclear, it is assumed that this is the same war based on the timeline placement and matching descriptions of worldwide devestation.</ref>
** Dragon King Nibelung discovers the otherworldly power of [[forbidden knowledge]] and brings it to Teyvat, joining the war against the Heavenly Principles.<ref name="What Shape Does the Self Hold" /><ref name="An Omen of Annihilation and the Final Entreaty"/>
* '''~6000 years ago'''<ref name="Solar Relic"/><ref group="Note" name="Celestial Nails"/> — The Heavenly Principles emerges victorious and casts down the [[Celestial Nail]]s to purify the land of Teyvat from [[Abyss]]al corruption.<ref name="Deep Gallery's Moment of Oblivion"/><ref name="Amethyst Crown"/>
** The Heavenly Principles forbids knowledge of the history that predated this war.<ref name="3 Martial Trials"/>
** The first angel and the voyager attempt to flee, but are punished by the Heavenly Principles with eternal separation and a curse that robs them of their memories.<ref name="RJ - MS"/><ref name="ADT3"/><ref name="Deep Gallery's Moment of Oblivion"/>
*** The remainder of the [[Angels]] are similarly punished, turning into the small spirit-like [[Seelie]] that are seen today.<ref name="MBF"/><ref name=":0" /><ref name="Deep Gallery's Moment of Oblivion"/> Cursed to forget their pasts, they pursue the memories they have left by guiding travelers to their old dwelling places, the Seelie Courts.<ref name="RJ - MS"/>
**** Not all Angels withered away into Seelies; a few managed to retain their humanoid forms. After the fall of the Angels, a certain wolf-king (possibly [[Boreas]]) would meet one of its remnants who had not yet withered away, and befriended her.<ref name="ADT3"/> It is possible she is the "ancient god" from whom Boreas gained his god-like power.<ref name="Lupus Boreas"/>
**** A survivor of the Angel race, heavily implied to be [[Nabu Malikata]], went on to befriend [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] and [[King Deshret]].<ref name="For the Children of the Past"/><ref name="Staff of the Scarlet Sands2"/><ref name="Amethyst Crown"/>
*** The moon sisters [[Aria, Sonnet and Canon]] witness the disaster that befalls the first angel and the voyager from afar and mourn their fate. For unknown reasons, their silver carriage is "overturned" while the "hall of stars" is destroyed. The three sisters eventually turn on and kill each other as well. One of their corpses now remains as the sole moon.<ref name="MBF"/><ref name="Staff of the Scarlet Sands"/>
**** The wolves in Teyvat have a connection to the moon sisters and mourn their fate.<ref name="MBF"/>
**** The lost civilization that created the [[Spiral Abyss]] has heavy connections to the moon and the Moon Sisters.<ref name="Spiral Abyss"/>

* '''? years ago''' &mdash; The Beast of Thunder enslaved a group of people with lightning and wreaked havoc on the land. The Thundersoother, whose family was killed in some sort of sacrifice, went to the cave of the Beast of Thunder, which was either near or in a volcano. He fought and beheaded the Beast of Thunder, and received a crown for his accomplishment, but spent his final days in solitude.<ref name="Thundersoother"/>
* '''? years ago''' &mdash; The Berserker's homeland was consumed by flame during a war between gods and mortals. Seemingly the only survivor and a powerful warrior, the Berserker's iron mask was burned onto his face when his homeland fell and he went insane from the desire for revenge against Celestia. He went on a rampage, fighting humans, monsters and gods alike over time. At one point he even apparently fought a single giant monster for several years before killing it. However, it seems he eventually died, either in battle or after defeating whatever his last enemy was.<ref name="Berserker"/>

==Notes==
{{Reflist|note=1|refs=
--><ref group="Note" name="Archon War start">Occurred at some point before the destruction of [[Guili Assembly]] 3700 years.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Note" name="Celestial Nails">All Celestial Nails are implied to have been cast down simultaneously after the Heavenly Principles won the great war of vengeance. Therefore, this takes place at the same time as the creation of [[The Chasm]], which happened 6000 years ago.</ref><!--

Mondstadt transclusion notes
--><ref group="Note" name="Snow and strife">While snow and strife could be the interpretation and the result of the war between [[Decarabian]] and [[Boreas]] in the Archon War, the existence of the Celestial Nail meant that snow and strife were the results of the war between the [[Heavenly Principles]] and the [[Second Who Came]].</ref><!--
--><ref group="Note" name="Decarabian style">Ruins containing the ornamentation style found primarily in Stormterror's Lair can be seen across Brightcrown Mountains and Windwail Highland. It is unique from other ruins' ornamentation styles, making it easy to connect them.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Note" name="War start date ">The [[Biography of Gunnhildr]] gives the earliest known date for Boreas and Decarabian's war at 3000 years ago. However, this only records the start of the Gunnhildr Clan's story, so it may have begun well beforehand, while Venti's character stories give a more precise date for the fall of Old Mondstadt at 2600 years ago.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Note" name="First Field Tiller">It is unclear whether the first Field Tiller came to Mondstadt before or after the cataclysm. Barbara's story only vaguely frames the story between Decarabian's death and before the present day, and Boreas' account of his fight against the Field Tiller places it after he moved to [[Wolvendom]] &mdash; except there is no timeframe for that either. Note that [[Guizhong]], who lived far before Decarabian fell, had access to Ruin Guards and Ruin Hunters, so it is possible that the first Field Tiller wandered into Mondstadt before the cataclysm and not after it, like most other Ruin Guards.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Note" name="Defiled Statue">Since the Loom of Fate operation is still in its early stages in Present Day, the Defiled Statue was likely stolen somewhat recently. However, it was stolen long enough ago that Barbara says that it's an "old story" and happened "a long time ago."</ref><!--
--><ref group="Note" name="Kaeya's story"">It is currently unknown exactly when Kaeya told his story that happened "a decade ago" to the Grand Master.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Note" name="Crepus death">In the flashback, the pacing suggests that the battle with Ursa ends, Crepus collapses, Kaeya and other knights arrive at the scene, and Crepus dies in Diluc's arm's all in very short order, with no suggested timelapses. However, when Crepus dies in Diluc's arms, there is blood on Diluc's face that was not there when Crepus collapsed after the battle ended.</ref><!--
-->}}

===Lore Discrepancies===
{{Reflist|group=Lore Discrepancy|refs=<!--
Mondstadt transclusion notes
--><ref group="Lore Discrepancy" name="Rebellion knight">In [[Amos' Bow]]'s description and the ''The Boy and the Whirlwind'' trailer, both from the Closed Beta Test era, there were four leaders of the rebellion: the Nameless Bard, the elf/wind spirit, Amos, and the knight. Based on process of elimination, the red-haired man in the trailer was the knight. Much later, in [[Version 1.6]], [[Freedom-Sworn]] named the Red-Haired Warrior as a fifth leader and thus left the identity of the knight a mystery. Based on process of elimination again, the knight would probably be Gunnhildr, whose involvement in the rebellion was otherwise only attested to in [[Biography of Gunnhildr]].</ref><!--
--><ref group="Lore Discrepancy" name="Falcon of the West">The manga suggests that Vennessa became Falcon of the West after her ascension, but Venti's Character Tale depicts her as a mortal after the establishment of the Four Winds, which indicates that she was both while she was alive.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Lore Discrepancy" name="Rostam">[[Breeze Amidst the Forest#Vol. 2|Breeze Amidst the Forest]] appears to place Rostam's death (indicated by "The Lionfang Knight was without a suitable heir") before Barbatos and Dvalin began to fight Durin. However, [[Elegy for the End]] says that Rostam fought at the same time as Barbatos, Dvalin, and Durin and that Rostam died at around the same time Durin did.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Lore Discrepancy" name="Outrider">Amber's Character Story 3 and Vision Story conflict on whether she joined the Outriders before or after her grandfather's disappearance.<br>One possible resolution of this discrepancy is that trainee Outriders are not considered Outriders proper until they're no longer trainees, as Amber's Vision Story specifies that she officially became an Outrider after her grandfather's death while her Character Story 3 only says that she was admitted to the Outriders before her grandfather's death without specifying if being admitted to the Outriders means officially becoming an Outrider or if it can also mean being admitted as a trainee.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Lore Discrepancy" name="Crepus discrepancy">Crepus' death occurs 3 years before the manga's events while Diluc's character stories place it 4 years before the game's story, making the manga set roughly a year before the game. However, according to Diluc's stories, he returned to Mondstadt after Varka left on his expedition, making his return occur sometime within 6 months before the game's story. The message on the [[Cat's Tail Message Board#About Collei...|Cat's Tail Message Board]] about Collei says she was seen at the "last Ludi Harpastum" before the game's story, with no indication of how long ago it occurred.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Lore Discrepancy" name="Strange Vase">The Strange Vase exists in-game and is also referred to in [[A Child's Secret]]. However, the events of the manga happen in at least three days, which means that Diluc &mdash; who hosted a large party at the beginning of the manga with esteemed guests such as [[Seamus Pegg]] &mdash; had already been back in Mondstadt for at least three days by the time he received his Vision in the vase, conflicting with his [[Diluc/Lore#Vision|Vision story]], which says that he took up his Vision the same day he returned to Mondstadt.</ref><!--
-->}}

===Translation Notes===
{{Reflist|group=Translation Note|refs=<!--
Mondstadt transclusion notes
--><ref group="Translation Note" name="Blizzard">The original Chinese version of "This land was once a realm of sub-zero blizzards and ice storms filled with razor-sharp ice shards, all at the command of Boreas" uses a more passive tone which suggests that Boreas did not actively will it, but rather caused it simply by existing.<br>Chinese text: {{zh|这片大地上曾经北风呼啸，呼气凝霜。|tl=Long ago did the North Wind howl on this land, his breath congealing into frost.}}</ref><!--
--><ref group="Translation Note" name="Difficult time for Mondstadt">In [[Breeze Amidst the Forest#Vol. 2|Breeze Amidst the Forest]], the English translation treats the paragraph beginning with "It was an especially difficult time for Mondstadt." as a cause and the paragraph beginning with "The prayers of Mondstadt's people awoke the Anemo Archon" as the effect. However, the original Chinese text treats them more like two descriptions of events that happened in the same timeframe instead of cause and effect.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Translation Note" name="Jacob Musk">The original Chinese text attributes "An Investigation into the Cultural Customs of the Wind Kingdom" to an unspecified [[Musk Family]] member; Jacob Musk is not specified like he is in English.</ref><!--
-->}}

===Editors' Assumptions===
{{Reflist|group=Assumption|refs=<!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Istaroth">In ''Before Sun and Moon'', the author claims during "The First Year of Darkness" that the Heavenly Principles and its "three other" shining shades did not hear their lamentation, leaving one shade unaccounted for. In "The Third Year of Darkness," the author calls Istaroth the "only one who had not forsaken us," making her the shade that (they believe) heard them.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Kamera assumption">The [[Sacred Sakura Cleansing Ritual]] World Quest series reveals that Kameras existed 500 years ago, and the [[Memento Lens]] was built for such a device. However, that technology was lost over time. It is unclear whether Fontaine's Kamera was built using restored ancient technology or if it was created independently.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Sibling">For the [[Traveler's sibling]] to have come across the midst of the cataclysm, they would have needed to travel the world at least for a period of time beforehand. However, because they only have started their journey around [[Teyvat]] with [[Dainsleif]] after the cataclysm, this means that they must have either only briefly explored the land beforehand, or went on their own journey, which of the latter is not documented anywhere inside of the storyline.</ref><!--

Mondstadt transclusion notes
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Kings of Ice and Frost">According to Fragment of Decarabian's Epic, Boreas declared war on Decarabian but was unable to break through Decarabian's storm wall. However, there is currently no in-game reference to Decarabian's response towards Boreas. It can be assumed that Decarabian either had no interest in fighting Boreas or was equally incapable of overcoming the other god. Boreas eventually chose to die of his own volition while Decarabian was slain by humans and the wind spirit, leaving their conflict a draw.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Wind spirit">The wind spirit who saved Gunnhildr's Clan is not explicitly stated to be Barbatos. At the same time, there is no evidence that suggests they worshipped another wind spirit, and there is too little information about the God of Time to draw any conclusions about them.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Leonard">Assuming Barbatos terraformed Mondstadt shortly after his ascension, Leonard's attempt to scale Pilos Peak must have come before 2600 years ago, even though Mona rounds his time period down to 2000 years ago. He also mentions [[Venerare]], the leader of the [[Lawrence Clan]] at the start of Barbatos' Mondstadt, which means he had to have lived around the end of Decarabian's Mondstadt.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Boreas death">It is unknown when Boreas died. The land outside of Decarabian's Mondstadt was a snowy wasteland, which would indicate that Boreas had not yet let his powers flow into the land to nourish it, but Barbatos became Anemo Archon shortly after Decarabian fell, which suggests that Boreas had already chosen to remove himself from the Archon War via death by the time Barbatos rose.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Hexenzirkel">Based on the frequency of Barbatos's descent and the Hexenzirkel's possible time frame, the event has been tentatively put here without clear evidence. One of Alice's titles, "Defender of Old Mondstadt," might have been coined during this event.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Ingbert">Ingbert is never specified to be an allogene. However, [[Ragged Records]] refers to someone as one of "the chosen"; this must be Ingbert, based on [[Ancient Investigation Journal: Part III]]. So far, those who are referred to as "chosen" are largely, if not exclusively, Vision bearers.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Wanderer's Troupe disbanding">No dates have been specified for the Wanderer's Troupe's active period, but it disbanded a few years before Vennessa's rebellion at most. Ragnvindr and Kreuzleid were both around for the fall of the Troupe and would later assist Vennessa's rebellion.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Vennessa's rebellion">It is unclear when Vennessa's rebellion occurred relative to the failed Dragonspine expedition, but it likely came afterwards or coincided with it at earliest. Vennessa offends Barca on the last day of Ludi Harpastum, after which she was purchased by Lord Lawrence and sentenced to do battle in the arena to win her freedom, but we don't know how long those battles took.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Rosalyne">As Rosalyne set out to burn demons and monsters, the cataclysm may have still been ongoing when she became the Crimson Witch of Flame.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Crimson Witch">The lands that the Crimson Witch of Flame burned are unspecified, but as Rosalyne lived in Mondstadt and learned of Rostam's death upon her return to Mondstadt, it is assumed that Pierro found the Crimson Witch of Flame in Mondstadt. The exact time he found her is also unknown, but since the Tsaritsa sent Pierro to recruit for the Fatui in response to the cataclysm and the Crimson Witch of Flame was being burned alive by the very flames she turned herself into, Pierro must have found the Crimson Witch of Flame shortly after the cataclysm.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Eroch">In the manga, Amber mentions that she overheard the argument between Eroch and Diluc while hiding in a cupboard to prank her grandfather, indicating that he hadn't resigned at the time of Crepus' death.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Albedo joining the Knights">It is unclear when exactly Albedo joined the Knights of Favonius, but between Albedo's [[Albedo/Lore#Character Story 2|second character story]] and Klee's [[Klee/Lore#Character Story 1|first character story]], it appears they came to Mondstadt around the same time.</ref><!--

Liyue transclusion refs
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Unified civilization">It is presumed that this civilization was likely part of the same unified civilization as [[Enkanomiya]] due to the identical architecture.</ref><!--

Fontaine transclusion refs
--><ref group="Assumption" name="499 years">Assuming that each "scene" is a day, these events happened 182,376 days, or over 499 years and 3 months, before ''[[The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur]]''. However, the in-universe date of that quest is not known, and [[Bennett]]'s birthday and his mails imply that the {{w|civil calendar}} used by Teyvat is either the {{w|Julian calendar}} or the {{w|Gregorian calendar}} without making it clear which one is being used. As a result, it is unclear how many days beyond 499 years and 3 months passed.</ref><!--
--><ref group="Assumption" name="Hydro Sovereign">As Neuvillette has memories of the "great war of vengeance", this makes it the earliest point in time when the original Dragon of Water could have died. As Egeria's existence prevents the rebirth of a new Hydro Dragon, there is little possibility for an incarnation to have been born between the original one and Neuvilette's present form.</ref><!--
