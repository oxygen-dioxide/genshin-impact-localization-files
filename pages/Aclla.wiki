{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Aclla:''' Hi there, what can I help you with?
:'''Aclla''': Or is there anything you wanted to help the Scions of the Canopy with?
:{{DIcon|Reputation}} About my reputation with the Scions of the Canopy... ''(Available after unlocking [[Tribe Reputation]])''
::'''Aclla:''' So you really are a helper after all! Thank you so much!
:;(Opens Huitzlan<nowiki>:</nowiki> Scions of the Canopy Reputation menu)
:{{DIcon}} Hello. What did you mean when you said "help"? ''(Available after unlocking Tribe Reputation)''
::'''Aclla:''' Ah, let me explain. Often, members of the tribe just have too much on their hands, so some turn into commissions that are open to outsiders as well.
::'''Aclla:''' Anyone who wants to take on a commission can just come here, to the Obsidian Totem Pole.
::'''Aclla:''' Naturally, you'll be compensated for completing commissions! Feel free to stop by and help!
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Aclla:''' I'm a vet who specializes in treating [[Saurian]]s. Pleasure to meet you!
::'''Aclla:''' Haha, it may sound cool, but I really just give baby Saurians their meds and talk to them. At most, I could be considered a medical intern.
::'''Aclla:''' For seriously injured Saurians, it's best if you see a professional Sauro-vet.
::'''Aclla:''' Like [[Ifa]], from the Flower-Feather Clan! If you give him a call, he'll rush right on over!
::'''Aclla:''' Of course, I've got some pretty neat talents too! You know how [[Yumkasaur]]s usually don't like being around people? Well, they don't mind me!
::'''Aclla:''' Sometimes, just spending time with them is a kind of healing.
:{{DIcon}} I've got other things to do right now...
::'''Aclla:''' Take care, then.
