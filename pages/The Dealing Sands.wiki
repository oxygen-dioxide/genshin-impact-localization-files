{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the tent area)
:'''Paimon:''' Oh no! What's going on over there? Seems like there's fighting going on!

;(After defeating the Treasure Hoarders)
:'''Iron Dou'er:''' Pah! These Fontainian frogs done near bumped me off!
:'''Iron Dou'er:''' We drink out of the same bottle, yeah? We don't say "thanks" for such big favors, you're ever in a jam, you just holler and it'll be done in a flash!
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, you're pretty polite!
:{{DIcon}} I'll get to the point then. I've been a little tight on money lately.
::'''Iron Dou'er:''' You need Mora? Haha, well, funny thing is, there could be a little problem with that&mdash;
::'''Iron Dou'er:''' Our Mora? The big cheese took it all. We been down on our uppers, flat broke here.
::{{DIcon}} Big Cheese?
:{{DIcon}} Just doing my part to uphold justice.
::'''Iron Dou'er:''' Supremely honorable! Righteous beyond measure! In that case, I got something juicy to tell both of you.
::'''Iron Dou'er:''' Our big cheese... He's probably in a jam himself, probably needs some help, yeah?
::{{DIcon}} Big Cheese?
:'''Iron Dou'er:''' Our Boss, the leader of us Iron and Salt Gang. He's with a bunch of Fontainian cats down at the bottom of the cliff over there, left us behind to hold down the fort.
:'''Iron Dou'er:''' But you saw what happened too, right? Those Fontainian frogs snuck in while the big shot was away and stabbed us in the butt, really put the screws to us!
:'''Paimon:''' Eek... Stabbed you in the butt...!
:{{DIcon}} Yikes...!
:'''Iron Dou'er:''' Brat! Really trying to take us for a ride?
:'''Iron Dou'er:''' Since they tipped their mitts and showed their mugs here, our Boss is probably gonna get double-crossed too. Whaddaya say, bo? In for a Mora, in for the lot, you wouldn't back out now, would ya?
:'''Iron Dou'er:''' As long as Boss is safe, you're guaranteed the swankiest of meals, and can live the good life!
:{{DIcon}} Where is he? I'll go check it out.
:'''Iron Dou'er:''' On that beach beneath the cliff. You'll see when you get there.
:'''Iron Dou'er:''' I'll leave you to it, and be on over after I finish here.

;(Talk to Iron Dou'er again, optional)
:'''Iron Dou'er:''' C'mon, fellas! Rip the clothes off these Fontainian frogs! Shirts, jackets, don't leave a thread on them!

;(Talk to Iron Men'er again, optional)
:'''Iron Men'er:''' Curse that Fontainian Pinky Club, they got no respect for rules! Quick, someone tells the big cheese something fishy is going on!

;(Talk to Iron Shan'er again, optional)
:'''Iron Shan'er:''' We've been caught in a pickle! Nearly zotzed...
----
;(Approach the beach area)
:'''Paimon:''' Look! There are so many people on the beach there!
:'''Paimon:''' That must be the head of the gang that Iron Dou'er mentioned, along with the others!

;(Approach the Treasure Hoarders)
:'''Iron Ming:''' We've been pals, Johnnie, so I get the pickle you've found yourself in lately.
:'''Iron Ming:''' You could've just talked to me straight, but causing a mess like this... It's enough to break my heart.
:'''Johnnie:''' Well, pal, you know business as usual is no longer the usual over here. The Spina di Rosula's on the rise, and my brothers are a bit out of sorts...
:'''Johnnie:''' But I still got to look after all the birds in my crew. If this keeps up, they won't even get crumbs...
:'''Johnnie:''' We got good business going between us, it's pretty reasonable, but if you can give us more... I'm sure we all know I'll scratch your back in the future.
:'''Johnnie:''' If not... Haha, there are plenty of other fish in the sea, Iron Ming, it's not like you can't find new friends!
:'''Iron Ming:''' So I take it that means this is your final offer, right, Johnnie?
:'''Johnnie:''' You got a problem with what I'm offering?
:'''Iron Chuan'er:''' You kidding me, Mr. Fontainer? Just tell us what you're up to! Who are you trying to steal from with this little money? Stop shouting nonsense!
:'''Iron Ming:''' Shut it!
:'''Iron Ming:''' Listen, Johnnie, the Don Pesci family pays me 58 thou a box, and the De Niro 70 thou. I shouldn't have to tell you just how big they are in Lumidouce Harbor, yeah?
:'''Iron Ming:''' But for you, I only asked for a hundred grand for three boxes, and even threw in special pick-up and delivery service on top... Now why do I do that? Because I cherish you as a friend.
:'''Iron Ming:''' No need for me to harp on all that... I'm sure you just didn't think it through! Let's find a place to drink while we talk, eh?
:'''Johnnie:''' Hehe, I don't need all that. I know how you Liyue people get about contracts. Since the point of contracts is fairness, I don't think friendship supersedes that.
:'''Iron Ming:''' Hehe, Brother Johnnie! Someone who understands the spirit of contracts so well... My men ought to learn from you, ha!
:'''Iron Ming:''' It's just that... at least on this matter, I'd like to see you guys respect the contract more.
:'''Johnnie:''' Of course, of course! You're being more than reasonable, and the ancient Liyue tradition of upholding contracts is something we can all admire. I suppose I must find a way to prove my sincerity.
:'''Johnnie:''' Walker, you think we can raise our offer... say, one Mora per item?
:'''Walker:''' That's very generous, Mr. Johnnie. These good people of Liyue have worked so hard for us, so we do owe them one extra Mora per item.
:'''Iron Chuan'er:''' Fontainian frogs! Just what are you trying to pull here!?
:'''Johnnie:''' Come on, old pal, can't you just feel my sincerity radiating off of me from where you're standing?
:'''Iron Ming:''' I take it you're gonna breach our agreement, then, Johnnie?
:'''Johnnie:''' Oh? Am I? What do you think, Walker?
:'''Walker:''' Mr. Johnnie, there's plenty of other fish in the sea, if you ask me. Any minnow should know that.
:'''Johnnie:''' I'm ashamed of you, Walker. How could you insult our Liyue friend like that?
:'''Johnnie:''' I mean, we're going to take over their turf soon anyway, shouldn't we show a bit of gratitude?
:'''Walker:''' Sorry, Mr. Johnnie.
:'''Iron Chuan'er:''' You slippery bastards! The audacity to plan something like that...
:{{DIcon}} Whoa, calm down with the insults! No need to be rude.
:'''Johnnie:''' Hey, who are the two youngsters...?
:'''Johnnie:''' Well, now this is interesting. Are all Liyue little children brave like them? Walker!
:'''Walker:''' Hey, where did you snotty kids come from? Here's some Mora. Now scram, run on back to your mommies!
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Don't any of you have any manners?
:'''Iron Ming:''' And who are you two...?
:{{DIcon}} We're here for a super swanky meal.
:{{DIcon}} We're here to make certain somebodies run on back to their mommies.
:'''Johnnie:''' Hahaha! From the sound of it... Looks like you're Mr. Iron Ming's rusted little help?
:'''Johnnie:''' So, you had the same idea too, eh, Mr. Iron Ming? Well, we didn't exactly come unprepared. Walker!
:'''Walker:''' Come out, boys, it's time!
:'''Iron Chuan'er:''' What!?
:'''Johnnie:''' Oh dearie me, guess what? I think we have more people on our side.
:'''Johnnie:''' I am so, so sorry, Mr. Iron Ming. Before our little meeting, I made prior arrangements to have the people guarding your camp taken care of.
:'''Johnnie:''' Now it's your turn. I'll make sure your business is in good hands.
:'''Iron Ming:''' "Boss" Johnnie... If you wanna get a slant at our business, it won't be duck soup!
:'''Johnnie:''' Well, I hope you can back up your tough talk. Get him!

;(During the battle)
:'''Johnnie:''' Comrades! Let's get 'em!
:'''Johnnie:''' Hey! Why aren't you guys doing anything!?

;(The two thugs get replaced by Iron Dou'er and Iron Chuan'er)
:'''Iron Dou'er:''' Hahahaha! Little Fontainian frog! Open your beady little eyes and take a look! Who do you think we are!?
:'''Johnnie:''' Wha... when!? What about our people?
:'''Iron Dou'er:''' Them patsies already been taken care of nice and clean, ya follow? Tryin' to take the Iron and Salt Gang for a ride, aren't ya, wise guy? We gonna get gashouse on you!
----
;(After finishing the battle)
:'''Iron Ming:''' Two incredible heroes! I am in your debt!
:'''Paimon:''' It's quite alright! No matter where you make a deal, you should always honor your contract!
:'''Iron Ming:''' Hehe, this little {{MC|m=hero|f=heroine}}'s got the picture! Still, you two seem wise to our deal. Why?
:'''Paimon:''' Iron Dou'er told us about it. She said you were bootlegging or somesuch...
:'''Paimon:''' But what does "bootleg" mean?
:{{DIcon}} Some sort of illegal transaction.
:'''Iron Ming:''' In that case, I must repay you two chivalrous heroes.
:'''Iron Ming:''' Boys! Come truss them up nice and tight and toss them into the sea!
:'''Iron Ming:''' Be sure to tie a few extra rocks to them, too. They did us Iron and Salt Gang a big favor, so let's not make them suffer more than they should!
:'''Paimon:''' What!? You... You want to do WHAT to us!?
:'''Iron Ming:''' My dear little hero, from what you just said, I would've thought you'd understand. Liyue is indeed a place very particular about contracts.
:'''Iron Ming:''' And walking in on a transaction between outlaws means you get silenced. Surely that is an unspoken contract known to all?
:'''Paimon:''' There's no such thing as that contract! Repaying our kindness with murder is the real breach of contract here!
:'''Iron Ming:''' Please don't make this harder on yourselves. If I have to do it myself, you'll be in for a world of hurt.
:{{DIcon}} Do you know who I am?
:{{DIcon}} Oh no, I'm shaking in my boots!
:'''Iron Ming:''' Shut up! Iron Dou'er, Iron Chuan'er, just what are you waiting for? Get them!
:'''Iron Chuan'er:''' Boss Iron Ming... You really are heartless. Unjust.
:'''Iron Dou'er:''' As long as we can stop villains like you from befouling Liyue with your criminal conduct, all of our efforts will have been worth it.
:'''Iron Dou'er:''' Round 'em up!
:'''Iron Ming:''' Wh&mdash;What...!?
:'''Iron Dou'er:''' Iron Ming, you lowly scum! Open your eyes and take a good look at us! Who are we?
:'''Iron Ming:''' M&mdash;Millelith!?
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, whoa, slow down a sec! What's going on? Why the sudden...
:'''Iron Ming:''' I thought you were just newbies, I never imagined you were a bunch of cursed sleuths...
:'''Iron Ming:''' Don't count on me going quietly! Bring it on!
----
;(After defeating Iron Ming)
:'''Iron Chuan'er:''' This trip was really worth it! Not only did we get who we came for, but we also got to meet the famous Traveler.
:{{DIcon}} You know us?
:'''Iron Dou'er:''' Of course. I have relatives in Liyue Harbor, and I've heard all about you, so I recognized you from the get-go.
:'''Iron Dou'er:''' But there were too many ears around, and I didn't want to risk spooking them, so I didn't come clean. Sorry about that.
:'''Paimon:''' So it wasn't an illegal deal we butted in on, but a bust?
:'''Iron Chuan'er:''' Correct. We've had our eyes on these smugglers for a while now, but only managed to infiltrate them recently with a bit of timely assistance.
:'''Iron Chuan'er:''' It's been about a month since then, but today we finally got the opportunity to nab the Iron and Salt Gang and the big Fontainian fish all in one fell swoop.
:'''Iron Dou'er:''' Not to mention the fact that those Fontaine fellows almost wiped us out with their dirty tricks. We were fortunate to have your help, Traveler.
:'''Iron Dou'er:''' Unfortunately, you'll have to take a rain check on the swanky feast we promised. However, we do have some Mora for you. Please, take it.
:'''Iron Dou'er:''' And don't even think about saying no. You should be rewarded for helping others. That's the contract we should all uphold. Otherwise, in the future, fewer and fewer people will be willing to extend the hand to those in need.
:'''Iron Chuan'er:''' Okay, we should probably clean the rest of this up. We won't hold you up any longer.
:'''Iron Chuan'er:''' Best of luck to you both!
----
;(Talk to Iron Chuan'er or Iron Dou'er again)
:'''Iron Chuan'er:''' Traveler! You came too.
:'''Iron Dou'er:''' Don't worry, we'll take care of the rest. These gangsters won't make trouble in Liyue again.
