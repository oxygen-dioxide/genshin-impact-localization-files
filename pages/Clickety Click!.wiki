{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Susan)
:'''Susan:''' The scenery here is rather lovely. If only someone was around to take a picture for me...
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
:'''Susan:''' Oh, are you the Traveler? Great! I was just looking for someone to help me out.
:'''Susan:''' My husband and I were stuck in Inazuma for such a long time due to the [[Sakoku Decree]]. But those days are over &mdash; we were finally able to travel to Sumeru!
:'''Susan:''' Ah, the very thought of being trapped in one place for so long... I told my husband that we should visit various places here in Sumeru to relax a little...
:'''Susan:''' But he claimed that he was far too busy clearing his work backlog. He would not go out the door for the world! So there we go &mdash; that's why I'm here all by my lonesome.
:'''Susan:''' And wouldn't you know it? No one was available to help me take some photographs. I had wanted to take some photos for my husband to see as well.
:'''Susan:''' But since you're here, Traveler, may I ask you to help me take some pictures?
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
:'''Susan:''' Alright then, I'm counting on you, Traveler.
:'''Susan:''' How will this angle do? Should it be a bit more centered?
:'''Susan:''' Okay, I'm ready now!

;(Talk to Susan again after taking a picture of her)
:'''Susan:''' Have you finished taking the pictures? Let me have a look at them.
:'''Susan:''' Ah, wonderful. My beauty is indeed as radiant as ever, hahaha!
:{{DIcon}} Even more so than before, I'd say.
:'''Susan:''' Oh, you and your silver tongue! Still, thank you, Traveler.
:'''Susan:''' Come! This is your reward for pictures of me. Here you go!
