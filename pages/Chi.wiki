{{Lang|'''Chi'''|zh=螭|zh_rm=Chī}}, known as {{Lang|'''Qingce'''|zh=轻策|zh_rm=Qīngcè}} in the ancient language,<ref>{{Ref/Book|Diary of Roald the Adventurer|2|title=Qingce Village}}</ref> are a type of [[dragon]]-like sea monster that lived around the [[Liyue]] region and the oceans beyond it.<ref name="Serpent Spine">{{Ref/Weapon|Serpent Spine}}</ref>

One lived in [[Qingce Village]] before being defeated by [[Morax]], and the legends surrounding it are detailed in the [[World Quest]] "[[The Chi of Yore]]."

==The Chi of Mt. Qingce==
Thousands of years ago, Chi made its nest in the area now known as Mt. Qingce and took control of the region. For this, [[Morax]] fought it at a "great height" and succeeded in slaying the beast. However, even after its death, the Chi's power continued to seep into the land. To suppress its power, Morax defeated each aspect of the Chi:

{{Quote|...Rex Lapis overcame the Chi, but the Chi could not perish in its entirety. Thus did Rex Lapis conquer each of its facets in turn: its spirit was bound in the north, its bones were pinned in the south-east, its flesh was incarcerated in the north-west, its soul was fettered in the north-east, and its form was crushed in the south-west...|Incomplete Writing at Qingce Village}}

Additionally, Morax taught the people of Qingce Village to make Geo Statues to crush the Chi's remaining power. Many of these statues can be found scattered across the area around Qingce Village, some of which have glowing features for unknown reasons. Additionally, crystalline orange adeptus amber can also be found around Qingce, which also helps suppress and crush the Chi's power.<ref>{{Ref/Furnishing|Adeptus Amber: A Striking Sight}}</ref>

Over time, a legend formed that the Chi's body turned into Mt. Qingce after it died, with its scales forming the terraced fields. People in Liyue believe that the Blood-Fed Trees in [[Bishui Plain]] grew by absorbing the Chi's blood, and that the area where they grew are the Chi's eyes. However, [[Zhongli]] reveals that Mt. Qingce stood long before Chi ravaged the area.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Stars Inscribe the Year's Wishes|note=Zhongli's open world dialogue}}</ref>

During the World Quest "[[The Chi of Yore]]," the [[Traveler]] enters the vault in northwestern Qingce. Within it is a giant glowing orb suspended in midair, underneath which is the Qingce Cache mechanism. Upon activating the mechanism, the Traveler has to defend the mechanism from various [[Ruin Machines]] while rocks crash down from the ceiling. After completing the challenge, the treasure room is opened, but the Traveler and [[Paimon]] report to Granny Ruoxin that no traces of Chi were found, leaving the glowing orb within the vault a mystery.

==Other Chi==
The [[Skipper]], who lived around a thousand years ago, defeated at least one Chi and turned its spine into his greatsword, known as {{Lang|[[Serpent Spine]]|zh=螭骨剑|zh_tl=Chi Spine Sword}}.<ref name="Serpent Spine" />

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
*In Chinese mythology, {{zh|{{wt|螭||Chinese}}|rm=chi}} is a type of hornless dragon-like creature. It can alternatively mean "mountain demon."
**It is contrasted with {{zh|{{wt|虯|虬|Chinese}}|rm=qiú}}, a type of horned dragon (though some classical texts call it a hornless dragon as well). Another sea monster named {{Lang|Baqiu|zh=八虬|zh_rm=Bāqiú}} is mentioned in the description of [[Primordial Jade Winged-Spear]].
*Both the words {{Lang|Chi|zh=螭}} and {{Lang|Zhongli|zh=钟离}} contain the component {{zh|离}} which can be pronounced ''li'' or ''chi'' depending on the specific context. The {{zh|离}} can also refer to a mythical beast.
