|description    = A sly animal as elusive as a fairy that often appears in folk stories, symbolizing unusual cunning and ancient memories.<br>Its coat of thick, white fur helps conceal it amongst the snow. Living in harsh environments has sharpened both its wits and sense of smell.<br>Even in the jade fields of the Realm Within, the whereabouts of the Snow Foxes are constantly changing and unpredictable. They sometimes jump out of the bushes suddenly, giving [[Tubby]] a shock and waking her from her slumber.
