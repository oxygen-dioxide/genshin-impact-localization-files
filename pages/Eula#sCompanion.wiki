{{Dialogue start}}
:{{A|vo eula mimitomo hello 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Oh, (Traveler), it's you? What is it?
:{{DIcon}} How do you like it here?
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship1 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Huh, what kind of question is that?
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship1 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I'm certainly not someone who's good at handing out compliments.
::{{DIcon}} I just want to know your feelings.
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship1 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' ...Pointless. You think I'm some kind of tender soul?
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship1 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Neither good nor bad. There you go.
::{{DIcon}} Is that so?
::{{DIcon}} You clearly had a gentle expression before...
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship1 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Hey, have you been watching me while I'm not looking?
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship1 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' (Darn it... How did I not notice?)
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship1 07.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Anyway... Vengeance will be mine.
;(Unlocks at Friendship Level 4)
:{{DIcon}} Would you like to have a chat with me?
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship2 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Didn't think you were the type to get bored... Sure, speak.
::{{DIcon}} Anything happen recently that makes you want to seek vengeance?
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship2 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Hmm... Let me think.
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship2 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Not long ago, I took on an assignment to clear out some nearby Treasure Hoarders.
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship2 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' On my way back, I rescued a Springvale hunter who was being attacked by a monster.
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship2 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' ... I didn't expect him to send meat and wine the next day.
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship2 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Daring to send things despite knowing that I'm the heir to the sinners of Mondstadt... I'll remember this insult.
::{{DIcon}} An insult worth remembering.
:::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship2 07a 1.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Not just that.
:::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship2 07a 2.ogg}} '''Eula:''' The meat was so good that I ate too much and got a stomach ache, so I couldn't properly enjoy the wine...
:::{{DIcon}} This deserves some more vengeance.
:::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship2 08a.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Haha, we're of the same mind.
::{{DIcon}} You weren't injured, were you?
:::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship2 07b 1.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Ha, a small fry like that monster can't hurt me.
:::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship2 07b 2.ogg}} '''Eula:''' However, the meat was so good that I ate too much and got a stomach ache, so I couldn't properly enjoy the wine...
:::{{DIcon}} It was that delicious? I want some too...
:::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship2 08b.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Hahaha, best not. If you really want... I'll make a Stormcrest Pie for you.
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship2 09.ogg}} '''Eula:''' ...
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship2 10.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Just this simple chat with you has made me feel a lot better...
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship2 11.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Ahem... Thanks.
;(Unlocks at Friendship Level 7)
:{{DIcon}} Is there anything you'd like to do?
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship3 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' That I'd like to do? Why are you asking?
::{{DIcon}} Because I want to accompany you.
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship3 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' ...
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship3 03.ogg}} '''Eula:''' What a weird statement.
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship3 04.ogg}} '''Eula:''' If that's the case, then let me teach you how to dance. Specifically, the "Dance of Sacrifice."
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship3 05.ogg}} '''Eula:''' I told you, I've incorporated dance into my sword play. If you want to learn my sword techniques, you'll need to learn to dance first.
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship3 06.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Actually, dance is also my favorite artistic pastime...
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship3 07.ogg}} '''Eula:''' It's time for you to learn.
::{{DIcon}} Is there a duet?
:::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship3 08a 1.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Practice your basic dance steps first, then we'll talk.
:::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship3 08a 2.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Such avarice. I ought to reserve the darkest and most grievous of vengeance for you...
::{{DIcon}} If I step on your feet...
:::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship3 08b.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Then I ought to reserve the darkest and most grievous of vengeance for you...
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship3 09.ogg}} '''Eula:''' But thinking about it... Since we're already this far, then I'll turn a blind eye to any new grievance.
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo friendship3 10.ogg}} '''Eula:''' After all, my vengeance for you runs deep... It has long been inextricable.
;<nowiki>(Between 6:00 and 19:00)</nowiki>
:{{DIcon}} Good morning, Eula.
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo morning 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Ah... Morning.
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo morning 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Remember, I have yet to enact vengeance upon you... You better return in one piece, (Traveler).
;<nowiki>(Between 19:00 and 6:00)</nowiki>
:{{DIcon}} Good night, Eula.
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo night 01.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Good night, (Traveler).
::{{A|vo eula mimitomo night 02.ogg}} '''Eula:''' Someone as purehearted as you probably sleeps better than anyone else...
