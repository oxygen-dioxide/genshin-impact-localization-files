|text1    = If you wish to restore the Warding Stones' functionality and suppress the storm once more, you must find and touch the three sets of paper charms hung on poles that correspond to each Warding Stone. You must recall the positions of each set of paper charms, and the number of paper charms on each pole.

|text3    = Rotate the Warding Stones such that the number of paper charms on the sections of the Stone that correspond to the three poles match the number of charms placed there. Once you rotate the Warding Stone sections such that this correspondence is perfect, the seal upon it shall be reinstated.
