==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Shirahama:''' I've got to find a chance to cook a hot spring egg all by myself...
:{{DIcon}} Hot spring egg?
::'''Shirahama:''' Yeah! If you're already here at the hot springs, you've got to complete the experience with a hot spring egg!
::'''Shirahama:''' The first time I tried to do it, I found the temperature of the artificial springs to be too low, but the staff wouldn't let me into the natural pools.
::'''Shirahama:''' So I asked a local to help me cook one in the hottest natural pool!
::'''Shirahama:''' Hehe, so I've finally gotten to taste a bona fide hot spring egg! I'm not sure if it's just because I've hyped it up, but it really tasted a lot better than your average semi-cooked egg.
::'''Shirahama:''' Still, I really want to cook one for myself. I'll find a way...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Haha, now I want to try some.
::'''Shirahama:''' Oh, trust me, the texture's super smooth &mdash; definitely worth a go!
::'''Shirahama:''' C'mon, I'll share some eggs with you. This is a must-try!
::;(Obtain {{Item|Bird Egg|20|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Shirahama:''' See you! Don't forget to try a hot spring egg!
