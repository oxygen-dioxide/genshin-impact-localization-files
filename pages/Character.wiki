==Progression==
===Leveling===
{{Main|Character EXP}}
Characters gain [[Character EXP]] primarily by using [[Character EXP Material]]s, as well as negligible amounts of experience for defeating monsters.

The Archon Quests in the Prologue - ''[[Wanderer's Trail]]'', Act I - ''[[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]]'' and Act II - ''[[For a Tomorrow Without Tears]]'' of the [[Prologue]] also reward Character EXP.

===Ascensions===
[[File:Icon Ascend.png|thumb|right]]
{{See also|Character/Comparison#Base Stats|l1=Character Ascension Stat}}
Characters can be ascended to their next ascension phase once they reach their current max level and the player has the required [[Adventure Rank]]. Characters can be ascended up to 6 times (up to Lv. 90).

To ascend a character, go to the character screen and click on the ''Ascend'' button at the bottom-right of the Character Menu. A box will appear, showing which [[Character Ascension Material]]s, [[Local Specialties]], and [[Character and Weapon Enhancement Material]]s are needed, and the [[Mora]] cost required to ascend the character. If there is an item missing, click on it to see various ways to obtain it. See each character's page for the materials needed for each ascension.
[[File:Icon Ascension Materials Preview.png|thumb|right]]
Upon reaching the 1st and 4th ascension, the character unlocks their 1st and 2nd passive combat talents respectively. The 3rd passive utility talent (available to all characters, except the [[Traveler]]) is already unlocked without any ascensions.

On the 2nd ascension, the character gains a special flat bonus attribute boost, either for one of their base attributes (e.g. the [[Traveler]] gains a bonus to their ATK value) or a special attribute (e.g. [[Ningguang]] gains a {{Color|Geo DMG Bonus}} while [[Lisa]] gains an Elemental Mastery bonus). This bonus further increases upon the 3rd, 5th, and 6th ascension.

Ascending characters to their 1st, 3rd, and 5th phase will reward the player with one [[Acquaint Fate]].

===Talents===
{{Main|Talent}}
Most characters have a total of 3 [[Combat Talent]]s and 3 [[Passive Talent]]s. Combat Talents, which include [[Normal Attack]], [[Elemental Skill]], and [[Elemental Burst]], and can be leveled from Lv. 1 to Lv. 10, while Passive Talents, which include [[1st Ascension Passive]], [[4th Ascension Passive]], [[Utility Passive]], cannot be leveled. Increasing the level can increase the scaling and effects of Combat Talents.

===Constellations===
{{Main|Constellation}}
Each character has a total of 6 '''Constellations''', which are similar to their Passive [[Talents]] and increase the effectiveness of the character or add new capabilities.

In order to unlock each Constellation of a character, a player must use a [[Stella Fortuna]] for that specific character. Players can obtain a character's Stella Fortuna by wishing a duplicate of the character in [[Wishes]] or buying the character from [[Paimon's Bargains]]. The [[Traveler]]'s Constellations are unique in that they are unlocked not through the above systems, but through [[Archon Quests]], [[Adventure Rank]] [[Adventure Rank#Adventurers.27 Guild Rewards|Rewards]] ([[Anemo]] only), by offering [[Oculi]] to [[Statue of The Seven]] ([[Electro]] and [[Dendro]]) and [[Souvenir Shop]]s instead.
