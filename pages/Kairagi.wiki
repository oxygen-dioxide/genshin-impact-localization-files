<!--{{Description|(Content here)}}-->
{{Lang|'''Kairagi'''|ja=海乱鬼|ja_rm=Kairagi}}, are a type of [[Nobushi]]. [[Ochimusha]] are ghostly versions of Kairagi and are special one-time enemies.

In combat, Kairagi are durable enemies that utilize aggressive and high-damaging attacks. They start by using [[Physical]] attacks, but can temporarily [[Conversion|convert]] into Elemental DMG. Typically found in pairs, if a fellow Kairagi is defeated in battle, the remaining one will enter a frenzied state, obtaining an instance of [[Healing]], enhanced attacks and immunity to [[Frozen]] and [[Planet Befall|petrifying]] effects. To avoid this, the Kairagi need to be defeated simultaneously or before they enter their frenzied state.
