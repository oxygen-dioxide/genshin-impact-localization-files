<!--{{Description|(Content here)}}-->
{{Lang|'''Kairagi'''|ja={{Rubi|海|かい|乱|ら|鬼|ぎ}}|ja_rm=Kairagi}}, are a type of [[Nobushi]]. There are currently two types of Kairagi: '''Dancing Thunder''' and '''Fiery Might'''.

'''[[Ochimusha]]''' are ghostly versions of Kairagi and are special one-time enemies. Like the Kairagi, Ochimusha have two types: '''Ensorcelled Thunder''' and '''Cankered Flame'''.

==Description==
Most Kairagi are former yoriki of the [[Shogun's Army]] who left for various reasons and typically rob others to make a living.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Gourmet Supremos: On the Road}}</ref> It appears that they can imbue their swords with the Elements through a forgotten technique with a paper seal from a [[Mystic Arts in Teyvat#Onmyoudou|Kamuna art]].

==Strategy==
On their own, Kairagi are typically not a problem. However, they are similar to [[Elite Enemies]] in strength despite being classified as Normal Enemies. When the Kairagi spots the player, they will unsheathe their sword; they gain a temporary damage reduction until they finish or are staggered, which cancels this animation. Kairagi are not particularly strong if they have not imbued their swords, although they still do significant damage. Once they have imbued their swords, they become far more dangerous as this significantly increases their attack power. This can also apply various elemental reactions depending on what enemies are nearby that further increase this damage.

When encountered in pairs, dealing with Kairagi becomes much more troublesome as they both need to be defeated in a short time frame. If the player defeats one of them too fast, the other will enter an Avenger state, increasing their health, prioritize infusing their blades and use more deadly combos. They also become immune to Frozen and Petrification attacks. The time frame does vary as the Kairagi will not attempt to enter this state if in the middle of an attack, and they can still be Frozen or Petrified before they attempt to do so, although none of these are reliable.

==Trivia==
*The Kairagi, along with the [[Fatui Skirmishers]] Vanguards and Legionnaires so far are the largest human enemies in-game.
*"Kairagi" was another name for the ''{{w|wokou}}'' {{Lang|ja={{Rubi|倭|わ|寇|こう}}|zh=倭寇|ko=왜구(倭寇)|ja_rm=Wakou|zh_rm=Wōkòu|ko_rm=Waegu}}, who were Japanese pirates that consistently raided and skirmished the shores of Korea and China during the 13th and 16th centuries.
*During a survey poll in 2.1, the Kairagi were listed as Elite Enemies, even though they fall under the Normal Enemies category in-game due to the Mora and experience gained from defeating them.
