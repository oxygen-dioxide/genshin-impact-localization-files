<!--{{Description|(Content here)}}-->
{{Lang|'''Kairagi'''|ja={{Rubi|海|かい|乱|ら|鬼|ぎ}}|ja_rm=Kairagi}}, are a type of [[Nobushi]]. [[Ochimusha]] are ghostly versions of Kairagi and are special one-time enemies.

In combat, Kairagi are durable enemies that utilize aggressive and high-damaging attacks. They start by using [[Physical]] attacks, but can [[Conversion|convert]] them into Elemental DMG. Typically found in pairs, if a fellow Kairagi is defeated in battle, the remaining one will enter a frenzied state, obtaining an instance of [[Healing]], a [[Max HP]] increase, and enhanced attacks. To avoid this, the player must defeat both Kairagi within a short period of time.
