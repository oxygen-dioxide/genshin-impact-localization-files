|description  = A swift, fierce fish with spiny fins whose spiny mouth can pierce the current when it swims at full speed. Its capabilities have earned it the nicknames "The Cutter" and "Hard-To-Get."<br>The Venomspine Fish's most well-known trait is its poisonous spines, which contain a neurotoxin that is fatal to smaller prey but proves far weaker against large organisms, mostly only causing mild confusion or hallucinations.<br>"Fill 'er up, Rex, my good lad! Fill 'er up to the brim for big brother!" &mdash; A certain fisherman from Liyue who was accidentally pricked.
