{{Description|A resplendent yet dignified wine goblet, once filled to the brim in an era long gone.}}
'''Goblet of Chiseled Crag''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Archaic Petra]].

==Description==
A vessel for wine carved from immovable rock.<br />It is said to be filled with the ambrosia of sovereigns.

It behooves basalt to be impregnable, and crystal to shine in its translucence.<br />Going incognito amongst mortals should be likewise, exquisite in its enjoyments.

Folk legend holds that in order to drink wine,<br />Rex Lapis brought forth bedrock,<br />And carved jade and lovely stone into a wine vessel for himself.

Some even say that there were once seven such vessels.
