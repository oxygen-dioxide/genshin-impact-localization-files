==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Neriman:''' Hello. Would you like to chat?
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Neriman:''' I'm a local porter and I'm taking a break from my job.
::'''Neriman:''' I was raised in the port. I'm the guy to talk to if you want to find out what's new around here.
::{{DIcon}} Around here...
:::'''Neriman:''' The long-term residents of Port Ormos are mostly traders and laborers who grew up around here.
:::'''Neriman:''' A lot of visitors and traders come here, but they tend to stick around only long enough to finish their business.
:::'''Neriman:''' For lodging, go to the hotel on the highland by the sea. Make sure to take the lift and spare yourself the long climb up.
:::'''Neriman:''' Who else is there... ah, right, the civil workers and [[Eremite]] mercs sent by the [[Akademiya]].
:::'''Neriman:''' I'm not familiar with them, and people usually don't bother them. We'd rather spend time drinking in [[Djafar Tavern]]!
::{{DIcon}} What's new...
:::'''Neriman:''' Well, to be honest, there's really been nothing much recently. It's good that everyone's living in peace and quiet, right?
:::'''Neriman:''' If I have to name something I haven't seen before, it's probably those strange people I saw when there was a sea monster warning a few days ago.
:::'''Neriman:''' Everyone was closing up, then some members of the Eremites pulling a ragged [[Amandeep|researcher]] along with them made a fuss about going out to sea.
:::'''Neriman:''' I've seen people avoiding sea monsters, but I've never seen people running to them. From what I heard, it seemed they were studying marine life or something.
:::'''Neriman:''' Ah, I don't know if they made it back alive. If it was just to make a living, there was no need to put their own lives on the line like that...
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Neriman:''' Farewell. I've got to take a breather.
