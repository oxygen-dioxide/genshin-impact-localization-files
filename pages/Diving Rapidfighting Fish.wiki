|description  = Despite the name it has been given, this creature is not actually a fish, but a medium-sized amphibian. It has a rather unique appearance with a distinctive flat head that bears a striking resemblance to a fist blade, giving it the look of being constantly ready for fierce battles with its natural enemies. In fact, they are gentle in nature and not aggressive in the slightest. The real purpose of their formidable-looking "blades" is to reduce water resistance when swimming through rivers. Thanks to their special head structure, they can navigate swiftly against the flow of turbulent currents, earning them the name "Rapidfighting Fish."<br>These bluish-toned Rapidfighting Fish are capable of diving down into deeper waters. But due to their fondness for the warmth of direct sunlight, as well as all the fun they have playing with young Koholasaurs, they tend not to stay at the bottom for very long...
