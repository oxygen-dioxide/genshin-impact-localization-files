The '''Inteyvat''' is the national flower of [[Khaenri'ah]]. It is the flower that [[Traveler|Lumine]] has been wearing in her hair since she woke up after the events involving her separation from Aether. It also appears in official art in a field of flowers.

==Description==
{{Quote|<p>It is the national flower of Khaenri'ah: the "Inteyvat." It once bloomed all over the nation.</p><p>It would only last two weeks before wilting. But if you were to pluck one and take it out of Khaenri'ah, the petals would stop growing and turn hard.</p><p>Only when it finally returned to its home soil would the petals grow soft once more, and finally turn to dust...</p><p>So the Inteyvat is a symbol for a wanderer far from home, signifying the tenderness of the homeland.</p>|[[Dainsleif]] in [[Memories of Inteyvat]]}}
Inteyvat flowers consist of five petals: four white and one light blue. The carpels and stamens of the flower are yellow, with the exception of Lumine's in-game model, of which the flowers' central parts change color based on the [[Element]] she is currently aligned with.  These central parts are shown to have the ability to glow.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/TAlKhARUcoY Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview]</ref> Inteyvat stems are a slightly darker purplish-blue.

==Trivia==
* Judging solely by the shapes of the flowers in-game and classifying this plant in already existing families, the Inteyvat's inspiration could have been based on the families ''Rosaceae'' (the rose family), ''Malvaceae'' (the mallow/hibiscus family), or ''Boraginaceae'' (borage/forget-me-not family).
