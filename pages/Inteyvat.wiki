The '''Inteyvat''' is the national flower of [[Khaenri'ah]]. It is the flower that [[Lumine]] wears in her hair.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Memories of Inteyvat}}</ref> The Traveler also says that they grow in their homeland.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Mary-Ann's Story}}</ref> It also appears in official art in a field of flowers, later known as [[The Sea of Flowers at the End]].

==Description==
{{Quote|It is the national flower of Khaenri'ah: the "Inteyvat." It once bloomed all over the nation.<br><br>It would only last two weeks before wilting. But if you were to pluck one and take it out of Khaenri'ah, the petals would stop growing and turn hard.<br><br>Only when it finally returned to its home soil would the petals grow soft once more, and finally turn to dust...<br><br>So the Inteyvat is a symbol for a wanderer far from home, signifying the tenderness of the homeland.|[[Dainsleif]] in [[Memories of Inteyvat]]}}
Inteyvat flowers consist of five petals: four white and one light blue. The carpels and stamens of the flower are yellow, with the exception of Lumine's in-game model, of which the flowers' central parts change color based on the [[Element]] she is currently aligned with.  These central parts are shown to have the ability to glow.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/TAlKhARUcoY Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview]</ref> Inteyvat stems are a slightly darker purplish-blue.

During their travels across worlds, the [[Traveler]] wanted to find a place in the universe where Inteyvat flowers bloomed in full bloom. At the end of their journey across [[Teyvat]], the [[Traveler's Sibling]] found such a place, known as [[The Sea of Flowers at the End]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|World-Order Narration}}</ref>

==Trivia==
* Judging solely by the shapes of the flowers in-game and classifying this plant in already existing families, the Inteyvat's inspiration could have been based on the families ''Rosaceae'' (the rose family), ''Malvaceae'' (the mallow/hibiscus family), or ''Boraginaceae'' (borage/forget-me-not family).
* [[Emilie]] makes an comment on the Inteyvat flower, which is dependent on the sibling the player selected as the Traveler.<ref>{{Ref/VO|character=Emilie|vo=Interesting Things|quote={{MC|m=Nothing can be more interesting than encountering new things. You've traveled to so many places, and I'm sure your range of experience is much broader than my own, so I was wondering if I could make a request... Have you ever encountered a flower, or spice maybe, that left a particularly strong impression on you? Could you tell me about it?<br>The "Inteyvat" flower... Huh, can't say I've ever heard of it, but that's certainly a grand-sounding name. Alright, well, I've made a note of it. If I'm lucky enough to ever see it in person, I'll certainly let you know.|f=May I ask you something? The flower you wear in your hair... I've never seen one like it before. If you saw fit to fashion it into a hair accessory, I imagine it means a great deal to you.<br>The "Inteyvat" flower... Huh, that's certainly a grand-sounding name. I don't know how you came to possess it, but I'm sure it means you are very important to this world.}}}}</ref>
