{{Lang|'''Sasayuri'''|ja=笹百合|ja_rm=Sasayuri}} was a cherished [[tengu]] general from [[Inazuma]] who served the [[Ei|Raiden Shogun]] and was known as the Great Tengu of Yougou.<ref name="Akuoumaru">{{Ref/Weapon|Akuoumaru}}</ref> Sasayuri was killed during a civil war between the Shogun and the people of the Great Serpent [[Orobashi]] from [[Watatsumi Island]].<ref>{{Ref/Book|Sangonomiya Chronicles}}</ref>

Sasayuri is depicted alongside the Raiden Shogun, [[Mikoshi Chiyo]], and the [[Kitsune Saiguu]] in [https://youtu.be/ydPqFAEgHzs Character Teaser - "Raiden Shogun: Nightmare."] Of them, Sasayuri is the first to disappear from the picnic ground after Raiden recollects the battle against Orobashi.

==Story==
The exact circumstances of Sasayuri's death are unknown. Before the invasion of [[Yashiori Island]], [[Akuou]] &mdash; the champion of Watatsumi Island &mdash; made a bet with [[Mouun]] that he would duel Sasayuri over Tenshukaku.<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Mouun's Moon}}</ref> While the duel over Tenshukaku never occurred, they indeed battled on Yashiori Island, during which Sasayuri's tengu mask "shattered."<ref name="Akuoumaru" />

After Sasayuri's death, the position of Great Tengu of Yougou eventually changed hands to [[Reizenbou]],<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Redhorn Stonethresher}}</ref> although it is unknown whether the title changed hands between them.
