'''Priscilla''' is a woman who lived in [[Mondstadt]] a thousand years ago, during the time of [[Vennessa]]'s rebellion and the fall of the [[Mondstadt Aristocracy]].

==Story==
Little is currently known about Priscilla, but she is mentioned in [[Luther]]'s [[Ancient Investigation Journal: Part III]] and [[Eberhart]]'s [[Ragged Records]].

Based on it, it appears she was a member of the aristocracy who was close with Eberhart, Luther, and presumably the other nobles from that era. However, unbeknownst to most of the others, she was one of Eberhart's co-conspirators in his plan to eliminate the corrupted aristocracy &mdash; even if it led to the deaths of the others.

While the expedition to [[Dragonspine]] was underway, Priscilla stayed behind in Mondstadt. If the nobles in the city were to find out about Eberhart's plot, she was to light a torch at [[Stormbearer Point]] as a warning for Eberhart.<ref>Interactible: [[Ragged Records]]</ref> Whether or not that came to pass is unknown.
