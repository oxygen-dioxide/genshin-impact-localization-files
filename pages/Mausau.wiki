==Profile==
According to Mausau's parents, his health is not the best, which makes him unable to do most things that other people can. During the first [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]] after the [[Abyss]] was fully purged from [[Natlan]], Mausau's body was possessed by the spirit of [[Xbalanque]]. Mausau dreamed of everything his body experienced, including fighting in the tournament and dueling with [[Mavuika]]. After Xbalanque's spirit returned to the [[Night Kingdom]], Mausau woke up and was inspired by his dream to train hard and enter in the next Pilgrimage.

===Appearance===
Mausau is a young boy with short red hair and red eyes, with a red mark on his right cheek and orange body paint on his chest. He has a blue and yellow scarf tied around his head. His attire consists mostly of brown with red and orange markings, a small blue, orange and white scarf tied around his right arm, blue pants with brown boots and a brown hooded cape.

When possessed by Xbalanque, his dark pupils are replaced by golden sun-shaped pupils.
