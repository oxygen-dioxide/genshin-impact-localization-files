==Profile==
When the [[Fatui]] established the Northland Bank in Liyue Harbor, Nadia was assigned to serve as a guard for the bank. She is somewhat homesick, although not as much as Vlad, and writes letters back home. She regularly awaits the incoming boat from Snezhnaya to receive letters from her family and send her replies.

One time, she accidentally left her letter for her brother at the bank while changing shifts. Vlad, mistaking it as a letter written for him, left a response. Afterwards, the two became pen pals, writing letters for the other to read during their shifts.

The two finally meet during the [[Lantern Rite]] event, apparently having gotten time off to celebrate the festivities. Neither of them appear to realize the other is their pen pal, although the acknowledge that conversing with the other feels nostalgic. In the [[Version 1.3]] trailer, the two can also be seen enjoying the festival together.

==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nadia:''' Oh, pardon me. My mind was elsewhere just now...
:'''Nadia:''' I just miss wintertime back in my hometown.
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Nadia:''' I'm waiting for a boat, a boat that could arrive at any minute, a boat carrying the thoughts of my loved ones...
::'''Nadia:''' I'm Nadia from [[Snezhnaya]]. I was transferred here because of my work.
::'''Nadia:''' Sometimes you have no choice but to leave your homeland behind. I do miss my family dearly, so I can only write to them and hope for their replies.
::'''Nadia:''' So I come here and wait for the boats from Snezhnaya whenever I have a free moment. I guess it's also a way for me to show how much I miss them.
:{{DIcon}} You miss wintertime?
::'''Nadia:''' Winter in Snezhnaya is quite different.
::'''Nadia:''' It's common in some places for blizzards to last an entire month. It can be deadly if you don't properly prepare your food reserves and don't take precautions against the cold.
::'''Nadia:''' So as you cuddle up next to the warm stove with snow laden winds beating against the window, the danger that is right in front of your eyes and yet distant in the sky will make you think, "Ah, I'm alive, and I'm happy."
::'''Nadia:''' If you ever come to Snezhnaya, you'll understand what I mean.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Nadia:''' Goodbye, I hope you will also reunite with those who are missing you!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Nadia:''' ...
:'''Nadia:''' Oh, good evening. This is the [[Northland Bank]].
:{{DIcon}} What are you thinking about?
::'''Nadia:''' I was just going back and forth in my mind a bit about what I should write in this letter.
::'''Nadia:''' Usually I write to my family back home, but recently I've gained a penpal.
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about your penpal.
:::'''Nadia:''' He's also a guard here at the Northland Bank, but he's on duty during the day, while I'm on duty during the night. To tell you the truth, I don't even know his name.
:::'''Nadia:''' One time, I accidentally left the letter I had written to my brother at our post.
:::'''Nadia:''' And then perhaps the other guard mistook it as a letter that I left for him. He even wrote me a reply.
:::'''Nadia:''' I could read between the lines and tell he was probably very lonely, so I thought it would be good to go along with it to help him out in this way.
:::'''Nadia:''' But eventually, writing to him also became a part of my life. I've even started looking forward to receiving his letters, hehe.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Nadia:''' Take care now.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Event Dialogue==
===Lantern Rite===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''[[Vlad]]:''' H&mdash;Hello... Judging from your attire, we must be from the same place, no?
:'''[[Nadia]]:''' Hmm? Ah yes, hello. Sorry, I seldom meet other Snezhnayans around here.
:'''Vlad:''' The Lantern Rite sure is beautiful, isn't it?
:'''Nadia:''' Yes, but it seems that there's still much to come yet. The Mingxiao Lantern is the height of the festivities. At least, that's what I've heard.
:'''Vlad:''' Ah yes, so it seems. I've only just arrived here recently... I've come here alone, so there are still many things I don't quite understand yet.
:'''Nadia:''' Oh? I've also arrived recently myself, so I often come here alone to watch the ships sail from Snezhnaya.
:'''Vlad:''' ...Though I know that these boats rolling in and out of the port are not the ones to take me back home. Huh, what a coincidence... I also often come and watch the boats here.
:'''Nadia:''' Are you sure we've never met before?
:'''Vlad:''' Could we have met before? Perhaps my memory is failing me... I apologize, it would be impolite if I've forgotten.
:'''Nadia:''' No, no, I'm sure we've never met. Though I feel that something is... awfully familiar when I'm speaking with you.
:'''Vlad:''' Ah, is that so... Well, that's perfectly alright...
:'''Nadia:''' The Lantern Rite... It sure is beautiful, isn't it?
{{Dialogue End}}

===Moonlight Merriment===
====Nighttime====
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Vlad:''' It's festival time here in Liyue again. Thanks for accepting my invitation to view the moon together...
:'''Vlad:''' I'd originally planned to invite you to some famous restaurant, but I didn't think that they'd been fully booked ages ago...
:'''Nadia:''' It's alright. I've heard that the theme of this festival is gourmet food. It's not all that surprising that there were no tables left.
:'''Vlad:''' Eh? I&mdash;Is that so... So that's why I couldn't book any seats...
:'''Vlad:''' Looks like my lack of understanding about Liyue was to blame. I'm sorry...
:'''Nadia:''' Eh? Oh, no, you don't have to apologize...
:'''Nadia:''' Just being able to relax and watch the bright moon together is good enough for me.
:'''Nadia:''' Don't you think the moon at this time is brighter and rounder than usual?
:'''Vlad:''' Oh, is it? ...No, I mean... You're right. It truly is very beautiful.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Fleeting Colors in Flight===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Outside the Northland Bank at night)
:'''Nadia:''' These fireworks are lovely. If I could watch them together with him, just once... Hmm, should I mention that in my next letter...
:'''Nadia:''' ...
:'''Nadia:''' Oh, um, good evening. This is the Northland Bank.
{{Dialogue End}}

===The Exquisite Night Chimes===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After completing [[A Single Harmony for an Irreplaceable Soul]])
:'''Vlad:''' I didn't know that you liked music so much... I'm so glad I invited you here.
:'''Nadia:''' And thank you for inviting me. I've never had such a great time enjoying live music...
:'''Nadia:''' I don't know much about music, but with the person beside&mdash; Ahem, with all these people around, it's been a great experience.
:'''Vlad:''' That's great! You've always been a quiet person, so I was afraid you wouldn't like this kind of event.
:'''Vlad:''' Looks like I should keep an eye out for more music festivals like this in the future...
{{Dialogue End}}

===Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze===
{{Dialogue Start}} 
;(After completing [[The Glede Returns to the Pavilion (Quest)]])
:'''Vlad:''' Do you ever think that there might be some kites that can no longer be retrieved after being sent up to the sky?
:'''Nadia:''' I guess so? Even if you could control the line, the wind might decline your commands all the same.
:'''Nadia:''' Speaking of that, should we go buy one? I mean, I haven't flown one before, so I'm not sure if it'll work out...
:'''Vlad:''' Or... What say we make one together? I've seen kids discussing the patterns they want to draw on theirs, so it might not be that difficult.
:'''Nadia:''' The two of us... Sure, let's give it a go!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Springtime Charms===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Vlad:''' Um... Have you figured it out yet?
:'''Nadia:''' Hmm... I'm afraid not.
:'''Nadia:''' I've been working here for a long time, but Liyue's local sayings are still a mystery to me.
:'''Vlad:''' That's true. Makes you wonder, doesn't it - why would you sometimes use "wealth" as part of will-wishes, and sometimes as an invective...? 
:'''Nadia''' ...I'd say we'd be better off not dwelling on that.
:'''Nadia''' I mean, something like "love" is expressed in many different languages, but the meaning that we mean to convey is the same, isn't it?
:'''Vlad:''' Yes, you're right, of course. You know what? That's a good line - wouldn't look out of place on a gift envelope at all, I'd say!
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia== 
*Nadia and Vlad's relationship seems to be evolving whenever a major festive event happens in [[Liyue Harbor]]: 
**Based on their normal dialogue, they acknowledged each other when Nadia forgot a letter meant for her brother at her post when changing shifts. Vlad mistook it as a letter meant for him and wrote a reply, to which Nadia then replied too, as she could tell he was lonely. They started to communicate this way, however they still did not know each other's name.
** During [[Lantern Rite]], they met for the first time in person while admiring the lanterns. They were both unaware that they are each other's penpal, however Nadia had a sense of familiarity when talking to Vlad.
**During [[Moonlight Merriment]], they had a date and went moongazing.
**During [[Fleeting Colors in Flight]], they watched the fireworks display together and both wished to see it again (Nadia with her penpal, Vlad with Nadia).
**During [[The Exquisite Night Chimes]], they fulfilled their promise from last year to watch the fireworks together, this time along with Xinyan, Hu Tao, and Dvorak's music show. Nadia started to enjoy spending time with Vlad (not mentioning her penpal anymore), but Vlad mistaken it for Nadia's enjoying the music, upon which he intends to keep an eye out for music festivals for their next date.
**During [[Vibrant Harriers Aloft in Spring Breeze]], they resolved to make a kite together.
*Nadia and Vlad's dialogue during Moonlight Merriment only triggers at nighttime (19:00 – 06:00). During daytime, they will each have their own usual dialogue instead, even though they both remain on the dock standing next to each other.<!--Be aware that the trivia section is being transcluded on Vlad's page-->
* Nadia and Vlad's separate dialogue after the fireworks in Fleeting Colors in Flight only occur during their shifts at the Northland Bank. Their off-shift dialogue remains the same. Immediately after the fireworks display, they will spend the day together by the dock before going back to their usual positions.
