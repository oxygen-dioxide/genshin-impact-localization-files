;(On obtaining quest)
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Strange...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's heard lots of people talking about this "Akademiya Extravaganza" thing earlier. Wonder what that is?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Maybe there'll be fun things to do there. Let's go to the Akademiya and have a look for ourselves!

;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 01.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' A moment, if you would... Are you two the famous {{Traveler}} and Paimon, by any chance?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We sure are! And who're you?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 02.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' My name is Wiqas, a member of the Akademiya Extravaganza Planning Committee. Have you two heard of this festival?
:{{DIcon}} Only just now.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yup, and that's exactly why we're here!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 03.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' Is that so? Looks like our advertising is working.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 04.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' Since you're both interested, would you mind if I gave you a brief explanation of the event?
:{{DIcon}} That would be helpful, thanks.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 05.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' Ahem... So, the [[Akademiya Extravaganza]] is a grand event run by the Akademiya with a long and storied history. To be precise, it can be divided into the Wisdom Gala and the Interdarshan Championship.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 06.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' The Gala is held annually. During this time, all six Darshans will set up booths throughout the city and host guests to showcase the most fascinating aspects of their school and thus increase their influence.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 07.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' On the other hand, the Championship is held once every four years. Each Darshan will send a representative to vie for the position of grand champion.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 08.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' This year, the Gala is being held alongside the Championship, so the mood in the city is, as they say, at an unprecedented fever pitch.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Got it! Cool, thanks a bunch for the detailed explanation!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 09.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' You're most welcome. Answering questions regarding the Akademiya Extravaganza is my job, and... I actually do have something I would like to ask the two of you.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Need our help with something?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 10.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' Well... Let me begin by saying that this year's Akademiya Extravaganza is of utmost importance to us.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 11.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' Lesser Lord Kusanali and the sages came up with a plan for the Akademiya to recruit talented people from the desert, starting next year.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 12.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' As such, we've invited a great number of desert-dwellers to take part in this festival, so they can hopefully experience the Akademiya's atmosphere ahead of time.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 13.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' I've heard that the two of you are famous across both the rainforest and desert. With your participation, especially in the Interdarshan Championship, more people will definitely come to appreciate the festival.
:{{DIcon}} We're not Akademiya researchers, you know.
:{{DIcon}} Didn't you just say that only Darshan representatives can take part?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Exactly. Or do you mean you want us to join a Darshan? Ugh, but then we'd have to deal with exams and essays and stuff like that...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 14.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' No need to worry. The Championship participants have already been selected. I mean to invite the two of you as guest commentators. Your job will be to observe and record every part of the competition.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 15.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' There's no pressure. Just follow each match and enjoy the festival! Aside from that, we'll also prepare some compensation for your efforts &mdash; we won't have you working for free.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That kinda sounds like a sweet deal. What do you think?
:{{DIcon}} Who are the participants, anyway?
::{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 16a 1.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' You can head over to the festival venue later. An organizer there will introduce each participant.
::{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 16a 2.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' Some of them even might be people you recognize... I'll leave it at that for now.
:{{DIcon}} Will there be other commentators?
::{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 16b 1.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' Yes. Two others, in fact.
::{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 16b 2.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' Their responsibilities will be somewhat different from yours. One of our organizers will explain the details to you later at the main venue.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 17.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' So, how about it? Would you like to take this commission?
:{{DIcon}} We'll give it a go.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, having fun while getting paid... This sounds awesome!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 18.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' The main event venue is at the outskirts of the Citadel of Regzar, and the organizer you're looking for is Kareena. Tell her the situation and she'll get you set up.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 wiqas 19.ogg}} '''Wiqas:''' The Championship is going to begin soon. I wish you a good experience serving as commentators. If you have any doubts, come find me any time.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 1 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alrighty, off we go!

;(Talk to Wiqas again, optional)<!--no ASTK-->

:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 kareena 01.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Welcome, one and all, to the Akademiya Extravaganza!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 kareena 02.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Now then, allow me to reveal the prizes for this iteration of the Interdarshan Championship&mdash;
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 kareena 03.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Fabulous monetary rewards, research funds, a limited-edition [[Genius Invokation TCG]] card... and the right to wear the [[Diadem of Knowledge]]. I believe that I need not elaborate as to how this is a symbol of great honor!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She should be Kareena, right?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like she's in the middle of something. Let's wait till she's less busy, then go introduce ourselves.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 alae 01.ogg}} '''Alae:''' The Diadem of Knowledge... What a perfect work of art...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 aissa 01.ogg}} '''Aissa:''' Every time I see it, I feel like I'm losing myself in its beauty. The one who proves fit to wear it must be a rare genius indeed.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 kareena 04.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' I believe that most of you have already seen the Diadem of Knowledge, or have heard tales about it.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 kareena 05.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Twenty years ago, a researcher named Sachin bought it for a large sum of Mora before donating it to the Akademiya.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 kareena 06.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' The generous Championship prizes are also sourced from his sponsorship. Before we begin, allow me to express our gratitude to this researcher, who cannot be with us right now...
:;(The Traveler has a vision of a white-haired man in front of the Diadem of Knowledge on the stage)
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 saqqain 01.ogg}} '''[[Sachin|???]]:''' Things can only get worse...

:;(Vision ends)
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, stop spacing out!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon called out to you, but you didn't respond. You okay? Did you stay up late without telling Paimon?
:{{DIcon}} I was...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 kareena 07.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Alright, I'm sure we're all more than ready for the Championship to begin!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 kareena 08.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Now then, let's invite our six Darshan representatives to the stage! Our contestants are&mdash;
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 kareena 09.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Representing Amurta, Tighnari!
::Amurta &mdash; Tighnari &mdash; Biology
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 kareena 10.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Representing Spantamad, Cyno!
::Spantamad &mdash; Cyno &mdash; Elementalism
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 kareena 11.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Representing Rtawahist, Layla!
::Rtawahist &mdash; Layla &mdash; Illuminationism
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 kareena 12.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Representing Haravatat, Faruzan!
::Haravatat &mdash; Faruzan &mdash; Semiotics
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 kareena 13.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Representing Kshahrewar, Kaveh!
::Kshahrewar &mdash; Kaveh &mdash; Technology
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 kareena 14.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' And for Vahumana... Huh? Is Vahumana's representative not here yet?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 wanderer 01.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' These introductions are pointless. Let's just get this over with.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh? W&mdash;Wait a sec, why is he Vahumana's representative...?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 kareena 15.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Finally! Our final contestant is Vahumana's representative: Hat Guy!
::Vahumana &mdash; Hat Guy &mdash; Aetiology
:{{Introductory Note|Wanderer}}
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 alae 02.ogg}} '''Alae:''' Oh, so that's Hat Guy? I think I've seen him before...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh? You know who he is?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 aissa 02.ogg}} '''Aissa:''' I've heard that he's a researcher from a different country who nominally belongs to Vahumana. Word is that he's written a lot of political analyses.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 aissa 03.ogg}} '''Aissa:''' His manner of speech hasn't made him popular amongst most other Vahumana researchers, but his comings and goings are quite irregular, so he doesn't interact with others much.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 alae 03.ogg}} '''Alae:''' Aside from his more controversial aspects, his perspectives are considered quite incisive.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 alae 04.ogg}} '''Alae:''' Vahumana has seen a dearth of new talent lately, and some of its existing ones are not currently at the Akademiya, so I suspect he might have been their only option...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' It's just kinda weird. He doesn't seem like the kind of guy who'd participate in competitions like this one...
:{{DIcon}} I'm quite puzzled, too.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 kareena 16.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Now that we have our six contestants, the Championship will soon begin!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 kareena 17.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Who will triumph this time around? Hold on to your hats, because we're all on this ride together!
;(Butterflies are released from the stage)
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, we really do know a lot of the contestants.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, right, we're guest commentators, aren't we? So figuring out everyone's reasons for participating is in our job description.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go ask them when we go say hi. Especially him... Paimon still thinks it's weird that he's here.

;(Talk to Alae, optional)<!--no ASTK-->
:{{A|vo dialog xyjeq001 alae 01.ogg}} '''Alae:''' It's been a long time since the last Interdarshan Championship. How exciting!

;(Talk to Aissa, optional)<!--no ASTK-->
:{{A|vo dialog xyjeq001 aissa 01.ogg}} '''Aissa:''' They say that Sachin was a Vahumana researcher and that he was a pretty famous genius. I guess geniuses always appreciate the knowledge of other geniuses, haha!

;(Talk to Tighnari or Cyno)
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' We meet again, you two.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Tighnari! We came here to check out this Extravaganza event... and then they invited us to be guest commentators!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Is that so? I heard that there would be guest commentators recording the proceedings with Kameras, but I didn't expect they'd be you two.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' It's a pleasant surprise that you're visiting Sumeru again while I'm still on leave. When everything comes together perfectly like this, I call it the Biryani factor:
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Because it's always rice to meat stew again.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' ...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sooo, Tighnari, you're representing Amurta, and Cyno is representing Spantamad...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But haven't you both already graduated? Can alumni also take part in the competition?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I had wondered the same thing. When I was told the news, I was actually more shocked than you are now.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 tighnari 05.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I later found out that anyone who has been part of a particular Darshan has the right to participate. Graduation status has no effect.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's a rule, huh.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' There are some restrictions, though. For example, sages cannot participate, any given person can only participate in one instance of the Championship, and so on.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 tighnari 06.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' That's right. Also, there are two methods by which the Darshan representatives are chosen. One is self-nomination, and the other is to be recommended by over half of one's Darshan.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You must've been a case of the latter, Tighnari!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I heard that quite a few of your juniors petitioned for your candidacy.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 tighnari 07.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' ...Sometimes I wish I could clap a few of them over the head and tell them to spend that time on studying instead.
:{{DIcon}} Can you refuse?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 tighnari 08.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Well, you can. But after some consideration, I realized this could be a good opportunity for me.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 tighnari 09.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Next month, we're having a public lecture on ecology at Gandharva Ville. If I participate in this event, I might be able to utilize its popularity to promote the lecture.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 tighnari 10.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I'm not that concerned about becoming the champion, unlike someone here.
:{{DIcon}} So you volunteered yourself, Cyno?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Yes. I'm using the last of my leave for this. When I heard that a limited-edition Genius Invokation TCG card was one of the prizes, I signed myself up.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' This year's card is a rare one indeed. It would be a shame if I missed out on it.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait... Is it some kind of super powerful card?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' No, it's a very common one, but it has a holographic layer.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh? So what's the point?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 cyno 08.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' It's very cool.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh... Paimon meant apart from being "very cool."
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 cyno 09.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' That is reason enough. I shall do my all to emerge victorious and add it to my deck.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 tighnari 11.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' As someone who doesn't play cards much, I can't quite relate... but it isn't surprising that everyone has their own reasons for taking part in the tournament.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 3 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Fair enough. Alright, let's go find someone else to question.

;(Talk to Tighnari or Cyno again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xyjeq001 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I'm surprised you were willing to come to Sumeru City at all.
:{{A|vo dialog xyjeq001 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Well, the atmosphere at the Akademiya has improved immensely since Azar and his ilk were deposed. Master has been busy recently, so he hasn't had the time to instruct me or try to convince me to return to the Akademiya.
:{{A|vo dialog xyjeq001 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' So I've been occasionally visiting the city these days. Trade and business are in greater abundance here, so it's much easier to acquire necessary research equipment.

;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Cyno, optional)
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 40 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' (I must get that limited-edition card!)

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Tighnari, optional)
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 40 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' (It doesn't seem that Sumeru City has changed too much.)

;(Talk to Layla, Kaveh, or Faruzan)
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kaveh, Faruzan, Layla!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 kaveh 01.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Huh? Oh, it's you. Why're you here?
:{{Introductory Note|Kaveh}}
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're here as specially invited guest commentators! Our job is to record what happens during the competition!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 faruzan 01.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Is that so? In that case, I'll have to trouble you to catch the moment of my triumph on Kamera!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 faruzan 02.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Remember to shoot from behind at a lower angle &mdash; you know, to capture a senior's class!
:{{Introductory Note|Faruzan}}
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 kaveh 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Don't get ahead of yourself, now. Victory will obviously be mine!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 faruzan 03.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Hah, you're far too young to even consider challenging me. Kshahrewar or Rtawahist, you're all children as far as I'm concerned...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 layla 01.ogg}} '''Layla:''' A&mdash;Actually, I was going to ask... How do you know me, Madam Faruzan?
:{{Introductory Note|Layla}}
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 faruzan 04.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Hmm? You don't remember? I sometimes see you in the library at night. You even waved at me!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 layla 02.ogg}} '''Layla:''' What...? I don't remember doing that at all!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 faruzan 05.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' How strange... However, this is not the time for curiosity. I am Faruzan, a household name in Haravatat. You are Layla from Rtawahist, I presume?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 layla 03.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Y&mdash;Yes.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 faruzan 06.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Good, then we are officially introduced. See? Simple as that.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 faruzan 07.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' I like respectful ones, by the way. Would you like to join my research group?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 kaveh 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Madam Faruzan... I'm quite sure this counts as poaching. Let's dial things down...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 faruzan 08.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' I know, but it's been tough getting people these days, and research funding has been hard to secure...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 faruzan 09.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' But once I win this tournament, it'll be a different story...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So you're just here to increase the amount of funding you're getting?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 faruzan 10.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Well, not just that... What, are you curious about my reasons for participating in this event?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 faruzan 11.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Well, I suppose that's to be expected. You are our guest commentators, after all.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 faruzan 12.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' There's been an influx of newly enrolled students, and they'll be paying close attention to this competition. If I do win, I'm certain that there will be no lack of students knocking upon my door.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 faruzan 13.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Moreover, research resources will be made available to the victor, so that will nix my funding issues. Therefore, my two juniors, I do apologize, but I fully intend to emerge triumphant.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 layla 04.ogg}} '''Layla:''' I&mdash;I'll do my best as well. At least, I don't plan to lose too badly...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So why are you here, Layla?

:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 layla 07.ogg}} '''Layla:''' I'm... I'm really nervous. I've been so worried about disappointing everyone that I've been losing sleep...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 faruzan 14.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Stress not, young one. We must all experience failure to grow and mature.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 layla 08.ogg}} '''Layla:''' But Madam Faruzan, I don't want to fail...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 kaveh 04.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Tch, seriously? Everyone has such nice reasons for joining.
:{{DIcon}} And what's your story, Kaveh?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 kaveh 05.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Must I say?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yes, you do! We gotta record it!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 kaveh 06.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Um, well... You know, right? I want to buy some property...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, that's right! You want to move out of Alhaitham's&mdash;
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 kaveh 07.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' *coughing* What!? Alhaitham? What about him!? This has nothing to do with him!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon's misremembering things.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh...! Right! Sorry, Paimon has no idea what she was talking about...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, you want to use the grand prize to buy a place, right?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 kaveh 08.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Correct. Also, my father took part in the Interdarshan Championship when I was young, but he didn't win.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 kaveh 09.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Once I do, the right to wear that diadem will be mine. In a way, I'll be helping my father fulfill a dream of his.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 faruzan 15.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' That's not a bad reason at all. You have ambition, youngster.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 faruzan 16.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Although your chances with me here aren't great, I believe your father would be most proud if the Diadem of Knowledge were bestowed upon you.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 kaveh 10.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...Not that he'll have the chance to celebrate. My father passed away many years ago. They say he ran into quicksand while traveling in the desert.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 faruzan 17.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' For you to have experienced such a thing... That must have been tough for you.

:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 faruzan 18.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Alright. Earlier, you said that you want to use the prize Mora to purchase a home. Where do you live now, do you live alone?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 kaveh 13.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' *cough* Well...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 faruzan 19.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Hmm... I also heard you mention "Alhaitham" just a moment ago. Isn't he also from Haravatat? Are you two hiding something from me?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 kaveh 14.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' No, of course not! Why would you think that? Hahaha...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's definitely not involved, either! We're gonna go interview other contestants now! Bye!

:{{A|vo dialog xyjeq001 faruzan 03.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Hmph. In truth, I have no intention of solving Kshahrewar's problems for them, but I decided that this youngster seemed to have a decent attitude, and so we had a good chat.

:{{A|vo xyjeq001 5 wanderer 01.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Just call me Hat Guy. That's the name I use in Vahumana.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That sounds like a nickname, not a real name!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 5 wanderer 02.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' So I can't go by a simple, ordinary name?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Fine, suit yourself. Alright then, Hat Guy, why are you taking part in the Interdarshan Championship?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're specially invited guest commentators, so play nice and answer our questions.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 5 wanderer 03.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' You could be matra for all I care. So what if I don't answer you? What then?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You...!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 5 wanderer 04.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Hmph, I'll tell you this much: I have an agreement with someone not to reveal my motives.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're not plotting something in secret, are you?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 5 wanderer 05.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Well, it's hard to say. Why don't you take a guess?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon's had it with you!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Fine, be that way! Then we won't ask you why you're participating. Instead... Uh, why did you join Vahumana?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 5 wanderer 06.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' You two sure like to poke your noses where they don't belong. If I don't say anything, are you going to annoy me to death?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 5 wanderer 07.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' ...I heard that the Vahumana researcher named Aqaba was researching the Tatarasuna incident, so I wrote a few essays to refute his points.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 5 wanderer 08.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Later, when I was bored, I wrote some commentary on societal issues in Inazuma. I didn't expect Vahumana to consider me as one of them. Someone even invited me to a lecture or whatever.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 5 wanderer 09.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' From start to finish, it was just the wishful thinking of idiots &mdash; a misunderstanding. There's your answer. Simple.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 5 wanderer 10.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' But when Lesser Lord Kusanali heard about this, she went out of her way to get me registered in Vahumana... She used the name "Hat Guy."
:{{DIcon}} So it was Nahida's doing...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 5 wanderer 11.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Enough chit-chat. You're better off wasting your time with the other contestants.

:{{A|vo xyjeq001 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How is anyone supposed to relax with you around!?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 5 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've gotta stay alert and keep a close eye on him!

;(Talk to Wanderer again, optional)

:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We were actually looking for you, too!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 kareena 03.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Excellent! Then, please allow me to explain your job responsibilities in detail.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 kareena 04.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' First, please take these two things.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 kareena 05.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' The first item is a custom Kamera from the Akademiya. Please use it to record the competition as it unfolds.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 kareena 06.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' The second is an event-specific locator that will flag all participants' locations. It will also sound when one of them completes an objective.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, what a convenient little thing!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 kareena 07.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Aside from you two, there are two other commentators. However, they will remain by the commentators' area and will not be following the contestants in real time.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 kareena 08.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Speaking of which, you probably know them... Alhaitham and Nilou.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohhh, it's them! We have to go over and say hi later!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 kareena 09.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Well, don't let me keep you, unless you have any questions for me?
:{{DIcon}} Have you seen a white-haired man around?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 kareena 10.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Hm? Why do you ask?
:{{DIcon}} I saw someone like that on the stage earlier.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 kareena 11.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Really? I didn't see any such person. Could I ask when you saw him?
:{{DIcon}} Just before the Akademiya representatives went on stage.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 kareena 12.ogg}} '''Kareena:''' Strange... I was on stage the entire time, and I didn't see anyone come up.

:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 candace 01.ogg}} '''Candace:''' The Akademiya sent us both invitations, so Dehya suggested that we come together.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 candace 02.ogg}} '''Candace:''' The villagers were also encouraging me to travel outside the village. I couldn't find it in myself to turn them down...
:{{Introductory Note|Candace}}
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 dehya 02.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' We're here now, so no point dwelling on that. Even though this Extravaganza isn't a holiday or anything, it's still a big deal here in Sumeru.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 dehya 03.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Merchants from all over will set up shop. There'll be tons of stuff to eat, use, and wear... More than you can count!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 dehya 04.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' I'm already set on helping you buy two new outfits. I mean, who wears the same thing at work and home, anyway?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 candace 03.ogg}} '''Candace:''' I'm looking forward to it. Ah... Just being able to relax and wander the streets freely has already made my day.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 dehya 05.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' So, {{Traveler}}, Paimon, you two wanna come with?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Agh, we'd love to... but we've got work to do right now!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 dehya 06.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' Aw, that's a shame. Let's hang out together when you're free, then.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 dehya 07.ogg}} '''Dehya:''' In that case, Candace and I will head out first. Good clothing and fabrics are very much in demand &mdash; if you snooze, you lose! Oh, right, we should also get some accessories...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 candace 04.ogg}} '''Candace:''' No need to rush. I think we'll have a better time if we take things slow.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 candace 05.ogg}} '''Candace:''' See you two later. Feel free to come find us whenever you have the time.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon didn't think that Candace and Dehya would come. Hanging out with them sounds like a great time! Still, looks like the competition's starting soon. Let's go over to where Alhaitham is and see what's going on.

:{{A|vo xyjeq001 7 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' During the opening ceremony, Akademiya staff released several cages of butterflies, and many of them are now fluttering within Sumeru City.
:{{Introductory Note|Alhaitham}}
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 7 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Amongst these butterflies, three of them will be special Swiftflies. They have a different appearance and also fly a little faster.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 7 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Your objective this round is to find a Swiftfly and bring it to me. Three points will be awarded to the first participant to return, two to the second, and one point to the third.

:{{A|vo xyjeq001 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm. That said, how did he get picked to be a commentator? Paimon's kinda curious...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 7 layla 01.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Finding three specific butterflies in a place as large as Sumeru City sounds rather improbable...

:{{A|vo xyjeq001 9 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' My hypothesis is that the Swiftflies' morphological variations won't significantly affect their fundamental nature. So, I'm planning on using this to lure them out.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 9 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Of course, I could be wrong. Every mutation opens the door to new possibilities, especially when they are artificially introduced...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 9 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Details will have to wait until after the post-experimental analysis. For now, Collei and I are going to buy some reagents for our experiment. Alright, well, see you later.

:{{A|vo xyjeq001 10 wanderer 02.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Is it that you can't use astrology during the day? Huh, guess that skill's less useful than I thought.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 10 layla 05.ogg}} '''Layla:''' No, it's not like that. If it's daytime, all I need is an astrolabe...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So why don't you do that, then?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 10 layla 06.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Mona Megistus the Astrologist said that those who constantly use astrology to obtain things that shouldn't be theirs will eventually lose the "blessing from the stars."
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 10 layla 07.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Um, it's just something I read in an academic publication. I really love to read Mona's essays...

:{{A|vo dialog xyjeq001 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' There were several factors, but primarily the recommendation of the sages. I suppose they assumed that I'd have the free time for this job after resigning as Acting Grand Sage.
:{{A|vo dialog xyjeq001 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' That said, they'd probably claim that my calm demeanor would help maintain fairness in the competition.

:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 kaveh 01.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' *huffing*... Finally, I made it. I heard that you caught a Swiftfly, Cyno. Mind letting me see what it looks like?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 kaveh 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...Hold on, isn't this the mechanical bait that I released earlier? Why would you catch that instead of a Swiftfly!?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 faruzan 01.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Wait a minute. If we consider this from a different angle, isn't it a good thing that the bait you made was convincing enough to fool even Cyno?
:{{DIcon}} You released...
:{{DIcon}} ...Bait?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 kaveh 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' That's right. During a previous interior design project, I felt that the artificial flowers on the wall were a little bland, so I decided on placing a few moving mechanical butterflies to add some pizazz.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 kaveh 04.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' In order to make them both small and nimble, I consulted with Madam Faruzan.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 kaveh 05.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Not long ago, the two of us took all those mechanical butterflies and released them into the city&mdash;
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why would you do that?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 faruzan 02.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Hmph, need you even ask? Young people these days really do need to get out more.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 faruzan 03.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Have you never played that game where you place strips of paper on a bamboo pole and wave it across a field of flowers to attract a whole kaleidoscope of butterflies?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' No, I haven't.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Wait. So you're trying to...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 faruzan 04.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' That's right. The butterflies within the city will mistake our mechanical bait for one of their own and follow them around.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 faruzan 05.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' As long as we keep releasing and retrieving our bait, we can capture all the butterflies within the city. What comes afterward is just a matter of separating the Swiftflies from the others!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, guess that's one way to do it.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 faruzan 06.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Do not underestimate the wisdom of your elders. I had already thought of this method the moment the round's rules were announced.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 faruzan 07.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Of course, we also owe much to this fine junior of mine here for making such lifelike butterflies. It seems that Kshahrewar has not quite declined as far as I had thought in recent years &mdash; their teaching skills, at least, seem to be intact.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 kaveh 06.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Well, I just stuck to what I do best. The idea was yours.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 faruzan 08.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Ah, no need to be so polite. Once we capture all these butterflies, we shall split the points for this round...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 faruzan 09.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Ah, look, one of them is returning now... Hmm? Wait a moment. Are my eyes deceiving me? Why don't I see any butterflies behind it?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's because there are none! Seems like your plan has hit a snag.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Looks like the match continues. I'll be looking elsewhere.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 faruzan 10.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Hmm, strange... Has something else diverted their attention?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 11 faruzan 11.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Come! Let's search in the direction the bait returned from!

:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Tighnari!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Fascinating, isn't it? The butterflies have all congregated here, due to a special incense that I used.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I infused it with three different types of honey, and the butterflies, following the fragrance, have gathered around me.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 huwa 01.ogg}} '''Huwa:''' Butterflies must have really sharp noses, then!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 huwa 02.ogg}} '''Huwa:''' Wait... Do they even have noses? I've never seen one.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' They do not, in fact, and their vision isn't stellar, either.
:;(As Tighnari continues, Paimon quickly finishes setting up the Kamera to record the scene.)
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' However, they can use their antennae to distinguish between scents, and their olfactory senses are generally quite advanced, allowing them to detect floral fragrances from great distances.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 huwa 03.ogg}} '''Huwa:''' Oh, so that's how it is! I had a pet butterfly once. I picked wild flowers and placed them in its box, but it wouldn't eat any...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 tighnari 05.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' That's normal. Raising butterflies isn't difficult, but there are many things you should take note of.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 tighnari 06.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Appropriate temperature, sufficient air, and a spacious environment are examples of such considerations. You must also ensure that the food you've chosen suits their "palate."
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 tighnari 07.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Most importantly, you must curb your curiosity and avoid disturbing them while they rest, otherwise they may become stressed.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 huwa 04.ogg}} '''Huwa:''' Ah, sorry, I liked to poke at its wings at the time...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 tighnari 08.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Humans tend to rear many creatures due to their aesthetic value, but not all are suited for such a process.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 tighnari 09.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Caring for living beings is hard work. Impulse alone is insufficient &mdash; some prerequisite knowledge is always required.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 hayati 01.ogg}} '''Haryadi:''' You sure do know a lot!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 habib 01.ogg}} '''Habib:''' I&mdash;I have a question, too. I bought a scarab not long ago, and it hasn't seemed very active. Can you help me figure out why?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 aymar 01.ogg}} '''Aymar:''' I'd like to keep a Dusk Bird as a pet. What are some key points I should consider?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 maha 01.ogg}} '''Mahar:''' Um... Is it possible to keep a Rishboland Tiger as a pet?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 tighnari 10.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Alright, it seems like you all have a great deal of questions.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 tighnari 11.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' But I'm in the middle of the Interdarshan Championship at the moment, so I'm afraid I can't answer them all now.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 tighnari 12.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Let me propose an alternative. Next month, there will be a biology lecture at Gandharva Ville, and I will be sharing some interesting insights on living organisms there.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 tighnari 13.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' If you're interested, you can attend that lecture, and if you should have any questions, just prepare them ahead of time. I'll answer questions after I've finished speaking.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 huwa 05.ogg}} '''Huwa:''' Alright! I'll be there!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 tighnari 14.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Of course, please try to ask more... rational questions. For example, whether you can raise a Rishboland Tiger as a pet or not is mainly dependent on whether you can overcome one in a fight.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like Tighnari's science lecture will draw quite a crowd!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 faruzan 02.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Huh? Oh! Ahem, was I listening in for that long?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 faruzan 03.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Seems Collei's master does live up to his title as a teacher...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 kaveh 01.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Madam Faruzan, I've had a look around. Nearly all the butterflies in this area have been attracted by the incense.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 kaveh 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' However, we can cast our bait further away to avoid this area.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 12 faruzan 04.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Alright, then let's get moving. We shan't let all the butterflies get away from us if we can help it!

{{Quest Description|update|All three Swiftflies have been collected in a short period. Go to the main venue and see what's going on.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the stage)
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' It seems we have a third contestant who has returned with a Swiftfly.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' With that, the first round has come to an end. I anticipate that all of you will keep up the effort for the second round. Dismissed.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Ah, um... Your closing statement sounded so... How do I put it... Decisive?<!-- was there an intro note here if you didn't do her optional interaction before? -->
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Well, you could certainly stand to try being more decisive, Nilou. It would help you live more freely.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hang on a second! Who were the first two contestants with Swiftflies?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Tighnari was first, and as for the second... It's being discussed right now.
:{{DIcon}} It's being discussed?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 kaveh 01.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Hey, Alhaitham, I think I've come up with a good idea.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 kaveh 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Second place gets two points, right? Can't Madam Faruzan and I split the points between us?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Quite the imagination you have there. I've read the Championship handbook from cover to cover, and I never saw any rule which permits that.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 kaveh 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Then we can just add a rule.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 alhaitham 05.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Do you really think I'd do that?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 kaveh 04.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' C'mon, you're not going to stand in the way of my victory, are you?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 alhaitham 06.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Well, you're free to send the organizing committee an application outlining your naive proposal. They'll get back to you within three working days.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 kaveh 05.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Three working days? It'll be too late by then!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 alhaitham 07.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Unfortunately for you, even dreaming is gonna cost you.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ah, Paimon gets it now. Kaveh and Faruzan found the second Swiftfly together, but the rules say that only one person can get the points...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 faruzan 01.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Ah well, the rules are the rules. Since you call me "Madam" and politely asked for my help, I shall give you these points.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' So I'll put the points under Kaveh's name, then?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 kaveh 06.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' No. If I take these points, won't that only detract from your contributions, Madam Faruzan?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 kaveh 07.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' You might be alright with that, but I cannot do it, not in good conscience.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 faruzan 02.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' I don't have any problem with it. There are two more rounds, after all. Losing one isn't a major setback.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 faruzan 03.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' But if you insist, I have another method &mdash; we can draw lots to see who will receive the points.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 kaveh 08.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' L&mdash;Lots, huh...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 faruzan 04.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' What? Is there something wrong with that idea?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 kaveh 09.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...No. Let's do it.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Alright, I'll get the paper needed for the lots. Give me a moment.
:{{Black Screen|Everybody watches Kaveh suffer a glorious and forthright defeat in the game of lots.}}
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 kaveh 10.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Ugh, seriously...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 faruzan 05.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' I'm sorry, but it appears that luck was on my side this time.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 kaveh 11.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' No, you do deserve it... I'm just lamenting my bad luck. Perhaps... *sigh* Perhaps that's why my life is rife with troubles...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 alhaitham 08.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Indeed, it's rare to see anyone with such terrible luck be so willing to decide victory via lots.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 kaveh 12.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' And what would you know about that? I just...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 alhaitham 09.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' We can save bickering for later. Record the points under Faruzan, and that'll finally bring the first round to a close.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 alhaitham 10.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' The second round will be held in the desert. We'll be moving our commentator's stand over to Aaru Village.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 alhaitham 11.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Let's meet up in Aaru Village once everything is ready. I'll announce the details of the second round then.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 alhaitham 12.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Till then, you have some free time. I'm off the clock at this point, so it's farewell for now.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 kaveh 13.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Wait, Alhaitham! You...! *sigh*
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 nilou 05.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Don't be upset, Kaveh. Sighing can carry away your good luck, you know.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 kaveh 14.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Oh, so that's how it works? In that case, I'll take in some deep breaths. Maybe that'll help make up for all the luck I've lost!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 kaveh 15.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' *deep breath* It's really no big deal. Two points aren't enough to decide victory or defeat just yet.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 kaveh 16.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I'll win the next round, you'll see!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 faruzan 06.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Looks like you've managed to pick yourself back up, young man. Good. I must warn you, though, that I'm quite familiar with the desert. You'll have to try your best if you don't want to lose.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 kaveh 17.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I'm no stranger to the desert either, I'll be fine. Alright then, that's enough chit-chat for now. I'm going to check the area out.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... So the current standings are Tighnari in first place, Faruzan in second, and Layla in third.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess we should also take a nice break before the next round starts. But where should we go first?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 morgiana 01.ogg}} '''Morgiana:''' Why, you two look a little lost. If you're not sure where to start enjoying the Akademiya Extravaganza, then may I suggest that you have a chat with our boss?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Your boss? Who's that? Do we know them?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 morgiana 02.ogg}} '''Morgiana:''' Hehe, well, only the most famous merchant in all of Sumeru &mdash; Lord Sangemah Bay!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you mean Dori!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 20 morgiana 03.ogg}} '''Morgiana:''' Precisely! Our boss sent me to inform you two that she'll be waiting for you at Sumeru City's north gate.

;(Approach Dori)
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 dori 01.ogg}} '''Dori:''' Oho! Well, if it isn't {{Traveler}} and Paimon!
:{{Introductory Note|Dori}}
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, Dori! Are you here to attend the Akademiya Extravaganza too?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 dori 02.ogg}} '''Dori:''' Of course! People are practically flocking to Sumeru City. You couldn't ask for a better opportunity to do business!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 dori 03.ogg}} '''Dori:''' This is one of the entrances into the city, and it's very close to the Wisdom Gala booths. There'll be an endless stream of customers! Hehe, I can already hear the Mora going "clink-clink-clink" as they fill my coin pouch...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 dori 04.ogg}} '''Dori:''' Well, is there anything you'd like to purchase? We've got everything you need and deals that can't be beat!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... Well, do you have anything to eat?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 dori 05.ogg}} '''Dori:''' Wait, we're celebrating the Extravaganza, and you're only thinking of eating&mdash; ahem, I mean, of cooourse we've got lots of things to eat! That said, I recommend that you also consider some of the great bargains we have going on.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 dori 06.ogg}} '''Dori:''' The Wisdom Gala is about to begin, and once it starts, each of the Darshans will prepare a small challenge for everyone.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 dori 07.ogg}} '''Dori:''' And, just between us, I have some Super Booster Supplements for sale. Eat just one to boost both your strength and dexterity for a short time, allowing you to overcome any challenge!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No thanks, we'll pass. These little challenges are gonna be a cinch for the two of us, just you watch!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Anyway, Paimon just wants something to eat, please. If you don't have any food, then we'll go somewhere else.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 dori 08.ogg}} '''Dori:''' Alright, alright, Mora is Mora, after all. What would you like to eat?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmmm... Well, Paimon's pretty hungry right now. Do you have any [[tahchin]]?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 dori 09.ogg}} '''Dori:''' Let me see...
:;(Two Eremites walk by)
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 ahmu 01.ogg}} '''Amur:''' This is a huge job, isn't it?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 ganjul 01.ogg}} '''Ganjul:''' If this works out, we'll be set...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 dori 10.ogg}} '''Dori:''' Here you go! Two servings of tahchin! See? I told you there's nothing Lord Sangemah Bay can't procure!
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yay! Uh... Huh? What are you looking at, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} I thought I saw someone just now...
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh? Who? Someone we know?
:{{DIcon}} Never mind...
:{{DIcon}} They're gone.
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 dori 11.ogg}} '''Dori:''' Was it someone suspicious? Have we attracted some unwanted attention?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? What's happening, Dori? Is there something else going on?
:{{A|vo xyjeq001 21 dori 12.ogg}} '''Dori:''' I don't know who you saw just now, but I do have some hard-to-come-by information about the Extravaganza. If you want to know more, we can talk business later.
