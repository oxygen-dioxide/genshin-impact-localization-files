Hughes the adventurer is a Wind Glider enthusiast. He's traveling the world, and it seems he has discovered a few perfect gliding spots recently...

During the event period, Travelers can complete time-trial gliding challenges to win Talent Level-Up Materials, Primogems, Mora, and Hero's Wit!<ref>Twitter: [https://twitter.com/GenshinImpact/status/1333984233879203841 Official Twitter Announcement]</ref>

==Requirements==
* Reach Adventure Rank 20 or above.
* Complete [[Hughes]]' quest [[Fly High]].

==Details==
In the Gliding Challenge, Travelers can put their gliding skills to the test in a total of {{Color|Geo|seven}} different gliding courses.

Over the seven-day event period, {{Color|Geo|one gliding course will unlock each day}}. Look for the icon on the map, head to the starting point, and complete the challenge to win rewards.

*New gliding techniques are available for the Gliding Challenge: {{Color|Geo|Sprint}} and {{Color|Geo|Ascend}}, which are only available during the challenge itself.

*The quicker you complete the course and the more {{Color|Geo|insignia}} you collect, the higher your score will be at the end of the challenge. Reach target scores to win medals and rewards. Aim to collect all 5 insignia.

*If you spend too long on a challenge or land for too long, you will fail the challenge and have to restart.

*{{Color|Pyro|The challenge score progress meter only records your personal best for that particular course.}}

*Before the event ends, you can attempt challenges as many times as you like to improve your top score.

*Complete new event-related missions under Fading Star to receive [[Battle Pass EXP]].

[[File:Tutorial Gliding_Challenge 2.png|200px|thumb|left]]During Gliding Challenges, you can use the Ascend skill while in flight. Using this skill will cause you to fly a certain distance upwards.

[[File:Tutorial Gliding_Challenge 3.png|200px|thumb|left]]During Gliding Challenges, you can {{Color|Geo|collect particles in the air to charge up their Sprint ability}}. Once this ability charges fully, you may use the Sprint ability to hurl yourself forward through the air. You can store up to {{Color|Geo|a maximum of two full Sprint charges at once}}.

Other tips:
*[[Wind Breaker]]s (unusual orange Anemo Rings) slow the player passing through it (debuff removed by passing through a normal Anemo Ring). Avoiding this type of Anemo Ring can help save time.
