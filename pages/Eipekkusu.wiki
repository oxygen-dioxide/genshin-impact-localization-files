{{Location Intro|{{Lang|'''Eipekkusu'''|ja=天井屋|ja_rm=Tenjou-ya<!-- assumed reading-->|ja_tl=Ceiling Store}}|description=<p>The shop is owned by [[Kaede]] and mainly sells souvenirs such as Inazuman novels, porcelain tanuki dolls and statues of fox spirits that represent good fortune, as well as having sold statues of the [[Ei|Almighty Shogun]] in the past.</p><!--

--><p>Due to the [[Sakoku Decree|lockdown]] put into effect by the [[Kanjou Commission]], there haven't been many customers except for [[Snezhnaya]]n merchants.</p>}}

==Trivia==
* The shop's name is a Japanese romanization of the word {{Lang|"apex"|ja=エイペックス|ja_rm=eipekkusu}}.
* The Japanese version uses a name that translates to the "Ceiling Store." Considering it does not make sense for the business of the shop, it is probably a kind of {{w|Yagō|yagou}} lit. "store title", or a house name (also used as an unofficial surname) passed down within commoner classes such as merchants, farmers, and actors in the feudal period of Japan.
