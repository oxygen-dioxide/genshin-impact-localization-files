{{Lang|'''Eipekkusu'''|ja=天井屋|ja_rm=Tenjou-ya<!-- assumed reading-->|ja_tl=Ceiling Store}} is a souvenir shop in [[Ritou]], [[Inazuma]], which is owned by [[Kaede]].

The shop mainly sells souvenirs such as Inazuman novels, porcelain tanuki dolls and statues of fox spirits that represent good fortune, as well as having sold statues of the [[Ei|Almighty Shogun]] in the past.

Due to the [[Sakoku Decree|lockdown]] put into effect by the [[Kanjou Commission]], there haven't been many customers except for [[Snezhnaya]]n merchants.

==Trivia==
* The shop's name is a Japanese romanization of the word {{Lang|"apex"|ja=エイペックス|ja_rm=eipekkusu}}.
* The Japanese version uses a name that translates to the "Ceiling Store". Considering it does not make sense for the business of the shop, it is probably a kind of ''{{w|Yagō|yagou}}'' (lit. "store title"), or a house name (also used as an unofficial surname) passed down within commoner classes such as merchants, farmers, and actors in the feudal period of Japan.
