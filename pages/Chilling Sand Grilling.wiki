However, be sternly reminded that you cannot ingest the juices of such a plant."<br />The latest edition of the [[Matra]] manual has this to say concerning this species of desert shrub.<br />Many a Matra crossing the desert has been spared much grief by this description. That said, they have also grown curious as to who the [[General Mahamatra]] must have consulted to improve their manuals so ー how does this person have such a keen understanding of all the plants that they might encounter?
