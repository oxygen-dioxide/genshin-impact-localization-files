==Dialogue ==
===Yashiori Island===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Chouji:''' Hello, {{Traveler}}! How've you been?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's been great, and you?
:{{DIcon}} You stole my line!
:'''Paimon:''' Haha, that's 'cause you're too slow!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, gunning for an extra meal, are you?
:'''Paimon:''' Of course. Paimon could always go for an extra meal!
:{{DIcon}} You misunderstand. I mean you're the extra meal.
:'''Paimon:''' Hey now!
:'''Chouji:''' Pfft... Hahaha!
:'''Chouji:''' All right, all right, you guys, please stop fighting.
:'''Chouji:''' I'm doing fine. But I'd like to ask you for another favor.
:{{DIcon}} Sure, shoot. What is it?
:{{DIcon}} I'll see what I can do.
:'''Chouji:''' Well, it's nothing special. I just need you to help me get some more crystals, {{Traveler}}.
:'''Chouji:''' Believe me, I'll reward you for your help... As long as you trust me.
:{{DIcon}} I trust you, but...
:'''Chouji:''' But...?
:{{DIcon}} Why?
:{{DIcon}} You promised to give me an explanation.
:'''Paimon:''' Right. We still don't know why you need so much Crystal Marrow!
:'''Chouji:''' Well... I need money to travel so that I can find my mother, so I need to trade the crystals for money.
:{{DIcon}} But the [[Shogunate]] has monopolized the crystal market.
:{{DIcon}} You know that these crystals aren't easy to sell, don't you?
:'''Chouji:''' I know, but I'll find my own way!
:{{DIcon}} You're playing a dangerous game here.
:{{DIcon}} I'm worried about your safety.
:'''Chouji:''' ...
:'''Paimon:''' We're friends, aren't we, Chouji?
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe we can help you again, just like last time!
:'''Paimon:''' Besides, you promised that you'd reward us. So we have the right to know about things that might endanger your {{sic}} and thus affect our reward, right?
:{{DIcon}} What a mercenary philosophy...
:'''Chouji:''' Pfft... Paimon's right, though.
:'''Chouji:''' I don't collect crystal entirely for money.
:'''Chouji:''' I've been thinking... What if Mom and Dad get the disease caused by the [[Tatarigami]], just like everyone else?
:'''Chouji:''' Maybe these crystals can be used to make medicine. They grew from the bones of the giant serpent, after all...
:'''Chouji:''' And Mr. [[Yasumoto]] also mentioned that these crystals may be useful.
:'''Paimon:''' But you can't be sure if that's correct, can you?
:'''Chouji:''' Maybe not, but we don't have anything else to go on.
:'''Chouji:''' When I find Mom... or maybe even Dad, I'll take them to [[Sumeru]]. People say that they've got cure for this strange disease there.
:'''Chouji:''' Before that, I can't give up any hope of finding a treatment.
:'''Chouji:''' Well, I've said enough. Still want to help me?
:{{DIcon}} Do you even need to ask?
:{{DIcon}} I hope you can make good use of the crystals.
:'''Chouji:''' Thank you! I won't forget this!

;(Talk to Chouji again)
:'''Chouji:''' {{Traveler}}, you're back. Did you bring any crystals?
:{{DIcon}} Yes, I did.
:;(Upon submitting 12 Crystal Marrow)
::'''Chouji:''' This should be enough Crystal Marrow. Now it's time to start my adventure!
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon's still worried about this kid...
::{{DIcon}} Take care of yourself now!
::{{DIcon}} Keep in touch!
::'''Chouji:''' Yeah!
::'''Paimon:''' Hey, Chouji, you'd better stop running your mouth! You should feel lucky that you met us... otherwise, you'd get beaten up!
::'''Paimon:''' Also, in case any bad guys want to fish for any information from you, be sure not to tell them the truth! Make up a story!
::'''Paimon:''' And also...
::{{DIcon}} Paimon's turning into a naggy old granny.
::'''Paimon:''' Anyone would be worried if a little kid like him went out on an adventure all by himself!
::{{DIcon}} I have faith in him.
::'''Paimon:''' ...Hmph, sure you do.
::'''Chouji:''' Hahahaha! Thank you, thank you both!
::'''Chouji:''' I hope we'll meet again.
::'''Paimon:''' Promise Paimon that you'll stay safe...
::'''Chouji:''' I'll be fine!
::'''Chouji:''' Next, I'll head to Tatarasuna, where Mom used to work. Maybe someone can tell me if she's been there.
::'''Chouji:''' And then, I'll try to go to Narukami Island and travel to [[Snezhnaya]] via merchant ship. After that, I'll just see how things go.
::'''Paimon:''' ...
::{{DIcon}} Do you know what you're talking about?
::{{DIcon}} Do you understand the risks you're taking?
::'''Chouji:''' If no one went on adventures because they didn't know all the risks... Well, there wouldn't be any adventurers in the world, would there?
::'''Paimon:''' Ugh, this kid is sooo irritating...
::{{DIcon}} Alright then...
::{{DIcon}} Just be careful.
::'''Chouji:''' Hahaha, don't you worry about me!
::'''Chouji:''' You guys have a safe trip! By the way, {{Traveler}}, I hope that you can find your family soon, too!
::'''Paimon:''' Yup! Thank you!
:{{DIcon}} I'm on my way.
::'''Chouji:''' Take your time. You can take a rest here too if you like.

===Tatarasuna===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Chouji:''' Hello, we meet again!
:'''Paimon:''' Wait a minute. Let Paimon guess what you're about to say...
:{{DIcon}} "Please get me more Crystal Marrow..."
:'''Paimon:''' "Paimon needs them urgently, boo hoo..."
:{{DIcon}} That's what you are going to say, right!
:'''Chouji:''' Hahaha, of course not!
:{{DIcon}} How have your travels been going?
:'''Chouji:''' Good. But I still haven't found any trace of my Mom...
:'''Paimon:''' It doesn't matter. We'll help you, too, right, {{Traveler}}?
:{{DIcon}} We'll do our best.
:'''Chouji:''' Mm! I knew I could rely on you, {{Traveler}}!
{{Dialogue End}}

===Narukami Island===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Chouji:''' Hey there, {{Traveler}}, I didn't expect I'd see you again!
:'''Paimon:''' Long time no see! How's the world outside of Yashiori Island?
:'''Chouji:''' It's a lot wealthier than my hometown. They have a lot of good food and fun things to do. But... I can't say that I really like it.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh? Why's that?
:'''Chouji:''' The people here all seem to be missing something...
:'''Chouji:''' When we used to live in Yashiori Island, [[Raiden Shogun|Her Excellency]] was a distant yet calming presence to us... We didn't care where she was, but we believed that she was right there, watching us, protecting us, deciding how we should live our lives and what kind of people we should become...
:'''Chouji:''' But here, Her Excellency covers everything and oppresses everything...
:'''Chouji:''' *sigh* I'm not really sure how to put it...
:'''Chouji:''' By the way, have you found anything concerning my mother?
:{{DIcon}} We're still trying.
:'''Chouji:''' It's okay. Tell me when you have any news.
<!--the game says that "Gazing Three Thousand Miles Away" has been completed after talking to him; now I'm not sure if all this dialogue is supposed to be in the appropriate world quest page or not-->
