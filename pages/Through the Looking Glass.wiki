{{Dialogue Start}}
;(After completing the 6 Looking Glass puzzles)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? That painting...

;(Upon entering the Looking Glass with the sunflower)
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon's head is spinning... Is this...? Is that Canotila?

;(Talk to Canotila)
:'''Canotila:''' Hey, we meet again. Hmm? You're with Paimon this time?
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Paimon was here when we meditated here the last time...
:'''Canotila:''' Is that so? I don't remember.
:'''Canotila:''' No matter. It's all thanks to you that I found the location of the Looking Glass and the flowers that are about to bloom, and deepened my understanding of this place.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Talking to Canotila is as confusing as ever.
:'''Puppy:''' Woof!
:'''Canotila:''' Hmm? But...
:'''Puppy:''' Woof, woof!
:'''Canotila:''' Okay, okay! I hear you.
:'''Paimon:''' (Hmm...? She's talking to the puppy? Could it be that Melusine can generally communicate with dogs?)
:{{DIcon}} (How incredible.)
:'''Canotila:''' Well, I guess that's that. I'll see you next time. Hmph! Even if you said that, I'm still coming back to play with you.
:'''Canotila:''' Let's go, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, Paimon!
:;(The player and Canotila are teleported to [[Canotila and the Book of Revealing]])
:'''Canotila:''' Well. Here we are again...
:'''Paimon:''' What is it?
:'''Canotila:''' I feel really bad for saying this since everyone's so nice to me, all of you, but...
:'''Canotila:''' Don't you feel the real world is so frighteningly dull? Don't you think the world in the Book is far more beautiful?
:{{DIcon}} I think so, too.
::'''Paimon:''' Really? You think so too, huh?
:{{DIcon}} I don't think so.
::'''Canotila:''' Is that so...? Maybe that's right. I'm not normal.
:{{DIcon}} There's no difference to me.
::'''Canotila:''' Looks like {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}} is the toughest of all.
:'''Canotila:''' I still feel the world in the Book of Revealing is much more appealing. There are dew-covered petals everywhere, and I've finally made friends with the puppy.
:'''Paimon:''' That puppy... Uh, Canotila, can you communicate with dogs?
:'''Canotila:''' Hm? Of course not. However, the puppy in the Book of Revealing is special. Or maybe, I'm special?
:'''Canotila:''' I've been meditating to travel to the world in the Book, and then one day, the puppy's usual barking turned into something I could understand.
:'''Canotila:''' As for what we talked about... He asked me to go and never come back.
:'''Canotila:''' But... I still want to see the sunflowers bloom...
:{{DIcon}} ...
:'''Paimon:''' I&mdash;Is that so... Take care, Canotila! We'll be going!
