==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
Giulietta is a flute maker in Fontaine. At some point, she took out a loan with the [[Fatui]], only to seemingly default on it afterwards. The Fatui proceeded to look for her so she could repay her debt, sending a newly certified [[Fatui Pyro Agent|agent]] after her. Presumably, she obtained an order for her flutes, but due to her fear of the Fatui, overslept and missed her boat to [[Sumeru]].

While wandering around [[Petrichor]], the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] run into her. She tells them of her plight and they agree to transport her to [[Bayda Harbor]], where she pays them for their trouble. Soon afterwards, [[Giustino]] overhears that they came from Petrichor and asks for a ride back to town. They do so, and when they arrive, they are waylaid by the agent, who had been overly excited and mistook Giustino for Giulietta. After clearing the misunderstanding, the agent departs for Sumeru to continue tracking her down.
