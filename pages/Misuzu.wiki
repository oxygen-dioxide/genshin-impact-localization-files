{{Lang|'''Misuzu'''|ja=美鈴|ja_rm=Misuzu}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in {{Quest|Rise Up, Golden Soul}}. She is the wife of [[Sugimoto]] and the mother of [[Daisuke]].

==Profile==
<!-- detailed story/lore information goes here -->
Misuzu and her family live in [[Inazuma City]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Oni's Justice}}</ref> One day, while Daisuke was away from their house, Misuzu and Sugimoto were attacked and abducted by [[Nogata]]'s gang of vagrants (including the Blue Oni [[Takuya]]). They were imprisoned in the vagrants' [[Crumbling Guilt|hideout]] and Misuzu was very worried about Daisuke, not knowing whether or not he was safe. Though the captives, Misuzu and Sugimoto included, were fearful of what the vagrants might do to them, Takuya always defended them from the worst of it and snuck them food at night. Because of this, Misuzu notes that Takuya seems less like a hardened criminal and more like a child who "made some poor choices." When the captives are rescued by the [[Traveler]] and [[Arataki Itto]], Misuzu immediately asks whether Daisuke is safe. She is glad to hear that he is, and also that Itto wants to set Takuya back on the right track.

After they are freed, Misuzu and Sugimoto are able to reunite with Daisuke. They thank the Traveler, Itto, and [[Granny Oni]] for their help before heading back to Inazuma City.
