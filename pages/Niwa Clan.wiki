The '''Niwa Clan'''<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Kagotsurube Isshin}}</ref> was an [[Inazuma]]n family and a practitioner of the [[Isshin Art]], one of the schools in the [[Raiden Gokaden]].

==Overview==
Over 500 years ago, [[Niwa Nagamitsu]] apprenticed under [[Futsu Masayoshi]] alongside [[Kaedehara Kagemitsu]] and [[Akame Mitsunaga]]. The three later became known as the "Isshin Sansaku," or the great three masters of the Isshin Art.<ref name="Haran">{{Ref/Weapon|Haran Geppaku Futsu}}</ref><ref group="Note">The names Kagemitsu, Nagamitsu, and Sanenaga (Mitsunaga) are direct references to three master swordsmiths of the Osafune School, collectively known as the {{lang|"Three Great Masters"|ja=三作|ja_rm=sansaku}}. While the characters in ''sansaku'' literally translate to "three works," which is how the English localization interpreted its usage in Haran Geppaku Futsu's description, it was historically used to refer to the swordsmiths themselves.</ref>

Around 100 years ago, the head of the Niwa family disappeared and his son, Niwa Yoshinori, was adopted into the [[Kaedehara Clan]]. Yoshinori was later part of the group investigating [[Kunikuzushi]]'s sabotage of the [[Raiden Shogun]]'s Goshintou forging diagram. While pursuing the swordsmiths who fled out of fear of the Shogun's punishment, Yoshinori, the Yashiro Commission head, and their accompanying samurai were intercepted and defeated by Scaramouche. Upon noticing Yoshinori's appearance, Scaramouche questioned whether he had any relation to the name "Niwa." After receiving an affirmative, Scaramouche decided to spare them, leaving only a vague message: "Tell her this. My name is Kunikuzushi."<ref name="Palace">{{Ref/Quest|The Palace, Dyed in Black (Quest)}}</ref> Scaramouche's relation to the Niwa family is unclear.

==Trivia==
*In [[Kagotsurube Isshin]]'s description, the Niwa Clan is said to have been masters at clay tempering.

===Etymology===
*The family name {{lang|''Niwa''|ja=丹羽}} is possibly derived from the {{lang|{{w|Niwa clan}}|ja=丹羽氏}}, a Japanese samurai clan which rose to prominence during the {{w|Sengoku period}}.
**At least nine generations of the Niwa clan used {{lang|''Naga-''|ja=長}} as the first character in given names. Niwa Nagamitsu, one of the two named members of the Niwa Family, uses that same character in his given name.
