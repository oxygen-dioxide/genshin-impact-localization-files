{{Description|The game that passes down Mondstadt's history, Windtrace, is open once more in a new form! Play as the resisting Rebels and evade capture by the Hunter sent by the aristocracy by competing against one another in the Contested Zones until the hour of the hunt ends and obtain Windtrace Coins during the game to earn various rewards.}}
'''Windtrace: Seekers and Strategy''' is an [[Event]] in [[Version 4.6]].

==Event Details==
===Duration===
* 2024/05/14 10:00 - 2024/05/27 03:59

===Requirements===
* [[Adventure Rank]] 20 or above

===Summary===
* During the event, Travelers can participate in the Windtrace game to obtain [[Primogem]]s, [[Hero's Wit]], [[Weapon Ascension Material]]s, and other rewards.
* On each of the 6 days of the event after it has begun, the maximum number of [[Windtrace Coins]] you can collect is increased by 1,000. Travelers can obtain Windtrace Coins or complete Strategic Challenges to claim the corresponding rewards.
* A new mechanism "Signaling Device" has been added to this edition of Windtrace. Rebels must repair these devices while avoiding the Hunter's pursuit, while the Hunter must stop the Rebels from repairing these devices, or simply eliminate all the Rebels.
* The first time each Rebel is captured by a Hunter, they will be detained within a "Surveillance Zone" for a while. They will be released automatically once the time of imprisonment ends. Other Rebels can also approach the Surveillance Zone and help their imprisoned comrade escape. When a Rebel who has been imprisoned before is once again captured, that Rebel will be eliminated from the match.
* The Rebels will win if they repair 4 Signaling Devices within the time limit. If they fail to do so, the Hunter will be victorious. If no Rebels on the field can operate freely, e.g. all the Rebels have been captured or eliminated, the Hunter will be earn an early victory.
* In "Windtrace: Seekers and Strategy," you can earn Windtrace Coins in Solo Mode and matchmade games alongside up to 2 friends. When forming a custom Co-Op party with 3 other friends to play this game or when your Windtrace Coins have reached the current maximum, you will not obtain any Windtrace Coins.

|The current disguises in this Contested Zone are: {{Color|help|wooden barrels, wooden boxes, and wooden stumps}}.<br>This canyon is bounded on three sides by mountains, and its opening is narrow, making it hard for the Rebels to maneuver.<br>On the other hand, however, the Hunters' movements are also made predictable.<br>Victory or defeat &mdash; all rests upon a razor's edge.

==[[File:Icon Windtrace 2024-05-14.png|30px|link=]] Windward Arts==
All original Combat Talents will be replaced with "Windward Arts." Travelers can select the Windward Arts they want to use before the game starts.

Secret Favors are Windward Arts that can be picked up that replace the Elemental Burst.

===[[File:Windtrace 2024-05-14 Hunter.png|30px|link=]] Hunter===
* If you play as a Hunter in the game, after the game starts, your task is to either stop the Rebels from repairing the Signaling Devices or eliminate all Rebels within the stipulated time. The various Arts of the Hunter can be used to detect the location of the opposing side and leave them shorn of their disguises.
* <!--The more Rebels a Hunter captures in the game and the less time it takes to capture the Rebels, the more Windtrace Coins obtained. -->If the Hunter captures all the Rebels or the Rebels did not complete their task at the end of the stipulated time, victory goes to the Hunter.
* After the activity starts, the Stamina consumed by the Hunter in sprinting, climbing, and gliding will be greatly reduced.
* The Hunter's usage of the "Sensor Aura," "Mysterious Hunch," and "Capture!" Windward Arts is visible to all Rebels who have the "Co-Op Teammate Effects" graphics setting set to "On" (not "Partially Off" or "Off").
