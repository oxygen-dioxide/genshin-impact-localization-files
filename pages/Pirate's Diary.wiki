==Interactables==
===Pirate's Note===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Pirate's Note:''' (A wrinkled note with rough handwriting.)
:'''Pirate's Note:''' "...We've been entrusted with looking after the lad named [[Chouji]]. Uncle [[Onitaka]] told us to take care of him before setting sail..."
:'''Pirate's Note:''' "...We'll bring him here once that [[Inaba Kyuuzou|samurai on the broken boat]] has been dealt with."
:'''Pirate's Note:''' "...It's too cruel that he's been separated from his mother and has been forced to live alone..."
{{Dialogue End}}

===Pirate's Diary #1===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Pirate's Diary:''' (This diary looks newer. Perhaps someone took it as spoils of war.)
:'''Pirate's Diary:''' "...Most of the [[Shogunate]] samurai stragglers wandering across the island have been dealt with. We need to use them to send a warning to the others..."
:'''Pirate's Diary:''' "...We should mark our borders with their personal effects. That'll show those Shogunate numbskulls that they shouldn't get too close..."
{{Dialogue End}}

===Pirate's Diary #2===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Pirate's Diary:''' (This old diary seems to have seen a lot of use. It's full of traces of wear-and-tear.)
:'''Pirate's Diary:''' "...A miner came here, and he looked awful. We let him stay here for a few days and he recovered decently..."
:'''Pirate's Diary:''' "...It seems that his wife and his son are still on the island, but he rejected our offer to help him find them. Instead, he thanked us and just left. What a strange man..."
:'''Pirate's Diary:''' "...Brother Takano has a high fever that won't abate. Many of us have been awakened by nightmares in the middle of the night. Everyone's on tenterhooks, and we're not feeling too great. Is it a seasonal thing?"
{{Dialogue End}}

===Pirate's Diary #3===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Pirate's Diary:''' (An aged sailing log, all torn and falling apart.)
:'''Pirate's Diary:''' "Uncle Onitaka is going to send people to [[Sumeru]]... Every camp must help to raise money for the journey... "
:'''Pirate's Diary:''' "...There was naval battle a few days in the eastern sea. It might be good opportunity to scavenge some loot..."
:'''Pirate's Diary:''' "...I pray that Uncle Onitaka has a safe trip... Even though we, who have abandoned the Shogun, have no god to pray to any longer..."
{{Dialogue End}}

===Pirate's Diary #4===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Pirate's Diary:''' (This well-preserved diary bears the scent of the sea-breeze.)
:'''Pirate's Diary:''' "...We tied up two spies from the Shogun's army and threw them into the sea. We should all stay sharp. This is no place of peace..."
:'''Pirate's Diary:''' "...We should focus on robbing outlanders and their ships. Most outlanders who can enter Inazuma are rich and unwary..."
:'''Pirate's Diary:''' "...They're far easier targets than Shogunate ships..."
:'''Pirate's Diary:''' "If the war between the Shogunate and [[Watatsumi Army|Sangonomiya]] continues, and we continue to plunder, perhaps the great age of piracy might soon be revived. We shall be like [[Ako Domeki|Domeki]] 500 years ago.
{{Dialogue End}}

===Pirate's Diary #5===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Pirate's Diary:''' (This diary is soaked, but parts of its contents are still readable.)
:'''Pirate's Diary:''' "...Gonrokurou also vowed not to return to the army. He will bring his wife and kids here once things get better..."
:'''Pirate's Diary:''' "...It's real funny. Not long ago, we were still enemies fighting each other sword-to-sword &mdash; fighting for our precious lords and false ideals..."
:'''Pirate's Diary:''' "...To no longer be bound by complex morality or by hierarchy and obligation. To breathe the free air for the first time, and to receive freedom's fruit in turn..."
:'''Pirate's Diary:''' "...Brothers, let's unite. Even in the face of the [[Raiden Shogun]]'s wave-sundering blade..."
{{Dialogue End}}

===Incomplete Notes===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Incomplete Notes:''' (Most of the diary's pages have been torn out. It looks like the pirates didn't want them to fall into the hands of outsiders.)
:'''Incomplete Notes:''' "...Uncle Onitaka set sail to send [[Chouji's Mother|a woman]] away. According to her, the situation on the island is very bad indeed..."
:'''Incomplete Notes:''' "...A ship was stranded in the thunderstorm last night. It was a [[Watatsumi Army|Sangonomiya]] ship, and it was badly damaged..."
:'''Incomplete Notes:''' "...It looks like the Shogunate won the naval battle last night. Well, when two fight each other, the third party wins..."
:'''Incomplete Notes:''' "...There was [[Inaba Kyuuzou|a samurai]] on the broken boat. Tough as nails, too. We've lost a few brothers, and even Kai was... We'll get him for sure..."
