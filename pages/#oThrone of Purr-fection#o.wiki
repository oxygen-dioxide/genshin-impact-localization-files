|description    = A combination of cat furnishings forming the shape of a throne reimagined by [[Tubby]] based on the "[[Throne of Meower]]." While preserving the yarn ornaments and soft pallet design, Tubby replaced the original raspberry-red theme, which was meant to stimulate the playful instincts of cats, with a calming blue hue. This alteration makes the throne more suitable for cats with a serene and reserved disposition. Hence, this display has been bestowed with a new name &mdash; the "Throne of Purr-fection."<br>It is said amongst cats that "When the fated moment arrives, the bowl shall be filled with delicious food, and the cat called upon shall enjoy that meal, ascend to the throne, and take the crown of undisputed ruler..." As such, you can always find many cats surrounding the throne, waiting for that moment of destiny to arrive...
