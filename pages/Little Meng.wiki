'''Little Meng''' is an open-world [[NPC]] in [[Liyue Harbor]]. He can be found playing with [[Little Fei]] and [[Little Lulu]] on the deck of one of the ships anchored at the harbor.

After finishing the commission series starting with ''[[Ahoy! A Pirate's Growth for Ye!]]'', Little Meng leaves and goes to [[Sumeru]].<ref group="Note">After finishing the first quest in that series, Little Lulu and Little Fei immediately change location and talk about Little Meng's decision to go to Sumeru, and Little Meng is not present but can still appear for ''[[Pirate Invasion, in Liyue Harbor!]]''. However, Little Meng does not decide to go to Sumeru until the third quest in that series, when it is decided for him. He spends the next three commissions in that series still in Liyue, preparing for the trip.</ref>
