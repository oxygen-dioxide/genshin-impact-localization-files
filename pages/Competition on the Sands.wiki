{{Quest Description|The Interdarshan Championship has entered the second round. This round takes place in the desert. Head to the Aaru Village sub-venue to see how things are going...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Use [[Nahida]]'s [[All Schemes to Know]] on Alhaitham, optional)
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 30 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' (The weather today might affect this round.)

;(Use Nahida's All Schemes to Know on Nilou, optional)
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 30 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' (I'm not sweating too much, am I? Oh, it'd be so embarrassing if that was caught on Kamera...)

;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 kaveh 01.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Um, is it me, or are the bags under your eyes even darker than during the last round? Are you alright?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 layla 01.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Thanks for the concern, Kaveh. I just... haven't been sleeping well lately...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 layla 02.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Even though I try to fall asleep, I can't get the Championship out of my head... and before I know it, it's morning again.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 kaveh 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' *sigh* I know the feeling. That happens to me too when I'm agonizing over my blueprints.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 layla 03.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Do you have any tips for dealing with that?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 kaveh 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' To be honest with you, no. You could say there are many things that don't have a quick fix, and can only be endured.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 kaveh 04.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Hmm, I suppose you can think of it as something akin to an illness. Sometimes there's no effective cure, so you just have to let things run their course.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 kaveh 05.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I don't know what's stressing you out, but I can feel all the anxiety and pressure coming from you. The next round's about to start, so chin up and do your best.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 layla 04.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Oh, okay... You do your best, too.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Looks like everyone's here. I will now explain the second round to you all.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' There are three Ley Line Disruptors buried in the area around Aaru Village.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' These devices can imitate the effects of Ley Line disruption and will constantly interfere with the environment. Your goal is to shut them down.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 alhaitham 04.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' The first three who manage to finish this task will be awarded four, three, and two points, accordingly.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 alhaitham 05.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Note that each person may only bring a set amount of food and water with them, and that leaving the designated competition zone will result in disqualification.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 faruzan 01.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Well, what do you think? Want to team up again?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 faruzan 02.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' I shall consider letting you have the points on account of what happened in the previous round.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 kaveh 06.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' That's alright. I've been here many times, and in any case, machines are one of my specialties. I doubt this will be particularly difficult.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 faruzan 03.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' It's good to see such confidence in a youngster like yourself. I also happen to be well acquainted with this place. Let's see who will find these devices first.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 faruzan 04.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' But aside from us, you should remember that there's a favorite for champion. We must be careful of him...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A favorite to win? Who is it?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 faruzan 05.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Shh, not so loud. I mean that boy, Tighnari.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 faruzan 06.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' He took first place in the previous round, and if he does so again this time, we may as well declare this competition over.
;(Before completing {{Quest|The Unanswerable Problems}})
::{{A|vo xyjeq002 11 faruzan 07.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' That boy knows a great deal &mdash; perhaps he might yet follow the trail of some desert creature to the devices.
;(After completing {{Quest|The Unanswerable Problems}})
::{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 faruzan 07.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' I heard that you solved the Avidya Forest's Ley Line effluence problem with him not long ago. Since this round involves resolving a machine-simulated Ley Line disruption, it should be a simple matter for him...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, that's true. It does look like his odds of winning are pretty high!
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 faruzan 08.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' He already has Collei, who is an excellent pupil. If he were to win this round as well, then wouldn't we just be letting him have all the fun?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 faruzan 09.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' As his senior, it's my solemn duty to prevent such an inequitable arrangement from happening. I'm off!
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 kaveh 07.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I'll get going as well. See you later.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' ...How are you feeling?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I think I'm okay. But I'll take things slowly for now.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 layla 05.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Is this all the water we're getting?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Sorry, that's what the rules say...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' While this round seems to be about how quickly you can shut down the devices, it's also testing your ability to survive in tough conditions.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 layla 06.ogg}} '''Layla:''' I knew it'd be harder than I had expected.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 layla 07.ogg}} '''Layla:''' So we'll either need to find the devices as quickly as possible, or we'll have to save our energy and wait for an opportunity... Okay, I'll head out shortly. Thanks a lot, Nilou.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' You're welcome. Please take care of yourself!
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, there goes everybody.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, who should we visit this time? Let Paimon think...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, right! Didn't Faruzan say that Tighnari's the favorite to win? Let's go look for him first!

;(Talk to Nilou or Alhaitham again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog xyjeq002 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Now that the round's begun, who do you think will win, Alhaitham?
:{{A|vo dialog xyjeq002 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' The ones who find the disruptors will win.
:{{A|vo dialog xyjeq002 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Well, um, yes... but aren't you just repeating the rules?
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|Alhaitham announced that the main assignment for this round is to shut down the Ley Line Disruptors in the desert. Tighnari has become the favorite to win, but what is he doing right now?}}

:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Weird, the locator says that he should be around here somewhere.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Tighnari! Can you hear us?
:{{DIcon}} He's over there.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You're right! Oh no, it looks like he's fainted. We have to help him!
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Tighnari, are you okay?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' It's... so hot...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, so you passed out because of the heat! Are you not used to getting around in the desert?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' That's right... I usually bring lots of water when I go to the desert, precisely to avoid this situation.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I went through all my water very quickly, and with the effects of the disturbed Ley Lines, I started feeling dizzy.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' My ancestors, the [[Valuka Shuna]], were originally from the desert. But I guess this is what happens when a species migrates &mdash; they become intolerant of their original environment...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' This isn't the time for a history lesson. Let's get you some water&mdash;
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 wanderer 01.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Humans, such fragile beings. Your bodies can't even survive extreme changes in the environment.
:{{DIcon}} Why are you here?
:{{DIcon}} And you consider yourself strong?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 wanderer 02.ogg}} '''{{Wanderer}}:''' Here, take this. Let him drink it.

:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you serious? This had better be just normal water... Hey! You're leaving already?
:{{DIcon}} It seems it really is just water.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon really doesn't get that guy... What's he up to? Anyway, let's focus on helping Tighnari drink some water first...
:{{Black Screen|Tighnari starts to recover after getting some water...}}
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 tighnari 05.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I'm feeling a little better now. Thanks, you two.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, it wasn't just the two of us. Just now&mdash;
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Found you at last.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cyno! You're here too!
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I was concerned, so I came back to check on you. Will you be able to go on?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 tighnari 06.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' The fur on my tail is so dry it's practically been singed right off. I don't see any purpose in pushing myself beyond what is reasonable.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 tighnari 07.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' It appears I'm not suited to this particular round &mdash; I should probably just return to Aaru Village and rest.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? So you're backing out?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 tighnari 08.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Yes. I do have my results in the first round to serve as a buffer, so even if I forfeit this round, I still have a chance to turn things around later.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 tighnari 09.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Withdrawing now will allow me to conserve my energy. Continuing to push onward would be counterproductive.
:{{DIcon}} Very decisive...
:{{DIcon}} I agree.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' A wise decision. Let's get you back to Aaru Village.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 tighnari 10.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Ugh... It's fine, I can make it back on my own...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 2 paimon 13.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, stop trying to be so polite. Come on, we'll help you back to Aaru Village!

;(Approach Layla)
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' How are you feeling now, Tighnari? Do you want to rest some more?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 cyno 01.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' There's some shade here, so we can stop for a while.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 tighnari 01.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Alright, let's do that.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 layla 01.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Oh, Cyno and Tighnari... and you've got {{Traveler}} and Paimon with you!
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, hey Layla!
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 layla 02.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Yeah, the sun was too strong, so I decided to take cover here for a while.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 layla 03.ogg}} '''Layla:''' What about you? Are you all done already?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 tighnari 02.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Unfortunately not. I'm not quite as capable as I thought... I intend to withdraw from this round. Cyno and {{Traveler}} are escorting me back to Aaru Village.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 layla 04.ogg}} '''Layla:''' W&mdash;Withdraw? Can you even do that?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 tighnari 03.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I believe the rules do provide for such a situation. Alhaitham did say that the act of leaving the competition grounds would result in disqualification from the round.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 cyno 02.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Didn't I ask you if you were alright before this? If you had just decided to withdraw then, you wouldn't have had to suffer.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 tighnari 04.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Well, I had to try, didn't I? So I tried, and it didn't work out &mdash; and now I'm backing out while I can.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 tighnari 05.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' When I get back, I'm definitely going to make a batch of sun-resistant oil. Next time I venture into the desert, I'll be prepared.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 tighnari 06.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' By the way, you're Layla, aren't you? You don't look very well yourself. Will you be alright?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 layla 05.ogg}} '''Layla:''' I did feel a little faint when I first entered the desert, but I feel a lot better after resting here for a while.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Be careful not to push yourself too hard!
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 layla 06.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Don't worry, I'm just...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 cyno 03.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Feeling the pressure?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 layla 07.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Huh? You can tell?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 cyno 04.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Your expression is similar to the ones I see on criminals' faces when I interrogate them.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 layla 08.ogg}} '''Layla:''' To tell you the truth, I'm still not sure whether I have what it takes to represent the Rtawahist Darshan in the Championship.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 layla 09.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Most people voted for me because of all the rumors surrounding me, and to be honest, those rumors don't really mean anything. Now I don't know how to deal with all the expectations they've put on me.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 layla 10.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Even the people who usually criticize me voted for me this time... So I feel like I have to live up to their expectations somehow...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 tighnari 07.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' So their expectations are putting pressure on you?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 layla 11.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Yes. Actually, I heard that you were voted in as well, Tighnari. How do you deal with it?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 tighnari 08.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' To be completely honest, I don't really feel any pressure.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 tighnari 09.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Firstly, those who expect things from you do not necessarily do so for benign reasons. On the other hand, those who do consider your feelings certainly wouldn't want you to push yourself.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 tighnari 10.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Next, we are researchers. Our primary duty is to interact with knowledge, not to meet others' expectations.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 tighnari 11.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' As for me, I took part in this competition to advertise for an academic lecture at Gandharva Ville next month. I'll obviously try my best during the competition, but I won't let any additional pressure get to me.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 tighnari 12.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' I think you can also try to find a clearly defined goal. That may help you.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 layla 12.ogg}} '''Layla:''' I understand. Thanks for your advice.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 tighnari 13.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Phew... I'm absolutely parched after talking so much.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 cyno 05.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I've still got some water with me.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 tighnari 14.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' No, I'll be alright. We aren't far from Aaru Village, so I can go the rest of the way myself. You should get back to the competition. Don't you want to win that limited-edition card?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 cyno 06.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' Yes. Alright then, your spirit will live on through me.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 tighnari 15.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' ...Hey, don't talk like that. I'm not dead, Cyno.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 tighnari 16.ogg}} '''Tighnari:''' Everyone, I'll be heading back now. See you after the round ends.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 cyno 07.ogg}} '''Cyno:''' I'll continue searching for the Ley Line Disruptors.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you feeling better now, Layla?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 layla 13.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Yeah. I feel like some of the weight has been taken off my shoulders after chatting with Tighnari.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 layla 14.ogg}} '''Layla:''' It's been a long time since I first left my hometown to come to the Akademiya, and every day here has been so precious... But of course, there have been some tough times.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 layla 15.ogg}} '''Layla:''' All sorts of complex astrological models, countless quizzes, and essays that took all my brainpower to barely finish... Each of those things are like huge boulders barreling at me, forcing me to continue running forward.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 layla 16.ogg}} '''Layla:''' When I was chosen as my Darshan's representative, it felt like another boulder was added to the ones already rolling behind me. Every time I close my eyes, I think of all the people I'd disappoint if I mess up.
:{{DIcon}} We would never be disappointed in you.
:{{DIcon}} We'd prefer you to be happy, Layla.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 layla 17.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Yeah, I think that's what Tighnari was trying to tell me.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 layla 18.ogg}} '''Layla:''' You're our good friends, which is why you didn't stop him from dropping out of this round, and why you don't feel disappointed in me.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's right! No need to feel so down!
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 layla 19.ogg}} '''Layla:''' That said, he did also say that he hopes I could have more concrete goals for taking part in this competition. I don't have any now, but I'll give that some thought.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 layla 20.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Anyway, I won't take up any more of your time. You still have to record the other contestants' progress, don't you? Perhaps they've had some breakthroughs while we've been chatting.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' True, we should go look for the others. Hmm, now who's left? Tighnari's dropped out for the round, and we just saw Cyno...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 layla 21.ogg}} '''Layla:''' You could go see how Madam Faruzan's doing. I've heard that she's quite knowledgeable about the desert, so she's probably made some progress by now...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 3 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay! Let's go look for Faruzan!

:{{A|vo xyjeq002 4 faruzan 03.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Not long after entering the desert, I discovered a Primal Construct that was acting abnormally, so I followed it all the way here.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 4 faruzan 04.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Once I got near here, it suddenly disappeared. Something unusual must be happening around this area.

:{{A|vo xyjeq002 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Tighnari gave Layla some advice, and she seems to be doing a lot better now. Cyno just started his search for the Disruptors, and as for Hat Guy... Well, who knows what he's thinking.

:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 kaveh 05.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' *sigh* Just thinking about it makes me upset. Not long after I entered the desert, I was accosted by these fellows.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 kaveh 06.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I don't know why, but they didn't leave the competition grounds, and now the Ley Line disruptions have left them confused and circling around the area.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 kaveh 07.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' The moment they saw me, they wouldn't leave me alone. They even cheated me out of my limited food supply.

:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kaveh, is this flying metal thingy yours?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 kaveh 09.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' That's right. This is my toolbox, Mehrak.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Your toolbox? It seems pretty fancy... Uh... Hey there, can you understand us?
:'''Mehrak:''' Beep-boop?
:{{DIcon}} Why's it here with you?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 kaveh 10.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Sometimes I need to carry things when I go out, so it's handy to have a portable toolbox.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, this definitely doesn't look like an ordinary toolbox, that's for sure.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 kaveh 11.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' It's a long story. When I was working in the desert, I ran into a merchant group who had a machine core they excavated from some tomb.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 kaveh 12.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' It was clearly from King Deshret's civilization. His technology still isn't fully understood, and Kshahrewar has many different opinions on this topic.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 kaveh 13.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Our current theories cannot explain such mysteries. Upon seeing such a rare, complete specimen before me, I forked over all the Mora on my person to purchase it.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 kaveh 14.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Some time back, I wanted to make an automated case that could store my offloaded items. With that core, I created Mehrak.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 kaveh 15.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' It can't understand commands that are too complex, but it can serve as my assistant and help me with things like mapping and surveying.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 kaveh 16.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Most importantly, it can't talk, so it can't give me any attitude.
:'''Mehrak:''' Beep-boop!
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 kaveh 17.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Oh, yes &mdash; thanks for helping hide the fact that I live at Alhaitham's place earlier.
:{{DIcon}} Well, Paimon was the one who gave it away in the first place.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hehe, sorry...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 kaveh 18.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' *sigh* I hope this season of my life ends soon, so I can get things back on track.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 kaveh 19.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Things just... started going downhill at some point. Maybe it all started when my mom remarried and left for Fontaine. Or maybe it all started when I spoke to Alhaitham in the library...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 kaveh 20.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Or maybe it's because constructing the Palace of Alcazarzaray burned through my funds. I'm still paying off the debt from that one... Argh, when's this going to end!?
:'''Desert Fox:''' *whine*
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 kaveh 21.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Now that I think about it, I guess we're all unlucky here.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 kaveh 22.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' It's not like any of you asked to be trapped in a Ley Line disruption... Okay, let me get you all out.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kaveh, aren't you going to look for the Ley Line Disruptors?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 kaveh 23.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Yes, but I can't just leave them here, can I?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 kaveh 24.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Oh, forget it. The more I think about this, the more I feel a headache coming on. I'll get back to searching once I get them out of here.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 kaveh 25.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Time's a-wasting &mdash; I'm off!
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kaveh looks like he's conflicted... He really wants to win, but he can't ignore those he wants to help...
:{{DIcon}} He's a unique character.
:{{DIcon}} He can only do one or the other...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's always felt like he's the type who easily gets himself into tough spots.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, Paimon doesn't mean this in an insulting way, but... he seems like the kind of guy who'd be really easy to take advantage of.

:{{DIcon}} You're certainly cruel with the truth...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Woah, someone's done already!

::{{A|vo xyjeq002 5 paimon 12a 1.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Right? Wonder who it is. Let's go back and ask Alhaitham!

:{{DIcon}} And what was that?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 7 layla 07.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Well, my fellow Rtawahist members must have all put my name forward for different reasons. And maybe a lot of them only picked me because they wanted to watch me make a fool of myself.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 7 layla 08.ogg}} '''Layla:''' But be that as it may, I believe that a lot of them genuinely do expect great things from me.

:{{A|vo xyjeq002 7 layla 10.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Of course, that comes with some amount of pressure, for sure. But now I've thought about it, I don't feel like this is something I have to do. Instead, it's something I want to do.

:{{A|vo xyjeq002 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Time to check our locator... Whoa! It looks like Kaveh and Faruzan are heading toward the same place!
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 8 layla 11.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Perhaps they're about to find the last disruptor.&nbsp;...Also, speaking of Kaveh, he's an interesting one.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Why do you say that?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 8 layla 12.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Before the second round, he had a chat with the other me. He said that worries can be like illnesses &mdash; they don't always have a magic cure. Sometimes, you just have to endure them as best you can until they run their course.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 8 layla 13.ogg}} '''Layla:''' But the way I see it, his situation is much worse than my other self's... She just hadn't found what she wanted to do at that moment, which is why she felt lost.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 8 layla 14.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Kaveh, meanwhile, knows what he wants to do &mdash; he's convinced that he has to win &mdash; and yet, he still seems conflicted...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 8 layla 15.ogg}} '''Layla:''' He doesn't have a second personality, but... somehow, he still seems like he's at odds with himself in some way.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 8 layla 16.ogg}} '''Layla:''' ...I don't know exactly how to describe it. It's like he's smiling on the outside, but there's no joy inside. Only sorrow.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 8 layla 17.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Still, who knows. He must be more experienced than me &mdash; maybe he's just better at dealing with it all than I am.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 8 layla 18.ogg}} '''Layla:''' Oh, but back to the topic of wrapping up... Shouldn't you be getting back to the action to record how everything plays out? Last one, then the round's over.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, true. Okay then, guess we'll be going now! We'll keep everything you said in mind!

;(After the dialogue)
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kaveh and Faruzan were super confident at the start, but it turns out they're the last ones to find a disruptor.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But between the two of them, who's going to get there first? Let's head over, quick!
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|The "Other Layla" pointed out some contradictions regarding Kaveh. There is one last Ley Line Disruptor remaining. Will Kaveh or Faruzan find it first?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach Faruzan and Kaveh)
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 faruzan 01.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' It should be around here...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 kaveh 01.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Finally found it...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 faruzan 02.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Kaveh? Are you...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 kaveh 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Madam Faruzan! And here I thought you would've finished this round by now...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Faruzan, Kaveh!
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, looks like Layla's already done.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 kaveh 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I didn't expect that you and I would find a disruptor at the same time... How are the other contestants doing?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Tighnari and Hat Guy forfeited, while Cyno and Layla are already done. You two are the only ones left.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, that's weird. Didn't you start digging really early on?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 faruzan 03.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Yes. I kept digging, but instead of finding a disruptor, I found a ruin.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 faruzan 04.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' I fell down pretty deep, and it was completely dark in there. It took me quite some time to unlock the various mechanisms and return to the surface.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's... actually really impressive...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 kaveh 04.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Finishing a week's worth of trials in such a short time... That's pretty amazing, Madam Faruzan...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 faruzan 05.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' What about you? Why are you so late?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 kaveh 05.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I encountered a lot of lost Desert Foxes along the way, and I brought them to the outskirts of the competition zone. When I came back, I was absolutely parched... and then I blacked out. Probably from the heat, you know.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 kaveh 06.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' When I woke up, it was already night. I used the last of my strength to come here.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 faruzan 06.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' A most curious reason indeed... Ah, but are you sure you're alright? It sounds like you were in an incredibly dangerous situation.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 faruzan 07.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' You said you were familiar with the desert, but the way you handle problems... It does feel rather at odds with your title as a genius.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 kaveh 07.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Ahaha, it was problematic, but that had nothing to do with me being a genius. It was my decision.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 kaveh 08.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...The way I did things wasn't optimal, but I wouldn't have been comfortable not doing it, either. My conscience would've weighed on me.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 faruzan 08.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' ...Hmph. Youths these days, each stranger than the next.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 faruzan 09.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' But back to the main issue at hand. Since we're both very certain that this is where the final Ley Line Disruptor is, let's dig it up then.
:{{Black Screen|Working together, the two unearth the final Ley Line Disruptor.}}
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 faruzan 10.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Well, this is indeed it, of that there is no doubt. But how should we count the score this time?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 kaveh 09.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Phew...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 faruzan 11.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' What is it, youngster? You seem relieved.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 kaveh 10.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Oh, nothing. I was just thinking that this round's finally over.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 kaveh 11.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...There shouldn't be any more innocent creatures getting wrapped up in danger.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 kaveh 12.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' As for the points... I guess we can draw lots again later. I can't think of anything better.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright. In that case, let's all head back to Aaru Village. Paimon thinks you'll both need some water and rest.
{{Dialogue End}}

;(Approach Alhaitham and Nilou)<!-- Alhaitham and Nilou ASTK is the same as before -->
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 10 nilou 01.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Looks like the second round is over. I wonder who was faster, Kaveh or Madam Faruzan?&nbsp;...Huh? Where's Madam Faruzan?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 10 kaveh 01.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' She went to get water &mdash; she'll be back shortly. We basically arrived at the same time, so we'd like to draw lots again.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 10 alhaitham 01.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' You get caught up in some things so easily &mdash; like drawing lots.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 10 kaveh 02.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I'm not "caught up" in anything! Don't make it sound like I take pleasure in having bad luck!
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 10 alhaitham 02.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' Really? Then, should I say that you have a curious affinity for drawing lots?
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 10 nilou 02.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Um, I'll go get the box and slips of paper for the lots. Please wait a moment...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 10 kaveh 03.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' ...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 10 faruzan 01.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' Oho, here we go again. Let's see how I fare.
:{{Black Screen|After a brief but tense lot-drawing, Kaveh emerges triumphant...}}
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 10 kaveh 04.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' I got it! Did you see that? I won!
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 10 nilou 03.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Congratulations!
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like Kaveh's luck's taken a turn for the better!
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 10 kaveh 05.ogg}} '''Kaveh:''' Finally, after all this time... *sniff*
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 10 faruzan 02.ogg}} '''Faruzan:''' It looks like you've been rewarded for your tribulations in the desert. This round's points are yours.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 10 alhaitham 03.ogg}} '''Alhaitham:''' ...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 10 nilou 04.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' And with that, our second round is done. Cyno, Layla, and Kaveh are our victorious contestants!
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 10 nilou 05.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' As for the current standings, let me see...
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 10 nilou 06.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' Cyno and Layla both have four points, putting them both in first place. The rest in descending order are Tighnari, Faruzan, Kaveh, and Hat Guy.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 10 nilou 07.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' The next round will be the final one. Please rest up before then, everyone.
:{{A|vo xyjeq002 10 nilou 08.ogg}} '''Nilou:''' I heard that some stalls at the Wisdom Gala are debuting new games, so feel free to drop by if you're interested. Otherwise, see you next round!
