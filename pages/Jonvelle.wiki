{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Jonvelle:''' Hmm, if we go with this angle, the [[Flowcurrent Bird]]s... Ah, hello there. Is something the matter?
:{{DIcon}} Still taking pictures?
::'''Jonvelle:''' Why, yes indeed! I've gotten the pictures I wanted, but since the costs of traveling from [[Fontaine]] to [[Natlan]] aren't cheap...
::'''Jonvelle:''' I might as well take a few extra shots, right?
:{{DIcon}} What do you like about Flowcurrent Birds, exactly?
::'''Jonvelle:''' Ah, many things! Some love their feet, some their feathers...
::'''Jonvelle:''' But if you ask me, their most attractive trait is the way their feathers glisten under the sunlight when they emerge from the water.
::'''Jonvelle:''' In that moment, their feathers look so eminently... fluffable!
:{{DIcon}} Nothing in particular. See you around.
::'''Jonvelle:''' See you!
