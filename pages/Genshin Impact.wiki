==Gameplay==
{{Main|Game Systems}}
Players explore the game's large fantasy world, called [[Teyvat]], with over 40 [[characters]] and various points of interest spread across the map. The game features an action combat playstyle that allows the player to swap between 4 individual [[characters]] in a party to quickly combo attacks. Single-player gameplay is the focus of the game, with [[Co-Op Mode]] available for certain activities.

Each character has two unique combat skills: an [[Elemental Skill]] and an [[Elemental Burst]]. The Elemental Skill can be used at any time except for the cooldown period immediately after use, while the Elemental Burst has an [[Energy]] Cost, requiring the user to amass sufficient Energy first.

Characters have control over one of seven natural [[elements]]: {{Anemo}}, {{Cryo}}, {{Dendro}}, {{Electro}}, {{Geo}}, {{Hydro}}, and {{Pyro}}. Combining these elements using [[Elemental Reactions]] is encouraged to quickly defeat enemies.

[[File:Tutorial System Unlocking Domains 2.png|thumb|200px]]
Players can venture inside [[Domains]], temple-like instances scattered across the map, to complete the challenges within and obtain either one-time rewards or certain materials required for character development. Once characters are properly geared, players can choose to enter the [[Spiral Abyss]], a special type of Domain consisting of different floors of combat challenges.

[[Cooking]] and [[Alchemy|crafting]] are other significant aspects of ''Genshin Impact''{{'}}s gameplay. Players gather many resources in the course of their adventure, some of which can be turned into [[Food|dishes]] via cooking, and [[potions]] and ascension materials via crafting. Dishes can regenerate characters' health, boost attack or defensive abilities, and decrease stamina consumption, while potions can increase a character's resistance against or damage for an element.

Further progression in the game unlocks the [[Housing]] system, known as the Serenitea Pot, in which players can create furnishings and place them in a realm layout, gaining access to rewards and level-up materials.

The [[Fishing]] system allows players to catch fish, which can be displayed in the Serenitea Pot, exchanged at each nation's [[Fishing Association]] for rewards, or processed into [[fish]] as a cooking ingredient.

==Story==
===Setting===
{{Main|Teyvat}}
<!--Section 1: Nations and Archons-->The story of ''Genshin Impact'' takes place in the world of [[Teyvat]] which is home to seven major nations: [[Mondstadt]], [[Liyue]], [[Inazuma]], [[Sumeru]], [[Fontaine]], [[Natlan]], and [[Snezhnaya]]. These nations are ruled over by deities known as [[Archons]], part of a group of gods called [[The Seven]]. Each Archon is associated with one of the seven [[elements]] of Teyvat, which are also reflected in their nation's landscape and culture. For example, the nation of Mondstadt is ruled over by [[Barbatos]] the Anemo Archon, and so the element of wind is an important symbol known by its people. Apart from the seven nations, there was the nation of [[Khaenri'ah]] that lived independently from the authority of gods.<!--Sal Vindagnyr (Dragonspine) is not relevant to the main storyline, therefore it is not mentioned in this part.-->

<!--After going over the nations and their archons, we now connect them to the supreme divine entity, Celestia. And then the relationship between Celestia and the people is drawn here.-->[[Celestia]] is the main heavenly body that presides over Teyvat and is in direct connection with The Seven. A floating island seen in the sky is believed to be it, allegedly the home to gods and also mortals who have ascended to godhood. Humans that are granted [[Visions]], magical gems that grant bearers the ability to command elemental power, are called "[[allogenes]]" &mdash; ones with the potential to reach godhood.

<!--After connecting Celestia to the people, there is a brief overview of the nations' human government since they play a major role in the main storyline (the Traveler's journey).-->While gods rule, the nations also have their own human governing bodies: the [[Knights of Favonius]] to Mondstadt, the [[Liyue Qixing|Qixing]] to Liyue, and the [[Inazuma Shogunate|Shogunate]] to Inazuma.<!--Do not write it as "Liyue Qixing" and "Inazuma Shogunate" because it becomes redudant with the adjective being mentioned with the nation's name. Since this section is meant to be brief overview of Teyvat's system &mdash; the relationship between the people, gods and Celestia &mdash; detailed culture lore such as mystical beings (Adepti, youkai, etc.) is not included here.-->

===Plot===
{{Main|Timeline|Archon Quests}}
A pair of "star traveler"<!--A reference to the soundtrack album "The Wind and The Star Traveler."--> twins who visit different worlds arrive in the world of Teyvat and witness the destruction of the nation of Khaenri'ah. While attempting to flee the chaos, an [[Unknown God|unnamed god]] blocks their path and separates them: she captures one and seals away the power of the other. The sealed twin (known as the "[[Traveler]]") awakens five hundred years later and meets [[Paimon]], who becomes their companion. For months, they travel together and then make their way to Mondstadt. There, they begin the search for the Traveler's [[Traveler's Sibling|missing sibling]].<!--Stopping only at Prologue, the first part of the Teyvat chapter storyline since this section is only meant to be an introduction.-->

===Characters===
{{Main|Characters}}
As Paimon and the Traveler are on their way to Mondstadt, they meet [[Amber]] of the Knights of Favonius &mdash; she had been scouting monster camps nearby. After brief questioning, she offers to escort the duo to the city after completing her tasks. Later, a dragon dubbed "[[Stormterror]]" attacks Mondstadt, and the Traveler gets caught by one of his whirlwinds. The Traveler manages to fend off the dragon and catches the attention of the Knights of Favonius. They become acquainted with other members: Acting Grand Master [[Jean]], Cavalry Captain [[Kaeya]], and resident librarian [[Lisa]]. (Amber, Kaeya, and Lisa are the three free playable characters the player would obtain in the game.) The Traveler agrees to help the Knights resolve the ongoing crisis and gains more allies: [[Venti]], a local bard who wants to help the dragon, and wine tycoon [[Diluc]].<!--For the same reason as the Plot section, this section covers only the Prologue for introduction.-->

==Development==

''Genshin Impact'' was announced in June 2019 at E3 2019. miHoYo sought to create a game that was distinct from ''Honkai Impact 3rd'' in terms of its quest and combat systems as well as its random events and mode of exploration. ''Genshin Impact'' was designed as a cross platform title, developing the game on PC and PlayStation platforms allowed the developers to raise graphical fidelity for the game, such rendering realistic shadows. It was developed using {{w|Unity (game_engine)|Unity engine}} (2017.4.30.0).

On 14 February 2022, all of miHoYo's global operations, including ''Genshin Impact'', were transferred completely to HoYoverse, the trade name of Cognosphere Pte Ltd. Almost all websites under the mihoyo.com domain were transferred to hoyoverse.com, with the exception of the Japanese and Chinese corporate hiring websites.
