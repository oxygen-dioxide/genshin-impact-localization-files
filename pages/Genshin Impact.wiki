{{Lang|'''''Genshin Impact'''''|zh=原神|zh_rm=Yuánshén}} is a free-to-play action role-playing game developed and published by [[miHoYo|miHoYo Co., Ltd]]. Outside of China, the publisher is miHoYo's subsidiary Cognosphere Pte., Ltd. d/b/a HoYoverse.

The game features a fantasy open-world environment and action based combat system using elemental magic, character switching, and a [[Wishes|gacha monetization system]] for players to obtain new characters, weapons, and other resources. The game can only be played with an internet connection and features a limited multiplayer mode allowing up to four players in a world.

==Gameplay==
{{Main|Game Systems}}
Players explore the game's large fantasy world, called [[Teyvat]], with over 97 [[characters]] and various points of interest spread across the map. The game features an action combat playstyle that allows the player to swap between 4 individual [[characters]] in a party to quickly combo attacks. Single-player gameplay is the focus of the game, with [[Co-Op Mode]] available for certain activities.

Each character has two unique combat skills: an [[Elemental Skill]] and an [[Elemental Burst]]. The Elemental Skill can be used at any time except for the cooldown period immediately after use, while the Elemental Burst has an [[Energy]] Cost, requiring the user to amass sufficient Energy first.

Characters have control over one of seven natural [[elements]]: {{Anemo}}, {{Cryo}}, {{Dendro}}, {{Electro}}, {{Geo}}, {{Hydro}}, and {{Pyro}}. Combining these elements using [[Elemental Reactions]] is encouraged to quickly defeat enemies.

[[File:Tutorial System Unlocking Domains 2.png|thumb|200px]]
Players can venture inside [[Domains]], temple-like instances scattered across the map, to complete the challenges within and obtain either one-time rewards or certain materials required for character development. Once characters are properly geared, players can choose to enter the [[Spiral Abyss]], a special type of Domain consisting of different floors of combat challenges.

[[Cooking]] and [[Alchemy|crafting]] are other significant aspects of ''Genshin Impact''{{'}}s gameplay. Players gather many resources in the course of their adventure, some of which can be turned into [[Food|dishes]] via cooking, and [[potions]] and [[Character Development Items]] via crafting. Dishes can regenerate characters' health, boost attack or defensive abilities, and decrease stamina consumption, while potions can increase a character's resistance against or damage for an element.

Further progression in the game unlocks the [[Housing]] system, known as the [[Serenitea Pot]], in which players can create furnishings and place them in a realm layout, gaining access to rewards and level-up materials.

The [[Fishing]] system allows players to catch fish, which can be displayed in the Serenitea Pot, exchanged at each nation's [[Fishing Association]] for rewards, or processed into [[fish]] as a cooking ingredient.

==Story==
===Setting===
{{Main|Teyvat}}
<!--Section 1: Nations and Archons-->The story of ''Genshin Impact'' takes place in the world of [[Teyvat]] which is home to seven major nations: [[Mondstadt]], [[Liyue]], [[Inazuma]], [[Sumeru]], [[Fontaine]], [[Natlan]], and [[Snezhnaya]]. These nations are ruled over by deities known as [[Archons]], part of a group of gods called "[[The Seven]]." Each Archon is associated with one of the seven [[elements]] of Teyvat, which are also reflected in their nation's landscape and culture. For example, the nation of Mondstadt is ruled over by [[Barbatos]] the Anemo Archon, and so the element of wind is an important symbol known by its people. Apart from the seven nations, there was the nation of [[Khaenri'ah]] that lived independently from the authority of gods.<!--Sal Vindagnyr (Dragonspine) is not relevant to the main storyline, therefore it is not mentioned in this part.-->

<!--After going over the nations and their Archons, we now connect them to the supreme divine entity, Celestia. And then the relationship between Celestia and the people is drawn here.-->[[Celestia]] is the main heavenly body that presides over Teyvat and is in direct connection with The Seven. A floating island seen in the sky is believed to be it, allegedly the home to gods and also mortals who have ascended to godhood. Humans that are granted [[Visions]], magical gems that grant bearers the ability to command elemental power, are called "[[allogenes]]" &mdash; ones with the potential to reach godhood.

<!--After connecting Celestia to the people, there is a brief overview of the nations' human government since they play a major role in the main storyline (the Traveler's journey).-->While gods rule, the nations also have their own human governing bodies: the [[Knights of Favonius]] to Mondstadt, the [[Liyue Qixing|Qixing]] to Liyue, the [[Inazuma Shogunate|Shogunate]] to Inazuma, the [[Akademiya]] to Sumeru, and the [[Palais Mermonia]] to Fontaine.<!--Do not write it as "Liyue Qixing" and "Inazuma Shogunate" because it becomes redudant with the adjective being mentioned with the nation's name. Since this section is meant to be brief overview of Teyvat's system &mdash; the relationship between the people, gods and Celestia &mdash; detailed culture lore such as mystical beings (Adepti, youkai, etc.) is not included here.-->

===Plot===
{{Main|Timeline|Archon Quests}}
A pair of "star traveler"<!--A reference to the soundtrack album "The Wind and The Star Traveler."--> twins who visit different worlds arrive in the world of Teyvat and witness [[Cataclysm|the destruction]] of the nation of Khaenri'ah. While attempting to flee the chaos, an [[Unknown God|unnamed god]] blocks their path and separates them: she captures one and seals away the power of the other. The sealed twin (known as the "[[Traveler]]") awakens five hundred years later and meets [[Paimon]], who becomes their companion. For months, they travel together and then make their way to Mondstadt. There, they begin the search for the Traveler's [[Traveler's Sibling|missing sibling]].<!--For the same reason as the Characters section, this is only the Prologue of the Teyvat chapter storyline.-->

===Characters===
{{Main|Character}}
As Paimon and the Traveler are on their way to Mondstadt, they meet [[Amber]] of the Knights of Favonius &mdash; she had been scouting monster camps nearby. After brief questioning, she offers to escort the duo to the city after completing her tasks. Later, a dragon dubbed "[[Stormterror]]" attacks Mondstadt, and the Traveler gets caught by one of his whirlwinds. The Traveler manages to fend off the dragon and catches the attention of the Knights of Favonius. They become acquainted with other members: Acting Grand Master [[Jean]], Cavalry Captain [[Kaeya]], and resident librarian [[Lisa]]. (Amber, Kaeya, and Lisa are the three free playable characters the player would obtain in the game.) The Traveler agrees to help the Knights resolve the ongoing crisis and gains more allies: [[Venti]], a local bard who wants to help the dragon, and wine tycoon [[Diluc]].<!--Stopping only at Prologue, this section covers only characters introduced in the Prologue of the Teyvat chapter storyline.-->

==Development and Release==
{{See also|Genshin Impact/Background|miHoYo#History}}
''Genshin Impact'' began its development in January 2017 with the working title "{{zh|崩坏4}}."<ref>Sina Weibo: [https://k.sina.com.cn/article_6544033401_1860e067904800fjj3.html?from=game#/ {{zh|米哈游接受东方卫视采访，或透露崩坏四制作花絮！}}]</ref><ref>Bilibili: [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Mt411p7j2 {{zh|【崩坏3】大伟哥接受电视采访miHoYo创业历程}}]</ref> At that time, producer Haoyu Cai ({{zh|蔡浩宇}}) considered creating a new project to enhance miHoYo's core research and development capabilities and present products with significant quality improvement to players in the future. The idea of creating an open-world game came out of that. During the next seven months, the team tried several prototypes. After Cai played {{w|Nintendo}}'s ''{{w| The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild}}'', the team took inspiration from the game's world exploration experience. Other inspirations came from the random events of ''{{w|Grand Theft Auto}}'', the strategy of ''{{w|Divinity: Original Sin}}'', and game developer {{w|Naughty Dog}}.<ref name="CaiLetter">Chinese HoYoverse News: [https://ys.mihoyo.com/main/news/detail/545 {{zh|原神制作组致玩家的一封信}}]</ref>

The production team initially had 150 people. They faced the difficulty of creating an open world, so it grew to 300 people by mid-2019,<ref name="CaiLetter"/> then 500 by April 2020,<ref>HoYoverse News: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/3050 To the Travelers of ''Genshin Impact'']</ref> and then 700 by February 2021.<ref>GameLook: [https://news.16p.com/880822.html {{zh|米哈游去年创收50亿，CEO蔡浩宇：想做10亿人生活的虚拟世界}}]</ref> Originally, two years were given for production but got extended by year. The research and development cost of the project began with $25 million and then exceeded $100 million, which was recouped two weeks after the game's release.<ref name="GoogleAward">Sina Weibo: [https://k.sina.cn/article_1652484947_627eeb53020013avf.html?from=news&subch=onews {{zh|刘伟做客谷歌，讲述米哈游和《原神》的故事}}].</ref><ref>PC Gamer: [https://www.pcgamer.com/grossing-over-dollar100m-genshin-impact-recoups-development-costs-in-two-weeks/ Grossing over $100m, ''Genshin Impact'' recoups development costs in two weeks]</ref> Much of the game's budget got invested in music production.

==Trivia==
* The term "Genshin" has not been used in the English localization apart from the game's name. In the Chinese, Japanese, and Korean localizations, the word was used for the term "allogenes," which refers to [[Vision]] wielders.
