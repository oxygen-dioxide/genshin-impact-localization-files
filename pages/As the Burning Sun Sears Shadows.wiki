{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the marked location)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh... Who'd have thought there'd be such a huge space underneath this volcano?
:'''Paimon:''' And it's wall-to-wall Abyss in here... Now that Paimon thinks about it, the Abyss covering the entrance probably crawled up from down here...
:{{Black Screen|O Chosen of Dragons, the power of blazing fire now rests within you...}}<!-- Golden text -->
:{{Black Screen|Go forth and vanquish the great enemy cloaked in shadow!}}
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. What's this fuzzy warm strength Paimon feels all over...?
:'''Paimon:''' Eh, that's a "later" question. Let's use it to send the Abyss packing, right here and now!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr!

;(While chasing the two runaway Oozing Cores)
;(The Oozing Cores float up to an Astral Assemblage high in the sky, encasing it in Abyssal energy)
:'''Paimon:''' What... are we supposed to do about that...
:{{Black Screen|Come, Chosen of Dragons... Let the... form your path...}}
:'''Paimon:''' Oh! There's a path. Let's go, then!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Raaawr! Roawr!
