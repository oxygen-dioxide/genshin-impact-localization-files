==Request Details==
{{Quest Description|Dwarkanath from Sumeru City needs five White Iron Chunks.}}
Help Needed:<br />
That idiot Iradj! I lend him my apple-peeling knife every time he asks, but he just keeps losing it! I keep having to look for our father to have another one forged...<br />
Getting a small one made is not hard, but this happens way too often for my liking.<br />
We're both children of the same father, so how is that fellow this careless?<br />
Could someone provide me with {{Color|buzzword|5 White Iron Chunks}}? I'm going to get our father to make 5-6 new knives. Let's see how long it'll take for that numbskull to lose them all.

:{{DIcon|Quest}} About White Iron Chunks...
::'''Dwarkanath:''' Ah, I remember. Iradj's always losing my knives so I posted the commission.
::'''Dwarkanath:''' I guess you've got those five White Iron Chunks?
::{{DIcon}} Here are the White Iron Chunks you wanted.
::;(Opens item selection menu)
::{{DIcon}} Not yet.
:::'''Dwarkanath:''' Doesn't hurt to prepare more of that. You can't have enough knives for Iradj to lose. That idiot...

;(After giving 5 White Iron Chunks)
:'''Dwarkanath:''' Thank you, I will go to dad later to make a bunch of knives. Can't wait to see Iradj's face when he gets them, haha!
