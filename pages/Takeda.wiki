==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Satou:''' Phew... It feels so good... The hot springs really are the best place to go to after the end of an adventure. The wounds sustained while out adventuring just disappear once you take a dip.
:'''Takeda:''' Is it really that effective?
:'''Satou:''' Haven't you heard from the owner that there's healing magic in here? It can help you stay healthy and grow stronger.
:'''Satou:''' I figure it must be because of this magic that I feel so relaxed and refreshed every time. I feel like I can go for one hundred more adventures!
:'''Satou:''' What, are you feeling uncomfortable?
:'''Takeda:''' It's just a bath with hot water. You're just exaggerating!
:'''Takeda:''' Honestly, it doesn't feel that much different from the hot water back home... The healing effect is purely psychological, I'm sure of it.
:'''Takeda:''' And somehow, I always feel like I'm being watched by someone here. I just don't feel comfortable...
:'''Satou:''' You're thinking too much. There are so many people coming here for a bath, who would bother staring at you? That's the real psychological effect, if you ask me.
:'''Takeda:''' Hmm... I don't think I'll come back next time...
