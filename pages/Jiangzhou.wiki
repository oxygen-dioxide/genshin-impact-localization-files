'''Jiangzhou''' is an [[NPC]] in [[Liyue Harbor]].

She was one of the planners for the [[Lantern Rite Festival]] in [[Version 1.3]], and frequently voiced her concerns over the safety and organization of the festival. She wandered around [[Feiyun Slope]] during daytime, and sat at [[Third-Round Knockout]] during nighttime.

As of [[Version 2.4]], she has transferred out of her previous position as Lantern Rite planner and can now be found by the southern dock of the Northern Wharf.

==Dialogue==
===Before Version 2.4===
====Daytime====
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Jiangzhou:''' They should put more railings around the docks. What if someone falls into the sea during the festive period?
:{{DIcon}} Hello?
::'''Jiangzhou:''' ...And there's the fire hazards. Feiyun Slope should be okay, but here at Chihu Rock it's difficult to have eyes everywhere once the place gets crowded...
::'''Jiangzhou:''' More people means more torches... I need to write a report to warn them about this...
::{{DIcon}} Hello?
::'''Jiangzhou:''' ...We also can't have too many restaurant seating spilling out into the streets, it would be a total disaster if someone were to get trampled...
::'''Jiangzhou:''' But how do we explain that to the restaurants? Ugh, there's so many things to juggle...
::{{DIcon}} Excuse me, can you hear me?
::'''Jiangzhou:''' Oh! Goodness! I almost forgot... All those cats and dogs around the harbour need somewhere to stay...
::'''Jiangzhou:''' There's a thought; [[Yong'an]] is always on duty here, and he loves cats and dogs. So does [[Manager Xiao]]. I wonder if they'd be happy to help...
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you alone...
::'''Jiangzhou:''' Hmm... What if people can't see the lanterns? How will we manage the flow of pedestrians...
{{Dialogue end}}

====Nighttime====
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Jiangzhou:''' Any pickpockets loitering around will simply disappear into the crowd, where even The [[Millelith]] will be powerless to track them down...
:{{DIcon}} Hello?
::'''Jiangzhou:''' We've got to think carefully about where we station our police officers too... Oh, are you talking to me?
::'''Jiangzhou:''' ...Hi. I'm Jiangzhou, planner for the [[Lantern Rite Festival|Lantern Rite festival]]... Well, one of them.
::{{DIcon}} One of them?
::'''Jiangzhou:''' Yes... Lantern Rite is the biggest festival of the year; everyone in Liyue Harbor comes out to celebrate it together. One planner can't handle an event of that magnitude...
::'''Jiangzhou:''' Even then, Liyue Harbor's high population and complex environment means that there are still very many issues for each planner to consider...
::'''Jiangzhou:''' And of course, the number one priority of this job is to not end up creating any new problems...
::{{DIcon}} New problems?
::'''Jiangzhou:''' Yes... Sometimes due to lack of communication, one planner ends up reversing a decision made by another planner, which wastes time and resources.
::'''Jiangzhou:''' For instance, I had to repeatedly stress the other day that we need to add a street light here... Huh? Where's the street light?
::'''Jiangzhou:''' This is no good, I'll definitely be writing a report about this!
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye, sorry for disturbing you.
::'''Jiangzhou:''' Huh? Oh... Boss, another round of bar snacks, please!
{{Dialogue end}}

===After Version 2.4===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Jiangzhou:''' So, next on the agenda... Eh? Is that all?
:{{DIcon}} How's work coming along?
::'''Jiangzhou:''' My father's been getting on in years lately, so I asked for a transfer. Now that I'm in a more leisurely department, I finally have time to spend with my family after work.
::'''Jiangzhou:''' Honestly, this sudden change has made me forget how I used to cope with so much work at all... There were so many things that really weren't my business but that I couldn't help but stick my nose into.
::'''Jiangzhou:''' Hahaha. I was so strong back then, eh?
::{{DIcon}} The "past" you?
::'''Jiangzhou:''' *sigh* Did you ever spend Lantern Rite here in Liyue? I was the previous planner of the event.
::'''Jiangzhou:''' Of course, Lantern Rite is the biggest festival of the year; everyone in Liyue Harbor comes out to celebrate it together. One planner can't handle an event of that magnitude...
::'''Jiangzhou:''' But Liyue Harbor's high population and complex environment means that there are still very many issues for each planner to consider...
::'''Jiangzhou:''' Like the lack of guardrails at the wharf, the crowding at the food stalls in Chihu Rock, the cats and dogs and running around all over the place... There's so much to consider!
::'''Jiangzhou:''' ...No, no, I'm starting to think like a planner again. That's not my job anymore &mdash; I should just get off work and go take care of my father.
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Jiangzhou:''' See you. I guess I've got to learn to fret a little less and do a little less...

==Event Dialogue==
===Lantern Rite===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Jiangzhou:''' May the flames of wisdom spread to all, and never be extinguished.
:'''Jiangzhou:''' This is the Lantern Rite Gala, where everyone gathers for Lantern Rite. As one of the head planners for the event, is there anything I can assist with?
:{{DIcon}} Please tell me about [[Lantern Rite Festival|the Lantern Rite]].
::'''Jiangzhou:''' Lantern Rite is an annual festival everyone in Liyue celebrates. It takes place on the night of the first full moon of the year.
::'''Jiangzhou:''' During the five-day festival, people pray for peace, ward off evil spirits, and watch the lanterns. We believe the fire's light keeps wisdom alive, and guides fallen heroes home along the sea.
::'''Jiangzhou:''' It's a popular tradition to make the Mingxiao Lantern as well as smaller Xiao Lanterns and then release them into the night sky.
::'''Jiangzhou:''' The lanterns light the path for, the souls of our fallen heroes as they travel by cover of night. We hope the lanterns will guide them back home so they can be reunited with us here.
::'''Jiangzhou:''' This is an extremely important festival, one which deserves meticulous preparation in every detail. It is my honor to be working as a planner.
::'''Jiangzhou:''' Please be sure to visit the Xiao Market when you have the chance, that's where the most lively festivities can be found. I hope you thoroughly enjoy yourselves and participate in all the festivities on offer.
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to know more about the Lantern Rite traditions.
::'''Jiangzhou:''' What would you like to know about? There's the [[Lantern Rite Festival#Mingxiao Lantern|Mingxiao Lantern]], [[Xiao Market]], as well as the [[Xiao Lantern]]s... I'd be happy to tell you all I know.
::{{DIcon}} What is the Mingxiao Lantern for?
:::'''Jiangzhou:''' Long, long ago, the heroes and the people joined forces to protect the land of Liyue.
:::'''Jiangzhou:''' Since peace was restored, the tradition of everyone coming together to build a giant floating lantern has been observed as a way of keeping that spirit of unity alive.
:::'''Jiangzhou:''' Everyone who can collects materials, donates what they can spare, and helps with the construction work. And on the final night of the festival, the whole city watches as the lantern is released into the air. It's the tradition most integral to the Lantern Rite.
:::'''Jiangzhou:''' Do you see the huge stone in the middle of the lantern? It's the largest Plaustrite unearthed this year.
:::'''Jiangzhou:''' How big the Mingxiao Lantern is depends on the size of the biggest Plaustrite from the preceding year. This year is special, because it has the biggest chunk of Plaustrite found in twenty years.
:::'''Jiangzhou:''' In honor of the great heroes who died to protect Liyue, the Mingxiao Lantern's design is always based on the adeptus form of one of the heroes.
:::'''Jiangzhou:''' This year's Mingxiao Lantern depicts the noble form of [[Skybracer]]. The [[Yuehai Pavilion]] chose the theme based on popular demand.
::{{DIcon}} What's the Xiao Market?
:::'''Jiangzhou:''' To put it simply, it's one of the attractions for visitors to the festival.
:::'''Jiangzhou:''' A substantial portion of the funding for the Mingxiao Lantern comes from vendors at the market.
:::'''Jiangzhou:''' So although Liyue Harbor's business people can sometimes seem a little tight-fisted, when it comes down to it they're all good people.
:::'''Jiangzhou:''' While everyone's out for the festival, you could certainly talk to them and get to know them a bit.
::{{DIcon}} What are Xiao Lanterns?
:::'''Jiangzhou:''' Good question. As you might have guessed, you can't have a Lantern Rite without lanterns!
:::'''Jiangzhou:''' Before releasing it into the air, people will write their wishes on wish sticks and insert them into the lantern. The lantern then carries their wishes off into the night sky.
:::'''Jiangzhou:''' Liyue may be well known for its mining industry, but fortunately, being surrounded by rocks hasn't turned people's hearts to stone...
:::'''Jiangzhou:''' Maybe it's because we also live off the sea. That romantic idea of the gentle sea breeze has found its way into our hearts... Haha.
:::'''Jiangzhou:''' Would you care to try making your own Xiao Lantern? After all, it's not every day you get to be in Liyue during the Lantern Rite.
:{{DIcon}} Not right now, thanks.
::'''Jiangzhou:''' Okay. Well, enjoy your time here.
