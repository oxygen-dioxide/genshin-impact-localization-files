:'''Fake Playwright:''' Hi, esteemed audience members! I'm Fake Playwright, one of the staff working on Three-Day Reverie. Can I help you with anything?
:{{DIcon}} Why are you known as "Fake Playwright"?
::'''Fake Playwright:''' That's a good question! It seems I have some explaining to do.
::'''Fake Playwright:''' Long story short, if I can't write anything appropriate soon, I'll be fired!
::'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Is it that bad? You make it sound like... Water Droplets have strict rules too!
::{{DIcon}} Appropriate? What do you mean?
::{{DIcon}} Are you referring to impactful dialogue?
::'''Fake Playwright:''' No, not at all. Dialogue is the easiest part!
::'''Fake Playwright:''' Writing beautiful lines, fooling the audience into thinking the lines are something profound...
::'''Fake Playwright:''' That's something any Hydro Eidolon with just a few months of intensive training... No, even a Specter could do that!
::'''Fake Playwright:''' But to transform a splendid section of the play into the scene before your eyes, now that cannot be done without a careful division of labor and cooperation. That is the essence of being "appropriate"!
::{{DIcon}} Clear as mud.
::{{DIcon}} How abstract.
::'''Paimon:''' Could you explain it in a way that Paimon can understand?
::'''Fake Playwright:''' No surprise there. It takes a certain amount of creative experience to resonate with this topic.
::'''Fake Playwright:''' Then I'll slow down enough to give you time to catch up. A good playwright must understand the troupe's limits and resources, and write the script with those in mind.
::'''Fake Playwright:''' Even if it's the simplest of scenes, you must carefully determine the actors and props required.
::'''Fake Playwright:''' But as you can see, we plain don't have enough actors and our prop selection is relatively limited as well.
::'''Fake Playwright:''' So, you certainly can't go overboard when writing the script because once it's in the show, the audience may feel a deep disconnect between what is described and what is shown.
::'''Fake Playwright:''' My failure to take that into consideration resulted in me writing a few unrealistic and entirely unusable scripts, and it even ended up delaying the schedule of the entire troupe...
::{{DIcon}} Ouch...
::{{DIcon}} That's terrible...
::'''Paimon:''' If worse comes to worst, then... Paimon will just draw figures on wooden boards and use them as actors! Paimon can draw some props on wood too... y'know, signal the audience!
::'''Paimon:''' Hmm, we can install a few wheels on the bottom and move them around to display character movement or interact with props.
::'''Paimon:''' If we slam them together and throw in some exaggerated sound effects, we can even recreate fight scenes!
::'''Paimon:''' It'll be just like when the sea monster's minions showed up in the Black Nacre play!
::{{DIcon}} Economical showmanship!
::{{DIcon}} Even Paimon can do it!
::'''Fake Playwright:''' No! Absolutely not! According to Mr. Zosimos's book, that's on the level of "terribly unforgivable" and should be used for insignificant supporting characters... at best!
::'''Fake Playwright:''' Instead of leaving a few stand-ins for actors which just stand there chatting loudly all day, it's better to just leave them out completely!
::'''Fake Playwright:''' Doing that... it only interferes with the audience's imagination, yet fails to fully convey the scene...
::'''Fake Playwright:''' It's safer to avoid limiting the audience's imagination, and use words alone to lead them through it!
::'''Fake Playwright:''' ...
::'''Fake Playwright:''' (Fake Playwright seems to be seriously gesturing and acting out something, but the speaker remains silent.)
::'''Fake Playwright:''' Ugh! I just don't have the words yet, so many lines haven't been recorded, I can't say them...
::'''Paimon:''' Fake Playwright seems to be very principled... As soon as we brought up this subject, it just can't stop talking.
::{{DIcon}} High standards for oneself are a good thing.
::{{DIcon}} It's better than not seeking to improve.
::'''Paimon:''' Anyway, let's stop for now. Otherwise, this might go on forever...
::'''Fake Playwright:''' But perhaps it may not be that difficult for the two of you.
::'''Paimon:''' That's true! If you think about it, you shouldn't be afraid of creating something just because someone might be harsh on it.
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe! Looks like {{Traveler}} and Paimon are talented at this too... Or Paimon should say that we're made of the right stuff, though we haven't really started!
::'''Paimon:''' Anyway, you talking about this made Paimon curious about something. Did Zosimos actually read that book?
:{{DIcon}} O Cultured Playwright, can we have a word?
::'''Fake Playwright:''' I told you, I'm just one of the staff. It's like you're mocking me when you address me like that...
::'''Paimon:''' Hey! Aren't you being a little too sensitive? That's not what {{Traveler}} meant! {{MC|m=He|f=She}} is always sincere!
::'''Fake Playwright:''' Forgive me, being sensitive is something that comes naturally to us artistically gifted playwrights...
::'''Fake Playwright:''' According to Mr. Zosimos, sometimes people in the industry have been misunderstood or even ruthlessly attacked because they were careless with their wording...
::'''Fake Playwright:''' While such a demanding audience may not appear in the Veluriyam Mirage...
::'''Fake Playwright:''' Mr. Zosimos also said that whenever we create something, we must be prepared to receive the attention of a larger audience and never leave it up to luck!
::'''Fake Playwright:''' Hmm, we may have gone off topic a bit. Though those are more my own personal expectations, you could also consider them suggestions.
::'''Paimon:''' Those expectations are way too strict! Are you going to quibble over every single little word?
::'''Paimon:''' So if we create a show based on our own experiences, like the story of the Anemo Archon and Dvalin...
::'''Paimon:''' Would people come forward just to fuss over things like... Hmm, something like "How disrespectful! How dare you make the Anemo Archon seem so carefree! That's far too presumptuous!"
::{{DIcon}} Just laugh it off.
::{{DIcon}} Creative art should be fun, not overly cautious.
::'''Fake Playwright:''' What? You've ascended to the plane of "transcendence" before you've written a single script!?
::'''Paimon:''' ?
::{{DIcon}} ?
::'''Fake Playwright:''' One of Mr. Zosimos's books mentioned such a concept&mdash;
::'''Fake Playwright:''' "Even if we exercise the utmost care while writing a script, we are bound to encounter many who we would consider are criticizing our work excessively."
::'''Fake Playwright:''' "If you fear such criticism and dare not fully exercise your creative freedom, then you are putting the cart before the horse..."
::'''Fake Playwright:''' In short, listen to what is right and ignore the harsh criticism.
::'''Fake Playwright:''' Such transcendence is of great benefit to writing scripts. It's a realm that all playwrights dream of... It is easy to say such things, but actually doing so is a completely different story.
::'''Fake Playwright:''' But perhaps it may not be that difficult for the two of you.
::'''Paimon:''' That's true! If you think about it, you shouldn't be afraid of creating something just because someone might be harsh on it.
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe! Looks like {{Traveler}} and Paimon are talented at this too... Or Paimon should say that we're made of the right stuff, though we haven't really started!
::'''Paimon:''' Anyway, you talking about this made Paimon curious about something. Did Zosimos actually read that book?
:{{DIcon}} We're here to provide material for you...
::'''Paimon:''' Daiya's voice said that we should talk to you and tell interesting stories that will help with your script writing!
::'''Fake Playwright:''' Oh... So Chief Director heard about your adventures from Idyia. Yes, your assistance is necessary...
::'''Fake Playwright:''' But as you can see, the process of writing a script is very long. I'm worried that your stories will be so rich and detailed that I will fail to remember them after a time.
::'''Fake Playwright:''' Please use the device in front of me to make a recording. That way I can review it whenever I want!
::'''Paimon:''' We're experts at that! {{Traveler}}, Paimon will allow you to decide what kind of material we should provide to Daiya's Three-Day Reverie!
::{{Black Screen|After a short discussion with Paimon, you select some of the most outlandish things you've encountered in your journey and the stories from several novels before recording them in a concise and easy-to-understand tone for Fake Playwright...}}
::'''Fake Playwright:''' Wow! That's such a long recording! This is more material than I ever expected!
::'''Fake Playwright:''' I shall specially write a line to extol the great deed you have performed here today in sharing your stories!
::'''Paimon:''' Hehe, Paimon wonders what kind of show this super professional Water Droplet will turn our stories into!
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon can't wait!
:{{DIcon}} Don't mention it. We won't take more of your time.
::'''Paimon:''' Right! We're only here to observe! We'll leave you to it then!
::'''Fake Playwright:''' You're so polite and careful with your words! I hope you have a pleasant visit!
