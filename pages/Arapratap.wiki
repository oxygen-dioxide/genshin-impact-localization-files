'''Arapratap''' is an open-world [[NPC]] simultaneously located in three different locations [[Sumeru]]. It is part of the [[Aranara]]. Unlike others, Arapratap does not disappear and relocate to [[Vanarana (Subarea)]] after completing its challenge. However, it will despawn if a player logs out and logs back in.

;(Talk to Arapratap)
:'''Arapratap:''' It's Nara! Arapratap wants to play a game with you. Will you play with Arapratap, good Nara?

::'''Arapratap:''' Are you ready, Nara?
::{{DIcon}} Let's do this.
:{{DIcon}} Next time for sure.
::'''Arapratap:''' Arapratap can wait.

;(If the player breaks any of the crates)

;(Talk to Arapratap after the countdown)
:'''Arapratap:''' Nara Friend, Arapratap is thinking of a {{color|buzzword|wooden box, but not the big kind}}! The small kind. How many did Nara see?
:{{DIcon}} One.
::'''Arapratap:''' Stupid Nara got it wrong.
::'''Arapratap:''' Arapratap's got many "chances" to give to Nara. Come back if you're up to the challenge!

::'''Arapratap:''' Are you ready, good Nara?
::{{DIcon}} Let's do this.
