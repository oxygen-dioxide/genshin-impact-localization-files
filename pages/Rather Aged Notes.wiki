'''Rather Aged Notes''' are a set of interactable notes in the [[Tatarasuna]] area of [[Kannazuka]] around the [[Mikage Furnace]].

The notes were written during the events of the [[Tatarasuna Mystery]] 400 years ago. They revolve around the events leading up to, and the aftermath of, the creation of the [[Katsuragikiri Nagamasa]] weapon and involve Inspector [[Mikoshi Nagamasa]],<ref name="KatNag">{{Ref/Weapon|Katsuragikiri Nagamasa}}</ref> his yoriki [[Katsuragi]], Tatarasuna's Vice Armory Officer [[Miyazaki]], and Tatarasuna workers [[Kinjiro]] and [[Nozomu]]. They were joined by [[Scaramouche]], at the time a nameless, wandering eccentric.<ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Husk of Opulent Dreams}}</ref>

The notes are referenced in the {{Quest|The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call}}, which reveals the truth behind the Tatarasuna Mystery. After completing the quest, the notes' contents are also permanently changed.

==Trivia==
*Through process of elimination based on the names mentioned in the notes, Notes #3 and #7 were written by Kinjiro, while Note #6 was written by Miyazaki. The authors of the remaining notes currently cannot be determined.
*Despite also mentioning an "Inspector" and "Armory Officer," the [[Mikage Furnace#Records|Records]] inside a building in the Mikage Furnace are unrelated to the Rather Aged Notes. They were more likely written by a present-day worker who hastily hid the keys to the Arsenal during the evacuation. Notably, the Records do not mention being difficult to read due to age, only that rough handling by the Fatui had torn the paper. This is further confirmed in [[Aqaba]]'s essay during ''The Night-Bird Falls at the Curtain's Call''.
