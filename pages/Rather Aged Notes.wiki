'''Rather Aged Notes''' are a set of interactable notes in the [[Tatarasuna]] area of [[Kannazuka]] around the [[Mikage Furnace]].

The notes recount a certain incident regarding Inspector [[Mikoshi Nagamasa]], the [[Katsuragikiri Nagamasa]] weapon,<ref name="KatNag">{{Ref/Weapon|Katsuragikiri Nagamasa}}</ref> and Nagamasa's group, consisting of Nagamasa, [[Katsuragi]], Vice Armory Officer [[Miyazaki]], [[Kinjiro]], and [[Nozomu]]. They were joined by [[Scaramouche]], at the time a nameless, wandering eccentric.<ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Husk of Opulent Dreams}}</ref>

==Trivia==
*Through process of elimination based on the names mentioned in the notes, Notes #3 and #7 were written by Kinjiro, while Note #6 was written by Miyazaki. The authors of the remaining notes currently cannot be determined.
*Despite also mentioning an "Inspector" and "Armory Officer," the [[Mikage Furnace#Records|Records]] inside a building in the Mikage Furnace are unlikely to be related to the Rather Aged Notes. It was more likely written by a present-day worker who hastily hid the keys to the Arsenal during the evacuation. Notably, the Records do not mention being difficult to read due to age, only that rough handling by the Fatui had torn the paper. This is further confirmed in [[Aqaba]]’s essay during [[Inversion of Genesis]].
*These notes are transcribed in [[Aqaba]]’s essay, which is handed in to the Traveler during [[Inversion of Genesis]].
