'''Hanshirou''' {{Lang|ja=半四郎}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in [[Chapter II]], Act I: [[The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia]].

==Profile==
<!--detailed story/lore information goes here-->
He received a [[Vision]], but then [[Okawara Goemon]] approached him to confiscate it as part of the [[Vision Hunt Decree]]. However, it turned out that Hanshirou did not give away his real vision, but a fake one that he received from [[Yoimiya]] who in turn got it from [[Master Masakatsu]].
