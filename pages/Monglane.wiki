:'''Monglane:''' Hello.
:{{DIcon}} I have a few questions...
::'''Monglane:''' Add your questions, whatever they are, to this form. Once we've categorized them, we'll answer them all together at a later date.
::{{DIcon}} Can't you just answer them now?
:::'''Monglane:''' I can't determine whether or not your question is one which I can answer. Therefore I am unable to give you an answer to that question.
:::'''Monglane:''' But if you wish, you can add the question to the form.
::{{DIcon}} But I don't want to fill in the form.
:::'''Monglane:''' Me neither.
:::'''Monglane:''' But here, forms are how we create order. Forms are the only thing that can bring you any consolation.
:::'''Monglane:''' If you are still unwilling to fill in the form, feel free to take a look around.
:::'''Monglane:''' The rules aren't just on paper. They're in our every move and action. You should be able to find the answers you seek if you pay close attention and observe.
:::{{DIcon}} Okay. Sorry to bother you.
:::'''Monglane:''' Mm-hmm.
:{{DIcon}} Sorry to bother you.
::'''Monglane:''' Mm-hmm.
