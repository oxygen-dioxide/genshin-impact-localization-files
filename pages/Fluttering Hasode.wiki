{{Description|"Sakura red dyes the brocade, the fragrance suffuses the sleeves, the orioles intoxicated."}}
'''Fluttering Hasode''' is [[Chiori]]'s [[Elemental Skill]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* {{Talent Note|particles|Tamoto DMG|1.2}}
* {{Talent Note|no snapshot|Tamoto DMG|character=Chiori}}
* The distance from the Geo Construct to spawn the extra Tamoto is based on the first Tamoto's location, not the active character.
* Having an ice pillar created by a [[Cryo Samachurl]] nearby will also trigger the extra Tamoto, despite it not being a Geo Construct. 
* This skill enters [[cooldown]] after the Upward Sweep. Being interrupted prior to that will not put this skill on cooldown.
* Chiori will move upward immediately after holding this skill, regardless of where her skill was aimed. This allows her to perform a [[Plunging Attack]] under most circumstances. However, unlike characters who can ignore altitude requirements for performing Plunging Attacks, neither Chiori nor a character she switches to can perform a Plunging Attack if there is an obstacle that blocks Chiori's upward movement.
* "Tamoto" has three possible expressions. The closed-eye expression has a '''70%''' chance of appearing, while the other two each have a '''15%''' chance.<gallery>

* {{Talent Note|ascension|1|Tailor-Made|grants additional effects based on whether an Elemental Skill or Normal Attack is pressed for a short duration after the upward sweep.}}
