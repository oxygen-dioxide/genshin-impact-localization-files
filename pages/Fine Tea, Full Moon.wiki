|description     = A tea pastry containing egg yolk.
|desc_suspicious = As you pick it up, layers flake away like loose earth in a landslide. The first bite is sticky, sweet, cloying... And uh-oh, something gets stuck in your throat. Get some water to wash it down, then think about what to do with the rest.
|desc_basic      = The salted yolk is first steamed, then stuffed and wrapped in tea powder-infused dough. It's then kneaded into the shape of a full moon before being baked. This results in a crispy, flaky exterior with a salty and sweet interior, the different layers forming a delicious and addictive delicacy.
|desc_delicious  = The loose and delicate texture of the grainy egg yolk mingles with a faint fragrance of tea. One small mouthful brings earthy happiness enough to make you swoon. You could pop several in your mouth at once, and woe betide any who should seek to steal a single crumb from the corner of your lips.
