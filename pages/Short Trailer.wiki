|No matter how splendid the blooming flowers are, there will always come a day when they must face the severe test of winter.<br />Even ice and snow must give way, but the evergreen trees are still standing.<br />When the clouds part and snow melts, that's how one knows that spring has come.

|January 13, 2023
|Long ago, there were people in Liyue Harbor who caught a glimpse of a shadow.<br />This solitary shadow was fleeting, and would quickly conceal himself amongst the lanterns.<br />All the hardships in the world have a name. This one is a millennium of doom that cannot be quelled nor eradicated.<br />Even the occasional respite is but ephemeral, and cannot give rise to hope.
