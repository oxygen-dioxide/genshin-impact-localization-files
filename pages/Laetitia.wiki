:'''Laetitia:''' Oh, it's you two. Are you here to have a look at the clothes, too?
:{{DIcon}} About [[Chiori]]...
::'''Laetitia:''' It seems Ms. Chiori isn't here today, either.
::'''Laetitia:''' I rarely saw her when I came here before as well. [[Eloffe]] tells me that she enjoys making her clothes alone in peace.
::'''Laetitia:''' ...I'm not sure why, but trouble is never far behind whenever Ms. Chiori shows up at the store.
:{{DIcon}} How'd the wedding go?
::'''Laetitia:''' Thanks for your concern. We encountered some difficulties at home, but we made it through the fire, and the wedding proceeded as planned. Everyone said it was the most beautiful dress they'd ever seen.
::'''Laetitia:''' Now that I think about it, Ms. Chiori really did help me a whole lot. She often came over to my place with sample dresses for me to try on.
::'''Laetitia:''' She claimed that it was all just to better customize my wedding dress, but she would bring me lots of things every time she came over. She'd ask me how I was doing while sewing and trimming my clothes with needle and thread...
::'''Laetitia:''' Hmm... I'll have to prepare quite a grand thank-you gift for her in return.
:{{DIcon}} About [[Chioriya Boutique]]...
::'''Laetitia:''' I'll never tire of looking at Chioriya Boutique's clothes, and they release new styles every so often.
::'''Laetitia:''' If I didn't have to manage business at home, I'd have wanted to work here. It must be lovely to be surrounded by such beautiful clothes every day.
::'''Laetitia:''' Ah, I suppose Ms. Chiori's desire to pursue her dreams must have infected me as well...
::'''Laetitia:''' Should I... try to search for my next dream too?
:{{DIcon}} I'll leave you in peace.
::'''Laetitia:''' It's fine. If there's anything you'd like to chat about, just feel free.
