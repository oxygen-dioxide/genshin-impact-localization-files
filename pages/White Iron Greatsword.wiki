==Gameplay Notes==
*The passive effect only restores HP when the character wielding this claymore is the active character.

==Description==
A lightweight greatsword made of white iron with a silver sheen. When swung rapidly, the flashes of light can blind the enemy. However, this sword is not usually used as a weapon.<br>
According to the way of warriors of old, when a comrade falls in battle, polished weapons will line the ground where they fell. Though such rituals as these are no longer in fashion, some few still remember what they mean...
