The other day, I was at [[Treasures Street]] queuing to buy some snacks, and the two people in front of me were chatting about the novel they had recently read. I started listening attentively and before I knew it, I somehow listened to the entire plot...

I also heard that there are some old books at the [[House of Daena]] that have been doodled on, but most of them were cute and encouraging artworks. I thought that was pretty interesting and wanted to give it a try myself.

There are a few old books in my study that I don't read anymore. When I get some free time, I'm going to draw on them and then bring them to the House of Daena.

Drawing and drinking coffee are both great ways to relax and unwind. You should give it a try too!
