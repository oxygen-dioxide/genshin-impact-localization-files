==Profile==
Guy is a guard from the [[Knights of Favonius]].  He is the son of a farmer named [[Tunner]] who works for the Dawn Winery farm. As a child, he dreamed of becoming a knight. So his father spent a lot of money for his training to provide a better future for him.<ref name="Tunner's dialogue">{{Ref/NPC|Tunner}}</ref> He started his knights training at the age of eight, learned swordsmanship two years later and became a squire when he was sixteen.<ref name="Tunner's dialogue" /><ref>{{Ref/NPC|Guy}}</ref>

===Personality===
Guy is a very caring and filial son that wants his sickly father to be proud of him. On his lunch breaks, he asks [[Jilliana]] to make a cough medicine for his father.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Things a Father Can Do}}</ref> However, he has also misconstrued Tunner's high expectations of him as the family's breadwinner; as a result, Guy fabricates tales of heroic exploits in his letters to his father when he actually serves as a guard for a secluded city gate, believing Tunner would be disappointed in him if he learned that Guy was relegated to such a role. In reality, his father is simply proud of him for getting into the Knights of Favonius.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Guy in the Background}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Guy wears one of the standard uniforms of the Knights of Favonius. The uniform consists of a black long-sleeve shirt, horse riding pants, gloves, and brown leather shoulder pads with brass-accented white plate armor worn on top. His vambraces however are black. Wing motifs decorate various parts of the armor along with the Knights of Favonius crest on the breastplate. A sheathed sword hangs from his belt on his left side and a blowing horn hangs from the back of his hip.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Guy:''' Another meaningless day...
:'''Guy:''' Oh! Do you need a hand with anything? B&mdash;But never mind if you don't though!
:{{DIcon}} What are you doing?
::'''Guy:''' I'd like to know as well... What are you doing here, Guy?
::'''Guy:''' Alright, I'm guarding the side gate on Mondstadt. As everyone knows, it's a gate that no one uses.
::'''Guy:''' Mock me all you want. I know it's a pointless job.
:{{DIcon}} You seem upset.
::'''Guy:''' Of course I'm upset.
::'''Guy:''' I've started training at the age of 8, learned swordsmanship at the age of 10, and became a squire at 16...
::'''Guy:''' I'm the pride of my family, yet I'm tasked with such a job...
::'''Guy:''' As a member of the Knights of Favonius, guarding the side gate is like [[Cat's Tail]] without [[Diona]]. There's no soul in it!
::'''Guy:''' ...Anyway, have you bumped into any trouble? Any kind at all &mdash; let me see if I can help! I am a Knight of Favonius after all!
::'''Guy:''' Oh... Okay then...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Guy:''' Please do come to me when you need help...
::'''Guy:''' Well, forget it. You won't remember me anyway...
