==Profile==
Guy is a guard from the [[Knights of Favonius]].  He is the son of a farmer named [[Tunner]] who works for the Dawn Winery farm. As a child, he dreamed of becoming a knight. So his father spent a lot of money for his training to provide a better future for him.<ref name="Tunner's dialogue">{{Ref/NPC|Tunner}}</ref> He started his knights training at the age of eight, learned swordsmanship two years later and became a squire when he was sixteen.<ref name="Tunner's dialogue" /><ref>{{Ref/NPC|Guy}}</ref>

===Personality===
Guy is a very caring and filial son that wants his sickly father to be proud of him. On his lunch breaks, he asks [[Jilliana]] to make a cough medicine for his father.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Things a Father Can Do}}</ref> However, he has also misconstrued Tunner's high expectations of him as the family's breadwinner; as a result, Guy fabricates tales of heroic exploits in his letters to his father when he actually serves as a guard for a secluded city gate, believing Tunner would be disappointed in him if he learned that Guy was relegated to such a role. In reality, his father is simply proud of him for getting into the Knights of Favonius.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Guy in the Background}}</ref>

===Appearance===
Guy wears one of the standard uniforms of the Knights of Favonius. The uniform consists of a black long-sleeve shirt, horse riding pants, gloves, and brown leather shoulder pads with brass-accented white plate armor worn on top. His vambraces however are black. Wing motifs decorate various parts of the armor along with the Knights of Favonius crest on the breastplate. A sheathed sword hangs from his belt on his left side and a blowing horn hangs from the back of his hip.
