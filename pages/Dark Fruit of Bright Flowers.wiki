{{Description|A flower carved from grey stone covered with gold foil. Legends say that during a war, it was used to differentiate friend from foe.}}
'''Dark Fruit of Bright Flowers''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Unfinished Reverie]].

==Description==
It was the age when the banners of the [[Natlan Tribes|tribes]] had been coated in dust, gradually losing their color.<br>
And before the throne stands a [[Och-Kan|half-man]] holding a cracked ring, playing with preeminence.<br>
Strict orders were given that none should ever again give ear to the instructions left by the [[Yohualtecuhtin, Lord of the Night|deep messengers of twilight]], the [[Wayob|distant ancestors]], and the [[Xbalanque|first ascended]]—<br>
To hear them not from the mud-caked roots of trees, the flickering flames of bonfires, or the reflections found in the deep woods.

And so, the ancient gloom, the moment that engulfs a million darknesses, came at last,<br>
Just as the stench of iron lingers even as bloodstains upon the ancient scrolls fade.<br>
And so, when the [[Abyss|pitch-black darkness]] thick enough to touch seized the [[Old Core of Chu'ulel|depths]],<br>
The [[Scarlet-Eyed Youth|red-eyed youth]], through countless calamities, returned from the [[Night Kingdom|kingdom where water flowed as rays of light]] to the hilly heights of the [[Ochkanatlan|ineffable city]].

As he stepped into the [[Legendary Tonatiuh|floating garden]], the raspy warning of [[Maghan's Master|the blind, stooped old woman]] still clutched at his ear:<br>
"As radiant flowers still blossom amongst the clinging vines of distant marsh,<br>
Go seek, for here is the land of death, piled high with the skulls of [[Dragon|behemoths]]—<br>
Go seek those the truly righteous, who are still willing to stand in the cold, cruel night, to throw themselves onto the fire,<br>
And remember — never betray their passion, their hatred, their greed, and their ambition!<br>
Do not break faith with the eyes of those still willing to gaze upon the burning flames."

The first to arrive was a [[Sakkuk|young girl]], holding a dulled feather accessory. She sought out information for the youth like a quetzal, flitting between the tall tents.<br>
The second were the hero twins, [[Atawallpa|the elder]] whose lips and teeth were sharper than any blade, and [[Waskar|the younger]] whose back bore the brunt of the tyrant's lash.<br>
Upon hearing of how the scarlet-eyed youth had saved the [[Saurian]]s, the [[Yupanqui|taciturn warrior]] too was willing to contribute his strength.

"But we need someone who understands the layout of this city better than anyone,<br>
Who can point out the paths in passages open and secret, and manipulate mechanisms as one might do to toys in the palm of their hand."<br>
After the scarlet-eyed youth had spoken thus, the usually reticent and reserved hero,<br>
That powerful hero who hoped [[Saurian|Saurians]] and humans would live together in peace, remembered the rumor and spoke the name of [[Manqu (Historical)|a craftsman]].
