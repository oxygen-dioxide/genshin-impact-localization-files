{{Lang|'''Mikoshi Nagamasa'''|ja=御輿長正|ja_rm=Mikoshi Nagamasa}} was one of [[The Yougou Three]] in [[Inazuma]] who lived around the time of the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago.

In his youth, he was adopted into the [[Mikoshi Clan]] by [[Mikoshi Chiyo]] and lived with her biological son [[Iwakura Doukei]] (Mikoshi Doukei). Nagamasa took great pride in his adoptive family, and after Chiyo went mad from [[abyss]]al corruption and turned her blade on [[Ei]], he joined the [[Inazuma Shogunate]] to restore his family's honor.

After becoming an Inspector, Nagamasa took up bladesmithing at [[Tatarasuna]]. There, he forged a nagamaki that would come to be known as the [[Katsuragikiri Nagamasa]] (Katsuragi-Slashing Nagamasa) after he slew his yoriki, [[Katsuragi]], with it.

==Profile==
{{Quote|...Nagamasa is harsh, but also knows right from wrong. But even so, he is not amenable to reason. His name indicates one obsessed with purity...|[[Miyazaki]]'s remarks about Nagamasa following Katsuragi and [[Nozomu]]'s deaths<ref name="RAN">Interactible: [[Rather Aged Notes]]</ref>}}
===Personality===
Nagamasa is said to have been obsessed with justice, especially after Chiyo's betrayal stained the Mikoshi Clan's reputation and led Nagamasa to work diligently to restore their honor. His obsession with restoring his clan's honor was such that he would not tolerate any sort of misconduct for his subordinates, as seen when he killed Katsuragi despite his good intentions.<ref name="KatNag">{{Ref/Weapon|Katsuragikiri Nagamasa}}</ref>

==Story==
===Early life===
At some point in Nagamasa's early life, he was fostered by the [[oni]] maiden Chiyo and grew up alongside her biological son, Doukei.<ref name="KatNag" /> He appears to have lived in or around the [[Mt. Yougou]] area, later going to learn under the [[Yougou Tengu]] and becoming one of the Yougou Three alongside [[Asase Hibiki]] and [[Kamuna Harunosuke]].<ref name="The Narukami Trail">{{Ref/Quest|The Narukami Trail|quote='''Inagi Hotomi:''' About four to five hundred years, it was said that "The Yougou Three" Asase Hibiki, Kamuna Harunosuke, and Mikoshi Nagamasa once went to Mt. Yougou to learn under the Yougou Tengu. [...]<br />'''Inagi Hotomi:''' Mikoshi Nagamasa returned to Inazuma City to serve the Shogunate.}}</ref>

After Chiyo was corrupted by the abyss and betrayed Ei during the fight against the dark forces of the [[cataclysm]], Doukei secluded himself in [[Konda Village]] out of shame while Nagamasa left to join the Shogunate and restore the Mikoshi name.<ref name="The Narukami Trail" /><ref>{{Ref/ArtiSet|Shimenawa's Reminiscence}}</ref>

===As an Inspector===
After becoming an inspector, Nagamasa went to [[Tatarasuna]] with his yoriki [[Katsuragi]]. There, he developed an interest in weaponsmithing, a pursuit that the rest of his group &mdash; consisting of Armory Officer [[Miyazaki]], [[Nozomu]], and [[Kinjiro]] &mdash; believed had a beneficial effect on his temperament. With Katsuragi and Miyazaki's help, Nagamasa forged a {{w|nagamaki}} he named {{Lang|Daitatara Nagamasa|ja=大たたら長正|ja_rm=Great Tatara Nagamasa}}.<ref name="KatNag" /> Nozomu was so moved upon seeing the blade that he made a painting of it, while Katsuragi and a "wandering eccentric" &mdash; the entity later known as [[Scaramouche]]<ref name="HuskDreams">{{Ref/ArtiSet|Husk of Opulent Dreams}}</ref> &mdash; performed a sword dance together.<ref name="RAN" />

Later, a certain incident occurred in Tatarasuna. For some reason, the group sought Scaramouche but failed to find him. Nagamasa discovered that Katsuragi was involved in some sort of "misconduct," which other members believed Katsuragi had done out of the goodness of his heart. However, Nagamasa would have none of it. He fatally slashed Katsuragi, then threw Daitatara Nagamasa into the furnace after issuing an order to the rest of the group. Nozomu disagreed with the order and reached into the furnace to retrieve the melted blade, later dying from his injuries. Kinjiro took the remains of the blade as well as Nozomu's painting and hid them in [[the Arsenal]].<ref name="RAN" /> From then on, both Nagamasa and his blade became known as {{Lang|Katsuragikiri Nagamasa|ja=桂木斬長正|ja_tl=Katsuragi-Slashing Nagamasa}}.<ref name="KatNag" />

Around the time of the incident, he and Scaramouche were at odds. In a standdown between the two, Nagamasa asked Scaramouche "not [to] hold this against [him]."<ref name="HuskDreams" /> What Nagamasa did and what happened to him afterwards are unknown.

To get his vengeance against "the bladesmith," Scaramouche masterminded the fall of the [[Raiden Gokaden]]. After the Kyoushin, Doume, and Senju Arts were eradicated, Scaramouche decided his quest had grown boring and abandoned it, leaving the Isshin a dying art while the [[Amenoma Art]] escaped unscathed.<ref name="HuskDreams" />

==Trivia==
*The [[Earth Kitsune Statue]] above the [[Perpetual Mechanical Array]] recounts memories of a conversation between Nagamasa and Doukei; "Michihira" is an alternate reading for Doukei's Japanese name, {{Lang|mini=1|ja=道啓}}.
