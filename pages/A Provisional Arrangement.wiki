{{Quest Description|Something's wrong with the stairway at Wangshu Inn, and it's been closed for repairs. Getting up to the top is now a problem...}}
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Talk to [[Zhen Qiang]])
:'''Zhen Qiang:''' That should just about do it. What hard work.
:{{DIcon}} What's up with those stairs over there?
:'''Zhen Qiang:''' The stairs? Oh, you want to go up to the inn?
:'''Zhen Qiang:''' You've come at a bad time, there's two big holes on the way up. To prevent people from missing their step, the boss has had the whole stairway closed.
:'''Zhen Qiang:''' The preparations for repairs have been made, but the stairs won't be fit for walking for a while.
:'''Zhen Qiang:''' Don't worry. You can't use the stairs, but the elevator over there is just fine.
:'''Zhen Qiang:''' It can move cargo, so carrying people isn't a problem. If you're in a rush, how about using that instead?
:'''Zhen Qiang:''' Oh yeah, and while you're at it, help me give this to the boss. It's a gift from a guest.
:{{DIcon}} Got it.
::'''Zhen Qiang:''' Well, off you go, then. Remember to watch your footing. This inn is pretty high up, so falling off halfway is no joke!
:{{DIcon}} Why aren't you going up yourself!?
::'''Zhen Qiang:''' I need to stay down here to receive goods. There's a lot of goods to receive, and I daren't make any mistakes.
::'''Zhen Qiang:''' Alright, off you get. Watch your footing, now. This inn is pretty high up, and falling off halfway is no joke!
;(Talk to Zhen Qiang again)
:'''Zhen Qiang:''' Why hasn't the cargo arrived yet...
----
;(Talk to [[Huai'an]])
:'''Huai'an:''' We've got to repair those stairs quickly...
:{{DIcon}} You the innkeeper?
:'''Huai'an:''' I am. What can I do for you?
:'''Paimon:''' Some guy downstairs asked us to give this package to you.
:'''Huai'an:''' Oh, this must be a package that a guest sent to me. Why didn't Zhen Qiang bring it up himself?
:'''Huai'an:''' Still has goods to pick up, did he? Ha, I bet he was just too lazy to go up and down the elevator...
:'''Huai'an:''' I'm really sorry. You're a guest of ours, and the stairs just had to be broken at this time. I'm finding a way to fix it as we speak.
:'''Huai'an:''' And to think that we made you take the trouble to bring this package up for me. Here, take this as a token of my appreciation.
:'''Huai'an:''' This was originally for Zhen Qing, but since he made you deliver the package for him, then the pay is yours by right.
:'''Huai'an:''' Well then, I must be going to get the preparations for repairs going. Feel free to have a look around the inn. If there's anything you need, you can look for me at any time.
