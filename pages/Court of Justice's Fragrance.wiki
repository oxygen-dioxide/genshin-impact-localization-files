|description    = A unique metal-glass composite building identical in style to the perfume shops under the [[Confrerie of Cabriere]] banner. While the colorful walls and decorations are practically the same as other stores, it features sturdier metal and glass, boasting both being "strong as armor" and "100-year rustproof durability." Even if a particularly ignorant criminal dared to take a shot at robbing the Confrerie, they would find the windows impervious to their tools. In contrast, even a grocery store's wall would warp if hammered repeatedly.<br>Supposedly, using an identical design as other stores is the confrerie's marketing ploy to attract various consumers. After all, overly lavish storefronts tend to intimidate and discourage customers on a budget. A "relatively normal" appearance would make the store seem more approachable, or at least entice customers to come inside and browse.
