|text      = I don't really know the exact date I was born, but my family always said I'm also one of their "blessed children," and that everyone deserves at least one special day of celebration each year.

Back then, I didn't fully understand the meaning behind it, so I simply went along with their suggestion and chose the date I was adopted as my own.

After living through the war, I've come to cherish what I have now more than ever, and I'd like to spend more time with those I hold dear, family and friends alike.

This year, besides my family, I want to invite some truly precious friends. I have a feeling this birthday celebration will be livelier than ever before.

The seasoned meat and fish are already prepped. I'm just waiting for the guests to arrive so I can start grilling.

The fire is crackling away, and if you take too long, I might just hop on my ride and come fetch you myself.
