==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Farid:''' Sometimes, places with a lot of people can be safer than you think.
:{{DIcon}} Are you on patrol?
::'''Farid:''' Yeah. It's my job to patrol around.
::'''Farid:''' There's no danger around here. You can travel as you wish.
::'''Farid:''' But that isn't necessarily true. A few days ago, there were two groups of researchers here who started a group fight. I was almost pulled into it.
::'''Farid:''' Even in Sumeru City, you can still be in danger when faced with researchers who seem mild-mannered. It is a must to always be on the alert.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Farid:''' Goodbye.
