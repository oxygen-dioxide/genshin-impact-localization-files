|description    = A shrub commonly found in the wilds of Natlan. Its foliage is dense and lush, growing out in multiple branches, though all from a single root system. It is said to thrive in rocky pits dug up by Tepetlisaurs, and as a result of this, some Children of Echoes even used to gauge the richness of surrounding mineral veins based on the presence of these shrubs. However, this method was never very reliable to begin with, and has since been completely abandoned.
