{{Description|The legendary flower "Auguste" was once all the rage in Fontaine, but went completely extinct amidst a sea of flame.<br>Many years later, rumors of Auguste reappearing in Sumeru spread like wildfire, and all manner of people rushed to Port Ormos...<br>The delayed judgment shall finally be delivered, and the smoldering embers shall reignite.<br>People create floriography for flowers, imbue perfume with symbolism, and attach their love and hatred to objects... to remind themselves to never forget.}}

==Trivia==
* The quests are named after {{w|Note_(perfumery)|perfumory notes}}: top notes, middle notes, and base notes; which denote groups of scents which can be sensed with respect to the time after the application of a perfume.
* The "Perfume Mania" in Fontaine is likely inspired by the {{w|tulip mania}} in the Netherlands during the 1630s, which became a famous example of an {{w|economic bubble}} after an embellished account of it was published in the book ''{{w|Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds}}'' in 1841.
** The name Auguste resembles that of the ''Semper Augustus'', which was the most expensive tulip sold during the tulip mania.
** Both the fictional Auguste flower and the real ''Semper Augustus'' were created with fatal flaws that made sustained cultivation impossible: The Auguste was created with the power of a [[Delusion]], causing the flower to contain abnormal, potentially dangerous elemental energy and the Delusion's user to rapidly age; and the coveted appearance of the ''Semper Augustus'' was owed to the {{w|tulip breaking virus}}, which causes flowers to weaken with each generation of propagations until they are incapable of producing the coveted flowers at all.
