:'''Paimon:''' The adventure on the island has come to an end... Now we have the rest of the day to enjoy ourselves!
:'''(Traveler):''' [[Paimon]], you look like you're having a lot of fun.
:'''(Traveler):''' Say, what's that in your hand?
:'''Paimon:''' It's a drawing book and pen~
:'''Paimon:''' Last night, Paimon had a very strange dream...
:'''Paimon:''' It's like we went somewhere in the dream, then Paimon woke up feeling really tired.
:'''Paimon:''' Now... Paimon can't really remember what happened...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon hates feeling this way!
:'''Paimon:''' It's like preparing a big feast in front of Paimon, then not letting Paimon touch or eat anything!
:'''Paimon:''' So, Paimon has decided to try to recreate this dream by drawing it!
:'''Paimon:''' (Traveler), if you have time, could you please help Paimon remember?

'''Wonderful Dish From the Traveler'''

A Slime Smorgasbord consisting of several types of Slimes. It looks like some interesting reactions will happen. Maybe it's a flavor Paimon will like.
== Day 2 Login ==
'''Handmade Cuisine From Kazuha'''

A dish unique to Inazuma handmade by Kazuha using Sea Ganoderma. It has the flavor of the sea. A perfect snack for summer. Save some for Paimon.
== Day 3 Login ==
'''Seafood Platter From Xinyan'''

A platter of crabs made by Xinyan. The flavor of the food has been sealed in as much as possible. It's just like Xinyan to be able to maintain the classic Liyue flavor without adding seasonings. Paimon probably also wants to try Xinyan's food.
== Day 4 Login ==
'''Half-Finished Ingredients From Oz'''

A fish that is slightly charred, thanks to the Electro element. The skin is crispy and is ready to serve once it is sprinkled with some seasoning. According to Oz, Fischl sent for him to catch it, which must have been a lot of work. Give a few pieces to Paimon!
== Day 5 Login ==
'''Fresh and Sweet Fruits Picked by Mona'''

Fruit gathered by Mona. It is juicy and has a sweet taste when you bite into it. Huh, is it possible to predict the sweetness of fruits using hydromancy? Save some for Paimon.

:'''Paimon:''' (Traveler), you're here!
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, let's try to recall what happened!
:'''Paimon:''' Last night, after eating the fruit and grilled seafood made by [[Kazuha]], Paimon felt really sleepy...
:'''(Traveler):''' You ate too much yesterday, Paimon.
:'''Paimon:''' But Kazuha's food was just too delicious~
:'''Paimon:''' Before falling asleep, Paimon thought "Let Paimon dream of seafood tonight." This is a very important clue!
:'''(Traveler):''' This isn't an important clue at all...
:'''Paimon:''' Yes, it is!
:'''Paimon:''' Because Paimon's {{Color|#EA8A56|dream took place on an island}}!
:'''Paimon:''' This island was very familiar...
:'''Paimon:''' It's probably the {{Color|#EA8A56|first island we went to}}, but Paimon can't seem to put a finger on it... {{Color|#d5bba5|(Please choose the correct answer from the following options using the hints)}}
:{{DIcon}} Is it an island with half a wrecked ship?

::'''Paimon:''' Yep yep!

:'''Paimon:''' (Traveler), it seems our island trip has made a big impression on you!
:'''Paimon:''' Our first stop on this trip to the [[Golden Apple Archipelago]] was also the island with lots of Dodocos!
:'''(Traveler):''' It's all thanks to [[Klee]] and [[Alice]] that we had the opportunity to spend a vacation on the archipelago.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon had a lot of fun on the island!
:'''Paimon:''' But the means of transportation to the island... Now that Paimon thinks about it, it still feels a little fishy...

:;(Back to choice selection)
:'''Paimon:''' It was how Paimon arrived at the island in the dream!
:'''Paimon:''' But "Kaboomball Fortress" is a hard name to remember...
:'''Paimon:''' If it were up to Paimon, it would have a name that's much easier to remember.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, a simple and easy name like "Teleportation Fortress" would be easy to recall!
:'''(Traveler):''' Paimon sure does have a knack for naming things...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon also remembered, it was dark inside the fortress, and Paimon felt dizzy after coming out...
:'''Paimon:''' When Paimon came out of the fortress, Paimon seemed to see something...
:'''(Traveler):''' What did you see?
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... Paimon can't quite make it out.
:'''Paimon:''' But Paimon can still vaguely remember its shape!
:'''Paimon:''' Here is a rough description of how it looks. Paimon wonders what it really is... {{Color|#d5bba5|(Please choose the correct answer from the following options according to the outline shown)}}

:;(Back to choice selection)
:'''Paimon:''' Yup, that one! Paimon saw a flying Treasure Chest in the air!
:'''(Traveler):''' ?
:'''Paimon:''' At that time, Paimon thought this must have been a treasure in the sky just for Paimon. After all, Paimon's the only one who can fly and catch it, hehe!
:'''(Traveler):''' (But Paimon can't fly as high as I can jump.)
:'''(Traveler):''' So you managed to catch up with the Treasure Chest?
:'''Paimon:''' It was flying so fast that it disappeared...
:'''Paimon:''' In the end, Paimon didn't catch up with it. Paimon felt very exhausted after flying for so long!
:'''(Traveler):''' So that's why you're so tired after your dreams...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon wishes to have the same dream tonight!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon will get it this time!

==Dream 2==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Paimon:''' (Traveler), Paimon really managed to have a dream that continued from the last one!
:'''(Traveler):''' (So Paimon's wish actually came true...)
:'''Paimon:''' This time, Paimon remembered where the dream was. It was [[Pudding Isle/2.8|Pudding Isle]]!
:'''Paimon:''' The island had so many maple trees and maple leaves, so it left a deep impression on Paimon!
:'''(Traveler):''' So did you manage to find that flying Treasure Chest?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't think so... Because Paimon did not remember the thrill of finding treasure at all during that dream...
:'''Paimon:''' What happened?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon remembered dreaming about chasing {{Color|#EA8A56|a brilliantly-colored Forest Boar}} all the way to Pudding Isle.
:'''Paimon:''' {{Color|#EA8A56|A brilliantly-colored Forest Boar}}... What could it be?
:{{DIcon}} A [[Forest Boar]] that got food poisoning?
::'''(Traveler):''' Is it a Forest Boar that got food poisoning?

::'''(Traveler):''' Is it a "Dream Form"?
::'''Paimon:''' Yes, that's it!
:;(Continue on)
:'''Paimon:''' Whenever (Traveler) pursues a [[Seelie]], we always find treasure.
:'''Paimon:''' So, Paimon believed that she would definitely find the treasure chest by following this seelie.
:'''Paimon:''' But while Paimon was chasing it, some {{Color|#EA8A56|flying elemental creature}} blocked the way...
:'''Paimon:''' Every time (Traveler) faces this {{Color|#EA8A56|wicked flying creature}}, a headache would follow. But why?
:{{DIcon}} An Anemo Slime
::'''(Traveler):''' Could it be... an Anemo Slime?

::'''Paimon:''' Hmm... That's not it... Paimon doesn't think there was any Eye of the Storm on Pudding Isle.
::'''Paimon:''' Let Paimon think about it...
:;(Back to choice selection)
:'''Paimon:''' It was a group of Specters that blocked Paimon's way!
:'''(Traveler):''' Paimon, you would have run for the hills if you encountered Specters when you were alone.
:'''(Traveler):''' What caught your attention?
:'''Paimon:''' That's because among those Specters, there was a living creature calling for Paimon's help...
:'''Paimon:''' When Paimon sees someone in need of help, Paimon never hesitates to lend a helping hand!
:'''(Traveler):''' (Umm, pretty sure it's because you couldn't resist the temptation of treasure and accepted troublesome commissions...)
:'''Paimon:''' Here is a rough description of how the creature looks. Paimon wonders what it really was...
:{{DIcon}} Great Misfortune
::'''(Traveler):''' I can sense it's "Great Misfortune" if we have today's fortune told!
::'''Paimon:''' Great Misfortune... Will Paimon never be able to catch the treasure chest?
::'''Paimon:''' Wait, hold on. Since when did you become a fortune teller?
::'''Paimon:''' And not a very good one!
::'''Paimon:''' Hmph! Paimon will figure this out by herself!
:;(Back to choice selection)
:{{DIcon}} An elemental creature with a strange plant on its head.
::'''(Traveler):''' Could it be... a [[Dendro Slime]]?
::'''Paimon:''' No! Why would a Dendro Slime be among a bunch of Specters!
::'''(Traveler):''' Why?
::'''Paimon:''' Let Paimon think about it...

:'''Paimon:''' Specters are dangerous indeed but Paimon can't just let this go.
:'''(Traveler):''' Heroic! Good for you, Paimon!
:'''Paimon:''' Hee-hee~
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon chased away the Specters with all her strength but the treasure chest had already flown away...
:'''(Traveler):''' Guess Paimon will have to make another wish to carry on with the previous dream tonight.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon will not let it slip away this time!

==Dream 3==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph! Paimon is really angry right now!
:'''(Traveler):''' What's wrong, Paimon?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon carried on with where the dream left off last night!
:'''(Traveler):''' Isn't it a good thing?
:'''Paimon:''' But the treasure chest fled again!
:'''(Traveler):''' Uhh... What happened in your dream this time?
:'''Paimon:''' Give Paimon a second... Paimon was on [[Broken Isle/2.8|Broken Isle]] and was flying along the stream...
:'''Paimon:''' As Paimon was flying, a cave appeared right in front of Paimon out of nowhere.
:'''Paimon:''' By the side of the cave, there was something floating in the air...
:'''Paimon:''' It was something that we {{Color|#EA8A56|see a lot in Daily Commissions}}...
:'''Paimon:''' Looked like {{Color|#EA8A56|a tool for shipping cargoes}}...

::'''Paimon:''' How does a Hilichurl Tower ship cargoes?
::'''Paimon:''' Let Paimon think about it...
:;(Back to choice selection)
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon came to the front of the cave entrance, and there was a BIG Slime Balloon...
:'''Paimon:''' And someone had already tied Paimon's treasure chest to the Slime Balloon!
:'''(Traveler):''' I don't think it was yours yet...
:'''Paimon:''' But Paimon called shotgun!
:'''(Traveler):''' ?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon remembers there was {{Color|#EA8A56|a monster that we are familiar with}} by the side of the Balloon...
:'''Paimon:''' They must've been the bad guys who took Paimon's treasure chest away!
:'''Paimon:''' When Paimon approached them, Paimon heard {{Color|#EA8A56|a suspicious "Ya!"}} Who could it be...

:'''Paimon:''' With one punch, Paimon sent those terrible, terrible treasure chest-snatching hilichurls flying up into the sky!
:'''(Traveler):''' You sure went to great lengths for the treasure chest...
:'''(Traveler):''' But I remember you said that you didn't get the treasure chest in the end?
:'''Paimon:''' That was because Paimon broke the Slime Balloon with her powerful strike, too...
:'''Paimon:''' And the treasure chest fled during the chaos!
:'''(Traveler):''' (Seems like Paimon has to try again in her dream tonight...)

:'''Paimon:''' Paimon feels dizzy...
:'''(Traveler):''' What's wrong, Paimon? You look pale.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon is too tired after last night's dream...
:'''Paimon:''' But Paimon can't recall what happened in that dream...
:'''Paimon:''' The only thing that Paimon remembers is that Paimon hunted the treasure chest down to Twinning Isle...
:'''(Traveler):''' ([[Twinning Isle/2.8|Twinning Isle]]... The island affected by [[Fischl]]'s dream.)
:'''Paimon:''' Then Paimon lost track of it after making a turn!

:'''Paimon:''' Hey! Paimon has tried her best helping (Traveler) solve puzzles during our adventures together!
:'''Paimon:''' Not to mention this time, in order to find out where that treasure chest went, Paimon took the challenge like a champ!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon dreamed of about five Night Raven Statues...
:'''Paimon:''' And they gathered around someone lying on the floor...
:'''Paimon:''' This certain someone must be connected to the Night Ravens' puzzle!
:'''(Traveler):''' But all you can remember is nothing but a mere silhouette?

:'''(Traveler):''' Do you mean "Overloaded"?
:'''Paimon:''' Yup, that one!
:'''Paimon:''' Being mentally crushed like that, Paimon was completely exhausted...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon hasn't really recovered even after waking up...
:'''(Traveler):''' No wonder you mentioned being dizzy this morning.
