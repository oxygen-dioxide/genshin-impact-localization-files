==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Eloise:''' Hmm? Is something the matter?
:{{DIcon}} In a bad mood, perhaps?
::'''Eloise:''' Hmph. Thanks for asking.
::'''Eloise:''' I was just here for a quick meal &mdash; not to have a waiter look down his nose at me for picking the wrong wine to go with my food!
::'''Eloise:''' I mean, aren't both Chardon and Corte white wines? Why do people have to make such a hue and cry about something as simple as a meal?
::'''Eloise:''' The most infuriating thing is that when I tried to resolve the situation by following his recommendation, not only was the price cheaper, but the flavor really was better than the one I'd picked originally.
::'''Eloise:''' I mean, I should've thanked him, but his attitude really was... Darn it.
:{{DIcon}} What are you thinking about?
:;(Before completing ''Masquerade of the Guilty'')
:::'''Eloise:''' Why are our legal systems and court processes the way they are?
:::'''Eloise:''' I've been to other nations, and upon learning their laws, I've come to find our theatrical trials less and less bearable.
:::'''Eloise:''' Such drama denigrates the law and affects the development of art... What in the world are the higher-ups thinking?
:;(After completing ''Masquerade of the Guilty'')
:::'''Eloise:''' I just feel there are some subtle changes underway with Fontaine's legal systems and judicial processes.
:::'''Eloise:''' I've been to other nations and studied their systems. And since, I've come to find our theatrical trials less and less bearable.
:::'''Eloise:''' But I do think there's been less theatrics lately. Our visitors seem to be coming to learn about the law, rather than to see a spectacle.
:::'''Eloise:''' Or am I wrong? I'll have to keep observing.
:{{DIcon}} Nothing.
::'''Eloise:''' See you.
