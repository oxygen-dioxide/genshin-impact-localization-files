'''Ruins Torches''', colloquially known as '''Pyro Torches''', are small structures found sticking out of the ground. They are activated with {{Color|Pyro DMG}} and remain permanently activated when the puzzle is solved.

Sometimes, they are found in groups of four and are used to unlock the chest on a [[triskelion]] platform. These platforms have segments which light up when its respective torch is lit; each segment also points in the general direction of its torch. Once the platform is completely lit up, the chest is unlocked.

Other times only a specific subset of a group of torches need to be activated as part of a puzzle to unlock the chest.

A [[Loading Screen]] tip about Ruins Torches reads: "They say the insignia on the platform sealing the chest hints at the direction of the ruins torch. Some adventurers utilize this clue when hunting for treasure."
