{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Ann)
:'''Ann:''' Are you ready to leave?
:{{DIcon}} Let's go.
::'''Ann:''' Yep, let's go!
::{{Black Screen|The entrance is sealed once more with the power of the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz...}}
::{{Black Screen|"I see."<br>The person who almost saved the world spoke: "The Holy Blade need not be a sword. It could even be a gold-haired outlander."<br>"And now the younger sister, who never stood forth as part of the adventure, has grasped a sword at last."<br><br>With that, you return to the Narzissenkreuz Ordo...}}
:;(Teleport to the Narzissenkreuz Ordo)
:{{DIcon}} Let's wait a little longer.
::'''Narzissenkreuz:''' There is nothing here now. Just a majestic yet suppressed life force.
::'''Narzissenkreuz:''' But if you are curious, we can watch some more.
:;(Stay in the [[Genesis of a Certain Micro-Universe]])

:'''Caterpillar:''' I knew you'd come back in one piece.
:'''Paimon:''' And we're glad that you and Seymour are okay!
:'''Seymour:''' In fact, the floor was quickly flooded by the rising water level, incapacitating the security machinery.
:'''Seymour:''' Mr. Caterpillar carried me out under his arm.
:'''Caterpillar:''' I said "in one piece," and indeed, everyone is accounted for. So, how is there one more person here?
:'''Ann:''' Well, allow me to introduce Narzissenkreuz. Or, rather, what's left of Narzissenkreuz.
:'''Caterpillar:''' ...Master.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' You've made progress, Caterpillar. You seem even more human now than you did centuries ago.
:'''Caterpillar:''' I thought I'd be more excited to see you... but I feel unexpectedly calm.
:'''Caterpillar:''' Over the last several hundred years, I've read many books and come to understand more about your teachings &mdash; as well as some of the absurdities in your theories.
:'''Seymour:''' Image record of the individual known as "Narzissenkreuz" has been updated. Please do not make any sudden moves, Narzissenkreuz.
:'''Ann:''' Silly dog, you're not going to initiate your Mass Annihilation Mode again, are you?
:'''Seymour:''' I judge that the threat he constitutes to you is low. Still, do not make any sudden moves, Narzissenkreuz.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Ah, Alain Guillotin's creation. I once saw a bright future for it, that it could perhaps achieve what the ancient peoples' golems could not... Not that it matters now.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Could you let me inspect its internals? Just out of a desire for knowledge, of course.
:'''Ann:''' Seymour's our companion, you know!
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Fine.
:'''Caterpillar:''' "Saving the world" is usually just poetic rhetoric one employs to alleviate mental illness...
:'''Caterpillar:''' Whether it takes the form of protecting the flame of a candle until the pilgrimage is done, or writing a story that allows fiction to invade reality.
:'''Caterpillar:''' Did you recover from your malady in the end?
:'''Caterpillar:''' Master, you now know what became of the Narzissenkreuz Ordo. What will you do next?
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' There may be a hint of irony in your voice when you call me "Master," but I will accept it nonetheless.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' You surely know about your birth?
:'''Caterpillar:''' I'm not interested in that anymore. You were simply toying with life &mdash; a kind of indifference I find despicable.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' I will accept that, too.
:'''Paimon:''' Your attitude is so negative. Have you given up on yourself?
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' I will answer your question, then. My offer from before still stands. I will reveal the mysteries to them and answer any questions.
:{{DIcon}} In that case...
::{{DIcon}} Please take Ann to find out the truth about her origins.
:{{Black Screen|You explain the other Mary-Ann to Narzissenkreuz...}}
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Ah, so that's what happened to the Director and Mary-Ann.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' I will help you, of course. It is something I ought to do.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Let us go to the Kingdom Through the Looking-Glass together.
:'''Caterpillar:''' Well, as for your wish from before, Paimon, I've done everything I can. I'll be staying out of whatever happens next.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? What wish?
:'''Caterpillar:''' Is your memory that much worse than mine? Didn't you ask me to help you help Ann and Seymour?
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, right! But why don't you want to come with us, then?
:'''Caterpillar:''' I think the next matter is very personal for Ann and Mary-Ann. That scene doesn't call for a character like me.
:'''Caterpillar:''' But you, {{Traveler}} and Paimon, are different. You're the heroes of this story.
:{{DIcon}} Yes, the mighty heroine Paimon!
:'''Caterpillar:''' Well, Paimon should actually be...
:'''Paimon:''' Be what? Hm? You're not about to say something mean, are you, Caterpillar?
:'''Caterpillar:''' Whatever do you mean? You're the kind, guiding fairy at the hero's side, of course.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... F&mdash;Fine! Paimon will take that!
:'''Caterpillar:''' Once you finish up over there, let us things-that-used-to-be-human have a little reunion.
:'''Seymour:''' Should I go with {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, then?
:'''Caterpillar:''' Of course you should. I mean, you've been seeking the end of the quest this whole time. You, too, need an answer, don't you?
:'''Seymour:''' I apologize. I do not understand.
:'''Ann:''' In that case, Seymour, you wait for us with Caterpillar.
:'''Caterpillar:''' It's settled then. When it's just about time, I'll bring you to them.
:'''Seymour:''' Understood.
:'''Ann:''' Seymour, Caterpillar... Thank you.
:'''Ann:''' Shall we?
:'''Paimon:''' Alright! Let's go find Mary-Ann!

;(Talk to Caterpillar, optional)
:'''Caterpillar:''' Well, hurry up and get it done, then. We do need to have that get-together, don't we?
:'''Caterpillar:''' The reason why I'm not worried about everything going smoothly is...
:'''Caterpillar:''' Well, Narzissenkreuz is an absolutely reliable guide, so there won't be any issues with him around.

;(Talk to Seymour, optional)
:'''Seymour:''' An explanation? What do you mean?
:'''Seymour:''' My operations require energy and commands, not explanations.
:'''Seymour:''' Still... Maintaining a primary directive system and logic module that both constantly return errors has brought me to the verge of shutdown.
:'''Seymour:''' Perhaps... I do... need some assistance.
----
;(Go to Annapausis)
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, this is even worse than last time... How's everything back to the way it was?
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Ann, you of purest water &mdash; visualize in detail what this place would be like if all obstacles receded before you.
:'''Paimon:''' Will that do anything?
:'''Ann:''' Caterpillar said before that the story has already lost its meaning. As such, these imaginary things aren't necessary anymore.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' This is how it might be for a low-level seeker. However, you are also the master of this place.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Some believe the world to be only a prison of suffering, devoid of meaning. But you wield power over this place. So, rewrite it &mdash; imbue it with meaning.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Only the hubris of one who believes themselves above the world can give rise to miracles.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Had I not fervently believed I was above the apocalypse, I would not be where I am now.
:'''Ann:''' Are you saying that you also believe the world has meaning?
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Why else would I have made so many plans to save it?
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' On second thought, perhaps Caterpillar was right, and one only seeks the world's salvation to prove that they themselves deserve it.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't really get what that means.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Only by transforming oneself into a being of light to bring hope to a darkened world may one be permitted to enter the eternal kingdom of light after death.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Are martyrs who perish for the world's sins undeserving of salvation?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon gets it... and doesn't get it at the same time.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' It is no matter. My teachings no longer have an audience.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Oceanid Ann &mdash; can you do what I said?
:'''Ann:''' I'll give it a try.
::(The water drains upwards out of the area)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa...
:'''Paimon:''' You're amazing, Ann!
:{{DIcon}} You're amazing, Ann!
:'''Ann:''' ...
:'''Ann:''' Thank you. But I don't feel that amazing... Why is that?
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Because this is something you would normally take for granted. You have simply remembered a fragment of your origin.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Let us press on.

:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' You are most talented, Ann. Would you like to inherit Narzissenkreuz's...
:'''Ann:''' I'll pass!

;(Approach the underground lake)
:'''Ann:''' Let me see what I can do.

;(Cross the condensed water bridge)
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Go back.
:'''Paimon:''' Look back to the rear!
:'''Ann:''' Allow me!
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' You're getting the hang of magic, it seems.
:'''Ann:''' We'll make it faster this way.

;(Approach the tower)
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Why must you force my hand?
:'''Mary-Ann:''' ...I must defend this place.
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, so many, and deployed like that... This is just bombarding blindly!
:'''Ann:''' I also have people I must protect.
:'''Ann:''' Knight {{Traveler}}!
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Go back.
:'''Ann:''' I believe in you, Knight {{Traveler}}!
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Go back!
:'''Ann:''' Narzissenkreuz... Remember to come back here if you're about to get blown away.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Prejudice unabashed, I see.

;(After dodging the bubbles)
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Go back...
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Please, I beg of you...
:'''Paimon:''' Mary-Ann's voice really is getting weaker. It's gone from a command to a request...
:'''Paimon:''' Still, it sure doesn't look like she's begging us!
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Can you push yourself still further, Ann?
:'''Ann:''' It's fine. Since we've already come this far, there's no point in turning back now.
:'''Ann:''' Forgive me, Mary-Ann, but we must get through this place.
:'''Paimon:''' You got rid of them all, Ann?
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' It's pointless to resist the truth. Ann merely denied that futile resistance.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Let's keep moving forward.
:'''Paimon:''' The door here is shut! How are we going to get inside now...?
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, if we can't get in, then we can't get to that dizzying corridor and room, and can't jump down to that place where we fought Narcissus...
:'''Ann:''' No problem. Allow me to ensure this visit of ours won't be in vain.
:'''Ann:''' Liddell is also nothing more than a figment of the Red Empress' dream. And this time, it's time to wake up.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Indeed, that is the case.

;(Approach the "Will to Resist" at "The Real Annapausis")
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Why... Why couldn't you just leave us here in peace?
:'''Paimon:''' Mary-Ann!
:'''Paimon:''' We... We should be able to help you this time! Please, let us in!
:'''Mary-Ann:''' No! I don't need your help! Please leave, I'm begging you...
:'''Ann:''' Princess Lyris. Your story should have you living happily ever after. I won't give up.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' This barrier is composed of an extremely hard and resistant will. But the Holy Blade is in your hands now, {{Traveler}}.
:'''Paimon:''' If Paimon remembers correctly, the Holy Blade should be able to cut through any will that comes from water...
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Correct, clever one.
:{{DIcon}} I've got it.
::{{DIcon}} Sorry, Mary-Ann. Just bear with us.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' ...
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Don't come back here again. It's warm here, and I like it that way.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Don't come to me with your expectations &mdash; with that determined look on your face.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Just leave me alone, till the consciousness that keeps this form together fades away...

:'''Mary-Ann:''' No one needs saving... and that's great.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Just let me decay here on my own, until everything has broken down, until nothing more than a puddle of dirty water is left...
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Please, stop! I'm begging you! Stay away! This is our Annapausis.

;(Smash the "Will to Resist")
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Why are you doing this? Is the truth really that important?
:'''Mary-Ann:''' What's wrong with forever dwelling on dreams of the past?
:{{DIcon}} It may be that the truth isn't that important.
::{{DIcon}} But the future is.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Indeed. Even if you all regard me as a villain, I have never once given up on the future.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Wait. You're...!?
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' That is correct. I am Narzissenkr&mdash;
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Rene!
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' ...Yes, I am Rene. This is who I am now.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' I am most pleased to see "you both," as well as Ann.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Your present state could be said to be something beyond human or Oceanid. A state of transcendence.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' As human is to ape, so is superhuman to human. You are now the meaning of Fontaine itself.
:'''Paimon:''' ...Is this really a good time to be saying this sorta stuff?
:'''Paimon:''' You don't think about anyone else's feelings, do you, Narzissenkreuz?
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' My apologies. I am responsible for the circumstances that led you all here.
:'''Ann:''' It's okay. I've already forgiven him, Mary-Ann.
:'''Ann:''' Please, look at this.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' This is...!
:[[File:Item Unlocked Treasure Image.png|200px]]
:'''Mary-Ann:''' This is the eternity I've always longed to protect...
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Rene.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Yes?
:'''Mary-Ann:''' I can't forgive "Narzissenkreuz" just yet. But "Rene"... is a different story.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' ...
:'''Mary-Ann:''' The Narzissenkreuz Institute was our home. Why did things turn out this way?
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' It was likely doomed to be thus from the moment Alain had us act out the story of the hero Narzissenkreuz and the evil dragon over and over.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' I, too, miss the way things used to be. But Narzissenkreuz was born out of the delusion of salvation &mdash; and what a protracted dream that was.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' But I was roused from that dream. Now, it is your turn.
:'''Ann:''' It's not a contradiction to accept your past as well as how you'll live your life going forward. That's what Caterpillar told me.
:'''Ann:''' The apocalypse has been stopped, and the future is full of possibilities.
:'''Ann:''' The future holds more for you than just pain &mdash; this, I promise you.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' If you cannot accept yourself, you could allow Ann to merge with you.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Then, use the Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz to separate the personas of Lyris and young Mary-Ann.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' That won't be necessary, I'm willing to accept the past. Our little hero Ann's adventure is hers alone.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' I will live on as myself and see what the world you risked everything to save is like, Rene.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? The Holy Blade of Narzissenkreuz is...
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' I see. Your will has been conveyed, Mary-Ann. The Holy Blade's purpose has been fulfilled, and its significance in the story has ended.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Paimon doesn't totally get it, but does it mean that {{Traveler}} won't be able to use that cool title anymore?
:{{DIcon}} Fine by me.
:{{DIcon}} That's too bad.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Let us return to the original topic. You said that you'd like to see the outside. But this is now Guillotin's world. I doubt there will be much to see.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' However, if you can bring yourself to like it, that would be ideal.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Ann, Rene... Shall we travel together?
:'''Ann:''' Absolutely!
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' As for me... Regrettably, you must allow me to decline. There is still something that I must do.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Oh, okay... In that case, don't forget to give me your address. I'll write to you about what Ann and I encounter on our journey.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Just like when you and Jakob would tell me about what you saw in Sumeru.
:'''Ann:''' Except I'm afraid our journey will have to wait a teeny bit longer. Caterpillar did say that we would have a reunion, or something...
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' That's right. He should be here soon. Let's wait a little longer for him, shall we?
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, you two do you. Let's take this opportunity to talk to Mary-Ann, {{Traveler}}!
<!-- screen transition -->
:'''Caterpillar:''' Perhaps I should have proposed a toast, "to us who were once human."
:'''Caterpillar:''' Though, I don't think any of us could imbibe the way we are now.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Was there anything that could not be said before we set off?
:'''Caterpillar:''' I'm just giving you a chance. It may not have been a good time for you to say some things back there.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' You could tell? Well, it cannot be helped.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' I have expended too much of my power. I shall not remain able to maintain myself for long.
:'''Ann:''' But... Why?
:'''Ann:''' We worked so hard to...
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' ... But before I disappear, tell me what you have learned over these last few centuries.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' I would like to know what sort of dreams you had.
:'''Ann:''' ...
:'''Ann:''' Until I met Knight {{Traveler}} and Paimon... I was always searching for Princess Lyris.
:'''Ann:''' Even after learning the truth &mdash; that I was just a character in someone's dream &mdash; I have no regrets.
:'''Ann:''' That's because I've already completed the best and greatest adventure of all. Perhaps my reward is being able to turn my dreams into reality.
:'''Caterpillar:''' I was just going back and forth between prison and books, occasionally dreaming about parts of my previous life.
:'''Caterpillar:''' There were times when I wondered whether the butterfly became me, or I became the butterfly.
:'''Caterpillar:''' But once I awoke, I would realize that I was only a caterpillar. The butterfly is also me, but whether it's the future or past me is hard to say.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Dreams, magic, memories, esotericism.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' All that I once held dear now seems worthless to me.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' During the first ten years, I focused all my power on preventing the dissipation of my will.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' During the years that followed, I used that potent will to construct a universe within myself to resist my coming fate. That is how I held on.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' I suppose it is the same for you &mdash; to build a beautiful dream out of the ruins of what was once our home. That is an incredible thing.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Mary-Ann was right. It's warm here.
:'''Ann:''' Yes, I know.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' I grow weary. Ann, please leave me here.
:'''Narzissenkreuz:''' Farewell.
:{{Black Screen|He never did change his name back to Rene, did he?}}
:{{Black Screen|"What if life is just a dream?"...}}
:'''Paimon:''' ...Oh! So this is where the adventure we and Ann had came from.
:'''Paimon:''' No wonder everything was so chaotic. It wasn't finished!
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Yeah. I couldn't figure an ending out.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' At that point, everything had fallen apart. But the more such things happen, the more we want a simple, happy ending.
:'''Paimon:''' You know, sometimes you say "I" and sometimes you say "we"... Are you really Mary-Ann, or are you Lyris, the Oceanid they're always talking about?
:'''Mary-Ann:''' I don't know... Well, not that it matters anymore.
:'''Paimon:''' Ann! Caterpillar! You're back!
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Where's Rene?
:'''Ann:''' He...
:'''Caterpillar:''' ...He was a bit tired, so he went to rest.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmph! Well, Paimon hopes he turns over a new leaf and stops causing trouble!
:'''Caterpillar:''' Seymour, you can come over now.
:'''Seymour:''' Understood.
:'''Seymour:''' ...
:'''Seymour:''' Ms. Mary-Ann! Ms. Mary-Ann...
:'''Mary-Ann:''' ...
:'''Seymour:''' ...Your new hair and eye colors are simply dazzling.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Honestly, you silly dog. Is that all you can say?
:'''Seymour:''' My language center is unable to express the information I am processing.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' I know. You're the same as ever...
:'''Mary-Ann:''' ...Sorry. I missed you so much...
:'''Mary-Ann:''' ...Right, so such things happened, huh? Then there's Jakob...
:'''Seymour:''' {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}} and Ms. Paimon's description largely fits with the facts. But one thing must be added.
:'''Seymour:''' My power output during combat has been far below expectations. This is because over 30 percent of my components were damaged during the battle at Elynas and have not been maintained since.
:'''Seymour:''' I hope you will consider this when evaluating my performance and will not choose to scrap me.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Of course not!
:'''Ann:''' You have always been strong and brave. You are much more resilient than "we" are, Seymour.
:'''Seymour:''' Indeed. My designer, Alain Guillotin, is Fontaine's leading engineer, and the components I am made of represent the best of the nation's material science and craftsmanship.
:{{DIcon}} That's not what she meant...
:{{DIcon}} You're most formidable, Seymour!
::'''Seymour:''' Thank you for your accurate assessment.
::'''Paimon:''' But that's not what Ann was trying to say...
:'''Seymour:''' What are your next orders, Ms. Mary-Ann?
:'''Mary-Ann & Ann:''' ...
:'''Ann:''' You decide, Mary-Ann. As far as Seymour is concerned, I'm just Ann.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Seymour, what would you like to do?
:'''Seymour:''' My primary directive is to accompany and protect you, Ms. Mary-Ann, on behalf of Alain Guillotin.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Oh, you silly&mdash; Those were my brother's... Alain's instructions. I'm asking you what you "want" to do.
:'''Seymour:''' ...I once promised Ms. Mamere that once I found my mistress, I would return to her coordinates and thank her.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' And that was correct of you. Good dog.
:'''Seymour:''' ?
:'''Ann:''' Mary-Ann, do you remember what you once said to me?
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Yes. Seymour, I hope you can become the "master of your own fate" &mdash; that in the future, you will do what you "want" to do, and what you think is right.
:'''Seymour:''' Ms. Mary-Ann...
:'''Seymour:''' Do I understand this correctly? Are you saying that my previously-received orders should be regarded as null and void?
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Yes. So let me ask you again, Seymour &mdash; what do you want to do?
:'''Seymour:''' I wish to remain by your side, Ms. Mary-Ann. But I also wish to accompany Ms. Mamere. However, I calculate that the spatial requirements of those two wishes are incompatible.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Perhaps not. We will be taking a trip to explore this world. And Ms. Mamere is an artist, isn't she?
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Then let our journeys coincide. We will leave our footprints in the deserts, in the forests, and in the snowfields. In the lost Ancient City of Ys, and in Arcadia, and in golden Hyperborea.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' We will enjoy the sights we see and the stories we write together. What do you think, Seymour?
:'''Seymour:''' I find that's a very reasonable suggestion, Ms. Mary-Ann. But I will need to ask for Ms. Mamere's consent.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Yes, of course. Let us agree to meet here...
:'''Mary-Ann:''' In any case, I'm eager to meet this artist who's kept you company for so long.
:'''Seymour:''' Coordinates entered.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' So, next...
:'''Ann:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, and Caterpillar... You were the bravest and strongest of all. Thank you all so much.
:{{DIcon}} Wait, so I'm no longer a knight?
:'''Ann:''' That story is over. And for me, for "us," you, as you are now, are the realest and most important of all.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' And not just in the story when you play the role of a knight.
:'''Ann:''' Just like the Holy Blade in the story became a new sword when its mission was complete, so too will the knight return as a new person.
:'''Paimon:''' Uh... Paimon can't decide if you're praising or criticizing {{Traveler}} here...
:'''Ann:''' It is praise, of course!
:'''Mary-Ann:''' You have written an end to an unfinishable story, and you have brought us a new tale.
:'''Ann:''' We will never forget this.
:'''Paimon:''' Aw, c'mon, there's no need to be so polite!
:'''Caterpillar:''' I've also gained a lot from being able to play my role in this tale.
:{{DIcon}} I hope you all have a wonderful trip.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Yes! And I am confident we will meet again in the future.
:'''Seymour:''' Then, it is time for me to return to Ms. Mamere's coordinates.
:'''Paimon:''' We can come too! Caterpillar, come with us, would you?
:{{DIcon}} Let's go, Seymour.
:{{DIcon}} Caterpillar, let's see this through to the end.
:'''Caterpillar:''' Very well. I will accompany you.
;(Obtain {{Item|Sword of Narzissenkreuz|type=Weapon}})

;(Talk to Mary-Ann or Ann, optional)
:'''Ann:''' Where would you most like to go right now, Mary-Ann?
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Well... I've remained for far too long in that imaginary past-world.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' The world must have changed a lot after hundreds of years.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' I want to see this world beyond the glass wall. I want to experience new stories.
:'''Ann:''' Are you afraid, Mary-Ann?
:'''Ann:''' I know stories end, but I find it difficult to imagine that everything would end like this. From the moment I was born, the Narzissenkreuz Kingdom was everything to me...
:'''Mary-Ann:''' I understand that you're feeling more uneasy than I am. You were born for this story. But from now onward, you must start your own story... Ann's story.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' And I must slowly step away from the looming shadow of my past. Neither Lyris's memories nor Mary-Ann Guillotin's represent who I am now.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' We have a long path ahead of us, Ann.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' But I know you'll be alright.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' If you find yourself feeling afraid, we can come back here.
:'''Mary-Ann:''' Even if only ruins remain, a seed that drifts here will bloom. So long as we remain, we can always rebuild a new home.

;(Talk to Mamere)
:'''Mamere:''' {{Traveler}} and Paimon, and&mdash;
:'''Mamere:''' Seymour!
:'''Mamere:''' You knew to come back!?
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, is it just Paimon, or do you sound a little angry, Mamere?
:'''Seymour:''' Yes. Even without {{Traveler}} and Paimon's help, my positioning and navigational modules would have allowed me to return.
:'''Mamere:''' Incredible!
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, so you were just surprised?
:'''Mamere:''' Well, I knew you wouldn't disappear with the "token" that symbolizes my life and birth. I also knew that {{Traveler}} and Paimon would be sure to bring you back.
:'''Seymour:''' Returning to your side is what I "want" to do. It's not a concept I fully understand, but logic prompts me to do this. I believe this is correct.
:'''Mamere:''' Uh, that's kind of complicated, and I can't say I understand, but never mind. It's... just good that you're back.
:'''Mamere:''' Oh, and this is...
:'''Caterpillar:''' Hello. Don't worry about me. I'm just along for the ride.
:'''Mamere:''' Is that so? Well, you are a fascinating color. And regardless, I'm delighted to see Seymour.
:'''Mamere:''' I haven't heard from Father since the message {{Traveler}} passed on. And then Seymour left. It was... difficult for me.
:'''Paimon:''' (Oh, it looks like Mamere doesn't know what happened while you were in a daze...)
:'''Mamere:''' Everyone in Merusea Village helped me during that time. That's what made me realize what Father meant...
:'''Mamere:''' Oh, yes! I've been learning a new style of painting while I was with them!
:{{DIcon}} Is it even more novel than before?
:{{DIcon}} Is it even more... novel than before?
:'''Mamere:''' I think it will be easier to understand! Even the Melusines of Merusea Village can tell what I'm painting now, rather than just saying "Oh, how lovely!"
:'''Paimon:''' Wow! Paimon can't wait to see your priceless masterpieces!
:'''Mamere:''' Hehe.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, and speaking of paintings, Mary-Ann mentioned something...
:{{Black Screen|Seymour explains the idea of a joint trip.}}
:'''Mamere:''' Really? That sounds wonderful!
:'''Mamere:''' Let's set off now, then &mdash; on our round-the-world trip of artistic creation!
:'''Mamere:''' Yes, let's go. Now. This instant. I'll pack up my art supplies and clothes. You just sit tight and wait for me, alright?
:'''Seymour:''' Yes, Ms. Mamere.
:'''Paimon:''' Woah, you sure are springing into action!
:'''Mamere Inside the House:''' Of course. I mean, if you don't act, your dreams will never come true, right?
:'''Mamere Inside the House:''' Paints, paints...
:'''Seymour:''' While we wait, let me express my gratitude to you, {{MC|m=Mr.|f=Ms.}} {{Traveler}}, Ms. Paimon, and Mr. Caterpillar.
:'''Seymour:''' This is based on my own judgment and what, as Ms. Mary-Ann says, I "want" to do. With your help, I have finally been able to complete my task.
:'''Seymour:''' However, I still do not understand what it means to become "the master of my own fate." Fate, you see, is a concept humans create to help them understand things. It is not real.
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa. Paimon doesn't know how to explain this now...
:'''Caterpillar:''' Didn't they tell you? Just do what you want to do.
:'''Caterpillar:''' If you always do what you want to do, you'll become the master of your fate.
:'''Seymour:''' I see. And what I want to do now is to sit here and wait for Ms. Mamere.
:'''Paimon:''' Okay. In that case, Paimon wishes you all a good trip!
:'''Mamere Inside the House:''' Thanks, Paimon!
:'''Mamere Inside the House:''' Paintings to give them, paintings to give...
:{{DIcon}} Be a good dog and look after Mamere, alright?
:'''Seymour:''' I will. It is what I want to do.
:{{Black Screen|You and Caterpillar arrive outside Merusea Village...}}
:'''Caterpillar:''' ...So, the tale of Narzissenkreuz has ended. It is time for me to follow my own path.
:'''Paimon:''' Where will you go, Caterpillar?
:'''Caterpillar:''' That is a good question, Paimon. And since the beginning of time, only the most determined and resilient of people have found their answers.
:'''Paimon:''' There you go again!
:'''Caterpillar:''' I jest, I jest. For now, the only thing I can be sure of is that I still owe Lanoire half a story. But I don't know how it ends yet. I need...
:'''Caterpillar:''' There's a lot to consider. I don't know where I'll go, but there are a few things I need to find.
:'''Paimon:''' Is that so...
:'''Caterpillar:''' So, goodbye, {{Traveler}}, and farewell, Paimon. Meeting you both has been the most fortunate thing to happen in this "life" of mine.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye, Caterpillar.
:{{DIcon}} Likewise, Caterpillar.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah! Take care, Caterpillar. Don't let anyone find out who you really are! That'd be a pain!
