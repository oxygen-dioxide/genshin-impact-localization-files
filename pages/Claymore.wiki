'''Claymores''' are one of the five [[weapon]] types that [[characters]] can use in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''.

Claymores restrict the character wielding them to slower hits than other melee weapons like [[Swords]] and [[Polearms]], but deal more damage per hit with higher [[Interruption Resistance|interruption]] capabilities. Due to being considered [[Blunt Attack]]s, Claymore attacks deal increased damage to [[Geo]] objects and certain [[Shield]]s.

==Normal Attacks==
A Claymore user's Normal Attack chain typically consists of 3&ndash;5 slow, but powerful and wide, melee attacks.

==Charged Attacks==
A Claymore user's Charged Attack has a small windup before performing a rapid chain of attack that continuously drains their stamina. This attack will end with a more powerful slash if the attack button is released, if the character runs out of stamina, or if the max duration is reached.

When initiating a Charged Attack sequence from a standstill, Claymore users will cut short the animation of their first Normal Attack and transition it into the Charged Attack windup animation. However, if the first Normal Attack's [[Attack Speed]] is too fast, the character will finish performing the first Normal Attack before starting the Charged Attack windup. For example, [[Sayu]] who can normally directly enter a Charged Attack sequence from standstill, when at 150% Attack Speed, will have to perform her first Normal Attack before a Charged Attack sequence.

Two iterations of Claymore Charged Attack exist: a spinning attack for the short and medium-height characters and a continuous slash attack for the tall characters. However, they are functionally the same. [[Arataki Itto]] has access to a non-standard Charged Attack.

Typically, Claymore Charged Attacks cost 40 Stamina per second and can last up to 5 seconds.

==Plunging Attacks==
Claymore Plunging Attacks are considered [[Blunt Attack]]s. All Claymore users have similar animations when plunging, which involves them performing a slash downward with their sword.

==Trivia==
* The word "claymore" derives from Scottish {{Lang|mini=1|gd=''claidheamh''|gd_tl=sword}} and {{Lang|mini=1|gd=''mòr''|gd_tl=great,}} meaning "great sword."
** Only the [[Favonius Greatsword]] reasonably resembles a traditional Scottish {{w|claymore}}.
