==Descriptions==
{{Description|An aquatic creature that hunts by firing watery projectiles.<br>Among the (admittedly somewhat sparse) ranks of Fontemer Aberrant enthusiasts, Bubbly Seahorses have many fans. As with clockwork meka enthusiasts, a small minority of Fontemer Aberrant enthusiasts can be very standoffish when it comes to people whose opinions differ from their own.|[[Archive]]}}

==Trivia==
* Some Bubbly Seahorses idle by spitting water at other Bubbly Seahorses or another target. These projectiles will damage the player if they are in its path.
