{{Description|This white iron ore can be turned into a variety of splendid items in the hands of a skilled craftsman. It is suffused with memories of battles fought across the land, which makes it a great material for crafting weapons.}}
'''White Iron Chunks''' are a [[Forging Material]] item. They are used when [[forging]] for [[Fine Enhancement Ore]], [[weapons]] and to [[Creation|create]] a variety of [[Housing/Furnishing|Furnishings]].

==How to Obtain==
White Iron Chunks are generally found inside caves, mines and near mountainous terrain all around [[Teyvat]].

They can be harvested by attacking their destructible nodes, dropping 1-3 White Iron Chunks. Like all [[Geo Constructs]], it is faster to destroy them using [[Blunt Attack]]s and {{Geo}} abilities. Their respawn rate is 48 hours.

In [[Co-Op Mode]], each nearby player will get their own drops with amounts randomized separately and players will not be able to see others' drops. Unlike most [[Materials]], they cannot be affected by {{Anemo}} abilities that may move them.

They can also be dropped by some [[Investigation]] points and are awarded upon completion of some [[Expeditions]].

Additionally, the following NPCs give White Iron Chunks after following a certain dialogue branch for the first time:
*[[Ikuhara Gai]] in [[Kujou Encampment]], [[Inazuma]] (5 White Iron Chunks)
