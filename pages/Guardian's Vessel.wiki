{{Description|A metal vessel that can be filled with a drink to dispel the loneliness of the long watch.}}
'''Guardian's Vessel''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Defender's Will]].

==Description==
An exceedingly ordinary old wine canteen.<br />If one had to point out something special about it,<br />It would be that it never once contained a drop of alcohol.

"Come on, you have to try a little wine sometime."<br />The guardian's longtime friend and superior joked.<br />"Quit knitting those eyebrows together, have a little wine and song!"<br />"I mean, that's how we have the courage to face tomorrow."
