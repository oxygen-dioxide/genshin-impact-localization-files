{{Description|In the old language of Inazuma, "Nazuchi" means "to be caressed by the loving hands of the divine."<br />However, this shallow shoal has seen far too many battles and slaughters during its time.|[[Expedition]] description}}
{{Description|In the ancient language of the Inazuma ancestors, "Nazuchi" means "to be tenderly caressed by the hands of the gods." Ironically, Nazuchi Beach has been ravaged by war since a thousand years ago and has become a place for scavengers and pirates, with few inhabitants.|[[Archive]]}}
{{Location Intro|{{Lang|'''Nazuchi Beach'''|ja=名椎の浜|ja_rm=Nadzuchi no Hama}}|description=<p>A beach connecting [[Kannazuka]] and [[Yashiori Island]], Nazuchi Beach has been ravaged by war for almost a thousand years. In recent years, it has been a place of interest for both the [[Tenryou Commission]] and [[Watatsumi Army]], with weapons scattered all over the place. Both ground and naval engagements have taken place here, and third-party affiliates such as criminals have made the area a prime spot for looting what remains on the battlefield.</p>}}

==Trivia==
===Etymology===
*The ancient meaning of the name Nazuchi may be based on one of the many supposed etymologies of the Shinto deities {{Lang|{{w|Ōyamatsumi#Genealogy|Ashinazuchi}}|ja={{rubi|足|あし|名|な|椎|づち}}|ja_rm=Ashi-nadzuchi|ja_tl=Foot-Caressing Spirit}} and {{Lang|{{w|Ōyamatsumi#Genealogy|Tenazuchi}}|ja={{rubi|手|て|名|な|椎|づち}}|ja_rm=Te-nadzuchi|ja_tl=Hand-Caressing Spirit}}; whose names are thought to symbolize them affectionately caressing their daughters' hands and feet.<ref name="nadzuchi">Japanese Wiki Corpus: [https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Ashinazuchi%20and%20Tenazuchi.html Ashinazuchi and Tenazuchi]</ref>
**Ashinazuchi and Tenazuchi play a major role in the myth surrounding the legendary serpent {{w|Yamata no Orochi}}, which seems to have inspired the story of [[Orobashi]].
