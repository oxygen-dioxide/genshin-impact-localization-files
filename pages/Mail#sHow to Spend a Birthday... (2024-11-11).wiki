|text      = For me, a birthday isn't anything special. It approaches at
the same steady pace as any other day throughout the year, silently arriving and then slipping past overhead like a bird that never looks back.

That's probably why I often forget about it myself.

However, I won't deny that the way one spends their birthday can affect its significance. [[Ajaw]] has been strongly recommending a challenge that he describes as "swinging across the field using grappling hooks over molten lava." I think I'll let him try it out first.


An angry note underneath: LET GO OF ME! It's not my birthday! You insufferable old Kinich who only gets more arrogant with age, how much longer are you gonna drag me by the tail, huh!?
