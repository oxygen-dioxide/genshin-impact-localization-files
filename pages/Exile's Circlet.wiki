{{Description|A prestigious circlet. However, the royal insignia has been scratched out, and it is no longer the symbol of distinguished status that it once was.}}
'''Exile's Circlet''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[The Exile]].

==Description==
As a child, the exile lived in a noble house. His childhood was carefree, and his playground was a palace built with silver.<br />In times of old, the circlet of his father was a symbol of gentility and nobility.<br />However, years later, a family feud painted the collapsing palace blood-red.<br />The circlet became the evidence of the exile's crime and has been with the exile ever since.
