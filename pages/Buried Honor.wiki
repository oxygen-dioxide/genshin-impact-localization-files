{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo cllq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go meet up with the group! Paimon's really looking forward to today's story!

;(Enter the game venue)
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Looks like everyone's here. Before we begin, why don't we finish where we left off yesterday? There was an important decision to be made, yes? I'll pour everyone a cup of tea.
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' I&mdash;Is that really the most important part, though, Clorinde? Paimon's more concerned about our current surroundings...
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Heavy walls, cold railings, dim lights... This is obviously supposed to be a prison!
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I admire the work put into the set. Still, it's obvious the script writer has never paid a visit to the [[Fortress of Meropide]].
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' So this set... is going to be a part of the script?
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Unfortunately, that is something I can neither confirm nor deny.
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um, anyone think Clorinde's smile is starting to look kinda scary...?
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well, whatever happens, we'll just have to push on. But first, we should really figure out what to do with this treasure.
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' If we're worried about arousing suspicion because of our identity... Why don't we give ourselves a different name, just like Clorinde's Master did?
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Yeah, it might be better to keep a low profile. As long as we're helping people, it doesn't matter who we are or what we're called.
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um...
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Staring at me won't get you anywhere. Or, did you want some more tea?
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, um... Paimon's good! Thanks!
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why aren't you saying anything, Navia? Wait... What's that next to you?
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Oh, this is the short sword Clorinde mentioned last night. I found it!
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Huh, I'm surprised you managed to track it down after all this time.
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, I made sure to take good care of it! Considering the... circumstances in which you gave it to me, of course I had to keep it safe.
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Anyway, where were we? Oh, right, I was just thinking about all the potential ways for us to break out of prison! We could dig a tunnel, or try to bribe the guards...?
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...Wait, we haven't been thrown into prison yet, have we?
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, it's only a matter of time! It pays to be prepared, just like how you should always have an umbrella on hand, even when it's sunny.
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright! Paimon's made up her mind. Let's just give the treasure away!
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon may have wanted to keep it, but if that's going to land us in prison somehow, Paimon will be too upset to enjoy her snacks.
:{{DIcon}} Turns out Paimon cares more about snacks than treasure.
:{{DIcon}} Paimon's developing as a character!
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 clorinde 06.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' So, you've reached an agreement? Alright then, we can continue with the story.
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, and we'll collect all the scattered pieces of treasure on the ground as well!
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 clorinde 07.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Alright.
:{{A|vo cllq003 2 clorinde 08.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' You collect the treasure and make your way back to the capital with your bag of loot in hand.
<!-- special screen transition -->
----
:{{A|vo cllq003 3 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' The city is still shrouded in a gloomy, oppressive atmosphere, but your spirits are surprisingly high.
:{{A|vo cllq003 3 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' In places where sunlight struggles to reach, you generously share your wealth with the children, the elderly, and the poor in urgent need of help.
:{{A|vo cllq003 3 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Hunchbacked Old Lady:''' Thank you, kind soul...
:{{A|vo cllq003 3 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' The elderly woman's look of gratitude follows you as you walk away, her eyes never leaving your back until you move entirely out of sight. However, there's still quite a bit of Mora remaining. It appears you haven't made much progress.
:{{A|vo cllq003 3 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (She's probably trying to tell us to speed this up. We need to hurry up so we can address the sorcerer problem...)
:{{A|vo cllq003 3 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Should we go find that man again at the square? He seemed like a pretty responsible guy. I'm sure he knows the people here far better than us.
:{{A|vo cllq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, good idea!
:{{A|vo cllq003 3 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' Just as you start to make way to the square, intent on finding the man again, there's a voice...
:{{A|vo cllq003 3 clorinde 06.ogg}} '''Serious Guard:''' Please wait, distinguished guests.
:{{A|vo cllq003 3 clorinde 07.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' Several strange guards suddenly call out to you. They run forward to meet you and proceed to politely pay their respects.
:{{A|vo cllq003 3 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Greetings, gentlemen! Are we being invited for afternoon tea?
:{{A|vo cllq003 3 clorinde 08.ogg}} '''Serious Guard:''' Surely, you jest, my lady. That would not be our place. It is His Excellency the king, who requests to meet with you. Please come with us.
<!-- special screen transition -->
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Hmm... Do you think this could be a trap?
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Well, we have to investigate the court at some point, right? Meeting the king himself would be a fantastic opportunity to do that.
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I say we go for it! If something happens, we'll just turn the whole place upside down!
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uh, that sounds a little intense...
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' After a quick discussion, you nod to the guards and agree to follow. They lead you all the way to the audience hall of the palace.
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' Gilded tables line both sides of the hall. The space itself is adorned with all manner of expensive antiques, glass shelves, and silver candlesticks. The items appear quite ordinary in size and dimension, yet their presence somehow makes the emptiness of the hall feel even more surreal and ominous.
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow... It's so luxurious!
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' The elderly king, clad in a magnificent robe sits upon the deep crimson throne before you.
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' He wears above his head a majestic crown, with a gemstone the size of a bird's egg set right at the very front. As you observe it, you see a complex pattern of light reflect off its surface.
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''???:''' They're here, your majesty.
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 clorinde 06.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' A man dressed in dark clothes, likely a minister, shields his mouth with his hands and bends down to whisper a few words to the king.
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 clorinde 07.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' After a moment, he lowers his hands and stands back up. His gaze shifts to fixate on your group, but he does not move from his place at the king's side.
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (The king does not appear entirely aware of his surroundings. The man by his side, though... We should keep a close eye on him.)
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 clorinde 08.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' The king remains still, and says nothing. The Minister is the one who speaks.
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 clorinde 09.ogg}} '''Prime Minister:''' Esteemed guests, allow me to thank you for coming to our faraway kingdom. Unfortunately, His majesty the king finds himself quite exhausted from work, so please allow me, his prime minister, to welcome you in his stead.
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 clorinde 10.ogg}} '''Prime Minister:''' I've heard tell that your group, the [[Marechaussee Phantom|Marechausee Hunters]], used your exceptional ability with the sword to repel the monsters near the capital. Such a great deed deserves to be rewarded.
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 clorinde 11.ogg}} '''Prime Minister:''' However, seeing that I was not fortunate enough to observe such a feat with my own eyes, you'll forgive me for seeking to verify the truth by speaking to you myself...
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, we've got nothing to hide! You brought us here to talk, right? So, we'll just explain what happened.
:{{Color|menu|Paimon delivers a vivid account of your epic battle...}}
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...The golems' blades were so powerful, they could cut down trees in a single swipe! It took a lot of effort to defeat them, even for trained swordsmen like us!
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, that was enough details, right? Believe us, now?
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 clorinde 12.ogg}} '''Prime Minister:''' Hmm... Your account does indeed match those of the survivors. Since you were the ones who defeated the monsters, that must mean... You are also in possession of the treasure they stole?
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, we did take the treasure, but...
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (How did he know about the treasure?)
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 clorinde 13.ogg}} '''Prime Minister:''' Ah, then I must ask that you return it at once. It belongs to the kingdom.
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Wait, but didn't you just say that our great deed deserved a reward? Shouldn't the treasure be considered a part of that?
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 clorinde 14.ogg}} '''Prime Minister:''' Hehe... Yes, yes. That was indeed what I said, but you seem to have forgotten a very important distinction.
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 clorinde 15.ogg}} '''Prime Minister:''' Only that which is freely given by the king can be considered a reward. Taking the rightful wealth of a kingdom without said permission, on the other hand... is a crime.
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But that's completely unreasonable!
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, that makes no sense! If it weren't for us, the treasure would still be buried underground somewhere!
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 clorinde 16.ogg}} '''Prime Minister:''' Maybe so, yet the fact remains... You tried to dispose of the treasure without reporting it to the court and without receiving permission, yes?
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Um...
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 clorinde 17.ogg}} '''Prime Minister:''' What, no answer? Surely you're not insinuating that you, a group of legendary Marechaussee Hunters, sought to take the treasure for yourselves?
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Argh, well, what about the king? Is he just going to let this guy talk for him for the whole time?
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 clorinde 18.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' Clad in his magnificent robe, the king remains seated with his hands resting on either side of the throne, his posture rigid and unmoving. He stares forward with an empty look in his eyes, completely unmoved by the events before him.
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (From the look of things... could the Prime Minister be the evil sorcerer? Or... could both the king and the Prime Minister have fallen under the evil sorcerer's control?)
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I would like to observe the number of guards stationed in the hall.
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 clorinde 19.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' The guards in the palace appear fully armed, their expressions solemn. Sensing the tense atmosphere in the room, they stand at the ready, each with a hand placed upon the hilt of their sword, as if prepared to draw their weapons and surround you at a moment's notice.
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' There goes my plan to turn the whole place upside down, I guess.
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 clorinde 20.ogg}} '''Prime Minister:''' It appears we've been visited by nothing more than a group of ill-intentioned imposters... What a pity. Guards, take them away, and throw them in the dungeons.
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 clorinde 21.ogg}} '''Prime Minister:''' Before I decide your fate, however, I must first determine whether you have any accomplices outside the court...
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Can't we try to slip away? Or maybe start some kind of riot?
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But if we try to fight the guards right now...
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Don't worry, at least we've figured out who's behind all this. Let's just play it by ear. If you're scared, Paimon, just hold my hand.
:{{DIcon}} You can have my hand, too.
:{{A|vo cllq003 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aww, thanks you guys...
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' You allow yourself to be led away by guards surrounding you on both sides.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' It's only when you begin to feel drops of water falling from the dungeon ceiling, and smell the stench of death and decay all around you, that you finally realize you've stepped into a completely different world.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Serious Guard:''' Stay here, and don't try anything funny.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' The guards lock the cell door and leave without looking back.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Wait, sir!
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' Your voice echoes through the dark hall, but the only response you receive is the sound of water dripping from the ceiling.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Noooo... What should we do now...
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Carve out a new path of fate with our own two hands, of course! I draw my weapon!
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 06.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' You reach toward your waist, but find nothing there. You now recall that your weapons were confiscated before the guards locked you in the cell... the bag of treasure along with them.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' What about that knife I hid in my boot?
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 07.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' ...When did you hide it in there?
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' When I was thinking about digging a tunnel!
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 08.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' Rejected. You failed to inform the GM of this course of action. Moreover, the guards would have conducted a thorough search before throwing you in prison.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' And the keys to the cell aren't anywhere to be seen?
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 09.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' Correct. You don't even feel a lock hole on the cell door.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Well, there goes all our plans...
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 10.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Indeed.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!? Why are you the one saying "indeed"?
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 11.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Because that statement holds true for me as well. This is where the script ends.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What!? But that's a terrible ending!
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 12.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Hmm... Generally speaking, this should be the point where the script writer gives the players some kind of hint, or gives the GM some kind of code for how to move forward.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' I mean, maybe they just really wanted us to be immersed in the feeling of being in prison? Like, they'll only show us the way out once we've grown truly and utterly desperate?
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 13.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' That is a possibility.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If only there were desserts and tea in real prison... Oh, wait, guess that's kind of how the Fortress of Meropide works if you're lucky.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh, before I forget... [[Navia]], the short sword you had with you earlier...
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I took a closer look, and the craftsmanship doesn't appear to resemble anything from this era. If I remember correctly, that style was last in vogue several hundred years ago.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Wait, Clorinde said that sword used to belong to her master, right? Does that mean... her master has been alive that long?
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 14.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I doubt it. The way she went about things often made her seem childish more than anything. I'd say the sword was most likely an heirloom passed down over time.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Hang on, a precious heirloom passed down to you by your master, and you gave it to me just like that? You weren't worried I might lose it?
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 15.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Master left many things to me when she disappeared. There was the sword, an old key, and... a good amount of junk she probably just didn't want to take with her.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 16.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I gave you the sword back then... because I didn't want our friendship to end.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Wait, when did this happen exactly?
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 17.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' ...After the duel between Mr. [[Callas]] and myself.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 together 01.ogg}} '''Crowd:''' ...
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Before that, Clorinde would have meals with us and even stay over at the [[Spina di Rosula|Spina]] some days. She was on great terms with Papa as well.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' After the duel, though... There was a period of time where we simply didn't know how to face each other. She entrusted this sword to me, and never came back.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 18.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' ...
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 navia 09.ogg}} '''Navia:''' We were both sad, and conflicted, and totally overthinking everything as a result, haha.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 navia 10.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Whenever I looked at this sword, I couldn't help but wonder... If Ms. [[Petronilla]] had never introduced us to each other at that picnic, maybe part of the sadness I was feeling could have been avoided.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 navia 11.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...Back then, it felt like I hadn't just lost a father, but a close friend as well.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' No one can change the past. The most important thing is that you two found your way back to each other and can enjoy things like this together.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 navia 12.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...Yep, you're right!
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I'm sorry, you two. I didn't mean to bring up any sad memories...
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 navia 13.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Think nothing of it. No one here is at fault.
:{{Color|menu|At that moment, you hear a "plop" sound coming from outside the door.}}

:{{A|vo cllq003 5 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (Phew... Perfect timing. The situation was really starting to get desperate... and not just because of the prison thing...)
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' From Clorinde's face, Paimon really can't tell if it's good news or bad news...
:{{DIcon}} It speaks to her professionalism as a senior GM.
:{{DIcon}} Maintaining a poker face takes true skill.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 21.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' ...
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 22.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' Water continues to drip from the ceiling. In this lightless dungeon, you lack a reliable way to tell how much time has passed.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 23.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' Eventually, you get used to the unpleasant odor of straw, mold, and rust, and find yourselves alternating between fits of drowsiness and despair...
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 clorinde 24.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' Suddenly, you hear footsteps outside the door.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Heads up, everyone. Someone's coming.
:{{A|vo cllq003 5 florian 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Gather close, everyone, and keep your voice down.

;(Approach the group)
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Who are you?
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 florian 01.ogg}} '''"Guard":''' I work as a guard in these dungeons, but my true identity is the same as your own &mdash; I'm also a Marechaussee Hunter.
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Eh...!
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 florian 02.ogg}} '''"Guard":''' Shh! I've already sent away the other guards, but if we make too much noise...
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I understand. But, how can we be sure we can trust you?
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 florian 03.ogg}} '''"Guard":''' The king has issued a formal decree. In light of the irrefutable proof of your crime, you're to be executed before tomorrow's sunrise. If you want to escape, it has to be now.
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Executed...? We barely did anything!
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Monsters appearing at the same location as the treasure... Could this entire thing have been a trap?
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 florian 04.ogg}} '''"Guard":''' There will be time for speculation once we're out of here... As for my identity, I have no way to prove that to you just yet.
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 florian 05.ogg}} '''"Guard":''' Infiltrating the capital was difficult, and finding a chance to speak with you has taken a lot out of me... I could go on, but I think we can all agree that now is not the time for details.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Well, it doesn't look like we have any other choice.)
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Have you seen our weapons anywhere, sir?
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 florian 06.ogg}} '''"Guard":''' Don't worry, I brought them with me. They're just behind the door. Still, these weapons alone won't be enough to defeat the true enemy behind the scenes.
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 florian 07.ogg}} '''"Guard":''' His faction is too powerful. The guards are all under his control, and he's even stationed a number of golems in various rooms throughout the palace.
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 florian 08.ogg}} '''"Guard":''' To defeat him, you must find a secret vault. It is said that, within that vault, the Marechaussee Hunters of the past left behind a treasure with the power to defeat the sorcerer.
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' You're not coming with us?
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 florian 09.ogg}} '''"Guard":''' No, I'll remain in the dungeons to deal with the guards. I'll try my best to distract them so they don't go after you.
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 florian 10.ogg}} '''"Guard":''' As long as my identity is not revealed, I'll be able to aid you when the final battle comes.
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' In that case, please stay safe.
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 florian 11.ogg}} '''"Guard":''' Thank you for your concern. I will do my utmost.
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 florian 12.ogg}} '''"Guard":''' As for the location of the vault... Here. This map should lead you there.

:{{A|vo cllq003 6 florian 13.ogg}} '''"Guard":''' Alright, once I open the door, remember to stick close and refrain from making any noise. I'll lead you out of here as quickly as possible.
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 florian 14.ogg}} '''"Guard":''' You now have the chance to restore the honor and legacy of the Marechaussee Hunters. So, please, get out there and reclaim what's ours!
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 florian 15.ogg}} '''"Guard":''' And... Be sure to exercise caution.
:{{A|vo cllq003 6 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' With the help of the guard, you successfully escape the dungeons. Your sense of despair and anxiety both seem to fade as you continue your quest.

:{{A|vo cllq003 8 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' Before you lies a serene stretch of open water, its surface shimmering a brilliant shade of sapphire blue.
:{{A|vo cllq003 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, guess this means it's time for a swim!

;(Approach the marker after leaving the water)

:{{A|vo cllq003 9 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' What's the matter?
:{{A|vo cllq003 9 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' ...It's nothing.
:{{A|vo cllq003 9 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' As you step into the cave, you find yourself in an eerily quiet space. Before you lies a narrow passageway that appears to trail off endlessly into the distance.

;(Approach the mechanism)
:{{A|vo cllq003 10 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, this must be where the treasure is hidden!
:{{A|vo cllq003 10 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' But, this door is blocking our way in... Huh, it almost looks like it's been here for quite some time. I've got to hand it to the Tabletop Troupe. They really went all-out with the props...
:{{A|vo cllq003 10 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Hmm...?
:{{A|vo cllq003 10 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Huh? What have we got down here... A kind of mechanism connected to the door? It looks like we might have to arrange it into a certain pattern...
:{{A|vo cllq003 10 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' (A pattern on a stone door... That's something Master mentioned before...)
:{{A|vo cllq003 10 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Huh? Something wrong, Clorinde?
:{{A|vo cllq003 10 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' ...After a long, difficult journey, you finally arrive at the location indicated by your map. It appears to be an ancient site of some sort, where treasure likely awaits.
:{{A|vo cllq003 10 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' Your surroundings are exceedingly quiet and serene, as if the secret that slumbers here has never once been disturbed. If you listen closely, you can almost convince yourself you can hear the sound of its calm, gentle breathing.
:{{A|vo cllq003 10 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aww... That description makes Paimon feel kinda bad for disturbing this place.
:{{A|vo cllq003 10 lyney 01.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' We're doing this for the sake of the people, to free them from the evil sorcerer. I say it's time for this treasure to once again see the light of day.
:{{A|vo cllq003 10 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Lyney's right. We need to keep going. The future of the kingdom depends on it.
:{{A|vo cllq003 10 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' The next part of the story requires us to solve the puzzle, right? Let's start exploring the area.
:{{A|vo cllq003 10 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' ...Yes. That should be fine.
:{{A|vo cllq003 10 clorinde 06.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' ...

:{{A|vo cllq003 12 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' ...
:{{A|vo cllq003 12 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' (This is... one of the Marechaussee Hunter keys that are passed down from generation to generation... It looks just like the one Master passed down to me.)
:{{A|vo cllq003 12 clorinde 06.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' (It is said that four keys in total are required to form the final, complete key. And it seems like... we just collected three of them. That must mean...)

:{{A|vo cllq003 12 clorinde 09.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' For the sake of immersion, please close your eyes, everyone. Without the torches, the space is now completely dark, and you cannot see anything.

:{{A|vo cllq003 12 florian 01.ogg}} '''???:''' ...Tch. I've been discovered, then?
:{{A|vo cllq003 12 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Wait! That voice, it's...
:{{A|vo cllq003 12 clorinde 11.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' You recognize the voice as belonging to the "guard" who led you to this place. It appears he now covets the treasure for himself, and has come to stake his claim...
:{{A|vo cllq003 12 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (Oh, so this is just part of the script... Phew... Then I can probably relax.)
:{{A|vo cllq003 12 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Well, if we can't see anything, that means we can't fight to the fullest of our abilities. Should we... retreat for now?
:{{A|vo cllq003 12 clorinde 12.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' (Judging by the way he's holding his sword... He must be a real Marechaussee Hunter. But, this isn't part of the script.)

:{{A|vo cllq003 14 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Ah, ahem...! Speak your name, guard. Why did you lead us here just to betray us?
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' ...Is this treasure really more important to you than bringing peace to the kingdom?
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 florian 02.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Tch... What kingdom? What peace? Those were nothing but lies!
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 florian 03.ogg}} '''Florian:''' I, Florian, am a true Marechaussee Hunter, descended from Hunters of ages past.
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (So, he's also using his real name... Or wait, was that the name of his character from the very beginning...?)
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Then, I'm even more confused. If you truly are a Marechaussee Hunter, shouldn't you want to help us, just like you said before? Shouldn't we fight together for the sake of the people?
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 florian 04.ogg}} '''Florian:''' What do you know? In this day and age... There's no glory to be had as a Marechaussee Hunter.
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' What's that supposed to mean?
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 florian 05.ogg}} '''Florian:''' My skills were passed down to me by my father. We lived a life of obscurity in the remote wilderness. Still, he devoted everything he had to being a Marechaussee Hunter.
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 florian 06.ogg}} '''Florian:''' And what did he get in return? A life of poverty and pain... and a world that forgot all about him. When he died, not a single person came to mourn his passing!
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 florian 07.ogg}} '''Florian:''' The Marechaussee Hunters were the ones who saved this {{Rubi|city|Fontaine}}! We're heroes! We deserve more recognition and respect than this!
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (Is he talking about how no one in the capital seems to remember the Hunters and their legacy? I didn't expect the script to contain this level of social criticism...)
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, that's why you want to take the treasure for yourself? You feel like you're owed fame and wealth?
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' If you already knew where the treasure was located, why didn't you just come down here and take it?
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 florian 08.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Because... I still needed the final key...
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 clorinde 07.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' Ahem! Only a true Marechaussee Hunter is capable of passing through this final door.
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 clorinde 08.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' As someone who sought to hurt others for his own gain, Florian lost that right long ago.
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Okay, but what is this treasure, anyway? We've got all the keys, right? So, can we just go in and take a look?
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 clorinde 09.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' You're sure you want to go in?
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We've been talking about it for so long... Of course we want to see what's inside!
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' And we've already defeated Florian, right? So, he won't try to take it from us anymore.

:{{A|vo cllq003 14 clorinde 10.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' (Watch yourself...)

:{{A|vo cllq003 14 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Maybe the Troupe ran out of budget at the end?
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' They provided a super immersive experience at the beginning, only to drop the ball at the most important part... They could have at least filled this place with cardboard Mora or something!
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...Wait, I get it now! Paimon, this is the real Marechaussee Hunter "treasure"!
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 florian 10.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Th&mdash;This is it? The Marechaussee Hunter treasure is just a stone slab and some broken swords? I can't believe it... I refuse to believe it!!
:{{A|vo cllq003 14 florian 11.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Argh! Argh... Ahhhh!<!-- Devorator leaves Florian's body -->

:{{A|vo cllq003 14 clorinde 17.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' One of you seems to understand the significance of the treasure already. If the rest of you wish to follow suit, you may remain here in the meantime and explore your surroundings.

;(Observe Stone Tablet, optional)
:'''Observe Stone Tablet:''' A stone tablet that stands there quietly. A few peoples' names and deeds have been inscribed upon it.

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' ...So, how are you doing? Feeling any better?
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 01.ogg}} '''Florian:''' I... What just happened...?
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Do you remember how you got here? Or what happened to your body just now?
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 02.ogg}} '''Florian:''' I... I remember now... I brought you here... Because I wanted to... Ah! The explosives in the cave...!
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' You mean these?
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 03.ogg}} '''Florian:''' ...Huh? How did you...
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I could tell something was off the moment I stepped into this cave, so I kept an eye out. I've already dismantled the whole thing.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 04.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Hah, so the strongest [[Champion Duelist]] in all of Fontaine saved the day once again... Guess I shouldn't be surprised. It would seem your skills as a Marechaussee Hunter are as sharp as ever...
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I deserve some answers, don't you think? Tell me why you wanted to lure me here.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 06.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Everything you said earlier sounded like the truth. Luckily, your monologue was dramatic enough to convince my friends you were just roleplaying.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 05.ogg}} '''Florian:''' I... I don't know... I just always felt like there was something in my heart that didn't belong to me... something agitated and angry... Tch, who knows, maybe it was my own anger all along... I could never really tell.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 06.ogg}} '''Florian:''' The feelings about my father and the other Marechaussee Hunters are real. It just wasn't fair. I was angry... bitter that no one remembered them, or praised their accomplishments.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 07.ogg}} '''Florian:''' I don't know when it started, but at some point, my anger came to completely consume me. At that point, I remembered the legend my father used to tell me, the one about the treasure...
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 07.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' But if the treasure was all you cared about, why plant all those explosives? Wouldn't they just destroy the treasure, and bury you along with it?
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 08.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Ah... I can't remember. My head is a mess... It felt like... there was this voice telling me to "eliminate the Hunters," but now, it's gone...
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 08.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' ...From your description, I suspect you were dealing with a "Devorator."
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 09.ogg}} '''Florian:''' ...A "Devorator"?
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 09.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Oh, your Master... Ahem, your father, I mean, never talked about it? It was a kind of monster that was active several centuries ago.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 10.ogg}} '''Florian:''' No, I've heard of it, I'm just not sure why you suddenly...
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 11.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Wait, it can't be... The seal!
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 10.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' The seal?
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 12.ogg}} '''Florian:''' My family... has served as Marechaussee Hunters for many generations. But the title and swordsmanship weren't the only things passed down over our line. There was a seal as well.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 13.ogg}} '''Florian:''' My father instructed me to always watch over that seal and maintain it regularly. He said it had been passed down from a truly ancient age, and protecting it was our clan's most important duty.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 14.ogg}} '''Florian:''' But, I neglected that duty after he died... I finally decided to come down and check on it one day, and that's where my memories become fuzzy...
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 11.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' The Devorator would be a formidable adversary for any mortal being, even ones as capable as the Hunters.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 12.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' If you lacked the power to completely destroy it, you could easily fall prey to its influence and corruption. In light of this, some Marechaussee Hunters chose to seal the Devorator away in the hopes that a permanent solution would come with the passage of time.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 15.ogg}} '''Florian:''' I heard it has the power to amplify the obsessions and desires in people's hearts, to the point where they overtake you entirely... Hah, it would seem I'm not just lacking in skill with a blade, but in mental fortitude as well...
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 13.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' And yet, you were able to retrieve three of the four keys... If I remember correctly, each was entrusted to a respected and capable Hunter... How did you manage it?
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 16.ogg}} '''Florian:''' ...One of them belonged to my father. The second I stole from a different Hunter... And the third, *sigh*... was one that I snatched while the person was on the way home from the tavern. I nearly died in that alley...
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 14.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' ...
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 17.ogg}} '''Florian:''' I know just how strong you are &mdash; it's as clear as day to everyone in Fontaine. I observed you from dusk to dawn, but could never find any opportunity to sneak up on you... I never even saw you drink a single glass of liquor...
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 18.ogg}} '''Florian:''' The only way I could think to obtain that last key... was to lure you here using your hobby, and then... Ah, I get it now... That monster... It wanted to bury you here alongside the treasure...
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 15.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' ...I won't comment on anything else, but the script was good.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 19.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Hah... Well, I did pour my heart and soul into it...
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 20.ogg}} '''Florian:''' The stories my father used to tell me... about the glory of the heroic Marechaussee Hunters... and how they came to be forgotten...
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 16.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' It's more than just a story.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 21.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 17.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' You're proud to be a Hunter. You're still holding on to that part of yourself, no matter how small.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 22.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Hah, I've done so many despicable things... I have nothing to be proud of...
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 18.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Then explain the purpose of the "evil sorcerer" in your story.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 23.ogg}} '''Florian:''' ...!
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 19.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Isn't he the true antagonist? The one who sought nothing but his own gain and used the people as pawns to attain it... In your heart of hearts, he was the one you truly wanted to defeat.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 24.ogg}} '''Florian:''' B&mdash;But I've already tainted my sword. I no longer have any right to...
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 20.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Wake up, Florian! Remember how you introduced yourself earlier.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 21.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Do you really think the Hunters acted out of a desire for honor and glory, or to be loved and acknowledged by the people? What did your Father teach you about our order?
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 25.ogg}} '''Florian:''' ...
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 22.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' You do not wield your sword for yourself, but to protect those you serve. There's nothing special about a blade. It's the intentions of the wielder that matter above all else.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 23.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Do you still not understand? Even after seeing the "treasure" for yourself? The contents of that room... they represent the true legacy the Hunters left behind.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 26.ogg}} '''Florian:''' ...You're right. I... I am a Marechaussee Hunter. It's time for me to redeem &mdash; no, to finally serve the people I vowed to protect all along.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 24.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I wouldn't be so quick to push aside the need for redemption.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 27.ogg}} '''Florian:''' ...I know. That's a charge I won't bother to defend myself against.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 25.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Good. Then come with me, and help me see this script through to the end.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 28.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Huh? See the script through to the end? But... But there's no more script left.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 26.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Never finished it, huh?
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 29.ogg}} '''Florian:''' No, I mean... I wrote the script with the sole purpose of luring you all here. There was no reason to write beyond this point...
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 27.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Then we'll just have to keep writing it. The evil sorcerer still needs to be defeated.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 30.ogg}} '''Florian:''' You mean... the Devorator? Uh... Are you saying I have to make up the rest of the script as we go along?
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 28.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Is that really so hard? You've already written most of it. Surely you can write an ending where the Hunters win and justice prevails? I'll be there to help you, too.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 31.ogg}} '''Florian:''' ...You aren't afraid your party will fall into danger?
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 29.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' I know what my friends are capable of, and they're all quite skilled. Besides, I need their help.
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 florian 32.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Then... are you going to tell them the truth about all this?
:{{A|vo cllq003 16 clorinde 30.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' Ah, I don't intend to spoil the fun. Sometimes, protecting dreams and fantasies is more important than exposing the truth, don't you think?

:{{A|vo cllq003 17 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That took a while.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 clorinde 01.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' ...Ahem.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 01.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Oh, uh...
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 02.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Ahem! My fellow Marechaussee Hunters, please forgive me, for I have sinned...
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 clorinde 02.ogg}} '''Clorinde:''' (Tone it down...)
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 03.ogg}} '''Florian:''' (S&mdash;Sorry...)
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 04.ogg}} '''Florian:''' After crossing swords with you and witnessing your courage in battle, I have rediscovered my true self and regained my pride as a Marechaussee Hunter.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 furina 01.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (Oh! Do I smell a redemption arc?)
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 05.ogg}} '''Florian:''' I confess... I was brainwashed by the evil sorcerer. He asked me to lure you here so he could bury you in this cave...
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That little... Wait... You're saying all of that wasn't you, but the evil sorcerer?
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 06.ogg}} '''Florian:''' That's right. He's adept at manipulating the hearts and minds of the people... I fell under his influence because I did not possess a strong enough sense of will.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmph! And how are you going to prove that you're a changed man? We're not going to fall for the same trap twice!
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 07.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Um...
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 08.ogg}} '''Florian:''' To be perfectly honest, I only came to my senses after seeing the "treasure." It reminded me of my father's past teachings.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 09.ogg}} '''Florian:''' The "treasure" was actually...
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 navia 01.ogg}} '''Navia:''' The names of all the Marechaussee Hunters from ages past and their weapons?
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 10.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Wait, you... already know?
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 navia 02.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Of course! Don't underestimate a veteran roleplayer's exploration skills! Wait, I mean, Marechaussee Hunter Navia's exploration skills!
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 lyney 02.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' We just finished reading through the content of the stone tablet.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 furina 02.ogg}} '''Furina:''' That tablet recorded the lives of some fascinating people. For example, this Marechaussee Hunter called "[[Este (Marechaussee Hunter)|Este]]"...
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 furina 03.ogg}} '''Furina:''' She inherited the responsibilities of the [[Golden Hunter]] and passed judgment on many people. But, in private, she had a very easygoing personality. Her favorite pastime was singing and dancing with her friends, and she was said to have a beautiful voice.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 navia 03.ogg}} '''Navia:''' So she was just like you!
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 furina 04.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Oh, you really think so...?
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 lyney 03.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Well... when you put it that way, I suppose I also have a few things in common with this "Walter."
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 lyney 04.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Working as an executioner, he supposedly used a countless number of tricks to confound his enemies in battle. If only I could've seen the feats of magic he pulled off back then...
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Their lives were all so exciting! You could write so many cool books about their accomplishments. How could they have all been forgotten?
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 11.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Because... they chose to be.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 12.ogg}} '''Florian:''' To hunt monsters that only appear in the shadows, you must also operate in the dark. To be a Marechaussee Hunter is to willingly give up on wealth and fame.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 navia 04.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Then this stone tablet must have been left behind by their companions.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 13.ogg}} '''Florian:''' That's right. Few Marechaussee Hunters ever revealed their identity to the public. They always protected the {{Rubi|city|Fontaine}} from the shadows.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 14.ogg}} '''Florian:''' The only time they spoke of their accomplishments would be at night, when they gathered with their fellow Hunters in front of the bonfire to share stories of the monsters slain by their hand.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 furina 05.ogg}} '''Furina:''' So... this tablet was created not so that the Hunters would be remembered by the people, but so that they would be remembered by each other.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No wonder this place was so well-hidden...
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 clorinde 03.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' You regard the stone tablet in solemn silence. The names of your comrades etched onto its surface serve as a reminder that you are never truly alone.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 clorinde 04.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' The tablet proves that, although a Hunter walks a shrouded path, it is not a solitary one. There will always be those who walk beside you, a fact that remains as true today as in ages long past.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 clorinde 05.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' Their legacies shall continue to be passed down from generation to generation, as everlasting as the stone onto which their names are carved.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 15.ogg}} '''Florian:''' (Father... You once told me that I should seek out the "treasure" if I ever became lost. So this is what you wanted me to find...)
:{{DIcon}} I've decided to trust you, Florian.
::{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 16a 1.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Thank you, my friend... You are very kind.
;(Available if the player chose "Insight" as a skill)
:{{DIcon}} I'd like to do an insight check on him.
::{{A|vo cllq003 17 clorinde 06b 1.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' His eyes are sincere, and his words ring true. You can tell that every word he spoke just now came from the bottom of his heart.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 17.ogg}} '''Florian:''' I implore you, everyone, please give me a chance to make up for all I've done. Allow me to fight alongside you, and defeat the evil {{Rubi|sorcerer|Devorator}} that threatens the peace and prosperity of all the people in this {{Rubi|kingdom|basement}}.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 navia 05.ogg}} '''Navia:''' Well, I say we let you join!
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 furina 06.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Sounds good to me, too. Everyone makes mistakes. What matters is what you do to make up for them.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 lyney 05.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I have no objections, but... Mr. Florian, do you even know how to defeat the evil sorcerer?
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 18.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Hmm... When he took over my mind, I gained some insight into his thoughts. Every time I thought of the treasure... he reacted with a strong sense of fear.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? He's... afraid of the treasure? But there's nothing here except some broken weapons and the stone tablet...
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 navia 06.ogg}} '''Navia:''' What if... The secret's hidden inside these weapons?
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 navia 07.ogg}} '''Navia:''' GM, permission to "investigate"!<!-- "Insight" check -->
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 clorinde 07.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' At first glance, the weapons appear absolutely ordinary, but as you observe them, you notice a faint energy emanating from within.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 clorinde 08.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' These blades have slain countless monsters. Though it's been a long time since they were used in battle, their edges remain sharp, as if they're simply waiting for the next worthy Hunter to carry on their legacy.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 lyney 06.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' (So, basically, take these with us, right?)
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 furina 07.ogg}} '''Furina:''' I'll take this weapon... Since it used to belong to Este. Maybe it'll find comfort in being held by someone who appreciates the arts.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 lyney 07.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Ah, good idea. I'll take Mr. Walter's bow, then. From one archer magician to another!
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 navia 08.ogg}} '''Navia:''' ...
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's gonna pick a cool weapon, too!
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 clorinde 09.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' As you grip your weapons, you can almost feel the will of past Hunters coursing through your being. It's a feeling of courage, determination... a silent vow passed down from generation to generation that says, eradicate the monsters no matter the cost.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 lyney 08.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Mr. Florian, do you know where to find the evil sorcerer?
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 19.ogg}} '''Florian:''' I was able to see his surroundings when our minds were connected. I believe he's currently hiding out at the {{Rubi|church|basement}} in the {{Rubi|kingdom|my house}}.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 20.ogg}} '''Florian:''' We must be extremely careful. He's spent so long living among monsters that he has now taken the form of one. He will not be easily defeated.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Then why don't we explore some more and try to find some higher-level gear? We don't want to just fight him and lose, right?
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 21.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Oh, um...
:{{Color|menu|Florian glances at Clorinde, who shakes her head.}}
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 22.ogg}} '''Florian:''' No, we have to strike now! He was greatly weakened when I managed to break out of his control. If we let him rest, he might have time to escape.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 lyney 09.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' I agree with Mr. Florian. We've got to act while we have the advantage. Don't forget &mdash; the people of the capital are counting on us.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 furina 08.ogg}} '''Furina:''' Yeah, now that we've got a plan, there's no point in waiting. The longer this drags on, the worse it will be for everybody.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 23.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Yes, yes! That's what's called...
:{{DIcon}} Taking the initiative.
:{{DIcon}} Catching your enemy off-guard!
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 24.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Yes... That's exactly right!
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright, you've "persuaded" Paimon.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 lyney 10.ogg}} '''Lyney:''' Mr. Florian, please lead the way.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 florian 25.ogg}} '''Florian:''' Of course. Follow me!
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 furina 09.ogg}} '''Furina:''' (He had to set up so many scenes today, and now, he has to join in for this last part... I really don't envy his job.)
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 clorinde 10.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' *laugh* Finally... you decide to slay the evil sorcerer and bring peace back to the kingdom once and for all.
:{{A|vo cllq003 17 clorinde 11.ogg}} '''Game Master:''' As you walk away, you feel the gaze of the stone tablet at your back, as if all the Hunters of the past are wishing you success in the battle ahead and awaiting your triumphant return.
