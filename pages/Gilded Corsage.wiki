{{Description|A mantle brooch that has lost its luster. The gold plating that once adorned it was ground away by the wind and the waves long ago.}}
'''Gilded Corsage''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Heart of Depth]].

==Description==
A corsage whose coloration has been blistered away by the sea-salt wind.<br>Even a man who wanders the ocean waves,<br>Has items and memories that he prizes.

The great warship raised its anchor and headed out to sea, and the [[Parsifal|Chief Mate]] once more left harbor with the [[Skipper]].<br>For the Skipper's absurd pursuit, and for his own faded memories,<br>The Chief Mate hummed a crappy shanty of his own composing, forming a chorus with the whales and the waves.

"The [[Parsifal|scoundrel]] who gave up his family name and the [[Blue-Eyed Spear Witch|witch]] who hunted him (never) reached the sea!"<br>"The wise [[Eberhart|step-brother]] who could not be an heir became head at last (or did he?)"

"Words that cannot be sung... Have I also forsaken the truth for illusions?"<br>"Having lost it all, and given it all up, and then sinking beneath the waves..."<br>"...Maybe this isn't the worst of endings, after all. Hahahahaha!"
