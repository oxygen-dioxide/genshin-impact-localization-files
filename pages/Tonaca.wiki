:'''Tonaca:''' Maybe that's what I should do! Or... maybe that's all I can do? Huh? Oh, sorry, I drifted off there. Hello friend, what can I help you with?
:{{DIcon|Reputation}} About my reputation with the Collective of Plenty...
::'''Tonaca:''' Ah, so you're a friend, coming to help us out! Hehe, thanks for your kindness. Naturally, we'll make sure you're compensated fairly.

::'''Tonaca:''' Me? Hehe, I'm the three-time wrestling cha... Wait, no, that's not right... Today's a workday. Uhm, I'm the person in charge of coordinating tribal resources and daily affairs.
::'''Tonaca:''' If you need any help, or if you're itching to help out yourself, I'm the person you want to come to!
:{{DIcon}} Where are we?
::'''Tonaca:''' Oh, this must be your first time here! This is our tribe's pride and joy &mdash; the Grand Wrestling Grounds! And this thing behind me, that's our Obsidian Totem Pole.
::'''Tonaca:''' It's not just us tribespeople who like to watch the wrestling, hehe. The Wayob of the Night Kingdom also come to drink in the spectacle of heroes by way of this here totem pole.
::'''Tonaca:''' *sigh* All this talking's making me want to get in there and fight! If only the weekend could come sooner...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Step into the ring?
::'''Tonaca:''' Sure. I'm still a competitive wrestler, after all.
::'''Tonaca:''' I'm mostly tied up with logistics, but come the weekend, I can wrestle to my heart's content.
::'''Tonaca:''' Here at the Collective of Plenty, being the most agriculturally developed tribe in Natlan as we are, we naturally prioritize resource coordination and management above all else.
::'''Tonaca:''' My job is to ensure that everyone can eat as much as they want while ensuring that there's no waste.
::'''Tonaca:''' But that's enough of my blabbing &mdash; it's time for you to grab a bite to eat! I can see you're still a growing {{MC|m=lad|f=lass}}, so you mustn't let yourself go hungry!
::;(Obtain {{Item|Delicious Chocolate|x=3}})
