{{Dialogue End}}

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Asenath:''' Hehe... Animal noggins are so adorable...
:{{DIcon}} Looking for desert foxes?
:'''Asenath:''' Ah, hello there. Judging by your attire, you must be the [[Traveler]], yes?
:'''Asenath:''' Hehe, of course I know you! You're a real celebrity &mdash; everyone's heard at least a little about you.
:'''Asenath:''' Your friends, Mr. [[Cyno]] and Mr. [[Tighnari]], are really famous themselves.
:'''Asenath:''' I was just looking for a way to see Desert Foxes more often. They're so cute, I can't help wanting to see them more! If only there was some way to make them less skittish around me, so I could touch their tails and...
:{{DIcon}} I didn't know you liked them so much.
:'''Asenath:''' It's not just them &mdash; all animals fascinate me! I suppose that it's an occupational hazard, though. After all, [[King Deshret]]'s Seven Pillars are all animal-associated one way or the other, right?
:'''Asenath:''' As I read these books, I slowly developed a deep interest in animals...
:'''Asenath:''' The Goat King, Crocodile King, Ibis King... Large animals all! And their heads...
:'''Asenath:''' Yup, yup... So cute...
:'''Asenath:''' Animals just have such adorable heads!
:{{DIcon}} They all sound pretty famous.
:'''Asenath:''' That's right. The associated literature indicates that the Dragon King, the supreme spirit [[Apep]], was alone amongst the Seven Pillars in not appearing in person.
:'''Asenath:''' Of the remaining six, these were most important: The Goat King Heryshaf, Minister of Ministers, the Crocodile King Sobek, Captain of Captains, the Ibis King Thoth, Scribe of Scribes...
:'''Asenath:''' And [[Hermanubis]], greatest of sages.
:'''Asenath:''' As for the other two, Bennu Most-Radiant and Shesepankh Most-Holy, the texts claim that they refer more to "human souls" and "[[Jinni]]."
:'''Asenath:''' Speaking of Jinni, it's just a shame that I was born this late. I'd love to have seen a legendary being like that in the flesh.
:'''Asenath:''' Err, sorry, I said that out loud, didn't I?
:'''Asenath:''' I'd originally intended to just share some ancient knowledge &mdash; I've always loved these "names and titles" bridging segments in books! Especially when someone starts to rattle theirs off...
:'''Asenath:''' And the best titles are slightly on the long side.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for the lesson!
:'''Asenath:''' Oh, come now, don't say that.
:'''Asenath:''' Have you been coming around often lately? We should go see some Desert Foxes together if you've got the time &mdash; and some other animals too!
