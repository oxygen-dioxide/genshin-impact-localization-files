'''Sheer Cold''' is a gauge that appears in very cold areas, such as in [[Dragonspine]]'s [[Subzero Climate]] and during certain challenges.

==Overview==
Similar to [[Stamina]], Sheer Cold is shared between characters for each player. It appears as a gauge over the active character's HP bar. When the gauge is at least 70% full, the gauge pulses and beeps, and the player's peripheral vision is reduced. When the gauge is full, the active character [[#HP Loss|loses HP]].

Sheer Cold's accumulation and health loss from Sheer Cold may pause while the player is engaged in dialogue with an NPC or an object. They are not paused during [[Photo Mode]], during which [[time]] passes normally.

==Accumulation Rate==
{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! Conditions !! Base Rate !! Fully fills gauge in...
|-
| In a [[Subzero Climate]] || 1%/s || 100s<br>(1m 40s)
|-
| In combat against [[Narukami Island: Tenshukaku|Signora]] || 3%/s || 33s
|-
| Taking {{Color|Cryo DMG}} from Signora's weak attacks || 2%/hit || 50 hits
|-
| Taking {{Color|Cryo DMG}} from Signora's Frosted Floor || 2.5%/hit || 40 hits
|-
| Taking {{Color|Cryo DMG}} from Signora's strong attacks || 5%/hit || 20 hits
|-
| Counterstruck by Signora || 100% || &mdash;
|}

===Modifiers===
Certain statuses will boost or reduce the accumulation rate of Sheer Cold. Different modifiers stack additively. An accumulation modifier of -100% or lower prevents Sheer Cold from accumulating but does not [[#Depletion|deplete]] the gauge.

==Depletion==
===Sources of Warmth===
Sources of warmth are the primary method for depleting the Sheer Cold gauge. Standing near them provides a buff every '''0.5s''' that lasts '''1s''' and reduces the Sheer Cold gauge.

====Subzero Climate====
Sources of warmth in Subzero Climates reduce the Sheer Cold gauge at a rate of '''5%''' per '''0.2s''' ('''4''' seconds to completely deplete a full gauge). Sources of warmth in Subzero Climates include:
{{Column|2|
* Campfires
* Torches
* [[Ruin Brazier]]s
* [[Warming Seelie]]
* [[Warming Bottle]]s
* [[Statues of The Seven]]
* [[Teleport Waypoints]]
* Warming platforms in [[Peak of Vindagnyr]]
* The Dragon's Core cave in [[Wyrmrest Valley]]
* The top of the [[Skyfrost Nail]] (the object floating in the sky, not the entire subarea)
* The [[Frostbearing Tree]] (once thawed)
}}

[[Scarlet Quartz]] is not a source of warmth.

====Narukami Island: Tenshukaku====
The only sources of warmth during the [[Narukami Island: Tenshukaku]] Trounce Domain are Hearts of Flame. One is located at each corner of the room at the start of the fight. Standing near one reduces the Sheer Cold gauge at a rate of '''4%''' per '''0.2s''' ('''5''' seconds to completely deplete a full gauge). Destroying one reduces the Sheer Cold gauge by '''100%''' immediately, though the animation takes a few seconds to play.

===Scarlet Quartz===
Each [[Scarlet Quartz]] that is picked up reduces '''5%''' of the Sheer Cold gauge.

Scarlet Quartz are only available in [[Dragonspine]].

===Leaving the Area===
When players leave areas that have a Sheer Cold gauge, it reduces at a rate of '''5%''' per second ('''20''' seconds to completely deplete a full gauge).

==HP Loss==
[[HP Loss]] occurs while the Sheer Cold gauge is full. It is unaffected by the conditions that increase and decrease the Sheer Cold accumulation rate. The HP Loss only stops once the Sheer Cold gauge is no longer full.

===Subzero Climate===
The active character will lose HP at a rate of '''1% Max HP + 150 HP''' per second.<ref>NGA: [https://ngabbs.com/read.php?tid=25244647 Research on the damage of Sheer Cold] (in Chinese)</ref>

Some max HP thresholds and how long it takes for all HP to be depleted by Sheer Cold:
* 30 seconds &mdash; 6,428 HP
* 40 seconds &mdash; 10,000 HP
* 50 seconds &mdash; 15,000 HP
* 60 seconds &mdash; 22,500 HP
* 70 seconds &mdash; 35,000 HP
* 80 seconds &mdash; 60,000 HP

===Narukami Island: Tenshukaku===
The active character will lose HP at a rate of '''3% Max HP + 150 HP''' per second.

Some max HP thresholds and how long it takes for all HP to be depleted by Sheer Cold:
* 22 seconds &mdash; 10,000 HP
* 27 seconds &mdash; 22,500 HP
* 31 seconds &mdash; 60,000 HP

==Trivia==
* The frosty edges that appear when affected by Sheer Cold show up in pictures taken with the [[Kamera]] or [[Special Kamera]] but do not show up in pictures taken in [[Photo Mode]].
* When a character falls to Sheer Cold, the player will be granted the {{Achievement|The Bleak Midwinter}}.
