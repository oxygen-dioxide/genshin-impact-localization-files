;(Approach Kun Jun)
:{{A|vo zllq104 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kun Jun! We need to get going!
:{{A|vo zllq104 1 kunjun 01.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' No problem! I'm done here.
:{{A|vo zllq104 1 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Any results, Mr. Kun Jun?
:{{A|vo zllq104 1 kunjun 02.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' There are many beautiful rocks here, but nothing out of the ordinary. I couldn't find any clues.
:{{A|vo zllq104 1 kunjun 03.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Then again, the memories of ore can shift with the passage of time and the changing of the environment.
:{{DIcon}} Is there a pattern to it?
:{{A|vo zllq104 1 kunjun 04.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Hmm, difficult to say... I feel that ore memories tend to be from the recent past.
:{{A|vo zllq104 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So there's never any ancient memories?
:{{A|vo zllq104 1 kunjun 05.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Rocks endure, but as eons pass their memories are erased. Those memories that survive are rooted in powerful emotion or thought.
:{{A|vo zllq104 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That makes sense &mdash; it is the same for people!
:{{A|vo zllq104 1 kunjun 06.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Indeed... Let's keep going.

----

;(Head to the ancient tree and investigate)
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 kunjun 01.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Wow, such an immense tree!
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And there's so many mysterious-looking crystals up there too... amazing.
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' This ancient tree...
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Let's conduct separate investigations. I'll take that area, perhaps you could survey this section.
:{{DIcon}} Sure.
:{{DIcon}} Be careful.
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Alright then.
:;(Zhongli parts to investigate)
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kun Jun, can you see anything worth investigating?
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 kunjun 02.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Well... there is this stone tablet here.
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Doesn't seem very interesting... Paimon's gonna look over there.
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 kunjun 03.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Huh? It's worth a try, surely. Let me see...
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 kunjun 04.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' ...
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 kunjun 05.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' ...!
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 kunjun 06.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' (This is...)
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey! What's wrong?
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 kunjun 07.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' ...Just a bit light-headed... It's passed, nothing to worry about.
:{{DIcon}} Did you see anything?
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 kunjun 08.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Not... hmm... not yet...
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh* Whatever, Paimon's going to investigate over there. Why don't you climb the tree and have a look, (Traveler)?
:{{DIcon}} You're sure there'll be clues in the tree?
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' If you don't try you don't know! Anyway, you'll be able to get a good look at our surroundings from up there!
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 kunjun 09.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' ...
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 kunjun 10.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Oh! Uh... you think so?
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' When has Paimon ever come up with a bad idea, hmm?
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait a minute... Paimon can fly! *sigh* Alright, Paimon will go, you wait here, Paimon will&mdash;
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' All of you, come here.
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Zhongli's voice came from... behind the tree. Did he find another clue?
:{{A|vo zllq104 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Quick, let's go see! Maybe he found another miner!

;(Read the tablet)
:'''Stone Monolith:''' "Life endures in Heaven and Earth thanks to the merciful Adeptus. On this site lies an evil dragon, please do not disturb it."

;(Approach Zhongli)
:{{A|vo zllq104 3 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' This has been newly dug. It would appear our answer is up ahead.
:{{A|vo zllq104 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is that a voice coming from the tunnel? Eek! Someone else go first!
:{{A|vo zllq104 3 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Compose yourselves. I will lead us in.
:{{A|vo zllq104 3 kunjun 01.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' ...
:{{A|vo zllq104 3 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' There is an unusual presence emanating from inside the tunnel. Prepare yourselves, and tread lightly.

;(Enter the Domain at the end of the underground tunnel)
:{{Color|menu|The missing miners doggedly dig away inside the tunnel, at the end of which an ancient seal starts to come into view. The miners seem to have been somehow seduced into tunneling here... Just when you start to realize something is amiss, the miners and the rumored blue-haired child suddenly attack you. Chaos ensures, the ground begins to blow, and you are all sucked through the sealed door...}}

;(Cinematic)
:{{A|vo zllq104 cs zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' This is...
:{{A|vo zllq104 cs paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The missing miners are here!
:{{A|vo zllq104 cs paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What are they digging for?
:{{A|vo zllq104 cs zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I'm afraid that this whole tunnel
:{{A|vo zllq104 cs zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Is the fruit of their strenuous labor
:{{A|vo zllq104 cs paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That gate...
:{{A|vo zllq104 cs paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Has it been there all along?
:{{A|vo zllq104 cs zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Digging a tunnel to this ancient seal
:{{A|vo zllq104 cs zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Had they not been discovered
:{{A|vo zllq104 cs zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' They would undoubtedly persevere
:{{A|vo zllq104 cs zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Until they opened the gate.
:{{A|vo zllq104 cs paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...So behind this seal, there's...
:;(The miners rush towards Paimon with pickaxes)
:{{A|vo zllq104 cs paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aah!!!
:;(Zhongli conjures a shield around everyone)
:{{A|vo zllq104 cs paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What do we do? We can't hurt them!
:;(As Zhongli pushes the shield forward, black smoke gathers behind him)
:;(The blue-haired girl appears out of the smoke and launches an attack)
:;(Kun Jun notices and blocks the attack from hitting Zhongli)
:;(The seal breaks and a strong gust of wind blows everyone into the cavern)

{{Color|menu|On the other side of the door, you are greeted by the daunting sight of an enormous dragon &mdash; the cause of all the strange events that have occurred. Having torn away the seal, he now proceeds to vent his fury upon you...}}

;(A battle with Azhdaha begins)
:{{A|vo zllq104 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What type of monster is this!?
:{{A|vo zllq104 6 dahaka 01.ogg}} '''Azhdaha:''' Morax... you arrive at my doorstep of your own volition. Excellent... taking revenge for sealing me away will be all the easier!
:{{A|vo zllq104 6 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' So.... the little girl is your power incarnate.
:{{A|vo zllq104 6 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' But if you recall, Azhdaha... this is not how we intended for events to transpire.
:{{A|vo zllq104 6 dahaka 02.ogg}} '''Azhdaha:''' Waste not your words! Your life is mine!

;(During the battle)
:{{A|vo zllq104 6 dahaka 03.ogg}} '''Azhdaha:''' Argh...! Is once not enough!? You would forsake me again!?
:{{A|vo zllq104 6 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' If that is what you choose to believe, so be it.
:{{A|vo zllq104 6 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' He who bears the weight of memory is destined to shoulder the burden of truth. As it ought to be.

;(If a character dies during the battle)
:{{A|vo zllq104 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Watch out!
:{{A|vo zllq104 6 kunjun 01.ogg}} '''???:''' Allow me.
:{{A|vo zllq104 6 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' You've recovered? How can that...
:{{A|vo zllq104 6 kunjun 02.ogg}} '''???:''' Focus your efforts, Morax!

;(Further into the battle)
:{{A|vo zllq104 6 dahaka 04.ogg}} '''Azhdaha:''' Morax! You think you can destroy me!?
:{{A|vo zllq104 6 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' ...

;(Defeat Azhdaha)
:{{A|vo zllq104 6 dahaka 05.ogg}} '''Azhdaha:''' Ah...!

----

;(After defeating Azhdaha)
:;(Jiu bears the title "Azhdaha")
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 jiu 01.ogg}} '''Jiu:''' Morax! A thousand years after you sealed me underground... you return for the second time...
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' ...
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' You should call it by its name, Azhdaha... fate.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 jiu 02.ogg}} '''Jiu:''' Fate?
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 jiu 03.ogg}} '''Jiu:''' Fate!!! Hahahaha!
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 jiu 04.ogg}} '''Jiu:''' So here lies the wisdom of the gods? Destroy all deemed redundant, enlist tyrants to ravage the wilderness!
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 01.ogg}} '''???:''' No. You have forgotten.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...That... that voice...
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Azhdaha...
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Kun Jun!?
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 02.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Morax. It's been a while.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 jiu 05.ogg}} '''Jiu:''' Y&mdash;You're...
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 03.ogg}} '''Kun Jun?:''' Azhdaha... the very same.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' During the battle... you embued us with your power...
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 04.ogg}} '''Kun Jun?:''' Haha... yes. It was all I could manage.
:{{DIcon}} Then... which one is the real Azhdaha?
:{{DIcon}} You're not Kun Jun?
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 05.ogg}} '''Kun Jun?:''' Forgive me for concealing the truth, Traveler. There were things that only became clear to me upon reaching this tree.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 06.ogg}} '''Kun Jun?:''' Allow me to elaborate. I am not Azhdaha the whole... but a fragment.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 07.ogg}} '''Kun Jun?:''' Heaven and earth, yin and yang, opposing forces... You can consider the existence of me and the Azhdaha you see there, to be a reflection of such polarities. "We" are a schism of the will... the will of Azhdaha.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So... so there are two Azhdahas!?
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 jiu 06.ogg}} '''Jiu:''' No! It can't be! That's impossible...!
:;(Kun Jun gains the title of "Azhdaha")
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 08.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' When the seal loosened, your power manifested in this world as a child. With this new identity, you were able to vent about the forces that suppressed you... but would anyone listen... would they even care?
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 09.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' That's when it occurred to you. The loosening of the seal constituted an opportunity to strike back. Kidnapping the miners was all in aid of digging to the entrance to the seal itself. Your plan was to launch an attack on both ends. From outside... and within. Thereby fully destroying the seal.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 jiu 07.ogg}} '''Jiu:''' The audacity! Are you insane!? If you truly are a part of me, how is it you find yourself standing on the side of the betrayer!?
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 10.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' I was another power awakened with the loosening of the seal. Too weak to reincarnate, but strong enough to possess a human body.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 11.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' I was barely conscious... I couldn't remember who I was. Only the past would elicit a reaction from me... But my aim was clear: Find Morax... and aid him in stopping you.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I had sensed that something was amiss when you mentioned [[Dragonfall]]. Had your power been but a little stronger, I would've recognized you.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 12.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Don't blame yourself, I have changed beyond all recognition. Only when I touched the stone tablet... did I truly remember.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 13.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' It's been so long. A secret beyond all comprehension, of youthful humanity and ancient dragon-kind... Morax, do you want to tell the tale?
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' There would be no harm in it. The decision is yours.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 14.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Haha, you haven't changed. Then allow me.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 15.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Azhdaha was once a friend and ally of the Geo Archon, Morax, with a lifespan far exceeding that of mankind. However, that which is derived of the earth is no more or less than the earth itself...
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 16.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' The memories of rocks do not last long. Those memories that survive are rooted in powerful emotion. But as time passes, so these memories fade into obscurity. [[Erosion]] is the world's greatest destroyer of memories.
:{{DIcon}} Erosion...?
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 17.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Erosion ground Azhdaha's consciousness into oblivion. Slowly, he forgot the face of his old friend, and his memories of defending Liyue Harbor disintegrated.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 18.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Azhdaha, now incomplete, became irascible... aggressive.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 jiu 08.ogg}} '''Jiu:''' What would you expect!? It was humanity that attacked the Ley Lines that sustained me!
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 19.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' This much is true. Which is why "you" attacked The Chasm... why "you" waged war against Morax.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 20.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' In the beginning, in order to open up new territory and increase production, the citizens of Liyue came to the mountains to mine. Overexploitation caused the Ley Lines to quake, which brought untold suffering to "us."
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 21.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Erosion made "us" even more savage. No matter how we struggled, we lost the ability to coexist with humanity... we lost all reason.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 22.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Morax shared with us some of his power, to prevent further erosion. But... it was futile. Everything returns to dust. It is the natural order, an unstoppable force.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 23.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' And so, "we" became "you." And from your will... "I" emerged.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 jiu 09.ogg}} '''Jiu:''' ...
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 24.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' I am your final contract. Witness the promise between Azhdaha and Morax. You can hate me... but you cannot deny me.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 jiu 10.ogg}} '''Jiu:''' No... no...
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 25.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' I am the remnants of Azhdaha's benevolence, the echo of a contract set in stone. I harbor a willingness to go further, a willingness to coexist peacefully with mankind.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 jiu 11.ogg}} '''Jiu:''' No, no! It is I, Azhdaha, forged of elemental crystal, bearer of the weight and memories of the earth, older than the mountains and the oceans that decides! I will not swear allegiance to this insect!
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 26.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Morax is not an insect.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 jiu 12.ogg}} '''Jiu:''' A lord over insects is nothing but an insect in turn!
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 27.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' You forgot yourself. Nobody held Morax in higher regard than you or I.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 28.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' That which you have forgotten, I hold here in my heart. If you are the memory of the earth... then I am the memory of coexistence... of coexistence with humanity.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 29.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' All powers under heaven,<ref group="Note">{{Lang|zh=天动万象|zh_rm=tiān dòng wàn xiàng|zh_tl=all powers under heaven}} is Zhongli's signature elemental burst voice-over in Chinese, being the voice-over used in his [https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1hD4y1X7Rm Character Demo].

:{{A|vo zllq104 7 jiu 13.ogg}} '''Jiu:''' ...A star appears within the wild... a sun ascends as bright as... jade...
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' ...
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 jiu 14.ogg}} '''Jiu:''' Strange... What... what is this feeling? And all this...
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 30.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' You are spent, and I will soon disappear. Before I do, heed these words.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 31.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' In the wilderness, snow falls on a spring day. In an instant it will melt. Even where it is fleeting and leaves no trace. Even where it will never fall again...
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 jiu 15.ogg}} '''Jiu:''' No, that isn't true! I don't accept this as fate!
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 32.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Perhaps it isn't. But it remains... an inevitable misfortune.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 jiu 16.ogg}} '''Jiu:''' Mor... ax...
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' The little girl vanished...
:{{DIcon}} Sealed away?
:{{DIcon}} Eroded?
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Are you satisfied, Azhdaha?
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 33.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' I had to make amends. Satisfaction had no part in it.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 34.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' So, Morax... you call yourself Zhongli these days?
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I do.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 35.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Well, I'm afraid old habits die hard. To me, you're Morax.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' As you please.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 36.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' I never did forget your gift of sight.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I hardly lifted a finger. Think nothing of it.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 37.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' And yet you could see. You wouldn't know the yearning of a blind dragon, searching for the sun. A pair of eyes, from Morax to Azhdaha. This... I will remember this.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 38.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' ...
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Your power is nearly spent.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 39.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' ...Perceptive as always, my friend.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 zhongli 13.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Shall we get going, you and I?
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 40.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Surely the pressing matter is still that of the miners trapped outside the seal?
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 zhongli 14.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Indeed. Hence the need to get going, to fix the damage left in your wake.
:{{A|vo zllq104 7 kunjun 41.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Ha... straight down to business, as always. Let's go.

:{{A|vo zllq104 8 kunjun 03.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Can I come with you?
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 uncledai 07.ogg}} '''Uncle Dai:''' No problem! You rescued my men. I'll be happy to assist all of you in any way I can. I'll be back soon, I need to assess their condition.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Kun Jun... Oh, uh... we should be calling you Azhdaha... You're coming back to Liyue Harbor too, right?
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 kunjun 04.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Not I, merely this body.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 kunjun 05.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Once I'm gone, the true owner will accompany the miners back to Liyue. Kun Jun hails from a family of famous artisans &mdash; he too will be famous in time. It would be a shame for someone of his talent to go missing.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' You always did have a great admiration for blacksmiths.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 kunjun 06.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Curious how swords and daggers are blind, yet their creators see so much. Perhaps empathy is mankind's proudest achievement after all?
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Azhdaha. I am no longer the Geo Archon.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 kunjun 07.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' ...I can sense it.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Today I am just an ordinary citizen of Liyue.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 kunjun 08.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Even you met such a fate... Let's get the difficult part out of the way. I cannot guarantee that I won't be awoken a second time.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' No matter. If that day comes to pass, Liyue must prepare itself to face you.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 kunjun 09.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' And how will Liyue fare without Rex Lapis?
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Even without a god above, this remains a nation of men. I was once their god, I ought to be here to witness their rise and fall.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 kunjun 10.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' All life is shaped and then ground away by the endless flow of time. You were always the strongest among us, yet it would seem that even you have been eroded...
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 kunjun 11.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' That's unimportant... fate is ordained by heaven. Even if our mission had already concluded, it would be cowardly not to strike out on the road of departure.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 kunjun 12.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' You may live forever, doomed to a lonely existence... yet even this is temporary. When you reach the end of time, those people, those past and future relationships predetermined by fate... They will be waiting for you.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I do not pretend to match your rhetoric when it comes to the subject of a life long-lived. I fear that the life of an elemental being is longer than any in this world.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 kunjun 13.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Were it not so, you would have killed me long ago, and would not be having to face me again now.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' You've brought a smile to my face. When all is said and done, a reunion between old friends is an auspicious occasion.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 kunjun 14.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' That day in The Chasm? Did you hesitate?
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' A heart of stone is a heart nonetheless. But I am the God of Contracts, and was, for a time, a god of the people of Liyue.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 kunjun 15.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' You chose justice, but did not forsake your kindness. You came to me not as an assassin, and so I was willingly sealed away.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The movements of the Earth Dragon can tremble the earth and shake the heavens. With your abilities, even at my full strength, I struggled to confront you, let alone seal you away.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 kunjun 16.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Hence "my" inception.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 kunjun 17.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Do not forget that I was there with Liyue's founder. The face may have changed, but the content of the contract remains intact.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 kunjun 18.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' Old friend, God of Contracts. I hereby honor our agreement.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' ...
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Thank you, Azhdaha.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 kunjun 19.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' My life is nigh on eternal. I will go on with the infinite flow of time. And you, Morax... You too will live for many a day to come.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 kunjun 20.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' ...
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 zhongli 13.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' You're leaving?
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 kunjun 21.ogg}} '''Kun Jun:''' If it is fated, Morax... we will meet again.

:{{Color|menu|A ray of light flies from Kun Jun's body, and just like that, Azhdaha is gone...}}

:{{A|vo zllq104 8 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh!?
:{{DIcon}} So is this...
::{{DIcon}} ...the real Kun Jun?<!--Two-liner, not two options-->
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 zhongli 14.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Yes. Don't be alarmed, he's only asleep.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa... that was so weird. It was like he... suddenly became another person.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 zhongli 15.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' In fact... we have yet to meet the real Kun Jun.
:{{DIcon}} But what about Azhdaha...
::{{DIcon}} He was a great friend of yours.<!--Two-liner, not two options-->
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 zhongli 16.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' He was.
:{{A|vo zllq104 8 zhongli 17.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Centuries may have passed since then... but events from a thousand years ago... remain crystal clear in my mind.

----

:{{Color|menu|You listen to the story of how Zhongli &mdash; while he yet walked the earth as Morax &mdash; discovered the elemental being Azhdaha and gave him eyes. This giant dragon signed a contract with Morax and accompanied him on many campaigns throughout the land, leaving many legends behind.}}

;(A [[#Cinematic|cinematic]] starts)
:'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' In our last tale, Rex Lapis was walking alone in the mountains. He heard a remote voice unlike any other coming from a crack in the earth.
:'''Zhongli:''' Most of the ancient Geo life forms that live below Liyue are blind, having not seen the sunlight for an age.
:'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' The voice was sometimes sad and songlike, other times it was loud and thunderous. The Lord of Geo searched here and there before finally unearthing a strange stone from the bedrock.
:'''Zhongli:''' That's how Azhdaha was. I answered his wish, and took him above ground.
:'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' The Lord of Geo took pity on the rock's spirit and carved it into a magnificent work of craftsmanship &mdash; a vivid representation of a dragon.
:'''Zhongli:''' I bestowed him with a pair of eyes to see the world and came to an agreement with him.
:'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' With his fingers, he made two eyes. Quicker than words could tell, lightning flashed and thunder roared, and a living, breathing dragon soared into the clouds!
:'''Zhongli:''' I agreed to let him live among the people above ground, but if the day ever came when he brought ruin to order, he would once again be sealed in the dark.
:'''Iron Tongue Tian:''' The dragon accompanied the Lord of Geo, fighting campaigns alongside him in the four corners of the world. We have a saying the eulogize these events:<br />"The crash of a spear brought billowing dust"<br />"The mountains and waters made way at the sound"<br />"The sight of a dragon bestowed with a touch"<br />"The promise of rainwater blessing the ground."

----

:'''''Shortly afterward, Uncle Dai volunteers to take unconscious Kun Jun back to the city along with the miners.<br />The people left behind seem like they have more to say...'''''

;(Talk to Zhongli)
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' A thousand years ago, Azhdaha attacked The Chasm. I tried to obstruct him, fighting him tooth and nail down the length and breadth of the mine. Finally, I brought him down, and sealed him underground.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' During that battle, Dragonfall was born. Azhdaha could sense the stone. Subconsciously, he wanted to use it to find me.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 03.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Despite being the victor, I could not claim to be stronger than he. And in his heart, he still retained an ounce of good will towards me... towards Liyue... towards life above ground.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 04.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' He was willing to be sealed away. But as the erosion set in... he forgot.
:{{DIcon}} The power of erosion is... scary.
:{{DIcon}} Have you also been affected by erosion?
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 05.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Even I cannot avoid it. But there is something I understand better than most: When the door opens, it is time to leave.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 06.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' The greater the power, the greater the danger erosion may bring about. The millennia may come and go, but even a stone may tire.
:{{DIcon}} Is that why you chose to leave...?
:{{DIcon}} Is that why you chose to step down as the Geo Archon...?
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 07.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Personally sealing away an old friend... this is just one form of erosion I have endured.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 08.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' People abandon and surrender the things they love to pursue the right path. Perhaps this is the erosion imposed on me by the [[Heavenly Principles]].
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 09.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' But I was a god of mankind. My identity may change, but my eyes will bear witness to the history of humanity.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You still care a lot about Liyue...
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 10.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Call it... part of my duty.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 11.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I must thank you both.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No worries!
:{{DIcon}} Hold on.
:{{DIcon}} I want to ask you something.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 12.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Oh? About what?
:{{DIcon}} About my {{MC|sister|brother|mc=1}}.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh yeah! Paimon nearly forgot!
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So, not long ago we met a guy called Dain.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He told us about Khaenri'ah and the punishment of the gods... That's when we realized that those events... were connected to the person we're searching for.
:{{DIcon}} My sibling.
:{{DIcon}} This is crucial for me.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Zhongli, you're a god. You've lived through thousands of years of history. Surely you experienced the incident.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 13.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' ...
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 14.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' ......
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 15.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I cannot say.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Why!?
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You can't even give us a thread of information? This is so important to us!
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 16.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' I understand, but I must apologize. This is my contract.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You mean, another past grievance? Like the incident with Azhdaha? Too painful to talk about?
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 17.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It was signed before it all began. I have always honored the contract... and kept my silence.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...How can you be like that...!?
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 18.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' You two are friends to me. I can assure it brings me no pleasure to disappoint you. But as the God of Contracts, I cannot go back on my word.
:{{DIcon}} Well, it's not out of character.
:{{DIcon}} I believe you.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Would you be ready to find out?
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 19.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It appears your understanding of this world continues to grow.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 20.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' There are many events of ages past... many secrets that lie hidden...
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 21.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' They have been eroded by time, forgotten by the people... abandoned.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 22.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' But you are capable of finding them and bringing them into the light.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 23.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' Those who come to witness... will witness. Those who are born to remember... will remember.
:{{A|vo zllq104 9 zhongli 24.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' If you take the same road as that person, there may be more difficulties ahead. But as long as you firmly believe that you are on the right path... everything has meaning.
:;(Quest ends)
----
;(Talk to Zhongli after the quest ends)
:{{A|vo dialog zllq105 zhongli 01.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' This tablet was erected by Mountain Shaper. It names Azhdaha as a terrible dragon, and serves as a warning for later generations to stay away from this place... from the seal.
:{{A|vo dialog zllq105 zhongli 02.ogg}} '''Zhongli:''' It's a shame... There is a fine line between good and evil. If the good and evil within him could be summarized in a single sentence... well, never mind.
:{{DIcon}} (You gaze quietly at Zhongli as he stands beneath the tree...)
:'''Zhongli says nothing more...''' (Amidst the quiet, only the soft sound of the wind can be heard. Time seems to transform into an invisible river, trickling away...)
:'''Zhongli says nothing more...''' (A fleeting moment, a thousand years in the mortal world. The rocks feel it, and so too does the earth and the gods.)

;(Talk to Zhongli again)
:'''Zhongli says nothing more...''' (Amidst the quiet, only the soft sound of the wind can be heard. Time seems to transform into an invisible river, trickling away...)
:'''Zhongli says nothing more...''' (A fleeting moment, a thousand years in the mortal world. The rocks feel it, and so too does the earth and the gods.)

;(Read the tablet)
:'''Stone Monolith:''' "Life endures in Heaven and Earth thanks to the merciful Adeptus. On this site lies an evil dragon, please do not disturb it."
