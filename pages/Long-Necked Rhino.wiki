|description = A beast with a massive body and a particularly long, slender neck, it is like a "walking tree," and found only in Natlan.<br>People arriving in Natlan for the first time often think the Long-Necked Rhino is also a type of [[Saurian]], but that is not the case at all. It's just big. In terms of size alone, there aren't many animals in any corner of [[Teyvat]] that can compare with it. Thanks to its overwhelming advantage in size and weight, it can face down predators without even blinking. All it needs to do is lift a leg and take a single step, and it can stun the fiercest of beasts into a hasty retreat. Perhaps this is another reason for the Long-Necked Rhino's generally slow and unhurried temperament...

Long-Necked Rhinos cannot be killed. Approaching one for the first time will add this creature's entry into your in-game [[Archive]].

Some Rhinos have a hidden [[Chest]] underneath them. The player can cause the Chest to spawn by getting the Rhino to stomp by approaching its feet. Causing this to happen for the first time will unlock the {{Achievement|Please Stay Your H... Feet}}.

==Trivia==
* The Long-Necked Rhino may be inspired by ''{{w|Paraceratherium}}'', a prehistoric mammal that lived during the {{w|Oligocene}} geological epoch across {{w|Eurasia}}. Closely related to the modern rhinoceros, it is one of the largest terrestrial mammals ever discovered.
* [[Kachina]] is friends with a Long-Necked Rhino called Toto, whom she describes as "the friendliest and gentlest of the bunch."<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Natlan! A New Adventure}}</ref>
