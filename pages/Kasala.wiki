'''Kasala''' was a historical figure in [[Sumeru]] who was one of the faithful priests of [[King Deshret]]. His voice can be heard narrating the penultimate cutscene that plays during the {{Quest|Secret of the Scorching Desert}}.

==Profile==
<!-- Detailed story/lore information goes here. -->
Kasala was one of the last priests to serve during the reign of King Deshret. He once presided over (and was later entombed in) the [[Mysterious Ruins]] temple, a quest-exclusive domain uncovered during the {{Quest|Secret of the Scorching Desert}}.

Kasala served under him during the period of great chaos that befell Sumeru after King Deshret, in his grief over the [[Nabu Malikata|Goddess of Flowers]]' death and in pursuit of creating an eternal utopia for his people, exposed the land to forbidden knowledge, described as knowledge that "did not belong to this world." The knowledge would soon engulf Sumeru, leading to phenomena such as [[The Withering]] and [[Eleazar]] to spread across the land. 

He and the other priests worked under the instruction of [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] (who came to King Deshret's aid) to build new temples, which she would then imbue with the "divine power of life" (Dendro) in an attempt to stave off the corrosion caused by forbidden knowledge. Following these events, Kasala also bore witness to the self-sacrifice of King Deshret, who gave his life presumably in hopes that, as the originator of the forbidden knowledge, his death would open the way for its total eradication. Kasala also witnessed the near-total exhaustion of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata's strength. which caused her to regress into the form of a small child. 

After the death of his king, Kasala would continue to serve him by residing in the Mysterious Ruins temple for the remainder of his life, ultimately being entombed there.

==Story==
Kasala was one of the last priests chosen by King Deshret during the period of his reign and the subsequent collapse of his civilization, living roughly a thousand years before the events of the main story. Under the instruction of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, he and the other priests oversaw the construction of (and later presided over) new temples across the [[Great Red Sand]] in an attempt to delay the damage caused by the forbidden knowledge. After King Deshret's death, Kasala would continue to serve him by safe-guarding one of these temples, located in the Mysterious Ruins, until his own death. Kasala would be entombed there, and the temple would eventually be lost beneath the sands for an indeterminate amount of time before being inadvertently rediscovered due to a landslide caused by an earthquake.   

In the final days or hours of his life, (either in an effort to preserve a true account of the events that he saw so they don't become lost, to serve as a cautionary tale for future generations, or as a means of preserving King Deshret's legacy) Kasala recorded a message (later discovered by [[Alhaitham]]) recounting the slow collapse of King Deshret's civilization. The message revealed that, contrary to the beliefs of many present-day [[The Eremites|Eremites]], King Deshret had never been betrayed by Greater Lord Rukkhadevata at all, and they instead worked together to stop the spread of forbidden knowledge, with King Deshret ultimately deciding to sacrifice himself to protect his people.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Secret of the Scorching Desert}}</ref>
