'''Starsplinter Iron''' is a Quest Item obtained during the [[Bygones Times Like Dust Passing]] Quest in the [[Interlude Chapter]] Archon Quest. Three copies of this item are obtainable, however only at least two are required to proceed the quest.

When in proximity to this item, [[Visions]] will glow a pulsating yellow. The only exceptions to this rule are [[Venti]] and [[Zhongli]], as their Visions are not real functional ones. The [[Traveler]] and [[Raiden Shogun]] are also exceptions since they have no Visions.

==Locations==
All Starsplinter Iron ores can be found at the mountain foot nearby the [[Sea of Clouds]]' southwestern-most [[Teleport Waypoint]], within the radius marked during the "Bygones Times Like Dust Passing" quest.
