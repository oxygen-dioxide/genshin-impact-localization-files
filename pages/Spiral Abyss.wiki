{{Description|A massive underground city constructed by an ancient civilization long gone. To this day, the purpose of this underground city remains unknown. Its structure is divided into the "Abyss Corridor," which connects worlds, and the "Abyssal Moon Spire," which leads to the unknown. It is now collectively called the "Spiral Abyss"... It is said that many secrets and treasures that have been long forgotten by this world lay buried within...<br />Monsters and humans alike flock to the tower in search of the secrets and treasures it contains. Challenge different floors of the tower and defeat the enemies within to win Abyssal Stars. Do this, and the Spiral Abyss may yet look upon your hard work and bestow rewards upon you.}}

The '''Spiral Abyss''' is a special type of [[Domain]] unlocked at [[Adventure Rank]] 20 located in [[Musk Reef]], which can be accessed through the wormhole in the sky at the edge of [[Cape Oath]].

The Spiral Abyss consists of two main parts: the Abyss Corridor (Floors 1–8) and the Abyssal Moon Spire (Floors 9–12). The Corridor's rewards can only be collected once, and completing all floors unlocks the Spire. The Spire's rewards reset on the 1st and 16th days of the month during the '''Moment of Syzygy'''. The period beginning on the 1st of every month is called the Waxing Phase while the period beginning on the 16th of every month is called the Waning Phase.

Players can view their current progress on their map, next to their resin count. If no Spiral Abyss challenge exists, it will say "This round's challenge has not yet begun".

==Description==
{{Description|Rumor has it that people who've ascended to [[Celestia]] have also witnessed the same helix-shaped divine ladder that can be seen within [[Vision]]s. Venturing out into the universe and down into the [[abyss]] are the same in that both are braving the dark unknown.|[[Adventurer Handbook]]}}

==Abyssal Stars, Chambers, and Floors==
The Spiral Abyss is divided into 12 floors, with each floor containing 3 chambers. In the Abyss Corridor, all enemies are at the same level. In the Abyssal Moon Spire, the enemies in each chamber gradually increases in level.

For Floors 1 to 4, each chamber must be cleared in five minutes (300 seconds). From Floor 5 onwards, each chamber must be cleared in ten minutes (600 seconds) - in floors where the [[Ley Line Monolith]] must be protected, it must be kept intact, or the player will fail. In floors where 2 teams are required, the second half of the chamber starts with the time remaining from the first half.

All chambers have challenges that can be completed in order to obtain additional rewards outside of first-time clears. Currently, there are only two types of challenges - one in which the player needs to clear the chamber in a set amount of time, and another in which a Ley Line Monolith must have a specific amount of health. Entering the next floor requires you to have earned at least six Abyssal Stars from the previous floor, as well as having cleared all three of the previous floor's chambers.

Total stars earned are retroactive. In other words, it is not necessary to clear the entire floor to get more stars. If the player had obtained 3 stars from the second and final chambers of a floor, but none from the first on their first try, they may try the first chamber as much as they would like, with any stars gained during these attempts being saved even after leaving and restarting the floor.

==Abyss Corridor and the Abyssal Moon Spire==
[[File:Abyss Corridor.png|250px|right|thumb|Abyss Corridor]]
[[File:Abyssal moon spire.png|250px|right|thumb|Abyssal Moon Spire]]

The Spiral Abyss is composed of two parts: The "Abyss Corridor" and the "Abyssal Moon Spire." Clear all 8 floors of the Abyss Corridor to permanently unlock the Abyssal Moon Spire.

Seemingly following the lunar cycle of another world, the Abyssal Moon Spire will reset itself twice a month, occurring on the first and sixteenth days of the month, which may also cause a new period of Blessing of the Abyssal Moon to begin. However, the generous treasures found in the Abyss Corridor which connects the world to the Abyssal Spire will not change or reset over time. It should also be noted the moon visible in the abyssal moon spire is clearly distinct from the moon over Teyvat.

==Combat Bonuses and Restrictions==
===Restrictions and Ley Line Disorders===
[[File:Ley Line Disorder.png|250px|right|thumb|Example Ley Line Disorder that benefits Electro characters]]
There are several restrictions in the Spiral Abyss. When challenging each floor, the player cannot:
*Consume [[food]] or other [[consumables]]
*Change party members
*Change [[artifacts]] or [[weapons]]
*Level up or ascend [[characters]]
In addition, each floor in the Spiral Abyss has different '''[[Ley Line Disorders]], '''which could give buffs or debuffs to characters, enemies, or both. In order to complete the challenge more easily, consider the enemies in each chamber and the Ley Line Disorder in effect.

===Divergence===
[[File:Divergence.png|250px|right|thumb|Divergence]]
Starting at Floor 5, the Spiral Abyss will diverge into two paths. To dive deeper, the player must arrange two teams of up to four characters to challenge each half a chamber. The player cannot use the same character in both teams.

<br />
===Benediction of the Abyss===
[[File:Benediction of the Abyss.png|250px|right|thumb|Example Benedictions of the Abyss]]
{{Main|Spiral Abyss/Benediction of the Abyss|l1=Benediction of the Abyss}}
{{Description|The everlasting whisper of the Spiral Abyss encourages you to go deeper. Choose your Benediction of the Abyss...}}
Challengers will receive recognition from the depths of the Spiral Abyss. This recognition comes in the form of a buff that assists the player in battle.

At the start of each chamber, the player can choose to receive one '''Benediction of the Abyss'''. Different benedictions have different effects and durations:
* Effective this floor: Effect lasts until entering the next floor.
* Effective this chamber: Effect lasts until entering the next chamber.
* Effective immediately: Effect starts immediately.
Choosing the right Benediction according to the party composition will help complete the challenge more easily.

The Benedictions list for each Chamber is updated every [[Daily Reset]].

===Blessing of the Abyssal Moon===
[[File:Blessing of the Abyssal Moon.png|250px|right|thumb|Blessing of the Abyssal Moon]]
{{Main|Spiral Abyss/Blessing of the Abyssal Moon|l1=Blessing of the Abyssal Moon}}

==Trivia==
* Players can view statistics from their runs in the Abyssal Moon Spire (Floors 9 through 12) from the last 24 Phases (12 months).
* In astronomy, "{{w|Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy}}" is the configuration of three celestial bodies in a straight line. One commonly-known type of syzygy is an {{w|eclipse}}.
** In the Valentinianism system of Gnosticism, "syzygy" refers to the duo male and female emanations of {{w|Aeon (Gnosticism)|God}}.
* The Spiral Abyss appears to take inspiration from Honkai's {{hi3rd|Q-Singularis}} challenge.
