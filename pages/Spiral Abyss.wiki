The '''Spiral Abyss''' is a special type of [[Domain]] unlocked at [[Adventure Rank]] 20 located in [[Musk Reef]], which can be accessed through the wormhole in the sky at the edge of [[Cape Oath]].

The Spiral Abyss consists of two main parts: the Abyss Corridor (Floors 1–8) and the Abyssal Moon Spire (Floors 9–12). The Corridor's rewards can only be collected once, and completing all floors unlocks the Spire. The Spire's rewards reset on the 16th day of the month during the '''Moment of Syzygy'''. Prior to June 16th, 2024, the period beginning on the 1st of every month is called the Waxing Phase while the period beginning on the 16th of every month is called the Waning Phase.

Players can view their current progress on their map, next to their resin count. If no Spiral Abyss challenge exists, it will say "This round's challenge has not yet begun."

==Abyssal Stars, Chambers, and Floors==
The Spiral Abyss is divided into 12 floors, with each floor containing 3 chambers. In the Abyss Corridor, all enemies across each floor share the same level. In the Abyssal Moon Spire, the enemies in each chamber gradually increase in level. Enemies in the chambers can appear in one of two formats; a constant replenishment until all of that unit type is cleared, or more commonly, in sets of waves that require all enemies in the current wave to be defeated before the next wave will enter.

For Floors 1 to 4, each chamber must be cleared in 300 seconds. From Floor 5 onwards, each chamber must be cleared in 600 seconds - in floors where the [[Ley Line Monolith]] must be protected, it must be kept intact, or the player will fail. In floors where 2 teams are required, the second half of the chamber starts with the time (or Ley Line Monolith HP) remaining from the first half.

All chambers have challenges that can be completed in order to obtain additional rewards outside of first-time clears. Currently, there are only two types of challenges - one in which the player needs to clear the chamber in a set amount of time, and another in which a Ley Line Monolith must have a specific amount of health. Entering the next floor requires you to have earned at least six Abyssal Stars from the previous floor, as well as having cleared all three of the previous floor's chambers.

Total stars earned are retroactive. In other words, it is not necessary to clear the entire floor to get more stars. If the player had obtained 3 stars from the second and third chambers of a floor, but none from the first on their first try, they may try the first chamber as much as they would like, with any stars gained during these attempts being saved even after leaving and restarting the floor. It is not possible to reset after clearing a chamber, so players should be careful during the last chamber to avoid having to complete the entire floor again just to reach it if they miss the requirements.

The Abyss Corridor has various requirements that are generally inconsistent across floors.

In the Abyssal Moon Spire, the time requirements are more consistent, with the first two chambers of floors 9, 10 and 11 requiring a clear time of 60/180/300 seconds (1/3/5 minutes remaining) for their stars. On the last chamber of these floors, and all of floor 12, the time needed to obtain a star is decreased to 180/300/420 (3/5/7 minutes remaining) for their stars. [[Normal Boss]]es or Veteran [[Local Legend]]s make an appearance in floor 11, often on the second half of the chamber. On floor 12, they can appear on both halves.

After [[Version/5.1|Version 5.1]], players can quick-claim from floors 9 and 10 and do not have to clear them when the Abyssal Moon Spire resets, provided that they have cleared floor 11 and 12 respectively with full stars.

After completing a chamber, the character's health and energy will be halted at whatever levels they are at the time; if the chamber was cleared but the character is applying healing over time afterwards or energy particles/orbs were heading to them, they will be nulled. Players should take note of this in order to ensure the team is ready for the next chamber, since having characters at relatively healthy levels and using [[Elemental Burst]]s can mean the difference between acquiring or missing a star.

==Abyss Corridor and the Abyssal Moon Spire==
[[File:Spiral Abyss Abyss Corridor UI.png|250px|right|thumb|Abyss Corridor]]
[[File:Spiral Abyss Abyssal Moon Spire UI.png|250px|right|thumb|Abyssal Moon Spire]]

The Spiral Abyss is composed of two parts: The "Abyss Corridor" and the "Abyssal Moon Spire." Clear all 8 floors of the Abyss Corridor to permanently unlock the Abyssal Moon Spire.

Seemingly following the lunar cycle of another world, the Abyssal Moon Spire will reset itself once a month, occurring on the sixteenth day of the month, which may also cause a new period of Blessing of the Abyssal Moon to begin. However, the generous treasures found in the Abyss Corridor which connects the world to the Abyssal Spire will not change or reset over time. It should also be noted the moon visible in the abyssal moon spire is clearly distinct from the moon over Teyvat.

Unlike the Abyss Corridor, the Abyssal Moon Spire resets every 31 days, after which it can be attempted again in order to reclaim its rewards. The enemies on floors 9 and 10 generally change once every anniversary update (when a new nation is launched), while those on floors 11 and 12 generally change once per update, after the Abyssal Moon Spire is reset.

==Combat Bonuses and Restrictions==
===Restrictions and Ley Line Disorders===
[[File:Spiral Abyss Ley Line Disorder.png|250px|right|thumb|Example Ley Line Disorder that benefits Electro characters]]
There are several restrictions in the Spiral Abyss. When challenging each floor, the player cannot:
*Consume [[food]] or other [[consumables]]
*Change party members
*Change [[artifacts]] or [[weapons]]
*Level up or ascend [[characters]]
In addition, each floor in the Spiral Abyss has different [[Ley Line Disorders]], which could give buffs or debuffs to characters, enemies, or both. In order to complete the challenge more easily, consider the enemies in each chamber and the Ley Line Disorder in effect.
{{clr}}

===Divergence===
[[File:Spiral Abyss Character Selection UI.png|250px|right|thumb|Character Selection with Two Diverging Paths]]
Starting at Floor 5, the Spiral Abyss will diverge into two paths. To dive deeper, the player must arrange two teams of up to four characters to challenge each half a chamber. The player cannot use the same character in both teams.
{{clr}}

===Enemy HP===
On certain floors of the Spiral Abyss, enemies have increased HP values compared to those of their counterparts encountered in the open world:
* Increased by 50%: Floors 3 &ndash; 7
* Increased by 100%: Floors 8 &ndash; 11
* Increased by 150%: Floor 12 (Nominal bonus)*
<nowiki>*</nowiki>Note: Some Spiral Abyss cycles may have additional amendments on the HP Bonus on specific enemies, or specific chambers, or the entire floor. Please refer to a specific Spiral Abyss cycle for more details on the specifics of each cycle. {{clr}}

===Benediction of the Abyss===

{{Main|Spiral Abyss/Benediction of the Abyss|l1=Benediction of the Abyss}}
{{Description|The everlasting whisper of the Spiral Abyss encourages you to go deeper. Choose your Benediction of the Abyss...}}
Challengers will receive recognition from the depths of the Spiral Abyss. This recognition comes in the form of a buff that assists the player in battle.

At the start of each chamber, the player can choose to receive one '''Benediction of the Abyss'''. Different benedictions have different effects and durations:
* Effective this floor: Effect lasts until entering the next floor.
* Effective this chamber: Effect lasts until entering the next chamber.
* Effective immediately: Effect starts immediately.
Choosing the right Benediction according to the party composition will help complete the challenge more easily.

The Benedictions list for each Chamber is updated every [[Daily Reset]].

===Blessing of the Abyssal Moon===
[[File:Spiral Abyss Blessing of the Abyssal Moon.png|250px|right|thumb|Blessing of the Abyssal Moon]]
{{Main|Spiral Abyss/Blessing of the Abyssal Moon|l1=Blessing of the Abyssal Moon}}
The blessing in the Spiral Abyss varies each month and provides a range of buffs.

Clearing the Spiral Abyss gives players generous rewards. Clearing each chamber for the first time allows players to receive the '''"Chamber's Bounty."''' Earn enough Abyssal Stars in each chamber to collect the '''"Star's Bounty."''' It's possible to check the rewards in the Rewards Preview.

On the sixteenth day of each month, the Abyssal Moon Spire's rewards will be reset and a new period of Blessing of the Abyssal Moon will begin. Abyss Corridor rewards do not reset.

If there is not enough inventory space for Spiral Abyss bounty, the items will be sent via mail under the title "Spiral Abyss - Lost Items," with one mail per chamber. However, this does not apply to rewards who were not claimed before the reset, such as primogems.

===Chamber's Bounty===
