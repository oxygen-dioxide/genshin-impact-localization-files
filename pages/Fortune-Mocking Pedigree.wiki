==Gameplay Notes==
* Starting from the beginning of {{If Self|Fortune-Mocking Pedigree|the quest|''[[Fortune-Mocking Pedigree]]''}}, the player will be in a [[Special Story Mode]].
** If the player leaves this mode, they will be teleported to the main overworld outside of the hut where Caribert stays, and the active quest step will change to "Go inside" with the quest marker at the entrance to the hut, unless otherwise noted in [[#Steps|the quest steps]]. Entering the hut will return the player to the special story mode, even if the latest quest checkpoint appears to be different.
** The [[Paimon Menu]] button is replaced with an exit button (as in [[Domain]]s) which displays a notice when used:
*** ''Hint: You are currently in a special story mode. You will be able to continue it even if you leave. Do you wish to leave?''
** Most other menus are also not accessible through the UI, hotkeys, or Shortcut Wheel, including the [[Party Setup]], [[Map]], [[Time]], and [[Settings]] menus.
** The minimap:
*** Displays a temporary red world border.
**** When approaching the border, the player's character will stop by themselves and return on their own with a voiced line from the Traveler (as Paimon is not present during this quest sequence).
*** Will always be lit up, regardless of whether or not the player has unlocked the [[Statue of The Seven]].
*** Does not show the map icons for [[Spire of Solitary Enlightenment]] or [[Teleport Waypoint]]s, including the Teleport Waypoint located within the bounded area, even though they are present (but unusable) in the world.
*** Does not show the player's map pins, even if they have some set in the bounded area on the normal map.
*** Does not show the "Hidden Cavern: I" or "Hidden Cavern: II" map layers.
** The tunnel coming from the Chasm is blocked off by a solid fog wall at the Sumeru-Liyue border within the tunnel.
** The cavern below the [[Spire of Solitary Enlightenment]] (the "Hidden Cavern: I" map layer) is accessible from both entrances, regardless of whether or not the player has removed the vines. It is also flooded, regardless of whether or not the player has drained the water.
** This mode has its own set of collectible items ([[Kalpalata Lotus]], [[Harra Fruit]], etc.), [[enemies]], and [[wildlife]], independent of those found in the main overworld. Some entities are only found in either the special story mode or the main overworld, while others are present in both.
*** Collecting items or killing enemies or wildlife in one will not affect the presence of any entities in the other.
*** Enemies and wildlife do not drop anything other than their normal amount of [[Energy|energy particles and orbs]].
*** Enemies respawn when the special story mode is re-entered. No items respawn.
*** There are no [[ore]]s.
** Most NPCs and interactables (such as [[Cooking#Places to Cook|cooking pots]], [[Investigation]] spots, [[Elemental Monument]]s, [[Bouncy Mushroom]]s, and [[Clusterleaves of Cultivation]]) are removed.
*** [[Hayyan]] and [[Futuh]] are replaced with [[Hajjan]] and [[Fateh]].
** There is [[Fortune-Mocking Pedigree#Special Story Mode Dialogue|special dialogue]] in this mode.
** The Statue of The Seven:
*** Only has the "Leave" dialogue option.
**** As there is no "Resonate with [[Dendro]]" dialogue option when non-Dendro [[Traveler]] is the active character, it is impossible to switch the Traveler's element while in the special story mode.
*** Displays in the dilapidated Level 1 style, regardless of how much it has been repaired by the player.
*** Has its own pool of Restorative Power, which appears to hold an infinite amount of HP.
*** Will auto-recover the player's characters to 100% HP, regardless of what auto-recover maximum the player has set and whether or not the player has auto-recover turned on.
**** Characters who are healed to 100% HP by the Statue of The Seven trigger overhealing effects such as [[Furina's 1st Ascension Passive]], which does not happen with normal Statues of The Seven.<!-- Does the Statue here heal a large amount of fixed HP? If so, testing needs to be done with a character who has over 66k HP since healing at least that amount on a single character has already been verified -->
*** Does not continuously heal nearby characters who lose HP after the initial heal from the Statue.
*** Restores 10% of the Max HP of fallen characters when reviving them upon approaching the Statue of The Seven. (Characters are still healed by the usual 35% of their Max HP when revived after the whole party falls.)
*** Serves as the respawn location when the player's party [[Fallen Character|falls]].
** Hitting trees will not yield [[wood]].
** Most gadgets cannot be used. Gadgets that can be used include: [[Wind Catcher]], [[NRE (Menu 30)]], [[Memento Lens]], [[Peculiar Pinion]], [[Red Feather Fan]], [[Windblume Festival Commemorative Balloon]], [[Jumpy Dumpty Party Popper]], [[Adepti Seeker's Stove]], [[Warming Bottle]], [["Special Analysis Zoom Lens"|"Special Analysis Zoom Lens,"]] most [[:Category:Equipment_Gadgets|"equipment" gadgets]], and gadgets that are not located in the "Gadgets" tab of the Inventory,{{verify|[[Scarlet Sand Slate]]?}} such as the [[Aranyaka (Gadget)|Aranyaka gadget]].
*** Although the [[Seed Dispensary]] cannot be "used," its contents can still be viewed (which is what "using" the Seed Dispensary does) from the Inventory screen. Additionally, having the Seed Dispensary equipped will still allow the player to obtain seeds as usual.
*** Unlike other "equipment" gadgets, [[Jinni in the Magic Bottle — Liloupar|Liloupar]]{{verify}} and [[Sorush (Gadget)|Sorush]] cannot be equipped.
** No character can be targeted by Nahida's [[All Schemes to Know]].
** As the [[Time]] menu is inaccessible, the time of day during some parts of the quest cannot be changed until the story advances.
** Other quests that take place in this area, such as the {{Quest|Starry Night Chapter}}, cannot be started or progressed, although the "Trackable Quest(s) Nearby" notice will still appear.

{{Quest Description|As night passes and you awaken next to the bonfire, you realize that Paimon is missing. As you search for her, you come upon a wandering father by chance...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the house)
:{{A|vo szaq202 2 eide 01.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' Halt! What do you think you're doing!?
:{{DIcon}} Agh!
:{{DIcon}} You startled me!
:{{A|vo szaq202 2 eide 02.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' This place is not whatever you think it is... Nor should you be poking your nose into my business! Begone!
:{{DIcon}} Whoa, whoa... Just calm down.
:{{DIcon}} I'm only here to look for my traveling companion.
:{{A|vo szaq202 2 eide 03.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' Your travel companion? ...You mean the one that was keeping watch by your side last night?
:{{A|vo szaq202 2 eide 04.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' Your companion departed for the forest early this morning. That much I saw with my own eyes.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (I thought so... Still, I don't know if I can trust this person's word just yet.)
:{{DIcon}} So you mean to say that...
:{{DIcon}} You were nearby last night?
:{{A|vo szaq202 2 eide 05.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' What business is that of yours? All you need to know is that I claimed this place first &mdash; and what I do here is none of your concern.
:{{A|vo szaq202 2 eide 06.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' Do I make myself quite clear? Leave!
:'''{{Traveler}}:'''  ...
:'''{{Traveler}}:'''  (There's something strange about this person. I need to find out what he's hiding...)
:{{A|vo szaq202 2 eide 07.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' Well? What are you waiting for?
:{{DIcon}} I don't think I'll have much luck trying to find my companion in the woods...
:{{DIcon}} I think I'm better off waiting here for them to come back.
:{{A|vo szaq202 2 eide 08.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' *sigh* If you must... Suit yourself.
:{{A|vo szaq202 2 eide 09.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' I've been observing you, and you don't look like a [[Forest Ranger]], nor someone from the [[Akademiya]].
:{{A|vo szaq202 2 eide 10.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' Still, I'm warning you, no funny business. Promise me that, and you can do as you please.
:{{DIcon}} I'm no villain.
:{{DIcon}} Nor will I pretend to be a saint.
:{{A|vo szaq202 2 eide 11.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' Okay, fine, whatever... Move aside. I'm heading in.
:{{DIcon}} May I join you?
:{{DIcon}} I was out here all night. I'm cold.
:{{A|vo szaq202 2 eide 12.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' You...
:{{A|vo szaq202 2 eide 13.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' *sigh* Oh, go on then, have it your way. I knew I wasn't going to be able to hide this anyway. Just come in.
:{{A|vo szaq202 2 eide 14.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' But no overreacting to anything you see in here, okay? You understand me?
:{{DIcon}} Relax. I've been around, it takes a lot to faze me.
:{{DIcon}} Got it.
:{{A|vo szaq202 2 eide 15.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' Come on, then.

;(Approach the Hilichurl)
:'''Hilichurl:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} A hilichurl?
:{{DIcon}} Why do you keep a hilichurl at home?
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 01.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' Mind your own business. Don't worry, he isn't aggressive...
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 02.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' ...How could he be. He was too young for anything like that.
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 03.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' So don't you lay a finger on him. Just find yourself a corner to rest if you're tired or cold.
:{{DIcon}} You're... from [[Khaenri'ah]], aren't you?
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 04.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 05.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' You know Khaenri'ah... Who are you, exactly? And how do you know I'm from Khaenri'ah?
:{{DIcon}} I'm just a traveler.
::{{DIcon}} Your clothes...
::{{DIcon}} Your eyes...
:{{DIcon}} I've met others from Khaenri'ah.
::{{DIcon}} Your clothes...
::{{DIcon}} Your eyes...
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 06.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' ...
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 07.ogg}} '''Intimidating Man:''' Do you worship a god, Traveler?
:{{DIcon}} I follow no god. In fact, I count some of them as my foes.
:{{DIcon}} I follow no god. Though I count some of them as my friends.
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 08.ogg}} '''Eide:''' ...Sounds like you've had an eventful life. Alright, well... my name is Eide. And you are correct &mdash; I was once Khaenri'ahn.
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 09.ogg}} '''Eide:''' I apologize for my earlier hostility. But you must understand... As far as I'm concerned, humans who do not worship [[The Seven]] are nigh extinct...
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 10.ogg}} '''Eide:''' ...And all who place faith in the gods are my enemies.
:{{DIcon}} That sounds a little too black-and-white.
:{{DIcon}} Spoken like a true Khaenri'ahn.
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 11.ogg}} '''Eide:''' ...That may be, but the fact is that chances to talk to people like yourself have been few and far between since the cataclysm.
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 12.ogg}} '''Eide:''' This wretched curse of immortality... Who knows how long I must continue to suffer like this?
:{{DIcon}} What is the curse of immortality, exactly?
:{{DIcon}} I take it that's how you've survived for so long?
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 13.ogg}} '''Eide:''' The curse? Huh, it was a little gift given to the people of Khaenri'ah by those vile gods...
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 14.ogg}} '''Eide:''' We lost our home, our loved ones, everything... The agony of the cataclysm itself was already too much to bear... but then came the curse, robbing us any chance of release.
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 15.ogg}} '''Eide:''' All we can do is watch helplessly as our souls erode and our bodies decay.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (So Eide is just like [[Dainsleif|Dain]], someone who bears the curse of immortality.)
:{{DIcon}} So why did some people turn into [[hilichurls]]...
:{{DIcon}} ...While you were afflicted by this curse instead?
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 16.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Because although Khaenri'ah began with a single bloodline, it was a home to others, too...
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 17.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Any who forsook their gods and came to Khaenri'ah were welcomed as our fellow citizens.
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 18.ogg}} '''Eide:''' When the cataclysm came, we pure-blood Khaenri'ahns were declared the "greater sinners." Upon us, the gods placed the curse of immortality...
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 19.ogg}} '''Eide:''' But those whose ancestry belonged to the domains of other gods were punished with the curse of the wilderness as they fled, turning them into monsters.
:{{DIcon}} So... who is this hilichurl to you?
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 20.ogg}} '''Eide:''' He is [[Caribert (NPC)|Caribert]]... my illegitimate son.
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 21.ogg}} '''Eide:''' *sigh* How times have changed. I can say that out loud with no consequence now, but... it was once a matter of unspeakable shame.
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 22.ogg}} '''Eide:''' I was a noble of Khaenri'ah by blood... but I resented the life that my family had arranged for me.
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 23.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Then one day, I met a beautiful woman amongst the people. Her roots were in [[Mondstadt]]... but that mattered not to me. It was love at first sight.
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 24.ogg}} '''Eide:''' ...Caribert faced great hardship from the very moment of his birth, all due to my selfish desires... and I was never able to be there by his side for any of it.
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 25.ogg}} '''Eide:''' ...After all that, he turned into a hilichurl right before my very eyes.
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 26.ogg}} '''Eide:''' I always owed him much, and now... at least I can finally be close to him.
:{{DIcon}} ...What happened to his mother?
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 27.ogg}} '''Eide:''' She was...
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 28.ogg}} '''Eide:''' ...*sigh* We were separated. I do not wish to dwell on it.
:{{DIcon}} I'm sorry...
:{{DIcon}} I know this must cause you great pain.
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 29.ogg}} '''Eide:''' ...It could be worse. I suffer the pain of loss because I once had everything I could wish for.
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 30.ogg}} '''Eide:''' And now... now that I have lost almost everything, the little that remains I see with new clarity.
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 31.ogg}} '''Eide:''' If nothing else... At least I still have Caribert.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} What do you plan to do now?
:{{DIcon}} What were you planning to do around here?
:{{A|vo szaq202 3 eide 32.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Ah, yes, that reminds me. I only returned here to check on Caribert, but I do have other things I wish to do... You may come with me, if you're so inclined.

;(Talk to Caribert, optional)
:'''Caribert:''' ...

;(Approach Eide)
:{{A|vo szaq202 5 eide 01.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Over here.
:{{DIcon}} A Crafting Bench?
:{{DIcon}} What are you going to use this for?
:{{A|vo szaq202 5 eide 02.ogg}} '''Eide:''' I'm sure you're wondering why I brought Caribert here, to [[Sumeru]].
:{{A|vo szaq202 5 eide 03.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Well, it's because he needs a medicine that can only be made here...
:{{A|vo szaq202 5 eide 04.ogg}} '''Eide:''' One which will help him to recover his clarity of mind.
:{{DIcon}} Recover his clarity of mind?
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (When we were in [[The Chasm]], Dain said that the curse could not be undone... Is recovery really possible?)
:{{A|vo szaq202 5 eide 05.ogg}} '''Eide:''' I do not hope to break the curse. I am well aware of my powerlessness against the punishment of the gods.
:{{A|vo szaq202 5 eide 06.ogg}} '''Eide:''' But it's said that this medicine is imbued with the power of Sumeru's [[Lesser Lord Kusanali|God of Wisdom]], and can awaken the mind from a state of deep stupor... It has been used in the past to treat cases of mania.
:{{A|vo szaq202 5 eide 07.ogg}} '''Eide:''' I believe that it might just work...
:{{DIcon}} Where did you hear of this?
:{{A|vo szaq202 5 eide 08.ogg}} '''Eide:''' ...I read about it in a book from the Royal Library of Khaenri'ah. It was banned, since this medicine requires the power of The Seven to work.
:{{A|vo szaq202 5 eide 09.ogg}} '''Eide:''' In my youth, I&mdash;I disliked the life of nobility, and craved excitement. I was leafing through some forbidden texts and happened upon it.
:{{DIcon}} You know, there must've been a reason it was banned...
:{{DIcon}} It sounds dangerous...
:{{A|vo szaq202 5 eide 10.ogg}} '''Eide:''' ...What other choice do I have? What exactly would you have me do?
:{{A|vo szaq202 5 eide 11.ogg}} '''Eide:''' The gods have already punished us! What does one more sin matter now?
:{{DIcon}} Alright, don't get too worked up...
:{{DIcon}} I understand. No matter what, you have to try.
:{{A|vo szaq202 5 eide 12.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Never mind, as long as you understand... I&mdash;I'm sorry, I struggle to take control of my mood sometimes... Perhaps a consequence of having lived too long.
:{{A|vo szaq202 5 eide 13.ogg}} '''Eide:''' As it happens, I am in dire need of some help to make this medicine.
:{{A|vo szaq202 5 eide 14.ogg}} '''Eide:''' My hands don't have the dexterity they once did. I fear that they may be decaying from within... all thanks to this curse of immortality.
:{{A|vo szaq202 5 eide 15.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Okay, to start with, take this ingredient...
::[[File:Item Strange Mushroom.png|100px]]
:{{DIcon}} A mushroom?
:{{DIcon}} I've never seen a mushroom of this kind before...
:{{A|vo szaq202 5 eide 16.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Also, do you have any of Sumeru's regional specialties on hand? I believe they're called... {{color|buzzword|Kalpalata Lotuses}} and {{color|buzzword|Sumeru Roses}}.
:;(If the player has the ingredients)
::{{DIcon}} I've picked some before, yes.
::{{A|vo szaq202 6 eide 01a 1.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Wonderful. I&mdash;In that case, we have everything we need.
:;(If the player does not have the ingredients)
::{{DIcon}} No, but I can go out and get some.
::{{A|vo szaq202 7 eide 01b 1.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Could you really? Much obliged.
:{{A|vo szaq202 8 eide 01.ogg}} '''Eide:''' This is the method for making the medicine. You just need to follow the steps.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Strange Mushroom|x=2}})

;(Talk to Eide again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog szaq202 eide 01.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Without your help, goodness knows how long this would take me...
:{{A|vo dialog szaq202 eide 02.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Thank you.

;(Talk to Eide after crafting [[Nameless Taboo Medicine of the Royal Court]])
:{{A|vo szaq202 10 eide 01.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Is it done? Splendid, let me see...
:{{A|vo szaq202 10 eide 02.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Hmm. In all honesty, I do not know what the end product is supposed to look like. The banned book didn't feature any illustrations...
:{{A|vo szaq202 10 eide 03.ogg}} '''Eide:''' ...Well, the moment has finally arrived... Curses.
:{{DIcon}} Excuse me?
:{{DIcon}} Is it time to give Caribert the medicine?
:{{A|vo szaq202 10 eide 04.ogg}} '''Eide:''' No, no. We need to perform one final step to complete the medicine.
:{{A|vo szaq202 10 eide 05.ogg}} '''Eide:''' I said before that this medicine relies on the power of the God of Wisdom for its restorative effects...
:{{A|vo szaq202 10 eide 06.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Which means... we must pay a visit to a Statue of The Seven.
:{{DIcon}} Ouch... that can't be easy for someone from Khaenri'ah...
:{{DIcon}} I understand your reluctance.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Since he needs the God of Wisdom's power, should I get [[Nahida]] to help?)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (...Forget it. Eide hates the gods &mdash; it could complicate things. I'll just do it his way.)
:{{A|vo szaq202 10 eide 07.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Let's go. Bring the medicine with you.
----
;(Approach the Statue of The Seven)
:{{A|vo szaq202 11 eide 01.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Look at this statue... How can I bow before this thing...
:{{A|vo szaq202 11 eide 02.ogg}} '''Eide:''' God of Wisdom. Look at me.
:{{A|vo szaq202 11 eide 03.ogg}} '''Eide:''' I will utter no prayer, nor will I sing your praises.
:{{A|vo szaq202 11 eide 04.ogg}} '''Eide:''' You and your kind destroyed my home, wrought unfathomable suffering on my compatriots... Yet here I stand before you.
:{{A|vo szaq202 11 eide 05.ogg}} '''Eide:''' You cannot mock me more than fate itself already has.
:{{A|vo szaq202 11 eide 06.ogg}} '''Eide:''' God of Wisdom, I seek not to disavow myself of the sinful blood that flows through my veins. I wish only to beseech you to have pity upon a young and unfortunate soul.
:{{A|vo szaq202 11 eide 07.ogg}} '''Eide:''' My son, Caribert... He was turned into a monster before he had the chance to witness anything beautiful in this world... This is no fate for a child.
:{{A|vo szaq202 11 eide 08.ogg}} '''Eide:''' ...
:{{A|vo szaq202 11 eide 09.ogg}} '''Eide:''' If everything the gods have done was in order to have the impious people of Khaenri'ah bow their heads...
:{{A|vo szaq202 11 eide 10.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Then... I bow to you now.
:{{A|vo szaq202 11 eide 11.ogg}} '''Eide:''' I have given up all I ever stood for...
:{{A|vo szaq202 11 eide 12.ogg}} '''Eide:''' All I ask for is a tiny miracle. For Caribert to see this world once more.
:{{A|vo szaq202 11 eide 13.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Please, god... I beg of you.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' ...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (I may not know the whole truth behind the cataclysm, but the people of Khaenri'ah have truly suffered...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Why could Khaenri'ah and The Seven not coexist in peace?)
:{{A|vo szaq202 11 eide 14.ogg}} '''Eide:''' I have made quite enough of a fool of myself for one day. Let's go.
:{{DIcon}} Things will get better.
:{{A|vo szaq202 11 eide 15.ogg}} '''Eide:''' ...Hm.
----
;(Talk to Caribert)
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 01.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Caribert?
:'''Caribert:''' ...
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (The hilichurl seems almost lifeless. Its reactions to everything are incredibly weak...)
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 02.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Well, we've prepared the medicine. We might as well try it.
:{{Black Screen|With your help, Eide feeds the newly made medicine to the hilichurl.}}
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 03.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Caribert? It's me... It's your father. Caribert?
:{{DIcon}} Anything?
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 04.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Caribert... Please, say something.
:'''Caribert:''' ...
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 05.ogg}} '''Eide:''' I'm sorry I couldn't be at your side when you were born... and that I failed to reach you and mama in time when you both were suffering...
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 06.ogg}} '''Eide:''' But I'm here now. Papa's been by your side all these years. I've never left you. Not once.
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 07.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Are you still angry with me, Caribert?
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 08.ogg}} '''Eide:''' I know you're awake now... Do you not want to talk to me?
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 09.ogg}} '''Eide:''' I'm so sorry, Caribert. Forgive me, please! Say something. Anything!
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 10.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Please... please...
:{{DIcon}} Eide, stop...
:{{DIcon}} It didn't work.
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 11.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Aah!
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 12.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Gods above! What more do you want from me!?
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 13.ogg}} '''Eide:''' You took everything from here, and I still bowed to you!
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 14.ogg}} '''Eide:''' I'd give you my very life if only you cared to take it! But you won't even let me die!
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 15.ogg}} '''Eide:''' ...I knew it. I should never have trusted anything that had to do with the gods. I was just deluding myself...
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 16.ogg}} '''Eide:''' The gods of this world have never stood with humanity... Not even for a moment!
:{{DIcon}} Calm down, Eide.
:{{DIcon}} There might be other reasons it didn't work.
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 17.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Other reasons... What do you mean?
:{{DIcon}} Such as... who knows, perhaps the dosage was too low.
:{{DIcon}} Or maybe it takes a full course of treatment.
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 18.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Huh... you really think so...?
:{{DIcon}} You have to exhaust all options...
:{{DIcon}} Unless you are ready to give up on Caribert...
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 19.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Give up? No, no. Never! ...Yes, you're right. I cannot let myself wallow in despair.
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 20.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Even if I must stay here with him for... fifty years? A hundred? What difference does it make? I do not lack for time...
:{{DIcon}} That's the spirit.
:{{DIcon}} I'll keep helping you.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (To have infinite time, yet no hope... can only be called torture.)
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 21.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Let's go. We'll make another dose.
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 22.ogg}} '''Eide:''' The most crucial ingredient in this medicine is the unusual mushroom, which makes things complicated... but not impossible.
:{{DIcon}} Where did you get those mushrooms from, anyway?
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 23.ogg}} '''Eide:''' I grow them. In that field.
:{{DIcon}} Wait, in a field? Like a crop?
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 24.ogg}} '''Eide:''' ...The details don't matter, right? Curb your curiosity and just do as I instruct &mdash; if you truly wish to help me, that is how you can do it.
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{DIcon}} Fine.
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 25.ogg}} '''Eide:''' There is a waterfall near the statue I prayed at. I need you to collect some water from there around two in the afternoon.
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 26.ogg}} '''Eide:''' I'll be here watching Caribert. Once you're back, I will make some fertilizer for the mushrooms.
:{{DIcon}} Got it.
:{{A|vo szaq202 12 eide 27.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Good. Then please head over when the time comes.
:{{Black Screen|Time passes quickly. Before you know it, it is two in the afternoon...}}
;(Talk to Eide again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog szaq202 eide 03.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Please fetch the water. I'll be waiting here.
----
;(Approach Eide after collecting the water)
:{{A|vo szaq202 14 eide 01.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Ah, you're back. Caribert's condition is stable...
:{{A|vo szaq202 14 eide 02.ogg}} '''Eide:''' By which I mean... he still isn't responding.
:{{A|vo szaq202 14 eide 03.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Anyway. Give me the water.
:;(Submit {{Item|Strange Mushroom-Watering Water}})
:{{Black Screen|Eide carefully waters his field...}}
:{{A|vo szaq202 14 eide 04.ogg}} '''Eide:''' I need you to stand guard here for a while. Whatever you do, don't let any Forest Rangers approach the house. Understand?
:{{DIcon}} Of course...
:{{DIcon}} Your secret is safe with me.
:{{A|vo szaq202 14 eide 05.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Good. I'll be back soon, the fertilizer won't take but a moment to make.
:{{Black Screen|You wait in the field for Eide to return. After a while...}}
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Monsters! And so many of them... It looks like they're coming for this field...)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (Does watering the field somehow attract monsters? Hmm, better fend them off.)

;(After defeating the Fungi)
:{{A|vo szaq202 15 eide 01.ogg}} '''Eide:''' What happened? Was it monsters?
:{{A|vo szaq202 15 eide 02.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Thank goodness you were here. I couldn't have taken them on all by myself... I'd have to hide and wait until they were gone.
:{{A|vo szaq202 15 eide 03.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Oh yes &mdash; I've got the fertilizer. The effects can take some time to kick in, so let's get on with it.
:{{Black Screen|Eide spreads the fertilizer evenly. Before long, the elemental energy within starts to take effect...}}
:{{A|vo szaq202 15 eide 04.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Next, we pick the mushrooms and repeat the same steps as before to make another dose. I trust you still remember the method?

;(Talk to Eide again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog szaq202 eide 04.ogg}} '''Eide:''' *sigh* I suppose I will soon have to visit the Statue of The Seven once more...

;(Approach Eide after crafting the Nameless Taboo Medicine of the Royal Court)
:{{A|vo szaq202 17 eide 01.ogg}} '''Eide:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Eide, the medicine's ready.
:{{DIcon}} Hey, stop daydreaming...
:{{A|vo szaq202 17 eide 02.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Oh! Uh, sorry, I just... After resting in this field for a while, my thoughts began to wander...
:{{A|vo szaq202 17 eide 03.ogg}} '''Eide:''' I have been so very weary, for many years... if only I could fall asleep here in this field, and never wake up again...
:{{DIcon}} But though the curse denies you even this...
:{{DIcon}} You still have Caribert.
:{{A|vo szaq202 17 eide 04.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Hehe, I do indeed, that's why it was just a fleeting thought... Thank you for your help once again. Now for the final step... Back to the Statue of The Seven.
----
;(Approach the Statue of The Seven)
:{{A|vo szaq202 18 eide 01.ogg}} '''Eide:''' We're here. Let's begin...
:;(Eide notices a Hilichurl walking below)
:{{A|vo szaq202 18 eide 02.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Wait a moment... Hey, what was that? ...Caribert?
:{{DIcon}} What!?
:{{DIcon}} He left the house?
:{{A|vo szaq202 18 eide 03.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Oh no... He must have left while we were too busy preparing the medicine to notice...
:{{A|vo szaq202 18 eide 04.ogg}} '''Eide:''' Come on! We have to catch up with him!

:{{A|vo dialog szaq202 hajjan 01.ogg}} '''Hajjan:''' The ecological issues in this area require further observation and analysis...
:{{A|vo dialog szaq202 fateh 01.ogg}} '''Fateh:''' You scholars and your big words... You know what would really impress me? Fixing the humidity in this forest...
:{{A|vo dialog szaq202 fateh 02.ogg}} '''Fateh:''' My whole family's having a hard time with this climate... Seriously, all my old injuries are acting up.
