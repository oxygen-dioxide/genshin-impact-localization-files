|description    = A feeding trough full to the brim, crafted from durable Flammabomb Wood, traditionally used by the people of Natlan for feeding various large creatures. Whether Saurian companions or Alpacas, such creatures have always been the tribe's most indispensable and powerful labor force. In the past, ensuring that these creatures were well fed symbolized a prosperous year ahead, and this necessity evolved into a ceremonial practice over time. Even today, all throughout Natlan, feeding troughs are always kept full &mdash; a gesture to ensure perpetual abundance and prosperity.
