|description    = A lush and lovely sakura that blooms at spring's beginning in classic "ikkonzome" pink. Legend has it that these sakura were once used as a very precious dye that required the collected essence of a hundred sakura trees just to make one kimono. Such an article of clothing was once worth more than precious gems.<br>Fortunately, Her Excellency, the [[Almighty Ogosho]], thought little of what mortals might consider "high-class," and set forth a decree ordering sakura trees be protected from being used as dye-making material. Such was for the best: a lovely sight for all to behold is far more practical than a bit more opulence adorning some high-official's body, after all.
