|description    = A lush and lovely sakura that blooms at spring's beginning in classic "ikkonzome" pink. Legend has it that these sakura were once used as a very precious dye that required the collection of the essence of a hundred sakura trees just to make one kimono. Such clothing were once worth more than precious gems.<br />Fortunately, Her Excellency the Almighty Ogosho thought little of what mortals might consider "high-class," and she set forth a decree for sakura trees to be protected from being used as material for dye-making. And that was for the best: a lovely scene that all may see is far more practical than the opulent clothes on some high official's back, after all.
