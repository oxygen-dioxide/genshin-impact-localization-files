|text      = Hmph, [[Navia]] keeps bringing up her adventures with you in the fairytale world of "[[Simulanka]]" lately. It's been long since I last traveled anywhere, and her stories are making me itch for a trip.

Fortunately enough, I've just wrapped up the recent outfit orders, so it's about the perfect time for me to head outside, take a break, and seek inspiration. Perhaps you'd care to come along? Just so you know, there's no need to prepare much, since I prefer more spontaneous trips.

Oh, and I heard you're planning to set off to [[Natlan]] soon? Is it really true that there are many hot springs there? What kind of clothes do the [[Saurian]]s in Natlan wear? I have so many questions that I would love to have answers to. So, after you return, let's find a quiet restaurant and chat while we unwind together.
