==Trivia==
===Etymology===
*Like the other Six Darshans, the name "Rtawahist" is derived from one of the six {{w|Zoroastianism|Zoroastrian}} deities collectively known as the {{w|Amesha Spenta}}. {{w|Asha}} (or Arta), also known as Asha Vahista (Avestan for "Best Truth") and as Ashawahist in Middle Persian, is both a concept and a deity. While the concept is difficult to translate into other languages, it can be understood as a universal, fundamental truth which then writes reality and has an inherent moral quality.
