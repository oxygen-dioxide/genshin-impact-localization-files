|text      = When you used to come find me, I'd joke that you needed to make an appointment first. Now, it's my turn to book some of your time.

I remember you have plans to go to Fontaine, and today's the perfect opportunity for us to find a quiet place for me to tell you all about Fontaine's laws! It wouldn't do if you get careless once you get there, end up breaking some law, get arrested by the Maison Gardiennage, and then get sent to the Fortress of Meropide! Once that happens, even if you want me to be your attorney, it'll be too late, you know!

Though, on the other hand, you're usually pretty law-abiding, aren't you? Maybe I'm just worrying about nothing?

Anyway, just think of it as keeping me company. I've attached the deposit, so I'll be expecting you!
