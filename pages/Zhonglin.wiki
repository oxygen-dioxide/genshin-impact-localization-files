==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Zhonglin:''' Hi there! No, that seat's not taken. Please, feel free to sit with me.
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Zhonglin:''' My name is Zhonglin. I'm a traveling merchant from... Hmm, am I from [[Qingce Village]] or from [[Liyue Harbor|the city]]? I don't know which one counts as home!
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about your business.
:::'''Zhonglin:''' My business? I'm just a small-time vendor. I pick up the few little bits of business that slip through the hands of those Liyue tycoons, the [[Qixing]].
:::'''Zhonglin:''' As a traveling merchant, you can't possibly make good money from selling general goods you'd find in a store. You have to focus on more niche items.
:::'''Zhonglin:''' These mushrooms are from [[Sumeru]], for example. I'll bet you've never seen them before.
:::{{DIcon|Reward}} Is there something special about mushrooms from Sumeru?
::::'''Zhonglin:''' Oh... I'm not really the right person to ask. I'm no expert in plants.
::::'''Zhonglin:''' They don't look much different on the outside... Maybe they have a unique taste or something?
::::'''Zhonglin:''' How about this: You take this one back with you and put it in your next dish. If the dish turns out well, put in a good word for me with all your acquaintances! Hahaha...
:::;(Obtain [[Mushroom]] ×6)
::{{DIcon}} Tell me about your home.
:::'''Zhonglin:''' My wife lives in the city, while my daughter lives with her grandparents &mdash; my parents &mdash; in Mt. Qingce.
:::'''Zhonglin:''' So what does that make me? Good question. I'm not sure I have a good answer.
:::'''Zhonglin:''' Speaking of origins... Where do you come from?
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Zhonglin:''' Goodbye. I hope next time we meet you'll become a customer!

==Trivia==
* Zhonglin leaves a message on the [[Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board#Zhonglin's Message|Wangshu Inn Bulletin Board]], advertising his goods. A reply to his posting indicates that someone from Qingce Village has passed through the area.
