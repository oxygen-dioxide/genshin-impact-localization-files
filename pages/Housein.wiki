==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Housein:''' It takes courage to maintain a peaceful life too.
:{{DIcon}} Did you run into some trouble?
::'''Housein:''' No, no. It was just a thought.
::'''Housein:''' I used to be a sailor. I've seen every kind of storm you could imagine, and not even a shipwreck could get the better of me.
::'''Housein:''' The way I see it, gales and tidal waves are nothing compared to always trying to keep steady in life.
::'''Housein:''' I guess what I'm trying to say is, planting a seed is easy, but raising that little sapling into a mighty tree is where the real work lies...
::'''Housein:''' But don't let my brother [[Hassan]] hear that, or he'll start lecturing me again for being ungrateful, haha.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} It does sound a little...
:::'''Housein:''' Really?
:::'''Housein:''' You wouldn't think so if a [[Sumeru Akademiya|Mahamata]] kept asking you to move the stall here and there until you found a place that "doesn't affect the image of the city"...
:::'''Housein:''' In that case, even the experience of surviving ten shipwrecks wouldn't help so much.
::;(Obtain [[Adventurer's Experience]] ×4)
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Housein:''' See you.
