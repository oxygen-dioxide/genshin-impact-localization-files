:{{A|VO Housein All Schemes to Know 01.ogg}} '''Housein:''' (By the Dendro Archon, please don't make me move my stall again.)

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Housein:''' It takes courage to maintain a peaceful life too.
:{{DIcon}} Did you run into some trouble?
::'''Housein:''' No, no. It was just a thought.
::'''Housein:''' I used to be a sailor. I've seen every kind of storm you could imagine, and not even a shipwreck could get the better of me.
::'''Housein:''' The way I see it, gales and tidal waves are nothing compared to always trying to keep steady in life.
::'''Housein:''' I guess what I'm trying to say is, planting a seed is easy, but raising that little sapling into a mighty tree is where the real work lies...
::'''Housein:''' But don't let my brother [[Hassan]] hear that, or he'll start lecturing me again for being ungrateful, haha.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} It does sound a little...
:::'''Housein:''' Really?
:::'''Housein:''' You wouldn't think so if a [[Sumeru Akademiya|Mahamata]] kept asking you to move the stall here and there until you found a place that "doesn't affect the image of the city"...
:::'''Housein:''' In that case, even the experience of surviving ten shipwrecks wouldn't help so much.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Adventurer's Experience|x=4}})
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Housein:''' See you.
{{Dialogue End}}

==Event Dialogue==
===Chromatic Ode of Candies and Roses===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Housein:''' Everyone said that promotional events would bring in more customers. That's true enough.
:'''Housein:''' But tricks like that are really only good for getting everyone into the holiday mood. Much better to just keep your prices stable and sell higher volumes with lower profit margins.
:'''Housein:''' Dendro Archon, please bless our business going forward. Let our business be even more smooth and stable, let there be no setbacks...
:{{DIcon}} Did you run into some trouble?
:;(Same as above)
:{{DIcon}} See you.
:;(Same as above)
