==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Namaka:''' Hello there. This pool has been specially set up for [[Koholasaurus|Koholasaurs]], so the water might be a bit hot for humans.
:{{DIcon}} Thanks for the reminder.
::'''Namaka:''' Don't worry about it!
::'''Namaka:''' Actually, it's not that humans aren't allowed in at all. After all, it's an artificial hot spring, and it won't burn you to a crisp like a natural one would.
::'''Namaka:''' But as you can see, there's not much space around here, and building a hot spring somewhere far away from a natural water source is quite a hassle.
::'''Namaka:''' So we've all come to a tacit agreement to give these Saurians a bit of space. They enjoy rolling around and resting here, plus they're not running around fighting or causing havoc.
::'''Namaka:''' Would you like to hang out with them? You're free to do so, but I wouldn't recommend getting in any water fights, and you mustn't cause a nuisance for anyone else nearby.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Namaka:''' Alright, please take care that you don't slip.
