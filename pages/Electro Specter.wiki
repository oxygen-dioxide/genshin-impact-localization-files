|name_3 = Blitz Bump

|name_4 = Zip Zap Bash

|name_5 = Final Burst
|desc_5 = Explodes after a short pause when defeated dealing '''62.5% ATK''' as  {{Color|Electro DMG}}. If at max Fury, it will follow the player before it explodes, dealing '''75% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.

===AI Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Certain abilities with extra trigger conditions may defy regular ability logic.

{{Description|A monster born from hightly-concentrated Electro elements that can float in the air.<br>A certain researcher once studied these creatures. He believed they must be [[Hypostases]] of some kind. After all, both had elemental peculiarties and were birthed from areas saturated with elemental energy, right? By the way, he was later investigated for academic corruption.|[[Archive]]}}
