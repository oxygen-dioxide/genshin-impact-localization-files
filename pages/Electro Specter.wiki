{{Description|A monster born from hightly-concentrated Electro elements that can float in the air.<br />A certain researcher once studied these creatures. He believed they must be [[Hypostases]] of some kind. After all, both had elemental peculiarties and were birthed from areas saturated with elemental energy, right? By the way, he was later investigated for academic corruption.|[[Archive]]}}

==Abilities and Attacks==
*'''Fury:''' Taking high DMG from a single attack will charge Fury. The higher the DMG dealt, the more Fury will be accumulated. When they have a full Fury bar, they will grow bigger and gain access to enhanced attacks.<table class="fandom-table"><tr><th>DMG Taken (%Max HP)</th><th>Fury Accumulated (%)</th></tr><tr><td>18.75-31.25</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>31.25-43.75</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>43.75-56.25</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>56.25+</td><td>100</td></tr></table>
*'''Thunderstrike:''' Floats a bit before summoning three lightning bolts to strike down around the player, each dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.
*'''Blitz Bump:''' Spins and charges towards the player in a shaky manner, dealing '''125% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}}.
*'''Zip Zap Bash:''' Zips about a few times, dealing '''30% ATK''' as {{Color|Electro DMG}} to players caught in its electricity, before slamming downwards dealing '''200% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}. This attack will only occur at max Fury and will be the only attack it uses in that state.
*'''Final Burst:''' Explodes after a short pause when defeated dealing '''125% ATK''' as  {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}. If at max Fury, it will follow the player before it explodes, dealing '''150% ATK''' as  {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}}.

===Ability Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if they meet all of the following conditions:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Certain abilities with extra trigger conditions may defy regular ability logic.
