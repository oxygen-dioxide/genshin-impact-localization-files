==Profile==
Amina is the current chief of the [[People of the Springs]], having succeeded her grandfather as chief after his death. Despite her appearance, Amina claims that she is far more serious compared to other members of the tribe, who are generally known to be rather carefree.

After the [[Pilgrimage of the Return of the Sacred Flame]] resulted in Mualani being eliminated from participating in the [[Night Warden Wars]], she offered to bring the [[Traveler]] to her tribe, which they accepted. They ran into Amina, along with [[Marokau]] and [[Hikueru]], who wanted to surprise [[Atea]] with a party. Mualani offered to assist, and the surprise party was set up, but had to be postponed until the next day as Atea was participating in nightly patrols. The following day, the tribe was attacked by the Abyss despite her preparations, but the attack was repulsed with no casualties. Eventually, Atea passed away due to abyssal contamination, and Amina was one of the few who knew that she had died.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Home of the Hot Springs}}</ref>

Sometime after the attack, Amina became aware of scammers attempting to lure people to a "mysterious island." She was ashamed of their actions, but was unable to convict them as the scammers could claim that the Mora they swindled was used for travel costs, and anyone she would send to them would likely be recognized. With the Traveler and Paimon being outliers, she decided to have them lure the scammers out, giving her a bag of [[Amina's Coin Pouch|coins]] that had special marks on them. The Traveler and Paimon managed to catch the scammer, [[Kaulu]], who had claimed innocence. However, Amina had him searched and they discovered her Mora, asking how he had his hands on her Mora if he did not take it. As Kaulu was taken away, Amina thanked the two for their efforts and [[Amina's Compensation|compensated]] them.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Legend of the Mysterious Island}}</ref>

When the Abyss attacked Natlan again, Amina oversaw defense efforts for her tribe. She survived the battle, though she mourned the massive casualties, hoping that they were in the same place Atea had gone to.

Upon learning that the Traveler would be accompanying Mavuika to the Night Kingdom to end the war, Amina decided to hold a sending-off feast before they did so. She had Mualani and [[Kachina]] inform the Traveler of the invitation, while [[Kinich]] delivered supplies for the party. However, the amount of well-wishers were far greater than the people attending, causing her to get a headache, as supplies would be needlessly wasted when people were in need of them. The Traveler decided to have Mavuika tag along, and she was surprised to see her. After complaining about logistics problems, Paimon asked about Atea, only to be informed that she had died sometime after the attack on her tribe. Mualani perked the group back up, and Mavuika told Amina that all well-wishers and caravans should attend the feast; any leftovers would be purchased by the Speaker's Chamber to be redistributed. Amina thanked Mavuika for her assistance and left reenergized.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|As the Sun Rises and Sets}}</ref>

Amina, along with the other chiefs, later made their way to the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]] to convey their blessings to the Traveler and Mavuika. The two later emerged victorious, and Amina thanked them for saving the nation from the Abyss.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|When All Becomes a Monument}}</ref>

{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Amina:''' Nice weather we're having, eh? Have you had a hot spring bath today?
:{{DIcon}} Tell me a little about yourself...
::'''Amina:''' I'm Amina, the chief of the People of the Springs.
::'''Amina:''' Hey, what's with that shocked face? I'm doing my job with all seriousness, mind you!
::'''Amina:''' Know this &mdash; seriousness is a rare virtue among us.
::'''Amina:''' The other are either still bathing, or on their way to take a bath.
::'''Amina:''' If you find someone lazing about without awareness of the situation, just come find me. I'll take responsibility as chief!
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Reliable indeed.
:::'''Amina:''' And I'm not just bragging, y'hear? If you come up with any comments or suggestions while having fun here in our land, feel free to tell me any time.
:::'''Amina:''' Who knows? We might have already exactly what you're looking for by the time you come back around.
:::'''Amina:''' By the way, do take these souvenirs with you as mementos of your time here.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Sprayfeather Gill|x=2}})
:{{DIcon}} Hello there, Amina. ''(Available after completing Step 3 of ''[[Home of the Hot Springs]]'')''
::'''Amina:''' Hehe, here to see me, are you?
::'''Amina:''' Everything's going great here. No accidents reported, and the kids have... mostly stopped throwing stones into the hot springs...
::'''Amina:''' Forget it. No point dwelling on sad affairs. As my grandfather said, positivity should be our guiding star!
::'''Amina:''' In truth... I've been pretty busy lately, designing a new stage, reinforcing patrols, and such.
::'''Amina:''' A crazy amount of ideas have been coming to mind, to be honest. I'm just hoping [[Manua]] doesn't come up with any more!
::'''Amina:''' Ah, right! While I'm sure [[Mualani]] would invite you over anyway, let me just say: Don't forget to swing by often!
:{{DIcon}} How have you been lately? ''(Available after completing ''[[The Rainbow Destined to Burn]]'')''
::'''Amina:''' Thanks for asking. With everyone's help, I'm sure it'll all start taking a turn for the better.
::'''Amina:''' After the war ended, many people were gone... I just hope they all went to the same place as Auntie Atea. The more the merrier, after all!
::'''Amina:''' ...Sorry, that probably sounds a bit naive. But I really believe that people from Natlan will be reunited in the [[Night Kingdom]] after they've passed.
::'''Amina:''' This explains how [[Ancient Name]]s are forged from the memories of heroes and passed down through the ages.
:{{DIcon}} I'll go take a dip shortly.
::'''Amina:''' That's what I'm talking about!

''Available one-time-only the first time she is talked to after completing [[Home of the Hot Springs]]''
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Amina:''' Atea... is an elder I deeply respect.
:'''Amina:''' After my grandfather died, the elders voted for me to become the chief of our tribe.
:'''Amina:''' I always have a lot of new and crazy ideas, so everyone believed I could lead our tribe towards a different kind of future.
:'''Amina:''' For a long time, though, I had no idea what to do.
:'''Amina:''' But, Atea was always there to encourage me. Even when I made mistakes, she never made me feel bad for messing up. She'd help me analyze what went wrong and help me do better next time.
:'''Amina:''' She's someone I really respect, so... I'll remember what she taught me, and work hard to become the chief our tribe deserves.
