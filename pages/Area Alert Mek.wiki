==Descriptions==
{{Description|A mechanism that is able to fire out the energy produced by an annihilation reaction. Strictly speaking, it was originally a test device that emerged from [[Alain Guillotin|research]] undertaken by the [[Institute of Natural Philosophy]] before the [[Fontaine Research Institute]] had been established.<br>As such, despite its considerable commercial success as a sentinel and defensive device, most engineers do not consider it to be a true clockwork meka.|[[Archive]]}}
