:'''Lelienne:''' Hey there, friend! Want to change your life?
:{{DIcon}} What are you talking about?
::'''Lelienne:''' You might find this hard to imagine, but many people in this world would love a chance to restart their lives.
::'''Lelienne:''' But a little change to one's appearance can halve the difficulty &mdash; and that's my specialty, see?
::'''Lelienne:''' There's a bright future ahead for this sort of research, and you look like the sort of person with an eye on the future, so, would you consider sponsoring me?
::'''Lelienne:''' I'm a proper engineer from the Fontaine Research Institute, you know? ... Well, I was, anyway.
::{{DIcon}} That sounds suspicious. What happened? Tell me the truth.
::'''Lelienne:''' Alright, alright. Gah, it really does seem like I've got no talent for pulling in investors...
::'''Lelienne:''' But I really was an engineer at the Institute once, and it was my goal to use machines to pursue the apex of aesthetics.
::'''Lelienne:''' But an... accident happened, resulting in some damage to one of my colleagues' appearance.
::'''Lelienne:''' And when I returned from my stint at the [[Fortress of Meropide]], I started living here.
::'''Lelienne:''' They told me that Fleuve Cendre was a bit of a gray area, and that I might be able to secure some funding here.
::'''Lelienne:''' But as it turns out, that's not the case at all! The [[Spina di Rosula]] watches everyone here like hawks, you see...
:{{DIcon}} I'm fine, thank you.
::'''Lelienne:''' Alright, looks like my pitch didn't work out... again...
