===Clear Out Nearby Enemies===
;(Talk to Huai'an)
:'''Huai'an:''' *sigh* It's just one thing after another...
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
:'''Huai'an:''' This location... It's a real challenge to run an inn here.
:'''Huai'an:''' It could just be me, but I feel like we're seeing more and more monsters around these parts recently.
:'''Huai'an:''' They wouldn't dare come anywhere near the inn itself, but guests need to get in and out and the [[Millelith]] can't be here all the time.
:'''Huai'an:''' If you're free, do you think you could take a look around and clear out any monsters nearby?
:{{DIcon}} Okay.
::'''Huai'an:''' Haha... Ah, I must say I do find your forthrightness refreshing...
:{{DIcon}} This issue seems self-inflicted...
::'''Huai'an:''' Yes, we should've known what we were getting into when we chose the location.
::'''Huai'an:''' But then, where would passing travelers stay if it weren't for us?
::'''Huai'an:''' It's a tiring job, but a necessary one.
:'''Huai'an:''' Speaking of tiring jobs... I do feel bad making you do this.
:'''Huai'an:''' But I promise I will make it worth your time.
:'''Huai'an:''' Best of luck, and thank you.

;(Talk to Huai'an again)
:'''Huai'an:''' How's it coming along? All clear?
:{{DIcon}} Not yet.
:'''Huai'an:''' Okay. Well, take your time. These monsters may be no end of trouble to people coming and going, but they wouldn't dare set foot in the inn itself.
:'''Huai'an:''' And in the highly unlikely event that a few of the gutsier ones did venture inside... I'm sure I could, ahem, persuade them to leave. My guests' safety would not be at risk.
:'''Huai'an:''' No one runs an inn this far out of town unless they know a bit of self-defense!
----
;(Report back to Huai'an)
:'''Huai'an:''' How's it coming along? All clear?
:{{DIcon}} All clear.
:'''Huai'an:''' Great. Thanks a lot.
:'''Huai'an:''' Here's your payment.
:'''Huai'an:''' These days, honestly... If I hadn't done martial arts since I was a kid, I wouldn't dream about working in the hospitality sector.

===Clear the Road for an Incoming Food Delivery===
;(Talk to Huai'an)
:'''Huai'an:''' This is becoming an absolute nightmare...
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
:'''Huai'an:''' I haven't slept properly in days... See the dark circles under my eyes?
:'''Huai'an:''' Have you met any of the guests? They're a handful, to say the least. A brand-new crisis with each one. One of them actually jumped from the top of the building. A building this high. What were they thinking!?
:'''Huai'an:''' But never mind that. Right now, I'm waiting on a food delivery from the city, it should be here soon.
:'''Huai'an:''' There are monsters on the road though, and they're sure to stir up trouble. Could I trouble you to get rid of them for me?
:{{DIcon}} Okay.
::'''Huai'an:''' Thanks.
:{{DIcon}} It's like this place is cursed...
::'''Huai'an:''' Well... When your doors are open to travelers from all over the world, expect a world's worth of baggage... That's what I like to say.
::'''Huai'an:''' We can manage though. It's just an inn that's a bit further out and a bit busier than most.
::'''Huai'an:''' I appreciate your help. Thanks, and good luck.

;(Talk to Huai'an again)
:'''Huai'an:''' How's it coming along? All clear?
:{{DIcon}} Not yet.
:'''Huai'an:''' Okay, please be as quick as you can. The chef has run out of supplies.
:'''Huai'an:''' I could go and sort it myself if it came to it, but that's a last resort.
----
;(Report back to Huai'an)
:'''Huai'an:''' How's it coming along? All clear?
:{{DIcon}} All clear.
:'''Huai'an:''' Great. Thanks a lot.
:'''Huai'an:''' Here's your payment. If you're ever in the area again, feel free to stop by anytime.

===Clear Out the Monsters Before "He" Can===
;(Talk to Huai'an)
:'''Huai'an:''' *sigh* Whatever am I going to do...
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
:'''Huai'an:''' This location... It's a real challenge to run an inn here.
:'''Huai'an:''' Dihua Marsh means lots of Silvergrass, and where treasure lies, monsters will follow.
:'''Huai'an:''' We're lucky that the Millelith cleared most of them out of the area. Since then it's mostly been fine.
:'''Huai'an:''' But inexplicably, they seem to have made something of a resurgence recently.
:'''Huai'an:''' I know they would never come anywhere near the inn, but there's no denying they're an eyesore. And if even I think so, I can guarantee my customers will too.
:'''Huai'an:''' Are you free to help? It would be great if you could deal with any nearby monsters for me.
:{{DIcon}} Okay.
::'''Huai'an:''' Haha... Ah, I must say I do find your forthrightness refreshing...
:{{DIcon}} You're stressing out over an eyesore!?
::'''Huai'an:''' Frankly, yes, their irksome presence is the biggest problem they pose.
::'''Huai'an:''' But some people, such as a certain [[Xiao|young gentleman]] obsessed with peace and quiet, find that simply intolerable. And when something upsets him, it usually ends up upsetting the rest of Dihua Marsh too...
:'''Huai'an:''' Anyway. I'm not exactly thrilled to be begging a guest for help like this.
:'''Huai'an:''' But please be assured that you will be well compensated for your trouble.
:'''Huai'an:''' Best of luck, and thank you.

;(Talk to Huai'an again)
:'''Huai'an:''' How's it coming along? All clear?
:{{DIcon}} Not yet.
:'''Huai'an:''' Alright, well there's no rush. They tend to keep their distance so they don't pose a huge threat.
:'''Huai'an:''' But if one of the blind ones happened to lose its way and end up disrupting that young gentleman's peace and quiet...
:'''Huai'an:''' It might well plunge all of Dihua Marsh into a mad panic. More to the point, the inn would see no business until things finally quietened down.
----
;(Report back to Huai'an)
:'''Huai'an:''' How's it coming along? All clear?
:{{DIcon}} All clear.
:'''Huai'an:''' Great. Thanks a lot.
:'''Huai'an:''' As promised, here's your payment.
:'''Huai'an:''' Fingers crossed we're in the clear for a while now...
:'''Huai'an:''' Pardon? Who's the young gentleman? ...That's a question for the [[Verr Goldet|boss]].
