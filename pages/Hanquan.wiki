==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Hanquan:''' How dare a grade seven nobody speak and act so arrogantly...
:{{DIcon}} Grade seven pawn?
::'''Hanquan:''' Martial artists are divided into nine grades. One's the highest, nine the lowest.
::'''Hanquan:''' Now, I was escorting someone from [[Yanshang Teahouse]] to Qiaoying Village two days ago, when I ran into this... mouthy pest!
::'''Hanquan:''' I couldn't stop myself from exchanging a few pointers with him, but what do you know, he was just a worthless grade seven.
::'''Hanquan:''' In the end, the strong keep it on the down low. I don't know why those clowns are so fond of acting out.
::{{DIcon}} And just who is doing the ranking?
::'''Hanquan:''' Me, of course. I've seen many martial artists in my time, so I've got confidence in my judgment.
::'''Hanquan:''' Let me put it this way. There's an excellent martial artist named [[Huangshan]] who can be found on the trade routes linking Liyue and [[Mondstadt]]. She's barely a grade three.
::'''Hanquan:''' [[Sun Yu]], a [[Guhua Clan|Guhua]] Disciple, wields a swift and sharp sword, and he'd be a grade two.
::'''Hanquan:''' A grade one, then, has to be an absolute master.
::'''Hanquan:''' In my opinion, Branch Master [[Lan]] of the Adventurers' Guild would count.
::{{DIcon}} What grade are you?
:::'''Hanquan:''' As for me, my skill is still lacking. You can consider me a grade three.
::{{DIcon}} What grade is [[Yelan]]?
:::'''Hanquan:''' Huh. How did you know our boss' name?
:::'''Hanquan:''' As far as I know, she's gentle, refined, and capable of resolving problems with just a few words. I've never seen her fight anyone.
:::'''Hanquan:''' But can you really rate those who never fight? Would they even reach grade nine? Hmm...
::{{DIcon}} What grade am I?
:::'''Hanquan:''' If I'm being honest, I've never heard of you...
:::'''Hanquan:''' But based on your bright gaze and long breaths, you must be a grade two at least.
:::{{DIcon}} At a bare minimum, I'm the highest grade!
:::'''Hanquan:''' You really don't hold back, huh?
:::'''Hanquan:''' I'd hope to see a few of your moves one day, should fate permit.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Hanquan:''' Farewell.
