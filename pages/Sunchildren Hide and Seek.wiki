==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Ion)
:'''Ion:''' Oh ho, Traveler, you look pretty interesting. What say I take a stab at reading your fortune?
:'''Ion:''' I am Ion, after all. I never miss a reading.
:'''Paimon:''' Really?
:'''Paimon:''' You sound like a hustler.
: '''Paimon:''' (Also, Paimon remembers that his tombstone read...)
:'''Ion:''' Oh, come now, what's with that suspicious look? I always read peoples' fortunes.
:'''Ion:''' That said... Few of Byakuyakoku's people have happy fates awaiting them.
:'''Ion:''' So I often cheat them, telling them that their luck will turn.
:'''Ion:''' If nothing else, I think that I can grant them a little happiness that way.
:'''Ion:''' In the end, they said that I couldn't tell fortunes at all. Ah, how saddening.
:'''Paimon:''' Is that how it is?
:'''Ion:''' Well, little one, I'll prove it to you, right now!
:'''Paimon:''' O&mdash;Oh? Sure! Try Paimon on for size!
:'''Ion:''' Hmm, alright... Let me have a careful go at this... Huh. Why's there so much interference?
:'''Ion:''' Eh!?
:'''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What's wrong?
:'''Ion:''' I... can't read your fortune.
:'''Ion:''' How could that be? I don't get it exactly right most of the time, but I usually don't fail to get a reading at all...
:'''Paimon:''' Well, guess you ain't that good, huh?
:'''Ion:''' It does seem so. It seems that I must continue my studies in earnest.
----
;(Talk to Isumenasu)
:'''Isumenasu:''' Hmm? I've never seen people dressed like you are before.
:'''Isumenasu:''' Are you someone who fell from... that, uh, from beyond the skies?
:'''Isumenasu:''' So! The world does not end with our glorious nation! Well, then. Surrender your maps to me for my perusal.
:{{DIcon}} (You give him your map...)
:'''Isumenasu:''' Ah, how very intricate. Not only are the landforms accurately drawn, but even the paths of the mountains and rivers can be seen.
:'''Isumenasu:''' Well, then. How large is this nation you call "Teyvat"? How does it measure up to Byakuyakoku?
:'''Paimon:''' Teyvat's a whole continent...
:'''Paimon:''' Also, Enkanomiya... That is, Byakuyakoku, is this small patch on the south end of the map.
:'''Isumenasu:''' Nonsense! Our lands are vast and broad! How can they occupy but such a puny space?
:'''Isumenasu:''' This map may seem exquisitely drawn, but is in truth an errant fraud. Away, away with it!
:'''Isumenasu:''' To think I had even a moment of admiration for this cheap charlatanry, to the defilement of mine eyes!
:'''Paimon:''' Well, suit yourself, kiddo!
----
;(Talk to Orupeusu)
:'''Orupeusu:''' *sigh* So you are the traveler from afar...
:'''Orupeusu:''' What are you pursuing? The sight of you coming this way was grievous to watch.
:'''Paimon:''' Grief? What's there to be sad about?
:'''Orupeusu:''' For a singer of songs, everything in this world is worth grieving.
:'''Orupeusu:''' Where there are meetings, there must be partings, and those who are born will one day return to the earth...
:'''Orupeusu:''' Reunions are too brief to salve the pain of long separations... And as for you, Traveler...
:'''Orupeusu:''' Only those in pursuit of something will journey into another realm as you do.
:'''Orupeusu:''' The locals, who have lived here for a long time, would find such a journey romantic, but for the wayfarer themselves, it may mean unspeakable pain.
:'''Orupeusu:''' If you came in an earlier clime, I might have sung for you.
:'''Orupeusu:''' But I have sworn an oath with someone that I shall not sing again until I hear [[Clymene|her]] voice.
:'''Orupeusu:''' I can only wish you well, though you seem far older than I...
:'''Orupeusu:''' I hope your wish comes true.
----
;(Talk to Piramumon)
:'''Piramumon:''' Oh ho! Judging by your appearance, you must be a traveler from another nation!
:'''Piramumon:''' Where do you hail from?
:'''Paimon:''' We're from [[Mondstadt]].
:'''Piramumon:''' Mondstadt?
:{{Black Screen|You describe the Mondstadt's scenery to Piramumon in a simple manner...}}
:'''Piramumon:''' I've never heard of such a city. To think that there was such a place...
:'''Piramumon:''' Hahaha! It's just as I said, then! The world couldn't possibly only be the size of Byakuyakoku!
:'''Piramumon:''' I mean, if Byakuyakoku were all there was in the world, that would be a most lonely world indeed.
:'''Piramumon:''' The ancient texts also talk about times before our nation was founded. That's when I began to believe that there were lands beyond ours.
:'''Piramumon:''' But I was still scared, you know? Scared that there was really nothing else out there.
:'''Piramumon:''' You have no idea, Traveler, how much your arrival sets my heart at ease. Haha, so there are many more fascinating places to see in this world.
:'''Piramumon:''' It's just a shame that I have this festival called the Rite of Solar Return to attend to.
:'''Piramumon:''' How about this, Traveler? Tell me how you came here.
:'''Piramumon:''' Once the festival has ended, I'll find an opportunity to sneak out of the Dainichi Mikoshi.
:'''Piramumon:''' Let's have some fruit juice together instead! Haha!
----
;(Talk to Rikoru)
:'''Rikoru:''' What? Don't disturb me. I'm thinking...
:'''Rikoru:''' Yes, I'm thinking about something very important!
:'''Paimon:''' What is it?
:'''Rikoru:''' Have you seen that thing they call the [[Dainichi Mikoshi]]?
:'''Rikoru:''' The tallest thing in the whole country.
:'''Rikoru:''' I was thinking about how I can build something even taller than that!
:'''Paimon:''' But it's only so tall so that it can light up Byakuyakoku, right?
:'''Paimon:''' What's the reason for your building being so tall?
:'''Rikoru:''' To display my glory, of course! The glory of Rikoru the Great!
:'''Rikoru:''' That'll show that old man Aberaku who's boss!
:{{DIcon}} You know...
:{{DIcon}} Aberaku?
:'''Rikoru:''' Of course. He built the Dainichi Mikoshi and saved Byakuyakoku. I used to look up to him...
:'''Rikoru:''' But as it turned out, he had designs on the throne. If it wasn't for those adults, I would be dead right now.
:'''Rikoru:''' That's why I will build something taller than the Dainichi Mikoshi.
:'''Paimon:''' H&mdash;How long will that take?
:'''Rikoru:''' Like I care!
:'''Rikoru:''' The people of Byakuyakoku should be happy that I would ask them to build such a historical wonder for me!
:'''Rikoru:''' Alright, then! Stop bothering me!
:'''Rikoru:''' Let me think. If the beams are this long... If we do it that way, the load-bearing and wood joinery...
----
;(Talk to Risutaiosu)
:'''Risutaiosu:''' Stop moving!
:'''Risutaiosu:''' Oh, stop it! Stop, I say! Come on, I told you to stop moving! Didn't you hear me?
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, Paimon can't just stop moving...
:{{DIcon}} Imagine asking Paimon not to move...
:{{DIcon}} Would you fall down, Paimon?
:'''Paimon:''' No way!
:'''Risutaiosu:''' Ugh, alright, turn around then. I have never seen these clothes in my life.
:'''Risutaiosu:''' They're not entirely aesthetically pleasing, but they are somewhat interesting.
:'''Paimon:''' If you don't like 'em, why'd you even look?
:'''Risutaiosu:''' Seriously? Asking those lady retainers to model for me was hardly this difficult.
:'''Risutaiosu:''' That said, I've gotten quite sick of looking at the way our people dress.
:'''Risutaiosu:''' As for what you're wearing, now that's new.
:'''Risutaiosu:''' Hmm, I know. So that's how they put those clothes together... Wow, you outsiders really are shameless.
:'''Risutaiosu:''' I see, I see... So if the clothes are made like that, then the body shape should be like... this!
:'''Paimon:''' What are you doing?
:'''Risutaiosu:''' Making a statue. I mix clay and water, and then I knead them into shape with both hands. It helps to calm me &mdash; it's one of the only things that does.
:'''Risutaiosu:''' And you know what definitely doesn't calm me? Sitting in regular meetings, reading aloud based on material pre-written by those adults.
:'''Risutaiosu:''' Well, whatever. I'm done with your forms as well.
:'''Risutaiosu:''' Now stop bothering me. Go do your own stuff.
----
;(Talk to Surepio)
:'''Surepio:''' Travelers from distant lands... *cough* You seem quite tired.
:'''Surepio:''' That won't do, you know? Many illnesses have their humble beginnings in exhaustion.
:'''Surepio:''' You must ensure that you get enough rest every day, so that you&mdash; *cough*
:'''Surepio:''' *cough* *cough* &mdash;can grow healthily.
:'''Paimon:''' Y'know what, you're not looking too good yourself.
:'''Surepio:''' Ahaha, it is an old malady of mine.
:'''Surepio:''' You must maintain a healthy body to stimulate a healthy soul, Traveler.
:'''Surepio:''' *sigh* If only I had more time. I would become the greatest physician in the world...
:'''Surepio:''' That way, even with this body of mine, I would surely be able to walk out of my room in good health and play to my heart's content.
----
;(After talking to all 7 Sinshades)
:'''Paimon:''' It seems like each of the Sunchildren is pretty different, huh...
:'''Paimon:''' If they had been able to grow up, they might've become pretty cool people. What a pity...
