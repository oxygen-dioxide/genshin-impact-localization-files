{{Location Intro|description=<p>{{If Self|Statue of the Omnipresent God|It|The Statue of the Omnipresent God}} is a statue in front of [[Tenshukaku]] where all the [[Vision]]s taken by the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] are inlaid.</p>}}

After completing {{Quest|Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow}}, a [[Patrol Soldier]] will stop the player from going near the statue.

After completing {{Quest|Omnipresence Over Mortals}}, the Visions were removed from the statue and returned to their respective owners after the [[Traveler]] defeated [[Raiden Shogun|Ei]].

==Trivia==
* The English localization of "Statue of the Omnipresent God" was previously "Statue of the Thousand-Armed, Hundred-Eyed God," which is a direct translation of its Chinese and Japanese names.
* The statue parallels the Great Buddha statue in the real-life {{Lang|{{w|sword hunt}}|ja=刀狩|ja_rm=katanagari}}, which {{w|Toyotomi Hideyoshi}} decreed to be constructed using the nails and clamps forged from confiscated weapons.
* When we arrived in Inazuma, Thoma mentions that the statue is still under construction.<ref>Archon Quest, Chapter II, Act I - The Immovable God and the Eternal Euthymia, Part 4: [[Three Wishes]]</ref>
* The distance between standing on the hands of this statue and sitting on the hands of the [[Anemo Archon Statue]] in Mondstadt is exactly 6666m.
* Itto's Vision was embedded near the bottom of the statue, just above a Pyro Vision belonging to an unknown owner.
* The identity of the statue has been the subject of much debate.
** The statue may simply be a personification of eternity or some other concept, rather than being modeled after a real figure in ''Genshin Impact''. This is similar to how the {{w|Statue of Liberty}} in real life is a personification of the concept of liberty based on the ancient Roman goddess {{w|Libertas}} and is not intended to be seen as a model of a real person.
** In the description for the achievement "[[The Aspirations of All]]," the statue is simply described as "the symbol of Eternity."
