The '''Statue of the Omnipresent God''' is a statue in front of [[Tenshukaku]] where all the [[Vision]]s taken by the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] are inlaid.

It is also known as the {{Lang|'''Statue of the Thousand-Armed, Hundred-Eyed God'''|ja={{Rubi|千|せん|手|じゅ|百|ひゃく|目|もく|神|しん|像|ぞう}}|ja_rm=Senju-Hyakumoku Shinzou}}.

After completing [[Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow]] (Act II of the Inazuma [[Archon Quests|Archon Quest]]) a [[Patrol Soldier]] will stop the player from going near the statue.

After completing [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]] (Act III of the said quest), the [[Visions]] were removed from the statue and returned to their respective owners after the [[Traveler]] defeated [[Raiden Shogun|Ei]].

==Identity==
Based on current knowledge, the statue does not appear to depict any specific or existing deity, unlike how the [[Statue of The Seven]] depict each nation's Archon.

Some clues to its identity include;

*The statue's hair closely resembles that of the [[Blessing of the Welkin Moon|Welkin Moon]] lady, but the Welkin Moon lady lacks wings, hood, and the statue's distinctive amulet
**The statue's hair does not match that of [[Ei|Raiden Ei]], [[Makoto|Raiden Makoto]], or other historical Inazuman figures such as [[Kitsune Saiguu]].
* The pillar the Statue sits on appears to be broken, and resembles non-Inazuman architecture - suggesting the Statue was not built in Inazuma, but moved there from elsewhere. This could suggest the Omnipresent God is not local to Narukami Island, but a being worshipped in other regions of Teyvat as well
**[[Istaroth]] was Worshipped in [[Enkanomiya]] and [[Mondstadt]]

*The statue's moniker of being "Thousand Armed, Hundred Eyed" is likely a reference to the real life {{w|Guanyin|Buddhist bodhisattva Thousand-Armed and Thousand-Eyed Guanyin/Kannon}}, a goddess of mercy
**Istaroth showed mercy to the Enkanomiyans by helping them construct the [[Dainichi Mikoshi|Helios]] even after the other Shades of Phanes abandoned them<ref name="BS&M">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2|Before Sun and Moon}}</ref>

* The statue is strongly associated with Visions, which are near indestructible physical representations of Ambition
**Ei claims she is not responsible for giving out Visions, suggesting Visions may be handed out by even [[Celestia|higher powers]]
**The only Higher Power Ei has shown awareness of is Istaroth<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Radiant Sakura}}</ref>
**Whilst different to Visions, Enkanomiyans believed Sinshades "feelings and memories will forever remain in this world" are created by Istaroth<ref>{{Ref/Loading|Sinshades}}</ref>
*The statue wears an amulet which strongly resembles an [[Eye of the Storm]]. Istaroth is a [[god]] with control over time and wind<ref name="BS&M" />. One of her titles is "the [[Thousand Winds]] of Time"
**During [[Imperatrix Umbrosa Chapter]]: Act II, [[Cecilia|Cecelia Flowers]] are mysteriously shown in one of the cutscenes. Cecelia flowers are associated with Wind and the god Barbatos, who is one of the "[[Thousand Winds]]"

==Trivia==
*The statue parallels the Great Buddha statue in the real-life {{Lang|{{w|sword hunt}}|ja=刀狩|ja_rm=katanagari}}, which {{w|Toyotomi Hideyoshi}} decreed to be constructed using the nails and clamps forged from confiscated weapons.
*In the description for the achievement "[[The Aspirations of All]]," the statue is simply described as "the symbol of Eternity."
*The distance between standing on the hands of this statue and sitting on the hands of the [[Anemo Archon Statue]] in Mondstadt is exactly 6666m.
*[[Arataki Itto|Itto's]] Vision was embedded near the bottom of the statue, just above a Pyro Vision belonging to an unknown owner
