The '''Statue of the Omnipresent God''' is a statue in front of [[Tenshukaku]] where all the [[Vision]]s taken by the [[Vision Hunt Decree]] are inlaid.

It is also known as the {{Lang|'''Statue of the Thousand-Armed, Hundred-Eyed God'''|ja={{Rubi|千|せん|手|じゅ|百|ひゃく|目|もく|神|しん|像|ぞう}}|ja_rm=Senju-Hyakumoku Shinzou}}.

After completing [[Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow]] (Act II of the Inazuma [[Archon Quests|Archon Quest]]) a [[Patrol Soldier]] will stop the player from going near the statue.

After completing [[Omnipresence Over Mortals]] (Act III of the said quest), the [[Visions]] were removed from the statue and returned to their respective owners after the [[Traveler]] defeated [[Raiden Shogun|Ei]].

==Identity==
Unlike how the [[Statue of The Seven]] depict each nation's Archon,  this statue does not match the appearance of any historical or current character whose appearance is currently known.

Notable traits that may give clues to its identity include the following:
* The statue's hair closely resembles that of the character depicted by the [[Blessing of the Welkin Moon]] but additionally has wings and an amulet.
* The pillar the Statue sits on is slightly damaged and does not match Inazuman architecture. This could suggest that part of the statue was moved from elsewhere and/or that the Omnipresent God is not a figure local to Narukami Island.
* The statue wears an amulet which resembles an [[Eye of the Storm]].
* The statue's moniker of being "Thousand Armed, Hundred Eyed" is likely a reference to the real-life figure {{w|Guanyin}}, also known as Kannon in Japan, a Buddhist {{w|bodhisattva}} associated with compassion who has a similar title, "the Thousand-Armed and ''Thousand''-Eyed Guanyin."

==Trivia==
* The statue parallels the Great Buddha statue in the real-life {{Lang|{{w|sword hunt}}|ja=刀狩|ja_rm=katanagari}}, which {{w|Toyotomi Hideyoshi}} decreed to be constructed using the nails and clamps forged from confiscated weapons.
* In the description for the achievement "[[The Aspirations of All]]," the statue is simply described as "the symbol of Eternity."
* The distance between standing on the hands of this statue and sitting on the hands of the [[Anemo Archon Statue]] in Mondstadt is exactly 6666m.
* [[Arataki Itto|Itto]]'s Vision was embedded near the bottom of the statue, just above a Pyro Vision belonging to an unknown owner.
* The identity of the statue has been the subject of much debate.
** The statue may simply be a personification of eternity or some other concept, rather than being modeled after a real figure in ''Genshin Impact''. This is similar to how the {{w|Statue of Liberty}} in real life is a personification of the concept of liberty based off of the ancient Roman goddess {{w|Libertas}} and is not intended to be seen as a model of a real person.
** One figure who the statue may be modeled after is [[Istaroth]].
*** Istaroth is a deity that is known to have been worshipped in other regions in the past: in [[Mondstadt]] long ago and in [[Enkanomiya]] while it was secluded from the outside world. This would explain the pillar that the statue sits on, which is damaged and does not match Inazuman architecture.
**** She is a god with control over time and wind.<ref name="BS&M">{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2|Before Sun and Moon}}</ref> One of her titles is "the Thousand Winds of Time."
**** During the ''[[Time and Wind]]'' World Quest, which is related to Istaroth's legacy in Mondstadt's [[Nameless Island]] and [[Thousand Winds Temple]], a special Eye of the Storm is fought multiple times, and an unknown voice is heard.
*** Ei is aware of Istaroth's existence, as she theorizes Istaroth's "higher power" had a hand in creating the time-defying events experienced by her and the Traveler during ''[[Transient Dreams]]''. This makes it possible for the statue to have been consciously modeled after Istaroth, which would otherwise be unlikely.
*** [[Cecilia]]s are seen in a shattered shard of spacetime while the Traveler is sent to [[End of the Oneiric Euthymia (Quest Domain)|Makoto's realm of consciousness]] by [[Yae Miko]]. Cecilias are normally instead associated with Mondstadt, ruled by the God of Wind [[Barbatos]]. They are only found on [[Starsnatch Cliff]], which is in the vicinity of the Thousand Winds Temple.
*** Istaroth can be associated with compassion, as she is the only deity who did not abandon the people of Enkanomiya when their homeland sank underground.<ref name="BS&M" /> This aligns with the reference to the real life {{w|Guanyin}}, who is associated with compassion.
