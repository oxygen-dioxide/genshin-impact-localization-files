: {{DIcon|Idle}} Which is better...
:: {{A|VO Chan Baatjan 01.ogg}} "It's pointless to argue about which is better."
{{Dialogue End}}

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Chan Baatjan:''' Really good food doesn't need to be ranked. There's no need to feel inferior, but no place for arrogance, either.
:{{DIcon|Reward}} True gourmet cuisine?
::'''Chan Baatjan:''' It seems you are a fellow seeker and lover of the finest cuisine and daintiest of delicacies as well.
::'''Chan Baatjan:''' I am Chan Baatjan. I won't claim to be the best chef in Yilong Wharf, but I have never disrespected the original flavors of my ingredients and always cooked every dish with great care.
::'''Chan Baatjan:''' Unfortunately, I do not often cook anymore, but these days am more akin to a very picky wandering gourmand.
::'''Chan Baatjan:''' Someone who's just busy in the kitchen all day has quite limited influence in the end.
::'''Chan Baatjan:''' Thus, over the past few years, I've taken in a dozen or so students and taught them everything I know.
::'''Chan Baatjan:''' Now, some of them have graduated. The [[Lianfang|owner of Lianfang Dim Sum]] and the head chef for Jiulue Teahouse were both my prized pupils.
::'''Chan Baatjan:''' You should try out their creations. May you find the offerings to your taste!
:;(Obtain {{Item|Tea-Smoked Squab|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} Did you run into some kind of trouble?
::'''Chan Baatjan:''' Thank you for the kind words, my friend.
::'''Chan Baatjan:''' I'm not in trouble or anything. This is just something that's been on my mind.
::'''Chan Baatjan:''' Yilong Wharf faces [[Lumidouce Harbor]], and so we receive a lot of merchants from [[Fontaine]]. In time, this place has become a melting pot of cultures and cuisines.
::'''Chan Baatjan:''' Some chefs had never had Fontainian food, and praised it to the high heavens upon first tasting its novelty.
::'''Chan Baatjan:''' Some chefs grew arrogant, on the other hand, when they saw Fontainian diners loved Liyue's food, so they started claiming that Liyue has the best food anywhere.
::{{DIcon}} What do you think?
::'''Chan Baatjan:''' From my perspective, neither is the right approach. You can substitute Fontainian cuisine for that which comes from other nations, and what I said would still stand.
::'''Chan Baatjan:''' No two people have the same preferences, so there is no single dish that will earn the praise of every single person.
::'''Chan Baatjan:''' It's the same as in literature. What's the point of fighting for the empty title of "the best"?
::'''Chan Baatjan:''' As a chef, one should be humble when looking at new dishes, deconstructing them to learn the ingredients and the skills required to cook them.
::'''Chan Baatjan:''' We should not blindly praise something that wasn't based on local ingredients, or be intentionally conservative, stalling progress thereby.
::'''Chan Baatjan:''' Of course, these are just empty words. All I can do is point this out to my students, so they will always remember that they're chefs who strive to make better dishes.
::'''Chan Baatjan:''' They should also communicate with their colleagues, learning new ideas and doing away with bad ones.
:{{DIcon}} (Leave quietly...)
::'''Chan Baatjan:''' I have to explain this to people at some point...
