* When exposed to the Withering, characters will accumulate Decay. The speed of this accumulation will differ depending on the Withering Zone you're in.
* Depending on how much Decay you have accumulated, all your party members will have their All Elemental RES, Physical RES, and Max HP decreased. These stats will decrease more in accordance with the amount of Decay accrued.
* If you remain within Withering Zones after you fully accumulate Decay, all your party members will fall.
* Destroying the Tumors of the Withering normally can eradicate the Withering nearby. Use [[Candle of Life]] or [[Flame of Life]] to diminish accrued Decay. Attacks by Decay Projectiles or monsters affected by the Withering will induce accelerated accumulation of Decay.

'''The Withering''' is an [[exploration]] mechanic and [[climate]] effect in [[Sumeru]].

See the [https://act.hoyolab.com/ys/app/interactive-map/index.html?lang=en-us#/map/2?shown_types=354&center=3114.00,-3823.00&zoom=-2.00 Teyvat Interactive Map] for their locations.

==History==
The Withering was introduced as a result of [[King Deshret]] introducing forbidden knowledge to his people, causing the land around them to become weakened and affecting all who would wander into one. This disaster was temporarily halted by [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]], although she had lost significant power and was reduced to the size of a child as a result.

While beings can survive in a Withering Zone, the effects are extremely harmful to humans, who require a [[Vision]] to simply resist its power. Even a brief exposure could cause serious effects; [[Rana]], who only spent a few minutes in such a zone, felt sick and exhausted after leaving before falling into a coma that required [[Arana]] to bubble her for her own safety. [[Eleazar]] is the manifestation of the Withering on humans.

Withering Zones are initially created as a Nascent Zone which attracts a small amount of monsters and begins to corrupt the surrounding area. These nascent zones are too young to form Fetid Boughs and Withering Branches and thus can be removed once all the monsters are killed. If they manage to persist, then they begin to form both, grow larger into a tumor, have a larger area of effect and begin to affect people.

The [[Aranara]] call the Withering ''Marana'', which is likely derived from the Sanskrit word {{Lang|''maraṇa''|sa=मरण}} meaning "death" or "killing". They say that Marana has the power to turn ''Vana'' (forest) into ''Valuka'' (desert).<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Arakarman}}</ref> The Withering is also known as The Black Tide.<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Folio of Foliage|1}}</ref>

The Withering re-emerged during the [[Cataclysm]], causing Rukkhadevata to sacrifice herself in order to prevent it from spreading rapidly across Sumeru. Cases of the Withering lowered, but it continued spreading all across Sumeru due to her taint in [[Irminsul]] to the point that they were appearing faster than the [[Forest Rangers]] could deal with them. After [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]] removed Rukkhadevata from [[Irminsul]], the Withering was stopped for good, although the areas that it had affected prior to her removal still remains and poses a threat.

==Decay==
In Withering Zones, the player will accumulate the '''Decay''' gauge. The Decay gauge is shared between characters for each player. The Decay gauge has a maximum of 10 units. A visual effect will occur on the Decay gauge when Decay reaches 8 units, warning players of its accumulation.

The Decay gauge has a minimum of 2 units in most Withering Zones. When hit by an attack from an enemy affected by The Withering or Fetid Boughs within the Withering Zone, the player will accumulate 1 unit of Decay. There is no other way for Decay to accumulate in most Withering Zones.

In two special Withering Zones, [[Old Vanarana]] and the cave in [[Mawtiyima Forest]], Decay has a minimum of 4 units instead of 2. Additionally, Decay will naturally accumulate at a rate of around 1 unit per 10 seconds. There is also a special Withering Zone east of [[Devantaka Mountain]] with a minimum of 4 units of Decay but no natural accumulation.

All characters in the party have their [[Resistance]]s reduced by '''4%''' and [[Max HP]] reduced by '''9.5%''' for each unit of Decay accumulated.

If the player maintains a maxed Decay gauge of 10 units for 10 seconds, then all characters will be [[Fallen Characters|killed]]. If the active character's HP is not drained because of damage-nullifying [[Invincibility Frames|i-frames]], or [[Constellation]]s that allow characters to resist lethal DMG, it will be drained in the following seconds. During these ten seconds, the screen borders will have a visual effect that continuously closes in, reducing the player's peripheral vision.

===Reducing Decay===
[[Candles of Life]], and [[Seelie#Seelies of Life|Seelies of Life]] may appear within Withering Zones which will continuously decrease accumulated Decay for nearby players. [[Flames of Life]] will only reduce Decay by 1 unit when approached and can only be used once. Players may also leave the Withering Zone to reset Decay. However, Decay cannot be reduced past the minimum of 2 or 4 units.

Although it is rare for a [[Teleport Waypoint]] to be located within a Withering Zone, these Teleport Waypoints can also continuously decrease accumulated Decay for nearby players.

==Elimination==
To clear a Withering Zone, players must use [[Dendrograna]] to destroy the Withering Branches with [[Charged Attacks]] or Aimed Shots.

Once all branches have been destroyed, the Tumor of the Withering at the center of the area will summon stronger [[enemies]], alternatively known as a Disciple of Decay. These enemies gain '''15%''' increased [[Resistances]] and '''10%''' increased [[ATK]]. Hitting Disciples of Decay with {{Dendro}} attacks or a Dendrogranum's coordinated attack will remove the buff for 13 seconds. The enemies that appear are usually related to the monsters already present; e.g a zone with [[Ruin Machine]]s will spawn them as disciples. In the rare case that the zone is occupied by weaker monsters, a different enemy will appear, such as a [[rifthound]].

Once the enemies have been defeated, the Tumor of the Withering can be interacted with to be destroyed, which will permanently eliminate The Withering from the area and a [[Chest]] will show up as a reward corresponding to the difficulty of the zone.

===Withering Branches===
When a Withering Branch is destroyed by a Dendrogranum coordinated attack, it will either explode, fire three shots at an angle, or fire three shots into the sky, dealing {{Color|True Physical DMG}} and increasing the player's Decay by 1 unit if the player is hit.

===Fetid Boughs===
Fetid Boughs are environmental hazards in Withering Zones. They appear similar to Withering Branches but take the form of other plants instead. Unlike Withering Branches, Fetid Boughs periodically shoot projectiles at nearby players, who gain 1 unit of Decay on hit.

Fetid Boughs can be destroyed with Dendrograna, but it is not required to destroy them to clear their Withering Zone.

Fetid Boughs disappear when the Withering Zone is cleared.

==Trivia==
* All [[Tri-Lakshana Creature]]s found in a Withering Zone are in their scorched state, and will not react to Dendro applications until the Withering Zone is cleared.
** Destroying the Tumor of the Withering will return all the affected Tri-Lakshana Creatures to their normal state.
** [[Rocklifting Branch]]es present in Withering Zones often contains more rewards in addition to the chest awarded from destroying the Tumor, such as a [[Dendroculus]] or a [[Rock Pile]] containing Mora. [[Bouncy Mushroom]]s initially scorched may also then allow players to collect Dencroculus floating high above them.
** Tri-Lakshana Creatures who spawn outside of a Withering Zone and move inside one will not become scorched unless they come into contact with {{Pyro}} as usual.
* [[Wildlife]] is rarely found within Withering Zones. After clearing a Withering Zone and reloading the area, wildlife may appear.
* The three-pronged spiraling symbol in Withering Branches, Fetid Boughs, and the projectiles shot by Fetid Boughs is also found in [[Valaya]] and [[Dendrogranum-Locked Rock]]s, but colored green instead of black and red.
* While facing enemies in the Withering, a unique battle music plays in place of the default Sumeru battle music.
