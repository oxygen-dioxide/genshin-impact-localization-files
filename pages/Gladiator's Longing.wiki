{{Description|A timepiece that recorded the gladiator's days in the bloodstained Colosseum. To him, it counted down the days on his long road to freedom.}}
'''Gladiator's Longing''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Gladiator's Finale]].

==Description==
The gladiator crafted this hourglass himself. He would flip the hourglass before each battle.<br />When the hourglass stopped flipping, the gladiator had long since died in a pool of his own blood.

The gladiator would put this hourglass aside before entering the arena.<br />When the fight has ended and the crowd started to cheer for him, the sand in the hourglass was still flowing.

In the gladiator's final fight, he faced a young girl.<br />In her eyes, he saw both the timidity of a young girl and the ferocity of a young lioness.<br />From his steps, the girl saw the unbreakable shackles of age that the gladiator wore.<br />It was a fight like the old gladiator has not had in years. Fierce, yet satisfying.<br />But the fight ended in a flash. The sword plunged into the gladiator's heart and the sand in his hourglass crawled to a stop.
