:;(Crucabena closes the book and scene changes to a shot of the children of the House of the Hearth listening to the story)

:'''Clervie:''' I heard that in Snezhnaya, colored light dances in the sky at night...
:'''Clervie:''' When we're grown up...
:'''Clervie:''' Shall we go see it together?

:'''Crucabena:''' I should have pruned this flower long ago, not waited till it wilts... How grotesque
:'''Crucabena:''' Wouldn't you agree?
:;(Peruere charges at Crucabena, causing an explosion. Crucabena blocks her sword attack.)
:'''Crucabena:''' Hmph
:;(Peruere continues to attack Crucabena.)
:'''Crucabena:''' Innocence and kindness are such beautiful qualities...
:'''Crucabena:''' Sadly... they're also useless
:;(Crucabena charges at Peruere, which she avoided and throws Crucabena into the air. Peruere chases Crucabena through the halls as the battle continues.)
:'''Crucabena:''' A bird tied down will never fly the nest. You are no exception
:;(Peruere charges her fist with a red-colored aura and Crucabena summoned a sword using her Hydro power. Their powers clash and Peruere is thrown into a pillar, destroying it. Injured Peruere looks at the wilted blue flower and visibly saddened.)
:'''Crucabena:''' Surrender
:'''Crucabena:''' Let your "Mother" guide you, and you shall become the one true "King"!
:;(Peruere raises from the rubble)
:'''Crucabena:''' Hmph!
:;(Crucabena attacks Peruere. Peruere dodges all of the attacks with ease and blocked Crucabena's last attack.)
:'''Peruere:''' "Mother"
:;(Peruere kicks Crucabena into the ceiling, shattering all of the ceiling's glass.)
:'''Peruere:''' My answer...

:;(Scene cuts to the inside of the mausoleum. [[Pierro]], [[The Balladeer]], [[Signora]], and [[The Captain]] are standing in front of Peruere.)
