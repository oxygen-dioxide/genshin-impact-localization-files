|description    = A lush and beautiful sakura tree that shows off a clear reddish coloration.<br />The people of [[Inazuma]] once had an elegant tradition of granting poetic names upon flora. Of course, such name did not have to follow any fixed format, just a rhythm that people could follow. It is said that many poetic nicknames that are popular today were granted at the whims of [[Kaedehara Kazuha|a certain young wanderer]].
