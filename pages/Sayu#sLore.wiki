{{Quote|Sayu, Shuumatsuban's resident ninja, is obsessed with sleeping and growing taller.<br />She has mastered all kinds of ninjutsu to run away and hide in pursuit of opportunities to laze around and sleep.<br />Such an extraordinary skillset may have very unexpected uses.|Description from the Official Website<ref name="OGIW">Official ''Genshin Impact'' Website: [https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/character/inazuma?char=3 Sayu]</ref>}}

==Personality==
{{Quote|A pint-sized ninja attached to the Shuumatsuban, who always seems sleep-deprived.|In-game character attributes page text
}}

Sayu is a seemingly eternally sleep-deprived ninja who uses her skills to hide from work and responsibilities. Her height is something she's deeply unsatisfied with, believing that sleep can replenish all her energy and help her grow taller.<ref name="2.0SP">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/l8YXe7EkmoU&t=2401s Version 2.0 Special Program]</ref> In order to live by this principle and have as much time to nap as possible, she honed her ninjutsu to perfection.

While she is particularly renowned for her apparent laziness, the members of the Shuumatsuban know that she is loyal to their cause as she would never go against their principles<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Mysterious Order}}</ref> and wouldn't slack off on extremely important matters. Ayaka believes that Sayu's laziness came from her sensei's abrupt departure, as she looked up to them and when they left, became lost and confused.

Of course, from Sayu's point of view, this so-called "laziness" is just better time allocation which allows her to focus on things... like sleeping and growing taller.<ref name="OGIW" /> She does not like it when people pat her head, believing that doing so impedes her growth. She tolerates headpats from both the [[Traveler]] and [[Yae Miko]], although the latter is out of fear of retaliation by the Guuji.

While a particularly skilled ninja, Sayu usually handles reconnaissance and other miscellaneous tasks. While she is trained in combat, the arts she learned were mostly intended for stealth and evasion. She appreciates the Traveler's company, willing to work harder for their sake.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Where the Dandelions Find Rest}}</ref> While dressed as a mujina, who she finds extremely adorable, Sayu becomes angered whenever people call her a tanuki, even going as far as to attack them.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Arataki Itto|About Sayu}}</ref>

Sayu uses the [[:Category:Short Female Characters|short female]] model and is said to be pint-sized.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Kano Nana}}</ref> She has short beige hair and reddish eyes.

==Official Introduction==
<h3>[https://www.hoyolab.com/article/416410 A dreaming companion that leaves no traces behind]</h3>

{{Quote|Are you in a hurry to find Sayu? Oh, I see, she is usually hiding in the trees in the afternoons. I have my own ways of finding her, so please let me know if you need help... Oh, but if I interfere, then I will deny you the pleasure of finishing this task on your own, won't I?|[[Kamisato Ayato]]}}

A pint-sized, agile ninja associated with the [[Shuumatsuban|Shiyuumatsu-Ban]].<br />
Height has never been one of Sayu's strengths... She stopped growing a long time ago, long enough that she feels like she is trapped in a dream where time has stopped.<br />
Why aren't I growing taller? Am I not getting enough sleep?<br />
And just like that, the pint-sized ninja who awoke to this thought drifted off to sleep again.

Sayu firmly believes that sleep can replenish all her energy and help her grow taller. In order to live by this principle and have as much time to nap as possible, she honed her ninjutsu to perfection.<br />
Fleeing, hiding, transforming... Sayu is the master of all ninjutsu techniques. An unsuspecting leaf or a bucket? It might be just one of Sayu's many disguises!

As a result, if the Shiyuumatsu-Ban needs Sayu's help, they need to commit all efforts to finding her first.<br />
Of course, from Sayu's point of view, this so-called "laziness" is just better time allocation which allows her to focus on things... like sleeping and growing taller.

==Trivia==
* Sayu can wield a weapon that's double her size, thanks to the power of her Vision.
* In her official [https://www.hoyolab.com/article/416410 character profile page] and when talking about her height problem in the [https://youtu.be/l8YXe7EkmoU&t=2401s Version 2.0 Special Program], HoYoverse keeps her age ambiguous by saying ''"all her peers of the same age have grown taller, but only she remains as tiny as before"'' or that she was raised in the Shuumatsuban ''"since she was a child."''<ref>Twitter: [https://twitter.com/GenshinImpact/status/1423950796715139076 Sayu's Character Announcement]</ref> However, she is still referred to as a ''"girl"'' and ''"child"'' in [[Kano Nana]]'s dialogue and idle quotes, and a ''"kid"'' in [[Kano Nana's Healthy Diet]] Reputation Request.

===Etymology===
* Sayu's name uses the kanji for "early/fast" ({{ja|早}}) and "citron" ({{ja|柚}}).
* Sayu's constellation, Nyctereutes Minor, is the New Latin for "The Lesser {{w|Raccoon dog|Tanuki}}."
** ''{{w|Nyctereutes}}'' is the genus of ferret-like canines which only includes the raccoon dog, also known as the ''tanuki''.
** ''Nyctereutes'' derives from the Ancient Greek {{Lang|mini=1|grc=νυκτερευτής|grc_rm=nuktereutḗs}}, meaning "one who hunts by night."
** Sayu's outfit also has the notable features of a tanuki, such as the ears, tail, and the leaf that sits atop her head.
* Despite Sayu's resemblance to a tanuki, her motif is supposedly based on the {{w|mujina}}, as indicated by her title "Mujina Ninja" and the name of her ''Muji-Muji'' Daruma.
** ''Mujina'' ({{ja|狢}}) is an archaic term that mainly refers to the {{w|Japanese badger}}, though it is sometimes confused with the Japanese raccoon dog.
** In Japanese folklore, mujina are badger-like youkai similar to {{w|bake-danuki}} that are capable of shapeshifting into multiple forms, including humans. They are commonly depicted as mischievous or cunning, where they will shapeshift to trick humans in a non-malicious manner.
* In Sayu's "Yoohoo Arts", Yoohoo is from a word {{Lang|zh=呜呼|zh_rm=wūhū|ja=嗚呼|ja_rm=aa/oko|sort=zh,ja}} that is an interjection to express sorrow, regret, compassion or grief, similar to "alas" or "alack"
