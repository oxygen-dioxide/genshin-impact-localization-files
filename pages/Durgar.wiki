{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Durgar:''' Thanks to the blessings of [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]], the newly arrived wood is very sturdy and barely has any quality issues.
:{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Durgar:''' Good day. I am the carpenter here. If you need any woodwork done, I'm your guy.
::'''Durgar:''' I handle everyone's carpentry needs around here. Fair prices and reliable quality guaranteed.
::'''Durgar:''' The newly arrived wood is really something &mdash; firm, durable, and has a beautiful texture. If you'd like to let me build you something with this lumber, you'd better make up your mind quick.
::'''Durgar:''' This is a blessing from Lesser Lord Kusanali. I must make sure every piece of it is made into quality products.
::{{DIcon}} About Lesser Lord Kusanali...
:;(Before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
:::'''Durgar:''' The fact that Sumeru people are living in a place where trees and flowers flourish instead of struggling amidst barren deserts is all thanks to the kindness of the Lord Kusanali.
:::'''Durgar:''' Greater Lord Rukkhadevata left roots and nutrients to Sumeru, which have now been inherited and protected by Lesser Lord Kusanali.
:::'''Durgar:''' So now, all our harvests are born from her mercy.
:::'''Durgar:''' And since I live by carpentry, which is closely related to trees, I am even more grateful to the Dendro Archon!
:;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
:::'''Durgar:''' The fact that Sumeru people are living in a place where trees and flowers flourish instead of struggling amidst barren deserts is all thanks to the kindness of Lord Kusanali.
:::'''Durgar:''' She lay down the roots and fertilized the land &mdash; all our harvests, whether in the field or in life, stem from her.
:::'''Durgar:''' And since carpentry's how I make my living, a trade that's plenty close to the trees, I'm all the more grateful to the Dendro Archon!
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Durgar:''' Goodbye! Come to me if you need any woodworking done!
