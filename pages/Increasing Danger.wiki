'''''Increasing Danger''''' is a [[Daily Commission]] that can occur in various locations in [[Teyvat]].

==Steps==
{{Quest Description|[[Hilichurls]] are building towers in the wilderness. Destroy them quickly.}}
# Destroy the Hilichurl tower (0/2)

==Gameplay Notes==
* There will be hilichurls in the quest area, but it is possible to complete the commission without defeating them.
* When 2 waves are killed and after destroying 1 tower, damaging the other tower to half its health will spawn a second wave of enemies.
* It is possible to destroy the towers from afar with fully charged [[Aimed Shot]]s from certain characters and complete the commission without [[Aggro|alerting]] any hilichurls.
** Some characters' fully charged Aimed Shots will alert the hilichurls. See {{S|Aggravation#Sounds}} for more information.
** Hitting the towers with more than 2 Aimed Shots that are not fully charged in a short period of time from any character will alert the hilichurls.
* The [[Narukami Island]] commission in particular does not spawn extra waves.
* When there are 2 or fewer enemies left, bringing a tower under half health will spawn a wave of reinforcements.
** This means that reinforcements will not spawn if the player shoot down the towers from a distance without fighting the enemies.
** The order of the reinforcement waves is not fixed and is instead based on the order of towers being brought under half health.
** Some locations only spawn one wave of reinforcements; bringing the second tower to under half health does not spawn another wave.
** When the player defeat the required number of enemies after bringing a tower under half health, they will need to damage the tower below another health checkpoint in order for reinforcements to spawn. The exact health checkpoints are not known, but there seem to be checkpoints every ~10% health under 50%. Damaging a tower without causing its health to drop under one of these checkpoints does not seem to cause reinforcements to spawn.
** Destroying a tower from over half health in a single hit can spawn reinforcements.
* Waiting too long can cause reinforcements to arrive, regardless of whether the player have damaged the towers.
* It is possible to receive two Increasing Danger commissions on the same day at different locations in the region the player set their commissions to.
