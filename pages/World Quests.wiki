{{Description|The best way to understand this world is to explore all that is around you, leaving no stone unturned.<br />Solving the enigmas of old, helping hapless travelers, and following the trails of long-lost treasure will all become invaluable knowledge and experience...<br />Even if you are not the least bit interested in ancient riddles or the plights of others, there is always treasure to be found at the end of the road.}}
'''World Quests''' give insight into the various locations and stories of the world. Some World Quests require Players to find the starting [[NPC]]. Others have [[Adventure Rank]] requirements or are only available after a certain [[Archon Quest]] has been completed. Some World Quests are part of a series and require the previous in the series to unlock.
