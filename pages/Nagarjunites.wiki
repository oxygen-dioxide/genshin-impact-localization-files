The '''Nagarjunites''' were once a branch of [[Sumeru Akademiya]] which believed in "the transmission of knowledge at all costs" and that "conflict is the natural order of Teyvat."<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Darya}}</ref> They have long since split from the Akademiya and are rarely acknowledged, but some followers can still be found in the desert region.

The Nagarjunites are presumably followers of Nagarjuna, who is mentioned in [[An Ode to Soul-Light]].
