'''Electro''' is one of the seven [[Elements]] and the third element that the [[Traveler]] acquires.

Its associated [[Archon]] is [[Ei]], whose domain is [[Inazuma]].

==Elemental Resonance==
Having two Electro characters in the group results in the [[Elemental Resonance]]:
* '''High Voltage:''' Affected by [[Hydro]] for 40% less time. [[Superconduct]], [[Overloaded]], and [[Electro-Charged]] have a 100% chance to generate an Electro Elemental Particle (CD: 5s).

==Elemental Reactions==
{{Electro}} has the following [[Elemental Reactions]]:

* {{Icon/Element|Pyro}} '''[[Overloaded]]:''' Causes an explosion that deals {{Color|AoE Pyro DMG}}
* {{Icon/Element|Hydro}} '''[[Electro-Charged]]:''' Deals {{Color|Electro DMG}} and high [[Poise Damage]] over time to all nearby targets with the Wet status.
* {{Icon/Element|Cryo}} '''[[Superconduct]]:''' Deals {{Color|AoE Cryo DMG}} and reduces the {{Color|Physical RES}} of enemies caught in the AoE by 40%.
* {{Icon/Element|Anemo}} '''[[Swirl]]:''' Deals {{Color|AoE Electro DMG}} while spreading the Electro status to nearby enemies.
* {{Icon/Element|Geo}} '''[[Crystallize]]:''' Creates an Electro shard. Picking it up creates an Electro shield around the character.

The elemental reaction [[Catalyze]] is expected to come with the [[Version 3.0]] update, after the release of Sumeru.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/6DjVUfy_Lng Sumeru Preview Teaser 01: The Fascinating Dendro Element | Genshin Impact]</ref>

==Electro Status==
{{Electro}} on its own does not have any special effect, but it will allow Electro Elemental Reactions to occur. Certain mechanics in Inazuma, such as the [[Lightning Strike Probe]], will respond to characters or monsters affected by Electro.

Any source of {{Color|Electro DMG}}, including [[Electro Crystal]]s, will apply the {{Electro}} status. Getting struck by lightning or entering a body of water struck by lightning during a [[thunderstorm]] will also apply {{Electro}}.

===Electro Status to Self===
The following [[Talents]] apply the {{Electro}} status to its user and/or the active character.
