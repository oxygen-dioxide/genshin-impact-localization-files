{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Interact with Message Board between [[Aunt Qiao]] and [[Pops Zhou]] after Part I)
:'''Message:''' If I remember correctly, Liyue's couplets can be quite difficult to write...
:'''Reply:''' Yeah, it's harder if you follow the rules and try to match every word.
:'''Reply:''' Apart from having exactly the same number of syllables, you have to take note of certain tonal patterns and make the words rhyme...
:'''Reply:''' Anyway, it's a rare opportunity to have guests visiting from Mondstadt, so let's all just enjoy ourselves.

;(Interact with Message Board between Aunt Qiao and Pops Zhou after Part II)
:'''Someone's Poem:''' "I want to be a mushroom. Not blue like a lake, nor reflecting the moon."
:'''Someone's Poem:''' "I just want to be an ordinary mushroom, a mushroom no one bothers to pick."
:'''Someone's Poem:''' "I want to hide within the foot of the tree, unless a forest boar happens to discover me. Then it'll put me atop its head, as if I'm a crown of flowers made."
:'''Someone's Poem:''' "You see, I didn't want this fungal metamorphosis, because it's just an excuse for loneliness."

;(Interact with Message Board between Aunt Qiao and Pops Zhou after Part II)
:'''Someone's Poem:''' "Color the lyre-strings like a rainbow. Pitter-patter, pitter-patter."
:'''Someone's Poem:''' "Even the leaves taste sweet whenever rain falls."

:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 jifang 02.ogg}} '''Jifang:''' ...So where's the book?
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 hutao 02.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' It's in the works! Just waiting on the poems!
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 jifang 03.ogg}} '''Jifang:''' ...And where are the poems?
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 hutao 03.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' They're on the way.
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 jifang 04.ogg}} '''Jifang:''' ...Look, I'm sorry Director Hu, but how do you expect me to talk business with you when you don't even have the poems yet?
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 hutao 04.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' I just figured while we're waiting, we could discuss terms in advance.
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 jifang 05.ogg}} '''Jifang:''' Well, I need to see the content to decide if I even want to sell it, let alone how much to sell it for.
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 hutao 05.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Oh, come on, I showed you a sample already, and it was some of my finest work! Besides, you only need a few highlights to sell an anthology!
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 jifang 06.ogg}} '''Jifang:''' ...You think your poem, "Fifteen Tenderloin Steaks" will carry the whole book, do you?
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 hutao 06.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' That and "Square Meals In the Basement"! My consultant, the erudite Mr. Zhongli, described it as a meticulous masterpiece! Ooh &mdash; quote that on the cover! It'll practically sell itself!
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 jifang 07.ogg}} '''Jifang:''' ...Director, we're a small business. If we invest money in printing and nobody buys it, it's my bottom line that's affected.
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 hutao 07.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' Don't you worry! I guarantee you, when this anthology comes out, it will take the world by storm! Gods and ghosts alike will weep!
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 hutao 08.ogg}} '''Hu Tao:''' As a matter of fact, I heard a ghost crying on the way here. If you don't believe me, I can bring it over?
:{{A|vo dialog sgeq003 jifang 08.ogg}} '''Jifang:''' ...There'll be no need for that.
