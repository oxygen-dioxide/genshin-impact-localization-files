'''Vasoma Fruit''' is a [[Quest Item]] obtained during the quests ''[[The Rhythm that Leads to the Gloomy Path]]'', ''[[The Rhythm that Nurtures the Sprout]]'', and ''[[The Rhythm that Reveals the Beastly Trail]]''.

A Vasoma Fruit is the accumulation of the dreams and memories of a [[Vasara Tree]]. It is a potent source of energy for [[Aranara]], and can be fed to the [[Fane of Ashvattha|Ashvattha Tree]] to form a [[Bija]].

In ''[[Aranyaka]]'', [[Traveler]] and [[Arama]] obtain three Vasoma Fruits as thanks for clearing the [[The Withering|Marana]] out of the Vasara Trees in [[Ashvattha's Concourse]]s ([[Aramaha]], [[Arayama]], and [[Araji]]).
