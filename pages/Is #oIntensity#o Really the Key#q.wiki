==Steps==
# Seal the [[geothermal vent]]
# Talk to [[Linaha]]

==Gameplay Notes==
* After completing this quest, Ma'chah returns to the site where [[Loshts]] and the others have been waiting for him. The player can then challenge him as a [[Master Trainer]].
* Sealing all the five geothermal vents around the hot spring and thus returning the hot spring's temperature to normal grants the {{Achievement|The Purest Heat}}.
** The quest can be completed without sealing all the five geothermal vents if all three little [[Koholasaur]]s are found. 

==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Shall "intensity" vanquish the cold, or must some other step up to the plate?}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the hot spring, if the player talked to [[Loshts]] beforehand)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa! Such a huge hot spring! Wait a minute... Hot springs... "intense water"...
:'''Paimon:''' C&mdash;Could this be where the "strongest" resides?

;(Talk to [[Yoleehe]], optional)
:'''Yoleehe:''' Could it be... that everything written in "The Book of Five Springs" is true...?

;(Talk to [[???|Linaha]], optional)
:'''???:''' Ki'o-ki'o, where are you...

;(Interact with "The Book of Five Springs", optional)
::'''The Book of Five Springs'''
::"What is defeat, really? Thus the man pondered ceaselessly... until a challenger approached, surging on the path of five searing springs!"
::"A showdown to decide who the 'strongest' is, a battle to 'sear' the 'sheer cold'! His surging, searing path shall cause even a mighty mountain to melt and boil!"
::"[[Yae Publishing House]]'s latest flagship work, 'The Book of Five Springs' &mdash; now serialized in a store near you!"
----
;(Talk to Ma'chah)
:'''Ma'chah:''' So "cold"! This is so "cold"!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Cold? What are you talking about... You're sitting in a hot spring, aren't you?
:'''Ma'chah:''' No, no... This still isn't enough! If I'm to become the "strongest" &mdash; the "strongest" in the [[Collective of Plenty]], no, in all Natlan &mdash; I can't settle for just this level of cold! The "intensity"... it's nowhere near enough!
:'''Paimon:''' Eh...? Why are you sitting back down again?
:{{DIcon}} It seems the "intensity" still isn't enough!
::'''Paimon:''' What even is this "intensity" you're talking about? Paimon doesn't understand a word you're saying!
:{{DIcon}} It's probably because standing up makes him feel even colder...
::'''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks so too. No wonder he's shaking like a leaf!
:'''Yoleehe:''' Oh, you must be the famous adventurers {{Traveler}} and Paimon! Wonderful! Now we're saved!
:'''Paimon:''' Wh&mdash;What? Saved? What's going on...?
:'''Yoleehe:''' Alright, I'll spill the beans. According to the master himself, he's on a journey to become the "strongest." To that end, he's fully immersed himself in some sort of hot spring training!
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, training? In a hot spring?
:'''Yoleehe:''' Yeah... I know it sounds crazy, but he got this idea from some martial arts book titled "The Book of Five Springs."
:'''Yoleehe:''' The book says that if you follow its teachings, you can eventually {{Color|buzzword|make cold water boil}} just by using your own "intensity."
:'''Yoleehe:''' And that's not even the wildest part! The book's full of insane stories about martial arts legends &mdash; like one guy who punched straight through a mountain in one night, and another who could crush rocks into gemstones with his bare hands!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon never imagined there could be such incredible martial arts in the world! If you could learn them too, {{Traveler}}...
:{{DIcon}} Whoa, that's like something straight out of a novel.
:{{DIcon}} You don't actually believe that, do you?
:'''Yoleehe:''' Look, I get it &mdash; it sounds ridiculous. But this isn't just any random book. Our master found it in the collections owned by the [[Masters of the Night-Wind]], so it's gotta be legit, right? And more importantly, he believes in it completely!
:'''Yoleehe:''' That's why he picked this specific hot spring &mdash; or rather, this "cold spring." His goal is to transform the freezing cold water into a true hot spring using nothing but sheer "intensity"!
:'''Paimon:''' Wait... it's true! This water's ice-cold! But won't he get sick from staying in water like this for so long, no matter how strong he is?
:'''Yoleehe:''' Yeah, exactly! And even if he doesn't get sick, this can't go on forever. Our "[[Warrior's Challenge]]" has been put on hold for days, and everyone's waiting for him to come back!
:'''Yoleehe:''' But the master keeps saying that giving up halfway would mean he doesn't have enough "intensity." He's sworn that he won't leave until the water starts boiling.
:'''Yoleehe:''' The spring's manager has no idea why the water's gone cold in the first place. Honestly, if only we had some skilled adventurers around to help out... Look, I've even prepared a reward! All this, for anyone who can solve the problem.
:{{DIcon}} Maybe you should call someone from the [[People of the Springs]] to help out...
:{{DIcon}} Are you seriously trying to bribe me with that reward right now?
:'''Paimon:''' (Hey, let's not be so quick to turn him down. Let's check out how much he's offering first, at least!)
:'''Paimon:''' Ahem, don't worry &mdash; we'll get this spring heated up again. Besides, we can't just let the master sit in freezing water until he gets sick. Helping people is what good adventurers do, right?
:'''Yoleehe:''' Oh, thank you! I'll be counting on you, then!
:'''Paimon:''' You just stay here. We'll have this sorted out in no time!
:;(They step aside)<!-- screen transition -->
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... Well, we already agreed to help out, but where should we even start?
:;(Linaha watches them from behind a rock)
:{{DIcon}} How about giving our magical mystical [[phlogiston]] a try?
::'''Paimon:''' That's never going to work! The area's way too big!
:{{DIcon}} There's probably a lot of magma in the [[Great Volcano of Tollan|volcano]] nearby...
::'''Paimon:''' Oh, Paimon gets it! We could have our little guy dig a tunnel, then use the volcanic magma to heat the hot spring, right? Not a bad idea...
::'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Rawr! Rawr!
::'''Paimon:''' ...Yeah, right! Get serious, would you? We could get people killed doing that! Worse, {{Little One}} believed you for a second back there!
:'''Paimon:''' *sigh* Isn't there a more realistic solution we can try?
:;(Little One goes underground)
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr?
:'''Paimon:''' Wait, {{Little One}}, don't go wandering off like that!

;(Talk to Ma'chah again, optional)
:'''Ma'chah:''' Haha! So "cold"! This is so "cold"! But just watch &mdash; I'm about to crank the "intensity" right up! You'll boil alright, mark my words!
----
;(Approach the geothermal vent near the Little One)
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Rawr! Rawr!
:'''Paimon:''' A Phlogiston spout? Oh, Paimon gets it! We use this spout to heat the hot spring!

;(Seal the first geothermal vent)
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? A little Koholasaurus? Why is it here?
:'''???:''' Ki'o-ki'o...! So you were here after all... If you guys hadn't come out when you did, I-I'd have...
:'''???:''' What if you'd gotten hurt? Don't just run off like that again, okay? *sniff*...
:'''Paimon:''' H&mdash;Hey, cheer up! Look, your little [[saurian]]'s fine, see? Super full of energy, too!
:'''{{Little One}}:''' Rawr! Rawr!
:'''Linaha:''' Ah, um... I'm okay now. Oh! I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Linaha, from the People of the Springs. I'm usually assigned to take care of the little Koholasaurs...
:'''Paimon:''' Alone? That's pretty impressive!
:'''Linaha:''' N&mdash;Not really... If I were more like you, Ms. Paimon, they probably wouldn't have run off like that.
:'''Linaha:''' I was thinking that they might've all gone to play near the vents, and it turns out I was right...
:'''Paimon:''' So the hot spring got cold because the little Koholasaurs had the phlogiston vents all blocked up, huh? No wonder the spring caretaker didn't notice anything!
:'''Linaha:''' Actually... there are still two more Koholasaurs I haven't found yet. I think they're probably hiding in the phlogiston vents too...
:'''Paimon:''' Leave this to us! We'll find the other little Koholasaurs while we adjust the water temperature, don't you worry!
:'''Linaha:''' Really? Thank you! It's great to have Ms. Paimon around.
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, of course! You can always count on a legendary adventurer like the Great Paimon &mdash; this is a piece of cake!
:'''Linaha:''' Wow! Ms. Paimon, you're amazing! I want to be just like you someday!
:{{DIcon}} I agree. The Great Ms. Paimon is indeed amazing.
:{{DIcon}} Alright then, I'll leave the next fight to you, oh Great Ms. Paimon...
::'''Paimon:''' (Hey, can you not put Paimon on the spot like that in front of everyone? How about this &mdash; Paimon'll let you have the best dish tonight, okay?)
:'''Paimon:''' Ahem! Anyway, let's get going!

;(Seal the second geothermal vent)
:'''Paimon:''' Okay, we're just missing the last one!

;(Seal the third geothermal vent)
:'''Paimon:''' Phew... That should be everything... Let's go find Linaha!
----
;(Talk to Linaha or Ma'chah)
:'''Linaha:''' Great! You're all back! I was starting to think I might've really messed things up today!
:'''Ma'chah:''' Huh? This is... so hot! The "intensity" is building up! Ahh! I did it! I really did it!
:'''Ma'chah:''' Haha! What incredible "intensity"! Such unbelievable "intensity"!
:'''Ma'chah:''' ...Aghhh!
:'''Yoleehe:''' Can someone lend a hand!? Someone just fainted!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh no, looks like the master's passed out! Let's go help too, {{Traveler}}!
:{{Black Screen|It seems like the master only fainted from the heat and isn't seriously injured. With your help, Yoleehe carries the unconscious master away...<br>Looks like the master's own ability to handle "intensity" still has some room for improvement..}}
