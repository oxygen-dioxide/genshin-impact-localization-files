===Theater Mechanicus: Stage of Wonders===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Komakata:''' Come, try your hand at Theater Mechanicus!
:{{DIcon}} Try Theater Mechanicus.
::'''Komakata:''' Sure thing! Enjoy the brand-new version of Theater Mechanicus! You won't be disappointed!
:;(Opens Theater Mechanicus menu)
:{{DIcon}} What is it?
::'''Komakata:''' In short, it is a game that can be played on a board. It was first invented by [[Ruijin|Ms. Ruijin]] from Liyue.
::'''Komakata:''' Well, according to Ms. Ruijin, I'm a local representative of Theater Mechanicus in Inazuma.
::'''Komakata:''' After I obtained... umm... the distribution rights, Ms. Ruijin sent me a complete set of Theater Mechanicus and the business model that goes with it.
::'''Komakata:''' According to Ms. Ruijin, I am not her only overseas distributor. She must've made a lot of money from the distribution fees...
::'''Komakata:''' However. I've prepared brand-new gameplay. Maybe it'll be even better than Ms. Ruijin's original version of Theater Mechanicus... Ahem...
::'''Komakata:''' *sigh* Ms. Ruijin really does have a good business sense. If only I could be like her...
::{{DIcon}} Try Theater Mechanicus.
:::'''Komakata:''' Sure thing! Enjoy the brand-new version of Theater Mechanicus! You won't be disappointed!
::;(Opens Theater Mechanicus gameplay menu)
::{{DIcon}} I don't have time...
:::'''Komakata:''' Well, come back later when you have time.
:{{DIcon}} I don't have time...
::'''Komakata:''' Well, come back later when you have time.

===Hues of the Violet Garden===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Komakata:''' Come, try your hand at the all-new version of Theater Mechanicus!
:{{DIcon}} Try Theater Mechanicus.
::'''Komakata:''' The "Theater Mechanicus: Stage of Brilliance" won't let you down!
:;(Opens Theater Mechanicus menu)
:{{DIcon}} What's Theater Mechanicus?
::'''Komakata:''' It's a tabletop game from Liyue, and a very interesting one, too!
::'''Komakata:''' The original inventor of the game is Ms. Ruijin from Liyue, and she gave me the overseas franchising rights to the game, such that I'd be able to distribute it in Inazuma.
::'''Komakata:''' Ms. Ruijin originally had quite a few overseas franchise owners, but I seem to be the most stable of the lot.
::'''Komakata:''' I actually haven't heard from the others in a long time. Perhaps they've all given up due to a lack of profits.
::'''Komakata:''' As for me, I'm just more focused on how Theater Mechanicus plays. I even tried to come up with a totally new game mode a while back.
::'''Komakata:''' I later discovered that my designs coincidentally lined up with the new ideas that Ms. Ruijin was implementing. But as it turns out, that just helped us hit it off all the more!
::'''Komakata:''' In any case, the two of us will stay in touch and improve Theater Mechanicus, releasing regular updates for our customers!
::{{DIcon}} A well-qualified franchise owner indeed.
::'''Komakata:''' Thanks!
::'''Komakata:''' Well, come back and play often, alright?
:{{DIcon}} So, there's this "big shot" here at the Irodori Festival...
::'''Komakata:''' Well, aren't you well-informed? Actually, you've probably met that big shot too, I'll bet!
::'''Komakata:''' So what happened is that Ms. Ruijin did try to get a buy-in from the Feiyun Commerce Guild in the beginning, but they didn't seem all that interested.
::'''Komakata:''' But the guild's [[Xingqiu|second young master]] had quite the unique perspective and a real hand for business, and so he wanted to see if Theater Mechanicus was a worthwhile investment.
::'''Komakata:''' Of course, Ms. Ruijin wasn't actually done preparing a new event yet, and there was no way we could start another round of Theater Mechanicus in Liyue on short notice.
::'''Komakata:''' But when the young master heard from Ms. Ruijin that I would be promoting Theater Mechanicus at the Irodori Festival, he suddenly made arrangements to travel here and see it for himself.
::'''Komakata:''' Just imagine, if that young master finds Theater Mechanicus intriguing, I might even get a large sum of Mora for further development...
::{{DIcon}} He's actually got other reasons for being here...
::'''Komakata:''' You know what? I've decided! I'm going to do my best out there this time and win glory for Theater Mechanicus!
::'''Komakata:''' I mean, we've got a sterling player like you on side. We'll definitely succeed, right?
::{{DIcon}} Yeah... Hooray... Good luck...
