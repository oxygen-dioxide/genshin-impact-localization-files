Its drooping flowers seem to mourn for heroes long past.<br>Once, [[Cataclysm|when beings dark and demonic invaded the lands]], countless heroes sacrificed themselves in a battle against them. Legend has it that these flowers are watered by the blood of those martyrs. The tribes of these plains speak additionally of the countless innocents who suffered from that calamity, of how due to being stained by the filth from the war, they are barred from eternal samsara, and can only languish amidst these flowers, lamenting the injustice of fate by weeping.|[[Archive]]}}
