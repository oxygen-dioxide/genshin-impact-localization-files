:{{A|vo cyaq005 1 yelan 01.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Well, well... This is not what I was expecting...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, seems like you've made a new discovery?

;(Yelan shares the content of [[Note of Unknown Origin]] with everyone.)
:{{A|vo cyaq005 1 yelan 02.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' This information was left by a {{w|Thaumaturgy|thaumaturge}} called [[Boyang]]... who, as you know, is the missing ancestor that I came here to investigate.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' All this information... it was left by your ancestor?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 1 yelan 03.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Hundreds of years ago, two of my ancestors, brothers, were gifted the [[Fantastic Compass]] by someone of great importance. They brought this device to The Chasm and joined the war against the monsters of [[Khaenri'ah]].
:{{A|vo cyaq005 1 yelan 04.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' They set out together, but only one of them made it back... minus his sanity.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 1 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Karma.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 1 yelan 05.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Correct. One possibility is that when they fought alongside [[Bosacius]], they were tainted by his karma. Neither of them had [[Vision]]s, so they wouldn't have been able to resist its effects for very long.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 1 yanfei 01.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' From reading through this, it sounds like Boyang... ended up staying here for good, {{sic|too}}
:{{A|vo cyaq005 1 yelan 06.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' ...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 1 yelan 07.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Ugh, well this is just wonderful! So that's it, there's no way out?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What do we do? Are we going to die here? But Paimon doesn't wanna die!
{{Cutscene Description|Paimon was seized by fear and accidentally knocked the compass down. Yelan and Xiao reached out to pick it up, and the compass lit up while they both touched it. Seeing this, Yanfei seems to have realized something...}}
;(A cutscene plays)
::{{A|vo cyaq005 1 cs paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon's had enough of this place... Lemme out!!!
::{{A|vo cyaq005 1 cs yelan 01.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' What was that...
::{{A|vo cyaq005 1 cs yanfei 01.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' ...I got it!
:;(Cutscene ends)

:{{A|vo cyaq005 2 yanfei 01.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' I just had a thought. Gimme a second, I just need to double-check...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 2 yanfei 02.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Aha. Mm-hmm.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 2 yanfei 03.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' (Traveler), I just realized something. Okay, so on my way here, I was studying the will the whole time, but I didn't give any thought to the book that the will was inside of.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 2 yanfei 04.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' I don't know it verbatim, but I have read it before. The gist of the story goes like this:
:{{A|vo cyaq005 2 yanfei 05.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Millennia ago, an adeptus made a magic device to seal away evil monsters. Later, he made good friends with a human, and gave the device to him to use as a catalyst.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 2 yanfei 06.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' A few years later, great demons haunted the mountains. The mortal and the adeptus joined forces to exorcise them using this same device.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 2 yanfei 07.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' And that's not all. The book also says this: "When mortal and adepti powers are combined, one can move the heavens and shake the earth. This contraption is proof that mortals and adepti may coexist, that there is unity between heaven and humanity."
:{{A|vo cyaq005 2 yanfei 08.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' I have both adepti and human lineage. Maybe my power can work...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 2 yanfei 09.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' It worked! I mean, the effect only lasted an instant, because I'm not strong enough... but still, we must be on the right track.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 2 yanfei 10.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' And look! Something seems to have been activated inside the Fantastic Compass...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 2 together 01.ogg}} '''Sound From Within the Compass:''' By heaven's might and the gods of the five regions, yaksha and mortal together take this contraption in hand...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 2 yelan 01.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' That's their voices from when they made the seal. Bosacius and my ancestor... they sealed off this space at the top together.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 2 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 2 yanfei 11.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' ...I see. It makes sense now.
:'''(Traveler):''' (Hold on, that huge crystal I saw in the bottom of The Chasm...)
:'''(Traveler):''' (I remember when the crystal hit the [[Ruin Serpent]]... there seemed to be an opposing force.)
:'''(Traveler):''' (Was it that opposing force that delayed the awakening of the space that has now swallowed us? Or did the impact weaken the entrance on the ground?)
:'''(Traveler):''' (Also... We haven't seen any Abyss monsters in here. Could this all be connected?)
:{{A|vo cyaq005 2 yanfei 12.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Everyone! Let's go back and meet up with Itto and Shinobu. I have a suggestion to make.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon can barely move anymore... Wah, why can't we get out of here, Paimon doesn't wanna die, Paimon wants to stay with you, (Traveler)...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 2 yanfei 13.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Paimon, just hang in there, okay? Trust me. There's still hope.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 2 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Let's go.
----
;(Talk to Kuki Shinobu)
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yanfei 01.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Shinobu, Itto, we're back!
:{{DIcon}} How's Itto doing?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 shinobu 01.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' He must be exhausted, because he still hasn't woken up yet. But he's not in any serious danger. So don't worry.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 shinobu 02.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' What about you guys? You found something, didn't you? It's written on your faces... but whatever it is, it's bad news, isn't it?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Umm...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 01.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' We found the Fantastic Compass. The previous owner left a message inside, and from the looks of it... there really is no way out of this space after all.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 02.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' It seems like the previous owner was stuck here forever, too.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 shinobu 03.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' ...Shoot.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yanfei 02.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' This isn't over yet. Listen to me, just now I tried channeling my power into the Fantastic Compass, and it responded.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 03.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' But all that did was activate the records from when the seal was created.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yanfei 03.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Right, but the issue wasn't with the compass. It was with the method.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yanfei 04.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Remember what the book says? "When mortal and adepti powers are combined, one can move the heavens and shake the earth."
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yanfei 05.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Only when a mortal and an adeptus combine their powers can the Fantastic Compass be fully activated.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yanfei 06.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' I'm a mix of human and adeptus, so the fact that the Fantastic Compass responded to me shows that the system is still functional. Lucky for us, we also happen to have a full adeptus and a human with training in the magic arts.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 04.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' ...Interesting. So that's what was going through your head.
:{{DIcon}} Xiao and Yelan need to cooperate?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 shinobu 04.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' So an adeptus and a human need to channel their power at the same time?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yanfei 07.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Yes. If my guess is correct, then when both of you put your full power into the Fantastic Compass, we should be able to completely reactivate it... maybe even reverse it.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yanfei 08.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Last time, it was used to seal the intersection between this place and The Chasm. If we can reverse it...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 shinobu 05.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Then we're home free.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Awesome! So there's still hope?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yanfei 09.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' You bet.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Your idea seems reasonable.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 05.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Okay, well let's all take a quick break. We'll give this thing a try once we're ready.

:'''After everyone has had a rest...'''

:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh boy, (Traveler), Paimon's so nervous...
:{{DIcon}} Don't be afraid. This is going to work.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yanfei 10.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Yelan, Xiao, how are we looking?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 06.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' I'm all set.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I'm ready.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 07.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Oh, but Yanfei, there's one thing you might need to mentally prepare yourself for.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yanfei 11.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Hmm?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 08.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' I'm afraid you probably won't be able to take the Fantastic Compass out of here. From what I can tell, everything within this domain is the result of disordered spacetime and memories.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 09.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' We all came here for different purposes, and everything that's happened here has been in response to our own imaginations and conjecture. Terrifying, but also a miracle.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 10.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' This "space"... well, it's more than just a space. Whether there's some kind of higher power at work here, I don't know, but... the whole time, it's been reading our minds and responding to us in the form of illusions.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 11.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Also, according to the history of The Chasm, this place must've existed for a very long time... What could've created it?
:{{DIcon}} I remember a giant snake just outside this space...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 12.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Oh, that. Yeah, I was there, too.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Wait a second... it was you that shot that arrow!?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 13.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Who else did you think it was...?
:{{DIcon}} When the crystal attacked the giant snake...
:{{DIcon}} Does that have anything to do with why the ground split open?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 14.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' That snake is probably a remnant of Khaenri'ahn civilization... And crystals are highly effective against it... Maybe there was some sort of opposing reaction between those two forces?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 15.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' If so... I'm extremely sorry, everyone. It looks like I might be the one responsible for all of this.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No, no, you're just trying to help us and solve the problem! You're definitely not to blame for what happened.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 16.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' ...If you say so.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 17.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' You could almost liken this bizarre space to a living being that throws all kinds of hallucinations at us to deceive us. Everyone we've seen here, and all the paths we've walked... it all ceased to exist 500 years ago.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 18.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Additionally, most of the things here are static. So if we really do manage to escape, then once time starts moving normally again... the Fantastic Compass will likely disappear.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yanfei 12.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' That's actually what I think, too. That's precisely why it's such a miracle that we even found the Fantastic Compass to begin with.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' This whole thing feels like we're breaking free from our shackles using a spear that by rights should not exist.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 19.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' This is a long shot, but it may be our last chance... so, whose wish was it that summoned this device?
:{{DIcon}} Perhaps it was all of us.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yanfei 13.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Perhaps it was. But maybe there's another reason: your incredibly strong commitment to your search.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yanfei 14.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' It's a shame that we couldn't find your family... But if they were here, I'm sure they'd want nothing more than to see you being rescued from this place.
:{{DIcon}} ...Yeah.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 20.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' I gotta say, it does intrigue me, the way we all ended up here together.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 21.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' If this is fate, then let's grab it in our hands and turn it around.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 shinobu 06.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Leave the boss to Ushi and me. We're ready.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 22.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Traveler, take care of Paimon. Yanfei, you might need to come closer to me when the time comes.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yanfei 15.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Sure.
:{{DIcon}} Alright.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 3 yelan 23.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' ...
{{Cutscene Description|Yelan and Xiao activate the arcane formation and it gradually lights up. Xiao sustains the formation from within while Yelan protects everyone else, fending off the dark shadows drawn to your location. High above you, the formation opens a path of light. When the party is too exhausted to drive away the shadows, a familiar power intervenes and sends you above ground. The [[Zhongli|owner of this power]] leaves after seeing that you are all safe.}}

::'''Yelan:''' Do as I command!
::'''Paimon:''' It lit up!
::'''Yanfei:''' Aha...
::'''Yanfei:''' The Fantastic Compass is an amplifier
::'''Yanfei:''' Maintain this energy level
::'''Yanfei:''' And we may stand a chance
::'''Xiao:''' I will maintain the energy flow
::'''Yelan:''' Understood
::'''Xiao:''' Everyone, stand back
::'''Bosacius:''' I shall hold the line
::'''Bosacius:''' By sealing the surface
::'''Xiao:''' ...As yakshas
::'''Xiao:''' We must fight for this world
::'''Xiao:''' General Alatus
::'''Xiao:''' Falling in!
::;(While traveling towards the surface, shadowy, humanoid wisps gather around the party and attempt to strike)
::'''Yelan:''' Watch out!
::;(Yelan cuts down some of the wisps. Seeing the danger, Xiao pours more power into the device and remembers a meeting he had shortly before arriving at The Chasm)
::'''Zhongli:''' ...This trip may be dangerous

::'''Xiao:''' I have guarded this place for several hundred years
::'''Xiao:''' Only to seek the nameless yaksha
::'''Xiao:''' Do I request your approval
::;(Yanfei and the Traveler help cut down more wisps, but as they grow closer to the surface, an enormous mass of darkness threatens to envelop them. Xiao uses his power to break through.)
::'''Xiao:''' Hya!
::;(Having expended his strength, Xiao is no longer able to maintain the platform and it begins to crack.)
::'''Yanfei:''' You can't keep this up... your strength won't last...
::;(Xiao musters the last of his strength to send the others to the surface before him.)
::'''Paimon:''' Xiao!
::;(The platform finally shatters, sending Xiao falling to the depths when a golden light enters from the surface and envelops Xiao. Next thing Xiao knows, he is on the surface with the others. Zhongli, who has been looking on from a nearby cliff, leaves the scene.)

:'''Finally out of the danger zone, everyone rests and starts chatting...'''

:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 yanfei 01.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' That was close! I thought you were gonna get left behind... I'm so glad you're okay, that was terrifying...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Hm.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 yelan 01.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' I know what you were thinking, but...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 yelan 02.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Never mind. I know I can't talk you out of a mindset that's been built up over a lifetime.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 yelan 03.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' I don't think we were ever going to reach an agreement over the final strategy. But in the end, it was thanks to you that we managed to escape. So thank you for saving us all.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' No. I could not have done this on my strength alone.
:{{DIcon}} So thanks to you, too, Yelan.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 yelan 04.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Don't mention it.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 yelan 05.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Looks like everyone got out unscathed, but you all look pretty exhausted. Rest up, there's no hurry to move on from here.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 yelan 06.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' As for me, I'm gonna check the area for any unusual activity.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' She's gone... Paimon didn't even get to say thank-you...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 yanfei 02.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Maybe Yelan really doesn't believe she made a contribution. It seems like she's convinced Xiao saved us all... including her, and she doesn't know what to say to that.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 yanfei 03.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' And since it's not easy to persuade Xiao of anything. Maybe Yelan's just given up trying to talk to him.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Xiao, she's criticizing you.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 yanfei 04.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Am not!
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' You speak only the truth. I have no quarrel with that.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I will keep your words in mind.
:{{DIcon}} Seems like you got through to him.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 yanfei 05.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Really? Well, that's great. I count that as quite an achievement.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 yanfei 06.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' It was a perilous situation we were faced with underground, and it took every single one of us for any of us to make it out alive. I feel lucky that we didn't lose anyone along the way.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, so Bull-Chucker still hasn't woken up yet... surely he's not gonna stay asleep forever? Is he?
:{{DIcon}} I doubt it.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Let's go check on him!
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 itto 01.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' *yawn*! Ah, I slept like a rock, good times... Huh? What're you doing? What's going on? Why you looking at me like that?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 shinobu 01.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Are you in any pain?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 ushio 01.ogg}} '''Ushi:''' Moo, moo!
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, the head? What about it? Is there any brain damage from the impact?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 yanfei 07.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' You need to tell us if you're not feeling well.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You weren't that bright to begin with, so if we add brain damage to the equation... oh brother...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 itto 02.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' The heck are you guys talking about? I'm fine! I had an epic power nap, and now I feel like a million Mora.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 itto 03.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' I feel like I'm forgetting something, though... Oh, yeah! Wait... Weren't we underground? How did we get back up here?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 yanfei 08.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' It's a long story. We'll fill you in later.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 yanfei 09.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Itto, we're indebted to you, Shinobu, and Ushi. We couldn't have escaped this predicament without your help.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 yanfei 10.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' I'm the reason you all got caught up in this. Please accept my apologies and let me find some way to compensate you for the trouble!
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 itto 04.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Ah, crazy talk. You helped us first, of course we were gonna return the favor.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 itto 05.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hey, if it weren't for you, we'd still be in a Liyue jail cell right now!
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 shinobu 02.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' That's not quite correct. You'd be in jail, not me.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 ushio 02.ogg}} '''Ushi:''' Moo.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 yanfei 11.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Hahaha, good point. Well, okay then, how about this: To celebrate our newfound friendships, how about you let me take you to Liyue Harbor for some sightseeing and a proper meal?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 itto 06.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' I like the sound of that! Now that you mention it, whew... I am famished... I can barely walk here...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 shinobu 03.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' I'm hungry too, Senpai. Why don't we head straight over?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon too, Paimon wants to come too!
:{{DIcon}} Paimon, we have other things to do.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Ugh, fine...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 yanfei 12.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Alright, (Traveler), well I promise I'll take good care of your friends from Inazuma. Take it easy, okay? What we just went through was a lot.
:{{DIcon}} Yeah. This has been tough on everyone.
:{{DIcon}} Have fun, you guys!
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 yanfei 13.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Oh wait, Yelan left already... I was gonna treat her to some tea, but I'll take this to mean we're square, hehehe.

:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 itto 07.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Hmm? Oh yeah? Is that right, whoa... Okay, I'll let them know.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 itto 08.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' (Traveler), Flying Lavender Melon, Ushi has a couple of words he'd like you to pass on for him.

:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 shinobu 04.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Oh, I wanna hear this.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 yanfei 14.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Me too. Count me in!

:'''Itto translates what Ushi said for everyone...'''

:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Good idea. Let's do that!
:{{DIcon}} Okay.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Paimon never would have guessed that Ushi was so gentle and thoughtful... Never judge a bull by its cover, huh.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 ushio 04.ogg}} '''Ushi:''' Moo.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 shinobu 05.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' Sometimes the profoundest truths can also be the simplest. I think Ushi's words may well come in handy.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 paimon 12.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You betcha, just leave it to us.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 yanfei 15.ogg}} '''Yanfei:''' Alright, Itto, Shinobu, Ushi, let's go.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 itto 09.ogg}} '''Arataki Itto:''' Aw yeah! Grub time!
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 ushio 05.ogg}} '''Ushi:''' Moo!
:{{A|vo cyaq005 4 shinobu 06.ogg}} '''Kuki Shinobu:''' See you next time.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} Xiao.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Finished taking care of business?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, there wasn't any "business"... we were just saying goodbye to our friends.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 yelan 01.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Huh, you're still here.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 yelan 02.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' I saw the two Inazumans leave with Yanfei, heading towards Liyue Harbor.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 yelan 03.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Aren't you going with them?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We still had some stuff we wanted to say to Xiao.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 yelan 04.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Hmm, I figured as much.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 yelan 05.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' I've checked the area, nothing strikes me as out of the ordinary. Looks like this chapter has come to a close.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 yelan 06.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Now I just need to take care of the confidentiality issues. Hehe... Let's hope our friends from overseas can keep their mouths shut, for their own sakes.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Uhhh, we got it, we got it! We'll make sure they don't say anything, please don't hurt them!
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 yelan 07.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Oh?
:{{DIcon}} You've got a mean streak, Yelan.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 yelan 08.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' You've figured me out, huh? Hahaha. Alright, I'll quit pulling your leg.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 yelan 09.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Everyone really rose to the occasion this time. I won't ever forget what we went through.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 yelan 10.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Where could that strange space have come from... and how has it existed down there undetected for so many years...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 yelan 11.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' I have to investigate this further. I have a feeling that whatever lies behind all this runs deep... maybe so deep that no one can be allowed to know.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 yelan 12.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Also, I think someone helped us out at the last minute... They did a good deed, of course, but somehow I couldn't tell anything about them. It must've been someone of great importance.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 yelan 13.ogg}} '''Yelan:''' Anyway, these questions will have to wait for another time. I have some follow-up work to do and reports to make, so it's back to Liyue Harbor for me. See you when I see you.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Bye, Yelan!
:{{DIcon}} ...Alright.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' You knew I was waiting for you?
:{{DIcon}} Yes, it was obvious.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Really...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' There's somewhere I want to go. If you have the time, you can join me.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Where is it?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 5 xiao 07.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' A place that has to do with the yakshas.
----
;(Approach the marked area)
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 01.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' The temple up ahead was built to remember [[Pervases]].
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 02.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Maybe I came here because I had a realization.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' You mean back when we were underground?
:{{DIcon}} What did you realize?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 03.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' It's hard to put into words... Seeing Bosacius gave me the false impression that I'd traveled back into the past.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 04.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...You could dress up the yaksha's life and call us valiant warriors, veterans of war, but... the truth is, we are slaughterers, and nothing more.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 05.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' For Bosacius, perhaps dying in the heat of a great battle was no tragedy.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 06.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' And perhaps the same is true for me. After living for so long... to die in the act of saving others would not have been a terrible thing.
:{{DIcon}} I think you know that that isn't true.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 07.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Mm. So maybe... these thoughts are my own form of insanity.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey, don't say that...
:{{DIcon}} Xiao, we've got something to tell you.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, yeah! Ushi wanted us to tell you. It's very important.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 08.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Hmm?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ushi said he has the power to exorcise demons, so people use him to fend them off. But after he met Itto, he's never left his side.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' He also said that he doesn't have any grand philosophies, he just thinks we should spend our lives around the people who make us happiest.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Maybe there aren't so many rules about how we should or shouldn't live our lives in this world after all. So... he hopes you can come to understand that even though the power of a yaksha may be harmful to other people, it doesn't mean you shouldn't hang out with them.
:{{DIcon}} There will always be someone willing to be by your side.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yep, like people with Visions &mdash; they have more resistance against your power, right? And, and... Well, anyway, there's loads of people out there who really care about you!
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 09.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Hah. Suddenly, you sound a lot like Bosacius and the others.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 10.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' They used to talk about how they hoped to live a mortal's life once the world was at peace. I think... I was the only one who didn't think that way.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 11.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' The Bosacius recorded in the Fantastic Compass had lost his sanity. He addressed the people around him as "Alatus," "Menogias," and others. These are the names of the Five Yakshas.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 12.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I am Alatus, and [[Menogias]] is General Kapisas.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 13.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' The others are [[Bonanus]], or "General Chizapus," and [[Indarias]], or "General Musatas." I heard that people call the five of us "Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti"... Hah.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 14.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Bosacius and Yelan's ancestor stayed underground to the end. So that space must have read their minds in their last moments as they approached death.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 15.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Yelan was right in everything she said. Both of our proposals had their drawbacks, and both were sensible suggestions. But the power of that space was far beyond all of us.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 16.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I couldn't have done all I did without everyone's help. Even in the final moments, it took every bit of my power to break free from that place...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well Paimon still thinks you were amazing!
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 17.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Yanfei and Yelan are correct. I always prepare for the worst-case scenario. This mindset is deeply rooted in me... Even so, it was the most optimistic solution I could think of.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 18.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' If [[Rex Lapis]] hadn't saved me in that moment, I don't think I would've been able to escape.
:{{DIcon}} So that was [[Zhongli]]'s power back there...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 19.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' In the end, I still had to burden another.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' But that's how it should be, right? You've known Zhongli... uh, Rex Lapis for such a long time, and you've helped him before. So he helped you back, what's the big deal?
:{{DIcon}} Agreed.
:{{DIcon}} Supporting each other is how people survive.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 20.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Perhaps.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 21.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' In the moment that we escaped from that space, I could sense what was left of Bosacius's memory. If I had to say what I gained from this trip, I think that would be it.
:{{DIcon}} I think I felt it too.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 22.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' It's good that one more person will remember him.
{{Cutscene Description|In the lightless Chasm, the yaksha Bosacius and the Millelith thaumaturge once supported each other when all hope seemed to have been lost. Bosacius &mdash; whose mind was so confused that he had forgotten his identity and past &mdash; often mistook Boyang for others. As time elapsed, Boyang realized that he could never reunite with his family, and that Bosacius, his only companion here, was reaching the end of his life. Bosacius may have been seeing visions, for his family &mdash; four yakshas each holding a light in hand who were now in the form of shadows — walked past him. In Bosacius's last moments, the yaksha finally recalled his name and past: that he was Bosacius, and his destiny was to make the ultimate sacrifice.}}

:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 23.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I've said so much today. But I don't need to hold back as much when I talk to you.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 24.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Have you ever had a moment where you felt like you were aware of your destiny? The potential of life, the approach of death... whatever it might have been.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 25.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' By now, I have accepted that destiny is the one disaster that the yaksha knows most keenly of all. We are destined to misery... and yet we have no fear.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Xiao...
:{{DIcon}} Are you sure it's okay for you to tell me all this?
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 26.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' It matters not. Rex Lapis had said that you are a witness. It is right that the events of the world are relayed to you.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 27.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Bonanus, Menogias, and Indarias all perished, and only Bosacius's fate was unknown. This has always stung my heart like a thorn. That is why I went to The Chasm, despite being fully aware of the danger.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 28.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...Now that I know what happened in The Chasm back then, I can finally put this matter to rest.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 29.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Before we left that place, I picked up a stone. I thought if I could take it out with me, I would place it in the temple to [[Pervases]] in memory of Bosacius.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 30.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Unfortunately, the stone did not survive.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 31.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Pervases died in the Archon War thousands of years ago. He was younger than us, and Bosacius was very sad when he passed.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 32.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Too many yakshas have become casualties of battle. We are like a flock of birds scattered to the four corners of the world. And in the end, as Bonanus said... it's rare for a yaksha to find repose for their soul.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 33.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Bosacius, Boyang, and all those soldiers...
:{{DIcon}} No, Xiao... They are all heroes.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 34.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Heroes...
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 35.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' ...I like that word.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 36.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' Maybe the world will never be free of disaster. But there is good in the world, too. Even the darkest hearts have room for those they cherish.
:{{A|vo cyaq005 6 xiao 37.ogg}} '''Xiao:''' I accept your advice. From this day on, heroes will always look out for each other.

;(Talk to Xiao again)
:'''Xiao:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} (You observe Xiao)
:'''The World is Silent; No One Speaks:''' (Xiao says nothing more. Complex emotions run across his face as he looks at the temple to Pervases.)
:'''The World is Silent; No One Speaks:''' (Sadness, disappointment, relief... They are all there, yet are only a small part of a far larger whole.)
:'''The World is Silent; No One Speaks:''' (His expression is akin to that of a person who has been out in the blizzard for too long and seen far too much of it before finally gaining a place of respite from the battering snow.)

==Trivia==
*The "gods of the five regions" spoken about by the Sound From Within the Compass is likely a reference to the {{lang|{{w|Wufang Shangdi}}|zh=五方上帝}}, who in Chinese folk religion refers to the fivefold manifestation of the supreme God of Heaven. The five regions are north, south, east, west, and center.
*The Sound From Within the Compass refers to the Fantastic Compass as an {{lang|{{w|armillary sphere}}|zh=玑衡|zh_rm=jī héng}} in the original Chinese text. Notably, this term is usually localized in English as "equilibrium": the Chinese name for the [[Verses of Equilibrium]], an ancient text about Rex Lapis and the yakshas, is {{lang|"Armillary Sphere Scriptures"|zh=玑衡经}}, while [[Ningguang]]'s constellation, [[Opus Aequilibrium]], is {{lang|"Armillary Sphere Apparatus Constellation"|zh=玑衡仪座}}.

===Incantation of the Fantastic Compass===
In order to activate the arcane formation of the [[Fantastic Compass]], Yelan recites a 4 × 8 character incantation (with an orthodox concluding remark) in the format of a Taoist incantation:

Notably, the character {{Lang|mini=1|zh=帝}} also appears in Zhongli's title, {{Lang|mini=1|zh=岩王帝君|zh_rm=Yánwáng Dìjūn|zh_tn=Rex Lapis}}.</ref>
|-
| Do as I command!
| {{Lang|mini=1|zh=急急如律令！|zh_rm=<br />Jíjí rú lǜlìng!}}
| Urgently do as I command!<ref group="TN •">This is a common Taoist incantation used to ward off evil spirits. The incantation is originally a common concluding remark of the official documents of the Han Dynasty, to emphasise the urgency of the documents. Later, it was used by Taoists, Onmyoji, and shamans as an orthodox concluding remark in exorcism.</ref><ref group="TN •">Many of the verses used in the incantation are derived from real-life Taoist scriptures, such as the Lingbao Wuliang Duren Shangjing Dafa {{Lang|zh=灵宝无量度人上经大法}}, Taishang Sandong Shenzhou {{Lang|zh=太上三洞神咒}}, and the Lingbao Yujian {{Lang|zh=灵宝玉鉴}}. Two of the aforementioned texts originate from the {{w|Lingbao School}} {{Lang|zh=灵宝派|zh_rm=Língbǎo-pài}} of Taoism.</ref>
