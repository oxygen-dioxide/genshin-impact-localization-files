==Descriptions==
{{Description|Hilichurl wanderers unaffiliated with any specific tribe. They can often be found roving the wilds as if in voluntary exile.<br>They may also lend their aid to other hilichurls or hilichurl tribes for various reasons and go their separate ways afterward. They seem to possess a higher level of intelligence than commonplace hilichurls.|[[Archive]]}}
