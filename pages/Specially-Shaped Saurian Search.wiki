==Challenges==
*For all challenges, the player is teleported to a different area containing the special boss battle. This area uses the overworld map and terrain, but teleport waypoints are missing from the area, and the map is bounded.
**There are also cannons on the map, used by Ranjit. They appear on the map regardless of whether the player uses the relevant Negotiation Strategy.
**Attempting to open the map causes the message "Challenge ongoing, unable to perform this action" to appear.
**Until the battle is activated, the player also does not take any fall damage, and all skill, attack, and burst UI is not present. The player can dive inside Fontaine's waters, but is unable to dash underwater despite being able to dash on land and while swimming on the surface water.
**Once the battle is activated, a boundary around the boss is formed, similar to those of weekly bosses. If there was a mechanic (wind current or <abbr title="Apparently an article/name for these don't exist?">Fontainian water ring</abbr>) specifically added to the map to return to Ranjit's area, the mechanic disappears.
{{Dialogue Start}}
:;If the player attempts to leave the bounds, Paimon turns the player back:
:'''Paimon:''' Let's focus on the task Ranjit's given us, alright?
{{Dialogue End}}
*Inside the challenge area, there is a <abbr title="it appears between the domain exit button and quest menu">book icon</abbr> that the player can open. Pressing this icon opens a description, split into two pages:
*Opponent's Details
**This page contains the same information as other places that Opponent's Details are given
*Negotiation Strategies
**{{Color|menu|Selected Negotiation Strategies}} 
***This section of the page lists the negotiation strategies chosen by the player.
**<abbr title="This section only appears on Fearless difficulty.">{{Color|menu|Additional Effects}}</abbr> 
*** When the number of Negotiation Strategies selected is {{Color|help|greater than or equal to}} 2, or fewer than 2, opponents' levels increase by <abbr title="Which number is colored depends on how many strategies were actually chosen by the player.">0 or {{Color|help|10}}.</abbr>
***When the number of Negotiation Strategies selected is <abbr title="Which number is colored depends on how many strategies were actually chosen by the player.">4/3/2/1/{{Color|help|0}}</abbr>, opponents' HP increases to <abbr title="Which number is colored depends on how many strategies were actually chosen by the player.">100%/200%/325%/475%/{{Color|help|650%}}</abbr> of the original value
*Inside the challenge area, there are challenge objectives. These are the same as the ones listed in each difficulty description.
**For Fearless difficulty, the timer only appears if the player has not selected any Negotiation Strategies.
*There is a bubble around the special boss before the player activates the battle at the floating key (similar to the key in spiral abyss). There are also options to configure party members and Negotiation Strategies at the key.
