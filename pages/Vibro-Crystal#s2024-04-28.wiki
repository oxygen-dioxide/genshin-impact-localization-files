{{Description|Two engineers from [[Fontaine]] have arrived at the outskirts of [[The Chasm]] to develop economically viable products on the basis of Vibro-Crystal theory, and thus have decided that they require more data on the harmonic resonance between these "Vibro-Crystals." Connect Transmitter and Receiver Crystals to try out the various harmonic responses produced and defeat your enemies with ease.
}}
'''Vibro-Crystal Applications''' is a combat [[Event]] in [[Version 4.6]].

==Event Details==
===Duration===
* 2024/04/28 10:00 - 2024/05/09 03:59

===Requirements===
* [[Adventure Rank]] 28 or above
* Complete the [[Archon Quest]] "[[The Fond Farewell]]"

===Summary===
*  During the event, you must split your characters into 2 parties for the challenge. A new challenge will be unlocked each day. Complete the challenges to obtain [[Primogem]]s, [[Hero's Wit]], [[Weapon Ascension Material]]s, and other rewards.
* During the first 6 days of the "Vibro-Crystal Applications" event, one new challenge will be unlocked each day.
* During the "Vibro-Crystal Applications" event, you must split your characters into 2 parties for the challenge. Before you start combat, you may equip each party with a Vibro-Crystal Harmonics Schema. Combine Transmitter Crystals and Receiver Crystals to obtain different combat buffs.
* Each Transmitter Crystal can only project its radiation upon one Receiver Crystal, but each Receiver can receive transmissions from 3 Transmitters. Using different Transmitter Crystals to trigger Receivers will increase their effects.
* During this challenge, you must defeat opponents that constantly emerge to obtain points within the allotted time. Once the challenge ends, you will gain different insignias based on the number of points you gained.
* Although there are no additional rewards for completing a given challenge with over 10,000 points, a [[File:Vibro-Crystal Research Medal 4.png|30px]] platinum medal will be awarded.
* Under {{Cx}} points [[File:Vibro-Crystal Research Medal 0.png|30px]] no medal will be awarded.
