'''Bond of Life''' is a mechanic that prevents healing, applied to a character by some enemy, weapon, or talent effects.

While Bond of Life is active, it absorbs healing for the character based on its base value and prevents the character from being healed, and clears after healing equal to its value is obtained or when the player visits a [[Statue of The Seven]]. After Bond of Life is cleared, certain additional effects may be applied depending on the source.

The max value of Bond of Life is '''200%''' of a character's Max HP. The Bond of Life is shown as a red outline over the character's HP bar, taking over <code>(X/2)%</code> of the HP bar where <code>X% of Max HP</code> is the current Bond of Life value. For example, 100% Bond of Life will visually overlay 50% of the HP bar.

If not manually cleared, Bond of Life will automatically clear once '''600''' seconds (10 minutes) have passed since its last increase.
