==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Approach a Treasure mark before reading the Treasure Hoarder's Notes)
:'''Paimon:''' That's one weird symbol. Did someone leave it here?

;(Read the Treasure Hoarder's Notes)
:'''Treasure Hoarder's Notes:''' "...This used to be where the great pirate Rinzou stored his treasure. The lads moved the last few chests out..."
:'''Treasure Hoarder's Notes:''' "...Rinzou was a cunning man in life, though, and he left all manner of special symbols on the island..."
:'''Treasure Hoarder's Notes:''' "...It might be a smokescreen, or there might really be treasure. But we'll only find out if we go there and see for ourselves..."
:'''Treasure Hoarder's Notes:''' "...We've found some of those symbols. Well, time waits for no one. Best we go dig up Rinzou's full hoard!"
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, this is... really long... Paimon really can't be bothered to read any of this other than the bit about treasure...
:'''Paimon:''' Wait... Treasure!?
:'''Paimon:''' C'mon, Traveler, there's treasure to be had! We can't let the Treasure Hoarders get ahead of us!

;(Approach Treasure Mark #1)
:'''Paimon:''' This must be a symbol that the pirates left behind. That means treasure!

;(Approach Treasure Mark #2)
:'''Paimon:''' It's this symbol. The treasure's gotta be here!

;(Approach Treasure Mark #3)
:'''Paimon:''' This symbol must stand for treasure. Let's get digging!

;(Approach Treasure Mark #4)
:'''Paimon:''' Hehe, where there's treasure marks, there's treasure!

;(Approach Treasure Marks #5, #6, #7 and #8)
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, someone's been here before. Those Treasure Hoarders...!

;(Approach the camp that contains Rinzou's Letter)
:'''Paimon:''' It's the Treasure Hoarders! What are they sneaking around here for...

;(Defeat the Treasure Hoarders in that camp)
:'''Paimon:''' Let's see if they've got anything nice stashed away!

==Notes==
* Finding all 8 '''Treasure Marks''' grants the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' [[achievement]] "[[Long John Silver]]".
* Obtaining '''Rinzou's Signet''' grants the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' [[achievement]] "[[A Distant Sea Shepherd's Treasure]]".
** This achievement can be obtained without visiting any of the Treasure Marks, as Rinzou's Letter is available right after reading the Treasure Hoarder's Notes
