|description    = A metal street light, oft to be found in the [[city of Mondstadt]], upon which hangs a vertical flag.<br>They say that the production of the poles thereof burned through a stockpile of metals built up over many years due to their use of solid metal, and created a lot of business for the blacksmiths.<br>Which was just as well: with the [[Knights of Favonius|Knights]] no longer venturing abroad often and the limitations of relying on selling weapons to adventurers for income, the life of a blacksmith can be quite tough.
