'''Treasure-Seeking Seelie''' is an event gadget from the recurring event [[Lost Riches]] that is used to search for [[Iron Coin]]s. It is obtained from the Event Quest involving [[Ulman]].

==Description==
Activating the Treasure-Seeking Seelie can only be done in a Treasure Area. There is a 30s cooldown. When not in a Treasure Area, activation will not have any effect and will enter a 5s cooldown instead.

The Treasure-Seeking Seelie's brightness and the size of its single white "eye" depend on how close the player is to any dig spot. The closer the player is, the brighter the Seelie is and the bigger its eye is; the further a player is, the dimmer the Seelie is and the smaller its eye is. If the player is too far away from all remaining dig spots, then the Treasure-Seeking Seelie may disappear and refuse to be summoned, even if the player is in a Treasure Area, until the player is closer to another dig spot.

Dig spots have a diameter of roughly 2 sprints, and the Treasure-Seeking Seelie will sparkle and beep when the player is up to 2 sprints away from the edge of a dig spot. In [[Lost Riches/2021-01-08|the first Lost Riches]], the player must manually find the dig spot based on the Treasure-Seeking Seelie's reactions. In [[Lost Riches/2021-08-06|the second Lost Riches]], the Treasure-Seeking Seelie also flies to the dig spot; it sparkles and beeps without moving if it is almost close enough to fly to the dig spot. Digging up a spot rewards 4, 8 or 20 [[Iron Coin]]s, for a maximum of 60 Iron Coins per treasure area. In addition to Iron Coins, digging may spawn a small amount of ores or a small amount of food and cooking ingredients, similar to regular [[Investigation]] locations. Sometimes, after digging up Iron Coins, Treasure Hoarders will appear. They do not need to be defeated to proceed with the event.

When a character is in a combat state, the Treasure-Seeking Seelie will disappear and will only reappear (without a need to resummon) when the battle is over. (This is not true for dig spots, as they can still be found and interacted with while in combat.<!-- right for the first Lost Riches, but not sure about the second Lost Riches -->) However, the Treasure-Seeking Seelie will be dismissed completely and needs to be equipped and resummoned again if the character equips any other gadget.

When all treasures have been collected for the day, using the Treasure-Seeking Seelie will give the message: "It seems that there are no treasures left to collect today. Summon Treasure-Seeking Seelie tomorrow and try your luck again!"

After the event ends, the Treasure-Seeking Seelie will be removed from the inventory.

==Known bugs==
* The Mini-seelie's cooldown stops at 0.1 seconds. Restart the game.
