==Description==
Feeling defeated, it dawned on the [[Skyrider]] that there are things that swordsmanship cannot achieve.<br>
So instead of believing in his swordsmanship, he turned to the sword itself.<br>
"Bigger is always better, and swords are no exception," he thought.<br>
In the grand Guyun Stone Forest, he embraced his grand ending.<br>
His dream of flight came to an end, but his sword and story would never fade...
