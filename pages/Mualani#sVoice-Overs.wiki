But if you wanna know the best item in my shop, I'd have to say it's this inflatable swimsuit. It's perfect if you're not a confident swimmer. It can inflate instantly to become a life preserver, which makes swimming way safer!<br>You can wear it out of the water, too. Personally, I love wearing it to parties. It's a real showstopper! See, just do this, and you can bounce around... boing... boing...<br>Oh, and it even comes in lucky colors!

They feel like friends, you know?<br>The rolling waves, swaying seagrass, fluttering leaves... They're all like beloved dance instructors to me. Just follow their beat and rhythm, maybe give a twirl, a bit of side-to-side, and you're dancing! Well? Don't just stand there. C'mon, give it a go!

If you ever get lost on the road, just let me know! I'm a pretty good guide, if a do say so myself! I'll find a way forward even if that means carving out an entirely new path with my surfboard!

|vo_07_01_friendship = 4
|vo_07_01_file       = VO_{language}{character} About the Vision.ogg
|vo_07_01_tx         = For a while, I hung my Vision on my swimming floater. After all, its azure color matches really well. But later, I completely forgot about it while playing volleyball with my friends. The floater landed on the sand, and I swear I almost heard something break! But, when I checked, my Vision was still in one piece! So, all in all, I think it was actually a sign of good luck!

|vo_07_02_tx         = You're not scared of dogs, right? 'Cause you have to meet my family's dog! He loves to play and tries to get pets from anyone he sees. I always bring him to the water to play. He even knows how to surf, actually. That's my little doggie, already carving the waves better than me!<br>I'll introduce you sometime. I'm sure his tail will be wagging and whirling like a propeller. Just be careful not to get whacked... It hurts, hahahaha!

|vo_07_03_tx         = The [[Koholasaur]]s around the People of the Springs love hot springs just as much as we do. We often find them soaking in the same springs as us. But if you're unsure about their temper, it's best to keep your distance.<br>Oh? How do you judge the temperament of a Koholasaur? Haha, my method is super simple. Just slowly approach them, and you'll know pretty quick... If they don't bite, they're probably pretty chill... If they do try to bite, well... just think of it like a little love nip, I guess.

|vo_08_01_tx         = The [[Pyro Archon]] is the most respected figure in all of [[Natlan]]. I really admire her, not only because she's the Pyro Archon, but because... she looks super cool when she surfs!<br>I've challenged her to a race before, actually... Huh? You wanna know who was faster? In that case, let's race, and I'll tell you once you beat me!

|vo_08_02_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Kachina.ogg
|vo_08_02_tx         = Kachina is incredibly gentle and kind. From everything she says, it's clear she's always thinking about others. She has so many great qualities, but she's constantly overlooked and ridiculed because she doesn't stand up for herself. *sigh* I know she can handle herself, it's just... I worry about her lack of confidence. More often than not, she ends up believing the awful things people say about her. So, I've made it my personal mission to encourage her and share her strengths with all the people around me. I'm sure one day, everyone will see her in a new light!

|vo_08_03_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Kinich.ogg
|vo_08_03_tx         = [[Ajaw]] will say more in a day than Kinich in a whole year. It can't be easy having to deal with all of Ajaw's antics, but somehow Kinich always manages to do his own thing. Now that I think about it, the only time they seem equally uninterested is when I talk about horoscopes...

|vo_08_04_friendship = 4
|vo_08_04_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Chasca.ogg
|vo_08_04_tx         = I met Chasca when I was little. We even fought over toys a few times... I was pretty surprised when I heard she became a Peacekeeper. They say some people mature really slowly, while others grow up in an instant. Sometimes, I wonder if I've even started...
|vo_08_04_mention    = Chasca

|vo_08_05_title      = About [[Citlali]]

|vo_08_05_tx         = Granny Citlali is without a doubt the most experienced priestess I've ever seen. She's more than just an elder, she's like the coolest elder ever! Her predictions are always super accurate. A long time ago, she said the lucky colors for my business were pink and blue. Sure enough, pink and blue floaters are now my top sellers!<br>While I was bugging her... uh, I mean, visiting her recently, she mentioned there was an outlander who could bring me good fortune... Ah, wait a sec! Aren't you an outlander!?

|vo_08_06_tx         = Iansan is the pride of the [[Collective of Plenty]] and all of Natlan. She's been a part of so many [[Pilgrimage]]s, and is still unbeaten to this day! I registered for her training class, actually, paid the tuition fee and everything. I just haven't started because, uh... I've been too busy to train...<br>Okay, fine. I'll admit... When I saw what Kachina looked like when she finished her training, I heard a voice inside me say, "Hey, you belong in the water. Stay on dry land for too long, and you'll wind up stranded there." Sometimes, you've just gotta listen to your heart!
|vo_08_06_mention    = Iansan,Kachina

|vo_08_07_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Xilonen.ogg
|vo_08_07_tx         = If the Pyro Archon acknowledges a craftsperson, then you know she's good. Even if an [[Ancient Name]] got all smashed up, I bet she could make it good as new again. Wait, did I just jinx something? An Ancient Name absolutely cannot get smashed. That would be so bad. I take it back! I take it back! I didn't say anything. And you didn't hear anything either, alright?
|vo_08_07_mention    = Xilonen

|vo_08_08_title      = About [[Ifa]]
|vo_08_08_friendship = 4
|vo_08_08_file       = VO_{language}{character} About Ifa.ogg
|vo_08_08_tx         = Ifa is the best! No matter what we invite him to do, he's always happy to join. And he's super quick and efficient at everything, too. If he wasn't already working as a vet, I think he'd make a pretty great water sports coach. Hmm? Is he from a different tribe? Well, yeah, but that won't be a problem at all!
|vo_08_08_mention    = Ifa

|vo_08_09_tx         = Wow, you really know just about everybody! Mizuki's a good friend of the People of the Springs. She might come across as the quiet type, but she's actually really chatty. Whatever the conversation, she can keep it going for as long as you let her... Hehe, it's easy to lose track of time when you're talking to her.<br>Oh, this reminds me! She's opening a new branch of her business in Natlan soon. Have you got time? You wanna come show your support? I'm gonna give her some purple floaters as a gift. I hope she likes them!

|vo_08_10_tx         = Varesa... Oh! Varesa! She's that girl who has super strength, but never does so well in the Pilgrimage, right? Iansan brought her here for swimming training once. She used to lie on the beach reading comics during her down time, so I got to read a few over her shoulder. She can list off the names of so many ancient heroes, including loads from the People of the Springs &mdash; even ones I didn't really know of! She's pretty awesome.

|vo_09_02_tx         = Being a good guide means relying on experience. Our ancestors left behind many practices to learn from. But don't worry, I'm not the type to blindly follow old advice and customs. I only swear by the ones I've tried and found to be useful.<br>Huh? Which ones were a bust? Hmm... Well, one time I was out exploring, and I could see a river with a bridge up ahead. But the map wanted me to cross the river with a boat. I measured the river's current and then checked the bridge for any traps or hidden dangers... But, in the end, it turned out that our ancestors didn't recommend using the bridge because... it hadn't been built yet! <br>So, yeah. Experience is key...

But honestly, I'm equally grateful to them for sharing their experiences with me, chatting about their hometown, and telling me stories I've never heard before... So, in a way, every trip turns into my own kind of journey, as well!

Sometimes people pull me aside and tell me I'm too enthusiastic, to the point of being a little overwhelming. So, now, I try to tone it down a bit at the beginning, and let them warm up to me first...<br>Oh, and please tell me if I'm ever too much, okay? Don't worry about hurting my feelings.

|vo_09_05_tx         = Challenges have a way of revealing a person's true potential. Participating in the Pilgrimage really made me understand that! But, in a tough situation, I still think two people are better than one. Every person counts... By working together, we can make our own miracles!<br>Take the [[Night Warden Wars]], for example... We're not the only ones in this fight. What about the heroes who defended Natlan in ages past, or the younger generations who will fight for us in the future. Our combined efforts are what push Natlan forward. If you ask me, that's the real meaning of "Umoja."

Whew, I don't think I could ever list all my favorite activities, not even if I had an extra pair of hands. Sometimes, when I get tired, I just float on the water and relax... I've even fallen asleep a few times. It may be comfortable, but you pay the price when you wake up and realize you've drifted into the middle of nowhere. I always get an earful from the elders when that happens...
