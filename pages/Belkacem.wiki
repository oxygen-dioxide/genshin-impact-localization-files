==Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Belkacem:''' Hello, what can I help you with?
:{{DIcon}} Things are going fine.
::'''Belkacem:''' Ah, that is good. If you do run into any trouble, remember to call the guards.
::'''Belkacem:''' Though that old fellow [[Anpu]] likes to say "come to me if you have any trouble," please, don't bother him with every little thing.
::'''Belkacem:''' I've known him since we were children, then I left the village to seek out more opportunities. I've done business, made a living as a mercenary, done menial labor... I've tried just about everything.
::'''Belkacem:''' When I came back, he'd already become a "do-everything-myself" kind of naggy old man. Unexpected, but still...
::'''Belkacem:''' And that's why I've volunteered to become a guard. Apart from going on patrol, I also help to lighten his load somewhat.
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Belkacem:''' Goodbye. Please be careful — and do watch your step!

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Uncle Anpu:''' My old pal, what do you think? When we're too old to remember anything, will there be any young people willing to take our places?
:'''Belkacem:''' Of course! Don't say things like that.
:'''Belkacem:''' Our village may be small, but we've got quite a lot of decent youngsters here.
:'''Belkacem:''' Never mind the people who came back from working with the [[Eremites]], even [[Kazan|Kazim's boy]] is working hard, you know?
:'''Uncle Anpu:''' Ah, true, true. You're right. I must've been overthinking.
:'''Uncle Anpu:''' I'm sure we'll have more reliable successors like [[Candace]] in our village.
:'''Belkacem:''' Of course! Speaking of Candace, remember when she was a little girl?
:'''Belkacem:''' How she'd go to the wrong house because of her poor eyesight?
:'''Uncle Anpu:''' ... Yes, yes. That did happen, I believe. Hah, between the two of us, I guess you're the one with good memory...
