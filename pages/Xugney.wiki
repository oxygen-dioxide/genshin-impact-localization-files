{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Xugney:''' These... don't look good enough...
:{{DIcon}} Picking a gift?
::'''Xugney:''' That's right! It's been a while since I've returned to Fontaine, so I'm trying to see what's new.
::'''Xugney:''' Upon sailing to other nations, I found that their peoples quite admire our advanced machine industry &mdash; I must confess that I've grown quite proud of it myself.
::'''Xugney:''' But the way I see it, these clockwork devices don't quite live up to the image they have in mind...
::{{DIcon}} How awesome do you need them to be?
:::'''Xugney:''' Like... the [[Gardemek]]s, I guess?
:::'''Xugney:''' Just kidding! Please don't call the [[Garde]]s.
:::'''Xugney:''' Hmm, but I do remember hearing that the [[Fontaine Research Institute]] was working on some new materials...
:::'''Xugney:''' Now, if that place hadn't blown sky-high, would a couple of anti-gravity hourglasses or floating transportation have truly been beyond them?
:::{{DIcon}} Floating aquabuses...
:::'''Xugney:''' Oh, that's a capital idea. But if we had those, would we really need waterways?
:::'''Xugney:''' They're pretty convenient as-is &mdash; and speaking of that, I did have some dealings with [[Callas]], the fellow who helped to build said waterways.
:::'''Xugney:''' It was thanks to him that I was able to make it as a shipborne merchant... Ah, what a shame...
:::'''Xugney:''' I wonder how his daughter, [[Navia]], is doing. I should go say hello if I get the chance...
:{{DIcon}} Sorry for bothering you.
::'''Xugney:''' No worries... Hmm, what should I pick...
