;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whew, Paimon really did sleep like a log. Let's go find Sigewinne.

;(Approach the infirmary)
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Whoa... How is the infirmary even busier than yesterday?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 sigewinne 01.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Good morning, {{Traveler}}, Paimon. I have a few people here for a checkup, so you might need to wait for a while.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No problem, anything we can do to help?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 sigewinne 02.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Umm... There's a bit of a complicated situation here, I'm still getting to the bottom of it myself...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 houilles 01.ogg}} '''"Gascon":''' You have to believe me... I'm telling the truth!
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 wriothesley 01.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' ...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 lambersart 01.ogg}} '''Lambersart:''' You're in a medical facility. Keep it down!
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 houilles 02.ogg}} '''"Gascon":''' Please, listen to me! I'm not [[Gascon]], I'm [[Houilles]]!
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 morgane 01.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' You're a horrible liar, you know that? We get all your mugshots with the arrest warrants. It's clear as day that you're Gascon.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 houilles 03.ogg}} '''"Gascon":''' You mean because of the way I look? I don't know what happened, I just woke up like this, then you guys dragged me in here for an interrogation...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 wriothesley 02.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' I brought you here to figure out what's going on. If you truly are the victim of an injustice, yelling isn't going to achieve anything &mdash; at most, it'll delay your vindication.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 houilles 04.ogg}} '''"Gascon":''' ...Alright, I get it.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 morgane 02.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' This is nuts. Yesterday's interrogations went fine, and now this...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Morning, Your Grace. What's going on?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 wriothesley 03.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Remember the case I mentioned yesterday? The one brought to me by the Marechaussee Phantom? Well, we've been questioning the inmates involved this morning. Every single one of them is claiming mistaken identity.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh... That's even weirder than what that guy was saying yesterday...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 wriothesley 04.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' The thing is, none of them have been able to provide any evidence whatsoever to support their claims. Questioning them further got us nowhere, so for now we've brought them to the infirmary.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' And we thought yesterday was as busy as it got for Sigewinne...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 morgane 03.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' We've compiled their statements. Have a look. Perhaps there's something we missed.
;(Open [[Criminal's Testimony]])
::'''Criminal's Testimony'''
::[[Potton]]:
::Who's this Potton? I'm [[Honore]]! I had applied to go out and see a doctor, but when I woke up, I was in another cell! Unbelievable!
::[[Gascon]]:
::I'm not Gascon, I'm [[Houilles]]! Today should've been the final day of my sentence, I should've gone free, so what gives!?
::[[Enri]]:
::I'm [[Erick]]! Why does stuff like this always happen to me? Now there's no way my release papers are getting squared away today...
::[[Lazare]]:
::My name is [[Odilon]]! I'm a Garde! I think I was attacked... This isn't me at all!
::...
:{{Color|menu|Each of the criminals denies their own identities and all claim they should have been released from prison today. One even claims to be the guard Odilon.}}
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wait...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 sigewinne 03.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Hmm...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 wriothesley 05.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' "Release"? Interesting. The inmates they spoke of in their statements appear to all be due for release today.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 morgane 04.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' I noticed that too... If that's their plan, they're underestimating us a little. Every serious offender claims they're someone else who just so happens to be due for release today... And they're expecting us to go along with that?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 wriothesley 06.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' All the more reason to be cautious. Lambersart, check the release list for today, and make sure no one gets processed. We're gonna need an excuse, though... Just... say we're out of forms. And that we're furiously printing more as we speak.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 lambersart 02.ogg}} '''Lambersart:''' I'm on it!
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 wriothesley 07.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' It's conceivable that our group of serious offenders somehow found a way to switch places with inmates who are about to be released, so they can walk out right under our noses.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 morgane 05.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' We did consider that possibility, but I mean... Just look at them. They match the warrants, period. How could there have been a switch?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 wriothesley 08.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Only if they're dead ringers for the inmates due for release, I suppose... I gave you that name list yesterday to assist in your investigation. Did that help?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 morgane 06.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' Yes, the inmates' mugshots were attached to the list. The first thing I did was check for lookalikes, and I didn't find any.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 morgane 07.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' The only other thing that stands out to me is that their voices sound a little different today. But it's not exactly hard to put on a fake voice.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 wriothesley 09.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Oh, really? Hmm... What does our head nurse make of all this?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 sigewinne 04.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Give me a moment. I think I have a way to confirm whether there's been a switch.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 sigewinne 05.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' I know, it's not time to change your dressing yet, but please bear with me.
:{{Color|menu|Sigewinne walks up to "Potton" and tears the bandages away from his face...}}
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Isn't that the guy from yesterday?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 sigewinne 06.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' This should be Honore. He has very severe facial ulcers, which require an operation in the hospital at the Court of Fontaine. I authorized him to leave the Fortress for medical treatment under guarded escort.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 honore 01.ogg}} '''"Potton":''' Yes, like I told you! I'm not Potton! I'm Honore!
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 morgane 08.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' So there has been a swap... Well, I can see what happened in Potton's case, but how do you explain the other inmates? You're not telling me their... souls switched bodies, are you?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 sigewinne 07.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' No. I believe it was their faces that got switched.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 sigewinne 08.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' The method is a bit like replacing a tooth: Take the bad tooth out, put a false one in. Hmm... And actually, I think I can prove it to you.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 sigewinne 09.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' {{Traveler}}, Paimon, do you remember Erick from the other day?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, sure do!
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 1 sigewinne 10.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Then you can be my witnesses. To start with, please fetch the inmate who claims to be Erick.

:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 sigewinne 01.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' So you're... Erick?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 eric 01.ogg}} '''"Enri":''' Yes, Head Nurse! It's me! ...You do believe me, right?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 sigewinne 02.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' I need to do another examination on you. Same procedure as yesterday.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 eric 02.ogg}} '''"Enri":''' Alright. It's the cognition test first, right? So I need to concentrate.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 sigewinne 03.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Now, try to recall if you can. The last time we did this test, which finger did I hold up?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 eric 03.ogg}} '''"Enri":''' I believe it was... your index finger.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? But that means...
:{{DIcon}} There's two Ericks.
:{{DIcon}} It wasn't the same person.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 wriothesley 01.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Huh?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So basically, last night, the Erick who said he saw another him suddenly recovered and applied to leave the observation ward.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sigewinne did another test before letting him leave, but that time, she held up her pinky finger.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 eric 04.ogg}} '''"Enri":''' Huh? Uhh... I don't know about any test last night... There was nothing to do in the observation ward, so I went straight to bed. Then I somehow woke up in a high-security cell.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 wriothesley 02.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Hmm. Well, in that case, there is a reasonable explanation for the strange events of the past two days.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 morgane 01.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' So... What exactly happened?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 wriothesley 03.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' The gang of serious offenders wanted to break out of prison, so they identified a group of scapegoats &mdash; namely, inmates whose terms were almost up &mdash; and planned to switch appearances with them.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 wriothesley 04.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Last night, when Odilon was on duty, they ambushed him and had one of their group switch appearances with him using their face-swapping method. That allowed them to avoid scrutiny from the other guards.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 wriothesley 05.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Then, once all the other inmates were asleep, "Odilon" spent his night shift carrying out the remainder of their switcheroo plan.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 wriothesley 06.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' However, they made one mistake. Enri changed his appearance to match Erick's earlier than he should have done, and ended up being spotted by the real Erick.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 wriothesley 07.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Real Erick came to the guards for help, but we didn't know then what we know now. So we put it down to hallucination, and sent him to the observation ward.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 wriothesley 08.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' However, since one of the gang members was posing as a guard, they simply changed real Erick's appearance and had their "Erick" take his place, muddying the waters even further.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 sigewinne 04.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Right... Because I'd put Erick on the observation list by then, and no inmates on that list can be processed for departure until I've discharged them.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 wriothesley 09.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Hence why the imposters had to pull that little stunt, to get fake Erick off the list.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah... It all makes sense now! The Duke cracked the case!
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 morgane 02.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' Well, I can't fault the reasoning. But I'm afraid that we ruled out the possibility of face-switching very early on in this process.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 ceasth 01.ogg}} '''Ceasth:''' Criminals altering their facial appearance to commit crimes is nothing new. In fact, one of the explicit duties of the Melusines in the Marechaussee Phantom is to identify criminals in disguise.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 ceasth 02.ogg}} '''Ceasth:''' We carefully examined all the suspects, and there is no evidence that any means of disguise were used in this case.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh? Well then how do we explain all this?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 morgane 03.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' So far, it seems more likely that the gang stole documentation belonging to the inmates due for release, and are using that to commit identity fraud.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 sigewinne 05.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Hmm... Actually, there is a potion that can completely change someone's appearance. If they used that... even a Melusine wouldn't be able to detect it.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' A shape-shifting potion, huh...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 morgane 04.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' Forgive me, Head Nurse, but this is the first time I'm hearing about it... If such a potion truly existed, it would jeopardize our entire investigative process at the Marechaussee Phantom. Are you certain of this?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 sigewinne 06.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Yes. I am.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 morgane 05.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' But...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 sigewinne 07.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Please, trust me and my professional opinion as an experienced clinician.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 wriothesley 10.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' At the same time, without any solid evidence, it's pure speculation. Hmm... If we can round up all the inmates suspected of switching places, then have a little talk with both sides, we might just get our answer...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 wriothesley 11.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Yep, let's do that.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 morgane 06.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' Okay... Well, it was our negligence that meant we had to come and conduct these post-internment interrogations, and I know it's put you out... We'll do it your way.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 lambersart 01.ogg}} '''Lambersart:''' Your Grace! Bad news &mdash; I paused the releases like you asked, but we were too late... a bunch of people already got processed two hours ago.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 lambersart 02.ogg}} '''Lambersart:''' I checked the list, and sure enough... it's all the people who gave statements.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 wriothesley 12.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Two hours ago? That's before today's interrogations began... They had this all planned out.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 morgane 07.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' So there really was a switch after all? Ugh... They really pulled the wool over our eyes on this one.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We should be able to catch up with them if we leave now, right?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 morgane 08.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' Not if that potion is real. They can just switch faces again after leaving the Fortress. And if the Marechaussee's Melusines can't even spot them, we wouldn't know where to start searching.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yikes... so we're at a complete dead end!
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 ceasth 03.ogg}} '''Ceasth:''' Well... Technically, there is one more lead we could follow up on.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 ceasth 04.ogg}} '''Ceasth:''' We were only able to arrest this gang thanks to the help of a researcher from the Fontaine Research Institute. I believe his name is [[Rawat]].
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 sigewinne 08.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Oh?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Rawat? Isn't that the handsome guy we met at that skincare promotion?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 ceasth 05.ogg}} '''Ceasth:''' Handsome? Maybe from a human point of view. I just remember that he specialized in potions.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 ceasth 06.ogg}} '''Ceasth:''' One of the crimes this gang is charged with is the manufacture and sale of illicit drugs. According Mr. Rawat, they appear to have stolen technology he developed through his research, and used it in their operation.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 ceasth 07.ogg}} '''Ceasth:''' At first, he thought it was a typical case of intellectual property infringement, and he tried to negotiate with them. But once he discovered their criminal operation, he reported them to the authorities.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 ceasth 08.ogg}} '''Ceasth:''' Thanks to his report, we were able to swoop in and arrest them all in one go.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' What a hero. Bet that took courage on his part.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 wriothesley 13.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' No doubt. This is worth following up on. As the one who snitched on them, it's highly likely that Rawat will be targeted by the escapees.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 wriothesley 14.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' That aside, since he's negotiated with them in person before, there's a chance he'll have some additional information for us.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 morgane 09.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' Understood, Your Grace. My team and I will head to the Fontaine Research Institute right away. In the meantime, please keep an eye on the face-switch victims for us.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 wriothesley 15.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Of course.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 sigewinne 09.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Um, Miss Morgane? I'd like to come along and help you catch these criminals.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 morgane 10.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' Why's that?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 sigewinne 10.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Well, I'm the one who discharged the fake Erick last night, so I feel partly responsible.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 morgane 11.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' Don't say that, Head Nurse. Your focus was on the inmates' health, and rightly so. We can't ask you to help with arresting criminals &mdash; that's our duty.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 sigewinne 11.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Umm... I also have a more personal reason. Potton is a patient of mine, and if I don't get a new batch of medicine to him in time, his condition will get much worse.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 morgane 12.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' Look... Head Nurse, I completely understand where you're coming from. But arresting criminals is dangerous business, and if anything happened to you... None of us can afford to take on that responsibility.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 sigewinne 12.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Don't worry, I can defend myself just fine.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 morgane 13.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' You say that, but still&mdash;
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 wriothesley 16.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' If I may, Ms. Morgane &mdash; Sigewinne is the one who raised the potion hypothesis, and I'm sure she has far more expertise on the topic than your team. My suggestion would be to bring her with you.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 wriothesley 17.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' And if you really are worried for her safety, then...
:{{DIcon}} Paimon and I are coming along anyway.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 wriothesley 18.ogg}} '''Wriothesley:''' Ah, there you go, right on cue. Knew I could count on you.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 2 morgane 14.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' Okay... Well, since this plan has the Duke's blessing, far be it from me to refuse... We should head off immediately. Time is of the essence.

{{Quest Description|update|After some discussion, going to the Fontaine Research Institute to look for Rawat has become the key to getting to the bottom of the mystery.}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the marked location in the Fontaine Research Institute)
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 3 morgane 01.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' Greetings. Sorry to impose, but I'm afraid we're here on urgent business, and we're gonna need you to cooperate.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 3 bognor 01.ogg}} '''Bognor:''' The Marechaussee Phantom? Let me guess, you're investigating some more illegal research?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 3 morgane 02.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' Not this time, no. We're looking for a researcher, do you know where we might find Mr. Rawat?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 3 bognor 02.ogg}} '''Bognor:''' Rawat... Oh, yeah &mdash; Mr. Handsome, right?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 3 bognor 03.ogg}} '''Bognor:''' He actually doesn't work on site here very often. There's a handful researchers in the nearby area who know him pretty well, though. You could see what they know.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just a handful? Paimon figured he'd be the most popular guy around.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 3 bognor 04.ogg}} '''Bognor:''' Well, I guess you could say he's popular, at least on a superficial level. He's blessed with good looks, so he tends to make a good first impression on people.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 3 bognor 05.ogg}} '''Bognor:''' But in all his time here at the Fontaine Research Institute, I don't think he's ever had a single deep conversation about his research with his peers. That's no way to make real friends around here.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 3 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That's so weird... He definitely didn't come across like a recluse at that product promotion.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 3 sigewinne 01.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' I don't find that weird at all. He definitely didn't strike me as the kind of guy who's good at making friends.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 3 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Really? Paimon couldn't tell... must be a Melusine perception thing.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 3 morgane 03.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' Okay &mdash; we should talk with his acquaintances, but we also need to check the research institute for any clues. Let's split up, it'll save us some time.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 3 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sure thing. We'll go ask around among the other researchers with Sigewinne. Paimon's suddenly kinda curious to know what everyone really thinks of him.

;(Talk to Audree)
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Excuse us, are you Audree?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 audree 01.ogg}} '''Audree:''' That's me. What is it?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Are you close friends with Rawat? We're trying to find out where he is.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 audree 02.ogg}} '''Audree:''' Close friends? Pff. You mean, because I told him I had feelings for him once? I doubt I'm the first or last at the institute to make that mistake... Why would you single me out as a "close friend"?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 audree 03.ogg}} '''Audree:''' I should've known, really. Men like him, they just enjoy being surrounded by fawning women... They're not interested in a serious relationship.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oookay... Um, we were just kinda wondering if you might know where we can find him...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 audree 04.ogg}} '''Audree:''' Why would I know where he's at? I barely know him, and he probably doesn't even remember me.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ugh, this is getting annoying. Shall we go ask someone else?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 sigewinne 01.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Hmm, I think she knows Rawat better than she cares to admit. If we leave now, it might be a wasted opportunity.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Maybe, but we're not going to get much out of her while she's in this state, are we?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 sigewinne 02.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' She's displaying symptoms common among people in love, if that's what you mean. But I know a cure.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...It's curable?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 sigewinne 03.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' *clears throat* We're still no closer to finding Mr. Rawat... By this point, he could be in grave danger.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 audree 05.ogg}} '''Audree:''' Danger? Wait, why are you looking for him, again?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ohh... That's right, yeah! The Marechaussee Phantom said that he's been targeted by some pretty bad people. We need to make sure he's safe.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 audree 06.ogg}} '''Audree:''' What? How has this happened!? He seemed fine when I last saw him, and that was only a couple of days ago... Just happened to run into him, of course.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 sigewinne 04.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' I see, I see. Well, do you have any thoughts on where he might be right now?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 audree 07.ogg}} '''Audree:''' ...Okay, but this is purely out of concern for his safety... If he's not at the Institute, he might be at his mother's place.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 audree 08.ogg}} '''Audree:''' I heard she raised him alone, that they had it pretty tough financially, and these days she's housebound due to illness. He makes regular trips back home to check on her.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Ooh, okay. Do you know the address?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 audree 09.ogg}} '''Audree:''' Nope, sorry. I only found out the thing about his mother because it came up in conversation once. I was just trying to find out more about him. Y'know, so I could get to know him better.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 audree 10.ogg}} '''Audree:''' When I told him I had a crush on him, I offered to help him take care of his mother. And yeah, maybe that was a stupid idea, but did he really have to yell at me for it? It's like, fine, I can take no for an answer, but what's with the temper tantrum?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 audree 11.ogg}} '''Audree:''' Unbelievable. Ugh, these guys only wanna show you their charming, well-groomed exterior. They can't stand it when a few home truths shine through...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like her love syndrome is flaring up again...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 sigewinne 05.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' We need to find out Mr. Rawat's mother's address... Let's check with the Marechaussee officers when we regroup.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 5 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Cool, sounds like a plan.

;(Talk to Audree again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog sgwlq002 audree 01.ogg}} '''Audree:''' Well? I've told you everything I know, don't you think it's time for you to go looking for him? ...Not that I care, obviously...

;(Talk to Antibes)
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hey there! Are you Antibes?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 4 antibes 01.ogg}} '''Antibes:''' What do you want?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 4 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' We're here to ask about Rawat. Any idea where he might be? We're told you're pretty close with him.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 4 antibes 02.ogg}} '''Antibes:''' "Close"? Hmph, not sure that's the word I'd use. He wouldn't even let me use his patent.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 4 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' ...Huh?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 4 antibes 03.ogg}} '''Antibes:''' It's been a good few days since I last saw him. I don't know where he's at. Go ask someone else.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 4 sigewinne 01.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Umm... Would the patent in question happen to be related to the new skincare product he developed?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 4 antibes 04.ogg}} '''Antibes:''' Tsk... Yeah, kinda. "Butterfly Dew," or whatever he calls it. Hmph, I heard he made a tidy sum off of that one...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 4 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Okay, now we're getting somewhere! Keep going...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 4 antibes 05.ogg}} '''Antibes:''' Most of the other researchers here focus on mechanics, energy, stuff like that. I get why he wouldn't be interested in having anything to do with them.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 4 antibes 06.ogg}} '''Antibes:''' But I'm studying coatings. There's a huge overlap in our areas of research! Why would he refuse to work with me?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 4 antibes 07.ogg}} '''Antibes:''' I bought his product once and noticed it contains a unique substance that might have applications in coatings too. If it worked out, I could probably make as much as he's making.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 4 antibes 08.ogg}} '''Antibes:''' Don't get me wrong, I had no intention of plagiarizing his work. I was hoping to get official permission to use his findings in my own research. Followed the proper procedure, it was all above-board &mdash; I would've had to pay him a license fee and everything.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 4 antibes 09.ogg}} '''Antibes:''' But despite that, he turned me down not once, not twice, but three times! It's like he's vehemently opposed to the idea of anyone else making the kind of money he does!
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 4 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Huh, so is Rawat antisocial, or is this guy just jealous?
:{{DIcon}} Maybe both of the above...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 4 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, doesn't look like we're gonna get any info about Rawat's whereabouts from him. Let's go.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 4 sigewinne 02.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Wait, one second... Mr. Antibes? Next time you go shopping, you should buy some Bulle Fruits. Peel the skin, steep in water, then drink &mdash; it'll help calm your mood.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 4 antibes 10.ogg}} '''Antibes:''' Huh? Uhh, yeah, thanks...

;(Talk to Antibes again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog sgwlq002 antibes 01.ogg}} '''Antibes:''' Gonna have to cut this chat short. I have a patent application to write.

;(Talk to Bertram)
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sorry to bother you, Sir, but are you Bertram?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 bertram 01.ogg}} '''Bertram:''' Who's asking?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just some concerned citizens helping out the Marechaussee Phantom with an investigation. We'd like to ask you about Rawat's whereabouts, if that's okay. We're told the two of you are pretty close?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 bertram 02.ogg}} '''Bertram:''' Not anymore, we're not. Turns out we don't see eye to eye.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh yeah? What happened?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 bertram 03.ogg}} '''Bertram:''' *sigh* ...The thing about us researchers is, most of us do what we do for some sort of higher purpose. But not Rawat. All he cared about was how to commercialize his findings.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 bertram 04.ogg}} '''Bertram:''' He won't even let you work with him unless you sign a confidentiality agreement first. All so he has better control over who gets which intellectual property rights. How are you supposed to get any meaningful research done working with a guy like that?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 bertram 05.ogg}} '''Bertram:''' Now that I've got my own technical solution for my compressor, I don't need to work with him anymore.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' So that's what Rawat is really like...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 sigewinne 01.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' We'd still like to know where to find him. Is that something you can help us with?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 bertram 06.ogg}} '''Bertram:''' Wait, you're... Yeah, I know you, you're the head nurse at the Fortress of Meropide. Alright, then I'm happy to help you if I can. I respect the work you do &mdash; medicine serves the highest purpose of all the sciences.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Wow, turns out Sigewinne's got some real clout.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 bertram 07.ogg}} '''Bertram:''' Thing is, I have no real way of knowing where he might be. I stopped working with him two months ago, and I've barely seen him since.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 bertram 08.ogg}} '''Bertram:''' But if you want my advice, I'd say go talk to the peddlers. There's a few he meets with every other day or so, maybe they know where he's at.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 sigewinne 02.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Peddlers?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 bertram 09.ogg}} '''Bertram:''' Yeah. Back when I was working with him, I noticed he met with them quite often. Wouldn't surprise me if they were involved in some shady business together, because it seemed like they went out of their way to avoid discussing anything in my presence.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 bertram 10.ogg}} '''Bertram:''' The little I overheard was about manufacturing and selling pharmaceutical drugs. Like I said, he's all about the money.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Drugs? Doesn't he work with skincare products? Do those count as drugs?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 bertram 11.ogg}} '''Bertram:''' Who knows? I never cared to find out. He's the Mora-grubber, not me.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 sigewinne 03.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Thank you. You've given us plenty to work with.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 bertram 12.ogg}} '''Bertram:''' Welcome. Goodbye, and may we both reach new heights in our scientific endeavors.

;(Talk to Bertram again, optional)
:{{A|vo dialog sgwlq002 bertram 01.ogg}} '''Bertram:''' If my research project works out, the development of underwater spaces should become much easier...
----
;(After talking to all 3 researchers)
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 6 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, that's all three researchers. Let's head back to the meetup point.

;(Approach the marked location)
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Y'know, Paimon started out thinking Rawat was a handsome researcher with a friendly and cheerful personality. It's such a surprise to learn that his peers have a different impression of him.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 sigewinne 01.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' So what's your view of him now, Paimon?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm... A handsome researcher whose difficult upbringing turned him into a profit-chaser with a chip on his shoulder...?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 sigewinne 02.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' So your thoughts about his appearance haven't changed at all.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well... His looks are kind of a big deal, at least in Paimon's opinion. How does such a handsome guy end up being so antisocial? Even with his difficult family background, it just doesn't make any sense.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 sigewinne 03.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' You can't judge a person solely based on their appearance.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 morgane 01.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' Head Nurse, {{Traveler}}, I assume you've spoken with the researchers? What did you find out?
:{{Black Screen|You exchange the intelligence you've gathered.}}
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 sigewinne 04.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Bertram mentioned Rawat's involvement with some pharmaceutical merchants. Do you know if he's registered any pharmaceutical brands?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 ceasth 01.ogg}} '''Ceasth:''' Since he was the whistleblower on such a huge case, I ran a background check on him. Hmm... I don't remember there being any brands under his name.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 sigewinne 05.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' How strange... If he was so focused on commercializing his research and averse to sharing his technology with others, why wouldn't he have registered his own brands?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 sigewinne 06.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Maybe he and his "business partners" needed to avoid public scrutiny?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 ceasth 02.ogg}} '''Ceasth:''' You think he may have colluded with the gang? Hmm... Well, the crime was manufacture and sale of drugs, and that would certainly be in his wheelhouse. We can't rule it out.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Isn't that pretty unlikely though? He was the one he blew the whistle on them.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 sigewinne 07.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Most children who come to me with tooth decay have suffered pain for a long time already, but they'll still try to hide the fact that they eat too many sweets. Grown-ups and children aren't so different in that regard.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Hmm, if you say so...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 morgane 02.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' I saw him when he came to make his report, and I certainly didn't get the feeling that he was the type to collude with criminals. Perhaps it's more likely that they were coercing him?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 morgane 03.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' You mentioned that he comes from a poor family. So it's possible that the criminals approached him asking for academic support, luring him in with the promise of riches.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 morgane 04.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' By the time he discovered who they really were, he was in too deep, they had leverage on him, so he was forced to keep working for them... I've seen it happen many times before.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' That does make a lot of sense. It would definitely explain why he was so unwilling to cooperate with his fellow researchers.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No wonder he's so unsociable. He must be on edge all the time with a gang of crooks breathing down his neck.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 sigewinne 08.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' In that case, the situation could be worse than we thought.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 sigewinne 09.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' If Rawat was working with the escaped inmates, they're sure to know more about his whereabouts than us. There's a good chance they'll get to him before we do.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 ceasth 03.ogg}} '''Ceasth:''' Based on the information we've gathered so far, he was last seen two days ago. If no one's seen him since, maybe we're... too late...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Two days ago? So he went missing right after that product promotion?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 morgane 05.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' That was the same day he reported the criminals, too. Not a good sign.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 sigewinne 10.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Hmmm... Don't worry, everyone. I believe we still have a chance. Since he disappeared right after blowing the whistle, it's likely that he's gone into hiding.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah. He must've been worried that they'd come for him.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 morgane 06.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' All the more reason to find him as soon as possible. The only lead we have at the moment is his mother's house, which you mentioned earlier. Ceasth, think you can find the place?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 ceasth 04.ogg}} '''Ceasth:''' Yep. *chuckle* When you register a brand, the Court of Fontaine requires you to provide a legal address. The one Rawat wrote down was in the outskirts of the city. That should be the place.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 7 sigewinne 11.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Okay, then there's no time to lose. Let's move!
{{Dialogue End}}
{{Quest Description|update|Rawat has been missing for some time, and his mother's home seems to be the only place he could have stayed...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the house)
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 8 ceasth 01.ogg}} '''Ceasth:''' Alright, should be this house. I'm pretty sure this was the address.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 8 morgane 01.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' Okay, I'll knock.
:{{Black Screen|Morgane knocks several times. No one answers, but you hear the faint sound of breathing from inside.}}
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 8 sigewinne 01.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Sounds like whoever's inside has restricted mobility... It seems serious &mdash; what's the fastest way to get this door open?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 8 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Umm... break the door down?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 8 ceasth 02.ogg}} '''Ceasth:''' No, no, I'll handle it. Let the expert deal with it &mdash; there'll be a mountain of paperwork if we damage a citizen's property.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 8 ceasth 03.ogg}} '''Ceasth:''' Calm down, deep breaths, remember your training, control your strength, aaand... it's open!
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 8 morgane 02.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' Ceasth, take a few people and lie in wait. Keep your eyes peeled for any activity around the house. {{Traveler}}, Head Nurse, and I will go inside.

;(Talk to Ceasth, optional)
:{{A|Vo dialog sgwlq002 ceasth 02.ogg}} '''Ceasth:''' No, don't look this way. I'm supposed to be hiding, remember? Captain's orders.

:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' There! On the bed, there's an old lady. That's gotta be Rawat's mother, right? She doesn't look like she's in any state to be answering our questions, though...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 sigewinne 01.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' We could try, but she is very ill. We mustn't force it.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 morgane 01.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' Well, doesn't look like Rawat's here. She's the only one we can talk to.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 sigewinne 02.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Yep... Allow me.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 sigewinne 03.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Hello Ma'am, might I ask if you're Rawat's mother? We're trying to locate him.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 sickoldlady 01.ogg}} '''Sick Old Lady:''' Huhhh...? Who...?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 sigewinne 04.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Hard of hearing, perhaps... Does anyone have a picture of Rawat?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 morgane 02.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' I have one here.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 sigewinne 05.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' I'd like to show you a photo, Ma'am. Is this your son? Do you know where he is?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 sickoldlady 02.ogg}} '''Sick Old Lady:''' *cough*
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Looks like this isn't gonna work after all.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 morgane 03.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' *sigh* ...Well, looks like we're out of leads. If Rawat's not here... Things are looking very bad for him.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Is it possible he could have avoided returning here because he knew he'd be in danger?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 morgane 04.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' Maybe, but if so, where do we look next? Maybe we should take another look at the institute?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 paimon 05.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Guess so...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 morgane 05.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' I suggest we all return there now. We found a good amount of useful information the first time, but perhaps there's something we missed. This is our last hope.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 sigewinne 06.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Sorry, Officer, but could I stay here for a while? This patient requires some care.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 morgane 06.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' Of course. {{Traveler}}, stay with the head nurse. You're technically here as her assistant, after all.
:{{DIcon}} You got it!
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 sigewinne 07.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Also, I'd like some Marechaussee members to stay as well and keep an eye on the area.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 morgane 07.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' Why's that?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 sigewinne 08.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' If Rawat knows how serious his mother's condition is, he will return.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 morgane 08.ogg}} '''Morgane:''' Got it... Okay, I'll tell the squad members in hiding to stay put and keep a lookout.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 sigewinne 09.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Thanks for helping me out yet again, {{Traveler}} and Paimon.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 paimon 06.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' No problem! But, when you say her condition is serious...Do you mean...?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 sigewinne 10.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Yes. She is barely clinging on to life.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 paimon 07.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Aw...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 sigewinne 11.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Let me take care of a few things first. Could you pass me the towel over there?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 paimon 08.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah, of course!
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 sigewinne 12.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' I can tell that her family has tried a lot of different treatment methods, including some very expensive medicines. Unfortunately, her condition is so multifaceted that a recovery looks all but impossible.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 paimon 09.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sigewinne... Paimon bets being a nurse must be pretty tough at times like this?
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 sigewinne 13.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Yes... It makes me a little sad.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 sigewinne 14.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' In a Melusine's eyes, a human's birth, aging, sickness, and death are as much part of natural law as sunrise and sunset.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 sigewinne 15.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' But human medicine can defy that law to some extent. In that sense, it is a science of miracles &mdash; that is why I became fascinated with it in the first place.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 sigewinne 16.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' But it was only after I truly became a doctor that I realized, miracles don't always happen. Even the greatest doctors cannot cure all diseases.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 paimon 10.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Sigewinne...
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 sigewinne 17.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Don't worry about me, Paimon. A doctor's duty is not to cure all diseases, but to treat whatever ailments they can.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 sigewinne 18.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' At the very least, I can lower her fever. That way, she'll suffer less, and she might even be able to see her son.
:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 paimon 11.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Yeah... All the more reason to find Rawat as soon as possible, even if we don't catch those crooks!

:{{A|vo sgwlq002 9 sigewinne 19.ogg}} '''Sigewinne:''' Her fever's getting worse. Could I get some hot water?
