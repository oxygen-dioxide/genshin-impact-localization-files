As such, all us cats tend to avoid those purplish, square-shaped fellows!"<br>{{Color|bp|Special Rule: "Electro Hypostasis" is immune to Frozen, Stun, Petrification and begins with "Elemental Lifeform: Electro" attached to it. It will heal until it reaches 6 HP upon triggering "Electro Crystal Core." At the start of the Action Phase: If the Electro Hypostasis does not have "Electro Crystal Core" attached, it can reapply "Electro Crystal Core." (This effect can be triggered twice at most.)}}
