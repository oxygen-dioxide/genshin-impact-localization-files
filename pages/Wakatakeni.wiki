|description     = A light-colored vegetarian dish.
|desc_suspicious = The seaweed takes forever to swallow and the overly-hard bamboo shoots look like they might wear out the teeth. Probably best left looked at but not eaten.
|desc_basic      = Broth is first poured into the pot before the bamboo shoots, and then the seaweed, are added in. The result is an elegant product with a light mouthfeel that agrees well with all palates. Suitable as a pre-meal appetizer or as a side to a main dish.
|desc_delicious  = The new life born in the embrace of the ocean and the crisp freshness that sprouted in the mountains have blended into this broth. The light and gentle flavors give one a foretaste of the wonder of the four seasons, and of the revivification of all life.
