|description    = A strange shrub growing within the [[Forest of Blessings]]. Nobody can help but think of tightly packed layers of cabbage leaves upon seeing its heavy spherical crown.<br>Due to its pleasing appearance, low price, and ease of preparation, many chefs use cabbage as a garnish as well as an ingredient, adding a vivid green touch to the finished dish. Perhaps this was the inspiration for the [[Goddess of Creation]] using these Crownospheres to bless the Forest with greenery.
