==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Tomoki:''' Don't miss out on Inazuma's creative cuisine!

;(Unlocked after completing [[Reflections of Mortality]])
:{{DIcon|Shop}} One [[Dango Milk]], please!
::'''Tomoki:''' One Dango Milk, coming right up!
:;(Opens the Shop menu)
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Tomoki/Food Fight|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Tomoki:''' Playing cards is like cooking. If you're creative enough, you'll win for sure!
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Tomoki:''' Eh... Failure is but a part of innovation...
:{{DIcon}} How's the Dango Milk doing?
::'''Tomoki:''' Thanks to our [[Ei|Almighty Shogun]], the number of people who came to buy some Dango Milk went up significantly. They all think it's pretty good, too.
::'''Tomoki:''' I've given it a little thought, and given the kind of business we've been doing recently, there'd be no problem switching to just selling Dango Milk. Still, I love experimenting more...
::'''Tomoki:''' I originally wanted to replace Dango Milk with some new creative dish, but my customers all missed its flavor. So after discussing it with them, I decided to return Dango Milk to the menu every so often.
::'''Tomoki:''' As it turns out, it sold even better that way! Sometimes I couldn't even keep up with the demand, haha!

;(Unlocked by default)
:{{DIcon}} Creative cuisine?
::'''Tomoki:''' Heh heh, that's right! You see, this street is filled with old, famous shops that serve people the same old stuff all the time!
::'''Tomoki:''' So I thought that something creative and new might attract a real crowd!
::'''Tomoki:''' Aside from ordinary takoyaki and sushi, I've also added creative cuisines into the menu.
::'''Tomoki:''' These are my pride and joy: Milky Natto Ramen, Colorful Spicy Dango... What do you think? Sounds delicious, no?
::{{DIcon}} How's business doing?
::'''Tomoki:''' Erm... I am new to cooking, after all. It'd be best if I took things one step at a time...
::'''Tomoki:''' Though my dishes may sound a little strange, everyone who's tried it has said that they taste pretty good.
::'''Tomoki:''' [[Kamisato Ayato|Sir Kamisato]] of the [[Yashiro Commission]] visited my shop last time and took a liking to our milk tea!
::'''Tomoki:''' However, perhaps the mix of foods is a little too strange, because we rarely get any returning guests. I suppose people are still too used to ordinary cuisine...
::'''Tomoki:''' Seems like I need to put more work into how I promote all this creativity...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Tomoki:''' If you ever get bored of ordinary food, be sure to come check out the new stuff here! See ya!

==Event Dialogue==
===Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:{{DIcon|Music Score}} {{Color|help|We'd like to invite you to attend this music festival.}}
::'''Tomoki:''' Hmm? How did you know I liked music? ... Well, to be truthful, that's where I get most of my creative ideas!
::'''Paimon:''' Ooh, then you must have music you really enjoy, right? We could play it for you!
::'''Tomoki:''' Oh, that's a long list you'd be looking at... If I had to pick one, it might be this traditional piece from Konda Village.
::'''Tomoki:''' That's where I started my culinary journey, in fact.
::'''Tomoki:''' Could you play the piece if I were to hum the tune for you?
::{{DIcon}} Sure, I'll give it a go.
::'''Tomoki:''' Thanks!

;(After performing)
:'''Tomoki:''' Absolutely fantastic!
:'''Tomoki:''' If not for the way you dress, I'd have suspected that you were from Konda Village yourself. It sounded just like the original!
:'''Tomoki:''' Alright, I've decided. I'm heading to this festival. Maybe immersing myself in the music there might give me some new ideas.
:'''Tomoki:''' I'll move my food stall over there &mdash; not that my skills are the most impressive, but I'm sure I'll add to the atmosphere at least, eh?

;(Talk to Tomoki again, optional)
:{{DIcon|Music Score}} How was that?
:;(Same as ''After performing'')

----

;(After he moves to the event location at Watatsumi Island)
:'''Tomoki:''' {{Traveler}}! This "Iridescent Arataki Rockin' for Life Tour de Force of Awesomeness" you recommended really is awesome. I've been inspired!
:'''Tomoki:''' Now have a taste of the food I made specifically for the event!
:{{DIcon|Reward}} What kind of creative cuisine is that?
::'''Tomoki:''' Dango Milk that's been marinated in rock, and macerated in roll &mdash; Rock 'n' Roll Dango Milk! Here, have one on me.
::{{DIcon}} It's just regular Dango Milk, right?
::'''Tomoki:''' I wouldn't go that far! At least, it might have been to begin with, but not after hearing all that rock 'n' roll that I made it listen to.
::'''Tomoki:''' That's also why it now tastes like regular Dango Milk that's been lying around for a while.
::'''Tomoki:''' But this way, some customers are even willing to pay double the price of regular Dango Milk just to get their hands on this stuff.
::'''Tomoki:''' Must be the power of rock 'n' roll, eh? It's so mind-blowing that I can't even put it into words.
:;(Obtain {{Item|Rock 'n' Roll Dango Milk|x=1}})
:{{DIcon|Shop}} One Dango Milk, please!
::'''Tomoki:''' One Dango Milk, coming right up!
:;(Opens the Shop menu)
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Open Genius Invokation TCG match interface)
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Tomoki:''' Have fun!
