His shop becomes available once the player completes Act I of [[Raiden Shogun]]'s [[Story Quest]], [[Reflections of Mortality]].

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Tomoki:''' Don't miss out on Inazuma's creative cuisine!

;(Unlocked after completing [[Reflections of Mortality]])
:{{DIcon|Shop}} One [[Dango Milk]], please!
::'''Tomoki:''' One Dango Milk, coming right up!
:;(Opens the Shop menu)
:{{DIcon|TCG}} Adventure Challenge
:;(Opens [[Genius Invokation TCG/Stage/Tomoki/Food Fight|Genius Invokation TCG match interface]])
:;(If the player loses the match)
:::'''Tomoki:''' Playing cards is like cooking. If you're creative enough, you'll win for sure!
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Tomoki:''' Eh... Failure is but a part of innovation...
:{{DIcon}} How's the Dango Milk doing?
::'''Tomoki:''' Thanks to our Almighty Shogun, the number of people who came to buy some Dango Milk went up significantly. They all think it's pretty good, too.
::'''Tomoki:''' I've given it a little thought, and given the kind of business we've been doing recently, there'd be no problem switching to just selling Dango Milk. Still, I love experimenting more...
::'''Tomoki:''' I originally wanted to replace Dango Milk with some new creative dish, but my customers all missed its flavor. So after discussing it with them, I decided to return Dango Milk to the menu every so often.
::'''Tomoki:''' As it turns out, it sold even better that way! Sometimes I couldn't even keep up with the demand, haha!

;(Unlocked by default)
:{{DIcon}} Creative cuisine?
::'''Tomoki:''' Heh heh, that's right! You see, this street is filled with old, famous shops that serve people the same old stuff all the time!
::'''Tomoki:''' So I thought that something creative and new might attract a real crowd!
::'''Tomoki:''' Aside from ordinary takoyaki and sushi, I've also added creative cuisines into the menu.
::'''Tomoki:''' These are my pride and joy: Milky Natto Ramen, Colorful Spicy Dango... What do you think? Sounds delicious, no?
::{{DIcon}} How's business doing?
::'''Tomoki:''' Erm... I am new to cooking, after all. It'd be best if I took things one step at a time...
::'''Tomoki:''' Though my dishes may sound a little strange, everyone who's tried it has said that they taste pretty good.
::'''Tomoki:''' [[Kamisato Ayato|Sir Kamisato]] of the Yashiro Commission visited my shop last time and took a liking to our milk tea!
::'''Tomoki:''' However, perhaps the mix of foods is a little too strange, because we rarely get any returning guests. I suppose people are still too used to ordinary cuisine...
::'''Tomoki:''' Seems like I need to put more work into how I promote all this creativity...
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Tomoki:''' If you ever get bored of ordinary food, be sure to come check out the new stuff here! See ya!
