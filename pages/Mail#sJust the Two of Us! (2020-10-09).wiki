|text    = Today is my birthday. My father and brother insisted on having a party at our home, despite my protests.

Another occasion to oblige guests with glasses filled with wine and tea, another occasion for me to put on a performance â€” how boring.

Fortunately, I was able to slip out the window when no one was paying attention. Hehe...

I brought you some pastries, made by yours truly. Don't tell anyone~

Let's find a quiet place to enjoy the scenery and chat.... chat about anything! How does that sound?
