[[Version 2.6]]
* Updates to character voice-overs:
** Updated text for English:
*** "About Yoimiya"
**** '''{{Color|Old}}:''' The Yashiro Commission and the shrine maidens are responsible for festival affairs, and Yoimiya, as a fireworks expert, knows how to create an atmosphere. So we have become well acquainted with her over the years. Hmm? Public order and fire prevention? We factor these concerns in well in advance during the planning stage. To deny people the chance to see fireworks simply for these reasons would leave them feeling very disappointed.

*** "Birthday"
**** '''{{Color|Old}}:''' Come with me! We're not going far away &mdash; I promise it won't delay you too much. I managed to find out when your birthday was well in advance, so I could prepare in good time. Hopefully this wasn't assuming too much, but I guessed you might prefer this to an expensive gift. In honor of your birthday, please allow me to perform a fan dance for you.

*** "Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion"
**** '''{{Color|Old}}:''' "Though I cling to that which has given me the strength to hold on, the weight of letting go is ever-foreboding." My apologies, it should be a happy occasion, and yet it is such a sad phrase that comes to mind. Our time together has been so pleasant that I am fearful of losing what I have gained. I'm sorry, I must compose myself.
