:'''Tunner:''' Hello. Do you have any message from my son?
:{{DIcon}} Who are you?
::'''Tunner:''' Me? Pals in the winery call me Old Tunner. I'm a farmer here at the Dawn Winery.
::'''Tunner:''' My family has been farming here for generations. Most of the good wines you've had were probably fermented using the grapes here.
::'''Tunner:''' Every owner of the winery has been treating our family very generously.
::'''Tunner:''' But I don't think it's a good thing for my son to inherit this land and become a farmer for his whole life...
:{{DIcon}} Your son?
::'''Tunner:''' Guy! His name is Guy, my beloved son!
::'''Tunner:''' What? You've never heard of him? Hahaha, that's fine. Sooner or later, you'll know him. The whole Mondstadt will know him...
::'''Tunner:''' My son, Guy, told me he was going to be the strongest Knight of Favonius! I believe in him.
::'''Tunner:''' I spent all my hard-earned money for his sake, to give him a better future than mine.
::'''Tunner:''' Guy is determined to fulfill his dream! He became a squire at 16, so our household has been relying on him since.
:{{DIcon}} Goodbye.
::'''Tunner:''' Goodbye! If you meet my son, please tell him to come home once in a while!
