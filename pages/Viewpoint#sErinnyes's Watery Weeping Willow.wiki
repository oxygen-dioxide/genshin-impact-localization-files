|text    = In ancient times, the weeping willow of the lake was an object of reverence. All the water veins converge upon [[Erinnyes]] and the weeping willow flourishes or withers when the waters are sweet or bitter. The land of the lake is the same... Shame, then, that omens only arrive on the same moon as calamity.
