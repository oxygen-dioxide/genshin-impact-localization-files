==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Freycinet:''' Hello, are you here for the hot-air balloon ride too?
:{{DIcon}} You really love this, huh?
::'''Freycinet:''' Yeah. And for me, it's not just the balloon riding experience. Their operating principles are fascinating in their own right!
::'''Freycinet:''' Based on my observations and experiences, despite the balloons being rather slow, they still have [[Fontainian]] aircraft beat both in terms of altitude control and navigation...
::'''Freycinet:''' Oh, speaking of which! Because I've been helping residents with some reconstruction efforts, [[Mr. Pixica]] gave me priority access to hot-air balloon rides!
::'''Freycinet:''' But my shooting skills are complete trash, so I'd better not bug him too often.
::'''Freycinet:''' I'll go chat with him once I've taken down enough notes.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Congratulations.
::'''Freycinet:''' Hehe...
::'''Freycinet:''' Before I came here, someone told me that the people of the [[Flower-Feather Clan]] aren't used to interacting with outsiders. But it doesn't seem that way at all.
::'''Freycinet:''' A little fella even gave me some delicious cake. Want to try some?
:;(Obtain [[Delicious Volcano Cake]] &times;3)
:{{DIcon}} We'll go later.
::'''Freycinet:''' Have fun!
