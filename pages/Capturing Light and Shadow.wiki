==Dialogue==
{{Quest Description|Following the tracks of a Choo-Choo Cart line, you and Paimon run into an enormous space in the cave with a mysterious mural in a very conspicuous spot, which seems to be illustrating someone's story in the "Veluriyam Mirage"...}}
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach the cave)
:'''Paimon:''' What's that?
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, we seem to have arrived at an incredible place! Is that a... {{color|buzzword|mural}} on the stone slate at the center?
:'''Paimon:''' It looks similar to the views you can see outside, but some of those scenes are positioned weirdly...
:'''Paimon:''' Just like before, a place like this must have its secrets. Let's get exploring!

;(Approach the Hydro Eidolon)
:'''Paimon:''' Look at that! Is that a Water Droplet?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's instincts say that it will lead us to the clue!

;(Interact with the notes)
:'''Paimon:''' There are some pieces of paper here. Are they someone's notes?
::<div style="font-size:1.2em"><p align="center">'''Scattered Yet Well-Preserved Pages (I)'''</p></div><hr />
::...
::A great artist must leave something behind for future generations. I, [[Guy Verhaecht]], am confident that one day people will compete just to read my ideation notes.
::All the troubles I've been dealing with are but trivial stumbling blocks along my path to success.
::I see little promise in the youngsters at the Darshan. They just do whatever their teachers say and never take the time to consider where the future of art lies.
::And those teachers are an arrogant lot. Their trust in nothing but their old experiences leaves them unable to adapt, let alone expect them to have the insight to learn new things and expand their horizons.
::A falling out with them was inevitable. And what's the worst that could happen? Never going into that studio again?
::At least I'm not living in the past! The masterpiece I'm going to create will prove my point.
::Following ossified rules and clinging slavishly to by-the-book research is not the way to achieve something great in art.
::Of course, it is equally unwise to cater to the aesthetic conceptions of the many while disregarding one's independent thought.
::To capture the minds of all who lay eyes on the painting with the absolute beauty of our lines and shades &mdash; that is what we are supposed to pursue.
::A work of art like that must be unimpeachable in its details and coloring.
::Only thus can a sense of beauty that connects us be conveyed.
::To achieve something like that, I must travel around the world to gain different experiences of beauty and find that which unites them.
::It is time for me to set out on my artistic journey. On the one hand, I shall find the universal beauty that exists in the hearts of all people...
::And on the other, I shall enlighten the common people with my aesthetics, paving my road to fame.
::...
:'''Paimon:''' Judging by the words they used... It seems like a painter's diary?
:{{DIcon}} So confident...
:{{DIcon}} Even a bit arrogant...
:'''Paimon:''' But Paimon gets it! Without that kind of nerve, no matter what you do, it can be hard to master it quickly!
:'''Paimon:''' But this diary doesn't say much, Paimon is kinda curious about what happened to him after that...
:'''Paimon:''' Perhaps we can find the rest of the diary somewhere else. {{Traveler}}, let's just keep an eye out for it, okay?

;(Approach the Hydro Eidolon)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, the Water Droplet turned that Choo-Choo Cart back on!
:'''Paimon:''' Perhaps we should get onto it. Who knows what we will find, eh?

;(Approach the [[Streaming Projector]])
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm... the Water Droplet broke the seal on another Streaming Projector...
:'''Paimon:''' Look! That huge mural looks a little different now.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon thinks that Water Droplet was guiding us to adjust... or to fix this mural.
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like we've gotta find other Streaming Projectors to put everything that doesn't look right back into place... {{color|buzzword|Maybe something will happen after that}}!

;(Approach the door on the west)
:'''Paimon:''' There's a door over there. Maybe there's something important behind it...
:'''Paimon:''' But we can't reach it through the Choo-Choo Cart tracks... Let's look around somewhere else first, shall we?
----
;(Approach the track leading underground towards the east)
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like this track extends pretty far out, huh? Let's {{color|buzzword|follow it}} to find the Choo-Choo Cart!

;(Read the diary next to the cave, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' There are some diaries on the ground over here? What's going on... Have other people been here before?
::<div style="font-size:1.2em"><p align="center">'''Scattered Yet Well-Preserved Pages (II)'''</p></div><hr />
::...
::It does not make sense. There must be something wrong.
::I must admit that I have encountered some extraordinary artists ever since I left the studio.
::I also admit that they can surpass the masters even without using any particularly famous technique... Albeit with some trick to it, I'm sure!
::And I am all too aware that my works are not yet the equal of those created by my stubborn teachers, nor would I be able to debate the literati who critique art.
::But it's only a matter of time! I am still young, and they are at least two years older than I.
::Surely, I am no one's inferior in talent or vision!
::Surely, I cannot still be inferior to these emblems of mediocrity even after so much practice!
::And surely, I am not like them, who despite their skills, still cannot find a way to depict the lights, shadows, and lines that capture me!
::Time! Time is all I need, and I shall produce a masterwork that will cause all their jaws to drop!
::Next, I must concentrate on honing my skills with a brush and begin my training in earnest.
::But first, I must collect enough funds. Spending too much energy on earning a living on the road shall beggar my efforts, after all.
::I've heard it said that you can encounter a wondrous fairy that can make wishes come true in the Sumeru desert. Perhaps that fairy's help shall see me complete my goal in the shortest time possible...
::If luck is with me, I might even gain more than that.
::I should get my things in order. I must go to find the fairy as soon as possible...
::...
:'''Paimon:''' Huh, this painter seems to have undergone a change of heart...
:{{DIcon}} It's a true master...
:{{DIcon}} *sobs* My ego just took a hit!
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon heard that the more confident you are, the worse it feels when you hit a serious setback.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's a little worried about his mental health, but uh, it's been a long time, so there's nothing we can do for him...
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's concerned about what happened to him after that...

;(Enter the cave)
:'''Paimon:''' Oh no! The Water Droplet over there is surrounded by hilichurls!
:'''Paimon:''' Let's help it out, {{Traveler}}!

;(Defeat the hilichurls)
:'''Paimon:''' Looks like the Water Droplet is beckoning us over there...
:'''Paimon:''' Oh! So there is a Choo-Choo Cart there!

;(Approach the Hydro Eidolon)
:'''Paimon:''' Eek! Where are these things coming from?
:'''Paimon:''' {{Traveler}}, Water Droplet, look out!

;(Defeat the enemies)
:'''Paimon:''' That was close! Good thing we've got this Water Droplet with us. It easily fended off those ambushers...

;(Follow the Hydro Eidolon)
:'''Paimon:''' The Water Droplet turned on the Choo-Choo Cart. Time to take a ride!

;(After the Hydro Eidolon fixes the Streaming Projector)
:'''Paimon:''' Great! Part of the mural has been fixed!
:'''Paimon:''' If we keep it up, we'll restore this mural to its original form in no time!
----
;(Approach the elevated track towards the east)
:'''Paimon:''' Another long track. Let's {{color|buzzword|follow it}} to find the Choo-Choo Cart!

;(Approach the blocked entrance)
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh. Blocked again...
:'''Paimon:''' But we can have a look around. Perhaps there's another way!

;(Approach the trembling Hydro Eidolon)
:'''Paimon:''' This place feels... strange. That fire's casting such strange shadows...
:'''Paimon:''' That Water Droplet is trembling! Is it... freezing in fear?
:'''Paimon:''' Quick, {{Traveler}}, we've gotta do something to help!

;(Read the diary near the Hydro Eidolon, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' What's a diary doing hidden in the corner like this?
::<div style="font-size:1.2em"><p align="center">'''Scattered Yet Well-Preserved Pages (III)'''</p></div><hr />
::...
::Looking back now, I was indeed short-sighted.
::After spending several months in the desert, I ran out of Mora and began to question the existence of the fairy. Coarse words even escaped my lips...
::The benevolent and powerful fairy in the legend does exist. I was even fortunate enough to find the domain she rules, finding for myself temporary respite there.
::The benevolent and powerful [[Oceanid]] asked that I call her [[Idyia]].
::This name, Idyia, has indeed been mentioned in many legends and fairy tales, and it has largely represented a benevolent soul who knows human intents and hearts well.
::This means that I was right! She must know of universal beauty!
::Idyia appeared when I was on the verge of giving up. This must be a sign that all the hardships I have been through were tests she set before me. I must forsake all errant thought and present my request to her in all earnestness.
::While she has yet to accede to my wish, citing such reasons as "I don't force changes on others" and "we shouldn't take shortcuts" by way of declining to directly raise my aesthetics and drawing skills...
::But she gave me a magical drawing board as a gift, together with painting materials that never seem to run out.
::I suspect that there is no realistic hope that I might improve by leaps and bounds in a single day. I should probably do as Idyia hints I should, and hone myself with real practice.
::This is a comfortable place to be anyway. I don't have to worry about food or clothing, and there are wondrous creatures named Hydro Eidolons to keep me company here.
::One might feel creeped out upon first encountering these flexible, pudding-like creatures with the beautiful color of gems. But I have found that they are all quite easy to get along with.
::They make far better company than those arrogant fellows with fake smiles at the studio.
::As we wandered around in the Veluriyam Mirage, I bore witness to a scene of unimaginable magnificence.
::I could often find things left here by different people and hear all sorts of interesting stories. I suppose you could say that my horizons were indeed expanded.
::This change of pace leaves me very relaxed when I paint. Maybe I should just go with the flow...
::...
:'''Paimon:''' It turns out that the huge stone slab outside is the one that Idyia gave to the painter as a canvas!
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, it seems not only had he found landscapes he loved in the Veluriyam Mirage, but also made friends with Water Droplets and found some new inspirations for his paintings!
:{{DIcon}} Quite the fortunate encounter.
:{{DIcon}} Better than practicing to the point of obsession...
:'''Paimon:''' Eek! Now that you mention it, Paimon's heard of some people that go nuts after a failure! They just keep trying harder and harder until they lose themselves...
:'''Paimon:''' Thanks to the painting tools Idyia provided and the company of the Water Droplets, he stayed on the right track!

;(While riding the Choo-Choo Cart)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, so this is how the seal is broken! We can take this path to reach other places...

;(After the Hydro Eidolon fixes the Streaming Projector)
:'''Paimon:''' We did it again! This mural is going to be restored to its former glory pretty soon...
:'''Paimon:''' The Water Droplets are gathering towards the mural... It seems that they just can't leave it behind!
----
;(Read the diary near the Hydro Eidolon in the northern cave, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' There's a diary here, and it looks really well preserved.
::<div style="font-size:1.2em"><p align="center">'''Scattered Yet Well-Preserved Pages (IV)'''</p></div><hr />
::...
::Thanks to the companionship and help of the Hydro Eidolons, I've finished my first piece of work despite bumbling along quite a bit...
::By the standards I once held, I would not have rated this mural as a masterpiece in any way. But with the passage of time and the changes in the environment of the Mirage itself, even displacement... I must admit that in truth, this is the work I have put the most effort into, and the one I love most.
::It woke me up from my silly dreams.
::I used to be young and haughty, and I drew false conclusions from my rough understanding of this great undertaking known as painting, without ever having put in the time to study the relevant techniques.
::Only when I found myself puzzling over my great masterpiece did I find that I was simply not good enough.
::I once emphasized an interplay of light, shadow, and lines that would "capture" people, but that was me holding onto too many arrogant fantasies, chasing a perfection in form only.
::Perhaps there is no such thing as perfect painting technique or universal standards of beauty that all ascribe to.
::During my stay in the Veluriyam Mirage, Idyia and the Hydro Eidolons showed me a lot of stunning scenes and told me about the stories behind them.
::And as objects situated in the real world, it is impossible for their every color and contour to meet some standard set by art criticism.
::Yet they captivated me, inspired my soul in countless ways.
::What those lines and shades captured was not my fastidious eye, but my heart &mdash; it was through my heart that they resonated with me.
::That is why I inscribed all that I saw and heard here in the form of this mural.
::I have now come to believe that elegant technique cannot be the ultimate focus for great art, nor can one only be concerned with polishing every last detail to an unsurpassed sheen.
::Instead, we should begin with something that can move human hearts, with our shading and lines to follow from that.
::Of course, this might just be my one-sided opinion. Never again will I be so arrogant as to try constructing general, empty principles that all people can acknowledge.
::All I want is to achieve something good in my own eyes and try conveying that emotion that so moved me to others.
::As such, I cannot stay here forever. I must return to my daily existence and put my painting skills into practice.
::This mural shall bear witness to my days in the Veluriyam Mirage, and it shall also be my gift to Idyia and the Hydro Eidolons...
::...
:'''Paimon:''' Whew... now that's a relief!
:'''Paimon:''' He untangled the knot in his heart, and improved his painting skills! Paimon thinks he'll definitely be really successful.
:'''Paimon:''' Though he left his Water Droplet friends behind, which sounds a bit sad to Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} Not all artists can accept imitations.
:{{DIcon}} Insisting on one's own uniqueness makes sense.
:'''Paimon:''' Hmm, Paimon can understand that.
:'''Paimon:''' There's still something that confuses Paimon. He mentioned in the diary that the mural can lose its shape and shift.
:'''Paimon:''' But even after such a serious accident... the mural seems alright?
:{{DIcon}} It's these Water Droplets.
:{{DIcon}} They protected their friend's mural.
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh, that's right! No wonder the Water Droplets are so familiar with the Streaming Projector and restoring the mural...
:'''Paimon:''' It's so moving... Water Droplets may not look that bright, but they are really considerate and loyal friends...

;(Activate the two Hydro [[Elemental Monument]]s)
:'''Paimon:''' Look over there! It seems like the Water Droplet can get through that fence.

;(Interact with the Hydro Eidolon)
:{{DIcon}} Please help!

;(Enter the next room)
:'''Paimon:''' Another monster from straight outta nowhere...
:'''Paimon:''' Stop getting in our way! We're gonna fix the crystallization of the Water Droplet's friendship, and that's final!

;(Approach the flooded room)
:'''Paimon:''' The road ahead's been blocked by a pond! What should we do now?
:'''Paimon:''' There are a few more elemental monuments nearby... Let's light them all up just like we did before!

;(Light all three Elemental Monuments)
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, it happened again! One monument lights up, and another goes dark...
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe there's something preventing them from lighting up at the same time.
:'''Paimon:''' We have the Water Droplet to guide us this time. Maybe it might help?
:'''Paimon:''' Which monument should we take the Water Droplet to?

;(Interact with the Hydro Eidolon)
:{{DIcon}} Please check on the Hydro monument.
:;(The Hydro Eidolon checks the monument and stays in place)
::'''Paimon:''' Let's hurry up and light up the other monuments as well!
:{{DIcon}} Please check on the Pyro monument.
:;(The Hydro Eidolon checks the monument and returns)
:{{DIcon}} Please check on the Cryo monument.
:;(The Hydro Eidolon checks the monument and returns)

;(Complete the puzzle)
:'''Paimon:''' Ah, the Water Droplet lit up that Hydro monument!
:'''Paimon:''' It worked! The water level has been lowered!
:'''Paimon:''' Hee-hee, we and the Water Droplet make a great team, huh?

;(Follow the Hydro Eidolon to the Choo-Choo Cart)
:'''Paimon:''' Finally! The last Choo-Choo Cart!

;(After the Hydro Eidolon fixes the Streaming Projector)
:'''Paimon:''' Alright, this should be the most critical step. Let's keep it up, {{Traveler}}!
:'''Paimon:''' As long as we use the power of the Streaming Projectors, we can completely restore the mural!
----
;(Inside the Preprint)
:;(Obtain {{Item|Mural Fragment: Swirling Clouds}}, {{Item|Mural Fragment: Central Hub}}, {{Item|Mural Fragment: Sky Keep}} and {{Item|Mural Fragment: Flower of the Valley}})

;(After fixing the mural in the Preprint)
:'''Paimon:''' Voila! All done!
;(If the player has not read all of the Scattered Yet Well-Preserved Pages)
::'''Paimon:''' Seeing Water Droplets so happy really gives Paimon a sense of achievement!
::{{DIcon}} This mural is important to the Water Droplets.
::{{DIcon}} There are still many stories about the painter and Water Droplets we don't know.
::'''Paimon:''' Right! Based on their reaction, it seems the Water Droplets really care about the painter. We haven't collected all the diary fragments and read the painter's whole story...
::'''Paimon:''' If we have some extra time on our hands, we can explore the cave and find the rest of the diary fragments!
;(If the player has read all of the Scattered Yet Well-Preserved Pages)
::'''Paimon:''' Seeing the Water Droplets so happy makes Paimon happy too!
::{{DIcon}} We protected the essence of friendship.
::{{DIcon}} We made the Water Droplets' wish come true.
::'''Paimon:''' Now, both the painter's friends and their work in the Veluriyam Mirage are looking their best!
::'''Paimon:''' Maybe someday, that painter will return to visit their friends and look at their masterpiece!
:'''Paimon:''' Speaking of which, the style of this painting is pretty unique... Even though it's not that fancy, it's still beautiful!
:'''Paimon:''' And what's more important is that Paimon can understand it! Perhaps if Paimon imitates the style, she can also paint lovely yet understandable paintings!
:{{DIcon}} Sensational paintings aren't necessarily complicated.
:{{DIcon}} Wanna learn how to paint that way, Paimon?
:'''Paimon:''' Yes! And if it's okay with you, let's take a picture of this painting!
:'''Paimon:''' Then Paimon can study the painting whenever she likes!
:'''Paimon:''' Maybe once Paimon has also painted something that pretty, it'll attract lots of Water Droplets that want to be Paimon's friends!
