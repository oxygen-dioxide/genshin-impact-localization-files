The [[Valberry|Valberries]] are at their best right now, crisp, plump, and sweet to the taste.

Unfortunately, they only grow in the humid and windy areas of the mountains and are difficult to cultivate.

There's only so many that grow naturally that they can't be used feasible in the wine industry.

But I digress, I have already taken care of everything without any issues. How are you doing?

If you have time, let's have dinner tonight.

I'd like to make a drink from the Valberries I've freshly picked and share it with you. No expense should be spared on occasions like these.

As for matters that I am unable to say in this letter, I will tell you personally when we meet.
