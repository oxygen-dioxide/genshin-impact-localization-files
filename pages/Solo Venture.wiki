{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Jack)
:'''Jack:''' This is bad... This is really bad...
:{{DIcon}} What's wrong?
:'''Jack:''' Oh, you're... the traveler. *sigh* You must have seen the storm that hit us, too. All of Mondstadt's a mess right now.
:'''Jack:''' [[Cyrus]] said the we need to stop monsters from taking this opportunity to attack us. So he put out commissions for adventurers to scout their movements out.
:'''Jack:''' My next commission was to observe the monsters around the Thousand Winds Temple, so I confirmed my tasking and left.
:'''Jack:''' At the Temple, I saw a large group of monsters gathering together, and I tried to get a closer look...
:'''Jack:''' But I didn't expect to be discovered almost immediately upon getting closer. If a passing adventurer hadn't come to my rescue, I wouldn't have made it.
:'''Jack:''' We left the Thousand Winds Temple for fear of being attacked by more monsters, and came back to Mondstadt.
:'''Jack:''' And that's when I realized... that I had left my Adventurer Handbook and map at the Temple.
:'''Jack:''' But there's no way I can go to get it back like this...
:'''Jack:''' Traveler, would you be willing to help me go to the Thousand Winds Temple and retrieve my map and Adventurer Handbook?
:{{DIcon}} Leave it to me.
::'''Jack:''' Thank you so much. *sigh* Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing...
:{{DIcon}} Why were you there in the first place...
::'''Jack:''' Ugh, this is a bit embarrassing... Do you know of the Adventurer Rank Rating?
::'''Jack:''' I thought that if I could show my stuff a bit more, I could get through the rating process safely.
::'''Jack:''' But I never thought that... *sigh* Please, help me get my map and Adventurer Handbook back.
::'''Jack:''' I need to be more careful in future...

;(Talk to Jack again, optional)
:'''Jack:''' I need to be more cautious in the future.
:'''Jack:''' But not too careful, because... *sigh*

----

;(Report back to Jack)
:'''Jack:''' Did you manage to find them?
:{{DIcon}} Got them right here.
:'''Jack:''' Whew, that's a relief. I've always been using this map, so I've put down a lot of markings onto it. Losing it would have been a disaster.
:'''Jack:''' And if I really lost my handbook, I don't know how I would have asked [[Katheryne]] for a new one.
:'''Jack:''' I mean, what a joke, for an adventurer to lose their handbook during an adventure...
:'''Jack:''' Thanks, I'll keep these things close from now on. Please take these as a token of my appreciation.
