==Descriptions==
{{Description|"As I was traveling alone, I discovered this vast and terrible ruin. Perhaps this is all that remains of an ancient civilization that was punished and destroyed. This ancient city seems to resist the presence of any outsiders... It might even have something to do with those purple-black crystals, or that mud-like substance."<br />"I stayed for a time, but I had to leave its ominous, upended silhouette behind."|Viewpoint, [[Viewpoint/The Inverted City|The Inverted City]]}}

==Lore==
[[Dainsleif]] believes that the city was built by a civilization more ancient than Khaenri'ah or the [[Abyss Order]]; however, he remarks that the architecture resembles Khaenri'ah's. Since then, the Abyss Order took over the city.

Within the city is an upside-down pool, which weakens the effect of Dainsleif's curse when he is nearby. Dainsleif believes that the pool is also a relic of the more ancient civilization and is part of the city's structure.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Grave of the Guarded}}</ref>
