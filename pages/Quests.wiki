'''Quests''' are the story content in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''.

==Types of Quests==
===[[File:Icon Archon Quest.png|30px|link=]] Archon Quests===
{{Main|Archon Quests}}
'''Archon Quests''' tell the ''main story'' of the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]], as they travel the world of [[Teyvat]] in search of the Traveler's missing twin sibling by proxy of visiting all of [[The Seven]]. They are voiced.

===[[File:Icon Story Quest.png|30px|link=]] Story Quests===
{{Main|Story Quests}}
'''Story Quests''' consist primarily of chapters related to the background and personalities of each [[playable character]] or alternatively Event Quest lines. [[Hangout Events]] belong to this category of quests. They are voiced.

===[[File:Icon World Quest.png|30px|link=]] World Quests===
{{Main|World Quests}}
'''World Quests''' are unlocked by speaking to [[NPCs]] throughout Teyvat. They give insight into the various locations and stories of the world. They are usually unvoiced.

===[[File:Icon Commission.svg|30px|link=]] Commissions===
{{Main|Commissions}}
'''Commissions''' are daily quests players can complete for rewards, but [[:Category:NPC Commissions|some]] have a unique story tied to them and have specific requirements. They are unvoiced.

==Notes==
[[File:Quest Menu - Busy character and location example.png|thumb|right|200px|Example of a character and location being busy at the same time.]]
In some cases, it will not be possible to join a quest due to a character and/or location being involved in another quest. The player can go to the quest menu to find out which one must be cleared so that the target character/location will be "free" for the original quest. This mechanic is mentioned in a [[Loading Screen]].

==Trivia==
* The "Navigate" feature in the quest menu will pinpoint the quest objective on the player's map and signal it with a yellow beam in the overworld. The beam will only appear when the player's distance is 50m or more from the objective.
* It is possible for another player to join a world while the host player is in a real-time rendered cutscene. The joining player's active character will appear in the scene and the cutscene will not be interrupted.
** Once the host ends Co-Op Mode, they will have to watch the cutscene again.
* [[Ellin, the Wannabe Knight]] is the only Commission to have voice-over. It has three voiced lines.
