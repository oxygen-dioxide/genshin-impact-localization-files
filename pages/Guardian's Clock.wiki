{{Description|A small timekeeping gadget. On moonless nights, it was the only way its former owner could know the time.}}
'''Guardian's Clock''' is an [[Artifact]] in the set [[Defender's Will]].

==Description==
The ticking of the clock's hands, the candlelight, and the reams of case notes,<br />The shadows by moonlight, the blade and black mantle,<br />These were the constant companions of the lonesome guardian.<br />But no matter how far he went, there was never enough time.<br />[[Arundolyn|His superior]], carefree and proud, often laughed at his curtness, his unsmiling face, his aversion to fun.

But the guardian was not one to look back on the past — only to the present and future.<br />Only by reaving every last trace of evil, no matter the means,<br />Could he ensure that this land that his friend and loved superior could have a future without fear.

Only when he gazed on that maiden in the square,<br />Could he think upon things he had no time for.

Only then could he think about his own future...
