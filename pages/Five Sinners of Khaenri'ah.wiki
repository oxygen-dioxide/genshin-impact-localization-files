'''The Five Sinners of Khaenri'ah''' were five individuals of great esteem in [[Khaenri'ah]] and were considered the best of their peers. [[Dainsleif]] claims that if he and the five had worked together, they could have stopped the [[Irmin|Vinster King]] from rocking the consciousness of [[Teyvat]]. Yet they could not resist the call of the [[Abyss]] and they divided up amongst themselves "a power that could destroy the world." Thus they became sinners but also transcendent beings with "world-shattering power." When the [[cataclysm]] occurred, none of them came to defend Khaenri'ah.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Memories That Should Not Exist}}</ref>

After the cataclysm, the Five appear to have separated. Three mentioned by [[Skirk]] are "pursuing some form of perfection,"<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Opera of Noirceur and Blancheur}}</ref> a motivation which may extend to the other two given their shared origin.
