==Profile==
Potton, under the guise of Rawat, was a researcher at the [[Fontaine Research Institute]] and entrepreneur known for developing the skincare product Butterfly Dew. Secretly, he worked with Fontainian criminals to produce and sell potions capable of changing the appearance of Fontainians.

==Story==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
Potton was raised alone by his [[Sick Old Lady|mother]]. As he grew older, his mother became progressively more ill until becoming bed-bound. Due to his facial deformity, he was rejected by Fontainian society, with only criminals taking interest in him. He was recruited by [[Gascon]] to join the [[Sinthe]] business, and later blackmailed into staying after Gascon's group leaked a picture of Potton to the [[Marechaussee Phantom]].

By chance, Potton one day discovered that the residue of Fontainians dissolved by [[Primordial Sea|Primordial Seawater]] could be mixed with other ingredients to create a potion that allowed Fontainians to change their appearance to anything they desired. He utilized this potion to create a new identity for himself, Rawat, and using the newfound goodwill towards him afforded by his now handsome appearance, he seized the opportunity to turn his life around. He became a researcher at the Fontaine Research Institute under the guise of Rawat to further his research into potion-making and was approached by [[Enri]] to work with him, now as a partner rather than an underling. Potton played both of these roles to his advantage. Utilizing his connections to the Sinthe business, he secured the source liquid for his potion from [[Marcel (Fontaine)|Vacher]], which allowed the former to dispose of evidence related to his experiments with Primordial Seawater. On top of the profits made through his potion business, Potton would then use some of this source liquid to further his research into cosmetics at the Fontaine Research Institute, eventually developing Butterfly Dew. 

Potton spent the money he earned through his business ventures on medicine for his mother, but no amount of treatment seemed to improve her condition. One day, he went to visit his mother, only to realize that she could not recognize him at all due to his altered appearance as Rawat. 

Due to a tipoff he made the Marechaussee Phantom to deal with Gascon's group, Potton was initially sent to the [[Fortress of Meropide]]. However, he manages to escape alongside the other inmates, where they reconvene at his research facility. The Marechausee Phantom eventually discover the location due to his negligence in leaving a paper behind at his home, where they find him arguing with the other members due to him not telling them about the potion's side effect of "melting" their faces; this side effect was actually due to Fontanians having been absolved by [[Neuvillette]] of their sins, negating the effects of Primordial Seawater. In the ensuing scuffle, Potton manages to escape and trap the group while releasing poison gas, though he lets them go after [[Sigewinne]] convinces him to do so by giving him an improved version of his potion.

Potton immediately uses the potion to return home to see his mother one last time, but he was stopped by the [[Melusine]] [[Ceasth]]. He explains to the group about his work and is able to discern that Sigewinne had a similar situation as him in the past, due to her human-like appearance and claiming that they were alike. Ultimately, Sigewinne convinces [[Morgane]] to let him see his mother a final time before going back to prison, but to his despair, his mother fails to recognize him, yet she recognizes Sigewinne in her final moments. Upon being interrogated, Potton confesses to his crimes without much resistance and his lotion, Butterfly Dew, is recalled by the authorities.
