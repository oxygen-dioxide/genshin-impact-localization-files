'''Pervases''' was one of the [[Yaksha]]s who perished over a thousand years ago. He appears in the [[Alatus Chapter]], Act I: [[Butterfly's Dream]], at a run-down temple for the adepti near the foot on [[Mt. Tianheng]].

==Profile==
{{Quote

|Pervases' catchphrase
}}

Pervases was a junior in the Yaksha order of adepti, but perished during the [[Archon War]]. Using a censer and seven lamps, he performed the Mortal Lingering ritual on the thousandth anniversary of his death in order to get a chance to see modern Liyue. However, he willingly gives up these objects to the Traveler so that they can perform the Dream Trawler ritual to get revenge on [[Wang Ping'an|Starsnatcher]] for impersonating an adeptus.

His favorite food was [[Grilled Ticker Fish]],<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Insights of Drifting Dreams}}</ref> which was apparently a favorite among many adepti.<ref>{{Ref/NPC|Chen the Sharp|idle=1|c=during Lantern Rite}}</ref>

===Personality===
Pervases has a love of poetry, and his opening and closing lines are poems that describe himself. He is also incredibly selfless, sensing Xiao's aura on the Traveler and allowing them to take the censer and lamps that he procured without hesitation, despite never getting the chance to see modern Liyue in doing so.

Younger than the Five most powerful Yakshas, Pervases has a likable personality; Xiao states that [[Bosacius]] was close with him, and mourned his passing. He considers Xiao to be his senior and has great respect for him, telling the Traveler to send his regards to Vigilant Yaksha. He expresses sadness and regret upon sensing his karmic burden on them, knowing that Xiao has suffered for thousands of years and considers his own death to be an easy way out compared to what Xiao has gone through.

===Appearance===
In his human form, Pervases has short, slicked-back black hair and brown eyes. He wears a generic Liyue NPC's red robe. His illuminated beast form, seen only in-game as a statue, is a crane who adorns a necklace of large beads similar to what Xiao wears.

===History===
It is unknown when or how Pervases came to serve [[Rex Lapis]], or his history before becoming a Yaksha, but the Archon personally gave him the name "Pervases." Though Pervases was slain during the [[Archon War]], his spirit managed to linger on, dwelling within the statue of a crane in his run-down temple.

One thousand years later, on the anniversary of his death, the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] run into him while seeking out a censer and the seven-star lamps so Xiao can teach them to perform the Dream Trawler ritual and punish [[Starsnatcher]] for his treachery. He senses Xiao's aura on them &mdash; and the burden of karma that he bears. He permits them to take the items they need, despite knowing that this would dispel the Mortal Lingering ritual he performed. After telling them the truth about himself, and leaving a message to deliver to Xiao, his spirit grows dormant again. Afterwards, Wang Ping'an, having discarded his Starsnatcher alias and become repentant, carried out a project to restore Pervases' temple to good condition.

After Rex Lapis saves Xiao from [[the Chasm]], he returns to Pervases' temple to ponder the fate of the Yakshas. It is here that it is revealed that Pervases was close with the Prime Yaksha, Bosacius, and that Xiao regrets that Pervases is one of the many examples of a Yaksha who had to pay the ultimate price.
