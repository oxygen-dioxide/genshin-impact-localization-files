'''''"Infinitesimal"''''' is an [[Achievement]] in the category ''[[Duelist: Series III]]''. To complete this achievement, the player needs to defeat the [[Local Legend]] {{Enemy|Eroding Avatar of Lava|text="Infinitesimal" &mdash; A Fiery Stone Gathers No Moss}} when it first enters a weakened state.

The "weakened state" the achievement refers to is when Infinitesimal's {{Geo}} Ward is fully depleted and its [[Fury]] bar completely filled. The player will have ~45 seconds to defeat the boss after both forms of protection are removed before it returns to its normal state.
