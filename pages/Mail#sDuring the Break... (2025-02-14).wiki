|text      = The fleet is taking a break at [[Port Ormos]] now. I walked into [[Lambad's Tavern|a tavern]] earlier and found out [[Lambad|the owner]] is a real sailing enthusiast &mdash; he even treated us to some of his specialty dishes! Haha, in [[Liyue]], we believe in reciprocity, so how could I accept his kindness without giving something in return? [[Juza|The Chief Mate]] has already invited him for a tour of the deck. Hope he enjoys himself! Whenever I meet new friends who click with me, I can't help but think of you! How have you been lately? Now that we've got good food and wine, care to meet up?

The clock is ticking though. We'll set sail again right after we're done eating and drinking here. Can't deny the port is peaceful and comfortable, but [[The Alcor]] was born for the waves.

You can't argue with that, can you? Haha!
