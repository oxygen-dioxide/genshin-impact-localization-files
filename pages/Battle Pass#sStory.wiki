{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Venti:''' Once, there was a glorious kingdom established among the heavens.
:'''Venti:''' From that kingdom came a crowned heir, tasked with seeking out the Genesis Pearl from the Kingdom of Darkness.
:'''Venti:''' The first crowned heir began her journey of seeking the pearl.
:'''Venti:''' But she was deceived, and the memory of her noble origins faded.
:'''Venti:''' She now believed that she was the queen of the Kingdom of Darkness.
:'''Venti:''' But take heart, a second crowned heir had already taken up the path where the first had stumbled.

==Trivia==
* The story appears to be influenced by the [http://gnosis.org/library/hymnpearl.htm Hymn of the Pearl], a gnostic hymn in which the speaker, a prince, goes in search of a pearl guarded by a serpent and forgets his original role and purpose.
