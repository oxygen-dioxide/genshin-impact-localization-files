'''A.M.''' {{Lang|'''Shumilov'''|ru=Шумилов|ru_rm={{#invoke:ru-rm|main|Шумилов}}}} is a quest-exclusive [[NPC]] that appears in the {{Quest|In Search of Lost Time: West}}.
==Profile==
Second Lieutenant A.M. Shumilov is a member of the 34th Independent Investigative Squad, acting as its squad deputy captain under Lieutenant [[Malinovskyi]]. He obtained the role due to personal shuffling by headquarters once the Investigative Squad's mission was complete. However, his drive, strictness and blunt nature made him unpleasant to work with, as most of the squad just wanted to relax now that their mission was over. Not wishing to argue with him, Malinovskyi forged letters from the [[Maison Gestion]] and told Shumilov the Squad was to investigate several outposts in order to keep him occupied. Shumilov eventually took charge of the eastern quadrant, much to the chagrin of those under his care: Corporal H.A. Petunin, Private N.N. Shagayev, Private A.U. Yudichev, Corporal V.T. Eyubov, Private C.A. Zinkov and Sergeant F.S. Vorovskaya. He had them divided into two caps, excluding Vorovskaya, who was to patrol between the camps and report any misconduct, much to her annoyance. Disapproving of their lax attitude, Shumilov attempted to enforce discipline by limiting their eating times and having them all eat together at the signal of striking a pot, which was exploited by the Traveler, who used it to lure him out and beat him into submission, forcing him to retreat.
===Appearance===
Shumilov takes on the form of a [[Fatui Skirmisher - Electrohammer Vanguard]].
