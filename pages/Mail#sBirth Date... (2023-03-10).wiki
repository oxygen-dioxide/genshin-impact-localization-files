|text    = This morning, [[Cloud Retainer|my master]] cooked medicinal soup and many other exquisite dishes for me. She also invited [[Moon Carver]] and [[Mountain Shaper]] for a gathering.

In my master's abode, the soothing aroma of the dishes and the familiar atmosphere of a friendly reunion made for a comforting respite.

I, on my part, collected dew from [[Violetgrass]] and fetched well-preserved aromatic herbs to make some simple refreshments. Though my cooking skill is not as good as my master's, the refreshments are a token of my good wishes... and a sign of how I've changed since returning to human society.

I would feel content if you could try them and tell me what you think.

One last thing. My master prepared a generous portion of medicinal soup for me. I only had a small bowl. After that, I cooked some noodles for you with the rest of the soup. I hope you like it.
