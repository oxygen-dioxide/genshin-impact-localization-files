{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Sara)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} I heard that someone placed a custom order...
:'''Sara:''' That's correct. You're here to help, right? Then you're right on time &mdash; I'd just finished making this Mondstadt Hash Brown.
:'''Sara:''' It's supposed to go to [[Silio]]. He paid us earlier, and said that he'd be waiting for his delivery near Stormbearer Point.
:{{DIcon}} I'll deliver it right now.
::'''Sara:''' Thanks so much!
::'''Sara:''' Oh, yes, this Mondstadt Hash Brown is just out of the oven, so do handle it with care.
::'''Sara:''' Don't {{Color|buzzword|run too fast, use your wind glider, and don't get into a fight}}, or that hash brown may just come apart.
::'''Sara:''' You do have to be quick, though. This dish won't taste good if it gets cold.
:;(Obtain [[Special Mondstadt Hash Brown (While It's Warm)]] ×1)
:{{DIcon}} Hmm, I've got other things to do right now.
::'''Sara:''' Really? Okay then. I'll find someone else to make that delivery...

:;(Quest resets)

;(Upon failure via timeout)
:'''Paimon:''' Uh, looks like you took too long. There's no way Silio's gonna eat a hash brown that's gone this cold.
:'''Paimon:''' Well, nothing to do but go back to Sara and get a new serving.
:;(Quest resets)

;(Talk to Hardworking Silio)
:'''Hardworking Silio:''' Ugh, I'm starving... Why hasn't my order arrived yet?

::'''Sara:''' Please be careful while you make the delivery. {{Color|buzzword|Don't let any strange elements touch the food}}.

:'''Sara:''' After that, he asked that we deliver it to him near [[Brightcrown Canyon]]. But that's some distance away, and I don't have anyone I can send there...
:'''Sara:''' If you're alright with it, could you help us deliver it to him?
:{{DIcon}} I'll deliver it right now.
::'''Sara:''' Thank you so much. It's much too far away, and we haven't the people to spare.
::'''Sara:''' Ah, yes, please be careful while you travel. {{Color|buzzword|Don't run too fast or use your wind glider. You definitely shouldn't climb either...}}
::'''Sara:''' If you takes<!--sic--> too many bumps along the way, the meat sauce and noodles might come apart... and if that happens, I don't think the customer will accept it.

:'''Sara:''' He wants us to bring it to a place south of [[Brightcrown Canyon]]...
:'''Sara:''' But we've been getting more and more take-out orders lately for some reason, and we can barely keep up.
:'''Sara:''' If you don't mind, could you help us with this delivery?
:{{DIcon}} I'll deliver it right now.
::'''Sara:''' Great! Thanks for helping.
::'''Sara:''' Just remember {{Color|buzzword|not to get hit or run too fast}}. I don't think Wallit will accept Tea Break Pancakes that look all messed up.
:;(Obtain [[Special Tea Break Pancake]] ×1)

===Day 5 &mdash; Mondstadt Hash Brown===
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Talk to Sara)
:{{DIcon|Quest}} I heard that someone placed a custom order...
:'''Sara:''' Well, here's what happened. Silio ordered a serving of Mondstadt Hash Brown, and said that he'd like it delivered around this time.
:'''Sara:''' This hash brown is particularly fragile. If you shake it too much, it might fall apart. {{Color|buzzword|Please deliver it in time}} so that it can maintain its crumbly mouthfeel.
:'''Sara:''' If something happens to you out there, please bring that serving back and I'll prepare a new one for you.
:{{DIcon}} Sure, I'll deliver it.
::'''Sara:''' Great! Thanks for helping.
::'''Sara:''' Please remember to {{Color|buzzword|avoid getting hit by any element}} while you're on your way. Be careful now, and don't get hurt.
