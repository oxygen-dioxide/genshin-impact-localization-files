'''Chess Pieces''' are items that can be found in the [[Great Red Sand]], [[Sumeru]] that are place on the glowing platforms in [[Safhe Shatranj]]. The quest ''[[Memories of Gurabad]]'' can be started after placing every chess piece. After completing ''Memories of Gurabad'', then each chess piece can be activated through completing the [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] ''[[Chessboard of Safhe Shatranj]]''.

After the [[Activation Device]] is placed in a chess piece, it allows for teleportation to that location.

The chess pieces for [[Deshret's Glass Goblet]] and [[The Mausoleum of King Deshret]] are already placed.
