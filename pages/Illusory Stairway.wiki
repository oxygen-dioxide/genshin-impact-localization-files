==Trivia==
* Staircases with the same design were also found in the [[Perilous Trail]] domain [[Chamber of Twisted Cranes]], but the puzzle was different: the staircase did not change directions based on a device, but rather the destination platform was rotated based on an activation point.
* Staircases with a similar design, but lacking the activation mechanic, can be found during the domain [[Court of Desolation]] in {{Quest|All Returns to Silence}}.
