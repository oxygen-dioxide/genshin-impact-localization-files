'''''As Though Surrounded by Thunder''''' is the third part of the [[Enchanted Tales of the Mikawa Festival]] Event.

==Steps==
# Wait until the next day (13:00 &ndash; 15:00)
# Talk to [[Yae Miko|Miko]] and the others
# Talk to [[Ei]]
#* Talk to the contestants from various teams (optional)
# Prepare for battle with Ei
# Defeat the Nightmare Fragments
#* {{Enemy|Kairagi: Dancing Thunder|link=Nightmare Fragments|text=Nightmare Fragments &mdash; An All-Too-Distant Dream}}

==Gameplay Notes==
* During step 5:
** The active party will be limited to a trial [[Traveler]] aligned to [[Electro]] and using a special combat mode (see [[#Tutorials|Tutorials]]).
** The Traveler cannot die and will automatically recover 80% of their Max HP when they reach very low health.<!-- from HTML comment from dialogue trigger below: can't get below 259 at WL9, which is 1% - at which you stop getting damage, Miko says her line you get healed - for 20706 on WL9, which is 80%; same behavior confirmed for WL8; Miko's line triggers only first time, 2nd time onwards it heals without saying anything -->
** {{Enemy|Ei|link=Ei (Quest Boss)}} will fight alongside the player in her first phase, though she will not perform '''Lightning Blade''', '''Magatsu Electroculi''', and '''Vision Hunt Decree'''.
** "Everyone's Prayers" will assist three times during the battle. Each time, a fixed pink indicator circle will spawn at the location of the Nightmare Fragments, and after a short delay, several strikes will descend within the circle, dealing {{Color|Physical DMG}} to the Nightmare Fragments.

;(Pass time)
:{{A|vo schjeq003 1 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Alright! It's finally time for the festival! Hopefully, everything goes okay... Do you think everyone completed their games? Let's go check it out!

;(Approach [[Kamisato Ayato]], [[Yae Miko]], [[Kujou Sara]], and [[Shikanoin Heizou]])
:'''Kamisato Ayato:''' ...I assembled all the key information into booklets, Lady Guuji, and the incantation for the ritual has been distributed along with them.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 1 yaemiko 01.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Remarkably efficient, Ayato. How are things with the [[Tenryou Commission]]?
:'''Kujou Sara:''' We have adjusted our defensive efforts in response to the Nightmare Fragment. Now that we no longer need to worry about the doppelgangers, we can be much more efficient.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 1 paimon 02.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Oh, you're all here!
:'''Shikanoin Heizou:''' Ah, and with your arrival, we can be even more confident in the strength of our defenses.
:'''Kujou Sara:''' Nevertheless, we must remain vigilant. We all must do our part to give {{Traveler}} and the Shogun the best chance against this enemy.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 1 paimon 03.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Well, it's a relief to have you all in our corner!
:{{DIcon}} Wait a minute, where's [[Ayaka]]?
:'''Kamisato Ayato:''' Hehe... With the festival preparations complete, we have everything covered over here. Ayaka is currently helping those in need, you could say.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 1 paimon 04.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Those in need?
:'''Kamisato Ayato:''' Most of the game development teams are short on manpower, so Ayaka and a few others are helping them out.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 1 yaemiko 02.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' I'm sure you'll run into her as you walk around. Oh, and just a reminder &mdash; you need to select the best game later tonight.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 1 yaemiko 03.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Most importantly, don't forget to enjoy yourself! We need this event to be as "joyful" as possible if we want the plan to work.
:{{DIcon}} Oh, I almost forgot about that...
:{{A|vo schjeq003 1 yaemiko 04.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Once you're done experiencing the festival, you should check in with Ei.
:;(The camera pans to Ei standing on a nearby cliff)
----
;(Talk to [[Thoma]], [[Arataki Itto]], or [[Kuki Shinobu]], optional)
:'''Arataki Itto:''' Ohoho, Thoma, my bro! Heard you're in a bind! The "Almighty Arataki Unbeatable and Unmatched Game Dev Team" is here to help!
:{{A|vo schjeq003 3 together 01.ogg}} '''Mamoru, Akira, and Genta:''' The [[Arataki Gang]] rules!
:'''Kuki Shinobu:''' ...I'm not sure how "helpful" most of them will turn out to be, but I, at least, am a licensed game designer.
:'''Thoma:''' I'm... so sorry everyone. I was so focused on this game, I didn't notice [[Kinkaku]] and the others at all...
:{{A|vo schjeq003 3 shousei 01.ogg}} '''"Shousei":''' Not your fault! [[Bake-danuki]] are powerful! Even [[Shousei]] couldn't smell them!
:{{DIcon}} Yeah, we didn't notice anything either.
:'''Thoma:''' {{Traveler}}... Paimon...
:'''Arataki Itto:''' Don't sweat the small stuff! I'm sure all [[Hitotsume Kozou]] and those little fellas want... is for you to honor their last wishes and finish what you set out to do!
:'''Kuki Shinobu:''' Um... That was beautiful, boss. But, "last wishes" are used for people who are, y'know... dead.
:'''Arataki Itto:''' Dead? As in the big sleep? The final curtain? The last hurrah? ...[[Genta]], you copied down the wrong thing!
:{{A|vo schjeq003 3 shousei 02.ogg}} '''"Shousei":''' Long-horned [[oni]] is stupid... Stupid oni really help make game?
:'''Thoma:''' Heh... We'll see. But, as you said, I'll try my best to, um... finish what we started.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 3 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' By the way, where are the real Hitotsume Kozou and his friends? And what about [[Tetsunosuke]] and the others?
:'''Thoma:''' After the three passed out, the bake-danuki hid them in their home to keep them safe... Even under the influence of a Nightmare Fragment, bake-danuki are kind at heart.
:'''Thoma:''' As for Tetsunosuke and the others... They're in charge of setting up the ritual as punishment for causing all that panic &mdash; something about showing them what it's really like to "work through the night"...?
:{{DIcon}} Sounds like Miko's doing...
:'''Thoma:''' Hehe, once you deal with the crisis, I think I'll get the whole gang together &mdash; Hitotsume Kozou, [[Youko]], [[Kappa]]...
:'''Thoma:''' Plus, Kinkaku, [[Ginkaku]], and Tetsunosuke, too... We can all play "Akitsu Harpastum" to our heart's content!

;(Talk to Thoma, Itto, or Shinobu again, optional)
:'''Arataki Itto:''' Hmm, I'm thinkin' we spice up the final stage with a [["Kaboom King"]]... designed after the one and oni Arataki Itto! I mean, c'mon, how epic are these horns!?
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 together 01.ogg}} '''Mamoru, Akira, and Genta:''' Great idea, Boss!
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' *sigh*... Something tells Paimon this group is about to be as useless as the one you had before...
:'''Kuki Shinobu:''' Don't worry about hurting any feelings, Mr. Thoma. Just let me know if someone's being a nuisance, and I'll knock some sense into them.
:;(Itto shifts and looks dismayed while the rest of the Arataki Gang flinches)
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 shousei 01.ogg}} '''"Shousei":''' Hornless oni... is as scary as ever...
:'''Thoma:''' Haha, it's fine. As long as Itto's okay with the Kaboom King being defeated by a harpastum in the end.

;(Talk to Kamisato Ayaka, [[Yoimiya]], or [[Sayu]], optional)
:{{A|vo schjeq003 2 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' ...Hm, don't you think this puzzle is a bit too complicated? If we make this small adjustment... it'd be a lot easier to understand, don't you think?
:{{A|vo schjeq003 2 sayu 01.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Y&mdash;You're right! I never thought about it that way...
:'''Yoimiya:''' Nice one, Ayaka! I knew you'd be a great addition to the team!
:{{A|vo schjeq003 2 ayaka 02.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Oh, no, no! You two did all the hard work! You made it easy for me...
:{{DIcon}} Hello.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 2 ayaka 03.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Oh... When did you get here...
:{{A|vo schjeq003 2 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Just now! Seems like you're a natural, Ayaka! A real game developer at heart, huh...
:{{DIcon}} You talked about wanting to create a game the day before yesterday...
:{{A|vo schjeq003 2 ayaka 04.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Oh... You remember that. Well, brother had everything covered. So, I asked Yoimiya if she could use a hand...
:{{A|vo schjeq003 2 ayaka 05.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' I'm just glad I didn't turn out to be an inconvenience.
:'''Yoimiya:''' An inconvenience? We were in such a jam! You saved us!
:{{A|vo schjeq003 2 kichiboushi 01.ogg}} '''"Kichiboushi":''' In a jam... because jam is sticky, and we got stuck!
:{{A|vo schjeq003 2 sayu 02.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Not that kind of jam... But, it doesn't matter. We just need to get this done.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 2 ayaka 06.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' {{Traveler}}, Lady Guuji told me about the upcoming battle. As I understand it, this is an extremely dangerous endeavor, and the rest of us can only help from the sidelines...
:{{A|vo schjeq003 2 ayaka 07.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' Our thoughts and prayers are with you... Be careful!

;(Talk to Ayaka, Yoimiya, or Sayu again, optional)
:'''Yoimiya:''' Alright! {{Traveler}}'s got the hard stuff covered, so let's give this our all!
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 ayaka 01.ogg}} '''Kamisato Ayaka:''' How did you sleep last night, Sayu? Do you need a break?
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 sayu 01.ogg}} '''Sayu:''' Hmm... I think I can push through, just this once... I'm sure I'll still get taller!
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 kichiboushi 01.ogg}} '''"Kichiboushi":''' Great Mujina [[Youkai]]... Good luck!

;(Talk to [[Sangonomiya Kokomi]] or [[Gorou]], optional)
:{{A|vo schjeq003 4 koutoku 01.ogg}} '''Koutoku:''' Ah, captain! [[Watatsumi Army|Swordfish II]], salute!
:{{DIcon}} Wow, it's been a while...
:'''Gorou:''' I'll say! The squad was a little reluctant to help at first... But, telling them you were the festival representative had them moving faster than an actual swordfish!
:{{A|vo schjeq003 4 koutoku 02.ogg}} '''Koutoku:''' ...To be honest, some [[Watatsumi Island]]ers aren't too concerned about the festival, or the safety of [[Narukami Island]].
:{{A|vo schjeq003 4 yoshihisa 01.ogg}} '''Yoshihisa:''' ...But, if they knew it was for the captain of Swordfish II, I'm confident everyone would be here in a heartbeat.
:{{DIcon}} I'm not sure I deserve that level of loyalty...
:'''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' I doubt you have a choice at this point, {{Traveler}}.
:'''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Not even the words of a Divine Priestess are enough to convince the people of Watatsumi and Narukami Islands to let go of the past.
:'''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' It takes time, communication... and, most importantly, the help of very special people.
:'''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Your representation at this festival, and my collaboration with [[Mizuki]] will serve as bridges between Watatsumi Island and the outside world.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 4 mizuki 01.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Huh, I never considered that angle... You possess wisdom beyond your years, Kokomi &mdash; on par with a certain other shrine maiden I know.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 4 paimon 01.ogg}} '''Paimon:''' Mizuki! Uh... Did you get any sleep at all?
:{{A|vo schjeq003 4 mizuki 02.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' I'm fine. Sometimes, you need to push past your mental limits to unleash your full potential... I've seen that many times in my line of work.
:{{DIcon}} So, that's a no, then...
:{{DIcon}} Get a good night's sleep once this is all over.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 4 mizuki 03.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' I will. The good news is, the ritual is all set. That means the festival can proceed, and we can focus on realizing our vision.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 4 mizuki 04.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' As for the more pressing matter, once the Nightmare Fragment appears, we will begin the ritual. But, it needs time to take effect.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 4 mizuki 05.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' You and the Shogun are the only ones who can subdue the enemy until then... Do you remember what I told you yesterday, before you left for [[Aisa Bathhouse]]?
:;(A flashback begins)
:{{A|vo schjeq003 4 mizuki 06.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Humans, youkai, and [[archon]]s bear the same capacity for emotion and are, naturally, susceptible to the same mental turmoil.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 4 mizuki 07.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' It's very possible that someone who appears strong on the outside has learned to compartmentalize their negative emotions... And that is far from healthy.
:;(Flashback ends)
:{{DIcon}} I remember.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 4 mizuki 08.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Good. I trust you won't let the Shogun shoulder this alone... not anymore.

;(Talk to Kokomi, Gorou, or Yumemizuki Mizuki again, optional)
:'''Gorou:''' Oh, I wanted to ask... Do you know what this strip of paper is for?
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 mizuki 01.ogg}} '''Yumemizuki Mizuki:''' Oh, Miko wrote that. She can explain it better than me... Why don't you ask her?
:'''Gorou:''' I... I think I'll ask someone else!
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 gyoubukoban 01.ogg}} '''"Gyoubu Koban":''' Big dog... is afraid?
:'''Sangonomiya Kokomi:''' Let's see... "God of Thunder, heed our call"...

;(Talk to Ei)
:{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 raidenei 01.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Ah, it's you. Before battle, it is imperative to calm the mind. If you have unfinished business, see to that now.
:{{DIcon}} I'm set.
::{{A|vo dialog schjeq003 raidenei 02.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Then, come meditate with me.

:{{DIcon}} You seem... unsettled.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 6 raidenei 02.ogg}} '''Ei:''' ...Since leaving the [[Plane of Euthymia]], I seem to experience this feeling more and more, whether in the markets of Inazuma or before the [[Sacred Sakura]]...
:{{DIcon}} I seem to have a hand in a lot of those... I'm sorry.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 6 raidenei 03.ogg}} '''Ei:''' No, it may not be a bad thing. In the Plane of Euthymia, I could not perceive the consequences of my choices, but that did not preclude their impact.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 6 raidenei 04.ogg}} '''Ei:''' It is only natural that I would feel their effect one day. Even a god cannot sever the link between cause and effect.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 6 raidenei 05.ogg}} '''Ei:''' I have come to realize that isolating oneself from all engagement... is no way to reach a true state of "euthymia."
:{{DIcon}} ...
:{{A|vo schjeq003 6 raidenei 06.ogg}} '''Ei:''' I will not unleash [[Musou no Hitotachi]] this time. I can only support you in the battle ahead.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 6 raidenei 07.ogg}} '''Ei:''' Using illusion against illusion, dream against nightmare... The ultimate success of this plan comes down to you, {{Traveler}}.
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' (This is a last-minute plan, we don't exactly know what we're about to face, and it could all fall through at a moment's notice... But, one thing is for sure.)
:'''{{Traveler}}:''' ...This time, you will not face her alone.
:;(Time passes until around sunset)

:{{A|vo schjeq003 9 yaemiko 06.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Heh, the whole purpose of the investigation was to avoid disturbing youkai territory.
:{{A|vo schjeq003 9 yaemiko 07.ogg}} '''Yae Miko:''' Besides, the world is a big place. Humans, youkai... There's more than enough room for all of us.
