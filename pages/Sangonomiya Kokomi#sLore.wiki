==Personality==
{{Quote|The Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island. All of the island's affairs are at this young lady's fingertips.|In-game character attributes and profile page text}}

As the Divine Priestess of [[Watatsumi Island]], Kokomi handles almost all of the affairs on the island herself. While she is not content with such a burden, having preferred to be a military advisor, she nonetheless takes the mantle to give her people the hope and happiness they deserve. Like [[Jean]], Kokomi easily burns herself out completing her tasks and tries to keep it hidden from others to avoid worrying them.

Along with handling all sorts of affairs, Kokomi is a skilled strategist that thinks of all potential scenarios and how to handle them as a result of reading plenty of military books, although she also enjoys casual reading. [[Kujou Sara]] remarks that her planning prevented the [[Tenryou Commission]] from claiming full victory over the [[Watatsumi Army]]. She continues this habit even outside of military affairs. As a result of the role she plays, she is universally beloved by her people.

==Appearance==
<!-- Keep appearance section short and concise. Limit to 3 paragraphs with 3-4 sentences each. -->
Kokomi is a young woman with long, pale salmon pink hair styled in a high ponytail divided in two at the top. Her hair is accessorized with an indigo ornament that resembles fins, each side curving around the top of her ponytail. She has light indigo eyes with no pupil, and a large white highlight at the top of her iris.

Her attire consists of an off-the-shoulder navy-blue kimono-like coat with paler blue swirling accents that resemble waves at the bottom of her ''tamoto'' sleeves. She wears a low cut white-lilac bodysuit under her coat ending with shorts with a scalloped hem. Attached on her chest is a large indigo bow with her [[Hydro]] [[Vision]] mounted at the center alongside two purple ribbons.

Her footwear consists of ''geta'' sandals. Her accessories consist of white-lilac half gloves with scalloped edges and a navy-blue and light lilac choker with turquoise gemstones hanging from the bottom.

|title=Victory Through Wisdom}}
{{Quote|Her Excellency, Sangonomiya, is an astute strategist. She can accurately predict enemy movements from thousands of miles of way. When we fought against the Shogun's army, what we lacked in manpower and weaponry, we more than made up for with Her Excellency's tactical prowess. Were it not for Her Excellency, not a single one of Watatsumi Island's victories would have been possible.|[[Gorou]]}}

The Divine Priestess and supreme leader of Watatsumi Island{{sic}}

Many believe Sangonomiya Kokomi to be an enigmatic, shrewd leader. However, she always has a quiet smile on her face, and while she gets things done in an orderly fashion, she will sometimes do so over laughter and light conversation.

Having read many military treatises from all over [[Teyvat]] since she was a child, Kokomi has a talent for strategy and is capable of outwitting opponents through clever stratagems. Although Watatsumi Island lacks manpower and {{not a typo|materiel}}, its people have managed to turn the tide of battle many times thanks to Kokomi's tactical prowess. Whether in battle, trade, diplomacy, or internal affairs, Kokomi will do her best. Her achievements have won her the respect of Watatsumi Island's various factions.

"Never fear, Her Excellency Sangonomiya is here," has become a popular saying amongst the people of Watatsumi Island.

However, few people know that Kokomi's biggest aspiration has always been to merely be an adviser behind the scenes. Socializing with others is in fact a most tiring task for her. Her hands shake every time she gives a speech, and she entertains thoughts of retreating into herself every time work starts piling up. She enjoys herself most while holed up at home after finishing her work, face buried in her military strategy books.

To reach a lofty post at such a young age is considered a great achievement, but for Kokomi, the higher up one is on the mountain, the more treacherous the path.

The Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island.<br />
All of the island's affairs are at this young lady's fingertips.

The desire to protect Watatsumi Island lives on in the bloodline of the [[Sangonomiya Clan]]. The current heir to this bloodline is known as the Divine Priestess. The meaning behind this is as such: to inherit the will of a [[Orobashi|god]] in a mortal's body, and to defend this land and its people in that god's stead.

==Trivia==
* Kokomi is the first character to have a negative CRIT Rate by default. As such, she cannot deal CRIT DMG without artifacts to bring this value to positive.
* Sangonomiya Kokomi is known by these aliases or titles:
** Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island
** Her Excellency
** Sole of the Deep (pen name)
* Kokomi can be seen reading one of the volumes of the Inazuman book collection [[A Legend of Sword]] during one of her [[Sangonomiya Kokomi/Media#Idle Animations|idle animations]]. It also seems from one of her voice lines that she is a big fan of the series.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Sangonomiya Kokomi|About Sangonomiya Kokomi: Relaxing}}</ref>

===Etymology===
* Sangonomiya Kokomi, like other Inazuman characters with their full names listed, is arranged in the traditional Japanese order of surname listed before given name. {{Lang|Sangonomiya|ja=珊瑚宮}} means "coral shrine," and {{Lang|Kokomi|ja=心海}} literally means "mind sea," which compares the beating of the heart with the rippling of the sea.
** The character {{Lang|mini=1|ja=心}} refers to an abstract term that describes human conscience or emotion in a spiritual sense, but is usually translated as "heart," "soul," or "mind." In Kokomi's case, this may reflect her cunning and strategical prowess, as well as how she represents the people of Watatsumi Island.
* In the Japanese Translation, Her title of "Divine Priestess" (Japanese: 神の巫女) uses part of the same Kanji as Arahitogami (Japanese: 現人神). Arahitogami's are a deity/god who has taken a human form.
* Kokomi's constellation name, {{Lang|Dracaena Somnolenta|zh=眠龙座|zh_rm=Miánlóng-zuò|zh_tl=Sleeping Dragon Constellation|ja=睡竜座|ja_rm=Suiryou-za<!-- assumed reading; it may be "Suiryuu-za" using the modern reading of 竜-->|ja_tl=Sleeping Dragon Constellation|sort=zh,ja}}, is likely a reference to the Chinese politician {{w|Zhuge Liang}} (181–234 AD), who was known for being a great military strategist and was nicknamed {{Lang|"Hidden Dragon"|zh=伏龙|zh_rm=Fúlóng|ja=伏龍|ja_rm=Fukuryou|sort=zh,ja}} or {{Lang|"Crouching Dragon"|zh=卧龙|zh_rm=Wòlóng|ja=臥龍|ja_rm=Garyou|sort=zh,ja}}.
