==Trivia==
* The canonicity of playable characters' preferences during Spices From the West is questionable.
** Although Ganyu and her Character Stories say she is {{w|vegetarian}}, she also declines meatless dishes that include [[Bird Egg]]s or [[Milk]], such as [[Fragrant Almond Tofu]], [[Fragrant Satisfying Salad]], and [[Fragrant Fisherman's Toast]]. This would make her {{w|vegan}}, and she does decline vegetable fritters that have been fried in animal fat outside of this event.<ref>{{Ref/VO|Ganyu|Least Favorite Food}}</ref> However, in the corresponding voice-over for this event (Receiving a Gift: III), Ganyu declines solely on the basis of the dish containing meat, which does not make sense when she declines meatless dishes.
** [[Zhongli]] politely declines all seafood, including [[Fragrant Grilled Tiger Fish]] and [[Fragrant Mondstadt Grilled Fish]], but his Character Story [[Zhongli/Lore#That Which Rises From the Sea|''That Which Rises From the Sea'']] indicates that he only dislikes tentacled seafood and will happily eat even tentacled seafood that has been cut into small pieces. Zhongli's [[Zhongli/Lore#Character Story 1|''Character Story 1'']] also heavily implies that he has eaten [[Fullmoon Egg]], which uses both cut and whole [[Shrimp]]. It therefore does not make sense that Zhongli declines even Grilled Tiger Fish and Mondstadt Grilled Fish, which are small portions<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Bottomless Appetite}}</ref> of cut fish.
