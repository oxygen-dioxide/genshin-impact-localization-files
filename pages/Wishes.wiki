'''Wishes''' are the {{w|Gacha game|gacha}} system in ''[[Genshin Impact]]''. There are two main types of Wishes: the permanent Standard Wish, [[Wanderlust Invocation]], and limited-time Event Wishes for [[Characters]] and [[Weapons]].

Players can unlock wishes after completing the [[Archon Quest]] [[Prologue]], Act I: [[The Outlander Who Caught the Wind]] - [[Knights of Favonius (Quest)|Knights of Favonius]], which players can reach at around [[Adventure Rank]] 5.

==Types==
* [[Character Event Wish]]
* [[Character Event Wish-2]]
* [[Weapon Event Wish]]
* [[Novice Wish]]
* [[Standard Wish]]

==Availability==
[[File:Item Acquaint Fate.png|right|100px|thumb|[[Acquaint Fate]]]]
The "Standard Wish", [[Wanderlust Invocation]], is always available and requires [[Acquaint Fate]] to wish from it. The [[Beginners' Wish]] is available indefinitely until all 20 wishes are made, has a 20% discount on the Acquaint Fate required to wish, and guarantees the player receives [[Noelle]] and one other 4 or 5-star character within the 20 wishes.

[[File:Item Intertwined Fate.png|right|100px|thumb|[[Intertwined Fate]]]]
Limited-time Event Wishes are split into two wishes, one for characters and one for weapons, and as the name implies, they are only available for a limited time. Event Wishes require [[Intertwined Fate]]s instead of Acquaint Fates.

Character Event Wishes have one promotional 5{{star}} character and three featured 4{{star}} characters. Weapon Event Wishes will have two promotional 5{{star}} weapons and five 4{{star}} featured weapons. Both the promotional 5{{star}} and featured 4{{star}} items will have an increased probability for players to wish them when compared to the basic rates when the guarantees are factored in.

Players can buy either of the Fates for 160 [[Primogem]]s each in the Wishes menu or through [[Paimon's Bargains]]. There are also in-game methods of obtaining Fates; see their respective pages for more information.

[[File:Item Masterless Starglitter.png|right|100px|thumb|[[Masterless Starglitter]]]]

==Trivia==
*The 1.6% '''''consolidated rate, with guarantees''''' on the Event Character wish is equivalent to one 5{{star}} character per 62.5 wishes, or exactly 10,000 [[Primogem]]s.
*The {{w|Expected value|expected rarity}} (computed from average rates) is 3.162{{star}} for the character banner and 3.182{{star}} for the weapon banner. This means, that with infinitely many pulls, it is expected on average to get a 3.162{{star}} item on the character banner and a 3.182{{star}} item on the weapon banner.
*Because the 50:50 guarantee on Character Event Wishes only applies to the featured character, the actual average percentage of featured characters from 5{{star}} drops is 66.6% or two thirds overall. This is derived in the article [[Markov Chain]].

==Frequently Asked Questions==
{{Community|section|The terms "pity" and "banner" and all related terms, such as "soft pity," are unofficial. The existence of soft pity and when it begins are both determined from player testing.}}
# Do the standard, character, and weapon event wishes each have separate pity?
#:'''Yes.  (Note: [https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Character_Event_Wishes#Character_Event_Wish-2 Character Event Wish-2] shares pity with the main character banner)'''
# Does pity carry over on a new banner within the same character or weapon event wishes?
#:'''Yes, pity built up in the previous banner will be used in the new banner.'''
# Do Fate Points carry over on a new banner within the weapon event?
#:'''No, Fate Points are reset in every new banner.'''
# Does obtaining a 5★ item before 80 or 90 wishes guarantee another 5★ item at the 80th or 90th wish?
#:'''No, the pity counter is reset whenever any 5★ (character or weapon) is obtained. The hard pity is guaranteed if and only if no 5★ items have been rolled in the last 80 or 90 wishes, counting from the most recently obtained 5★ item.'''
# Is the 50/50 or 75/25 shared between character or weapon event wishes?
#:'''No, since their pities are separate, their guarantees are as well.'''
# Does losing the 50/50 or 75/25 guarantee the next 5★ win to be the featured item in the banner?
#:'''Yes.'''
# Does winning the 50/50 or 75/25 guarantee the next 5★ win to be the featured item in the banner?
#:'''No, the next 5★ will be a 50/50 or 75/25.'''
# Does winning one of the 5★ featured weapons in the weapon event guarantee the next 5★ to be the other 5★ featured weapon?
#:'''No, the next 5★ can be either of the 2 featured weapons or a non-featured one.'''
# When does soft pity for the banners start?
#:'''Soft pity for the character and standard banners start at approximately the 74th wish and the weapon banner approximately starts at the 63rd wish.<ref>Reddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/o9v0c0/soft_and_hard_pity_explained_based_on_24m_wishes/ Soft and hard pity explained based on 24M wishes]</ref><ref group="Note">It is important to note that the data gathered from wishes describe <u>long-term averages</u> and do not suggest the existence of soft pity on their own. For soft pity to exist, the probabilities on a given pull must be equal to the exact proportions observed by distributions. As long as the specific algorithm used to determine outcomes remains secret, any model which, with infinite pulls, results in the advertised rates and which fits the data can be considered a valid model.</ref>'''
