==Profile==
<!--Detailed story/lore information goes here.-->
She is one of the five Fruity Order Operatives. She is a formidable assassin and a high-ranking member, as the boss does not investigate matters that she personally deals with regardless of the outcome. Rumor has it that wherever Bulle Fruit goes, she will catch him and either "cut him in half or skin him alive". After he betrays the order, the higher-ups send her to eliminate him. She investigates his betrayal and discovers that he had taken in an orphan named [[Blanche (Fontaine)|Blanche]] and did everything for her sake. When she finally confronts him, he accepts his punishment, though his former colleagues [["Trendy Zaytun Peach"]] and [["Guileless Wolfhook"]] come to his defense. In the ensuing fight, she holds back out of mercy and allows herself to be defeated by the Traveler and the others. Before she leaves, Blanche, knowing that her adoptive brother did everything for her sake, hands her a copy of the [["Pure Water"]] formula as an apology, which she accepts. Before she leaves, she tells Blanche to listen to what her brother tells her.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Villains}}</ref>
