|description    = A mask shaped like a feathered crown that you can find being sold at [[Chuwen Fair]] in the [[Stadium of the Sacred Flame]]. The mask's feathers are reminiscent of wings ready to strike. It is said that a wise warrior will hold their spear tight at all times and marshal their strength, such that a critical blow may be unleashed upon their foes when their guard is down.
