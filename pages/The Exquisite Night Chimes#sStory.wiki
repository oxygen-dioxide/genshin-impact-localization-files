==Festive Anecdotes==
===Part I: A Thousand Miles for an Enigmatic Tune===
{{Main|A Thousand Miles for an Enigmatic Tune}}
Arriving at [[Liyue Harbor]] to celebrate yet another [[Lantern Rite]], the [[Traveler]] and [[Paimon]] initially decide to visit [[Xiangling]] first when they run into [[Zhongli]] at his usual spot, the [[Third-Round Knockout]]. Zhongli greets them and senses the growth they made from their last encounter before telling them that he was going to go to the forests of [[Qingce Village]] to pick some [[Nascent Bamboo Shoots]] to make soup with. However, he instead pushes this task to them instead.

Heading to the bamboo forests, they hear someone yelling for help when a girl comes and rescues the person, later revealed to be [[Dvorak]] and [[Yaoyao]] respectively. Dvorak states that he had visited [[Mondstadt]] and was guided by the winds to [[Liyue]], having wanted to recreate the steps needed to find the mysterious woman that had saved his ancestor years ago. Yaoyao decides to go to [[Ganyu]] and the [[Liyue Qixing]] for help. As they arrive, they run into [[Xinyan]], who learns that Dvorak had come for personal reasons, not to host the [[Iridescence Tour]]. However, Yaoyao believes that [[Keqing]] and [[Ningguang]] could help arrange the concert. On the way, they stop by [[Madame Ping]], who supports the idea of a concert.

Meeting up with Ganyu, she manages to arrange a meeting to help plan the concert. She then learns why Dvorak came and while confirming that the [[adeptus|adepti]] are very much real, there are others that could help him with his problem. A few days later, Keqing meets Dvorak and makes plans to set the concert while [[Baiwen]] informs her of a developing situation near [[Qingxu Pool]]. The Traveler volunteers to help; when they arrive, they meet up with [[Yelan]], who was also investigating the incident. Taking a look around, Yelan manages to find tracks leading to a [[Treasure Hoarder]] named [[Fujing]], who she easily defeats. Fujing confesses to the crime, having used the melody he had heard in his childhood to steal from others, who had believed it to be a warning sign that bandits were coming. 

Returning to [[Yujing Terrace]], Baiwen fetches [[Ningguang]] who tells them that this year's Lantern Rite is based off of [[Sea Gazer]] and wishes them luck on their journey, having heard it from the others.

===Part II: A Single Harmony for an Irreplaceable Soul===
{{Main|A Single Harmony for an Irreplaceable Soul}}
A few days later, the Traveler and Paimon meet up with Ganyu, who decides that they should ask [[Cloud Retainer]] if they knew who the person Dvorak sought was. When they arrive at [[Mt. Aocang]], they do not find her, so Paimon improvises a plan that involves the Traveler pretending to [[Fallen Character#Out of Bounds and Drowning|drowning]], but this instead gets [[Xiao]] and [[Shenhe]]'s attention. Xiao tells them that the person they sought wasn't a yaskha before warping away. Shenhe learns why they visited and informs them that Cloud Retainer had left for [[Mt. Hulao]], so Ganyu goes off to leave their gift behind before returning. Believing what she thinks is "music", they head to her cultivation site before Paimon clarifies what music actually meant.

Cloud Retainer then arrives and learns the reason why they visited. As Shenhe stays behind to continue her training, she takes them to [[Guili Plains]] and explains about the history of [[Guizhong]] to the Traveler and Paimon. Guizhong would frequently argue with Streetward Rambler, who Paimon recognizes as Ping. However, Guizhong died during the [[Archon War]]s, thus she and Ping have avoided coming to Guili Plains as it evokes sorrow. She then reveals that Ping was the one who saved Dvorak's ancestor before they depart for Liyue Harbor.

Once they arrive, Cloud Retainer and Ping have a brief talk about Guizhong and express regret towards her death, though she has since moved on. Ping asks them to give her regards to Dvorak, where they tell him about the story. Dvorak is surprised and humbled by the truth before Paimon remembers about the bamboo shoots they were supposed to bring Zhongli, so they head to [[Wangsheng Funeral Parlor]]. Instead, they find [[Hu Tao]], [[Yun Jin]] and Xinyan there, who were rehearsing for the opening act. Hu Tao tells them that Zhongli had left to visit old friends, so they head to Mt. Hulao and find him with [[Moon Carver]] and [[Mountain Shaper]], where they give him the bamboo shoots and he gives them some piping hot bamboo soup before telling them to return to the harbor.

Back at the harbor, the Lantern Rite goes off without any issue as the opening act begins and Dvorak concludes the rest of the concert.

===Epilogue===
{{Main|Between Facades and Familiar Faces}}

Remembering Hu Tao's invitation, the Traveler and Paimon head to [[Xinyue Kiosk]] to have a get-together. When they arrive, they Xiangling, [[Xingqiu]] and [[Chongyun]]. Zhongli and Hu Tao arrive, who had also brought Xiao along. While the atmosphere is initially tense at first due to Xiao's nervousness, Hu Tao manages to lighten the mood just as [[Venti]] inexplicably appears. After finishing up the meal, the Traveler takes Xiao outside to calm his nerves before coming back in. The group decides to pick someone as the distinguished guest and eventually decide on Paimon. 

After finishing up dessert, Hu Tao accompanies Xingqiu, Xiangling and Chongyun back to their homes while Zhongli and Venti leave by themselves. Xiao thanks the Traveler for helping him through a sudden event before he too leaves.

==HoYoLAB Battle Chronicle==
===A Thousand Miles for an Enigmatic Tune===
On {{color|help|MM/DD/YYYY}}, {{color|help|HH:MM}}, you met Yaoyao and Dvorak, a musician from Fontaine, and went with them to Liyue Harbor to help the latter search for the descendants of an adeptus.

On {{color|help|MM/DD/YYYY}}, {{color|help|HH:MM}}, you and your friends got involved in the preparation plan for Liyue's Lantern Rite performance. The Iridescence Tour: Lantern Rite special performance is about to begin!

On {{color|help|MM/DD/YYYY}}, {{color|help|HH:MM}}, you bumped into Yelan at the Sea of Clouds, and helped her investigate clues regarding the strange melody. As always, you feel safe around her...

===A Single Harmony for an Irreplaceable Soul===
On {{color|help|MM/DD/YYYY}}, {{color|help|HH:MM}}, you went with Ganyu to Mt. Aocang searching for clues regarding the descendants of an adeptus, but "accidentally" fell into the water, only to be saved by Shenhe and Xiao. Another win for Paimon, hehe...

On {{color|help|MM/DD/YYYY}}, {{color|help|HH:MM}}, you listened to Cloud Retainer's story about the adeptus. Though the strings that played that melody survive, the one who inspired it is gone. A deep yearning that transcends time and space manifests itself through this song.

On {{color|help|MM/DD/YYYY}}, {{color|help|HH:MM}},  you and your friends enjoyed the lively atmosphere of the musical concert together. At this moment, friendships grow as great as the mountains and the oceans, and fireworks illuminate the night sky till dawn arrives. As the sun sets and the moon rises, may we be blessed with peace, happiness, and harmony.

===Between Facades and Familiar Faces===
On {{color|help|MM/DD/YYYY}}, {{color|help|HH:MM}}, you met Hu Tao at the appointed hour for dinner at Xinyue Kiosk. A little get-together between family and friends is a good opportunity to bid farewell to the past year and to welcome the new year.

On {{color|help|MM/DD/YYYY}}, {{color|help|HH:MM}}, you ate and drank your fill. With the feast coming to a close, you bid your friends farewell and embarked on a new journey.

What mysteries await us in the next chapter of the story...
