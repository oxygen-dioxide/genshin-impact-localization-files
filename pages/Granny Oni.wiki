==Profile==
{{Quote|"Why did you save me? Can't you see that I'm an oni?" "You must be hungry. Come, I've made some porridge."<br>"I told you, I'm an oni! Can't you see them horns?" "Oh, I can see them. Do you want some of that porridge, by the way?"<br>"Agh, you know what, you're not listening to me at all. Oh, alright... One bowl of porridge, please." "Coming right up."}}
Despite her name, Granny Oni is not actually an [[oni]]; this was a nickname given to her as a result of her taking in [[Arataki Itto]] in his youth, as people continued to discriminate against oni. After Itto's parents died, he was left on the streets and tore into people who spoke ill of the oni; this resulted in him being beaten by a group of ruffians who had banded together at one point, but Granny Oni saved him.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Arataki Itto|5}}</ref> She has since taken care of him as if he was her own son.

During Itto's Story Quest, Granny Oni helped take care of [[Daisuke]] after his parents had been kidnapped by ronin. When the Traveler returned with news of Itto's arrest and the revelation of a blue oni tribe, Granny Oni immediately began making preparations to help the secluded oni, who had been living in neglect.

===Appearance===
Granny Oni is a bespectacled elderly lady with her gray hair parted in the middle. She wears a brown striped apron dress over a gray nagagi.
