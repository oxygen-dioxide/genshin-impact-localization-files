{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Before completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:'''Kouichi:''' Midori, Midori. Let's talk about the Outside World again!
:'''Midori:''' Hehe, again? Really now...
:'''Midori:''' Since you're so eager to hear about it, Let me tell you something new then! So, what do you want to know?
:'''Kouichi:''' What is that place called [[Liyue]] on the other side of the ocean like?
:'''Midori:''' Liyue is super famous for its rocks. You know that too, right?
:'''Midori:''' But you definitely don't know that those rocks from Liyue are actually little animals. They can run, yell, and jump!
:'''Kouichi:''' Wow! That's so cool... What about Fontaine?
:'''Midori:''' The roads of [[Fontaine]] are all built in mid-air. The [[The Miraculous Antoine Roger Aircraft|wagons]] that people ride fly like egrets. It only takes a short while to get from one side of the village to another!
:'''Kouichi:''' Wow! What... what about [[Sumeru]]?
:'''Midori:''' The Sumeru locals have it more difficult. There are grass all over the ground after all.
:'''Midori:''' They eat and drink grass. There are no [[Egg Roll]]s, no [[Tricolor Dango|Dango]].
:'''Kouichi:''' Poor Sumeru...
:'''Kouichi:''' If only I could get out of here. I would probably be on the other side of the sea already...
:'''Kouichi:''' Ugh, rocky animals, flying wagons, please wait for me...

;(After completing [[Transient Dreams]])
:'''Kouichi:''' Midori, Midori. Let's talk about the Outside World again!
:'''Midori:''' Well, well! Who do we have here? But since you're so eager to hear about it, Let me tell you something new then! So, what do you want to know?
:'''Kouichi:''' What is that place called Liyue on the other side of the ocean like?
:'''Midori:''' Liyue is super famous for its rocks. You know that too, right?
:'''Midori:''' But you definitely don't know that those rocks from Liyue are actually little animals. They can run, yell, and jump!

:'''Midori:''' They eat and drink grass. There are no Egg Rolls, no Dango.
:'''Kouichi:''' Poor Sumeru...
:'''Kouichi:''' If it weren't for my parents not letting me, I would probably be on the other side of the sea already...
:'''Kouichi:''' Ugh, rocky animals, flying wagons, please wait for me...
