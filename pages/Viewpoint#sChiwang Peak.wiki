|text    = In the long-forgotten mists of time, the ancestors of Chenyu Vale named this place the "Hanging Garden." Once-prosperous realms became divided into many tribes, and the tribes would later again unite into a prosperous realm, but the spirit veins of Chenyu Vale are as they ever were, gathering faithfully in this place.
