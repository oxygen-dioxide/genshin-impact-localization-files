'''Stamina''' is a resource/attribute that is used in various combat and movement techniques like [[Sprinting]] (or Dodging), [[Climbing]], [[Swimming]], [[Gliding]], and [[Charged Attack]]s. After not performing any of these actions for 1.5 seconds, Stamina will naturally regenerate at a rate of 25 Stamina per second. The Stamina meter is displayed as a yellow bar to the right of the character in the center of the screen when either depleting or recharging and will automatically hide itself when fully charged. Visually the meter is divided into sections, each representing 100 Stamina each.

It is important to note that Stamina is a shared pool for the entire party and not tracked separately for each member like HP. Therefore, switching characters when running low will not result in any changes.

Various characters' passive talents and food items can help decrease the consumption of Stamina in conditional situations, such as [[Kaeya]]'s [[Hidden Strength]] (Sprinting Stamina consumption reduction) or [[Amber]]'s [[Gliding Champion]] (Gliding Stamina consumption reduction).

==Maximum Stamina==
The player starts with 100 base Stamina. Each [[Statue of The Seven]] upgrade in [[Mondstadt]] and [[Liyue]] raises maximum Stamina by 7 for the first and second upgrade, and then 8 for the seven remaining upgrades for a total of 70 additional Stamina by Level 10.

The maximum possible Stamina is 240 (70 from Mondstadt's Statues of the Seven and 70 from Liyue's Statues of the Seven).

==Stamina Consumption Reduction==
===Elemental Resonance===
The {{Element|Anemo|24}} [[Impetuous Winds]] Elemental Resonance decreases stamina consumption by 15%.

===Talents===
Certain characters have [[Talents]] that modify Stamina consumption.

===Food===
* Eating a second dish will override the effects of the first dish i.e. they do not stack.
* Food that decreases sprinting Stamina affects both dash and sprint.

==Stamina Consumption Reduction Calculation==
Different sources of stamina consumption reduction will stack additively.

::<math>\text{Stamina Consumption} = \text{Base Stamina Consumption} \times (1 - \text{Stamina Consumption Reduction}</math><math> - \text{Additional Stamina Consumption Reduction} - \text{Additional Stamina Consumption Reduction} - \text{...})</math>

For example, if the party is under the effects of [[Impetuous Winds]] (-15%), [[Wolvensprint]] (-20%), and Delicious [[Barbatos Ratatouille]] (-25%), the sprinting consumption, which is normally 18 Stamina per second, will decrease to (18 Stamina per second) × (1 - 0.15 - 0.20 - 0.25) = (18 Stamina per second) × (1 - 0.6) = ''7.2 Stamina per second''.
