{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Ipora:''' This temperature is still the best...
:{{DIcon}} Not afraid of scalding yourself?
::'''Ipora:''' Hah, what are you talking about? I wouldn't be here if I was afraid of the heat!
::'''Ipora:''' See those Koholasaurs? They should give you an idea of how hot these pools are.
::'''Ipora:''' But really, I think it's great that you can soak in the pool and socialize with Koholasaurs while you're at it.
::'''Ipora:''' Oh, and [[Shirahama|this guy from Inazuma]] taught me how to make hot spring eggs. So now, I've even got some snacks.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Take care of yourself.
::'''Ipora:''' Got it. I'll soak for a while longer then head back.
::'''Ipora:''' Phew... This almost feels like I'm melting from the inside out.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Teachings of Kindling|20|x=3}})
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Ipora:''' Bye-bye! Be careful not to get scalded by the hot water!
