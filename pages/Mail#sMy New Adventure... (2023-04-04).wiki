|text      = Hey friend, it's been a while. How have your travels been?

I just finished taking some of those huge machines apart and started resting in my camp when I realized that today's my birthday.

Since I'm not familiar with anyone else in this world, I guess you're the only one who can wish me a happy birthday.

By the way, I just found a new job as an Adventurer with the [[Adventurers' Guild]].

I was only given a few trivial tasks at first, but after seeing me disassemble three [[Ruin Guard]]s right before their eyes, they seemed to have recognized my skills and began to entrust me with more interesting commissions.

Hehe, my [[bow]]s and arrows speak for themselves.

Oh, I collected quite a lot of [[Humanoid Ruin Machine Material|mechanical parts]] from that flying [[Ruin Hunter]]. These are for you.

Let's talk about all the things we've seen on our adventures the next time we meet.
