{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Approach The Steambird)
:'''Paimon:''' Eek... It sounds like there's some kind of argument going on, y'know, in the direction of the Steambird's office. Should we take a look?

;(Get closer to The Steambird)
:'''Paimon:''' A [[Melusine]] from the [[Marechaussee Phantom]]... Has something happened at the office?

;(Approach the Melusine)
:'''Talochard:''' What kind of attitude is that, Editor [[Jenck]]!?
:'''Jenck:''' And what about your attitude, Agent [[Talochard]]?
:'''Talochard:''' I'm helping you with a problem here!
:'''Jenck:''' And did I ask for your help?
:{{DIcon}} What are you two arguing about?
:'''Talochard:''' What good timing. Help me explain. I'm Agent Talochard from the Marechaussee Phantom, investigating a case at The Steambird.
:'''Talochard:''' But this amateur keeps interfering with my deductive process. I mean, just who is the investigator here?
:'''Paimon:''' Well, it is kinda odd for an amateur to advise a professional...
:'''Jenck:''' I was merely suggesting that she not jump to any conclusions. She's barely started investigating and she's already decided I'm the killer! It's defamation, I tell you!
:'''Paimon:''' It does sound like defamation... but it's important to find the... W&mdash;Wait! Killer? What happened?
:'''Talochard:''' Um... It's possible that an unfortunate newspaper employee has been... Y'know. Oh, it's so sad.
:'''Jenck:''' What do you mean by "y'know"? He's missing, that's all!
:'''Talochard:''' Even if he is just missing, you're still mixed up in this, and that's because you drove him away! Didn't you, Editor Jenck!
:'''Talochard:''' Let's paint the scene! An idealistic young reporter finally gets a job with the newspaper of his dreams. He yearns to fight the evils of society with the power of his pen.
:'''Talochard:''' But, to his dismay, he discovers the newspaper is as corrupt as everything else. Black of ink, black of heart!
:'''Talochard:''' Valuable stories are ignored in favor of puff pieces about popular music. His ideals are met with lies, his dignity trampled upon... Oh, it's such a sad story!
:'''Talochard:''' Until finally, one night, he awakes from a nightmare upon a tear-sodden pillow, and decides to flee the place that shattered his dreams.
:'''Jenck:''' What are you, an investigator or a bad novelist? You're cawing like a crow!
:'''Talochard:''' So, Editor Jenck, is this the truth behind his disappearance? You are his boss, are you not? Yet you deny all responsibility?
:'''Jenck:''' Agent Talochard, your imagination knows no bounds. May I suggest you hand in your badge and take up a job at our newspaper? We also publish fantastical stories, you see...
:'''Talochard:''' Fantastical? As if. My deductions are entirely plausible.
:{{DIcon}} Quite plausible indeed...
:{{DIcon}} Quite fantastical indeed...
:'''Jenck:''' Agent Talochard, let me clarify. The missing employee is Sir Arthur. Ring any bells?
:'''Paimon:''' Sir Arthur? Paimon's heard that name somewhere.
:'''Jenck:''' Sir Arthur is the steambird that gives The Steambird its name. Our symbol, our mascot.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh! That Sir Arthur. The one who stands by the door, announcing the news.
:'''Jenck:''' Yes. So, a steambird that can neither walk nor fly. I fail to see how I could have driven it away.
:'''Talochard:''' Wait, blast you! Shouldn't you have mentioned that before? Do you have something against me?
:'''Jenck:''' Look, you're the one who turned up and started accusing me of murder. If anyone has an axe to grind, it's you!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, do stop bickering. The important thing right now is to find Sir Arthur.
:;([[Euphrasie]] and a Gardemek walk up)
:'''Euphrasie:''' Yes, Paimon's right.
:'''Jenck:''' Ah, Editor-in-Chief Euphrasie, Agent [["Curve"|Curve]], you've returned.
:'''Euphrasie:''' Thank you for your help, Jenck. You may go now.
:;(Jenck nods and leaves)
:'''Paimon:''' Editor-in-Chief Euphrasie, hello! And who is this...
:'''Euphrasie:''' Hello, {{Traveler}} and Paimon. And this is...
:'''"Curve":''' Hello, all. I am merely Curve, Agent Talochard's assistant.
:'''Paimon:''' Y&mdash;You can talk!? Like Sir Arthur!?
:'''Euphrasie:''' No. Agent Curve is a special investigations drone belonging to the Marechaussee Phantom. He's remotely operated by someone back in the office. Isn't that the case, Agent Talochard?
:'''Talochard:''' Huh? Oh, yes. Yes, that's the case...
:{{DIcon}} I didn't know Fontaine had such advanced technology.
:'''Euphrasie:''' Heh. Well, unfortunately this isn't the time to bring you up to date on our advances, much as I would enjoy doing so. Right now, I need you both to help with getting Sir Arthur back.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? Us? You've already got two professional investigators...
:'''Talochard:''' Yeah! This is our case!
:'''Euphrasie:''' Ahem. The thing is, Agent Talochard, neither of you are official investigators with the Marechaussee Phantom, are you?
:'''Talochard:''' You... You watch what you say! This is a genuine uniform, I'll have you know!
:'''Euphrasie:''' But as I understand it, you were simply passing by and decided to start investigating of your own accord. I can't imagine why. I wonder if I should speak to the Marechaussee Phantom and&mdash;
:'''Talochard:''' No, no! There's no need. Okay, I admit it...
:'''Paimon:''' What!? You're impersonating Marechaussee Phantom agents?
:'''Euphrasie:''' Well, to be honest, they're just agents who are a bit special. In any case, I'm grateful to Agent Curve, who told me some very interesting things while we were interviewing the local residents.
:'''Talochard:''' Curve! What did you tell her?
:'''"Curve":''' As you know, Agent Talochard, the Mosso Protocols require me to answer all of Editor-in-Chief Euphrasie's questions honestly.
:'''Paimon:''' The Mosso Protocols? Is that some kind of customer service agreement?
:'''Talochard:''' Ugh, those pesky protocols!
:'''Euphrasie:''' I don't mean to offend, agents. But Sir Arthur is of great importance to The Steambird, and I would like to have more professionals on the case. {{Traveler}} and Paimon, for example.
:'''Paimon:''' You want us to join the investigation?
:'''Euphrasie:''' Indeed I do. And on behalf of The Steambird, I promise you will be rewarded. What do you think?
:{{DIcon}} We're in.
:'''Euphrasie:''' Excellent. I hope you will all work together. The newspaper will be most grateful.
:'''Talochard:''' Okay. Just don't tell the [[Maison Gardiennage|Maison]] that we're here on the sly...
:{{DIcon}} Wait, you're playing hooky?
:'''Talochard:''' Hey, let a girl have her secrets, why don't you? Maybe when I know you better...
:'''Talochard:''' Okay, Curve, if we're teaming up, we should show them our notes.
:'''"Curve":''' Please take these statements, which we took from nearby residents.
:'''Paimon:''' Ooh! Have you got any leads, then?
:'''Talochard:''' Of course. We're good at our jobs.
:'''Talochard:''' Okay, so next we should investigate the scene. Sir Arthur disappeared last night, so there should still be clues to be found!
:;(Obtain {{Item|Talochard's Investigation Notes}} &mdash; "Resident's Testimony (I)," "(II)," and "(III)" to the Case Record)
::'''Resident's Testimony (II)'''
::Testimony from a resident near The Steambird newspaper.
::"A drunken vagrant? Oh... I know him! That's Rocher... I've seen him near the docks. He's always begging for a drink from the vendors there. Honestly, he wasn't like this before..."
::&ZeroWidthSpace;
::'''Resident's Testimony (III)'''
::Testimony from a resident near The Steambird newspaper.
::"If you're asking about anyone suspicious... I did always see a little kid going to the newspaper, but he never went inside. He'd just mosey around near Sir Arthur. Maybe he just likes toys like that."
::&ZeroWidthSpace;
::'''Resident's Testimony (I)'''<!--It appears on-screen in this order, IDK why-->
::Testimony from a resident near The Steambird newspaper.
::"If you're asking about anyone suspicious... I did always see a homeless drunk hanging around near the entrance to the newspaper. He seems to have slept there every night recently."
----
;(Investigate Sir Arthur's pedestal)
:'''Notch on the Pedestal:''' (An empty pedestal. If you look closely, you can see a notch left by a sharp implement.)
:'''Paimon:''' What's this?
:'''"Curve":''' Based on the shape and depth, this was made by a small knife or something similar.
:'''Paimon:''' So where's the knife now...
:'''Talochard:''' Let's add this to our notes!
:;("Notch on the Pedestal" added to the Case Record)
::[[File:Case Record Notch on the Pedestal.png|100px]]
::'''Notch on the Pedestal'''
::A notch left behind by a sharp weapon, as though cut by a short knife or dagger.

;(Investigate the footprints to the side of the building)
:'''Messy Footprints:''' (A tangle of footprints, with no consistent depth or pattern.)
:'''Paimon:''' Argh, look at all these footprints. Looks like quite a few people came by...
:'''"Curve":''' Based on these patterns, they belong to four different people.
:'''"Curve":''' The paper has already put a lid on this news and isolated all non-related individuals. As such, we can assume that these footprints were left behind during the crime itself.
:'''Talochard:''' Let's record this in our investigation notes first!
:;("Messy Footprints" added to the Case Record)
::[[File:Case Record Messy Footprints.png|100px]]
::'''Messy Footprints'''
::Footprints of different depth, with different patterns, intertwined and overlapping. They should belong to four different individuals.

;(Investigate the spot on the steps)
:'''Simple Button:''' (A commonly-found button that shows signs of having its thread snapped.)
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? A button... Doesn't look like there's anything special about it... Y'know, other than the fact that it's here.
:'''Talochard:''' Let's record this in our investigation notes first!
:;("Simple Button" added to the Case Record)
::[[File:Case Record Simple Button.png|100px]]
::'''Simple Button'''
::A commonly-found button that shows signs of having its thread snapped.

;(Investigate the bottle in the planter)
:'''Paimon:''' Ugh, this bottle stinks... and it smells fishy, too...
:'''"Curve":''' Information retrieved: This item is related to a resident's testimony.
:'''Talochard:''' Let's record this in our investigation notes first!
:;("Dirty, Empty Wine Bottle" added to the Case Record)
::[[File:Case Record Dirty, Empty Wine Bottle.png|100px]]
::'''Dirty, Empty Wine Bottle'''
::A dirty, empty wine bottle from which a strange smell wafts, like a sea filled with salty fish.

;(Investigate the containers behind [[Salon Caritat]])
:'''Unsealed Letter:''' (A letter that seems to have already been opened. The writer's desires have dissipated with the wind.)
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't get it... What's with this letter?
:'''Talochard:''' Let's record this in our investigation notes first!
:;("Unsealed Letter" added to the Case Record)
::[[File:Case Record Unsealed Letter.png|100px]]
::'''Unsealed Letter'''
::A envelope containing no particularly special information. If there is any information here, then it is that the letter within is already gone.
----
;(After all clues have been found)
:'''Talochard:''' Have you searched the entire scene? Are you sure you haven't missed anything?
:'''Paimon:''' We've got so much evidence! Footprints, a bottle... Paimon's brain is almost fried!
:'''Paimon:''' Let's think, {{Traveler}}. Does this give us any leads? Maybe something that tells us what to do next?

:'''Help Paimon sort through the current evidence. What useful clues are hidden here?'''
::How many people are associated with the disappearance of Sir Arthur?
::Where can the suspect be found?
;(Select "Dirty, Empty Wine Bottle")
::'''Dirty, Empty Wine Bottle:''' A dirty, empty wine bottle which wafts a strange smell, like a sea filled with salty fish.
;(Select "Messy Footprints")
::'''Messy Footprints:''' Footprints of different depths, with different patterns, intertwined and overlapping. They should belong to four different individuals.
;(Select "Simple Button")
::'''Simple Button:''' A common button, with signs of having its thread snapped.
;(Select "Resident's Testimony (I)")
::'''"Curve":''' Testimony from a resident near The Steambird. "If you're asking about anyone suspicious... I did often see a homeless drunk hanging around near the entrance of the paper's office. Especially lately, he seems to be sleeping there every night."
;(Select "Resident's Testimony (II)")
::'''"Curve":''' Testimony from a resident near The Steambird. "A drunken vagrant? Oh... I know him! That's Rocher... I've seen him near the docks, he's always begging for a drink from the vendors there. Honestly, he wasn't like this before..."
;(Select "Resident's Testimony (III)")
::'''"Curve":''' Testimony from a resident near The Steambird. "If you're asking about anyone suspicious... I did often see a kid going to the paper's office, but he never goes inside. He'd just mosey around near Sir Arthur, maybe he just likes toys like that."

;(After picking the correct clues)
:'''Paimon:''' Things are a bit clearer now, but Paimon's not sure anything we've found is very useful. Paimon guesses the best lead is that vagrant, Rocher.
:'''Talochard:''' I agree! One set of footprints must be his, right? And he sounds like the most suspicious.
:'''Paimon:''' Why so?
:'''Talochard:''' Well, he's a vagrant and vagrants are meant to wander about. But he stays in one place. He's definitely up to something!
:{{DIcon}} I guess that makes a little sense.
:{{DIcon}} I'm not sure that's entirely logical.
:'''Talochard:''' Trust me, I'm right! Let's go and check out the docks. Someone said they saw him there.
----
;(Approach the pier)
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Men! Rocher has to be hiding here somewhere. He owes, so he has to pay! Find him for me!
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' And as if not paying his debts wasn't enough, he's made me chase after him! I'm going to trash his place and break his legs!
:'''Freed Puppy:''' Woof! Woof!
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' What are you barking at?
:'''Freed Puppy:''' *whimpers*
:'''Talochard:''' Stop! What are you doing!?
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Who are you? Mind your own business.
:'''Accomplice of "Intrepid Valberry":''' Director 42... Look at the uniform. They're the Marechaussee Phantom. Maybe we should fall back?
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' I don't care about who they are. Steel yourself, men! With me!

;(Defeat the debt collectors)
:;(Two of the men lay on the ground defeated)
:'''Accomplice of "Intrepid Valberry":''' Director 42, the {{MC|m=blond|f=blonde}} one and the robot are difficult to handle...
:'''"Intrepid Valberry":''' Blasted... mud! I slipped and fell. Guess Rocher got lucky. Okay, lads, move!
:;("Intrepid Valberry" and his accomplice run away)
:'''Talochard:''' I see you're a fighter, {{Traveler}}!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, that's nothing for {{MC|m=him|f=her}}.
:'''Freed Puppy:''' Woof! Woof!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, no need to thank me, pup. We're looking for your master. Does he owe people money?
:'''Talochard:''' Hey! Listen, pup, your master took Sir Arthur to pay off a debt, right? Spit it out! Where's he hiding?
:'''"Curve":''' In my humble analysis, this line of questioning will fail due to language incompatibilities.
:'''Freed Puppy:''' (The puppy looks at you, as if to say "Yeah, obviously.")
:'''Talochard:''' Th&mdash;Then let's search the area. That thief must be here somewhere.

;(Talk to the Freed Puppy, optional)
:'''Freed Puppy:''' Woof! Woof!

;(Talk to Talochard, optional)
:'''Talochard:''' Aren't these a girl's clothes...?

;(Talk to Curve, optional)
:'''"Curve":''' Information retrieved: The woman in the photo is...

;(Investigate the Ragged Clothes, optional)
:'''Ragged Clothes:''' (Ragged old clothes from who knows where, emitting an odd smell...)

;(Investigate the bottles, optional)
:'''Pile of Dirty, Empty Wine Bottles:''' (A pile of dirty, empty wine bottles from which a strange smell wafts, like a sea filled with salty fish.)
:'''Paimon:''' Those bottles! We found one of those by The Steambird!

;(Investigate the Old Photo, optional)
:[[File:Vagrants and Scamps Old Photo.png|100px]]
:'''Old Photo:''' (A picture of a loving couple.)
:'''Paimon:''' Is this... Rocher and his wife?

;(If all optional clues have been investigated)
:;(Freed Puppy walks towards a box)
:'''Paimon:''' What's that puppy doing?

;(Investigate the Strange Box, optional)
:'''Freed Puppy:''' Woof! Woof!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Is there something in that chest?
:{{DIcon}} (Knock on the chest.)
:'''Strange Box:''' ...
:{{DIcon}} (Knock again.)
:'''Strange Box:''' ???
:{{DIcon}} (Knock again.)
:'''Strange Box:''' Stop that! There's nothing in here!
:'''Talochard:''' Ha! In that case, you won't mind if we smash this chest up, would you?
----
;(Smash the box)
:'''Paimon:''' Woah! There's someone hiding in the chest!
:'''???:''' D&mdash;Don't hit me!
:'''Talochard:''' So you're Rocher?
:'''???:''' I don't have any Mora. Not a single coin!
:'''Talochard:''' It's okay. We chased the debt collectors off.
:'''Rocher:''' Oh! Wonderful. And what a charming young Melusine you are... You are right, I am Rocher. And when I make it big, I won't forget to reward you generously.
:'''Talochard:''' Dream on, you thief! We're with the Marechaussee Phantom and we're here to arrest you.
:'''Talochard:''' You stole Sir Arthur last night, didn't you? Confess! Who did you sell it to?
:'''Rocher:''' Me? Stole Sir Arthur? By the Hydro Archon! As if a person of my standing would do such a thing. And I've been hiding in this chest since yesterday evening!
:'''Talochard:''' Oh, really? Curve, what's the verdict?
:'''"Curve":''' Biodata anomaly identified. Mr. Rocher, you are lying.
:'''Rocher:''' Me? Lying? Nonsense! Calumny! Slander! Where's the evidence?
:{{DIcon}} The bottle by The Steambird...
:'''Paimon:''' We found a bottle by The Steambird, just like these ones. You left it there, right?
:'''Rocher:''' Even if the bottle is the same, that doesn't mean I left it there. Why, a place the size of Fontaine must be full of drunkards like me...
:'''"Curve":''' Result replicated. Biodata anomaly identified. Mr. Rocher, you are lying.
:'''Rocher:''' Hey! What's with this metal bucket? If I'm going to have my honesty and nobility smeared, I want an actual person to do it!
:'''Talochard:''' Less shouting. Listen here, thief. We're going to turn this place upside down and shake it to see if any evidence falls out. So no crying when we find something.
:'''Rocher:''' Look, then. Look! Without real evidence, all you can do is insult me.

;(Talk to Curve, optional)
:'''Curve":''' Information retrieved: The canine sense of smell...

;(Talk to Talochard, optional)
:'''Talochard:''' The dog...

;(Talk to Rocher, optional)
:'''Rocher:''' Without real evidence, all you can do is insult me.

;(Talk to Freed Puppy)
:'''Freed Puppy:''' (The puppy looks at you, as if waiting for something.)
:;(Opens Talochard's Investigation Notes)
:Choose the most reasonable evidence based on the question.
:'''What do you want to give?'''

;(Select incorrect evidence)
:'''Talochard:''' This won't be of any use. Try something else.

;(Select "Dirty, Empty Wine Bottle")
:'''Freed Puppy:''' Woof! Woof!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? What's he doing?
:;(Freed Puppy walks over to Rocher and sits down)
:'''Talochard:''' I know! He must have recognized a scent. The bottle must have Rocher's scent on it.
:'''Freed Puppy:''' Woof! Woof!
:'''Rocher:''' Lombroso, did you have to...
:'''Talochard:''' Rocher! See, the dog recognizes your scent. Do you still deny that you were at the newspaper office?
:'''Rocher:''' Okay, calm down, won't you? And Lombroso, you traitor...
:'''Lombroso:''' (Lombroso wags his tail happily, as if saying, "I don't understand!")
:'''Rocher:''' Agh, okay, I admit it...
:'''Paimon:''' Wow, Curve, you were spot on. How did you know? Can you detect liars?
:'''"Curve":''' Correct, Ms. Paimon.
:{{DIcon}} Really? You're a lie detector?
:'''Talochard:''' Hey! Didn't we talk about prying into other people's private lives? Get to know us first!
:'''Talochard:''' Hurry up and come clean, Rocher. What did you do?
:'''Rocher:''' B&mdash;But that's my private life, isn't it?
:'''Talochard:''' How dare you! 'Fess up, or you'll be enjoying plenty of privacy in the [[Fortress of Meropide]].
:'''Rocher:''' No! Okay, I admit I've told a few tiny little lies. But I didn't steal Sir Arthur, honest!
:'''Rocher:''' I slept by The Steambird's entrance last night, that's all. When I went to sleep Sir Arthur was there, but when I woke up it was gone. And I was worried people would suspect me, so I ran...
:'''Talochard:''' That's not the full story, is it? We've been told you've been seen there a lot lately. Planning your heist, no doubt!
:'''Rocher:''' That's not true! I was hoping to get some work there. You know, start off picking up litter, and maybe some bigwig might spot your potential and then, whoosh, your career takes off...
:'''Paimon:''' Seems like you were the one causing the litter with your stinky wine bottles. That's not going to impress any bigwigs, that's for sure.
:'''Talochard:''' I don't believe it. He's lying again!
:'''Rocher:''' It's true! Let me finish... I know how I look now. But I used to work at the [[Palais Mermonia]]...
:'''Rocher:''' Well, it was my wife that got me the job. Her family used to be a big deal and they still have some connections. Anyway, I used to be respectable.
:'''Talochard:''' Really? I'm not sure which is worse, begging for food or relying on your wife.
:'''Rocher:''' D&mdash;Don't say that. I wanted to become successful under my own steam, obviously. But that's when the problems started.
:'''Rocher:''' A while back, some people offered to let me in on their business. Don't worry about start-up funds, they said, you can owe us. So I signed up!
:'''Rocher:''' But I soon realized that the goods they were giving me were unsellable garbage... And then they started demanding I pay what I owed them.
:{{DIcon}} Were those the people who were here?
:'''Rocher:''' Yeah. I didn't have any choice but to pawn things from home to get some money. But I didn't realize that what I'd taken belonged to my wife. Something her grandfather left her...
:'''Rocher:''' When she realized this, I was too scared to tell her the truth, so I said that I'd lost money gambling. She was furious, and threw me out.
:'''Paimon:''' Huh? Why not tell the truth? Maybe she'd have forgiven you if she'd known...
:'''Talochard:''' Hmph. What does this guy know about telling the truth? If he claimed he lost it gambling, he could blame bad luck. If he lost it on a bad business deal, he'd have to admit to being a good-for-nothing loser.
:{{DIcon}} But what does this have to do with the newspaper?
:'''Rocher:''' A month ago, The Steambird reported on a team of scammers, the [[Elegant Tableware Confrerie]]. Those were the people who conned me! Professional con artists!
:'''Paimon:''' Wow. The Steambird is pretty good at their job, huh?
:'''Rocher:''' I know! That's why I wanted to work there. It would have been a respectable job, and I could have earned enough to get my wife's things back.
:'''Talochard:''' Hmph. Curve, is that true?
:'''"Curve":''' Biodata has returned to normal range. Mr. Rocher is not lying.
:'''Talochard:''' Huh? So it really wasn't him... So, did you see anything suspicious last night?
:'''Rocher:''' I did! I was woken up by some noise and I think I saw someone. Someone very small, running away... That's suspicious, right?
:'''Paimon:''' Someone small? The statements from the residents mentioned a young boy. Could be him.
:'''Paimon:''' But where would we find him? If only we had a puppy to show us the way again.
:'''Lombroso:''' (Lombroso wags his tail happily. He seems to know he's being talked about.)
:'''Talochard:''' Now that you mention it... Lombroso has an excellent sense of smell. Why don't we see if he can pick up a scent?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's not sure it'll work, but it's worth a try!

;(Talk to Rocher, optional)
:'''Rocher:''' I swear, on that metal bucket, that I'm not lying to anyone.

;(Talk to Lombroso)
:'''Lombroso:''' (The puppy looks at you, as if waiting for something.)
:;(Opens Talochard's Investigation Notes)
:Choose the most reasonable evidence based on the question.
:'''Give potentially useful items to Lombroso to have a sniff.'''

;(Select incorrect evidence)
:'''Lombroso:''' (Lombroso looks at you, as if to say "I don't understand.")
:'''Paimon:''' It's not that one? Let's try another.

;(Select "Simple Button")
:'''Lombroso:''' Woof! Woof!
:'''Talochard:''' Where's he going? Quick, follow that puppy!
:;("Rocher's Testimony" added to the Case Record)

;(Follow Lombroso)
:{{Black Screen|After some time, you come to a certain spot with Lombroso...}}
:'''Paimon:''' The puppy has stopped. Could the owner of the button live nearby?
:'''Talochard:''' Look, there's someone at home in that house over there. Let's go ask.

;(Talk to Lombroso again, optional)
:'''Lombroso:''' Woof! Woof!
----
;(Approach the house)
:'''Kevin:''' A con artist! Just like Momma! And that other one!
:'''Madeleine:''' It's not like that, Kevin...

:(Approach Kevin and Madeleine)
:'''Kevin:''' I don't know anything! Also, I hate you all!
:;(Kevin runs away)
:'''Madeleine:''' Don't run, Kevin. Ah...
:{{DIcon}} Sorry to interrupt...
:'''Madeleine:''' You... What do you guys want?
:'''Talochard:''' Don't worry, madam. We're agents from the Marechaussee Phantom, and we're investigating a theft. A button linked to your family was found at the scene. Do you have any comments?
:'''Madeleine:''' Oh, I sewed that on for Kevin just recently. But Kevin's a good child, he couldn't possibly be mixed up in theft.
:'''Talochard:''' I knew it! Madam, I regret to say you have raised a thief!
:'''Madeleine:''' Please be reasonable, Agent. Even if this is Kevin's button, all that proves is that he was at the newspaper office.
:'''Talochard:''' And why would he be there, if not to steal?
:'''Paimon:''' Uh...
:{{DIcon}} Did you just say "newspaper office"?
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah! How did you know that that's where the theft happened?
:'''Madeleine:''' I... No... You must have misheard me.
:'''Talochard:''' Ironclad irrefutable evidence! Don't try and lie your way out of this, you'll only make things worse for you and for your son!
:'''Madeleine:''' No! My son didn't mean to steal anything. He only took that knife to defend himself.
:{{DIcon}} Knife? I thought we were looking for a mechanical steambird?
:'''Madeleine:''' You mean Sir Arthur? But Kevin only had a knife when he came home.
:'''Talochard:''' Madam Madeleine! Why did your son go to the newspaper? What did he do there? Tell us everything!
:'''Madeleine:''' Oh... My Kevin just adores that steambird outside the newspaper office. Every time we go into town, he goes to visit it and tells it all his troubles.
:'''Madeleine:''' Yesterday evening we had a bit of a fight and Kevin stormed off... to the newspaper office.
:'''Madeleine:''' But this time, he came back with a knife. He said he'd found it stuck in the steambird's pedestal.
:'''Paimon:''' So that explains the notch. But why did he take the knife?
:'''Madeleine:''' He said he noticed that Sir Arthur was missing and wanted to find it. But then some drunken man staggered towards him. He got scared and picked up the knife.
:{{DIcon}} Could we see the knife?
:'''Madeleine:''' I told him to get rid of it. I was worried it might cause trouble...
:'''Talochard:''' That knife could be a clue. We'll need to ask Kevin where it is.
:'''Madeleine:''' I wish you could, but he's run off again. We're arguing a lot at the moment, about his father. You see, his father's a mechanical engineer posted outside the city. Kevin hasn't seen him for a long time.
:'''Madeleine:''' He's having a bit of an early rebellious phase. He's furious with his father for not being here.
:'''Talochard:''' A problem child, huh? Not easy to deal with. Still, we'll need to find him and ask about that knife.

;(Talk to Madeleine again, optional)
:'''Madeleine:''' There's no way Kevin would ever steal anything.

;(Approach Kevin)
:;(Hydro Slimes surround Kevin)
:'''Kevin:''' Come on, you blasted beasts! Eat me if you can!
:'''Paimon:''' Oh no! Kevin's been caught by monsters!
:'''Talochard:''' Isn't that fine, though? That's a problem child we're talking about &mdash; and any monster that eats him will inherit those problems. It'll save us some trouble, won't it?
:'''Paimon:''' Hey! We only need to take care of the problem, alright? Who wants to take care of a kid!?

;(After defeating the slimes)
:'''Kevin:''' Who are you? Why are you making such an unholy racket?
:'''Paimon:''' You... You might want to try saying thanks! We just saved you.
:'''Kevin:''' Thanks? Haha! What's up? Why the angry face? You gonna hit me?
:'''Talochard:''' Kid, a thumping would do you good. But we're professionals, Marechaussee Phantom agents. We don't beat people in public.
:'''Talochard:''' But we do need to ask you some questions. If you keep anything from us, we'll have to take you in! And then... Well, we won't be in public, will we?
:'''Kevin:''' Take me in? Sure, go ahead. And take him in too!
:'''Paimon:''' Err... him? Who is that?
:'''Kevin:''' [[Baulande]]! That's his name. You should arrest him too!
:{{DIcon}} Is that your father?
::'''Kevin:''' I wish he wasn't! I haven't even seen him for a year.
:{{DIcon}} Is he our criminal, then?
::'''Kevin:''' Yeah, he's a criminal. And my so-called father, sure, but he hasn't even been home in a year. Arrest him for bad parenting!
:'''Paimon:''' Ah. No wonder Madam Madeleine said this guy used to complain to Sir Arthur. Paimon guesses that's the root of the problem?
:'''Kevin:''' Complain? That's a laugh! I was working out how to set up his speech patterns. You haven't realized, I guess, that everything it says is programmed in advance.
:'''Kevin:''' As soon as I figure out how to do that, I'm going to program him to say "Baulande is a big fat weasel" all day, every day.
:'''Paimon:''' So that's why you were hanging out next to Sir Arthur? Wow, you really are a problem child...
:'''Kevin:''' But Sir Arthur disappeared last night, so I won't be able to finish my research. I don't know who took him.
:'''Kevin:''' You don't think I took Sir Arthur, do you? Sure, I'm a problem child. But stealing a mechanical steambird isn't one of those problems.
:'''"Curve":''' In my humble analysis, Mr. Kevin, you have come into contact with a knife?
:'''Kevin:''' Wait... This robot can speak? How does it do that? Is it the same as Sir Arthur?
:'''Talochard:''' Shows how much you know. Curve is much more sophisticated than Sir Arthur. For a start, he doesn't need to be told what to say.
:'''Kevin:''' Then... Wow, you're awesome, Curve. Hey, could you say something for me? Say "Baulande is a big fat weasel." I know you can do it!
:'''"Curve":''' First, you must prove that said statement is true.
:'''Kevin:''' Prove it? What the... So that means you can't do it? You suck. Even Sir Arthur could say that.
:'''Talochard:''' Do not confuse Curve with others. He's no liar!
:'''Kevin:''' Hmph. Well, I was going to tell you about the knife if he said it. But he didn't, so the deal's off!
:'''Talochard:''' Listen, brat, I don't think you understand.
:'''Talochard:''' If we find Sir Arthur, you can carry on with your plan to slander your father, right? We're on the same side here!
:'''Kevin:''' Oh! That... That makes sense. So...
:'''Kevin:''' Okay, I'll tell you. I threw the knife into the sea. I'll mark the spot on your map. Now hurry up and find Sir Arthur!
:'''Talochard:''' That's more like it, kid. Is there anything else you should tell us? The more we know, the faster we can find Sir Arthur.
:'''Kevin:''' Let me think... I went to The Steambird but Sir Arthur wasn't there. Instead, there was that knife. Then a drunk man came at me, so I panicked and grabbed the knife to frighten him off. That's it.
:'''Paimon:''' So that's what happened. Curve, did you spot any problems?
:'''"Curve":''' In my humble analysis, Mr. Kevin is not lying. But I did notice anomalies with Madam Madeleine's pupil dilation and breathing earlier.
:{{DIcon}} Was she lying?
:'''"Curve":''' I am unable to confirm that. There was, however, a data fluctuation when she told us that "his father's a mechanical engineer posted outside the city."
:'''Kevin:''' Haha. I can explain that. She was lying. Pop doesn't know a spring from a spanner. As if he could be an engineer...
:'''Kevin:''' My mother's a very experienced liar. She practices on me every day, you see, so you wouldn't be able to tell.
:'''Kevin:''' A little while ago she brought a puppy home and said it was a present from my father. But I snuck a look at her letters, and it was from some other man!
:'''Talochard:''' Well, maybe that man is your new father, right? So congrats, kid! I hope your new father does a better job than the old drunken leech.
:'''Kevin:''' Hmm... I might not like what you say, but at least you're being straight with me. I wish my mom would do that.
:'''Paimon:''' Kevin, don't dwell on that. Your mother's just trying to protect you. She's worried you won't be able to cope if you have to deal with too much all at once.
:'''Kevin:''' I don't want to know! It's knowing things that causes all my problems.
:'''Talochard:''' No, no, it's the exact opposite! Your problems come from not knowing enough.
:'''Kevin:''' Not knowing enough?
:'''Talochard:''' For example, you still don't know that humans lie constantly. Your mother, your father, even you.
:'''Talochard:''' That's the answer to your problem, kid. And when you realize that, you'll stop having such high expectations. Then, you'll be a kid with answers, not problems.
:'''Kevin:''' A&mdash;Answers?
:{{DIcon}} I'm feeling kind of attacked...
:'''Talochard:''' Oh? Do you disagree? Unless... you've never ever told even a single lie?
:'''Talochard:''' Forget it, I don't need to know the answer. I rather like you right now, so let's not spoil this beautiful moment.
:'''Talochard:''' The important thing is to find the knife. We've got to go, kid. Think about what I said and you'll find the answers you need.
:'''Paimon:''' Don't listen to her, Kevin. Listen to Paimon. Go home and have a good talk with your mom. If she lied to you it's because she had a good reason.
:'''Kevin:''' I know. Maybe I should go home.
:;("Kevin's Testimony" added to the Case Record)

;(Talk to Kevin again, optional)
:'''Kevin:''' Can a problem child really find the answers he needs?

;(Talk to Madeleine, optional)
:'''Madeleine:''' Kevin is back home... But this can't go on. Isn't it time to tell him?
----
;(Reach the pier)
:'''Paimon:''' So this is where Kevin got rid of the knife? Paimon thinks it's time to get wet!
:'''Talochard:''' I could. But Curve can't go underwater, unfortunately, and I need to stay here with him.
:'''"Curve":''' Sorry. Guess it's all up to you.
:;(If ''[[Ancient Colors]]'' has not been completed){{Verify}}<!--I'm assuming Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic Dog is the condition, but I'm not sure. It might be The Final Question-->
:::'''Paimon:''' Paimon doesn't understand why a robot can't go diving. Are you sure you're not just shirking work?
:;(If ''Ancient Colors'' has been completed){{Verify}}
:::'''Paimon:''' You know what? We've already met a [[Seymour|robot dog]] and he could swim! Paimon guesses Curve isn't that advanced.
:::'''Talochard:''' How dare you suggest Curve is less advanced than a dog! He's just not feeling very well. What was the dog's name, anyway? When Curve is better, we'll have a competition and see who wins!
:::{{DIcon}} Wow, someone's being unnecessarily competitive...
:::'''Paimon:''' In my humble opinion, we should be looking for evidence.
:'''Paimon:''' Never mind. Let's go, {{Traveler}}. We need clues!

;(Talk to Talochard and Curve again, optional)
:'''Talochard:''' Curve, how are you feeling today?
:'''"Curve":''' Motherboard temperature: Below warning line. Core functionality: 20%.
:'''Talochard:''' Hmm... Not much lower than yesterday. Keep it up, Curve!

;(Approach the current near the pier)
:'''Paimon:''' There are ocean currents here... Paimon bets the knife was washed away or something.

;(Reach the marked area)
:'''Paimon:''' The weapon must've been carried here. Let's have a look around.

;(Investigate the spots by the shipwreck, optional)
:'''Paimon:''' Nothing here either... Looks like we've gotta look elsewhere.

;(Destroy the stone behind the shipwreck)
:'''Paimon:''' It's actually here! Could this crab have brought the blade over...?
:'''Paimon:''' Let's hurry up and bring it back so Talochard and the others can have a look!

;(Investigate the spot)
:'''Paimon:''' Nice! This has gotta be the knife, right? Let's take it to the others.
:;("Waterstained Dinner Knife" added to the Case Record)
::[[File:Case Record Waterstained Dinner Knife.png|100px]]
::'''Waterstained Dinner Knife'''
::A waterstained dinner knife. It looks like high-end silverware, but for some reason, it shows signs of rusting.
----
;(Approach Talochard and Curve)
:'''Paimon:''' Talochard, Curve, we've got the knife! Here, take a look.
:'''Talochard:''' Huh, this could match up with the notch on the pedestal. But... it's just an ordinary table knife. Why would any criminal carry one like that?
:'''Paimon:''' Err... Maybe they ate at a restaurant and stole a knife there? Then dropped it at the scene of the crime?
:'''Talochard:''' I give your deductive skills 1 point. Out of 1,000.
:'''"Curve":''' Relevant information retrieved: A month ago, The Steambird exposed a case of fraud involving the Elegant Tableware Confrerie.
:'''Talochard:''' The Elegant Tableware Confrerie? Oh, I remember that. A knife like this was part of the evidence gathered... Hah! They must be responsible!
:'''Paimon:''' There you go again, with the "must be responsible."
:'''Talochard:''' Really? We can head back to the office and confirm it. We've got enough time left today.
:'''Paimon:''' Eh? I thought you two weren't really investigators. Can you really check up on other cases?
:'''Talochard:''' Okay, I guess we're kind of friends now, so I'll tell you...
:'''Talochard:''' I'm an evidence clerk with the Marechaussee Phantom. As such, getting a piece of evidence from the stores is easy-peasy.
:'''Paimon:''' A what? Is that even a job?
:{{DIcon}} So Curve is...
:'''"Curve":''' Evidence. Indeed.
:'''Paimon:''' Wow! The evidence is running around solving cases?
:'''Talochard:''' And why not? You aren't even evidence, but you're doing the same.
:'''Paimon:''' But didn't Editor-in-Chief Euphrasie say something about Curve being remotely operated...
:'''Talochard:''' She was helping maintain Curve's cover. She seemed to know his story... which is that he's a lie-detecting robot!
:'''Paimon:''' That's hard to believe. How come Paimon's never heard of something that incredible?
:'''Talochard:''' Because he's been stuck in the evidence storeroom. Curve is a vital piece of evidence in a case dating back 30 years.
:'''Paimon:''' Oh! So are you secretly investigating that shocking crime to identify the true perpetrator?
:'''Talochard:''' As if my life's that exciting. I just got bored, and decided to take Curve out for a walk.
:'''Paimon:''' And that's it?
:{{DIcon}} Curve, what do you think?
:'''"Curve":''' Biodata anomaly identified. Agent Talochard, you are lying.
:'''Talochard:''' Oh, {{Traveler}}. I was just saying I was starting to like you... and now you're using the Mosso Protocols' loopholes against me!
:'''Paimon:''' The what protocols now? You mentioned those earlier or something, didn't you?
:'''"Curve":''' My great creator, [[Mosso Lombroso|Dr. Mosso]], added some rules to my core programming to ensure the accuracy of my lie detection.
:'''"Curve":''' Those rules require me to answer all questions with complete accuracy and honesty.
:'''Paimon:''' So you can detect a lie, but not tell one? And if someone asks you a question, you're obliged to answer it?
:'''"Curve":''' Correct, Ms. Paimon.
:'''Paimon:''' What clever rules! So, is this Mosso guy some top scientist at the [[Fontaine Research Institute]]?
:'''Talochard:''' He was a top scientist, until he passed away. He died 30 years ago and Curve became evidence.
:'''Paimon:''' He died? How!?
:'''"Curve":''' Relevant information retrieved: Dr. Mosso died in a duel attempting to prove his innocence, after a court found him guilty.
:{{DIcon}} Why was he found guilty?
:'''"Curve":''' Relevant information retrieved: 30 years ago...
:'''Talochard:''' Stop, stop! You keep asking questions! And if you keep asking questions, Curve has to keep answering them.
:'''Talochard:''' Our priority should be finding Sir Arthur. Editor-in-Chief Euphrasie will be too upset to eat if we don't find him.
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon... finds that unlikely.
:'''Talochard:''' Well... Well anyway, Curve and I are going to see what we can find out about that knife. Let's meet first thing tomorrow at the [[Palais Mermonia]].
:'''Paimon:''' But Paimon's so curious! Couldn't you indulge her this once?
:'''Talochard:''' We'll indulge you tomorrow. How about we make you a delicious breakfast?
:'''Paimon:''' Oh, breakfast? Okay, looking forward to it already, hehe!
:'''Talochard:''' See you tomorrow morning, then!
:'''Paimon:''' Okay, they've gone. Paimon can't help but feel there's something going on on their end, though...
:{{DIcon}} Best not to stick your nose into other people's private lives.
:{{DIcon}} You can be nosy about that tomorrow.
:'''Paimon:''' Yeah. It's been a busy day, we should go get some rest. We'll meet them at the Palais Mermonia tomorrow.

;(Talk to Kevin and Madeleine, optional)
:'''Kevin:''' Mom, are you telling the truth? That Pop and... and you...
:'''Madeleine:''' Shh. Kevin, you can't talk about that outside of the house. You know now, and that's enough.
:'''Kevin:''' I know... And I'll be good from now on.
