==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Michica:''' The amount of contraband I've confiscated from packages would probably be enough for me to open my own shop.
:{{DIcon|!}} Is there anything of note nearby?
:;(If there are [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Michica knows)
:::'''Michica:''' One of my colleagues came across some newly formed [[Condessence Crystal]]s and Magical Crystal Ore on the way over here. Good thing, he was on the ball too, or he would've tripped over them.
:::'''Michica:''' Ores are very important resources, you know... They can be used to make lots of different things. If you have some spare time to go mine some, I'm sure they'd come in handy. They're not far off — I'll show you where to look.
::;([[Rich Ore Reserve]]s marked on the map)
:;(If there are no more [[Magical Crystal Chunk|Magical Crystal Ore Veins]] Michica knows)
:::'''Michica:''' What, what? A package... exploded!?
:::'''Michica:''' ...Oh no. Great... Uhh, I mean, sorry, just me being overly sensitive...
:{{DIcon}} Going to get a new job?
::'''Michica:''' Huh? Opening a shop?
::'''Michica:''' Oh no no, I don't actually have any plans to open a shop. It was just an analogy.
::'''Michica:''' Once you've worked here for long enough, you'll see just about anything.
::'''Michica:''' Get distracted for one second, and something in a package gets broken.
::'''Michica:''' Get distracted again, and the delivery address literally evaporates into thin air, because it was written in that kind of ink that changes with the outside temperature...
::'''Michica:''' ...*sigh* Forget it. There's no point going into it. There'll only be more pleasant surprises waiting for us.
::'''Michica:''' Sorry you had to listen to all of that. I hope I didn't take up too much of your time.
:{{DIcon}} Can you sell it to me?
::'''Michica:''' What? The contraband?
::'''Michica:''' Hey, kid, cut it out!
::'''Michica:''' Ahem, that was really just a joke! There's no way I'd actually go out and sell any of that stuff.
::'''Michica:''' Just pretend you never heard anything, okay? You have my thanks.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Alright... Would you sell to me, then?
::'''Michica:''' ...No, I'm not asking you to repeat everything.
::'''Michica:''' I'm not jesting! Just pretend that my complaints have all been burned away by the [[Sacred Flame]], taking my troubles with them!
:;(Obtain {{Item|Guide to Kindling|20|x=1}})
:{{DIcon}} How have you been lately?
:;(Available after completing ''[[No One Fights Alone]]''){{verify}}
::'''Michica:''' Okay... ish... Mostly because we've been short-staffed.
::'''Michica:''' The area affected by the war was so vast that many of our couriers, who were tasked with carrying battle reports, ended up collapsing from exhaustion. Many others are still busy running to and fro between the various camps.
::'''Michica:''' We are now prioritizing the delivery of intel related to the Abyss and reconstruction efforts. The efficiency of other package deliveries may be affected as a result &mdash; we apologize in advance.
:{{DIcon}} Safety first.
::'''Michica:''' You're right.
