==Description==
A heavy ceremonial sword of the Knights of Favonius. It is usually only issued after the approval of both the Grand Master and the Church.<br>
The craftsmen in Mondstadt have achieved some results in elemental affinity by studying the ancient artifacts of Mondstadt.<br>
This heavy greatsword is not only an honor bestowed upon a Knight of Favonius, but also the fruit of the hard work and skills of the guardians of Mondstadt.<br>
It can channel elemental power with ease. Its bearer would do well to remember that destruction is but a means to an end, the end being to defend that which must be defended.

Only a single-handed form of [[Rostam]] the Wolf Pup's Favonius Bladework survives today.<br>
Another form has been lost to history: that of [[Arundolyn]], the Lion of Light, who could wield both a longsword and greatsword together in battle.<br>
Because of the great strength needed, only those gifted with extraordinary strength could attempt this form. Thus, it soon died out.

Close companions growing up, Arundolyn was from a long line of knights while Rostam was born to a peasant family.<br>
Their childhood friendship was forged from a shared dream of heroism. As young men, they became fellow knights; as mature adults, one became Grand Master and the other his assistant.

Grand Master Arundolyn was no Vision bearer. His formidable strength came from a mixture of natural gifts and intense training.<br>
The Grand Master's strength was his pride, and the Grand Master was the pride of the Knights &mdash; nay, the pride of all in Mondstadt.<br>
After Rostam met his fate, Arundolyn never displayed his strength again. For no longer was it a source of glory to challenge ferocious monsters.
