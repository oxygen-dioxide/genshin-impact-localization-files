==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Tezozo:''' Should I go ask [[Xipilli]] for some more...
:{{DIcon}} Some more what?
::'''Tezozo:''' Handicraft material, of course! Xipilli's awesome at that stuff, and I'd love to learn the art too.
::'''Tezozo:''' But he gave me all sorts of strange materials, telling me that "it's more interesting if I found my own way to put things together."
::'''Tezozo:''' And yeah, it's been an interesting time, but I've just got too many ideas, and use too much material... I lose some at times, too...
::'''Tezozo:''' Before I knew it, this is all I was left with...
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Appreciate what you already have.
:::'''Tezozo:''' Well... I guess you're right!
:::'''Tezozo:''' We should make the most of what we have before considering anything else.
:::'''Tezozo:''' It's said that these are fruits grown from [[liquid Phlogiston]]... Hmm, I don't think I can use them properly for now...
:::'''Tezozo:''' So, you take them &mdash; remember to put 'em to good use.
::;(Obtain {{Item|Spinel Fruit|x=2}})
:{{DIcon}} See you around.
::'''Tezozo:''' Uh, sure. Guess I should try other materials...
