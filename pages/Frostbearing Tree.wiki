{{Description|The ancient tree that should have slumbered forever under the ice and snow has sprouted scarlet sprouts anew. Offer Crimson Agates scattered all over Dragonspine to this tree, and you may obtain rich rewards in return...|Map Description}}
The '''Frostbearing Tree''' is a landmark in [[Dragonspine]].

[[Offering]] [[Crimson Agate]]s to the [[Frostbearing Tree's Gratitude]] will increase the level to provide rewards and change its appearance.

As the seal is removed, the Frostbearing Tree on Dragonspine awakens and crimson sprouts appear. Collect and offer the tree the nutrition it hungers for, and receive ample rewards in return.<ref>YouTube: [https://youtu.be/VPZPI_UB00g Version 1.2 Special Program]</ref>
