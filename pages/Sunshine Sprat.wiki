|desc_suspicious = The fish has been fried too long, which has deprived it of all its freshness and springiness. The slightest touch with your utensils might cause it to break into small pieces.
|desc_basic      = Cooked with the right heat and duration to maintain freshness for a long time. Tender and flaky, delicately browned thanks to the layer of aromatic butter on top, which creates a multi-layered and unique flavor.
|desc_delicious  = The fish melts in your mouth, melding the flavors of the land and sea together as it does, making for an unforgettable experience. Little wonder, then, that such a simply-made dish can make it into restaurants of great class.
