==Puzzles==
===Electro Monument Puzzle===
There will be four nearby [[Electro Monument]]s.
*One of them will require defeating some [[Ruin Sentinels]]
*One of them requires solving a [[Cube Device]] puzzle
Once all four are activated, a chest and [[Thunder Sakura Bough]] will spawn at the bottom of a nearby well. Use the bough to summon an [[Electrograna]], which can be used to teleport to move to a [[Thunder Sphere]] and pass through a nearby [[Thunder Barrier]] containing a [[Ruin Guard]], [[chest]], and [[Electroculus]].

There is also 1 part of the [[Torn Page: Toki Alley Tales (Prologue)]] on a column near the Thunder Barrier.

===Kitsune Shrine===
Along the west coast of Araumi there will be a cave with some [[Bake-Danuki]] and wooden crates. Inside the cave there is also an [[Earth Kitsune Statue]]. Using the [[Memento Lens]] on it gives the following dialogue:
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Someone's Voice:''' "Ah, it would be wonderful if we could build a port here, and thus centralize trade with other nations in the hands of our government..."
:'''Someone's Voice:''' "O Almighty Shogun, please indulge the unworthy fancy of a mere Commissioner..."
{{Dialogue end}}

===Underground Level 1===
[[File:Araumi Well Entrance Kitsune.png|thumb|300px|There are 3 Earth Kitsune Statues in a well. Use the Memento Lens to unlock 3 mechanisms. Activate these mechanisms to open the passageway underground.]]
Much of Araumi is actually underwater; once you open it, there is a path to the [[Perpetual Mechanical Array]] and the [[Empty Boat of a Thousand Gates]] domain.

Unlock the gate to the underground requires using the [[Memento Lens]] (obtained from the quest [[Sacrificial Offering]]) on 3 [[Earth Kitsune Statue]]s located next to a [[Thunder Sakura Bough]] in a well below an [[Electroculus]]. This will reveal 3 mechanisms. After activating them, a door will open to the underground.
*Underground one can find 1 part of the [[Torn Page: Toki Alley Tales (Prologue)]]
*There are 2 [[Seelie]]s and a chest near one of them. Following the seelie to their courts will unlock a circular gate to the outside (north coast of Araumi).

====Cube Device Puzzles====
There is a [[Cube Device]] puzzle consisting of 5 cubes &mdash; 4 making a square and 1 in the center. Make the 4 outer cubes all align in the same direction as the center cube. Solving the puzzle will lower the water level nearby, so one can descend further below.

Swim through the shallow water to reach some stairs and a mechanism to unlock a gated door to the outside. Nearby there is an [[Old Stone Slate]] (#3) in a mound.

There is also another Cube Device puzzle involving 5 cubes in a line. Make them all face in the same direction. Solving this cube puzzle will further lower the water level, leading to the next underground level.

===Underground Level 2===
On this floor there are 3 rooms. One has a [[Thunder Sakura Bough]]. Another has a [[Thunder Barrier]] that requires a higher level of [[Electrogranum]] to unlock. And the third has 2 [[Ruin Guard]]s guarding a [[chest]].

Near the first room there is an [[Electro Rock Pile]] with some [[Seagrass]] behind it.

Beyond the third room, there are some stairs leading even further down to a door. Start the mechanism to open the door to descend to level 3.

===Underground Level 3===
There will be some [[Ruin Sentinels]] along the way ([[Ruin Scout]] and [[Ruin Defender]]). The passageway will lead to a huge space with a [[Teleport Waypoint]] and some ship wreckage with another [[Old Stone Slate]] (#4) nearby.

====Mifune Satoshi====
There is a [[Kairagi: Dancing Thunder]] guarding a chest. The Kairagi goes by the name Acting Instructor Mifune Satoshi (Iwakura Art Okuden). It will have some dialogue too:
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Upon approach)
:'''Iwakura Art: Mifune Satoshi:''' Are we pursued by the [[Shogunate]]'s lackeys, even here?
;(After defeating Mifune Satoshi)
:'''Iwakura Art: Mifune Satoshi:''' Haha... Hah... Like whistling in the wind...
{{Dialogue end}}

====Perpetual Mechanical Array Room====
Continuing further leads to a large room with the [[Perpetual Mechanical Array]] boss below. On the floor above the boss, there will be a [[Thunder Sakura Bough]] and some [[Thunder Sphere]]s. Using the thunder spheres to cross over to the other side.

====Unlocking Empty Boat of a Thousand Gates====
To unlock the domain [[Empty Boat of a Thousand Gates]]:
# Step on the panel with the [[Solomon's knot]] symbol to light it up. This will initiate a puzzle that involves stepping and lighting all of the puzzles surrounding the mechanism. After all the panels are lit, the mechanism will unlock. Activate it to open the gate. There will be a [[chest]] too.
# Inside the gate there is a similar panel-stepping puzzle with a mechanism. Complete it, and activate the mechanism to unlock the domain.
