The '''Dodocommunication Device''' is a magical device that the [[Traveler]] encounters during [[Summertime Odyssey]].

Created by [[Alice]], the device was originally gifted to [[Venti]] from whom another copy was given to the Traveler. The device served as the Traveler and Venti's communication channel throughout the event Story Quest.

==Lore==
The Dodocommunication Device was created by Alice and is visually modelled after the eponymous [[Dodoco]]. A pair of them can be used by two parties or entities to be able to contact one another by speaking to the device with the audio coming off the other end. However, the number of times it can be used is limited.<ref name="The Golden Apple Vacation Returns!">{{Ref/Quest|The Golden Apple Vacation Returns!}}</ref>

According to [[Venti]], only a select few have access to this device, with he and the Traveler being the only known users. However, when the Traveler and Paimon try to call him after being at the islands for a few days, an unknown voice answers instead and says that she cut off their connection to the outside world so that they can investigate the islands by themselves.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Immernachtreich Apokalypse (Part 3)}}</ref> The Traveler is able to call Venti again after the mystery of the islands is resolved, where he determines that she did not have any ill will.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Like Rhyme and Song, the Summer Reverie}}</ref>

The inspiration for the Dodocommunication Device came from another world.<ref name="The Golden Apple Vacation Returns!" />

==Trivia==
* The voice that answered is implied to be the Dendro Archon, [[Lesser Lord Kusanali]]. See [[Like Rhyme and Song, the Summer Reverie (Quest)#Trivia|Like Rhyme and Song, the Summer Reverie § Trivia]] for more information.
