== Dialogue==
===Daytime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Khaldun:''' Studying ancient history through linguistics and semiotics is tunnel-visioning. It's impossible to draw any meaningful conclusions from it.
:'''Khaldun:''' This is where you [[Haravatat]] would make mistakes. See [[Faruzan]].
:'''Yavanani:''' You [[Vahumana]] are no better.
:'''Yavanani:''' Your sociological approach to history would be putting the cart before the horse.
:'''Yavanani:''' It is meaningless to try to find some universal rules and norms that can explain all events throughout history.
:'''Yavanani:''' As for Faruzan, her points are out of date. Can't even be used as a reference.
:'''Khaldun:''' Hmph, I beg to differ.

===Nighttime===
{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Khaldun:''' [[Vikram]] is the obvious candidate for the next [[Grand Conservator]]. He's good at communicating, and will surely be able to strike a balance between the various schools of thought.
:'''Khaldun:''' His research paper may not be top tier, but he's still young after all, and has great potential.
:'''Yavanani:''' It is, without a doubt, putting the cart before the horse to rank interpersonal skills more highly than academic skills.
:'''Yavanani:''' I reckon that the most important quality required to manage the [[House of Daena]] is to be able to discern the academic value of books and adhere to the virtues of the [[Akademiya]].
:'''Yavanani:''' So [[Rifaet]] of {{Rubi|Haravatat|Semiotics}} is the better choice.
:'''Khaldun:'''  A single-minded focus on scholarly competence is like studying ancient history through linguistics and semiology. It's like bashing your head against a brick wall.
:'''Yavanani:''' Again? Were the arguments during the day not enough...?

;(Daytime & Nighttime)
:'''Yavanani:''' ...Should you deny that the Championship rates [[Darshans]] based on their scores, please recall that we all entered our respective Darshans via our test scores.
:'''Yavanani:''' To overlook the scores is to overlook the very basis for all assessments made by the Darshans.
:'''Khaldun:''' In turn, you should remember before you overemphasize the scores, that they are only representative of how each contestant performs for specific tasks exclusive to the competition.
:'''Khaldun:''' Moreover, we also need to consider other probabilistic factors such as weather, geography, morale and so on.
:'''Yavanani:''' Oh? And we didn't need to consider this when we were testing into our Darshans?
:'''Khaldun:''' A sophistic comparison! My test scores can represent my capabilities, but it does not showcase the totality of what a Darshan represents.
:'''Khaldun:''' A foolish opinion as usual. No offense intended.
:'''Yavanani:''' Disagree though you may, scores determine the rankings and results speak for everything.
