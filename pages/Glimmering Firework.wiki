|description    = A shrub with azure leaves spreading out like fireworks. The two white flowers at its center give off a most welcome fragrance, and it is said that when those who have had their fill of strong wine smell it, they shall be reminded of the forest in summer and the cool night wind. And as for those who do so after enjoying some tea, they will think of the outer wilds in early spring, filled with vitality.
