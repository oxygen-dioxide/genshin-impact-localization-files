|description    = An exquisitely-furnished mercantile district that pays homage to the layout of [[Sumeru City]]'s streets and its [[Grand Bazaar]]. Fresh fruits, delectable dishes, and all manner of lifestyle goods may be found at the stalls here. A few rounds around the area, and you will find a unique ambience one feels when stepping foot into a bustling market.<br>They say that the shops and stalls on either side of [[Sumeru]]'s streets have been modified according to specific rules that are the product of some [[Akademiya]] research, such that they can provide holistic service with the minimum possible management difficulty and acreage used.
