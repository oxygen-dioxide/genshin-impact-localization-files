==Description==
All knew [[Vennessa|the falcon]]'s protection was a blessing of Favonius,<br />
Few knew the blessing of Favonius was from a distant tribe.

Under the tyranny of the old nobles, Mondstadt cried for freedom.<br />
Enslaved was the exiled foreign fighter in the land of the wind.<br />
Yet she knelt not before injustice and deception, but set a shining example.<br />
For she overthrew the barbaric nobles and established a [[Knights of Favonius|chivalric order]] and [[Church of Favonius|the Church]].<br />
Blessed was she to eventually walk with the gods.

This was the sword that witnessed all her hardships and feats.<br />
A testament to her achievement in spreading justice across Mondstadt.<br />
You can feel her unrelenting spirit when swinging this sword:

Justice for the pressed.<br />
Freedom for the shackled.<br />
Wisdom for the deceived.<br />
Let the wind of justice and freedom lead.
==Lore==
This sword was originally wielded by [[Vennessa]].

==Trivia==
* Aquila Favonia is Latin for the "Eagle of the West Wind," which is the most natural interpretation for {{lang|Xīfēng zhī Yīng|zh=西风之鹰}}, one of [[Vennessa]]'s titles in the original Chinese version, whose official English translation is the "Falcon of the West." See [[Vennessa#Trivia]] for details.
