==Description==
All knew [[Vennessa|the falcon]]'s protection was a blessing of Favonius.<br>
Few knew the blessing of Favonius was from a distant tribe.

Under the tyranny of the old nobles, Mondstadt cried for freedom.<br>
Enslaved was the exiled foreign fighter in the land of the wind.<br>
Yet she knelt not before injustice and deception, but set a shining example.<br>
For she overthrew the barbaric nobles and established a [[Knights of Favonius|chivalric order]] and [[Church of Favonius|the Church]].<br>
Blessed was she to eventually walk with the gods.

This was the sword that witnessed all her hardships and feats.<br>
A testament to her achievement in spreading justice across Mondstadt.<br>
You can feel her unrelenting spirit when swinging this sword:

Justice for the pressed.<br>
Freedom for the shackled.<br>
Wisdom for the deceived.<br>
Let the wind of justice and freedom lead.

==Lore==
This sword was originally wielded by [[Vennessa]].

==Trivia==
* Aquila Favonia is Latin for the "Eagle of the West Wind," which is the most natural interpretation for {{zh|s=西风之鹰|t=西風之鷹|rm=Xīfēng zhī Yīng}}, one of [[Vennessa]]'s titles in the original Chinese version, whose official English translation is the "Falcon of the West." See [[Vennessa#Trivia]] for details.
