;(After completing From One Case to Another){{verify}}
:'''Cisik:''' Welcome to Pakpaka Flying School!
:{{DIcon}} What do you do here?
::'''Cisik:''' We give all cadets the necessary guidance and help they need. Things have changed a lot, you know. Back in the day, students couldn't expect that kind of tender loving care.
::'''Cisik:''' But then there was this one time when the coach was a little... strict with their words, and the student in question just happened to have quite a temper... *sigh* Yeah, that's not a fun one to talk about.
::'''Cisik:''' Anyway, our teaching policy's been shaken up since then. And I mean, nobody slaps a smiling face, and nobody hates compliments, am I right?
:{{DIcon}} I'll be off, then.
::'''Cisik:''' Here's to a pleasant day!
