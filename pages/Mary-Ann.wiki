'''Mary-Ann Guillotin''', also sometimes referred to as '''Ann''', is a historical figure from the [[cataclysm]] era and a member of the [[Narzissenkreuz Institute]]. She was fatally injured in the battle within [[Elynas (NPC)|Elynas]], after which her consciousness was absorbed by the [[Oceanid]] [[Lyris]], causing them to merge into the hybrid Oceanid [["Mary-Ann"]]. "Mary-Ann" would later create the young Oceanid [[Ann]] with parts of her memories and dreams.

==Profile==
Mary-Ann Guillotin was raised in the [[Narzissenkreuz Institute]] up until the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago, after which she and her brother [[Alain Guillotin|Alain]] were adopted by [[Emanuel Guillotin]] at the behest of the Institute's late Vice Director, [[Basil Elton]]. After Alain, [[Rene de Petrichor]], and [[Jakob Ingold]] all joined the [[Institute of Natural Philosophy]], Mary-Ann often visited to assist her brother whenever his assistant, [[Carter Scherbius]], had bouts of ill health.<ref name="AL1">Interactable: [[Ancient Log#Ancient Log #1|Ancient Log #1]]</ref> Mary-Ann was far more cheerful and personable than her older brother, a trait appreciated by their friends, and Carter noted how "Rene and Jakob like Alain's sister a lot, too."<ref name="AL2">Interactable: [[Ancient Log#Ancient Log #2|Ancient Log #2]]</ref>

After Mary-Ann became a member of the [[Marechaussee Phantom]], Alain built her the mechanical assistant [[Seymour]]. As Rene and Jakob's research became more and more radical, Mary-Ann was assigned to capture the fugitive elements from the Narzissenkreuz Ordo as they were deemed to be a threat to Fontaine. This led to an altercation within the remains of [[Elynas]], where a large explosion caused multiple human casualties, the destruction of many [[Recon Log Mek|metal animals]], and damage to Elynas' remains.<ref name="LDRD">{{Ref/Quest|Limner, Dreamer, and Robotic Dog}}</ref> During the struggle, Mary-Ann suffered a fatal blow. The Oceanid [[Lyris]], who was part of the Ordo and the former director of the Narzissenkreuz Institute, dissolved Mary-Ann and absorbed her will, creating an Oceanid with a merged consciousness &mdash; [["Mary-Ann"]].

After the battle, Mary-Ann was presumed deceased. The Oceanid "Mary-Ann" went on to construct the dream world of [[Annapausis]], hiding herself within a fairy tale that the human Mary-Ann had told Lyris many years ago<ref>Interactable: [[Annapausis#Interactables|A Story]]</ref> to avoid confronting the harsh reality of all that had happened, and waiting for everyone else from the Institute to return. As a result of this dream, "Mary-Ann" accidentally created the Oceanid [[Ann]], who possesses the memories of both the real Mary-Ann and Lyris, while acting in the role of the hero that Mary-Ann Guillotin dreamed herself to be in the fairy tale.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Search in the Algae Sea}}</ref> "Mary-Ann" and Ann would later find a fresh start in life, but the original human Mary-Ann's story seems to end here.

===Appearance===
As a child, Mary-Ann is shown to have had fair skin, chin-length brown hair, and gray eyes. As an adult, her appearance likely resembled that of the Oceanid [["Mary-Ann"]], who replicated her human form.

==Story==
Mary-Ann was raised in the Narzissenkreuz Institute up until the cataclysm 500 years ago, when its Vice Director, Basil Elton, entrusted her to former Marechaussee Hunter Emanuel Guillotin before Elton departed to battle against the dragon [[Elynas (NPC)|Elynas]]. After Elton's death, Emanuel took Mary-Ann and Alain in as agreed<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Veteran's Visage}}</ref> and treated them rather well.<ref>{{Ref/Item|Enigmatic Page (II)}}</ref> While Emanuel never grew close to Alain and Mary-Ann due to his lingering trauma from the [[Siege of Poisson]] incident, he nonetheless felt affection towards them and ultimately perished in hopes of creating a safer world for them.<ref>{{Ref/Arti|Forgotten Vessel}}</ref>

As Alain and Mary-Ann grew up, Alain joined the Institute of Natural Philosophy and there, created a thinking dog-like machine called [[Seymour]] to help Mary-Ann in her responsibilities as an agent of the Marechaussee Phantom.<ref name="FinalQ">{{Ref/Quest|The Final Question}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Arti|Masterpiece's Overture}}</ref> They also maintained their friendship with Rene de Petrichor and Jakob Ingold, fellow children from the Narzissenkreuz Institute who were admitted into the Institute of Natural Philosophy at Alain's recommendation.<ref name="AL1" /> While observing their dynamic, Carter notes that "When the four of them hang out, she sometimes acts like an older sister to them, despite being the youngest."<ref name="AL2" /> Their friendship lasted for several years, until Rene and Jakob's increasingly radical research into the [[Abyss]] and the legacies of [[Remuria]] &mdash; and the failed experiment on Carter<ref>{{Ref/Item|Enigmatic Page (V)}}</ref> &mdash; led to a permanent schism between them.<ref name="EPXII">{{Ref/Item|Enigmatic Page (XII)}}</ref>

After the Court of Fontaine deemed Rene's secret society, the Narzissenkreuz Ordo, to be too big a threat to Fontaine, Mary-Ann, Alain, and the others of the Marechaussee Phantom were assigned to capture its members. She, Seymour, and Alain tracked down Jakob and several other members to Elynas' remains, which led to a violent confrontation.<ref name="FinalQ" /> Seymour survived but was severely damaged in the process, while Mary-Ann was presumed deceased.
