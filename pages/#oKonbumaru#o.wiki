==Profile==
[[Neko]] describes "Konbumaru" as a good and smart child, who loves to sleep in high places. Neko had initially heard of the name "Konbumaru" from [[Asase Hibiki]], who was talking about [[Takamine the Mistsplitter]], and believing that she was talking about a good thing of some sort by Hibiki's expression, decided to name a cat "Konbumaru" every generation.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Neko Is a Cat: The Children}}</ref>
