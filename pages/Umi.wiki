{{Dialogue Start}}
:'''Umi:''' As the saying goes, the better a swimmer you are, the easier it is for you to choke on water.
:{{DIcon}} You're...?
::'''Umi:''' Ah, nice to meet you, I am the lifeguard here. It's a pleasure to talk with you on the shore, where you're safe and sound.
::'''Umi:''' When my first introductions with people take place in the water, they've generally gone... a bit less swimmingly.
::{{DIcon}} Wait, do locals drown too?
::'''Umi:''' Oh, there are tons! The locals here are the rowdiest of them all.
::'''Umi:''' I've seen some pass out after soaking in the pool for too long, and others with gnarly head wounds after trying to dive on the shallow end... Oh, and even Saurians dashing from one end of the pool to the other after being tricked into some liquor by the tourists.
::'''Umi:''' Each of those was worse than the last...
::'''Umi:''' But yeah, you know those folks who'd often say that the [[People of the Springs]] should get an [[Ancient Name]] for laziness? They should work my job for a day for a change.
::{{DIcon|Reward}} Must be tough.
::'''Umi:''' Thanks for understanding.
::'''Umi:''' That being said, I'm sure that laziness has been engraved into my bones by now...
::'''Umi:''' *sigh* I wish I could enjoy a hot spring soak undisturbed...
::;(Obtain {{Item|Hot Spring O'Clock|20|x=1}})
:{{DIcon}} That does make sense.
::'''Umi:''' Right? Anyway, please take care of yourself.
