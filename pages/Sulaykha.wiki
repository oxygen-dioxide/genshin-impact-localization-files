:'''Sulaykha:''' There's nothing wrong with loving money as long as you don't hurt anyone in the process of acquiring it, this much I understand.
:'''Sulaykha:''' So, hehe, my customers don't need to worry about a thing when shopping here.

:::'''Sulaykha:''' I won, hehe... I feel I should be selling something related to Genius Invokation TCG!
:;(If the player wins the match)
:::'''Sulaykha:''' Whoa, you're probably the strongest player I've ever seen...
;(Before completing [[Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies]])
::{{DIcon}} And you are...
::'''Sulaykha:''' I'm not just one of the best wooly blanket sellers, I'm THE best blanket seller.
::'''Sulaykha:''' Heh, not only blankets, I will be the top sales, be it toys, jewelry or kitchen wares.
::'''Sulaykha:''' ...Oh, but perhaps not books. This is Sumeru, after all.
::{{DIcon}} Not books?
::'''Sulaykha:''' Yep, no books. I'm a law-abiding citizen, so even if smuggling knowledge could make me rich, I still wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole.
::'''Sulaykha:''' After all, you can't keep making money when you're pushing up daisies.
::'''Sulaykha:''' Besides, making money is easy. Even with half my talent, you should still be able to make as much as the [[Homayani Family|Homayanis]].
::'''Sulaykha:''' Heh, if the [[Akademiya]] could have made an argument to get me to enroll that was half as convincing as my own sales pitch, I wouldn't have turned them down on the spot back then.
;(After completing Where the Boat of Consciousness Lies)
::{{DIcon}} You are...
::'''Sulaykha:''' I'm not just one of the best woolly blanket sellers, I'm *the* best blanket seller, period.
::'''Sulaykha:''' And not only do I sell blankets... I am, surely as I live, also the top in sales for toys, jewelry, and kitchen wares.
::'''Sulaykha:''' ...Oh, but perhaps not books.
::{{DIcon}} Not books?
::'''Sulaykha:''' Eh, books are just a non-starter. With Akasha's shutdown, the Akademiya is sure to revise the way they manage books.
::'''Sulaykha:''' Not like I ever like those things anyway, so nope, those waters are not for me. I'll just stick to the basics.
::'''Sulaykha:''' Besides, making Mora is easy. Even with half my talent, you should still be able to make as much as the Homayanis.
::'''Sulaykha:''' Heh, if the Akademiya could have made an argument to get me to enroll that was half as convincing as my sales pitches back then, I wouldn't have turned them down on the spot.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Sulaykha:''' Bye! You're welcome back even if you don't buy anything!
