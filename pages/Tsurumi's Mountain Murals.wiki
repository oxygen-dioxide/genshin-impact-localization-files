'''Tsurumi's Mountain Murals''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] that takes place in [[Tsurumi Island]]. It requires completing the [[World Quest]] ''[[Octave of the Maushiro]]'', as well as the Hidden Exploration Objective [[Opening Old Memories]] for the [[Star-Shaped Gem]]s.

==Procedure==
Place the three Star-Shaped Gems into the three mountain murals at the underground ruins of [[Shirikoro Peak]]. A cutscene will play where Electro Seelie emerge from the murals and fly off, after which Paimon will talk briefly. Afterwards, the ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' achievement ''[[Guessing Game]]'' is awarded and an [[Exquisite Chest]] will spawn.

Go to the Electro seelie locations as marked by the stars in the murals and follow each one in any order:

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
;(Interact with the "Open" prompt)
:Use Star-Shaped Gem Ã—1 {{color|menu|to light up the star-shaped picture on the mural}}?

;(After the Electro Seelie spawn)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, the way those Electro Seelie were chasing... whatever they were chasing around, you'd think they were Electro Cicins!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. These murals are pretty interesting. Are the mountains painted here ones you can find on Tsurumi Island?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's wondering... Do those stars mark the positions of treasure or something?
{{Dialogue end}}

==Trivia==
* Each of the murals have text on them written in [[Latin-Based Language]].
** The first mural, depicting [[Mt. Kanna]], has the text IN STELLARE FRAGMENTI SAPIENTIA OBSCONDITUR which translates to WISDOM IS HIDDEN IN THE STAR FRAGMENTS.
** The second mural, depicting Shirikoro Peak, has the text HIC TACITUS PERMANO CALOR ARDENS which translates to HERE SILENTLY SMOLDERING REMAINS.
** The third mural, depicting the unnamed third mountain, has the text VIGILARE CAELUM EST NO which translates to HEAVEN IS NOT TO BE WATCHED.
