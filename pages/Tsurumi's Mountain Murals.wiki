'''Tsurumi's Mountain Murals''' ''(unofficial name)'' is a [[Hidden Exploration Objective]] that starts in the [[Tsurumi Underground Ruins]] on [[Tsurumi Island]], and involves traveling to the island's three mountains. This objective has two prerequisites:
# The [[Peculiar Pinion (Gadget)|Peculiar Pinion]] [[Gadget]] obtained from Step 3 in the {{Quest|Octave of the Maushiro}}
# The three [[Star-Shaped Gem]]s obtained from the Hidden Exploration Objective [[Opening Old Memories]]

==Steps==
#Place the three Star-Shaped Gems into the three mountain murals at the underground ruins of [[Shirikoro Peak]].
#*A cutscene will play where three [[Electro Seelie]]'s emerge from the murals and fly off, after which Paimon will talk briefly. Afterwards, an [[Exquisite Chest]] will spawn.<gallery>

==Gameplay Notes==
* Completing this Hidden Exploration Objective is a prerequisite for the {{Achievement|Guessing Game}}. 
**The achievement requires solving the three [[Ruins Torch]] puzzles located in the underground ruins. Solutions are indicated by a nearby corresponding mural.

==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue Start}}
;(Interact with the "Open" prompt)
:Use Star-Shaped Gem Ã—1 {{color|menu|to light up the star-shaped picture on the mural}}?

;(After the Electro Seelie spawn)
:'''Paimon:''' Whoa, the way those Electro Seelie were chasing... whatever they were chasing around, you'd think they were Electro Cicins!
:'''Paimon:''' Huh. These murals are pretty interesting. Are the mountains painted here ones you can find on Tsurumi Island?
:'''Paimon:''' Paimon's wondering... Do those stars mark the positions of treasure or something?
{{Dialogue End}}

==Trivia==
*Each of the murals have text on them written in [[Latin-Based Language]].
**The Mt. Kanna mural has the text IN STELLARE FRAGMENTI SAPIENTIA OBSCONDITUR, which translates to WISDOM IS HIDDEN IN THE STAR FRAGMENTS.
**The Shirikoro Peak mural has the text HIC TACITUS PERMANO CALOR ARDENS, which translates to HERE SILENTLY SMOLDERING REMAINS.
**The unnamed mountain's mural has the text VIGILARE CAELUM EST NO, which translates to HEAVEN IS NOT TO BE WATCHED.
***Alternatively, since the text VIGILARE CAELUM EST NO is incoherent meaning wise, one interpretation for the originally intended Latin text could be VIGILA CAELUM NON VERUM EST, which translates to BEWARE, THE SKY IS NOT REAL.
