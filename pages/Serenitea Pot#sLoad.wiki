'''Load''' is informally described as the space taken up by [[furnishings]] placed in an Exterior Area or Room. Each furnishing takes up a certain amount of load, and the total amount of load taken up by the furnishings in the area cannot exceed the load limit of that area.

The amount of load that remains available in an area is indicated by the ''Load'' indicator in the Furnishing Placement menu with green, orange, and red colored dots.
*'''Green''': Many more furnishings can be placed
*'''Orange''': Only a few more furnishings can be placed, and the load is close to limit
*'''Red''': Only a few more low-load furnishings can be placed, or the load is already at limit

The amount of load available can depend on the player's device, particularly those with lower specifications. Only furnishings within the device limits will render, and additional furnishings cannot be placed when the device limit is reached. To place additional furnishings, decrease the [[Settings#Graphics|graphics setting]] of the device or use a more powerful device.

The amount of load taken up by duplicate furnishings (i.e., the second copy and beyond) is often reduced (see the Reduced Load column in the below tables). When calculating the load taken up by items with reduced load, the first furnishing uses the non-reduced load value, while additional copies use the reduced load value.

==Load Limits==
===Exterior Areas===
{{See also|Category:Serenitea Pot Locations}}
All Exterior Areas in the Realm have a load limit of 10,000 each. The load indicator will turn orange at 6,000 and red at 9,900. Note that the load amount of the [[Main Building/Mansion|Main Building]] will count towards the load limit of the Exterior Area in which it is placed.

===Interior Rooms===
{{See also|Main Building/Mansion}}
In the Main Building, the Main Hall and the Corridor have a load limit of 10,000 each, while the rooms have a load limit of 4,000 each. Note that the load amount of the [[Decoration/Ceiling Lamp|Ceiling Lamp]]s will count towards the load limit of their respective rooms.
