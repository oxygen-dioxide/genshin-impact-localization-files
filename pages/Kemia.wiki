==Dialogue==
{{Dialogue start}}
:'''Kemia:''' So many resumes are sent in every day only for me to find none that can be used. What's the point?
:{{DIcon}} You mean...
::'''Kemia:''' The Akademiya welcomes talent from all walks of life. After all, the talented are best known by the want of them.
::'''Kemia:''' But some co-workers of mine are rash to recommend everyone. My desk is now inundated with piles of resumes.
::'''Kemia:''' With all due respect, most of them... are just garbage.
::'''Kemia:''' The more imbeciles we take in, the more stupid things we'll have to deal with every day. It threatens our efficiency. I don't know what's on their mind.
::{{DIcon}} Not even one can be used?
::'''Kemia:''' I'm not saying that there's not a single capable candidate, but it's so rare.
::'''Kemia:''' As for students who graduated from the Akademiya, they may not have working experience, but they have developed good research habits and attitude in years of study.
::'''Kemia:''' We should give our own students more chances instead of recruiting untrustworthy outsiders with fake reputations.
:{{DIcon}} See you.
::'''Kemia:''' Goodbye, I hope there will be more true talent coming to the Akademiya.
