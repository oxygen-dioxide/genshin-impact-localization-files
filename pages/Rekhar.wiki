==Profile==
Rekhar is one of the prop engineers for [[Zubayr Theater]] alongside [[Najia]]. She and her husband used to be adventurers. Back then, she was fearless and often charged head-first into danger. Unfortunately, she was forced to stop after her husband died in an accident. Today, she is content working for Zubayr Theater, where she is grateful to [[Zubayr]] and the rest of the theater for their support.
