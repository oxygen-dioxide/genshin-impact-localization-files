==Duration==
{{Main|Elemental Gauge Theory/Advanced Aura Mechanics#Quicken}}
<math>\text{Duration (Seconds)}_\text{Quicken Aura} = \min(\text{Gauge}_\text{Origin Aura}, \text{Gauge}_\text{Trigger Element}) \times 5 + 6</math>

==Damage Bonus==
{{Main|Damage#Catalyze Damage Bonus}}
{{See also|DMG Bonus#Additive Base DMG Bonus}}
The Spread and Aggravate reactions add [[Additive Base DMG Bonus]] to attacks.

The Base DMG Bonus is calculated as:
* For {{Color|Electro|Aggravate}}, <math>1.15 \times \text{Level Multiplier}</math>.
* For {{Color|Dendro|Spread}}, <math>1.25 \times \text{Level Multiplier}</math>.

Level Multipliers for every level can be found in [[Level Scaling/Reaction#Level Multiplier]].

The Base DMG Bonus will then be multiplied by reaction multipliers provided by [[Elemental Mastery]] and [[Artifacts]] (the two sources stack additively), before finally being inserted into the damage calculation of the attack that triggered the reaction and will be further affected by [[DMG Bonus]]es, [[CRIT DMG]], [[DEF]] and [[RES]].

==Artifacts==
These artifact sets increase the DMG Bonus from Aggravate.

==Trivia==
* The reaction between Electro and Dendro is said to have a deep connection to the history of Sumeru.<ref name="SumeruTeaser01">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/6DjVUfy_Lng Sumeru Preview Teaser 01: The Fascinating Dendro Element]</ref>
** It is possible that this connection is related to the relationship between [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] and [[Nabu Malikata]]. While no characters or written records have suggested any link between Nabu Malikata and any of the seven [[element]]s, environmental clues suggest that she was an {{Electro}} god or otherwise connected to Electro.
*** During the {{Quest|The Dirge of Bilqis}}, in contrast to the other caves as well as the rest of the Great Red Sand, the cave representing the Goddess of Flowers is noticeably purple and filled with {{Electro}} enemies, [[Electro Crystal]]s, and large purple flowers, which are otherwise extremely rare in the Great Red Sand.
*** Throughout the [[The Orchard of Pairidaeza]], there are flowers that appear to be purple-red versions of the [[Padisarah]] decorations shown during the {{Quest|The Morn a Thousand Roses Brings}}. These may be the original Padisarahs. The original Padisarahs' exact shade of purple was said to be {{zh|紫红色|tl=purple-red}} by [[Nilou]] during the {{Quest|The End of the Sabzeruz Festival}}, and an achievement obtainable in The Orchard of Pairidaeza, ''[[In Her Full Glory...]]'', mentions "fuchsia Padisarahs." The flowers' shade of purple also happens to be close to the colors of the {{Electro}} element, especially when compared to modern-day Padisarahs.
*** Additionally, [[Sudabeh]] notes in the {{Quest|The Children of Vimara Village}} that "Electro is good for plants," which is reflected in the effect of applying Electro to [[Tri-Lakshana Creature]]s. While plants can also benefit from electricity in real life, such as after lightning strikes, zapping plants with a lot of electricity in real life will harm them, which does not seem to be the case when {{Electro}} is applied to plants in ''Genshin Impact''. This could be explained by Nabu Malikata, who was the Goddess of Flowers, having a connection to the Electro element.
