==Duration==
{{Main|Elemental Gauge Theory/Advanced Mechanics#Quicken}}
<math>\text{Duration (Seconds)}_\text{Quicken Aura} = \min(\text{Gauge}_\text{Origin Aura}, \text{Gauge}_\text{Trigger Element}) \times 5 + 6</math>

==Damage Bonus==
{{Main|Damage#Catalyze Damage Bonus}}
{{See also|DMG Bonus#Additive Base DMG Bonus}}
The Spread and Aggravate reactions add [[Additive Base DMG Bonus]] to attacks.

The Base DMG Bonus is calculated as:
* For {{Color|Electro|Aggravate}}, <math>1.15 \times \text{Level Multiplier}</math>.
* For {{Color|Dendro|Spread}}, <math>1.25 \times \text{Level Multiplier}</math>.

Level Multipliers for every level can be found in [[Elemental Reaction/Level Scaling#Level Multiplier]].

The Base DMG Bonus will then be multiplied by reaction multipliers provided by [[Elemental Mastery]] and [[Artifacts]] (the two sources stack additively), before finally being inserted into the damage calculation of the attack that triggered the reaction and will be further affected by [[DMG Bonus]]es, [[CRIT DMG]], [[DEF]] and [[RES]].

==Trivia==
* The reaction between Electro and Dendro is said to have a deep connection to the history of Sumeru.<ref name="SumeruTeaser01">YouTube: [https://youtu.be/6DjVUfy_Lng Sumeru Preview Teaser 01: The Fascinating Dendro Element]</ref>
** It is possible that this connection is related to the relationship between [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]] and [[Nabu Malikata]]. While no characters or written records have suggested any link between Nabu Malikata and any of the seven [[element]]s, environmental clues suggest that she was an {{Electro}} god or otherwise connected to Electro.
*** During the {{Quest|The Dirge of Bilqis}}, in contrast to the other caves as well as the rest of the Great Red Sand, the cave representing the Goddess of Flowers is noticeably purple and filled with {{Electro}} enemies, [[Electro Crystal]]s, and large purple flowers, which are otherwise rare in the Great Red Sand.
*** Throughout the [[The Orchard of Pairidaeza]], there are flowers that appear to be purple-red versions of the [[Padisarah]] decorations shown during the {{Quest|The Morn a Thousand Roses Brings}}. These may be the original Padisarahs. The original Padisarahs' exact shade of purple was said to be {{zh|紫红色|tl=purple-red}} by [[Nilou]] during the {{Quest|The End of the Sabzeruz Festival}}, and an achievement obtainable in The Orchard of Pairidaeza, ''[[In Her Full Glory...]]'', mentions "fuchsia Padisarahs." The flowers' shade of purple also happens to be close to the colors of the {{Electro}} element, especially when compared to modern-day Padisarahs.
*** The first three [[Consecrated Beast]]s released were aligned with the {{Anemo}}, {{Pyro}}, and {{Electro}} elements and could only be found in the [[Desert of Hadramaveth]] in the open world, with the exception of a single [[Consecrated Scorpion]] near [[Orobashi]]'s remains on [[Yashiori Island]]. As Consecrated Beasts are creatures that mutated after feeding on the remains of greater beings, such as [[god]]s, the elements of the Consecrated Beasts in the Desert of Hadramaveth may be explained by the deaths of powerful [[Wenut]], who are likely Anemo-aligned like the [[Setekh Wenut]]; [[King Deshret]], who is suggested to have been Pyro-aligned by the abundance of [[Flaming Flower]]s in the [[Great Red Sand]]; and [[Nabu Malikata]].
**** The subsequent release of {{Hydro}}- and {{Dendro}}-aligned Consecrated Beasts and their presence in the [[Girdle of the Sands]] can similarly be explained by the deaths of [[Egeria]] and [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]]; thus, the hypothetical explanation of the Consecrated Scorpions' {{Electro}} element still holds.
*** [[Sudabeh]] notes in the {{Quest|The Children of Vimara Village}} that "Electro is good for plants," which is reflected in the effect of applying Electro to [[Tri-Lakshana Creature]]s. While plants can also benefit from electricity in real life, such as after lightning strikes, zapping plants with a lot of electricity in real life will harm them, which does not seem to be the case when {{Electro}} is applied to plants in ''Genshin Impact''. This could be explained by Nabu Malikata, who was the Goddess of Flowers, having a connection to the Electro element.
**** Additionally, the three elements involved in the states of Tri-Lakshana Creatures ({{Electro}}, {{Pyro}}, and {{Dendro}}) may be a reflection of Nabu Malikata's possible Electro alignment, King Deshret's possible Pyro alignment, and their friendship with [[Greater Lord Rukkhadevata]], the Dendro Archon.
