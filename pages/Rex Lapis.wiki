'''Rex Lapis''', also known by his {{w|Goetic}} name '''Morax''', is the [[God]] of Contracts and a member of [[The Seven]]. He was the [[Geo]] Archon who presided over [[Liyue]] prior to revoking his providence during {{Quest|Chapter I}}.

Along with [[Barbatos]], he is one of The Seven's two remaining original members and the oldest of The Seven. 

Prior to his retirement, Rex Lapis descended in his Exuvia form during the annual Rite of Descension to give guidance to his people for a prosperous year. He currently wanders the world disguised as [[Zhongli]].

===Introduction===
{{Quote|The [[Mora|currencies]] that flow through this land are my flesh and blood.<br>For thus did I become the guarantor of the people's hard work, wisdom, and future.<br>This is the trust I have placed in them. Betray it, and you taint my blood.|Morax|[[Prithiva Topaz Gemstone]]
}}
Rex Lapis is the God of Contracts, Commerce, and the Warrior God &mdash; among many other names. He was the [[Geo]] Archon and is the oldest of "[[The Seven]]," and possibly being one of the oldest, if not the oldest, gods at over six thousand years old. He is shrouded in a plethora of legends; both true and exaggerated, often depicting him as an all-conquering, powerful deity.

In addition to forming the geography of the [[Liyue|region]] he governs, Rex Lapis defended Liyue in great battles such as the [[Archon War]], which was waged in the area that is now [[Guili Plains]] against other gods. In one battle, he successfully defeated an ancient god known as [[Osial]], using massive stone lances to imprison the sea god, which is now known as the [[Guyun Stone Forest]]. In another, he sealed the Mountain Dragon [[Azhdaha]] under a tree in [[Nantianmen]] following the dragon's rebellion. Other beings Rex Lapis has fought and slain include the [[Chi]] that lived in [[Qingce Village]] and the god that was [[Xiao]]'s former master. [[Orobashi]] also fought against him during the Archon War, but was defeated and fled into the [[Dark Sea]].

Morax is also the source and namesake of [[Teyvat]]'s currency, [[Mora]]. Morax's [[Gnosis]] was used to mint Mora at the [[Golden House]] before he retired from his position as Archon and ceded his [[Gnosis]] to the [[Tsaritsa]].

Currently, Rex Lapis resides in [[Liyue Harbor]] as [[Zhongli]] and works as a consultant at the [[Wangsheng Funeral Parlor]].

===Appearance===
During formal events such as the Rite of Descension, Rex Lapis takes the form of a half-{{w|Chinese dragon|dragon}}, half-{{w|Qilin|lin}} creature.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Rite of Descension|note=chinese localization}}</ref> However, based on other depictions of him, he typically takes a human-like form.

[[Statues of The Seven]] in Liyue depict him as an adult man wearing a hood and robes wrapped around his legs, holding a cube. In [https://youtu.be/Wv-Tr-sSoCs Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti], his back is shown, donning a white robe with a hood and wearing long, wide pants. His hands are depicted orange, with vein-like markings traveling up his arm. He has long, dark brown hair tied back into a long ponytail, with the rest being style in  wind-swept fashion. His hair fades into a bright amber at the ends of his rattail.

The ''[[Rex Incognito]]'' series claims he changes forms frequently depending on the situation (having appeared in the form of different men and women throughout history) but always has bright amber eyes in any form he takes. This is assumedly the trait that follows him throughout all of his forms, however Zhongli hints that Rex Lapis has a "true appearance."<ref>Web Event: [[Stone Harbor Treasure Journal/Story|Stone Harbor Treasure Journal]]</ref>

According to [[Xiao]], the statues Rex Lapis used to seal [[Chi]] in [[Qingce Village]] were made in his likeness.<ref>[[The Quest for a Cure]]</ref> These appear to have a similar head to his exuvia, with a more humanoid torso and arms.

==Story==
===History===
How he came to be is currently unknown, however he descended to Teyvat more than 6000 years ago.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref> After he descended, he lowered the tides and raised [[Mt. Tianheng]].<ref>{{Ref/Book|Stone Tablet Compilations: Vol. I}}</ref>
Before the [[Archon War]], Morax was already known as the Lord of Geo. He was close with [[Guizhong]], the God of Dust, and they formed a settlement for their people in [[Guili Plains]], which was named after them.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Treasure Lost, Treasure Found (Part 1)}}</ref> He was also on good terms with [[Guoba|Marchosius]] and [[Madame Ping]]. However, after the Archon War broke out, Guizhong perished in a battle that laid waste to Guili Plains and [[Dihua Marsh]]. Afterwards, Morax moved their people south of Mt. Tianheng, to the place that is now Liyue Harbor.

To protect his new city, Morax formed a contract with the [[adepti]] to defend the harbor as he continued waging war against his many enemies. Baqiu,<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|Primordial Jade Winged-Spear|Lore}}</ref> [[Chi]], [[Osial]], and [[Xiao]]'s former master were defeated by his hand, while [[Havria]], too gentle for this brutal period, was slain by her own people. The survivors of [[Sal Terrae]] were spread throughout [[Liyue]], many of them coming to Liyue Harbor. At some point, he befriended a [[Azhdaha|massive dragon]] and gave it sight, who became a lifelong friend, but the dragon eventually deteriorated from "erosion" and he was forced to seal his old friend away underneath [[Nantianmen]].<ref>{{Ref/Weapon|The Unforged|Lore}}</ref>

After defeating the other gods, he sealed them underground, where their physical bodies decomposed and became one with the earth. Their souls, however, were immortal; their desire for revenge and lust for life seeped into the earth, resulting in miasmas, plagues, monster attacks, and other such calamities. To quell these disturbances, Morax summoned the [[Yaksha]]s to aid him in battle, endlessly subduing the ancient gods.<ref>{{Ref/Book|Yakshas: The Guardian Adepti}}</ref><ref>Story Teaser: [https://youtu.be/Wv-Tr-sSoCs Yakshas- The Guardian Adepti]</ref>

As the Archon War came to a close 2,000 years ago, Morax emerged as one of the seven victors. The Seven would dine together in Liyue. Morax also met [[Makoto|Baal]]'s ''kagemusha'', [[Ei|Beelzebul]], during one of these meetings. Two millennia later, only Morax and Barbatos remained as the original Archons amongst The Seven. The other five died and were eventually replaced.

Morax's level of involvement in the [[cataclysm]] 500 years ago is currently unknown, but he is aware of how greatly it affected the [[Tsaritsa]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Downtown}}</ref> An unknown party later made a contract with him in which he would not disclose the truth of the incident to anyone who might ask.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|Amidst Chaos, the Rock Is Unmoved}}</ref>

In the more recent past, a xiezhi adeptus that had campaigned with Morax for many years approached the archon to discuss his plans to marry a mortal woman beforehand. Morax was not only fine with it, but also contributed to the couple's wedding gift. The couple would later have a daughter, [[Yanfei]].<ref>{{Ref/Quest|A Teapot to Call Home: Part I}}</ref> The xiezhi would eventually gift his daughter with a steelyard balance, said to be a treasure once given to him by Morax himself and could be used to measure the value of all things.<ref>{{Ref/CS|Yanfei|5}}</ref>

===Present Day===
{{main|Zhongli/Lore|Chapter I}}

In the {{Quest|Rite of Descension}}, Rex Lapis is purportedly assassinated during the titular Rite, and his vessel &mdash; known as the Exuvia &mdash; was taken away to the [[Golden House]] by the [[Liyue Qixing]].

In the {{Quest|A New Star Approaches}}, it turns out that he took on the form of Zhongli and instigated most of the events of the chapter with the aid of the Tsaritsa and her envoy, [[Signora]]. This was designed to be a test to see if Liyue was ready to move on without his protection, as he intended to retire from his position as the Geo Archon. Having not to have to use his [[Gnosis]] to personally intervene had things gone wrong, he handed it over for delivery to the Tsaritsa as part of his contract with her, which he called "the contract to end all contracts."

At some point prior to the [[Rite of Parting]] &mdash; but after handing his Gnosis over &mdash; Morax used an ancient adepti art to inform the Liyue Qixing through [[Ningguang]] that he was still alive, but had chosen to step down as the Geo Archon, thus dissuading suspicion placed upon the [[Traveler]] for his "murder," and to later confirm this to his fellow adepti (although Madame Ping realized this beforehand).<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Realm Within}}, {{Ref/Quest|A Single Harmony for an Irreplaceable Soul}}</ref> He left the matter of the official explanation of his death up to the Qixing.<ref>{{Ref/Quest|The Fond Farewell}}</ref>

==Character Mentions==

{{Character Mentions|alias=Morax}}

==Trivia==
* There are mysterious markings on his statue that have not yet been translated, [[Languages#Liyue Language|although they do bear some resemblance to somewhat-eroded modern Liyue writing]].
* In the last part of the quest ''[[Three Poignant Perfumes]]'', it was shown that he likes the smell of [[Fate's Yearning Perfume]], the one which was preferred by mature women.
{{Transclude|Zhongli/Lore|zhongli|section=1}}
* {{Furnishing Mentions|alias=Morax}}

===Etymology===
* In the demonology grimoire ''{{w|The Lesser Key of Solomon}}'', "Morax" is one of the twelve Presidents of Hell and the 21st demon, ruling over thirty (or thirty-two according to other authors) legions of demons. He teaches astronomy and other liberal sciences and gives good and wise familiars that know all herbs and precious stones' virtues. He is depicted both as a man with the head of a bull and a bull with the head of a man.
* His Chinese title, {{zh|岩王帝君|rm=Yánwáng Dìjūn|tl=Imperial Sovereign Yánwáng; Stonelord Sovereign; Rex Lapis}} includes the honorific title {{zh|帝君|rm=dìjūn|tl=sovereign,}} typically added to the names of Daoist deities.<ref>Google Books: [https://books.google.com.au/books?id=aeMTAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA405#v=onepage&q&f=false "What The Master Would Not Discuss"]</ref> His Chinese honorific title, {{zh|岩王爷|rm=Yánwáng-yé|tl=King Rock}} may be derived from the {{Lang|{{w|King Yan}}|zh=阎王爷|zh_rm=Yánwángyé|zh_tl={{w|Yama (Buddhism)|Grandfatherly King Yan}}}}.
** "Rex Lapis" is thus thematically tied to the Chinese theme of the Liyue region and its [[Adepti]] (who are Taoist immortals), contrasting the ''Ars Goetia'' theme of his name "Morax."
* Two of Morax's titles, "God of Wealth and Prosperity" and "Warrior God" are ascribed to {{w|Kubera}} and {{w|Vaiśravaṇa}}, two names for the deity who leads the yakshas in Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist mythology.
* Morax's quote {{Lang|"Ones who break their contracts shall suffer the Wrath of the Rock"|zh=食言者当受食岩之罚|zh_tl=Those who break their promises shall be punished by being swallowed by rocks}} also doubles as a pun in the original Chinese text &mdash; {{zh|食言|rm=shíyán|tl=break their promises}} is a homophone of {{zh|食岩|rm=shí yán|tl=swallowed by rocks.}}
