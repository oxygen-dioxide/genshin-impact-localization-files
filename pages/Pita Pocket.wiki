|description     = A bread with varied fillings.
|desc_suspicious = The pastry shell feels like sand, and the firm fillings present an unpleasant color... Only a lost traveler who has been starving for days would willingly accept this Pita Pocket.
|desc_basic      = The flat dough has puffed up in the oven, reminding you of a lovely Pufferfish. The bread is usually cut in the middle into two separate "pockets," hence the name, "Pita Pocket." It is said that people of [[Sumeru]] used to dip the bread in sauce. But nowadays, people usually stuff the "pockets" with different fillings and then take big mouthfuls.
|desc_delicious  = Aromatic meat and crunchy vegetables are the leading actors of this big show. The sauce, or the "gaffer," has expertly focused the limelight on their duet, while each "pocket" is full of surprises, just like a magician's bag.

==Trivia==
* The recipe for the Pita Pocket differs from normal recipes, as it is given to the player with special notes from Collei. The recipe description is as follows: "A handwritten Pita Pocket recipe, with detailed cooking tips in small letters. The writer's penmanship seems questionable. Some letters are shaky, perhaps due to the bad condition she was in. However, every word was written carefully. If you have learned how to cook it, don't forget to enjoy this delicious food with her the next time you visit Gandharva Ville."
