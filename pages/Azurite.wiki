'''Azurite''' is an [[Event Item]] obtained during the {{Quest|Currents Deep Beneath the Lanterns}} as requested by [[Wang'ya]].

According to Wang'ya, when Azurite gets caught in the roots of ordinary vegetation, it sometimes produces [[Bloatty Floatty|Bloatty Floatties]], which have floating seeds.

==Trivia==
* Real-life {{w|azurite}}s are blue copper minerals. However, the game item's name more likely derives from a combination of the words "azure" and "[[plaustrite]]."
