'''Azurite''' is a Quest Item obtained during the "[[Currents Deep Beneath the Lanterns]]" Event [[World Quest]] as requested by [[Wang'ya]]. According to her, when Azurite gets caught in the roots of ordinary vegetation, it sometimes produces [[Bloatty Floatty|Bloatty Floatties]], which have floating seeds.

==Trivia==
*Real-life {{w|Azurite|azurites}} are blue copper minerals. However, the game item's name more likely derives from a combination of the words "azure" and "[[plaustrite]]."
