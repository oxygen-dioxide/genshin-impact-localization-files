A '''seal''' prevents interaction with an object, effectively '''locking''' it. Seals are commonly found around [[Chest]]s, [[Elemental Monument]]s, and [[Ruin Brazier]]s.

==Unlocking==
Some seals requires defeating enemies. Others require completing puzzles or activating mechanisms.

==Trivia==
* The text on these seals is written in the [[Latin-Based Language]] and reads "''ad virtutem''".
