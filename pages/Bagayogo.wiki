:'''Bagayogo:''' Oh no... Was I just here?
:{{DIcon}} Are you lost?
::'''Bagayogo:''' Yes, I wa... I mean no I wasn't! I'm not lost!
::'''Bagayogo:''' *sigh* I'm sorry, I'm just so anxious that I'm not even making sense anymore.
::'''Bagayogo:''' I'm not lost, but I do seem to have accidentally lost my daughter, [[Arcantel]].
::'''Bagayogo:''' ...For all I know, this is no accident, and just her running around as always, that little rascal...
::'''Bagayogo:''' If you run into a little girl spouting a stream of absolute nonsense about art, she's probably the one!
::'''Bagayogo:''' *sigh* She just enjoys chatting with people by the roadside. I'm sure she'll come back once she's said her piece...
:{{DIcon}} Relax. Don't panic just yet.
::'''Bagayogo:''' Even so, it's out of my hands...
