{{Enemy Attacks
|name_1 = Fury
|desc_1 = Taking high DMG from a single attack will charge Fury. The higher the DMG dealt, the more Fury will be accumulated. When they have a full Fury bar, they will grow bigger and gain access to enhanced attacks.<table class="fandom-table"><tr><th>DMG Taken (%Max HP)</th><th>Fury Accumulated (%)</th></tr><tr><td>18.75-31.25</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>31.25-43.75</td><td>40</td></tr><tr><td>43.75-56.25</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>56.25+</td><td>100</td></tr></table>

|name_2 = Rock Spit
|desc_2 = Shoots three small homing rocks that deal '''80% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}. The shots also knock the Specter backwards.

|name_3 = Propeller Bump
|desc_3 = Spins before knocking into the player, dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|Geo DMG}}.

|name_4 = Earthquake
|desc_4 = Shoots a projectile at the ground under it that bursts into an earthquake that deals '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|[[AoE]] Geo DMG}}. This attack will only occur at max Fury and will be the only attack it uses in that state.

|name_5 = Final Burst
|desc_5 = Explodes after a short pause when defeated dealing '''100% ATK''' as {{Color|AoE Geo DMG}}. If at max Fury, DMG is increased to '''120% ATK'''.

===AI Logic===
{{See also|Cooldown#Enemy Cooldowns}}
* An ability will only be used if all of the following conditions have been met:
** The ability is not on cooldown
** The target is within the range required by the ability
** The ability has the highest priority out of all that meet the previous 2 conditions
*** A lower priority number indicates a higher priority.
*** If multiple abilities share the highest priority, one will be chosen at random.
* Certain abilities with extra trigger conditions may defy regular ability logic.
