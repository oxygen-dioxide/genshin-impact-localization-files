'''Lightning Storm''' is [[Beidou]]'s [[4th Ascension Passive]].

==Gameplay Notes==
* The buffs are not lost upon switching characters.
* While the buffs are active and Beidou is the active character, Beidou gains the "buff" arrows on her character as well as the following special effects:
** There is a humming sound effect if Beidou's weapon is out. (There is no humming sound effect if Beidou's weapon is not out, such as if Beidou was switched out and then back in.)
** Beidou's weapon will flash with an Electro visual effect upon appearing at her back. It will also flash with the Electro visual effect upon appearing in her hands for an attack if it was not previously present, such as if Beidou was switched out and then back in.
