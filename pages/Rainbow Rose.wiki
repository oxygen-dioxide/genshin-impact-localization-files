==Description==
{{Description|A delicate and tender pink flower. Despite the name, Rainbow Roses are essentially more akin to Lilies.<br>It is said to represent passion and romantic encounters.<br>According to ancient records, rainbow-colored roses were once a common sight. Their bright colors could almost rival the blazing flames of the seven heavens. This flower has gone extinct, and as the era came to a tumultuous end, a plant that used to grow symbiotically with it stole the name "Rainbow Rose."}}
