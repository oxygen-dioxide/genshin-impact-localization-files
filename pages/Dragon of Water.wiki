The '''Dragon of Water''' was the ruler of [[Vishaps]] with sovereignty over water and one of the [[Seven Sovereigns]].

==Story==
The original Dragon of Water was one of the Seven Sovereigns, dragon-lords who ruled over the seven nations of the old world. Alongside the other sovereigns, it went to war against the [[Primordial One]] and was eventually defeated.<ref>{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|2|Before Sun and Moon}}</ref> Sometime following its defeat, the original Dragon of Water withered away.<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Primordial Bathysmal Vishap}}</ref>

A prophecy in [[Enkanomiya]] claims that a new Dragon of Water will be born in human form, as these dragon-lords require a "pure" vessel and the [[Bathysmal Vishaps]], originally {{Hydro}}, had become "impure" when they evolved to harness the powers of {{Electro}} and {{Cryo}}.<ref>{{Ref/Enemy|Bolteater Bathysmal Vishap Hatchling}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|4|Bathysmal Vishap Experimental Records}}</ref><ref>{{Ref/Book|The Byakuyakoku Collection|5|In the Light, Beneath the Shadow}}</ref>
