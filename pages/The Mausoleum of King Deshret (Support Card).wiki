==Story==
{{Description|"The huge cone is like a supporting pillar between the high sky and the yellow sands that has stood in the middle of the desert since time immemorial. Standing in front of it, be you a commoner, a wealthy man, or a well-informed researcher, you shall feel that you are but a few grains of sand all the same."|title=The Mausoleum of King Deshret}}
