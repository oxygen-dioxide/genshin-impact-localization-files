On this most special day, I, Furina de Fontaine, extend to you this most exclusive of invitations.

You are cordially invited to enjoy today's limited performance &mdash; the "Ode to Desserts." The star of the show is none other than the cake of which just sixteen slices a day are available, with plenty of sweet treats making delightful cameo appearances. As for the set, I've arranged three towering Ferris wheel dessert stands to ensure a stage overflowing with dazzling effects.

Now, as for the climactic scene, that's something you'll have to see for yourself! I won't spoil the surprise. But I do promise, the beautiful melody of this performance will linger in your mind for a full week and more!

No need for you to check the signature &mdash; this invitation was penned by my own hand!

As for everything else, we'll discuss in detail after you arrive at the birthday tea party. Now, I'm off to buy the cake with Mademoiselle Crabaletta. Toodaloo~!
